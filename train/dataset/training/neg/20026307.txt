Viperin is an interferon-inducible protein inhibiting many DNA and RNA viruses.
It contains an N-terminal transmembrane helix, a highly conserved C-terminus and 
a middle region carrying a CX3CX2C motif, characteristic of radical
S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) enzymes. So far no structural characterization has 
been reported and reconstitution of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in viperin all failed.
Here, by dissecting the 361-residue human viperin into 12 fragments, followed by 
extensive CD and NMR characterization, Viperin (45-361) was identified to be
soluble and structured in buffers. Most importantly, we have successfully
reconstituted the [4Fe-4S] cluster in Viperin (45-361), thus providing the first 
experimental evidence confirming that viperin is indeed a radical SAM enzyme.
Furthermore, the C-terminus Viperin (214-361) which is insoluble in buffers but
again can be solubilized in salt-free water appears to be only partially folded. 
Our results thus imply that the radical SAM enzyme activity may play a key role
in the broad antiviral actions of viperin.
