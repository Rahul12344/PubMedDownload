Organizing pneumonia is a well-differentiated clinical and histologic entity
whose onset is usually subacute with respiratory symptoms and pulmonary
infiltrates. Its origin may be unknown (cryptogenic) or it may be associated with
various medical conditions, infectious diseases, or drugs. Diagnosis is confirmed
by the presence of foci of organizing pneumonia in lung biopsy specimens. Our
patient was a 49-year-old man infected with the hepatitis C virus who was
receiving pegylated interferon alfa-2b. He presented with dry cough, fever,
dyspnea, and ground glass pulmonary infiltrates. After an open lung biopsy, he
was diagnosed with organizing pneumonia. When pegylated interferon was
discontinued and corticosteroids started, the symptoms and pulmonary infiltrates 
disappeared. To our knowledge, this is the second report of organizing pneumonia 
related to pegylated interferon alfa-2b.
