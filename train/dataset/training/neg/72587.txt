Intraaxonal transport of Herpes simplex virus in the rat central nervous system.

Bak IJ, Markham CH, Cook ML, Stevens JG.

Light and electron microscopic observation 3--4 days after microinjection of
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) into the left neostriatum of rat demonstrated the
following results. (1) Virus labeled nerve cells were found in the ipsilateral
substantia nigra; a large number of infected neurons were in the zona compacta
and some were in the zona reticulata. No virus infection was evident in the
contralateral side. (2) Virus labeled neurons were found in the cortex, a greater
number ipsilaterally than contralaterally, and in the dorsal raphé nuclei.
Cortical microinjection of HSV led to infection of some cortical cells but no
neostriatal cells. We conclude, therefore, that spread of the virus to the
cortex, the substantia nigra and the dorsal raphé following neostriatal injection
was by retrograde axonal transport. (3) The left neostriatum, where HSV was
injected, showed a surprisingly small number of virus infected neurons. The
infected neurons were mostly the large neurons; the majority of medium sized
neurons were well preserved. There was massive degeneration of nerve terminals
throughout the neuropil. Most of these degenerating nerve terminals are
considered to be afferent fibers.
