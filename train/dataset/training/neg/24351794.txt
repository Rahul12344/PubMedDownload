West Nile virus (WNV; Flavivirus; Flaviviridae) is the cause of the most
widespread arthropod-borne viral disease in the world and the largest outbreak of
neuroinvasive disease ever observed. Mosquito-borne outbreaks are influenced by
intrinsic (e.g., vector and viral genetics, vector and host competence, vector
life-history traits) and extrinsic (e.g., temperature, rainfall, human land use) 
factors that affect virus activity and mosquito biology in complex ways. The
concept of vectorial capacity integrates these factors to address interactions of
the virus with the arthropod host, leading to a clearer understanding of their
complex interrelationships, how they affect transmission of vector-borne disease,
and how they impact human health. Vertebrate factors including host competence,
population dynamics, and immune status also affect transmission dynamics. The
complexity of these interactions are further exacerbated by the fact that not
only can divergent hosts differentially alter the virus, but the virus also can
affect both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts in ways that significantly alter
patterns of virus transmission. This chapter concentrates on selected components 
of the virus-vector-vertebrate interrelationship, focusing specifically on how
interactions between vector, virus, and environment shape the patterns and
intensity of WNV transmission.
