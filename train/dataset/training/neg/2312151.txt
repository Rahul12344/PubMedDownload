The pathogenic mechanism leading to liver tissue injury in hepatitis caused by
hepatitis A virus is unclear. We have randomly established T-cell clones from
liver biopsies from four patients with hepatitis A. A total of 578 clones was
phenotypically analysed. During the acute phase of the disease CD8+ clones
dominated over CD4+ clones, whereas in a biopsy taken late after onset of
clinical syndromes more CD4+ than CD8+ clones were obtained. Interestingly, in a 
patient with a second exacerbation of the disease, more than 20% of all clones
had the CD3+ WT31- CD4- CD8- 'NK-like' phenotype. All CD8+ clones had cytotoxic
activity and approximately 50% of all CD8+ clones showed specific cytotoxicity
against autologous fibroblasts infected with hepatitis A virus. The CD8+ cells
also produced IFN-gamma in response to these target cells. Variable IFN-gamma
production was observed with all types of T-cell clones. These results suggest
that the liver injury in hepatitis A is not caused by a viral cytopathogenic
effect but is due to an immunopathological reaction of sensitized cytotoxic T
lymphocytes against infected hepatocytes. In addition, these studies show an
enrichment of CD4-8-T-cell receptor alpha beta-chain-negative T lymphocytes at
the site of an inflammation and suggest a role of these cells in an anti-viral
reaction.
