Staphylococcus aureus from patients with toxic shock syndrome (TSS) produce TSS
toxin 1. We transferred, by a bacteriophage, the ability to produce TSS toxin 1
from a TSS toxin 1-positive to a TSS toxin 1-negative strain of S. aureus. This
recombinant strain produced TSS toxin 1 as confirmed by isoelectric focusing,
immunodiffusion, radioimmunoassay, and autoradiography. The recombinant produced 
TSS-like illness in rabbits, and was significantly (P less than 0.001) more
lethal than the recipient strain. Both strains produced fever and diarrhea, but, 
in addition, rabbits challenged with the recombinant also developed lowered blood
pressure (P = 0.002), conjunctival hyperemia, erythroderma, and respiratory
distress. Histopathological findings in rabbits challenged with the recombinant
strain were remarkably similar to those described for humans with TSS, e.g.,
erythrophagocytosis, liver "triaditis," and vasodilatation. This study
demonstrates that this protein may contribute to the pathogenesis of the TSS.
