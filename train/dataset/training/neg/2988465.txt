Still's disease associated with Coxsackie infection and haemophagocytic syndrome.

Heaton DC, Moller PW.

At the onset of Still's disease (systemic-onset juvenile arthritis) in a
12-year-old girl, serological evidence of Coxsackie B virus infection was found. 
Two weeks later she developed a haemophagocytic syndrome which was then treated
with cytotoxic therapy. Her arthritis is still active six years later.
