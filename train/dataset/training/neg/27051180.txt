AIM: Avian encephalomyelitis (AE) is a viral disease which can infect various
types of poultry, especially chicken. In Indonesia, the incidence of AE infection
in chicken has been reported since 2009, the AE incidence tends to increase from 
year to year. The objective of this study was to analyze viral protein 2 (VP-2)
encoding gene of AE virus (AEV) from various species of birds in field specimen
by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification using
specific nucleotides primer for confirmation of AE diagnosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 13 AEV samples are isolated from various
species of poultry which are serologically diagnosed infected by AEV from some
areas in central Java, Indonesia. Research stage consists of virus samples
collection from field specimens, extraction of AEV RNA, amplification of VP-2
protein encoding gene by RT-PCR, separation of RT-PCR product by agarose gel
electrophoresis, DNA sequencing and data analysis.
RESULTS: Amplification products of the VP-2 encoding gene of AEV by RT-PCR
methods of various types of poultry from field specimens showed a positive
results on sample code 499/4/12 which generated DNA fragment in the size of 619
bp. Sensitivity test of RT-PCR amplification showed that the minimum
concentration of RNA template is 127.75 ng/µl. The multiple alignments of DNA
sequencing product indicated that positive sample with code 499/4/12 has 92%
nucleotide homology compared with AEV with accession number AV1775/07 and 85%
nucleotide homology with accession number ZCHP2/0912695 from Genbank database.
Analysis of VP-2 gene sequence showed that it found 46 nucleotides difference
between isolate 499/4/12 compared with accession number AV1775/07 and 93
nucleotides different with accession number ZCHP2/0912695.
CONCLUSIONS: Analyses of the VP-2 encoding gene of AEV with RT-PCR method from 13
samples from field specimen generated the DNA fragment in the size of 619 bp from
one sample with sample code 499/4/12. The sensitivity rate of RT-PCR is to
amplify the VP-2 gene of AEV until 127.75 ng/µl of RNA template. Compared to
Genbank databases, isolate 499/4/12 has 85% and 92% nucleotide homology.
