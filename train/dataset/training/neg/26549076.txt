Diagnosis of Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection can be a challenge. The key
to a timely diagnosis is to have a high index of suspicion. We present a rare
case of a 36-year-old human immunodeficiency virus negative male patient, who was
on multidrug therapy for lepromatous leprosy and was treated for type 2 lepra
reactions with steroids in the past. The patient presented with vomiting and pain
abdomen, persistent hyponatremia, and terminal hypoglycemia. He had features of
malnutrition and had a rapid downhill course following admission. A diagnosis of 
S. stercoralis hyperinfection with sepsis and multiorgan failure, adrenal
hemorrhage, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion was
established on a postmortem examination.
