Thirty-three consecutive liver-transplant recipients were prospectively studied
over a 37-mo period for evidence of cytomegalovirus infection. Sixteen (48%)
episodes of cytomegalovirus infection were identified; 9 were primary infections 
and 7 were recurrent infections. Beginning with patient 8, gamma-globulin
prophylaxis was routinely administered to most patients. Twelve potential risk
factors for cytomegalovirus infection were evaluated and included pretransplant
cytomegalovirus serological status of donor and recipient; recipient's age, sex, 
race, and liver disease; number and type of blood products transfused; type and
intensity of immunosuppression; and occurrence of rejection. The Cox proportional
hazards model identified positive donor cytomegalovirus serology as the single
most important risk factor for subsequent development of cytomegalovirus
infection, regardless of recipient cytomegalovirus serological status. In
addition, use of gamma-globulin prophylaxis seemed to be protective against the
occurrence of disseminated cytomegalovirus disease.
