Molecular diagnosis of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) in cervicovaginal samples
reveals a plethora of known and novel HPV genomes. We describe the use of an
overlapping PCR method to clone and analyze the complete genome of HPV 84 from
cervicovaginal cells obtained from a 21-year-old Caucasian female with a normal
Pap smear. The 7948-bp complete nucleotide sequence of HPV 84 was determined from
five overlapping PCR products by sequence walking. A BLAST homology search
demonstrated that HPV 84 was most closely related to HPV 61 (89%), HPV 72 (86%), 
and HPV 83 (85%) by nucleotide sequence analysis of the L1 open reading frame,
placing it in the HPV genome homology group A3. Previously, this virus had been
identified as Pap155. Based on extensive epidemiological data, HPV 84 is a highly
prevalent genital papillomavirus primarily detected in normal and HIV-infected
women.
