The 5' noncoding region of the picornaviral genome begins with a cloverleaf which
is required for viral replication, due at least in part to an interaction with
the viral RNA polymerase as part of a fusion with the predominant viral protease.
The necessary region of the cloverleaf has previously been narrowed to a highly
conserved stem-loop. The solution structure of a 14-nucleotide RNA hairpin, which
is part of the conserved stem-loop from human rhinovirus isotype 14, is presented
here. The secondary structure of the hairpin is identical to predictions: a five 
base pair stem is bounded by a triloop with sequence UAU. However, the fold of
the triloop is novel, with stacking of the second loop base onto the closing base
pair of the stem, and deviations from A form geometry are introduced into the
stem regions bordering the triloop, particularly on the 3' side. These deviations
and the associated triloop structure could help to explain the distinct sequence 
conservation and mutational analysis data observed for the stem region of the
hairpin, as compared to a second sequentially similar stem in the intact
stem-loop.
