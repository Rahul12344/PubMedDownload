Dengue is a tropical vector-borne disease without cure or vaccine that
progressively spreads into regions with temperate climates. Diagnostic tools
amenable to resource-limited settings would be highly valuable for epidemiologic 
control and containment during outbreaks. Here, we present a novel low-cost
automated biosensing platform for detection of dengue fever biomarker NS1 and
demonstrate it on NS1 spiked in human serum. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are
coated with high-affinity monoclonal antibodies against NS1 via bio-orthogonal
Cu-free 'click' chemistry on an anti-fouling surface molecular architecture. The 
presence of the target antigen NS1 triggers MNP agglutination and the formation
of nanoclusters with rapid kinetics enhanced by external magnetic actuation. The 
amount and size of the nanoclusters correlate with the target concentration and
can be quantified using an optomagnetic readout method. The resulting automated
dengue fever assay takes just 8 minutes, requires 6 μL of serum sample and shows 
a limit of detection of 25 ng/mL with an upper detection range of 20000 ng/mL.
The technology holds a great potential to be applied to NS1 detection in patient 
samples. As the assay is implemented on a low-cost microfluidic disc the platform
is suited for further expansion to multiplexed detection of a wide panel of
biomarkers.
