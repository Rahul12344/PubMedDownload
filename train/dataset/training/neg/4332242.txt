The 3'-terminal nucleosides of the high molecular weight RNA of C-type viruses.

Maruyama HB, Hatanaka M, Gilden RV.

Tumor virus RNAs from several mammalian and one reptilian species were purified; 
their 3'-terminal nucleoside was identified by separation of the trialcohols
produced by periodate oxidation followed by reduction and tritiation with
NaB(3)H(4). Each virus contained uridine as the predominant terminal nucleoside. 
Molecular weight estimations based on the tritiation reactions were consistent
with a structure consisting of four subunits.
