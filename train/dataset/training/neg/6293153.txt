Transmission of feline viral rhinotracheitis.

Gaskell RM, Povey RC.

The transmission of feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR) virus was investigated.
Virus could be successfully transmitted between shedding carrier cats and
unrelated susceptible kittens, but only if there was intimate contact between
them. Studies on the transmission of FVR virus from carrier queens to their
kittens showed that although four of 10 queens shed virus in the post partum
period, a total of only four kittens from three litters developed a contact
infection. All four kittens remained asymptomatic. Two shed for one day only and 
did not become carriers (as evidenced by corticosteroid treatment) and two shed
for 15 days and 25 days and were subsequently shown to have become carriers. None
of the remaining kittens tested shed virus. There was no evidence of in utero
transmission between FVR-recovered queens and kittens. Passive antibody titres in
kittens born to FVR-recovered queens declined to less than 1 in 4 in individual
animals by two to 10 weeks of age. Mean titres calculated from a linear
regression equation reached less than 1 in 4 and less than 1 in 2 by six and nine
weeks of age, respectively. Experiments using a multistage liquid impinger
demonstrated that FVR virus was unlikely to be transmitted between cats by
aerosol and this was confirmed by the ability of a sentinel cat to withstand
virus shedding from carriers over a six month period, although housed in the same
air space.
