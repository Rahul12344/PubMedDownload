White Leghorn line C chicks were surgically bursectomised (Bx) in ovo to
eliminate antibody production. After inoculation with infectious bronchitis virus
(IBV) at 14 days after hatching, Bx chicks experienced a more severe and longer
lasting infection than intact chicks. The severity and duration of clinical
infection in the Bx chicks resembled that previously observed in the highly
susceptible line 15I chicks, however no increase in mortality was observed, in
contrast to the high levels of mortality recorded in IBV-inoculated line 15I
chicks. After secondary challenge the degree of damage to the ciliated epithelium
of the trachea was greater in the Bx chicks than in the intact chicks. The
results indicate that, although antibodies play an important role in recovery
from IBV infection, other immunological factor(s) may also be involved.
