Increasingly mechanistic virology studies require dependable and sensitive
methods for isolating purified organelles containing functional cellular
sub-domains. The mitochondrial network is, in part, closely apposed to the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) fraction
provides direct physical contact between the ER and mitochondria.
Characterization of the dual localization and trafficking of human
cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL37 proteins required establishing protocols in which the
ER and mitochondria could be reliably separated. Because of its documented role
in lipid and ceramide transfer from the ER to mitochondria, a method to purify
MAM from infected cells was also developed. Two robust procedures were developed 
to efficiently isolate mitochondria, ER, and MAM fractions while providing
substantial protein yields from HCMV-infected primary fibroblasts and from
transfected HeLa cells. Furthermore, this unit includes protocols for isolation
of detergent resistant membranes from subcellular fractions as well as techniques
that allow visualization of the mitochondrial network disruption that occurs in
permissively infected cells by their optimal resolution in Percoll gradients.
