Mycoplasma pneumonia: a study on hospitalized American patients with pneumonia in
Vietnam.

Arnold K, Kilbridge TM, Miller WC Jr, Smith TJ, Cutting RT.

A prospective study on consecutively hospitalized pneumonia patients showed that 
41.5% of 58 patients had a fourfold rise in the complement-fixation titer for
Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Viral isolation techniques and serologic tests for
influenza A1, A2 and B, parainfluenza 1 and 3, respiratory syncytial virus and
the adeno virus group yielded only a single positive isolate for influenza A2.
Serologic tests for melioidosis, leptospirosis, scrub, murine and epidemic typhus
and psittacosis were all negative. The clinical manifestations were not
distinctive for the positive M. pneumoniae patients when compared with the
patients having a negative M. pneumoniae complement-fixation test. The symptoms
and signs and laboratory and radiologic findings were similar to those described 
in other reports on primary atypical pneumonia.
