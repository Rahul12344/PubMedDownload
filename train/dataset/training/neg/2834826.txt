The human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) types I and II have two nonstructural
genes that are encoded in overlapping reading frames. One of these genes, known
as tax, has been shown to encode a protein responsible for enhanced transcription
(transactivation) from the viral long terminal repeats (LTRs). Genetic evidence
indicates that the second nonstructural gene of HTLV-II, here designated rex,
acts in trans to modulate tax gene-mediated transactivation in a
concentration-dependent fashion. The rex gene may regulate the process of
transactivation during the viral life cycle.
