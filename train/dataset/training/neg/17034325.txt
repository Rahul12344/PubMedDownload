The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to examine how personality traits
such as sensation- seeking and impulsive decision-making affect Taiwanese college
students' intentions to seek online information about sexually transmitted
diseases (STDs) and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Five hundred thirty-five (n = 535) junior and senior college
students in Taiwan were recruited and completed self-report questionnaires. This 
study found high sensation-seekers were more likely to seek information about
STDs and HIV/AIDS on the Internet than low sensation-seekers. Impulsive
decision-makers were less likely than rational decision-makers to seek
information about STDs and HIV/AIDS on the Internet. These findings suggest that 
personality needs to be considered as an exploratory factor which potentially
influences intentions to seek STD and HIV/AIDS information on the Internet among 
Taiwanese college students.
