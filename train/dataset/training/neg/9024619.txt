BACKGROUND: Although profilin is believed to be an essential regulator of the
actin cytoskeleton in most cells, its precise role in mammalian cells remains
unknown. We have used replication-incompetent adenovirus carrying the human
profilin I cDNA as a means rapidly to increase the concentration of profilin in
human aortic endothelial cells 12-31-fold above baseline--levels never before
achieved in mammalian cells.
RESULTS: The concentration of filamentous actin was not detectably affected by
profilin overexpression. Actin stress fibers were, however, absent from areas of 
high profilin content in overexpressing cells, and the bulk of filaments was
located at the periphery of the cells. We observed a gradient in the distribution
of overexpressed profilin in migrating endothelial cells, with most profilin
molecules concentrated near the advancing edge where focal contacts are being
formed and focal adhesion proteins are located. Profilin overexpression resulted 
in increased recruitment of fibronectin receptors to the plasma membrane.
Adhesion of endothelial cells to fibronectin was markedly and selectively
increased by profilin overexpression.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that an important role for profilin in mammalian cells
may be its contribution to the formation of focal contacts, particularly those
involving the fibronectin receptor.
