BACKGROUND: Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is an important cause of
acute respiratory infection (ARI) and mortality in ≥60 years old population
around the world. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and
circulating genotypes of HRSV in Iranian patients ≥ 60 years old.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional molecular epidemiology study, we examined the
C-terminal located hypervariable domain of G glycoprotein of HRSV in throat swabs
from Tehran, Hormozgan, Boushehr, West Azarbayjan, Ghom and Alborz provinces of
Iran which were addressed to national influenza center between October 2013 and
March 2015. During these two consecutive years, a total of 225 samples collected 
from patients older than 60 years were tested using RT hemi-nested PCR and
sequencing and the acquired sequences were phylogenetically analyzed.
RESULTS: Sixteen out of 225 samples (7.1%) yielded a positive result. Among the
positive samples, 13 cases (81%) pertained to antigenic group A and the remaining
3 cases (19%) belonged to group B. Three genotypes including GA1, GA2 and BA9
were identified in the first year of survey whereas during the second year, only 
GA1 and GA2 genotypes were detected.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that HRSV genotypes from both A and B antigenic
groups which were discovered in pediatric population previously, are circulating 
among Iranian ≥60 years old population.
