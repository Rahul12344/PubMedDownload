In baby mice born to mothers--virus carriers (surviving for various periods after
intranasal administration of influenza virus), infectious persisting influenza
virus in titres of 10(0.5) to 10(2.5) EID50/0.1 ml was found in the blood, lungs,
livers, kidneys, spleens, and brains. Not infrequently, such animals developed a 
severe pathological process accompanied by growth retardation and characterized
by progressive involvement of the hypothalamus, immunocompetent organs, endocrine
system and always terminating by the death of the animals. Possible mechanisms of
the described slow form of influenza infection are discussed.
