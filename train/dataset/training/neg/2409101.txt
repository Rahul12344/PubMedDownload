Experimental in ovo transmission of duck hepatitis B virus.

Inoculation of fertile Pekin duck eggs with diluted serum containing DHBV into
eggs incubated for 24 h and into the extra-embryonic cavities of 14-day-old
embryos resulted in a high proportion of viraemic ducklings irrespective of the
route of inoculation. Long-term observation of som of the ducks established that 
the viraemia induced experimentally is long-lasting and has persisted for periods
up to 16 mth post-hatch. Separation of DHBV from the plasma of carrier ducks by
rate zonal centrifugation was examined by DNA polymerase (DNAP) activity.
Particles in the fraction with peak DNAP activity had a buoyant density of 1.16 g
X cm-3 in sucrose and an estimated sedimentation coefficient, S20.w of 77. DHBV
particles, the morphology of which could be resolved under the electron
microscope, consisted of a coat (about 10 nm in thickness) surrounding a core
with a diameter measuring 40 nm but not 27 nm as previously reported. Spike-like 
projections were found on the surface of the core as described previously by W.S.
