The 3A region of foot-and-mouth disease virus has been implicated in host range
and virulence. For example, amino acid deletions in the porcinophilic strain
(O/TAW/97) at 93-102aa of the 153 codons long 3A protein have been recognized as 
the determinant of species specificity. In the present study, 18 type O FMDV
isolates from India were adapted in different cell culture systems and the 3A
sequence was analyzed. These isolates had complete 3A coding sequence (153aa) and
did not exhibit growth restriction in cells based on species of origin. The 3A
region was found to be highly conserved at N-terminal half (1-75aa) but exhibited
variability or substitutions towards C-terminal region (80-153). Moreover the
amino acid substitutions were more frequent in recent Indian buffalo isolates but
none of the Indian isolates showed deletion in 3A protein, which may be the
reason for the absence of host specificity in vitro. Further inclusive analysis
of 3A region will reveal interesting facts about the variability of FMD virus 3A 
region in an endemic environment.
