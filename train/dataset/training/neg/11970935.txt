In order to analyse trends in the bronchiolitis hospitalisations in the
Netherlands from 1991 to 1999 for children aged 0-4 years, the national number of
bronchiolitis hospitalisations were compared with those of asthma and pneumonia
hospitalisations of the same age group. The number of bronchiolitis
hospitalisations significantly increased, whereas the number of asthma and
pneumonia hospitalisations remained unchanged.
