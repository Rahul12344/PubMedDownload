The association of simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA or plasmid DNA in subcellular
fractions from either infected or transfected cells was examined. In lytically
infected cells, approx. 25% of viral specific DNA during the infection cycle was 
retained in nuclei after washing with low ionic strength buffer and 1% Triton
X-100. Viral replicating DNA found in the nuclear matrix was capable of
performing limited DNA synthesis by the endogenous DNA polymerase in vitro. Viral
DNA synthesized in vitro hybridized preferentially to SV40 Hind-III B and C
fragments which are in proximity to the origin of replication. In
plasmid-transfected COS-7 cells (SV40-transformed cells), the amount of plasmid
DNA found in the nuclear matrix was related to its replication efficiency in
cells. More than 80% of the plasmid DNA was tightly associated with subnuclear
structures. Little or no plasmid DNA was found in the cytoplasmic fraction. The
results suggest that, in extrachromosomal model systems, the association of DNA
with nuclear matrix is important for the regulation of DNA replication.
