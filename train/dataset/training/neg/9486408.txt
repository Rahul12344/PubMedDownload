Caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE) is a lentiviral infection of goats
characterized by mononuclear cell infiltration of various tissues, most
prominently the joints, mammary glands and, in young animals, the brain. We have 
investigated the early stages of arthritis induced by intracarpal and intravenous
infection with molecularly cloned CAE virus. Analysis of the synovial membranes
by immunohistological methods showed that the proportion of CD8+ T cells peaked
around day 12 post-infection. CD4+ T cells increased to a lesser degree. The
relative proportion of B cells rose steadily post-infection. At 33 days
post-infection, plasma cells accounted for over one third of all inflammatory
cells in the inflamed synovium. Histopathologically, the arthritic lesions in the
synovial membranes closely resembled those in membranes of animals with a 2-year 
history of chronic arthritis. Our observations indicate that this type of
short-term experimental infection is particularly suitable for studying the
pathogenesis of goat lentiviral infection. In addition, our observations support 
the view that a predominantly humoral (type 2) immune response may contribute to 
the pathogenesis of CAE.
