BACKGROUND: Unbiased deep sequencing offers the potential for improved
adventitious virus screening in vaccines and biotherapeutics. Successful
implementation of such assays will require appropriate control materials to
confirm assay performance and sensitivity.
METHODS: A common reference material containing 25 target viruses was produced
and 16 laboratories were invited to process it using their preferred adventitious
virus detection assay.
RESULTS: Fifteen laboratories returned results, obtained using a wide range of
wet-lab and informatics methods. Six of 25 target viruses were detected by all
laboratories, with the remaining viruses detected by 4-14 laboratories. Six
non-target viruses were detected by three or more laboratories.
CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that a wide range of methods are currently
used for adventitious virus detection screening in biological products by deep
sequencing and that they can yield significantly different results. This
underscores the need for common reference materials to ensure satisfactory assay 
performance and enable comparisons between laboratories.
