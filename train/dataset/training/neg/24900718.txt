A series of 2-hydroxy-1,3-dioxoisoquinoline-4-carboxamides featuring an
N-hydroxyimide chelating functionality was evaluated for their inhibitory
properties against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 integrase (HIV-1 IN).
Several derivatives displayed low nanomolar IC50 values comparable to that of the
clinically used raltegravir. A marked effect of one compound on both primary
IN-catalyzed reactions, strand transfer (ST), and 3' processing (3'-P),
emphasizes a novel IN inhibition mechanism establishing it as a potential new
generation IN inhibitor. Substitution of the 2-hydroxyisoquinoline-1,3-dione
scaffold at position 4 by carboxamido chains was beneficial for antiviral
activity since reproducible low micromolar anti-HIV activities were obtained for 
the first time within this scaffold.
