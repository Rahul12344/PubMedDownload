OBJECTIVE: To explore whether or not HBx protein can induce
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in liver cancer cell SMMC-7721.
METHODS: A recombinant adenovirus vector containing HBx gene was constructed and 
introduced into SMMC-7721 cell. The morphological changes were observed. The
expression changes of epithelial and mesenchymal markers were investigated by
RT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Invasive and metastatic capacity
of transfected SMMC-7721 cell was evaluated through transwell migration assay.
RESULTS: The recombinant adenovirus vector containing HBx gene was constructed
and transfected successfully into SMMC-7721 cell. At Day 7 post-transfection, the
transfected SMMC-7721 cell underwent the morphological change from a classic
epithelial morphology to a spindle-like shape. In addition, the HBx protein
significantly increased the expressions of N-cadherin, vimentin and fibronectin, 
but decreased the expressions of E-cadherin and alpha-catenin in SMMC-7721 cell. 
The cellular invasion assay indicated that transfection of HBx drastically
enhanced the invasive potential of SMMC-7721 cell.
CONCLUSION: HBx protein may induce EMT and enhance the invasive potential of
SMMC-7721 cell.
