We present the second confirmed report of HSV laryngitis in an adult stroke
patient, resulting in complicated airway management issues. This rare
presentation of laryngeal HSV in a stroke patient can interfere with speech,
language, and swallowing functions and confounds the etiology of these issues,
which can impact subsequent management.
