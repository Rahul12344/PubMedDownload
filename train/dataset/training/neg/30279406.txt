Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most common viruses
infecting the respiratory tracts of infants. The rapid and sensitive detection of
RSV is important to minimize the incidence of infection. In this study, novel
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; B11A5 and E8A11) against RSV nucleoprotein (NP) were
developed and applied to develop a rapid fluorescent immunochromatographic strip 
test (FICT), employing europium nanoparticles as the fluorescent material. For
the FICT, the limits of detection of the antigen and virus were 1.25 µg/mL and
4.23 × 10⁶ TCID50/mL, respectively, corresponding to 4.75 × 10⁶ ± 5.8 ×10⁵ (mean 
± SD) RNA copy numbers per reaction mixture for RSV NP. A clinical study revealed
a sensitivity of 90% (18/20) and specificity of 98.18% (108/110) for RSV
detection when comparing the performance to that of reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), representing a 15% improvement in sensitivity
over the SD Bioline rapid kit. This newly developed FICT could be a useful tool
for the rapid diagnosis of RSV infection.
