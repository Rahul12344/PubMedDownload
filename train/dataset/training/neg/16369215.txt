than routine.

Liver biopsy has historically played a central role in the diagnosis and
management of a variety of chronic liver diseases. However, as the understanding 
of disease pathology has progressed, and laboratory diagnostics, imaging
technology, and clinical algorithms to determine both the etiology and presence
of fibrosis have advanced, the role of liver biopsy has become more
circumscribed. In chronic liver disease, liver biopsy is now more often used
selectively, rather than routinely, for diagnostic purposes. Newer treatment of
chronic hepatitis B and C has become more effective and thus reduced the routine 
need to acquire tissue. Risk factors for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are
readily identified and suggest the diagnosis after exclusion of alternative
considerations, and there is no specific treatment for this condition; thus there
is little role for the routine use of liver biopsy to guide treatment. Only in
select cases of chronic hepatitis C, especially in patients with genotype 1, an
indeterminate stage and grade of disease on noninvasive evaluation, or in those
with human immunodeficiency virus coinfection, for whom the risks and benefits of
treatment are less clear, is there a role for routine pretreatment biopsy.
