BACKGROUND: The aim was to report our experience of BK viremia surveillance after
kidney transplant during a period of change from cyclosporine (CyA)-to lower-dose
tacrolimus (Tac)-based primary immunosuppression regimens.
METHODS: In a prospective single-center observational cohort study, 68
consecutive patients received renal transplant during the period when we used a
CyA-based primary immunosuppression regimen and 66 after we changed to a
lower-dose Tac-based regimen. Testing for BK viremia by quantitative polymerase
chain reaction assay was performed at least monthly for a minimum of 1 year.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine (29.1%) patients developed BK viremia and 2 (1.5%) developed
BK nephropathy. The actuarial time to BK viremia was shorter in patients
receiving CyA/mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)/prednisolone (Pred) compared with
Tac/MMF/Pred (P=0.04) and primary immunosuppression with CyA/MMF/Pred was the
only independent predictor of BK viremia (hazard ratio 1.95; P=0.047). Comparing 
patients who experienced BK viremia and those who did not, there was no
difference in incidence of acute rejection (20.5% vs. 25.3%; P=0.56) or estimated
glomerular filtration rate at 12 months (48.8 vs. 49.9 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), but the
incidence of ureteric stenosis was higher (10.3% vs. 1.1%; P=0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate a lower incidence of BK viremia in patients on 
lower-dose Tac compared with CyA-based primary immunosuppression in contrast to
previous studies, and provide further support for the association between BK
virus and ureteric complications.
