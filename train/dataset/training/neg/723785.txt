The use of a measles latex reagent for the determination of measles antibodies
and in a specific test for multiple sclerosis.

Wild TF, Quash G, Warocquier R, Cathala F, Huppert J.

Measles virus antigens covalently linked to latex spheres were used for measuring
measles-specific antibodies in a direct agglutination test either in microtitre
plates or as a rapid slide-agglutination test. The titres were compared to that
obtained by conventional assays. The measles-latex spheres were also used as the 
antigen for a radio-immuno assay. By incorporating a 14C-radioactive marker into 
the measles-latex spheres their interaction with lymphocytes from multiple
sclerosis and control patients was determined. Lymphocytes from multiple
sclerosis patients reacted with a higher percentage of beads at low
bead/lymphocyte ratios compared with controls, whereas the reverse was found when
the ratio of beads was increased.
