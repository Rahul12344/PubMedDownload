Epitope mapping of the outer structural protein VP1 of three different serotypes 
of foot-and-mouth disease virus.

Meloen RH, Barteling SJ.

All overlapping hexapeptides of the outer structural protein VP1 of type O1, type
A10, and type C1 were reacted with the appropriate anti-virus, anti-viral subunit
and anti-VP1 sera. The results suggest that anti-virus sera may contain
activities against viral subunit and VP1 as well as against virus. Furthermore
the antigenic peptides associated with the intact virion of all three serotypes
are found at similar locations on their respective VP1s, and produced
neutralizing activities when used for vaccination. The results further offer an
explanation for the often observed cross-reactions between serotypes, especially 
at the level of the viral subunit and VP1. The reliability of predictions of
useful peptides from hydrophilicity profiles and secondary structure predictions 
is questioned. Predictions based on variation profiles appear to be more useful.
