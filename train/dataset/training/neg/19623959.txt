OBJECTIVE: Purified avian influenza virus (AIV) hemagglutinin (HA) gene fragment 
was inserted into green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression vector, pEGFP-C1.
The role of signal peptide in the HA-GFP expression in 293T cells was
investigated by cutting the signal peptide or placing it in different locations
of HA-GFP fusion gene.
METHODS: The expression of GFP in 293T cells was examined directly with
fluorescence microscope and flow cytometry analysis.
RESULTS: After transfected with pEGFP-C1, M1, M2 and M3 plasmid, under
fluorescent microscope the HA-GFP fusion protein was successfully expressed.
Fluorescence was seen homogeneously distributed in the entire cell body of the
cells transfected by the empty vector pEGFP-C1, whereas signal peptide could
obviously reduced the expression of GFP-HA compared with recombinant plasmid
without signal peptide. In addition, we found that there was no significant
effect of the location of signal peptide on the expression of HA-GFP fusion
protein.
