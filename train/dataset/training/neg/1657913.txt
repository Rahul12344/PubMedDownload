A vaccinia virus open reading frame (ORF) previously predicted to encode
thymidylate kinase (TmpK) is shown to encode an active enzyme. A copy of the ORF,
generated by polymerase chain reaction, was cloned into an Escherichia coli
inducible expression vector. Cell extracts of E. coli expressing the vaccinia
gene contained high levels of TmpK activity, whereas extracts of cells without
the TmpK gene did not. The vaccinia ORF expressed from a yeast vector
complemented a Saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc8 mutant, demonstrating functional
compatibility of the vaccinia virus and yeast TmpK enzymes. The gene is shown to 
be nonessential for the replication of vaccinia virus in cultured cells by the
construction of a viable virus mutant that has the coding region of the TmpK gene
interrupted by the Ecogpt gene. Synthesis of the vaccinia TmpK protein in
infected cells was demonstrated by the use of a polyvalent rabbit antiserum
raised against the purified TmpK enzyme expressed in E. coli to immunoprecipitate
a 23-kDa early polypeptide from cells infected with wild type vaccinia but not
from cells infected with the TmpK mutant. Plasmid vectors that allow the
construction of recombinant viruses expressing foreign gene(s) from the
nonessential TmpK locus are described.
