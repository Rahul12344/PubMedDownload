DNA replication and chromatin structure of simian virus 40 insertion mutants.

Innis JW, Scott WA.

Insertion of DNA segments into the nuclease-sensitive region of simian virus 40
alters both replication efficiency and chromatin structure. Mutants containing
large insertions between the simian virus 40 origin of replication (ori site) and
the 21-base-pair repeated sequences replicated poorly when assayed by
transfection into COS-1 cells. Replication of mutants with shorter insertions was
moderately reduced. This effect was cis-acting and independent of the nucleotide 
sequence of the insert. The nuclease-sensitive chromatin structure was retained
in these mutants, but the pattern of cleavage sites was displaced in the late
direction from the ori site. New cleavage sites appeared within the inserted
sequences, suggesting that information specifying the nuclease-sensitive
chromatin structure is located on the late side of the inserts. Accessibility to 
BglI (which cleaves within the ori site) was reduced in the larger insertion
mutants. These results support the conclusion that efficient function of the
viral origin of replication is correlated with its proximity to an altered
chromatin structure.
