A number of birnaviruses, rhabdoviruses and a reovirus have been isolated from
occasional fish affected with the epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS) in the past
decade. The heterogeneous nature of these isolates, together with a low and
inconsistent level of recovery from diseases specimens, suggests that these
viruses may only represent adventitious infections unrelated to outbreaks of EUS.
Furthermore, experimental induction of the condition by direct exposure to cell
culture isolated viruses has not been achieved. The significance, if any, of
C-type retroviruses identified in cell cultures derived from EUS-susceptible fish
species is not known.
