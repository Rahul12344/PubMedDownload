Training IEC / AIDS activity organizers in schools in Yaounde.

Medang R.

PIP: 4300 pupils who attend six schools in Yaounde, Cameroon, have been reached
in a pilot project funded by GTZ. The IEC/AIDS project, "Promotion and Support in
the Popular Economy Sector," is ending after being in place for a year and a
half. The active participation of the target population, the school children, was
required to channel human resources in the proper direction. To do this
effectively made the support of an external structure, which could intervene
through organizers or leaders, necessary. Two groups were identified: 1) those
external to the school community, the activity organizers; and 2) the school
leaders who were selected from the students based on their leadership abilities
(organizing groups, clubs, associations). The former group organized activities
and consolidated information, education, and communication (IEC) action in the
field. Their training emphasized the psychological aspects of children and
covered group dynamics, organizing techniques, methodological and psychological
approaches, the psychology of adolescents and young people, and basic information
about acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The latter group received
training in techniques for passing on information (the role of a leader), group
dynamics, the importance of participation by young people in the fight against
AIDS, and basic information about AIDS.
