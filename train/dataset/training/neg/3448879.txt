Complementation of two temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of adenovirus type 5
was attempted with tumour extract in HEp-2 cell cultures at permissive and
restrictive temperature. Both ts mutants were successfully complemented with
adenovirus gene products extracted from bladder and kidney carcinoma cells. The
percentage incidence of complementation appeared to be higher with extracts
obtained from female patients than with those obtained from males. The same gene 
sequences may occur in penile carcinoma cells and in bladder carcinoma cells
showing the early signs of malignization. Extracts of seminoma cells and of cells
from prostatic hypertrophies contained adenovirus genes less frequently;
infectious virus was never obtained from them. The same applies to cells from the
non-tumourous ("control") patients tested. The old age of the patients and some
properties of the tumours examined suggest that hormonal changes may contribute
to adenovirus gene expression and, indirectly, to the malignant process and its
continuity.
