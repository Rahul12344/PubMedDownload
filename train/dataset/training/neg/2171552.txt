Glucocorticoid hormones stimulate transcription of the mouse mammary tumor virus 
(MMTV) promoter by means of an interaction of the hormone receptor with a set of 
upstream DNA-binding sites called the hormone-responsive element (HRE). In an
attempt to understand the underlying molecular mechanism, we have analyzed the
influence of receptor binding on the topological state of plasmids carrying
different parts of the HRE. Incubation of negatively supercoiled plasmids
containing the intact HRE with the 94-kD purified glucocorticoid receptor,
followed by extensive digestion with topoisomerase I, leads to a distribution of 
topoisomers shifted by two turns toward positively supercoiled circles. If
relaxed plasmids are incubated with receptor and treated with topoisomerase I,
the average linking number of the resulting distribution of topoisomers is also
increased by two with respect to the controls. This effect depends on the
presence of an intact HRE and is almost undetectable with the 40-kD form of the
receptor. Thus, binding of the hormone receptor to functional DNA regulatory
sites located in closed circular plasmids results in a topological change that
could be related to the hormonal activation of transcription.
