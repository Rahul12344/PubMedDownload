The spoVH locus, involved in the sporulation of Bacillus subtilis, was cloned in 
derivatives of the temperate bacteriophage luminal diameter 105. Two recombinant 
phages were obtained which contained 4.2 kilobases of chromosomal DNA. Both
phages only partially complemented a mutation in the spoVH operon, spoVH516.
Nevertheless, analysis of the cloned locus with integrational plasmids showed
that the complete operon had been cloned. A spoVH'-lacZ transcriptional fusion
was constructed, and this indicated that the spoVH operon was expressed 2.25 h
after the start of sporulation. The distribution of beta-galactosidase in
sporulating cells containing a spoVH'-lacZ fusion showed that spoVH was expressed
in the spore compartment; lac fusion experiments were also used to study spoVH
expression in the presence of other sporulation mutations. Expression of spoVH
was prevented by mutations in any of the stage 0 or stage II loci and also by
mutations in spoIIIA, spoIIIB, and spoIIIE. A similar pattern of dependence was
found previously for the expression of spoVA, which is also expressed in the
spore compartment.
