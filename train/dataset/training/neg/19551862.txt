Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) was recently discovered in Merkel cell carcinoma
(MCC), a clinically and pathologically heterogeneous malignancy of dermal
neuroendocrine cells. To investigate this heterogeneity, we developed a tissue
microarray (TMA) to characterize immunohistochemical staining of candidate tumor 
cell proteins and a quantitative PCR assay to detect MCPyV and measure viral
loads. MCPyV was detected in 19 of 23 (74%) primary MCC tumors, but 8 of these
had less than 1 viral copy per 300 cells. Viral abundance of 0.06-1.2 viral
copies/cell was directly related to presence of retinoblastoma gene product (pRb)
and terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (TdT) by immunohistochemical
staining (p < or = 0.003). Higher viral abundance tumors tended to be associated 
with less p53 expression, younger age at diagnosis and longer survival (p < or = 
0.08). These data suggest that MCC may arise through different oncogenic
pathways, including ones independent of pRb and MCPyV.
