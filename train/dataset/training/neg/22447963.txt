RATIONALE: HIV-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is likely a more 
prevalent noninfectious complication of AIDS than previously recognized.
Furthermore, the majority of HIV-PAH cases occur in individuals with a history of
intravenous drug use. In this study we used a simian immunodeficiency (SIV)
macaque model and a primary cell-culture system to investigate the association
between drug abuse and HIV infection in HIV-PAH development.
METHODS: The archival lung tissues from macaques previously used to study the
effect of morphine on SIV infection-associated neuropathogenesis were analyzed
for pulmonary vascular changes. The direct effect of HIV proteins and illicit
drugs was investigated on oxidative stress, survival, and proliferation of human 
pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: SIVmacR71/17E-infected rhesus macaques treated
with morphine (VM group) demonstrated significant pulmonary vascular remodeling, 
including the presence of early and advanced complex (plexiform) lesions, when
compared with either the SIV-infected (V group) or morphine-treated uninfected (M
group) macaques. However, both the V (two of five) and VM (two of six) groups
included some animals with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. The endothelial
cells lining the vessels with medial hypertrophy or initial-stage intimal lesions
in lung sections from VM macaques demonstrated an increase in positivity for both
terminal dUTP nick-end labeling and Ki67. Oxidative stress-mediated enhanced
apoptosis followed by enhanced proliferation of endothelial cells was observed on
simultaneous treatment with viral proteins and drugs of abuse compared with
either treatment alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that SIV/HIV protein(s) and morphine interact
to cause the proliferation of apoptosis-resistant endothelial cells leading to
angio-obliteration.
