Rotavirus gastroenteritis is a major cause of severe dehydrating diarrhea in
children worldwide. Group A rotavirus causes approximately 40% of hospitalization
for diarrhea among under 5 years children. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE) and silver staining was applied to detect rotavirus dsRNA from acute
diarrheic stool of 776 hospitalized children below five years. The study was
conducted in Mymensingh district, Bangladesh from January 2013 to December 2014. 
Among 776 stool specimens tested 368(47.4%) were positive by PAGE. Among 368
positive 341(92.5%) showed clearly stained electrophoretic patterns of viral RNA 
which enabled their classification into different electropherotypes. The rate of 
infection was highest in children of 7-12 months of age and infection rate was
more in winter. RNA profiles of the analyzed specimens, 164/341 (48%) were long
and 177/341 (52%) were short patterns. Mixed electropherotypes (2%) among 368
were also detected. Electropherotyping technique could be an applied excellent
method for studying genomic variation, tracing mixed infections, detecting
atypical rotaviruses.
