Temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation time of proton in the
rotating frame (T1rho(H)) was examined for the membranes of the intact PM2 phage,
its host bacterial cells, and the phospholipids extracted from the cells. The
relevant motions of the phospholipid molecules in all lipid membranes were found 
in the fast-motional regime (tauc < 1.7 x 10(-6) s) in the temperature range from
0 to 34 degrees C. The motions responsible for the relaxation in the intact
biomembranes are more suppressed than those of the extracted phospholipid
bilayers, suggesting that the lipid-protein interactions induce slow motions of
the phospholipids in the membrane. Especially, the membrane of the intact PM2
phage showed a cooperative change in the motional state, being consistent with
the reported change in the phosphorus chemical shift anisotropies of DNA and
phospholipids of the phage particle.
