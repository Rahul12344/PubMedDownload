Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a recently recognized viral zoonosis. The 
first recognized cases were caused by a newly described hantavirus. Sin Nombre
virus (previously known as Muerto Canyon virus), isolated from Peromyscus
maniculatus (deer mouse). We describe a 33-year-old Floridian man who resided
outside the ecologic range of P maniculatus but was found to have serologic
evidence of a hantavirus infection during evaluation of azotemia associated with 
adult respiratory distress syndrome. Small mammal trapping conducted around this 
patient's residence demonstrated the presence of antihantaviral antibodies in 13%
of Sigmodon hispidus [cotton rat). Serologic testing using antigen derived from
the Black Creek Canal hantavirus subsequently isolated from this rodent
established that this patient was acutely infected with this new pathogenic
American hantavirus. HPS is not confined to the geographical distribution of P
maniculatus and should be suspected in individuals with febrile respiratory
syndromes, perhaps associated with azotemia, throughout the continental United
States.
