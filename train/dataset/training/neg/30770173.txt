Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a known biological defense threat.
A live-attenuated investigational vaccine, TC-83, is available, but it has a high
non-response rate and can also cause severe reactogenicity. We generated two
novel VEE vaccine candidates using self-amplifying mRNA (SAM). LAV-CNE is a
live-attenuated VEE SAM vaccine formulated with synthetic cationic nanoemulsion
(CNE) and carrying the RNA genome of TC-83. IAV-CNE is an irreversibly-attenuated
VEE SAM vaccine formulated with CNE, delivering a TC-83 genome lacking the capsid
gene. LAV-CNE launches a TC-83 infection cycle in vaccinated subjects but
eliminates the need for live-attenuated vaccine production and potentially
reduces manufacturing time and complexity. IAV-CNE produces a single cycle of RNA
amplification and antigen expression without generating infectious viruses in
subjects, thereby creating a potentially safer alternative to live-attenuated
vaccine. Here, we demonstrated that mice vaccinated with LAV-CNE elicited immune 
responses similar to those of TC-83, providing 100% protection against aerosol
VEEV challenge. IAV-CNE was also immunogenic, resulting in significant protection
against VEEV challenge. These studies demonstrate the proof of concept for using 
the SAM platform to streamline the development of effective attenuated vaccines
against VEEV and closely related alphavirus pathogens such as western and eastern
equine encephalitis and Chikungunya viruses.
