The ≥ 10³⁰ bacteriophages on Earth relentlessly drive adaptive coevolution,
forcing the generation of protective mechanisms in their bacterial hosts. One
such bacterial phage-resistance system, ToxIN, consists of a protein toxin (ToxN)
that is inhibited in vivo by a specific RNA antitoxin (ToxI); however, the
mechanisms for this toxicity and inhibition have not been defined. Here we
present the crystal structure of the ToxN-ToxI complex from Pectobacterium
atrosepticum, determined to 2.75-Å resolution. ToxI is a 36-nucleotide noncoding 
RNA pseudoknot, and three ToxI monomers bind to three ToxN monomers to generate a
trimeric ToxN-ToxI complex. Assembly of this complex is mediated entirely through
extensive RNA-protein interactions. Furthermore, a 2'-3' cyclic phosphate at the 
3' end of ToxI, and catalytic residues, identify ToxN as an endoRNase that
processes ToxI from a repetitive precursor but is regulated by its own catalytic 
product.
