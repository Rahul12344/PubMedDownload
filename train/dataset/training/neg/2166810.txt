The mechanism by which bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) predisposes cattle to
bacterial pneumonia was investigated by using an in vitro system to demonstrate
immunosuppression. At a multiplicity of infection of 0.001, live or inactivated
BHV-1 induced a 50% inhibition of the proliferative response of peripheral blood 
mononuclear leukocytes to antigen (vaccinia virus in vaccinia virus-immunized
cattle which were BHV-1 negative) or interleukin-2. At this same multiplicity of 
infection, the mitogen-induced proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear
leukocytes was unaffected. This inhibition of antigen and interleukin-2-induced
proliferative responses could not be reversed by the addition of excess amounts
of interleukin-2 and could not be prevented by the addition of indomethacin to
block prostaglandin production. Antibodies to BHV-1, especially those specific
for glycoproteins gI and gIV, were able to block the inhibitory effect of BHV-1
in these in vitro assays. These results showed that antibody to BHV-1 blocks the 
immunosuppressive effect of the virus in vitro and suggested that an appropriate 
antibody response to BHV-1 could protect cattle from virus-induced
immunosuppression leading to secondary bacterial pneumonia.
