The cultivation technique of two mycobacteriophages (D-29 and MyF2 P/59) in
continuous cultures with a simple synthetic medium is described. The
ATCC-607-strain (M. smegmatis) was used as a host strain. The medium was
exchanged every 24 hours for 14 days, then the whole cultivation equipment
including waste bottle was hermetically closed and preserved in a thermostat for 
seven years. Every six months about 250 ml of new liquid medium was added into
the cultivation container after finishing the passage cultivation. Both
mycobacteriophages could be found out still after 6 years in the mixture of the
mycobacteriophages preserved in the waste bottle and in the culture container
even after seven years. The possibility of using the technique of continuous
cultivation of phages for preparing fresh 24 hours old suspensions necessary for 
phage typing of the mycobacteria is discussed.
