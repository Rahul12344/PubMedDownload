While cell surface antigens represent the most common targets for antibody-based 
cancer therapy, isolation of new antibodies specific for these targets from
single-chain Fv phage display libraries has been hindered by limitations
associated with traditional selection techniques. Solid phase panning is often
associated with conformational changes to the target protein due to its
immobilization on plastic tubes that can limit the ability of the isolated scFv
to bind to conformational epitopes and solution panning methods require the use
of secondary tags that often mask desired sequences and create unintended
epitopes. Commonly utilized cell-based panning methods typically yield a panel of
single-chain Fv (scFv) molecules that are specific for numerous cell surface
antigens, often obscuring the desired clones. Here, we describe a novel cell
sorter-based system to isolate single-chain Fv molecules specific for defined
antigen targets expressed on stably-transformed mammalian cells. We employed
these methods to isolate promising scFv clones that bind specifically to the
MÃ¼llerian inhibiting substance type II receptor, a cell surface ovarian cancer
antigen that has proven to be a difficult target for selection strategies.
