Bats harbor a large diversity of coronaviruses (CoVs), several of which are
related to zoonotic pathogens that cause severe disease in humans. Our screening 
of bat samples collected in Kenya from 2007 to 2010 not only detected RNA from
several novel CoVs but, more significantly, identified sequences that were
closely related to human CoVs NL63 and 229E, suggesting that these two human
viruses originate from bats. We also demonstrated that human CoV NL63 is a
recombinant between NL63-like viruses circulating in Triaenops bats and 229E-like
viruses circulating in Hipposideros bats, with the breakpoint located near 5' and
3' ends of the spike (S) protein gene. In addition, two further interspecies
recombination events involving the S gene were identified, suggesting that this
region may represent a recombination "hot spot" in CoV genomes. Finally, using a 
combination of phylogenetic and distance-based approaches, we showed that the
genetic diversity of bat CoVs is primarily structured by host species and
subsequently by geographic distances.IMPORTANCE Understanding the driving forces 
of cross-species virus transmission is central to understanding the nature of
disease emergence. Previous studies have demonstrated that bats are the ultimate 
reservoir hosts for a number of coronaviruses (CoVs), including ancestors of
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E). However, the
evolutionary pathways of bat CoVs remain elusive. We provide evidence for natural
recombination between distantly related African bat coronaviruses associated with
Triaenops afer and Hipposideros sp. bats that resulted in a NL63-like virus, an
ancestor of the human pathogen HCoV-NL63. These results suggest that interspecies
recombination may play an important role in CoV evolution and the emergence of
novel CoVs with zoonotic potential.
