Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an emerging virus of medical importance. A majority of
HCV infections become chronic and lead to chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and 
hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV usually induces robust immune responses, but it
frequently escapes the immune defense to establish persistent infection. The fact
that HCV exists as an evolving quasispecies plays an important role in the
selection of escape mutants. Furthermore, several viral proteins interfere with
cellular functions, in particular, those involved in the immune response of the
host. Several HCV proteins also modulate cell signalling through interaction with
different effectors involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis, or in the
interferon-signalling pathway. In addition, HCV infects immune cells such as B
and T cells, and thus affects their normal functions. These various strategies
used by HCV to counter the immune response of the host are reviewed here. A
better understanding of these mechanisms would help design new therapeutic
targets.
