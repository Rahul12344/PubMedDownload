γδ T cells are a unique population of lymphocytes that have regulatory roles in
patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB); however, their role in acute hepatitis B
(AHB) infection remains unclear. Phenotype and function of γδ T cells were
analyzed in 29 AHB patients, 28 CHB patients, and 30 healthy controls (HCs) using
immunofunctional assays. Compared with HCs and CHB patients, decreased peripheral
and increased hepatic γδ T cells were found in AHB patients. Increased hepatic γδ
T cells in AHB patients were attributed to elevated hepatic chemokine levels.
Peripheral γδ T cells exhibited highly activated and terminally differentiated
memory phenotype in AHB patients. Consistently, peripheral γδ T cells in AHB
patients showed increased cytotoxic capacity and enhanced antiviral activity
which was further proved in longitudinal study. Activated γδ T cells in AHB
patients exhibited increased cytotoxicity and capacity for viral clearance
associated with liver injury and the control of infection.
