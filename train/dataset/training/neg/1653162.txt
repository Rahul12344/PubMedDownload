A specific ELISA test (KCL-163) for detecting anti-hepatitis C virus antibody
(anti-HCV) has been developed (Kaketsuken). Using the KCL-163, 183 serum samples 
obtained from patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) were examined. We also
tested and compared results with Ortho HCV ELISA (C100) and C825 ELISA. Of these 
183 samples, 139 (76%), 121 (66%), and 88 (48%) were positive with KCL-163, C100 
and C825, respectively. These results showed that there were patients with NANBH 
caused by HCV who were seronegative in C100 ELISA. KCL-163 ELISA is applicable
for the diagnosis of HCV infection in these patients.
