In an attempt to improve the current live-attenuated vaccine (TC-83) for
Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE), specific mutations associated with
attenuation of VEE virus in rodent models were identified. These mutations were
inserted into full-length cDNA clones of the Trinidad donkey strain of VEE virus 
by site-directed mutagenesis, and isogenic virus strains with these mutations
were recovered after transfection of baby hamster kidney cells with infectious
RNA. We evaluated 10 of these strains for their ability to replicate in and be
transmitted by Aedes taeniorhynchus, a natural vector of epizootic VEE virus. Two
vaccine candidates, one containing a deletion of the PE2 furin cleavage site, the
other a combination of three separate point mutations in the E2 glycoprotein,
replicated in mosquitoes and were transmitted to hamsters significantly less
efficiently than was either parental (wild type) VEE virus or TC-83 virus.
Although the attenuated strains were transmitted to hamsters by mosquitoes, after
intrathoracic inoculation, there was no evidence of reversion to a virulent
phenotype. The mutations that resulted in less efficient replication in, or
transmission by, mosquitoes should enhance vaccine safety and reduce the
possibility of environmental spread to unintentional hosts.
