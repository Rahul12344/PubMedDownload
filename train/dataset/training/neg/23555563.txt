We previously reported on a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targeted amyloid beta 
(Aß) protein. Repeated injection of that mAb reduced the accumulation of Aß
protein in the brain of human Aß transgenic mice (Tg2576). In the present study, 
cDNA encoding the heavy and light chains of this mAb were subcloned into an
adeno-associated virus type 1 (AAV) vector with a 2A/furin adapter. A single
intramuscular injection of 3.0×10(10) viral genome of these AAV vectors into
C57BL/6 mice generated serum anti-Aß Ab levels up to 0.3 mg/ml. Anti-Aß Ab levels
in excess of 0.1 mg/ml were maintained for up to 64 weeks. The effect of AAV
administration on Aß levels in vivo was examined. A significant decrease in Aß
levels in the brain of Tg2576 mice treated at 5 months (prophylactic) or 10
months (therapeutic) of age was observed. These results support the use of AAV
vector encoding anti-Aß Ab for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's
disease.
