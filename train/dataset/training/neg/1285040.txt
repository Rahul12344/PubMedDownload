Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) has been performed on the reverse
transcriptases of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and the moloney murine
leukaemia virus (MuLV). The biological molecules are adsorbed on n-type
semiconducting MoTe2. The p66 (66 kD) subunit of the RT of HIV-1 is imaged by
STM. Both STM and processed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data show a
spherical and horseshoe-like shape of external diameter ca. 65 A, depending on
the angle of observation. The STM results show a larger diameter which is related
to the curvature radius of the tip of the probing needle. The RTs of HIV-1 and
MuLV exhibit a circular hole of ca. 20 A diameter in accordance with structure
predictions and functioning considerations. The surface-molecule interaction is
discussed in terms of the electronic properties of the semiconductor surface
including the influence of small defect sites at the layered crystal surface.
