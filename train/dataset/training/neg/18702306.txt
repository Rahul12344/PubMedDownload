Pectin methylesterase (PME), cell wall enzyme, is known as a factor of plant
growth and morphogenesis. Recently, PME participation in gene silencing, plant
virus reproduction and transgenesis was revealed. Here, the role of PME in
antivirus resistance was studied. It has been shown that increasing PME enzymatic
activity induced by additional PME gene and even empty vector resulted in
suppression of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) reproduction including short- and
long-distance virus movement in plant. We revealed increased PME activity in
stably-transformed intact plants. For example, transgenic tobacco and N.
benthamiana plants expressing TMV movement protein gene and GFP appeared
increased PME activity. The tomato plants co-suppressing polygalacturonase gene
have increased PME activity as well. Moreover, light-induced psbO gene activation
was accompanied by transcription of PME gene. The introduction of foreign gene in
plant cell or excess transcription of own genome resulted in increasing PME
activity leading to transcriptome status quo returning.
