Severe hearing loss and retinopathy in children: on the possible association with
rubella virus infection.

Egge K, Djupesland G, Modalsli B, Degr√© M.

Among 145 children with severe hearing loss 35 had a characteristic retinopathy. 
Only few of these had additional malformations. Most of these children (28) were 
born during the months September through February. Rubella antibodies were
present more frequently than in matched controls. No such difference was found
for cytomegalovirus and herpesvirus hominis.
