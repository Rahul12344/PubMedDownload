The use of recombinant lentiviral vectors (rLV) is emerging as a viable candidate
for clinical gene therapy of the central nervous system. New generation vectors
are being produced while addressing viral safety concerns as well as production
capabilities. Furthermore, the ability to combine envelope proteins targeting
specific cell types with specific promoters guiding the expression of the genetic
payload will allow researchers and clinicians to precisely guide transgene
expression to anatomically and phenotypically distinct populations of cells. In a
recent issue of Experimental Neurology, Cannon and colleagues demonstrate the
ability to transduce specific populations of cells in the rat midbrain by using
differently pseudotyped lentiviral vectors which results in significant
differences in transgene spread throughout the nigrostriatal tract. These results
highlight the potential utility of rLV in clinical applications as well as in
research involving neurodegenerative disease.
