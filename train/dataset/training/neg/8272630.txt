BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B vaccine has demonstrated to be very effective and safe
preventing hepatitis B virus infection. Long term protection induced by hepatitis
B vaccination depends on the initial immune response and the declining rate of
anti-HBs titers. AIM. To investigate early and late response to hepatitis B
vaccine in a sample of high risk Chilean population.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty one subjects (20 relatives of hepatitis B chronic
carriers, 10 health service workers and one HIV seropositive) were vaccinated
with a plasma derivated hepatitis B vaccine. Early and late response were
estimated by anti-HBs titers.
RESULTS: Twenty eight subjects (90%) produced protective titers of anti-HBs after
2 months from the third dose of vaccine (early response), and they remained at
these levels in 75% of vaccinated individuals after three years (late response). 
All the subjects without protective titers after the three year follow up had
produced anti-HBs levels lower than 300 UI at the early response. Hepatitis B
vaccination was not associated with significant side effects.
CONCLUSIONS: This experience confirms that hepatitis B vaccine is safe and
effective inducing immunity in high risk subjects. Our data suggest that the
early response to hepatitis B vaccine is able to identify those subjects
requiring closer surveillance for boosters.
