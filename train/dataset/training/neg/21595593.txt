Leflunomide is a synthetic isoxazole-derivative drug that possesses both
immunosuppressive and antiviral properties. Although its only US FDA-approved
indication is for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, accumulating clinical
experience in addition to animal study data makes it an appealing option for
patients who are in need of reduction of immunosuppression in the setting of
resistant cytomegalovirus infection or BK virus nephropathy, or in renal
transplant recipients with chronic allograft dysfunction. While concern over
adverse effects such as hepatotoxicity and hemolytic anemia cannot be ignored and
there has yet to be a prospective randomized trial for its use in
transplantation, its careful usage under close monitoring may provide the best
chance for patients who risk allograft rejection during the time of
immunosuppressive reduction as they attempt to eradicate BK virus or
cytomegalovirus. At the present time, its use as a first-line agent in lieu of
mycophenolate mofetil or sirolimus cannot be recommended.
