We report a case of chancroid in a white heterosexual man in the United Kingdom. 
This patient was seen by four separate health services over a period of five
weeks with excruciatingly painful penile ulcers. Despite several negative herpes 
simplex virus polymerase chain reaction tests and a self-diagnosis of chancroid, 
he was repeatedly offered multiple courses of aciclovir. This case highlights the
need for awareness of alternative diagnoses in persistent cases of genital ulcer 
disease.
