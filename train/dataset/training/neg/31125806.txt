Recent outbreaks of SARS-Coronavirus and MERS-Coronavirus (CoV) have heightened
awareness about the lack of vaccines or antiviral compounds approved for
prevention or treatment of human or potential zoonotic CoVs. Anti-CoV drug
development has long been challenged by the activity of a 3' to 5' proofreading
exoribonuclease unique to CoVs. Recently, a promising nucleoside analogue with
broad-spectrum activity against CoVs has been identified. This review will
discuss progress made in the development of antiviral nucleoside and nucleotide
analogues targeting viral RNA synthesis as effective therapeutics against CoV
infections and propose promising strategies for combination therapy.
