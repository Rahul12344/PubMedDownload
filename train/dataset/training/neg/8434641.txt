Phagocytosis, a secondary function of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells
essential to sight, was significantly decreased, when measured with latex beads, 
during persistent rubella virus (RV) infection of human cultured RPE cells. A
target for RV in vivo, RPE cells infected with RV (RPE/RV) ingested fewer
fluorescent microspheres (26%) than did uninfected RPE cells (68%) (P < 0.001),
as measured by flow cytometry. In RPE/RV cells, with characteristic RPE monolayer
appearance and normal growth during subculturing over 6 months, persistent RV
infection was shown by specific RV antigen immunofluorescence, by the presence of
the RV genome in RPE/RV cell messenger RNA, and by recovery of cell-free RV after
cocultivation with Vero cells. The adhesion of latex beads to apical cell
surfaces of RPE/RV and uninfected RPE cells appeared similar, as imaged by
scanning electron microscopy. Cytoskeletal actin, a component of phagocytosis in 
RPE, appeared altered in 60 to 75% of RPE/RV cells by antiactin
immunofluorescence staining, as previously described in other RV-infected cells, 
but its role in the disturbed phagocytosis of latex beads was not determined.
Persistently RV-infected human RPE is an additional example of RV-associated
secondary cellular dysfunction in the absence of cytopathic effects.
