There is emerging evidence that people with successfully treated HIV infection
age prematurely, leading to progressive multi-organ disease, but the reasons for 
this are not known. Here we show that patients treated with commonly used
nucleoside analog anti-retroviral drugs progressively accumulate somatic
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations, mirroring those seen much later in life
caused by normal aging. Ultra-deep re-sequencing by synthesis, combined with
single-cell analyses, suggests that the increase in somatic mutation is not
caused by increased mutagenesis but might instead be caused by accelerated mtDNA 
turnover. This leads to the clonal expansion of preexisting age-related somatic
mtDNA mutations and a biochemical defect that can affect up to 10% of cells.
These observations add weight to the role of somatic mtDNA mutations in the aging
process and raise the specter of progressive iatrogenic mitochondrial genetic
disease emerging over the next decade.
