Development and early natural history of HTLV-III antibodies in persons with
hemophilia.

Eyster ME, Goedert JJ, Sarngadharan MG, Weiss SH, Gallo RC, Blattner WA.

Antibodies to human T-cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) were first
detected in 1979 in serum samples from 30 known seropositive patients with
hemophilia, over half of whom seroconverted in 1981-1982. Lymphadenopathy was
present in 70% who were seropositive more than three years, compared with 10% who
were seropositive three years or less. T-helper cell counts were low (307 +/- 64 
cells/cu mm) in the early seroconverters, and normal in the late seroconverters. 
T-suppressor cell counts were not related to the year of seroconversion. The long
latency period after seroconversion suggests an ongoing indolent process, rather 
than an acute infection. It remains to be determined whether this is an aberrant 
part of the immune response initiated by HTLV-III antigens or the result of a
chronic active HTLV-III infection.
