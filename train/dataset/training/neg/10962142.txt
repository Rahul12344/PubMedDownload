Inflammation and associated excitotoxicity may play important roles in various
neurodegenerative diseases including AIDS dementia. Here we show that exposure of
rat parietal cortical slices to the HIV glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 triggered
very rapid releases of the neurotransmitters glutamate and [(3)H]noradrenaline
(NA), and of the neuromodulator adenosine. Gp41 was more effective than gp120 at 
releasing glutamate and [(3)H]NA, while both glycoproteins were equi-effective at
releasing adenosine. The responses to gp120 and gp41 declined rapidly to basal
levels following their removal. It seems possible that rapid, inappropriate
excitation may occur in the immediate vicinity of HIV infections in the brain,
possibly producing some of the transient neurological and psychiatric symptoms
associated with AIDS dementia.
