In France, influenza kills about 2,000 persons per year Among the viruses (M.
influenzae A, B and C), type A is the most dangerous because it caused several
deadly epidemics. The deepening of knowledge on the mechanisms of infection is
essential in the search for new antiviral drugs and more effective vaccines,
particularly for developing a vaccine giving long-term immunity. In April 2009, a
novel flu strain that combined genes from human, pig, and bird flu, influenza
A/H1N1, emerged in Mexico, the United States, and several other nations. The WHO 
officially declared the outbreak to be a pandemic on June 11, 2009. In 2003, the 
emerging A(H5N1) influenza virus had been responsible for the largest epizootic
event described so far. Facing the fear of a mutation or recombination of the
virus, such a pandemic threat has strengthened the public health device and
stimulated fundamental, clinical and applied research. Such a mobilization of
government and scientific community has been beneficial at the onset of pandemic 
A(H1N1). WHO continues to monitor A(H1N1) pandemics worldwide, based on results
of clinical studies and specific research.
