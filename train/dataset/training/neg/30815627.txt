Background: Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a proposed latent biomarker for 
several cancers, including liver cancer. Deoxyribonucleases (DNases) facilitate
the timely and efficient degradation of cfDNA, leading us to hypothesize that
DNase I and/or II might be a more sensitive early biomarker than cfDNA. To test
this hypothesis, a study was conducted in a large, prospective cohort.
Methods: A nested case-control study (224 liver cancer case patients and 224
matched control subjects) was conducted in a cohort of Finnish male smokers,
followed from baseline (1985-1988) to 2014. The associations among DNase I
activity, cfDNA, and the risk of liver cancer were assessed using
multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic regression.
Results: DNase I activity, whether measured as radius (mm) or as units per
milliliter, was statistically significantly associated with increased risk of
liver cancer (P trend <.01). DNase I activity in the highest quartile was
associated with a greater than threefold risk of developing liver cancer (DNase I
activity radius >2.7 mm, hazard ratio [HR] = 3.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] =
1.59 to 5.77; DNase I activity >2.72 units/mL, HR = 3.30, 95% CI = 1.64 to 6.65).
The strength of this association was not substantially altered by exclusion of
cases diagnosed within the first five years of follow-up or those with hepatitis 
C virus (HCV) infection. In contrast, cfDNA and DNase II was not statistically
significantly associated with risk of liver cancer.
Conclusions: DNase I activity was a superior latent biomarker of liver cancer
than cfDNA. These findings advance the goal of developing a means to detect liver
cancer years well before the development of clinical manifestations.
