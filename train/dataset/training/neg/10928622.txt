Infections due to hepatitis A (HAV), hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) and
hepatitis E (HEV) viruses are the major causes of hepatitis and are associated
with significant morbidity and mortality in developing countries like Bangladesh.
The present study was carried out to determine the prevalence of HBsAg, anti-HCV 
antibody, anti-HAV antibody and anti-HEV antibody in patients suspected of having
infection by HBV, HCV, HAV and HEV, respectively. Antibody to HAV was detected in
39% of subjects investigated. HBsAg was identified in 19% of subjects. Antibody
to HCV and HEV was detected in 13% and 53% subjects, respectively. Infection with
HAV was very high among children < or = 6 years of age (100%). On the contrary,
exposure to HEV was higher in adult persons > or => 30 years of age (52%)
compared to that in children < or = 6 years of age who had 0% incidence. Our
study clearly indicates a high prevalence of those viruses, particularly of
enterically transmitted HAV and HEV in Bangladesh, which appeared to be a serious
health problem in this developing country. Control measures should be taken on an
urgent basis to prevent the spread of infections by these viruses.
