The conserved and essential DEAD-box RNA helicase Ded1p from yeast and its
mammalian orthologue DDX3 are critical for the initiation of translation1.
Mutations in DDX3 are linked to tumorigenesis2-4 and intellectual disability5,
and the enzyme is targeted by a range of viruses6. How Ded1p and its orthologues 
engage RNAs during the initiation of translation is unknown. Here we show, by
integrating transcriptome-wide analyses of translation, RNA structure and
Ded1p-RNA binding, that the effects of Ded1p on the initiation of translation are
connected to near-cognate initiation codons in 5' untranslated regions. Ded1p
associates with the translation pre-initiation complex at the mRNA entry channel 
and repressing the activity of Ded1p leads to the accumulation of RNA structure
in 5' untranslated regions, the initiation of translation from near-cognate start
codons immediately upstream of these structures and decreased protein synthesis
from the corresponding main open reading frames. The data reveal a program for
the regulation of translation that links Ded1p, the activation of near-cognate
start codons and mRNA structure. This program has a role in meiosis, in which a
marked decrease in the levels of Ded1p is accompanied by the activation of the
alternative translation initiation sites that are seen when the activity of Ded1p
is repressed. Our observations indicate that Ded1p affects translation initiation
by controlling the use of near-cognate initiation codons that are proximal to
mRNA structure in 5' untranslated regions.
