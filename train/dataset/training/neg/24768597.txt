Recently we have shown that the highly conserved herpes simplex virus
glycoprotein K (gK) binds to signal peptide peptidase (SPP), also known as minor 
histocompatibility antigen H13. In this study we have demonstrated for the first 
time that inhibitors of SPP, such as L685,458, (Z-LL)2 ketone, aspirin, ibuprofen
and DAPT, significantly reduced HSV-1 replication in tissue culture. Inhibition
of SPP activity via (Z-LL)2 ketone significantly reduced viral transcripts in the
nucleus of infected cells. Finally, when administered during primary infection,
(Z-LL)2 ketone inhibitor reduced HSV-1 replication in the eyes of ocularly
infected mice. Thus, blocking SPP activity may represent a clinically effective
and expedient approach to the reduction of viral replication and the resulting
pathology.
