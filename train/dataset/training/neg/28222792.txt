BACKGROUND: Post-Soviet Kyrgyzstan has experienced a major surge in blood-borne
infections, but data from adequately powered, up-to-date studies are lacking. We 
thus examined a) the seroprevalences of hepatitis B virus surface antigen
(HBsAg), HIV-1 p24 antigen and antibodies against hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV),
human immunodeficiency viruses (anti-HIV-1/2, HIV-1 group O), and Treponema
pallidum among blood donors in Kyrgyzstan and assess their distribution according
to sex, age, and provinces of residence; b) trends in the respective
seroprevalences; and c) co-infection rates among the pathogens studied.
METHODS: Serological screening was performed on 37 165 blood donors at the
Republican Blood Centre in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, between January 2013 and December
2015. We applied poststratification weights to control for sampling bias and used
logistic regression analyses to examine the association of seropositivity and
co-infections with sex, age, provinces of residence, and year of blood donation.
RESULTS: Twenty nine thousand and one hundred forty-five (78%) donors were males 
and 8 020 (22%) were females. The median age was 27 years (range: 18 - 64). The
prevalences of HBsAg, anti-HCV, HIV (p24 Ag and anti-HIV), and anti-T. pallidum
were 3.6% (95%CI: 3.4 - 3.8%), 3.1% (3.0 - 3.3%), 0.78% (0.69 - 0.87%), and 3.3% 
(3.1 - 3.5%), respectively. Males were more likely to be seropositive for HBsAg
than females (OR: 1.63; 95%CI: 1.40 - 1.90), but less likely to be seropositive
for anti-HCV (0.85; 0.74 - 0.98) and HIV (0.65; 0.49 - 0.85). Prevalences were
lower in the capital than in the other provinces. There was a decreasing trend in
the seroprevalences of HBsAg, anti-HCV, and anti-T. pallidum from 2012 to 2015
(P-value for trend, P = 0.01, P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, respectively), while the
seroprevalence of HIV increased (P = 0.049). One hundred eighty donors (0.48%)
were seropositive for multiple infections. The highest co-infection rate was
observed between anti-T. pallidum and HBsAg (6.0%), followed by anti-HCV and
anti-T. pallidum (5.2%), and HIV and anti-HCV (4.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that Kyrgyzstan can be reclassified from high to
lower-intermediate HBsAg endemicity, whereas the high HIV prevalence with a
rising trend is an alarming finding that needs to be urgently addressed by public
health authorities. The observed co-infections suggest common risk factors but
also common preventive interventions.
