The results of a research project on ex vivo expansion of human haematopoietic
stem cells (HSC) and development of gene therapy, funded by the Swiss National
Research Program 46, are summarised and discussed in the context of current
progresses and difficulties in these fields. A routine method for ex vivo
expansion of human HSC is not yet available. However, stem cell biology has
progressed importantly in recent years; ex vivo expansion of human HSC should
become possible in the near future. Regarding gene therapy development, we
obtained with HIV-1-derived bicistronic lentiviral vectors efficient delivery of 
genes into immature haematopoietic cells and also primary human B lymphocytes.
However, clinical gene therapy still faces a variety of problems. For the (into
chromosomes) integrating lentivectors, currently the most promising tools for
HSC-based gene therapy, the risks of insertional mutagenesis need to be fully
assessed before larger clinical trials can start.
