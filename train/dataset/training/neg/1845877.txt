The cylindrical inclusion protein of potyviruses contains the so-called
nucleoside triphosphate binding motif, an amino acid sequence motif present in
proteins encoded by most positive-strand RNA viruses, some double-strand RNA
viruses, apparently all groups of double-strand DNA viruses, and also several
single-strand DNA viruses. Further sequence analysis has allowed to include the
cylindrical inclusion protein of potyviruses as a member of a superfamily of
helicaselike proteins. In this paper we show that the purified cylindrical
inclusion protein of plum pox potyvirus interacts with RNA and ATP and copurifies
with a nucleic acid-stimulated ATPase activity. To our knowledge, this is the
first time that this kind of enzymatic activity has been experimentally
associated with a positive-strand RNA virus-encoded protein.
