Oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 commonly associated with
cervical cancer are found in many epithelial malignancies at extra-genital sites 
including breast. The transforming gene products of HPV have also been shown to
immortalize breast epithelial cells in vitro. But the findings of HPV DNA in
breast carcinoma are found to be contradictory. In the present study fine needle 
aspirate cell (FNAC) samples from 26 breast cancer patients and four breast
tumour biopsies were analysed for the presence of HPV 16 and 18 DNA sequences by 
both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot hybridization. Of 26 fine 
needle aspirate cell samples and four breast cancer biopsies, not a single sample
was found to be positive by either PCR or Southern blot hybridization. The
observation of complete absence of HPV DNA sequences in breast cancer refute the 
possibility of any role for oncogenic genital HPV types 16 and 18 in the
pathogenesis of breast cancer.
