A 50-kDa protein that binds to viral particles in solid-phase assays and that is 
recognized by anti-idiotypic antibodies made against anti-viral glycoproteins
G1/G2 (anti-Ids) has been proposed as a receptor candidate for tomato spotted
wilt tospovirus (TSWV) in its main thrips vector, Frankliniella occidentalis
Pergande (Bandla et al., 1998. Phytopathology 88, 98-104). Here we show the
immunoprecipitation of the 50-kDa protein by anti-Ids and by an anti-G1/G2-TSWV
conjugate - a new immunoprecipitation method. In addition, we show that anti-Ids 
made against anti-G1 (anti-IdG1) block virus replication in an insect tissue
replication assay. The results indicate that (a) the TSWV-50-kDa protein
interaction occurs in solution, as it must do in vivo; (b) G1 is a viral
attachment protein; and (c) the 50-kDa protein is a candidate host factor
essential for TSWV entry. These results provide additional support for the role
of the 50-kDa thrips protein as a viral receptor. Additionally these experiments 
provide the basis for testing saturable binding and represent an important step
toward the first cloning and identification of a cellular receptor for a plant
virus.
