Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) triggers antiviral immune responses by recognizing
viral single-stranded RNA in endosomes, but the biosynthetic pathway of human
TLR7 (hTLR7) remains unclear. Here, we show that hTLR7 is proteolytically
processed and that the C-terminal fragment selectively accumulates in endocytic
compartments. hTLR7 processing occurred at neutral pH and was dependent on
furin-like proprotein convertases (PCs). Furthermore, TLR7 processing was
required for its functional response to TLR7 agonists such as R837 or influenza
virus. Notably, proinflammatory and differentiation stimuli increased the
expression of furin-like PCs in immune cells, suggesting a positive feedback
mechanism for TLR7 processing during infection. Because self-RNA can under
certain conditions activate TLR7 and trigger autoimmunity, our results identify
furin-like PCs as a possible target to attenuate TLR7-dependent autoimmunity and 
other immune pathologies.
