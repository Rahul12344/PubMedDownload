Comparative pathology of infection by novel diarrhoea viruses.

Hall GA.

Examination of diarrhoeic faeces in the electron microscope often reveals viruses
that are presumed to be enteropathogenic. Lesions caused by novel rotaviruses
were similar to those of group A rotaviruses, but enterocyte syncytia were seen
which are probably pathognomonic for novel rotaviruses. In adenovirus infection
in piglets, mature enterocytes were infected and destroyed; intranuclear
inclusion bodies were seen in infected enterocytes. Calici-like viruses infected 
mature enterocytes in calves and the lesions were similar to those described in
humans infected with calici-like viruses; in both host species it was impossible 
to demonstrate virus particles in enterocytes examined in the electron
microscope. The Breda virus infected villi and crypts in the lower small
intestine and the surface and crypts in the large intestine; it was the only
enteropathogenic virus to show this distribution of infection and lesions.
Astrovirus infection in lambs was comparable to a mild rotavirus infection, but
in calves the epithelium of the dome villi of Peyer's patches was infected.
Parvovirus in cats and dogs infected and destroyed small intestinal crypt cells, 
causing dilated crypts and stunted villi; intranuclear inclusion bodies were
prominent.
