by the Epstein-Barr virus.

To understand the relationship between antibodies present in patients with
anti-nuclear dot (ND) autoimmune disease and the proteins they recognize,
epitopes that react with the autoantibodies were mapped. A panel of fusion
proteins containing different portions of the ND protein were overproduced in
Escherichia coli. Immunoblot analysis with anti-ND antibodies revealed that most 
(10 of 12) sera recognize two major autoepitopes that are each a maximum of 8
amino acids long. The other two sera recognize one of the two epitopes. In
addition to the short linear autoepitopes, a conformational epitope appears to be
present on the ND antigen. Each of the two linear epitope sequences shares
sequence similarities with those of several viral proteins found in the
databases. Furthermore, two fusion proteins containing short Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) protein sequences that are similar to the ND epitopes were recognized by
the human autoimmune sera, indicating that the autoepitopes are present in EBV
protein sequences. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that ND
autoimmune disease might be associated with EBV infections.
