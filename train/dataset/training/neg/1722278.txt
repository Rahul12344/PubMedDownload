Reactivation of herpes simplex virus (HSV) was assumed to be dependent on
prostaglandin synthesis [Kurane et al. (1984) J Gen Virol 65:1665-1674]. Since
free radicals are generated in the course of prostaglandin synthesis and
inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis are free radical scavengers, the question
arose whether free radicals are most important in viral reactivation. Therefore, 
the influence of five different inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis was
compared with the activity of two combinations of classical radical scavengers.
Since the efficiency of both groups of compounds was similar, the role of free
radicals in viral reactivation was strongly assumed, whereas the role of
prostaglandins has to be revisited. All drugs tested were effective in the early 
phase after explantation of the latently infected ganglia and could be omitted in
the later stages of co-cultivation. As free radicals are suspected of activating 
nuclear factors, it was of interest to confirm the enhancement of HSV
reactivation by DNA hypomethylating drugs. 5-Azazytidine proved to be more
effective than dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The effect of combinations of DMSO with 
inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis was dependent on the mode of action of the 
inhibitors.
