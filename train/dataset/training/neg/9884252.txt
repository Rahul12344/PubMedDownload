BACKGROUND: Few data are available describing the natural history of the
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viral load after the diagnosis of EBV-associated
posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). Accordingly, we prospectively 
followed the EBV viral load after the diagnosis of EBV/PTLD in seven pediatric
orthotopic liver transplant recipients.
METHODS: EBV viral loads were serially measured by quantitative competitive
polymerase chain reaction of the peripheral blood from pediatric patients with
PTLD and correlated with the clinical course of these children. Viral loads >200 
genome copies/10(5) peripheral blood lymphocytes were considered consistent with 
an increased risk of PTLD. Viral loads <200 obtained during treatment for PTLD
were considered evidence of "clearance" of EBV; subsequent loads >200 were
considered evidence of virologic "rebound."
RESULTS: The mean EBV viral load at the time of diagnosis of PTLD was 1029. All
patients "cleared" their EBV viral load during the treatment of PTLD; patient and
graft survival in this series was 100%. The mean time to clearance of EBV from
the peripheral blood (18.8 days) was similar to the mean time to onset of first
rejection (13.8 days). EBV viral load at the time of diagnosis of rejection after
PTLD was always <100. A rebound in the EBV viral load to >200 was noted in five
of seven patients a median of 3.5 months (range 2.3-13 months) after the
diagnosis of EBV/PTLD. However, none of these children has had any evidence of
PTLD recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Clearance of the EBV viral load from the peripheral blood seems to
correlate with restoration of the host's immune response as noted both by the
regression of the PTLD and the onset of rejection. Late rebound of the EBV viral 
load is common and does not seem to predict disease recurrence.
