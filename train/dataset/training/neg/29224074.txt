The emergence of high-throughput sequencing technologies has deepened our
understanding of complex microbial communities and greatly facilitated the study 
of as-yet uncultured microbes and viruses. Studies of complex microbial
communities require high-quality data to generate valid results. Here, we detail 
current methods of microbial and viral community sample acquisition, DNA
extraction, sample preparation, and sequencing on Illumina high-throughput
platforms. While using appropriate analytical tools is important, it must not
overshadow the need for establishing a proper experimental design and obtaining
sufficient numbers of samples for statistical purposes. Researchers must also
take care to sample biologically relevant sites and control for potential
confounding factors (e.g., contamination).
