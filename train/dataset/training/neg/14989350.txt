The role of hematophagous arthropods in vesicular stomatitis virus (New Jersey
serotype; VSV-NJ) transmission during epizootics has remained unclear for decades
in part because it has never been shown that clinical or subclinical disease in a
livestock host results from the bite of an infected insect. In this study, we
investigated the ability of VSV-NJ-infected black flies (Simulium vittatum
Zetterstedt) to transmit the virus to domestic swine, Sus scrofa L. Experimental 
evidence presented here clearly demonstrates that VSV-NJ was transmitted from
black flies to the swine. Transmission was confirmed by seroconversion or by the 
presence of clinical vesicular stomatitis followed by seroconversion. Our results
represent the first report of clinical vesicular stomatitis in a livestock host
after virus transmission by an insect.
