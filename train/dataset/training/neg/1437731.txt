Chromosomal analysis has been carried out in 4 patients with the symptoms of
hepatic coma. An analysis included lymphocytes cultured from peripheral blood.
Chromosomal disorders have been assessed with two techniques: structural
chromosomal aberrations test, and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test. It has
been shown that the extend of chromosomal damage in the form of the gaps, breaks,
acentric chromosomes as well as the presence of ring and dicentric chromosomes,
and micronuclear cells have been higher in the examined patients. Such changes
may evidence DNA repair disorders, and the presence of micronuclear forms may
seem an unfavourable prognosis.
