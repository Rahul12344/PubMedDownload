The Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus gordonii has been genetically
engineered to allow the simultaneous expression of two heterologous proteins at
the cell surface. A family of recombinant streptococci displaying two different
antigens was constructed. All the strains were genetically stable and expressed
both proteins at the surface of the same bacterial cell. S. gordonii
co-expressing the immunomodulating molecule LTB (B monomer of Escherichia coli
heat-labile toxin) and the V3 domain of HIV-1 gp120 were inoculated
subcutaneously to BALB/c mice. Animals were capable of responding to both
antigens, producing LTB- and V3-specific serum IgG. The V3-specific IgG titer was
four-fold higher in mice immunised with the double protein-expressing bacteria,
as compared to control animals inoculated either with S. gordonii expressing the 
V3 domain alone or with a mixture of the two strains expressing LTB and V3,
separately. Therefore, LTB was able to potentiate the antibody response towards
the V3 domain, and this effect was observed only when LTB was co-expressed on the
same bacterial cell.
