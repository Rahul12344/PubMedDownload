Evidence of the safety and protective benefits of human papillomavirus virus
(HPV) vaccines as an anti-cancer measure is overwhelming. However, vaccine uptake
varies widely across countries and falls short of levels needed to achieve
population immunity. We highlight policy measures that would help ensure greater 
worldwide coverage and save lives.
