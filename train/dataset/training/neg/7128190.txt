A controlled study of benzydamine oral rinse ("Difflam") in general practice.

Whiteside MW.

Fifty-two patients suffering from presumed viral pharyngeal infection or
tonsillitis were treated with either benzydamine or placebo oral rinse as a
gargle at 3-hourly intervals in a randomized double-blind study. Patients on the 
active preparation experienced faster resolution of pain and dysphagia and at 7
days 88% were symptom-free compared with 38% on placebo.
