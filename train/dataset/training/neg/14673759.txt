Liver-related mortality is an increasing problem in human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)/hepatitis B virus (HBV)-coinfected patients receiving highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In HIV-negative patients, HBV chronicity is
associated with a reduction in specific T cell responses that can be partially
restored by treatment with lamivudine. We studied 5 HIV/HBV-coinfected patients
treated with HAART, either with or without addition of a drug with specific
anti-HBV activity. Our data show that reconstitution of some HBV-specific T cell 
responses can also occur in HIV-positive patients after a reduction in HBV load. 
This potential to recover T cell responses, which has been thought to be critical
for HBV control, provides support for the addition of anti-HBV therapy in the
treatment of HIV/HBV-coinfected patients.
