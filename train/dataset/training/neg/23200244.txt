7-(2H-Tetrazol-5-yl)-1H-indole 3 was found to be a potent inhibitor of HIV-1
attachment but the compound lacked oral bioavailability in rats. The cause of the
low exposure was believed to be poor absorption attributed to the acidic nature
of the tetrazole moiety and, in an effort to address this liability, three more
lipohilic tetrazole analogs, N-acetoxymethyl 4, N-pivaloyloxymethyl 5, and
N-methyl 6, were evaluated as potential oral prodrugs in rats. Prodrug 5 was
ineffective in improving the plasma concentration of 3 in vivo but compound 4
provided a 15-fold enhancement of the plasma concentration of 3. Most
interestingly, oral dosing of analog 6 afforded a substantial increase in the
plasma concentration of the parent in rats when compared to dosing of parent.
This represents a novel example of a methyl tetrazole that acts as a prodrug for 
a free NH tetrazole-containing compound.
