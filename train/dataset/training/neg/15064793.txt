tert-Azido or amino substituted penciclovir analogs, 1-3 were synthesized for the
purpose of improving the efficacy and bioavailability of penciclovir and
searching for novel antiviral agents. Among several methods attempted to insert
an azido group into the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester 6, only Bronsted
acid-catalysed 1,4-conjugate addition conditions (NaN3, 75% acetic acid, 80
degrees C) gave the desired tert-azido product 7. The synthesized final
penciclovir analogs 1-3 were evaluated in vitro against several viruses such as
HIV-1, HSV-1 and 2, poliovirus, VZV, and VSV. Compound 2 only showed weak
antiviral activity against HSV-1 without cytotoxicity. Although the synthesized
compounds did not exhibit an excellent antiviral activity, the successful method 
used in introducing the tert-azido group is expected to be generally utilized for
the synthesis of nucleoside analogs with a tert-azido substituent.
