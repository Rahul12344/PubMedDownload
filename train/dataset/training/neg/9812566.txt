In order to know the therapeutic effect of purified human leucocytic
interferon-alpha on hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome diagnosed early (< or =
5 days). We treated 23 cases with clinical prognosis and antiviral effect
significantly better than those of 21 cases in a random control group. The
membrane protein (MP), nucleo protein (NP) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMC) and urine, the serum antibodies to MP and NP were determined before
treatment and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 days after the beginning of the treatment. The
results showed that in the treatment group, the expressin of MP and NP in PBMC
were significantly depressed. The rate of negative turning of MP and NP in PBMC
was 65.22% (15/23) and 69.57% (16/23) in 10 days, while in the control group, it 
was 19.05% (4/21) and 14.29% (3/21). The rate of negative turning of MP and NP in
urine were 78.57% (11/14) and 90.91% (10/11) and that in the control group was
30.00% (3/10) and 16.66% (1/6). There was a significant difference between the
two groups (P < 0.01). The results indicated that IFN-alpha could attenuate the
lesions caused directly by virus, improve patients condition and raise the cure
rate through depressing the expression of the virus.
