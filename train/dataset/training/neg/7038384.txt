Regulation of early gene expression of bacteriophage phi 80: transcriptional
regulation by phi 80 gene 30.

Morita T, Matsushiro A.

The gene30sus620 mutation of bacteriophage phi 80 was mapped close to the left of
the cI gene on the standard genetic map. The distance between the mutation
(gene30sus620) and the cI gene was about 0.01%, as judged by recombination
frequencies. The transcriptional pattern of the mutant showed two distinct
differences from that of the wild type; late mRNAs were not synthesized, and
early genes were preferentially transcribed rightward in contrast with the
predominantly leftward transcription in the wild type. The synthesis of early
proteins was also affected. Wild-type phi 80 permits synthesis of five major
proteins (pE, pB, pA, pC, and pD) and two minor proteins (pU and pV) upon
infection of ultraviolet-irradiated cells. Synthesis of the major proteins was
significantly reduced in the mutant, while synthesis of the two minor proteins
was enhanced several-fold in this mutant. These results indicate that the gene 30
product regulates the transcription of the two operons in the early region of phi
80, i.e., operon 1, which is transcribed to the left and codes for the five major
proteins, and operon 2, which seems to be transcribed to the right and codes for 
the two minor proteins.
