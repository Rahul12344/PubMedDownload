Hepatitis C virus is a global health concern, estimated to infect 2-3% of the
world's population. Inter-individual differences in the course of infection and
response to therapy, highlighted by recent genomewide association studies, point 
to the crucial role of the host immune system in the efficient control of
infection. Ongoing progress in the studies of the role of innate immunity during 
hepatitis C virus infection has improved our understanding of the intricacies of 
the host-virus interactions. In this review, we summarize and discuss the current
knowledge concerning interferon signaling in the liver during acute and chronic
hepatitis C virus infection and its implications for the outcome of
interferon-α-based antiviral therapies.
