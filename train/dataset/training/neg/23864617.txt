It has been proposed that herpes simplex virus 1 with VP22 deleted requires
secondary mutation of VHS for viability. Here we show that a
replication-competent Δ22 virus constructed by homologous recombination maintains
a wild-type (Wt) VHS gene and has no other gross mutations. By contrast, Δ22
viruses recovered from a bacterial artificial chromosome contain multiple amino
acid changes within a conserved region of VHS. Hence, the mode of virus rescue
influences the acquisition of secondary mutations.
