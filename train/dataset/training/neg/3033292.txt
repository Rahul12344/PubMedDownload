DNA-binding activity of papillomavirus proteins.

Mallon RG, Wojciechowicz D, Defendi V.

We demonstrate DNA binding by papillomavirus (PV) open reading frame (ORF)
proteins that correspond to the early transforming and trans-activating (E6 and
E2) and late structural regions (L2 and L1) from bovine PV type 1 and human PV
types 6b and 16. All PV proteins were synthesized in Escherichia coli and had a
common 13-amino-acid leader sequence from the expression vector pRA10. Antibodies
have been generated in rabbits against these PV proteins. The PV ORF proteins
bind double-stranded DNA, and this activity is demonstrated to be inherent to the
PV proteins. DNA-binding activity by PV proteins is optimal at 50 mM NaCl and at 
pH 7.0. For some PV proteins (e.g., bovine PV type 1 E2), DNA binding is enhanced
at a lower pH (pH 6.0) and NaCl concentration (50 to 100 mM). DNA binding is
inhibited by the appropriate antibodies. The possible significance of these
findings is discussed in relation to the genetic and structural evidence on the
function of these ORFs.
