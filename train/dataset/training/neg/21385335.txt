Retroviruses are enveloped viruses that assemble on the inner leaflet of cellular
membranes. Improving biophysical techniques has recently unveiled many molecular 
aspects of the interaction between the retroviral structural protein Gag and the 
cellular membrane lipids. This interaction is driven by the N-terminal matrix
domain of the protein, which probably undergoes important structural
modifications during this process, and could induce membrane lipid distribution
changes as well. This review aims at describing the molecular events occurring
during MA-membrane interaction, and pointing out their consequences in terms of
viral assembly. The striking conservation of the matrix membrane binding mode
among retroviruses indicates that this particular step is most probably a
relevant target for antiviral research.
