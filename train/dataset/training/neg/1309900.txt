An adeno-associated virus (AAV) genome with a Lys-to-His (K340H) mutation in the 
consensus nucleotide triphosphate binding site of the rep gene has a
dominant-negative DNA replication phenotype in vivo. We expressed both wild-type 
(Rep78) and mutant (Rep78NTP) proteins in two helper-free expression systems
consisting of either recombinant baculoviruses in insect cells or the human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat promoter in human 293 cell
transient transfections. We analyzed nuclear extracts from both expression
systems for the ability to complement uninfected HeLa cell cytoplasmic extracts
in an in vitro terminal resolution assay in which a covalently closed AAV
terminal hairpin structure is converted to an extended linear duplex. Although
both Rep78 and Rep78NTP bound to AAV terminal hairpin DNA in vitro, Rep78 but not
Rep78NTP complemented the terminal resolution assay. Furthermore, Rep78NTP was
trans dominant for AAV terminal resolution in vitro. We propose that the
dominant-negative replication phenotype of AAV genomes carrying the K340H
mutation is mediated by mutant Rep proteins binding to the terminal repeat
hairpin.
