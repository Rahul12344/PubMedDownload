Because of the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic, skin testing for
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is now performed in conjunction with control skin
tests to assess anergy and thus provide information to aid in the interpretation 
of a negative tuberculin test. However, anergy can occur selectively to purified 
protein derivative tuberculin when reactions to other recall antigens are
present. We report an illustrative case of selective anergy in a patient with
tuberculous meningitis and review the literature on this poorly understood
phenomenon. When one suspects M. tuberculosis disease, repeating a 5 unit
PPD-tuberculin skin test after four to eight weeks of antituberculous treatment
may assist in establishing or excluding the diagnosis of tuberculosis.
