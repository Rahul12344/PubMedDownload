The past decade has seen a surge in the development of a variety of molecular
diagnostics designed to rapidly identify or characterize medically important
microorganisms. We briefly review important advances in molecular microbiology,
and then discuss specific assays that have been implemented in clinical
microbiology laboratories throughout the country. We also discuss emerging
methods and technologies that will soon be more widely used for the prompt and
accurate detection of the agents of infectious diseases.
