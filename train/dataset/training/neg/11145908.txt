A characteristic feature of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a high frequency
of persistence and the progression to chronic liver diseases. Recent data suggest
that prevalent T helper (Th) 2 immunity as well as weak HCV-specific T-cell
response is associated with viral persistence. Here, we showed that the
production of interleukin 12 (IL-12) and nitric oxide (NO) that is critical for
the induction of Th1 and innate immunity, but not that of tumor necrosis factor
alpha (TNF-alpha), was significantly suppressed in both HCV core-expressing
macrophage cell lines and mouse peritoneal macrophages treated with recombinant
core protein. In addition, IL-12 p40 promoter activity was repressed by the
presence of HCV core in macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharride (LPS)
following IFN-gamma treatment, indicating that IL-12 production may be
downregulated at the transcriptional level. We also found that proliferation of T
cells and IFN-gamma production in mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) with
core-expressing cells were inhibited. Taken together, our results suggest that
HCV core protein could play roles in suppressing the induction of Th1 immunity
through inhibition of IL-12 and NO production.
