Using a reverse plaque forming cell (PFC) assay the production of immunoglobulin 
(Ig) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) in vitro was studied in 12
patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). Spontaneous IgG production was
increased in two of six untreated patients. The IgG response of MNCs from eight
untreated patients to pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
stimulation was significantly depressed. The IgM and IgA production followed the 
individual pattern of IgG. Blood B-cell and T-cell subset concentrations were
normal before therapy, whereas the monocyte concentration was increased in four
of six patients. Titers of anti-neutrophil cytoplasm autoantibodies (ANCAs) did
not correlate with spontaneous or induced Ig production nor with blood leukocyte 
subset concentrations. Biopsy specimens from upper respiratory tract lesions in
seven untreated patients showed numerous macrophages, activated T lymphocytes,
and plasma cells, suggesting a pathogenetic role of these cells in the
development of lesions and local production of ANCAs.
