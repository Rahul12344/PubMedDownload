The discovery of lead compound 2e was described. Its covalent binding to HCV NS5B
polymerase enzyme was investigated by X-ray analysis. The results of
distribution, metabolism and pharmacokinetics were reported. Compound 2e was
demonstrated to be potent (replicon GT-1b EC50 = 0.003 μM), highly selective, and
safe in in vitro and in vivo assays.
