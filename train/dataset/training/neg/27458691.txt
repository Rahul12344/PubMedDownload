Several viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus, are now known to be associated with 
several human cancers, but not all patients with these viral infections develop
cancer. In transplantation, such viruses often have a prolonged time gap from
infection to cancer development, and many are preceded by a period of circulating
and detectable nucleic acids in the peripheral blood compartment. The
interpretation of a viral load as a measure of posttransplant risk of developing 
cancer depends on the virus, the cancer and associated pathogenic factors. This
review describes the current state of knowledge regarding the utility and
limitations of peripheral blood nucleic acid testing for Epstein-Barr virus in
surveillance and risk prediction for posttransplant lymphoproliferative
disorders.
