BACKGROUND: Urethritis is a common sexually transmitted disease, and human
adenoviruses (HAdVs) have been found to be associated with nonchlamydial
nongonococcal urethritis. However, the level and viability of HAdV in the urine
of patients with urethritis remain unclear.
METHODS: Male patients with urethritis and an asymptomatic group were screened
using their First-void urine (FVU) for urethritis-related pathogens to identify
those with HAdV DNA. FVU and gargle fluid were collected from all patients
including from those in the asymptomatic group. A swab of eye discharge was also 
collected from patients with eye symptoms. The pharyngeal and/ or ocular fluid
was also screened only in cases in which FVU was positive for HAdV DNA. HAdVs
were isolated using A549 cell lines and typed by sequencing, and viral shedding
during 2 years was quantified using real-time PCR. The prevalence of HAdV was
assessed in the urethritis and asymptomatic groups, and viral load, isolated HAdV
types, and urethral symptoms were compared between the groups.
RESULTS: The positive detection rate of HAdV DNA was significantly higher in the 
urethritis group than in the asymptomatic group. Of 398 patients with urethritis,
HAdV was isolated in all 32 cases (23 cases in which only HAdV DNA was detected
with a mean of 2 Ã— 109 copies/mL in urine samples). Of 124 control cases, one had
HAdV monoinfection. The most frequently detected HAdV type was 56, followed by
types 37 and 64. Regarding the relationship between symptoms and isolated HAdVs, 
the virus was isolated for up to 12 days after urethritis symptoms disappeared.
CONCLUSIONS: HAdVs were significantly detected and isolated from the FVU of
patients with urethritis. Furthermore, high levels of infectious HAdVs are
excreted in urine for a long period even after urethritis symptoms disappear.
