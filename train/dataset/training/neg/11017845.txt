We determined RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and
secreted) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) concentrations, and total white blood cell
(WBC) and differential counts in nasal wash samples from rhinovirus-infected
infants presenting with wheezing or acute upper respiratory illness alone and
compared them with those from healthy infants. RANTES concentrations were
significantly greater in acute samples from wheezy patients than in those from
patients with acute upper respiratory illness only, or in control samples. IL-8
concentrations and WBC and neutrophil counts were significantly greater in acute 
samples from wheezy infants and patients with upper respiratory illness alone
than in control samples, but they did not differ significantly between the 2
patient groups.
