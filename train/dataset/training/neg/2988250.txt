Viral infections in atopic dermatitis.

Strannegård O, Strannegård IL, Rystedt I.

In a study of almost 1000 patients with past or present atopic dermatitis (AD) it
was found that histories of recurrent (greater than 5 episodes/year) cold sores
and upper respiratory infections, as well as histories of zoster were
significantly more common in AD patients than in non-atopic controls. Serological
studies revealed that AD patients have clearly elevated titers of antibodies
against Epstein-Barr virus. These findings suggest that the increased
susceptibility to viral infections in AD is due to immune dysfunction rather than
to cutaneous alterations which are associated with the disease. The mechanisms
underlying the increased susceptibility to infections may be related to
immunological aberrations that are secondary to a basic abnormality in the fatty 
acid or cyclic AMP metabolism.
