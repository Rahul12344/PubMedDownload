Separation of a Soluble Antigen and Infectious Particles of Bovine Viral Diarrhea
Viruses and their Relationship to Hog Cholera.

Gutekunst DE, Malmquist WA.

A soluble antigen present in infectious tissue culture fluids was separated from 
the infective virus particle by ultracentrifugation of two serologically related 
strains of bovine viral diarrhea viruses, NADL-MD and Oregon C24V. Neutralizing
antibodies against the two viruses were absent in four hog cholera antisera, but 
present in significant titer in the commercially prepared antiserum. Precipitin
tests utilizing the agar double diffusion technique formed a single line of
identity between the concentrated soluble antigen of both viruses and NADL-MD and
hog cholera antisera. No lines were observed using concentrated virus pellet and 
noninfected BEK cell antigens or control SPF calf and swine sera.
