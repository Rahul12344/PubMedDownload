A variety of viral infections are associated with hypercoagulable states and may 
be linked to the development of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
The Zika and Chikungunya viral infections spread through the South and Central
American continents, moving to North America in 2016, with severe cases of
polyarthralgia, fever, and Guillain-Barré syndrome leading eventually to death. A
decreased trend for both infections was reported in the first quarter of 2017. In
this article, we report the possible association of venous thromboembolic events 
associated with Zika infection. After 2 cases of deep venous thrombosis in
patients with acute Zika infections, D-dimer levels were measured in 172
consecutive patients who presented to the emergency department of a university
hospital in an endemic region of Brazil with either Zika or Chikungunya
infections confirmed by polymerase chain reaction tests. D-dimer levels were
increased in 19.4% of 31 patients with Zika and in 63.8% of 141 patients with
Chikungunya infections. The mechanisms behind this association are yet to be
elucidated as well as the potential for venous thromboembolism prevention
strategies for in-hospital patients affected by Zika and Chikungunya infections.
