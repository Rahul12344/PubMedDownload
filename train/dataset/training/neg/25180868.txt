OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influence of liver function on pregnancy outcome of
women who are infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and who receive
individualized nutrition management during the perinatal period.
METHODS: A total of 210 pregnant women were enrolled for study between January
2011 and July 2013. The women were divided into the following groups according to
self-selected participation in individualized nutritional treatment and
management plans (n =87, observation group) or in routine prenatal care without
any nutrition management plan (n =123, control group). Inter-group differences in
pregnancy complications, liver function and perinatal outcome were assessed
statistically.
RESULTS: The following pregnancy complications were recorded during the
study:hypertension disorder, gestational diabetes, anemia and fetal growth
restriction; however, the rates of these complications were significantly lower
in the observation group than in the control group (P less than 0.05). The
observation group also had significantly lower incidence rates of preterm labor, 
fetal distress and neonatal asphyxia (P less than 0.05). The observation group
also had significantly lower proportions of hypoalbuminemia and abnormal liver
function, and correlation analysis indicated that birth weight is correlated with
the pregnant woman's energy and protein intake.
CONCLUSION: Women with HBV can benefit from individualized nutrition management
during the prenatal period, experiencing improved pregnancy outcome and reduced
occurrence of pregnancy complications. The application of individualized and
balanced nutrition management had no effect on fetal growth and development.
