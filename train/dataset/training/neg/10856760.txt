A single-step surface plasmon resonance protocol for the detection of antibodies 
against herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 (HSV-1, HSV-2) in human sera was
established using the BIAcore system. Two peptides from corresponding segments of
the N-terminus of HSV-1 and HSV-2 glycoprotein B (gB), i.e. peptide gB-1 (60-73) 
(GAAPTGDPKPKKNK) and peptide gB-2 (55-68) (SPATTKARKRKTKK), were identified as
immunogenic. Employing both peptides as diagnostic antigens in the surface
plasmon resonance assay, a sensitivity for the detection of HSV-1 and HSV-2
type-specific antibodies of 83 and 86%, respectively, was achieved as compared
with immunoblotting as a reference method. Peptide gB-1 (60-73) allowed the
discrimination between HSV-1 and HSV-2 type-specific antibodies with a
specificity of 67%, whereas peptide gB-2 (55-68) reacted in a strictly HSV-2
type-specific manner. It is concluded that peptides from the N-terminus of gB-1
and gB-2 are recognized predominantly by human sera in an HSV-specific manner.
Peptide gB-2 (55-68) can be employed successfully for the determination of
type-specific antibodies against HSV-2.
