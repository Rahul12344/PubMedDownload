AIM: The study aims to analyze the incidence, clinical features, investigation
findings and treatment outcomes of anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor
encephalitis in children from Hong Kong.
METHOD: A retrospective study was carried out on paediatric patients diagnosed
with anti-NMDAR encephalitis in Hong Kong from January 2009 to December 2015.
RESULTS: Fifteen patients (67% female, 93% Chinese) were identified over seven
years and the estimated incidence in Hong Kong was 2.2/million children per year 
(95% CI 1.2-3.6). The median age of presentation was 12 years (range 1-17 years).
The most common symptom groups observed were abnormal psychiatric behavior or
cognitive dysfunction (14/15, 93%) and seizures (14/15, 93%), followed by speech 
dysfunction (13/15, 87%), movement disorders (12/15, 80%), decreased level of
consciousness (10/15, 67%) and autonomic dysfunction or central hypoventilation
(5/15, 33%). The median number of symptom groups developed in each patient was 5 
(range 3-6). All patients were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and/or
steroids. Three patients (20%) with more severe presentation required additional 
plasmapheresis and rituximab. Outcome was assessable in 14 patients. Among those 
eleven patients who had only received intravenous immunoglobulin and/or steroids,
nine patients (82%) achieved full recovery. One patient (9%) had residual
behavioral problem, while another one (9%) who developed anti-NMDAR encephalitis 
after herpes simplex virus encephalitis was complicated with dyskinetic cerebral 
palsy and epilepsy. Among those three patients who required plasmapheresis and
rituximab, one (33%) had full recovery and two (66%) had substantial recovery.
The median duration of follow up was 20.5 months (range 3-84 months).
CONCLUSION: Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is an acquired, severe, but potentially
treatable disorder. Ethnicity may play a role in the incidence of anti-NMDAR
encephalitis and we have provided a local incidence with the majority of patients
being Chinese. The diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis should be considered in
children presenting with a constellation of symptoms including psychiatric and
neurological manifestations. Patients may respond to first line immunotherapy.
For those who do not, second line therapy is indicated in order to achieve a
better outcome.
