Both CD4+ and CD8+ CTL responses specific for the HIV-1 envelope proteins can be 
elicited in seronegative humans by candidate AIDS vaccines. The phenotype of the 
responding CTL depends upon the nature of the vaccine, with CD8+ CTL being found 
exclusively in recipients of live virus vaccines. Both types of CTL are active
against HIV-1-infected cells in vitro. However, the potential efficacy of
vaccine-induced CTL in preventing infection in vaccinated individuals exposed to 
HIV-1 is unknown and is likely to be dependent upon complex factors including
lytic activity against divergent strains, cytokines produced, and the lysis of
noninfected CD4+ T cells.
