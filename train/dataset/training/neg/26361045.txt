PD-L1 is remarkably over-expressed in EBV-associated pulmonary
lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma and related to poor disease-free survival.

BACKGROUD: Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and driver mutations are
commonly seen in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the prevelance of
PD-L1 over-expression and its prognostic value in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
associated pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) remains poorly
understood.
METHODS: A total of 214 NSCLC patients and 113 surgically treated pulmonary LELC 
patients were included. Paraffin-embedded tumor sections were stained with PD-L1 
antibody. Correlations between PD-L1 expression and clinicopathological features 
as well as survival outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: The frequency of PD-L1 over-expression in NSCLC was 51.4%. No
significant association was observed between common driver mutations and PD-L1
over-expression. Remakably, the positive rate of PD-L1 in pulmonary LELC was
74.3%. High PD-L1 expression was associated with impaired disease-free survival
(DFS) compared with low PD-L1 expression (p = 0.008). Multivariate analysis shows
that PD-L1 expression level, N stage and M stage were independent prognostic
factors for DFS. N stage and M stage but not PD-L1 expression level were
significantly associated with overall survival (OS).
CONCLUSIONS: PD-L1 over-expression was not related to common driver mutations in 
NSCLC. Pulmonary LELC have remarkably high incidence of PD-L1 expression. PD-L1
was a negative prognostic factor for DFS in surgically resected pulmonary LELC.
These findings may provide a rationale for immunotarget therapy in this
virus-associated lung cancer.
