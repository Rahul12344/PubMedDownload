Suicide cancer gene therapy with retroviral vector-producing cells was in the way
of an adjuvant to the surgical resection of recurrent glioblastoma, although any 
benefit appeared to be marginal. It is likely that this therapeutic approach may 
have better outcomes if the vectors and transgenes are delivered more efficiently
to the tumor cells. We have shown previously that tumor cells engineered by
adenovirus-retrovirus hybrid vectors to produce retroviral progeny destroy
satellite tumor cells. Whether the systemic delivery of vector-producing cells
can effectively treat aggressive tumors remains to be determined. Effective
retroviral vector delivery vehicles may be multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells 
(MSCs), which have been shown to home to tumor cells in vivo and deliver
cancer-killing gene or immune products with minimal host rejection. Therefore, it
may be possible to transduce tumors with recombinant progeny vectors delivered by
MSCs. This may be particularly suitable for treating diffuse cancers like
glioblastoma multiforme. While this strategy remains to be tested in various
orthotopic or metastatic tumor models, it has the potential to greatly improve
the outcome of suicide gene therapy.
