A defined in vitro DNA packaging system of phage T3, which is composed of
purified proheads and two packaging proteins, the products of genes 18 and 19
(gp18 and gp19, respectively), displayed a DNA-dependent ATPase activity. ATP was
hydrolyzed to ADP and Pi. The ATPase activity was stimulated by nonpackageable
DNA, such as single-stranded or circular DNA, or RNA (nonpac-ATPase). Among the
inhibitors of DNA packaging, actinomycin D specifically inhibited the ATPase
activity that was tightly coupled to DNA packaging (pac-ATPase), but did not
inhibit the nonpac-ATPase activity. Both activities depended upon a functional
packaging complex, but the nonpac-ATPase, once activated, did not require DNA.
Unpackageable pUC18 DNA inhibited the pac-ATPase and the phage yield in parallel.
Approximately one molecule of ATP was hydrolyzed during the translocation of 1.8 
bp of T3 DNA.
