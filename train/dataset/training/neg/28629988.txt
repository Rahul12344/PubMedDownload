The henipaviruses Nipah virus and Hendra virus are highly pathogenic zoonotic
paramyxoviruses which have caused fatal outbreaks of encephalitis and respiratory
disease in humans. Despite the availability of a licensed equine Hendra virus
vaccine and a neutralizing monoclonal antibody shown to be efficacious against
henipavirus infections in non-human primates, there remains no approved
therapeutics or vaccines for human use. To explore the possibility of developing 
small-molecule nucleoside inhibitors against henipaviruses, we evaluated the
antiviral activity of 4'-azidocytidine (R1479), a drug previously identified to
inhibit flaviviruses, against henipaviruses along with other representative
members of the family Paramyxoviridae. We observed similar levels of R1479
antiviral activity across the family, regardless of virus genus. Our brief study 
expands the documented range of viruses susceptible to R1479, and provides the
basis for future investigation and development of 4'-modified nucleoside analogs 
as potential broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics across both positive and
negative-sense RNA virus families.
