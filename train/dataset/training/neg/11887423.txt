Hydropericardium hepatitis syndrome in broiler chickens is an acute, infectious
disease characterized by high mortality, excess pericardial fluid and multifocal 
hepatic necrosis. The aetiological agent was purified to homogeneity from
infected liver tissues from field outbreaks. Electron-microscopic and serological
confirmation of the virus were undertaken and the disease was reproduced
experimentally in broiler chicks. The results indicated that an adenovirus, fowl 
adenovirus serotype 4, was alone responsible for the disease in the materials
studied.
