We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature from 1966 to 2005
to determine whether animals could provide early warning of a bioterrorism
attack, serve as markers for ongoing exposure risk, and amplify or propagate a
bioterrorism outbreak. We found evidence that, for certain bioterrorism agents,
pets, wildlife, or livestock could provide early warning and that for other
agents, humans would likely manifest symptoms before illness could be detected in
animals. After an acute attack, active surveillance of wild or domestic animal
populations could help identify many ongoing exposure risks. If certain
bioterrorism agents found their way into animal populations, they could spread
widely through animal-to-animal transmission and prove difficult to control. The 
public health infrastructure must look beyond passive surveillance of acute
animal disease events to build capacity for active surveillance and intervention 
efforts to detect and control ongoing outbreaks of disease in domestic and wild
animal populations.
