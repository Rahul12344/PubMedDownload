We report a primary non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma of the urethra in a 78-year-old
female. Serum antibodies for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were negative, but there
was a 40-fold increase in antibodies to EBV-associated nuclear antigen. Using PCR
and in situ hybridization techniques, EBV genome was found in the tumour cell
nuclei.
