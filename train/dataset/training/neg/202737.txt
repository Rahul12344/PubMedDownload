Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of visna virus polypeptides isolated by
agarose gel chromatography.

Lin FH.

The proteins of visna are separated into nine major peaks by agarose gel
chromatography in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl). The polypeptides in eack
peak were isolated by acid precipitation and analyzed by sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The patterns of SDS-PAGE
show that the excluded material from the GuHCl column contains an aggregate of 10
non-glycosylated polypeptides. It is shown that this aggregate represents virus
substructures that are not completely solubilized by GuHCl. Two glycoproteins,
gp175 and gp115, were isolated from the column eluate. The major glycoprotein
gp115 was coeluted with P90, P68, and P61 in GuHCl 4. Each of the four major
peaks (GuHCl 5 to 8) contains more than one nonglycosylated polypeptide. However,
a small polypeptide, P12, can be isolated in a homogeneous form in the last peak,
GuHCl 9. Analysis of the virus proteins (100 microgram) by SDS-PAGE shows that 20
radioactive bands can be recognized. During fractionation of the protein on
agarose gel columns followed by analysis with SDS-PAGE, a number of minor
polypeptides that were not detected before became clearly recognizable. Thus, the
combined use of column chromatography and SDS-PAGE shows that visna virus is
composed of 25 proteins.
