Eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) is the only cellular protein known to
contain the unusual amino acid hypusine. The exact in vivo function of eIF-5A,
however, is to date unknown. The finding that eIF-5A is an essential cofactor of 
the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Rev RNA transport factor
suggested that eIF-5A is part of a specific nuclear export pathway. In this study
we used indirect immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy to
demonstrate that eIF-5A accumulates at nuclear pore-associated intranuclear
filaments in mammalian cells and Xenopus oocytes. We are able to show that eIF-5A
interacts with the general nuclear export receptor, CRM1. Furthermore,
microinjection studies in somatic cells revealed that eIF-5A is transported from 
the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and that this nuclear export is blocked by
leptomycin B. Our data demonstrate that eIF-5A is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle
protein.
