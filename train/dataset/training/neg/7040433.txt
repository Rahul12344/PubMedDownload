Changes in the expression of membrane antigens during the differentiation of
chicken erythroblasts.

Hayman MJ, Beug H, Savin KW.

Chicken erythroblasts can be transformed by the avian retrovirus, avian
erythroblastosis virus (AEV). Earlier studies have shown that the mechanism of
transformation appears to involve a "block" in differentiation, in that when
erythroblasts are transformed by a temperature-sensitive mutant of ts34 AEV and
incubated at the nonpermissive temperature, the cells start to differentiate and 
produce hemoglobin. We have decided to use this system to isolate pure
populations of chicken erythroblasts and raise monoclonal antibodies against
their cell surface proteins. Three monoclonal antibodies were isolated and tested
for their ability to bind to various hematopoietic cell types; two were shown to 
be erythroid-specific, whereas the other antibody bound to proliferating cells
but not to erythrocytes or granulocytes. Of the erythroid-specific antibodies,
one precipitated a 94,000 molecular weight protein, whereas the other
precipitated a 11,000 molecular weight protein that was tentatively identified as
hemoglobin. The use of this system and approach to identify and evaluate changes 
that occur during the differentiation is discussed.
