Since late 2003, highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A viruses have spread among
poultry and wild aquatic birds in Asian countries. Transmission of these viruses 
to humans can be lethal. Most human cases of infection with H5N1 viruses have
occurred in Vietnam. Therefore, to understand the pathogenicity in mammals of
these H5N1 viruses, we took viruses isolated from poultry (5 strains) and humans 
(2 strains) in Vietnam and tested their virulence in mice. The results showed
that the H5N1 viruses from humans were pathogenic in mice and that one avian
isolate was also pathogenic. These findings suggested that the H5N1 viruses
circulating in poultry adapted during replication in humans or that strains
pathogenic in mice were transmitted directly to humans.
