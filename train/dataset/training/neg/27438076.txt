Avian leukosis virus (ALV) is an avian oncogenic retrovirus that can induce
various clinical tumors. The capsid protein P27 is the group-specific antigen of 
ALV and has many viral antigen sites that are easy to detect. In this study, we
produced a monoclonal antibody (mAb), 3A9, that is specific for the P27 protein. 
A series of partially overlapping peptides were screened to define
(181)PPSAR(185) as the minimal linear epitope recognized by mAb 3A9. The
identified epitope could be recognized by chicken anti-ALV and mouse anti-ALV P27
sera. The epitope was highly conserved among a number of ALV-A, ALV-B and ALV-J
strains. MAb 3A9 might be a valuable tool for the development of new
immunodiagnostic approaches for ALV, and the defined linear epitope might help
further our understanding of the antigenic structure of the P27 protein.
