Bifunctional magnetic nanobeads (bi-MBs) were fabricated by co-immobilizing
target recognition molecules and signal molecules on a magnetic nanobead surface,
which were used as both separation and enrichment carriers and signal carriers.
The bi-MBs could capture and separate avian influenza A (H7N9) virus (H7N9 AIV)
from complex samples efficiently based on the specific reaction between
antigen-antibody and their good magnetic response, which simplified sample
pretreatment and saved the detection time. Taking advantages of their high
surface to volume ratio and rich surface functional groups, multiple alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) signal molecules were tethered on the surface of bi-MBs which
greatly amplified the detection signal. As an efficient signal amplification
strategy, enzyme-induced metallization had been integrated with bi-MBs and anodic
stripping voltammetry to construct an ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor
for H7N9 AIV detection. Under the optimal conditions, the introduction of bi-MBs 
could amplify the detection signal in about four times compared with the same
immunoassay without MBs, and the method showed a wide linear range of 0.01-20
ng/mL with a detection limit of 6.8 pg/mL. The electrochemical immunosensor
provides a simple and reliable platform with high sensitivity and selectivity
which shows great potential in early diagnosis of diseases.
