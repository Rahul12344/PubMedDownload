BACKGROUND: The virulence and pathogenicity of different influenza strains are
responsible for a more or less severe disease. Recent studies have attempted to
understand how host genetic factors may influence the clinical presentation of
the disease. In the present study, the His131Arg (rs1801274) polymorphism was
investigated in individuals from a Brazilian admixed population with a diagnosis 
of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection.
METHODS: In the present study, the influence of the His131Arg (rs1801274)
polymorphism, a variant of the FCGR2A gene, was investigated in 436 patients with
a diagnosis of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, evaluated at health services in the
northern and northeastern regions of Brazil between June 2009 and August 2010.
Patients were divided into a group of non-hospitalized patients (n = 192) and a
group of hospitalized patients (n = 244; 100 of them died).
RESULTS: No significant difference in the allele or genotype frequencies of the
rs1801274 polymorphism was observed between groups (p = 0.952 and p = 0.388).
Multinomial logistic regression showed no effect of the rs1801274 polymorphism on
severity or death of patients from the Brazilian admixed population (p = 0.368
and p = 0.469).
CONCLUSIONS: The rs1801274 polymorphism is not associated with severe disease in 
patients infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.
