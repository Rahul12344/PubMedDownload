Sequences of the open reading frames encoding adenovirus type 4 (Ad4) DNA
polymerase and the terminal protein precursor were determined. Sequence
comparisons with the corresponding genes and proteins from Ad2 and Ad5 show high 
overall identity, but significant differences in those portions of the two
proteins thought to be essential for their biological activities. Both Ad4
proteins were functionally expressed in insect cells from the corresponding
cDNAs.
