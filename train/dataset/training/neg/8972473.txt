Reports connect Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) with various types
of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and body-cavity-based lymphomas (primary effusion
lymphomas). KSHV DNA sequences have also been detected in a few non-KS malignant 
vascular tumors. To determine whether KSHV is associated with malignant vascular 
tumors involving the body cavities, 11 primary vascular tumors of the serous
membranes (4 angiosarcomas, 7 hemangioendotheliomas) were tested for KSHV
sequences by polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot hybridization. The
tumors were from patients who were not known to be immunocompromised. KSHV
sequences were detected in the penile KS control but were absent in all 11
specimens studied. Our results were consistent with previous reports that KSHV
sequences were rarely detected in non-KS vascular lesions. The results also
suggested that although KSHV sequences might be present in primary effusion
tumors such as primary effusion lymphoma, they might not be found in other tumors
related to body cavities or to serous membranes.
