Ultracentrifugation, particularly the use of sucrose or cesium chloride density
gradients, is a highly reliable and efficient technique for the purification of
virus-like particles and protein cages. Since virus-like particles and protein
cages have a unique size compared to cellular macromolecules and organelles, the 
rate of migration can be used as a tool for purification. Here we describe a
detailed protocol for the purification of recently discovered virus-like
assemblies called bacterial encapsulins from Thermotoga maritima and
Brevibacterium linens.
