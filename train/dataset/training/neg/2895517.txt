We determined the prevalence of antibody to cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the sera of 
non-homosexual hemophilia patients and homosexual men infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). CMV antibody testing by latex
agglutination revealed 33 of 58 HIV-1 infected hemophiliacs (57%) were
antibody-positive compared with 54 of 54 HIV-1 infected asymptomatic
non-hemophiliac homosexuals (100%) (p less than .001). Nine of 15 hemophiliacs
(60%) with symptomatic HIV-1 infection were CMV antibody-positive. We also tested
22 HIV-1 antibody-negative hemophiliacs who had received non-heat treated factor 
concentrates. 14 of these 22 (64%) were CMV antibody-positive compared with 57%
of HIV-1 antibody-positive hemophiliacs. We conclude 1) there is little
correlation between transmission of HIV-1 and CMV by factor concentrates, 2) the 
presence of CMV antibody does not appear to be associated with clinical stage of 
HIV-1 infection in hemophiliacs, and 3) there may be a significant number of CMV 
antibody-negative hemophiliacs with HIV-1 infection at risk for primary infection
and subsequent disease if CMV seronegative blood products are not provided for
future transfusions.
