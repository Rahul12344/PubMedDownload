Six Welsh Mountain pony colts were infected intranasally with the Ab4 isolate of 
EHV-1. Clinical and virological monitoring demonstrated mild upper respiratory
tract disease, with nasal shedding of virus and establishment of a
cell-associated viraemia. Detailed pathological examination of the urogenital
tract was performed post mortem on days 4-9 post-infection (PI). EHV-1 was
isolated from the epididymis on day 8 and the testis on day 9 PI, with viral
replication in endothelial cells of these organs and an associated necrotizing
vasculitis and thrombosis. Productive viral infection of germinal epithelium was 
not observed. In a further study, three Welsh Mountain pony stallions were
infected intranasally with Ab4, which again resulted in mild upper respiratory
tract disease and the establishment of a cell-associated viraemia. Semen samples 
were collected up to day 60 PI. Two stallions showed a decrease in the proportion
of morphologically normal sperm. Significant numbers of inflammatory cells were
observed in the sperm-rich fraction of ejaculates collected from one stallion
between days 16 and 28 PI; infectious virus was recovered from the semen of this 
animal between days 17 and 25 PI, after the cessation of viraemia. The affected
stallion appeared clinically normal over the period of venereal EHV-1 shedding.
