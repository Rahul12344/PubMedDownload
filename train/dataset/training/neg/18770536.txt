The atomic force microscope (AFM) is an important tool for studying biological
samples due to its ability to image surfaces under liquids. The AFM operates by
physical interaction of a cantilever tip with the molecules on the cell surface. 
Adhesion forces between the tip and cell surface molecules are detected as
cantilever deflections. Thus, the cantilever tip can be used to image live cells 
with atomic resolution and to probe single molecular events in living cells under
physiological conditions. Currently, this is the only technique available that
directly provides structural, mechanical, and functional information at high
resolution. This unit presents the basic AFM components, modes of operation,
useful tips for sample preparation, and a short review of AFM applications in
microbiology.
