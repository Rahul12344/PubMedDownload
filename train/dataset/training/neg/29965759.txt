A novel series of 2,4-diaminoquinazolines was identified as potent dual Toll-like
receptor (TLR) 7 and 8 agonists with reduced off-target activity. The
stereochemistry of the amino alcohol was found to influence the TLR7/8
selectivity with the ( R) isomer resulting in selective TLR8 agonism. Lead
optimization toward a dual agonist afforded (
S)-3-((2-amino-8-fluoroquinazolin-4-yl)amino)hexanol 31 as a potent analog, being
structurally different from previously described dual agonists ( McGowan J. Med. 
Chem. 2016 , 59 , 7936 ). Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies
revealed the desired high first pass profile aimed at limiting systemic cytokine 
activation. In vivo pharmacodynamic studies with lead compound 31 demonstrated
production of cytokines consistent with TLR7/8 activation in mice and cynomolgus 
monkeys and ex vivo inhibition of hepatitis B virus (HBV).
