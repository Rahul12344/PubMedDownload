Current recombinant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gp120 protein vaccine
candidates are unable to elicit antibodies capable of neutralizing infectivity of
primary isolates from patients. Here, "fusion-competent" HIV vaccine immunogens
were generated that capture the transient envelope-CD4-coreceptor structures that
arise during HIV binding and fusion. In a transgenic mouse immunization model,
these formaldehyde-fixed whole-cell vaccines elicited antibodies capable of
neutralizing infectivity of 23 of 24 primary HIV isolates from diverse geographic
locations and genetic clades A to E. Development of these fusion-dependent
immunogens may lead to a broadly effective HIV vaccine.
