Cleavage of Epstein-Barr virus DNA by restriction endonucleases EcoRI, HindIII
and BamI.

Rymo L, Forsblom S.

The cleavage of the DNAs of the B95-8 and P3HR-1 virus strains of Epstein-Barr
virus by the restriction endonucleases EcoRI, HindIII and BamI was investigated
using a new technique for quantitative evaluation of the fluorescence of ethidium
stained DNA fragments separated on agarose gels. The results obtained with B95-8 
DNA showed that in addition to the limited repetitions of nucleotide sequences
observed in the EcoRI and HindIII cleavage patterns, the molecule contained a
BamI fragment with a molecular mass of 2.0 megadaltons which was present in a
total of about 11 copies and localized to a limited part of the DNA molecule. The
same sequences were also present in the P3HR-1 DNA albeit in a lower molar ratio.
P3HR-1 DNA yielded restriction enzyme cleavage patterns suggesting DNA sequence
heterogeneity of P3HR-1 virus. No fragment was present in more than about 4
copies per molecule of P3HR-1 DNA. Comparison of the restriction enzyme cleavage 
patterns of P3HR-1 and B95-8 DNA revealed a high degree of structural homology
emphasized by nucleic acid hybridization experiments with EBV complementary RNA
synthesized in vitro.
