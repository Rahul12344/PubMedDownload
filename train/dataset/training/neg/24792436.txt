Tylvalosin, a new broad-spectrum, third-generation macrolides, may exert a
variety of pharmacological activities. Here, we report on its anti-oxidative and 
anti-inflammatory activity in RAW 264.7 macrophages and mouse treated with
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as well as piglet challenged with porcine reproductive
and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). Tylvalosin treatment markedly decreased
IL-8, IL-6, IL-1β, PGE2, TNF-α and NO levels in vitro and in vivo. LPS and
PRRSV-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and the lipid
peroxidation in mice lung tissues reduced after tylvalosin treatments. In mouse
acute lung injury model induced by LPS, tylvalosin administration significantly
attenuated tissues injury, and reduced the inflammatory cells recruitment and
activation. The evaluated phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity and the increased
expressions of cPLA2-IVA, p-cPLA2-IVA and sPLA2-IVE were lowered by tylvalosin.
Consistent with the mouse results, tylvalosin pretreatment attenuated piglet lung
scores with improved growth performance and normal rectal temperature in piglet
model induced by PRRSV. Furthermore, tylvalosin attenuated the IκBα
phosphorylation and degradation, and blocked the NF-κB p65 translocation. These
results indicate that in addition to its direct antimicrobial effect, tylvalosin 
exhibits anti-inflammatory property and attenuates acute lung injury through
suppression of NF-κB activation.
