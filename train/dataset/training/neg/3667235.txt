Upon sequencing of the SpV4 genome, eight putative open reading frames (ORFs)
including that for the 65-kilodalton (kDa) capsid protein were detected. They
involve all three reading frames. Three promoter sequences were found, as well as
a transcription terminator and the initiation site for complementary strand
synthesis. Ribosome binding sites and regulatory sequences are closely related to
those of Eubacteria. Codon usage analysis showed that A and T terminated codons
are preferably used. UAA is the major termination codon. Upon cloning of the
full-size SpV4 replicative form, the capsid protein gene could not be expressed
in Escherichia coli, whereas the spiralin gene cloned in the same bacterium is
expressed. These results suggest that in spiroplasmas, as in Mycoplasma
capricolum, UGA is not a termination codon, but very probably codes for
tryptophan. Spiralin contains no tryptophan. Hence, its gene contains no UGA
codons and can thus be expressed in E. coli. On the other hand, the gene for
capsid protein has nine UGA codons and cannot be fully expressed in the
bacterium. Our results fully support the bacterial origin of spiroplasmas.
