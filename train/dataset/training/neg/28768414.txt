Myeloid cells play a central role in the context of viral eradication, yet
precisely how these cells differentiate throughout the course of acute infections
is poorly understood. In this study, we have developed a novel quantitative
temporal in vivo proteomics (QTiPs) platform to capture proteomic signatures of
temporally transitioning virus-driven myeloid cells directly in situ, thus taking
into consideration host-virus interactions throughout the course of an infection.
QTiPs, in combination with phenotypic, functional, and metabolic analyses,
elucidated a pivotal role for inflammatory CD11b+, Ly6G-, Ly6Chigh-low cells in
antiviral immune response and viral clearance. Most importantly, the
time-resolved QTiPs data set showed the transition of CD11b+, Ly6G-, Ly6Chigh-low
cells into M2-like macrophages, which displayed increased antigen-presentation
capacities and bioenergetic demands late in infection. We elucidated the pivotal 
role of myeloid cells in virus clearance and show how these cells phenotypically,
functionally, and metabolically undergo a timely transition from inflammatory to 
M2-like macrophages in vivo. With respect to the growing appreciation for in vivo
examination of viral-host interactions and for the role of myeloid cells, this
study elucidates the use of quantitative proteomics to reveal the role and
response of distinct immune cell populations throughout the course of virus
infection.
