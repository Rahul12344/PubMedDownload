We developed an in vitro cleaving assay for the thymidylate synthase (td) group I
intron and observed that the off-rate of the substrate is faster than cleavage.
From the sequence stems P1 and P2 can vary from 4 to 8 and from 6 to 10 base
pairs, respectively, with folding of a long P1 stem being in competition with
folding of a long P2 stem. Shorter substrates, which cannot compete with the
formation of an extended P2, result in faster cleavage, suggesting that binding
of the substrate indeed interferes with folding of stem P2. In vivo splicing
analyses of mutants containing alterations in stems P1 and P2 indicate that the
wild-type exon sequence of P1 is suboptimal for splicing. Furthermore, folding of
P1 in vivo is in competition with an alternative cryptic P1 stem resulting in
mis-splicing. Translation promotes splicing at the correct 5' splice site,
whereas in the absence of translation, mis-splicing is favored. The combination
of the in vitro and in vivo assays clearly displays the folding problems for
correct splice site selection in this group I intron.
