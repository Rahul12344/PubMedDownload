BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data evaluating antibiotic use in anterior
skull-base surgery (ASBS). The goal of this study was to determine antibiotic
prescribing patterns and factors that influence antibiotic use in ASBS.
METHODS: An online-based survey was distributed to the membership of the North
American Skull Base Society in 2018. Outcomes included practitioner preference
regarding intraoperative and postoperative antibiotic use, practice location and 
environment, surgeon experience, and patient factors influencing antibiotic use.
RESULTS: There were 208 respondents (25.6% response rate) of which 182 (87.5%)
performed ASBS; 60.4% were in academic institutions. Respondents were
neurosurgeons (59.3%) or otolaryngologists (40.7%), and 75.3% were
fellowship-trained in ASBS. Most surgeons (95.0%) gave intraoperative
antibiotics. Academic surgeons were 4 times more likely to prescribe
intraoperative antibiotics than private practitioners (odds ratio [OR] 3.98; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.53 to 10.36; p = 0.005). Among surgeons who did not
routinely prescribe intraoperative antibiotics, regression analysis indicated
that the presence of actively infected sinuses, transplantation, diabetes, human 
immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), and
pulmonary disease influenced decision-making (p < 0.03). Postoperative
antibiotics were prescribed by 73.6% of respondents. European surgeons were 3
times less likely to prescribe postoperative antibiotics (OR 0.34; 95% CI, 0.15
to 0.80; p = 0.01). Regression modeling indicated that HIV/AIDS, cystic fibrosis,
diabetes, transplantation, and pulmonary disease, as well as the use of
absorbable packing influenced the decision to use postoperative antibiotics (p < 
0.003).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the significant variation in intra- and
postoperative antibiotic use among surgeons performing ASBS. Prospective
randomized studies are necessary to establish evidence-based practice guidelines 
for perioperative antibiotic use in ASBS.
