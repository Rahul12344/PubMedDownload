The feasibility of applying molecular phylogenetic methods of analysis to aligned
coat-protein sequences and other molecular data derived from coat proteins or
genomic sequences of members of the proposed taxonomic family of Potyviridae, is 
discussed. We show that comparative sequence analysis of whole coat-protein
sequences may be used reliably to differentiate between sequences of closely
related strains, and to show groupings of more distantly related viruses; that
coat proteins of putative Potyviridae cluster according to the proposed generic
divisions, and, even if some are only very distantly related, the members of the 
family form a cluster distinct from coat proteins of other filamentous and
rod-shaped viruses. Taxonomic revisions based on perceived evolutionary
relationships, and the lack of feasibility of erecting higher taxa for these
viruses, are discussed.
