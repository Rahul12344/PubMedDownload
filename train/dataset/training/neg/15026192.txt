We consider simple mathematical models for the early population dynamics of the
human immunodefficiency type 1 virus (HIV-1). Although these systems of
differential equations may be solved by numerical methods, few general
theoretical results are available due to nonlinearities. We analyze a model whose
components are plasma densities of uninfected CD4+ T-cells and infected cells
(assumed in this model to be proportional to virion density). In addition to
analyzing the nature of the equilibrium points, we show that there are no
periodic or limit-cycle solutions. Depending on the values of the parameters,
solutions either tend without oscillation to an equilibrium point with zero
virion density or to an equilibrium point in which there are a nonzero number of 
virions. In the latter case the approach to equilibrium may be through damped
oscillations or without oscillation.
