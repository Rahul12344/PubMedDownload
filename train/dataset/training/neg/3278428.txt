Between 40% and 80% of patients treated with the monoclonal antibody OKT3 develop
blocking antibody against its idiotypic region. Thus a major concern with the use
of OKT3 as part of a baseline immunosuppressive regimen is that formation of
blocking antibodies might preclude its subsequent use. Between 7/86 and 2/87, 32 
patients received prophylactic OKT3 in addition to low-dose prednisone,
azathioprine, and cyclosporine. Prophylactic OKT3 did not prevent rejection, as
21 of 32 patients studied developed rejection. Retreatment of 13 patients with
OKT3 successfully reversed 12 rejections and lowered the number of T3-positive
cells in spite of a low level of blocking antibody in two patients in this group.
Of the patients analyzed, 38% developed blocking antibody on initial exposure to 
OKT3, but OKT3 reuse was denied only 4 patients due to the presence of these
antibodies. Three of these had rejections reversed with steroids alone; the other
patient lost the allograft. A high frequency of infectious complications occurred
in the retreatment group, with viral infections predominating. Only one patient
in the retreated group developed antibodies after the second use. Appearance of
blocking antibodies after use of OKT3 as part of a base-line prophylactic
immunosuppressive regimen did not significantly compromise access to OKT3 for
treatment of subsequent rejection episodes, but multiple exposures to OKT3 did
increase the frequency of infectious complications.
