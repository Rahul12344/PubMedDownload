The HBx protein in Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is a potential target for anti-liver
cancer molecules. Therefore, it is of interest to screen known natural compounds 
against the HBx protein using molecular docking. However, the structure of HBx is
not yet known. Therefore, the predicted structure of HBx using threading in LOMET
was used for docking against plant derived natural compounds (curcumin, oleanolic
acid, resveratrol, bilobetin, luteoline, ellagic acid, betulinic acid and rutin) 
by Molegro Virtual Docker. The screening identified rutin with binding energy of 
-161.65 Kcal/mol. Thus, twenty derivatives of rutin were further designed and
screened against HBx. These in silico experiments identified compounds rutin01
(-163.16 Kcal/mol) and rutin08 (- 165.76 Kcal/mol) for further consideration and 
downstream validation.
