Since their introduction, hepatotoxicity has been associated with the use of
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 protease inhibitors (PIs). However, the
complexity of the HIV-infected patient and the combinations of medications used
to treat HIV complicate the understanding of the independent effects of PIs in
the development of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). I discuss the current
understanding of PI-associated hepatotoxicity. Of the PI regimens studied, the
greatest risk of DILI has been observed among patients receiving full-dose
ritonavir. Similarly, hepatitis B and/or C virus coinfection has been associated 
with a greater risk of DILI, compared with those with no hepatitis. Although the 
specific mechanism by which viral hepatitis increases this risk is not known,
patients with cirrhosis may have decreased cytochrome P450 activity, leading to
increased PI exposure. Clearly, further research is needed to define the
interaction of PIs and chronic viral hepatitis in the development of DILI.
