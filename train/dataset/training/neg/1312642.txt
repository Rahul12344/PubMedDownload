By insertional mutagenesis, human cytomegalovirus recombinants deleted of each of
the US6 glycoprotein family genes were isolated. A recombinant lacking IRS1, US1 
through US5, and most of the US6 family was also isolated. The growth kinetics of
these mutants were similar to that of the wild type. A dispensable cluster of
genes was identified.
