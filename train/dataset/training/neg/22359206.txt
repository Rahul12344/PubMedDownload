Insect cells are widely used for expression of a variety of different proteins by
using the baculovirus expression system. The applicability of this system depends
on production of proteins which have biological properties similar to their
native counterparts. One application has been the expression of viral capsid
proteins and their assembly into empty capsid structures to provide new viral
immunogens which retain complex antigenic sites. An important parameter for
efficient folding and assembly of proteins into viral procapsids may be the
intracellular pH, particularly for acid-labile particles such as foot-and-mouth
disease virus (FMDV). Benzoic acid was used as an effective indicator of
intracellular pH in insect cells and 3-O-methyl glucose to measure cell volumes. 
We have determined the intracellular volume of theSpodoptera frugiperda IPLB-Sf21
insect cells 0.50±0.08 pL per cell. Using the distribution of [(14)C]-benzoic
acid, we show that the intracellular pH remains constant at pH 7.0 when the cells
are grown in media with pH values ranging from 6.2 to 6.8 and, moreover, is not
affected by baculovirus infection. These results suggest that insect cells are
suitable to express and produce acid-labile structures via the baculovirus
expression system and that assembly of proteins and viral procapsids could occur.
