Human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic
paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a slowly progressive, inflammatory disease of the
central nervous system (CNS). We report a patient with transverse myelitis, who
exhibited acute onset and rapid progression of the disease and whose symptoms
resembled those observed in multiple sclerosis with spinal cord presentation.
During neurological exacerbation of the condition, the HTLV-I proviral load in
the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) increased to 10 times that in the peripheral blood.
This suggests that the accumulation of HTLV-I-infected cells in the CNS
contributes to neurological exacerbation. Based on the increased proviral load in
the CSF, we diagnosed the disease as acute progressive HAM/TSP. The measurement
of the HTLV-I proviral load in the CSF is useful for the diagnosis of HAM/TSP and
for monitoring its progression.
