OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of hepatitis C virus core protein on the
infiltration and metastasis of cholangiocarcinoma tissues.
METHODS: From January 2001 to November 2006, 34 patients with cholangiocarcinoma 
who had intact follow-up data randomly were chosen. The expression of HCVc
protein, epithelium markers and mesenchymal markers in cholangiocarcinoma tissues
were examined by SP methods of immunohistochemistry, clinical-pathological data
were recorded and analyzed.
RESULTS: The positive expression rate was observed in 47.1% for HCVc protein, 50%
for N-cadherin, 44.1% for Vimentin, 55.9% for Fibronectin and the decreased
expression rate was E-cadherin for 55.9%, alpha-catenin for 70.6%, beta-catenin
for 55.9%. The positive expression of HCVc protein was associated with the
decreased expression of E-cadherin, alpha-catenin and the positive expression of 
N-cadherin, Vimentin, Fibronectin (chi(2) = 4.480, 4.163, 4.250, 7.438, 12.260, P
< 0.05). A positive-correlation between the expression of HCVc protein and
metastasis of lymph nodes and other organs were found (chi(2) = 5.708, 4.163, P <
0.05).
CONCLUSION: HCVc protein might promote cholangiocarcinoma tissues' infiltration
and metastasis by inducing it's epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
