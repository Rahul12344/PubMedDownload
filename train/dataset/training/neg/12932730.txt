To maximize the production of progeny virions, several viruses have evolved
mechanisms that promote the selective nuclear export of viral mRNA transcripts
while, in some cases, inhibiting the export of cellular mRNAs. To achieve this
goal, viruses have evolved regulatory proteins and cis-acting RNA elements that
selectively interact with key cellular nuclear export factors. Efforts to
identify the cellular targets of these viral proteins and RNA elements have led
to the identification of Crm1 and Tap as essential human nuclear RNA-export
factors and continue to provide insights into how mRNAs are selected for export
