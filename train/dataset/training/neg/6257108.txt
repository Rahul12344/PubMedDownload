Pneumonia: an eleven-year study in a pediatric practice.

Murphy TF, Henderson FW, Clyde WA Jr, Collier AM, Denny FW.

Data from an 11-year study of acute lower respiratory tract illness were analyzed
to provide added insight into the causes and patterns of occurrence of pneumonia 
in an outpatient pediatric population. Over 80% of all episodes of pneumonia
occurred in children less than seven years of age; the peak attack rate was
observed in 2-4-year-old children. A virus or Mycoplasma pneumoniae was isolated 
from 24% of children with pneumonia; 57% of all episodes occurred during
outbreaks for which a viral or mycoplasmal cause could usually be identified.
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses types 1 and 3,
adenoviruses, influenza A viruses and M. pneumoniae accounted for 86% of all
isolates. Attack rates of pneumonia in preschool children were highest during
periods of RSV and influenza A virus prevalence; M. pneumoniae was the most
frequent isolate from school aged children. The data contained in this report
augment the understanding of the causes of pneumonia in children and provide a
data base for scientists interested in the prevention of lower respiratory tract 
illness in children.
