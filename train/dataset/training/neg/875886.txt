The use of RD cells in the isolation of Echo type 30 virus from patients with
aseptic meningitis.

Wecker I.

Between early July and August 1976, 60 cases of aseptic meningitis and
pharyngitis in children from various parts of West Germany were reported to this 
institute. Successful virus isolation from spinal fluid in 12 out of 36 cases was
greatly facilitated by the use of RD cell tissue cultures, whereas isolation
attempts in HEL, Vero, and HFDK cells were unsuccessful. In all cases, the
isolated virus was identified as ECHO type 30. Neutralization studies with sera
of 48 remaining cases also using RD cells clearly indicated that the epidemic
outbreak was caused by ECHO type 30 virus.
