In 1989, African-American and Mexican-American drug users (n = 220) in a small
southern city were interviewed, in street settings, about their HIV behavioral
risks and their readiness to reduce risks. Both ethnic groups contained large
numbers of cocaine and heroin users. Mexican Americans were more likely to use
heroin, prefer injection, and share needles with other drug users than were
African Americans. Sexual risk-taking in both groups was high, with very low
levels of condom use, high levels of exchanging sex for drugs and money, and high
levels of having multiple sexual partners. Mexican Americans were more likely
than African Americans to have regular partners who used drugs. Intravenous drug 
users in both ethnic groups were at high risk for HIV infection, reporting high
levels of multiple drug use, daily drug use, needle sharing, never cleaning
needles, and exchanging sex for drugs or money. Readiness to reduce HIV risks was
also high in both groups, as evidenced by the response to questions about the use
of free preventive services, HIV testing, and concern about AIDS. Implications
for research and preventive programs among minority drug users in small cities
are discussed.
