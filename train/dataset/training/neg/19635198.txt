BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role in the
carcinogenesis of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
beta-catenin protein is a pivotal regulator in the pathway. Genetic mutation has 
been observed in the codons 32-45 at exon 3 of beta-catenin gene in HCC tissues. 
This study was to investigate the correlation of genetic polymorphisms of
beta-catenin to HBV-related HCC.
METHODS: We conducted epidemiologic and genetic investigation in 162 patients
with HBV-related HCC. According to matching requirements, patients with or
without family history of HCC were paired with a ratio of 1:1. Exon 3 of
beta-catenin gene was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA
sequencing. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs28931588, rs28931589, codons
31-46 sequences and genetic investigation were analyzed.
RESULTS: Among the 162 HCC patients, 16 (9.88%) had family history of HCC; 12
patients with family history of HCC and 12 without family history were matched.
The 24 patients all showed G on rs28931588 and rs28931589. Three patients showed 
mutation in codons 32-46 and had genetic polymorphisms. Definite mutational
regularity or characteristic mutational site was not observed.
CONCLUSION: SNP rs28931588, rs28931589 and codons 31-46 sequences may not be the 
genetic markers in HBV-related HCC.
