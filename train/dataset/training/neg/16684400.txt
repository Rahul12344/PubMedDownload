The aim of this paper is to combine different but complementary approaches to
check the neutrality of a given locus in a selected population. Analysis was
undertaken through the polymorphism's evolution compared with that predicted
under the effect of drift and through the analysis of the variance components of 
the measured traits, considering the effect of the locus as either a fixed or a
random effect. This study deals with the case of the MHC locus, using both data
from experimental lines of chicken selected for three different criteria of
immune response, and frequencies of the genotyped haplotypes over time. Both the 
evolution of the polymorphism and the variance components approach have led to
the conclusion that the MHC locus has an effect on the trait affecting antibody
production against the Newcastle disease virus. Results have also highlighted the
interest in using various methods in the case of low allelic frequencies.
However, none of the common hypotheses, overdominance or frequency-dependent
selection, was sufficient to explain the observed variation of the MHC
polymorphism, which was displayed by the temporal variation of the allelic
frequencies.
