AbstractOropouche virus (OROV) is an important cause of arboviral illness in
Latin American countries, more specifically in the Amazon region of Brazil,
Venezuela and Peru, as well as in other countries such as Panama. In the past
decades, the clinical, epidemiological, pathological, and molecular aspects of
OROV have been published and provide the basis for a better understanding of this
important human pathogen. Here, we describe the milestones in a comprehensive
review of OROV epidemiology, pathogenesis, and molecular biology, including a
description of the first isolation of the virus, the outbreaks during the past
six decades, clinical aspects of OROV infection, diagnostic methods, genome and
genetic traits, evolution, and viral dispersal.
