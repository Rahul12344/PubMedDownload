To determine the effect of disinfectants against viruses in vitro, I devised the 
Micro-Carrier-Test of dry-fixed virus-infected cells. Human immunodeficiency
virus type 1-infected Molt-4 cells (1 x 10(5) cells in 5 microliters of 10% fetal
bovine serum) were dry-fixed at the bottom of each well of a 96-well
flat-bottomed microtiter plate for 120 minutes at room temperature. Disinfectants
were added and allowed to remain for designated times and the wells were washed
three times with PBS. Uninfected Molt-4 cells (1 x 10(4) cells/well) were
inoculated and cultured for 4 weeks. The culture supernatant was harvested to
measure reverse transcriptase activity by non-radioisotopic reverse transcriptase
assay every week. Residual cytotoxicity of the disinfectant was determined by
cytotoxicity assay. To evaluate the new method, the virucidal efficacy of several
well-known disinfectants was reevaluated. Dose- and time-dependent effects of the
disinfectants were determined. The minimal effective concentrations after 5
minutes of contact were 20% ethanol, 0.01% glutaraldehyde and 0.1% sodium
hypochlorite. These results are almost the same as those reported previously, but
there are some discrepancies. The differences between the present and previous
protocols are discussed. This Micro-Carrier-Test promises to be useful in the
screening of disinfectants.
