We have measured the fidelity of bidirectional, semiconservative DNA synthesis by
a human DNA replication complex in vitro. Replication was performed by extracts
of HeLa cells in the presence of simian virus 40 (SV40) large tumor antigen by
using a double-stranded phage M13mp2 DNA template containing the SV40 origin of
replication and either of two different target sequences for scoring mutations in
the lacZ alpha-complementation gene, which encodes the alpha region (specifying
the amino-terminal portion) of beta-galactosidase. Replicative synthesis was
substantially more accurate than synthesis by the human DNA polymerase alpha-DNA 
primase complex purified from HeLa cell extracts by immunoaffinity
chromatography, suggesting that additional factors or activities in the extract
may increase fidelity during bidirectional replication. However, by using a
sensitive opal codon reversion assay, single-base substitution errors were
readily detected in the replication products at frequencies significantly higher 
than estimated spontaneous mutation rates in vivo. These data suggest that
additional fidelity factors may be present during chromosomal replication in vivo
and/or that the fidelity of replication alone does not account for the low
spontaneous mutation rates in eukaryotes.
