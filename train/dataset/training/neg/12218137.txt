Despite the accepted role for CD4+ T cells in immune control, little is known
about the development of Ag-specific CD4+ T cell immunity upon primary infection.
Here we use MHC class II tetramer technology to directly visualize the
Ag-specific CD4+ T cell response upon infection of mice with Moloney murine
sarcoma and leukemia virus complex (MoMSV). Significant numbers of Ag-specific
CD4+ T cells are detected both in lymphoid organs and in retrovirus-induced
lesions early during infection, and they express the 1B11-reactive
activation-induced isoform of CD43 that was recently shown to define effector
CD8+ T cell populations. Comparison of the kinetics of the MoMSV-specific CD4+
and CD8+ T cell responses reveals a pronounced shift toward CD8+ T cell immunity 
at the site of MoMSV infection during progression of the immune response.
Consistent with an important early role of Ag-specific CD4+ T cell immunity
during MoMSV infection, CD4+ T cells contribute to the generation of
virus-specific CD8+ T cell immunity within the lymphoid organs and are required
to promote an inflammatory environment within the virus-infected tissue.
