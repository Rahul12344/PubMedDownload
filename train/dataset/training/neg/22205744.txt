Orthopoxviruses include the prototypical vaccinia virus, the emerging infectious 
agent monkeypox virus, and the potential biothreat variola virus (the causative
agent of smallpox). There is currently no FDA-approved drug for humans infected
with orthopoxviruses. We screened a diversity-oriented synthesis library for new 
scaffolds with activity against vaccinia virus. This screen identified a
nonnucleoside analog that blocked postreplicative intermediate and late gene
expression. Viral genome replication was unaffected, and inhibition could be
elicited late in infection and persisted upon drug removal. Sequencing of
drug-resistant viruses revealed mutations predicted to be on the periphery of the
highly conserved viral RNA polymerase large subunit. Consistent with this, the
compound had broad-spectrum activity against orthopoxviruses in vitro. These
findings indicate that novel chemical synthesis approaches are a potential source
for new infectious disease therapeutics and identify a potentially promising
candidate for development to treat orthopoxvirus-infected individuals.
