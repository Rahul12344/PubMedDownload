The purpose of this study is to determine the rate of human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) among commercial blood donors
in the University of Benin Teaching Hospital. Five thousand seven hundred and
thirty-seven prospective commercial blood donors were screened for both HIVand
HBsAg. Three hundred and eighty-three (7%) donors were positive for HIV while 609
donors (11%) were positive for HBsAg. Thirty-seven donors were positive for both 
HIV and HBsAg. The need to make the screening of blood donors for HIV and HBsAg
compulsory in all hospitals is crucial so that the spread of HIV and HBsAg can be
prevented.
