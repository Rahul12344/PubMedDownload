Recently, there have been substantial developments in the understanding of Ebola 
hemorrhagic fever pathogenesis, but there are still major gaps. These infections 
occur in underdeveloped areas of the world, and much of our knowledge of
naturally occurring disease is derived from sporadic outbreaks that occurred
decades in the past. Recently conducted laboratory animal studies have provided
insight into Ebola pathogenesis and may help guide clinical investigations of
disease using contemporary methodologies that were not available previously. A
better understanding of the relevant host and viral factors that influence
clinical and virologic outcome will be critical to our ability to combat this
aggressive pathogen. This article reviews the most relevant information relating 
to the postulated pathogenesis of this disease, focusing on the role of the
endothelium in contributing to the coagulation disorders that characterize Ebola 
hemorrhagic fever in primates. Some of the remaining and key unanswered questions
relating to the role of the vascular system in the pathogenesis of this disease, 
that need to be addressed in further research, are highlighted.
