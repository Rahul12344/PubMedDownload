Surveillance of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was
conducted to explore the possible introduction and circulation of this novel
virus in Catalonia, northeastern Spain. Five hundred and sixty-three samples from
mild and severe respiratory infections collected between January 2012 and April
2013 were screened using real-time RT-PCR. All samples were negative, suggesting 
that MERS-CoV is not circulating silently in Catalonia.
