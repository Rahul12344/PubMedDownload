Musculoskeletal chest wall pain.

Fam AG, Smythe HA.

The musculoskeletal structures of the thoracic wall and the neck are a relatively
common source of chest pain. Pain arising from these structures is often mistaken
for angina pectoris, pleurisy or other serious disorders. In this article the
clinical features, pathogenesis and management of the various musculoskeletal
chest wall disorders are discussed. The more common causes are costochondritis,
traumatic muscle pain, trauma to the chest wall, "fibrositis" syndrome, referred 
pain, psychogenic regional pain syndrome, and arthritis involving articulations
of the sternum, ribs and thoracic spine. Careful analysis of the history,
physical findings and results of investigation is essential for precise diagnosis
and effective treatment.
