The number of human avian H7N9 influenza infections has been increasing in China.
Understanding their antigenic and serologic relationships is crucial for
developing diagnostic tools and vaccines. Here, we evaluated the
cross-reactivities and neutralizing activities among H7 subtype influenza viruses
and between H7N9 and heterosubtype influenza A viruses. We found strong
cross-reactivities between H7N9 and divergent H7 subtypic viruses, including
H7N2, H7N3, and H7N7. Antisera against H7N2, H7N3, and H7N7 could also
effectively neutralize two distinct H7N9 strains. Two-way cross-reactivities
exist within group 2, including H3 and H4, whereas one-way cross-reactivities
were found across other groups, including H1, H10, H9, and H13. Our data indicate
that the hemaglutinins from divergent H7 subtypes may facilitate the development 
of vaccines for distinct H7N9 infections. Moreover, serologic diagnoses for H7N9 
infections need to consider possible interference from the cross-reactivity of
H7N9 with other subtype influenza viruses.
