This case report presents a 1-year-old boy from China, with sudden onset of
fever, convulsion, and sleepiness, screened for viral DNA in blood and
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to
diagnose herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis, further validated by
PCR. After acyclovir treatment, the patient's symptom disappeared and HSV-1 DNA
unique reads decreased from 4290 to zero in CSF, and from 23 to zero in blood
detected by NGS. The clinical presentation and outcome were consistent with the
pathogenic diagnostic results of NGS. NGS of CSF samples can be used as a
diagnostic assay for HSV-1 encephalitis and also might be a semi-quantitative
method for evaluation of treatment effect.
