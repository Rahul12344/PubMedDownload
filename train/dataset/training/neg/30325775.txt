OBJECTIVES: MSM comprise ∼30% of new HIV infections in Israel, a country with
mixed Jewish and Arab populations. We molecularly characterized HIV-1 in the Arab
and Jewish MSM (AMSM, JMSM) populations to reveal possible interethnical
connections.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
METHODS: All Israeli-born, HIV-1-infected MSM diagnosed between 2005 and 2016
(n = 1143) were cross-matched with the National Civil Registry to identify
religion (Jews/Muslims/Christians). Transmitted drug-resistance mutations (TDRM) 
and HIV-1 subtypes were determined on the first partial protease and reverse
transcriptase sequences from treatment-naive patients and phylogenetic trees were
constructed.
RESULTS: Among MSM, 6.4% (73/1143) were Arabs and 93.6% (1070/1143) were Jews.
Interestingly, a higher proportion of Arabs was identified among non-MSM (19%,
46/247 versus 6.4%, 73/1143, P < 0.01). Subtype analysis of 62 HIV-1 AMSM and 440
randomly selected HIV-1 JMSM sequences revealed 80.6, 8.1, 4.8 and 6.5% of AMSM
and 82.3, 9.5, 4.1 and 4.1% of JMSM had B, A, C and non-A/B/C, respectively.
Overall, 13.1% (66/502) had TDRM; reverse transcriptase-K103N/S, M184 V, T215S
and protease-L90M were the most common. TDRM prevalence was not significantly
higher in JMSM compared to AMSM (P = 0.1) and no temporal changes were observed
in their frequency. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated AMSM and JMSM clusters
including L90M, K103N/S or T215S TDRM.
CONCLUSION: Intermingling of AMSM and JMSM HIV-1 in clusters of HIV-1 sequences
suggest interethnical sexual contacts among these MSM. Interventions aiming to
prevent HIV-transmission in MSM should similarly address both populations groups.
The high TDRM frequency requires continuation of resistance testing.
