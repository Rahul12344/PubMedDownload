1. Yellow fever virus has been transmitted from monkey to monkey both by the
bites of Aëdes (Ochlerotatus) scapularis which had fed upon monkeys infected with
yellow fever and by the injection of the ground up bodies of such mosquitoes. 2. 
A fatal infection has been obtained by the injection of the ground up bodies of
Aëdes (Ochlerotatus) serratus, which had previously fed on an infected monkey,
and a mild infection has been secured by the similar injection of Aëdes
(Taeniorhynchus) taeniorhynchus. 3. No definite infection has been secured either
by the bites or by the injection of Culex quinquefasciatus (C. fatigans).
However, some of the experimental animals bitten by this species have been
relatively immune following inoculations of blood or tissues containing virus.
