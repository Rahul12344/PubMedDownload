The UL13 open reading frame of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) has been
expressed in insect cells by a recombinant baculovirus and in Escherichia coli.
In the latter case, the UL13 gene was fused to the gene for glutathione
S-transferase (GST) to allow high-level expression of an 80-kDa GST-UL13 fusion
protein. Antibody raised against the fusion protein reacted specifically with the
55-kDa UL13 gene product expressed by the recombinant baculovirus. This antibody 
also recognized a late phosphoprotein in HSV-1-infected cell lysates and a
component of purified HSV-1 virions, both with the same electrophoretic mobility 
as the baculovirus-expressed protein. The virion component was efficiently
phosphorylated in vitro by a virion-associated protein kinase. Using the same
antibody, the probable homolog of the UL13 gene product was identified in
HSV-2-infected cells and purified virions.
