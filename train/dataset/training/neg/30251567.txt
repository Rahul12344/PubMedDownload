BACKGROUND: New sources of insulin-secreting cells are strongly in demand for
treatment of diabetes. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have the potential 
to generate insulin-producing cells (iβ). However, the gene expression profile
and secretory function of iβ still need to be validated in comparison with native
β cells.
METHODS: Two clones of human iPSCs, reprogrammed from adult fibroblasts through
integration-free Sendai virus, were differentiated into iβ and compared with
donor pancreatic islets and EndoC-βH1, an immortalized human β cell line.
RESULTS: Both clones of iPSCs differentiated into insulin+ cells with high
efficiency (up to 20%). iβ were negative for pluripotency markers (Oct4, Sox2,
Ssea4) and positive for Pdx1, Nkx6.1, Chromogranin A, PC1/3, insulin, glucagon
and somatostatin. iβ basally secreted C-peptide, glucagon and ghrelin and
released insulin in response either to increasing concentration of glucose or a
depolarizing stimulus. The comparison revealed that iβ are remarkably similar to 
donor derived islets in terms of gene and protein expression profile and similar 
level of heterogeneity. The ability of iβ to respond to glucose instead was more 
related to that of EndoC-βH1.
DISCUSSION: We demonstrated that insulin-producing cells generated from iPSCs
recapitulate fundamental gene expression profiles and secretory function of
native human β cells.
