Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infections cause important respiratory diseases 
in the pig industry and are associated with many bacterial, mycoplasmal, and
viral complications. In this study, a heterologous PCV2 major capsid protein
(MCP) was expressed in the Bordetella bronchiseptica aroA mutant strain (BBS-MCP)
and used as a live vaccine vehicle. Mice and pigs were immunized with live
BBS-MCP via the intranasal route. The antibodies against MCP were induced
successfully in the serum as determined by ELISA. In the PCV2 challenge
experiment, viral DNA was removed successfully from the lymph nodes of pigs
vaccinated with live BBS-MCP. Overall, BBS-MCP is believed to be a good candidate
for the development of a live-attenuated vaccine against PCV2 infections.
