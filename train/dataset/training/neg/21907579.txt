To try and generate broad spectrum human rhinovirus VP1 inhibitors with more
attractive physicochemical, DMPK and safety profiles, we explored the current SAR
of known VP1 compounds. This lead to the identification of specific structural
regions where reduction in polarity can be achieved, so guiding chemistry to
analogues with significantly superior profiles to previously reported inhibitors.
