In a critical situation of world official medicine, we can find different
alternatives therapies: natural therapy traditional and complementary, survival
sometimes, of antique stiles and conditions of life. New sciences presented for
them empiricism to the margin of official science. Doctors and sorcerer do the
best to defeat the horrible virus that contribute to build symbols categories of 
sick. The alternatives put dangerously in game the scientific myth of experiment 
and exhume, if they got lost, antique remedy, almost preserved like cultural
wreck very efficient where the medicine is impotent. Besides alternatives and
complementary therapies, that are remedies not recognized conventional from
official medicine, there are the homeopathic, phytotherapy, pranotherapy,
nutritional therapy, the ayurveda, the yoga, ecc. Italians and internationals
research show a composite picture of persons that apply that therapies. Object of
this work is to understand and know the way that sick lighten their sufferings
and role that have o that can assume the nurses to assist this sick.
