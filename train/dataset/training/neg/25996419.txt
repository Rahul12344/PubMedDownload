OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effectiveness of topical tacrolimus treatment on
herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK) in a rat model.
METHODS: The development of HSK was monitored for 14 days after the inoculation
of rats with herpes simplex type 1 virus. Rats that developed HSK were divided
into four groups as follows: (1) topical antiviral treatment (control), (2)
topical antiviral and 1% prednisolone acetate, (3) topical antiviral and 0.03%
tacrolimus ointment, and (4) topical antiviral plus 0.1% tacrolimus ointment.
After 14 days of treatment, the severity levels of HSK were scored and compared
with the levels before the treatment. The expression of CD3, CD4, and CD8 was
evaluated by flow cytometry. The development of the disease was evaluated
clinically and histologically.
RESULTS: Significant improvement in vascularization was observed in the groups
with the drug treatment in addition to the antiviral agent (P<0.05), but there
was no obvious difference within groups 2, 3, and 4 in the vascularization
severity. The regression of corneal edema was 8.05%±6% in group 1, 25.17%±14.55% 
in group 2 (P=0.01), 36.40%±21.69% in group 3 (P=0.03), and 46.39%±14.96% in
group 4 (P=0.00). A significant decrease in the number of inflammatory cells in
the groups with the drug treatment was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining 
and confirmed by flow cytometry analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Topical tacrolimus treatment caused a significant decrease in
corneal vascularization accompanied by a lower number of inflammatory cells in
the experimental HSK corneal edema model. Therefore, topical tacrolimus has the
potential to be used in the treatment of HSK.
