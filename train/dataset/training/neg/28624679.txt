Avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses represent a growing threat for an influenza
pandemic. The presence of widespread avian influenza virus infections further
emphasizes the need for vaccine strategies for control of pre-pandemic H5N1 and
other avian influenza subtypes. Influenza neuraminidase (NA) vaccines represent a
potential strategy for improving vaccines against avian influenza H5N1 viruses.
To evaluate a strategy for NA vaccination, we generated a recombinant influenza
virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine comprised of the NA protein of
A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5N1) virus. Ferrets vaccinated with influenza N1 NA VLPs
elicited high-titer serum NA-inhibition (NI) antibody titers and were protected
from lethal challenge with A/Indonesia/05/2005 virus. Moreover, N1-immune ferrets
shed less infectious virus than similarly challenged control animals. In
contrast, ferrets administered control N2 NA VLPs were not protected against H5N1
virus challenge. These results provide support for continued development of
NA-based vaccines against influenza H5N1 viruses.
