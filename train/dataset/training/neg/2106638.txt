A basic Public Health approach to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) epidemic
has been considered by many to be the most appropriate initial strategy against
the spread of this infection. Comprehensive Preventive Medicine services were
implemented at Naval Hospital Bethesda, which utilized a sexually transmitted
disease (STD) model and included: counseling and education; sexual contact
interviews and spouse evaluations; Blood Bank Look Back tracking of donated
blood; reporting of notifiable diseases; and screening of transfusion recipients,
STD cases, and other at-risk populations. This coordinated approach is highly
efficient and capable of evaluating the increasing numbers of HIV-positive
individuals.
