With the established benefits of living-donor kidney transplantation, our primary
emphasis at Mayo Clinic, Rochester has been to develop protocols that allow
living donation to occur even in the presence of relatively unusual or generally 
contraindicated situations. This approach has significantly increased the number 
of patients receiving kidney transplants in the past few years. Our protocols for
extended criteria donors and recipients along with the exclusive use of
laparoscopic donor nephrectomy have been major contributors to the increase in
volume. ABO-incompatible and positive-crossmatch living-donor kidney transplant
protocols also have increased the availability of transplants for our patients.
Protocol biopsies have aided in the diagnosis of subclinical rejection, polyoma
virus and chronic allograft nephropathy. Innovative immunosuppressive protocols
such as calcineurin inhibitor-free immunosuppression have decreased rejection and
improved both short and long-term renal allograft survival.
