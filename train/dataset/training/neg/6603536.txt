Titration of antibody to adult T-cell leukemia (ATL)-virus-associated antigen
(ATLA) is of much help for diagnosing ATL, because almost all patients with ATL
are seropositive even in an ATL-nonendemic area such as Kyoto. In T-cell
lymphoma, anti-ATLA antibody was thought to be related to the birthplace of the
patients and the epidermotropism of their skin lesions, but it was not
confirmative because the number of cases was so small. We present here two
curious cases of anti-ATLA-negative T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. A 53-yr-old man,
born in a nonendemic area, had manifestations similar to those of ATL except for 
the lack of skin involvement, but the morphology of his leukemic cells was less
like that of ATL cells than that of prolymphocytic leukemia cells. Therefore, his
leukemia was not diagnosed as ATL. A 52-yr-old woman, whose parents' hometown was
in an endemic area, showed typical manifestations of nonleukemic T-cell lymphoma,
and her biopsied lymph node was compatible with diffuse, pleomorphic lymphoma
histologically. In the latter patient, the negative anti-ATLA finding might be
due to titration sensitivity. Therefore, the clinical and hematologic features
are still informative for distinguishing ATL from other T-cell malignancies.
