OBJECTIVE: To investigate father-to-infant transmission of hepatitis B virus
(HBV) by detecting HBV mRNA in the IVF embryos with paternal HBV infection.
METHODS: We collected 18 discarded IVF embryos (9 cases) with paternal chronic
HBV infection, and detected HBV mRNA in the embryos by single-cell RT-PCR.
RESULTS: HBV mRNA positive signals were found in 1 of the 18 embryos with
paternal serum HBV positive markers (5.6%), but no specific HBV mRNA signals were
observed in the 84 embryos of the negative control group. Follow-up visits
revealed no significant difference between the experimental and negative control 
groups either in the rate of clinical pregnancy (P > 0.05) or in that of early
abortion (P > 0.05). The IVF embryo with paternal HBV mRNA positive signals was
successfully implanted, but early abortion occurred. HBV infection was not
transmitted to progeny in either of the two groups.
CONCLUSION: The positive results of HBV mRNA indicate that HBV can get into
early-cleavage embryos through sperm and replicate there, which may be the main
channel of father-to-infant transmission. HBV may interfere with the development 
of embryos, and even result in abortion and other adverse outcomes.
