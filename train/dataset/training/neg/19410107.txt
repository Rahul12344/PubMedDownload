OBJECTIVE: This study sought to examine the association between intimate partner 
violence (IPV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among a large
representative sample of US women.
METHODS: Data came from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related 
Conditions (age, 20 years and older). The present analysis utilized the subsample
of women who reported being in a relationship in the last year (n=13,928).
Participants were asked whether they had experienced physical or sexual violence 
from their partner in the last year, as well as whether they had been diagnosed
with HIV by a health care professional.
RESULTS: Past year IPV and HIV prevalence estimates among women in romantic
relationships in the United States were 5.5% and 0.17%, respectively. In models
adjusting for sociodemographic factors and risky sexual behaviors (e.g., age of
first intercourse), IPV was significantly associated with HIV infection (adjusted
odds ratios=3.44, 95% confidence interval=1.28-9.22). We also found that 11.8% of
the cases of HIV infection among women were attributable to past year IPV.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates a strong association between IPV and 
HIV in a representative sample of US women. Screening and prevention programs
need to be aware of this important association.
