Suppression of influenza virus replication in infected mice by protease
inhibitors.

Zhirnov OP, Ovcharenko AV, Bukrinskaya AG.

Administration of the protease inhibitors, epsilon-aminocaproic acid or
aprotinins, to mice infected with mouse-adapted influenza virus strain A/PR/8/34 
(HON1) and A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) reduced virus replication in the lungs. Up to
100-fold reduction of virus titre and virus-induced neuraminidase activity were
revealed in mouse lungs under protease inhibitor treatment. As a result,
drug-treated mice rapidly cleared the virus from their lungs. The predominant
synthesis was of non-infectious virions with uncleaved haemagglutinin in the
lungs of drug-treated mice, in contrast to the production of highly infectious
virions with proteolytically cleaved haemagglutinin in untreated mice. These
observations suggest that protease inhibitors suppress influenza virus
replication in mouse lungs due to prevention of haemagglutinin cleavage and virus
proteolytic activation.
