BACKGROUND: Gene therapy, replacing a defective gene by a functional copy, has
been in development for more than 40years. Initial efforts involved engineering
viral vectors to deliver genes to the appropriate cells. Early successes in
severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) were later derailed by safety issues
including host reaction to the vector and gene insertion near promoters that
favored secondary leukemia.
METHODS: Systematic review of the literature using PubMed.gov with key word gene 
therapy from 1972 to March 2013. Google search with key word gene therapy.
RESULTS: Despite early setbacks, progresses for monogenic diseases continued
unabated. Patients with SCIDs have been cured and the first gene therapy has been
approved for lipoprotein lipase deficiency. Many clinical research studies are
ongoing as part of systematic clinical development program with a view to have
more gene therapies approved.
CONCLUSION: Our review highlights progresses and questions that remain to be
answered to make gene therapy an integral part of our therapeutic arsenal.
