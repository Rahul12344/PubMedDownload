AIDS: Dr. Robert C. Gallo, Director of the Institute of Human Virology at the
University of Maryland in Baltimore, is interviewed about the papers presented at
the 1999 International Meeting of the Institute of Human Virology. According to
Dr. Gallo, new biological approaches to the treatment of HIV are needed, and more
drugs need to be developed. He cites targeting chemokine receptors as one
approach to treatment. Another example is Tat toxoid vaccine, which may be used
for both treatment and prevention. Mechanisms of prevention and treatment
vaccines are presented. Other research being done on the treatment of HIV and
AIDS is described briefly. Information on obtaining abstracts from the meeting
and contact information are provided.
