Simultaneous detection and identification of multiple pathogens is required in
many diagnostic fields. In this study a novel method based on a multiplex ligase 
detection (LD)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and microarray (MLPM) is described
to detect simultaneously several swine viruses involved in reproductive and/or
respiratory problems. The multiplex diagnostic system was validated using
standard plasmids, and clinical samples. Using this strategy as few as 10 copies 
of target plasmids were detected successfully. Each probe pair yielded specific
positive signal only in its target site. In addition, when six target plasmids
were present simultaneously sufficient robust signals were generated in their
corresponding sites of six plasmid templates and no obvious signals were detected
in non-target sites. Compared to real-time PCR, the MLPM showed specificities and
sensitivities of 95.7-100% and 100% for 47 clinical samples tested, respectively.
The results demonstrate that this novel assay is a specific, sensitive, and
multiplex diagnostic method for detection of multiple pathogens and can also be
adapted easily for diagnostic purposes.
