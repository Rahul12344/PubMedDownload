In 2015/16, the influenza season in the United Kingdom was dominated by influenza
A(H1N1)pdm09 circulation. Virus characterisation indicated the emergence of
genetic clusters, with the majority antigenically similar to the current
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine strain. Mid-season vaccine effectiveness (VE)
estimates show an adjusted VE of 41.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.0-64.7)
against influenza-confirmed primary care consultations and of 49.1% (95% CI:
9.3-71.5) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. These estimates show levels of
protection similar to the 2010/11 season, when this strain was first used in the 
seasonal vaccine.
