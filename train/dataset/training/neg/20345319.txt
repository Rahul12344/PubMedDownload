Influenza virus-associated encephalopathy (IAE) is a highly mortal neural
complication of influenza A virus (IAV) infection, mostly affecting children
younger than 5 years old, and the brain pathology of IAE is characterized by
peracute brain edema with evidence of an impaired blood-brain barrier. The
pathogenesis of IAE is unknown, but hypercytokinemia of tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6 is suspected of playing a central
role in the development of IAE. Because the brain pathology of IAE is similar to 
that of septic encephalopathy due to endotoxemia, the effect of combined
treatment of IAV and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was tested using suckling mice. The
results show that pulmonary infection with non-neurotropic IAV enhanced the
neuropathogenicity of LPS and induced encephalopathy that was similar to IAE with
respect to the occurrence of central nervous system (CNS) histopathology and the 
absence of direct infection of IAV in the brain. Influenza A virus also increased
blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and induced inflammatory cytokines in the 
blood. These results suggested that the mice treated with IAV+LPS are possible
animal models of IAE, and that hypercytokinemia and/or the involvement of
endotoxemia in IAV infection are possible causes of IAE.
