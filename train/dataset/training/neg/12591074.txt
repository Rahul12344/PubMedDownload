This is the first case report of gastric mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue
lymphoma with adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) cell infiltration. A
43-yr-old Japanese woman who was seropositive for antihuman T cell leukemia
virus-I antibody complained of epigastric pain in April, 1996. Endoscopy showed
gastric ulcers in the antrum. Biopsy specimens showed Helicobacter pylori
infection. Her symptoms were relieved by treatment with ranitidine. In March,
1998, she complained of epigastric pain and abdominal fullness. Smears of
peripheral blood revealed atypical lymphocytes with nuclear irregularity,
consistent with ATLL cells. She was diagnosed to have ATLL. Endoscopy revealed
multiple gastric ulcers in the antrum and the angle. Biopsy specimens
demonstrated small centrocyte-like cells forming lymphoepithelial lesions, with
infiltrations of large atypical lymphoid cells of ATLL. On immunohistochemical
staining, the small centrocyte-like cells were positive for B cell markers (L26, 
CD20), whereas the large atypical lymphoid cells were positive for T cell marker 
(UCHL-1, CD45RO). Her findings were attributed to gastric mucosal-associated
lymphoid tissue lymphoma with gastric involvement with ATLL.
