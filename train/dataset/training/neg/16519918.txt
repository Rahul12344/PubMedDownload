During latency of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), the major viral transcript
that is detected is the latency-associated transcript (LAT) 2-kb intron. This
intron is excised from a larger (approximately 10 kb) primary transcript.
Infection of cells with HSV expressing LATs showed that their presence increased 
accumulation of Hsp70 protein specifically during cold shock. Transfection of
cells with a plasmid, expressing the 2-kb LAT intron, showed increased
translation compared to cells transfected with plasmids deleted in regions of the
intron. Cold shock of cells expressing the intron resulted in an up-regulation of
Hsp70 protein, but not Hsp70 mRNA. Furthermore, these cells showed increased cell
viability. Using plasmid deletion mutants in the LAT gene sequence, we have shown
that the effect requires full-length LAT intron. These findings show that a
function of the stable 2-kb LAT intron is to protect cells from cold-induced
stress and that this may be mediated via Hsp70.
