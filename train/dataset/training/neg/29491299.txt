The patient was a 74-year-old Japanese woman with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who
developed generalized lymphadenopathy with elevated levels of lactase
dehydrogenase (LD), and soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R). She was found to be
positive for anti-human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) antibodies. Her
symptoms and laboratory abnormalities spontaneously regressed after the cessation
of methotrexate (MTX), suggesting that she had an MTX-associated
lymphoproliferative disorder; however, her lymphadenopathy appeared again
approximately 14 months later with LD and sIL-2R elevation. A histopathological
analysis and Southern blotting of a lymph node biopsy specimen for HTLV-1
provirus supported the diagnosis of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL)
(lymphoma type). These data confirmed that an HTLV-1 positive RA patient may
develop ATL.
