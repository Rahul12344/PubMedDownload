The small nonstructural protein NS2 of the minute virus of mice (MVM) is required
for efficient viral replication, although its mode of action is unclear. Here we 
demonstrate that NS2 and survival motor neuron protein (Smn) interact in vitro
and in vivo. NS2 and Smn also colocalize in infected nuclei at late times
following MVM infection.
