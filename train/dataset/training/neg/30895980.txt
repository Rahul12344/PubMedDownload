The proviral integration site of the Moloney leukemia virus (PIM) family includes
three homologous members. PIM-1 kinase is an important target in effective
therapeutic interventions of lymphomas, prostate cancer and leukemia. In the
current work, we performed free energy calculations to calculate the binding
affinities of several inhibitors targeting this protein. The alchemical method
with integration and perturbation-based estimators and the end-point methods were
compared. The computational results indicated that the alchemical method can
accurately predict the binding affinities, while the end-point methods give
relatively unreliable predictions. Decomposing the free energy difference into
enthalpic and entropic components with MBAR reweighting enabled us to investigate
the detailed thermodynamic parameters with which the entropy-enthalpy
compensation in this protein-ligand binding case is identified. We then studied
the conformational ensemble, and the important protein-ligand interactions were
identified. The current work sheds light on the understanding of the
PIM-1-kinase-inhibitor interactions at the atomic level and will be useful in the
further development of potential drugs.
