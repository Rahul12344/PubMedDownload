This paper presents a novel but entirely hypothetical concept on the pathogenesis
of the shock syndrome (DSS) associated with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF).
Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is widely thought to be central to the
development of these clinical entities. Current views on the mechanisms
underlying ADE centre on two major lines of thought: 1) Non-neutralizing
antibodies to dengue virus (DV) can enhance viral uptake and replication in
target cells (monocytes). 2) DHF/DSS are the consequences of enhanced viral
replication, paired with immunopathological processes that are evoked by monocyte
dysfunction and detrimental reactions caused by activated T-lymphocytes. The
present hypothesis proposes, by contrast, a central role for the following
processes: 1) Secondary infection of an individual who has sub or
non-neutralizing antibody titers against DV leads to a booster antibody response 
and a steep rise in antibody levels. 2) Antibodies against DV bind to and direct 
a selective attack of the complement system onto cells expressing viral antigens 
on their surface. DHF/DSS are the direct and indirect consequences of complement 
activation on these cells. The advanced hypothesis, which departs from the
mainstream of "immune enhancement" concepts, can easily be tested by
experimentation.
