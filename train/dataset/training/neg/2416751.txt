Formation of transmembrane channels in liposomes during injection of lambda DNA.

Roessner CA, Ihler GM.

Bacteriophage lambda binds to unilamellar liposomes bearing its receptor protein,
LamB, and the lambda DNA can be injected into the internal aqueous space. During 
this process, transmembrane channels are formed in the liposomes which permit the
entry and escape of small molecules, but not proteins. The channels are stable
and persist after DNA injection.
