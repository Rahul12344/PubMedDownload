Human papillomavirus capsid assembly requires intercapsomeric disulfide bonds
between molecules of the major capsid protein L1. Virions isolated from naturally
occurring lesions have a higher degree of cross-linking than virus-like particles
(VLPs), which have been generated in eukaryotic expression systems. Here we show 
that DNA encapsidation into VLPs leads to increased cross-linking between L1
molecules comparable to that seen in virions. A higher trypsin resistance,
indicating a tighter association of capsomeres through DNA interaction,
accompanies this structural change.
