Spontaneous regression of friend virus induced leukemia: coinfection with
regressing and conventional strains of virus.

Furmanski P, Baldwin J, Clymer R, Rich MA.

Mixtures of friend virus (CFV) and the regressing strain of friend virus (RFV)
induce leukemia which regresses. The dominance of the regressing phenotype is
solely a function of a threshold dose of RFV. The minimum amount of RFV which
induced regression of CFV leukemia is below the titer for induction of friend
disease, but does correlate ith the titer of lymphocytic leukemia (helper)
activity in the these stocks.
