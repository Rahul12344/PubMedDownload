Expression of the human immunodeficiency virus tat-encoded protein (Tat) is
required for virus replication. A genetic approach was used to facilitate the
purification of biologically active Tat. A recombinant Tat protein containing a
stretch of six histidine residues and a protease cleavage site was engineered and
purified to greater than 95% homogeneity in a single step by immobilized
metal-ion chromatography with a special affinity resin that has selectivity for
proteins with neighboring histidine residues. A modified scrape loading method
for introduction of protein into cell monolayers was used to demonstrate that the
purified Tat retained biological activity. Tat function was completely blocked in
the presence of transcription inhibitors, which demonstrates the requirement of
ongoing mRNA synthesis for trans-activation. These studies indicate that the
mechanism of trans-activation is unlikely to involve a direct action of Tat on
mRNA stability, transport, or translation and provides the basis for a rapid
assay that can be used to identify inhibitors of trans-activation. The methods
described herein should be useful for the functional analysis of other proteins
that do not confer activity through a receptor-mediated pathway.
