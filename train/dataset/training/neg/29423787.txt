PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This clinical update is intended to focus in relationship
between HIV infection and use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and statin.
RECENT FINDINGS: Though ART significantly changed the course of HIV infection, it
is related to numerous side effects principally to the lipid profile. In this
way, statins became one of the most used lipid-lowering therapies in this
population. In our clinical update, we evaluated studies that demonstrate the
relationship and molecular mechanisms that HIV infection and ART use trigger
dyslipidemia and also the use of statin to reduce this condition. We have
demonstrated that use of statin can be used in dyslipidemic HIV-infected people
as long as there is no drug interaction with ART. Recently, studies using
rosuvastatin have shown greater effects when compared to the other statins.
