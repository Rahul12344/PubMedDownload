OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the Brazilian Laboratorial Environment Management System
(GAL) as a data source for the Sentinel Surveillance of Influenza-Like Illness
(SSILI).
METHODS: this is an evaluation study of GAL, through the analysis of its
simplicity, flexibility, data quality, acceptability, representativeness,
timeliness, stability and usefulness for SSILI, based on the guide for system
evaluation in public health of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(Atlanta/GA, USA).
RESULTS: in 2011 and 2012, a total of 13,765 exams for respiratory viruses were
registered. GAL presented simple structure, flexibility to changes, good data
quality, acceptability and timeliness in the access to test results, being
representative and stable in 23 Brazilian states.
CONCLUSION: the system is useful in meeting the goals of SSILI; however, there
are some recommendations for adjustments and for encouraging the adherence by the
states that do not use the system yet.
