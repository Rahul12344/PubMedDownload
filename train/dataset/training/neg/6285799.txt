Histological types of nasopharyngeal carcinoma as compared to EBV serology.

One hundred and thirteen cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) were classified 
histologically according to the WHO-, French and Cologne systems. The various
histological tumor types were then correlated with data on Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) serology (EA, VCA, EBNA, CF, IgA-VCA). The results showed non-keratinizing 
carcinomas with lymphoid infiltration, and undifferentiated carcinomas to be
associated with significantly elevated anti-EBV titers. These two tumor types can
be easily grouped together according to the French classification scheme as
"undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasopharyngeal type (UCNT)". Such a procedure,
which may have therapeutic implication, simplifies the rapid diagnostic screening
of NPC patients and also may enhance the reproducibility of histological tumor
typing.
