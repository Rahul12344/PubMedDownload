Genital Chlamydia trachomatis infections in patients with cervical atypia.

Paavonen J, Vesterinen E, Meyer B, Saikku P, Suni J, Purola E, Saksela E.

Of 177 gynecologic outpatients with cervical dysplasia studied, 29 (16%) were
found to excrete Chlamydia trachomatis from their urogenital tract. Sera
collected from 93 of these patients were significantly more often positive for
and showed higher levels of antichlamydial micro-complement fixation (CF) and
immunofluorescence (IF) antibodies than sera obtained from the controls. However,
when the sera were tested for anti-herpesvirus type II (HSV-II) and
cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibodies, no difference between the cases and the
controls were encountered.
