Alterations in glucose metabolism in chick-embryo cells transformed by Rous
sarcoma virus: intracellular levels of glycolytic intermediates.

Singh VN, Singh M, August JT, Horecker BL.

Chick-embryo cells, transformed with Rous sarcoma virus, show enhanced rates of
sugar transport and glycolysis. Determination of intracellular concentrations of 
glycolytic intermediates suggests that the enhanced glycolytic flux is due to
increased activities of hexokinase (ATP:D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase, EC
2.7.1.1), phosphofructokinase, (ATP:D-fructose-1-phosphate 6-phosphotransferase, 
EC 2.7.1.56), and pyruvate kinase (ATP:pyruvate 2-O-phosphotransferase, EC
2.7.1.40), and not directly to the increased glucose transport. This conclusion
is supported by the finding that the intracellular concentration of free glucose 
is decreased, rather than increased, in the transformed cells. The present
observations suggest that the increased glycolytic flux is related to an
increased rate of phosphorylation of glucose, and that hexokinase in the
transformed cells is at least partly released from its normal control mechanism
involving feedback inhibition by glucose-6-P.
