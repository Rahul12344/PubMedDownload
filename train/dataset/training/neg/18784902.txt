BACKGROUND/AIMS: To retrospectively evaluate the clinicopathological features,
treatment modalities and factors affecting prognosis in patients with both
conjunctival intraepithelial and invasive squamous neoplasms.
METHOD: Review and analysis of clinical and pathological records of all cases
histologically diagnosed in the Department of Pathology, University College
Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria between January 1990 and December 2004.
RESULTS: There were a total of 46 cases in 45 patients (eight intraepithelial
carcinomas, 37 invasive squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and a single case of
mucoepidermoid carcinoma in a 71-year-old man). The intraepithelial neoplasms
occurred in patients aged between 20 and 90 years. Seven of these patients had
actinic changes on histology. For invasive SCC, patients' ages ranged from 18 to 
84 years with a mean age of 53 years. Male to female ratio was 1:1. The majority 
presented with an orbital mass and loss of vision. Twenty-two (60%) of the
patients with invasive SCC had enucleation or exenteration as the primary
modality of treatment with or without radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Altogether
for intraepithelial and invasive squamous neoplasms, the duration of presenting
complaints ranged from 1 month to 5 years with an average of 2 years. Human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and smoking were not significantly
associated with these cases but a significant number had outdoor occupation. Low 
socioeconomic status and inability to afford treatment was common among our
patients.
CONCLUSION: Patients with invasive SCC in Nigeria present late and have
significant delay before having any form of treatment. This contributes to the
poor outcome. Human papilloma virus (HPV) and actinic aetiology are possible
strong causative agents in Nigerians.
