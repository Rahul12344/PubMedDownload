Human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid in cervical carcinoma from primary and
metastatic sites.

Lancaster WD, Castellano C, Santos C, Delgado G, Kurman RJ, Jenson AB.

Tissue from 13 cervical cancers and pelvic or para-aortic lymph nodes from the
same patient were evaluated by deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization with a human
papillomavirus type 16 deoxyribonucleic acid probe for the presence of human
papillomavirus-related deoxyribonucleic acid sequences. Twelve of the primary
malignancies were squamous cancers and one was an adenocarcinoma. Eight of the
primary tumors contained human papillomavirus type 16 deoxyribonucleic acid
sequences, and five contained viral sequences closely related to human
papillomavirus type 16. Histopathologic diagnosis confirmed malignant cells in
six of 13 lymph nodes; three of these specimens contained human papillomavirus
type 16 sequences while three had human papillomavirus type 16-related sequences.
One lymph node that failed to show malignant cells also contained human
papillomavirus type 16 deoxyribonucleic acid. The remaining lymph nodes did not
contain malignant cells by either histologic examination or deoxyribonucleic acid
hybridization. The human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid sequences in the
lymph nodes were similar to those in the matched primary cancer in all cases.
These data provide further evidence implicating human papillomavirus in the
etiology of cervical cancer.
