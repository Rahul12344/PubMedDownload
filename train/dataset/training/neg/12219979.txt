The first reported fish kill caused by largemouth bass virus (LMBV) occurred in
1995 in Santee-Cooper Reservoir, South Carolina, USA. Subsequently, this
iridovirus has been implicated in additional fish kills and has also been found
in clinically healthy fish in numerous locations in the southeastern USA. We
compared the virus from Santee-Cooper Reservoir with a virus isolated in 1991
from large-mouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, from Lake Weir, Florida.
Restriction fragment length polymorphisms and the DNA sequence of a portion of
the major capsid protein gene were identical for the South Carolina and Florida
isolates. These results establish that LMBV was first found in Florida, rather
than South Carolina. We propose that the name largemouth bass virus continue to
be used for this virus, rather than alternative names based on geographical
origin.
