Empty capsids of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) type A22 Iraq 24/64, whose
structure has been solved by X-ray crystallography, are unusual for
picornaviruses since they contain VP2 and VP4, the cleavage products of the
protein precursor VP0. Both the N terminus of VP1 and the C terminus of VP4,
which pack together close to the icosahedral threefold symmetry axis where three 
pentamers associate, are more disordered in the empty capsid than they are in the
RNA-containing virus. The ordering of these termini in the presence of RNA
strengthens interactions within a single protomer and between protomers belonging
to different pentamers. The disorder in the FMDV empty capsid forms a subset of
that seen in the poliovirus empty capsid, which has VP0 intact. Thus, VP0
cleavage confers stability on the picornavirus capsid over and above that
attributable to RNA encapsidation. In both FMDV and poliovirus empty capsids, the
internal disordering uncovers a conserved histidine which has been proposed to be
involved in the cleavage of VP0. A comparison of the putative active sites in
FMDV and poliovirus suggests a structural explanation for the sequence
specificity of the cleavage reaction.
