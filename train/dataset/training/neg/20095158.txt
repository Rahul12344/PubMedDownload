Recently a novel avian bornavirus has been described that has been suggested to
be the possible etiological agent for proventricular dilatation disease or macaw 
wasting disease. This article describes two macaws that shed avian bornaviral RNA
sequences and demonstrated anti-avian bornavirus antibodies as revealed by
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Western blot, yet are free of outward clinical
signs of the disease.
