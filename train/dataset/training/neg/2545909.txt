Herpes simplex virus type 1 was purified by density gradient centrifugation, and 
the virion-associated proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. By Western blot (immunoblot) analysis
with an anti-ICP4 monospecific serum, the results indicated that ICP4, one of the
five immediate-early proteins of herpes simplex virus type 1, was associated with
the purified virions. To define the location of ICP4 within the virion, trypsin
digestion experiments were performed. Purified virions were treated with trypsin 
in the presence or absence of detergent. The virus envelope appeared to protect
ICP4 from the trypsin, since virus-associated ICP4 was sensitive to digestion
only after detergent treatment. In addition, ICP4 remained associated with the
virus particle when the virion-specific glycoproteins were removed after
detergent treatment. Finally, ICP4 was not detected in purified preparations of
type A and B capsids isolated from the nuclear fraction of virus-infected cells. 
The above-mentioned data suggest that detectable amounts of ICP4 are present
within the tegument region of the virion.
