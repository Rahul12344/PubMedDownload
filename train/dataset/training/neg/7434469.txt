[Specificity of the chromatin changes in viral infections].

[Article in Russian]

Stefanov SB.

Nine microdensitometric signs (MDMS) of chromatin in cell cultures have been
investigated after injecting with 11 viruses of three taxonomic groups. The
technics of numeric comparison of systems demonstrated a high specificity of
chromatin alterations in relation to the taxonomic position of viruses. The
cultures of different groups differ in their MDMS. The group-to-group relations
in respect to MDMS are expressed by even more numerous differencies. A test value
is suggested to appreciate the specificity in groups of alterations measured upon
the great number of signs.
