OBJECTIVE: HIV-1 and HIV-2 differ notably in their epidemiology, with worldwide
HIV-1 spread and HIV-2 mainly confined to West Africa. Natural killer (NK) cells 
are critical antiviral effectors of the immune system; however, limited
information is available about these innate effector cells during HIV-2
infection.
METHOD: In this study, 24 untreated HIV-2-infected patients were analyzed and
compared with 21 long-term nonprogressor and 10 controller HIV-1 patients, and
healthy donors. Extensive phenotype and functional NK-cell characteristics, as
well as ligands of activating NK receptors involved in NK lysis were determined
by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: We report in HIV-2 patients a very significant reduced expression of the
activating NKp30 receptor (P < 0.0001) on NK cells, much higher than observed in 
HIV-1 patients. The impaired expression of NKp30 is correlated negatively with
HLA-DR (r = -0.5970; P = 0.0002), and positively with both NKG2A (r = 0.5324;
P < 0.0001) and Siglec-7 (r = 0.5621; P = 0.0004). HIV-2 patients with NKp30 NK
cells displayed overproduction of IFN-γ (P < 0.0001) associated with impaired
cytolytic function when tested against target cells expressing surface B7-H6.
This cellular ligand of NKp30 is strongly detectable as a surface molecule on CD4
T cells infected by HIV-2.
CONCLUSION: Altogether, our data suggested that the defective expression of NKp30
may be induced by the chronic engagement of this receptor by B7-H6 expressed on
HIV-2-infected target cells. This represents a novel mechanism by which the
chronic ligand exposure by the viral environment may subvert NK-cell-mediated
function to establish persistent HIV-2 infection.
