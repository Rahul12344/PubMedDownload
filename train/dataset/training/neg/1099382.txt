Effects of bacteriophage M13 infection upon phospholipid and fatty acid
compositions of Escherichia coli.

Chattopadhyay PK, Dutta J.

Escherichia coli K38 were grown and infected with wild type and amber mutants of 
bacteriophage M13 in the early log phase. Lipid compositions of the infected and 
healthy cultures, grown under identical conditions, were determined 2 hr after
infection. From the results, it was observed that total lipid and total
phospholipid content remained nearly constant, suggesting that the cell membrane 
which contained the maximum phospholipids was not damaged by the infection.
Moreover, the percentage of diphosphatidylglycerol and lyso- compounds
corresponding to phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol increased,
while phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol decreased. The increase
in lyso- compounds may be due to the relase of phospholipase A2 (a periplasmic
enzyme) from the cell wall after damage by the infection. Bacteriophage M13
infection had no effect on the fatty acid compostion of the phospholipids.
