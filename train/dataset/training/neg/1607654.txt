To determine whether similar or dissimilar molecular features of class I
molecules are involved in the presentation of structurally distinct peptides, we 
have investigated the influence of different pockets of the HLA-A2.1 molecule on 
the presentation of three different viral peptides. HTLV-I Tax peptide 12-19,
HCMV gB 619-628, and influenza M1 58-66 are minimal peptides that induce
HLA-A2.1-restricted noncross-reactive CTL. A detailed analysis of the structural 
features of HLA-A2.1 that are involved in peptide presentation was undertaken
using a panel of 11 HLA-A2 mutants with single amino acid substitutions within
pockets present in the peptide binding site. Nine of the 11 mutants affected
presentation of each of the three peptides, whereas the other two mutants had
negative effects on presentation of only two of these viral peptides. These
results indicate that common structural features in HLA-A2 determine the binding 
of different peptides, and help to provide a plausible explanation for how
structurally diverse peptides bind to HLA-A2.
