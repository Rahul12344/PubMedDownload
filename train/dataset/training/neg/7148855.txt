Pharmacist-coordinated pneumonia and influenza vaccination program.

Spruill WJ, Cooper JW, Taylor WJ.

High-risk candidates in an ambulatory-care center were identified and immunized
against pneumococcal pneumonia and influenza in a program coordinated by a
pharmacist. Patients determined to be at increased risk for pneumococcal
pneumonia were notified by letter of the vaccination program and encouraged to
participate. Participants were then screened by their health-care providers to
determine whether they were candidates for the vaccination. Those who received
the pneumococcal pneumonia vaccine were later urged to be immunized against
influenza virus. Of 1593 patients selected as possible vaccine candidates, 474
received the pneumococcal vaccine and 397 received the influenza vaccine. No
confirmed cases of pneumococcal pneumonia and only one case of flu-like syndrome 
developed among the immunized patients. Income from the program exceeded its
cost, excluding the salaries of the center's employees. Substantial savings were 
projected from reduced future treatment costs. The pharmacist had initiated and
coordinated a successful effort to increase vaccine use and decrease morbidity.
