Using a DNA probe from an avian transforming virus, NK24, that contains the fos
gene and that was newly isolated and characterized (M. Nishizawa, N. Goto, and S.
Kawai, J. Virol. 61:3733-3740, 1987), we cloned and sequenced the chicken c-fos
gene. Results showed that this gene, like the mouse or human c-fos gene, contains
four exons encoding a predicted gene product of 367 amino acids which is about
79% homologous to p55c-fos (mouse), excluding several small insertions or gaps.
The predicted gene product, however, contains two nonhomologous regions, as
suggested by sequence analysis of the NK24 genome. About half the identical amino
acids of these gene products are encoded by different codons, and the
guanine-plus-cytosine content in the third letter of each codon used in the
entire chicken c-fos coding region is high (93%). The 5'-flanking region of the
TATA box contains a sequence that is homologous to a putative transcriptional
regulatory sequence in the mouse or human c-fos gene. The 3'-noncoding region of 
chicken c-fos is strikingly homologous to that of mouse or human c-fos and covers
a 67-base-pair adenine-plus-thymine-rich stretch which was previously reported to
be essential for an inhibitory effect on the expression of the mouse c-fos gene.
