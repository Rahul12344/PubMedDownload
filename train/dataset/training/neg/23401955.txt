A symposium on the mosquitoes in the Culex pipiens Complex (Pipiens Complex),
including Cx. pipiens, Cx. quinquefasciatus, and Cx. molestus, invited 17 of the 
world's experts on this species Complex to explore the current state of knowledge
on the systematic status, speciation, ecology, biology, vector competence,
population genetics, endosymbionts, and role in disease transmission of these
species in various parts of the world. A Foreword, Introduction, 14 full papers, 
3 abstracts and this Summary are published in this special issue of the Journal
of the American Mosquito Control Association. A summary of findings, overall
conclusions, and research needs will be discussed in relation to mosquito control
and interrupting disease transmission caused by these species.
