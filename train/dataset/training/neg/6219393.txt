Regulation of differentiated cell-specific functions.

Savageau MA.

The demand theory of gene regulation predicts that regulated cell-specific
functions in high demand (i.e., high level of gene expression frequently
required) are under the influence of a positive regulatory element whereas those 
in low demand (i.e., high level of gene expression not frequently required) are
under the influence of a negative regulatory element. Furthermore, during
differentiation, when the demand regimen for cell-specific functions changes, a
switch in the regulatory mechanism itself is predicted. For the case in which a
function is regulated in both demand regimens, the mode of regulation will switch
from positive (high demand) to negative (low demand) or vice versa. These
predictions are compared with published experimental evidence and found to be in 
good agreement.
