Simultaneous initiation of synthesis of bacteriophage T4 DNA and of
deoxyribonucleotides.

Chiu CS, Tomich PK, Greenberg GR.

In earlier reports we have suggested that bacteriophate T4 DNA replication occurs
in a complex composed of the proteins required for polymerization and the system 
of enzymes synthesizing the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate precursors of DNA.
T4-induced dCMP hydroxymethylase and dTMP synthetase, though demonstrable in
extracts soon after infection, are not active in vivo until about 5 min. The in
vivo activities increase exponentially for approximately 15 min and then become
constant. We have suggested that the exponential period represents the formation 
of the complexes. This paper shows that the initiation of DNA synthesis and of
the two deoxyribonucleotide-synthesizing activities occurs simultaneously and
with coinciding exponential kinetics. The in vivo activities of the two enzymes
were tested after infection by a number of T4 amber Dna- mutants. Their
activities were essentially unchanged compared to the wild-type phage, except on 
infection by mutants of gene 43 (T4 DNA nucleotidyltransferase or DNA
polymerase). With these mutants the rate of increase of dTMP synthetase and dCMP 
hydroxymethylase activities was always substantially lower than after infection
by wild-type phage. It is proposed that an intimate interaction occurs between
T4-induced DNA polymerase and the complex of enzymes forming 5-hydroxymethyl-dCMP
and dTMP.
