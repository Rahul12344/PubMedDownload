The baculovirus is a classic example of a parasite that alters the behavior or
physiology of its host so that progeny transmission is maximized. Baculoviruses
do this by inducing enhanced locomotory activity (ELA) that causes the host
caterpillars to climb to the upper foliage of plants. We previously reported that
this behavior is not induced in silkworms that are infected with a mutant
baculovirus lacking its protein tyrosine phosphatase (ptp) gene, a gene likely
captured from an ancestral host. Here we show that the product of the ptp gene,
PTP, associates with baculovirus ORF1629 as a virion structural protein, but
surprisingly phosphatase activity associated with PTP was not required for the
induction of ELA. Interestingly, the ptp knockout baculovirus showed
significantly reduced infectivity of larval brain tissues. Collectively, we show 
that the modern baculovirus uses the host-derived phosphatase to establish
adequate infection for ELA as a virion-associated structural protein rather than 
as an enzyme.
