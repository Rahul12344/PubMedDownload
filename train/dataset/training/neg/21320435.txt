A theory for calculating the proton flux through the influenza virus M2 channel
is tested here against an extensive set of conductance data. The flux is
determined by the rate constants for binding to the His(37) tetrad from the two
sides of the membrane and the corresponding unbinding rate constants. The rate
constants are calculated by explicitly treating the structure and dynamics of the
protein. Important features revealed by previous studies, such as a gating role
for Val(27) at the entrance to the channel pore, and channel activation by viral 
exterior pH, are incorporated in this theory. This study demonstrates that the
conductance function of the M2 proton channel can now be quantitatively
rationalized by the structure and dynamics of the protein.
