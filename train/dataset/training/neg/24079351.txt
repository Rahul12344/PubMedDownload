BACKGROUND: HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) co-infection is highly common among Chinese
injection drug users but it is difficult to reach IDUs at traditional VCT
(Voluntary HIV counseling treatment) clinics. A new national model integrating
HIV/HCV testing with methadone maintenance treatment was started in 2006. The
purpose of this study was to investigate HIV and HCV test uptake and associated
factors at methadone clinics in Guangdong Province, China.
METHODS: A cross-sectional design using routine surveillance data and laboratory 
testing confirmation was applied to determine rates of HIV and HCV test uptake.
Multi-level modeling was used to examine individual-level and clinic-level
correlates of increased test uptake.
RESULTS: 45 out of 49 methadone clinics in Guangdong Province agreed to
participate in the study. Among all 13,270 individuals, 10,046 (75.7%) had HIV
test uptake and 10,404 (78.4%) had HCV uptake. At the individual level, methadone
clients 30 years or older were more likely to have HIV and HCV test uptake (p
<0.001 for both). At the clinic level, methadone clinics with greater health care
personnel were more likely to have HIV (p = 0.01) and HCV (p = 0.044) test
uptake. HIV test uptake significantly correlated with HCV test uptake
(correlation coefficient = 0.64).
CONCLUSION: Methadone clinics provide an opportunity for routine integrated HIV
and HCV screening among drug users in China. Increased test uptake in young drug 
users and increased health care personnel at clinics may further improve
screening.
