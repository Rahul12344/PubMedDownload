Stem cell and gene therapy approaches have held out much hope for the development
of new tools to treat disease. Therapeutic approaches based on these methods have
only rarely found their way into the clinic. The linking of stem cell therapy
with selective gene therapy enhances therapeutic options for the regeneration or 
replacement of diseased or missing cells. This review focuses on the rationale
and preliminary results of combining stem cell and gene therapy. Special emphasis
is placed on various molecular techniques currently used to genetically engineer 
stem cells. Viral and nonviral genes delivering technologies are detailed as are 
techniques for the modulation of gene expression in the context of stem cell
recruitment and differentiation. Finally potential clinical applications for this
new therapeutic strategy are discussed.
