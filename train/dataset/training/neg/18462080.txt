We performed an HTLV epidemiological study of 986 individuals from 17 villages
from the same state of Salvador, the city with the highest HTLV-1 prevalence in
Brazil. The HTLV-1 prevalence was 3.85%, 1.56%, and 1.23% in three villages.
Phylogenetic analysis of the LTR region demonstrated that all positive samples
analyzed belonged to the Transcontinental subgroup of the HTLV-1 Cosmopolitan
subtype. Three of the new HTLV-1 sequences formed a well-supported clade within
one of the Latin American clusters that contain a South African sequence. This
Latin American cluster that segregated from the same ancestor as the other clade 
contained a Central African sequence. This ancestral relationship could support
our previous report that suggests that this subgroup was first introduced into
South Africa as a result of the migration of the Bantu population from Central
Africa to Southern Africa over the past 3000 years, and afterward to Brazil
during the slave trade between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries.
