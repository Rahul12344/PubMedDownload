Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a multisystem connective tissue disease affecting
skin and internal organs. Certain drugs, environmental toxins and some viruses
have been implicated in SSc-like illnesses. Scleroderma may be associated with
some connective tissue disorders or autoimmune diseases but coexistence of
scleroderma with multiple myeloma (MM) is an unusual finding. We here report a
case of a 59 years old female patient with 5 months history of progressive
thickening of skin all over the body. Multiple myeloma was diagnosed by
osteolytic lesion in skull X-ray, increase in clonal plasma cells by bone marrow 
biopsy, very high Kappa light chain in serum light chain assay and detection of M
band by serum protein electrophoresis.
