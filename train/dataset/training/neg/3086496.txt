Resistance of a Bacillus subtilis mutant to a group of temperate bacteriophages.

Estrela AI, De Lencastre H, Archer LJ.

A mutant of Bacillus subtilis 168 was isolated which resists infection by all the
group III temperate bacteriophages except SPR, while allowing full infection by
phages of the other groups (I, II and IV). The mutation conferring this
phenotype, pha-3, shows 52-54% PBS1-mediated cotransduction with the hisAl
marker, mapping therefore in the gtaA and gtaB region of the B. subtilis
chromosome. Nevertheless, it does not affect the infection by phages sensitive to
gta mutations.
