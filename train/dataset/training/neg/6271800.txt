Growth and purification of SV40 virus for biochemical studies.

Rosenberg BH, Deutsch JF, Ungers GE.

A detailed growth and purification scheme suitable for producing relatively large
quantities of fully active, pure SV40 is presented together with data on recovery
and purity at each step of the procedure. The scheme was designed to prevent the 
initial binding of virus to cell components as well as contamination of the
extracted virus by cellular DNA.
