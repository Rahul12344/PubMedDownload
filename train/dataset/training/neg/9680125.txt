The recent discovery of a novel poxvirus [penguin-pox virus (PPV)] from Jackass
penguins offers the potential of a unique candidate vaccine vector for use in
mammals. Infectivity studies were therefore undertaken using a number of
mammalian cell lines and chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF). It was shown that the
simian CV-1 cell line was able to support replication of the PPV DNA, but no
infectious progeny virus could be recovered from the infected cells. Electron
microscopy was used to establish the extent of virus morphogenesis in CV-1 cells 
as compared to that in both chorio-allantoic membranes (CAMs) of hens' eggs and
CEF cells. It appears that CV-1 cells are able to support partial maturation of
PPV, but that morphogenesis does not proceed to the stage of mature infectious
particles. Vaccinia virus promoters were successful in achieving transient gene
expression in PPV-infected cells.
