Antiproteases play diverse roles in nature, from regulating protease activity to 
innate defense against microorganisms. Recently, antiproteases have been shown to
play important roles in HIV pathogenesis including, inhibiting HIV binding and
replication and reducing activation and inflammation of susceptible cells. They
have also been implicated as one of the initial host responders, in plasma, to
control replication of HIV. More recently, antiproteases expressed at the mucosal
surface have been linked to reduced susceptibility to HIV infection in
HIV-exposed sero-negative individuals. These factors are expressed in the
epithelial layer of the female genital tract, thus at the frontline of defense
against mucosal infection. This review focuses on the specific antimicrobial
roles of antiproteases, focusing on serpins and cystatins, with an emphasis on
their known and potential roles in HIV infection. Their potential as therapeutic 
interventions to combat HIV is also discussed.
