Virulence and pathogenesis of yellow fever virus serially passaged in cell
culture.

Viscerotropic virulence of the Asibi strain of yellow fever virus (YFV) for
monkeys has been known to be lost after serial passage in HeLa cell monolayers.
This phenomenon was investigated in several other mammalian and insect tissue
cell lines. Assay in monkeys of original seed virus and of virus after 7 and 11
passages in a porcine kidney cell line (PK) indicated essentially equal
infectivity and mortality. Moreover, monkeys receiving the passaged virus
exhibited more rapid onset of disease and death than animals infected with
original seed virus. Histological changes in animals inoculated with passaged
virus were identical to those in animals receiving the seed virus. Virus from
later passages in PK cells was also lethal for approximately 50% of the monkeys; 
however, evidence for progressive attenuation was seen in these preparations.
Similar results were obtained with a mosquito (Aedes aegypti) cell line. In
contrast to results obtained in PK and mosquito cells, YFV became essentially
avirulent (nonlethal and less infective) for monkeys after only seven passages in
HeLa cell cultures.
