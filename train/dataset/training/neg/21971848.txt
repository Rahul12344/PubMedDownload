Adeno-associated virus is a nonpathogenic human virus that has been developed
into a gene-delivery vector due to its high efficiency of infection for many
different cell types and its ability to persist and lead to long-term gene
expression. This unit describes efficient methods to generate high-titer,
research-grade, adenovirus-free recombinant single-stranded and
self-complementary adeno-associated virus in various serotypes, along with
methods to quantify the viral vectors. Two detailed methods are provided for
viral vector delivery into the rodent brain and spinal cord, and for histological
detection of transgene expression of GFP.
