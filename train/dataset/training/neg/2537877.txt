Cytolytic recognition of CMV-infected syngeneic fetal guinea pig cells by
maternal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was suppressed late in
pregnancies of uninfected guinea pig breeders with less than 25% conceptus loss. 
A small subset of less successful uninfected pregnancies with greater than or
equal to 50% fetal wastage exhibited only partial suppression of cytolytic
activity against CMV-infected fetal cells. Primary CMV infection of dams
extending into early pregnancy induced augmented cytolysis of CMV-infected fetal 
cells, but not MA104 NK cell targets, throughout gestation and resulted in 70%
loss of conceptus. Decreased suppression of cytolytic activity against
CMV-infected fetal cells in uninfected pregnancy was also associated with runting
of newborn pups, which was not as severe as that observed in congenitally
CMV-exposed or CMV-infected pups. Congenitally infected pups were affected more
than their exposed but uninfected litter mates. Lack of suppression of cytolysis 
of CMV-infected syngeneic fetal cells, whether spontaneous or
CMV-infection-induced, appears to be associated with poor pregnancy outcome.
