The reliability of the Hybrid Capture II (HC-II; Digene, Silver Spring, MD,
U.S.A.) assay was tested in detecting 18 human Papillomavirus (HPV) types for the
screening of cervical lesions. Cytology, HPV testing, colposcopy, and biopsy were
used to monitor 204 women with normal smears at the first entry. The median
follow-up was 15 months (range, 4-27 months). The primary endpoint was clinical
progression defined as the presence of a cervical intraepithelial lesion at the
biopsy. In the patient population of 204 HPV-infected women, 81 (39.7%) had a
persistent HPV infection at two or three examinations with a final histologic
diagnosis of 14 high-grade and 13 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions
(SIL) within 4 to 22 months. Women with regressive HPV infection did not develop 
any lesion during the same period. The evaluation of the viral load of high-risk 
HPV by the HC-II did not represent a sensitive approach to predict the
persistence or the apparition of high-grade lesions. Thus, persistent high-risk
HPV infection detected with HC-II represents a reliable tool to select
populations at risk for the development of high-grade cervical lesions.
