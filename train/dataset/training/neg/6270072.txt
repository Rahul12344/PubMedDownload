RNA polymerase of influenza virus. I. Comparison of the virion-associated RNA
polymerase activity of various strains of influenza virus.

Kawakami K, Ishihama A, Hamaguchi M.

A systematic and comparative study was performed on the polypeptide composition
and the RNA polymerase activity associated with virions of various strains of
influenza A virus, including four human and two avian viruses. Significant
differences were found in the molecular weights of not only hemagglutinin (HA)
but also both nucleoprotein (NP) and membrane protein (M), as determined by
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. The results
indicate that, among viruses sharing the same serotype determined by the surface 
proteins HA and NA (neuraminidase), considerable variations exist in the
structure of viral proteins, including inner proteins. The relative contents of
viral proteins also varied among these strains grown under similar conditions.
The total content of three P proteins, the putative RNA polymerase subunits, was 
within the range between 1.1 and 2.2% of total viral proteins and roughly
paralleled the virion-associated RNA polymerase activity. The virion-associated
RNA polymerase of all the strains tested were stimulated by the same dinucleotide
primers, ApG or GpG, indicating that the specificity of transcription initiation 
is conserved among wide varieties of influenza virus.
