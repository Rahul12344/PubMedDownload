Induced expression of the Flock House virus in the soma of C. elegans results in 
the RNAi-dependent production of virus-derived, small-interfering RNAs (viRNAs), 
which in turn silence the viral genome. We show here that the viRNA-mediated
viral silencing effect is transmitted in a non-Mendelian manner to many ensuing
generations. We show that the viral silencing agents, viRNAs, are
transgenerationally transmitted in a template-independent manner and work in
trans to silence viral genomes present in animals that are deficient in producing
their own viRNAs. These results provide evidence for the transgenerational
inheritance of an acquired trait, induced by the exposure of animals to a
specific, biologically relevant physiological challenge. The ability to inherit
such extragenic information may provide adaptive benefits to an animal.
