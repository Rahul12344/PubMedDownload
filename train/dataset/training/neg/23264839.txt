Since the first tests for identifying individuals with suspected human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were introduced in the mid-1980s,
diagnostic virology testing has greatly evolved. The technological advances,
automating in the laboratories and the advances in molecular biology techniques
have helped introduce invaluable laboratory methods for managing HIV patients.
Tests for diagnosis, specially for screening HIV antibodies, are now fully
automated; in the same way, tests for monitoring HIV viral load (HIV RNA
copies/ml of plasma), which is used for monitoring infection and response to
antiretroviral treatment, are also fully automated; however, resistance testing, 
tropism determination and minor variant detection, which are used to make
decisions for changing antiretroviral treatment regimens in patients failing
therapy, still remain highly laborious and time consuming. This chapter will
review the main aspects relating to the automating of the methods available for
laboratory diagnosis as well as for monitoring of the HIV infection and
determination of resistance to antiretrovirals and viral tropism.
