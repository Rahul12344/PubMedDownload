We evaluated 76 adenovirus type 7 (Ad7) isolates collected in Iowa from 1992 to
2002 and found that genome type Ad7d2 became increasingly prevalent. By 2002, it 
had supplanted all other Ad7 genome types. The association of Ad7d2 with severe
illness and death calls for heightened public health concern.
