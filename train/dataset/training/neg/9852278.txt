JC virus, a human neurotropic polyomavirus, is the established etiologic agent of
the fatal demyelinating disease, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy,
which usually affects individuals with defects in cell-mediated immunity.
Cytolytic destruction of oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing cells of the
central nervous system is attributed as the mechanism by which JCV induces
demyelination. PML was at one time a rare complication however it is now a much
more common disease affecting patients of all ages due to the prevalence of AIDS.
Of interest, in vitro evidence points to a cooperative interaction between JCV
and HIV-1, via the HIV-1 regulatory protein, Tat. In addition, JCV has been
demonstrated to induce tumors of neural origin in several animal models,
including rodents and non-human primates, and several clinical reports have
suggested a possible association between JCV and glial-origin tumors in humans.
The viral regulatory protein, T-antigen, which has been shown to play a key role 
in orchestrating the events of the viral lytic cycle, is also capable of altering
cellular functions, by nature of its direct interaction with cellular regulatory 
proteins and by its effect on cellular transcription. In this review, we discuss 
clinical aspects of PML, the ability of JCV to induce tumors in animal models,
and the ability of JCV T-antigen to alter cellular function in vitro.
