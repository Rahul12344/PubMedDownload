OBJECTIVE: To understand the status of coxsackievirus B (CVB) infection in senior
subjects and explore the association of the infection with cardiovascular
diseases.
METHOD: By means of ELISA and RT-PCR, CVB IgG antibody and nucleic acid were
detected in 172 patients with cardiopathy and 58 control subjects.
RESULTS: The positivity rate of CVB IgG antibody was 43.61% (75/172) in the
patient group and 15.52% (9/58) in the control group, showing obvious difference 
between the two groups. CVB RNA tests revealed a CVB RNA-positivity rate of
20.93% (36/172) in the former group and 3.45% (2/58) in the latter, with also a
significant difference (P<0.01).
CONCLUSION: CVB infection is prevalent in aged patients with heart disease, which
should be given due attention to.
