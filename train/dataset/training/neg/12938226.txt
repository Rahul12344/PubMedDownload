Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) induces a chronic demyelinating
disease in the central nervous system of susceptible mice. Resistance to
persistent TMEV infection maps to he D locus of the major histocompatibility
complex suggesting a prominent role of antiviral CTL in the protective immune
response. Introduction of the D(b) gene into the FVB strain confers resistance to
this otherwise susceptible mouse line. Infection of the FVB/D(b) mouse with TMEV 
provides a model where antiviral resistance is determined by a response elicited 
by a single class I molecule. Resistant mice of the H-2(b) haplotype mount a
vigorous H-2D(b)-restricted immunodominant response to the VP2 capsid protein. To
investigate the extent of the contribution of the immunodominant T cell
population in resistance to TMEV, FVB/D(b) mice were depleted of VP2-specific
CD8(+) T cells by peptide treatment prior to virus infection. Peptide-treated
mice were not able to clear the virus and developed extensive demyelination.
These findings demonstrate that the D(b)-restricted CD8(+) T cells specific for a
single viral peptide can confer resistance to TMEV infection. Our ability to
manipulate this cellular response provides a model for investigating the
mechanisms mediating protection against virus infection by CD8(+) T cells.
