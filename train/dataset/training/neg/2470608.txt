We have developed immortalized epithelial cystic fibrosis (CF) cell lines by
infecting cultured nasal polyp cells with a SV40/Adenol2 hybrid virus. The cell
lines obtained are epithelial in nature as shown by cytokeratin production and
morphology, although cytokeratins 4 and 13 typical of primary nasal polyp cells
are produced at a much reduced rate. Ussing chamber experiments showed that the
precrisis CF cell line NCF3 was able to perform trans-cellular chloride transport
when activated by agents which elevate intracellular calcium. cAMP agonists had
no effect on chloride flux in NCF3 as expected for CF cells. The apical chloride 
channels found with the patch clamp technique in NCF3 and in the postcrisis cell 
line NCF3A have a conductance similar to that of chloride channels found earlier 
in normal and CF epithelial cells. The channels show a delay in the onset of
activity in off-cell patches and are not activated by increased cAMP levels in
the cell. This indicates that immortalized CF epithelial cells will provide a
useful model for the study of cystic fibrosis.
