Blood samples were collected from 1328 dairy cows of different parities in 46
herds in two regions of South Korea and tested for bovine viral diarrhoea virus
(BVDV) by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) for the detection of viral sequences
in whole blood and by a commercial elisa for the detection of bvdv-specific
antibodies. None of the animals was positive by RT-PCR but 770 (58 per cent) were
seropositive. The proportion of seropositive cows increased with their parity,
but there was no difference between the seroprevalence of BVDV among the cows in 
the two regions.
