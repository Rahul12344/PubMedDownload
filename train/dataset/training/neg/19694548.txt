Recent discoveries have revealed previously unappreciated complexity with which
retroviruses interact with their hosts. In particular, we have become aware that 
many mammals, including humans, are equipped with genes encoding so-called
"restriction factors," that provide considerable resistance to retroviral
infection. Such antiretroviral genes are sometimes constitutively expressed, and 
sometimes interferon-induced. Thus they can be viewed as comprising an intrinsic 
immune system that provides a pre-mobilized defense against retroviral infection 
or, alternatively, as a specialized extension of conventional innate immunity.
Antiretroviral restriction factors have evolved at an unusually rapid pace,
particularly in primates, and some startling examples of evolutionary change are 
present in genes encoding restriction factors. Our understanding of the
mechanisms by which restriction factors interfere with retroviral replication,
and how their effects are avoided by certain retroviruses, is accruing, but far
from complete. Such knowledge could allow for novel forms of therapeutic
intervention in pathogenic retroviral infections, as well as the development of
animal models of human disease.
