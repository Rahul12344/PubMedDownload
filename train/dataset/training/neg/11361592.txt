Chancroid is a major cause of genital ulcer disease worldwide, and occurred at
epidemic rates in the United States in the late 1980s. Though the recent epidemic
in the U.S. appears to be waning, a number of areas continue to report
significant numbers of cases. Chancroid is a particular concern, because, like
other diseases that cause genital ulceration, it is associated with an increased 
risk for transmission or acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Recent studies have advanced the understanding of chancroid epidemiology, and new
diagnostic tests may improve the ability to recognize and appropriately treat
chancroid. Increased awareness of chancroid, with appropriate treatment for
suspected lesions, along with public health efforts to implement prevention in
high-risk populations, will be critical to prevent ongoing transmission of
chancroid, and potentially ongoing transmission of HIV.
