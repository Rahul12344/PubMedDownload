Some aminopyridine complexes of palladium and PdCl2 showed an antiviral in vitro 
activity against enveloped DNA and RNA viruses such as vaccinia virus,
pseudorabies virus, NDV and FPV. In contrast, naked RNA virus as mengovirus was
not affected. The compounds were compatible for chicken embryo as well as FL
cells in concentrations of 100-250 microM. The therapeutical index calculated
from the maximally tolerated dose and the concentration causing a 50 per cent
plaque reduction was determined with more than 45 for vaccinia virus, for
example.
