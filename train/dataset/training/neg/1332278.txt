Hantavirus, a genus in the family Bunyaviridae, is comprised of at least four
serologically distinct types: Hantaan, Seoul, Puumala and Prospect Hill. The
present communication reports the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for
typing 27 independently isolated Hantaviruses from 5 different continents. Total 
cellular RNA was extracted from virus-infected Vero E6 cell monolayers by the
acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method. We have utilized 5 different
sets of oligonucleotide primers ranging from 18 to 22 nucleotides in length; one 
set was specific for a conserved region of the S genomic segment and used as
genus-specific primers, the other 4 sets of primers were designed from unique
sequences of the M genomic segment such that each primer set was specific to only
one serological type of Hantavirus. The PCR products were analyzed by restriction
endonuclease digestion for further confirmation. We typed 10, 12, 3 and 1
isolates into Hantaan, Seoul, Puumala and Prospect Hill respectively. The results
of PCR were 100% agreeable with that of serological typing, and thus, PCR can be 
used as an adjunct test with serological method(s) or an independent test for
diagnosis and for typing of new isolates of Hantaviruses.
