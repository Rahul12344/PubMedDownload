The acoustic biological sensor for the analysis of the bacterial cells in
conducting suspension was developed. The sensor represented the two channel delay
line based on the piezoelectric plate of Y-X lithium niobate thick of 0.2mm. Two 
pairs of the interdigital transducers (IDT) for the excitation and reception of
shear horizontal acoustic wave of zero order (SH0) in each channel were deposited
by the method of photolithography. One channel of the delay line was electrically
shorted by the deposition of thin aluminum film between IDTs. The second channel 
remained as electrically open. The liquid container with the volume of 5ml was
fixed on the plate surface between IDTs by the glue, which did not cause the
additional insertion loss. For the first time the influence of the conductivity
of the cell suspension on the registration of the specific and nonspecific
interactions of the bacterial cells with phage-antibodies (phage-Abs) was studied
by means of the developed sensor. The dependencies of the change in insertion
loss and phase of the output signal on the conductivity of the buffer solution at
specific/nonspecific interactions for the electrically open and shorted channels 
of the delay line were obtained. It was shown that the sensor successfully
registered the interactions of microbial cells with phage-Abs in the range of the
conductivity of 2-20 μS/cm on the model samples A. brasilense Sp245 - specific
phage-Abs. The sensor in the time regime of the operation fast reacted on the
specific/nonspecific interaction and the time of the stabilization of the output 
parameters did not exceed 10min.
