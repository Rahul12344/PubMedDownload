Viral promoters can yield high gene expression levels yet tend to be attenuated
in vivo by host proinflammatory cytokines. Prolonged transgene expression can be 
obtained using constitutive cellular promoters. However, levels of transgene
expression driven by cellular promoters are insufficient for effective therapy.
We designed a novel self-augmenting gene expression cassette in which the
transgene product can induce an endogenous transcription factor to enhance the
activity of a weak cellular promoter driving its expression. Using the cellular
major histocompatibility complex class I (H-2K(b)) promoter to drive the
interferon (IFN-gamma) cytokine gene, we show that the H-2K(b) promoter, although
exhibiting much lower basal activity, yields higher IFN-gamma production than the
CMV promoter 2 days after transfection. IFN-gamma expression driven by the
H-2K(b) promoter also lasts longer than that driven by the cytomegalovirus
promoter. Our data demonstrate that the self-augmenting strategy provides a
promising approach to achieve high and sustained transgene expression in vivo.
