Towards the development of chemotherapy for the infection by human T-cell
leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), we have established evaluation systems for HTLV-I
protease (PR) inhibitors using both recombinant and chemically synthesized HTLV-I
PRs. Newly synthesized substrate-based inhibitors containing
hydroxymethylcarbonyl (HMC) isostere showed potent anti-HTLV-I PR activity.
