Variations in the major surface proteins (HBsAg) of hepatitis B virus (HBV) have 
been implicated in the high rate of reinfection in HBV-infected recipients of
orthotopic liver transplantations (OLT). Sera from 6 OLT patients positive for
HBsAg and from 3 recipients negative for it prior to transplantation were
analyzed over several years, and 39 HBsAg sequences were compared. Despite
anti-HBs immunoprophylaxis resulting in the disappearance of HBsAg, HBV DNA was
detectable by a sensitive nested PCR in almost all sera. In 1 patient, a
significant temporary shift in HBV subtypes was observed, indicating a mixed
infection or the presence of multiple HBV populations in this patient; this was
also true for other patients. Amino acid substitutions compared to wild-type HBV 
subtypes in 7 patients and variations within patients in 5 patients were
detectable over time; the 'escape mutation' at amino acid position 145 was
detected in 2 patients. Our data suggest that the high rate of reinfection in OLT
recipients seems not to be associated with specific sequence variations in the
major HBs gene, but shows a remarkable inter- and intraindividual variability.
Obviously, no correlation between heterogeneity in this gene and clinical outcome
was present. Copyright 1997 S. Karger AG, Basel
