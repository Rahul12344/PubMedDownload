Since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy, cancer incidence is
still 2 to 3-fold higher in patients infected by human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) than in the general population, with an increased incidence of malignancies
not associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV-infected
patients cancer treatment does not differ from that in the general population.
However, the management of those patients have some particularities due to
preexisting comorbid conditions, including metabolic, cardiovascular, renal or
hepatic complications and the risk for potential drug - drug interactions in
HIV-infected patients. In this review, we described efficacy and tolerance of
radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy in this frail population treated for
cancer. Utilization of modern radiotherapy techniques such as intensity-modulated
radiotherapy may improve the treatment tolerance.
