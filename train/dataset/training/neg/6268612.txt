Escherichia coli gal operon proteins made after prophage lambda induction.

Merril CR, Gottesman ME, Adhya SL.

Expression of the EScherichia coli gal operon under the control of the prophage
lambda promoter pL leads to gross discoordinacy of gal expression. Expression of 
the most promoter-distal cistron galK is much greater than expression of the
promoter-proximal cistron galE. We had previously shown that transcription of the
gal operon is coordinate after prophage induction. A survey of protein
synthesized after prophage induction indicated that lack of expression of galE is
due to a failure of translation of the galE sequence in the pL-gal transcript.
This failure of translation of the galE sequence may be due to extensive dyad
symmetry present in the vicinity of the gal promoter region of the pL-gal
transcript. This symmetry could result in a ribonucleic acid stem-loop structure,
blocking the attachment of ribosomes at the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of galE. To
test this model, strains bearing the IS1 or IS2 insertion, deletion, or new
promoter mutation within the symmetrical region were constructed. The restoration
of some galE expression after such disruptions of the symmetrical region
indicated that the ribonucleic acid stem-loop structure did play a role in the
discoordinate expression of gal from pL. However, failure to obtain galE
expression coordinated with high levels of galK expression suggested that other
components were involved, perhaps other symmetries between galE and the pL
transcript.
