This is the case of a 79-year-old man with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who
presented with Guillain-Barré syndrome with features overlapping with the Miller 
Fisher syndrome and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis and positive
antiganglioside GQ1b antibody about 6 months after treatment with bendamustine
and rituximab. His clinical and neurologic condition continued to deteriorate
despite sequential treatment with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin and
plasmapheresis, but in the end, he had a complete and durable response to
treatment with alemtuzumab.
