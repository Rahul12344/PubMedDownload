We investigated the presence of stop codons (SC) and/or hypermutation (HM) in
HIV-1 DNA sequences generated for routine drug resistance testing in proviral
HIV-1 DNA, and sought for associated factors. At least one SC was identified in
6.2% of HIV-1 DNA sequences, among which 54.8% were hypermutated. The defective
virus group (SC w/o HM) was similar to the non-SC group regarding the
characteristics of HIV-1 infection, and before drug exposure. In addition, the
HIV-1 DNA levels were not different between both groups. Sequences with SC/HM
displayed a higher proportion of RAMs. The impact of the SC/HM associated RAMs on
clinical responses requires further investigation.
