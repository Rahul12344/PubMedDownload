OBJECTIVES: We compared a 3rd generation (gen) and two 4th gen HIV enzyme
immunoassays (EIA) to pooled nucleic acid testing (PNAT) for the identification
of pre- and early seroconversion acute HIV infection (AHI).
STUDY DESIGN: 9550 specimens from males >18 year from clinics attended by men who
have sex with men were tested by Siemens ADVIA Centaur(®) HIV 1/O/2 (3rd gen) and
HIV Combo (4th gen), as well as by Abbott ARCHITECT(®) HIV Ag/Ab Combo (4th gen).
Third gen non-reactive specimens were also tested by Roche COBAS(®)
Ampliprep/COBAS® TaqMan HIV-1 Test v.2 in pools of 24 samples. Sensitivity and
specificity of the three EIAs for AHI detection were compared.
RESULTS: 7348 persons contributed 9435 specimens and had no evidence of HIV
infection, 79 (94 specimens) had established HIV infection, 6 (9 specimens) had
pre-seroconversion AHI and 9 (12 specimens) had early seroconversion AHI.
Pre-seroconversion AHI cases were not detected by 3rd gen EIA, whereas 2/6
(33.3%) were detected by Siemens 4th gen, 4/6 (66.7%) by Abbott 4th gen and 6/6
(100%) by PNAT. All three EIAs and PNAT detected all individuals with early
seroconversion AHI. Overall sensitivity/specificity for the EIAs relative to WB
or NAT resolved infection status was 93.6%/99.9% for Siemens 3rd gen, 95.7%/99.7%
for Siemens 4th gen and 97.9%/99.2% for Abbott 4th gen.
CONCLUSIONS: While both 4th gen EIAs demonstrated improved sensitivity for AHI
compared to 3rd gen EIA, PNAT identified more AHI cases than either 4th gen
assay. PNAT is likely to remain a useful strategy to identify AHI in high-risk
populations.
