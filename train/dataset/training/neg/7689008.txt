We have analyzed the CFTR mRNA populations in a cystic fibrosis patient
heterozygous for the 621 + 1G-->T and 711 + 1G-->T mutations. Total RNA isolated 
from the nasal epithelial cells and Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts
derived from this patient was reversely transcribed and a region extending from
exon 3 to exon 7 of the gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and
analyzed. Three abnormal products were identified, suggesting the presence of
three aberrant transcripts, and their profiles were identical in both cell types.
Two of the products were found to be missing either exon 4 or exon 5 as
anticipated from the transcripts from the 621 + 1G-->T or 711 + 1G-->T alleles,
respectively. The third product was apparently derived from an alternatively
spliced mRNA species in the absence of the nominal splice site (in 621 + 1G-->T) 
through the use of a cryptic splice donor sequence (TT528/GTGAGG) within exon 4. 
Although reading frames appeared to be preserved in all three putative
transcripts, significant portions of the presumed first and second transmembrane 
spans as well as the immediately following cytoplasmic domain would be deleted
from the mutant CFTR polypeptides, if made. These observations are consistent
with a loss of CFTR function in this cystic fibrosis patient.
