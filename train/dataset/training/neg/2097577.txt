To evaluate the potential impact of a strongly neurotropic virus on the matricial
fibronectin (FN) of a given neural cell type, first subculture of rat astrocytes 
were inoculated with either a low (0.1-0.5) or a high MOI (10-100) of Herpes
simplex virus-type 1 (HSV-1). Infected samples, as well as matched controls, were
harvested from 12 to 72 h post-inoculation and processed for extracellular FN
labeling by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) method. Following low MOI,
multinucleated cell formation and syncytial development drastically modified
peripheral FN, since the typical loose network was largely replaced by a
patch-like appearance. At high MOI, when viral action caused further cytoplasmic 
retraction leading to rounded or stellate cells, the FN pattern was remarkably
altered, even with total FN loss around highly retracted cells. It may be
concluded that a virus such as HSV-1, capable of modifying astrocyte morphology, 
induces a redistribution or loss of pericellular FN.
