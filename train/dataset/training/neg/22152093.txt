BACKGROUND: Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is a T-lymphtropic and neurotropic virus 
that can infect various types of cells. Sequential studies reported that
apoptosis of glia and neurons induced by HHV-6 might act a potential trigger for 
some central nervous system (CNS) diseases. HHV-6 is involved in the pathogenesis
of encephalitis, multiple sclerosis (MS) and fatigue syndrome. However, the
mechanisms responsible for the apoptosis of infected CNS cells induced by HHV-6
are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the cell death processes of
primary human fetal astrocytes (PHFAs) during productive HHV-6A infection and the
underlying mechanisms.
RESULTS: HHV-6A can cause productive infection in primary human fetal astrocytes.
Annexin V-PI staining and electron microscopic analysis indicated that HHV-6A was
an inducer of apoptosis. The cell death was associated with activation of
caspase-3 and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which is known to 
be an important substrate for activated caspase-3. Caspase-8 and -9 were also
significantly activated in HHV-6A-infected cells. Moreover, HHV-6A infection led 
to Bax up-regulation and Bcl-2 down-regulation. HHV-6A infection increased the
release of Smac/Diablo, AIF and cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol, which 
induced apoptosis via the caspase-dependent and -independent pathways. In
addition, we also found that anti-apoptotic factors such as IAPs and NF-ÎºB
decreased in HHV-6A infected PHFAs.
CONCLUSION: This is the first demonstration of caspase-dependent and -independent
apoptosis in HHV-6A-infected glial cells. These findings would be helpful in
understanding the mechanisms of CNS diseases caused by HHV-6.
