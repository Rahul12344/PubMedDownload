We have found that transcription of the pregenome of an avian hepadnavirus, duck 
hepatitis B virus (DHBV), is dependent on the presence of a small element in the 
5' transcribed region of the pregenome-encoding sequence. This element, which we 
have named pet (positive effector of transcription), exerts its effect in cis in 
a position and orientation-dependent manner, suggesting that it may function as
part of the nascent pregenome transcript. The requirement for pet depends on the 
presence in the transcription unit of a region of the DHBV genome located
upstream of the envelope promoters, which specifically suppresses transcription
of templates lacking pet. In the presence of this region, deletion of pet
activates transcription from downstream promoters, suggesting that pregenome
transcription complexes fail to reach the downstream promoters. In vitro
transcription experiments support the model that pet is required for
transcription elongation on the DHBV template. We speculate that pet is required 
to suppress transcription termination during the first passage of pregenome
transcription complexes through a viral termination region on the circular viral 
DNA.
