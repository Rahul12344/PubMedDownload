AIDS -- the deadly deception exposed.

Ankomah B.

PIP: Neville Hodgkinson, a British journalist, has written a book in which he
argues that AIDS is not caused by HIV alone, if at all. Hodgkinson further posits
that AIDS has always been, and still is, a gay and heavy drug users' problem, and
that no deadly epidemic of AIDS exists in Africa. Even the HIV serodiagnosis test
is flawed. International clamor and intensive research efforts over the HIV/AIDS 
pandemic have just been part of a deadly deception. Hodgkinson has written and
published a book in which his arguments are presented. Hodgkinson claims that
this false paradigm of AIDS causation is harming patients, the public, and public
resources, and that a new approach is urgently needed to establish the true
causes of AIDS and how to prevent and treat them. However, researchers and health
professionals worldwide refuse to reorient their research for fear of losing
research funding and their livelihoods. No cure exists for AIDS only because
researchers have been studying the wrong virus.
