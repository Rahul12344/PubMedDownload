We determined the entire RNA1, 2 and 3 sequences of two prunus necrotic ringspot 
virus (PNRSV) isolates, Chr3 from cherry and Pch12 from peach, obtained from an
orchard in the Niagara Fruit Belt, Canada. The RNA1, 2 and 3 of the two isolates 
share nucleotide sequence identities of 98.6%, 98.4% and 94.5%, respectively.
Their RNA1- and 2-encoded amino acid sequences are about 98% identical to the
corresponding sequences of a cherry isolate, CH57, the only other PNRSV isolate
with complete RNA1 and 2 sequences available. Phylogenetic analysis of the coat
protein and movement protein encoded by RNA3 of Pch12 and Chr3 and published
PNRSV isolates indicated that Chr3 belongs to the PV96 group and Pch12 belongs to
the PV32 group.
