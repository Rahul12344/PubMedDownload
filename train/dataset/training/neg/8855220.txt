Human hepatitis B virus genome encodes a protein, termed HBx, that is widely
recognized as a transcriptional transactivator. While HBx does not directly bind 
cis-acting transcriptional control elements, it has been shown to associate with 
cellular proteins that bind DNA. Because HBx transactivated a large number of
viral/cellular transcriptional control elements, we looked for its targets within
the components of the basal transcriptional machinery. This search led to the
identification of its interactions with TFIIH. Here, we show that HBx interacts
with yeast and mammalian TFIIH complexes both in vitro and in vivo. These
interactions between HBx and the components of TFIIH are supported by several
lines of evidence including results from immunoprocedures and direct methods of
measuring interactions. We have identified ERCC3 and ERCC2 DNA helicase subunits 
of holoenzyme TFIIH as targets of HBx interactions. Furthermore, the DNA helicase
activity of purified TFIIH from rat liver and, individually, the ERCC2 component 
of TFIIH is stimulated in the presence of HBx. These observations suggest a role 
for HBx in transcription and DNA repair.
