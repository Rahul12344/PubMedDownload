We have investigated the ability of Sf-caspase-1 and two mammalian caspases,
caspase-1 and caspase-3, to induce apoptosis in Spodoptera frugiperda Sf-21
insect cells. While the transient expression of the pro-Sf-caspase-1 did not
induce apoptosis, expression of the pro-domain deleted form, p31, or coexpression
of the two subunits of mature Sf-caspase-1, p19 and p12, induced apoptosis in
Sf-21 cells. The behavior of Sf-caspase-1 resembled that of the closely related
mammalian caspase, caspase-3, and contrasted with that of the mammalian
caspase-1, the pro-form of which was active in inducing apoptosis in Sf-21 cells.
The baculovirus caspase inhibitor P35 blocked apoptosis induced by active forms
of all three caspases. In contrast, members of the baculovirus inhibitor of
apoptosis (IAP) family failed to block active caspase-induced apoptosis. However,
during viral infection, expression of OpIAP or CpIAP blocked the activation of
pro-Sf-caspase-1 and the associated induction of apoptosis. Thus, the mechanism
by which baculovirus IAPs inhibit apoptosis is distinct from the mechanism by
which P35 blocks apoptosis and involves inhibition of the activation of
pro-caspases like Sf-caspase-1.
