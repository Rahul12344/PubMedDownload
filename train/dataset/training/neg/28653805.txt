Aberrant microRNA expression is involved in the regulation of various cellular
processes, such as proliferation and metastasis in multiple diseases including
cancers. MicroRNA-30e-5p (miR-30e) was previously reported as an oncogenic or
tumour suppressing miRNA in some malignancies, but its function in lung
adenocarcinoma (LAC) remains largely undefined. In this study, we found that the 
expression of miR-30e was increased in LAC tissues and cell lines, associated
with tumour size and represented an independent prognostic factor for overall
survival and recurrence of LAC patients. Further functional experiments showed
that knockdown of miR-30e suppressed cell growth while its overexpression
promoted growth of LAC cells and xenografts in vitro and in vivo.
Mechanistically, PTPN13 was identified as the direct target of miR-30e in LAC, in
which PTPN13 expression was down-regulated in LAC tissues and showed the inverse 
correlation with miR-30e expression. Overexpression of PTPN13 inhibited cell
growth and rescued the proliferation-promoting effect of miR-30e through
inhibition of the EGFR signalling. Altogether, our findings suggest that miR-30e 
could function as an oncogene in LAC via targeting PTPN13 and act as a potential 
therapeutic target for treating LAC.
