PEGylation is an effective strategy for reducing biospecific interactions for
pharmaceuticals. The plant virus Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) has been studied for 
potential nanobiomedical applications by virtue of its natural interactions with 
mammalian endothelial cells. To investigate the degree of PEGylation required to 
retarget CPMV-based formulations to other destinations, two CPMV-PEG
formulations, CPMV-PEG1000 (P1) and CPMV-PEG2000 (P2) were tested. Modeling
suggested that the PEG chains were displayed as flattened mushrooms on the
particle with an estimated surface grafting area of 0.53% for P1 and 0.83% for
P2. Only the P2 formulation effectively shielded the particles from interacting
with cells or tissues, suggesting that either key interacting regions on the
particle surface were blocked or that a sufficient hydration shell had been
generated to inhibit cellular interactions. The large CPMV surface area available
after PEGylation allows further attachment of imaging and therapeutic molecules
to the particle to generate multifunctionality.
