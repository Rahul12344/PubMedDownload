Isolation and preliminary characterization of herpes Channel Catfish virus DNA.

Robin J, Rodrigue A.

The DNA of Channel Catfish virus (CCV) was selectively extracted from infected
cells with a 5% solution of sodium deoxycholate, deproteinized using sodium
sarcosinate and pronase, and purified by phenol extraction followed by
equilibrium density gradient centrifugation in a cesium chloride solution. CCV
DNA displays a buoyant density of 1.715 g/cm3 in such a solution, as would be
expected from a duplex DNA containing 56.1% of guanine plus cytosine. As
estimated from both its sedimentation coefficient and length in the electron
microscope, CCV DNA is a linear duplex molecule of approximately 85 x 10(6)
daltons.
