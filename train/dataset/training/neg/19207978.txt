Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection has considerably diminished in Europe since the
1970-1980s. The prevalence rates of chronic hepatitis D in HBsAg carriers in
Italy have declined from 25% at the beginning of the 1980s to 8% in the 1990s.
Similar declines in prevalence have been reported in Spain, Taiwan and Turkey.
Better public health standards, HBV vaccination and the effect of measures to
control the spread of human immunodeficiency virus have brought about a decline
in the numbers of HBsAg carriers and therefore a decline in the HBV-dependent
HDV. However, HDV has not declined further in Europe in the last decade, as the
pool of fresh infections in migrants from HDV-endemic areas is counterbalancing
the shrinking cohort of long-standing domestic infections acquired in the
epidemic of the 1970-1980s. Hepatitis D remains an important health problem
outside Europe, and new foci of infection continue to be identified in developing
countries.
