OBJECTIVES: A study was conducted to determine the prevalence of HPV infection in
cervical lesions of Brazilian women and to search for specific risk factors
associated to progression to malignancy.
METHODS: Five hundred and fourteen paraffin-embedded biopsies obtained from
female cervical lesions were classified according to the Bethesda System in low
grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), high grade SIL (HSIL) and squamous 
cell carcinoma (SCC). Specimens were tested for the presence of human
papillomavirus (HPV) types 6/11,16/18 and 31/33/35 DNA using non-isotopic in situ
hybridization.
RESULTS: HPV prevalence ranged from 85.6% in LSIL to 55.2% in SCC. Patients were 
analysed through an 8 year period: 27. 1% of the lesions spontaneously regressed 
while 43.6% persisted and 29.3% progressed to carcinoma. High risk types were
present in 80.5% (Crude OR 13.8, P=0.0003) of the progressive lesions. Possible
co-factors have also been evaluated: history of other sexually transmitted
diseases, mainly syphilis, showed to be positively related to progression
(Adjusted OR 13.0, P=0.0003) while oral contraceptive use and tobacco smoking
were not significantly related to it (P>O.1). Association of two or more
co-factors also proved to be related to progression.
CONCLUSIONS: Oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18 and history of other concurrent
sexually transmitted diseases were found to be significantly associated with
progression to cancer. Smoking and the use of oral contraceptives did not show a 
relation to cancer establishment, but when they were associated a significant
co-operative role in progression was demonstrated. Our study indicated that HPV
and other risk factors for cancer can act together, corroborating the observation
of a poor prognosis for Brazilian women presenting SILs.
