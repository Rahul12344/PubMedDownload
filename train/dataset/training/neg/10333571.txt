We have cloned and sequenced a cDNA from Drosophila melanogaster that encodes a
protein homologous to the peritrophins, a family of chitin-binding proteins from 
the peritrophic matrix of insects. Unexpectedly, the gene, Gasp, is expressed in 
the embryonic tracheae. We suggest that this family of proteins may be present in
other tissues than the peritrophic matrix, particularly where nutrient or gas
exchange are important, and/or where invasion by parasites or viruses is
possible. We have also mapped two similar genes that had been sequenced by the
Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project, and find that these three very similar genes 
are not clustered, but are located on three different chromosomes.
