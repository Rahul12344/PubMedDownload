The effectiveness of nucleoside analogs in blocking viral multiplication was
evaluated using an immortalized human neuroglial cell line capable of sustaining 
a persistent JCV infection, SVG-JC. Results from in situ DNA hybridization and
hemagglutination assays performed on drug treated cultures were used as a measure
of viral DNA replication and multiplication, respectively. Of the three drugs
tested, Ara-C (cytosine arabinoside), AZT (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine), and
cidofovir (S)-1-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonylmethoxypropyl] cytosine), only Ara-C
showed a significant effect in decreasing active JCV replication and
multiplication. In vitro data, using different cell types and virus strains have 
shown that specific drugs can indeed modulate viral infection. However, such
modulation has not previously been demonstrated in those cells of the CNS which
are specifically targeted by JCV. The SVG-JC cells represent a unique system with
which further studies can be conducted on the effects of drugs on brain derived
cells that are susceptible to viral infection.
