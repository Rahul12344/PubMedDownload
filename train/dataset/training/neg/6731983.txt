Clinical and immunologic responses of pigs to African swine fever virus isolated 
from the Western Hemisphere.

Hamdy FM, Dardiri AH.

Pigs in the United States were exposed to African swine fever (ASF) virus
isolated from pigs in Brazil and the Dominican Republic. The former were examined
for clinical response, lesions, viremia, and antibody response. Sequential blood 
samples were tested for the presence of ASF virus by the hemadsorption test (in
swine buffy coat cell culture) and for antibody to ASF virus by the enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay. The incubation period was 3 to 5 days; inoculated pigs had
fever for 8 to 16 days (mean 12.5 days) and viremia at 3 to 35 days after
inoculation and few died. Inoculated pigs developed antibodies at 7 days after
inoculation which were detectable until the termination of the experiment (10th
month). Reinoculation of some of the surviving pigs with the homologous isolate
at approximately 6 months after exposure did not induce clinical response,
viremia, nor anamnestic antibody response. In contrast, challenge exposures of
convalescent pigs with the Lisbon-60 viral strain approximately 5 weeks after
exposure to the Brazilian strain produced death, in spite of an anamnestic
antibody response.
