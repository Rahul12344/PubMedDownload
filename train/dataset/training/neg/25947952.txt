Severe chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (CAEBV) disease is defined as a severe
progressive illness lasting 6Â months or longer with infiltration of tissues with 
EBV-positive lymphocytes, markedly elevated levels of EBV DNA in the blood, and
no known immunodeficiency such as HIV. These patients usually have fever,
splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and may have markedly elevated EBV antibody titers
to viral capsid antigen. Although the cause of most cases of severe CAEBV is
unknown, one well-documented case was associated with compound heterozygous
mutations in PRF1 (perforin 1). Here we report a patient with prolonged severe
CAEBV who underwent bone marrow transplant for his disease and subsequently was
found to have compound heterozygous mutations in STXBP2 (MUNC18-2) as well as a
heterozygous mutation in PRF1 (perforin 1).
