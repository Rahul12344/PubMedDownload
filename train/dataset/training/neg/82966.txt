Sodium pyrophosphate inhibition of RNA.DNA hybrid degradation by reverse
transcriptase.

Myers JC, Spiegelman S.

Sodium pyrophosphate inhibits synthesis of anticomplementary DNA during a reverse
transcriptase (RNA-directed DNA nucleotidyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.7) catalyzed
reaction. In the presence of pyrophosphate, the complementary DNA remains stably 
complexed to the RNA template. In the absence of pyrophosphate, the DNA. RNA
hybrid template is degraded and anticomplementary DNA is synthesized. High
concentrations of additives containing phosphodiester bonds appear to inhibit the
ribonuclease H activity (hybrid nuclease, EC 3.1.4.34) of the reverse
transcriptase, therby preventing formation of RNA primers necessary for the
synthesis of anticomplementary DNA.
