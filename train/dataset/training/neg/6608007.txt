Role of T-lymphocyte subsets in recovery from herpes simplex virus infection.

Larsen HS, Feng MF, Horohov DW, Moore RN, Rouse BT.

Our investigations probed the nature of different T-lymphocyte subsets effecting 
clearance of herpes simplex virus after infection of the pinna. Cell populations 
from animals recently infected subcutaneously or intraperitoneally (acute
population) or from animals infected 6 weeks previously (primed population) or
the latter cells reimmunized in vitro with virus (memory population) were
studied. Viral clearance was a function of the Lyt 1+2- subset in the acute
population, but with the memory population both Lyt 1+ and Lyt 2+ cells affected 
clearance. In primed populations, viral clearance was effected only by the Lyt 2+
subset. The ability of the various cell populations to adoptively transfer
delayed-type hypersensitivity was also studied. Only acute population cells from 
animals infected subcutaneously and memory population cells transferred
delayed-type hypersensitivity. In both cases, the cell subtype was Lyt 1+2-. Our 
results demonstrated that the delayed-type hypersensitivity response does not
always correlate with immunity to herpes simplex virus. Multiple subsets of T
cells participate in viral clearance, and their respective importances vary
according to the stage of the virus-host interaction.
