BACKGROUND: Infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive mothers 
are at a higher risk for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Host genetic
background plays an important role in determining the strength of immune response
to vaccination. We conducted this study to investigate the association between
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and Mitogen-activated protein kinase eight (MAPK8)
polymorphisms and low response to hepatitis B vaccines.
METHODS: A total of 753 infants of HBsAg positive and hepatitis Be antigen
(HBeAg) negative mothers from the prevention of mother-to-infant transmission of 
HBV cohort were included. Five tag single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs)
(rs1799964, rs1800629, rs3093671, rs769177 and rs769178) in TNF and two tag SNPs 
(rs17780725 and rs3827680) in MAPK8 were genotyped using the MassARRAY platform.
RESULTS: A higher percentage of breastfeeding (P = 0.013) and a higher level of
Ab titers were observed in high responders (P < 0.001). The MAPK8 rs17780725 AA
genotype increased the risk of low response to hepatitis B vaccines (OR = 3.176, 
95% CI: 1.137-8.869). Additionally, subjects with the AA genotype may have a
lower Ab titer than subjects with GA or GG genotypes (P = 0.051). Compared to
infants who were breastfed, infants who were not breastfed had an increased risk 
of low response to hepatitis B vaccine (OR = 2.901, 95% CI:1.306-6.441).
CONCLUSIONS: MAPK8 polymorphisms are associated with immune response to HBV
vaccinations in infants of HBsAg(+)/HBeAg(-) mothers.
