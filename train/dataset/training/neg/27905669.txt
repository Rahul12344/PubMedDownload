During the past two decades, several studies showed reduced rates of
hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis after 
interferon-based antiviral therapies respect to untreated controls, even without 
reaching viral clearance. The recent development of new all-oral regimens with
direct-acting antivirals has radically improved the therapeutic management of
hepatitis C. Nevertheless, paradoxical, or at least unexpected, high rates of
both occurrence and recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after a treatment with
direct-acting antivirals, have been reported in the recent literature. These
findings generated a strong rebound in the hepatology community and are at
present still controversial. We sought to compare the hepatocellular carcinoma
recurrence-free survival of a historical cohort treated with pegylated
interferon/ribavirin and an untreated cohort with a cohort treated with
direct-acting antivirals.
