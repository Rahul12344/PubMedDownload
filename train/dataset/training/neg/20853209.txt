Although the medical advances in the area of human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) have undoubtedly improved the
length and quality of life for those who are HIV-affected and medication
adherent, there are still many psychosocial obstacles to effective HIV/AIDS
medication adherence. Recent research has focused on one such obstacle. The
significant link between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and HIV. This
article reports on the nature of this relationship with a cross-sectional study
of active clients (n = 186) who were receiving HIV services from community-based 
settings in the New York City area. With the use of the PTSD Checklist (PCL),
this study determined that more than half of the sample tested positively for
PTSD. Policy and clinical implications of this and other findings are discussed.
