Extensive papillomatosis was identified in a heifer born and raised in Scotland
and a steer born and raised in England. In both cases, the papillomas extended
from the mouth and tongue to the reticulum. Although cases of florid
papillomatosis of the upper gastrointestinal tract occur relatively frequently in
cattle grazing on bracken fern in the Scottish Highlands, no such cases have been
reported previously in English cattle. Histopathological examination of the
papillomas showed that the lesions were wholly epithelial, with acanthosis,
hyperkeratosis and the pathognomonic koilocytes characteristic of papillomavirus 
infection. Bovine papillomavirus type 4 (BPV-4) was identified by molecular
amplification and sequencing of the viral genome.
