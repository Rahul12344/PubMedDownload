OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that children experiencing first febrile
seizures caused by human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) have an increased risk for
recurrent seizures when compared with children experiencing first febrile
seizures attributed to other illnesses.
DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Descriptive prospective study of 36 HHV-6
culture-positive children and a matched subgroup of 86 HHV-6 culture-negative
children, all of whom had their first febrile seizures evaluated in a tertiary
care emergency department and were followed for at least 12 months, with an
average follow-up of 35.7 months.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: The recurrence of seizures among HHV-6 culture-positive 
and HHV-6 culture-negative children with no known previous neurologic deficits.
RESULTS: A decreased incidence of recurrent seizures occurred in children whose
first febrile seizures were caused by HHV-6. Twenty percent of HHV-6
culture-positive children and 40% of HHV-6 culture-negative children (P < 0.038) 
experienced a recurrent seizure within 1 year of their first febrile seizure. The
mean time to recurrence within 12 months was 8.6 months for children with HHV-6
infection and 3.8 months (P < 0.001) for children without HHV-6 infection. Most
recurrent seizures occurred within 12 months of a first febrile seizure for both 
HHV-6-positive and HHV-6-negative children (88 and 91%).
CONCLUSIONS: Children who had their first febrile seizures caused by primary
HHV-6 infection did not demonstrate an increased risk for recurrent seizures when
compared with children whose first febrile seizures were from other etiologies.
