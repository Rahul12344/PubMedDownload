Genetic complexity of HIV-1 is brought about by recombination between HIV-1
subtypes which leads to the development of epidemiologically significant founder 
strains. In the present study, the near full-length genome sequence of an HIV-1
isolate from an injecting drug user of Manipur (India) was determined, which
evidenced the presence of a novel HIV-1 BC recombinant strain. Near full-length
genome was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primer walking approach. 
The recombination break points were detected using bootscan and simplot analyses.
This isolate exhibited a mosaic structure consisting of subtype C backbone with
subtype B insertions at the upstream of pol gene (3026-3259) and the downstream
of env gene which spanned till the nef gene (8183-8961). Phylogenetic
relationships determined with neighbor-joining trees, revealed that the subtype C
sequences clustered with sequences from Indian subtype C HIV-1 strains, and the
subtype B sequences clustered with HIV-1 subtype B strains from Thailand. This
finding may create a complex scenario of HIV-1 epidemic among the injecting drug 
users of Manipur in near future.
