Site-specific methylases induce the SOS DNA repair response in Escherichia coli.

Heitman J, Model P.

Expression of the site-specific adenine methylase HhaII (GmeANTC, where me is
methyl) or PstI (CTGCmeAG) induced the SOS DNA repair response in Escherichia
coli. In contrast, expression of methylases indigenous to E. coli either did not 
induce SOS (EcoRI [GAmeATTC] or induced SOS to a lesser extent (dam [GmeATC]).
Recognition of adenine-methylated DNA required the product of a previously
undescribed gene, which we named mrr (methylated adenine recognition and
restriction). We suggest that mrr encodes an endonuclease that cleaves DNA
containing N6-methyladenine and that DNA double-strand breaks induce the SOS
response. Cytosine methylases foreign to E. coli (MspI [meCCGG], HaeIII [GGmeCC],
BamHI [GGATmeCC], HhaI [GmeCGC], BsuRI [GGmeCC], and M.Spr) also induced SOS,
whereas one indigenous to E. coli (EcoRII [CmeCA/TGG]) did not. SOS induction by 
cytosine methylation required the rglB locus, which encodes an endonuclease that 
cleaves DNA containing 5-hydroxymethyl- or 5-methylcytosine (E. A. Raleigh and G.
Wilson, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:9070-9074, 1986).
