The coat protein of bacteriophage MS2 is known to bind specifically to an RNA
hairpin formed within the MS2 genome. Structurally this hairpin is built up by an
RNA double helix interrupted by one unpaired nucleotide and closed by a
four-nucleotide loop. We have performed crystallographic studies of complexes
between MS2 coat protein capsids and four RNA hairpin variants in order to
evaluate the minimal requirements for tight binding to the coat protein and to
obtain more information about the three-dimensional structure of these hairpins. 
An RNA fragment including the four loop nucleotides and a two-base-pair stem but 
without the unpaired nucleotide is sufficient for binding to the coat protein
shell under the conditions used in this study. In contrast, an RNA fragment
containing a stem with the unpaired nucleotide but missing the loop nucleotides
does not bind to the protein shell.
