BACKGROUND: Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the major cause of cervical cancer.
Use of HPV genotyping in cervical screening programs and for monitoring the
effectiveness of HPV vaccination programs requires access to economical,
high-throughput technology.
METHODS: We used the Sequenom MassARRAY platform to develop a high-throughput
mass spectrometric (MS) method for detecting 14 specific oncogenic HPV genotypes 
in multiplex PCR products. We compared results from 532 cervical cell samples to 
the comparison method, reverse dot blot hybridization (RDBH).
RESULTS: The MS method detected all samples found positive by RDBH. In addition, 
the MS method identified 5 cases of cervical disease (cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia of grade I or higher) that RDBH analysis had missed. Discrepancies in
specific genotypes were noted in 20 samples, all positive by MS, with an overall 
concordance of kappa = 0.945.
CONCLUSIONS: The MS high-throughput method, with a processing capacity of 10 x
384 samples within 2 working days and at a consumables cost of about US$2 per
sample, performed as well as or better than the comparison method.
