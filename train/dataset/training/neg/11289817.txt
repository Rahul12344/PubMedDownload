To compare the gene expression profiles of uninfected and Bombyx mori
nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV)-infected BmN cells, we constructed four cDNA
libraries for mock-infected cells, and cells at 2, 6, and 12 h postinfection
(h.p.i.). A total of 2645 partial sequences obtained for expressed-sequence-tags 
(ESTs) from the libraries were categorized using BLAST searches of the public
database and the BmNPV genome sequence. The following proportions of
BmNPV-derived ESTs were observed: 0.4, 4.5, and 57% at 2, 6, and 12 h.p.i,
respectively. Moreover, 31 BmNPV open reading frames (ORFs) were newly identified
for transcripts and the baculovirus-repeated ORFs (bro) showed the highest levels
of expression in the 12 h.p.i. library. Most of the host genes decreased in
number as the infection progressed. However, several, including cytochrome c
oxidase 1, increased in the late stages of infection. Two apoptosis-related host 
genes were also identified.
