OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to compare the findings of fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) detection of human telomerase RNA gene (hTERC)
amplification with that of cytological and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA tests
and explore the possibility to improve the accuracy of the diagnoses of
high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer.
METHODS: A total of 201 specimens of liquid-based thin-layer cytological
examination findings were collected and detected by HPV DNA test and hTERC
detected by FISH. All women underwent colposcopy and histological examination of 
biopsy specimen if needed. The 3 screening methods were compared based on
histological examination of colposcopic biopsies.
RESULTS: The amplification of hTERC showed 6.06% in normal or inflammation cases,
10.00% in CIN 1, 66.67% in CIN 2, 72.50% in CIN 3, and 100.00% in carcinoma, with
significant difference between the low- (<or=CIN 1 or <or=low-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesion) and high-grade (>or=CIN 2 or >or=atypical squamous cells 
in which high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cannot be excluded) cervical 
lesions (P < 0.001). The hTERC amplification rate was consistent with abnormal
rates of cytological and histological diagnoses. The detection of hTERC
amplification had a much higher accuracy (87.56%) than the cytological (80.10%)
and HPV DNA test (77.61%) findings.
CONCLUSIONS: Using FISH to detect the amplification of hTERC had a much higher
specificity and accuracy for the diagnoses of high-grade CIN and cervical cancer 
than cytological and HPV DNA test findings, suggesting that this detection might 
be a useful and specific screening method in cervical cancer and precancerous
lesions.
