BACKGROUND: In infants and children with maternally acquired human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, treatment with a single
antiretroviral agent has limited efficacy. We evaluated the safety and efficacy
of a three-drug regimen in a small group of maternally infected infants.
METHODS: Zidovudine, didanosine, and nevirapine were administered in combination 
orally to eight infants 2 to 16 months of age. The efficacy of antiretroviral
treatment was evaluated by serial measurements of plasma HIV-1 RNA, quantitative 
plasma cultures, and quantitative cultures of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells.
RESULTS: The three-drug regimen was well tolerated, without clinically important 
adverse events. Within four weeks, there were reductions in plasma levels of
HIV-1 RNA of at least 96 percent (1.5 log) in seven of the eight study patients. 
Over the 6-month study period, replication of HIV-1 was controlled in two infants
who began therapy at 2 1/2 months of age. Plasma RNA levels were reduced by 0.5
to 1.5 log in five of the other six infants.
CONCLUSIONS: Although further observations are needed, it appears that in infants
with maternally acquired HIV-1 infection, combined treatment with zidovudine,
didanosine, and nevirapine is well tolerated and has sustained efficacy against
HIV-1.
