PURPOSE: To describe the prevalence of nine HIV-1 co-receptor polymorphisms in
Luxembourg (CCR5-Delta 32, CCR5-58755-A/G, CCR5m303, CCR5-59029-A/G, CCR2-64I,
CCR5-59653-C/T, CX(3) CR1-V249I, CX(3) CR1-T280M, and SDF1-3'A) in 288
HIV-1-infected patients and in 158 uninfected, healthy volunteers.
METHOD: The presence of mutations was detected using PCR-restriction fragment
length polymorphism (RFLP)-based methods.
RESULTS: We did not find any significant differences in genotype distributions
and allele frequencies between infected and uninfected participants in
Luxembourg. The distribution of genotypes agreed in all groups with
Hardy-Weinberg predicted proportions. CCR5-Delta 32 was significantly associated 
with HIV-1-infected slow progressor patients.
CONCLUSION: Overall, allele frequencies were comparable to frequencies reported
in previous studies in Caucasian populations.
