BACKGROUND: Direct-acting antivirals (DAA) for the treatment of hepatitis C virus
(HCV) have drastically improved outcomes but are also very costly. For this
reason, priority for treatment is often given to patients with a higher fibrosis 
score at baseline by payers and providers rather than treating all eligible
patients. Simulation studies have suggested that waiting to treat patients until 
fibrosis 3-4 may be more costly and result in worse outcomes; however, real-world
implications are unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To determine drug costs and outcomes for treating hepatitis C in
patients with fibrosis scores of 0-2 and 3-4 at baseline in a real-world
ambulatory care setting.
METHODS: A total of 322 patients at 36 clinical sites in Massachusetts with HCV
genotype 1-4 and a prescription for at least 1 DAA medication between May 2011
and October 2015 were included. Retrospective and prospective chart reviews were 
completed by the primary investigator. Data were collected through April 2016.
The primary outcome for the study was to determine the mean drug cost per
sustained virologic response (SVR) achieved for patients with fibrosis scores of 
0-2 and 3-4. Drug costs were calculated using average wholesale price and only
included the cost of HCV medications, not for adjunctive medications, blood work,
hospitalizations, anticipated complications, or any other projected medical
costs.
RESULTS: The mean ± SD (median) drug cost per patient was $130,391 ± 46,787
(113,400) and completed treatment duration was 15.0 ± 8.9 (12) weeks. The mean
drug cost per SVR was $155,662 for all patients with a mean drug cost per SVR of 
$122,452 and $178,401 for patients with fibrosis scores of 0-2 and 3-4,
respectively. SVR rates were 83.5% (269/322) for all patients and 92.2% (107/116)
and 78.6% (162/206) for patients with fibrosis scores of 0-2 and 3-4,
respectively. Ledipasvir/ sofosbuvir; sofosbuvir + ribavirin;
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin; sofos-buvir + interferon + ribavirin;
boceprevir + interferon + ribavirin; sofosbu-vir + simeprevir; and telaprevir +
interferon + ribavirin had a mean drug cost per SVR of $123,559; $153,347;
$157,969; $184,800; $248,640; $251,550; and $373,333; respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Real-world knowledge about outcomes and drug costs may influence
future decisions. Further studies are needed to evaluate emerging treatment
options and to reflect changes in treatment guidelines.
DISCLOSURES: No outside funding supported this study. The authors report no
conflicts of interest. Data in this study were presented as a poster at the ASHP 
Midyear Clinical Meeting; New Orleans, Louisiana; December 9, 2015; at the
Massachusetts Society of Health-System Pharmacists Annual Meeting; Newton,
Massachusetts; April 12, 2016; and at Eastern States Conference for Pharmacy
Residents and Preceptors; Hershey, Pennsylvania; May 2, 2016. Study concept and
design was primarily contributed by Bach, along with Zaiken. Bach took the lead
in data collection, data interpretation, and preparation of the manuscript, along
with Zaiken.
