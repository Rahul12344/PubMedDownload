Ebola is a dangerous virus transmitted by animals and humans and to date there is
no curable agent for such a deadly infectious disease. In this study,
pharmacoinformatics-based methods were adopted to find effective novel chemical
entities against Ebola virus. A well predictive and statistical robust
pharmacophore model was developed from known Ebola virus inhibitors collected
from the literature. The model explained the significance of each of hydrogen
bond acceptor and donor, and two hydrophobic regions for activity. The National
Cancer Institute and Asinex (Antiviral library) databases were screened using the
final validated pharmacophore model. Initial hits were further screened with a
set of criteria and finally eight molecules from both databases were proposed as 
promising anti Ebola agents. Further molecular docking and molecular dynamics
studies were carried out and it was found that the proposed molecules possessed
capability to interact with amino residues of Ebola protein as well as retaining 
equilibrium of protein-ligand systems. Finally, the binding energies were
calculated using molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area approach and 
all proposed molecules showed strong binding affinity towards the Ebola protein
receptor. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.
