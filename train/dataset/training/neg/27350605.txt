Since the discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells there has been intense
interest in understanding the mechanisms that allow a somatic cell to be
reprogrammed back to a pluripotent state. Several groups have studied the
alterations in gene expression that occur as somatic cells modify their genome to
that of an embryonic stem cell. Underpinning many of the gene expression changes 
are modifications to the epigenetic profile of the associated chromatin. We have 
used a large-scale shRNA screen to identify epigenetic modifiers that act as
barriers to reprogramming. We have uncovered an important role for TRIM28 in
cells resisting transition between somatic and pluripotent states. TRIM28
achieves this by maintaining the H3K9me3 repressed state and keeping endogenous
retroviruses (ERVs) silenced. We propose that knockdown of TRIM28 during
reprogramming results in more plastic H3K9me3 domains, dysregulation of genes
nearby H3K9me3 marks, and up regulation of ERVs, thus facilitating the transition
through reprogramming. Stem Cells 2017;35:147-157.
