A hepatitis B virus (HBV) carrier who is positive for hepatitis B surface (HBs)
antigen but negative for hepatitis B core (HBc) antibody despite persistent HBV
infection, is designated as having hepatitis B virus 2 (HBV2). HBV2 is reported
to be induced by mild-grade hepatitis. Patients with HBV2 have been reported in
Taiwan and Senegal. In the present study, we determined the nucleotide (nt)
sequence of the precore/core gene coding region and X gene region of the HBV DNA 
sequence in 7 subjects who were positive for HBs antigen and negative for HBc
antibody. HBV DNA was detected by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Nested 
PCR was carried out to amplify the precore/core and X open reading frames (ORFs) 
of HBV DNA. The second PCR products were sequenced, followed by investigation of 
nt homology. There were no deletions nor insertions in the nt sequence of the
precore/core and X ORFs in the HBV DNA of these 7 patients, and mutations were
found only sporadically in the 7 patients. Also, there were no common amino acid 
substitutions in the examined regions of the amino acid sequence of HBV in the 7 
patients, and we could not find a common mutation in the examined regions of HBV 
DNA that could potentially contribute to the development of negativity for HBc
antibody. Thus, it is suggested that negativity for HBc antibody in patients with
HBV2 is due to an immune response abnormality in the host.
