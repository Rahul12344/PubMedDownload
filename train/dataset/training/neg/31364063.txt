New surveillance methods employing mass spectrometry (MS) have been developed to 
characterize the influenza virus and, by extension, other biopathogens at the
molecular level. The structure and antigenicity of protein antigens on the
surface of the viral capsid are screened in a single step employing the
immunoproteomics MS-based approach. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) coupled to gel electrophoresis is used both to
identify viral antigens and screen their antigenicity. Evidence that
antigen-antibody complexes, and protein complexes more generally, can survive on 
conventional MALDI targets has allowed both the primary structure and
antigenicity of viral strains to be rapidly screened and protein epitopes to be
identified with molecular precision. The approach should aid in future screening 
of the virus and assist in the development of immunogenic peptide constructs as
alternative treatments to vaccination over the whole inactivated virus. The assay
adds to the repertoire of mass spectrometric approaches for examining
antigen-antibody interactions, in particular, and protein complexes, in general, 
without the need to immobilize, tag, or recover either component.
