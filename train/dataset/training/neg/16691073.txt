In this survey, 213 patients in an antiretroviral treatment programme in Phnom
Penh, Cambodia, were tested for GB virus C (GBV-C) RNA before treatment
initiation. Most had advanced HIV infection, only 34 having CD4 cell counts > 200
cells/microl. GBV-C-RNA was detected in 35 patients. The proportion with positive
GBV-C-RNA decreased dramatically with CD4 cell counts < 100 cells/microl. In
multivariate analysis, low CD4 cell counts, tuberculosis, anaemia, and
traditional medicine were independently and negatively associated with GBV-C-RNA 
detection.
