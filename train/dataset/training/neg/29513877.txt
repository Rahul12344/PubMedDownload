Viruses of trypanosomatids are now being extensively studied because of their
diversity and the roles they play in flagellates' biology. Among the most
prominent examples are leishmaniaviruses implicated in pathogenesis of Leishmania
parasites. Here, we present a historical overview of this field, starting with
early reports of virus-like particles on electron microphotographs, and
culminating in detailed molecular descriptions of viruses obtained using modern
next generation sequencing-based techniques. Because of their diversity,
different life cycle strategies and host specificity, we believe that
trypanosomatids are a fertile ground for further explorations to better
understand viral evolution, routes of transitions, and molecular mechanisms of
adaptation to different hosts.
