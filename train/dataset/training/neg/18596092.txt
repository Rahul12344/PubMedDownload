S acylation of cysteines located in the transmembrane and/or cytoplasmic region
of influenza virus hemagglutinins (HA) contributes to the membrane fusion and
assembly of virions. Our results from using mass spectrometry (MS) show that
influenza B virus HA possessing two cytoplasmic cysteines contains palmitate,
whereas HA-esterase-fusion glycoprotein of influenza C virus having one
transmembrane cysteine is stearoylated. HAs of influenza A virus having one
transmembrane and two cytoplasmic cysteines contain both palmitate and stearate. 
MS analysis of recombinant viruses with deletions of individual cysteines, as
well as tandem-MS sequencing, revealed the surprising result that stearate is
exclusively attached to the cysteine positioned in the transmembrane region of
HA.
