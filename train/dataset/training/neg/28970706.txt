BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study examined correlates of the brain's neurocognitive
performance among clinically and biochemically normal adult patient with
hepatitis C virus (HCV). We hypothesized that anti-HCV positive individuals would
demonstrate structural brain abnormalities and neurocognitive dysfunction as well
as the changes in cell component and extracellular space in the white matter
regions of brain in asymptomatic HCV infection by using diffusion tensor
tractrography (DTT) metrics.
METHODS: Anti-HCV positive patient (n = 40), and healthy controls (n = 31),
fulfilling inclusion criteria (incidentally detected anti-HCV positive) and able 
to provide informed consent were screened and recruited for the study. All these 
subjects and controls underwent subjective assessment of their quality of life
related symptoms, neuropsychometric tests (NPT) and magnetic resonance imaging.
RESULTS: The patients were subjected to neuroimaging as well as psychological
testing. There was no significant difference in basic laboratory parameters in
these two groups. Independent t-test reveals significantly lower
neuropsychological functioning as compared to healthy control. A significantly
decreased FA values and myoinsitol were observed in HCV subjects on sensory,
inferior longitudinal fascicules, and STR fiber bundles as compared to healthy
control. Bivariate correlation analysis reveals that neuropsychological scores
are significantly positive.
CONCLUSION: Our result show that HCV positive individuals would demonstrate
structural brain abnormalities and neurocognitive dysfunction as well as the
changes in cell component and extracellular space in the white matter regions of 
brain in asymptomatic HCV infection by using DTT metrics.
