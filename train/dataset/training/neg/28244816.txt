The development of a successful vaccine against HIV is a major global challenge. 
Antiretroviral therapy is the standard treatment against HIV-1 infection.
However, only 46% of the eligible people received the therapy in 2015.
Furthermore, suboptimal adherence poses additional obstacles. Therefore, there is
an urgent need for an HIV-1 vaccine. The most promising clinical trial to date is
Phase III RV144, which for the first time demonstrated the feasibility of
vaccine-mediated immune protection against HIV-1. Nevertheless, its 31% efficacy 
and limited durability underscore major hurdles. Here, we discuss recent progress
in HIV-1 vaccine development with a special emphasis on nanovaccines, which are
at the forefront of efforts to develop a successful HIV-1 vaccine.
