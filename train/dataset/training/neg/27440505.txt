Background: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), disproportionately affect adolescents and young
adults (AYAs) ages 13-24 years. Sexually transmitted infections likewise are a
risk factor for HIV acquisition and transmission; however, there is a lack of
data on STI acquisition in HIV-infected AYAs.
Methods: We determined the incidence of STIs in HIV-infected AYAs 12.5 <25 years 
of age in the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials
(IMPAACT) P1074 observational cohort study. Univariate and multivariable logistic
regression models were used to evaluate the association of HIV control (mean
viral load <500 copies/mL and CD4+ T cells >500 cells/mm3 in the year preceding
STI diagnosis) and other risk factors with STI occurrence.
Results: Of 1201 enrolled subjects, 1042 participants met age criteria and were
included (49% male, 61% black, 88% perinatally infected; mean age 18.3 years).
One hundred twenty participants had at least 1 STI on study, of whom 93 had their
first lifetime STI (incidence rate = 2.8/100 person-years). For individual STI
categories, 155 incident category-specific events were reported; human
papillomavirus (HPV) and chlamydial infections were the most common. In the
multivariable model, having an STI was associated with older age (adjusted odds
ratio [aOR] = 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.22), female sex (aOR =
2.65; 95% CI, 1.67-4.21), nonperinatal HIV acquisition (aOR = 2.33; 95% CI,
1.29-4.22), and uncontrolled HIV infection (aOR = 2.05; 95% CI, 1.29-3.25).
Conclusions: Sexually transmitted infection acquisition in HIV-infected AYAs is
associated with older age, female sex, nonperinatal HIV acquisition, and poorly
controlled HIV infection. Substantial rates of STIs among HIV-infected AYAs
support enhanced preventive interventions, including safe-sex practices and HPV
vaccination, and antiretroviral adherence strategies.
