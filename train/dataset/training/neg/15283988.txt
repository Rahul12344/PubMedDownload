Smallpox was eradicated by the World Health Organization (WHO) vaccination
campaign in the 1970s and the variola virus was restricted to repositories in the
United States and Russia. Recently, however, concerns have arisen about the
possible existence of variola outside these sites and the potential for using the
virus as a weapon of bioterror. The world population now has little residual
immunity to smallpox and supplies of the smallpox vaccine are being
reconstituted. Large numbers of individuals with various skin diseases or
immunosuppression owing to AIDS or organ transplantation medications, or who are 
pregnant or have heart disease might not be ideal candidates for vaccination with
the current live vaccines. It would be useful to have an orally active drug that 
could be self-administered in case of an outbreak of smallpox.
