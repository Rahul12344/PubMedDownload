We investigated the role of blood dendritic cells (DC) in transmission of HIV-1
from infected to uninfected CD4+ T cells, and the accessory molecules involved.
DC promoted transmission from infected to uninfected CD4+ cells, but blood DC
themselves were not infectable. DC-mediated transmission was blocked by mAb to
CD4 and MHC class II, but strongly increased by mAb to CD40 on DC or CD28 on T
cells. The DC-dependent infection was inhibitable by anti-CD80 and a soluble
fusion protein of the CD80 ligand, CTLA4; soluble CTLA4Ig also blocked infection 
augmented by crosslinking CD40. We also demonstrated that mAb to CD40 up-regulate
the expression of CTLA4 ligands CD80 and B70/B7-2 (CD86) on DC. These data
suggest that the dialog between CD40-CD40 ligand (CD40L) and CD28-CD80
counter-receptors on DC and T cells may be linked to HIV infection in vivo.
