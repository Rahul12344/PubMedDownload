Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the leading cause of chronic liver disease
and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Approximately 350 million individuals are
infected with HBV and >500,000 deaths per year can be attributed to HBV. Although
universal vaccination has reduced HBV incidence in many countries, it still
remains a major public health problem, especially in parts of Asia and Africa.
Improved understanding of HBV virology and virus-host interactions has
revolutionized chronic hepatitis B therapy in the past two decades. Development
of oral nucleoside/nucleotide analogues heralds a new era of safe and effective
treatment of this disease. On the basis of these advances, new guidelines for the
treatment of chronic hepatitis B have been issued. Successful long-term treatment
of chronic hepatitis B may rest on combination therapy that is based on molecular
approaches targeting various stages of the HBV life-cycle. In this review, we
summarize the current modalities and highlight important issues in the treatment 
of chronic hepatitis B monoinfection.
