BACKGROUND AND AIM: The mechanisms of ribavirin as an immune modulator have not
been fully revealed, contrary to its clinical benefit in chronic hepatitis C.
Recently, host immune defense, especially cytotoxic T lymphocytes and T helper
cells, have been considered to be closely related to the pathophysiology of
chronic viral hepatitis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the
function of ribavirin in cellular immunity.
METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and total RNA were prepared from
chronic hepatitis C patients. To evaluate the polarization of T helper cells, we 
performed intracellular cytokine assay and quantified the production of key
cytokines. mRNA levels of interleukin-12 receptor (IL-12R), interferon
(IFN)-gamma and interleukin-4 (IL-4) were measured by real time reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
RESULTS: The population of T helper 1 cells increased significantly both in
mitogen and hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein stimulated cells with 0.1
microg/mL of ribavirin. However, the population of T helper 2 cells did not seem 
to be affected by ribavirin. The level of IL-12R beta2 chain mRNA was also
upregulated to 130% after 24 h incubation with 0.1 microg/mL ribavirin (P =
0.037), whereas the beta1 chain did not change significantly under these
conditions. In addition, 0.1 microg/mL ribavirin could upregulate the levels of
IFN-gamma or IL-4 mRNA in some cases.
CONCLUSION: Ribavirin, perhaps by acting directly on CD4+ T cells, induces T cell
differentiation towards type 1, depending on the upregulated signal of the
IL-12/IL-12R pathway.
