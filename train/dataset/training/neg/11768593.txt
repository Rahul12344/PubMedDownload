A range of hazards may be encountered in in vitro toxicology laboratory work.
Such hazards are primarily chemical reagents for which the level of risk,
particularly with long-term exposure, may be difficult to ascertain. Cells and
tissues may also present biosafety concerns and it is important that risk
assessments are prepared for each procedure before commencing project work.
Ideally control measures should be simple and combine the use of appropriate
equipment with documented procedures supported by risk assessments. In any
laboratory staff and procedures change significantly over time, thus monitoring
of procedures (including waste disposal) and a comprehensive training programme
for all staff are essential components to assure both the quality and safety of
laboratory work.
