Human cells transformed in vitro by human cytomegalovirus: tumorigenicity in
athymic nude mice.

Geder L, Kreider J, Rapp F.

Athymic nude mice were inoculated with human embryo lung cells transformed in
vitro by human cytomegalovirus (CMV). Of the inoculated animals, 62% developed
tumors after an average latent period of 19 days. The tumors were composed of
small, polygonal cells with large nulei and scanty cytoplasm embedded in an
abundant collagenous matrix. The cells were poorly differentiated but may have
been of epithelial origin. Adjacent structures were rarely invaded. CMV-related
intracellular and membrane antigens were detected by indirect and anticomplement 
immunofluorescence techniques in cells cultured in vitro from the tumors.
