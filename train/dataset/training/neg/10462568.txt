The demand for tissue for human-to-human transplantation consistently exceeds the
available supply, resulting in attempts to use organs or tissues from animals; a 
field known as xenotransplantation. A major concern in xenotransplantation is the
risk of infection of human recipients with new xenogeneic infectious agents and
subsequent transmission of these infections to the general population. Of
particular importance are infections with retroviruses that persist in the host
and may allow silent human-to-human transmission. Pigs and baboons are considered
as sources for human xenotransplants and are known to be infected with a number
of retroviruses. Adequate diagnosis of pig and baboon retrovirus infections is
required for pretransplant screening of animal sources to minimize risks of
transmission to recipients and also for monitoring post-transplant infections in 
the human recipients. Strategies for serologic, molecular, and virologic
diagnosis are described. Examples of virus-specific methods for detection of
known retroviruses are also shown. Emphasis is made on the need for baboon and
pig cell-specific polymerase chain reaction assays that are necessary for
interpretation of polymerase chain reaction results of endogenous retroviruses.
Generic methods for detection of novel or variant retrovirus are described and
include screening by Amp-RT, an ultrasensitive reverse transcriptase assay.
