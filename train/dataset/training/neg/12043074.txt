An effective highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can prevent the
manifestation of HIV-1-associated encephalopathy. Also, HIV-1-associated minor
cognitive/motor deficits--an early form of HIV-1-associated dementia--are
improved. Clinically manifest HIV-1-associated encephalopathy is an indication
for HAART treatment, irrespective of immune status. To date, minor cognitive
and/or motor deficits in the presence of good immune status have not been
identified as an indication for HAART treatment. Any CNS-effective treatment
should be based on either zidovudine or stavudine, since these substances readily
enter the CSF; however, NNRTI can also be applied. Side effects of HAART on the
central and peripheral nervous system, as well as interactions with known
neurological medicaments must be taken into account.
