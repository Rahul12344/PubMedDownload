In bacteriophage T4 the protein product of gene 43 (gp43) is a multifunctional
DNA polymerase that is essential for replication of the phage genome. The protein
harbors DNA-binding, deoxyribonucleotide-binding, DNA-synthesizing (polymerase)
and 3'-exonucleolytic (editing) activities as well as a capacity to interact with
several other T4-induced replication enzymes. In addition, the T4 gp43 is a
repressor of its own synthesis in vivo. We show here that this protein is an
autogenous repressor of translation, and we have localized its RNA-binding
sequence (translational operator) to the translation initiation domain of gene 43
mRNA. This mechanism for regulation of T4 DNA polymerase expression underscores
the ubiquity of translational repression in the control of T4 DNA replication.
Many T4 DNA polymerase accessory proteins and nucleotide biosynthesis enzymes are
regulated by the phage-induced translational repressor regA, while the T4
single-stranded DNA-binding protein (T4 gp32) is, like gp43, autogenously
regulated at the translational level.
