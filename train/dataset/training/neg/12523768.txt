Three human enteric viruses (poliovirus, echovirus, coxsackievirus) suspended in 
seawater or buffer were stable for 6 hr in the absence of sunlight but were
inactivated at the same rate in the presence of sunlight. Under summer sunlight
conditions, at least 3 logs of these viruses were inactivated by one-hit kinetics
while under winter sunlight conditions only 1 log of these viruses was
inactivated by two-hit kinetics. Under these same conditions, 6 logs of E. coli
were inactivated within 1 hr by one-hit kinetics under summer and winter
conditions. In comparison, E. faecalis was inactivated by two-hit kinetics and
only 2.5 logs of inactivation were observed after 4 hr of exposure to winter
sunlight. Since human enteric viruses are considerably more resistant to sunlight
inactivation than E. coli and moderately more resistant than E. faecalis, marine 
recreational water quality standards should be based on concentrations of
enterococci and not on coliform bacteria. Since the mechanism and rate of
inactivation of coliphage and human enteric viruses are similar, coliphages
appear to be the best indicator for the presence of human enteric viruses in
recreational waters, especially coastal waters where abundant sunshine is
available.
