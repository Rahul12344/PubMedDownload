A major problem associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
(NNRTIs) for the treatment of HIV is their vulnerability to mutations in the
allosteric binding site of reverse transcriptase that can result in the
development of a resistant virus. Herein we present the optimization of a series 
of 5-aryloxy imidazoles, which possess a balanced pharmacological profile against
both wild-type enzyme and the clinically relevant mutations K103N and Y181C.
Subtle structural changes were used to probe structure-activity relationships
relating to both potency and metabolic stability, which led to an imidazole
derivative with an impressive overall profile.
