Taiwan was a hyperendemic area for hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection before the
late 1980s. The seroprevalence of HAV infection was higher than 90% with most HAV
infection occurring during childhood. This study was to estimate the
seroprevalence of HAV infection among preschool children in central Taiwan. A
community-based survey was carried out in 54 kindergartens in 10 urban areas, 10 
rural areas and 2 aboriginal areas randomly selected through stratified sampling.
Serum samples of 2,549 healthy preschool children and 104 teachers in study
kindergartens were screened for the HAV antibodies (anti-HAV) by means of a
commercially available microparticle enzyme immunoassay (AxSYM HAVAB). Among
aboriginal kindergarten children, more than 96% of them were anti-HAV
seropositive due to a mass HAV vaccination program. In urban and rural areas,
kindergarten children had a very low prevalence of anti-HAV (0.4%) in contrast to
a high seroprevalence in their teachers (78%). There was no gender difference in 
seroprevalence of anti-HAV, while the anti-HAV seroprevalence was significantly
higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Crowdedness of living in urban areas
might facilitate the person-to-person transmission of infectious agents.
