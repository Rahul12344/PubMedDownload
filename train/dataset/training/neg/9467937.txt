The RB and p16(INK4A) tumor suppressor genes function in the same pathway of cell
cycle control. Previous evidence indicates that the p16(INK4A) gene is
transcriptionally repressed by the RB gene product, pRB. In this study using
human ovarian cancer cell lines, we found that RB protein and mRNA were expressed
at higher levels in cell lines lacking p16 than in those with normal p16. Since
this suggests a potential role of p16 in regulating the cellular level of pRB, we
studied the effect of wild-type p16(INK4A) on expression of the RB gene.
Introduction of p16(INK4A), carried by an adenovirus vector, into p16-negative
cell lines dramatically decreased expression of RB protein and mRNA. Nuclei
run-off assays demonstrated that p16 expression induced transcriptional
downregulation of the RB gene. These results indicate that expression of RB is
inversely regulated by p16. The findings reveal a new dimension of pRB-p16
interaction and should have implications for p16(INK4A)-mediated gene therapy.
