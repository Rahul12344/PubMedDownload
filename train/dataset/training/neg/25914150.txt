Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection occurs throughout the body 
and can have dramatic physical effects, such as neurocognitive impairment in the 
central nervous system (CNS). Furthermore, examining the virus that resides in
the CNS is challenging due to its location and can only be done using samples
collected either at autopsy, indirectly form the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), or 
through the use of animal models. The unique milieu of the CNS fosters viral
compartmentalization as well as evolution of viral sequences, allowing for new
cell types, such as macrophages and microglia, to be infected. Treatment must
also cross the blood-brain barrier adding additional obstacles in eliminating
viral populations in the CNS. These long-lived infected cell types and treatment 
barriers may affect functional cure strategies in people on highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
