Dengue virus (DENV) is the most important mosquito-borne viral infection in
humans. In recent years, the number of cases and outbreaks has dramatically
increased worldwide. While vaccines are being developed, none are currently
available that provide balanced protection against all DENV serotypes. Advances
in human antibody isolation have uncovered DENV neutralizing antibodies (nAbs)
that are capable of preventing infection from multiple serotypes. Yet delivering 
monoclonal antibodies using conventional methods is impractical due to high
costs. Engineering novel methods of delivering monoclonal antibodies could tip
the scale in the fight against DENV. Here we demonstrate that simple
intramuscular delivery by electroporation of synthetic DNA plasmids engineered to
express modified human nAbs against multiple DENV serotypes confers protection
against DENV disease and prevents antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease
in mice. This synthetic nucleic acid antibody prophylaxis/immunotherapy approach 
may have important applications in the fight against infectious disease.
