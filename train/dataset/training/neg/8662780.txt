The construction, expression, and purification of an active Fv fragment of the
0.5beta monoclonal human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) neutralizing
antibody is reported. The interaction between the Fv fragment and the RP135
peptide derived from the V3 loop of gp120 from HIV-1IIIB was studied by varying
the salt concentration and by mutating arginine residues in the peptide. The
mutations R4A, R8A and R11A (which correspond to residues 311, 315, and 318 in
gp120 of HIV-1IIIB) reduce the binding free energy by 0.22 (+/- 0. 20), 4.32 (+/-
0.16), and 1.58 (+/- 0.17) kcal mol-1, respectively. The salt-dependent
components of their contributions to binding are 0.02 (+/- 0.22), -0.55 (+/-
0.18), and -0.97 (+/- 0.19) kcal mol-1, respectively. The magnitudes of the
mutational effects and the extent of shielding by 1 M NaCl suggest that Arg-8 is 
involved in a buried salt bridge in the peptide-Fv fragment complex, whereas
Arg-11 is involved in a more solvent-exposed electrostatic interaction.
