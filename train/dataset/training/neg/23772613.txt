The global spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is dependent on the
ability of this virus to efficiently cross from one host to the next by
traversing a mucosal membrane. Unraveling how mucosal exposure of HIV results in 
systemic infection is critical for the development of effective therapeutic
strategies. This review focuses on understanding the immune events associated
with the oral route of transmission (via breastfeeding or sexual oral
intercourse), which occurs across the oral and/or gastrointestinal mucosa.
Studies in both humans and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) monkey models have
identified viral changes and immune events associated with oral HIV/SIV exposure.
This review covers our current knowledge of HIV oral transmission in both infants
and adults, the use of SIV models in understanding early immune events, oral
immune factors that modulate HIV/SIV susceptibility (including mucosal
inflammation), and interventions that may impact oral HIV transmission rates.
Understanding the factors that influence oral HIV transmission will provide the
foundation for developing immune therapeutic and vaccine strategies that can
protect both infants and adults from oral HIV transmission.
