The laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) is a brain structure involved in distinct
behaviors including arousal, reward, and innate fear. How environmental stimuli
and top-down control from high-order sensory and limbic cortical areas converge
and coordinate in this region to modulate diverse behavioral outputs remains
unclear. Using a modified rabies virus, we applied monosynaptic retrograde
tracing to the whole brain to examine the LDT cell type specific upstream nuclei.
The LDT received very strong midbrain and hindbrain afferents and moderate
cortical and hypothalamic innervation but weak connections to the thalamus. The
main projection neurons from cortical areas were restricted to the limbic lobe,
including the ventral orbital cortex (VO), prelimbic, and cingulate cortices.
Although different cell populations received qualitatively similar inputs,
primarily via afferents from the periaqueductal gray area, superior colliculus,
and the LDT itself, parvalbumin-positive (PV+) GABAergic cells received
preferential projections from local LDT neurons. With regard to the different
subtypes of GABAergic cells, a considerable number of nuclei, including those of 
the ventral tegmental area, central amygdaloid nucleus, and VO, made
significantly greater inputs to somatostatin-positive cells than to PV+ cells.
Diverse inputs to the LDT on a system-wide level were revealed.
