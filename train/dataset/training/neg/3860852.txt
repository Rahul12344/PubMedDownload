Duck hepatitis B virus DNA in liver and serum of Chinese ducks: integration of
viral DNA in a hepatocellular carcinoma.

The presence of duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) DNA in liver and serum and its
state (integrated vs. free) were studied in 23 ducks from Chi-tung county in
China by spot hybridization and Southern blot hybridization, respectively. In 16 
of 23 (70%), DHBV DNA was detected in serum and/or in liver tissue. These
infected ducks showed a variety of pathological changes including advanced
chronic disease in the liver. In contrast, none of the virus-negative ducks had
advanced hepatic changes. One DHBV DNA-seropositive duck had a large
hepatocellular carcinoma. Southern blot analysis demonstrated integrated DHBV DNA
in neoplastic tissue and abundant episomal DHBV DNA in non-neoplastic tissue of
the liver. In one noninfected duck with a small adenoma, no viral DNA was
detected in tumor or non-neoplastic tissue. The detection of integrated DHBV DNA 
in hepatocellular carcinoma suggests that DHBV behaves like human and woodchuck
hepatitis viruses in relation to chronic liver disease and hepatocarcinogenesis.
