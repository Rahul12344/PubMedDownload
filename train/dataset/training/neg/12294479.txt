PIP: 871 of Singapore's 3.1 million people have been diagnosed with HIV since
1985. 90% of these people are male and more than 70% of them report that they
were infected through unprotected heterosexual sex. In the context of a growing
number of people with AIDS, the government of Singapore plans to begin promoting 
condom use rather than rely simply upon campaigns stressing the need to remain
sexually faithful to one partner. The government plans to increase awareness of
HIV/AIDS at the grassroots, and gradually include condom use in public campaigns 
which now focus upon avoiding casual sex. At Singapore's first national AIDS
conference, participants shared studies which showed that although a majority of 
Singaporeans know that HIV/AIDS is largely transmitted through sex or the sharing
of injection equipment in IV drug use, up to 40% worry that they can become
infected in other ways, such as from a diseased person sneezing or coughing upon 
them.
