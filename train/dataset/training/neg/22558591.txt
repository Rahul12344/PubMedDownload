BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding is an established mode of transmission of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection resulting in clash between socio-cultural 
values and medical practice.
AIMS: This study aims to determine the effect of post-natal maternal
antiretroviral therapy on transmission of HIV through breastfeeding.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 318 pregnant women were followed from pregnancy 
to 6 months post- partum. The women were divided into breast-fed and those who
did not breast-feed, while the breast-fed were further divided into those on
antiretroviral (ARV) and those not on ARV. After 6 months post-partum, dried
blood spots were collected from infants born to these women and tested for HIV
using polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Generally, breast-feeding had 4 to 13 fold increase risk of transmission
of HIV to infants (OR =7.079 95% CI = 3.768, 13.300; P <0.0001). However, among
breast-fed infants, post-natal maternal ARV resulted in reduced prevalence of HIV
compared to mothers who did not use ARV during breast-feeding (17.31% VS 92.00%; 
P<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of post-natal maternal ARV. 
However, research into better feeding options to prevent mother to child
transmission of HIV via breast-feeding is advocated.
