In an effort to develop a more effective DNA immunization strategy for HIV, we
synthesized an HIV-2 env DNA vaccine and delivered it in a novel polycationic
adjuvant formulation that forms nanoparticles in solution and enhances protein
expression. The polycationic adjuvant contained imidazole moieties to facilitate 
endosomal escape. Nanoparticles containing the DNA vaccine plasmid were formed by
electrostatic condensation with the polycationic adjuvant. We hypothesized that
this formulation would improve immune responses to the gp140 env gene from
HIV-2(UC2) by increasing the level of expressed antigen. We found that the
nanoparticles were superior at inducing high levels of systemic antibody
responses compared to naked DNA when delivered by the intradermal route in BALB/c
mice. In addition, the nanoparticles induced higher levels of IgM, IgG, and IgA
antibodies. These results suggest that nanoparticles may be an important adjuvant
formulation to improve the effectiveness of genetic immunization and rationalize 
its use in the evaluation of vaccine candidates in non-human primate models for
AIDS.
