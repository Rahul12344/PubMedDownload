Hepatitis virus infections can be accompanied by extrahepatic manifestations that
may be caused by the host's immune reaction to the viral infection. Vascular
involvement is one of these manifestations and is occasionally associated with
life-threatening conditions due to systemic organ failure. The unique profile of 
hepatitis-related vascular involvement is associated with infection by different 
types of hepatitis viruses. For example, polyarteritis nodosa is more frequently 
reported in patients with chronic hepatitis B than those with chronic hepatitis
C. Similarly, membranous nephropathy is a notable manifestation among hepatitis B
virus-positive patients. In contrast, patients infected with hepatitis C virus
are at risk for cryoglobulinemia and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.
Antiviral therapy is necessary to control these kinds of vasculitis related to
hepatitis virus infections; however, immunosuppressive agents may be required to 
treat severe cases. New antiviral drugs for viral hepatitis could improve the
prognosis of vascular and renal involvement.
