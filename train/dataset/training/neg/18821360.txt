BACKGROUND: Retroviral vectors are regularly used to transduce stem cells and
their derivatives for experimental and therapeutic purposes. Because these
vectors integrate semi-randomly into the cellular genome, analysis of
integranated retroviral DNA/host cell DNA junctions (IHJ) facilitates clonality
studies of engrafted cells, allowing their differentiation, survival and fate to 
be tracked. In the case of any adverse events, IHJ analysis can allow the
identification of potentially oncogenic integration sites. At present, most
measures to assess IHJ are complex, insensitive and may be subject to IHJ
selection bias inherent to the technology used.
METHODS: We have developed and validated a simple but effective technique for
generating libraries of IHJ, which we term flanking-sequence exponential
anchored-polymerase chain reaction (FLEA-PCR). Flanking-sequence random anchoring
is used as an alternative to restriction enzyme digestion and cassette ligation
to allow consistent detection of IHJ and decrease bias.
RESULTS: Individual clones from plasmid libraries can be sequenced and assembled 
using custom-written software, and FLEA-PCR smears can be analyzed by capillary
electrophoresis after digestion with restriction enzymes.
DISCUSSION: This approach can readily analyze complex mixtures of IHJ, allowing
localization of these sequences to their genomic sites. This approach should
simplify analysis of retroviral integration.
