BACKGROUND: In recent years, a number of serious disease outbreaks caused by
viruses and viroids on greenhouse tomatoes in North America have resulted in
significant economic losses to growers. The objectives of this study were to
evaluate the effectiveness of commercial disinfectants against mechanical
transmission of these pathogens, and to select disinfectants with broad spectrum 
reactivity to control general virus and viroid diseases in greenhouse tomato
production.
METHODS: A total of 16 disinfectants were evaluated against Pepino mosaic virus
(PepMV), Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), and
Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). The efficacy of each disinfectant to deactivate the
pathogen's infectivity was evaluated in replicate experiments from at least three
independent experiments. Any infectivity that remained in the treated solutions
was assessed through bioassays on susceptible tomato plants through mechanical
inoculation using inocula that had been exposed with the individual disinfectant 
for three short time periods (0-10 sec, 30 sec and 60 sec). A positive infection 
on the inoculated plant was determined through symptom observation and confirmed 
with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PepMV, ToMV, and TMV) and real-time
reverse transcription-PCR (PSTVd). Experimental data were analyzed using Logistic
regression and the Bayesian methodology.
RESULTS: Statistical analyses using logistic regression and the Bayesian
methodology indicated that two disinfectants (2% Virkon S and 10% Clorox regular 
bleach) were the most effective to prevent transmission of PepMV, PSTVd, ToMV,
and TMV from mechanical inoculation. Lysol all-purpose cleaner (50%) and nonfat
dry milk (20%) were also effective against ToMV and TMV, but with only partial
effects for PepMV and PSTVd.
CONCLUSION: With the broad spectrum efficacy against three common viruses and a
viroid, several disinfectants, including 2% Virkon S, 10% Clorox regular bleach
and 20% nonfat dry milk, are recommend to greenhouse facilities for consideration
to prevent general virus and viroid infection on tomato plants.
