A rapid immunoperoxidase technique to distinguish herpetic types.

Ganderup G, Newburger AE, Barr RJ, Riley RJ.

The United States is experiencing an epidemic of herpetic infections. Rapid
specific diagnosis of herpes simplex types and herpes zoster is important
epidemiologically and also for individual cases since treatment as well as
prognosis for recurrence or dissemination varies with virus type. We report a
rapid test for the diagnosis and differentiation of these infections. This test
uses scrapings from viral vesicles. It employs standard immunoperoxidase
techniques and takes 2 hours to perform at 37C. Smears from 13 patients with
clinical and/or culture confirmation of viral type were tested. Eleven of eleven 
who had fresh smears (vesicles present less than 5 days) had positive staining
for the viral type expected clinically. Two patients with vesicles 5 days or
older showed nonspecific staining.
