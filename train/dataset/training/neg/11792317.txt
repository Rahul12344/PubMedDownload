The Age of Genomics dawned only gradually for bacteriophages. It was 1977 when
the genome of phage phi X174 was published and 1983 when the "large" genome of
phage lambda hit the streets. More recently, the pace has quickened, so that we
now have over 100 complete phage genomes and can expect thousands in a very few
years. These sequences have been marvelously informative for the biology of the
individual phages, but with the advent of high volume sequencing technology, the 
real excitement for phage biology is that it is now possible to analyze the
sequences together and thereby address--for the first time at whole genome
resolution--a set of fundamental biological questions related to populations:
What is the structure of the global phage population? What are its dynamics? How 
do phages evolve? This is Comparative Genomics with a capital "C".
