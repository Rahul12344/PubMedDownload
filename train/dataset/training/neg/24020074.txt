In the twenty-first century, the clinical microbiology laboratory plays a central
part in optimizing the management of infectious diseases and surveying local and 
global epidemiology. This pivotal role is made possible by the adoption of
rational sampling, point-of-care tests, extended automation and new technologies,
including mass spectrometry for colony identification, real-time genomics for
isolate characterization, and versatile and permissive culture systems. When
balanced with cost, these developments can improve the workflow and output of
clinical microbiology laboratories and, by identifying and characterizing
microbial pathogens, provide significant input to scientific discovery.
