Viruses of genus Carlavirus encode a small cysteine-rich protein (CRP) of unknown
function. To investigate the role of CRP of carlavirus chrysanthemum virus B
(CVB), a recombinant potato virus X (PVX) genome was constructed, which carried
the CVB CRP gene. Expression of CVB CRP in the PVX genetic background drastically
changed the PVX symptom phenotype in N. benthamiana. Instead of symptomless
infection and mild mosaic, which are characteristic of PVX in this plant host,
the recombinant virus expressing CVB CRP induced formation of necrotic local
lesions on inoculated leaves and necrosis of the apical leaves. In N. tabacum,
the infection pattern depended on the host genotype: the recombinant PVX was able
to spread systemically only in N gene-carrying plants. In
agroinfiltration-mediated transient expression assay, CVB CRP did not exhibit the
properties of avirulence factor in N. benthamiana and was unable to suppress
post-transcriptional gene silencing. Thus, CVB CRP is the viral pathogenicity
determinant controlling the virus interaction with plant hosts in a manner which 
depends on plant defense mediated by resistance genes such as the N gene.
