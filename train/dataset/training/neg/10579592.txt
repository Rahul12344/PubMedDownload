The ability to manipulate the expression of genes within neurons provides unique 
opportunities to study the role of individual gene products in nervous system
function. Virus vectors are a potentially rapid tool for the experimental
manipulation of gene expression in the mammalian nervous system. However, a block
to the use of virus vector systems in neurobiology is often the lack of
cell-specific expression of the gene within the nervous system, and the immune
and inflammatory responses to both the virus vector and the delivered gene. We
have generated an adeno-associated virus vector that exploits the restricted
expression pattern of the rat preprotachykinin-A promoter to support reporter
gene expression. We demonstrate that this virus has a neuronal-specific
expression pattern. Moreover, it is shown for the first time that the proximal
rat preprotachykinin-A promoter is nerve growth factor inducible. This virus will
be a useful tool to (i) modify neuronal phenotype by expressing therapeutic
molecules or antisense nucleic acid and (ii) dissect the signal transduction
pathways that regulate promoter function in vivo.
