Many coronaviruses are capable of interspecies transmission. Some of them have
caused worldwide panic as emerging human pathogens in recent years, e.g., severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In order to assess their threat to humans, we
explored to infer the potential hosts of coronaviruses using a dual-model
approach based on nineteen parameters computed from spike genes of coronaviruses.
Both the support vector machine (SVM) model and the Mahalanobis distance (MD)
discriminant model achieved high accuracies in leave-one-out cross-validation of 
training data consisting of 730 representative coronaviruses (99.86% and 98.08%
respectively). Predictions on 47 additional coronaviruses precisely conformed to 
conclusions or speculations by other researchers. Our approach is implemented as 
a web server that can be accessed at http://bioinfo.ihb.ac.cn/seq2hosts.
