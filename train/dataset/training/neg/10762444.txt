The ability of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and JEV-induced macrophage
derived neutrophil chemotactic factor (MDF) to produce nitric oxide (NO), and the
possible antiviral effect of NO during JEV infection, was investigated. Splenic
macrophages of JEV infected mice produced maximum NO in vivo at day 7 post
infection, and in vitro at 24 h after JEV stimulation. MDF-induced NO production 
was dose dependent and maximal at 60 min after MDF treatment. The response was
sensitive to anti-MDF antibody treatment and the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor 
NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA). Pretreatment of mice with L-NMMA increased the
mortality to 100% in JEV infected mice in vivo and inhibited NO production in
vitro, while MDF stimulated macrophages inhibited virus replication with high
levels of NO production. MDF treatment increased the survival rate of JEV
infected mice. The findings thus demonstrate that MDF induces production of NO
during JEV infection, which has an antiviral effect. This may be one of the
important mechanisms of natural immunity in controlling the initial stages of JEV
infection.
