Monkeypox virus (MPV) is a virulent human pathogen that has gained increased
attention because of its potential use as a bioterrorism agent and inadvertent
introduction into North America in 2003. The US outbreak also provided an
important opportunity to study MPV-specific T cell immunity. Although
MPV-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells could recognize vaccinia virus
(VV)-infected monocytes and produce inflammatory cytokines such as IFNgamma and
TNFalpha, they were largely incapable of responding to autologous MPV-infected
cells. Further analysis revealed that, unlike cowpox virus (CPV), MPV did not
interfere with MHC expression or intracellular transport of MHC molecules.
Instead, MPV-infected cells were capable of preventing T cell receptor
(TcR)-mediated T cell activation in trans. The ability to trigger a state of
nonresponsiveness represents a unique MHC-independent mechanism for blocking
antiviral T cell activation and inflammatory cytokine production and is likely an
important attribute involved with viral dissemination in the infected host.
