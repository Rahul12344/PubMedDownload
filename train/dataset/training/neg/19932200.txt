Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the
central nervous system characterized by relapses and remissions. The risk of
acquiring this complex disease is associated with exposure to environmental
factors in genetically susceptible individuals. The epidemiology of MS has been
extensively studied. We review the geographic epidemiology of the disease, the
influence of immigration, age at immigration, clustering and epidemics. Various
presumptive risk factors are discussed such as ultraviolet radiation, vitamin D, 
Epstein-Barr virus and infectious mononucleosis, other infectious agents and
non-infectious factors. Two different hypotheses, the hygiene hypothesis and the 
prevalence hypothesis, were proposed to explain these environmental risk factors 
for MS. The epidemiological data, combined with pathological and immunological
data, may contribute to the debate whether MS is an autoimmune disease, a latent 
or persistent viral disease, or a neurodegenerative disease.
