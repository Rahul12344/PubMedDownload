Hamster cells transformed with avian sarcoma virus, which had been selected for
resistance to 8-azaguanine, were cloned. Several single cell clones were isolated
which differed significantly in their tumorigenicity in comparison to the
parental highly tumorigenic cells. The nontumorigenic cell clones contained
rescuable avian virus. Both parental and resistant cells possessed transformed
phenotype. Comparative studies with parental highly tumorigenic cells and
nontumorigenic cell clones failed to detect any difference in the expression of
p60src, in this phosphorylation and in phosphokinase activity. The isolated
nontumorigenic cells represent cell mutants in which the viral src gene is
controlled by a suppressor gene. The cells might be useful for further
characterization of a putative antioncogene.
