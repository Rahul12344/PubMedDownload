T cell mediated cytotoxic immune reactivity of bone marrow reconstituted chimeric
mice.

Wagner H, RÃ¶llinghoff M, Rodt H, Thierfelder S.

The capacity of bone marrow reconstituted chimeric mice to mount sendai virus
specific H-2 restricted as well as alloreactive cytotoxic T-cell responses has
been investigated. Chimeras of the type a leads to (a x b)F1 and (a x b)F1 leads 
to a were used. In addition chimeras produced with (a x b)F1 mice grafted under
the kidney capsula with a type parental thymus, thymectomised, lethally
irradiated and reconstituted with either a, (a x b)F1 or b type bone marrow cells
were tested. In agreement with the data of Zinkernagel and Bevan it was noted
that virus specific T cells of semi-allogeneic chimeric mice are able to
recognise virus antigens in the context of the MHC of the thymus in which they
have maturated. The unexpected finding was that fully allogeneic chimeras were
able to mount both alloreactive CTL and H-2 restricted, virus specific CTL. The
H-2 restricted CTL detected were preferentially restricted to their own MHC type.
In some animals also virus specific CTL restricted to the allogeneic thymus MHC
type were observed. Data are also presented to indicate that longterm cultured
bone marrow cells have the potential to repopulate lethally irradiated mice.
