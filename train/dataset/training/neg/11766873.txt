Two hundred and fifty ambulatory patients with febrile respiratory tract
infections were included in a prospective study, aimed at determining the
reliability of physicians judgements relating to the aetiology of the infection. 
Compared with advanced serological testing, physicians' judgements for a
bacterial/atypical, rather than viral, aetiology had a negative predictive value 
of 60% and a positive predictive value of only 50%. We conclude that physicians' 
ability to assess whether the infectious aetiology of RTI is viral or
bacterial/atypical is low and no more reliable than tossing a coin.
