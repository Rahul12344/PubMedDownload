The I5L gene is one of approximately 90 genes that are conserved throughout the
chordopoxvirus family, and hence are presumed to play vital roles in the poxvirus
life cycle. Previous work had indicated that the VP13 protein, a component of the
virion membrane, was encoded by the I5L gene, but no additional studies had been 
reported. Using a recombinant virus that encodes an I5 protein fused to a V5
epitope tag at the endogenous locus (vI5V5), we show here that the I5 protein is 
expressed as a post-replicative gene and that the approximately 9 kDa protein
does not appear to be phosphorylated in vivo. I5 does not appear to traffic to
any cellular organelle, but ultrastructural and biochemical analyses indicate
that I5 is associated with the membranous components of assembling and mature
virions. Intact virions can be labeled with anti-V5 antibody as assessed by
immunoelectron microscopy, indicating that the C' terminus of the protein is
exposed on the virion surface. Using a recombinant virus which encodes only a
TET-regulated copy of the I5V5 gene (vDeltaindI5V5), or one in which the I5 locus
has been deleted (vDeltaI5), we also show that I5 is dispensable for replication 
in tissue culture. Neither plaque size nor the viral yield produced in BSC40
cells or primary human fibroblasts are affected by the absence of I5 expression.
