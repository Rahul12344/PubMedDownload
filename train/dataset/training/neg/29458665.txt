Central nervous system (CNS) infection of C57BL/6 mice with the TE strain of
Sindbis virus (SINV) provides a valuable animal model for studying the
pathogenesis of alphavirus encephalomyelitis. While SINV TE inoculated
intracranially causes little mortality, 20-30 % of mice inoculated intranasally
(IN) died 8 to 11 days after infection, the period during which immune cells
typically infiltrate the brain and clear infectious virus. To examine the
mechanism behind the mortality, mice infected IN with SINV TE were monitored for 
evidence of neurological disease, and those with signs of severe disease
(moribund) were sacrificed and tissues collected. Mice showing the usual mild
signs of encephalomyelitis were concurrently sacrificed to serve as time-matched 
controls (sick). Sixty-eight per cent of the moribund mice, but none of the sick 
mice, showed upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to gastric ulceration. Clinical 
disease and gastrointestinal pathology could not be attributed to direct viral
infection of tissues outside of the CNS, and brain pathology and inflammation
were comparable in sick and moribund mice. However, more SINV antigen was present
in the brains of moribund mice, and clearance of infectious virus from the CNS
was delayed compared to sick mice. Lower levels of SINV-specific IgM and fewer
B220+ B cells were present in the brains of moribund mice compared to sick mice, 
despite similar levels of antiviral IgM and IgG in serum. These findings
highlight the importance of the local antibody response in determining the
outcome of viral encephalomyelitis and offer a model system for understanding
individual variation in this response.
