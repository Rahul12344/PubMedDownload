The crystal structure of the N9 subtype neuraminidase of influenza virus was
refined by simulated annealing and conventional techniques to an R-factor of
0.172 for data in the resolution range 6.0 to 2.2 A. The r.m.s. deviation from
ideal values of bond lengths is 0.014 A. The structure is similar to that of N2
subtype neuraminidase both in secondary structure elements and in their
connections. The three-dimensional structures of several escape mutants of
neuraminidase, selected with antineuraminidase monoclonal antibodies, are also
reported. In every case, structural changes associated with the point mutation
are confined to the mutation site or to residues that are spatially immediately
adjacent to it. The failure of antisera to cross-react between N2 and N9 subtypes
may be correlated with the absence of conserved, contiguous surface structures of
area 700 A2 or more.
