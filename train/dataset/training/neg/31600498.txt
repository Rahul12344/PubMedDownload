Bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, are the most abundant biological
entities within the holobiont. In this issue of Cell Host & Microbe, Jahn et al. 
(2019) describe a group of phages that can suppress immune cell function in
marine sponges using secreted ankyrin proteins. They call these phages
Ankyphages.
