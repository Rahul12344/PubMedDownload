"Natural" Igs, mainly IgM, comprise part of the innate immune system present in
healthy individuals, including antigen-free mice. These Igs are thought to delay 
pathogenicity of infecting agents until antigen-induced high affinity Igs of all 
isotypes are produced. Previous studies suggested that the acquired humoral
response arises directly from the innate response, i.e., that B cells expressing 
natural IgM, upon antigen encounter, differentiate to give rise both to cells
that secrete high amounts of IgM and to cells that undergo affinity maturation
and isotype switching. However, by using a murine model of influenza virus
infection, we demonstrate here that the B cells that produce natural antiviral
IgM neither increase their IgM production nor undergo isotype switching to IgG2a 
in response to the infection. These cells are distinct from the B cells that
produce the antiviral response after encounter with the pathogen. Our data
therefore demonstrate that the innate and the acquired humoral immunities to
influenza virus are separate effector arms of the immune system and that antigen 
exposure per se is not sufficient to increase natural antibody production.
