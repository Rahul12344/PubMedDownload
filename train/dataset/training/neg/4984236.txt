Ribosomal RNA homologies among distantly related organisms.

Bendich AJ, McCarthy BJ.

The similarity in base sequences of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in widely divergent
organisms was compared. Hybrids were prepared between Escherichia coli and pea
rRNA on the one hand and the DNA of several organisms on the other. The varying
thermal stabilities of these hybrids were taken as evidence for a hierarchy of
rRNA relatedness among some higher plants, and for phylogenetic relationships
among some species of bacteria, protozoa, fungi, plants, and animals. The large
rRNA molecule appears to have evolved faster than the small rRNA molecule.
