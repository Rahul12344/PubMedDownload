Vaccination is mankind's greatest public health success story. By now vaccines to
many of the viruses that once caused fatal childhood diseases are routinely used 
throughout the world. Traditional methods of vaccine development through
inactivation or attenuation of viruses have failed for some of the most deadly
human pathogens, necessitating new approaches. Genetic modification of viruses
not only allows for their attenuation but also for incorporation of sequences
from other viruses, turning one pathogen into a vaccine carrier for another.
Recombinant viruses have pros and cons as vaccine carriers, as discussed below
using vectors based on adenovirus, herpesvirus, flavivirus, and rhabdovirus as
examples.
