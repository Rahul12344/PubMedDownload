Thirty broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) were performed in order to investigate 30
infectious episodes in immunocompromised children. Twenty patients were
previously treated by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow
transplantation and 6 other patients by conventional methods. A specific
etiologic diagnosis was obtained in 16 of 30 episodes (56%), 22 microorganisms
were identified by BAL. The most frequently involved microorganism was Candida
albicans and the other agents were as follows: 3 cytomegalovirus, 2 Pneumococcus,
2 Pneumocystis carinii, 1 Aspergillosis, 1 syncytial respiratory virus, 1
myxovirus, 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 1 Haemophilus
influenzae and 1 Escherichia coli. In 5 cases, more than 2 agents were involved. 
This study emphasizes the diagnostic interest of BAL for infectious diseases of
the immunocompromised child. BAL appears to be a non invasive, rapid and
reproducible method, and a useful therapeutic approach in the treatment of
infectious episodes occurring in grafted children where several microorganisms
could be involved at the same time.
