SETTING: Zimbabwe.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the determinants of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis
(MDR-TB) among previously treated TB patients.
DESIGN: A 1:3 case-control study with bivariate analysis and logistic regression.
RESULTS: Risk factors for MDR-TB were history of nursing an MDR-TB patient
(adjusted OR [aOR] 4.46, 95%CI 2.02-9.88), history of hospitalisation for î‹¶3 days
(aOR 2.91, 95%CI 1.62-5.23) and history of foreign travel and stay outside
Zimbabwe (aOR 2.68, 95%CI 1.46-4.91). Protective factors were previous successful
treatment (aOR 0.05, 95%CI 0.02-0.11), history of supervision by a health
worker/village health worker (aOR 0.34, 95%CI 0.19-0.60) and having been treated 
not more than once previously for TB (aOR 0.18, 95%CI 0.08-0.38). No association 
between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and MDR-TB (aOR 1.00, 95%CI 
0.53-1.88) was observed. However, among HIV-infected patients, those with CD4
<200 cells/mm3 were more likely to develop MDR-TB (aOR 4.62, 95%CI 2.49-8.53).
CONCLUSION: Individual, service-related, social and demographic factors interact 
to determine multidrug resistance among previously treated TB patients. Infection
control, treatment adherence, reduction of side effects and drug susceptibility
testing must be strengthened to reduce the MDR-TB burden in Zimbabwe.
