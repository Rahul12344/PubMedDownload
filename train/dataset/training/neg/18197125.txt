INTRODUCTION: Previous studies suggest that indicators of central adiposity such 
as waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and waist circumference may be altered by HIV
infection, antiretroviral treatment, or both.
METHODS: Waist and hip circumference and body mass index (BMI) were measured
among participants of the Women's Interagency HIV Study semiannually from 1999 to
2004. Generalized linear models evaluated longitudinal patterns of these measures
and associations with demographic and clinical characteristics.
RESULTS: WHR was significantly larger, whereas BMI and waist and hip
circumference were significantly smaller at almost all 11 semiannual visits among
942 HIV-infected women compared with 266 HIV-uninfected women. Among
HIV-uninfected women, mean waist and hip circumference and BMI increased over the
5-year study period (waist: +4.1 cm or 4.4%, hip: +3.76 cm or 3.5%, and BMI +2.43
kg/m2 or 8.2%), whereas WHR remained stable. Among the HIV-infected women, waist 
and hip circumference, BMI, and WHR did not significantly change. Independent
predictors of smaller BMI among HIV-infected women included white race, hepatitis
C virus seropositivity, current smoking, higher viral load, and lower CD4 cell
count. Independent predictors of larger WHR among HIV-infected women included
age, white and other non-African American race, higher CD4 cell count, and
protease inhibitor (PI) use. Use of a highly active antiretroviral therapy
(HAART) regimen was not an independent predictor of BMI or WHR.
CONCLUSIONS: HIV-infected women had higher WHRs compared with HIV-uninfected
women, despite lower BMIs and waist and hip measurements. BMI and waist and hip
circumference increased over 5 years among the HIV-uninfected women but remained 
stable in the HIV-infected women. Among HIV-infected women, PI use was associated
with a larger WHR, although HAART use itself was not appreciably associated with 
BMI or WHR.
