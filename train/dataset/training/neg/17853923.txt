High levels of decoy receptor 2 (DcR2; TRAIL-R4) expression are correlated with
TRAIL resistance in prostate cancer cells. In addition, upregulation of TRAIL
death receptor (DR4 and DR5) expression, either by ionizing radiation or
chemotherapy, can sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL. Considering more than half of 
human cancers are TRAIL resistant, modulation of surface TRAIL receptor
expression appears to be an attractive treatment modality to counteract TRAIL
resistance. In this study, three siRNA duplexes targeting DcR2 receptor were
tested. Ad5hTRAIL infections were performed to overexpress human full-length
TRAIL to induce cell death, and the in vitro tumorigenic potential of prostate
cancer cells was assessed using colony-forming assays on soft agar. The DU145 and
LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines, which express high levels of DcR2, were
resistant to Ad5hTRAIL-induced death. Downregulation of surface DcR2 expression
by siRNA sensitized these prostate cancer cell lines to Ad5hTRAIL. In addition,
DcR2 siRNA-mediated knockdown of DcR2, followed by Ad5hTRAIL infection,
dramatically reduced the in vitro tumorigenic potential of prostate cancer cells.
Collectively, our results suggest the potential for combining receptor-specific
siRNA with TRAIL in the treatment of certain cancers.
