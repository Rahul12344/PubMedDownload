BACKGROUND: It is not known whether chronic hepatitis B (CH-B) or chronic
hepatitis C (CH-C) carries a greater risk of liver-related mortality. This study 
compared rates of liver-related mortality between these 2 groups in the
Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS).
METHODS: Six hundred eighty men with CH-B (n = 337) or CH-C (n = 343) at study
entry into the MACS were prospectively followed to death, last follow-up visit,
or 30 March 2010, whichever came first. Four hundred seventy-two (69.4%) of these
men were infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Causes of
death were obtained from death registry matching and death certificates.
Liver-related and all-cause mortality rates (MRs) were compared between groups
using Poisson regression and adjusted for potential confounders and competing
risks.
RESULTS: In 6728 person-years (PYs) of follow-up, there were 293 deaths from all 
causes (43.5 per 1000 PYs), of which 51 were liver-related (7.6 per 1000 PYs).
The all-cause MR was similar between those with CH-B and CH-C; however, the
liver-related MR was significantly higher in those with CH-B (9.6 per 1000 PYs;
95% confidence interval [CI], 6.9-13.2) than those with CH-C (5.0 per 1000 PYs;
95% CI, 3.0-8.4). In the HIV-infected subgroup, which had 46 (90.2%) of the
liver-related deaths, the liver-related MR remained higher from CH-B after
adjusting for potential confounders (incidence rate ratio, 2.2; P = .03) and
competing risks (subhazard rate ratio, 2.4; P = .02). Furthermore, among
HIV-infected subjects, CD4 cell counts <200 cells/mm(3) were associated with a
16.2-fold (95% CI, 6.1-42.8) increased risk of liver-related death compared with 
CD4 cell counts >350 cell/mm(3).
CONCLUSIONS: Chronic hepatitis B carries a higher risk of death from liver
disease than does CH-C, especially in HIV-infected men with greater
immunosuppression.
