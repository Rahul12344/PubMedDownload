BACKGROUND: Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) may represent a novel mechanism to 
deliver a functional gene to a deficient liver. Bone marrow-derived hepatocytes
are rare and without a defined contribution to liver function. Consequently, the 
clinical significance of BMT to treat liver disease is unclear. We sought to
quantify bone marrow-derived hepatocyte protein expression after BMT and
determine whether the process is inducible with liver injury.
METHODS: Mice transgenic for human alpha-1 antitrypsin (hAAT) under a
hepatocyte-specific promoter were used as bone marrow donors. Adenoviral
transduction of modified urokinase plasminogen activator (Ad-muPA) was used to
induce liver injury. Eight weeks after lethal irradiation and BMT, recipients
were stratified into two groups: BMT alone (n = 5) and BMT + Ad-muPA (n= 10).
Both groups of animals were bled before (t = 0) and at 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks
after Ad-muPA administration, and the serum samples were assessed for hAAT by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: Transgenic donor mice expressed 5 to 10 mg/mL of hAAT. Recipients of BMT
alone expressed less than 80 ng/mL of hAAT over all time periods. Animals
receiving BMT + Ad-muPA showed sustained and stable hAAT expression of
approximately 200 ng/mL. Differences were statistically significant at each time 
point.
CONCLUSION: Serum protein levels from liver-specific transgene expression are
detectable and persist after BMT. Expression is low, but inducible with liver
injury. We are currently developing strategies to augment donor-derived,
liver-specific protein expression after BMT.
