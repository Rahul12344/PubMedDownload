Detection of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and bovine viral diarrhea viruses 
in the nasal epithelial cells by the direct immunofluorescence technique.

Silim A, Elazhary MA.

Nasal epithelial cells were collected by cotton swabs for the diagnosis in
experimental and field cases of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and field cases
of bovine viral diarrhea in calves. A portion of the cells was washed twice in
phosphate buffered saline and a 25 microL drop was placed on microscope slides.
The cells were dried, fixed and stained according to the direct fluorescent
antibody technique. Another portion of the same specimen was inoculated onto
primary bovine skin cell cultures for virus isolation. In the experimental
studies for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, 29/35 specimens were positive by
fluorescent antibody technique and 32/35 by cell culture and in the field cases, 
22/119 were positive by fluorescent antibody technique and 19/119 by cell
culture. In the field cases of bovine viral diarrhea, 28/69 samples were positive
by fluorescent antibody technique and 14/69 by cell culture. When fluorescent
antibody technique was performed on inoculated cell cultures a total of 24/69
specimens were positive for bovine viral diarrhea. The sensitivity of fluorescent
antibody technique was thus comparable to that of cell culture method for
infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and bovine viral diarrhea.
