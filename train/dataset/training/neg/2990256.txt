Proteolytic release of glycopeptides from glycoproteins transferred to
nitrocellulose following gel electrophoresis.

Dion AS, Pomenti AA.

To determine whether glycopeptides could be released from glycoproteins bound to 
nitrocellulose, the glycoproteins of murine mammary tumor virus (MuMTV) were
radiolabeled by the periodate oxidation/tritiated sodium borohydride reduction
technique and separated by gel electrophoresis followed by diffusion transfer.
Pronase digestion of nitrocellulose filter strips containing labeled
glycoproteins (gp55 or gp34) revealed a rapid release of glycopeptides, i.e.,
approximately total release within 4 h. The released glycopeptides were similar
in size, as determined by molecular sieving chromatography, to glycopeptides
obtained by proteolytic digestion of MuMTV glycoproteins from dried gel strips
(A. Zilberstein et al., 1980, Cell 21, 417-427) or in solution (M. J. Yagi et
al., 1978, Virology 91, 291-304).
