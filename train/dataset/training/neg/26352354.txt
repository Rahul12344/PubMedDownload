Capillary electrophoresis based on nucleic acid detection for diagnosing human
infectious disease.

Lian DS, Zhao SJ.

Rapid transmission, high morbidity, and mortality are the features of human
infectious diseases caused by microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and
viruses. These diseases may lead within a short period of time to great personal 
and property losses, especially in regions where sanitation is poor. Thus, rapid 
diagnoses are vital for the prevention and therapeutic intervention of human
infectious diseases. Several conventional methods are often used to diagnose
infectious diseases, e.g. methods based on cultures or morphology, or biochemical
tests based on metabonomics. Although traditional methods are considered gold
standards and are used most frequently, they are laborious, time consuming, and
tedious and cannot meet the demand for rapid diagnoses. Disease diagnosis using
capillary electrophoresis methods has the advantages of high efficiency, high
throughput, and high speed, and coupled with the different nucleic acid detection
strategies overcomes the drawbacks of traditional identification methods,
precluding many types of false positive and negative results. Therefore, this
review focuses on the application of capillary electrophoresis based on nucleic
detection to the diagnosis of human infectious diseases, and offers an
introduction to the limitations, advantages, and future developments of this
approach.
