Genital herpes, caused by both herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, can
result in painful vesicular and ulcerative lesions on the genitalia and the
genital tract, and may cause both urologic and neurologic problems. Following
primary infection, HSV establishes a latent infection in the local ganglia and
can reactivate on multiple occasions with manifestations ranging from
asymptomatic viral shedding to painful recurrences of genital or orofacial
lesions (Whitley, 2001). HSV-2 is the predominant etiologic agent of genital
herpes and data from the second and third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys, spanning 1976 to 1994, demonstrated that the prevalence of
HSV-2 infection increased by 30% since the late 1970â€™s with the highest rates in 
teenagers and young adults (Fleming et al., 1997). It is estimated that more than
1.6 million individuals are infected annually with HSV-2 in the USA (Armstrong et
al., 2001). From the perspective of vaccine development, however, genital herpes 
caused by HSV-1 cannot be overlooked. Although genital herpes caused by HSV-1 is 
generally less severe than HSV-2, HSV-1 is ubiquitous, infects a larger portion
of the population than HSV-2, and the percentage of HSV-1 positive cultures
isolated from individuals presenting with genital herpes appears to be increasing
(Ribes et al., 2001).
