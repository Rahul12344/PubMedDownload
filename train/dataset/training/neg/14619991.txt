This paper shows an application of control theory to human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)/AIDS models. Minimum singular value decomposition is applied to HIV/AIDS
models to measure the extent to which the different stages in the progression of 
HIV/AIDS disease are controllable and, consequently, when best to initiate
therapy such that the general objectives of therapy are satisfied. Simulations
will be used to demonstrate the effect of treatment at various stages.
Comparisons will be made between mono-class and combination therapies and between
when therapy is initiated at the acute infection, asymptomatic and the advanced
stages.
