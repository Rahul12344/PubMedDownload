The Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe acute
pneumonia and renal failure. The MERS-CoV papain-like protease (PL(pro)) is a
potential target for the development of antiviral drugs. To facilitate these
efforts, we determined the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme by X-ray
crystallography. The molecule consists of a ubiquitin-like domain and a catalytic
core domain. The catalytic domain displays an extended right-hand fold with a
zinc ribbon and embraces a solvent-exposed substrate-binding region. The overall 
structure of the MERS-CoV PL(pro) is similar to that of the corresponding
SARS-CoV enzyme, but the architecture of the oxyanion hole and of the S3 as well 
as the S5 specificity sites differ from the latter. These differences are the
likely reason for reduced in vitro peptide hydrolysis and deubiquitinating
activities of the MERS-CoV PL(pro), compared to the homologous enzyme from the
SARS coronavirus. Introduction of a side-chain capable of oxyanion stabilization 
through the Leu106Trp mutation greatly enhances the in vitro catalytic activity
of the MERS-CoV PL(pro). The unique features observed in the crystal structure of
the MERS-CoV PL(pro) should allow the design of antivirals that would not
interfere with host ubiquitin-specific proteases.
