The transcription factor PU.1 is a hematopoietic-specific member of the ets
family. Mice carrying a mutation in the PU.1 locus were generated by gene
targeting. Homozygous mutant embryos died at a late gestational stage. Mutant
embryos produced normal numbers of megakaryocytes and erythroid progenitors, but 
some showed an impairment of erythroblast maturation. An invariant consequence of
the mutation was a multilineage defect in the generation of progenitors for B and
T lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes. Thus, the developmental programs of
lymphoid and myeloid lineages require a common genetic function likely acting at 
the level of a multipotential progenitor.
