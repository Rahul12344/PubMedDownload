The presence of retroviral particles in hybridoma cell lines.

Machala O, Mach O, Buben√≠k J, Hasek M.

The presence of very high numbers of type C and type A retroviral particles was
repeatedly confirmed not only in myeloma cells NSI, Ag 8 and in thymoma cells
BW5147, EL 4 but also in B and T cell hybridomas constructed from the myeloma and
thymoma cells used. Retroviral particles were demonstrated by current
electron-microscopic and physicochemical methods. Biological tests for the
induction of possible malignant or any pathological changes in the artificially
infected sensitive cells during long-term cultivations in vitro or in vivo gave
negative results. Nevertheless, on account of the hitherto unknown action of
retroviruses one can suppose that monoclonal products from B and T cell
hybridomas, particularly when used for practical purposes, should be purified
because of their infectious nature.
