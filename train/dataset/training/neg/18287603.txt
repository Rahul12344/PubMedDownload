Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is considered an agent responsible for acute hepatitis
that does not progress to chronic hepatitis. We identified 14 cases of acute HEV 
infection in three patients receiving liver transplants, nine receiving kidney
transplants, and two receiving kidney and pancreas transplants. All patients were
positive for serum HEV RNA. Chronic hepatitis developed in eight patients, as
confirmed by persistently elevated aminotransferase levels, serum HEV RNA, and
histologic features of chronic hepatitis. The time from transplantation to
diagnosis was significantly shorter and the total counts of lymphocytes and of
CD2, CD3, and CD4 T cells were significantly lower in patients in whom chronic
disease developed.
