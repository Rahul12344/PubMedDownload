The pJL6 expression vector and its derivatives, pJLA16 and pANH-1, have been used
for the synthesis and high-level expression in Escherichia coli of restriction
enzyme fragments derived from the envelope and 3'-orf genes of the BH10 and BH8
clones, respectively, of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). These
bacterially expressed proteins have been purified to apparent homogeneity by
sequential detergent extraction, gel filtration, and reverse-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography. The recombinant proteins have been used
for the production of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, and the fusion
proteins from the envelope gene are currently being evaluated for use as
immunodiagnostic assay reagants.
