Twenty-six patients, positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis 
B e antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis B virus (HBV)-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and DNA
polymerase activity, were treated with human lymphoblastoid interferon
(IFN-alpha) or human fibroblast interferon (IFN-beta) after enoxolone glycoside
(glycyrrhizinic acid), given for four weeks and then withdrawn. The interferons
were given continuously for four weeks. Four months after the treatment, six of
12 patients treated with IFN-alpha were both HBeAg-negative and HBV-DNA-negative 
while three of 14 patients treated with IFN-beta were HBV-DNA-negative and one
was HBeAg-negative. None of the ten untreated control patients became negative
for either HBeAg or HBV-DNA. All patients studied remained HBsAg-positive. Both
interferons were generally well tolerated. A persistent low-grade fever was
reported by more patients in the IFN-beta group and hair and weight loss were
more common in the IFN-alpha group. The results indicate that the combination of 
enoxolone glycoside withdrawal and IFN-alpha treatment reduces HBV replication
more effectively than does interferon alone.
