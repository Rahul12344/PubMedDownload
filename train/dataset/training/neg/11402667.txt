This paper summarizes the history of and information on bovine herpesvirus type 4
(BoHV-4) from the first isolation to the most recent results. For almost twenty
years BoHV-4 has been considered a typical herpes 'orphan' virus, which infects
several species but causes no illness. The latest experiments revealed the close 
relationship of this virus with the immune system and other tissues. The virus
was even considered as a possible candidate for a vector vaccine. BoHV-4 as a
strange herpesvirus has several features which are not characteristic of other
herpesviruses, such as several latency sites, persistence in serum, dividing
cells necessary for virus replication, and the wide host range. In addition to
describing the main features of the virion, replication, clinical signs,
nomenclature problems, this review intends to concentrate on the new and strange 
results coming out from several laboratories worldwide. It is also suggested that
because the virus combines several properties of various herpesvirus subfamilies 
and because of its close relationship with the immune system, it may deserve
further attention as a representative of a potentially new genus within the
Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily.
