Lateral gene transfer (LGT) has been demonstrated as a transfer process of novel 
genes between different species. LGT proceedings are occurring between microbes
and plants, as well as between microbes and animals. New evidence demonstrates
that bacterial insertional mutagenesis may occur in cancer cells. Due to the
important role of genetic changes in the increase of cell proliferation and
cancer development, we reviewed the effects of microbial-animal LGT in human
oncogenesis. In addition, viral DNA can induce cancer development by random
insertion into cancer-related genes or by inducing translocations. In conclusion,
growing evidence shows the contribution of the microbial genome in cancer and
autoimmune disease.
