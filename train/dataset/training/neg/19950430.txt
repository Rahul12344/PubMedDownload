OBJECTIVE: To compare the response to a nevirapine (NVP)-based highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-infected Ugandan children, exposed and
nonexposed to single-dose NVP (sd NVP) at birth.
METHODS: HIV-infected study children were initiated on stavudine/lamivudine/NVP
as a fixed dose combination. CD4 cell percent and HIV-1 RNA were documented at
baseline, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks post-initiation of HAART.
RESULTS: Ninety-two children were enrolled in the study, 44 in the sd NVP-exposed
and 48 in the nonexposed cohort. The median age at enrollment was 1.7 years
[interquartile range (IQR) 1.2-2.4] and 7.8 years (IQR 5.9-9.2) in the sd
NVP-exposed and nonexposed cohorts,respectively (P < 0.001). At baseline and week
48 post-HAART, the median CD4 cell percentages were 14% and 33% for the
NVP-exposed group and 8% and 22.5% in the nonexposed group (P < 0.0001). The
median (IQR) viral load at baseline was 650,568 (359,979-2,086,613) RNA copies/mL
and 239,027 (105,904-494,813) RNA copies/mL in the NVP-exposed and nonexposed
cohorts, respectively. After 48 weeks of HAART, 76% of the NVP-exposed and 80% of
the nonexposed children had a median viral load of < 400 copies/mL (P = 0.74).
CONCLUSIONS: Both HIV-infected Ugandan older infants and children that were
exposed and not exposed to sd NVP at birth had favorable treatment outcomes on
NVP-containing HAART.
