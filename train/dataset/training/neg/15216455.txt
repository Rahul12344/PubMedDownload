We have developed an in vitro reconstructed vaginal mucosa integrating Langerhans
cells (LCs), obtained by differentiation of umbilical cord blood CD34(+)
hematopoietic progenitor cells, and, in this model, we have investigated the
infection of LCs by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Proviral DNA of 
X4 (LAI and NL4-3) and R5 (Ba-L) HIV-1 strains were detected in LCs integrated in
the reconstituted mucosa. Infection of LCs could be specifically inhibited by the
chemokines stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and RANTES (regulated on
activation, normally T cell-expressed and -secreted), confirming the presence of 
functional coreceptors on LCs generated in vitro. A complete inhibition of LCs,
by use of azidothymidine, a reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, was also observed.
Moreover, HIV-1-infected LCs of the reconstructed mucosa were able to transmit R5
or X4 HIV-1 strains to activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Such a model
could be a useful tool to study the mechanisms involved in transmission of HIV in
the female genital tract.
