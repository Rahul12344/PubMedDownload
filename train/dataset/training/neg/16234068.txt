As we improve our understanding of the molecular virology of hepatitis C virus
(HCV), a variety of new potential antiviral strategies are emerging. Moving
beyond interferon and ribavirin, these new strategies for the first time are
aimed at HCV-specific targets. It is expected, by analogy with other infections, 
that effective pharmacologic control of HCV will be achieved best by using a
cocktail of such virus-specific agents, each designed against an independent
target. As a result, the way we treat HCV should change dramatically over the
next few years.
