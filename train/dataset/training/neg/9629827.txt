OBJECTIVES: To estimate the direct health care costs of a continuing epidemic of 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among injecting drug users (IDUs) in Australia 
from the formal health care system's perspective.
DESIGN: A Markov cohort model is used to map the disease paths of successive
hypothetical cohorts of 1,000 patients as they develop the sequelae of HCV over
an extended period of time.
PATIENTS AND SETTING: IDUs becoming infected with HCV.
OUTCOME MEASURES: Estimates of the number of persons in each of a limited number 
of disease states are used in conjunction with direct medical costs associated
with ambulatory visits and inpatient hospital admissions over the course of the
disease to estimate the long-term impact on the health care system of HCV
infection among successive cohorts of IDUs.
RESULTS: For every 1,000 IDUs newly infected with hepatitis C in a given year,
there is an implied $14.32 million in health care spending over the years as
sequelae become manifest, with cumulative total costs of some $0.5 billion (1994 
dollars) after 60 years as the costs of successive cohorts of HCV-infected IDUs
are added to the prevalence pool. If the estimated 10,000 new HCV infections in
IDUs in Australia per year continue for the next 60 years, total direct health
care costs will be around $4 billion over that period.
CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to prevent HIV transmission among IDUs have been shown to be
clearly cost-effective. These data imply that there is an even more pressing need
to halt or slow the current epidemic of HCV infection among IDUs on fiscal
grounds alone.
