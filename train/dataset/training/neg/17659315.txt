Mass spectrometry analysis of the Ebola virus soluble glycoprotein sGP identified
a rare post-translation modification, C-mannosylation, which was found on
tryptophan (W) 288. This modification has not been described for any other viral 
protein; however, many viral transmembrane glycoproteins contain one or more of
the recognition motifs (W-x-x-W). Elimination of the C-mannose on sGP did not
significantly alter protein biosynthesis, processing or structure. Furthermore,
the protective effect of sGP on endothelial barrier function, currently the only 
known activity of sGP, was unaltered. It is possible that C-mannosylation may be 
a common post-translational modification of viral transmembrane glycoproteins
where it could play a role in particle maturation and/or entry by stabilizing the
structure of these proteins. In this regard, C-mannosylation of sGP may be an
anomaly resulting from the unique manner in which this protein is generated as
the product of unedited transcripts from the glycoprotein gene of Ebola.
