BACKGROUND: Acute parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection is characterized by high-level 
viremia. Antibodies against the capsid proteins VP1 and VP2 may complex with
B19V-particles thereby becoming undetectable in diagnostic tests.
OBJECTIVES: We intended to obtain data on the frequency of false-negative
serology in acute B19V-infection.
STUDY DESIGN: 129 plasma or serum samples of healthy blood donors and of patients
with suspected B19V-infection were analyzed for B19V-DNA by qPCR and
VP1/VP2-specific IgG and IgM by ELISA. Eleven of these samples were derived from 
four pregnant women with previous contact to B19V-infected individuals. Using
acidic conditions virus/antibody-complexes were disrupted and detected by
WesternLine and ELISA.
RESULTS: 83/118 samples were derived from acutely infected individuals displaying
viremia (10(3)-10(12)geq/mL). In 24/83 viremic samples (28.9%) VP1/VP2-specific
IgM and IgG were undetectable in ELISA, but could be demonstrated to be complexed
with B19V-particles. Each 7/83 (8.4%) was IgM-positive/IgG-negative and
IgM-negative/IgG-positive, in 45/83 samples (54.2%) IgG and IgM could be
detected. 35 samples did not contain B19V-DNA; five of these were from
seronegative persons. Analyzing consecutive sera derived from four pregnant
women, B19V-DNA was demonstrated in 10/11 samples, B19V-specific IgG- and
IgM-antibodies were detectable in 10/11 and 4/11 samples, respectively. In 2/4
women seroconversion was observed, but IgM was not detected in 50% of the
samples. B19V-specific IgG but not IgM was detectable in 2/4 women.
CONCLUSION: Acute B19V-infection cannot be diagnosed by exclusive analysis of
B19V-specific antibodies. Only the combination of assays for detection of
B19V-DNA and antibodies enables correct serodiagnosis.
