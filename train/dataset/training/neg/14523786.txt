Community Program for Clinical Research on AIDS 059 was a multicenter study
conducted among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals with CD4+
cell counts > or =300 cells/mm3 who were randomly assigned to receive
antiretroviral therapy with or without intermittent subcutaneously administered
recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2). To identify factors associated with a response
to IL-2, a secondary analysis was performed that included the subset of rIL-2
recipients who were able to complete all 3 initial treatment cycles. Predictors
of a change in CD4+ cell count between baseline and 1 month after the start of
treatment cycle 3 were examined in a multivariate model that included sex, race, 
body surface area, rIL-2 dose, HIV load, and both baseline and nadir CD4+ cell
count. The combination of race and sex (P=.027) and the nadir CD4+ cell count
(P=.005) were significant predictors of mean CD4+ cell count response. Baseline
CD4+ cell count had no significant effect. The strong association between nadir
CD4+ cell count and CD4+ cell count response suggests that immunologic losses
resulting from HIV-mediated CD4+ cell depletion may be irreversible.
