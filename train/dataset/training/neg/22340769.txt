Sex has been reported to influence the rates of viral clearance in hepatitis C
virus (HCV)-infected patients. However, little is known regarding the influence
of sex on the host genetic response to HCV, which is mediated by the expression
of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs) after the activation of janus kinase 
(JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway by IFN.
Thus, we investigated gender differences in MxA genetic profile, which is a
downstream reliable marker for JAK/STAT pathway activation. In all, 40 untreated 
HCV-infected patients were subclassified into premenopausal, postmenopausal, and 
male patients. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from premenopausal 
women showed the highest MxA gene expression compared to both postmenopausal
females and males before and after IFN stimulation. The prestimulation of PBMCs
with 17beta-estradiol prior to IFN treatment resulted in a decrease of MxA
expression in all groups of patients. That was confirmed by the reversal of this 
effect using estrogen antagonist ICI182/780. This study demonstrates for the
first time the presence of gender variations in the genetic response to chronic
HCV infection and to interferon treatment. It also clarifies that estrogen is not
the key player in enhancing the JAK/STAT pathway.
