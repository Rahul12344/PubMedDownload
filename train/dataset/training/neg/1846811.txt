Simian virus 40 large T antigen is a helicase separating the complementary
strands of double-stranded DNA in the presence of hydrolyzable ATP and of
double-stranded RNA in the presence of non-ATP nucleotides (GTP, CTP or UTP). We 
have constructed partially single-stranded nucleic acid substrates consisting of 
RNA or DNA strands hydrogen bonded to either RNA or DNA complements. We found
that ATP is utilized as a cofactor for the T-antigen-catalyzed unwinding reaction
when the substrates contain overhanging single-stranded DNA, regardless of
whether the double-stranded region is DNA or hybrid DNA.RNA. Conversely, non-ATP 
nucleotides are used when the overhanging single strand is RNA. Based on these
and additional findings, we propose that the bound nucleic acid induces a
conformational change in T antigen resulting in a proper orientation of both
nucleic acid and nucleotide relative to the active center of the ATPase/helicase 
domain of the enzyme. The implications of our conclusion for the roles which T
antigen may play in vivo are discussed.
