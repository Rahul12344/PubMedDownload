Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process that recycles damaged or
unwanted cellular components, and has been linked to plant immunity. However, how
autophagy contributes to plant immunity is unknown. Here we reported that the
plant autophagic machinery targets the virulence factor βC1 of Cotton leaf curl
Multan virus (CLCuMuV) for degradation through its interaction with the key
autophagy protein ATG8. A V32A mutation in βC1 abolished its interaction with
NbATG8f, and virus carrying βC1V32A showed increased symptoms and viral DNA
accumulation in plants. Furthermore, silencing of autophagy-related genes ATG5
and ATG7 reduced plant resistance to the DNA viruses CLCuMuV, Tomato yellow leaf 
curl virus, and Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus, whereas activating autophagy
by silencing GAPC genes enhanced plant resistance to viral infection. Thus,
autophagy represents a novel anti-pathogenic mechanism that plays an important
role in antiviral immunity in plants.
