The detection of HBsAg in blood serum using immune-enzyme analysis techniques
decisively matters both for diagnostics of acute and chronic hepatitis B and
screening of donor's blood and its components, controls of persons from risk
groups of hepatitis B injection. The making of panels containing wide specter of 
samples of blood serums with sero-variants and mutant forms of surface antigen of
hepatitis B virus widespread on the territory of the Russian Federation is
necessary to control analytic and diagnostic sensitivity of test systems for
detecting HBsAg. The testing of reagents kits to detect HBsAg using twi panels
containing recombinant and native variants of HBsAg, demonstrated that these kits
enable to detect various sero-vatriants of HBsAg (ayw2, adw2, ayw3varA, ayw3varB,
adrq-) in concentration 0.1-0.01 IU/l and the so called elusive mutant forms of
HBsAg of recombinant and native origin (G145R, Q129R, Q129H, Q129L, T143K, T126N,
T126S, D144A, M133L, K141E and P142S). At that, the sensitivity can differ during
the detection of native and recombinant mutant forms. The results testify the
importance of using the panels both with recombinant and native samples
containing the mutant forms of HBsAg in evaluation of sensitivity of reagents
kits.
