Relation between aflatoxin, hepatitis-B virus, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Lutwick LI.

A new role is postulated for aflatoxin in the production of hepatocellular
carcinoma. Rather than acting as a primary carcinogen, as it seems to do in
animals, it is suggested that aflatoxin suppresses cell-mediated immunity. This
effect on the immune system would allow the hepatitis-B virus, highly endemic in 
certain populations, to maintain itself more easily in the liver, to produce more
chronic infection and cirrhosis, and in the long term to lead to a high incidence
of hepatocellular carcinoma.
