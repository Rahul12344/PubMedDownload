The effect of pregnancy on the protective immune response of mice to tissue
culture-derived inactivated Japanese encephalitis (JE) Nakayama vaccine and to
live sublethal doses of JE virus, was studied. Thirty per cent protection was
found in mice, immunized with three doses of inactivated vaccine, before
pregnancy and challenged after delivery. In contrast, all the mice immunized with
two sublethal doses of JEV tolerated the challenge under similar condition.
