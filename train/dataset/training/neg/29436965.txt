A new clade, Trichoderma formosa, secretes eliciting plant response-like 1
(Epl1), a small peptide elicitor that stimulates plant immunity. Nicotiana
benthamiana pretreated with Epl1 for 3 days developed immunity against Tomato
mosaic virus (ToMV) infection. The transcriptome profiles of T. formosa and N.
benthamiana were obtained by deep sequencing; the transcript of Epl1 is 736 nt in
length and encodes a 12-kDa peptide. Identifying critical genes in Epl1-mediated 
immunity was challenging due to high similarity between the transcriptome
expression profiles of Epl1-treated and ToMV-infected N. benthamiana samples.
Therefore, an efficient bioinformatics data mining approach was used for
high-throughput transcriptomic assays in this study. We integrated gene-to-gene
network analysis into the ContigViews transcriptome database, and genes related
to jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling, salicylic acid signaling, leucine-rich
repeats, transcription factors, and histone variants were hubs in the
gene-to-gene networks. In this study, the Epl1 of T. formosa triggers plant
immunity against various pathogen infections. Moreover, we demonstrated that
high-throughput data mining and gene-to-gene network analysis can be used to
identify critical candidate genes for further studies on the mechanisms of plant 
immunity.
