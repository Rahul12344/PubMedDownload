Further investigations on possible correlation between agglutinability and
osteoinductive properties of established cell lines.

WÅ‚odarski K, Ostrowski K.

Various cell lines, including SV40 virus-transformed human and mouse fibroblasts,
established fibroblastic and epithelial cell lines, as well as their hybrids were
tested for osteoinductive properties versus presence of Concanavalin A receptors.
No correlation was found between the presence of these receptors and
osteoinductive properties of cells. So far, however, no osteoinductive cell line 
was found without Concanavalin A receptors. Thus, the significance of surface
properties of cells in transmission of osteoinductive signal(s) remains an open
question. None of the fibroblastic lines exhibits osteoinductive potential, in
contrast to the HT-40 and WISH epithelial lines.
