OBJECTIVE: Decreased T-cell reactivity in vitro is strongly associated with
progression to AIDS and low CD4+ T-cell numbers. Low T-cell responses in vitro
induced by CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) are predictive for progression to AIDS
independent of low CD4+ T-cell counts and high HIV-1 RNA levels. We developed a
whole-blood lymphocyte culture system in which T cells were stimulated by a
combination of CD3 and CD28 mAb. Combined stimulation of CD28, a costimulatory
molecule, and CD3 considerably enhances T-cell responses in vitro and reduces
variation coefficients, which may increase the prognostic power of T-cell
responses.
DESIGN: A prospective study of HIV-1-infected homosexual men followed for 35
months.
METHODS: The predictive value of low T-cell responses to CD3 plus CD28 mAb
relative to low CD4+ T-cell counts, high HIV-1 RNA levels and the presence of
syncytium-inducing (SI) HIV-1 variants was evaluated longitudinally in 202
HIV-1-infected homosexual men followed for 35 months.
RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, decreased T-cell responses at baseline were
predictive of development of AIDS, independent of low CD4+ T-cell numbers and
high HIV-1 RNA levels. In a time-dependent model, HIV-1 RNA levels lost their
predictive value, whereas low T-cell responses, low CD4+ T-cell numbers and the
presence of SI HIV-1 variants independently predicted AIDS.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that combined use of virological and
immunological markers may be useful in monitoring disease progression and
response to antiretroviral therapy.
