We have partially reconstituted 20S proteasome/RNA complexes using
oligonucleotides corresponding to ARE (adenosine- and uridine-rich element)
(AUUUA)4 and HIV-TAR (human immunodeficiency virus-Tat transactivation response
element), a stem-loop structure in the 5' UTR (untranslated region) of HIV-mRNAs.
We demonstrate that these RNAs which associate with proteasomes are degraded by
proteasomal endonuclease activity. The formation of these 20S proteasome/RNA
substrate complexes is rather specific since 20S proteasomes do not interfere
with truncated TAR that is not cleaved by proteasomal endonuclease. In addition, 
affinity of proteasomes for (AUUUA)4 is much stronger as it is for HIV-TAR. These
results provide further arguments for our hypothesis that proteasomes could be
involved in the destabilisation of cytokines mRNAs containing AUUUA sequences as 
well as viral mRNAs.
