HIV-1 Nef affects the trafficking of numerous cellular proteins to optimize viral
replication and evade host defenses. The adaptor protein (AP) complexes, which
form part of the cytoplasmic coat of endosomal vesicles, are key cellular
co-factors for Nef. Nef binds these complexes and alters their physiologic cycle 
of attachment and release from membranes. Specifically, while AP-1 normally
becomes cytosolic when attachment events are blocked by inhibition of the GTPase 
cycle of ADP-ribosylation factor-1 (ARF1), the complex remains
membrane-associated in Nef-expressing cells. To investigate the mechanism of this
effect, we used a permeabilized cell system to detect the de novo attachment of
exogenous AP-1 to endosomal membranes. Nef did not mediate de novo attachment
independently of ARF1, despite its ability to maintain the association of AP-1
with endosomal membranes when the activity of ARF1 was blocked. We conclude that 
Nef stabilizes AP complexes on endosomal membranes after ARF1-dependent
attachment. This stabilization may facilitate coat formation and stimulate the
trafficking of multiple cellular proteins.
