Despite the effectiveness of the selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulators in
preventing ER-positive breast cancer, chemopreventive agents still need to be
developed for the prevention of ER-negative breast cancers. The naturally
occurring retinoids are promising agents for the prevention of human cancers but 
are too toxic for long-term chronic use. We previously demonstrated that the
chemopreventive effects of the retinoids could be separated from the toxicity by 
using an RXR-selective retinoid, LGD1069. The studies described here demonstrate 
that LGD1069 effectively suppresses ER-negative tumor development in mouse
mammary tumor virus-erbB2 transgenic mice with minimal toxicity. These studies
suggest that receptor-selective retinoids are promising agents for the prevention
of breast cancer and that they may be particularly useful in preventing
ER-negative breast cancer.
