In this study, we successfully produced VLPs derived from full-length or chimeric
VP1 of a documented GII.6 strain. Trypsin digestion of purified VLPs led to total
cleavage of VP1, while the integrity of assembled VLPs was not affected. In vitro
VLP-histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) binding and binding blockade assays
indicated that trypsin digestion enhanced the binding of GII.6 VLPs to salivary
HBGAs and that this binding could only be blocked by serum produced against a
homologous strain. The data regarding the assembly, morphology and binding
patterns of GII.6 NoV VLPs presented here might be useful for further study of
GII.6 NoVs.
