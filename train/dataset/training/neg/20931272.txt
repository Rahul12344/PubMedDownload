We report successful tocilizumab (TCZ) use in a patient with adult-onset Still's 
disease (AOSD) complicated by chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and AA amyloidosis (AAA).
Treatments with corticosteroid and various types of immunosuppressants were
unsuccessful. Aggravation of CHB ensued, and entecavir was started. Normalisation
of liver function and hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA were confirmed. TCZ was then
started. His arthritis and AAA improved dramatically. TCZ is an excellent
treatment for refractory AOSD and is feasible in an HBV-infected patient.
