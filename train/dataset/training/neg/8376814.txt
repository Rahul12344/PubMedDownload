Purified F glycoprotein from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, subgroup A
antigenic type) was evaluated in 18- to 36-month-old children as a vaccine.
Children had been previously infected with RSV during natural outbreaks of the
virus. Single injections of 5, 20, or 50 micrograms of protein resulted in
greater than eightfold increases in ELISA and neutralizing antibodies. Second
doses of vaccine did not result in further boosts in antibody. Neutralizing
antibodies increased not only to the A2 and Long strains (subgroup A strains) but
also to strain 18537 (subgroup B). Four of 11 vaccinees became naturally infected
during the subsequent RSV outbreak, suggesting that the vaccine was not effective
in preventing recurrent RSV infections. Severe illnesses did not occur,
indicating that there was not an increase of severity of infection following
vaccine in seropositive children. Only 1 of 8 vaccinees tested had fourfold
increases in nasal wash IgA to RSV after immunization. Vaccine strategies to
stimulate secretory antibodies as well as circulating neutralizing antibodies to 
RSV need to be developed.
