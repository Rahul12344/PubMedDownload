Background: Determining timing of first virus detection episodes (fVDEs) for
different respiratory viruses in infants identifies risk periods and informs
preventive interventions, including vaccination. We describe the ages and nature 
of fVDEs in an infant birth cohort and explore factors associated with increased 
odds of symptomatic fVDEs.
Methods: The Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases (ORChID)
study is a community-based birth cohort describing acute respiratory infections
in infants until their second birthday. Parents recorded daily symptoms and
collected nose swabs weekly, which were batch-tested using polymerase chain
reaction assays for 17 respiratory viruses.
Results: One hundred fifty-eight infants participated in ORChID. The median age
for fVDEs was 2.9 months for human rhinovirus (HRV) but was ≥13.9 months for
other respiratory viruses. Overall, 52% of HRV fVDEs were symptomatic, compared
with 57%-83% of other fVDEs. Respiratory syncytial virus and human
metapneumovirus fVDEs were more severe than HRV fVDEs. Older age and the winter
season were associated with symptomatic episodes.
Conclusions: Infants do not always experience respiratory symptoms with their
fVDE. Predominance of early HRV detections highlights the need for timing any
intervention early in life. fVDEs from other respiratory viruses most commonly
occur when maternal vaccines may no longer provide protection.
