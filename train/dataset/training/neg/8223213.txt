To diagnose possible cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in a 64-year-old man after
renal transplantation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), pp65 antigenaemia assay
(pAA) and virus isolation in cell culture were routinely performed on a weekly
basis. The PCR obtained virus DNA in peripheral blood lymphocytes for the first
time in the fifth week. Two weeks later the patient complained of feeling unwell 
with abdominal pain and vomiting on eating. Two days later he developed a fever
up to 38 degrees C and nocturnal sweats. Gastroscopy revealed marked antral
gastritis which histologically showed typical cytomegalic "owl-eye" cells. The
pAA was clearly positive and the cell culture started in the fifth week now
showed a cytopathogenic effect. CMV gastritic having been diagnosed treatment
consisted of 175 mg ganciclovir intravenously twice daily for 10 days. He became 
symptom-free after two days. The only side effects were thrombocytopenia down to 
67,000/microliters and a rise in transaminase activities, changes which regressed
later. To ensure early diagnosis and treatment of any CMV infection, specific
virus diagnostic tests should be routinely undertaken after transplantation of
organs from CMV-positive persons into CMV-negative patients.
