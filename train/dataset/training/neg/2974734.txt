[The viroimmunotest for mass determinations of nanogram amounts of antigens].

[Article in Russian]

Skvortsov VT, Suslov AP.

Simple highly sensitive screening variant of viral immunoassay for detection of
nanogram quantity of antigen is proposed. The antigen linked with antibodies
adsorbed on polystyrene 96-well plates was revealed by conjugate of Fab'
fragments of antibodies with phage phi X174. The concentration of the antigen
could be detected qualitatively and quantitatively (from 0.3 ng/ml to 1000
ng/ml).
