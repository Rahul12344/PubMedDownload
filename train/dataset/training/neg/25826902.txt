OBJECTIVE: To summarize the advances of preclinical research in xenogeneic
(porcine) cell transplantation in recent years.
METHODS: The literature about the preclinical research in xenogeneic (porcine)
cell transplantation was analyzed and summarized.
RESULTS: With the application of new immunosuppressive agents and the generation 
of transgenic pigs, great progress has been achieved in xenogeneic
transplantation of pig-derived nerve cells, islet cells, liver cells, and various
types of stem cells. The survival time of xenogeneic cell (porcine) significantly
prolonged, but there is still a long way to go before clinical application.
CONCLUSION: The source ofxenogeneic (porcine) cells is abundant and the
experiments are reproducible. However, how to effectively prevent rejection and
prolong the survival time in the host, and avoid the spread of virus between
species are still need to be solved in the future research.
