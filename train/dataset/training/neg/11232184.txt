Treating a pediatric patient offers a unique opportunity to develop effective
strategies to prevent progressive liver injury and to develop novel therapeutic
regimens to reduce the need for OLT. Universal vaccination against hepatitis
viruses will prevent cirrhosis and liver cancer. Education and counseling may
reduce the incidence of alcoholic liver disease. Precise and early screening for 
metabolic liver disease and genetic or targeted therapy may prevent disease
progression. A retrospective look at the 1983 National Institutes of Health
Consensus Conference on Liver Transplantation, after more than 15 years of
experience among many centers, indicates that liver transplantation can be
effectively used to childhood liver disease. Projections 10 years into the future
offer hope that liver transplantation may not be needed in the treatment of
certain diseases such as metabolic liver disease and fulminant hepatic failure.
Focusing on prevention or treatment of liver disease in early life, thoughtful
medical management, precise decision making, and conscientious, creative, and
courageous use of nontransplant options, can save both livers and lives.
