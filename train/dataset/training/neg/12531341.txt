Viral hepatitis type C is a worldwide public health problem of major concern.
Waiting for a safe and effective vaccine able to confer protection to susceptible
individuals, public health challenges for controlling hepatitis C require
implementation of primary prevention measures that reduce risks of
acquiring/transmitting HCV infection. Screening for safe blood and blood
products, use of disposable syringes and needles and of universal precautions
have dramatically reduced risk of infection in medical setting. Health education,
counselling and testing of individuals at risk provide opportunities for
controlling HCV infection.
