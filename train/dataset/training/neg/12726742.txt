Optimal enhancement of the hybridization signal was developed for the detection
of porcine circovirus (PCV) 2 in formalin-fixed, paraffin-wax-embedded tissues
from pigs with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome. The hybridization
signal obtained after thermocycler pretreatment was very uniform across the
section, whereas the signal obtained after either proteinase K or microwave
pretreatment not only was weaker but was of variable intensity across sections.
Thermocycler pretreatment combined with brief proteinase K digestion can enhance 
signal detection for target viral nucleic acid in formalin-fixed,
paraffin-wax-embedded tissues. A strong hybridization signal was detected in the 
cytoplasm of macrophages and multinucleated giant cells in lymph node and spleen 
without background staining and morphological damage. The technical improvement
results, therefore, in an identical background at the same time as an increased
signal and, thus, may help detect lower levels of PCV2 DNA in formalin-fixed,
paraffin-wax-embedded tissues.
