Human antibodies were generated by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) immortalization of B 
cells derived from tumor draining lymph nodes of cancer patients. Antibodies were
screened for reactivity in ELISA against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the
protein core of the Polymorphic Epithelial Mucin (PEM). Epitopes within this
region are in fact considered to be tumor specific since they are selectively
exposed on tumor cells due to aberrant glycosylation. Human antibodies thus
selected react in ELISA and immunohistochemistry with PEM-expressing tumor cells.
This is the first demonstration of the existence of B cell immune response
against selected epitopes of PEM and, in association with the cytotoxic T cell
(CTL) response already demonstrated, represents the basis for the use of
synthetic peptides as vaccines in cancer patients.
