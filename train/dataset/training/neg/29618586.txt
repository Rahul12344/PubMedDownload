Zika virus has been associated with a wide range of neurological complications.
Neurologists in areas without current active transmission of the virus may be
confronted with Zika-associated neurological disease, as a large number of
returning travellers with Zika virus infection have been reported and the virus
continues to spread to previously unaffected regions. This review provides an
overview of Zika virus-associated neurological disease and aims to support
neurologists who may encounter patients returning from endemic areas.
