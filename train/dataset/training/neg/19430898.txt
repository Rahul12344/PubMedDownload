The incomplete sequences of two large, 10-12 kbp, double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs)
found in the TW-2 isolate of the saprophytic fungus, Phlebiopsis gigantea (Pg)
are reported. Both PgV-TW2 dsRNA1 and dsRNA2 potentially encode fusion proteins
which are apparently expressed by a translational frameshifting mechanism. The
C-terminal region of both predicted proteins was 21% identical and contained the 
eight motifs conserved in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of dsRNA mycoviruses and 
had highest similarity with members of the family Totiviridae, but possibly do
not form virions. The remainder of the N-terminal protein sequences predicted
from the PgV-TW2 dsRNA1 and dsRNA2 sequences and the 3'-terminal nucleotide
sequences of both dsRNAs had no homology with one another or any sequence in the 
database suggesting that individually both may be members of novel families of
mycoviruses.
