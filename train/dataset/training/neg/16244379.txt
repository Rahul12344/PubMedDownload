The Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport is determined to be as well
prepared as possible for an influenza pandemic, if one should occur. Various
measures based on the use of vaccines, antiviral agents and guidelines are being 
implemented or prepared. The aim is to maintain social and economic
infrastructure as much as possible during a pandemic outbreak of influenza. In
this context, the ministry is drawing on advice provided by the Health Council in
two separate reports.
