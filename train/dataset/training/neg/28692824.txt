This paper addresses the issue of public acceptance of vaccination with specific 
attention being paid to the role of education in vaccine uptake. Using Flash
Eurobarometer 287 (2009) survey data and exploring it through the lens of Beck's 
reflexive modernization and Roger's protection motivation theories we examined
how individual-level factors affect intention to get vaccinated, particularly
aimed at examining whether higher education predicts more or less vaccination
intention in different societies. The empirical results support an idea that at
least for seasonal flu educational differences in vaccination uptake are
contextual upon the reflexivity of the society in which respondent happens to
live. Educated people living in more reflexive modernized countries tend to
oppose vaccination against seasonal flu more that those highly educated living in
less advanced societies, indicating that skeptical attitude towards science that 
is intrinsic to the modern post-industrial nations induces the immunization
opposition among most informed and distrustful social group.
