In 107 patients with glomerulonephritis (GN) (28 were with acute and 79 with
chronic GN) and 54 patients afflicted with other diseases of the kidneys,
peripheral blood leukocytes were examined for HBsAg by indirect
immunofluorescence. In 60 patients with GN and 32 patients with other diseases,
blood sera were examined for HBsAg and anti-HBs by enzyme immunoassay along with 
examination of blood leukocytes for HBsAg. In blood leukocytes of GN patients,
HBsAg was detected in 23.4% of cases, whereas in patients afflicted with other
diseases of the kidneys, in 5.6% of cases. In the blood serum, HBsAg was also
demonstrated more frequently in GN patients (in 15% of cases) as compared to
patients with other diseases of the kidneys (in 3.1% of cases). The rate of
anti-HBs demonstration did not significantly differ in patients with GN and in
those suffering from other diseases of the kidneys. None of the examined patients
both with GN and other diseases of the kidneys showed at a time HBsAg and
anti-HBs in the serum or HBsAg in leukocytes and anti-HBs in the blood serum.
HBsAg in leukocytes and in the blood serum was identified at a time only in one
patient afflicted with chronic GN.
