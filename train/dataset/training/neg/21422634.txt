Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is widely reported to develop after renal transplantation
and is induced by activation of a latent human herpes virus 8. We report the
clinical features and outcome of a 50-year-old woman who presented with KS 18
weeks after starting immunosuppressive therapy for vasculitis. She had
positive-titer IgG antibody to human herpes virus 8. Cyclophosphamide pulses were
interrupted, and prednisone was decreased gradually to 10 mg/day. Skin lesions
showed important regression with stabilization of the general state and renal
function. Eight months later, the patient presented with a diffuse cutaneous KS
that required the discontinuation of steroids. Within 1 month, her general status
and renal function deteriorated, and she died with a disseminated intravascular
coagulation syndrome.
