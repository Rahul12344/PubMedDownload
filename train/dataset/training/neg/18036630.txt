The adenovirus E1A 243R oncoprotein encodes a potent transcription-repression
function within the N-terminal 80 amino acids. Our proposed model of E1A
repression predicts that E1A interacts with important cellular proteins on
chromatin. Consistent with this idea, we report here that E1A proteins from in
vivo formaldehyde cross-linked 293 cells are closely associated with chromatin
even after several stringent purification steps including double isopycnic CsCl
density gradient centrifugation and size exclusion chromatography. Likewise, E1A 
proteins expressed from virus during productive infection of HeLa cells are
closely associated with chromatin starting at early times after infection. No
other adenoviral proteins are necessary for E1A 243R protein to associate with
chromatin. Analyses of chromatin from HeLa cells infected with adenovirus vectors
expressing E1A 243R protein with deletions in different E1A functional domains
indicate that sequences within the E1A N-terminal repression domain are needed
for the majority of E1A's interactions with chromatin.
