Natural killer (NK) cells become activated during viral infection in response to 
cytokines or to engagement of NK cell activating receptors. However, the identity
of cells sensing viral particles and mediating NK cell activation has not been
defined. Here, we show that local administration of a modified vaccinia virus
Ankara vaccine in mice results in the accumulation of NK cells in the subcapsular
area of the draining lymph node and their activation, a process that is strictly 
dependent on type I IFN signaling. NK cells located in the subcapsular area
exhibited reduced motility and were found associated with CD169(+)-positive
subcapsular sinus (SCS) macrophages and collagen fibers. Moreover, depletion of
SCS macrophages using clodronate liposomes abolished NK cell accumulation and
activation. Our results identify SCS macrophages as primary mediators of NK cell 
activation in response to lymph-borne viral particles suggesting that they act as
early sensors of local infection or delivery of viral-based vaccines.
