The pathogenicity of HNjz15, an NADC30-like strain of porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), was investigated and compared to that of a
highly pathogenic PRRSV JAX1 strain. Six-week-old pigs infected with each virus
showed typical clinical symptoms, including high fever and respiratory disorders.
Pigs infected with JXA1 had more-severe clinical manifestations than pigs
infected with HNjz15. HNjz15 replicated in vivo with kinetics similar to those of
JXA1 but induced a lower level of PRRSV-specific antibody at the beginning of
virus infection. Histopathologically, JXA1 infection led to more-severe lung
lesions and broader organ tropism than HNjz15 did. Different from what was
observed with the previously reported NADC30-like PRRSV JL580 strain, all
HNjz15-infected pigs survived until the end of the study. All of these results
indicated that NADC30-like PRRSV HNjz15 is virulent to pigs but is less
pathogenic than the JXA1 and JL580 PRRSV strains.
