The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) can potentially cause impairment to
linguistic functioning. This study was the first to compare selected aspects of
speech motor control, expressive language and receptive language functioning in
individual HIV infected children. Results suggested clinically stable HIV
infected children can develop linguistic impairment. Such impairment is in danger
of going unnoticed without assessment. Thorough and regular assessment of the
linguistic functioning of long-term survivors of paediatric HIV disease is
essential if optimal speech and language therapy management strategies are to be 
devised.
