The susceptibility of chicken kidney and oviduct organ cultures to a vaccine
strain of avian infectious bronchitis virus.

Peters RW, Darbyshire JH, Cook JK.

The minimal infectious dose of the H52 strain of infectious bronchitis virus for 
organ cultures of oviduct and kidney was compared in chickens of different ages. 
Organ cultures of oviduct were found to be highly susceptible to infection
regardless of the age of chicken and no difference in susceptibility could be
demonstrated between cultures of the magnum and uterus regions of the mature
oviduct. Kidney organ cultures were less susceptible and resistance to infection 
increased significantly (P less than 0.001) with the age of the chicken from
which cultures were prepared.
