Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a spindle-shaped vascular cell tumor that occurs in the 
skin, lymphoid, respiratory and gastrointestinal tissues. It may resemble
aggressive malignant neoplasm in HIV-related or in post-transplant types but
classic form may behave as benign, potentially controllable and reversible
hyperplasia. KS lesions from the onset are dispersed and multicentric. KS
probability increases in solid organ transplant recipients (approximately 3/1000 
patients). KS occurrence is associated with: type and dose of immunosuppression, 
chronic stimulation by foreign allograft antigens, viral infections (Herpes virus
8), anti rejection and induction therapy, etc. 90% of KS cases appear as dark
blue or purplish macular lesions that may form nodular tumors. Histological
picture shows networks of spindle shaped cells and vascular spaces surrounded by 
an endothelial cell layer. There is no uniform schema of KS treatment in renal
transplant recipients. Immunosuppression must be reduced to the lowest levels
which preserve allograft function. CsA should be converted to mofetil
mycophenolate or mTOR-inhibitors. After conversion to MMF regression of KS was
observed, although low therapeutic MMF doses seem to be appropriate. Sirolimus
seems to inhibit the growth of established vascularized tumors and this effect is
best realized with relatively low immunosuppressive doses of drug.
