We report three cases of yellow fever (YF) in a family traveling from the city of
Sao Paulo, Brazil (without previous vaccination) to an endemic area, acquiring
the disease and presenting mild-to-moderate symptoms. Despite posing the
intermittent risk of YF in endemic areas, it also alerts to the threat of
introduction and spread of YF in the urban cycle, when infected travelers return 
to non-endemic areas where potential vectors are highly prevalent.
