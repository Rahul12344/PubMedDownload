Immunological memory is classically regarded as an attribute of antigen-specific 
T and B lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system. Cells of the innate immune
system, including natural killer (NK) cells, have been considered short-lived
cytolytic cells that can rapidly respond against pathogens in an
antigen-independent manner and then die off. However, NK cells have recently been
described to possess traits of adaptive immunity, such as clonal expansion after 
viral antigen exposure to generate long-lived memory cells. In this review, we
will discuss the current evidence for viral-induced NK cell memory in both mice
and humans.
