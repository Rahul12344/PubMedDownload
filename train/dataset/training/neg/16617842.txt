West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family, genus Flavivirus.
Its reservoir hosts are wild birds. Infection is transmitted to humans by
infected mosquitoes of the genus Culex. In most cases, it is either asymptomatic 
or manifests itself as mild fever. Typically, WNV illnesshas a sudden onset with 
fever above 39 degrees C and accompanying symptoms such as chills, headache,
arthralgia, myalgia, back ache, cough and sore throat. Gastrointestinal symptoms 
are frequently reported. Generalized lymphadenopathy and conjunctivitis may
develop. In some patients the infection can progress to meningoencephalitis.
Diagnosis is currently based on detection of IgM antibodies in blood and
cerebrospinal fluid or direct detection of WNV RNA.
