We have assayed for the presence of human polyomaviruses in urine of autoimmune
disease patients, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren's syndrome 
(SS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or dermatomyositis/polymositis (DM/PM), by PCR. 
The results indicate that approximately 40% of patients were JCV positive and 15%
of the JCV positive patients were also infected by BKV at the same time according
to Southern blot and DNA sequencing of the PCR products. Interestingly, the JCV
present in autoimmune diseases patients were Taiwan-1, Taiwan-2, and Taiwan-3
strains with pentanucleotide-A (GGGAA) and/or -B (AAAGC) deletions within the
regulatory region. In addition, BKV found in the examined samples were Taichung-1
and Taichung-2 strains. Taichung-1 had two nucleotide alterations and Taichung-2 
had six nucleotide differences within the regulatory region when compared to WW
BKV archetype. Although the examined autoimmune diseases patients included RA,
SLE, PM, DM, and SS patients, there appears to be no correlation between disease 
and virus strains. However, Taiwan-2 strain JCV with two copies of
pentanucleotide-A deletion was present in the patient with the longest period of 
immunosuppressive medication.
