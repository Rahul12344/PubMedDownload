In this paper we describe the current status of the chemotherapy of HIV-related
disease, and the newly emerging approaches to this problem. Azidothymidine, the
first anti-HIV drug, is now used by thousands of patients with AIDS, and is able 
to induce a substantial improvement of their clinical status. However, due to its
toxicity and its very limited activity against HIV replication in chronically
infected cells (the natural reservoir of the virus in the body), it is crucial
that new drugs be developed. A number of compounds belonging to the
dideoxynucleoside family (the same of AZT) have been synthesized and used in
HIV-infected patients, with promising results. Nevertheless, new compounds with
different mechanisms of action, and with excellent anti-HIV efficacy need to be
developed, particularly those that can inhibit the late stages of HIV
replication. This will permit a polychemotherapeutic approach against HIV
infection that, as in the case of anticancer chemotherapy, has conceivably better
chances to be effective in patients with HIV-related disease.
