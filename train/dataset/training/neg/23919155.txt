Giant viruses contain large genomes, encode many proteins atypical for viruses,
replicate in large viral factories, and tend to infect protists. The giant virus 
replication factories can in turn be infected by so called virophages, which are 
smaller viruses that negatively impact giant virus replication. An example is
Mimiviruses that infect the protist Acanthamoeba and that are themselves infected
by the virophage Sputnik. This study examines the evolutionary dynamics of this
system, using mathematical models. While the models suggest that the virophage
population will evolve to increasing degrees of giant virus inhibition, it
further suggests that this renders the virophage population prone to extinction
due to dynamic instabilities over wide parameter ranges. Implications and
conditions required to avoid extinction are discussed. Another interesting result
is that virophage presence can fundamentally alter the evolutionary course of the
giant virus. While the giant virus is predicted to evolve toward increasing its
basic reproductive ratio in the absence of the virophage, the opposite is true in
its presence. Therefore, virophages can not only benefit the host population
directly by inhibiting the giant viruses but also indirectly by causing giant
viruses to evolve toward weaker phenotypes. Experimental tests for this model are
suggested.
