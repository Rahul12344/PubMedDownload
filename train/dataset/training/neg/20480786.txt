Radiesse (Bioform Medical, San Mateo, CA) is a synthetic calcium hydroxylapatite 
microsphere filler suspended in an aqueous carrier gel. Radiesse currently has
indications in the United States (U.S.) for the correction of signs of
lipoatrophy in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as well as for
the correction of moderate-to-deep nasolabial folds. There are also numerous off 
label reports in the literature of use in other facial aesthetic procedures. This
review describes the composition of calcium hydroxylapatite, its mechanism of
action, durability and safety, pre- and post-procedure care, injection
techniques, appropriate use, concomitant anesthesia, as well as potential adverse
events and complications.
