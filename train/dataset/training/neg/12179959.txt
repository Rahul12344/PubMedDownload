Understanding the biological principles behind virus-induced symptom expression
in plants remains a longstanding challenge. By dissecting the compatible
host-virus relationship temporally and genetically, we have begun to map out the 
relationships of its component parts. The picture that emerges is one in which
host gene expression and physiology are under tight temporal control during
infection.
