1. When different forms of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein-based
vaccines for generation of a neutralising antibody response to SARS-CoV were
injected into a mouse model, all the mice immunised with intramuscular
tPA-optimised 800 DNA vaccine boosted with intraperitoneal recombinant spike
polypeptide generated by Escherichia coli and intramuscular CTLA4Hinge SARS800
DNA vaccine boosted with intraperitoneal S-peptide had neutralising antibody
titres of>1:1280.2. This observation may have major practical value for field
studies, such as the immunisation of civet cats, as the cost of recombinant
proteins produced by E coli is much lower than those produced by eukaryotic
systems.3. This study indicates that the type of vaccine used for priming is
crucial for determining the type of immune response developed.Subsequent doses
will boost the immune response generated by the first dose of vaccine.
