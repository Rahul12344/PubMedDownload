Simian virus 40 (SV40)-containing DNA was rescued after the fusion of
SV40-transformed VLM cells with permissive COS1 monkey cells and cloned, and
prototype plasmid clones were characterized. A 2-kilobase mouse DNA fragment
fused with the rescued SV40 DNA, and derived from mouse DNA flanking the single
insert of SV40 DNA in VLM cells, was sequenced. Insertion of the intact rescued
mouse sequence, or two nonoverlapping fragments of it, into wild-type SV40
plasmid DNA suppressed replication of the plasmid in TC7 monkey cells, although
the plasmids expressed replication-competent T antigen. Rat cells were
transformed with linearized wild-type SV40 plasmid DNA with or without fragments 
of the mouse DNA in cis. Although all of the rat cell lines expressed
approximately equal amounts of T antigen and p53, transformants carrying SV40 DNA
linked to either of the same two replication suppressor fragments produced
significantly less free SV40 DNA after fusion with permissive cells than those
transformed by SV40 DNA without a cellular insert or with a cellular insert
lacking suppressor activity. The results suggest that two independent segments of
cellular DNA act in cis to suppress SV40 replication in vivo, either as a plasmid
or integrated in chromosomal DNA.
