The influence of procarbazine (MIH) on the induction of prophage lambda in
Escherichia coli K12 and toxic effects on Salmonella typhimurium.

Lackner F, Sch√ºpbach ME.

Natulan R (MIH, procarbazine) was tested for its ability to induce prophage
lambda in Escherichia coli GY5027. E. coli Gy4015 served as indicator strain. A
weak phage-inducing effect was observed at concentrations from 2 to 12 mg/plate
in presence of S9 prepared from rats. This effect was found not to be due to the 
formation of hydrogen peroxide. It was confirmed that, even at the same high
concentrations, no mutagenic effect can be detected with the Ames test in strains
TA98 and TA100 of S. typhimurium. However, a toxic effect was observed in
presence of S9 in S. typhimurium.
