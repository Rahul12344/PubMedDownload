Nearly 50 million people worldwide have been infected with human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV), and an estimated 12 to 13 million children have been orphaned by the
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic. The natural history of HIV
infection continues to evolve as researchers and clinicians unearth new facts
about the virus and develop new treatment regimens for patients. The status of
anti-HIV treatments is never static but constantly changing. Patients and
providers struggle with adherence issues. Vaccine development, viewed as an
essential step in controlling the epidemic, is complicated by the genetic
diversity of the virus and the inability of the body to clear the virus.
Tremendous strides have occurred in the HIV/AIDS arena, yet daunting challenges
remain. This overview article presents the natural history, the current status,
and future trends of HIV infection.
