Marek's disease--survey on vaccination failures.

Zanella A.

Twelve years after the initial development of efficacious vaccines against
Marek's disease--prepared mostly from HVT--and their subsequent use on a large
scale, there is a general opinions that failures have been increasing in
incidence and in severity. Many factors have been held responsible for these
failures, and, though efforts are being made to obviate them, no acceptable
solutions have been found sofar in the control of the disease in the field. If
mistakes in the preparation, storage handling and administration of vaccine are
excepted, because these mistakes, though not infrequent, are easier to prevent,
the main causes that must be considered are: 1. The heavy and very early exposure
to infection, in houses that are not well disinfected or when birds are reared
for many cycles in the same place without cleaning or disinfecting, or in
multi-age farms, where habits become established, particularly in broilers and
pullet rearing, and also for economic reasons. 2. The considerable variability in
the susceptibility to MD of different genetic strains of commercial chickens. 3. 
The appearance of the supposed new biological variants of virus, as recently
found in the U.S. The purpose of this study has been the evaluation of the
influence of these causes on the more and more frequent outbreaks of MD in our
country. While the importance of the genetics and of the degree of and age at
exposure has been irrefutably proven, data concerning the appearance of
biological variants of MD virus are still short and controversial.
