Diarrhoea is defined either clinically or pathophysiologically. Some
epidemiological issues are considered in a global as well as in a national
perspective. The main etiologies and pathophysiological mechanisms are referred. 
Some important natural defenses against intestinal infection are pointed out.
Clinical manifestations are briefly described. The main therapeutical guidelines 
are discussed. Breast milk is referred to as one of the most important preventive
measures against acute infectious diarrhoea.
