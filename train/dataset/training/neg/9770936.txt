Plantar verrucae, caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), are commonly found in
patients who have tested positive for the antibodies to human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV). A better understanding of the characteristics of plantar verrucae in
HIV+ patients in needed. A pilot study was conducted concentrating on three
characteristics--the size, the number, and the clinical type--of verrucae present
in this population. These parameters were studied in HIV+ and HIV- populations,
and they were evaluated in relation to the CD4 levels of HIV+ individuals. The
HIV+ individuals presented with plantar verrucae that were larger and more
numerous than those found in HIV- individuals. The HIV+ population presented with
all three clinical types of plantar verrucae and had significantly more
mosaic-type warts than did HIV- individuals. The three characteristics did not
correlate with CD4 cell counts, suggesting that the severity and extent of HPV
infection do not depend on the level of immunosuppression of the HIV+ patient.
