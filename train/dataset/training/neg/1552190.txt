Recent studies using biotinylated in situ hybridization (ISH) have utilized a
wide range of detection protocols for the biotinylated hybrids, leading to
conflicting reports in the literature regarding sensitivity. In this study we
compared 11 different detection protocols for biotinylated ISH using a measles
virus-specific RNA probe on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded central nervous
system tissue infected with measles virus. Maximum sensitivity was achieved with 
five-step detection protocols incorporating the use of a monoclonal antibody to
biotin. Single-step detection protocols were found to be insensitive, as shown by
their failure to detect viral nucleic acid in infected white-matter cells. Only
by increasing the number of steps in the detection protocols were these infected 
cells demonstrable. Unless pre-hybridization, hybridization, and detection
protocols are optimized, the results obtained in pathogenicity studies using ISH 
could be misinterpreted, leading to false conclusions about nucleic acid
distribution. This also applies to the ever-increasing use of ISH for diagnostic 
purposes.
