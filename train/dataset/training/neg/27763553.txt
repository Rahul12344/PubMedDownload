West Nile virus (WNV) is a (+) sense, single-stranded RNA virus in the Flavivirus
genus. WNV RNA possesses an m7GpppNm 5' cap with 2'-O-methylation that mimics
host mRNAs preventing innate immune detection and allowing the virus to translate
its RNA genome through the utilization of cap-dependent translation initiation
effectors in a wide variety of host species. Our prior work established the
requirement of the host mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) for
optimal WNV growth and protein expression; yet, the roles of the downstream
effectors of mTORC1 in WNV translation are unknown. In this study, we utilize
gene deletion mutants in the ribosomal protein kinase called S6 kinase (S6K) and 
eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4EBP) pathways
downstream of mTORC1 to define the role of mTOR-dependent translation initiation 
signals in WNV gene expression and growth. We now show that WNV growth and
protein expression are dependent on mTORC1 mediated-regulation of the eukaryotic 
translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein/eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4EBP/eIF4E) interaction and eukaryotic
initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex formation to support viral growth and viral 
protein expression. We also show that the canonical signals of mTORC1 activation 
including ribosomal protein s6 (rpS6) and S6K phosphorylation are not required
for WNV growth in these same conditions. Our data suggest that the
mTORC1/4EBP/eIF4E signaling axis is activated to support the translation of the
WNV genome.
