Peptide mapping was used for comparative analysis of nonstructural proteins (NS1)
of 21 strains of human and animal influenza A viruses. At least 4 groups of NS1
proteins could be distinguished by the analysis of the peptide maps; we
designated these groups as 0, 1, 2, and 3. Group O includes NS1 proteins of human
influenza virus serotype HON1, group 1 - NS1 proteins of viruses of serotypes
H1N1 and H2N2, group 2 - NS1 proteins of viruses of serotype H3N2. NS1 proteins
of avian influenza viruses A/duck Czechoslovakia/63, A/turkey Massachusetts/65,
A/petrel Australia/1/71, A/duck Ukraine/63, and A/turkey Ontario/68 have been
included into group 3.
