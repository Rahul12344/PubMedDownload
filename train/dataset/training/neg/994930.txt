Murray Valley encephalitis, 1974: clinical features.

Bennett NM.

Of the 58 patients who developed Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) during 1974, 22
were admitted to Fairfield Hospital, Melbourne. The patients were of all ages,
but the disease was most common in children. Calculations suggest that the
incubation period of MVE is from one to four weeks. The severity of brain damage 
varies considerably; 11 patients recovered almost completely, seven had severe
residual damage and four patients died. There are no special features which
distinguish MVE from any other form of encephalitis. The survival of five of
eight patients who required artificial respiration suggests that patients with
suspected MVE should be transported at an early stage to a hospital where
artificial respiration is available if necessary. There is no evidence that
infection with the MVE virus can cause clinical manifestations of a disease other
than acute encephalitis.
