PURPOSE: To present a case of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis associated with
occlusive vasculopathy presenting as sudden unilateral loss of vision in a human 
immunodeficiency virus-negative elderly man.
METHODS: Clinical case report and literature review.
RESULTS: An 84-year-old Chinese man with diabetes mellitus and primary open-angle
glaucoma was seen in consultation by our uveitis service for evaluation of sudden
vision loss in the right eye. Examination revealed an occlusive retinal
vasculopathy. An extensive diagnostic workup was performed, including fluorescein
angiography, serologic testing for infectious etiologies including syphilis and
tuberculosis and a temporal artery biopsy. The patient was treated with high-dose
oral prednisone, after which the biopsy returned negative for giant-cell
arteritis. Three weeks after initial presentation, the patient was noted to have 
a new area of retinitis in the temporal periphery. An anterior chamber
paracentesis was performed, and the fluid was sent for directed polymerase chain 
reaction testing, which returned positive for CMV. Human immunodeficiency virus
testing was negative. He was treated with oral valganciclovir and intravitreal
foscarnet injections and the infection subsequently resolved.
CONCLUSION: Cytomegalovirus infection can be associated with occlusive
vasculopathy in human immunodeficiency virus-negative individuals. The diagnosis 
of CMV retinitis should be considered in patients with human immunodeficiency
virus-negative who have other conditions that may compromise immune function,
particularly advanced age, diabetes mellitus, malignancy, or use of
immunosuppressive agents.
