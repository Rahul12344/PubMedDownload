The catalytic properties of the hammerhead ribozyme embedded in the (+) strand of
the satellite tobacco ringspot viral genome are analyzed with the goal of
obtaining the elemental rate constants of the cleavage (k(2)) and ligation
(k(-)(2)) steps. Two different chimeras combining the sTRSV (+) hammerhead and
the well-characterized hammerhead 16 were used to measure the cleavage rate
constant (k(2)), the rate of approach to equilibrium (k(obs) = k(2) + k(-)(2)),
and the fraction of full-length hammerhead at equilibrium (k(-)(2)/k(2) +
k(-)(2)). When compared to minimal hammerheads that lack the recently discovered 
loop I-loop II interaction, an extended format hammerhead derived from sTRSV
studied here shows at least a 20-fold faster k(2) and a 1300-fold faster k(-)(2) 
at 10 mM MgCl(2). However, the magnesium dependence of the cleavage rate is not
significantly changed. Thus, the enhanced cleavage of this hammerhead observed in
vivo is due to its higher intrinsic rate and not due to its tighter binding of
magnesium ions. The faster k(-)(2) of this hammerhead suggests that ligation may 
be used to form circular RNA genomes. This in vitro system will be valuable for
experiments directed at understanding the hammerhead mechanism and the role of
the loop I-loop II interaction.
