BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) is considered an indicator of high
hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. Performance characteristics of commercially 
available HBeAg assays have not been determined, thus it is unknown whether lack 
of HBeAg detection is because of test sensitivity or HBV basal core promoter and 
precore mutations.
OBJECTIVES: We studied the correlation between HBeAg reactivity with HBV DNA
levels in three commercially available HBeAg assays using 335 HBsAg and HBV DNA
positive serum/plasma samples.
STUDY DESIGN: Diagnostic sensitivity was determined by serial dilutions of a WHO 
HBeAg standard. The limit of HBeAg detection estimated through regression was 1
IU/mL (Centaur), 97 IU/mL (DiaSorin) and 129 IU/mL (Vitros). Of these 335
samples, enough sample volume remained in 253 samples for head-to-head comparison
of the assays.
RESULTS: 81 (32%), 41 (16%) and 36 (14%) of the samples were HBeAg positive by
the Centaur, DiaSorin and Vitros assays, respectively. Compared to the
FDA-approved Centaur assay the specificity of the other two assays was 98%, while
sensitivity was 47% for the DiaSorin assay and 41% for the Vitros assay.
Significant association was found between HBeAg positive samples and HBV DNA
levels >20,000 IU/mL; 31% of HBeAg negative samples (Centaur) had HBV DNA levels 
>20,000 IU/mL, 26% of HBeAg positive samples had HBV DNA levels <20,000 IU/mL and
5 HBeAg positive samples had HBV DNA levels <2000 IU/mL.
CONCLUSION: Discordance was seen between these HBeAg assays, indicating reliance 
on HBeAg alone as a marker of high HBV replication can be misleading. Detection
and quantification of HBV DNA remains the accurate and reliable marker of HBV
replication.
