Over the last 2 years, advances in many areas of HIV clinical research and data
on the effectiveness of potent combination therapy have substantially influenced 
the overall perspective of long-term management of HIV disease. However, the
progress against HIV also came as a result of the better understanding of HIV
pathogenesis. Research work in basic science has contributed considerably to
obtain a clearer picture of the mechanisms of HIV infection, mainly through the
understanding of key steps in the dynamics and kinetics of viral replication in
vivo. Molecular biology also revealed much about the mechanisms of HIV virulence 
and the emergence of drug resistance. This article will give a short overview of 
the most recent advances in the field.
