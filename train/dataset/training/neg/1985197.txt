The V3 loop, located near the middle of the surface envelope glycoprotein gp120, 
is the major neutralizing domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). 
Although the majority of the V3 loop is highly variable between different strains
of HIV-1, a Gly-Pro-Gly-Arg motif at the tip of the loop is highly conserved. To 
determine whether this region plays a role in fusion mediated by the HIV-1
envelope glycoproteins, we introduced seven single-amino-acid changes in the V3
loop. The mutant envelope glycoproteins were expressed from an HIV-1 envelope
expression vector and analyzed for their ability to induce cell fusion in the
absence of virus replication. Our results indicated that single-amino-acid
changes in the V3 loop were capable of completely abolishing or greatly reducing 
the ability of the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins to induce cell fusion, thereby
identifying the V3 loop as a fusion domain of HIV-1. Mutations in the highly
conserved tip of the loop or in a nonconserved region flanking the highly
conserved tip had no effect on envelope glycoprotein synthesis, processing,
transport, or binding to the CD4 receptor molecule. Mutation of the putative
disulfide bridge-forming Cys at residue 336 blocked gp160 cleavage and CD4
binding.
