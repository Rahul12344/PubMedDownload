Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV) was detected in samples of Bermuda grass (BG) from
Iran by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using two
different pairs of GFLV-specific primers, and also by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) using antiserum specific for a North American isolate of the virus.
RT-PCR detected GFLV in both fresh and dried BG tissues and in virus preparations
purified from these plants. Cloning and sequencing of the RT-PCR products
confirmed that the amplified sequences were sections of the GFLV coat protein
gene. Similar results were obtained when random and oligo(dT) primers were used
on viral RNA templates recovered from BG to synthesize cDNA for cloning and
sequencing. The virus induced few or no symptoms in BG, but could nonetheless be 
transmitted from BG to Chenopodium quinoa by mechanical inoculation. Some
isolates induced systemic chlorotic spots and leaf deformation; others remained
symptomless in this plant. Both symptomatic and symptomless C. quinoa plants were
found to be infected with GFLV, giving positive ELISA and RT-PCR tests. A North
American isolate of GFLV was found to be mechanically transmissible to BG as
indicated by positive RT-PCR results from root samples of inoculated plants.
GFLV-infected BG was widely distributed in the Fars province of Iran.
