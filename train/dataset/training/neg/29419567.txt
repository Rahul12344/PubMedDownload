BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine use increases the risk of HIV-1 infection among
seronegative users and can exacerbate disease progression in HIV-positive users. 
The biological mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear. In this
cross-sectional pilot study, we examine the associations between recent
methamphetamine use and inflammation in the rectal mucosa and peripheral blood
compartments in HIV-1 seropositive and seronegative men who have sex with men.
METHODS: HIV-seronegative and HIV-seropositive men who have sex with men
participants were enrolled (N = 24). Recent methamphetamine use was determined by
urine drug screen. Cytokines were quantified using multiplex arrays from
collected plasma and rectal sponge samples, and peripheral blood T-cell
activation was assessed by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Methamphetamine use was associated with consistently increased rectal
inflammatory cytokines, specifically interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis
factor-alpha, regardless of HIV-1 serostatus in this pilot study. This
association was significant after adjusting for age, HIV-serostatus, and
receptive anal intercourse frequency using regression analysis. Similar increases
were not uniformly observed in peripheral blood.
CONCLUSIONS: Methamphetamine use is associated with increased local mucosal
inflammatory cytokine production. These findings may help explain the increased
HIV-1 risk seen in methamphetamine users and contribute to increased inflammation
among HIV-seropositive users.
