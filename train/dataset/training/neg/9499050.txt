We have previously demonstrated that open reading frame (ORF) 50 and ORF 57
encode transcriptional regulating genes in herpesvirus saimiri. ORF 50, a homolog
of Epstein-Barr virus R protein, is a sequence-specific transactivator, whereas
ORF 57 acts posttranscriptionally. In this report, we demonstrate that the ORF 57
gene is regulated by the ORF 50a gene product. We show that the ORF 57 gene is
expressed at basal levels early in the virus replication cycle and that
thereafter it is transactivated by the ORF 50a gene product, due to an increase
in RNA levels. As it has been shown that the ORF 57 gene product downregulates
ORF 50a due to the presence of its intron, these combined observations identify a
feedback mechanism modulating gene expression in herpesvirus saimiri, whereby ORF
50a transcription is downregulated by the ORF 57 gene product, a gene which it
specifically transactivates. Furthermore, we propose that the intron-containing
ORF 57 gene downregulates itself by the same mechanism as that for ORF 50a, as
both genes are downregulated at similar times during the replication cycle.
