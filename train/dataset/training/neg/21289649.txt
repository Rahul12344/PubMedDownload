In this issue, two papers present contrasting models for the machinations of the 
measles virus attachment protein. Here we discuss how these reports illuminate
possible intersubunit motions made by the protein as it drives the fusion of
viral and cellular membranes during infection and further our understanding of
this global scourge.
