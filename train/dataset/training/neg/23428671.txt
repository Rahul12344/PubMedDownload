This study was conducted in and around Debre Zeit town to assess the field
efficacy of LSD vaccine in use and overview associated disease impact. The study 
comprised cross-sectional and retrospective study design which employed active
disease follow-up, semi-structured questionnaire survey and molecular techniques.
The finding revealed that the Kenyan sheep pox vaccine strain used for the
control of LSD did not confer expected protection. From the total of 476 animals 
observed, 22.9% and 2.31% cattle were found sick and dead due to LSD,
respectively. Breed specific morbidity rate was 22.5% in Holstein Friesian-zebu
cross and 25.9% in local zebu breed. The disease was observed to be more serious 
in young animals and also in females. A trend of seasonality was also observed in
its occurrence. The study finding urges the need for investigation of vaccine
failure including vaccine matching and alternative vaccine development.
