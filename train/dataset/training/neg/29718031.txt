We describe a case that was initially diagnosed and treated as toxic epidermal
necrolysis (TEN) by an outside hospital. After failure to improve on high-dose
steroids and intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin, the patient was transferred to our 
hospital where he was subsequently diagnosed with a disseminated herpes simplex
virus (HSV) infection. The patient recovered after 21 days of antiviral therapy. 
We review key physical examination findings that will help the clinician diagnose
a viral etiology in the setting of an acute blistering eruption with mucosal
involvement.
