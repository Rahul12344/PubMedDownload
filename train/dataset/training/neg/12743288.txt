Icosahedral double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacterial viruses are known to package
their genomes into preformed procapsids via a unique portal vertex. Bacteriophage
PRD1 differs from the more commonly known icosahedral dsDNA phages in that it
contains an internal lipid membrane. The packaging of PRD1 is known to proceed
via preformed empty capsids. Now, a unique vertex has been shown to exist in
PRD1. We show in this study that this unique vertex extends to the virus internal
membrane via two integral membrane proteins, P20 and P22. These small membrane
proteins are necessary for the binding of the putative packaging ATPase P9, via
another capsid protein, P6, to the virus particle.
