BACKGROUND: Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a rare disease, which
is characterised by the growth of papillomavirus-induced papillomas within the
respiratory tract. Malignant transformation occurs in less than 1% of the cases.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of human papillomavirus (HPV) type
11-associated juvenile-onset RRP (JORRP) initially diagnosed at the age of two
years. Remarkably high copy numbers of HPV11 DNA and antibody titres targeting
the capsid protein L1 were detected in the patient's serum. The patient developed
squamous cell carcinomas in both lungs and extraordinarily an HPV11 DNA-positive 
papillary endocardial lesion in the left atrium of the heart, which caused
thromboembolic events leading to the patient's death at 19 years old.
CONCLUSION: We here report a severe case of JORRP hallmarked by HPV11 DNAemia and
very high antibody titres directed against the major viral capsid protein L1.
Furthermore, the extent of malignant transformation and the discovery of a very
rare fatal endocardial lesion highlight the unpredictability of JORRP and the
complexity of its clinical management.
