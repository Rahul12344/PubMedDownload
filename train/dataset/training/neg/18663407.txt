To analyze the role of the 2b protein (2bP) of Peanut stunt virus (PSV) in the
viral infection cycle, we constructed PSV mutants that express either no 2bP or
N-terminal-truncated 2bP. The accumulation of wild-type and mutant viruses in
tobacco protoplasts indicated that the 2b cistron is not essential for viral
replication. Viral accumulation in Nicotiana benthamiana plants suggested that
the 2b cistron is responsible for viral accumulation in inoculated and upper
leaves and has a role in virulence. The involvement of eight N-terminal amino
acids of 2bP in these functions is discussed.
