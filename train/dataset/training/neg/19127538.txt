BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to estimate the incidence of invasive
cervical cancer (ICC) in women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and
compare it with the incidence in HIV-uninfected women.
METHODS: In a cohort study of HIV-infected and uninfected women who had
Papanicolaou tests obtained every 6 months, pathology reports were retrieved for 
women who had biopsy results or a self-report of ICC. Histology was reviewed when
reports confirmed ICC. Incidence rates were calculated and compared with those in
HIV-negative women.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 10.3 years, 3 ICCs were confirmed in
HIV-seropositive women, and none were confirmed in HIV-seronegative women. The
ICC incidence rate was not found to be associated significantly with HIV status
(HIV-negative women [0 of 100,000 person-years] vs HIV-positive women [21.4 of
100,000 person-years]; P = .59). A calculated incidence rate ratio standardized
to expected results from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database
that was restricted to HIV-infected Women's Interagency HIV Study participants
was 1.32 (95% confidence interval, 0.27-3.85; P = 0.80).
CONCLUSIONS: Among women with HIV in a prospective study that incorporated
cervical cancer prevention measures, the incidence of ICC was not significantly
higher than that in a comparison group of HIV-negative women.
