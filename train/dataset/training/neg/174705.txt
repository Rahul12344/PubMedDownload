Murine leukaemia virus expression in the AKR following thymectomy.

Tuffrey M, Crewe P, Dawson L, Holliday J, Barnes RD.

Thymectomy effectively prevents the development of spontaneous lymphoma in the
AKR but how this effect is achieved remains to be determined. One possible
mechanism, namely suppression of genomic expression of the oncogenic murine
leukaemia virus now seems unlikely since levels of the group specific MuLV
antigen were in comparision with their sham operated controls unaltered in both
neonatally and adult thymectomized AKR.
