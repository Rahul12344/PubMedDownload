OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a common risk factor in insulin resistance and
cardiovascular diseases. Although hypoadiponectinemia is associated with
obesity-related metabolic and vascular diseases, the role of adiponectin in
thrombosis remains elusive.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated platelet thrombus formation in adiponectin
knockout (APN-KO) male mice (8 to 12 weeks old) fed on a normal diet. There was
no significant difference in platelet counts or coagulation parameters between
wild-type (WT) and APN-KO mice. However, APN-KO mice showed an accelerated
thrombus formation on carotid arterial injury with a He-Ne laser (total thrombus 
volume: 13.36+/-4.25 x 10(7) arbitrary units for APN-KO and 6.74+/-2.87x10(7)
arbitrary units for WT; n=10; P<0.01). Adenovirus-mediated supplementation of
adiponectin attenuated the enhanced thrombus formation. In vitro thrombus
formation on a type I collagen at a shear rate of 250 s(-1), as well as platelet 
aggregation induced by low concentrations of agonists, was enhanced in APN-KO
mice, and recombinant adiponectin inhibited the enhanced platelet aggregation. In
WT mice, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of adiponectin additionally
attenuated thrombus formation.
CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin deficiency leads to enhanced thrombus formation and
platelet aggregation. The present study reveals a new role of adiponectin as an
endogenous antithrombotic factor.
