Prevalence in the Rome healthy population of antibodies to a human Polyoma -
virus (BK - strain).

Pan√† A, D'Arca SU, Castello C, Maldarizzi B.

A serological study of determine the prevalence of infections caused by human
Polyoma-virus (BK strain) among the healthy population of Rome has been
performed. Such virus was originally isolated from a patient undergoing a kidney 
transplantation, and later found in patients undergoing immunosuppressive
therapy. Previous serological studies showed high incidences of infections,
caused by this virus, in human populations. Other viruses, antigenically related,
were found in patients suffering from progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
Serum samples coming from 482 healthy subjects classified by age and 100 cord
blood serum samples were analyzed for antibody titers using
haemoagglutination-inhibition and complement fixation tests. High incidence of
infection caused by BK virus in the Roman population was found: specifically the 
haeomagglutination-inhibition test resulted positive in 65.2% of the samples. A
remarkable similar trend between the results obtained with both the techniques
was observed, although differences in antibody serum levels were present. The
infections, which are not transmitted during the intrauterine life, are first
noted at about two years of age. The Authors finally briefly discuss the possible
epidemiological meaning of the spreading of this infection.
