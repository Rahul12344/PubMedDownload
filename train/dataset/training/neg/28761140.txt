Combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) has drastically improved the clinical 
outcome of HIV-1 infection. Nonetheless, despite effective cART, HIV-1 persists
indefinitely in infected individuals. Clonal expansion of HIV-1-infected cells in
peripheral blood has been reported recently. cART is effective in stopping the
retroviral replication cycle, but not in inhibiting clonal expansion of the
infected host cells. Thus, the proliferation of HIV-1-infected cells may play a
role in viral persistence, but little is known about the kinetics of the
generation, the tissue distribution or the underlying mechanism of clonal
expansion in vivo. Here we analyzed the clonality of HIV-1-infected cells using
high-throughput integration site analysis in a hematopoietic stem
cell-transplanted humanized mouse model. Clonally expanded, HIV-1-infected cells 
were detectable at two weeks post infection, their abundance increased with time,
and certain clones were present in multiple organs. Expansion of HIV-1-infected
clones was significantly more frequent when the provirus was integrated near host
genes in specific gene ontological classes, including cell activation and
chromatin regulation. These results identify potential drivers of clonal
expansion of HIV-1-infected cells in vivo.
