Neutralizing antibodies against poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 were determined in
the serum samples, supplied by 11 virological institutes, from 3,341 subjects of 
different ages living in the western part of the Federal Republic of Germany. The
3 poliovirus types were found in all age groups, with a seroprevalence of at
least 80%. Although antibodies against the 3 types of poliovirus in the
age-groups up to 30 years were demonstrated more frequently than in the previous 
years in which samples had been examined (1969, 1972, 1978 and 1983), 33% of
subjects over 40 years (this age-group had not previously been tested) did not
have complete immunity against all 3 poliovirus types. For this reason
immunization against poliomyelitis should continue to be recommended when
indicated, especially before travels to regions where the disease is endemic.
