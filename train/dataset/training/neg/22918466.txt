The course of immune maturation has evolved to favour survival at each stage of
development in early life. Fetal and neonatal immune adaptations facilitate
intrauterine survival and provide early postnatal protection against
extracellular pathogens, but they leave infants susceptible to intracellular
pathogens such as viruses that are acquired perinatally. This Review focuses on
three such pathogens--HIV, hepatitis B virus and cytomegalovirus--and relates the
differential impact of these infections in infants and adults to the antiviral
immunity that is generated at different ages. A better understanding of
age-specific antiviral immunity may inform the development of integrated
prevention, treatment and vaccine strategies to minimize the global disease
burden resulting from these infections.
