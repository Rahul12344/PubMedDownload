During 2003-2004, approximately 13% of birth in Taiwan was given by foreign-born 
females. The aims of this study were to compare the seroprevalence of rubella
antibodies between Taiwan-born and foreign-born pregnant women and evaluate the
effect of rubella vaccination program in Taiwan. We reviewed the rubella antibody
test results of 5007 women during routine pregnancy check-ups at Fooyin
University Hospital during 1999-2002. In Taiwan-born women, rubella antibody was 
undetectable in 29.2%, 7.3%, and 8.3% of the cohorts born before 1971, between
1971 and 1976, and after 1976, respectively. In the cohorts born between 1971 and
1976 and after 1976, pregnant women born in China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and
Philippines had significant higher chances of being susceptible. Our results
suggested that the voluntary adult vaccination program was not as effective as
the school or wipe-out programs. Both Taiwanese women born before 1971 and
foreign-born women were more likely to be susceptible to rubella. The
introduction of 'catch-up' immunization program and enforcement of the checking
of immunization record and/or blood test before pregnancy for these women are
necessary in preventing CRS.
