A sulfated polysaccharide, named fucoidan, from the marine alga Cladosiphon
okamuranus is comprised of carbohydrate units containing glucuronic acid and
sulfated fucose residues. Here we found this compound potently inhibits dengue
virus type 2 (DEN2) infection. Viral infection was inhibited when DEN2, but not
other serotypes, was pretreated with fucoidan. A carboxy-reduced fucoidan
derivative in which glucuronic acid was converted to glucose did not inhibit
viral infection. Elimination of the sulfated function group from fucoidan
significantly attenuated the inhibitory activity on DEN2 infection with <1%
fucoidan. DEN2 particles bound exclusively to fucoidan, indicating that fucoidan 
interacts directly with envelope glycoprotein (EGP) on DEN2. Structure-based
analysis suggested that Arg323 of DEN2 EGP, which is conformationally proximal to
one of the putative heparin binding residues, Lys310, is critical for the
interaction with fucoidan. In conclusion, both the sulfated group and glucuronic 
acid of fucoidan account for the inhibition of DEN2 infection.
