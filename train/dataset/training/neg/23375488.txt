OBJECTIVE: To evaluate reproducibility of oral rinse self-collection for human
papillomavirus (HPV) detection and investigate associations between oral HPV,
oral lesions, immune and sociodemographic factors, we performed a cross-sectional
study of older adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
STUDY DESIGN: We collected oral rinse samples from 52 subjects at 2 different
times of day, followed by an oral examination and interview. We identified HPV
with the use of polymerase chain reaction platforms optimized for detection of
mucosal and cutaneous types.
RESULTS: Eighty-seven percent of individuals had oral HPV, of which 23% had
oncogenic alpha, 40% had nononcogenic alpha, and 46% had beta or gamma HPV.
Paired oral specimens were concordant in all parameters tested. Significant
associations observed for oral HPV with increased HIV viral load, hepatitis C
seropositivity, history of sexually transmitted diseases, and lifetime number of 
sexual partners.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral cavity may be a reservoir of subclinical HPV in older adults
who have HIV infection. Understanding natural history, transmission, and
potential implications of oral HPV warrants further investigations.
