To study the mechanisms involved in membrane fusion, we visualized the fusion
process of giant liposomes in real time by optical dark-field microscopy. To
induce membrane fusion, we used (i) influenza hemagglutinin peptide (HA), a 20-aa
peptide derived from the N-terminal fusion peptide region of the HA2 subunit, and
(ii) two synthetic analogue peptides of HA, a negatively (E5) and positively (K5)
charged analogue. We were able to visualize membrane fusion caused by E5 or by K5
alone, as well as by the mixture of these two peptides. The HA peptide however,
did not induce membrane fusion, even at an acidic pH, which has been described as
the optimal condition for the fusion of large unilamellar vesicles. Surprisingly,
before membrane fusion, the shrinkage of liposomes was always observed. Our
results suggest that a perturbation of lipid bilayers, which probably resulted
from alterations in the bending folds of membranes, is a critical factor in
fusion efficiency.
