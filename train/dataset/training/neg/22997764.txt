Development and preliminary assessment of a recombinant canarypox virus as an
antirabic vaccine candidate. In Argentina, rabies is limited to some northern
provinces. Availability of new vaccines abolishing the handling of the rabies
virus and allowing disease control has regional and national strategic
importance. Vaccines based on recombinant poxviruses have been successfully used 
as antirabic vaccines worldwide. Although these systems are not commercially
available, the platform to obtain recombinant canarypox viruses (CNPV) has been
previously set up in our laboratory. The aim of this work was the development and
evaluation of an antirabic vaccine candidate based on recombinant CNPV expressing
the rabies virus (RV) glycoprotein G (RG). A recombinant virus (CNPV-RG)
expressing the RG coding sequence was designed. Inoculation of mice with this
virus induced high RV seroneutralizing antibodies (3.58 and 9.76 IU/ml after 1 or
2 immunizations, respectively) and protected 78% of intracerebrally RV-challenged
animals. In addition, it was determined that CNPV-RG has a relative potency of
3.5 IU/ml. The obtained results constituted the first stage of CNPV-RG evaluation
as antirabic vaccine candidate. Further assays will be necessary to confirm its
utility in species of veterinary interest.
