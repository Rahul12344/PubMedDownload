An electron microscope study of nerves infected with human poliomyelitis virus.

DE ROBERTIS E, SCHMITT FO.

Sciatic nerves of rhesus monkeys infected with CAM and Wis. '45 strains of human 
poliomyelitis virus were fixed in formalin, sectioned, fragmented, and examined
in the electron microscope. Most of the neurotubules of nerves infected with the 
CAM strain have normal appearance but a very small number show the presence of
dense particles irregularly aligned within the edges of the neurotubules. The
diameters of the particles range between 160 and 500 A, the mean being 330 A. The
particles were found in regions along the nerve which varied with the time after 
infection, indicating a central movement of the morphological alteration of the
order of 2 mm. per hour. Relatively abundant dense particulate material was found
in nerves infected with Wis. '45 strain virus and the particles were chiefly
attached to the edges of the neurotubules and in the adjacent areas of the field.
The dense particles appear to be associated with the virus infection but no
further characterization is possible at this time.
