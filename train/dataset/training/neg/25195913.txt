The exponential increase in protein structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank
(PDB) has resulted in the elucidation of most, if not all, protein folds, thus
making molecular replacement (MR) the most frequently used method for structure
determination. A survey of the PDB shows that most of the structures determined
by molecular replacement contain less than ten molecules in the asymmetric unit
and that it is predominantly virus and ribosome structures that contain more than
20 molecules in the asymmetric unit. While the success of the MR method depends
on several factors, such as the homology and the size of an input model, it is
also a well known fact that this method can become significantly difficult in
cases with a large number of molecules in the asymmetric unit, higher
crystallographic symmetry and tight packing. In this paper, five representative
structures containing 16-18 homomeric molecules in the asymmetric unit and the
strategies that have been used to solve these structures are described. The
difficulties faced and the lessons learned from these structure-determination
efforts will be useful for selected and similar future situations with a large
number of molecules in the asymmetric unit.
