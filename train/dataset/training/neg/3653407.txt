The primary amino acid sequence within a domain of 89 residues of the central
part of the 3'-orf protein (p27 3'-orf) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-2)
shares homology with the middle and carboxy-terminal portion of the bel3 gene
product of human spumaretrovirus (HSRV). In addition, a limited region of the tat
protein of HIV-2 but not HIV-1 shows a 28% degree of homology to the deduced
protein sequence of the bel1 gene product of HSRV. Comparison between the viral
sequences suggests that the 3'-orf and bel1 gene product of HSRV could serve
similar functions to those in HIV-2.
