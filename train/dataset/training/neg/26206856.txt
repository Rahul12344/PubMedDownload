Biliary atresia (BA), a neonatal obstructive cholangiopathy, remains the most
common indication for pediatric liver transplantation in the United States. In
the murine model of BA, Rhesus rotavirus (RRV) VP4 surface protein determines
biliary duct tropism. In this study, we investigated how VP4 governs induction of
murine BA. Newborn mice were injected with 16 strains of rotavirus and observed
for clinical symptoms of BA and mortality. Cholangiograms were performed to
confirm bile duct obstruction. Livers and bile ducts were harvested 7 days
postinfection for virus titers and histology. Flow cytometry assessed mononuclear
cell activation in harvested cell populations from the liver. Cytotoxic NK cell
activity was determined by the ability of NK cells to kill noninfected
cholangiocytes. Of the 16 strains investigated, the 6 with the highest homology
to the RRV VP4 (>87%) were capable of infecting bile ducts in vivo. Although the 
strain Ro1845 replicated to a titer similar to RRV in vivo, it caused no symptoms
or mortality. A Ro1845 reassortant containing the RRV VP4 induced all BA
symptoms, with a mortality rate of 89%. Flow cytometry revealed that NK cell
activation was significantly increased in the disease-inducing strains and these 
NK cells demonstrated a significantly higher percentage of cytotoxicity against
noninfected cholangiocytes. Rotavirus strains with >87% homology to RRV's VP4
were capable of infecting murine bile ducts in vivo. Development of murine BA was
mediated by RRV VP4-specific activation of mononuclear cells, independent of
viral titers.
