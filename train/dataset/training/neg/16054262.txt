Although it has been suggested that hepatitis delta virus (HDV) can be used as a 
vector to deliver biologically active RNAs into hepatocytes, modified HDV as a
specific transporting and replicating vector in anti-viral research has not been 
investigated. In this study, we focused on the development of HDV as a
replicative vector to deliver hammerhead ribozyme into hepatocytes and the study 
of the roles of delivered hammerhead ribozyme on the replication of hepatitis B
virus (HBV). To investigate the effects of ribozyme delivered by HDV on HBV
replication, we designed two hammerhead ribozymes that specifically target the
hepatitis B virus genome. These two ribozymes were then inserted into the genome 
of hepatitis delta virus. Results showed that transfection of cells with tandem
modified HDV cDNA resulted in the production of monomer form of sense and
anti-sense genomic RNA indicating the recombinant HDV-ribozyme could replicate
effectively. Our data also indicated that ribozymes delivered by the modified HDV
had higher level of inhibition activity against HBV replication than that of
ribozyme alone. This system provides a new approach for the study of mechanisms
of HBV replication as well as for the potential treatment of HBV infection.
