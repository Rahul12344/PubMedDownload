Diagnosis of a high-grade sarcoma on fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) may
not pose any difficulty; however, further sub-typing is sometimes difficult. The 
clinical data, investigations, and finer points on cytomorphology may help for
proper categorization of the tumor, however, we encountered a case of orbital
sarcoma in an Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) positive patient, in which
further sub-typing was difficult even on histopathology and immunohistochemistry 
was helpful. The diagnostic difficulties on FNA cytology smears as well as
histopathology are highlighted.
