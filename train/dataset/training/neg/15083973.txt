Two strains of caprine herpesvirus type 1 (CpHV-1) were isolated after the
experimental reactivation of two seropositive goats in Spain. Viral DNA from
these isolates was compared with DNA from bovine herpesvirus type 1 and CpHV-1
reference strains by restriction endonuclease analysis. The two Spanish isolates 
were closely related but could easily be distinguished from each other and from
the reference strains.
