Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been successful in controlling HIV
infection, it does not provide a permanent cure, requires lifelong treatment, and
HIV-positive individuals are left with social concerns such as stigma. The recent
application of T cells to treat cancer and viral reactivations post-transplant
offers a potential strategy to control HIV infection. It is known that naturally 
occurring HIV-specific T cells can inhibit HIV initially, but this response is
not sustained in the majority of people living with HIV. Genetically modifying T 
cells to target HIV, resist infection, and persist in the immunosuppressive
environment found in chronically infected HIV-positive individuals might provide 
a therapeutic solution for HIV. This review focuses on successful preclinical
studies and current clinical strategies using T-cell therapy to control HIV
infection and mediate a functional cure solution.
