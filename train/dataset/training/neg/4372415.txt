Differential effect of phenethyl alcohol on mycoplasmas and enveloped viruses.

Staal SP, Rowe WP.

Mycoplasmas are totally inactivated by a 20-min treatment with 1% phenethyl
alcohol, whereas suspensions of enveloped viruses resist the same treatment. This
treatment has proved successful in eliminating mycoplasma contamination of a
virus suspension.
