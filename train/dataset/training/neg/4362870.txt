Studies of nondefective adenovirus 2-simian virus 40 hybrid viruses. IX. Template
topography in the early region of simian virus 40.

Patch CT, Lewis AM Jr, Levine AS.

The DNAs of the five nondefective adenovirus 2 (Ad2)-simian virus 40 (SV40)
hybrid viruses contain overlapping segments of the early region of wild-type SV40
DNA. The complementary DNA strands of these five viruses have been separated with
synthetic polyribonucleotides in isopycnic cesium chloride gradients. The
relative amounts of early and late SV40 template in the DNA of each virus were
determined by RNA-DNA hybridization with late lytic SV40 RNA, which contains
sequences complementary to both templates. From the distribution of early and
late templates in the five overlapping SV40 segments, we conclude that either the
entire early region of SV40 is symmetrically transcribed in vivo, or, more
probably, that the early SV40 templates are not contiguous.
