We present a case of an 80-year-old woman who presented with a dry cough,
shortness of breath and general malaise. She had presented 5 days previously with
a sore throat, feeling feverish and with non-specific symptoms. Her background
included paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and hypertension. She was initially
thought to have decompensated heart failure secondary to atrial fibrillation and 
was initiated on diuretic therapy. However, a transthoracic echocardiogram
performed revealed collapse of the right ventricle and a swinging heart,
suggestive of cardiac tamponade. The patient underwent therapeutic
pericardiocentesis where 700 mL of exudative, blood-stained fluid was drained.
Subsequent testing of the pericardial fluid revealed the presence of Epstein-Barr
virus DNA. Serial follow-up transthoracic echocardiograms revealed resolution of 
the pericardial effusion and the patient remained asymptomatic.
