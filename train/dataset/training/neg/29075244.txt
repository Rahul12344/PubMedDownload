H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) of genotype S frequently donate internal genes
to facilitate the generation of novel reassortants such as H7N9, H10N8, H5N2 and 
H5N6 AIVs, posing an enormous threat to both human health and poultry industry.
However, the pathogenicity and transmission of reassortant H5 viruses with
internal gene cassette of genotype S H9N2-origin in chickens and mice remain
unknown. In this study, four H5 reassortants carrying the HA and NA genes from
different clades of H5 viruses and the remaining internal genes from an H9N2
virus of the predominant genotype S were generated by reverse genetics. We found 
that all four H5 reassortant viruses showed attenuated virulence in both chickens
and mice, thus leading to increased the mean death times compared to the
corresponding parental viruses. Consistently, the polymerase activity and
replication ability in mammalian and avian cells, and the cytokine responses in
the lungs of chickens and mice were also decreased when compared to their
respective parental viruses. Moreover, these reassortants transmitted from birds 
to birds by direct contact but not by an airborne route. Our data indicate that
the internal genes as a whole cassette from genotype S H9N2 viruses play
important roles in reducing the pathogenicity of the H5 recombinants in chickens 
and mice, and might contribute to the circulation in avian or mammalian hosts.
