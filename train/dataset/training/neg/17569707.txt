Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) non-structural proteins are major components of
replication complex that is modulated by several host factors. We previously
reported that nucleolin, a representative nucleolar marker, interacts with the
NS5B through two separated sequences, amino acids (aa) 208-214 and 500-506, and
that W208 in the former stretch is essential for both nucleolin-binding and HCV
replication. Here we evaluated the role of the latter stretch aa 500-506 of
WRHRARS in nucleolin-binding and HCV replication scanned by alanine-substituted
clustered mutant (cm) or point mutant (pm). One tryptophan and three arginine
residues in the sequence were found to be essential both for nucleolin-binding in
vivo and HCV replication detected with a HCV subgenomic replicon transfected into
Huh7 cells. NS5B-binding of nucleolin was further delineated by truncation and
clustered mutants of nucleolin. Arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) repeat in the
Glycine arginine rich (GAR) domain were defined to be indispensable for
NS5B-binding immunologically detected in in vivo and in vitro although short
internal-truncations of RGG repeat are tolerable for NS5B-binding. These results 
indicate that nucleolin is a critical host factor for HCV replication through the
direct interaction between W208 and several residues at the sequence, aa 500-505,
of NS5B, and the long-turn motif including RGG repeat at nucleolin C-terminal.
