Transcription of adenovirus 2 major late and peptide IX genes under conditions of
in vitro nucleosome assembly.

Matsui T.

Plasmid DNA containing adenovirus 2 major late and peptide IX genes was assembled
into nucleosomes in vitro, and the assembled nucleosomes were used as a template 
to study the regulatory mechanism of transcription initiation under these
conditions. Neither the major late nor peptide IX genes was transcribed on the
already-assembled nucleosomes. However, the major late gene, but not the peptide 
IX gene, was transcribed efficiently when the DNA was incubated with HeLa cell
extracts prior to assembly into nucleosomes. These results indicate that
prebinding of some component in the cell extracts to DNA is essential to activate
transcription of the major late gene on nucleosomes assembled under the
conditions used here. Since gene IX on the nucleosomes was not transcriptionally 
active regardless of preincubation of DNA with the extracts, some other component
or another, different template structure which is not able to be identified in an
in vitro system with deproteinized DNA template might be required for activation 
of peptide IX gene transcription. To know the function of the upstream sequences 
of the major late gene, effects of the deletion on transcription of nucleosomes
were compared with that of deproteinized DNA. The result showed that depression
of transcription by deleting the upstream sequences had more effect on
nucleosomes than on deproteinized DNA.
