Response of ferrets and monkeys to intranasal infection with human, equine and
avian influenza viruses.

Marois P, Boudreault A, DiFranco E, Pavilanis V.

Rhesus monkeys and ferrets were exposed to intranasal inoculation of several
strains of egg-adapted avian, equine and human influenza viruses and to strains
of mouse-adapted equine influenza viruses. Local replication of virus and
seroconversion were observed in the majority of these animals. However, clinical 
infection was observed only in ferrets.
