In vitro experiments studied the antiviral activity of 11 different drugs against
viruses of bovine infective rhinotracheitis (BIRT) and bovine viral diarrhea
(BVD). The 50% inhibiting concentrations of the test agents were determined in
the monolayers of MDBK and KCT cell cultures. Only did phosprenyl show a
virucidal activity against BIRT virus. All the tested drugs significantly
inhibited the reproduction of BIRT virus in the sensitive MDBK cell cultures.
Thus, bromuridin, acyclovir, ribavirin and methisazonum inhibited the virus by > 
or = 100,000 times; liposomal ribavirin, gossypolum, anandinum, polyprenolum,
phosprenyl, by 1000-10,000 times; eracond and argovit, by 100 times. In
experiments on BVD virus, the cultured KCT cells displayed the antiviral activity
of bromuridin, phosprenil, polyprenolum, methisazonum, acyclovir, gossypolum,
argovit, and ribavirin (in two variants), which caused a statistically
significant (100-10,000-fold) decrease in the productive activity of this virus. 
Eracond and anandid proved to be ineffective.
