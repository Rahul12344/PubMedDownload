Protein trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus is
central to cellular homeostasis. ER export signals are utilized by a subset of
proteins to rapidly exit the ER by direct uptake into COPII vesicles for
transport to the Golgi. Norwalk virus nonstructural protein p22 contains a
YXÎ¦ESDG motif that mimics a di-acidic ER export signal in both sequence and
function. However, unlike normal ER export signals, the ER export signal mimic of
p22 is necessary for apparent inhibition of normal COPII vesicle trafficking,
which leads to Golgi disassembly and antagonism of Golgi-dependent cellular
protein secretion. This is the first reported function for p22. Disassembly of
the Golgi apparatus was also observed in cells replicating Norwalk virus, which
may contribute to pathogenesis by interfering with cellular processes that are
dependent on an intact secretory pathway. These results indicate that the ER
export signal mimic is critical to the antagonistic function of p22, shown herein
to be a novel antagonist of ER/Golgi trafficking. This unique and well-conserved 
human norovirus motif is therefore an appealing target for antiviral drug
development.
