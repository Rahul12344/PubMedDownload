Genetic heterogeneity and evolutionary relationships among selected strains of
adenovirus type 3 (Ad3) isolated in the former USSR (1976-1988) were examined
using the restriction endonuclease Cfr131 with a 4-base recognition cleavage
site. The population of adenovirus type 3 showed significant genetic instability.
Evolution of genomic variants of Ad3 was found to have regional localization
associated with definite periods of adenovirus circulation.
