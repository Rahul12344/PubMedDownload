Heparan sulfates from Swiss mouse 3T3 and SV3T3 cells: O-sulfate difference.

Keller KL, Keller JM, Moy JN.

A difference in the extent of sulfation between the heparan sulfate isolated from
Swiss 3T3 mouse cells and that from Swiss 3T3 cells transformed by the DNA virus 
SV40 has been reported previously. This variance is manifested by different
chromatographic and electrophoretic properties. Heparan sulfates from the two
cell types were treated with nitrous acid under conditions that gave selective
deaminative cleavage of glucosaminyl residues with sulfated amino groups in order
to define the nature of the difference in sulfation further. The O-sulfate
containing fragments from the heparan sulfates were compared by gel filtration
and ion-exchange chromatography. The results showed that the 3T3 heparan sulfate 
contains 8% more O-sulfate than does the SV3T3 heparan sulfate. Analysis of
uronic acids revealed that both types of heparan sulfates contain 45% L-iduronic 
acid and 55% D-glucuronic acid. These and other observations indicate that the
primary difference in sulfation between the 3T3 and SV3T3 heparan sulfates lies
in the extent of O-sulfation.
