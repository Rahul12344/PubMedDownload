The presence of herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) DNA in the feather tips of chickens 
vaccinated with HVT was assessed by dot blot hybridisation with a probe specific 
for HVT and lacking homology to MDV DNA. Only small amounts of HVT DNA were
detected in the feather tips of chickens that were vaccinated or left in contact 
with HVT vaccinated chickens. However when chickens were challenged with virulent
MDV, HVT DNA was detected in the feather tips of vaccinated chickens and the
largest amount was detected 35 days after vaccination. HVT DNA was recovered in
significantly higher quantities from some of the MDV-infected chickens than from 
those infected by contact. This suggests that MDV infection may provide helper
functions for HVT. MDV DNA was identified in the feather tips of MDV-challenged
chickens from 25 to 45 days after challenge. Thus, immunisation of chickens with 
HVT did not prevent the replication of MDV in the feather tips but only
diminished it.
