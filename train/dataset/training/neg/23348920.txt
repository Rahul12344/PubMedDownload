A direct and efficient impedimetric method is presented for the detection of
Bacillus anthracis Sterne vegetative cells, using Gamma phages as probes attached
to screen-printed carbon electrode microarrays. The carbon electrodes were
initially functionalized through cyclic-voltammetric reduction of a nitro-aryl
diazonium moiety, followed by further reduction of nitro groups to amino groups, 
and finally by treatment with glutaraldehyde. Functionalization (probe
immobilization) using Gamma phages was verified by XPS and TOF-SIM experiments.
The Gamma phage-modified microarrays were then used to detect B. anthracis Sterne
bacteria in aqueous electrolyte media. Faradaic impedimetric detection of
bacteria in KCl solution containing the ferri/ferro cyanide redox couple shows a 
gradual increase in Z' (real impedance) values, taken from the extrapolation of
the linear portion of Nyquist plots in the low frequency range, for sensors
placed in contact with increasing concentrations of B. anthracis. ΔZ' values vary
from 700 to 5300 Ohms for bacteria concentrations ranging from 10(2) to 10(8) cfu
mL(-1). These shifts in Z' are attributed to a decrease in diffusion controlled
charge transfer to the electrode surface following capture of intact B.
