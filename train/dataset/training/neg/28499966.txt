Interferon-inducible protein 56 (IFI56, also known as ISG56/IFIT1,
interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1) is strongly induced 
in response to interferon and a potent inhibitor of viral replication and
translational initiation. Here, we describe the identification of IFI56 (OfIFI56)
in olive flounder, its characteristic features, and expression levels in various 
tissues before and after viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infection. The
full-length OfIFI56 sequence was identified from rapid amplification of cDNA ends
PCR. The complete coding sequence of OfIFI56 is 1971 bp in length and encodes 431
amino acids. The putative OfIFI56 protein has multiple tetratricopeptide (TPR)
motifs, which regulate diverse biological processes, such as organelle targeting,
protein import, and vesicle fusion. Based on sequence analysis, the Larimichthys 
crocea IFI56 protein (61%) had the highest sequence homology to OfIFI56. In
healthy olive flounder, OfIFI56 mRNA expression was detected in many tissues such
as intestine, gill, head kidney, heart, spleen, and trunk kidney tissues. After
VHSV challenge, OfIFI56 mRNA was significantly up-regulated in these tissues.
Additionally, OfIFI56 expression was induced by poly I:C but not by Streptococcus
parauberis and S. iniae infection or lipopolysaccharide injection in kidney and
spleen tissues of olive flounder. These results demonstrate that piscine OfIFI56 
expression is not induced by bacterial infection but is selectively induced by
viral infection, especially VHSV, and that OfIFI56 may play an important role in 
the host response against VHSV infection.
