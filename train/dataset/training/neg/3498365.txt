Enhancement of maternal and neonatal natural killer cell activity with
interleukin-2.

Baker DA, Milch PO, Salvatore W, Luft B.

Natural killer cell activity, which is vital to the immune surveillance against
viruses and tumor cells, is significantly lower in the newborn infant than in the
mother. Incubation of maternal and cord blood lymphocytes with interleukin-2
significantly increases natural killer activity in both. The increase is
substantially greater in the cord blood lymphocytes.
