The human serum albumin gene: structure of a unique locus.

Hawkins JW, Dugaiczyk A.

The entire gene for human serum albumin (HSA) has been isolated from a genomic
DNA library, carried in the lambda Charon 4A vector. Six independent isolates
have been found to hybridize to a cloned HSA cDNA probe, and all six clones share
restriction site sequence homology in the overlapping portion of their DNA. These
results seem to indicate that the albumin gene is single-copy, or unique, within 
the human haploid genome. Measuring from the "CAP" site to the "poly(A)" addition
site, albumin gene comprises 16.5 kb of DNA.
