Drug-induced aseptic meningitis (DIAM) represents a diagnostic challenge since
clinical and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings may be indistinguishable from a
bacterial meningitis. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) are commonly used in a
variety of diseases, including inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Although
usually well-tolerated, various adverse effects have been reported. DIAM is a
serious neurological side effect of IVIg therapy: albeit rare (0.067% of all IVIg
infusions), the condition represents an important diagnostic challenge and should
be considered by physicians. Here we report a case of an aseptic meningitis
induced by IVIg therapy in a child with acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection 
and thrombocytopenia.
