Cellular RNA and influenza-virion RNA are synthesized from different
pyrimidine-nucleoside-triphosphate pools in chick-embryo cells.

DÃ¤mmgen JW, Scholtissek C.

Chick embryo cells infected with an influenza A (fowl plague) virus have been
labelled with (3H)-uridine for different lengths of time. Virion RNA and cellular
RNA have been separated by specific hybridization with a surplus of unlabelled
viral complementary RNA and RNase digestion. The ratio of the specific
radioacticity in the UMP and CMP moieties of both types of RNA has been
determined. Since the rate of approach to equilibrium of CMP to UMP labelling of 
both types of RNA is completely different it is concluded that cellular and
virion RNA are synthesized using different pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphate
pools.
