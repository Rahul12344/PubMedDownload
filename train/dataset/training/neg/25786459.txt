We herein report the case of a leukemia patient who developed hepatitis E seven
months after undergoing a transfusion with contaminated blood products. The
latency period in this case was significantly longer than that of typical
hepatitis E. Recently, chronic infection with hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 3 
has been reported in immunocompromised patients. There is a possibility that our 
patient was unable to eliminate the virus due to immunosuppression following
chemotherapy and the administration of steroids. The prevalence of HEV in healthy
Japanese individuals is relatively high and constitutes a critical source of
infection via transfusion. Hepatitis E is an important post-transfusion
infection, and immunocompromised patients may exhibit a long latency period
before developing the disease.
