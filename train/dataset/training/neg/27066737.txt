Lymphangiogenesis plays a pivotal role in diverse pathological conditions. Here, 
we demonstrate that a carbohydrate-binding protein, galectin-8, promotes
pathological lymphangiogenesis. Galectin-8 is markedly upregulated in inflamed
human and mouse corneas, and galectin-8 inhibitors reduce inflammatory
lymphangiogenesis. In the mouse model of corneal allogeneic transplantation,
galectin-8-induced lymphangiogenesis is associated with an increased rate of
corneal graft rejection. Further, in the murine model of herpes simplex virus
keratitis, corneal pathology and lymphangiogenesis are ameliorated in Lgals8(-/-)
mice. Mechanistically, VEGF-C-induced lymphangiogenesis is significantly reduced 
in the Lgals8(-/-) and Pdpn(-/-) mice; likewise, galectin-8-induced
lymphangiogenesis is reduced in Pdpn(-/-) mice. Interestingly, knockdown of
VEGFR-3 does not affect galectin-8-mediated lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC)
sprouting. Instead, inhibiting integrins α1β1 and α5β1 curtails both galectin-8- 
and VEGF-C-mediated LEC sprouting. Together, this study uncovers a unique
molecular mechanism of lymphangiogenesis in which galectin-8-dependent crosstalk 
among VEGF-C, podoplanin and integrin pathways plays a key role.
