Permissiveness to replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) differs in T 
lymphocytes and macrophages. In T cells, HIV transcription is poorly detected in 
vivo. Cloned, normal T lymphocytes show very little, if any, basal activity of
the HIV enhancer and low nuclear expression of NF-kappa B, a potent
transcriptional activator of the HIV enhancer. In contrast, fixed tissue
macrophages express detectable HIV proteins, indicating permanent virus
transcription. One explanation for the perpetuation of virus infection in
macrophages could be sustained nuclear NF-kappa B expression. However, the U937
monocytic cell line, which is fully permissive to HIV replication, is known to
express only low levels of nuclear NF-kappa B. We show here that chronic HIV
infection results in both induction of a nuclear factor with antigenic properties
indistinguishable from those of NF-kappa B and permanently increased HIV enhancer
activity. This phenomenon, which is independent of tumour necrosis factor, is
associated with HIV replication, and is thus likely to explain at least in part
the perpetuation of HIV infection in monocytes.
