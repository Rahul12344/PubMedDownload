Motivated by the occurrence of a case of suspected tick-borne meningoencephalitis
(TBE) in a forestry worker of the Delnice Forestry Enterprise, 139 sera samples
were collected from his co-workers, for TBE-specific IgG antibody testing. The
commercially purchased ELISA and our own indirect immunofluorescence tests were
used. Two sera samples were found positive and another six as inconclusive. All
of them were sent for confirmation to the Institute of virology, University of
Vienna. The two previously positive sera were also ELISA positive in Vienna, the 
rest being qualified as negative. Accepting that the first case really had TBE
and that the two seropositives have experienced infection with the TBE virus, it 
is inferred that in the wider region of Delnice there is an until now unknown TBE
focus, quiescent there for an unknown period of time.
