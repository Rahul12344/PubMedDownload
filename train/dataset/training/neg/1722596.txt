Monoclonal antibodies were generated against cottontail rabbit papillomavirus
(CRPV) and tested for neutralization of CRPV-induced papillomas on domestic NZW
rabbits. Intact CRPV was semi-purified on CsCl gradients and used to immunize
BALB/c mice. Hybridomas were prepared from a fusion with lymph node cells, and
supernatants from growing hybridomas were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) for reactivity to both intact and disrupted CRPV virion antigen.
Supernatants from 22 cultures were initially selected that were responsive to
CRPV. Ten were reactive to intact CRPV alone, 4 were reactive only to disrupted
CRPV, and 8 were reactive to both intact and disrupted CRPV virion antigen. None 
of these supernatants contained antibodies which recognized epitopes on CRPV
capsid proteins (L1 and L2) that were separated on Western blots. Five hybridomas
which produced antibodies that bound to intact CRPV, and did not react to intact 
HPV-11 or BPV-1 were selected and tested for antibody-mediated neutralization of 
CRPV infectivity. All five monoclonal antibodies were neutralizing, and
identified epitopes on intact CRPV virions which were non-linear and
conformational in nature. The five neutralizing monoclonal antibodies appeared to
recognize a similar epitope or epitope cluster on the intact CRPV virion as
determined by competition ELISA.
