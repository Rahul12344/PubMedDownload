The extent of human T-cell lymphotropic retrovirus HTLV-I and HTLV-II infections 
in the general population in central Europe has not been investigated fully. Two 
hundred forty-eight thousand blood donors from southern Germany were examined
serologically for antibodies to the human lymphotropic retroviruses HTLV-I and
HTLV-II: 0.021% were confirmed positive and 0.056% were "indeterminate". A
limited number of seropositives and "indeterminate" samples were analyzed by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR): the seropositives were confirmed as positive and
43% of the "indeterminate" samples were PCR-positive. The range of 0.021%
HTLV-positives in 248,000 donors, i.e. about two in 10,000 individuals, mirrors
closely the published data for the United States.
