In vitro synthesis of a DNA probe for antisense globin sequences.

Orkin SH.

A DNA probe specific for sequences complementary to globin RNA has been prepared 
in vitro from globin complementary DNA (cDNA). Globin cDNA was used as the
template for the synthesis of a complementary strand (ccDNA) by avian
myeloblastosis virus DNA polymerase. After treatment with single strand-specific 
S1 nuclease, double-stranded globin DNA was denatured in the presence of a vast
excess of globin RNA. After hybridization of the cDNA with globin RNA, the ccDNA 
was isolated by hydroxyapatite chromatography. The ccDNA probe hybridized
efficiently to globin cDNA, but not at all to globin RNA. This probe should prove
useful in assessing the asymmetry of gene expression in cell-free transcriptional
systems.
