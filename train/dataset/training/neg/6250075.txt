Integration of hepatitis B virus sequences and their expression in a human
hepatoma cell.

Edman JC, Gray P, Valenzuela P, Rall LB, Rutter WJ.

Hepatitis derived from hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is endemic throughout
the world, but it is particularly prevalent in Asia and Africa. In these areas,
demographic studies show a strong coincidence between HBV infection (assayed by
HBV antigenic markers) and the incidence of primary liver cancer. On these
grounds, a causal link between HBV infection and primary hepatocellular cancer
has been proposed. Recently, a human hepatoma cell line (PLC/PRF/5; Alexander
cells) has been shown to produce hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). We show
here that the Alexander cell line contains at least six (four complete and two
partial) hepatitis B viral genomes integrated into high molecular weight host
DNA. An analysis using specific probes to fragments of the HBV genome suggests
that integration of the virus in most cases occurs at the nicked cohesive end
region of the virus. Expression of viral sequences using Northern blots
demonstrates the presence of RNA transcripts specific for the surface antigen
sequences of HBV DNA and the absence of detectable transcripts corresponding to
the hepatitis B core antigen.
