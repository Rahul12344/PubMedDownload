In this article a Cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigenemia and semiquantitative PCR
retrospective evaluation of 26 bone marrow allo-grafted patients for different
haematological disease is reported. Eighteen patients had a CMV reactivation
despite a prophylactic treatment, seven of those patients had both positive
antigenemia pp65 and positive semi-quantitative CMV PCR. During CMV reactivation,
3 patients developed a CMV disease despite a pre-emptive therapy. The follow up
of the antigenemia was performed since D21 until D100 post transplantation, the
antigenemia positivity occurred at D53 and was preceded about 7 days by CMV PCR
positivity The CMV disease wasn't associated with a high viral load. All patients
that had CMV reactivation had a positive CMV serology before the graft, whereas
only 37.5% of the patients who did not reactivate had a positive CMV serology.
Respectively half patients who reactivated and only 12.5% of those who didn't had
a Graft versus host disease (GVHD), witch preceded the reactivation about 21 days
in six of the formers. Clinical and biological signs presented by our patients in
this cases report, seems to be associated more with the GVHD than with CMV
reactivation.
