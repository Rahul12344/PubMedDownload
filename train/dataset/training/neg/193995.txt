In vitro primary induction of cytotoxic T cells against virus-infected syngeneic 
cells.

Blanden RV, Kees U, Dunlop MB.

An in vitro method is described for primary induction of murine cytotoxic T cells
against syngeneic cells infected with ectromelia or lymphocytic choriomeningitis 
(LCM) virus. Cytotoxicity was assayed by 51Cr release from macrophage or L929
target cells. Cytotoxic activity was sensitive to anti-theta and complement and
was expressed only against target cells infected with the same virus and sharing 
H-2K or H-2D genes with the infected stimulator cells. The crucial factors in
generating responses were mouse strain, responder: stimulator ratio, nature of
infected stimulator cells, and presence of sufficient macrophages. C57BL/6 cells 
were less demanding than CBA/H and BALB/c cells. Under optimal conditions defined
here, the in vitro response had similar kinetics and potency to the primary
response in the spleen in vivo.
