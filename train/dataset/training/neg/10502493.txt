The objectives of this study was to investigate the role of DNA vaccines in the
generation of an immune response and that elicited against individually encoded
proteins of PRRSV. The genomic regions encoding ORF s 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the PRRS
virus vaccine strain were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pc DNA 3.1 
(+). Inoculations with the recombinant plasmids resulted in detection of PRRS
virus-specific antibodies in 71 per cent of the immunized animals by ELISA, virus
neutralization and/or Western blotting assays. In addition, cellular immune
responses were detected in 86 per cent of the immunized pigs by interferon gamma 
assay and/or proliferation assay. Pigs in the control group had no detectable
immune response to PRRS virus. The results obtained demonstrated that DNA
immunization against PRRS virus results in the production of both humoral and
cell mediated immune responses in pigs. The results also indicate that
neutralization epitopes for PRRS virus are present on the viral envelope
glycoproteins encoded by ORF 4 and ORF 5.
