From January 1986 through December 1987, 277 cases of cryptosporidiosis in calves
were diagnosed by the South Dakota State University Diagnostic Laboratory.
Cryptosporidium sp was the only pathogen identified in 142 (51.3%) of the calves.
Concurrent infections with rotavirus, coronavirus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella
sp, bovine viral diarrhea virus, or other pathogens were identified in the
remaining 135 calves. After elimination of cases involving autolyzed specimens or
calves with chronic diarrhea, records of 11 calves with acute, severe
cryptosporidiosis were identified in which Cryptosporidium sp was the only
pathogen.
