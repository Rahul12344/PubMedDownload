Immunohistochemical studies of one typical and two atypical cases of molluscum
contagiosum with anti-CD34 monoclonal antibodies showed a tightly enclosing fine 
vasculature around the lesional masses of the disease. The thin interstitial
septa between the lobules of the molluscum lesions also contained abundant
endothelium. An electron microscopic study of a pinched-off lesion of common
molluscum contagiosum demonstrated that the tightly enclosing blood vessels
lacked muscle layers, suggesting that they were capillaries, being a distance of 
several hundred nanometers from the basal cells of the molluscum mass. A 3D
constructed image of the vasculature confirmed a network of the vessels. These
tightly enclosing vascular networks around the lesions of molluscum contagiosum
support the rapid growth of this disease.
