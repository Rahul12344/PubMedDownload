Experimental studies revealed that the elements of the human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 (HIV-1) 5'-untranslated leader region (5'-UTR) can fold in vitro
into two alternative conformations, branched (BMH) and 'linearized' (LDI) and
switch between them to achieve different functionality. In this study we
computationally explored in detail, with our massively parallel genetic algorithm
(MPGAfold), the propensity of 13 HIV-1 5'-UTRs to fold into the BMH and the LDI
conformation types. Besides the BMH conformations these results predict the
existence of two functionally equivalent types of LDI conformations. One is
similar to what has been shown in vitro to exist in HIV-1 LAI, the other is a
novel conformation exemplified by HIV-1 MAL long-distance interactions. These
novel MPGAfold results are further corroborated by a consensus probability matrix
algorithm applied to a set of 155 HIV-1 sequences. We also have determined in
detail the impact of various strain mutations, domain sizes and folds of
elongating sequences simulating folding during transcription on HIV-1 RNA
secondary structure folding dynamics.
