Immune responses to live attenuated and inactivated mumps virus vaccines in
seronegative and seropositive young adult males.

Ilonen J, Salmi A, Tuokko H, Herva E, Penttinen K.

Live attenuated mumps virus vaccine and Formalin-inactivated mumps vaccine were
compared for their ability to induce antibody responses and cell-mediated immune 
responses as measured by a lymphocyte blast transformation test (LBT). The
subjects studied were conscripts of the Finnish Defense Forces. In seronegative
subjects antibody levels induced by attenuated virus were more variable than
those induced by inactivated virus, including one failure with the live vaccine
out of a total of nine subjects. IgM antibody class response was seen only in
four of nine subjects vaccinated with live virus--in those subjects with the
highest post-vaccination antibody levels and strongest LBT responses. Increases
of antibody levels in originally seropositive subjects were higher in subjects
vaccinated with inactivated virus. Cell-mediated immunity induced by both
vaccines was relatively poor when measured by the LBT test. At a time of 6-8
months after vaccination, LBT responses in originally seronegative subjects were 
not observed.
