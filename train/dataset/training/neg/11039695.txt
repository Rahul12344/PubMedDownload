Based on the description of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), a
particle model is developed describing the most important properties of this
epidemic. Also control measures (mass and ring vaccination) are implemented. This
model shows the expected behavior in simulations. Since it is impossible to treat
this model analytically, we use ideas of branching processes on two levels to
derive a caricature of the particle model. In simulations it is shown that this
caricature exhibits similar behavior as the particle system. It is possible to
analyze the caricature and, in this way, to obtain expressions for the most
important quantities like the reproduction number or the expected final number of
infected individuals etc. In this way mass vaccination and ring vaccination can
be compared and control strategies can be optimized.
