The role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in Japanese encephalitis is largely
unknown. In this study, we found that Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) strain
SA14-14-2 regulates the expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78),
transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and splicing
of X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA in BHK-21 cells. SA14-14-2-induced
cytopathic effect and decrease in viability were also observed. Moreover, the
inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) inhibitor 3,5-dibromosalicylaldehyde and JNK
inhibitor SP600125 increased cell viability and reduced cell apoptosis but did
not alter virus replication in SA14-14-2-infected BHK-21 cells. These results,
for the first time, demonstrate that JEV induces apoptosis by the IRE1/JNK
pathway of ER stress response.
