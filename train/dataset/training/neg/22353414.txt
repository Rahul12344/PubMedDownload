Focal epithelial hyperplasia (FEH), or Heck's disease, is a benign proliferative 
viral infection of the oral mucosa that is related to Human Papil-lomavirus
(HPV), mainly subtypes 13 and 32. Although this condition is known to exist in
numerous populations and ethnic groups, the reported cases among Caucasians are
relatively rare. It presents as asymptomatic papules or nodules on the oral
mucosa, gingiva, tongue, and lips. Histopathologically, it is characterized by
parakeratosis, epithelial hyperplasia, focal acanthosis, fusion, and horizontal
outgrowth of epithelial ridges and the cells named mitozoids. The purpose of this
case report was to present 3 cases of focal epithelial hyperplasia in a pediatric
age group. Histopathological and clinical features of cases are discussed and DNA
sequencing analysis is reported in which HPV 13, HPV 32, and HPV 11 genomes are
detected.
