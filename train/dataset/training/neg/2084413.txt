The aim of the present study was to identify the most useful serum markers for
the early identification of the infection by the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV). To this end, sequential serum samples of 19 individuals who later had
seroconversion to anti-HIV were evaluated. The p24 antigen (Ag-HIV) was the
earliest marker of the infection, although it could only be detected in five of
the 19 individuals: in two as an isolated marker and in the remaining four
associated to anti-HIV (first generation Western blot: WB-1, and recombinant
enzyme immunoanalysis: EIA-2G). In 12 of the 19 individuals, WB-1G (Pasteur) was 
the technique which permitted the earliest detection of anti-HIV: in five cases
with bands which made the unequivocal diagnosis of the infection, and in seven
with indeterminate results (anti-HIV against core or envelope antigens). The
second earliest test was the detection of anti-HIV against envelope antigens with
a competitive EIA-2G (Abbott). WB-1G (Sorin) detected anti-HIV in a late phase,
as it was the case for EIA-1G or EIA-2G for anti-HIV against antigens encoded by 
the GAG gene. These results indicate that there may be remarkable differences in 
sensitivity among the different commercial kits. The use of EIA for Ag-HIV
together with WB-1G shortens the gap period of HIV infection, even if
seroconversion is identified with EIA-2G for global anti-HIV.
