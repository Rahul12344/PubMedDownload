Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) latent infection is a causative co-factor for endemic
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC). NPC-associated variants have been identified in
EBV-encoded nuclear antigen EBNA1. Here, we solve the X-ray crystal structure of 
an NPC-derived EBNA1 DNA binding domain (DBD) and show that variant amino acids
are found on the surface away from the DNA binding interface. We show that
NPC-derived EBNA1 is compromised for DNA replication and episome maintenance
functions. Recombinant virus containing the NPC EBNA1 DBD are impaired in their
ability to immortalize primary B-lymphocytes and suppress lytic transcription
during early stages of B-cell infection. We identify Survivin as a host protein
deficiently bound by the NPC variant of EBNA1 and show that Survivin depletion
compromises EBV episome maintenance in multiple cell types. We propose that
endemic variants of EBNA1 play a significant role in EBV-driven carcinogenesis by
altering key regulatory interactions that destabilize latent infection.
