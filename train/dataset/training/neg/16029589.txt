OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical outcomes and hepatic histology of patients
with hepatitis C.
METHODS: Nine patients with hepatitis, 4 males and 5 females, aged 44 +/- 7, who 
were infected during transfusion or blood donation underwent follow-up for 13
approximately 14 years: liver histological examination by biopsy,
ultrasonography, biochemical examination of alanine transaminase (ALT), apartate 
aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin (TBIL), serum anti-HCV by ELISA, and 
HCV RNA quantification by PCR.
RESULTS: ALT were higher than the normal value at every time point and HCV RNA
remained positive (3.57 x 10(8) approximately 7.21 x 10(9) copies/L) in all
patients. Ultrasonography showed mild and moderate hepatitis (3 and 6 cases
respectively). The modified histological activity indices (HAI) were 5.0
approximately 8.5 and the fibrosis scores were 1 approximately 4. The ALT value
was higher in the moderate cases than in the mild cases, and higher in those with
higher HAI. The viral load was higher in the patients infected by the virus of
the genotype 1b than in the patients infected by the virus of the genotype 2.
CONCLUSION: The clinical outcomes and hepatic histology of patients with
hepatitis C seem not very severe.
