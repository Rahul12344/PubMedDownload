background: tumour necrosis factor (tnf) central immune response to
plasmodium infection. plasma concentration influenced allele variants
in promoter region tnf. study's objectives assess tnf allele
variants (tnf(-1031), tnf(-308)): (1) modulation malaria rates young
tanzanian children; (2) modulation severity malaria indicated by
haemoglobin concentrations time presentation febrile episodes; and
(3) association plasmodium infection haemoglobin concentration in
symptomless parasite carriers.
methods: data placebo-controlled trial 612 tanzanian children
aged 6-60 months height-for-age z-score range -3 sd 1.5 sd was
utilised. plasmodium infection baseline treated with
artemether-lumefantrine. episode malaria predefined current
plasmodium infection inflammatory response (axillary temperature ≥37.5°c 
or whole blood c-reactive protein concentration ≥8 mg/l) children reported
sick. linkage disequilibrium (ld) pattern assessment well haplotype
analysis conducted using haploview. cox regression models used primary
analysis accounted multiple episodes per child.
results: genotyping 94.9% (581/612) children tnf(-1031) (tnf(-1031)t>c);
allele frequency 0.39. corresponding values rs1800629 (tnf(-308)g>a) were
95.4% (584/612) 0.17. compared wild type genotype (tt), malaria rates 
were increased tnf -1031cc genotype (hazard ratio, hr [95% ci]: 1.41
[1.01‒1.97] 1.31 [0.97‒1.76] crude analysis adjusting for
pre-specified baseline factors, respectively) decreased the
tnf(-308)aa genotype (corresponding hr: 0.13 [0.02‒0.63] 0.16 [0.04‒0.67]).
these associations weaker analysing first episodes malaria (p value 
-0.59 0.38, respectively). evidence allele variants tnf(-1031) and
tnf(-308) affected haemoglobin concentration first episode malaria, that
they modified association plasmodium infection haemoglobin
concentrations baseline observed.
conclusion: cohort tanzanian children, tnf (-1031)cc genotype 
associated increased rates malarial episodes, whereas tnf(-308)aa
genotype associated decreased rates.
