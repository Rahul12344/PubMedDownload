human erythrocytes contain trace amounts polyamines lack active
polyamine biosynthetic enzymes. remarkable increase polyamine content, and
in activity ornithine s-adenosyl-l-methionine decarboxylases, noted
in synchronous cultures malarial parasite, plasmodium falciparum.
polyamine biosynthesis reached peak values early trophozoite stage,
whereas nucleic acid protein synthesis occurred later mature trophozoites.
dl-alpha-difluoromethylornithine, irreversible inhibitor ornithine
decarboxylase, interfere merozoite invasion ring-form
development, prevented transformation trophozoites schizonts.
concomitantly, synthesis proteins nucleic acids significantly
inhibited. inhibitory effects could readily reversed diamine
putrescine. macromolecular synthesis schizogony normal 5-10
mm-dl-alpha-difluoromethylornithine 0.1 mm-putrescine added the
cultures simultaneously.
