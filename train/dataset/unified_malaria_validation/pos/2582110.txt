ornithine decarboxylase inhibition malaria-infected red cell: model for
polyamine metabolism growth.

whaun jm, brown nd.

the addition dl-alpha-difluoromethylornithine, irreversible inhibitor of
ornithine decarboxylase, human plasmodium falciparum-infected red cells in
continuous culture decreased parasite growth intracellular polyamine
concentrations. growth p. falciparum infected red cells assessed by
parasite counts assays macromolecular syntheses protein, dna and
rna. polyamine concentrations measured automated high-performance
liquid chromatography method. concentrations dl-alpha-difluoromethylornithine 
greater 0.3 mm decreased intracellular levels putrescine spermidine, 
reduced ornithine decarboxylase activity inhibited growth maturation of
the intracellular parasite trophozoite stage. concomitant
decrease synthesis protein nucleic acids infected cells. the
use parasitized red cell model system together polyamine inhibitors 
provide means studying polyamine synthesis cell growth design of
new antimalarial therapy.
