"exotic" european cattle highly susceptible t. annulata infection. in
immunised animals, several effective anti-parasite responses demonstrated,
such anti-macroschizont cytotoxic cells (ctl), nitric oxide killing of
parasites. failure infected animals mount effective primary immune
response suggests presence parasite directly interferes 
development immunity. activation pathways cd4+ cells draining
lymph nodes examined course primary infection found
that development essential arm immune response altered.
instead interacting antigen presenting cells paracortex, the
majority cd4+ cells rapidly activated developing infected cells in
the medulla node. activation cells infected cells also drastically
alters cytokines produced cells. effective immune responses, 
the principal cytokine involved appears il-2, small, controlled
"bursts" ifn gamma production. however, il-2 responsiveness transient 
in animals undergoing primary infection, ifng production greatly
elevated. ifn gamma appear control parasitised cells, may even
aid growth infected macrophages--large numbers macrophages enter the
cell cycle peak period ifn gamma production. uncontrolled
parasite-induced ifn gamma production also likely account local
failure antibody responses. germinal centres infected lymph nodes lose
normal morphology, ifn gamma sensitive zones failing develop. third
strategy parasite uses evade immune response destruction 
affecting ctl activity. ctl infected draining lymph nodes lose expression of
the adhesion molecule cd2--a molecule essential adherence target cells
for lysis. cd2- ctl unable lyse macroschizont infected cells.
