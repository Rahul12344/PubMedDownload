early interactions innate immune cell populations, dendritic cells
(dc) natural killer (nk) cells, affect ability acquired immune
response control infection intracellular microorganisms. study, 
investigated activation bovine nk cells cd13(+) splenic dc stimulated
with either mycobacterium bovis bcg babesia bovis merozoites. splenic dc 
used either immediately selection (cytokine(-)) exposure to
gm-csf, il-4 flt3l 72 h (cytokine(+)). phenotypic analyses showed
up-regulation mhcii, cd80 cd86 cytokine(+) dc compared to
cytokine(-) dc. purified nk cells (cd335(+)cd3(-)cd2(+/-)cd8alpha(+/-)) were
co-cultured microbial-exposed cytokine(-) dc cytokine(+) dc either
transwell cell-to-cell format nk cell ifn-gamma production and
cytotoxicity assessed. nk cell ifn-gamma production dependent on
cell-to-cell contact. microbial-stimulated cytokine(+) dc induced significantly
more ifn-gamma production nk cells cytokine(-) cells. contrast,
cytotoxicity perforin up-regulation pronounced nk cells cultured
with cytokine(-) dc cytokine(+) dc. therefore, activation bovine nk cells
by microbial-stimulated cd13(+) splenic dc influenced maturation state 
of dc suggesting different roles splenic dc disease-induced
maturation.
