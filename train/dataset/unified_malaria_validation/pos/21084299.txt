the malaria parasite invades terminally differentiated erythrocytes, it
grows multiplies surrounded parasitophorous vacuole. plasmodium blood
stages translocate newly synthesized proteins outside parasitophorous vacuole
and direct various erythrocyte compartments, including cytoskeleton
and plasma membrane. here, show remodeling host cell
directed parasite also includes recruitment dematin, an
actin-binding protein erythrocyte membrane skeleton repositioning 
to parasite. internalized dematin found associated plasmodium
14-3-3, belongs family conserved multitask molecules. also show 
that, vitro, dematin-14-3-3 interaction strictly dependent on
phosphorylation dematin ser(124) ser(333), belonging two 14-3-3
putative binding motifs. study first report showing component 
of erythrocyte spectrin-based membrane skeleton recruited malaria
parasite following erythrocyte infection.
