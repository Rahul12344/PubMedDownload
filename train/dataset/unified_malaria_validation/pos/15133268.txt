the present study conducted determine cause low parasitemia and
simultaneous reticulocytosis canine babesiosis. parasitemia was
significantly decreased vitro cultures babesia gibsoni the
pretreatment host canine erythrocytes lead acetate, specific
inhibitor pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase subclass (p5n-i). serum dogs
chronically infected b. gibsoni decrease activities of
hexokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase
in canine reticulocytes, although previously reported serum 
inhibitory effects maturation reticulocytes canine p5n-i
and purine-specific 5'-nucleotidase activities. furthermore, vitro
multiplication b. gibsoni significantly inhibited pyrimidine
nucleotides cytidine 5'-monophosphate (5'-cmp), preferentially
catalyzed p5n-i also inhibits morphological maturation canine
reticulocytes. purine nucleotides inosine 5'-monophosphate (5'-imp) also 
had inhibitory effect multiplication parasite. results
suggest nucleotides 5'-cmp 5'-imp might accumulate young
erythrocytes and/or serum dogs infected b. gibsoni result the
decreased activity erythrocyte 5'-nucleotidase, accumulation 
nucleotides might inhibit multiplication parasite simultaneously 
retard maturation reticulocytes. results obtained vitro
examinations present study may partially clarify relationship 
low parasitemia simultaneous reticulocytosis vivo canine babesiosis.
