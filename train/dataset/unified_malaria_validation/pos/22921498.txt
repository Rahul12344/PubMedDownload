hemolytic activity animals infected various babesia species well
reported. study, confirmed serum babesia rodhaini-infected
mice also showed hemolytic activity. erythrocytes non-infected mice were
lysed co-incubation b. rodhaini-infected serum. catalase activity 
non-infected target erythrocytes suppressed co-incubation the
hemolytic serum b. rodhaini-infected mice. furthermore, serum hemolytic
activity inhibited target erythrocytes incubated hemolytic
serum presence exogenous catalase. study indicated hemolytic
serum down-regulate antioxidant capacity non-infected healthy
erythrocytes, possibly result catalase activity, thereby leading to
hemolysis.
