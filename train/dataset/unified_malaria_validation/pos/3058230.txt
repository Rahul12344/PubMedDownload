enzymes glycolytic pathway well ancillary enzymes studied 
in normal red cells parasitized plasmodium falciparum culture varying 
parasitemias well isolated parasites. levels enzymes except
diphosphoglycerate mutase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, adenylate
kinase elevated. extreme elevations hexokinase, aldolase, enolase,
pyruvate kinase, adenosine deaminase concentrations noted. most
cases, electrophoretically distinct bands enzyme activity also seen.
these findings partly explain previously noted 50- 100-fold increase in
glucose consumption infected red cells suggest knowledge of
these parasite enzymes genetic basis may aid designing new
chemotherapy understanding evolution parasites.
