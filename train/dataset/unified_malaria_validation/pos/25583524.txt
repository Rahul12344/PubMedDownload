following transmission mosquito bite mammalian host, plasmodium 
parasites first invade replicate inside hepatocytes infecting
erythrocytes causing malaria. mechanisms limiting plasmodium reinfections
in humans living regions malaria endemicity mainly explored by
studying resistance induced blood stage infection. however,
epidemiologic studies suggested high-transmission areas,
preerythrocytic stages also activate host resistance reinfection. this, along 
with recent discovery liver infections trigger specific effective 
type interferon (ifn) response, prompted us hypothesize this
pre-erythrocyte-stage-induced resistance linked liver innate immunity.
here, combined experimental approaches mathematical modeling to
recapitulate field studies understand molecular basis behind such
resistance. present newly established mouse reinfection model and
demonstrate rodent malaria liver-stage infection inhibits reinfection. 
protection relies activation innate immunity involves type i
ifn response antimicrobial cytokine gamma ifn (ifn-γ). importantly,
mathematical simulations indicate predictions based experimental 
murine reinfection model fit available epidemiological data. overall, study
revealed liver-stage-induced innate immunity may contribute the
preerythrocytic resistance observed humans regions malaria
hyperendemicity.
