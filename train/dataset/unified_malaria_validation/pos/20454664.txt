cerebral malaria continues difficult treat complication plasmodium 
falciparum infection children. shown platelets major
deleterious immune functions experimental cerebral malaria (ecm). one the
platelet derived mediators identified particularly important is
platelet factor 4/cxcl4. prior work demonstrated pf4(-/-) mice are
protected ecm, reduced plasma cytokines, reduced t-cell
trafficking brain. show pf4 drives monocyte cytokine
production kruppel like factor 4 (klf4) dependent manner. monocyte depleted 
plasmodium berghei infected mice improved survival, klf4 greatly
increased control, monocyte depleted mice. pf4(-/-) mice less
cerebral monocyte trafficking change klf4 expression. data
indicate pf4 induction monocyte klf4 expression may important step 
in pathogenesis ecm.
