the central role cells immune response hemoprotozoan
parasites, helper cells t-dependent antibody production, as
effector cells acting directly indirectly intracellular parasites through
the elaboration cytokines, prompted us investigate bovine cellular 
immune response b. bovis antigens. cell clones generated four b.
bovis-immune cattle vitro stimulation soluble membrane associated
merozoite antigen characterized reactivity various forms of
antigen different geographical isolates b. bovis b. bigemina. the
clones categorized seven different groups based differential
patterns reactivity. panel cell clones additional clones
specific either 77 kda merozoite apical complex associated protein (bb-1)
or 42 kda major merozoite protein (msa-1) analyzed cytokines.
biological assays measure il-2/il-4, ifn-gamma tnf-alpha/tnf-beta and
northern blot analysis detect mrna encoding bovine il2, il-4, ifn-gamma,
tnf-beta tnf-alpha revealed differential production cytokines by
clones different antigen specificities. two bb-1-specific cell clones
produced th1 pattern cytokines: il-2, ifn-gamma, tnf-beta tnf-alpha,
but il-4. clones specific 42 kda protein produced undetectable levels
of cytokines, expressed unrestricted th0 pattern cytokine mrna: 
il-2, il-4, ifn-gamma tnf-alpha.(abstract truncated 250 words)
