sequestration infected erythrocytes brain microvasculature contributes to
cerebral malaria, severe complication plasmodium falciparum infection.
sequestration likely involves cytoadherence parasitized erythrocytes to
cerebral microvascular endothelium. elucidation receptors ligands
involved cytoadherence likely contribute complete understanding
of malaria pathophysiology. integrin receptor alpha(v)beta3 involved in
several physiologic pathologic adherence processes, role in
cytoadherence investigated. study, ability of
erythrocytes infected p. falciparum adhere alpha(v)beta3 human
microvascular endothelium investigated. cytoadherence quantified under
continuous flow shear stress 1.0 dyne/cm2 mimic shear forces the
cerebral microcirculation. adherence erythrocytes infected p. falciparum 
to human microvascular endothelial cells 7-270-fold greater uninfected
erythrocytes. pretreatment microvascular endothelial cells anti-alpha(v) 
antibody inhibited p. falciparum-infected erythrocyte adherence 45 +/- 6%
(mean +/- sem). data suggest addition endothelial
receptors previously described, p. falciparum parasitized red blood cells may
bind integrin alpha(v)beta3 microvascular endothelial cells.
