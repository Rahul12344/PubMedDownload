changes selected blood serum components electrocardiography (ecg) were
investigated 20 adults (13 females 7 males) water buffaloes suffering
from severe theileriosis. age animals used study ranged 1.5-5 
yr. theileriosis diagnosed observation parasites peripheral
blood presence schizonts lymphocytes provided from
swollen lymph nodes. statistically significant decreases observed the
means rbc, wbc, packed cell volume (pcv) blood infected animals. the
means levels sodium, calcium, phosphorus, potassium infected animals
were lower healthy animals, decrease potassium was
significant. mean serum activities aspartate transferase alanine
aminotransferase significantly higher uninfected animals. three
cases atrial premature beat, 2 cases sinus tachycardia, 2 sinus
arrhythmia, 1 first degree atrioventricular block ecg. present 
study showed t. annulata infection cattle associated with
hematological biochemical, ecg changes.
