background: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) enzyme plays an
important role many cellular functions. deficiency enzyme results from
point mutations coding region g6pd gene. g6pd-deficiency is
important malaria, certain anti-malarial drugs could induce haemolysis in
such patients mutations gene may influence susceptibility or
resistance disease. detailed information genetic variations g6pd
gene sri lankan populations yet revealed. study describes set
of g6pd mutations present sri lankan population association with
uncomplicated malaria.
methods: dna extracted 1,051 individuals. sixty-eight snps region
of g6pd gene genotyped. database created 1992-1993 malaria 
epidemic individuals used assess associations the
g6pd snps parasite density disease severity uncomplicated malaria
infections. linkage disequilibrium snps haplotype structures were
identified.
results: seventeen genetic variants polymorphic population. the
mutant allele major allele 9 snps. common g6pd variants already
described asians south-asians seemed absent rare this
population. severity disease uncomplicated malaria infections 
parasitaemia significantly lower males infected plasmodium
falciparum carrying ancestral allele rs915942 compared carrying
the mutant allele. parasite density males infected p. falciparum 
significantly lower also possessed mutant alleles rs5986877, 
rs7879049 rs7053878. two haplotype blocks identified, the
recombination rates higher males history malaria compared
to experienced disease past.
conclusions: detailed survey g6pd snps sri lankan
population undertaken far enabled novel description single nucleotide 
polymorphisms within g6pd gene. genetic variations identified,
demonstrated tendency associated either disease severity parasite
density uncomplicated disease males. known g6pd gene polymorphisms already 
described elsewhere either absent rare local study
population.
