microparticle (mp) efflux known mediated abca1 protein, the
plasma level cell-derived mps elevated considerably human
malarial infection. therefore, two polymorphisms positions -477 -320 in
the promoter abca1 gene genotyped tested association the
plasma mp level four groups malaria patients segregated according the
clinical severity, i.e., cerebral malaria (cm), multiorgan dysfunction (mod),
noncerebral severe malaria, uncomplicated malaria (um). trucount
tube-based flow cytometric method used exact quantification of
different cell-derived mps patients. polymorphisms abca1 gene promoter 
were analyzed use pcr/two-primer-pair method, followed restriction
fragment length polymorphism, 428 malaria patients. level circulating
plasma mps significantly higher febrile patients plasmodium
falciparum infection, especially cm patients compared healthy individuals. 
the homozygous wild-type -477 -320 genotype observed significantly 
higher patients severe malaria. patients also showed marked
increases plasma mp numbers compared um patients. report for
the first time association abca1 promoter polymorphisms susceptibility
to severe malaria, especially cm mod, indicating protective effect 
the mutant variant polymorphism. hypothesize -477t -320g
polymorphisms affect downregulation mp efflux may predictor of
organ complication p. falciparum malarial infections.
