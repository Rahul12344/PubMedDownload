zühlke c, schöffl f, jockusch h, simon d, guénet jl.

in homozygous condition, mutation adr (arrested development righting
response) mouse causes myotonia drastic reduction the
ca2+-binding protein parvalbumin (pv) fast muscles. using rat pv probe, a
mouse cdna clone isolated lambda gt11 wild-type fast-muscle library
and nucleotide sequence determined. protein coding 3'
nontranslated regions mouse gene show extensive homology rat pv
gene. result southern blot hybridization consistent single copy 
gene parvalbumin. restriction fragment length polymorphisms (rflps) between
mus musculus domesticus (e.g. c57bl/6) mus spretus (spe) detected with
the enzymes eco ri, pst i, sst i. restriction fragment patterns dna
samples 65 individual offspring (c57bl/6 x spe)f1 x c57bl/6 backcrosses
were tested pv probe matched, linkage detection, pre-existing
patterns established various rflp probes samples. a
co-distribution pv-rflps pvt-1 mlvi-2, localized on
chromosome 15, detected. thus, structural gene pv, designated pva,
maps chromosome 15 mouse whereas adr mutation shows linkage with
markers chromosome. gene locus homology chromosome 15 the
mouse chromosome 22 man (which carries human pv gene) discussed.
