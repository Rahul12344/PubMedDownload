experimental cerebral malaria (ecm) resulting plasmodium berghei anka (pba) 
infection mice results neuronal cell death. however, precise mechanisms
leading neuronal cell death ecm fully elucidated. the
present study, report presence endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress
markers activation unfolded protein response (upr) brain during
the pathogenesis ecm. specific findings included activation pkr-like
erkinase, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 cleavage activating transcription
factor (atf) 6 indicating activation three major arms upr.
further, found changes protein levels phosphorylated eukaryotic
initiation factor α (p-eif2α), atf4, growth arrest dna damage-inducible
protein 34, b cell lymphoma protein 2 (bcl-2), bcl-2-associated x protein,
caspase-7, cleavage caspase-3, caspase-12. results demonstrate er
stress-induced neuronal cell death pba-infected mice associated the
expression pro-apoptotic molecule chop downregulation of
anti-apoptotic er quality control molecules binding immunoglobulin protein,
calreticulin calnexin. chop found localized neurons 
plays essential role neuronal cell death revealed fluoro-jade b
double staining. results implicate imbalance er stress-mediated 
pro-apoptotic anti-apoptotic/survival signalling critical determinant of
neuronal cell death ecm.
