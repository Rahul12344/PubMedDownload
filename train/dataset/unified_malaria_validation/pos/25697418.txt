tropical theileriosis major protozoan disease cattle associated
with high rates morbidity mortality. indigenous cattle (bos indicus) are
less affected disease exotic crossbred cattle. genetic basis 
resistance tropical theileriosis indigenous cattle well studied.
recent reports suggest number immune response genes expressed
differentially exotic indigenous breeds play important role breed
specific resistance tropical theileriosis. studies comparing expression
of genes crossbred cattle indigenous cattle lacking. present
study compares mrna expression immune-related genes response to
theileria annulata infection indigenous crossbred cattle. peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (pbmcs) isolated blood samples indigenous
(tharparkar) crossbred (hf/bs/jersey × hariana) cattle challenged with
prepared ground-up tick supernatant carrying theileria annulata sporozoites in
vitro. qpcr employed measure relative mrna expression toll-like
receptor 10 (tlr10), signal-regulatory protein alpha (sirpa), mhc class ii dqα
(bola-dqa), musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (maf) prion protein (prnp) genes 
in infected control pbmcs crossbred indigenous cattle. basis 
of comparative fold change analysis, significant up-regulation sirpa, prnp and
mhc dqα genes significant down-regulation tlr10, cmaf mafb genes in
crossbreds compared indigenous cattle observed. results present 
study suggest breed specific differential expression genes under
study may contribute breed specific resistance theileria annulata
infection indigenous cattle compared crossbred cattle.
