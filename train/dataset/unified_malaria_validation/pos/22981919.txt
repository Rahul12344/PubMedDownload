our efforts concerned identifying features incomplete malignant
transformation caused non viral pathogens. theileria parva (t. parva) a
tick-transmitted protozoan parasite cause fatal lymphoproliferative
disease cattle. t. parva-infected lymphocytes display transformed
phenotype proliferate culture media like tumor cells, however
those cells return normal antiprotozoal treatment reflecting the
incomplete nature transformation. identify signaling pathways involved in
this form transformation t. parva-infected cells, screened library 
anticancer compounds. among these, tibc, specific inhibitor mdm2, markedly
inhibited proliferation t. parva-infected lymphocytes promoted apoptosis. 
therefore analyzed mdm2 function t. parva-infected cells. several t.
parva-infected cell lines showed increased expression level mdm2 with
alternatively spliced isoforms compared lymphoma cells cona blasts. 
addition, buparvaquone affected mdm2 expression t. parva transformed cells.
moreover, p53 protein accumulation function impaired t.
parva-infected cells cisplatin induced dna damage despite increased p53
transcription level. finally, treatment t. parva-infected cells with
boronic-chalcone derivatives tibc restored p53 protein accumulation induced
bax expression. results suggest overexpression mdm2 closely 
linked inhibition p53-dependent apoptosis t. parva-infected
lymphocytes. aberrant expression host lymphocyte mdm2 induced cytoplasmic
existence t. parva, directly and/or indirectly, associated aspects 
this type transformation t. parva-infected lymphocytes. form of
transformation shares features oncogene induced malignant phenotype
acquisition.
