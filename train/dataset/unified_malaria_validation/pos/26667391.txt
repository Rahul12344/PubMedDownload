tlrs (toll-like receptors) play important role initiation innate
immune responses invading microorganisms. although several tlrs been
reported involved innate immune response blood-stage 
malaria parasites, role tlrs development pre-erythrocytic
stage still largely unknown. here, found sporozoite lysate
could significantly activate tlr2, induce macrophages release
proinflammatory cytokines, including il-6, mcp-1 tnf-Î±, tlr2-dependent
manner. studies showed sporozoite lysate could recognized
by either tlr2 homodimers tlr2/1 tlr2/6 heterodimers, implicating the
complexity tlr2 agonist sporozoite. interestingly, tlr2 signaling can
significantly suppress development pre-erythrocytic stage of
plasmodium yoelii, liver parasite load subsequent parasitemia were
significantly elevated tlr2- myd88-deficient mice. additionally, 
observed higher level parasite burden tlr2(-/-) mice found be
closely associated reduction proinflammatory cytokines liver.
therefore, provide first evidence sporozoites activate tlr2
signaling, turn significantly inhibits intrahepatic parasites. 
may provide us novel clues design preventive anti-malaria therapies.
