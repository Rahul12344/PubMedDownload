immunity plasmodium falciparum malaria naturally acquired individuals
living malaria-endemic areas africa. abs play key role mediating 
immunity; however, acquisition components ab immunity, long-lived
plasma cells memory b cells (mbcs), remarkably inefficient, requiring
years malaria exposure. although long-lived classical mbcs
(cd19(+)/cd20(+)/cd21(+)/cd27(+)/cd10(-)) gradually acquired response to
natural infection, exposure p. falciparum also results large expansion of
what termed atypical mbcs (cd19(+)/cd20(+)/cd21(-)/cd27(-)/cd10(-)). at
present, function atypical mbcs malaria known, the
factors drive differentiation. gain insight relationship
between classical atypical igg(+) mbcs, compared ab h l chain v
gene repertoires children living malaria-endemic region mali. found
that repertoires remarkably similar variety criteria,
including v gene usage, rate somatic hypermutation, cdr-h3 length and
composition. similarity repertoires suggests classical mbcs and
atypical mbcs differentiate response similar ag-dependent selective
pressures malaria-exposed children atypical mbcs express a
unique v gene repertoire.
