the immunomodulator as101 previously shown confer protection upon
balb/c mice infected intraerythrocytic parasite babesia rodhaini (b.
rodhaini). present study focuses effect as101 administration the
acute phase babesial infection helper cell subset
patterns-th1/th2-were assessed heavily infected mice. secretion cytokines
of th1 subset (il-2, ifn-gamma, il-12) th2 subset (il-10, il-4) as
well tgf-beta measured following administration as101 2 weeks
before parasite infection. results demonstrate parasites suppress
il-2 protein il-12 mrna as101 upregulates secretion: il-2, 8
u/ml vs 34 u/ml, respectively; ifn-gamma protein, 2370 pg/ml vs 4777 pg/ml,
respectively. conversely, babesial infection results upregulation il-10
and il-4 proteins tgf-beta transcripts, whereas as101 downregulates their
production: il-10, 1800 pg/ml vs 360 pg/ml, respectively; il-4, 58.3 pg/ml vs
24.5 pg/ml, respectively. possible escape mechanism induced b. rodhaini is
suggested, starting il-10 inhibition macrophage activities leading a
suppression th1 response il-2 particular. therefore
possible as101 may protect infected mice activating cellular-mediated
immunity concurrently balancing th subset responses. suggested that
as101 may effective antiparasitic drug.
