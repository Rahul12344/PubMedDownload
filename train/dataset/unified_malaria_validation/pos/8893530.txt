theileria annulata infects reversibly transforms bovine leucocytes. the
parasite-transformed cells immortalized, metastatic express number of
metalloproteinases including matrix metalloproteinase 9 secrete. all
the metalloproteinases observed substrate gels inhibited tissue
inhibitor metalloproteinase 1 4 synthetic inhibitors bb94, gm6001,
brl29808ai ro31-4724. adapted vitro assay metastatic
behaviour measures ability parasitized cells cross reconstituted
basement membrane, matrigel. using demonstrated that
macroschizont-infected cells invasive vitro invasive
properties almost eliminated specific inhibitors of
metalloproteinases used substrate gels. demonstrates the
metastatic behaviour infected cells due part metalloproteinase
activity strongly suggests role metalloproteinases observed on
gels. supported fact attenuated vaccine line which
shows much reduced metalloproteinase activity also exhibits marked reduction in
metastatic behaviour. suggest metalloproteinases virulence
factors mediating pathological features disease loss the
vaccine line could provide explanation attenuation.
