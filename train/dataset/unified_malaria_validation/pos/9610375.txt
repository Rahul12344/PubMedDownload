bovine t-cells infected protozoan parasite theileria parva undergo
lymphoblastoid transformation, proliferate uncontrolled manner. while
it established transcription factor nf-kappa b is
constitutively activated t. parva-infected t-cells, little known about
other transcription factors ap-1 atf-2. demonstrated increased
binding activity ap-1 creb/atf-2 consensus binding sites show that
the ap-1 complex composed c-jun, jund, c-fos, atf-2. transcription 
factors c-jun atf-2 constitutively phosphorylated parasite-dependent
manner. transcription factors phosphorylated jun-nh2-terminal
kinase (jnk), atf-2 also substrate p38. determined whether p38 is
activated t. parva-infected cells. immunoblot analysis inhibitor studies
indicate jnk, p38, involved atf-2 phosphorylation. based on
these results previous studies, conclude parasite interference with
mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways restricted constitutive
activation jnk.
