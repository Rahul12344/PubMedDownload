apicomplexan parasites, including plasmodium falciparum toxoplasma gondii
(the causative agents malaria toxoplasmosis, respectively), are
responsible considerable morbidity mortality worldwide. pathogenic 
protozoa replicate within intracellular vacuole inside infected host cells,
from must escape initiate new lytic cycle. integrating cell
biological, pharmacological, genetic approaches, provide evidence that
both plasmodium toxoplasma hijack host cell calpain proteases facilitate
parasite egress. immunodepletion inhibition calpain-1 hypotonically
lysed resealed erythrocytes prevented escape p. falciparum parasites, 
which restored adding purified calpain-1. similarly, efficient egress of
t. gondii mammalian fibroblasts blocked either small interfering
rna-mediated suppression genetic deletion calpain activity could be
restored genetic complementation.
