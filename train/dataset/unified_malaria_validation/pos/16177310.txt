it currently accepted malaria-parasitized red blood cells (prbc) are
eliminated, like senescent erythrocytes, phagocytically macrophages red
pulp spleen. here, however, show self-healing plasmodium chabaudi 
malaria activates spleen closure c57bl/6 mice. confocal laser scanning
microscopy revealed spleen closing manifested elimination entry
into red pulp 3-microm polystyrol particles, prbc, nonparasitized red 
blood cells bovine serum albumin. spleen closure reflect 
a reduction number phagocytic cells, shown flow cytometry,
whereas marginal zone macrophages (mzm) lost red pulp macrophages
entered white pulp. splenic trapping pbrc strongly reduced the
absence mzm marginal metallophilic macrophages (mmm), in
noninfected mice disrupted lymphotoxin beta receptor (ltbetar(-/-)), and
it still significantly reduced number mzm mmm diminished,
as tumor necrosis factor alpha-deficient (tnf-alpha(-/-)) mice. moreover, mice
deficient tnf-alpha, tumor necrosis factor receptor (tnfri(-/-)), and
ltbetar exhibited progressive impairment malaria-induced spleen closing.
treatment c57bl/6 mice tnf-alpha induced loss mzm spleen closing
by 20%. data indicate tnf/tnfri signaling involved in
regulating malaria-induced spleen closure, maximal crisis, when
parasitemia declines 100-fold. consequently, vast majority prbc 
cannot destroyed spleen crisis, suggesting known
sophisticated sequestration system plasmodium parasites evolve to
avoid splenic clearance.
