toll-like receptors (tlrs) recognize malaria parasites metabolites;
however, physiological roles malaria infection vivo fully
understood. here, show myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88
(myd88)-dependent tlr signaling mediates brain pathogenesis severe malaria
infection, namely cerebral malaria (cm). significant number myd88-, 
tir domain containing adaptor-inducing ifn-beta (trif)-deficient wild-type
(wt) mice survived cm caused plasmodium berghei anka (pba) infection. although
systemic parasitemia comparable, sequestration parasite hemozoin load 
in brain blood vessels significantly lower myd88-deficient mice
compared trif-deficient wt mice. moreover, brain-specific
pathological changes associated myd88-dependent infiltration cd8+,
ccr5+ cells cd11c+ dendritic cells, including cd11c+, nk1.1+ b220+
cells, up-regulation genes granzyme b, lipocalin 2, ccl3 ccr5.
further studies using mice lacking various tlrs suggest tlr2 tlr9, but
not tlr4, 5 7, involved cm. results strongly suggest tlr2-
and/or tlr9-mediated, myd88-dependent brain pathogenesis may play critical role
in cm, lethal complication pba infection.
