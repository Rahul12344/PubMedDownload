babesiosis caused intraerythrocytic protozoan parasites transmitted by
ticks affects wide range domestic wild animals occasionally
humans. current study aimed investigate effect b. divergens
infected erythrocytes spleen histopathology, cell cycle alteration, the
presence oxidative stress. mongolian gerbils challenged with
5 × 10(6)  babesia divergens infected erythrocytes. parasitemia reached
approximately 77% day 5 postinfection. infection also induced injury the
spleen. evidenced (i) increases cellular damage spleen,
(ii) decrease antioxidant capacity indicated decreased glutathione,
catalase, superoxide dismutase levels, (iii) increased production of
malondialdehyde nitric oxide derived products (nitrite/nitrate), (iv)
increased lactic acid dehydrogenase activity protein carbonyl content 
spleen. infection interfered normal cell cycle spleen cells g0/g1,
s, g2/m phases. basis results hypothesized that
b. divergens infected erythrocytes could alter spleen histopathology and
cause cell cycle alteration induce oxidative stress splenic tissue.
