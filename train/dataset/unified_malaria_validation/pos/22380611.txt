background: innate immunity plays crucial role host defense against
malaria including plasmodium falciparum malaria pregnancy, roles of
the various underlying genes mechanisms predisposing disease are
poorly understood.
methods: 98 single-nucletoide polymorphisms genotyped set 17
functionally related genes complement system 145 primiparous ghanaian
women placental malaria, defined placental parasitaemia malaria
pigment, control, 124 non-affected primiparae.
results: placental malaria significantly associated snps lectin
pathway genes mbl2, masp2, fcn2 properdin. particular, main african
mannose-binding lectin deficiency variant (mbl2*g57e, rs1800451) increased the
odds placental malaria (or 1.6; permuted p-value 0.014). contrast, common
masp2 mutation (r439h, rs12085877), reduces activity mbl-masp2
complexes occurred 33% non-affected women 22% primiparae with
placental malaria (or 0.55, permuted p-value 0.020).
conclusions: excessive complement activation importance pathogenesis
of placental malaria mediating inflammation, coagulation, endothelial
dysfunction. mutated mbl masp2 proteins could direct intrinsic effects
on susceptibility placental malaria, addition roles in
regulation downstream complement activation.
