the y. enterocolitica serogroup o8 virulence plasmid. resulting mutant strain
escaped polyubiquitination degradation yope displayed increased
intracellular yope levels, accompanied pronounced cytotoxic effect
on infected cells. despite intensified activity cultured cells, the
yersinia mutant stabilized yope showed reduced dissemination liver
