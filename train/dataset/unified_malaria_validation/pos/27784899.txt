the pathogenesis plasmodium falciparum malaria involves complex interplay
between parasite adhesion inflammatory response includes release of
cytokines activation endothelium accompanying release of
angiopoitin 2 (ang2) plasma. a-disintegrin metalloproteinase 17
(adam17) protein responsible releasing cytokines, including tumor
necrosis factor α (tnfα), shedding adhesion proteins. study, we
show plasma levels adam17 increased tanzanian children
hospitalized malaria infection compared asymptomatic children but
similar children hospitalized infectious diseases. plasma
levels adam17 decreased recovery acute malaria episode. plasma
levels ang2 associated markers malaria severity levels var
transcripts encoding p. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1)
containing cysteine rich inter domain region α1 (cidrα1) domains predicted to
bind endothelial protein c receptor (epcr). adam17 levels associated
with expression var genes encoding different pfemp1 types controlling for
age. data first report adam17 plasma levels malaria-exposed
individuals, support notion parasite sequestration mediated by
epcr-binding pfemp1 associated endothelial activation pathology in
severe paediatric malaria.
