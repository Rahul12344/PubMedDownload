theileria orientalis infects cattle causes various disease symptoms,
including anaemia icterus. erythrocytic stages responsible 
symptoms molecular events involved stages yet been
fully elucidated. study, identified t. orientalis cdna encodes 
a polypeptide related identity microneme-rhoptry protein theileria
parva. analysis recombinant product (tomrp) indirect
fluorescent-antibody test revealed specifically expressed early
erythrocytic stage invasion. expression disappears the
intermediate stages intra-erythrocytic development. expression then
reappears late stages parasite divided binary fission
into diad tetrad forms forms released host
erythrocyte. vitro erythrocyte binding assays showed tomrp associates
with triton x-insoluble fraction erythrocytes membrane intact
erythrocytes. cosedimentation western blot analyses revealed tomrp binds
to band 3, membrane component bovine erythrocytes. observations
suggest tomrp may involved parasite's egress and/or invasion 
into host erythrocytes interacting protein membrane skeleton
of erythrocyte thereby modifying structure function cell.
