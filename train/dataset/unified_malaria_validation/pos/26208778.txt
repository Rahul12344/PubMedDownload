plasmodium parasites transmitted anopheles mosquitoes mammalian
host actively infect hepatocytes passive transport bloodstream
to liver. target host hepatocyte, parasites reside within a
parasitophorous vacuole (pv). present study shown the
parasitophorous vacuole membrane (pvm) targeted autophagy marker
proteins lc3, ubiquitin, sqstm1/p62 well lysosomes process
resembling selective autophagy. dynamics autophagy marker proteins in
individual plasmodium berghei-infected hepatocytes followed live imaging 
throughout entire development parasite liver. although host
cell efficiently recognized invading parasite vacuole, the
majority parasites survived initial attack. successful parasite
development correlated gradual loss analyzed autophagy marker
proteins associated lysosomes pvm. however, autophagic events 
like nonselective canonical autophagy host cell continued. was
indicated lc3, although labeling pvm anymore, still localized to
autophagosomes infected host cell. appears growing parasites even 
benefit form nonselective host cell autophagy additional
source nutrients, host cells deficient autophagy, parasite growth
was retarded could partly rescued supply additional amino acid
in medium. importantly, mouse infections p. berghei sporozoites
confirmed lc3 dynamics, positive effect autophagy activation parasite
growth, negative effects upon autophagy inhibition.
