physiologically brain, cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(tnalpha) released immune system modulate neurological
responses. conversely, central nervous system (cns) also able modulate 
cytokine production. case cns disorders, cytokine release may be
modified. cerebral malaria (cm) complication plasmodium falciparum
infection humans characterized reversible encephalopathy with
seizures loss consciousness. central clinical signs partly due to
sequestration parasitized red blood cells brain microvasculature due to
interactions parasite proteins adhesion molecules. tnfalpha is
produced released host cells following exposure various malarial
antigens. increase tnfalpha release responsible overexpression 
of adhesion molecules. article reviews involvement tnfalpha in
cerebral malaria relation processes involved this
pathology. shows (i). tnfalpha levels increased plasma brain
but clear correlation tnfalpha levels occurrence severity
of cm; (ii). tnfalpha responsible intercellular adhesion molecule-1
upregulation cm, relation less clear adhesion molecules;
(iii). tnfalpha receptors upregulated cm, tnf receptor 2 (tnfr2)
showing higher upregulation tnfr1 vivo; (iv). murine cm, low doses
of tnfalpha seem protect cm, whereas excess tnfalpha induces cm and
anti-tnfalpha therapies (antibodies, pentoxifylline) show efficiency 
in protection cm. moreover, involvement lymphotoxin a, shares
with tnfalpha receptors similar affinity, appears an
interesting target investigation.
