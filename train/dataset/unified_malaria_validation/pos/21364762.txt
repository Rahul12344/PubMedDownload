background: severe malaria leading cause childhood mortality africa.
however, presentation, difficult predict children severe
malaria greatest risk death. dysregulated host inflammatory responses
and endothelial activation play central roles severe malaria pathogenesis. 
hypothesized biomarkers processes would accurately predict outcome 
among children severe malaria.
methodology/findings: plasma obtained children uncomplicated
malaria (n = 53), cerebral malaria (n = 44) severe malarial anemia (n = 59)
at time presentation hospital kampala, uganda. levels angiopoietin-2,
von willebrand factor (vwf), vwf propeptide, soluble p-selectin, soluble
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1), soluble endoglin, soluble fms-like
tyrosine kinase-1 (flt-1), soluble tie-2, c-reactive protein, procalcitonin, 10
kda interferon gamma-induced protein (ip-10), soluble triggering receptor
expressed myeloid cells-1 (trem-1) determined elisa. receiver
operating characteristic (roc) curve analysis used assess predictive
accuracy individual biomarkers. six biomarkers (angiopoietin-2, soluble
icam-1, soluble flt-1, procalcitonin, ip-10, soluble trem-1) discriminated well
between children survived severe malaria infection subsequently
died (area roc curve>0.7). combinational approaches applied an
attempt improve accuracy. biomarker score developed based on
dichotomization summation six biomarkers, resulting 95.7% (95% ci: 
78.1-99.9) sensitivity 88.8% (79.7-94.7) specificity predicting death.
similar predictive accuracy achieved models comprised 3 biomarkers.
classification tree analysis generated 3-marker model 100% sensitivity and
92.5% specificity (cross-validated misclassification rate: 15.4%, standard error 
4.9%).
conclusions: identified novel host biomarkers pediatric severe fatal
malaria (soluble trem-1 soluble flt-1) generated simple biomarker
combinations accurately predicted death african pediatric population. 
while requiring validation studies, results suggest utility 
of combinatorial biomarker strategies prognostic tests severe malaria.
