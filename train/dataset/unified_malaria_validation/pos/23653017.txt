cerebral malaria (cm) serious often fatal complication plasmodium
falciparum infections; however, precise mechanisms leading cm poorly
understood. mouse malaria models provided insight key events in
pathogenesis cm. t-cell immune response known play important role 
malaria infection, members t-cell immunoglobulin- and
mucin-domain-containing molecule (tim) family roles t-cell-mediated
immune responses. tim-1 tim-3 expressed terminally differentiated th2 
and th1 cells, respectively, participate regulation th immune
response. now, role tim family proteins plasmodium infection
remains unclear. present study, mrna levels tim-1, tim-3, 
key th1 th2 cytokines spleen kunming outbred mice infected with
plasmodium berghei anka (pbanka) determined using real-time polymerase chain
reaction (qrt-pcr). compared uninfected controls, tim-1 expression was
significantly decreased infected mice cm day 10 postinfection (p.i.)
but significantly increased infected mice non-cm day 22 p.i.; in
contrast, tim-3 expression significantly increased infected mice with
cm day 10 p.i. non-cm day 22 p.i. expressions ifn-γ, tnf-α,
il-10, il-12 significantly increased il-4 significantly
decreased infected mice cm days 10 p.i., whereas expressions of
ifn-γ, tnf-α, il-4, il-10, tgf-β significantly increased il-12 was
significantly decreased infected mice non-cm days 22 p.i. furthermore,
the expression tim-1 tim-3 could reflect th2 th1 immune response in
the spleen pbanka-infected mice, respectively. data suggest pbanka
infection could inhibit differentiation lymphocytes toward th2 cells,
promote th1 cell differentiation, induce th1-biased immune response in
the early infective stage, whereas infection could promote th2 cell
differentiation induce th2-biased immune response late infective
stage. data indicate tim-1 tim-3 may play role process
of pbanka infection, may represent potential therapeutic target.
