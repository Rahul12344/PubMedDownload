theileria annulata infects predominantly macrophages, lesser extent b
cells, causes widespread disease cattle called tropical theileriosis.
disease-causing infected macrophages aggressively invasive, this
virulence trait attenuated long-term culture. attenuated macrophages
are used live vaccines tropical theileriosis via their
characterization one gains insights host cell trait altered
concomitant loss virulence. established sporozoite infection of
monocytes rapidly induces hif1-α transcription constitutive induction of
hif-1α transformed leukocytes parasite-dependent. infected
macrophages b cells induction hif-1α activates transcription target
genes drive host cells perform warburg-like glycolysis. propose that
theileria-infected leukocytes maintain hif-1α-driven transcriptional programme 
typical warburg glycolysis order reduce much possible host cell h2
o2 type oxidative stress. however, attenuated macrophages h2o2 production
increases hif-1α levels consequently remained high, even though adhesion 
aggressive invasiveness diminished. indicates theileria infection
generates host leukocytes hypoxic response properly controlled
leads loss virulence.
