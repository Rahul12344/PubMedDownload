cerebral malaria (cm) neurological complication infection plasmodium
falciparum partly caused cytokine-mediated inflammation. not
known whether interleukin-17 (il-17) cytokines, regulate inflammation,
control development cm. evaluate involvement il-17 cytokines 
cm, analyzed 46 common polymorphisms il17a, il17f, il17ra (which
encodes common receptor chain members il-17 family) two
independent african populations. case-control study involving 115 nigerian
children cm 160 controls community (cc) showed il17f
reference single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) 6913472 (rs6913472) (p = 0.004;
odds ratio [or] = 3.12), il17f rs4715291 (p = 0.004; = 2.82), il17ra
rs12159217 (p = 0.01; = 2.27), il17ra rs41396547 (p = 0.026; = 3.15)
were independently associated cm. replication study performed 240
nuclear malian family trios (two parents one cm child). replicated the
association 3 snps, il17f rs6913472 (p = 0.03; = 1.39), il17ra rs12159217 
(p = 0.01; = 1.52), il17ra rs41396547 (p = 0.04; = 3.50). also found
that one additional snp, il17ra rs41433045, linkage disequilibrium (ld) with
rs41396547, associated cm nigeria mali (p = 0.002; = 4.12
in combined sample). excluded possibility snps outside il17f 
il17ra, strong ld associated snps, could account observed
associations. furthermore, results functional study indicated the
aggravating ga genotype il17f rs6913472 associated lower il-17f
concentrations. findings show first time il17f il17ra
polymorphisms modulate susceptibility cm provide evidence il-17f
protects cm.
