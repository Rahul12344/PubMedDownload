background: activation innate immune responses plasmodium vivax results
in activation effector cells excessive production pro-inflammatory
cytokines may culminate deleterious effects. here, examined the
activation function neutrophils acute episodes malaria.
materials methods: blood samples collected p. vivax-infected
patients admission (day 0) 30-45 days treatment chloroquine and
primaquine. expression activation markers cytokine levels produced by
highly purified monocytes neutrophils measured cytometric bead
assay. phagocytic activity, superoxide production, chemotaxis presence of
g protein-coupled receptor (grk2) also evaluated neutrophils malaria
patients.
principal findings: monocytes neutrophils p. vivax-infected
patients highly activated. monocytes found main source 
of cytokines response tlr ligands, neutrophils showed enhanced phagocytic
activity superoxide production. interestingly, neutrophils malaria
patients expressed high levels grk2, low levels cxcr2, displayed
impaired chemotaxis towards il-8 (cxcl8).
conclusion: activated neutrophils malaria patients poor source of
pro-inflammatory cytokines display reduced chemotactic activity, suggesting a
possible mechanism enhanced susceptibility secondary bacterial
infection malaria.
