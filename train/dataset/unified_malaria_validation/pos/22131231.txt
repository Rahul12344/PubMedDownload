plasmodium falciparum glycosylphosphatidylinositols (gpis) proposed 
malaria pathogenic factors based ability induce proinflammatory
responses macrophages malaria-like symptoms mice. parasite gpis induce 
the production inflammatory cytokines activating mitogen-activated
protein kinase (mapk) nf-κb signaling pathways. importantly, inhibition of
the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (erk) pathway upregulates subset of
cytokines, including il-12. investigated role nuclear transcription
factor, iκb-ζ, gpi-induced dysregulated expression il-12 inhibition 
of erk pathway. gpis efficiently induced expression iκb-ζ in
macrophages regardless whether cells pretreated untreated erk
inhibitors, indicating erk role iκb-ζ expression. however, erk 
inhibition followed stimulation gpis, nf-κb binding il12b promoter κb 
site markedly increased, suggesting erk pathway regulates il12b
transcription. knockdown iκb-ζ using sirna markedly reduced gpi-induced
il-12 production abrogated dysregulated il-12 production erk inhibited
cells. together results demonstrate erk modulates il-12 expression 
regulating iκb-ζ-dependent binding nf-κb transcription factors il12b gene
promoter. additionally, finding iκb-ζ knocked efficiently in
primary macrophages valuable studies aimed gaining insights
into iκb-ζ function.
