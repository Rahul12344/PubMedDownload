the plasma concentration soluble p-selectin (gmp-140/cd62p/padgem), selectin
produced activated platelets endothelial cells, quantitated group
of adults east african negro children presenting either non-severe or
severe (cerebral) malaria caused plasmodium falciparum. sixty percent of
adults non-severe malaria immunoreactive levels p-selectin 200 
ng/ml (the maximum recorded normal healthy adult assay) 86% of
all african children malaria concentrations normal irrespective of
their clinical categorization, exceeded maximum limits assay 
(> 640 ng/ml). correlation p-selectin levels and
parasitemia. results raise possibility elevated soluble p-selectin
in malaria may important beneficial anti-inflammatory function.
