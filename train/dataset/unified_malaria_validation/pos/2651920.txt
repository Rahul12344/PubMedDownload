the infection human erythrocytes two strains human malarial
parasite, plasmodium falciparum (fcq-27 multi-drug-resistant strain k-1), 
markedly changed transport characteristics nucleosides, adenosine 
tubercidin, compared uninfected erythrocytes. component transport 
these nucleosides insensitive classical mammalian nucleoside transport
inhibitor nitrobenzylthioinosine (nbmpr). vitro studies tubercidin
demonstrated id50 values 0.43 0.51 microm fcq-27 k-1,
respectively. addition, nucleoside transport inhibitors nbmpr,
nitrobenzylthioguanosine (nbtgr), dilazep dipyridamole also independently
exhibited antimalarial activity vitro. combination tubercidin nbmpr
or nbtgr vitro demonstrated synergistic activity, whilst tubercidin together
with dilazep dipyridamole showed subadditive activity. analysis hplc
indicated nbmpr could permeate infected cell membrane provided
evidence catabolism nbmpr vitro, subsequent alteration 
purine pool infected erythrocyte. observations indicated the
possibility utilization cytotoxic nucleosides p. falciparum
infection conjunction nucleoside transport inhibitor protect the
