background: volume substitution remains subject controversy light of
effusions oedema potentially complicating highly febrile disease.
understanding role myocardial circulatory function appears be
essential clinical management. present study, cardiac function and
cardiac proteins assessed correlated parasitological and
immunologic parameters patients imported plasmodium falciparum malaria.
methods: prospective case-control study, 28 patients uncomplicated 
complicated p. falciparum malaria included findings compared with
26 healthy controls. cardiac function parameters assessed innovative
non-invasive method based re-breathing technique. addition, cardiac
enzymes pro- anti-inflammatory cytokines measured assessed 
respect clinical symptoms conditions malaria.
results: cardiac index (ci) measurement cardiac output (co) 21% lower
in malaria patients healthy controls (2.7 l/min/m2 versus 3.4 l/min/m2; p
< 0.001). contrast, systemic vascular resistance index (svri) increased by
29% (32.6 mmhg⋅m2/(l/min) versus 23.2 mmhg⋅m2/(l/min); p < 0.001). this
correlated increased cardiac proteins patients versus controls: pro-bnp
139.3 pg/ml versus 60.4 pg/ml (p = 0.03), myoglobin 43.6 μg/l versus 27.8 μg/l (p
= < 0.001). measured cytokines significantly increased patients 
malaria. ci, svri well cytokine levels correlate blood
parasite density.
conclusions: results support previous reports suggesting impaired cardiac
function contributing clinical manifestations p. falciparum malaria.
findings may relevant fluid management explored in
endemic regions.
