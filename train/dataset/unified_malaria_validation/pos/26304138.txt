babesia rossi cause highly virulent multisystemic disease a
variable outcome, reliable model systemic inflammatory response
syndrome (sirs). objective study determine concentration
of canine pancreatic-specific lipase (cpl) population dogs naturally
acquired b. rossi infection. addition, associations serum cpl 
death sirs status examined. observational study recruited 87 dogs
diagnosed b. rossi infection serum cpl concentrations measured
daily discharge death. median concentration serum cpl 124.0
µg/l (interquartile range: 51.0 µg/l - 475.5 µg/l) admission (n = 87) and
145.5 µg/l (62.3 µg/l - 434.0 µg/l) day two hospitalisation (n = 40).
twenty-four dogs (28%) serum cpl concentration within diagnostic range 
for pancreatitis (&gt; 400 µg/l) admission 13 dogs (32.5%) presenting 
such second day hospitalisation. median concentration serum cpl 
in dogs sirs 158 µg/l (interquartile range: 52.5 µg/l - 571.5 µg/l; n = 
53), significantly higher without sirs (75 µg/l; 50.3
µg/l - 131.8 µg/l; n = 32) (p = 0.018). study demonstrated an
unexpectedly high number dogs diagnosed naturally acquired canine
babesiosis serum cpl concentration within diagnostic range acute
pancreatitis significantly higher serum cpl concentration found dogs
that classified sirs.
