hemozoin (hz) crystalline detoxification product hemoglobin in
plasmodium-infected erythrocytes. previously proposed hz carry
plasmodial dna subcellular compartment accessible toll-like
receptor 9 (tlr9), inducing inflammatory signal. hz also activates nlrp3
inflammasome primed cells. found hz appears colocalize dna 
infected erythrocytes, even rbc rupture phagolysosomal digestion. using
synthetic hz coated in vitro plasmodial genomic dna (gdna) cpg
oligodeoxynucleotides, observed dna-complexed hz induced tlr9
translocation, providing priming activation signal inflammasomes.
after phagocytosis, hz dna dissociate. hz subsequently induces phagolysosomal
destabilization, allowing phagolysosomal contents access cytosol, where
dna receptors become activated. similar observations made with
plasmodium-infected rbcs. finally, infected erythrocytes activated nlrp3
and aim2 inflammasomes. observations suggest hz dna work together 
to induce systemic inflammation malaria.
