embryonic stem cells pluripotent capable unlimited self-renewal.
elucidation underlying molecular mechanism may contribute the
advancement cell-based regenerative medicine. present work, we
performed large scale analysis phosphoproteome mouse embryonic stem
(mes) cells. using multiplex strategies, detected 4581 proteins 3970 high 
confidence distinct phosphosites 1642 phosphoproteins. notably, 22 prominent
phosphorylated stem cell marker proteins 39 novel phosphosites were
identified first time mass spectrometry, including phosphorylation
sites nanog (ser-65) re1 silencing transcription factor (ser-950 and
thr-953). quantitative profiles nanog peptides obtained the
differentiation mes cells revealed abundance phosphopeptides and
non-phosphopeptides decreased different trends. knowledge, study
presents largest global characterization phosphorylation mes cells.
compared study ultimately differentiated tissue cells, bioinformatics
analysis phosphorylation data set revealed consistent phosphorylation
motif human mouse es cells. moreover, investigations phosphorylation 
conservation suggested phosphoproteins conserved the
undifferentiated es cell state ultimately differentiated tissue cell 
state. however, opposite conclusion drawn conservation
comparison phosphosites. overall, work provides overview of
phosphorylation mes cells valuable resource future
understanding basic biology mes cells.
