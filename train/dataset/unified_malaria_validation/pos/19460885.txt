malaria pregnancy forms substantial part worldwide burden malaria,
with estimated annual death toll 200 000 infants, well as
increased maternal morbidity mortality. studies genetic susceptibility 
malaria far focused infant malaria, studies
investigating genetic basis placental malaria, focusing limited 
number candidate genes. aim study therefore identify novel 
host genetic factors involved placental malaria infection. end we
carried nested case-control study 180 mozambican pregnant women with
placental malaria infection, 180 controls within intervention trial of
malaria prevention. genotyped 880 snps set 64 functionally related
genes involved glycosylation innate immunity. single nucleotide
polymorphism (snp) located gene fut9, rs3811070, significantly
associated placental malaria infection (odds ratio = 2.31, permutation
p-value=0.028). haplotypic analysis revealed similarly strong association 
common haplotype four snps including rs3811070. fut9 codes a
fucosyl-transferase catalyzing last step biosynthesis the
lewis-x antigen, forms part lewis blood group-related antigens.
these results therefore suggest involvement antigen the
pathogenesis placental malaria infection.
