because microvascular damage common feature cerebral malaria, have
examined role eicosanoid metabolites (prostaglandins leukotrienes) in
experimental cerebral malaria. eighty icr mice infected plasmodium
berghei anka, 40 uninfected mice controls. half infected mice were
treated days 4 5 aspirin, prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor.
infected mice started die cerebral malaria day 6, day 17, all
infected mice died. contrast, infected mice treated aspirin died by
day 12. infected mice increased phospholipase a2 mrna expression the
spleen cyclooxygenase 1 (cox1) cox2 expression brain. peak 
of cerebral malaria, infected mice higher serum leukotriene b4 levels than
control mice, aspirin-treated infected mice higher serum leukotriene b4
levels untreated infected mice. results suggest prostaglandins
are protective whereas leukotrienes detrimental cerebral malaria.
