malaria still remains major public health problem mali, although disease
susceptibility varies ethnic groups, particularly fulani 
dogon. two sympatric groups share similar socio-cultural factors and
malaria transmission rates, fulani individuals tend show significantly
higher spleen enlargement scores, lower parasite prevalence, seem less
affected disease dogon neighbours. used genetic
polymorphisms malaria-associated genes investigate associations with
various malaria metrics fulanai dogon groups. two cross sectional
surveys (transmission season 2006, dry season 2007) performed. healthy
volunteers ethnic groups (n=939) recruited rural setting.
in survey, clinical (spleen enlargement, axillary temperature, weight) and
parasitological data (malaria parasite densities species) collected, 
well blood samples. one hundred sixty six snps genotyped 5
immunoassays (ama1, csp, msp1, msp2, total ige) performed dna and
serum samples respectively. data confirm reduced malaria susceptibility
in fulani, higher level protective o-blood group, increased
circulating antibody levels several malaria antigens (p<10(-15)). we
identified snp allele frequency differences 2 ethnic groups cd36, 
il4, rtn3 adcy9. moreover, polymorphisms fcer1a, rad50, tnf, slc22a4, 
il13 genes correlated antibody production (p-value<0.003). work
is required understand mechanisms underpinning genetic factors.
