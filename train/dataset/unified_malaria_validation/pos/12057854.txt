the mechanisms malaria parasite clearance host well understood,
but ascribed intact spleen, site parasite clearance. the
infection induces huge increase spleen volume cellularity. is,
however, lack studies splenic production chemokines, are
small proteins control homing activation immune cells must be
crucial organized tissue growth. studied spleen cell production of
sdf-1, primordial chemokine cxcl12 class, mrna reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction isoforms, alpha beta, 
lethal (plasmodium berghei anka) non-lethal recrudescent malaria (plasmodium 
chabaudi cr) balb/c c57bl/6 mouse strains. non-lethal p. chabaudi
malaria c57bl/6 mice, sdf-1alpha mrna production clearly peaked the
control parasitemia, fact observed mouse strain infected
with lethal p. berghei, production lower without peaks. the
infection balb/c mice infected plasmodium species led a
similar evolution parasitemia also chemokine production, albeit lower
levels. sdf-1beta synthesis constant regular infections,
presenting variation usually occurring experimental times.
supplementation lethal models sdf-1alpha i.p., time when
endogenous stromal cell chemokine production peaked non-lethal models, induced
a clear reduction parasitemia, probably prolonged host survival. blocking
sdf-1 action administration t-140, cxcr4 receptor blocker, caused an
increase circulating parasites usually benign non-lethal p. chabaudi
malaria c57bl/6 mice, mainly recrudescence parasitemia. data
suggest sdf-1alpha production spleen plays important role in
rodent malaria, supplementation found partially correct defects in
the control malaria lethal models.
