human rodent erythrocytes known highly permeable glycerol.
aquaglyceroporin aquaporin (aqp)3 major glycerol channel human rat 
erythrocytes. however, aqp3 expression observed mouse
erythrocytes. report presence aquaglyceroporin, aqp9, mouse 
erythrocytes. aqp9 levels rise reticulocytes mature erythrocytes as
neonatal pups develop adult mice. mice bearing targeted disruption both
alleles encoding aqp9 erythrocytes appear morphologically normal.
compared wt cells, erythrocytes aqp9-null mice defective rapid
glycerol transport across cell membrane measured osmotic lysis,
[(14)c]glycerol uptake, stopped-flow light scattering. contrast, water 
and urea permeabilities intact. although physiological role glycerol
in normal function erythrocytes clear, plasma glycerol an
important substrate lipid biosynthesis intraerythrocytic malarial
parasites. aqp9-null mice age 4 months infected plasmodium berghei
survive longer initial phase infection compared wt mice. we
conclude aqp9 major glycerol channel mouse erythrocytes and
suggest transport pathway may contribute virulence of
intraerythrocytic stages malarial infection.
