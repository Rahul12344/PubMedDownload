the immune responses plasmodiumfalciparum malaria infections complex 
and poorly understood. published studies yet reported lymphocyte
subsets involved human liver tissue p. falciparum malaria patients. 
understand cellular-mediated immune responses liver malaria
infection, determined numbers various lymphocyte subsets tissue 
samples obtained autopsy patients died p. falciparum malaria
infection. liver tissue specimens stored department of
tropical pathology, faculty tropical medicine, mahidol university, thailand.
on basis total bilirubin (tb) levels prior death, patients divided
into 2 groups: hyperbilirubinemia [total bilirubin (tb) > =51.3
micromol/l) (n = 9)] without hyperbilirubinemia (tb < 51.3 micromol/l) 
(n = 12). normal liver specimens (n = 10) used controls. an
immunohistochemistry method used analyze types numbers of
lymphocytes (t b lymphocytes), kupffer cells, using specific antibodies
against cd3+, cd4+, cd8+, cd20+, cd68+. findings reveal numbers 
lymphocytes (cd3+ t-cells) subsets (cd4+ cd8+ t-cells) were
significantly greater portal tracts sinusoids liver tissue obtained
from p. falciparum malaria cases hyperbilirubinemia without
hyperbilirubinemia controls. cd8+ t-cells major lymphocyte subset 
the liver tissue patients severe falciparum malaria. significant
positive correlation seen numbers cd4+ cd8+ t-cells and
the liver enzyme levels among p. falciparum malaria patients. number cd68+
cells (kupffer cells) significantly greater liver sinusoids p.
falciparum malaria cases hyperbilirubinemia without
hyperbilirubinemia. findings suggest t-cells, especially cd8+ t-cells and
kupffer cells important part cellular immune response liver 
tissue p. falciparum infected patients.
