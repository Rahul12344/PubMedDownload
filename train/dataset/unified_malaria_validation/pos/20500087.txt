background: age host genetics important determinants malaria severity.
lymphotoxin-alpha (ltalpha) associated development cerebral 
malaria (cm) severe malaria (sm) syndromes. mutations genes
regulating ltalpha production contribute acute vascular diseases may
contribute malaria pathogenesis.
methods: tested association rs7291467, single-nucleotide
polymorphism (snp) ltalpha-related gene encoding galectin-2 (lgals2),
disease severity, function case-control study ethnic highland papuan 
adults children sm (n = 380) asymptomatic malaria-exposed controls
(n = 356) originating non-malaria-endemic region residing lowland
malaria-endemic area papua, indonesia.
results: lgals2 snp showed significant association susceptibility to
sm (including cm), children (odds ratio, 2.02 [95% confidence interval,
1.14-3.57]) adults. sm, c allele rs7291467 associated
with enhanced galectin-2 transcript levels. separate group tanzanian
children originating malaria-endemic region, found preservation 
major ancestral lgals2 allele association susceptibility cm.
conclusions: results suggest differences inflammatory contribution 
development sm children adults population and
potential differences individuals originating malaria-endemic and
non-malaria-endemic areas.
