complications falciparum malaria responsible one million infant
deaths annually. yet clinically protective vaccine been
developed human malaria parasites. several studies have
demonstrated inhibitory properties human sera plasmodium
falciparum, reported investigation examined protective
effects human breastmilk malaria parasite. study demonstrates
the presence significant antibody titers ring, trophozoite, schizont and
gametocyte stages p. falciparum 144 nigerian maternal milk samples also
in paired maternal infant sera. study also demonstrates significant in
vitro growth inhibition p. falciparum maternal infant sera, most
notably breastmilk samples breastmilk constituents, lactoferrin
and siga. results therefore suggest protective vivo role breastmilk 
in possible modulation malaria frequency, severity complications.
