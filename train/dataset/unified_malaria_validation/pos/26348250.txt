plasmodium falciparum (p. falciparum)-induced effects phenotype human
dendritic cells (dc) could contribute poor induction long-lasting
protective immunity malaria. dc ability present antigens naïve t
cells, thus initiating adaptive immune responses depends complex switches in
chemokine receptors, production soluble mediators expression molecules 
enabling antigen-presentation maturation. examine cellular basis of
these processes context malaria, performed detailed analysis of
early events following exposure human monocyte-derived dc natural hemozoin 
(nhz) synthetic analog heme core, β-hematin. dc exposed either 
molecule produced high levels inflammatory chemokine mcp-1, showed
continuous high expression inflammatory chemokine receptor ccr5, no
upregulation lymphoid homing receptor ccr7 cytoskeletal actin
redistribution loss podosomes. dc partially matured indicated by
increased expression major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class ii cd86 
following nhz β-hematin exposure, however lack expression of
the maturation marker cd83 following nhz β-hematin exposure. overall 
data demonstrate exposure nhz partially impairs capacity dc to
mature, effect part differential β-hematin.
