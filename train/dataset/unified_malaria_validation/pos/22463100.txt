background: toll-like receptors (tlrs) signalling reported primed the
infection human malaria parasite, plasmodium falciparum. however, little is
known regulation macrophages tlr signalling infection of
lethal non-lethal strain rodent malaria parasites.
methods: balb/c mice infected non-lethal strain plasmodium yoelii 17xnl
or lethal strain p. yoelii 17xl. peritoneal macrophages isolated study
its immune response prbc lysate, tlrs (tlr2, tlr4, tlr9) agonists, and
the expression tlrs intracellular signalling molecules also
investigated flow cytometry semi-quantitive rt-pcr.
results: reactivity peritoneal macrophages mice infected with
lethal strain p. 17xl non-lethal strain p. 17xnl enhanced prbc
lysate, tlr2, tlr4, tlr9 agonists one, three five days
post-infection. tested tlrs, tlr2 up-regulated peritoneal 
macrophages mice infected either strain. however, transcription of
intracellular signalling molecules myd88, irak-1, traf-6 significantly
up-regulated peritoneal macrophages mice infected either p. yoelii
17xl p. yoelii 17xnl one, three five days post-infection. however, 
enhanced tlrs response macrophage p. yoelii 17xnl-infected mice persisted
for much longer time p. yoelii 17xl-infected mice.
conclusion: p. yoelii 17xl 17xnl strains could enhance response of
peritoneal macrophages prbc lysate tlr agonists, up-regulating the
expression tlr2 intracellular signalling molecules myd88, irak-1, and
traf-6. addition, prolonged high response macrophage p. yoelii
17xnl-infected mice might associated efficiently controlling 
p. yoelii 17xnl growth mice early stage.
