previously, binding site plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocyte
(pe) determined c-terminal 120 140 kda region the
n-terminal 25 kda domain thrombospondin (tsp). work, localized
the tsp binding site pe precisely. pe adhered to
glutathione-s-transferase-fusion proteins containing type 3 repeat (t3) of
tsp, functional domains tsp (i.e. n-terminal domain,
procollagen domain, type 1 2 repeat, c-terminal domain). soluble t3
inhibited pe binding immobilized tsp. pe binding immobilized t3 was
inhibited soluble tsp, monoclonal antibody directed t3,
glycine-arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-serine-proline (grgdsp) peptide, and
*cysteine-grgdsp-cysteine*, *cysteine cysteine* form disulfide
linkage, suggesting involvement rgd-containing motif t3. support 
of this, fusion protein excluded rgd motif showed pe binding
activity. earlier shown amino acid sequence band 3
protein, histidine-proline-leucine-glutamine-lysine-threonine-tyrosine (hplqkty),
was exposed pe mediated pe binding tsp. monoclonal antibodies, which
recognize hplqkty inhibit pe binding tsp, also inhibited pe binding the
t3. involvement sequence confirmed fact octamer 
hplqkty-containing peptide bound t3 rgd motif-excluded
fusion protein binding t3 inhibited grgdsp peptide. thus, pe
binding t3 domain tsp mediated peptidic sequence hplqkty of
band 3 exposed pe.
