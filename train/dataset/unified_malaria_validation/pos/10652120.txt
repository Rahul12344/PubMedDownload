helper cell cytokine antibody responses investigated mice after
infection babesia microti (king strain). infection cba mice 106
parasitized erythrocytes resulted development transitory high
parasitaemia peaked 14 days post infection (dpi), resolved 24
dpi. th1 responses activated predominately acute phase (6-18 dpi)
whereas th2 responses predominated recovery phase (14-28 dpi) as
detected reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. increased
expression th1 cytokines first detected 6 dpi (il-2) 8 dpi
(ifn-gamma) peak levels reached 12 dpi. peak levels
were reached, progressively declined fell baseline levels (22 dpi).
increased expression th2 cytokines (il-4 il-10) first appeared 14 dpi, 
peaked 20 dpi th2 cytokine levels elevated till end study 
(28 dpi). levels serum ifn-gamma detected sandwich elisa correlated well 
with ifn-gamma gene expression detectable 8-18 dpi. igm b.
microti first detected serum elisa 4 dpi, peaked 10 dpi. 
levels igm subsequently declined remained positive low titre till the
end study. igg b. microti first detected 8 dpi peak levels 
were reached 24 dpi remained level end study. the
results present study show th1 cytokines predominated early
inflammatory response might involved control levels acute
parasitaemia whereas th2-associated responses, including expression il-4
and il-10 production parasite-specific igg, might functional
means reduction clearance parasite body. was
concluded effective vaccine babesia spp. designed to
induce th1 responses maintain parasitaemia unfulminating levels and
also maintain th2 responses clear parasite body.
