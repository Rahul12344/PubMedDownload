to evaluate role erythrocyte (rbc) membrane proteins invasion and
maturation plasmodium falciparum, studied, culture, abnormal rbcs
containing quantitative qualitative membrane protein defects. defects
included hereditary spherocytosis (hs) due decreases content of
spectrin [hs(sp+)], hereditary elliptocytosis (he) due protein 4.1 deficiency 
[he(4.1(0))], due spectrin alpha domain structural variant results
in increased content spectrin dimers [he(sp alpha i/65)], band 3
structural variants. parasite invasion, measured initial uptake of
[3h]hypoxanthine 18 hr inoculation merozoites, normal of
the pathologic rbcs. contrast, rbcs six hs(sp+) subjects showed marked
growth inhibition became apparent first second growth cycle.
preincubation hs(sp+) rbcs culture 3 days alter results. 
normal parasite growth observed rbcs one hs subject normal
membrane spectrin content. extent decreased parasite growth hs(sp+)
rbcs closely correlated extent rbc spectrin deficiency (r = 0.90).
homogeneous subpopulations dense hs rbcs exhibited decreased parasite growth
to extent hs whole blood. rbcs four subjects showed
marked parasite growth inhibition, extent correlated the
content spectrin dimers (r = 0.94). rbcs two unrelated subjects with
structural variants band 3 sustained normal parasite growth. decreased growth 
in pathologic rbcs result decreased atp glutathione levels 
or increased rbc hemolysis. conclude abnormal parasite growth these
rbcs consequence metabolic secondary defects. instead, we
suggest functionally structurally normal host membrane is
indispensable parasite growth development.
