purpose review: despite parenteral artesunate therapy, fatality rate of
cerebral malaria remains high. adjunctive therapy targeting underlying
pathophysiology cerebral malaria may improve clinical outcome.
endothelial activation dysfunction central process pathogenesis
of cerebral malaria. improved understanding endothelium perturbed in
cerebral malaria may yield novel strategies diagnose intervene. here, we
discuss recent findings key molecular mediators endothelial
activation/dysregulation cerebral malaria, innovative endothelial-based
experimental approaches improve detection treatment.
recent findings: biomarkers endothelial activation [e.g., angiopoietin
(ang)-1, ang-2, soluble form ang-receptor (soluble tie-2)] been
shown reliable predictors malarial disease severity mortality, and
may improve clinical triage management. moreover, may represent novel
therapeutic targets improve clinical outcome. restoring bioavailable nitric
oxide administration inhaled nitric oxide substrate, l-arginine, may
rescue endothelial function, decrease ang-2, improve disease outcome in
cerebral malaria.
summary: interventions targeting ang-tie-2 axis promote endothelial
quiescence, including agents improve endothelial nitric oxide, represent
potential adjunctive therapies cerebral malaria.
