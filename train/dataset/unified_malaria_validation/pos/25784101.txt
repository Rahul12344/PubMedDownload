beyond well-defined role eph (erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular)
receptor tyrosine kinases developmental processes, cell motility, cell
trafficking/adhesion, cancer, nothing known involvement in
liver pathologies. blood-stage rodent malaria infection found that
ephb2 transcripts proteins up-regulated liver, result likely
driven elevated surface expression immune cells including macrophages. this
was significant malaria pathogenesis ephb2(-/-) mice protected
from malaria-induced liver fibrosis despite similar liver parasite
burden compared littermate control mice. protection correlated with
a defect inflammatory potential hepatocytes ephb2(-/-) mice
resulting reduction adhesion molecules, chemokine/chemokine receptor rna 
levels, infiltration leukocytes including macrophages/kupffer cells, which
mediate liver fibrosis rodent malaria infections. observations are
recapitulated well-established carbon tetrachloride model liver
fibrosis ephb2(-/-) carbon tetrachloride-treated mice showed a
significant reduction liver fibrosis compared carbon tetrachloride-treated 
littermate mice. depletion macrophages clodronate-liposomes abrogates liver
ephb2 messenger rna protein up-regulation fibrosis malaria-infected
mice.conclusion: rodent malaria, ephb2 expression promotes
malaria-associated liver fibrosis; knowledge, data first to
implicate ephb family receptor tyrosine kinases liver fibrosis in
the pathogenesis malaria infection.
