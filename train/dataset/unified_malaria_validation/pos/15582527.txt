it proposed basis severe malarial anaemia, major cause 
morbidity mortality endemic areas, multifactorial. inappropriately low 
reticulocytosis observed malaria patients suggesting insufficient
erythropoiesis major factor. clinical studies provide conflicting data
concerning production adequate levels erythropoietin (epo) during
malaria. plasmodium chabaudi causes non-lethal infection resistant c57bl/6 
mice, lethal infection susceptible a/j mice. p. chabaudi infected
c57bl/6 a/j mice, experience varying degrees severity anaemia,
kidney epo production appropriate severity anaemia regulated 
by haematocrit level. neutralisation endogenous epo infection leads 
lethal anaemia timely administration exogenous epo rescues mice although
reticulocytosis suppressed proportion parasitemia level.
characterisation alterations splenic erythroid compartments naive p.
chabaudi infected a/j mice revealed infection, without epo
treatment, leads sub-optimal increases ter119+ erythroblasts compared to
epo-treated naive mice. lower percentage ter119+ erythroblasts infected
mice undergo terminal differentiation become mature haemoglobin-producing
cells. furthermore, shift transferrin receptor (cd71) expression
from ter119+ cells non-erythroid population. deficiencies number 
maturation ter119+ erythroblasts infection coincide blunted
proliferation epo stimulation vitro splenocytes, although high
frequency express epo receptor (epor). together, data suggest during
malaria, epo-induced proliferation early epor+ erythroid progenitors is
suppressed, leading sub-optimal generation ter119+ erythroblasts. moreover,
a shift cd71 expression may result impaired terminal maturation of
erythroblasts. thus, suppressed proliferation, differentiation, maturation of
erythroid precursors association inadequate reticulocytosis may the
basis insufficient erythropoiesis malaria.
