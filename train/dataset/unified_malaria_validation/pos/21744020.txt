over past decade, advances proteomic mass spectrometry techniques 
the sequencing plasmodium falciparum genome led increasing
number studies regarding parasite proteome. however, studies have
focused principally parasite protein expression, neglecting parasite-induced
variations host proteome. here, investigated p. falciparum-induced
modifications infected red blood cell (irbc) membrane proteome, taking
into account host parasite proteome alterations. furthermore, also
determined protein changes associated genotypically distinct p.
falciparum strains. comparison host membrane proteomes irbcs and
uninfected red blood cells using fluorescence-based proteomic approaches, as
2d difference gel electrophoresis revealed 100 protein spots 
highly up-represented (fold change increase greater five) following p.
falciparum infection strains (i.e. rp8 institut pasteur pregnancy
associated malaria). majority spots identified mass spectrometry
corresponded homo sapiens proteins. however, infection-induced changes host
proteins appear affect molecules located outer surface the
plasma membrane. under-representation parasite proteins could be
attributed deficient parasite protein expression. thus, study describes
for first time considerable host protein modifications detected
following p. falciparum infection erythrocyte membrane level. further
analysis infection-induced host protein modifications improve our
knowledge malaria pathogenesis.
