malaria pigment hemozoin reported activate innate immunity by
toll-like receptor (tlr)-9 engagement. however, role tlr activation for
the development cerebral malaria (cm), lethal complication malaria
infection humans, unknown. using plasmodium berghei anka (pba) infection in
mice model cm, report tlr9-deficient mice protected 
from cm. exclude role members tlr family pba
recognition, infected mice deficient single tlr1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -7, or
-9 adapter proteins myd88, tirap, trif. contrast lymphotoxin 
alpha-deficient mice, resistant cm, tlr-deficient mice as
sensitive fatal cm development wild-type control mice developed typical
microvascular damage vascular leak hemorrhage brain lung,
together comparable parasitemia, thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia, and
lymphopenia. conclusion, present data exclude possibility 
malarial molecular motifs may activate innate immune system. however,
tlr-dependent activation innate immunity unlikely contribute
significantly proinflammatory response pba infection the
development fatal cm.
