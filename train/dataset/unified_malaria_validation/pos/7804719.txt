blood schisontocidal test d0 + d3 type revealed different characteristics of
the plasmodium berghei plasmodium vinckei infection. types rodent
plasmodia kill untreated mice. chloroquine treatment alone prevent
the death p. berghei infected animals died low level of
parasitaemia. animals cured chloroquine plus map survive. infection 
with p. vinckei produces high level parasitaemia chloroquine
treatment alone prevents death mice. difference pathogenic
characteristics p. berghei p. vinckei manifested results
measuring kinetics activity antioxidative enzymes red blood 
and liver cells infected mice: lipid peroxidation (lpo), superoxide
dismutases (sod), glutathione peroxidase (gp), catalase (cat) reduced
glutathione (gsh). rapid increase lpo rbc particular 
p. vinckei infected animals indicates prevailing role membrane
detoxification process. continuous increase activity enzymes of
cytoplasmic origin, e.g. sod gp also observed. powerful increase gsh
distinguishes erythrocytes p. vinckei infected animals. similar not
identical data characterize enzyme activities liver cells the
plasmodia infected animals.
