invasion hepatocytes plasmodium sporozoites deposited anopheles
mosquitoes, subsequent transformation infective merozoites an
obligatory step initiation malaria. interactions the
sporozoites hepatocytes lead distinct, complex coordinated cellular 
and systemic host response. little known host liver cell response to
sporozoite invasion, whether primarily adaptive parasite, for
the host, both. present study used gene expression profiling human 
hepg2-a16 liver cells infected plasmodium falciparum sporozoites to
understand host early cellular events factors influencing parasite
infectivity sporozoite development. results show early 30 min 
following wild-type, non-irradiated sporozoite exposure, expressions at
least 742 genes selectively altered. genes regulate diverse biological 
functions, immune processes, cell adhesion communications, metabolism
pathways, cell cycle regulation, signal transduction. functions reflect
cellular events consistent initial host cell defense responses, well as
alterations host cells sustain sporozoites growth survival. irradiated 
sporozoites gave similar gene expression pattern changes, direct
comparative analysis liver gene expression profiles caused irradiated 
and non-irradiated sporozoites identified 29 genes, including glypican-3, that
were specifically up-regulated irradiated sporozoites. elucidating the
role subset genes may help identify molecular basis the
irradiated sporozoites inability develop intrahepatically, their
usefulness immunogen developing protective immunity against
pre-erythrocytic stage malaria.
