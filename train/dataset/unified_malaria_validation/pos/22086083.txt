vivax malaria widely distributed human malaria resulting 80-300
million clinical cases every year. causes severe infection mortality but
is generally regarded benign disease investigated in
detail. present study aimed perform human serum proteome analysis a
malaria endemic area india identify potential serum biomarkers vivax
malaria understand host response. proteomic analysis performed 16 
age gender matched subjects (vivax patients control) duplicate.
protein extraction protocols optimized large coverage serum
proteome obtain high-resolution data. identification 67 differentially 
expressed statistically significant (student's t-test; p<0.05) protein spots 
was established maldi-tof/tof mass spectrometry. many identified
proteins apolipoprotein e, serum amyloid p, haptoglobin,
ceruloplasmin, hemopexin interesting diagnostic point view 
could studied potential serum biomarkers. differentially
expressed serum proteins vivax malaria identified study subjected
to functional pathway analysis using multiple software, including ingenuity
pathway analysis (ipa), protein analysis evolutionary relationships
(panther) database annotation, visualization integrated discovery
(david) functional annotation tool better understanding biological
context identified proteins, involvement various physiological
pathways association disease pathogenesis. functional pathway analysis
of differentially expressed proteins suggested modulation multiple
vital physiological pathways, including acute phase response signaling,
complement coagulation cascades, hemostasis vitamin metabolism pathway 
due parasitic infection. article part special issue
entitled: proteomics: clinical link.
