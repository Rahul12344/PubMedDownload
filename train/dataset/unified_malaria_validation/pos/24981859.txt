nitric oxide (no) carbon monoxide (co) gasotransmitters suppress the
development severe forms malaria associated plasmodium infection.
here, addressed mechanism underlying protective effect against
experimental cerebral malaria (ecm), severe form malaria develops in
plasmodium-infected mice, resembles, many aspects, human cerebral
malaria (cm). suppresses pathogenesis ecm via mechanism involving (1)
the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (nrf-2), (2)
induction heme oxygenase-1 (ho-1), (3) co production via heme catabolism
by ho-1. protection afforded associated inhibition cd4(+) 
helper (th) cd8(+) cytotoxic (tc) cell activation response plasmodium
infection via mechanism involving ho-1 co. protective effect 
co associated modulation host pathogen load, suggesting these
gasotransmitters establish crosstalk-conferring disease tolerance plasmodium
infection.
