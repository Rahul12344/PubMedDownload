in order investigate alterations erythrocyte protective antioxidant
mechanisms, lipid peroxidation trace elements associated anemia in
bovine tropical theileriosis, infected group comprised 50 crossbred
holstein cattle, 1-2 years old, naturally infected theileria annulata,
were divided 4 subgroups according parasitemia rates (<1%, 1-3%,
3-5%, >5%) also 10 healthy cattle control selected. blood samples
were taken hematological parameters, activities antioxidant enzymes
including superoxide dismutase (sod), glutathione peroxidase (gpx) catalase
and serum concentrations antioxidant trace elements (copper, iron, zinc, 
manganese selenium) measured. index lipid peroxidation, the
level malondialdehyde (mda) also determined. results showed a
conspicuous decrease activities sod, gpx catalase (p<0.01), a
significant decrease serum concentrations cu, zn, mn se cattle
with higher 1% parasitemia (p<0.05) compared control. addition,
remarkable elevations mda level (p<0.01) serum concentration iron
(p<0.05) observed infected animals. findings pointed the
occurrence exacerbating oxidative injuries erythrocytes parasitemia.
furthermore, concluded infection t. annulata interfere
with protective antioxidant mechanisms rbcs oxidative damages, which
promote development anemia.
