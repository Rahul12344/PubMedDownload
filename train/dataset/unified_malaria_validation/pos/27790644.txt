hemozoin (hz) released ruptured erythrocytes malaria infection
caused plasmodium sp., addition malaria infected individuals prone 
to bacterial sepsis. molecular interactions hz, bacterial components 
and macrophages remains poorly investigated. report, investigated 
combinatorial immune-modulatory effects phagocytosed hz, interferon gamma
(ifnγ) lipopolysaccharide (lps) macrophages. macrophages treated 
various concentrations commercial synthetic hz, surprisingly not
result inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) expression. however, when
macrophages pretreated hz challenged ifnγ lps, there
was differential impact inos expression. increase inos
expression macrophages pre-treated hz subsequently treated
with ifnγ compared ifnγ alone. whereas inos expression reduced when
hz phagocytosed macrophages stimulated lps compared lps alone.
furthermore, increased activation nf-κb hz phagocytosed
macrophages challenged ifnγ. interaction hz and
macrophages impact inos expression.
