there extensive studies clinicopathological findings spontaneous
canine babesiosis caused large form parasite found europe. to
further characterize describe clinicopathological findings dogs affected
with large form babesia northeastern italy, evaluated 23 italian
dogs canine babesiosis means clinical history, physical examination,
hematological, biochemical, hemostatic tests, serum electrophoresis and
urinalysis. seventeen dogs (74%) recently traveled hunting trip (within 
5-15 days presented clinic) bosnia herzegovina (n=7), to
croatia (n=8) hungary (n=2). duration clinical signs ranged 1 
to 5 days prior arrival clinic. main clinical signs were
dehydration (100%), apathy (74%), anorexia decrease appetite (70%) fever
(68%). anemia present 74% dogs classified mild (35%),
moderate (59%) severe (6%). cases, anemia normocytic and
normochromic. three dogs presented erythrocyte regeneration. seventy percent
of dogs hemolytic anemia 30% non-hemolytic anemia. sixty-nine percent
of dogs showed leucopenia 74% neutropenia. leucocitosis, due mature
neutrophilia lymphocytosis, present one dog. activated lymphocytes
were noted 61% dogs. dogs, thrombocytopenia elevated
hyperfibrinogenemia present. significant prolonged activated partial
thromboplastin time (aptt) found one case. four dogs, plasma 
fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products (fdps) d-dimer increased.
antithrombin (at) slightly decreased 11 23 dogs. majority of
cases, mild elevation aspartate aminotransferase (ast), alanine
aminotransferase (alt), alkaline phosphatase (alp), creatinekinase (ck), total
bilirubin lactic acid decrease total iron total iron binding
capacity (tibc) present. conclusion, main clinicopathological
