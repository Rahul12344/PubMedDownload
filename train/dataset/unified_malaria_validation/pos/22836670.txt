survival malaria pathogen plasmodium falciparum host erythrocytes
requires opening new permeability pathways (npps) host cell
membrane, accomplishing entry nutrients, exit metabolic waste products such
as lactate movement inorganic ions cl⁻, na⁺ ca²⁺. the
molecular identity npps remained largely elusive presumably involves
several channels, partially activated oxidative stress in
uninfected erythrocytes. one npp candidate aquaporin 9 (aqp9), a
glycerol-permeable water channel expressed erythrocytes. gene-targeted mice
lacking functional aqp9 (aqp⁻/⁻) survive infection malaria pathogen
plasmodium berghei better wild-type littermates (aqp9⁺/⁺). the
present study whole-cell patch-clamp recordings performed explore whether
ion channel activity different erythrocytes aqp⁻/⁻ aqp9⁺/⁺ mice.
as result, cation conductance (k⁺ > na⁺ > ca²⁺ ≫ nmdg⁺) significantly
lower erythrocytes aqp⁻/⁻ erythrocytes aqp9⁺/⁺ mice.
oxidative stress exposure 15-30 min 1 mm h₂o₂ 1 mm
tert-butyl-hydroperoxide enhanced cation conductance increased cytosolic 
ca²⁺ concentration, effects significantly less pronounced erythrocytes from
aqp⁻/⁻ erythrocytes aqp9⁺/⁺ mice. conclusion, lack aqp9
decreases cation conductance erythrocytes, effect possibly
participates altered susceptibility aqp9-deficient mice infection
with p. berghei.
