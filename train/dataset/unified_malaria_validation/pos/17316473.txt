plasmodium spp. cause worst parasitic diseases humans evade host
immunity complicated ways. activated catabolism tryptophan dendritic
cells thought suppress immunity, mediated inducible
rate-limiting enzyme tryptophan catabolism, indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (ido),
via tryptophan depletion production toxic metabolites. various
infections, including malaria, ido known activated biological
significance unclear; therefore, investigated whether malaria parasites
induce ido suppress host immune responses. found enzymatic activity of
ido elevated systematically mouse malaria model, abolished 
in vivo ido inhibition 1-methyl tryptophan. experimental infection with
plasmodium yoelii showed ido inhibition slightly suppressed parasite density
in association enhanced proliferation ifn-gamma production cd4+ t
cells response malaria parasites. observations suggest induction
of ido one immune mechanisms malaria parasites.
