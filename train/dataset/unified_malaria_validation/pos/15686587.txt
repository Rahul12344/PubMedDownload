the distribution gene variants antigen processing proteins transporter 
associated antigen processing type 1 (tap1) proteasome subunit beta type
9 (psmb9) shared bidirectional promoter assessed children
with either mild severe malaria. genetic study performed samples
collected longitudinal study malariometric indices area
hyperendemic plasmodium falciparum malaria gabon. allele frequencies
of genes differ mild severe malaria groups. the
distributions alleles among children distinct phenotypes severe
malaria similar. negative association hypoglycaemia psmb9
promoter variant psmb9-r found (odds ratio 0.01; chi2=12.1; p<0.0005;
pc<0.03). promoter allele tap1-446g associated hyperparasitaemia and
absence hypoglycaemia. tap1, psmb9, tap1/psmb9 promoter alleles in
strong linkage disequilibrium. dna sequencing tap1/psmb9 promoter region
revealed previously unrecognized single nucleotide polymorphism 455 bp upstream
of tap1 transcription start site.
