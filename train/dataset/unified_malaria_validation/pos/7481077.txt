antisense rna expression used assess role interleukin 2
receptor (il2r) alpha-chain proliferation cells transformed infection 
with intracellular parasite theileria parva. two vectors constructed, in
which part bovine il2r alpha-chain cdna inserted either sense 
antisense orientation plasmid phs1-cat, expressed induction of
the human metallothionein iia (hmt-iia) cadmium (cd2+). t. parva-infected 
t-cell line, tpm(803), known express il2 il2r genes constitutive 
way, permanently transfected one two constructs, effect
of antisense il2r alpha-chain rna expression upon proliferation tpm(803) cells
was tested. antisense-transfected tpm(803) cells grew much slowly than
sense-transfected cells even absence added cd2+, addition of
cd2+ culture medium resulted inhibition. strong reduction 
il2r alpha-chain mrna observed antisense sense-transfected
cells. observations confirm role il2r alpha-chain in
proliferation t. parva-infected tpm(803) cells.
