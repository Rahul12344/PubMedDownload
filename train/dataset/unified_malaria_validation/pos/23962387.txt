the complex imprinted gnas locus encodes g-alpha subunit (gαs) involved 
in number g-protein coupled signaling pathways eukaryotic cells.
erythrocyte invasion plasmodium falciparum parasites significantly
regulated protein gnas gene. study designed evaluate the
association single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) present gnas locus 
and susceptibility malaria. case control study, individuals affected
by p. falciparum malaria (n=230), plasmodium vivax malaria (n=230) normal
controls (n=230) tested association eighteen (18) known snps to
evaluate role onset disease. significant
difference genotype frequencies snps tested p. falciparum
and p. vivax affected individuals. however, bonferroni correction for
multiple comparisons performed control, results demonstrated
alleles genotypes rs7121: c>t (nc_000020.10:g.57478807c>t), silent
polymorphism situated exon 5, significantly (p<0.05) associated 
susceptibility malaria south indians participants. results
demonstrate population specific polymorphisms exist gnas gene may
alter risk occurrence malaria.
