the role proinflammatory cytokine production pathogenesis malaria is
well established, identification parasite products initiate
inflammation complete. hemozoin crystalline metabolite hemoglobin 
digestion released malaria infection. present study, we
characterized immunostimulatory activity pure synthetic hemozoin (shz) 
vitro vivo. stimulation naive murine macrophages shz results in
the myd88-independent activation nf-kappab erk, well release 
the chemokine mcp-1; responses augmented ifn-gamma. macrophages
prestimulated ifn-gamma, shz also results myd88-dependent release of
tnf-alpha. endothelial cells, encounter hemozoin schizont rupture,
respond shz releasing il-6 chemokines mcp-1 il-8. vivo, 
introduction shz peritoneal cavity produces inflammatory response 
characterized neutrophil recruitment production mcp-1, kc, il-6,
il-1alpha, il-1beta. mcp-1 kc produced independently myd88, tlr2/4
and tlr9, components inflammasome; however, neutrophil recruitment,
the localized production il-1beta, increase circulating il-6
require myd88 signaling, il-1r pathway, inflammasome components ice
(il-1beta-converting enzyme), asc (apoptosis-associated, speck-like protein
containing card), nalp3. note, inflammasome activation shz reduced
by allopurinol, inhibitor uric acid synthesis. data suggest 
that uric acid released malaria infection may serve augment 
initial host response hemozoin via activation nalp3 inflammasome.
