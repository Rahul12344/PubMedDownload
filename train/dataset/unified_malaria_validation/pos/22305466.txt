background: cytoadherence infected red blood cells brain endothelium is
causally implicated malarial coma, one severe manifestations of
falciparum malaria. cytoadherence mediated specific binding variant
parasite antigens, expressed surface infected erythrocytes, to
endothelial receptors including, icam-1, vcam cd36. fatal cases severe 
falciparum malaria coma, blood vessels brain characteristically
congested infected erythrocytes. brain sections fatal case of
knowlesi malaria, without coma, similarly congested infected
erythrocytes. objective study determine binding phenotype 
of plasmodium knowlesi infected human erythrocytes recombinant human icam-1,
vcam cd36.
methods: five patients pcr-confirmed p. knowlesi malaria recruited into
the study consent april august 2010. pre-treatment venous blood 
was washed cultured ex vivo increase proportion schizont-infected
erythrocytes. cultured blood seeded petri dishes triplicate areas
coated icam-1, vcam cd36. following incubation 37°c one hour 
dishes washed number infected erythrocytes bound/mm2 pbs
control areas recombinant human icam-1 vcam cd36 coated areas were
recorded. assay performed duplicate. assay performance monitored 
with plasmodium falciparum clone hb3.
results: blood samples cultured ex vivo 14.5 h (mean 11.3 ± 1.9 h)
to increase relative proportion mature trophozoite schizont-infected
red blood cells least 50% (mean 65.8 ± 17.51%). three (60%) isolates bound 
significantly icam-1 vcam, one (20%) isolate bound vcam none the
five bound significantly cd36.
conclusions: plasmodium knowlesi infected erythrocytes human subjects bind
in specific variable manner inducible endothelial receptors icam-1
and vcam. binding constitutively-expressed endothelial receptor cd36 was
not detected. work required define pathological
consequences interactions.
