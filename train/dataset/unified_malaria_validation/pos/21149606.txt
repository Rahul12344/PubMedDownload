the human nk cell receptor nkp80 stimulates cytotoxicity upon engagement its
genetically linked ligand aicl. however, mechanisms underlying nkp80-mediated
signaling unknown. study, dissected nkp80 signaling using nk
cell line nk92mi. demonstrated nkp80, nkp80 mutated tyrosine 7
(nkp80/y7f), tyrosine phosphorylated. accordingly, nkp80/y7f, not
nkp80/y30f nkp80/y37f, failed induce cytotoxicity. nkp80 phosphopeptides
comprising hemi-itam-like sequence surrounding tyrosine 7 bound lck- and
syk-family kinases; accordingly, cross-linking nkp80, nkp80/y7f,
induced syk phosphorylation. moreover, inhibition syk kinase, zap-70
kinase, impaired cytotoxic responses nkp80. atypical residues the
hemi-itam-like motif nkp80 cause altered stoichiometry phosphorylation
but substantially affect nk cytotoxicity. altogether, results show 
that nkp80 uses atypical hemi-itam syk kinase trigger cellular
cytotoxicity.
