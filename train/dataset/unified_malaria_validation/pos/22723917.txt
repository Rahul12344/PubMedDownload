the blood stage plasmodium parasite life cycle responsible the
clinical symptoms malaria. epidemiological studies identified
coincidental malarial endemicity multiple red blood cell (rbc) disorders.
many rbc disorders result mutations genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins 
and associated increased protection malarial infections.
however mechanisms underpinning genetic, host responses remain obscure.
we performed n-ethyl-n-nitrosourea (enu) mutagenesis screen have
identified novel dominant (haploinsufficient) mutation ank-1 gene
(ank1(mri23420)) mice displaying hereditary spherocytosis (hs). female mice,
heterozygous ank-1 mutation showed increased survival infection by
plasmodium chabaudi adami ds concomitant 30% decrease parasitemia
compared wild-type, isogenic mice (wt). comparative vivo red cell
invasion parasite growth assay showed rbc-autonomous effect characterised
by decreased proportion infected heterozygous rbcs. within approximately 6-8
hours post-invasion, tunel staining intraerythrocytic parasites, showed a
significant increase dead parasites heterozygotes. especially
notable ring trophozoite stages blood infected heterozygous 
mutant mice compared wt (p<0.05). conclude increased malaria
resistance due ankyrin-1 deficiency caused intraerythrocytic death
of p. chabaudi parasites.
