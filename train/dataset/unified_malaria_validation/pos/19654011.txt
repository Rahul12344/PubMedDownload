malaria infection initiated mosquito injects plasmodium sporozoites
into mammalian host. sporozoites exhibit gliding motility vitro 
vivo. motility associated secretion least two proteins,
circumsporozoite protein (csp) thrombospondin-related anonymous protein
(trap). derive micronemes, organelles empty the
apical end sporozoite. sporozoite motility initiated vitro by
albumin added medium. investigate albumin functions this
process, studied second messenger signalling within sporozoite. using
pharmacological activators inhibitors, concluded gliding
motility initiated albumin interacts surface sporozoite
and leads signal transduction cascade within sporozoite,
including elevation intracellular camp, modulation sporozoite
motility ca(2+) release microneme proteins.
