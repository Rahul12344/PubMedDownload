central nervous system tissue mice infected plasmodium berghei anka (pba)
exhibits similar histopathological features post-mortem human
cerebral malaria (cm) tissue. study, neurochemical characteristics of
pba-infected control mice compared. substance p-containing neurones were
almost completely lost cortex striatum pba-infected mice seven
days inoculation, whereas intensity calbindin immunolabelling was
increased compared controls. neuropeptide y- somatostatin-containing
neurones dramatically reduced number cortex day 7
post-inoculation mice compared controls. neurochemical pattern mice 
with cm similar previously reported produced rats by
quinolinic acid. since level quinolinic acid known raised 
brains pba-infected mice, results would consistent role for
quinolinic acid production brain damage fatal murine cm.
