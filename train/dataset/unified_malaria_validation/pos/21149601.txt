although microbial infections alter steady-state hematopoiesis, the
mechanisms drive changes well understood. addressed role
for ifn-γ signaling infection-induced bone marrow suppression anemia 
murine model human monocytic ehrlichiosis, emerging tick-borne disease.
within bone marrow ehrlichia muris-infected c57bl/6 mice, observed a
reduction myeloid progenitor cells, defined phenotypically and
functionally. infected mice exhibited concomitant increase developing
myeloid cells within bone marrow, increase frequency circulating
monocytes, increase splenic myeloid cells. infection-induced
changes progenitor cell phenotype critically dependent ifn-γ, 
ifn-α, signaling. mice deficient ifn-γ signaling pathway, observed
an increase myeloid progenitor cells cdllb(lo)gr1(lo) promyelocytic cells 
within bone marrow, well reduced frequencies mature granulocytes and
monocytes. furthermore, e. muris-infected ifn-γr-deficient mice exhibit
anemia increase circulating monocytes, succumbed infection. 
gene transcription studies revealed ifn-γr-deficient cdllb(lo)gr1(lo)
promyelocytes e. muris-infected mice exhibited significantly reduced
expression irf-1 irf-8, key transcription factors regulate the
differentiation granulocytes monocytes. finally, using mixed bone marrow
chimeric mice, show ifn-γ-dependent infection-induced myelopoiesis occurs
via direct effect cytokine developing myeloid cells. propose
that, addition many known roles, ifn-γ acts control infection 
by directly promoting differentiation myeloid cells contribute to
host defense.
