background: biomarkers iron [plasma ferritin (pf)], vitamin [retinol binding
protein (rbp)], zinc status [plasma zinc (pzn)] affected acute
phase response, independent micronutrient status.
objective: objective analyses assess asymptomatic malaria
infection affects interpretation biomarkers adjustment for
elevated acute phase proteins (apps).
methods: soluble transferrin receptor (stfr), pf, rbp, pzn concentrations
were measured among 451 asymptomatic children aged 6-23 mo burkina faso and
adjusted elevated app (c-reactive protein ≥5 mg/l and/or
α-1-acid-glycoprotein ≥1 g/l) based 4-group categorical model. plasma
histidine-rich protein ii (hrp2) concentrations ≥0.75 μg/l considered
indicative current recent malaria parasitemia.
results: children study, 57.4% least 1 elevated app, and
48.5% elevated hrp2. adjusting app, children elevated hrp2 had
higher pf (23.5 ± 1.5 μg/l vs. 11.1 ± 0.8 μg/l; p < 0.001) lower rbp (0.79 ± 
0.01 μmol/l vs. 0.92 ± 0.01 μmol/l; p < 0.001) without, were
no differences pzn among without elevated hrp2 (64.9 ± 12.7
μg/dl vs. 64.9 ± 11.1 μg/dl; p = 0.98). children elevated hrp2 higher
stfr without (17.6 ± 0.5 mg/l vs. 12.3 ± 0.4 mg/l; p < 0.0001). 
adjusting hrp2, along app, estimated prevalence iron deficiency
(pf < 12 μg/l) increased 38.7% 50.6% vitamin deficiency (rbp < 0.84
μmol/l) decreased 33.4% 27.7%.
conclusions: asymptomatic malaria associated indicators micronutrient 
status, even adjusting app. adjusting indicators iron vitamin 
status based app may inaccurately estimate prevalence of
micronutrient deficiencies settings high prevalence malaria and
inflammation. trial registered clinicaltrials.gov nct00944853.
