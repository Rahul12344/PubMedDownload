chronic graft-versus-host disease (cgvhd) considered autoimmune-like
disease mediated donor cd4(+) cells, origin autoreactive t
cells still controversial. article, report transplantation
of dba/2 donor spleen cells thymectomized mhc-matched allogeneic balb/c
recipients induced autoimmune-like cgvhd, although control syngeneic dba/2
recipients. donor-type cd4(+) cells former latter
recipients induced autoimmune-like manifestations secondary allogeneic balb/c 
as well syngeneic dba/2 recipients. transfer donor-type cd4(+) cells from
secondary dba/2 recipients disease syngeneic donor-type allogeneic
host-type tertiary recipients propagated autoimmune-like manifestations both. 
furthermore, tcr spectratyping revealed clonal expansion the
autoreactive cd4(+) cells cgvhd recipients initiated alloimmune
response. finally, hybridoma cd4(+) clones derived dba/2 recipients with
disease proliferated similarly response stimulation syngeneic donor-type
or allogeneic host-type dendritic cells. results demonstrate the
autoimmune-like manifestations cgvhd mediated population donor 
cd4(+) cells transplants simultaneously recognize ags presented both
donor host apcs.
