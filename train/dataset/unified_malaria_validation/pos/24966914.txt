the mechanisms leading cerebral malaria (cm) completely understood.
brain edema suggested important role experimental cm. in
this study, cba/cah mice infected plasmodium berghei anka blood-stage
and typical symptoms cm developed day 7, brain tissues processed 
for electron-microscopic immunohistochemical studies. study demonstrated 
ultrastructural hallmarks cerebral edema perivascular edema astroglial 
dilatation confirming existing evidence vasogenic cytogenic edema. this
correlates closely clinical features cm. adaptive response of
astrocytic activity, represented increasing glial fibrillary acidic protein
(gfap) expression perivascular area increasing numbers large
astrocyte clusters predominately found cm mice. presence of
multivesicular lamellar bodies indicates severity cerebral damage in
experimental cm. congestion microvessels occluded white blood cells
(wbcs), parasitized red blood cells (prbcs) platelets also crucial
covariate role cm pathogenesis.
