in early immune response plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes
(irbc), natural killer (nk) cells activated, suggests important role
in innate anti-parasitic immunity. however, well understood whether nk 
cells directly recognize irbc whether stimulation nk cells depends mainly
on activating signals accessory cells cell-to-cell contact or
soluble factors. present study, investigated influence of
membrane-bound host heat shock protein (hsp) 70 triggering cytotoxicity nk 
cells malaria-naïve donors cell line nk92 irbc. hsp70 and
hla-e membrane expression irbc potential activatory nk cell receptors
(nkg2c, cd94) assessed flow cytometry immunoblot. upon contact with
irbc, granzyme b (gzmb) production release initiated unstimulated 
hsp70-peptide (tkd) pre-stimulated nk cells, determined western blot,
rt-pcr elispot analysis. eryptosis irbc determined annexin
v-staining. results suggest presence hsp70 absence hla-e on
the membrane irbc prompt infected host cells become targets nk
cell-mediated cytotoxicity, evidenced impaired parasite development.
contact irbc nk cells induced release gzmb. propose following 
gzmb uptake, irbc undergo eryptosis via perforin-independent, gzmb-mediated
mechanism. since nk activity toward irbc could specifically enhanced tkd
peptide abrogated baseline levels blocking hsp70 exposure, propose
tkd innovative immunostimulatory agent tested adjunct to
anti-parasitic treatments vivo.
