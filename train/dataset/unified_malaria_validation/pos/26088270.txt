using flow cytometry, platelet-leukocyte aggregate (pla) formation previously
been documented dogs variety systemic inflammatory disorders and
immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia. platelet activation subsequent
interaction platelets leukocytes important regulating innate 
immunity systemic inflammation. objective study to
investigate pla formation canine babesiosis determine whether was
associated outcome. blood collected 36 client-owned dogs diagnosed 
with babesia rossi infection 15 healthy controls using edta anticoagulant.
activated platelets pla formation detected measuring surface
expression p-selectin (cd62p) platelets, monocytes neutrophils. 
babesia-infected dogs, 29 survived seven died. percentage of
cd62p-positive monocytes significantly higher (p = 0.036) the
babesia-infected dogs (54%) healthy control dogs (35.3%). however, 
were significant differences babesia-infected control groups
for cd62p-positive platelets (4.9% 1.2%, respectively) cd62p-positive
neutrophils (28.3% 17.9%, respectively). percentage cd62p-positive
monocytes significantly higher (p = 0.019) survivors (58.9%) in
healthy control dogs; however, significant differences 
non-survivors (39.2%) controls survivors non-survivors.
there significant differences groups percentage of
cd62p-positive platelets (survivors 4.8%; non-survivors 5.3%; controls 1.2%) or
cd62p-positive neutrophils (survivors 31.6%; non-survivors 5.6%; controls 17.9%).
in conclusion, babesia-infected dogs, specifically dogs survived, a
significantly increased percentage platelet-monocyte aggregates compared to
healthy control dogs.
