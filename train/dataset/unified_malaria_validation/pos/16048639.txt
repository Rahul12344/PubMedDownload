summary disruption lymphotoxin beta receptor (ltbetar) gene shown
to result enhanced resistance female mice blood-stage plasmodium
chabaudi malaria. here, investigate effect ltbetar deletion host
defence males. contrast females, male ltbetar(-/-) mice exhibit
any increase resistance. conversely, even susceptible than
wild-type c57bl/6 mice, becomes evident lowering circulating levels
of testosterone castration, makes c57bl/6 males resistant, whereas
ltbetar(-/-) remain susceptible. gene-expression analysis using cdna arrays
revealed differences immunological responses spleen malaria-resistant
female malaria-susceptible castrated male ltbetar(-/-) mice. liver,
however, expression levels plasminogen activator inhibitor pai1, chemokine
cxcl10, dual specificity phosphatase dusp1, hydroxysteroid-specific
sulfotransferases sult2a1/2 decreased 6- 85-fold susceptible castrated
male ltbetar(-/-) mice comparison resistant female ltbetar(-/-) mice at
maximal parasitaemia, evidenced northern blot analyses. present data
support previous view liver involved combat against
malarial blood stages down-regulation genes dusp1 sult2a1/2
signals dysregulation protective liver responses, thus possibly contributing
to male susceptibility ltbetar(-/-) mice.
