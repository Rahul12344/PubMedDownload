intracellular parasites show host cell specificity, precise information on
the range host cells prerequisite identification host
molecules account specificity involved entry processes.
the sporozoite stage tick-borne protozoan parasite theileria parva binds
to enters bovine lymphocytes, precise information susceptibility
of cell types present tick attachment site unavailable. we
quantitatively examined susceptibility cell types known present at
the tick attachment site previously established vitro assay. apart from
lymphocytes, sporozoites also bind enter macrophages afferent lymph
veiled cells; bind enter fibroblasts, granulocytes, or
erythrocytes. sporozoites phagocytosed macrophages veiled cells
but enter lymphocytes. since tick attachment site region
of cellular inflammation, also examined effects agents known be
present area lymphocyte susceptibility. short-term preincubation of
lymphocytes tick salivary gland extract, compounds induce
lymphocyte proliferation, interleukin-2 (il-2), cytokine produced by
activated lymphocytes, increased host cell susceptibility 30 60%. 
the il-2-induced increase host cell susceptibility could prevented by
treating lymphocytes monoclonal antibody il-a 111, reacts with
the bovine il-2 receptor alpha chain inhibits il-2-driven cell proliferation.
the changes induced tick salivary gland extract il-2 occurred less than
90 min. similarly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells animal previously
immunized nonrelated antigen (trypanosome variant surface glycoprotein)
and stimulated vitro antigen showed increases host cell
susceptibility 70 125%. contrast, treatment lymphocytes with
gamma interferon induce increase host cell susceptibility.
