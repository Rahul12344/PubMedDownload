pathogenesis remains incompletely understood number effectors 
proposed, including plasma microparticles (mp). mp numbers increased cm
patients' circulation and, mouse model, localised within

work define, first time, protein cargo mp experimental
cerebral malaria (ecm) overarching hypothesis characterisation
could help understand cm pathogenesis. using qualitative quantitative
high-throughput proteomics compared mp proteins non-infected p.
berghei anka-infected mice. 360 proteins identified, 60 which
were differentially abundant, determined quantitative comparison using
