young calves possess strong innate immunity babesia bovis infection
that lasts approximately 6 months birth abrogated the
removal spleen. immunity characterized cellular involving a
soluble mediator. nitric oxide implicated virtue babesiacidal 
affects vitro, questioned effective vivo, due ability
to downregulate type-1 immunity. spleen cells obtained 4-month-old
calves adult steers processed monitoring cytokine inducible
nitric oxide synthase (inos) mrna expression response initial b.
bovis infection. data provided evidence transient role nitric oxide 
in innate immunity, characterized brief inos induction spleen calves
that detectable spleens adults. inos message followed the
early induction interleukin (il)-12 interferon (ifn)-gamma message in
calves. induction il-12 ifn-gamma message adults delayed 
il-10 message induced. transformation growth factor-beta mrna expression
levels greater spleen cells adults early infection then
declined, whereas expression levels increased spleen cells calves later
in infection process. together, data support concept 'first come, 
first serve' cytokine influence cellular activities, importance a
type-1 response control initial infection need tight
regulation order prevent pathology associated production of
nitric oxide inflammatory cytokines.
