inhibition tumor cell growth antimicrobial activity attributed to
the stimulation production transcriptional upregulation inducible
nitric oxide synthase. present study, used mice devoid functional
interferon regulatory factor 1 targeted gene disruption (irf-1(-/-)) to
investigate role host immune response blood-stage
plasmodium berghei anka infection. irf-1(-/-) mice survived longer later
onset lower peak parasitemia despite inability produce
appreciable levels no. administration exogenous interleukin-12 (il-12) 
was able prolong survival wild-type mice upregulation the
expression gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) no. however, the
administration il-12 improve survival irf-1(-/-) mice. these
studies indicate il-12 able mediate protection via ifn-gamma-
and no-dependent pathway wild-type mice, protective mechanism may
not functional irf-1(-/-) mice. results suggest may 
essential host immunity parasite irf-1(-/-) mice able 
induce ifn-gamma- no-independent mechanism p. berghei infection.
