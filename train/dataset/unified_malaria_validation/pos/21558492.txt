studies plasmodium falciparum transcriptome shown tightly
controlled progression parasite intra-erythrocytic
developmental cycle (idc) accompanied continuous gene expression cascade 
in expressed genes exhibit single transcriptional peak. 
biochemical cellular functions genes mediated encoded
proteins, understanding relationship mrna protein levels is
crucial inferring biological activity transcriptional gene expression
data. although studies organisms show <50% protein abundance
variation may attributable corresponding mrna levels, situation in
plasmodium complicated dynamic nature cyclic gene
expression cascade. study, simultaneously determined mrna protein 
abundance profiles p. falciparum parasites idc 2-hour
resolution based oligonucleotide microarrays two-dimensional differential 
gel electrophoresis protein gels. find proteins represented by
more one isoform, presumably post-translational modifications.
like transcripts, proteins exhibit cyclic abundance profiles one peak
during idc, whereas presence functionally related proteins highly
correlated. contrast, abundance parasite proteins peaks
significantly later (median 11 h) corresponding transcripts often
decreases slowly second half idc. computational modeling indicates 
that considerable varied incongruence transcript protein
abundance may largely caused dynamics translation protein
degradation. furthermore, present cyclic abundance profiles also for
parasite-associated human proteins confirm presence five human
proteins potential role antioxidant defense within parasites.
together, data provide fundamental insights transcript-protein
relationships p. falciparum important correct interpretation 
of transcriptional data may facilitate improvement development
of malaria diagnostics drug therapy.
