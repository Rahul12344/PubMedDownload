background: placental malaria (pm) leading cause maternal infant
mortality. although accumulation parasitized erythrocytes (pes) and
monocytes within placenta thought contribute pathophysiology 
pm, molecular mechanisms underlying pm remain unclear. based the
hypothesis excessive complement activation may contribute pm, in
particular generation potent inflammatory peptide c5a, investigated the
role c5a pathogenesis pm vitro vivo.
methodology principal findings: using primary human monocytes, the
interaction c5a malaria vitro assessed. csa- cd36-binding 
pes induced activation c5 presence human serum. plasmodium
falciparum gpi (pfgpi) enhanced c5a receptor expression (cd88) monocytes, 
the co-incubation monocytes c5a pfgpi resulted synergistic
induction cytokines (il-6, tnf, il-1beta, il-10), chemokines (il-8, mcp-1,
mip1alpha, mip1beta) anti-angiogenic factor sflt-1 time and
dose-dependent manner. dysregulated response abrogated c5a receptor
blockade. assess potential role c5a pm, c5a plasma levels were
measured malaria-exposed primigravid women western kenya. compared to
pregnant women without malaria, c5a levels significantly elevated women
with pm.
conclusions significance: results suggest c5a may contribute to
the pathogenesis pm inducing dysregulated inflammatory angiogenic
responses impair placental function.
