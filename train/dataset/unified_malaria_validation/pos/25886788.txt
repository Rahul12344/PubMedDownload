background: transforming growth factor beta-1 (tgf-β1) important regulator 
of inflammation. platelets major source tgf-β1 reduced severe
malaria. however, relationships tgf-β1 concentrations platelet
counts, proinflammatory anti-inflammatory cytokine chemokine
concentrations disease severity malaria characterized.
methods: platelet counts serum concentrations tgf-β1, interleukin-1beta
(il-1β), il-6, il-10, interferon (ifn)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-α and
rantes measured time presentation ugandan children with
cerebral malaria (cm, n = 75), uncomplicated malaria (um, n = 67) healthy
community children (cc, n = 62).
results: tgf-β1 concentrations decreased increasing severity disease
[median concentrations (25th, 75th percentile) ng/ml cc, 41.4 (31.6, 57.4);
um, 22.7 (14.1, 36.4); cm, 11.8 (8, 21); p trend < 0.0001]. children 
cm um, tgf-β1 concentrations correlated positively platelet count (cm, p 
< 0.0001; um, p = 0.0015). children cm, tgf-β1 concentration correlated
negatively ifn-γ, il-6 il-10 positively rantes concentrations
(all p < 0.01). tgf-β1 concentration associated death adverse
neurologic cognitive outcomes children cm.
conclusions: tgf-β1 concentrations decrease increasing plasmodium falciparum
disease severity. cm, thrombocytopenia correlates decreased tgf-β1, and
decreased tgf-β1 correlates cytokine/chemokine changes associated with
increased disease severity death. thrombocytopenia may mediate disease
severity malaria reduced tgf-β1-mediated regulation cytokines
associated severe disease.
