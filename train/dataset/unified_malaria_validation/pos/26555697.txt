plasmodium falciparum infection cause microvascular dysfunction, cerebral
encephalopathy death untreated. previously shown high
concentrations free heme, c-x-c motif chemokine 10 (cxcl10) sera of
malaria patients induce apoptosis microvascular endothelial neuronal cells
contributing vascular dysfunction, blood-brain barrier (bbb) damage and
mortality. endothelial progenitor cells (epc) microvascular endothelial cell 
precursors partly responsible repair regeneration damaged bbb
endothelium. studies shown epc's depleted severe malaria
patients, mechanisms mediating phenomenon unknown. toll-like
receptors recognize wide variety pathogen-associated molecular patterns
generated pathogens bacteria parasites. tested hypothesis
that epc depletion malaria pathogenesis function heme-induced
apoptosis mediated cxcl10 induction toll-like receptor (tlr) activation.
heme cxcl10 concentrations plasma obtained malaria patients were
elevated compared non-malaria subjects. epc numbers significantly
decreased malaria patients (p < 0.02) tlr4 expression significantly
elevated vivo. findings confirmed epc precursors vitro; where
it determined heme-induced apoptosis cxcl10 expression was
tlr4-mediated. conclude increased serum heme mediates depletion epc
during malaria pathogenesis.
