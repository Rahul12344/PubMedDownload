the role cytokines plasmodium infection extensively investigated,
but pro anti inflammatory cytokines mediated imbalance malaria
immune-pathogenesis still unrevealed. malaria associated the
circulating levels interleukin-6 (il-6) transforming growth factor β
(tgf-β), association two cytokines immune response remains
largely obscured. using mouse model, proposed il-6 tgf-β involved
in immune regulation dendritic cells (dc), regulatory cells (treg), t-helper
cells (th17) p. berghei anka (pba) infection. association the
cytokines severity malaria established anti-tgf-β treatment
resulting increased parasitemia increased immunopathology, whereas;
anti-il-6 treatment delays immunopathology pba infection. further,
splenocytes revealed differential alteration myeloid dc (mdc), plasmocytoid dc
(pdc), treg, th17 cells following tgf-β il-6 neutralization. interestingly
anti-tgf-β reduces cd11c+cd8+ dc expression, whereas anti-il-6 administration
causes profound increase pba infection swiss mice. observed down
regulation tgf-β, il-10, nfat, foxp3, stat-5 smad-3 upregulation il-6, 
il-23, il-17 stat-3 splenocytes pba infection. stat activity
probably plays differential role induction th17 treg cells.
interestingly found increase stat-3 decrease stat-5 expression
during pba infection. pattern stat indicates possibly tgf-β il-6
play crucial role differentiation dcs subsets treg/th17 imbalance
during experimental cerebral malaria (ecm).
