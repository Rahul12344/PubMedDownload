intraerythrocytic growth human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum
depends delivery nutrients. moreover, infection challenges cell volume
constancy host erythrocyte requiring enhanced activity cell volume
regulatory mechanisms. patch clamp recording demonstrated inwardly outwardly 
rectifying anion channels infected control erythrocytes. the
molecular identity channels remained elusive. show one
channel type voltage dependence, cell volume sensitivity, activation 
oxidation identical clc-2. moreover, western blots facs analysis
showed protein functional clc-2 expression human erythrocytes and
erythrocytes wild type (clcn2(+/+)) clcn2(-/-) mice. finally,
patch clamp recording revealed activation volume-sensitive inwardly rectifying
channels plasmodium berghei-infected clcn2(+/+) clcn2(-/-)
erythrocytes. erythrocytes infected mice genotypes differed cell 
volume inhibition clc-2 zncl(2) (1 mm) induced increase cell
volume parasitized clcn2(+/+) erythrocytes. lack clc-2 inhibit
p. berghei development vivo substantially affect mortality infected
mice. conclusion, activation host clc-2 channels participates the
altered permeability plasmodium-infected erythrocytes required 
intraerythrocytic parasite survival.
