inhibition cell function important pathological feature malaria. we
investigated cell population reduced contributing to
immunosuppression. examined protein rna level various cell receptors,
specific cells children plasmodium falciparum infection and
compared healthy children age. observe reduced levels 
cluster differentiation (cd)3 cell receptor (tcr)alphabeta rna
and protein expression level. reduced expression associated a
collapsed membrane asymmetry determined enhanced annexinv binding. also
human leukocyte antigen (hla)-a,b,c- hla-dr-positive cells increasingly bound
annexinv. enhanced binding annexinv paralleled reduced expression
of transcription factors cell transcription factor 7 gata binding
protein 3, involved expression cell specific genes. also
the expression transcription factors major histocompatibility complex
class ii transactivator regulatory factor x 5, part hla
transcription machinery, reduced infection. show two mechanisms
may lead suppression immune system malaria: cell damage and
reduction gene expression cd3/tcr complex.
