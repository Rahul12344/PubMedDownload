b cell plasma cell responses take place lymphoid organs, of
the inaccessibility organs, analyses human responses largely
performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc). determine whether
pbmc useful source memory b cells plasma cells malaria, and
whether reflect plasmodium-specific b cell responses spleen bone
marrow, investigated components humoral response pbmc
using model plasmodium chabaudi blood-stage infections c57bl/6 mice. we
detected memory b cells, defined isotype-switched igd(-) igm(-) cd19(+) b
cells, low numbers plasmodium chabaudi merozoite surface protein-1
(msp1)-specific memory b cells, pbmc time points sampled 90
days following primary secondary infection. contrast, detected
cd138(+) plasma cells msp1-specific antibody-secreting cells within narrow 
time frame following primary (days 10 25) secondary (day 10) infection.
cd138(+) plasma cells pbmc times expressed cd19, b220 mhc class
ii, suggesting dislodged bone-marrow long-lived plasma cells, 
but newly differentiated migratory plasmablasts migrating bone marrow;
thus reflective ongoing developing immune response. data indicates
that pbmc useful source malaria-specific memory b cells plasma
cells, extrapolation results human malaria infections suggests that
timing sampling, particularly plasma cells, may critical. studies
should therefore include multiple sampling points, times of
infection/immunisation b-cell phenotypes interest likely be
found peripheral blood.
