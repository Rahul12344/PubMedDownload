we previously showed alterations thymus experimental infection with
plasmodium berghei. alterations comprised histological changes, loss of
cortical-medullary limits, intrathymic presence parasites. the
combination chemokines, adhesion molecules extracellular matrix (ecm) is
critical appropriate thymocyte development, analysed thymic expression 
of ecm ligands receptors, well chemokines respective
receptors experimental p. berghei infection. increased expression of
ecm components observed thymi infected mice. contrast,
down-regulated surface expression fibronectin laminin receptors was
observed thymocytes animals. moreover, thymi infected mice 
there increased cxcl12 cxcr4, decreased expression ccl25 and
ccr9. altered thymocyte migration towards ecm elements chemokines seen
when thymi infected mice analysed. evaluation ex vivo migration 
patterns cd4/cd8-defined thymocyte subpopulations revealed that
double-negative (dn), cd4(+) cd8(+) single-positive (sp) cells p.
berghei-infected mice higher migratory responses compared controls.
interestingly, increased numbers dn sp subpopulations found the
spleens infected mice. overall, show thymic atrophy observed p.
berghei-infected mice accompanied thymic microenvironmental changes that
comprise altered expression thymocyte migration-related molecules ecm
and chemokine protein families, turn alter thymocyte migration
pattern. thymic disturbances may consequences control the
