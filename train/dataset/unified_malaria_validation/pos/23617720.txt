the invasion host erythrocytes parasite plasmodium falciparum initiates
the blood stage infection responsible symptoms malaria. invasion
involves extracellular protein interactions host erythrocyte receptors
and ligands merozoite, invasive form parasite. despite
significant research effort, many merozoite surface ligands known
erythrocyte binding partner, likely due intractable biochemical
nature membrane-tethered receptor proteins interactions. few
receptor-ligand pairs described largely relied sourcing
erythrocytes patients rare blood groups, serendipitous approach 
is unsatisfactory systematically identifying novel receptors. have
recently developed scalable assay called avexis (for avidity-based
extracellular interaction screen), designed circumvent technical
difficulties associated identification extracellular protein
interactions, applied identify erythrocyte receptors orphan p.
falciparum merozoite ligands. using approach, recently identified

respectively. essay, review techniques used identify plasmodium
receptors discuss could applied future identify novel
receptors plasmodium parasites also pathogens.
