the surface glycoprotein cd36 (gpiv) known mediate adhesion of
plasmodium falciparum malaria-infected red blood cells receptor for
extracellular matrix proteins collagen thrombospondin. murine
monoclonal igm antibody nl07, specific cd36, shown to
also potent inhibitor adhesion p falciparum malaria-infected red
blood cells c32 melanoma cells. treatment platelets nl07 monoclonal
antibody resulted rapid degranulation, release atp serotonin, increase 
in [ca2+]i, tyrosine phosphorylation substrate protein 130 kd. in
about one-half experiments, activation nl07 resulted formation
of small aggregates 10 30 platelets, whereas half the
experiments, large aggregates seen similar induced adenosine
diphosphate (adp) large aggregates could converted small
aggregates atp alpha ap-2 antibodies gpiib and/or
iiia. microaggregates 2 5 platelets seen glanzmann's platelets
that constitutively lack gpiib/iiia. aggregate formation seen with
heat-treated serum, presence anti c1q antibodies, using c5-,
c8-, c9-deficient human sera. although activation platelets purified
complement components results slow morphologic change without aggregation,
involvement cd36 results rapid complement-mediated activation leading to
formation small aggregates largely independent gpiib/iiia that,
under certain circumstances, proceeds formation large adp-dependent
aggregates.
