malaria infection triggers vigorous host immune responses; however, parasite 
ligands, host receptors, signaling pathways responsible these
reactions remain unknown controversial. malaria parasites primarily reside
within rbcs, thereby hiding direct contact recognition by
host immune cells. host responses malaria infection different from
those elicited bacterial viral infections host receptors
recognizing parasite ligands elusive. investigated mouse
genome-wide transcriptional responses infections two strains of
plasmodium yoelii (n67 n67c) discovered differences innate response
pathways corresponding strain-specific disease phenotypes. using vitro
rnai-based gene knockdown ko mice, demonstrated strong type ifn
(ifn-i) response triggered rna polymerase iii melanoma
differentiation-associated protein 5, toll-like receptors (tlrs), binding 
parasite dna/rna contributed decline parasitemia n67-infected mice. we
showed conventional dendritic cells major sources early ifn-i,
and surface expression phosphatidylserine infected rbcs might promote 
their phagocytic uptake, leading release parasite ligands ifn-i
response n67 infection. contrast, elevated inflammatory response
mediated cd14/tlr p38 signaling played role disease severity and
early host death n67c-infected mice. addition identifying cytosolic
dna/rna sensors signaling pathways previously unrecognized malaria
infection, study demonstrates importance parasite genetic backgrounds 
in malaria pathology provides important information studying human
malaria pathogenesis.
