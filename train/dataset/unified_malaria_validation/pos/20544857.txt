neuroglobin (ngb) proposed neuron-specific, hypoxia-responsive,
neuroprotective protein. however, results conflicting concerning ngb's
physiological pathological significance. study designed to
investigate vivo localization regulation ngb different
neuropathological models representing traumatic injury, infectious, autoimmune,
and excitotoxic pathogeneses. profiled ngb immunohistochemistry murine
models traumatic brain injury, cerebral malaria, experimental autoimmune
encephalitis, kainic acid (ka)-mediated epileptic seizures that, our
knowledge, studied context ngb. control mice ngb was
expressed exclusively neurons. pathological models except ka, in
addition neurons ngb present reactive astrocytes. ngb positive
astrocytes found within regions associated severe pathology and
the astroglial scar. first report ngb present reactive
astroglia scar-forming astrocytes response different pathological
conditions relevant human disease. light previously reported
cyto-protective properties ngb, insight may result therapeutic
ramifications.
