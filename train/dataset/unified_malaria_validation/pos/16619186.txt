cytokines effector molecules important immunoregulatory molecules in
human malaria. tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha limits malaria parasitemia but
also promotes pathogenesis high concentrations, whereas prostaglandin e2
(pge2) inhibits tnf-alpha production reduced childhood malaria, at
least part, suppression cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 following the
ingestion plasmodium falciparum hemozoin (pfhz; malarial pigment) by
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs). although molecular interactions
between tnf-alpha pge2 largely unexplored human malaria, results
presented show pfhz-induced suppression pbmc cox-2 gene products
induces overproduction tnf-alpha. moreover, addition exogenous pge2 to
pfhz-treated pbmcs dose-dependently decreased tnf-alpha production, whereas
experimental cox inhibitors antipyretics used human malaria generated 
increased tnf-alpha production. healthy, malaria-exposed children elevated
levels circulating bicyclo-pge2/tnf-alpha, compared children with
malarial anemia (p<.01), systemic bicyclo-pge2 tnf-alpha significantly
associated hemoglobin concentrations (r=0.745; p<.01). results the
present study illustrate pfhz-induced suppression pge2 promotes
overproduction tnf-alpha, associated enhanced malarial anemia.
