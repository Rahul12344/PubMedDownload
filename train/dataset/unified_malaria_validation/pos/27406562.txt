intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam-1) endothelial protein c receptor
(epcr) candidate receptors deadly complication cerebral malaria.
however, remains unclear plasmodium falciparum parasites dual binding 
specificity involved cytoadhesion different parasite subpopulations
bind brain microvessels. here, investigated issue studying
different subtypes icam-1-binding parasite lines. show two parasite
lines expressing domain cassette 13 (dc13) p. falciparum erythrocyte
membrane protein 1 (pfemp1) family dual binding specificity epcr and
icam-1 mapped icam-1 binding first dblβ domain following the
pfemp1 head structure proteins. pfemp1 head structures diverged
between group (epcr binders) groups b c (cd36 binders), also
investigated icam-1-binding parasites different coreceptor binding
traits influence p. falciparum-infected erythrocyte binding endothelial cells.
whereas levels binding tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α)-stimulated
endothelial cells lung brain icam-1-binding parasite lines
increased, group (epcr icam-1) less dependent group b (cd36 and
icam-1) icam-1 upregulation. furthermore, group dc13 parasite lines had
higher binding levels brain endothelial cells (a microvascular niche with
limited cd36 expression). study shows icam-1 coreceptor a
subset epcr-binding parasites provides first evidence epcr 
icam-1 interact mediate parasite binding resting tnf-α-activated
primary brain lung endothelial cells.importance: cerebral malaria severe
neurological complication p. falciparum infection associated infected
erythrocyte (ie) binding cerebral vessels. yet little known the
mechanisms parasites adhere brain microvascular sites.
here, studied parasite lines expressing group dc13-containing pfemp1
variants, subset previously shown high brain cell- and
other endothelial cell-binding activities. show dc13-containing pfemp1
variants dual epcr- icam-1-binding activities receptors
are involved parasite adherence lung brain endothelial cells. both
epcr icam-1 implicated cerebral malaria, findings suggest the
possibility parasites dual binding activities involved parasite 
sequestration microvascular beds low cd36 expression, brain, 
and urge research multiadhesive properties pfemp1 variants.
