a study made counteracting stress organ injury plasmodium
infection means antioxidants premise free radicals are
responsible causing injury stress organs. evidenced by
drastically altered biochemical parameters liver spleen host in
terms elevated levels lipid peroxides xanthine oxidase (xo) activity,
and fall superoxide dismutase activity coupled drastic
biochemical changes. cardinal factor responsible considered
to xo engenders free radicals purportedly responsible stress
organ (biochemical) injury. results demonstrate lowering lipid peroxide
levels, xanthine oxidase activity, liver weight modulation protein level
in liver host (mouse) plasmodium infection treated catechin, 
glutathione propylgallate.
