tragically common among children sub-saharan africa, cerebral malaria is
characterized rapid progression coma death. study, used a
model cerebral malaria appearing c57bl/6 wt mice infection the
rodent malaria parasite plasmodium berghei anka. expression cellular
localization brain water channel aquaporin-4 (aqp4) investigated
during neurological syndrome. semiquantitative real-time pcr comparing
uninfected infected mice showed reduction brain aqp4 transcript in
cerebral malaria, immunoblots revealed reduction brain aqp4 protein.
reduction brain aqp4 protein confirmed cerebral malaria quantitative
immunogold em; however, polarized distribution aqp4 perivascular and
subpial astrocyte membranes altered. examine role aqp4 
in cerebral malaria, wt mice littermates genetically deficient aqp4 were
infected p. berghei. upon development cerebral malaria, wt aqp4-null 
mice exhibited similar increases width perivascular astroglial end-feet 
brain. nevertheless, aqp4-null mice exhibited severe signs cerebral
malaria greater brain edema, although disruption blood-brain barrier 
was similar groups. longitudinal studies, cerebral malaria appeared
nearly 1 earlier aqp4-null mice, reduced survival noted when
chloroquine rescue attempted. conclude water channel aqp4 confers
partial protection cerebral malaria.
