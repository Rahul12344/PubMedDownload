plasmodium falciparum malaria remains one deadly infections
worldwide. pathogenesis infection results sequestration of
infected erythrocytes (irbc) vital organs, including brain, resulting
impairment blood flow, hypoxia, lactic acidosis. sequestration occurs
through adhesion irbc host receptors microvascular endothelium by
plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1), large family 
variant surface antigens, seven extracellular domains can
bind multiple host receptors. consequently, antiadhesive therapies directed at
single endothelial adhesion molecules may effective. study, we
demonstrated serine protease thrombin, pivotal the
activation coagulation cascade, cleaved major parasite adhesin 
surface irbc. result, adhesion flow dramatically reduced, and
already adherent irbc detached. thrombin cleavage sites mapped the
duffy binding-like δ1 (dblδ1) domain interdomains 1 2 pfemp1 of
the parasite line it4var19. furthermore, observed inverse correlation
between presence thrombin irbc cerebral malaria autopsies of
children. investigated modified (r67a) thrombin thrombin inhibitor,
hirugen, inhibit binding substrates exosite i, thereby
reducing proinflammatory properties. approaches reduced barrier
dysfunction induced thrombin without affecting proteolytic activity on
pfemp1, raising possibility thrombin cleavage variant pfemp1 may be
exploited broadly inhibitory antiadhesive therapy.importance: plasmodium
falciparum malaria third leading cause mortality due pathogen,
with 214 million people infected 438,000 deaths annually. adhesion of
plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (irbc) microvascular endothelium
is major pathological process severe malaria. recent
implementation artemisinin-based antimalarial therapy severe malaria
improves patient survival targeting parasite stages, antiparasite drugs
alone may immediately reverse pathophysiological processes occluded
vessels. show thrombin, enzyme intimately involved the
clotting process, cleaves main parasite adhesin expressed surface of
irbc, thereby preventing reversing binding irbc endothelial cells. 
this beneficial effect thrombin achieved modified thrombins that
cause significantly less clotting vessel leakage preserving ability
to cleave parasite protein. results provide basis using modified 
thrombins adjunctive therapy severe malaria.
