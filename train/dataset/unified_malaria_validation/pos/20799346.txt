phosphorylation erythrocyte membrane proteins previously documented
following infection intracellular growth malarial parasite, plasmodium
falciparum red cells. much data dealt phosphorylation serine
residues. study, report detailed characterization phosphorylation
of serine tyrosine residues red cell membrane proteins following infection
by p falciparum. western blot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine and
anti-phosphoserine antibodies following 2-de conjunction double channel
laser-induced infrared fluorescence enabled accurate assessment of
phosphorylation changes. tyrosine phosphorylation band 3 represented the
earliest modification observed parasite development. band 3 tyrosine
phosphorylation observed ring stage appears control syk
kinase. serine tyrosine phosphorylation additional cytoskeletal,
trans-membrane membrane associated proteins documented intracellular
development parasite progressed. importantly, late schizont stage of
parasite maturation, observed widespread protein dephosphorylation. vitro
treatments caused distinct activation red cell tyrosine serine
kinases elicited phosphorylative patterns similar observed parasitized
red blood cell, suggesting primary involvement erythrocyte kinases.
identification tyrosine phosphorylations band 3, band 4.2, catalase and
actin previously described p. falciparum infected red
cells suggests new potential regulatory mechanisms could modify the
functions host cell membrane.
