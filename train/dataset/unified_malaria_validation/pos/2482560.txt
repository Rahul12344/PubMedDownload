the incidence progression coagulation abnormalities studied 52
patients acute falciparum malaria. patients prospectively divided
into 3 groups; severe (parasitaemia greater equal 5% vital organ
dysfunction), 12 patients; moderate (parasitaemia 1%- less 5% without
complications), 16 patients; mild (parasitaemia less 1%), 24 patients.
no case died developed clinical evidence disseminated intravascular
coagulation. conventional indices coagulation (prothrombin time, partial
thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, fibrin degradation products) usually within
the normal range reduced plasma concentrations antithrombin iii (at-iii)
levels noted groups, incidence significantly higher in
patients severe moderate malaria (83% 81%) compared mild
group (37%; p less 0.005). depletion at-iii associated with
thrombocytopenia, decreased at-iii activity elevated plasma concentrations of
thrombin-antithrombin iii complexes (p less 0.01), confirming activation 
the coagulation cascade increased clotting factor consumption. at-iii levels 
returned normal coincident clinical improvement. activation of
coagulation common sensitive measure disease activity acute
falciparum malaria. specific feature, evidence to
suggest primary pathological role severe infections.
