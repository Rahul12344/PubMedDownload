the tick-transmitted hemoparasite babesia bovis causes acute infection that
results persistence immunity challenge infection cattle that
control initial parasitemia. resolution acute infection this
protozoal pathogen believed dependent products activated
macrophages (mphi), including inflammatory cytokines nitric oxide (no) and
its derivatives. b. bovis stimulates inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) and
production bovine mphi, chemical donors inhibit growth 
b. bovis vitro. however, induction inflammatory cytokines mphi by
babesial parasites described, antiparasitic activity no
produced b. bovis-stimulated mphi definitively demonstrated. we
report monocyte-derived mphi activated b. bovis expressed enhanced levels
of inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), il-12, tumor necrosis
factor alpha important stimulating innate acquired immunity
against protozoal pathogens. furthermore, lipid fraction b. bovis-infected
erythrocytes stimulated inos expression production mphi. cocultures

parasite growth inhibition, suggesting additional factors contribute 
inhibition b. bovis replication. findings demonstrate b. bovis
induces innate immune response capable controlling parasite
replication could potentially result host survival parasite
