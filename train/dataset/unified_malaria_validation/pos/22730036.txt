in holoendemic plasmodium falciparum transmission areas, severe malaria primarily
occurs children aged <48 months manifests severe malarial anemia [sma; 
hemoglobin (hb) < 6.0 g/dl]. induction high levels prostaglandin-e(2)
(pge(2)) inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) important host-defense 
mechanism invading pathogens. previously shown cox-2-derived
pge(2) levels reduced children residing hyperendemic transmission
regions cerebral malaria mixed sequelae anemia and
hyperparasitemia. vitro studies demonstrated reduced pge(2)
was due downregulation cox-2 gene products following phagocytosis of
malarial pigment (hemozoin, pfhz). however, cox-2-pge(2) pathways the
impact naturally acquired pfhz erythropoietic responses been
determined children sma, plasma urinary bicyclo-pge(2)/creatinine and
leukocytic cox-2 transcripts determined parasitized children (<36 months)
stratified sma (n = 36) non-sma (hb ≥ 6.0 g/dl; n = 38). children with
sma significantly reduced plasma (p = 0.001) urinary (p < 0.001)
bicyclo-pge(2)/creatinine cox-2 transcripts (p = 0.007). a
significant positive association hb plasma (r = 0.363, p =
0.002) urinary (r = 0.500, p = 0.001)] bicyclo-pge(2)/creatinine.
furthermore, decreased systemic bicyclo-pge(2)/creatinine associated with
inefficient erythropoiesis (i.e., reticulocyte production index; rpi < 2.0, p =
0.026). additional analyses demonstrated plasma (p = 0.031) urinary (p =
0.070) bicyclo-pge(2)/creatinine cox-2 transcripts (p = 0.026) progressively 
declined increasing concentrations naturally acquired pfhz monocytes. 
results presented support model reduced cox-2-derived pge(2),
driven part naturally acquired pfhz monocytes, promotes decreased
erythropoietic responses children sma.
