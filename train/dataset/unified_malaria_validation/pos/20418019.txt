theileriosis tick-borne protozoan disease caused theileria species. the
theileria species classified two groups depending cell type in
which proliferate clinical symptoms. first group consists of
lymphoproliferative theileria species (t. parva t. annulata), mainly
proliferate lymphocytes, causing uncontrolled lymphocyte proliferation. the
other group consists nonlymphoproliferative theileria species (t.
orientalis, also known t. sergenti) proliferates erythrocytes and
causes hemolytic anemia. based reports generation antigen-specific
cd4(+) cd8(+) cells lymphoproliferative theileriosis, investigated
whether cells specific t. orientalis antigen present the
nonlymphoproliferative form disease. study, developed new
assay based enzyme-linked immunospot (elispot) detect interferon-gamma
(ifn-gamma)- interleukin-10 (il-10)-secreting cells series of
cryogenically preserved bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs). we
first determined ifn-gamma- il-10-secreting cells present in
pbmcs stimulating phytohemagglutinin l (pha-l=red kidney bean lectin
l, known cell stimulator), determined whether t.
orientalis-specific cells present t. orientalis-infected bovines.
peptides derived t. orientalis major piroplasm surface protein (mpsp) were
used t. orientalis-specific stimulator elispot assay, peptides
from glycoprotein b (gb) bovine herpes virus-1 (bhv-1) used a
bhv-1-specific stimulator control monitoring immune response.
compared results obtained using bhv-1 (gb peptides)-specific ifn-gamma
elispot assay assess bhv-1-immunized holsteins, prominent t. orientalis mpsp
peptide-specific ifn-gamma il-10 positive spots detected t.
orientalis-infected holsteins weak positive responses exhibited t.
orientalis-infected angus japanese black cattle. far aware, this
is first report show direct evidence presence t.
orientalis-specific cells t. orientalis-infected bovines using an
antigen-specific elispot assay system t. orientalis-specific, ifn-gamma-
and il-10-producing cells produced t. orientalis-infected holsteins.
