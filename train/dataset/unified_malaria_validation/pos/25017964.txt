natural hemozoin, nhz, avidly phagocytosed vivo vitro human
monocytes. persistence undigested β-hematin core nhz the
phagocyte lysosome long periods time modifies several cellular immune
functions. show nhz phagocytosis human primary monocytes severely
impaired chemotactic motility toward mcp-1, tnf, fmlp, approximately
80% each, diapedesis across confluent human umbilical vein
endothelial cell layer toward mcp-1 45±5%. inhibition observed with
latex-fed unfed monocytes. microscopic inspection revealed polarization
defects nhz-fed monocytes due irregular actin polymerization. phagocytosed 
nhz catalyzes peroxidation polyunsaturated fatty acids generation of
the highly reactive derivative 4-hydroxynonenal (4-hne). similar nhz
phagocytosis, exposure monocytes vivo-compatible 4-hne
concentrations inhibited cell motility presence absence of
chemotactic stimuli, suggesting severe impairment cytoskeleton dynamics.
consequently, 4-hne conjugates cytoskeleton proteins β-actin and
coronin-1a immunochemically identified nhz-fed monocytes mass
spectrometrically localized domains protein-protein interactions involved
in cytoskeleton reorganization cell motility. molecular functional
modifications actin coronin nhz/4-hne may also explain impaired
phagocytosis, another motility-dependent process previously described nhz-fed 
monocytes. studies show whether impaired monocyte motility may
contribute immunodepression frequent occurrence secondary
