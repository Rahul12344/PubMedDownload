this study carried two observational clinical studies. study 1
comprised 50 adult crossbred cattle naturally infected theileria annulata.
infected animals divided 4 subgroups different parasitaemia (<1%, 
1-3%, 3-5% >5%). study 2 comprised 20 adult crossbred cattle naturally
infected anaplasma marginale. infected animals divided 3 subgroups
with different parasitaemia (<10%, 10-20% 20-30%). study 1, significant 
negative correlation (p<0.001) observed parasitaemia superoxide
dismutase (sod). positive correlations (p<0.001) observed between
parasitaemia lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) mean corpuscular fragility
(mcf). study 2 positive correlations (p<0.05) observed among parasitaemia
and mcf ldh activity. sod activity negative correlation with
parasitaemia cattle parasitaemia lower 10% significant
correlation (p>0.05) observed sod activity parasitaemia cattle
with 10-20 20-30% parasitaemia. comparison studies came 
conclusion theileriosis severity disease increased anaemia,
mcf ldh activity increased sod activity decreased parasitaemia,
but anaplasmosis anaemia, mcf ldh activity increased any
parasitaemia sod activity decreased early advanced stages 
of disease.
