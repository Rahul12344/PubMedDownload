background: molecular mechanisms involved pathogenesis severe malaria
caused plasmodium falciparum fully understood. matrix
metalloproteinases (mmps) enzymes proteolytically degrade the
extracellular matrix nonmatrix substances various functions the
modulation immune response. key inhibitors mmps tissue
inhibitors metalloproteinases (timps).
methods: studied levels mmp-8, mmp-9, timp-1, timp-2 admission and
after 24 h, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, serum specimens from
50 gabonese children severe malaria, 43 children uncomplicated malaria,
and 27 healthy control children.
results: serum mmp-8 timp-1 levels significantly higher severe
malaria uncomplicated malaria groups, compared control
group (p < .001). timp-1 levels significantly higher patients severe
malaria, compared patients uncomplicated malaria (p < .001).
high timp-1 levels significantly correlated malaria severity, as
determined simplified multiorgan dysfunction score (spearman
rank-correlation coefficient, 0.55; p < .001).
conclusions: timp-1 associated signs symptoms severe malaria.
mmp-8 levels elevated patients severe uncomplicated p. falciparum 
malaria. mmps timps may relevant pathogenesis severe malaria,
either proteolytic enzymes degrade extracellular matrix as
effectors regulators immune response.
