objectives: human plasmodium knowlesi infections reported several 
south-east asian countries, excluding india, drug susceptibility profile 
in mixed-infection cases remains unknown.
methods: chloroquine resistance transporter (crt) dihydrofolate reductase
(dhfr) genes p. knowlesi plasmodium species sequenced from
clinical isolates obtained malaria patients living andaman and
nicobar islands, india. merozoite surface protein-1 18s rrna genes p. 
knowlesi also sequenced isolates.
results: among 445 samples analysed, 53 p. knowlesi-specific
gene sequences. 3 53 cases (5.66%) p. knowlesi monoinfection,
the rest coinfected plasmodium falciparum (86.79%, n = 46) or
plasmodium vivax (7.55%, n = 4), none plasmodium malariae plasmodium 
ovale. discordance drug resistance-associated mutations among
the coinfecting plasmodium species. p. knowlesi isolates
contained wild-type sequences, p. falciparum isolates mutations 
crt dhfr marker genes associated higher level chloroquine and
antifolate drug resistance, respectively. mutation pattern indicates the
same patient, mixed infection, may harbouring drug-susceptible p.
knowlesi parasite highly drug-resistant p. falciparum parasite.
conclusions: larger human population south-east asia may risk p.
knowlesi infection reported far. different drug susceptibility
genotypes p. knowlesi coinfecting plasmodium species mixed
infections adds new dimension malaria control programme, requiring
formulation appropriate drug policy.
