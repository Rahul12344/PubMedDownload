background: humans living regions high falciparum malaria transmission
intensity harbour multi-strain infections comprised several genetically
distinct malaria haplotypes. number distinct malaria parasite haplotypes
identified infected human host given time referred the
complexity infection (coi). study, amplicon-based deep sequencing
method targeting plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (pfama1) was
utilized (1) investigate relationship p. falciparum prevalence and
coi, (2) explore population genetic structure p. falciparum parasites
from malaria asymptomatic individuals participating 2007 demographic and
health survey (dhs) democratic republic congo (drc), (3) explore
selection pressures geospatially divergent parasite populations comparing
ama1 amino acid frequencies drc mali.
results: total 900 p. falciparum infections across 11 drc provinces were
examined. deep sequencing individuals, coi analysis, pools of
individuals, examine population structure, identified 77 unique pfama1
haplotypes. majority individual infections (64.5%) contained polyclonal
(coi > 1) malaria infections based presence genetically distinct pfama1
haplotypes. minimal correlation coi malaria prevalence as
determined sensitive real-time pcr identified. population genetic analyses
revealed extensive haplotype diversity, vast majority shared
across sites. ama1 amino acid frequencies similar parasite
populations drc mali.
conclusions: amplicon-based deep sequencing useful tool detection of
multi-strain infections aid understanding antigen
heterogeneity potential malaria vaccine candidates, population genetics of
malaria parasites, factors influence complex, polyclonal malaria
infections. ama1 diverse markers balancing selection may
perform well understanding coi, may offer little geographic temporal 
discrimination parasite populations.
