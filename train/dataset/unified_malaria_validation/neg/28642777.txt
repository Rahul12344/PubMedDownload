artemisinin sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide extracted traditional 
chinese medicinal plant artemisia annua. artemisinin-based combination therapies 
(acts) recommended best treatment malaria world health
organization (who). phytohormone jasmonic acid (ja) light promote
artemisinin biosynthesis a. annua. interestingly, found increase
of artemisinin biosynthesis ja dependent light. however, the
relationship two signal pathways mediated ja light remains
unclear. here, collected a. annua seedlings 24 h continuous light
(light), 24 h dark treatment (dark), 4 h meja treatment continuous
light conditions (light-meja-4h) 4 h meja treatment dark conditions
(dark-meja-4h) performed transcriptome sequencing using illumina hiseq
4000 system. total 266.7 million clean data produced assembled into
185,653 unigenes, average length 537 bp. among them, 59,490 unigenes
were annotated classified based public information. differential
expression analyses performed light dark, light and
light-meja-4h, dark dark-meja-4h, light-meja-4h, dark-meja-4h,
respectively. furthermore, transcription factor (tf) analysis revealed 1588 
tfs identified divided 55 tf families, 284 tfs down-regulated 
in dark relative light 96 tfs up-regulated light-meja-4h
relative light. 8 tfs selected candidates regulating the
artemisinin biosynthesis one validated involved in
artemisinin transcriptional regulation dual-luciferase (dual-luc) assay. the
transcriptome data shown study offered comprehensive transcriptional
expression pattern influenced meja light a. annua seedling, which
will serve valuable resource studies transcriptional
regulation mechanisms underlying artemisinin biosynthesis.
