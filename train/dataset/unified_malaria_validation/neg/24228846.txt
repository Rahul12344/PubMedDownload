background: primaquine essential malaria control elimination since 
is available drug preventing multiple clinical attacks relapses of
plasmodium vivax. also therapy sexual stages of
plasmodium falciparum infectious mosquitoes, thus useful preventing 
malaria transmission. however, difficulties diagnosing glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase deficiency (g6pdd) greatly hinder primaquine's widespread use, as
this common genetic disorder makes patients susceptible potentially severe and
fatal primaquine-induced haemolysis. risk outcome varies widely
among g6pd gene variants.
methods: literature review conducted identify surveys g6pd variant
frequencies among representative population groups. informative surveys were
assembled two map series: (1) showing relative proportions 
different variants among g6pdd individuals; (2) showing allele
frequencies g6pd variants based population surveys without prior g6pdd
screening.
results: variants showed conspicuous geographic patterns. limited repertoire of
variants tested across sub-saharan africa, nevertheless indicated
low genetic heterogeneity predominated g6pd a(-202a) mutation, though
other mutations common western africa. severe g6pd mediterranean
variant widespread across western asia. east, sharp shift in
variants identified, high variant heterogeneity populations of
china asia-pacific single variant dominated.
conclusions: g6pd variants exhibited distinctive region-specific distributions
with important primaquine policy implications. relative homogeneity the
americas, africa, western asia contrasted sharply heterogeneity of
variants china, southeast asia oceania. findings inform
rational risk assessments primaquine developing public health strategies
for malaria control elimination, support future development of
regionally targeted policies. major knowledge gaps highlighted strongly 
advocate investigation g6pd variant diversity their
primaquine-sensitivity phenotypes.
