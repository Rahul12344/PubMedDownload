resurgence malaria attributed, part, development of
resistance anopheles gambiae, principal vector disease, various
insecticidal compounds permethrin. permethrin, neurotoxicant, widely
used impregnate mosquito nets. alternative strategy control mosquitoes
is use bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis (bti) no
observable resistance field bacterium. bti kills mosquitoes by
targeting cadherin molecules residing midgut epithelium larvae the
insect. cry proteins (cry4a, cry4b, cry10a cry11a) produced bacterium 
during sporulation phase life cycle bind cadherin molecules,
which serve receptors proteins. cry proteins variable
specificity variety mosquitoes, including culex aedes well as
anopheles. importantly, selective mosquitocidal action occasioned binding
of respective cry toxins cadherins distinctive individual mosquito
species. differential fractionation four cry proteins novel bti
isolate (m1) cloning expression genes escherichia coli
revealed cry4b cry protein exerts insecticidal action
against an. gambiae. indeed, permethrin-resistant strain 
the mosquito. three cry proteins ineffective. multiple sequence
alignments four cry proteins revealed divergent sequence motif the
cry4b toxin, likely determines binding toxin cognate
receptor, bt-r3, an. gambiae specific toxicity. model showing
cry4b toxin binding bt-r3 presented.
