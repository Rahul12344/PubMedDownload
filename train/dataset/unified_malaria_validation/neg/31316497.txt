t cells play significant roles plasmodium falciparum infections. their
regulation immune response symptomatic children malaria been
deemed necessary prevent immune associated pathology. study, we
phenotypically characterized expression cell inhibitory(pd-1, ctla-4)
and senescent markers (cd28(-), cd57) children symptomatic malaria,
asymptomatic malaria healthy controls using flow cytometry. observed
increased expression cell exhaustion senescence markers the
symptomatic children compared asymptomatic healthy controls. cell
senescence markers highly expressed cd8 cells cd4 cells.
asymptomatically infected children comparable levels markers with
healthy controls except cd8+ pd-1+ cells significantly elevated 
in asymptomatic children. also, using multivariate regression analysis,
ctla-4 marker could predict parasitaemia level. results
suggest upregulation immune exhaustion senescence markers 
symptomatic malaria may affect effector function cells leading to
inefficient clearance parasites, hence inability develop sterile
immunity malaria.
