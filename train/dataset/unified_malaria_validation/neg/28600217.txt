cell traversal protein ookinetes sporozoites (celtos) new malaria
vaccine candidate antigen. since one main challenges malaria vaccine
development extensive antigenic diversity parasite, local and
global gene diversity analysis particular importance. therefore, this
study, genetic diversity pvceltos gene investigated among iranian p.
vivax isolates (n=46) compared available worldwide pvceltos sequences.
one synonymous (c109a) three amino acid replacements (v118l, k178t, and
g179r) observed iranian pvceltos sequences compare sal-1 sequence
leading five haplotypes including pvcelt-a (gsvkgl, 13%), pvcelt-b (gslkgl,
50%), pvcelt-c (gsltgl, 17.4%), pvcelt-d (gsvtgl, 13%) pvcelt-e (gsltrl,
6.5%). however, amino acid replacements observed six positions (g10s,
s40n, v118l/m, k178t, g179r/d l181r) pvceltos antigen global isolates
leading 11 distinct haplotypes. pvcelt-a pvcelt-b haplotypes most
common haplotypes world. overall nucleotide diversity iranian
isolates 0.00169, while, level nucleotide diversity ranged from
0.00252 thailand 0.00022 peru populations world. analysis
of snps relation predicted immunodominant regions revealed 
k178t g179r snps located putative b-cell epitopes. replacements
were located cd4+ and/or cd8+ t-cell epitopes. however, majority of
epitopes located conserved regions. knowing whether changes may
alter affinity epitopes antibodies and/or mhc molecules remains to
be investigated experimental studies. conclusion, present study showed 
a limited genetic diversity pvceltos gene among global clinical
isolates regarded potential candidate antigen apply for
vivax-based malaria vaccine development.
