genetic vaccination, consisting delivering genetically engineered plasmid
dna non-viral vector technique tissue, currently great
interest. new delivery technique including dna transfer electroporation
recently greatly improved potency concept. avoids step
of producing recombinant protein, particularly use studying the
immunogenic properties large proteins. describe use of
electroporation mediated dna immunization identify important protective
epitopes large var2csa protein plasmodium falciparum implicated 
the pathology placental malaria. immunizing mice rabbit dna plasmids 
encoding different fragments var2csa leads high titer antisera. moreover an
n-terminal region protein found induce protective functional
antibodies.
