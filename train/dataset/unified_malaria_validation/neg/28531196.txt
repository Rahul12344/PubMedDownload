glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency hemoglobin e (hbe, Î²26
glu-lys) two common red cell disorders southeast asia. g6pd deficiency
produces hemolytic anemia, triggered certain drugs infections.
hbe asymptomatic manifested microcytic, minimally hemolytic anemia.
the association g6pd deficiency hbe little understood. study 
aimed investigate g6pd deficiency hbe kachin ethnic group the
china-myanmar border area. g6pd enzyme activity measured using quantitative
g6pd assay, g6pd variants genotyped snapshot assay, hbe gene
mutation identified amplification refractory mutation system and
subsequently confirmed using reverse dot blot hybridization assay 100
unrelated individuals study area. g6pd enzyme activity ranged 0.4 
24.7 u/g hb, six males severe g6pd deficiency (<0.12-1.2 u/g hb), while
six males 12 females mild g6pd deficiency (>1.2-4.5 u/g hb). among 24
g6pd-deficient subjects, 22 (92%) mahidol 487g>a mutation (12 male
hemizygotes, one female homozygote, nine female heterozygotes), the
g6pd genotypes two female subjects unknown. hbe identified 39
subjects (20 males 19 females), including 15 hbee (seven males eight
females) 24 hbae (13 males 11 females). twenty-three subjects
co-inherited g6pd deficiency hbe (22 hbae one hbee).
whereas mean hb levels significantly different hba hbe
groups, g6pd-deficient males significantly lower hb levels g6pd-normal
males (p < 0.05, t-test). however, noteworthy two g6pd-deficient
hemizygous males hbae severely anemic hb levels 50 g/l. this
study revealed high prevalence co-inheritance g6pd deficiency hbae 
the kachin ethnicity, potential interaction g6pd mahidol 487g>a 
hbae males leading severe anemia. presence 6% males severe g6pd
deficiency raised major concern use primaquine radical cure of
vivax malaria.
