the incompleteness proteome structure function annotation critical
problem biologists and, particular, severely limits interpretation of
high-throughput next-generation experiments. developed proteome
annotation pipeline based structure prediction, function structure
annotations generated using integration sequence comparison, fold
recognition, grid-computing-enabled de novo structure prediction. predict 
protein domain boundaries three-dimensional (3d) structures protein
domains 94 genomes (including human, arabidopsis, rice, mouse, fly, yeast,
escherichia coli, worm). de novo structure predictions distributed 
grid 1.5 million cpus worldwide (world community grid). generated
significant numbers new confident fold annotations (9% domains are
otherwise unannotated genomes). demonstrate predicted structures
can combined annotations gene ontology database predict new
and specific molecular functions.
