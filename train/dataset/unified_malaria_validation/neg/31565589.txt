thalassemia genetic disorder due deletion mutation gene for
alpha beta chain hemoglobin. gaucher's disease (gd) characterized a
deficiency lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase occurs due to
mutations gba1 gene chromosome 1. thalassemia gd overlapping
clinical manifestations present features anemia,
hepatosplenomegaly, skeletal involvement. this creates diagnostic conundrum
for physicians. present case 11-month-old female presented with
fever, increasing paleness, labored breathing. recent history of
uncross-matched transfusion. child showed signs anemic failure. physical
exam findings strongly pointed towards hemolytic anemia due thalassemia major.
genetic analysis confirmed homozygosity fr 8-9 mutation confirming beta
thalassemia major. bicytopenia along visceromegaly indicated malaria or
storage diseases. enzyme analysis revealed low levels beta-glucocerebrosidase 
with normal acid sphingomyelinase levels confirming gd. case, report
the association beta thalassemia major gd rare entity. the
report highlights need independent assessment disorders have
similar presentations avoid missing associated disorder.
