dna aptamers significant potential diagnostic therapeutic agents, but
the paucity dna aptamer-target structures limits understanding their
molecular binding mechanisms. here, report distorted hairpin structure 
dna aptamer complex important diagnostic target malaria:
plasmodium falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (pfldh). aptamers selected dna
library highly specific discriminatory plasmodium opposed to
human lactate dehydrogenase counterselection strategy used during
selection. isothermal titration calorimetry revealed aptamer binding pfldh
with dissociation constant 42 nm 2:1 protein:aptamer molar
stoichiometry. dissociation constants derived electrophoretic mobility shift
assays surface plasmon resonance experiments consistent. the
aptamer:protein complex crystal structure solved 2.1-Ã¥ resolution,
revealing two aptamers bind per pfldh tetramer. aptamers showed unique
distorted hairpin structure complex pfldh, displaying watson-crick
base-paired stem together two distinct loops one base flipped 
by specific interactions pfldh. aptamer binding specificity dictated by
extensive interactions one aptamer loops pfldh loop is
absent human lactate dehydrogenase. conjugated aptamer gold
nanoparticles demonstrated specificity colorimetric detection pfldh
over human lactate dehydrogenase. unique distorted hairpin aptamer complex
provides perspective aptamer-mediated molecular recognition may guide
rational design better aptamers malaria diagnostics.
