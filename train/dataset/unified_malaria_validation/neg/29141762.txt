we evaluated therapeutic efficacy artemether-lumefantrine (al) fixed-dose 
combination treat uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria cruzeiro do
sul, acre state, amazon region brazil. december 2015 may
2016, enrolled 79 patients, 5-79 years old fever history fever in
the previous 48 hours p. falciparum monoinfection confirmed microscopy.
attempts made provide direct observation phone reminders six
doses al, patients followed-up 28 days. al well tolerated,
with adverse events causing treatment interruption. one 74
patients completed 28-day follow-up adequate clinical and
parasitologic response = 98.6% (95% ci: 93.2-100%). could amplify one 
isolate case recurrent infection differentiate between
recrudescence reinfection. five (6.3%) patients demonstrated persistent
asexual parasitemia day 3, none met definition early treatment
failure. found mutations selected kelch13 gene domains, known be
associated artemisinin resistance p. falciparum isolates day 0.
these results strongly support continued use al first-line therapy
for uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria acre. routine monitoring vivo
drug efficacy coupled molecular surveillance drug resistance markers
remains critical.
