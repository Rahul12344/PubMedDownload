spatial organization chromosome territories important maintenance of
genomic stability regulation gene expression. recent studies shown
tissue-specific features chromosome attachments nuclear envelope in
various organisms including malaria mosquitoes. however, spatial
characteristics nucleus organization, like volume shape chromosome
territories, studied anopheles. conducted thorough analysis
of tissue-specific features x chromosome nucleolus volume shape in
follicular epithelium nurse cells anopheles atroparvus ovaries using a
modern open-source software. dna polytene x chromosome ovarian nurse 
cells obtained microdissection used template for
amplification degenerate oligo primers. fluorescently labeled x chromosome
painting probe hybridized formaldehyde-fixed ovaries mosquitoes using
a 3d-fish method. nucleolus stained immunostaining an
anti-fibrillarin antibody. analysis conducted tango-a software a
chromosome spatial organization analysis. show volume position of
the x chromosome tissue-specific characteristics. unlike nurse cell nuclei, 
the growth follicular epithelium nuclei accompanied the
proportional growth x chromosome. however, shape x chromosome
does differ tissues. dynamics x chromosome attachment 
regions location tissue-specific correlated process of
nucleus growth follicular epithelium nurse cells.
