background: accuracy conclusions vivo efficacy anti-malarial
drug trials depends distinguishing recrudescences re-infections
which accomplished genotyping genes coding p. falciparum merozoite surface 
1 (msp1) msp2. however, reliability pcr analysis depends the
genetic markers' allelic diversity variant frequency. study the
genetic diversity genes coding msp1 msp2 obtained p.
falciparum parasites circulating yemen.
methods: blood samples collected 511 patients fever screened
for malaria parasites using giemsa-stained blood films. total 74 samples were
infected p. falciparum, genetic diversity assessed nested pcr
targeting pfmsp1 (block2) pfmsp2 (block 3).
results: overall, 58%, 28% 54% isolates harboured parasites the
pfmsp1 k1, mad20 ro33 allelic families, 55% 89% harboured of
the pfmsp2 fc27 3d7 allelic families, respectively. genetic makers, 
the multiplicity infection (moi) significantly higher isolates 
from foothills/coastland areas compared highland
(p<0.05). pfmsp2 higher number distinct allelic variants pfmsp1 (20
vs 11). expected heterozygosity (he) pfmsp1 pfmsp2 0.82 and
0.94, respectively. nonetheless, bias frequency distribution the
pfmsp1 allelic variants noted areas, pfmsp2 the
samples collected highland areas.
conclusions: significant differences complexity allelic diversity of
pfmsp1 pfmsp2 genes areas probably reflect differences the
intensity malaria transmission. biased distribution allelic variants
suggests yemen pfmsp1 used pcr correction vivo
clinical trials outcomes, caution exercised employing
pfmsp2.
