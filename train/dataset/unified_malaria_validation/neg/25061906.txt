super-resistant plasmodium falciparum threatens effectiveness of
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine intermittent preventive treatment malaria during
pregnancy. characterized a581g pfdhps mutation background of
the double-mutant pfdhps triple-mutant pfdhfr. using samples collected
during 2004-2008, investigated evolutionary origin a581g mutation
by characterizing microsatellite diversity flanking pfdhps triple-mutant
(437g+540e+581g) alleles 3 locations eastern africa comparing with
double-mutant (437g+540e) alleles area. ethiopia, alleles
derived 1 lineage distinct uganda tanzania.
uganda tanzania triple mutants derived previously characterized
southeastern africa double-mutant lineage. a581g mutation occurred
multiple times local pfdhps double-mutant backgrounds; however, novel
microsatellite allele incorporated tanzania lineage since 2004
illustrates local expansion emergent triple-mutant lineages.
