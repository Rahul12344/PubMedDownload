aotus nancymaae, owl monkey, provides useful laboratory model research 
to develop drugs vaccines human falciparum malaria; however, many
plasmodium falciparum parasites unable invade a. nancymaae erythrocytes,
rendering parasites noninfective monkeys. previous work, we
identified key polymorphism determined inheritance erythrocyte
invasion genetic cross two p. falciparum clones virulent (gb4) 
or noninfective (7g8) a. nancymaae. polymorphism, isoleucine-to-lysine
polymorphism position 204 (i204k) gb4 erythrocyte binding protein
pfrh5, nevertheless found several p. falciparum lines could
also invade a. nancymaae erythrocytes. alternative pfrh5 polymorphisms occur at
different positions virulent parasites, additional polymorphisms are
found p. falciparum parasites cannot infect a. nancymaae. allelic
replacement methods, introduced polymorphisms a.
nancymaae-virulent noninfective parasites codons 204, 347, 358, 362, 410,
and 429 endogenous pfrh5 gene noninfective 7g8 line. 7g8
transformants expressing polymorphisms a. nancymaae-virulent parasites
show neuraminidase-sensitive (sialic acid-dependent) invasion monkey
erythrocytes, whereas 7g8 transformants expressing pfrh5 alleles of
noninfective parasites show little invasion erythrocytes.
parasites harboring pfrh5 polymorphisms 204k 204r also able invade rat 
erythrocytes differentially sensitive removal surface sialic
acids neuraminidase. studies offer insights pfrh5
receptor-binding domain interactions support invasion various
primate rodent erythrocytes p. falciparum.
