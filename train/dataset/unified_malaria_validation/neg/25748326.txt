plasmodium vivax infections often recur due relapse hypnozoites the
liver. malaria-endemic areas, tools distinguish relapse reinfection
are needed. applied amplicon deep sequencing p. vivax isolates 78
cambodian volunteers, nearly one-third suffered recurrence median of
68 days. deep sequencing highly variable region p. vivax merozoite
surface protein 1 gene revealed impressive diversity-generating 67 unique
haplotypes detecting average 3.6 cocirculating parasite clones within
individuals, compared 2.1 clones detected combination 3 microsatellite
markers. diversity enabled scheme classify half recurrences 
probable relapses based low probability reinfection multiple
recurring variants. areas high p. vivax diversity, targeted deep sequencing
can help detect genetic signatures relapse, key evaluating antivivax
interventions achieving better understanding relapse-reinfection
epidemiology.
