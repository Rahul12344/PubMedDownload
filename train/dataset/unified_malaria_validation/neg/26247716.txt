systems biology approaches based gene expression bioinformatics
analysis successful predicting functions many genes in
plasmodium falciparum, protozoan parasite responsible deaths
due malaria. however, approaches provide information the
biological processes active parasite vivo complicated 
malaria conditions scarcely deployed. report analysis 
weighted gene co-expression based network p. falciparum, non-cerebral
clinical complications. gene expression profiles 20 p. falciparum clinical
isolates utilized construct same. total 20 highly interacting
modules identified post network creation. 12 modules, least
10% member genes, found differentially regulated parasites
from patient isolates showing complications, compared from
patients uncomplicated disease. enrichment analysis helped identify
biological processes like oxidation-reduction, electron transport chain, protein 
synthesis, ubiquitin dependent catabolic processes, rna binding purine
nucleotide metabolic processes associated modules. additionally,
for module, highly connected hub genes identified. detailed functional 
analysis many these, known annotated functions underline their
importance parasite development survival. suggests, hub
genes unknown functions may also playing crucial roles parasite
biology, and, potential candidates intervention strategies.
