genetic screening using random transposon insertions powerful tool for
uncovering biology prokaryotes, whole-genome saturating screens have
been performed multiple organisms. eukaryotes, screens proven
more problematic, part lack sensitive robust system
for identifying transposon insertion sites. describe quantitative
insertion-site sequencing, qiseq, uses custom library preparation and
illumina sequencing technology able identify insertion sites 
the 5' 3' ends transposon, providing inbuilt level validation.
the approach developed using piggybac mutants human malaria parasite
plasmodium falciparum applicable many eukaryotic genomes. 
qiseq proved accurate, confirming known sites >100 mutants, sensitive,
identifying monitoring sites >10,000-fold dynamic range sequence
counts. applying qiseq uncloned parasites shortly transfections revealed
multiple insertions mixed populations suggests >4000 independent
mutants could generated relatively modest scales transfection,
providing clear pathway genome-scale screens p. falciparum qiseq also
used monitor growth pools previously cloned mutants reproducibly
differentiated deleterious neutral mutations competitive growth.
among mutants fitness defects mutant piggybac insertion
immediately upstream kelch protein k13 gene associated artemisinin
resistance, implying mutants gene may competitive fitness costs.
qiseq potential enable scale-up piggybac-mediated genetics
across multiple eukaryotic systems.
