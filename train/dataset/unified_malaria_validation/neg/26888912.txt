objectives: available antimalarial drugs ineffective the
plasmodium falciparum transmission stages, new drugs parasite's
gametocytes urgently needed combat malaria globally. unique biology of
gametocytes requires assays need specific, faithfully monitor
anti-gametocyte activity, easy perform, cheap scalable to
high-throughput screening (hts).
methods: developed hts cell-based assay p. falciparum gametocytes
specifically expressing potent luciferase. confirm hts hit activity for
several parasite genotypes, luciferase assay gametocyte lactate
dehydrogenase (ldh) assay, usable parasite isolate, compared by
screening antimalarial drugs determining ic50 values anti-gametocyte hits 
from 'malaria box' early- late-stage gametocytes.
results: comparison two assays, conducted early late
gametocyte stages, revealed excellent correlation (r(2) > 0.9) ic50
values obtained respective readouts. differences susceptibility to
drugs compounds two parasite developmental stages were
consistently measured assays.
conclusions: work indicates luciferase gametocyte ldh assays
are interchangeable specific advantages exploited design
an hts pipeline leading new transmission-blocking compounds. results from
these assays consistently defined gametocyte chemical susceptibility profile,
relevant planning future drug discovery strategies.
