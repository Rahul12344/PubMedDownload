in sub-saharan africa (ssa), burden noncommunicable diseases (ncds) is
rising disproportionately comparison rest world, affecting
urban, semi-urban rural dwellers alike. ncds predicted surpass
infections like human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis malaria the
leading cause mortality ssa next decade. heart failure (hf) the
dominant form cardiovascular disease (cvd), leading cause ncd ssa.
the main causes hf ssa hypertension, cardiomyopathies, rheumatic heart 
disease, pericardial disease, lesser extent, coronary heart disease. 
these, cardiomyopathies deserve greater attention relatively
poor understanding mechanisms disease, poor outcomes the
disproportionate impact young, economically active individuals.
morphofunctionally, cardiomyopathies classified dilated, hypertrophic,
restrictive arrhythmogenic; regardless classification, least half of
these inherited forms cvd. review, summarise studies that
have investigated incidence cardiomyopathy across africa, focus 
the inherited cardiomyopathies. also review data molecular genetic
underpinnings cardiomyopathy africa, striking lack of
studies reporting genetics cardiomyopathy. highlight impact that
genetic testing, candidate gene screening, association studies next
generation sequencing technologies whole exome sequencing targeted
resequencing understanding cardiomyopathy africa. finally,
we emphasise need future studies fill large gaps knowledge in
relation genetics inherited cardiomyopathies africa.
