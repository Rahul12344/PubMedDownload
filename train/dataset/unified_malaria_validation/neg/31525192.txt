strongyloidiasis neglected tropical disease caused human infective
nematodes strongyloides stercoralis, strongyloides fuelleborni fuelleborni and
strongyloides fuelleborni kellyi. previous large-scale studies exploring the
genetic diversity important genus focused southeast asia, 
small number isolates usa, switzerland, australia several african
countries genotyped. consequently, little known global
distribution geographic sub-variants nematodes genetic
diversity exists within genus strongyloides generally. extracted dna 
from human, dog primate feces containing strongyloides, collected from
several countries representing inhabited continents. using genotyping assay
adapted deep amplicon sequencing illumina miseq platform, sequenced
the hyper-variable hyper-variable iv regions strongyloides 18s rrna 
gene fragment mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1)
gene specimens. report several novel findings including unique s.
stercoralis s. fuelleborni genotypes, first identifications a
previously unknown s. fuelleborni infecting humans within australia. expand on
an existing strongyloides genotyping scheme accommodate s. fuelleborni and
these novel genotypes. so, compare data 18s cox1
sequences s. fuelleborni s. stercoralis available genbank (to our
knowledge), overlap sequences generated using approach. this
analysis represents 1,000 sequences collected diverse hosts and
locations, representing inhabited continents, allows truly global
understanding population genetic structure strongyloides species
infecting humans, non-human primates, domestic dogs.
