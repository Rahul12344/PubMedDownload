mosquito-borne diseases, malaria, dengue chikungunya, cause morbidity
and mortality around world. recent advances gene drives produced
control methods could theoretically modify populations disease
vector, single release, making whole species less able transmit
pathogens. ability caused excitement, prospect global
eradication mosquito-borne diseases, concern around safeguards. drive
mechanisms require individuals released high frequency genes
will spread therefore desirable potentially localised and
reversible. include underdominance-based strategies use the
reproductive parasite wolbachia here, review recent advances practical
applications mathematical analyses threshold-dependent gene drives
with focus implementation aedes aegypti, highlighting mechanisms
and role fitness costs introduction frequencies. drawing the
parallels systems offers useful insights practical, controlled
application localised drives, allows us assess requirements needed 
for gene drive reversal.
