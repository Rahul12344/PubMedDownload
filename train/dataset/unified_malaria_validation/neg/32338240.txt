avian malaria mosquito-borne disease caused plasmodium spp. protozoa.
although parasites extensively studied north america and
eurasia, knowledge diversity plasmodium, vectors avian hosts in
africa scarce. study, report natural malarial infections in
free-ranging sparrows (passer domesticus) sampled giza governorate, egypt.
parasites morphologically characterized plasmodium cathemerium based on
the examination thin blood smears avian host. sequencing fragment
of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene showed parasite corresponded to
lineage padom02. phylogenetic analysis showed parasite closely
related lineages serau01 padom09, attributed p.
cathemerium. experimental infection culex pipiens complex successful, with
ookinetes first detected 1-day post infection (dpi), oocysts 4 dpi and
sporozoites 6 dpi. massive infection salivary glands sporozoites
corroborates cx. pipiens complex competent vector padom02. our
findings confirm plasmodium lineage padom02 infects sparrows urban areas 
along nile river, egypt, corroborate cx. pipiens complex highly
competent vector parasites. furthermore, results demonstrate that
this lineage corresponds morphospecies p. cathemerium p. relictum 
as previously believed.
