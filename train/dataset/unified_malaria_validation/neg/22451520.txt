an immunomodulatory role arthropod saliva well documented, but
evidence effect plasmodium sp. infectiousness remains controversial.
mosquito saliva may orient immune response toward th2 profile, thereby
priming th2 response subsequent antigens, including plasmodium.
orientation toward th1 versus th2 profile promotes igg ige proliferation,
respectively, former crucial development efficient
antiparasite immune response. assessed direct effect mosquito
bites density plasmodium falciparum asexual parasites the
prevalence gametocytes chronic, asymptomatic infections longitudinal
cohort study seasonal transmission. additionally correlated these
parasitological measures ige igg antiparasite anti-salivary gland
extract titers. mosquito biting density positively correlated the
asexual parasite density asexual parasite prevalence negatively
correlated gametocyte prevalence. individual anti-salivary gland ige titers 
were also negatively correlated gametocyte carriage strongly
positively correlated antiparasite ige titers, consistent the
hypothesis mosquito bites predispose individuals develop ige
antiparasite response. provide evidence mosquito bites impact 
asymptomatic infections differentially production asexual and
sexual parasites. increased research focus immunological impact of
mosquito bites asymptomatic infections warranted, establish whether 
strategies targeting immune response saliva reduce duration of
infection onward transmission parasite.
