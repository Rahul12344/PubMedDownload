threats encountered humans expansions throughout globe. numerous 
studies identified immunity host defence genes among the

agents imposing selective pressures remain, cases, elusive, the
impact several pathogens, notably malaria cholera, described.
however, past selection infectious diseases may fitness costs
upon environmental changes, potentially leading maladaptation and
immunopathology.
