plasmodium calcium dependent protein kinase (cdpk1) required the
development sexual stages mosquito. addition, proposed play
an essential role parasite's invasive stages possibly the
regulation actinomyosin motor micronemal secretion. demonstrate
that plasmodium berghei cdpk1 dispensable parasite's erythrocytic and
pre-erythrocytic stages. successfully disrupted p. berghei cdpk1 (pbcdpk1) 
homologous recombination. recovery erythrocytic stage parasites lacking
pbcdpk1 (pbcdpk1-) demonstrated pbcdpk1 essential erythrocytic
invasion intra-erythrocytic development. study pbcdpk1's role in
sporozoites liver stage parasites, generated conditional mutant (cdpk1
cko). phenotypic characterization cdpk1 cko sporozoites demonstrated that
cdpk1 redundant dispensable invasion mammalian hepatocytes, 
egress parasites infected hepatocytes subsequent
erythrocytic cycle. conclude p. berghei cdpk1 plays essential role
only mosquito sexual stages.
