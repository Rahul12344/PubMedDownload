ribosome inactivating proteins (rips) rna n-glycosidases depurinate a
specific adenine residue conserved sarcin/ricin loop 28s rrna. 
occurrence rip genes described wide range plant taxa, well
as several species bacteria fungi. remarkable case presence of
these genes metazoans belonging culicinae subfamily. reported that
these genes derived single horizontal gene transfer event, likely
from bacterial donor species. moreover, shown evidence mosquito
rip genes evolving purifying selection, suggesting toxins
have acquired functional role organisms. present work, we
characterized intra-specific sequence variability aedes aegypti rip genes 
(ripae1, ripae2, ripae3) tested expression mrna level. our
results show ripae2 ripae3 transcribed polyadenylated, their
expression levels modulated across developmental stages. varibility among
genes observed, including existence null alleles ripae1 and
ripae2, variants showing partial deletions. results support
the existence physiological function foreign genes mosquitoes. 
the possible nature functionality discussed.
