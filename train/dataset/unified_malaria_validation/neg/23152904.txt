background: plasmodium falciparum infection, complement receptor-1 (cr1) on
erythrocyte's surface abo blood group play important roles formation of
rosettes presumed contributory pathogenesis severe
malaria. although several studies attempted determine association 
cr1 polymorphisms severe malaria, observations remain inconsistent.
therefore, case control study meta-analysis performed address this
issue.
methods: common cr1 polymorphisms (intron 27 exon 22) blood group were
typed 353 cases severe malaria (sm) [97 cerebral malaria (cm), 129
multi-organ dysfunction (mod), 127 non-cerebral severe malaria (ncsm)], 141
un-complicated malaria 100 healthy controls endemic region odisha,
india. relevant publications meta-analysis searched database.
results: homozygous polymorphisms cr1 intron 27 exon 22 (tt gg)
and alleles (t g) associated low expression cr1 red blood
cells, conferred significant protection cm, mod malaria deaths.
combined analysis showed significant association blood group b/intron
27-aa/exon 22-aa susceptibility sm (cm mod). meta-analysis revealed
that cr1 exon 22 low expression polymorphism significantly associated with
protection severe malaria.
conclusions: results present study demonstrate common cr1
variants significantly protect severe malaria endemic area.
