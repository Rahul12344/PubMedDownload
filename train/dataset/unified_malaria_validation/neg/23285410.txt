a linkage presence sickle haemoglobin (hbs) protection from
malaria infection clinical manifestations certain areas suspected from
early observations progressively elucidated recent studies. research 
has confirmed abovementioned connection, also clarified such
protection may abolished coexistence sickle cell trait (hbs trait) and
alpha thalassemia, may explain relatively low incidence hbs trait in
the mediterranean. mechanisms protective effect being
investigated: factors genetic, molecular immunological nature are
prominent. genetic factors attention given role red blood
cell (rbc) membrane complement regulatory proteins polymorphisms these
components seem associated resistance severe malaria; genetic
ligands like duffy group blood antigen, necessary erythrocytic invasion, 
and human protein cd36, major receptor p. falciparum-infected rbc's, are
also scrutiny: attention focused also plasmodium erythrocyte-binding 
antigens, bind rbc surface components. genome-wide linkage and
association studies carried too, order identify genes
associated malaria resistance. minor role attributed to
intravascular sickling, phagocytosis haemolysis, specific molecular
mechanisms object intensive research: among decisive role is
played biochemical sequence, involving activation haeme oxygenase
(hmo-1), whose effect appears mediated carbon monoxide (co). central role in
protection malaria also played immunological factors, may
stimulate antibody production plasmodium antigens early years life; 
the role agents like pathogenic cd8 t-cells suggested the
effects molecular actions immunity mechanism presently
investigated. thus appears protection malaria explained by
interaction different factors: elucidation mechanisms may prove
valuable prevention treatment strategy disease still
affects large parts world.
