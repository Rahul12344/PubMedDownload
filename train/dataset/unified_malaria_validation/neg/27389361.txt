understanding population genetics genes shape resistance to
antimalarial drugs help devising novel control strategies. high spread
of resistant strains malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum pose a
greater challenge control programs across world. specific 
mutations p. falciparum chloroquine resistant transporter gene "pfcrt"
have associated resistance chloroquine, also to
amodiaquine, one artemisinin partners used cameroon treatment
of uncomplicated malaria. present data genetic variation single
nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) level pfcrt gene five distinct
geographical settings southern-cameroon (the malaria endemic part),
i.e. ebolowa, yaounde, bertoua, douala kye-ossi (a city bordering cameroon
and two others african countries). two novel mutations, hitherto unreported (in
cameroon) found pfcrt gene variable genetic diversity was
observed across populations. high linkage disequilibrium found between
few snps including one novel mutations suggesting synergistic work for
conferring/maintaining higher level resistance. inference of
evolutionary pattern gene cameroon based genetic diversity data
depicts signature darwinian positive natural selection loci.
observation novel mutations might traduce new variants chloroquine/or
amodiaquine resistance (proposal awaiting experimental verification) and
signal positive selection result drug pressure exerted misuse
of chloroquine (though officially banned country) and/or amodiaquine.
our findings thus, provide baseline understanding evolution malaria
drug resistant gene cameroon suggest successful establishment of
chloroquine-resistant strains requires urgent attention malaria
control program cameroon.
