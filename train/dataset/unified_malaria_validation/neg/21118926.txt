the 200-kd merozoite surface protein plasmodium vivax (pvmsp-1) one 
leading vaccine candidates p. vivax malaria. however, gene encoding
pvmsp-1 (pvmsp1) highly polymorphic major obstacle effective
vaccine development. understand polymorphism pvmsp1, obtained 30
full-length pvmsp1 sequences southeastern turkey. comparative analysis of
sequences turkey areas showed substantially limited polymorphism. 
substitutions found 280 162 amino acid sites samples other
regions turkey, respectively. eight substitutions unique to
turkey. one them, d/e position 1706 c-terminal 19-kd region, 
k/e change 1709 polymorphism previously known. limited diversity 
was also observed microsatellites. data suggest recent population bottleneck
in turkey may obscured signature balancing selection the
c-terminal 42-kd region, otherwise detectable areas.
