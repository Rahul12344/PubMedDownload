today quest new lead molecules supply development pipeline 
driving course drug discovery, endophytic fungi outstanding
biosynthetic potential seem highly promising avenues natural product
scientists. however, challenges production inadequate quantities
of compounds, attenuation loss ability endophytes produce the
compound interest grown culture inability fungal endophytes
to express full biosynthetic potential laboratory conditions been
the major constraints. led application small chemical
elicitors induce epigenetic changes fungi activate silent gene
clusters optimizing amount metabolites interest inducing the
synthesis hitherto undescribed compounds. respect small molecular
weight compounds known function inhibitors histone deacetylase
(hdac), dna methyltransferase (dnmt) proteasome proven efficacy in
enhancing inducing production specialized metabolites fungi.
moreover, organic solvents, metals plants extracts also acknowledged 
their ability cause shifts fungal metabolism. highlight successful
studies past two decades reporting ability structurally diverse
small molecular weight compounds elicit production previously
undescribed metabolites endophytic fungi grown culture. mini review 
argues favor chemical elicitation effective strategy optimize 
production fungal metabolites invigorate pipeline drug discovery
with new chemical entities.
