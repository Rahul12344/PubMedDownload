plasmodium vivax causative infectious agent 80-300 million annual cases
of malaria. many aspects parasite's biology remain unknown. further
elucidate interaction p. vivax saimiri boliviensis host, we
obtained detailed proteomes infected red blood cells, representing the
trophozoite-enriched stage development. data two three biological
replicate proteomes, emphasized here, analyzed using five search engines,
which enhanced identifications resulted comprehensive p. vivax
proteomes date, 1375 p. vivax 3209 s. boliviensis identified
proteins. ribosome subunit proteins noted p. vivax s.
boliviensis, consistent p. vivax's known reticulocyte host-cell specificity.
a majority host pathogen proteins identified belong specific
functional categories, several parasite gene families, 33% p.
vivax proteins reported function. hemoglobin significantly oxidized
in proteomes, additional protein oxidation nitration detected in
one two proteomes. detailed analyses post-translational
modifications presented. proteins identified significantly expand
the known p. vivax proteome complexity available host protein
functionality underlying host-parasite interactive biology, reveal
unsuspected oxidative modifications may impact protein function.biological
significance: plasmodium vivax malaria serious neglected disease, causing an
estimated 80 300 million cases annually 95 countries. infection result 
in significant morbidity possible death. p. vivax, unlike much
better-studied plasmodium falciparum species, cannot grown long-term
culture, dormant form liver called hypnozoite stage, a
reticulocyte host-cell preference blood, creates caveolae vesicle
complexes surface infected reticulocyte membranes. studies of
stage-specific p. vivax expressed proteomes limited scope and
focused mainly pathogen proteins, thus limiting understanding biology
of pathogen host interactions. three p. vivax proteomes are
reported biological replicates based purified trophozoite-infected
reticulocytes different saimiri boliviensis infections (the main non-human
primate experimental model p. vivax biology pathogenesis). in-depth
analysis two proteomes using 2d lc/ms/ms multiple search engines
identified 1375 pathogen proteins 3209 host proteins. numerous functional
categories host pathogen proteins identified, including several 
known p. vivax protein family members (e.g., phist, etramp vir), 33% of
protein identifications classified hypothetical. ribosome subunit
proteins noted p. vivax s. boliviensis, consistent this
parasite species' known reticulocyte host-cell specificity. two biological
replicates analyzed post-translational modifications, hemoglobin was
extensively oxidized, various proteins also oxidized nitrated
in one two replicates. cause protein modification remains to
be determined could include oxidized heme oxygen radicals released from
the infected red blood cell's parasite-induced acidic digestive vacuoles. 
case, data suggests presence distinct infection-specific conditions
whereby pathogen host infected red blood cell proteins may be
subject significant oxidative stress.
