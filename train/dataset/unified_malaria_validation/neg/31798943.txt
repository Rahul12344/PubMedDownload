all organisms encounter pathogens, birds especially susceptible to
infection malaria parasites haemosporidians. important to
understand immune genes, primarily innate immune genes first
line host defense, evolved across birds, highly diverse group of
tetrapods. here, find innate immune genes highly conserved across the
avian tree life although show evidence positive or
diversifying selection within specific lineages clades, number sites is
often proportionally low broader context putative constraint. rather, 
the evidence shows much higher level negative purifying selection in
these innate immune genes - rather adaptive immune genes - is
consistent birds' long coevolutionary history pathogens need to
maintain rapid response infection. explored avian responses to
haemosporidians comparing differential gene expression wild birds (1)
uninfected haemosporidians, (2) infected plasmodium, (3) infected
with haemoproteus (parahaemoproteus). found patterns significant
differential expression genes unique infection genus a
few shared "treatment" groups, none overlapped genes
included phylogenetic study.
