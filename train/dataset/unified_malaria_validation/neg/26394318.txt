malaria remains important public health issue world. among 5
plasmodium species invasive humans, plasmodium knowlesi identified
most recently. sometimes difficult differentiate species p.
malariae use microscopic examination. however, p. knowlesi infection 
may associated rapidly increasing parasitaemia severe clinical course
with risk death. samples polish travellers returning areas where
simian malaria endemic examined use polymerase chain reaction
(pcr). small subunit ribosomal rna (ssu rrna) genes subjected to
analysis using nested pcr reaction. positive results p. knowlesi were
obtained. due morphological similarities p. malariae, potentially severe
clinical course infection p. knowlesi endemic regions common
tourist destination, diagnostic clinical vigilance necessary, including
molecular methods use precise parasite identification.
