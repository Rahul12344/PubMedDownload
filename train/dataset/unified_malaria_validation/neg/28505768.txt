complex systems often characterized distinct types interactions between
the entities. described multilayer network each
layer represents one type interaction. layers may interdependent in
complicated ways, revealing different kinds structure network. 
work present generative model, efficient expectation-maximization
algorithm, allows us perform inference tasks community detection
and link prediction setting. model assumes overlapping communities
that common layers, allowing communities affect
each layer different way, including arbitrary mixtures assortative,
disassortative, directed structure. also gives us mathematically
principled way define interdependence layers, measuring how
much information one layer helps us predict links another layer. in
particular, allows us bundle layers together compress redundant
information identify small groups layers suffice predict the
remaining layers accurately. illustrate findings analyzing synthetic 
data two real multilayer networks, one representing social support
relationships among villagers south india representing shared
