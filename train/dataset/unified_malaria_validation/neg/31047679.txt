a variety good manufacturing practice (gmp) compliant processes been
reported production non-replicating adenovirus vectors, important
challenges remain. clinical development adenovirus vectors uses
simian adenoviruses rare human serotypes, whereas reported manufacturing
processes mainly use serotypes adhu5 questionable relevance 
for clinical vaccine development. many clinically relevant vaccine transgenes
interfere adenovirus replication, whereas reported process development 
uses selected antigens even model transgenes fluorescent proteins
which cause little interference. processes typically developed a
single adenovirus serotype - transgene combination, requiring extensive further
optimization new vaccine. need rapid production platforms
for small gmp batches non-replicating adenovirus vectors early-phase
vaccine trials, particularly preparation response emerging pathogen
outbreaks. platforms must robust variation transgene, and
ideally also capable producing adenoviruses one serotype. is
also highly desirable processes readily implemented new
facilities using commercially available single-use materials, avoiding need
for development bespoke tools cleaning validation, be
readily scalable later-stage studies. report development 
a process, using single-use stirred-tank bioreactors, transgene-repressing
hek293 cell - promoter combination, fully single-use filtration ion
exchange components. demonstrate applicability process candidate
vaccines rabies, malaria rift valley fever, based different
adenovirus serotype. compare performance range commercially available 
ion exchange media, including believe first published use 
novel media adenovirus purification (natriflo® hd-q, merck). demonstrate
the need minimal process individualization vaccine, the
product fulfils regulatory quality expectations. cell-specific yields 
upper end previously reported literature, volumetric yields
are range 1 × 1013 - 5 × 1013 purified virus particles per litre of
