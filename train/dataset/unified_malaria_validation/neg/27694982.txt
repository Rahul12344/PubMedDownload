drug resistance emerged one greatest challenges facing malaria
control. recent emergence resistance artemisinin (art) partner 
drugs art-based combination therapies (act) threatening efficacy of
this front-line regimen treating plasmodium falciparum parasites. thus, an
understanding molecular mechanisms underlie resistance art and
the partner drugs become high priority resistance containment and
malaria management. using genome-wide association studies, investigated the
associations genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms vitro
sensitivities 10 commonly used antimalarial drugs 94 p. falciparum isolates
from china-myanmar border area, region longest history art
usage. identified several loci associated various drugs, including 
containing pfcrt pfdhfr. particular interest locus chromosome 10
containing autophagy-related protein 18 (atg18) associated decreased
sensitivities dihydroartemisinin, artemether piperaquine - an act partner 
drug area. atg18 phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate binding protein
essential autophagy recently identified potential art target.
further investigations atg18 genes chromosome 10 locus may
provide important lead connection art resistance autophagy.
