background: studies non-model species important understanding the
molecular processes underpinning phenotypic variation natural ecological
conditions. common buzzard (buteo buteo; aves: accipitriformes) a
widespread common eurasian raptor three distinct plumage morphs that
differ several fitness-related traits, including parasite infestation. to
provide genomic resource plumage polymorphic birds general search
for candidate genes relating fitness, generated transcriptome a
single dead buzzard specimen plus easily accessible, minimally invasive samples
from live chicks.
results: de novo assembled near-complete buzzard transcriptome, but
also obtained significant fraction transcriptome malaria-like
parasite, leucocytozoon buteonis. identifying melanogenesis-related
transcripts differentially expressed light ventral dark dorsal
feathers, also expressed regions body, also
identified suite candidate genes could associated fitness
differences among morphs. include several immune-related genes,
providing plausible link melanisation parasite load. qpcr analysis 
of subset genes revealed significant differences ventral and
dorsal feathers additional effect morph.
conclusion: new resource provides preliminary insights genes could
be involved fitness differences buzzard colour morphs, 
facilitate future studies raptors malaria-like parasites.
