background: deoxyhypusine synthase (dhs) catalyzes first step hypusine
biosynthesis eukaryotic initiation factor 5a (eif-5a) plasmodium
falciparum. target evaluation parasitic dhs recently performed with
cni-1493, novel selective pro-inflammatory cytokine inhibitor used clinical 
phase ii treatment crohn's disease. cni-1493 prevented infected mice
from experimental cerebral malaria decreasing levels hypusinated eif-5a
and serum tnf, implicating link cytokine signaling hypusine
pathway.therefore addressed question whether either dhs eif-5a
is required outcome severe malaria. first set experiments we
performed vitro knockdown plasmodial eif-5a dhs proteins rna 
interference (rnai) 293 cells. secondly, transfection sirna constructs
into murine plasmodium schizonts performed which, turn, used for
infection.
results: 293 cells treated plasmodial dhs- eif-5a specific sirnas or
control sirnas analyzed rt-pcr determine endogenous dhs -and eif-5a
mrna levels. expressed dhs-shrna eif-5a-shrna clearly downregulated the
corresponding transcript cells. interestingly, mice infected with
transgenic schizonts expressing either eif-5a dhs shrna showed elevated
parasitemia within first two days post infection decreased
intermittently. results obtained without drug selection. blood
samples, taken infected mice day 5 post infection with
either expressed eif-5a-shrna dhs-shrna analyzed rt-pcr and
western blot techniques, demonstrating absence either hypusinated form
of eif-5a dhs.
conclusions: infection nmri mice schizonts lethal p. berghei
anka wildtype strain transgenic plasmodial eif-5a-specific shrna or
dhs-specific shrna resulted low parasitemia 2-9 days post infection before
animals succumbed hyperparasitemia similar infections related 
non-lethal phenotype p. berghei strain nk65. rt-pcr western blot experiments 
performed blood transfected erythrocytic stages showed both
genes important proliferation parasite. moreover, these
experiments clearly demonstrate hypusine pathway plasmodium linked
to human inos induction.
