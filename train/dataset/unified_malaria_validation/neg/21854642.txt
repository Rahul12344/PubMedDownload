background: investigation anti-malarial molecular markers coupled
with therapeutic efficacy test chloroquine (cq) falciparum malaria
in area unstable malaria lahj governorate, yemen. study aimed at
assessment therapeutic response cq elucidation baseline information 
on molecular markers plasmodium falciparum resistance cq and
sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (sp).
methods: 2002 2003 field test conducted according the
standard protocol evaluate therapeutic efficacy cq 124 patients 
with falciparum malaria endemic area lahj governorate yemen. blood
samples collected study analysed p. falciparum chloroquine
resistance transporter gene (pfcrt)-76 polymorphisms, mutation pfcrt-s163r and
the antifolate resistance-associated mutations dihydrofolate reductase
(dhfr)-c59r dihydropteroate synthase (dhps)-k540e. direct dna sequencing of
the pfcrt gene three representative field samples carried dna 
amplification 13 exons pfcrt gene.
results: treatment failure detected 61% 122 cases completed
the 14-day follow-up. prevalence mutant pfcrt t76 98% 112 amplified
pre-treatment samples. presence pfcrt t76 poorly predictive vivo
cq resistance (ppv = 61.8%, 95% ci = 52.7-70.9). prevalence dhfr arg-59
mutation 99 amplified samples 5%, dhps glu-540 detected 
in 119 amplified samples. sequencing pfcrt gene confirmed yemeni 
cq resistant p. falciparum carry old world (asian african) cq resistant
haplotype cvietsesi positions 72,73,74,75,76,220,271, 326 371.
conclusion: first study report baseline information the
characteristics implications anti-malarial drug resistance markers in
yemen. also first report haplotype associated cqr p.
falciparum parasites yemen. mutant pfcrtt76 highly prevalent 
poor predictor treatment failure study population. prevalence of
mutation dhfrarg59 suggestive emerging resistance sp, currently
a component recommended combination treatment falciparum malaria in
yemen. studies markers recommended surveillance of
resistance study area.
