pathogen control programs provide valuable, rarely exploited, opportunity
to directly examine relationship population decline population
genetics. investigated impact ~12-fold decline transmission on
the population genetics plasmodium falciparum infections (n = 1731) sampled
from four clinics thai-burma border 10 years genotyped using 96
genome-wide snps. striking associated genetic change reduction 
the frequency infections containing multiple parasite genotypes 63% in
2001 14% 2010 (p = 3 × 10(-15)). two measures clonal composition 
populations (genotypic richness β-parameter pareto distribution)
declined time people infected parasites identical
multilocus genotypes, consistent increased selfing reduction the
rate multilocus genotypes broken apart recombination. we
predicted reduction transmission, multiple clone carriage and
outbreeding would mirrored increased influence genetic drift.
however, geographical differentiation expected heterozygosity remained stable
across sampling period. furthermore, n(e) estimates derived allele
frequencies fluctuation years remained high (582 ∞) showed no
downward trend. results demonstrate genetic data compliment
epidemiological assessments infectious disease control programs. temporal 
changes single declining population parallel seen comparisons of
parasite genetics regions differing endemicity, strongly supporting the
notion reduced opportunity outbreeding key driver these
patterns.
