control biological populations ongoing challenge many fields,
including agriculture, biodiversity, ecological preservation, pest control, and
the spread disease. cases, insects harbor human pathogens
(e.g., malaria), elimination reduction small number species would have
a dramatic impact across globe. given recent discovery development of
the crispr-cas9 gene editing technology, unique arrangement system, a
nuclease-based "gene drive," allows super-mendelian spread forced
propagation genetic element population. recent studies have
demonstrated ability gene drive rapidly spread within nearly
eliminate insect populations laboratory setting. still
ongoing technical challenges design optimal gene drive used in
wild populations, still serious ecological ethical concerns
surrounding nature powerful biological agent. here, use budding
yeast safe fully contained model system explore mechanisms might
allow programmed regulation gene drive activity. describe four
conserved features crispr-based drives demonstrate ability each
drive component-cas9 protein level, sgrna identity, cas9 nucleocytoplasmic
shuttling, novel cas9-cas9 tandem fusions-to modulate drive activity within a
population.
