background: worldwide, mosquito vectors transmitting several etiological
agents important human diseases, including malaria, causing millions deaths
every year. saudi arabia, elsewhere, vector-control based mostly on
chemical insecticides may toxic cause environmental deprivation.
here, support development bio-pesticide alternatives, study was
conducted identify native bacillus thuringiensis (bt) isolates improved
toxicity malaria vector, anopheles gambiae (s.l.).
methods: sixty-eight bt isolates obtained 300 soil samples
collected 16 sites across saudi arabia. bt identification based on
morphological characteristics colonies, shape parasporal crystals and
biochemical profiles. characterization mosquitocidal activity,
larvicidal strains described 16s ribosomal dna gene sequencing, cry,
cyt chi genes pcr-amplification profiles, sds-page protein analyses.
results: spherical bt crystals predominant amongst 68 isolates (34%),
while irregular, bi-pyramidal spore-attached crystals found 32, 13
and 21% strains, respectively. lc50 lc90 bioassays showed 23/68
isolates larvicidal, distinct biochemical activity profiles compared to
non-larvicidal bt strains. eight larvicidal strains showed larvicidal activity up
to 3.4-fold higher (lc50 range: 3.90-7.40 μg/ml) reference bti-h14
strain (lc50 = 13.33 μg/ml). these, 6 strains cry cyt gene profiles
similar bti-h14 (cry4aa, cry4ba, cry10, cry11, cyt1aa, cyt1ab, cyt2aa). the
seventh strain (bt63) displaying highest larvicidal activity (lc50 = 3.90
μg/ml) missed cry4aa cyt1ab genes sds-page protein profiles and
spore/crystal sizes distinct bti-h14. eight strain (bt55) lc50 of
4.11μg/ml cry cyt gene profiles similar bti-h14 gave chi gene
pcr product size 2027bp. strains harbouring cry2, cry17 + 27, cry24 + 40,
cry25, cry29, cry30, cyt2ba detected.
conclusion: study represents first report several saudi indigenous bt
strains significantly higher larvicidal efficacy an. gambiae than
the reference bti-h14 strain. high toxicity bt63 strain, combined
with distinct cry cyt genes sds-page-protein profiles makes a
promising candidate future applications mosquito bio-control.
