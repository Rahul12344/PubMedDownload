world health organization reports half population developing
countries risk malaria infection. artemisinin, potent
anti-malaria drug, sesquiterpene endoperoxide extracted plant
artemisia annua. due scalability economics issues, plant extraction or
chemical synthesis could provide sustainable route large-scale
manufacturing artemisinin. price artemisinin fluctuating 
200$/kg 1100$/kg, due geopolitical climate factors. microbial
fermentation considered promising method stabilize artemisinin
supply chain. yarrowia lipolytica, oleaginous yeast proven capacity to
produce large quantity lipids oleochemicals. report, lipogenic
acetyl-coa pathways endogenous mevalonate pathway y. lipolytica were
harnessed amorphadiene production. gene overexpression indicate hmg-coa 
and acetyl-coa supply two limiting bottlenecks amorphadiene production.
we identified optimal hmg-coa reductase determined optimal gene 
copy number precursor pathways. amorphadiene production improved
further either inhibiting fatty acids synthase activating fatty acid
degradation pathway. co-expression mevalonate kinase (encoded erg12), 
a push-and-pull strategy enabled engineered strain produce 171.5 ​mg/l 
amorphadiene shake flasks. results demonstrate balancing carbon
flux manipulation precursor competing pathways key factors improve 
amorphadiene biosynthesis oleaginous yeast; y. lipolytica promising
microbial host expand nature's biosynthetic capacity, allowing us quickly
access antimalarial drug precursors.
