background: malaria continues devastating disease. elucidation of
factors inducing asexual growth versus arrest plasmodium falciparum can
provide information development parasite, may help the
search novel malaria medication. based information genome-wide
transcriptome profiling different developmental stages p. falciparum, we
investigated critical importance copper homeostasis developmental
succession p. falciparum regard three aspects copper function.
these were:1) inhibition copper-binding proteins, 2) copper-ion chelation, and
3) down-regulated expression genes encoding copper-binding proteins associated
with specific growth-promoting factor.
results: inhibition copper-binding proteins tetrathiomolybdate (ttm)
caused cessation growth parasite. ttm arrested parasite
irreversibly trophozoite schizont stage progression. target
molecules ttm may present p. falciparum. involvement copper ions
in developmental arrest also investigated copper-ion chelating methods,
which indicated critical function reduced copper ions (cu1+) parasite
during early developmental stage. copper ions, parasite but
also host cells, targets chelators. chelation cu1+caused
blockage trophozoite progression ring stage. profound growth arrest
was detected parasites cultured chemically defined medium containing
hexadecanoic acid alone growth-promoting factor. developmental arrest
was associated down-regulated expression genes encoding copper-binding
proteins. cis-9-octadecenoic acid completely prevented down-regulation of
gene expression developmental arrest observed use of
hexadecanoic acid.
conclusions: critical importance copper homeostasis early developmental
stages p. falciparum confirmed. perturbation copper homeostasis induced
profound early developmental arrest p. falciparum. findings should
help elucidate mechanisms behind development p. falciparum, may
be applied development effective antimalarial strategies.
