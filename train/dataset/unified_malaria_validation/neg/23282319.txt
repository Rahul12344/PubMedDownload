background: malaria causes one million deaths annually, posing enormous
health economic burden endemic regions. completion genome
sequencing causative agents, group parasites genus plasmodium,
revealed potential drug vaccine candidates. however, genomics-driven target
discovery significantly hampered limited knowledge the
cellular networks associated parasite development pathogenesis. 
paper, propose approach based aligning neighborhood ppi subnetworks
across species identify network components malaria parasite p.
falciparum.
results: instead relying sequence similarities detect functional
orthologs, approach measures conservation neighborhood
subnetworks protein-protein interaction (ppi) networks two species, p.
falciparum e. coli. 1,082 p. falciparum proteins predicted functional
orthologs known transcriptional regulators e. coli network, including
general transcriptional regulators, parasite-specific transcriptional regulators 
in apiap2 protein family, potential regulatory proteins. are
implicated variety cellular processes involving chromatin remodeling,
genome integrity, secretion, invasion, protein processing, metabolism.
conclusions: proof-of-concept study, demonstrate subnetwork
alignment approach reveal previously uncharacterized members the
subnetworks, opens new opportunities identify potential therapeutic
targets provide new insights parasite biology, pathogenesis and
virulence. approach extended systems, especially 
poor genome annotation paucity knowledge cellular networks.
