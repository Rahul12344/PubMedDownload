due excellent safety profile poly (d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (plga)
particles human, biodegradability, many studies focused 
application plga particles controlled-release vaccine delivery system.
antigenic proteins/peptides encapsulated adsorbed surface
of plga particles. gradual release loaded antigens plga particles 
necessary induction efficient immunity. various factors influence 
protein release rates plga particles, defined intrinsic
features polymer, particle characteristics well protein and
environmental related factors. use plga particles encapsulating antigens
of different diseases hepatitis b, tuberculosis, chlamydia, malaria,
leishmania, toxoplasma allergy antigens described herein. the
co-delivery antigens immunostimulants (is) plga particles prevent
the systemic adverse effects immunopotentiators activate dendritic
cells (dcs) natural killer (nks) cells, consequently enhancing the
therapeutic efficacy antigen-loaded plga particles. review co-delivery
of different tlr ligands antigens various models, highlighting the
specific strengths weaknesses system. strategies enhance the
immunotherapeutic effect dc-based vaccine using plga particles designed
to target dcs functionalized plga particle encapsulating sirnas suppressive
gene, disease specific antigens. finally, specific examples cellular
targeting decorating surface plga particles target orally
administrated vaccine m-cells highlighted.
