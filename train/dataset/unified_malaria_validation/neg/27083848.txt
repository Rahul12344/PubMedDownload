small molecular weight bacillus lipases industrially attractive of
its alkaline optimum ph, broad substrate specificity production high yield
by overexpression escherichia coli bacillus subtilis. major
limitation mesophilic nature constantly targeted laboratory
evolution studies. herein metagenomically isolated bacillus lipj randomly
evolved error prone pcr library variants screened enhanced
thermostability. point mutant gln121arg extensively characterized it
showed dramatic shift temp. opt 50°c compared 37°c parent enzyme.
thermostability studies 45°c 50°c determined six fold increase half
life point variant gln121arg compared lipj. circular dichroism (cd) and
tryptophan fluorescence study established enhanced thermostability gln121arg. 
specific activity point variant gln121arg comparable wild type with
increased substrate affinity (km reduced). reduced kcat variant gln121arg
infer kinetic catalytic efficiency mutant compromised. structural
implications homolog modelling predicted gln121 placed within longest
loop structure surface. localization loop due additional polar
interactions arg121 protein core defines molecular basis enhanced
thermostability random point variant gln121arg.
