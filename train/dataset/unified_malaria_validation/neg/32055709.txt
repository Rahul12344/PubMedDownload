the var gene family human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum encode
proteins crucial determinants pathogenesis immune evasion
and highly polymorphic. assembled nearly complete var gene
repertoires 2398 field isolates analysed normalised set 714 from
across 12 countries. therefore represents first large scale attempt to
catalogue worldwide distribution var gene sequences confirm extreme
polymorphism gene family also demonstrate unexpected level of
sequence sharing within continents. show likely 
due remnants selective sweeps well worrying degree of
recent gene flow across continents implications spread drug
resistance. also address evolution var repertoire respect to
the ancestral genes within laverania show diversity generated by
recombination concentrated number hotspots. analysis the
subdomain structure indicates existing definitions may need be
revised analysis data, understand way which
the family evolved diversity continuously generated.
finally, demonstrate genes distributed across genome,
sequence sharing genotypes acts useful population genetic marker.
