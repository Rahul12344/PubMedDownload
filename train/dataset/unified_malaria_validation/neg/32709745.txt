infection malaria parasites triggers dynamic immune responses leading to
diverse symptoms pathologies; however, molecular mechanisms responsible
for reactions largely unknown. performed trans-species expression
quantitative trait locus analysis identify large number host genes that
respond malaria parasite infections. functionally characterize one 
the host genes called receptor transporter protein 4 (rtp4) responses to
malaria parasite virus infections. rtp4 induced type ifn (ifn-i) 
binds tank-binding kinase (tbk1) complex negatively regulates
tbk1 signaling interfering expression phosphorylation tbk1
and ifn regulatory factor 3. rtp4 -/- mice generated infected with
malaria parasite plasmodiun berghei anka. significantly higher levels ifn-i
response microglia, lower parasitemia, fewer neurologic symptoms, better
survival rates observed rtp4 -/- wild-type mice. similarly, rtp4 
deficiency significantly reduced west nile virus titers brain, 
the heart spleen, infected mice, suggesting specific role rtp4
in brain infection pathology. study reveals functions rtp4 ifn-i
response potential target therapy diseases neuropathology.
