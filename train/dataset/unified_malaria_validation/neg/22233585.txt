traditionally, infection plasmodium vivax thought benign and
self-limiting, however, recent evidence demonstrated infection p.
vivax also result severe illness death. research p. vivax has
been relatively neglected much remains unknown regarding biology,
pathogenesis epidemiology parasite. one fundamental factors
governing transmission immunity parasite diversity. understanding of
parasite population genetic structure necessary understand the
epidemiology, diversity, distribution dynamics natural p. vivax
populations. addition, studying population structure genes immune
selection also enables investigation dynamic interplay between
transmission immunity, crucial vaccine development. lack of
knowledge regarding transmission spread p. vivax particularly
highlighted areas malaria control elimination programmes made
progress reducing burden plasmodium falciparum, yet p. vivax remains as
a substantial obstacle. malaria elimination back global agenda,
mapping global local p. vivax population structure essential prior to
establishing goals elimination roll-out interventions. detailed 
knowledge spatial distribution, transmission clinical burden p.
vivax required act benchmark control targets set 
and measured. paper presents overview known yet to
be fully understood regarding p. vivax population genetics, well the
importance application p. vivax population genetics studies.
