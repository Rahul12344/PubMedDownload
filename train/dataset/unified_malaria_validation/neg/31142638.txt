plasmodium sporozoites invade hepatocytes initiate infection mammalian 
host. infected hepatocytes, sporozoites undergo rapid expansion and
differentiation, resulting formation release thousands invasive 
merozoites bloodstream. sporozoites merozoites invade their
host cells activation signaling cascade followed discharge of
micronemal content. camp-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit
(pkac)-mediated signaling plays important role merozoite invasion of
erythrocytes, role stages parasite remains unknown.
becaused essentiality pkac blood stages, generated conditional
mutants pkac disrupting gene plasmodium berghei sporozoites. the
mutant salivary gland sporozoites able glide, invaded hepatocytes, and
matured hepatic merozoites released successfully merosome,
however failed initiate blood stage infection inoculated mice. our
results demonstrate malaria parasite complete preerythrocytic stages
development without pkac, raising possibility pkac independent
signaling operates preerythrocytic stages p. berghei.
