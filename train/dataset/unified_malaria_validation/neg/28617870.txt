the combination drug resistance, lack effective vaccine, ongoing
conflict poverty means malaria remains major global health crisis.
understanding metabolic pathways parasite life stages important in
prioritising targeting novel anti-parasitic compounds. unusual heme
synthesis pathway rodent malaria parasite, plasmodium berghei, requires
eight enzymes distributed across mitochondrion, apicoplast cytoplasm.
deletion ferrochelatase (fc) gene, final enzyme pathway,
confirms heme synthesis essential red blood cell stages the
life cycle required complete oocyst development mosquitoes. the
lethality fc deletions mosquito stage makes difficult study the
impact mutations subsequent liver stage. overcome this, we
combined locus-specific fluorophore expression genetic complementation
approach generate viable, heterozygous oocysts able produce mix fc
expressing fc deficient sporozoites. sporozoites show normal motility
and invade liver cells, fc deficient parasites distinguished 
fluorescence phenotyped. parasites lacking fc exhibit severe growth defect 
within liver cells, development failure detectable early mid
stages liver development vitro. fc deficient parasites could complete
liver stage development vitro infect na√Øve mice, confirming liver stage
arrest. results validate heme pathway potential target for
prophylactic drugs targeting liver stage parasites. addition, demonstrate
that simple genetic approach extend phenotyping window beyond the
insect stages, opening considerable scope straightforward reverse genetic
analysis genes dispensable blood stages essential for
completing mosquito development.
