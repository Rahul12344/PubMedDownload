the coevolutionary relationships avian malaria parasites hosts 
influence host specificity, geographical distribution pathogenicity of
these parasites. however, understand fine scale coevolutionary host-parasite
relationships, robust widespread sampling closely related hosts is
needed. thus sought explore coevolutionary history avian plasmodium 
and widespread african sunbirds, family nectariniidae. birds are
distributed throughout africa occupy variety habitats. considering the
role habitat plays influencing host-specificity role that
host-specificity plays coevolutionary relationships, african sunbirds provide 
an exceptional model system study processes govern distribution
and diversity avian malaria. evaluated coevolutionary histories
using multi-gene phylogeny nectariniidae avian plasmodium found in
nectariniidae. assessed host-parasite biogeography the
structuring parasite assemblages. recovered plasmodium lineages
concurrently east, west, south island regions africa. however, several 
plasmodium lineages recovered exclusively within one respective region,
despite found widely distributed hosts. addition, inferred the
biogeographic history parasites provide evidence supporting model 
of biotic diversification avian plasmodium african sunbirds.
