speciation process remains central focus evolutionary biology, 
understanding genomic architecture prevalence speciation the
face gene flow remains incomplete. anopheles gambiae species complex of
malaria mosquitoes radiation ecologically diverse taxa. complex is
well-suited testing evidence speciation continuum genomic
barriers introgression members exhibit partially overlapping
geographic distributions well varying levels divergence reproductive
isolation. sequenced 20 genomes wild a. gambiae s.s., anopheles coluzzii,
anopheles arabiensis, compared 12 genomes "goundry"
subgroup a. gambiae s.l. amidst backdrop strong reproductive isolation,
we find strong evidence speciation continuum introgression of
autosomal chromosomal regions among species subgroups. x chromosome,
however, strongly differentiated among taxa, pointing a
disproportionately large effect x chromosome genes driving speciation among
anophelines. strikingly, find autosomal introgression occurred from
contemporary hybridization a. gambiae a. arabiensis despite strong
divergence (∼5× higher autosomal divergence) isolation x
chromosome. addition x, find strong evidence lowly recombining 
autosomal regions, especially pericentromeric regions, serve barriers to
introgression secondarily x. show speciation gene flow
