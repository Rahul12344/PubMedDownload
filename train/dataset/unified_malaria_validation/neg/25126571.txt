salivary gland proteins anopheles mosquitoes offer attractive targets to
understand interactions sporozoites, blood feeding behavior, homeostasis,
and immunological evaluation malaria vectors parasite interactions. to
date limited studies carried elucidate salivary proteins an. 
stephensi salivary glands. aim present study provide detailed
analytical attributives functional salivary gland proteins urban malaria
vector an. stephensi. proteomic approach combining one-dimensional
electrophoresis (1de), ion trap liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
(lc/ms/ms), computational bioinformatic analysis adopted provide the
first direct insight identification functional characterization known
salivary proteins novel salivary proteins an. stephensi. computational
studies online servers, namely, mascot omssa algorithms, identified a
total 36 known salivary proteins 123 novel proteins analysed lc/ms/ms. 
this first report describes baseline proteomic catalogue 159 salivary
proteins belonging various categories signal transduction, regulation of
blood coagulation cascade, various immune energy pathways an.
stephensi sialotranscriptome mass spectrometry. results may serve basis
to provide putative functional role proteins concept blood feeding,
biting behavior, aspects vector-parasite host interactions for
parasite development anopheline mosquitoes.
