background: malaria endemic countries shift control elimination, the
proportion low density plasmodium falciparum infections increases. current
field diagnostic tools, microscopy rapid diagnostic tests (rdt), with
detection limits approximately 100-200 parasites/µl (p/µl) 800-1000 pg/ml 
histidine-rich protein 2 (hrp2), respectively, unable detect these
infections. novel ultra-sensitive hrp2-based alere™ malaria ag p.f rdt (urdt)
was evaluated laboratory conditions define test's performance against
recombinant hrp2 native cultured parasites.
results: urdt detected dilutions p. falciparum recombinant gst-w2 and
flis-w2, well cultured w2 itg, diluted whole blood to
10-40 pg/ml hrp2, depending protein tested. urdt specificity 100%
against 123 archived frozen whole blood samples. rapid test cross-reactivity with
hrp3 investigated using pfhrp2 gene deletion strains d10 dd2, pfhrp3 gene
deletion strain hb3, controls pfhrp2 pfhrp3 double deletion strain 3bd5
and pfhrp2 pfhrp3 competent strain itg. commercial standard diagnostics, 
inc. bioline malaria ag p.f rdt (sd-rdt) urdt detected pfhrp2 positive
strains 49 3.13 p/µl, respectively. pfhrp2 deletion strains 
detected 98 p/µl tests.
conclusion: performance urdt variable depending protein,
but overall showed greater 10-fold improvement sd-rdt. urdt
also exhibited excellent specificity showed cross-reactivity with
hrp3 sd-rdt. together, results support urdt sensitive
hrp2 test could potentially effective tool elimination campaigns.
further clinical evaluations purpose merited.
