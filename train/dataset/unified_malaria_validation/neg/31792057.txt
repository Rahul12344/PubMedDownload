the plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (pfcsp) sporozoite
surface protein whose role sporozoite motility cell invasion made it
the leading candidate pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine. however, production
of high yields soluble recombinant pfcsp, including extensive nanp and
nvdp repeats, proven problematic. here, report development and
characterization secreted, soluble, stable full-length pfcsp (containing
4 nvdp 38 nanp repeats) produced lactococcus lactis expression system.
the recombinant full-length pfcsp, denoted pfcsp4/38, produced initially with
a histidine tag purified simple two-step procedure. importantly, the
recombinant pfcsp4/38 retained conformational epitope antibodies as
confirmed vivo vitro characterizations. characterized this
complex protein hplc, light scattering, ms analysis, differential scanning
fluorimetry, cd, sds-page, immunoblotting conformation-dependent and
-independent mabs, confirmed pure soluble. moreover, we
found recombinant protein stable frozen and
elevated-temperature storage conditions. used l. lactis-derived pfcsp4/38
to immunize mice, elicited high levels functional antibodies the
capacity modify sporozoite motility vitro concluded reported
yield, purity, results biophysical analyses, stability pfcsp4/38
warrant consideration using l. lactis system production of
circumsporozoite proteins preclinical clinical applications malaria
