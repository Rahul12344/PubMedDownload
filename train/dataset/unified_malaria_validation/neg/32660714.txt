haptoglobin (hp) belongs family acute-phase plasma proteins and
represents important plasma detoxifier hemoglobin (hb). basic hp 
molecule tetrameric protein built two α/β dimers. hp α/β dimer is
encoded single gene synthesized single polypeptide. following
post-translational protease-dependent cleavage hp polypeptide, α β
chains linked disulfide bridge(s) generate mature hp protein. as
human hp gene characterized two common hp1 hp2 alleles, three major
genotypes result (i.e., hp1-1, hp2-1, hp2-2). hp regulates hb clearance
from circulation macrophage-specific receptor cd163, thus preventing
hb-mediated severe consequences health. indeed, antioxidant hb
binding properties hp well ability stimulate cells the
monocyte/macrophage lineage modulate helper t-cell type 1 type 2
balance significantly associate variety pathogenic disorders (e.g.,
infectious diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer). alternative 
functions variants hp1 hp2 reported, particularly the
susceptibility protection infectious (e.g., pulmonary tuberculosis,
hiv, malaria) non-infectious (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and
obesity) diseases. high low levels hp indicative clinical
conditions: hp plasma levels increase infections, inflammation, and
various malignant diseases, decrease malnutrition, hemolysis, hepatic 
disease, allergic reactions, seizure disorders. note, hp:hb complexes 
display heme-based reactivity; fact, bind several ferrous ferric
ligands, including o2, co, no, display (pseudo-)enzymatic properties
(e.g., peroxynitrite detoxification). here, genetic, biochemical,
biomedical, biotechnological aspects hp reviewed.
