emerging resistance first-line antimalarial combination therapies threatens
malaria treatment global elimination campaign. improved therapeutic
strategies required protect existing drugs enhance treatment efficacy.
we report piperazine-containing compound act-451840 exhibits
single-digit nanomolar inhibition plasmodium falciparum asexual blood
stages transmissible gametocyte forms. genome sequence analyses in
vitro-derived act-451840-resistant parasites revealed single nucleotide
polymorphisms pfmdr1, encodes digestive vacuole membrane-bound
atp-binding cassette transporter known alter p. falciparum susceptibility to
multiple first-line antimalarials. crispr-cas9 based gene editing confirmed 
pfmdr1 point mutations mediated act-451840 resistance. resistant parasites
demonstrated increased susceptibility clinical drugs lumefantrine,
mefloquine, quinine amodiaquine. stage v gametocytes harboring
cas9-introduced pfmdr1 mutations also acquired act-451840 resistance. these
findings reveal pfmdr1 mutations impart resistance compounds active
against asexual blood stages mature gametocytes. exploiting pfmdr1 resistance
mechanisms provides new opportunities developing disease-relieving and
transmission-blocking antimalarials.
