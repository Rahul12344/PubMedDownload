background: well-known antimalarials primaquine may
induce severe hemolytic anemia people g-6-pd deficiency. antimalarial
drug prescriptions must, therefore take account patient's g-6-pd status 
in malaria endemic areas burkina faso, prevalence this
genetic abnormality relatively high. although great clinical heterogeneity 
observed depending molecular nature deficiency residual
enzyme activity red blood cell, poor data prevalence 
of g-6-pd deficiency distribution involved genetic variants burkina
faso. systematic review, present synthesis various studies
carried g-6-pd deficiency burkina faso order determine its
prevalence, probable distribution genetic variants involved their
clinical implications national systematic screening policy among groups
most vulnerable malaria.
methods: systematic review carried analyze available published data 
on prevalence, phenotypes mutations responsible g-6-pd deficiency 
burkina faso. key words used "g-6-pd deficiency burkina faso" or
"d√©ficit en g-6-pd burkina faso" french. identify relevant
articles, two independent reviewers reviewed titles, abstracts full
text selected papers.
results: average prevalence 16.6% (183/1100; ci 95%: 0.145-0.190) 6.5% 
(69/1066; ci 95%: 0.051-0.081) g-6-pd deficiency found respectively men
and women systematic review. although predominance (99.8% g-6-pd
deficient cases) 202a/376g g-6-pd a- variant, santamaria betica selma 
variants identified burkina faso. independently method used, the
enzymatic deficiency significantly higher males (2.5-20.5%) compared to
females (3.3-12.3%).
conclusion: systematic review suggests despite ubiquity the
202a/376g g-6-pd a- variant burkina faso, necessary consider the
santamaria betica selma variants although frequencies remain be
specified. systematic screening g-6-pd deficiency also needed to
prevent occurrence iatrogenic hemolytic accidents.
