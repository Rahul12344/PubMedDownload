background: parasitic infections responsible significant burden of
disease worldwide result international travel immigration. more
accurate diagnostic tools necessary support parasite control and
elimination programmes endemic regions well rapid case detection 
non-endemic areas. digital pcr (dpcr) powerful technology recent
applications parasitology.
aims: review provides first time overview dpcr novel
technology applied detection parasitic infections, highlights 
relevant potential benefits assay.
sources: peer-reviewed literature pertinent review based pubmed,
cochrane embase databases well laboratory experience authors.
content: among 86 studies retrieved, 17 used dpcr applied parasites
belonging protozoa (8), helminths (8) arthropods (1) clinical human
interest. dpcr adopted four studies, respectively, plasmodium and
schistosoma japonicum. dpcr led clear advantages quantitative real-time
pcr p. falciparum spp., s. japonicum showing higher sensitivity;
and cryptosporidium higher stability inhibitors stool. all
parasites, dpcr allows absolute quantitation without need standard
curve. various dpcr platforms used. critical factors need
consideration: dna load, choice platform reaction optimization.
implications: owing sensitivity quantitative characteristics, dpcr 
a potential candidate become appealing new method among molecular
technologies parasite detection quantitative analysis future. in
general, applications genomic dna detection only, as
quantitation mixed infections, gene expression mutation analysis. dpcr
should considered malaria screening diagnosis complement to
routine assays schistosomiasis elimination programmes. standardized
strategies studies needed integration dpcr routine 
clinical laboratory.
