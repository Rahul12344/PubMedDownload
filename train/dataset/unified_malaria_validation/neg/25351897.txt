malaria parasites profound effects human populations millennia,
but terrestrial vertebrates impacted malaria well. entire species
of birds driven extinction, many others threatened by
population declines. recent studies shown host-switching quite
common among malaria parasite lineages, switches often involve a
significant shift environment parasites find themselves,
including nucleated vs non-nucleated red blood cells red vs white blood
cells. therefore, important understand parasites adapt these
different host environments. mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene shows
evidence adaptive molecular evolution among malaria parasite groups,
putatively critical role electron transport chain (etc) 
cellular metabolism. two hypotheses addressed here: (1) mitochondrial
components etc (cyt b cytochrome oxidase 1 [coi]) show evidence
of adaptive evolution (i.e., selection) (2) selection evident in
host switches. overall found signature constraint (e.g., purifying
selection) across four genes included here, also found evidence of
positive selection associated host switches cyt b and, surprisingly, in
(apicoplast) caseinolytic protease c. results suggest evidence of
selection widespread across parasite genomes.
