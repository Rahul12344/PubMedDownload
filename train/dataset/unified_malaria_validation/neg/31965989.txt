malaria deadly, infectious disease caused parasite plasmodium,
leading millions deaths worldwide. plasmodium requires coordinated
pattern sequential gene expression surviving invertebrate and
vertebrate host environments. parasites largely depend host resources, they
also develop efficient mechanisms sense adapt variable nutrient
conditions environment modulate virulence. earlier shown
that pfgcn5, histone acetyltransferase, binds stress-responsive and
virulence-related genes poised state regulates expression under
temperature artemisinin treatment conditions p. falciparum. study,
we show upregulation pfgcn5 upon nutrient stress condition. help of
chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled high-throughput sequencing (chip-seq) and
transcriptomic (rna-sequencing) analyses, show pfgcn5 associated 
the genes important maintenance parasite cellular homeostasis
upon nutrient stress condition. furthermore, identified various metabolic
enzymes interacting partners pfgcn5 immunoprecipitation coupled with
mass spectroscopy, possibly acting sensor nutrient conditions the
environment. also demonstrated pfgcn5 interacts acetylates pfgapdh in
vitro. collectively, data provides important insights transcriptional
deregulation upon nutrient stress condition elucidate role pfgcn5
during nutrient stress condition.
