the reticuloendotheliosis viruses (revs) comprise several closely related
amphotropic retroviruses isolated birds. viruses exhibit several
highly unusual characteristics far adequately explained,
including extremely close relationship mammalian retroviruses, their
presence endogenous sequences within genomes certain large dna viruses.
we present evidence iatrogenic origin revs accounts these
phenomena. firstly, identify endogenous retroviral fossils mammalian
genomes share unique recombinant structure revs-unequivocally
demonstrating revs derive directly mammalian retroviruses. secondly,
through sequencing archived rev isolates, confirm contaminated
plasmodium lophurae stocks source multiple rev outbreaks in
experimentally infected birds. finally, show phylogenetic and
historical evidence support scenario wherein revs originated mammalian
retroviruses accidentally introduced avian hosts late
1930s, experimental studies p. lophurae, subsequently integrated
into fowlpox virus (fwpv) gallid herpesvirus type 2 (ghv-2) genomes,
generating recombinant dna viruses circulate wild birds poultry. 
our findings provide novel perspective origin evolution rev, 
indicate horizontal gene transfer virus families expand the
impact iatrogenic transmission events.
