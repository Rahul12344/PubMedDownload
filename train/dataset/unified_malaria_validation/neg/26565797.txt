cell-cycle progression cell division eukaryotes governed part by
the cyclin family regulation cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks).
cyclins well characterised model systems yeast human
cells, surprisingly little known number role in
plasmodium, unicellular protozoan parasite causes malaria. malaria
parasite cell division proliferation differs many eukaryotes.
during life cycle undergoes two types mitosis: endomitosis asexual
stages extremely rapid mitotic process male gametogenesis. both
schizogony (producing merozoites) host liver red blood cells, and
sporogony (producing sporozoites) mosquito vector, endomitotic with
repeated nuclear replication, without chromosome condensation, cell
division. role specific cyclins plasmodium cell proliferation was
unknown. show plasmodium genome contains three cyclin
genes, representing unusual repertoire cyclin classes. expression and
reverse genetic analyses single plant (p)-type cyclin, cyc3, rodent
malaria parasite, plasmodium berghei, revealed cytoplasmic nuclear location
of gfp-tagged protein throughout lifecycle. deletion cyc3 resulted 
defects size, number growth oocysts, abnormalities budding 
sporozoite formation. furthermore, global transcript analysis cyc3-deleted
and wild type parasites gametocyte ookinete stages identified
differentially expressed genes required signalling, invasion oocyst
development. collectively data suggest cyc3 modulates oocyst
endomitotic development plasmodium berghei.
