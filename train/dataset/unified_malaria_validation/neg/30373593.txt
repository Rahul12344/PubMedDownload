background: malaria still major health problem sub-saharan africa and
south-east asia, research malaria low-income countries a
challenge due lack laboratory equipment. addition, severe malaria
mainly affects young children, limits amount blood available
for research purposes. thus, need protocols yield maximum
of information minimum amount blood, operable basically
equipped laboratories.
results: protocol tandem b helper (th) cell isolation directly from
whole blood, freezer-independent sample preservation method compatible with
the warm humid climate malaria regions established validated. 
protocol thereby circumvents need high-technology centrifuges and
unimpeachable power supply peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation. 
purity yield excellent. depending expression level genes of
interest, 2 5 ml blood adequate reliable qrt-pcr results
from b th cells healthy paediatric donors well paediatric
malaria patients.
conclusion: protocol high purity high yield b cell th cell isolation
and sample storage subsequent qrt-pcr analysis minimal amount blood
is contrivable basic equipment independent continuous power supply.
thus, likely avail many scientists performing malaria research
in rural institutes hospitals, thus countries malaria most
prevalent.
