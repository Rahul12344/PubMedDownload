the unicellular protozoan parasites genus plasmodium impose human
health worldwide enormous burden malaria. possibility genetically
modify several species malaria parasites represented major advance the
possibility elucidate biology turning laboratory lines of
transgenic plasmodium precious weapons fight malaria. amongst various
genetically modified plasmodia, transgenic parasite lines expressing
bioluminescent reporters essential unveil mechanisms parasite
gene expression develop vivo imaging approaches mouse malaria
models. mainly human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum rodent
parasite p. berghei engineered express bioluminescent reporters in
almost developmental stages parasite along complex life cycle 
between insect vertebrate hosts. plasmodium lines expressing
conventional improved luciferase reporters gaining central role 
develop cell based assays much needed search new antimalarial drugs and
to open innovative approaches fundamental applied research in
malaria.
