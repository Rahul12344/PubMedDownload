background: merozoite surface protein (msp)-1 plasmodium falciparum, the
causative agent malaria tropica, considered promising vaccine
candidate. although stable cloning expression difficult the
past, adenoviral vectors expressing complex protein described the
present study.
methods: codon-optimized msp-1 used construct set first generation
(δe1ad) high-capacity adenovirus (hc-ad) vectors, cellular humoral
immune responses induced vectors characterized detail mice.
results: generation stable δe1ad hc-ad vectors expressing full-length
msp-1 production high vector titers found feasible.
epitope identification analysis frequencies specific cd8 t-cells
revealed msp-1 expressing hc-ad vectors induced higher frequencies of
interferon-γ + cd8 t-cells δe1 vectors. irrespective vector format,
higher titers msp-1 specific antibodies generated ad vectors
expressing msp-1 chicken β-actin (cag) promoter comprising the
cytomegalovirus early enhancer element chicken β-actin promoter.
conclusions: findings present study suggest ad vectors expressing
full-length codon-optimized msp-1 promising candidate vaccines against
p. falciparum infections. use hc-ad vector type delivery, well as
the cag promoter control msp-1 expression, may increase efficacy
of vaccine candidate.
