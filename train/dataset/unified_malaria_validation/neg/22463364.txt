background: order prepare field site future interventions, the
prevalence asymptomatic plasmodium falciparum infection evaluated a
cohort children living brazzaville. plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface
protein 2 gene (msp2) used characterize genetic diversity the
multiplicity infection. prevalence mutant p. falciparum chloroquine
resistance transporter (pfcrt) allele isolates also determined.
methods: april june 2010, 313 children 10 years age enrolled
in cohort malaria surveillance screened p. falciparum infection 
using microscopy polymerase chain reaction (pcr). children selected 
on basis asymptomatic. plasmodium falciparum msp2 gene genotyped
by allele-specific nested pcr pfcrt k76t mutation detected using
nested pcr followed restriction endonuclease digestion.
results: prevalence asymptomatic p. falciparum infections 8.6% 16%
by microscopy pcr respectively. allele typing msp2 gene detected
55% 45% 3d7 fc27 allelic families respectively. overall
multiplicity infections (moi) 1.3. positive correlation parasite
density multiplicity infection found. prevalence mutant
pfcrt allele (t76) isolates 92%.
conclusion: first molecular characterization p. falciparum field
isolates congolese children, four years changing malaria treatment
policy chloroquine (cq) artemisinin-based combination therapy (act). 
low prevalence asymptomatic infections moi discussed light of
similar studies conducted central africa.
