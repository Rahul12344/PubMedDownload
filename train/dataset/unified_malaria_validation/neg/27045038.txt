tick saliva contains number effector molecules inhibit host immunity
and facilitate pathogen transmission. tick proteins regulate immune
signaling, however, incompletely understood. here, describe loop 2 
sialostatin l2, anti-inflammatory tick protein, binds annexin a2 and
impairs formation nlrc4 inflammasome infection the
rickettsial agent anaplasma phagocytophilum macrophages deficient annexin a2
secreted significantly smaller amounts interleukin-1β (il-1β) il-18 and
had defect nlrc4 inflammasome oligomerization caspase-1 activation.
accordingly, annexin a2-deficient mice susceptible a.
phagocytophilum infection showed splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and
monocytopenia. providing translational support findings, better binding of
annexin a2 sialostatin l2 sera 21 23 infected patients 
sera control individuals also demonstrated. overall, establish a
unique mode inflammasome evasion pathogen, centered blood-feeding
arthropod.
