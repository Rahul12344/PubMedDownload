background: lung adenocarcinoma (luad) major subtype lung cancer and
the lethal malignant disease worldwide. however, molecular mechanisms
underlying luad fully understood.
methods: four datasets (gse118370, gse85841, gse43458 gse32863) obtained
from gene expression omnibus (geo). identification differentially
expressed genes (degs) functional enrichment analysis performed using
the limma clusterprofiler packages, respectively. protein-protein
interaction (ppi) network constructed via search tool retrieval of
interacting genes (string) database, module analysis performed by
cytoscape. then, overall survival analysis performed using kaplan-meier
curve, prognostic candidate biomarkers analyzed using the
oncomine database.
results: totally, 349 degs identified, including 275 downregulated 74
upregulated genes significantly enriched biological process 
extracellular structure organization, leukocyte migration response to
peptide. mainly enriched pathways complement coagulation cascades,
malaria prion diseases. extracting key modules ppi network, 11
hub genes screened out. survival analysis showed except vsig4, other
hub genes may involved development luad, myh10, mettl7a,
fcer1g tmod1 reported previously correlated luad.
briefly, novel hub genes identified study help deepen our
understanding molecular mechanisms luad carcinogenesis progression,
and discover candidate targets early detection treatment luad.
