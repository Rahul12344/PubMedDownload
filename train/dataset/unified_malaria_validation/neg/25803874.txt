regulated proteolysis known control variety vital processes in
apicomplexan parasites including invasion egress host cells. serine
proteases proposed targets drug development based upon inhibitor
studies show parasite attenuation transmission blockage. genetic studies
suggest serine proteases, subtilisin rhomboid proteases, are
essential functional studies proved challenging active proteases 
difficult express. proteinaceous protease inhibitors (ppis) provide an
alternative way address role serine proteases apicomplexan biology. 
to validate approach, neospora caninum kazal inhibitor (ncpi-s) was
expressed ectopically two apicomplexan species, toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites 
and plasmodium berghei ookinetes, aim disrupt proteolytic processes
taking place within secretory pathway. ncpi-s negatively affected
proliferation toxoplasma tachyzoites, effect invasion and
egress. expression inhibitor p. berghei zygotes blocked their
development mature invasive ookinetes. moreover, ultra-structural
studies indicated expression ncpi-s interfered normal formation of
micronemes, also confirmed lack expression micronemal 
protein soap parasites. results suggest ncpi-s could a
useful tool investigate function proteases processes fundamental for
parasite survival, contributing effort identify targets parasite
attenuation transmission blockage.
