background: present study formulated order determine polymorphism
of dihydropteroate synthetase gene (dhps) plasmodium vivax (p. vivax) in
hormozgan province, southern iran mutations codons 382, 383, 512, 553, and
585 associated resistance p. vivax sulfadoxine.
method: one-hundred eighteen isolates p. vivax prepared within 2007-2008 
to determine dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (dhfr-ts) gene. the
isolates determined study genetic diversity dihydropteroate
synthetase gene (dhps) p. vivax. study performed via pcr test and
nucleotide sequencing.
results: 118 blood samples infected p. vivax, 46 72 samples belonged to
minab jask, respectively. mutation detected 5 target codons.
however, among 118 samples, three isolates (2.54%) found a
mutation new codon 421.
conclusion: since mutation detected dihydrofolate reductase (pvdhfr) gene 
in samples mutation found five main codons pvdhps gene,
it concluded p. vivax, considering mutations pvdhfr, is
still susceptible sulfadoxine therefore, fansidar hormozgan
province, southern iran.
