anopheles gambiae s.l. important malaria vectors, little known about
their genomic variation wild. here, present inter- intraspecies
analysis genome-wide radseq data, three anopheles gambiae s.l. species
collected east africa. mosquitoes fall three genotypic clusters
representing described species (a. gambiae, a. arabiensis, a. merus) 
evidence cryptic breeding units. anopheles merus divergent 
three species, supporting recent new phylogeny based chromosomal inversions.
even though species clusters well separated, extensive shared
polymorphism, particularly a. gambiae a. arabiensis. divergence
between a. gambiae a. arabiensis vary across autosomes is
higher x-linked inversions elsewhere x autosomes, consistent
with suggestion inversion (or gene within it) important in
reproductive isolation species. 2la/2l+(a) inversion shows no
more evidence introgression a. gambiae a. arabiensis rest
of autosomes. population differentiation within a. gambiae a. arabiensis 
is weak approximately 190-270 km, implying strong barriers dispersal. 
analysis tajima's allele frequency spectrum consistent with
modest population increases a. arabiensis a. merus, complex
demographic history expansion followed contraction a. gambiae. although 
they less 200 km apart, two a. gambiae populations show evidence 
different demographic histories.
