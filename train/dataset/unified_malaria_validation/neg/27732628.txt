the malaria parasite, plasmodium, exports protein products infected

nutrient acquisition surface display host interaction ligands. erythrocyte
remodeling impacts parasite virulence disease pathology well
documented human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum, been
less described plasmodium species. p. falciparum, exported
protein skeleton-binding protein 1 (pfsbp1) involved trafficking of
erythrocyte surface ligands localized membranous structures within the
infected erythrocyte, termed maurer's clefts. study, analyzed sbp1
orthologs across plasmodium genus blast analysis conserved gene
synteny, also recently described de niz et al. (2016). evaluate 
the localization sbp1 ortholog, utilized zoonotic malaria parasite, 
plasmodium knowlesi. immunofluorescence assay transgenic p. knowlesi parasites
expressing epitope-tagged recombinant pksbp1 revealed punctate staining pattern
reminiscent maurer's clefts, following infection either monkey human
erythrocytes. recombinant pksbp1-positive puncta co-localized with
giemsa-stained structures, known 'sinton mulligan' stipplings.
immunoelectron microscopy also showed recombinant pksbp1 localizes within or
on membranous structures akin maurer's clefts. recombinant pksbp1 
expressed p. falciparum-infected erythrocytes co-localized pfsbp1 
maurer's clefts, indicating analogous trafficking pattern. member p. 
knowlesi 2tm protein family also expressed localized membranous
structures infected monkey erythrocytes. results suggest the
trafficking machinery induced erythrocyte cellular structures p. knowlesi 
are similar following infection monkey human erythrocytes, are
conserved p. falciparum.
