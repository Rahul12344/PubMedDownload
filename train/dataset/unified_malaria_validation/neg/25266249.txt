pv12, pv38 pv41, three 6-cys family proteins expressed the
blood-stage vivax malaria, might involved merozoite invasion activity
and thus potential vaccine candidate antigens plasmodium vivax. however,
little information available concerning genetic diversity natural
selection three proteins. present study, analyzed amino
acid sequences p. vivax blood-stage 6-cys family proteins comparison with
the homologue proteins plasmodium cynomolgi strain b using bioinformatic
methods. also investigated genetic polymorphisms natural selection of
these three genes p. vivax populations china-myanmar endemic border. 
the three p. vivax blood-stage 6-cys proteins shown possess signal
peptide n-terminus, containing two s48/45 domains, pv12 pv38 
a gpi-anchor motif c-terminus. then, 22, 21 29 haplotypes pv12,
pv38 pv41 identified 45, 38 40 isolates, respectively. the
dn/ds values domain ii pv38 pv41 3.33880 5.99829,
respectively, suggesting positive balancing selection regions.
meanwhile, c-terminus pv41 showed high nucleotide diversity, tajima's 
d test suggested fragment could positive balancing selection. 
overall, results significant implications, providing genetic basis for
blood-stage malaria vaccine development based three 6-cys proteins.
