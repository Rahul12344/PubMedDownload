the recent reports artemisinin (art) resistance thai-cambodian border
area raise serious concern long-term efficacy arts. elucidate 
resistance mechanisms, performed vitro selection dihydroartemisinin
(dha) obtained two parasite clones dd2 25-fold decrease
in susceptibility dha. dha-resistant clones tolerant of
stressful growth conditions resistant several commonly used
antimalarial drugs dd2. result worrisome many drugs are
currently used art partners malaria control. study showed dha
resistance limited ring stage, also occurred trophozoites and
schizonts. microarray biochemical analyses revealed pfmdr1 amplification,
elevation antioxidant defence network, increased expression many
chaperones dha-resistant parasites. without drug pressure, the
dha-resistant parasites reverted sensitivity approximately 8 weeks,
accompanied de-amplification pfmdr1 reduced antioxidant activities. the
parallel decrease increase pfmdr1 copy number antioxidant activity and
the dha sensitivity strongly suggest pfmdr1 antioxidant
defence play role vitro resistance dha, providing potential molecular 
markers art resistance.
