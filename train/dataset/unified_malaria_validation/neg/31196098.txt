background: vivax malaria predominant form malaria outside africa,
affecting 14 million people worldwide, 2.5 billion people
exposed. development plasmodium vivax vaccine priority, merozoite
surface protein 7 (msp-7) proposed plausible candidate. p.
vivax genome contains 12 msp-7 genes, contribute erythrocyte invasion
during blood-stage infection. previous analysis msp-7 sequence diversity
suggested paralogs functionally equivalent. explore msp-7
functional diversity, identify best vaccine candidate within the
family, msp-7 expression antigenicity bloodstream infections were
examined directly clinical isolates.
methods: merozoite surface protein 7 gene expression profiled using rna-seq
data blood samples isolated ten human patients vivax malaria.
differential expression analysis co-expression cluster analysis used 
relate pvmsp-7 expression genetic markers life cycle stage. plasma from
vivax malaria patients also assayed using custom peptide microarray to
measure antibody responses coding regions 12 msp-7 paralogs.
results: ten patients presented diverse transcriptional profiles comprised
four patient groups. two msp-7 paralogs, 7a 7f, expressed abundantly 
all patients, msp-7 genes uniformly rare (e.g. 7j). msp-7h and
7i significantly abundant patient group 4 only, (two patients having
experienced longer patency), co-expressed schizont-stage marker, 
while negatively associated liver-stage gametocyte-stage markers.
screening infections pvmsp-7 peptide array identified 13 linear b-cell
epitopes five msp-7 paralogs recognized plasma patients.
conclusions: results show msp-7 family members vary expression
profile blood infections; msp-7a 7f expressed throughout the
intraerythrocytic development cycle, expression paralogs is
focused schizont. may reflect developmental regulation, and
potentially functional differentiation, within gene family. frequency 
b-cell epitopes among paralogs also varies, msp-7a 7l consistently the
most immunogenic. thus, msp-7 paralogs cannot assumed equal potential 
as vaccines. analysis clinical infections indicates most
abundant immunogenic paralog msp-7a.
