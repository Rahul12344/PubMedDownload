whereas studies extensively examined ability bacteria influence
plasmodium infection mosquito, tripartite interactions between
non-entomopathogenic fungi, mosquitoes, plasmodium parasites remain largely
uncharacterized. report isolation common mosquito-associated
ascomycete fungus, penicillium chrysogenum, midgut field-caught
anopheles mosquitoes. although presence pe. chrysogenum anopheles
gambiae midgut affect mosquito survival, renders mosquito
significantly susceptible plasmodium infection secreted
heat-stable factor. provide evidence mechanism the
fungus-mediated modulation mosquito susceptibility plasmodium involves an
upregulation insect's ornithine decarboxylase gene, sequesters
arginine polyamine biosynthesis. arginine plays important role the
mosquito's anti-plasmodium defense substrate nitric oxide production, and
its availability therefore direct impact mosquito's susceptibility
to parasite. type immunomodulatory mechanism already been
demonstrated host-pathogen interaction systems, first report
of mosquito-associated fungus suppress mosquito's innate immune
system way would favor plasmodium infection possibly malaria
transmission.
