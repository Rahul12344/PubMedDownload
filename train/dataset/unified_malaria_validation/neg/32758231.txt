background: maternal malarial infection leads poor perinatal outcomes,
including low birth weight preterm delivery and/or fetal growth restriction,
particularly primigravidas. placental malaria, plasmodium
falciparum-infected red blood cells cause inflammatory response can
interfere maternal-fetal exchange, leading poor growth. type i
interferon (ifn-i) pathway plays immunomodulatory role viral bacterial 
infections, usually suppressing inflammatory responses. however, role in
placental malaria unknown. study examines cytokine responses in
placental tissue subsets malaria-infected uninfected women, and
attempts correlate particular birth outcomes.
methods: 40 whole placental biopsy samples obtained pregnant women at
least 16 years age recruited larger prospective chemoprevention trial
against malaria. patients tororo district hospital uganda, an
area high malaria endemicity approximately 40% women evidence of
malaria infection delivery. regularly followed local clinic and
monitored fever, blood smears performed time delivery 
diagnose malaria infection. placenta biopsies taken histological
diagnosis placental malaria, well quantitative pcr analysis genes 
the ifn-i pathway (ifn-β, il-10 mx-1). parameters infant birth weight
and gestational age also recorded.
results: histological analysis revealed placental malaria 18 samples, 22
were found uninfected. rt-pcr analysis showed four-fold increase ifn-β
and il-10 expression multigravidas placental malaria compared to
gravidity-matched, uninfected controls. effect observed in
primigravidas. interestingly, linear regression analysis showed positive
association ifn-β levels higher birth weights (β = 101.2 g per
log2-fold increase ifn-β expression, p = 0.042). association was
strongest primigravidas placental malaria (β = 339.0, p = 0.006).
conclusions: results demonstrate differential regulation ifn-i
pathway placental malaria according gravidity, greatest
anti-inflammatory response seen multigravidas. association ifn-β
levels higher birth weight also suggests protective role ifn-i 
fetal growth restriction placental malaria.
