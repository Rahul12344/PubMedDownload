background: targeted amplicon deep sequencing (tads) 16s rrna gene is
commonly used explore characterize bacterial microbiomes. meanwhile,
attempts apply tads detection characterization entire parasitic 
communities hampered since conserved regions many conserved parasite
genes, 18s rrna gene, also conserved eukaryotic hosts.
as result, targeted amplification 18s rrna clinical samples using
universal primers frequently results competitive priming preferential
amplification host dna. here, describe novel method employs single
pair universal primers capture blood-borne parasites reducing
host 18s rrna template enhancing amplification parasite 18s rrna for
tads. achieved using restriction enzymes digest 18s rrna gene 
cut sites present host sequence prior pcr amplification.
results: method validated 16 species blood-borne helminths
and protozoa. enzyme digestion prior pcr enrichment illumina amplicon deep
sequencing led substantial reduction human reads corresponding 5-
to 10-fold increase parasite reads relative undigested samples. method
allowed discrimination common parasitic agents found human blood,
even cases multi-parasite infection, markedly reduced limit of
detection digested versus undigested samples.
conclusions: results herein provide novel methodology reduction 
host dna prior tads establish validity next-generation
sequencing-based platform universal parasite detection.
