transmission malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum human 
mosquito mediated intraerythrocytic gametocytes, which, taken up
during blood meal, become activated initiate sexual reproduction. because
gametocytes parasite stages able establish infection the
mosquito, crucial spreading tropical disease. gametocyte 
maturation, different repertoires genes switched a
well-coordinated sequence, pointing regulatory mechanisms gene expression. 
while epigenetic gene control studied erythrocytic schizogony 
p. falciparum, little known process human-to-mosquito
transmission parasite. unveil potential role histone acetylation
during gene expression gametocytes, carried microarray-based
transcriptome analysis gametocytes treated histone deacetylase
inhibitor trichostatin (tsa). tsa-treatment impaired gametocyte maturation 
lead histone hyper-acetylation stages. comparative transcriptomics
identified 294 transcripts, 2-fold up-regulated during
gametocytogenesis following tsa-treatment. activated gametocytes, were
less sensitive tsa, transcript levels 48 genes increased.
tsa-treatment led repression ~145 genes immature mature
gametocytes 7 genes activated gametocytes. up-regulated genes mainly
associated functions invasion, cytoadherence, protein export, while
down-regulated genes could particularly assigned transcription and
translation. chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated link gene
activation histone acetylation selected genes. among genes
up-regulated tsa-treated mature gametocytes gene encoding ring
finger (ring)-domain protein pfrnf1, putative e3 ligase the
ubiquitin-mediated signaling pathway. immunochemistry demonstrated pfrnf1
expression mainly sexual stages p. falciparum peak expression in
stage ii gametocytes, protein localized nucleus cytoplasm.
pfrnf1 promoter coding regions associated acetylated histones, and
tsa-treatment resulted increased pfrnf1 levels. combined data point 
essential role histone acetylation gene regulation gametocytes, which
can exploited malaria transmission-blocking interventions.
