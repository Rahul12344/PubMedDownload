acute kidney injury (aki) occurs 1% cases malaria; however, in
these cases, mortality rate high 45%. thrombotic microangiopathy
(tma) cause aki malaria rare handful cases documented
in literature far. alternate complement pathway (acp) dysregulation major
mechanism injury development thrombotic microangiopathies well
known. proposed patients preexisting defects acp usually
clinically silent, stress condition infections help manifest them. 
herein, describe presence two complement factor h (cfh) variants 
8-year-old female vivax malaria associated tma. complement workup
confirmed dysregulated acp revealed two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in
cfh gene, i.e. exon-7 rs1061147 (p.ala243ala) exon-9 rs1061170 (p.his402tyr) 
which predisposed patient develop tma precipitated vivax malaria.
