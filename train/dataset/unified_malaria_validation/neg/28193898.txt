rts,s advanced malaria vaccine candidate confers significant protection
against plasmodium falciparum infection humans. little known the
molecular mechanisms driving vaccine immunity. here, applied systems biology
approach study immune responses subjects receiving three consecutive
immunizations rts,s (rrr), receiving two immunizations of
rts,s/as01 following primary immunization adenovirus 35 (ad35) (arr)
vector expressing circumsporozoite protein. subsequent controlled human malaria
challenge (chmi) vaccinees plasmodium-infected mosquitoes, 3 wk after
the final immunization, resulted ∼50% protection groups vaccinees. 
circumsporozoite protein (csp)-specific antibody titers, prechallenge, were
associated protection rrr group. contrast, arr-induced lower
antibody responses, protection associated polyfunctional cd4+ t-cell
responses 2 wk priming ad35. molecular signatures b plasma
cells detected pbmcs highly correlated antibody titers prechallenge 
and protection rrr cohort. contrast, early signatures innate
immunity dendritic cell activation highly associated protection 
the arr cohort. vaccine regimens, natural killer (nk) cell signatures
negatively correlated predicted protection. results suggest that
protective immunity p. falciparum achieved via multiple mechanisms
and highlight utility systems approaches defining molecular correlates 
of protection vaccination.
