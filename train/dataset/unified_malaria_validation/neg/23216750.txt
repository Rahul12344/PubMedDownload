the liver stage first stage malaria parasite replicates the
vertebrate host. however, little known interplay the
parasite liver stage host cell, hepatocyte. study, we
identified exported protein critical role parasite development
in host hepatocytes. expressed sequence tag analysis plasmodium berghei
liver-stage parasites indicated transcripts encoding protein an
n-terminal signal peptide, designated liver-specific protein 2 (lisp2), are
highly expressed stage. expression lisp2 first observed 24 h after
infection rapidly increased liver-stage schizogony.
immunofluorescent staining anti-lsp2 antibodies showed lisp2 was
carried parasitophorous vacuole subsequently transported the
cytoplasm nucleus host hepatocytes. gene targeting experiments
demonstrated majority lisp2-mutant liver-stage parasites arrested
their development formation merozoites. results indicate that
exported lisp2 involved parasite-host interactions required the
development liver-stage parasites inside hepatocytes. study demonstrated 
that mid-to-late liver-stage malarial parasites system exporting
proteins host cell intraerythrocytic stages presumably use
the proteins modify host cell improve environment.
