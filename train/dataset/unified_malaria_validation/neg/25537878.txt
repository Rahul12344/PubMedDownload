background: k13 propeller mutations recently reported serve as
molecular markers, assessment k13 propeller polymorphisms in
multidrug-resistant gene isolates myanmar, especially eastern and
western border areas, crucial understand spread of
artemisinin resistance.
methods: 3-day surveillance study conducted eastern western
border areas myanmar, k13 propeller plasmodium falciparum multidrug
resistance-associated protein 1 (pfmrp1) mutations analyzed.
results: among 1761 suspected malaria cases screened, total 42
uncomplicated falciparum cases eastern border 49 western
border subjected 3 days surveillance artemether-lumefantrine
treatment. parasitemic case showing positivity day 3 noted the
western border, 26.2% (11/42) cases positive eastern border.
although found marked difference prevalence pfmrp1 mutation
in eastern western borders (36% vs 31%, respectively), k13 mutations were
more frequent eastern border area (where 3-day persistent cases were
detected; 48% vs 14%). c580y, m476i, a481v, n458y, r539t, r516y accounted for
68.9% k13 mutations significantly associated day 3 parasitaemia.
conclusions: k13 mutations significantly associated day 3
parasitaemia, emphasizing importance k13 surveillance. low prevalence 
of k13 mutations absence day 3 parasitaemic cases indicate that
artemisinin resistance may spread western myanmar border region. 
although analysis multiple k13 mutations challenging, done 
various sentinel sites myanmar.
