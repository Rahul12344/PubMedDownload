in vertebrates, transferrin (tf) safely delivers iron circulation to
cells. tf-bound iron incorporated tf receptor (tfr) 1-mediated
endocytosis. tfr1 mediate cellular uptake tf h-ferritin, iron 
storage protein. new world arenaviruses, cause hemorrhagic fever, and
plasmodium vivax use tfr1 entry host cells. human tfr2, another receptor
for tf, predominantly expressed hepatocytes erythroid precursors, and
holo-tf dramatically upregulates expression. tfr2 forms complex with
hemochromatosis protein, hfe, serves component iron sensing
machinery hepatocytes. defects tfr2 cause systemic iron overload,
hemochromatosis, down-regulation hepcidin. erythroid cells, tfr2
forms complex erythropoietin receptor regulates erythropoiesis.
tfr2 facilitates iron transport lysosomes mitochondria erythroblasts
and dopaminergic neurons. administration apo-tf, scavenges free iron,
has explored various clinical conditions including atransferrinemia,
iron overload, tissue ischemia. apo-tf also shown ameliorate
anemia animal models β-thalassemia. review, provide update and
summary knowledge mammalian tf receptors.
