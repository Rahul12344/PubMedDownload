plasmodium vivax malaria much less common africa rest world
because parasite relies primarily duffy antigen/chemokine receptor
(darc) invade human erythrocytes, majority africans duffy
negative. recently, dramatic increase reporting p.
vivax cases africa, high number duffy negative
individuals, potentially indicating p. vivax evolved alternative invasion 
mechanism overcome duffy negativity. here, analyzed single nucleotide
polymorphism (snp) copy number variation (cnv) whole genome sequence (wgs)
data 44 p. vivax samples isolated symptomatic malaria patients in
southwestern ethiopia, duffy positive duffy negative individuals
are found. total 123,711 snps detected, 22.7% were
nonsynonymous 77.3% synonymous mutations. largest number snps
were detected chromosomes 9 (24,007 snps; 19.4% total) 10 (16,852 snps,
13.6% total). particularly high levels polymorphism in
erythrocyte binding gene candidates including merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1) 
and merozoite surface protein 3 (msp3.5, msp3.85 msp3.9). two genes, maebl
and msp3.8 related immunogenicity erythrocyte binding function were
detected significant signals positive selection. variation gene copy
number also concentrated genes involved host-parasite interactions,
including expansion duffy binding protein gene (pvdbp) chromosome 6
and msp3.11 chromosome 10. based phylogeny constructed whole
genome sequences, expansion genes independent process among
the p. vivax lineages ethiopia. inferred transmission patterns of
p. vivax infections among study sites showed various levels gene flow a
small geographical scale. genomic features p. vivax provided baseline data
for future comparison duffy-negative individuals allowed us 
develop panel informative single nucleotide polymorphic markers diagnostic
at micro-geographical scale.
