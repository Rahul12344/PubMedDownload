crispr-cas9 technologies enabled genome engineering unprecedented
array species, accelerating biological studies model nonmodel
systems. however, cas9 inherently toxic, limited use some
organisms. previously described serendipitous discovery single guide 
rna (sgrna) helped overcome cas9 toxicity apicomplexan parasite
toxoplasma gondii, enabling first genome-wide loss-of-function screens any
apicomplexan. even presence buffering sgrna, low-level cas9
toxicity persists results frequent loss cas9 expression, can
affect outcome screens. similar cas9-mediated toxicity also been
described organisms. therefore sought define requirements 
stable cas9 expression, comparing different expression constructs and
characterizing role buffering sgrna understand basis cas9
toxicity. find viral 2a peptides substantially improve selection 
and stability cas9 expression. also demonstrate sgrna two
functions: primarily facilitating integration cas9-expression construct
following initial genome targeting secondarily improving long-term parasite
fitness alleviating cas9 toxicity. define set guidelines the
expression cas9 improved stability selection stringency, are
directly applicable variety genetic approaches diverse organisms. 
work also emphasizes need characterizing effects cas9
expression.importance toxoplasma gondii intracellular parasite causes 
life-threatening disease immunocompromised patients affects developing
fetus contracted pregnancy. closely related species cause malaria and
severe diarrhea, thereby constituting leading causes childhood mortality.
despite importance global health, family parasites remained 
enigmatic. given remarkable experimental tractability, t. gondii emerged 
as model also study related parasites. genetic approaches are
important tools studying biology organisms, including t. gondii as
such, recent developments crispr-cas9-based techniques genome editing 
have vastly expanded ability study biology numerous species. in
some organisms, however, crispr-cas9 difficult implement due its
inherent toxicity. research characterizes basis observed toxicity,
using t. gondii model, allowing us develop approaches aid use of
crispr-cas9 diverse species.
