plasmodium parasites possess two endosymbiotic organelles: mitochondrion 
relict plastid called apicoplast. accommodate translational
requirements organelles addition cytosolic translation
apparatus, parasite must maintain supply charged trna molecules 
of compartments. present study investigate parasite
manages translational requirements charged trnacys single
gene cysrs (cysteinyl-trna synthetase). demonstrate single
pfcysrs (plasmodium falciparum cysrs) transcript alternatively spliced, and,
using combination endogenous heterologous tagging experiments p.
falciparum toxoplasma gondii, show cysrs isoforms traffic the
cytosol apicoplast. pfcysrs recognize charge eukaryotic trnacys
encoded plasmodium nucleus well bacterial-type trna encoded by
the apicoplast genome, albeit preference eukaryotic type cytosolic
trna. results present study indicate apicomplexan parasites 
lost original plastidic cysteinyl-trna synthetase, replaced it
with dual-targeted eukaryotic type cysrs recognizes plastid nuclear
trnacys. inhibitors plasmodium dual-targeted cysrs would potentially offer
a therapy capable desirable immediate effects parasite growth well
as irreversibility inhibitors disrupt apicoplast inheritance.
