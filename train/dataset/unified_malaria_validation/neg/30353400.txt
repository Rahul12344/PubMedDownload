purpose review: modern advances malaria rapid diagnostic test (rdt)
technology increased demand low-cost, easy-to-use assays areas
endemic malaria. substantial developments diagnostic sensitivity and
specificity, improvements non-falciparum rdts, novel biotechnological
innovations gradually aligning performance rdts reference-level
diagnostics including pcr expert microscopy gold standards.
recent findings: trends emerged recent malaria rdt literature: (1)
improvements sensitivity specificity rdts plasmodium falciparum
diagnosis, making comparable expert microscopic examination; (2) reduced 
false-positive false-negative reactions novel antibody development; (3) 
improved sensitivity specificity capabilities plasmodium vivax-specific
rdts; (4) developing rdts co-endemic mixed infection differentiation; (5)
significant improvements rdts plasmodium knowlesi; (6) global push
towards assessing confronting growing concerns widespread pfhrp2 gene 
deletions; (7) original innovation loop-mediated isothermal amplification 
(lamp) biotechnological rdt-like platforms demonstrate promising performance
characteristics p. falciparum, p. vivax, p. knowlesi infections. past
5Â years characterized increasing demand malaria rdts,
translating meaningful improvements performance novel
biotechnological innovation. future work facilitate development of
improved rdt platforms plasmodium ovale, p. knowlesi, plasmodium
malariae, surmount issue pfhrp2 gene deletions, maintaining
comparable performance pcr expert microscopy reference standards.
