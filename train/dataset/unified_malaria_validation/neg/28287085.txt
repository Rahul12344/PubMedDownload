eggs produced mature female parasite responsible pathogenesis 
and transmission schistosomiasis. female schistosomes rely unique
male-induced strategy accomplish reproductive development, process is
incompletely understood. map detailed transcriptomic profiles male and
female schistosoma japonicum across eight time points throughout sexual
developmental process pairing maturation. dynamic gene expression
pattern data reveal clear sex-related characteristics, indicative an
unambiguous functional division males females interplay.
cluster analysis, situ hybridization rnai assays indicate males
likely use biogenic amine neurotransmitters nervous system control
and maintain pairing females. addition, analyses indicate that
reproductive development females involves insect-like hormonal regulation. 
these data sets analyses serve foundation deeper study sexual
development pathogen identification novel anti-schistosomal
interventions.
