plasmodium vivax common cause malaria worldwide well as
southeastern turkey. implementation successful national
elimination program local malaria cases reported 2011,
malaria returned county savur located southeastern turkey summer of
2012. present study aimed determine prevalent p. vivax genotypes
isolated southeastern turkey. genetic polymorphism p. vivax csp gene 
analyzed pcr-rflp assess ratio vk210 vk247 types. blood samples 
were obtained 15 patients lived southeastern 2005-2006.
according results, vk210 type detected 10 samples (66.6%), vk247
type observed three samples (20%). remaining two samples showed mixed
infection (13.3%). results present study first time showed ratio
of p. vivax genotypes southeastern turkey elimination 2011. 
results present study enable researchers compare new
isolates previously detected ones design new treatment
and/elimination strategies.
