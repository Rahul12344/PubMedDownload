codon usage bias due non-random usage synonymous codons coding
amino acids. synonymous sites weak selection, codon usage bias 
is maintained equilibrium mutational bias, genetic drift selection 
pressure. differential codon usage choices also relevant human
infecting plasmodium species. recently, p. knowlesi switches natural host,
long-tailed macaques, starts infecting humans. review focuses the
comparative analysis codon usage choices among human infecting p. falciparum
and p. vivax along p. knowlesi species taking coding sequence data.
the variation gc content, amino acid frequencies, effective number codons
and factors plays crucial role determining synonymous codon choices.
within species codon choices similar p. vivax p. knowlesi in
comparison p. falciparum species. study suggests synonymous codon 
choice modulates gene expression level, mrna stability, ribosome speed,
protein folding, translation efficiency accuracy plasmodium species,
and provides valuable information regarding codon usage pattern to
facilitate gene cloning well expression transfection studies for
malaria causing species.
