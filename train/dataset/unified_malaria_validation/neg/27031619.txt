bisulfite sequencing valuable tool mapping position of
5-methylcytosine genome single base resolution. however, associated
chemical treatment causes strand scission, depletes number of
sequenceable dna fragments library thus necessitates pcr amplification. 
the at-rich nature library generated bisulfite treatment adversely
affects amplification, resulting introduction major biases that
can confound methylation analysis. here, report method enables more
accurate methylation analysis, rebuilding bisulfite-damaged components a
dna library. recovery bisulfite treatment (rebuilt) approach enables
pcr-free bisulfite sequencing low nanogram quantities genomic dna. we
apply rebuilt method first whole methylome analysis highly
at-rich genome plasmodium berghei. side-by-side comparison commercial
protocol involving amplification demonstrates substantial improvement in
uniformity coverage reduction sequence context bias. method be
widely applicable quantitative methylation analysis, even technically
challenging genomes, limited sample dna available.
