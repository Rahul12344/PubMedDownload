background: fifteen volunteers immunized three doses plasmid dna
encoding p. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (csp) apical membrane
antigen-1 (ama1) boosted human adenovirus-5 (ad) expressing same
antigens (dna/ad). four volunteers (27%) demonstrated sterile immunity to
controlled human malaria infection and, overall, protection statistically
significantly associated elispot cd8+ cell ifn-γ activities ama1
but csp. dna priming required protection, 18 additional subjects
immunized ad alone (adca) develop sterile protection.
methodology/principal findings: sought identify correlates protection,
recognizing dna-priming may induce different responses adca alone.
among protected volunteers, two three higher elispot cd8+ cell
ifn-γ responses csp ama1, respectively, non-protected volunteers.
unexpectedly, non-protected volunteers adca trial showed elispot cd8+ 
t cell ifn-γ responses ama1 equal higher protected volunteers. 
t cell functionality assessed intracellular cytokine staining ifn-γ, tnf-α
and il-2 likewise distinguish protected non-protected volunteers
across trials. however, three four protected volunteers showed higher
effector central memory cd8+ cell ratios ama1, one csp,
than non-protected volunteers antigens. responses focused 
discrete regions csp ama1. class epitopes restricted a*03 b*58
supertypes within regions ama1 strongly recalled responses three of
four protected volunteers. hypothesize vaccine-induced effector memory
cd8+ cells recognizing single class epitope confer sterile immunity 
p. falciparum humans.
conclusions/significance: suggest better understanding epitopes 
within malaria antigens confer sterile immunity design vaccine
approaches elicit responses epitopes increase potency of
next generation gene-based vaccines.
