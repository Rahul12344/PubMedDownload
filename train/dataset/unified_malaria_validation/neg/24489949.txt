the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi) anchor essential glycolipid that
tethers certain eukaryotic proteins cell surface. core structure of
the gpi anchor remarkably well conserved across evolution consists of
nh2-ch2-ch2-po4-6manα1,2manα1,6manα1,4-glcnα1,6-myo-inositol-po4-lipid. the
glycan portion structure may modified various side-branching
sugars compounds heterogeneous differ organism to
organism. one modification α(1,2)-linked fourth mannose (man-iv) 
is side-branched third mannose (man-iii) trimannosyl core. fungi
and mammals, addition man-iii man-iv occurs two distinct family 22
α(1,2)-mannosyltransferases, gpi10/pigb smp3/pigz, respectively. however, 
the five protozoan parasite genomes examined, genes encoding smp3/pigz
proteins observed, despite reports tetramannosyl-gpi structures
(man4-gpis) produced parasites. study, tested the
hypothesis gpi10/pigb proteins produced protozoan parasites 
ability add man-iii man-iv gpi precursors. used yeast genetics 
to test vivo specificity gpi10/pigb proteins several plasmodium
and trypanosoma species examining ability restore viability to
saccharomyces cerevisiae strains harboring lethal defects man-iii (gpi10δ) 
man-iv (smp3δ) addition gpi precursor lipids. demonstrate genes
encoding pigb enzymes t. cruzi, t. congolense p. falciparum each
capable separately complementing essential gpi10δ smp3δ mutations, while
pigb genes t. vivax t. brucei complement gpi10δ. additionally, we
show ability t. cruzi pigb robustly complement gpi10δ/smp3δ double
mutant. data suggest certain plasmodium trypanosoma pigb
mannosyltransferases transfer one mannose gpi precursors in
vivo, suggest novel biosynthetic mechanism man4-gpis may be
synthesized organisms.
