background: combat malaria transmission, ugandan government embarked
upon ambitious programme indoor residual spraying (irs) carbamate
class insecticide, bendiocarb. preparation campaign, characterized
bendiocarb resistance associated transcriptional variation among anopheles
gambiae s.s. mosquitoes two sites uganda.
results: gene expression two mosquito populations displaying resistance
to bendiocarb (95% 79% an. gambiae s.l. tube bioassay mortality in
nagongera kihihi, respectively) investigated using whole-genome
microarrays. significant overexpression several genes encoding salivary gland 
proteins, including d7r2 d7r4, detected mosquitoes nagongera. 
kihihi, d7r4, two detoxification-associated genes (cyp6m2 gstd3) an
epithelial serine protease among genes highly overexpressed in
resistant mosquitoes. following first round irs nagongera,
bendiocarb-resistant mosquitoes collected, real-time quantitative pcr
analyses detected significant overexpression d7r2 d7r4 resistant
mosquitoes. single nucleotide polymorphism located non-coding transcript
downstream d7 genes found significantly higher frequency in
resistant individuals. silico modelling interaction d7r4 and
bendiocarb demonstrated similarity insecticide serotonin, known
ligand d7 proteins. meta-analysis published microarray studies revealed a
recurring association d7 expression insecticide resistance across
anopheles species locations.
conclusions: whole-genome microarray approach identified association between
novel insecticide resistance candidates bendiocarb resistance uganda. in
addition, single nucleotide polymorphism associated resistance
mechanism discovered. use impartial screening methods allows 
discovery resistance candidates previously-ascribed function in
insecticide binding detoxification. characterizing novel candidates will
broaden understanding resistance mechanisms yield new strategies for
combatting widespread insecticide resistance among malaria vectors.
