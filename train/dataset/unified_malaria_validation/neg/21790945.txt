male gametogenesis occurs directly uptake malaria parasites the
mosquito vector leads release eight nucleated flagellar gametes.
here, report one two parasite actin isoforms, named actin ii, is
essential process. disruption actin ii plasmodium berghei resulted
in viable asexual blood stages, male gametogenesis specifically
inhibited. upon activation, male gametocyte dna replicated normally and
axonemes assembled, egress host cell inhibited, axoneme
motility abolished. major actin isoform, actin i, displayed dual localization
to cytoplasm nucleus male gametocytes. activation actin i
was found restricted cytoplasm. actii(-) mutant parasites, this
re-localization abolished actin remained cellular compartments.
these findings reveal vital pleiotropic functions actin ii isoform in
male gametogenesis malaria parasite.
