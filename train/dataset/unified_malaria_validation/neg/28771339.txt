post-translational lysine acetylation histone tails affects chromatin
accessibility recruitment multifunctional bromodomain-containing proteins 
for modulating transcription. bromodomain- phd finger-containing
transcription factor (bptf) regulates transcription also implicated 
in high gene expression levels variety cancers. report, the
histone variant h2a.z, replaces h2a chromatin, evaluated its
affinity bptf specific recognition pattern acetylated lysine
residues n-terminal tail region. although bptf immunoprecipitates
h2a.z-containing nucleosomes, direct interaction bromodomain not
been reported. using protein-observed fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance (prof
nmr) spectroscopy, identified diacetylation h2a.z lysine residues 4
and 11, highest affinity bptf kd 780 μm. combination 
subsequent 1h nmr carr-purcell-meiboom-gill experiments photo-cross-linking
further confirmed specificity diacetylation pattern lysines 4 and
11. adjacent phd domain, transient interaction may contribute 
to higher-affinity bivalent interaction. evaluation specificity
toward set bromodomains, including two bet bromodomains (brd4 brdt) 
two plasmodium falciparum bromodomains, resulted one midmicromolar affinity
binder, pfgcn5 (kd = 650 μm). biochemical experiments, have
identified direct interaction histone h2a.z bromodomains a
specific acetylation pattern supports role h2a.z in
epigenetic regulation.
