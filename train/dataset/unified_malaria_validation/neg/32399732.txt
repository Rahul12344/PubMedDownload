background: fever unknown origin (fuo) remains important public health
problem. malaria transmission declining parts africa, the
evidence suggests infectious agents account fuo. purpose
of study identify etiologic agents fuo cross-section of
patients mnazi mmoja hospital zanzibar, tanzania.
methodology: multiplex taqman gene expression array card (tac) plates 
used detection classification different pathogens blood samples
obtained patients fuo. logistic regression analyses performed using
pathogens detected sociodemographic characteristics outcome exposure
variables respectively. odd ratios 95% confidence interval calculated
and statistical significance set p < .05.
result: thirty-three different pathogens detected 27 patient blood
samples. following pathogens detected decreasing order prevalence;
dengue virus, plasmodium species, rickettsia, brucella species, salmonella typhi,
and less 1% bartonella, coxiella burnetii, salmonella species,
and leptospira. co-infections plasmodium dengue s. typhi also
detected, including one case three different pathogens-plasmodium,
rickettsia brucella. association etiologic agents of
fuo demographic clinical characteristics.
conclusions: zoonotic arboviral etiological agents fever unknown origin
are present among patients mnazi mmoja hospital zanzibar, tanzania.
there need develop baseline standardized diagnostic approaches
particularly within hospital setting. areas low malaria prevalence
like zanzibar, dengue, rickettsia, coxiella burnetii, brucellosis be
considered clinicians differential diagnoses fuo.
