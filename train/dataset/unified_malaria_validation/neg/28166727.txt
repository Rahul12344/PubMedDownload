background: currently china, trend plasmodium vivax cases imported from
southeast asia increased especially china-myanmar border area. driven 
by increase p. vivax cases stronger need vaccine drug
development, several p. vivax isolates genome sequencing projects underway.
however, little known genetic variability area now.
results: sequencing first p. vivax isolate china-myanmar border
area (cmb-1) generated 120 million paired-end reads. percentage 10.6 
quality-evaluated reads aligned onto 99.9% reference strain sal i
genome 62-fold coverage average 4.8 snps per kb. present a
539-snp marker data set p. vivax identify different parasites from
different geographic origins high sensitivity. also identified
exceptionally high levels genetic variability members multigene families
such rbp, sera, vir, msp3 ap2. de-novo assembly yielded database
composed 8,409 contigs n50 lengths 6.6Â kb revealed 661 novel
predicted genes including 78 vir genes, suggesting greater functional variation
in p. vivax area.
conclusion: result contributes better understanding p. vivax genetic 
variation, provides fundamental basis geographic differentiation of
vivax malaria china-myanmar border area using direct sequencing approach
without leukocyte depletion. novel sequencing method used an
essential tool genomic research p. vivax near future.
