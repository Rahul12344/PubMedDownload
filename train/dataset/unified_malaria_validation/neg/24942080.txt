multiple imputation based chained equations (mice) alternative missing
genotype method use genetic nongenetic auxiliary data inform 
imputation process. previously, mice successfully tested strongly linked
genetic data. tested data hba2 gene which, the
experimental design used malaria association study tanzania, shows high
missing data percentage weakly linked remaining genetic markers
in data set. constructed different imputation models studied their
performance different missing data conditions. overall, mice failed to
accurately predict true genotypes. however, using best imputation model
for data, obtained unbiased estimates genetic effects, and
association signals hba2 gene malaria positivity. whole data
set analyzed imputation model, association signal increased
from 0.80 2.70 imputation, respectively. conversely,
postimputation estimates genetic effects remained relation to
the complete case analysis showed increased precision. argue these
postimputation estimates reasonably unbiased, result good study
design based matching key socio-environmental factors.
