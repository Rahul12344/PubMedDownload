malaria remains major health problem many tropical areas. severe malaria
infection associated secondary complications including anaemia leading to
a need search affordable antimalarial agents clear the
parasitaemia ameliorate anaemia infection. current study
investigated effects transdermally delivered oa malaria parasites, hct 
and selected plasma cytokine concentrations p. berghei-infected male
sprague-dawley rats. study carried period 21days, divided
into pre-treatment (day 0-7), treatment (day 8-12) post-treatment (day 13-21)
periods. parasitaemia, hct, rbc count, hgb, plasma tnf-α, il-6 il-10
concentrations monitored non-infected infected rats following a
once-off application oa-pectin patch (34mg/kg). animals treated with
drug-free pectin chq (30mg/kg, p.o) twice daily 5 consecutive days acted 
as negative positive controls respectively. infected control animals
exhibited increased percentage parasitaemia, tnf-α, il-6, il-10 reduction
in hct. interestingly, oa-pectin patch application cleared malaria parasites 
and increased hct values back normalcy. furthermore, tnf-α, il-6 il-10
were reduced day 12 study. findings suggest oa-pectin
patch delivers therapeutic doses oa able attenuate cytokine
release ameliorate anaemia malaria infection. therefore, transdermally
delivered oa may potent therapeutic agent malaria amelioration of
anaemia.
