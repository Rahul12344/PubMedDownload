the concurrence malaria hemoglobinopathies, observed malaria endemic
regions, reflects phenomenon natural selection. since life cycle of
the malaria parasite erythrocytic stage, abnormalities red blood
cells (rbcs) hinder parasite's survival human host. hemoglobin (hb)
variants affect life span rbcs thus lower chance infection by
the parasite. change one hb genes offers protection
against malaria, change alleles results β-thalassemia major (β-tm). 
striking geographical heterogeneity β-thalassemia (β-thal) observed. 
moving mexico west china towards east, spectrum of
mutations β-globin gene seen vary. western end the
thalassemia belt, defects first intervening sequence (ivs-i) exon 2 of
the β-globin gene common, eastern coast, ivs-ii exon 1 
are also vulnerable mutations. worldwide increase incidence β-tm
mandates need efficient measures reduce β-thal births, the
geographical heterogeneity β-thal alleles reduces burden genetic
testing fetuses suspected carrying mutant allele. present review, 
the common mutations global thalassemia belt illustrated, and
the possible factors affect mutagenicity sites discussed. a
biogeographic analysis may provide insight non biological factors
influencing different loci β-globin gene different geographical regions
is suggested.
