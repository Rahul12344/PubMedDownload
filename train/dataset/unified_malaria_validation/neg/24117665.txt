it previously shown interethnic differences in
susceptibility malaria two sympatric ethnic groups mali, fulani
and dogon. lower susceptibility plasmodium falciparum malaria seen 
the fulani fully explained genetic polymorphisms previously known
to associated malaria resistance, including haemoglobin (hbs),
haemoglobin c (hbc), alpha-thalassaemia glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(g6pd) deficiency. given observed differences distribution fcγriia 
allotypes among different ethnic groups malaria susceptibility have
been reported, analysed rs1801274-r131h polymorphism fcγriia gene
in study dogon fulani mali (n = 939). confirm fulani have
less parasite densities, less parasite prevalence, spleen enlargement and
higher levels total igg antibodies (anti-csp, anti-ama1, anti-msp1 and
anti-msp2) total ige (p < 0.05) compared dogon ethnic group.
furthermore, fulani exhibit higher frequencies blood group (56.5%)
compared dogon (43.5%) (p < 0.001). regard fcγriia
polymorphism allele frequency, fulani group higher frequency of
the h allele (fulani 0.474, dogon 0.341, p < 0.0001), associated with
greater total ige production (p = 0.004). findings show fcγriia
polymorphism might implication relative protection seen the
fulani tribe, confirmatory studies required malaria endemic
settings.
