background: lack continuous long-term vitro culture system for
plasmodium vivax severely limits knowledge pathophysiology most
widespread malaria parasite. gain direct understanding p. vivax human
infections, used next generation sequencing data mining unravel parasite in
vivo expression profiles p. vivax, p. falciparum comparison.
results: performed cloud local computing extract parasite
transcriptomes publicly available raw data human blood samples. we
developed poisson modelling (pm) method confidently identify parasite
derived transcripts mixed rnaseq signals infected host tissues. we
successfully retrieved reconstructed parasite transcriptomes infected
patient blood early first blood stage cycle; methodology
did recover significant signal controls. surprisingly, first
generation blood parasites already show strong signature transmission, which
indicates commitment asexual-to-sexual stages. further, place the
results within context p. vivax's complex life cycle, developing
mathematical models p. vivax p. falciparum using sensitivity analysis
assess relative epidemiological impact possible early stage transmission.
conclusion: study uncovers earliest onset p. vivax blood pathogenesis 
and highlights challenges p. vivax eradication programs.
