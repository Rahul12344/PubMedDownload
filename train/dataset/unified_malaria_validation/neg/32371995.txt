parasite-mediated diseases like malaria schistosomiasis growing health
problems worldwide novel drug candidates urgently needed. study, 
the in-vitro safety profile steroid compound 1o (sc1o), effective 
parasites plasmodium falciparum schistosoma mansoni ic50 value of
5 nm, characterized. assessed viability/proliferation, apoptosis cell 
cycle tests determine cytotoxic profile sc1o cancer cells. the
mutagenic potential determined ames test. identify off-target
effects investigated whether sc1o interacts safety-relevant molecules
such cytochrome p450 (cyp) enzymes, phosphodiesterases (pde), histone
deacteylases (hdac) human ether-a-go-go related gene (herg). furthermore, 
predict potential bioavailability sc1o, effect caco-2 cell barrier 
integrity, measurement transepithelial electrical resistance (teer),
was determined. sc1o 25 µm reduced cell viability, probably cell-cycle
arrest, induce apoptosis cancer cells. adverse off-target
effects mutagenic potential sc1o observed. furthermore, sc1o 
disturb integrity cell barrier, exhibited low membrane
permeability, apparently due cell adherence. conclusion, sc1o 10 µm
showed good in-vitro safety profile.
