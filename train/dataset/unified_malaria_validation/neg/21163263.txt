protein translation plastid (apicoplast) plasmodium spp. immense 
interest target potential anti-malarial drugs. however, molecular
data apicoplast translation needed optimisation development novel
inhibitors lacking. report characterisation two key translation
elongation factors plasmodium falciparum, apicoplast-encoded elongation factor
pfef-tu nuclear-encoded pfef-ts. recombinant pfef-tu hydrolysed gtp and
interacted presumed nuclear-encoded partner pfef-ts. ef-tu inhibitor
kirromycin affected pfef-tu activity vitro, indicating apicoplast ef-tu
is indeed target drug. predicted pfef-ts leader sequence targeted
gfp apicoplast, confirming pfef-ts functions organelle.
recombinant pfef-ts mediated nucleotide exchange pfef-tu homology modeling
of pfef-tu:pfef-ts complex revealed pfef-ts-induced structural alterations
that would expedite gdp release pfef-tu. results establish functional
interaction two apicoplast translation factors encoded genes residing 
in different cellular compartments highlight significance their
sequence/structural differences bacterial elongation factors relation 
inhibitor activity. data provide experimental system study the
effects novel inhibitors targeting pfef-tu pfef-tu.pfef-ts interaction.
our finding apicoplast ef-tu possesses chaperone-related disulphide
reductase activity also provides rationale retention tufa gene on
the plastid genome.
