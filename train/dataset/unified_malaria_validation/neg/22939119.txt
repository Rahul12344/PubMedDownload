studies avian haemosporidia rise, still lack basic
understanding ecological evolutionary factors mold distributions
of haemosporidia among species bird community. studied the
structure organization local avian haemosporidian assemblage (genera
plasmodium haemoproteus) cerrado biome central brazil 5 years. 
we obtained 790 blood samples 54 bird species 166 (21%) were
infected haemosporidians based molecular diagnostics. partial sequences
of parasite cytochrome b gene revealed 18 differentiated avian haemosporidian
lineages. also analysed relationship life-history traits (i.e., nesting
height, migration status, nest type, sociality, body mass, embryo development
period) 14 abundant bird species prevalence avian
haemosporidia. found host species bred socially presented a
higher prevalence haemoproteus (parahaemoproteus) bird species bred 
in pairs. thus, aspects host behaviour could responsible differential
exposure vectors. assemblage avian haemosporidia studied also
confirms pattern emerging recent studies using molecular markers 
identify avian haemosporidians, namely many lineages host generalists.
