allelic heterogeneity common phenomenon gene exhibits different
phenotype depending nature genetic mutations. context of
genes affecting malaria susceptibility, allowed us explore understand
the intricate host-parasite interactions malaria infections. this
study, described gene encoding erythrocytic ankyrin-1 (ank-1) exhibits
allelic-dependent heterogeneous phenotypes malaria infections. we
conducted enu mutagenesis screen mice identified two ank-1 mutations,
one resulting amino acid substitution (mri95845), truncated
ank-1 protein (mri96570). mutations caused hereditary spherocytosis-like
phenotypes confer differing protection plasmodium chabaudi
infections. upon examination, ank-1(mri96570) mutation found to
inhibit intraerythrocytic parasite maturation, whereas ank-1(mri95845) caused
increased bystander erythrocyte clearance infection. first
description allelic heterogeneity ankyrin-1 direct comparison
between two ank-1 mutations. despite lack direct evidence population 
studies, data supported protective roles ankyrin-1 mutations 
in conferring malaria protection. study also emphasized importance of
such phenomena achieving better understanding host-parasite interactions,
which could basis future studies.
