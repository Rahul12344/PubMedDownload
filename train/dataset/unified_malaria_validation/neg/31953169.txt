malaria parasites proliferate repeated invasion multiplication within
erythrocytes vertebrate host. sexually committed intraerythrocytic
parasites undergo sexual stage differentiation become gametocytes. after
ingestion mosquito, male female gametocytes egress erythrocytes
and fertilize within mosquito midgut. complex signaling pathway likely
responds environmental events trigger gametogenesis regulate
fertilization; however, knowledge remains limited malaria parasites.
several pseudokinases highly transcribed gametocyte stage are
possible multi-functional regulators controlling critical steps life
cycle. characterized one pseudokinase, termed pyppk1, plasmodium
yoelii highly expressed schizonts male gametocytes.
immunofluorescence assays parasites expressing myc-tagged pyppk1 confirmed
that pyppk1 protein expressed schizonts sexual stage parasites.
transgenic δppk1 parasites, pyppk1 gene locus deleted the
crispr/cas9 method, showed significant growth defect reduced virulence in
mice. blood stage, δppk1 parasites able egress erythrocytes
similar wild type parasites; however, erythrocyte invasion efficacy was
significantly reduced. sexual stage development, clear changes were
seen male female gametocytemias well gametocyte egress from
erythrocytes; but, number exflagellation centers oocysts were
significantly reduced δppk1 parasites. taken together, pyppk1 important
role erythrocyte invasion exflagellation center formation.
