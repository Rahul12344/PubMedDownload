from september 2012 may 2018, blood samples 364 raptors (mostly adults)
were collected screened trypanosomes haemosporidians microscopic
examination nested polymerase chain reactions (pcr). trypanosoma spp. were
identified 15 birds eight different species. light microscopy revealed 14
cases infection trypanosoma cf. corvi, including one in
black-shouldered kite (elanus caeruleus, n = 49), brahminy kite (haliastur indus,
n = 50), spotted owlet (so, athene brama, n = 27); two mountain hawk-eagles
(spizaetus nipalensis, n = 3); three asian barred owlets (abo,
glaucidium cuculoides, n = 27), barn owls (bo, tyto alba, n = 65) collared
scops owls (cso, otus lettia, n = 41). addition, one case infection t.
avium identified oriental scops owl (oso, otus sunia, n = 2). all
infected raptors showed low parasitemia levels. pcr detected three 
positives one cso, one japanese sparrowhawk (accipiter gularis), one oso. 
the sensitivity specificity pcr method 93.3% 99.1%,
respectively. overall infection rate low (4.9%). highest
infection rate recorded cold-dry season (9.9%). coinfection plasmodium 
with trypanosomes found three abos. coinfection haemoproteus spp.
was found one bo, three csos, one so. coinfection haemoproteus spp.
and leucocytozoon danilewskyi found oso. microfilarias detected
in one abo one cso. ultrastructure trypomastigotes t. cf. corvi 
an abo revealed fine structures. small subunit ribosomal rna (ssu rrna)
sequences belong two clades: t. avium t. corvi-culicavium complex/group.
ssu rrna gene amplification successful one bo. raptors with
trypanosome infections showed normal hematological values healthy appearance.
furthermore, first report t. avium nocturnal raptor from
thailand.
