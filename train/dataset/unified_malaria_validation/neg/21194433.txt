background: control vectors malaria threatened spread of
insecticide resistance. one factor hitherto largely overlooked is
the potential effects insecticide resistance ability mosquitoes to
transmit malaria: insecticide-resistant mosquitoes good vectors of
plasmodium susceptible ones? drastic physiological changes accompany 
the evolution insecticide resistance may indeed alter ability vectors
to transmit diseases, possibility that, confirmed, could major
epidemiological consequences.
methods: using novel experimental system consisting avian malaria
parasite (plasmodium relictum) natural vector (the mosquito culex
pipiens), two common mechanisms insecticide resistance (esterase
overproduction acetylcholinesterase modification) investigated their
effect mosquito infection rate parasite burden. purpose two types
of experiments carried using (i) insecticide-resistant susceptible
laboratory isogenic lines cx. pipiens (ii) wild cx. pipiens collected from
a population insecticide resistant susceptible mosquitoes coexist in
sympatry.
results: isogenic line wild-caught mosquito experiments highly
consistent showing effect either esterase overproduction of
acetylcholinesterase modification either infection rate oocyst
burden mosquitoes. determinant traits blood meal size,
which similar across different insecticide resistant categories both
experiments.
conclusions: insecticide resistance found effect plasmodium
development within mosquito. first time question been
addressed using natural mosquito-plasmodium combination, taking care to
standardize genetic background insecticide resistance genes
operate. infection rate oocyst burden two factors that
determine vectorial capacity mosquitoes. key determinants of
parasite transmission, mosquito longevity behaviour, the
parasite's incubation time, need investigated concluding whether 
insecticide resistance influences ability mosquitoes transmit malaria.
