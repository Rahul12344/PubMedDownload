background: shown nearly quarter initial predicted gene
models plasmodium falciparum genome contain errors. although have
been efforts obtain complete cdna sequences correct errors, the
coverage cdna sequences predicted genes still incomplete, many
gene models expressed sexual mosquito stages been
validated. antisense transcripts widely reported p. falciparum;
however, extent pattern antisense transcripts different
developmental stages remain largely unknown.
results: sequenced seven bidirectional libraries ring, early and
late trophozoite, schizont, gametocyte ii, gametocyte v, ookinete, four
strand-specific libraries late trophozoite, schizont, gametocyte ii, and
gametocyte v 3d7 parasites. alignment cdna sequences 3d7
reference genome revealed stage-specific antisense transcripts novel
intron-exon splicing junctions. sequencing strand-specific cdna libraries
suggested genes expressed one direction gametocyte in
schizont. alternatively spliced genes, antisense transcripts, stage-specific 
expressed genes also characterized.
conclusions: necessary continue sequence cdna different
developmental stages, particularly non-erythrocytic stages. presence
of antisense transcripts gametocyte ookinete genes suggests that
these antisense rna may play important role gene expression regulation 
parasite development. future gene expression studies make use of
directional cdna libraries. antisense transcripts may partly explain observed
discrepancy levels mrna protein expression.
