populations target interventions aiming block disease transmission.
here, used dna microarrays profile developmental transcriptomes 
rodent malaria parasite plasmodium berghei vivo, midgut anopheles
gambiae mosquitoes, parasite stages midgut blood bolus sporulating
oocysts basal gut wall. data analysis identified several distinct
transcriptional programmes encompassing genes putatively involved in
developmental processes interactions mosquito. least two of
these programmes associated ookinete development linked to
mosquito midgut invasion establishment infection. targeted disruption by
homologous recombination two genes resulted mutant parasites
exhibiting notable infection phenotypes. gamer encodes short polypeptide with
granular localization gametocyte cytoplasm shows highly penetrant
loss-of-function phenotype manifested greatly reduced ookinete numbers, linked
to impaired male gamete release. hado encodes putative magnesium phosphatase
with distinctive cortical localization along concave ookinete periphery.
disruption hado compromises ookinete development leading significant
reduction oocyst numbers. data provide important insights the
molecular framework underpinning plasmodium development mosquito and
identifies two genes important functions initial stages parasite
development mosquito midgut.
