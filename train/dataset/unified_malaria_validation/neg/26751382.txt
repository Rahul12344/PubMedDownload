the plasmodium falciparum vitro culture system critical genotypic and
phenotypic analyses parasites. genotypic analysis, genomic dna can
be obtained directly patient blood sample culture adapted
parasites whereas phenotypic analysis, immediate ex vivo vitro culture 
adapted parasites used. however, parasite biology studies not
investigated whether culture adaptation process affects genotypic and/or
phenotypic characteristics parasites short- long-term cultures.
here, set study dynamics stability parasite genetic and
phenotypic profiles field isolate parasites adapted continuous
cultures. parasites collected three different patients presenting with
uncomplicated malaria adapted maintained drug-free continuous
cultures. aliquots continuous cultures collected every 24-48 hours 
for analyses. aliquot treated separate parasite sample. genetic
analysis, microsatellite (ms) typing single nucleotide polymorphism (snp)
analyses 23 drug resistance markers done. 50% inhibitory
concentrations (ic50) samples also established four
antimalarial drugs. samples patient (parasite-line) compared as
they passed continuous culture. data revealed genotypic and
phenotypic profiles three parasite-lines fluctuated one generation
to next specific pattern periodicity. exceptions,
multilocus analysis revealed samples parasite-line high genetic
diversity unique haplotypes. interestingly, changes ms snp profiles
occurred simultaneously. difference ic50s samples each
parasite-line reached statistical significance. however, phenotypic changes did
not correspond correlate genotypic changes. study revealed parasite
genetic phenotypic characteristics fluctuates short- long-term
cultures, indicates parasite genetic information obtained even short
cultures likely different natural infection parasites.
