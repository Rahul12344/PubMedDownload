involved developmental switch asexual development sexual
differentiation maturation survival gametocytes. here, show that
a gene coding novel putative transporter, npt1, plays crucial role the
development plasmodium berghei gametocytes. parasites lacking npt1 are
severely compromised production gametocytes rare gametocytes

plasmodium species suggest protein could attractive target for
