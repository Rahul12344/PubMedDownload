carbamates increasingly used vector control notably areas with
pyrethroid resistance. however, cross-resistance insecticides 
major malaria vectors anopheles funestus could severely limit available
resistance management options. unfortunately, molecular basis such
cross-resistance remains uncharacterized an. funestus, preventing effective
resistance management. here, using genomewide transcription profiling, we
revealed metabolic resistance upregulation cytochrome p450 genes 
is driving carbamate resistance. p450s cyp6p9a, cyp6p9b cyp6z1 the
most upregulated detoxification genes multiple resistant mosquitoes.
however, silico docking simulations predicted cyp6z1 metabolize both
pyrethroids carbamates, whereas cyp6p9a cyp6p9b predicted to
metabolize pyrethroids. using recombinant enzyme metabolism and
inhibition assays, demonstrated cyp6z1 metabolizes bendiocarb and
pyrethroids, whereas cyp6p9a cyp6p9b metabolize pyrethroids. other
upregulated gene families resistant mosquitoes included several cuticular
protein genes suggesting possible reduced penetration resistance mechanism.
investigation target-site resistance acetylcholinesterase 1 (ace-1)
gene detected established association new n485i mutation 
bendiocarb resistance (odds ratio 7.3; p < 0.0001). detection multiple
haplotypes single mosquitoes cloning suggested duplication ace-1.
a taqman genotyping n485i nine countries revealed mutation 
located southern africa frequency 10-15% suggesting recent
occurrence. findings help monitoring spread evolution of
carbamate resistance improve design effective resistance management
strategies control malaria vector.
