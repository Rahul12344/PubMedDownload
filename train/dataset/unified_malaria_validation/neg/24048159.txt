considerable research effort directed understanding genetic and
molecular basis mosquito innate immune mechanisms. whether environmental
factors interact mechanisms shape overall resistance remains
largely unexplored. here, examine changes mean ambient temperature,
diurnal temperature fluctuation time day infection affected the
immunity resistance anopheles stephensi infection escherichia
coli. used quantitative pcr estimate gene expression three immune
genes response challenge heat-killed e. coli. also infected
mosquitoes live e. coli ran bacterial growth assays quantify host
resistance. mosquito immune parameters resistance directly affected
by mean temperature, diurnal temperature fluctuation time day of
infection. furthermore, suite complex two- three-way
interactions yielding idiosyncratic phenotypic variation different
environmental conditions. results demonstrate mosquito immunity and
resistance strongly influenced complex interplay environmental
variables, challenging interpretation many mosquito immune
studies conducted standard laboratory conditions.
