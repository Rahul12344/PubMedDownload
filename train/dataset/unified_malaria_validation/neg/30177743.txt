during malaria infection, plasmodium spp. parasites cyclically invade red blood
cells follow two different developmental pathways. either
replicate asexually sustain infection, differentiate gametocytes, 
the sexual stage taken mosquitoes, ultimately leading to
disease transmission. despite importance malaria control, process 
gametocytogenesis remains poorly understood, partially due difficulty of
generating high numbers sexually committed parasites laboratory
conditions1. recently, apicomplexa-specific transcription factor (ap2-g) was
identified necessary gametocyte production multiple plasmodium
species2,3, suggested epigenetically regulated master switch that
initiates gametocytogenesis4,5. show rodent malaria parasite,
plasmodium berghei, conditional overexpression ap2-g used to
synchronously convert great majority population fertile
gametocytes. discovery allowed us redefine time frame sexual
commitment, identify number putative ap2-g targets chart sequence of
transcriptional changes gametocyte development, including observation
that gender-specific transcription occurred within 6â€‰h induction. data
provide entry points detailed characterization key process
required malaria transmission.
