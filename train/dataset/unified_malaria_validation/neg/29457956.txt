self-propagating gene drive technologies number desirable
characteristics warrant development control insect pest and
vector populations, malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. theoretically
easy deploy self-sustaining, tools may used generate
cost-effective interventions benefit society without obvious bias related to
wealth, age education. species-specific design offers potential to
reduce environmental risks aim compatible complementary 
control strategies, potentially expediting elimination eradication of
malaria. number strategies proposed gene-drive based control
of malaria mosquito recent demonstrations shown proof-of-principle
in laboratory. though several technical, ethical regulatory challenges
remain, none appear insurmountable research continues step-wise open 
manner.
