background: although number plasmodium vivax proteins identified, 
few investigated potential vaccine candidates. study
characterized plasmodium vivax merozoite surface antigen 180 (pvmsa180,
pvx_094920), novel p. vivax antigenic protein.
methods: target gene amplified four overlapping domains (d1, d2, d3
and d4) enable expression recombinant protein using cell-free and
bacterial expression systems. recombinant pvmsa180 proteins used in
protein microarrays evaluate humoral immune response 72 vivax-infected 
patients 24 vivax-naïve individuals. antibodies produced mice 
pvmsa180-d1 -d4 domains used assess subcellular localization of
schizont-stage parasites immunofluorescence assays. total 51 pvmsa180
sequences 12 countries (41 sequences plasmodb 6 generated this
study) used determine genetic diversity genealogical
relationships dnasp network software packages, respectively.
results: pvmsa180 consists 1603 amino acids predicted molecular mass of
182 kda, signal peptide amino-terminus. total 70.8% of
patients (51/72) showed specific antibody response least one the
pvmsa180 domains, 20.8% (15/72) exhibited robust antibody response at
least three domains. findings suggest pvmsa180 targeted by
the humoral immune response natural infection p. vivax.
immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated pvmsa180 localized the
merozoite surface schizont-stage parasites, pvmsa180 sequences originating
from various geographic regions worldwide showed low genetic diversity.
twenty-two haplotypes found, haplotype 6 (hap_6, 77%) pvmsa180 was
detected isolates six countries.
conclusions: novel p. vivax surface protein, pvmsa180, characterized in
this study. p. vivax-infected patients specific antibodies against
particular antigenic domains, indicating protein immunogenic in
naturally exposed populations. genetic analysis worldwide isolates showed that
pvmsa180 less polymorphic well-known candidates some
haplotypes common several countries. however, additional studies a
larger sample size necessary evaluate antibody responses in
geographically separated populations, identify function pvmsa180
during parasite invasion.
