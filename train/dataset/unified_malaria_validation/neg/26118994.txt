functional analysis essential genes malarial parasite, plasmodium, is
hindered lack efficient strategies conditional protein regulation. we
report development rapid, specific, inducible chemical-genetic tool 
in rodent malaria parasite, p. berghei, endogenous proteins
engineered contain auxin-inducible degron (aid) selectively degraded
upon adding auxin. application aid calcium-regulated protein
phosphatase, calcineurin, revealed functions host vector stages of
parasite development. whereas depletion calcineurin late-stage schizonts
demonstrated critical role erythrocyte attachment invasion vivo,
stage-specific depletion uncovered roles gamete development, fertilization,
and ookinete-to-oocyst sporozoite-to-liver stage transitions. furthermore,
aid technology facilitated concurrent generation phenotyping transgenic
lines, allowing multiple lines assessed simultaneously significant
reductions animal use. study highlights broad applicability aid
for functional analysis proteins across plasmodium life cycle.
