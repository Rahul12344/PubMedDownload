agamococcidians enigmatic poorly studied parasites marine
invertebrates unexplored diversity unclear relationships other
sporozoans human pathogens plasmodium toxoplasma. believed 
that agamococcidians capable sexual reproduction, essential
for life cycle completion well studied parasitic apicomplexans. here, we
describe three new species agamococcidians belonging genus
rhytidocystis. examined cell morphology ultrastructure, resolved
their phylogenetic position using near-complete rrna operon sequences, and
searched genes associated meiosis oocyst wall formation two
rhytidocystid transcriptomes. phylogenetic analyses consistently recovered
rhytidocystids basal coccidiomorphs away corallicolids,
demonstrating order agamococcidiorida levine, 1979 polyphyletic.
light transmission electron microscopy revealed development of
rhytidocystids begins inside gut epithelial cells, characteristic which
links specifically coccidiomorphs exclusion gregarines 
and suggests intracellular invasion evolved early coccidiomorphs. 
propose new superorder eococcidia early coccidiomorphs. transcriptomic
analysis demonstrated meiotic machinery oocyst wall proteins
are preserved rhytidocystids. conservation meiotic genes and
ultrastructural similarity rhytidocystid trophozoites macrogamonts true 
coccidians point undescribed, cryptic sexual process group.
