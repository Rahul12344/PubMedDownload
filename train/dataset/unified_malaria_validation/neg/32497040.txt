insecticide resistance malaria vectors threatens reverse recent gains in
malaria control. deciphering patterns gene flow resistance evolution in
malaria vectors crucial improving control strategies preventing malaria
resurgence. genome-wide survey anopheles funestus genetic diversity
africa-wide revealed evidences major division southern africa and
elsewhere, associated different population histories. three genomic regions 
exhibited strong signatures selective sweeps, spanning major resistance
loci (cyp6p9a/b, gste2 cyp9k1). however, sharp regional contrast was
observed populations correlating gene flow barriers. signatures of
complex molecular evolution resistance detected evidence copy
number variation, transposon insertion gene conversion cyp6p9a/b
paralog genes. temporal analyses samples bed net scale up
suggest genomic changes driven control intervention.
multiple independent selective sweeps locus different parts of
africa suggests local evolution resistance malaria vectors may a
greater threat trans-regional spread resistance haplotypes.
