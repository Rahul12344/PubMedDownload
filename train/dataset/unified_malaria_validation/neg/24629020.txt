background: malaria remains major public health problem, control has
been hampered drug resistance. number drugs, plasmodium falciparum
single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) associated altered drug
sensitivity used markers drug resistance. several techniques
have studied assess resistance markers. widely used methodology 
is restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis. ligase detection
reaction fluorescent microsphere (ldr-fm) assay recently shown provide
high throughput assessment p. falciparum snps associated drug resistance.
the aim study validate reliability accuracy ldr-fm 
assay field setting.
methods: 223 samples clinical trial tororo, uganda p.
falciparum identified blood smear, dna extracted dried blood
spots, genes interest amplified pcr, amplicons analysed both
rflp ldr-fm assays, results compared.
results: snp prevalence (wild type/mixed/mutant) rflp analysis 8/5/87%
for pfcrt k76t, 34/37/29% pfmdr1 n86y, 64/17/19% pfmdr1 y184f, and
42/21/37% pfmdr1 d1246y. prevalences ldr-fm assay were
7/5/88%, 31/24/45%, 62/20/18%, 48/19/33% four snps, respectively.
combining mixed mutant outcomes analysis, agreement assays
was 97% (k=0.77) pfcrt k76t, 79% (k=0.55) pfmdr1 n86y, 83% (k=0.65) for
pfmdr1 y184f, 91% (k=0.82) pfmdr1 d1246y, disagreements due 
discrepant readings mixed genotypes.
conclusion: ldr-fm assay provides high throughput, relatively inexpensive
and accurate assay surveillance p. falciparum snps associated with
drug resistance resource-limited countries.
