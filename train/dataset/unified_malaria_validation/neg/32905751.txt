african apes harbor least twelve plasmodium species, a
source human infection. well established plasmodium falciparum 
emerged following transmission gorilla parasite, perhaps within last
10,000 years, plasmodium vivax emerged earlier parasite lineage that
infected humans apes africa duffy-negative mutation eliminated 
the parasite humans there. compared ape relatives, human
parasites greatly reduced genetic diversity excess nonsynonymous
mutations, consistent severe genetic bottlenecks followed rapid
population expansion. putative new plasmodium species widespread in
chimpanzees, gorillas, bonobos places origin plasmodium malariae in
africa. here, review known origins evolutionary history 
of human-infective plasmodium species, time circumstances their
emergence, diversity, host specificity, zoonotic potential their
ape counterparts.
