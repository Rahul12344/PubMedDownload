artemisinin, sesquiterpene lactone isolated artemisia annua l. (sweet
wormwood), extensively used treatment malaria. order better
understand metabolism terpenes a. annua influence terpene
synthases artemisinin yield, expression pattern monoterpene alcohol
dehydrogenase (adh2) studied using transgenic plants expressing
promoter-β-glucuronidase (gus) fusion. adh2 played major role monoterpenoid 
biosynthesis including carveol, borneol, artemisia ketone vitro
biochemical analysis. study, adh2 promoter cloned genome
walking method. number putative cis-acting elements predicted in
promoter region, suggesting adh2 driven complex regulation
mechanism. adh2 gene highly expressed old leaves, whereas artemisinin 
biosynthetic genes mainly expressed bud young leaves. expression 
of adh2 gene increased quickly leaf development, revealed qrt-pcr. gus 
expression analysis different tissues transgenic a. annua demonstrates that
adh2 expression exclusively located t-shaped trichome, glandular
secretory trichome.
