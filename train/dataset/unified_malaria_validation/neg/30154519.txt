antimalarial drug resistance major public health problem china. 2012
to 2015, 75% malaria cases shandong province p. falciparum
returned africa. however, molecular marker polymorphisms drug resistance 
in imported p. falciparum cases evaluated. study, we
analyzed polymorphisms pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfkelch13 genes 282â€‰p.
falciparum cases returned africa shandong 2012 2015. among
the isolates, polymorphisms detected codons 74-76 pfcrt 86, 184,
1246 pfmdr1, among k76t (36.6%) y184f (60.7%) most
prevalent, respectively. six pfcrt haplotypes 11 pfmdr1 haplotypes were
identified comparison made prevalence haplotypes among east
africa, west africa, central africa south africa. one synonymous 9
nonsynonymous mutations pfkelch13 detected isolates (4.6%), among 
which candidate artemisinin (art) resistance mutation p553l observed. the
study establishes fundamental data detection chloroquine resistance (cqr) 
and art resistance molecular markers imported p. falciparum china,
and also enriches genetic data antimalarial resistance malaria 
endemic countries africa.
