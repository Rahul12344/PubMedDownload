plasmodium falciparum undergoes tightly regulated developmental process in
human erythrocytes, recent studies suggest important regulatory role of
post-translational modifications (ptms). compared plasmodium
phosphoproteome, little known ptms parasite. present
study, performed global analysis asexual blood stages plasmodium
falciparum identify arginine-methylated proteins. using two different methyl
arginine-specific antibodies, immunoprecipitated arginine-methylated
proteins stage-specific parasite lysates identified 843 putative
arginine-methylated proteins lc-ms/ms. motif analysis protein sequences
unveiled methylation sites associated previously known
methylation motifs grx/rgx, rxg, gxxr, wxxxr. identified plasmodium
homologues known arginine-methylated proteins trypanosomes, yeast, and
human. hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (hilic) performed the
immunoprecipitates trophozoite stage enrich arginine-methylated
peptides. mass spectrometry analysis immunoprecipitated hilic fractions
identified 55 arginine-methylated peptides 62 methylated arginine sites.
functional classification revealed arginine-methylated proteins are
involved rna metabolism, protein synthesis, intracellular protein trafficking,
proteolysis, protein folding, chromatin organization, hemoglobin metabolic
process, several functions. summarily, findings suggest that
protein methylation arginine residues widespread phenomenon in
plasmodium, ptm may play important regulatory role diverse set of
biological pathways, including host-pathogen interactions.
