background: malaria fifth leading cause death worldwide. pakistan is
considered moderate malaria-endemic country still, 177 million
individuals risk malaria. roughly 60% pakistan's population, live in
malaria-endemic regions. present study based upon survey various
health care centers 10 major cities northern southern punjab find
out malarial infection patterns 2015. diagnosis, seasonal variations, 
age gender-wise distribution plasmodium spp. circulating study area
were also included objectives.
methods: malaria-suspected patients '16075' enrolled malaria
diagnosis using microscopy, 925 malaria positive were
processed molecular analysis using nested pcr. 18s rrna genes of
plasmodium species amplified, sequenced, blast phylogenetic tree was
constructed based sequences using online integrated tool mega7.
results: 364 cases recruited northern punjab highest incidence 
in rawalpindi (25.5%) lowest chakwal (15.9%). southern punjab 561
cases enlisted rajanpur (21.4%) maximum lowest multan rahim yar
khan (18%). slide positivity rate, annual parasite incidence, annual
blood examination rates 5.7 per 1000 population, 0.1, 0.2% respectively.
the p. vivax (66.7%), p. falciparum (23.7%) mixed infection two
species (9.6%) diagnosed. trend (p. vivax > p. falciparum > mixed
infection) species identification %age confirmed molecular analysis. 
however, occurrence malaria higher southern punjab (5.5%) as
compared northern punjab (4.0%). overall malaria percentage occurrence
of treatment-seeking patients recruited cities punjab 4.9%. the
age-group 1-20 males among genders affected malaria. the
comparison different seasons showed malaria infection peak
in summer post-monsoon.
conclusion: incidence malaria high flood infected rural areas
of southern punjab, summer, post-monsoon. age group (1-20) and
gender-wise males affected malaria.
