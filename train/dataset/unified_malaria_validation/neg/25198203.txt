atp-binding cassette (abc) transporters serve variety physiological
functions well play key roles drug resistance. genome human
malaria parasite, plasmodium falciparum, encodes multiple members family,
one which, gabcg2, transcribed predominantly gametocyte stage. 
we use gene deletion tagging investigate expression, localization 
function gabcg2. protein found single dot-like lipid-rich
structure within female, male, gametocytes. gabcg2-knockout cell lines
produce gametocytes sexes. contrast, cholesteryl esters,
diacylglycerols triacylglycerols significantly reduced gabcg2-knockout
gametocyte stages. propose role gabcg2 regulation gametocyte
numbers accumulation neutral lipids, likely important for
parasite development insect stages parasite life cycle.
