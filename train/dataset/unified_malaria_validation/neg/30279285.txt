invasion host cells apicomplexan parasites toxoplasma gondii is
critical infectivity pathogenesis. toxoplasma, secretion of
essential egress, motility, invasion-related proteins microneme
organelles regulated oscillations intracellular ca2+ later stages of
invasion considered ca2+ independent, including secretion proteins
required host cell entry remodeling parasite's rhoptries. we
identified family three toxoplasma proteins homology ferlin
family double c2 domain-containing ca2+ sensors. humans model
organisms, ca2+ sensors orchestrate ca2+-dependent exocytic membrane fusion 
with plasma membrane. focus one ferlin conserved across
the apicomplexa, t. gondii fer2 (tgfer2). unexpectedly, conditionally
tgfer2-depleted parasites secreted micronemes normally completely 
motile. however, parasites unable invade host cells were
therefore viable. knockdown tgfer2 prevented rhoptry secretion, 
parasites failed form moving junction parasite-host interface

requirement tgfer2 rhoptry secretion toxoplasma tachyzoites suggest
a possible ca2+ dependence rhoptry secretion. findings provide first
mechanistic insights critical yet poorly understood aspect of
