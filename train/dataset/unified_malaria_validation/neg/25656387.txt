killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (kir) expressed mainly natural
killer cells specifically recognize human leukocyte antigen (hla) class i
molecules. repertoire kir genes kir-hla pairs known play key
role susceptibilities outcomes several diseases, including
malaria. aim study investigate distribution kir genes, 
kir genotypes kir-hla pair combinations population naturally exposed 
malaria brazilian amazon. 16 kir genes investigated present 
studied population. overall, 46 kir genotypes defined. two common
genotypes porto velho communities, genotypes 1 2, present at
similar frequencies americas. principal component analysis based the
frequencies kir genes placed porto velho population closer the
venezuela mestizos, usa california hispanic brazil paraná mixed terms of
kir gene frequencies. analysis highlights multi-ethnic profile the
porto velho population. individuals found least one
inhibitory kir-hla pair. seventy-five kir-hla pair combinations identified. 
the kir-2dl2/3_hla-c1, kir3dl1_hla-bw4 kir2dl1_hla-c2 pairs most
common. association kir genes, kir genotypes kir-hla pair
combinations malaria susceptibility studied population. the
first report distribution kir known hla ligands porto velho 
population. taken together, results provide baseline information
that relevant population evolutionary history, malaria other
diseases studies populations brazilian amazon.
