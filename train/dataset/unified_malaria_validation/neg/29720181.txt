background: parasite genetic diversity multiplicity infection (moi) affect
clinical outcomes, response drug treatment naturally-acquired or
vaccine-induced immunity. traditional methods often underestimate frequency
and diversity multiclonal infections due technical sensitivity and
specificity. next-generation sequencing techniques provide novel opportunity to
study complexity parasite populations molecular epidemiology.
methods: symptomatic asymptomatic plasmodium vivax samples collected
from health centres/hospitals schools, respectively, 2011 2015 in
ethiopia. similarly, symptomatic asymptomatic plasmodium falciparum
samples collected, respectively, hospitals schools 2005 2015
in kenya. finger-pricked blood samples collected dried filter paper. 
long amplicon (> 400 bp) deep sequencing merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1)
gene conducted determine multiplicity molecular epidemiology p.
vivax p. falciparum infections. results compared based on
short amplicon (117 bp) deep sequencing.
results: total 139 p. vivax 222 p. falciparum samples were
pyro-sequenced pvmsp1 pfmsp1, yielding total 21 p. vivax 99 p.
falciparum predominant haplotypes. average moi p. vivax p. falciparum
were 2.16 2.68, respectively, significantly higher of
microsatellite markers short amplicon (117 bp) deep sequencing. multiclonal
infections detected 62.2% samples p. vivax 74.8% the
samples p. falciparum. four five subjects recurrent p. vivax 
malaria found relapse 44-65 days clearance parasites. no
difference observed moi among p. vivax patients different symptoms,
ages genders. similar patterns also observed p. falciparum except for
one study site kenyan lowland areas significantly higher moi.
conclusions: study used novel method evaluate plasmodium moi and
molecular epidemiological patterns long amplicon ultra-deep sequencing. the
complexity infections similar among age groups, symptoms, genders,
transmission settings (spatial heterogeneity), well years (pre- vs.
post-scale-up interventions). study demonstrated long amplicon deep
sequencing useful tool investigate multiplicity molecular
epidemiology plasmodium parasite infections.
