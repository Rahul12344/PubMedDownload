that primaquine drugs trigger acute haemolytic anaemia subjects 
who inherited mutation glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd)
gene known half century: however, events still occur,
because giving drug either g6pd status person known, 
the risk potentially life-threatening complication under-estimated.
here review briefly genetic basis g6pd deficiency, the
pathophysiology clinical features drug-induced haemolysis; also
update list potentially haemolytic drugs (which includes rasburicase). 
is clear good practice give one drugs before
testing person his/her g6pd status, especially populations g6pd 
deficiency common. discuss therefore g6pd testing done
reconciling safety cost; becoming public health
importance, countries moving along pathway malaria
elimination, might require mass administration primaquine. finally, we
sketch triangular relationship malaria, antimalarials as
primaquine, g6pd deficiency: extent protective against
malaria, also genetically determined hazard taking primaquine.
