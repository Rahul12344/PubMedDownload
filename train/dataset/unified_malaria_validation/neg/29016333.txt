plasmodium vivax prevalent parasite worldwide, escalating spread
of drug resistance. currently, qatar, chloroquine (cq) plus primaquine are
recommended treatment p. vivax malaria. present study examined the
prevalence mutations dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr), dihydropteroate
synthase (dhps) genes cq resistance transporter (crt-o) genes, associated
with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) chloroquine resistance, among imported
p. vivax cases qatar. blood samples collected patients positive 
p. vivax seeking medical treatment hamad general hospital, doha, during
2013-2016. sanger sequencing method performed examine single
nucleotide polymorphisms pvdhfr, pvdhps, pvcrt-o genes. 314 examined p.
vivax isolates, 247 (78.7%), 294 (93.6%) 261 (83.1%) successfully
amplified sequenced pvdhfr, pvdhps, pvcrt-o, respectively. overall,
53.8% (n = 133) carried mutant alleles (58r/117n) pvdhfr, whereas 77.2% (n =
227) 90% (n = 235) isolates possessed wild type allele pvdhps pvcrt-o 
genes, respectively. addition, total eleven distinct haplotypes were
detected pvdhfr/pvdhps genes. interestingly, k10 insertion pvcrt-o gene
was observed patients originating indian subcontinent. the
results suggested cq remains acceptable treatment regimen further
clinical data required assess effectiveness cq sp qatar to
support current national treatment guidelines. addition, limited
distribution genetic polymorphisms associated cq sp resistance
observed imported p. vivax infections, necessitates regular monitoring drug
resistant p. vivax malaria qatar.
