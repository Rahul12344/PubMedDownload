plasmodium rhoptry neck protein 2 (ron2), released neck portion
of merozoite rhoptries interacts microneme protein apical
membrane antigen 1 (ama1), plays crucial role erythrocyte invasion. 
study, sequenced plasmodium vivax ron2 gene 19 p. vivax isolates
collected central china order establish whether protein under
positive diversifying selection, may occur result protective host
immune pressureâ€ . comparison p. vivax sal-1 reference line, found 
10 amino acid substitutions dispersed throughout open reading frame well
as indels caused polymorphism repeat unit (21-23 repeats of
(q/e/k/n/h)(g/d)g(h/l/y/p)g) second tandem repeat region located amino 
acid positions 541-650. mcdonald-kreitman test ron2 sequences the
primate malaria parasite plasmodium knowlesi, detected significant departure from
neutrality pvron2 3' region (nucleotide positions 2668-6609). these
results suggest pvron2 gene evolved positive diversifying
selection.
