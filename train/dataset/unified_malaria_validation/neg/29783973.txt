background: paucity knowledge concerning erythrocytes the
aetiology multiple sclerosis (ms) despite potential contribute to
disease impaired antioxidant capacity altered haemorheological
features. several studies identified abundance erythrocyte mirnas 
variable profiles associated disease states, sickle cell disease and
malaria. aim study compare erythrocyte mirna profile of
relapsing-remitting ms (rrms) patients healthy sex- age-matched controls.
methods: erythrocytes purified density-gradient centrifugation rna
was extracted. following library preparation, samples run hiseq4000
illumina instrument (paired-end 100 bp sequencing). sequenced erythrocyte mirna
profiles (9 patients 9 controls) analysed deseq2. differentially
expressed mirnas validated rt-qpcr using mir-152-3p endogenous
control replicated larger cohort (20 patients 18 controls). after
logarithmic transformation, differential expression determined two-tailed 
unpaired t-tests. logistic regression analysis carried receiver
operating characteristic (roc) curves generated determine biomarker
potential.
results: total 236 erythrocyte mirnas identified. twelve
differentially expressed mirnas rrms two showed increased expression (adj.
p < 0.05). modest fold-changes evident across differentially expressed 
mirnas. rt-qpcr confirmed differential expression mir-30b-5p (0.61 fold,
p < 0.05) mir-3200-3p (0.36 fold, p < 0.01) rrms compared healthy
controls. relative expression mir-3200-5p (0.66 fold, ns p = 0.096) also
approached significance. mir-3200-5p positively correlated cognition
measured audio-recorded cognitive screen (r = 0.60; p < 0.01). mir-3200-3p
showed greatest biomarker potential single mirna (accuracy = 75.5%,
p < 0.01, sensitivity = 72.7%, specificity = 84.0%). combining mir-3200-3p,
mir-3200-5p, mir-30b-5p composite biomarker increased accuracy to
83.0% (p < 0.05), sensitivity 77.3%, specificity 88.0%.
conclusions: first study report differences erythrocyte mirnas 
in rrms. role mirnas erythrocytes remains elucidated,
differential expression erythrocyte mirnas may exploited biomarkers 
their potential contribution ms pathology cognition further
investigated.
