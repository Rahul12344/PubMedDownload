background: serine hydroxymethyltransferase (shmt), pyridoxal
phosphate-dependent enzyme, plays vital role de novo pyrimidine
biosynthesis pathway malaria parasites. two genes identified in
plasmodium spp. encoding cytosolic shmt (cshmt) putative mitochondria shmt 
(mshmt), roles fully investigated.
methods: presence plasmodium shmt isoforms intra-erythrocytic stage
was assessed based gene expression using reverse transcription pcr
(rt-pcr). localization studies plasmodium shmt isoforms performed by
transfection fluorescent-tagged gene constructs p. falciparum and
expressions fluorescent fusion proteins parasites observed using a
laser scanning confocal microscope. genetic targeting homologous
recombination used study essentiality shmt plasmodium spp.
results: semi-quantitative rt-pcr revealed expression two genes
throughout intra-erythrocytic development. localization studies using p.
falciparum expressing fluorescent-tagged shmt showed pfcshmt-red fluorescent
fusion protein (pfcshmt-dsred) localized cytoplasm, pfmshmt-green
fluorescent fusion protein (pfmshmt-gfp) co-localized mitotrackerâ„¢-labelled 
mitochondria predicted. essentiality plasmodial cshmt inferred from
transfection experiments recovery viable knock-out parasites not
achieved, unless complemented functional equivalent copy shmt.
conclusions: distinct compartment localizations pfshmt observed between
cytoplasmic mitochondrial isoforms, evidence provided the
indispensable role plasmodial cshmt indicating valid target for
development novel anti-malarials.
