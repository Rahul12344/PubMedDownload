background: 2001, world health organization (who) recommended use 
of artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) first-line treatment of
uncomplicated malaria cases, monotherapies become ineffective many
parts world. result, democratic republic congo (drc) withdrew 
chloroquine (cq) malaria treatment policy 2002 artesunate
(as)-amodiaquine (aq) combination became act choice drc 2005.
aq-resistance (aqr) reported several parts world mutations
in codons 72-76 plasmodium falciparum chloroquine-resistance transporter
(pfcrt) gene strongly correlated resistance, especially mutations 
encoding svmnt haplotype. haplotype first identified southeast
asia south america recently reported two african countries
neighbouring drc. facts raised two questions: first evolution
of cq resistance (cqr) drc second presence svmnt
haplotype, would compromise use aq partner drug act.
methods: total 213 thick blood films randomly collected 2010 
paediatric clinic kinshasa, drc. microscopy controls real-time polymerase 
chain reaction (rt-pcr) performed plasmodium species identification.
haplotypes pfcrt gene determined sequencing.
results: k76t mutation detected 145 198 p. falciparum-positive 
samples (73.2%). 145 resistant strains, cviet haplotype was
detected.
conclusions: study first assess molecular markers of
resistance cq aq introduction act drc. results suggest
first cqr decreasing, wild-type pfcrt haplotypes found only
26.8% samples secondly svmnt haplotype yet present 
kinshasa, suggesting aq remains valid partner drug act this
region.
