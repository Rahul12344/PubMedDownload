the malaria vaccine rts,s/as01, based immunogenic regions plasmodium
falciparum circumsporozoite protein (csp), partial efficacy clinical 
malaria african children. understanding sequence diversity csp t- and
b-cell epitopes relates naturally acquired vaccine-induced immunity may be
useful efforts improve efficacy csp-based vaccines. however,
limitations sequencing technology precluded thorough evaluation of
diversity immunogenic regions protein. study, 454, next 
generation sequencing technology, evaluated method assessing
diversity regions. portions circumsporozoite gene (cs) were
sequenced 454 sanger sequencing samples collected study 
bandiagara, mali. 454 detected single nucleotide polymorphisms and
haplotypes t-cell epitopes sanger sequencing, better able 
to resolve genetic diversity samples multiple infections; however, it
failed generate sequence b-cell epitopes.
