for effective control malaria, development sensitive, accurate and
rapid tool diagnose manage disease essential. humans subjects,
the severe form malaria caused plasmodium falciparum (pf) plasmodium
vivax (pv) need identify parasites acute, chronic and
latent (during post-infection) stages disease. study, we
report species specific sensitive diagnostic method detection pf
and pv humans. first, identified intra intergenic multiloci short
stretch 152 (pfmls152) 110 (pvmls110) nucleotides present to
44 34 times genomes pf pv respectively. developed the
single-step amplification-based method using isolated dna lysed red blood
cells detection two malaria parasites. limit detection of
real-time polymerase chain reaction based assays 0.1copyof parasite/μl for
pfmls152 pvmls110 target sequences. next, tested 250 clinically
suspected cases malaria validate method. sensitivity specificity
for targets 100% compared quantitative buffy coat microscopy
analysis real-time pcr (pf-chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) and
pv-lactate dehydrogenase (pvldh)) based assays. sensitivity microscopy and
real-time pcr (pfcrt pvldh primers) assays 80.63%; 95%ci 75.22%-85.31%; 
p<0.05 97.61%; 95%ci 94.50%-99.21%; p<0.05 detecting malaria infection
respectively compared pfmls152 pvmls110 targets identify malaria
infection patients. improved assays may potential applications in
evaluating malaria asymptomatic patients, treatment, blood donors in
vaccine studies.
