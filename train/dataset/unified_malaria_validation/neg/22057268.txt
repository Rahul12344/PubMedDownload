the 23-megabase genome plasmodium falciparum, causative agent severe
human malaria, contains ∼5300 genes, unknown function lacking homologs
in organisms. identification gene functions help the
discovery novel targets development antimalarial drugs and
vaccines. p. falciparum genome unusually a+t-rich, hampers cloning
and expressing genes heterologous systems functional analysis. the
large repertoire genetic tools available saccharomyces cerevisiae makes
this yeast ideal system large scale functional complementation analyses of
parasite genes. here, report construction cdna library p.
knowlesi, lower a+t content compared p. falciparum. library
was applied yeast complementation assay identify malaria genes involved
in decarboxylation phosphatidylserine. transformation psd1δpsd2δdpl1δ
yeast strain, defective phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis, p.
knowlesi library led identification new parasite phosphatidylserine
decarboxylase (pkpsd). unlike phosphatidylserine decarboxylase enzymes other
eukaryotes tightly associated membranes, pkpsd enzyme expressed
in yeast equally distributed membrane soluble fractions. vitro
studies reveal truncated forms pkpsd soluble undergo
auto-endoproteolytic maturation phosphatidylserine-dependent reaction that
is inhibited anionic phospholipids. study defines new system 
probing function plasmodium genes library-based genetic complementation
and usefulness revealing new biochemical properties encoded proteins.
