the transcriptome cell finely regulated large number molecular
mechanisms able control balance mrna production degradation.
recent experimental findings evidenced fine specific regulation 
degradation needed proper orchestration global cell response to
environmental conditions. developed computational technique based on
stochastic modeling, infer condition-specific individual mrna half-lives
directly gene expression time-courses. predictions method were
validated experimentally measured mrna decay rates the
intraerythrocytic developmental cycle plasmodium falciparum. applied
our methodology publicly available data reproductive metabolic
cycle budding yeast. strikingly, analysis revealed, cases, the
presence periodic changes decay rates sequentially induced genes and
co-ordination strategies transcription degradation, thus suggesting a
general principle proper coordination transcription degradation
