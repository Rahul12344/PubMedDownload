malaria one devastating parasitic diseases worldwide. plasmodium
drug resistance remains major challenge malaria control led the
re-emergence disease. chloroquine (cq) artemisinin (art) thought
to exert anti-malarial activity inducing cytotoxicity parasite by
blocking heme degradation (for cq) increasing oxidative stress. besides the
contribution cq resistance transporter (pfcrt) multidrug resistant
gene (pfmdr), cq resistance also associated increased parasite
glutathione (gsh) levels. art resistance recently shown associated with
mutations k13-propeller protein. analyze role gsh levels cq
and art resistance, generated transgenic plasmodium berghei parasites either
deficient overexpressing gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase gene
(pbggcs) encoding rate-limiting enzyme gsh biosynthesis. lines
produce either lower (pbggcs-ko) higher (pbggcs-oe) levels gsh wild
type parasites. addition, gsh levels determined p. berghei parasites
resistant cq mefloquine (mq). increased gsh levels detected both, 
cq mq resistant parasites, compared parental sensitive clone.
sensitivity cq art remained unaltered pgggcs-ko pbggcs-oe
parasites tested 4 days drug suppressive assay. however, recrudescence 
assays parasites exposed sub-lethal dose art showed
that parasites low levels gsh sensitive art treatment. 
results suggest gsh levels influence plasmodium berghei response art
treatment.
