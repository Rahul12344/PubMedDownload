artemisinin, sesquiterpene lactone produced artemisia annua glandular
secretory trichomes, active ingredient effective treatment for
malaria currently available. identified mutation disrupts the
amorpha-4,11-diene c-12 oxidase (cyp71av1) enzyme, responsible series of
oxidation reactions artemisinin biosynthetic pathway. detailed metabolic
studies cyp71av1-1 revealed consequence blocking artemisinin
biosynthetic pathway redirection sesquiterpene metabolism a
sesquiterpene epoxide, designate arteannuin x. sesquiterpene
approaches half concentration observed artemisinin wild-type plants,
demonstrating high-flux plasticity a. annua glandular trichomes their
potential factories production novel alternate sesquiterpenes at
commercially viable levels. detailed metabolite profiling leaf maturation
time-series precursor-feeding experiments revealed nonenzymatic
conversion steps central artemisinin arteannuin x biosynthesis.
in particular, feeding studies using 13c-labeled dihydroartemisinic acid (dhaa)
provided strong evidence final steps synthesis artemisinin are
nonenzymatic vivo. findings also suggest specialized subapical
cavity glandular secretory trichomes functions location the
chemical conversion storage phytotoxic compounds, including
artemisinin. conclude metabolic engineering produce high yields of
novel secondary compounds sesquiterpenes feasible complex glandular
trichomes. systems offer advantages single-cell microbial hosts for
production toxic natural products.
