background: prior study findings suggest plasmodium falciparum the
cause disease malaria retinopathy-positive (rp) most
retinopathy-negative (rn) cerebral malaria (cm), absence retinopathy 
and decreased disease severity rn cm may due shorter duration of
illness, lower parasite biomass, decreased var gene expression rn compared
to rp cm. present study, assessed pathophysiology rp rn cm.
methods: compared markers systemic central nervous system inflammation,
oxidative stress, neuronal injury, systemic endothelial activation, angiogenesis,
and platelet activation ugandan children rp (n = 167) rn (n = 87) cm.
results: rp children higher plasma c-reactive protein (p = .013), ferritin
and erythropoietin (both p < .001) levels, elevated cerebrospinal fluid
(csf):plasma albumin ratio (p < .001), higher csf tau protein levels (p =
.049) rn children. levels plasma csf proinflammatory and
anti-inflammatory cytokines oxidative stress markers differ between
rp rn children. rn children higher plasma levels endothelin 1 (p =
.003), platelet-derived growth factor (p = .012), platelet factor 4 (p =
.034).
conclusions: rp rn cm may represent different phases cm. rn cm may be
driven early vasospasm platelet activation, whereas advanced rp
cm associated greater inflammation, increased erythropoietic drive,
blood-brain barrier breakdown, neuronal injury, may contribute 
to greater disease severity.
