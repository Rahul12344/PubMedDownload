background: assessing plasmodium vivax burden india complicated 
potential threat emerging chloroquine (cq) resistant parasite population
from neighbouring countries southeast asia. chennai, capital tamil nadu
and urban setting p. vivax southern india, selected sentinel
site investigating cq efficacy sensitivity vivax malaria.
methods: cq efficacy evaluated 28-day vivo therapeutic study, while
cq sensitivity measured vitro drug susceptibility assay. both
studies, isolates also underwent molecular genotyping investigate correlations
between parasite diversity drug susceptibility cq. molecular genotyping
included sequencing 604 base pair (bp) fragment p. vivax multidrug
resistant gene-1 (pvmdr1) single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) also the
amplification eight microsatellite (ms) loci located across genome on
eight different chromosomes.
results: 28-day vivo study (n=125), subjects aparasitaemic 
day 14. passive case surveillance continuing beyond day 28 22 subjects exposed
17 recurrent infections, ranged 44 148 days post-enrollment. pvmdr1
sequencing recurrent infections revealed 93.3% identical mutant
haplotypes (958m/y976/1076l) baseline day 0 infection. ms genotyping
further revealed nine infection pairs related â‰¥ 75% haplotype
similarity (same allele six loci). test impact mutation
on cq efficacy, vitro drug assay (n=68) performed. correlation
between ic50 values percentage ring-stage parasites prior culture
was observed (r(sadj): -0.00063, p = 0.3307) distribution alleles
among pvmdr1 snps ms haplotypes showed significant associations with
ic50 values.
conclusions: plasmodium vivax found susceptible cq drug treatment in
both vivo therapeutic drug study vitro drug assay. though the
mutant 1076 l pvmdr1 found majority isolates tested, single
mutation associate cq resistance. ms haplotypes revealed strong
heterogeneity population, indicating low probability reinfection
with highly related haplotypes.
