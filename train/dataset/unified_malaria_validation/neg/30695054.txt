association mapping factors condition pyrethroid resistance aedes
aegypti consistently identified genes multiple functional groups. toward
better understanding mechanisms involved, examined high throughput
sequencing data (hts) two aedes aegypti aegypti collections merida,
yucatan, mexico treated either permethrin deltamethrin. exome capture
enrichment coding regions aaegl5 annotation used identify
genes statistically associated resistance. frequencies single
nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) compared resistant susceptible
mosquito pools using contingency χ2 analysis. -log10(χ2 p value) was
calculated snp site, weighted average determined sites in
each gene. genes -log10(χ2 p value) ≥ 4.0 present among 3 treatment 
groups subjected gene set enrichment analysis (gsea). found that
several functional groups enriched compared coding genes. these
categories transport, signal transduction metabolism, order from
highest lowest statistical significance. strikingly, 21 genes with
demonstrated association synaptic function identified. high
association group (n = 1,053 genes), several genes identified also
genetically physically interact voltage-gated sodium channel (vgsc). 
these genes eg., charlatan (chl), transcriptional regulator, several
ankyrin-domain proteins, pumilio (pum), translational repressor, nedd4 (e3 
ubiquitin-protein ligase). 13 genes ranked among top 10%:
these included vgsc; cingulin, predicted neuronal gap junction protein, the
aedine ortholog nervy (nvy), transcriptional regulator. silencing chl and
nvy followed standard permethrin bottle bioassays validated association 
with permethrin resistance. importantly, vgsc levels also reduced 50% 
in chl- nvy-dsrna treated mosquitoes. results consistent the
contribution variety neuronal pathways pyrethroid resistance ae.
