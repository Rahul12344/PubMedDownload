background: chloroquine (cq), cost effective antimalarial drug a
relatively good safety profile therapeutic index, longer used itself
to treat patients with plasmodium falciparum due cq-resistant strains. p.
vivax, representing 90% malaria cases brazil, despite reported
resistance, treated cq well primaquine block malaria
transmission avoid late p. vivax malaria relapses. resistance cq other
antimalarial drugs influences malaria control, thus monitoring resistance
phenotype parasite genotyping helpful endemic areas.
methods: total 47 p. vivax nine p. falciparum fresh isolates were
genetically characterized tested cq, mefloquine (mq) artesunate (art)
susceptibility in vitro. genes mdr1 pfcrt, likely related cq
resistance, analyzed isolates. drug susceptibility determined
using short-term parasite cultures ring stages 48 72 hour thick
blood smears counts. parasite isolate tested antimalarials to
measure geometric mean 50% inhibitory concentration.
results: low numbers  p. falciparum isolates reflect species
prevalence brazil; displayed low sensitivity cq (ic50 70 nm). however,
cq resistance rare among p. vivax isolates (ic50 32 nm). majority of
p. vivax p. falciparum isolates sensitive art mq. one hundred
percent p. falciparum isolates carried non-synonymous mutations pfmdr1 
gene codons 184, 1042 1246, 84% codons 1034 none codon 86, a
well-known resistance mutation. the pfcrt gene, mutations observed in
codons 72 76 p. falciparum isolates. one p. falciparum isolate from
angola, africa, showing sensitivity antimalarials, presented mutations.
in p. vivax, mutations pvmdr1 multidrug resistance gene 1 marker at
codon f976 absent.
conclusion: p. falciparum brazilian isolates showed cq resistance and
presented non-synonymous mutations pfmdr1 pfcrt. cq resistant genotypes
were present among p. vivax isolates ic50 values low all
samples brazilian west amazon.
