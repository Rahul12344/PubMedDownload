background: malaria highly prevalent many parts india mostly
caused parasite species plasmodium vivax followed plasmodium
falciparum. chloroquine (cq) first-line treatment blood stage p. vivax
parasites, cases drug resistance cq reported india. one 
of surveillance strategies used monitor cq drug resistance, is
the analysis single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) associated gene
markers. susceptibility cq also determined copy number assessment of
multidrug resistant gene (mdr-1). current study examined prevalence
of snps p. vivax orthologs p. falciparum chloroquine resistant and
multi-drug resistant genes (pvcrt-o pvmdr-1, respectively) pvmdr-1 copy
number variations isolates highly endemic mangaluru city near the
south western coastal region india.
methods: total 140 blood samples collected p. vivax infected
patients attending wenlock hospital mangaluru july 2014 january 2016.
out 140 samples, sequencing carried 54 (38.5%) 85
(60.7%) isolates pvcrt-o pvmdr-1, respectively. single nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps) pvcrt-o pvmdr-1 genes analysed direct
sequencing method, copy number variations 60 isolates (42. 8%) were
determined real time pcr.
results: 54 clinical isolates analysed pvcrt-o, three (5.6%) showed
k10 insertion rest wild type sequence. first report to
show k10 insertion p. vivax isolates india. further, 85 clinical
isolates p. vivax analysed mutations pvmdr-1 gene, one isolate had
wild type sequence (~Â 1%) remaining (99%) carried mutant alleles. seven
non-synonymous mutations two novel mutations (i946v y1028c) were
observed. observed mutations pvmdr-1 gene, t958m highly
prevalent (present 90% samples) followed f1076l (76%), y976f (7%).
amplification pvmdr-1 gene observed 31.6% isolates, 60
amplified.
conclusion: observed variations pvmdr-1 pvcrt-o genes indicate 
trend towards parasite acquiring cq resistance endemic area.
