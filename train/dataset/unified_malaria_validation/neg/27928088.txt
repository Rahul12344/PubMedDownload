babesiosis emerging tick-borne disease caused apicomplexan parasites 
the genus babesia human infections united states caused by
babesia microti, infection-causing babesia parasites been
documented well. polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based methods used 
identify parasite species level. study, published real-time
pcr assays specific detection b. microti evaluated against
conventional pcr analytical performance. evaluated real-time pcr
assays comparable dynamic range amplification efficiency, the
sensitivity specificity varied. best performing test, taqman assay
targeting 18s ribosomal rna gene, evaluated diagnostic
performance using blood specimens submitted centers disease control
and prevention parasite detection found 100% sensitivity 
specificity. conclusion, 18s taqman real-time pcr assay sensitive,
specific, rapid method identification b. microti among cases of
babesiosis united states.
