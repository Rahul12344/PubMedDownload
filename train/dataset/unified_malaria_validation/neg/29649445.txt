underlying development malaria parasites within erythrocytes the
resulting pathogenicity hardwired program secures proper timing gene
transcription production functionally relevant proteins. how
stage-specific gene expression orchestrated in vivo remains unclear. here,
using assay transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (atac-seq), we
identified ∼4,000 regulatory regions p. falciparum intraerythrocytic stages.
the vast majority sites located within 2 kb upstream transcribed 
genes chromatin accessibility pattern correlates positively
with abundance respective mrna transcript. importantly, regions 
sufficient drive stage-specific reporter gene expression dna motifs
enriched stage-specific sets regulatory regions interact members of
the p. falciparum ap2 transcription factor family. collectively, study
provides initial insights in vivo gene regulatory network of
p. falciparum intraerythrocytic stages serve valuable resource
for future studies.
