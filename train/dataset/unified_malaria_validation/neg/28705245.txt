background: abscisic acid (aba) naturally present mammalian blood and
circulating levels increased oral supplementation. showed previously
that oral aba supplementation mouse model plasmodium yoelii 17xnl
infection reduced parasitemia gametocytemia, spleen liver pathology, 
parasite transmission mosquito anopheles stephensi fed mice.
treatment cultured plasmodium falciparum aba levels detected our
model effects asexual growth gametocyte formation vitro. however,
aba treatment cultured p. falciparum immediately prior mosquito feeding
significantly reduced oocyst development a. stephensi via aba-dependent
synthesis nitric oxide (no) mosquito midgut.
results: describe mechanisms effects aba mosquito
physiology, dependent phosphorylation tgf-β-activated kinase 1
(tak1) associated changes homeostatic gene expression activity of
kinases central metabolic regulation midgut epithelium.
collectively, timing effects suggests transient physiological
shift enhances nf-κb-dependent innate immunity without significantly
altering mosquito lifespan fecundity.
conclusions: aba highly conserved regulator immune metabolic
homeostasis within malaria vector a. stephensi potential a
transmission-blocking supplemental treatment.
