cerebral plasmodium falciparum malaria characterized adhesion infected
erythrocytes (ies) cerebral microvasculature. linked to
parasites expressing structurally related group subset p. falciparum
erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1) family ie adhesion ligands ies 
with affinity icam-1. however, recent evidence cast doubt these
associations, tempering hopes feasibility developing vaccine based on
icam-1-binding pfemp1. study, report identification domain
cassette (dc) present group var genes six genetically distinct p.
falciparum parasites. three domains cassette, call dc4, a
high level sequence identity cluster together phylogenetically.
erythrocytes infected parasites selected vitro expression 
dc4 adhered specifically icam-1. icam-1-binding capacity dc4 mapped
to c-terminal third duffy-binding-like Î²3 domain. dc4 target
of broadly cross-reactive adhesion-inhibitory igg abs, levels of
dc4-specific adhesion-inhibitory igg increased age among p.
falciparum-exposed children. study challenges earlier conclusions group 
a pfemp1 proteins central icam-1-specific ie adhesion support
