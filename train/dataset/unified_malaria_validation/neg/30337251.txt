background: plasmodium falciparum plasmodium vivax two major parasites
responsible malaria remains threat almost 50% world's
population despite decade-long eradication program. one possible reason behind
this conundrum bases clinical variability malaria caused by
either species complex poorly understood.
methods: whole-genome transcriptome analyzed identify active and
predominant pathways pbmc p. falciparum p. vivax infected malaria
patients. deregulated genes identified annotated using r bioconductor
and david/kegg respectively. genetic functional regulation cd14, a
prioritized candidate, established quantitative rt-pcr, genotyping using 
rflp resequencing, mapping transcription factor binding using consite 
tfbind, dual luciferase assay, western blot analysis, rnai- mediated gene
knockdown chromatin-immunoprecipation.
findings: study highlighted deregulation host immune inflammatory
genes particularly cd14 key event p. falciparum malaria. abundance 
allele-c rs5744454, located cd14 promoter, severe malaria motivated us
to establish allele-specific regulation cd14 sp1. enhancement sp1 
and cd14 expression observed artemisinin treated human monocyte cell line.
interpretation: data reinstates cd14 tlr pathway plays a
predominant role p. falciparum malaria, establishes functional basis 
genetic association rs5744454 p. falciparum severe malaria by
demonstrating cis-regulatory role promoter polymorphism. moreover, 
study points towards novel pharmacogenetic aspect artemisinin-based
anti-malarial therapy. fund: dst-serb, govt. india, sr/so/hs-0056/2013.
