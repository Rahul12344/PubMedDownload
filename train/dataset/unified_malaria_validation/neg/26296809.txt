a mutation second transmembrane domain gaba receptor subunit, rdl, 
is associated resistance insecticides dieldrin fipronil.
molecular cloning rdl cdna strain malaria mosquito, anopheles
gambiae, highly resistant dieldrin revealed mutation (a296g) 
well another mutation third transmembrane domain (t345m). wild-type,
a296g, t345m a296g + t345m homomultimeric rdl expressed xenopus
laevis oocytes sensitivities fipronil, deltamethrin,
1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane (ddt), imidacloprid spinosad
were measured using two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology. spinosad and
ddt agonist antagonist actions rdl. however, fipronil, deltamethrin 
and imidacloprid decreased gaba-evoked currents. antagonistic actions 
either reduced abolished a296g a296g + t345m mutations 
t345m alone appeared significant effect. conclusion, study
identifies another mutation mosquito rdl associated with
insecticide resistance. t345m affect insecticide
sensitivity, may serve offset structural impact a296g. present
study also highlights rdl potential secondary target neonicotinoids 
pyrethroids. show first time deltamethrin (a pyrethroid
insecticide) imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid insecticide) act directly the
insect gaba receptor, rdl. findings highlight rdl potential secondary
target pyrethroids neonicotinoids mutations may contribute to
resistance widely used insecticides.
