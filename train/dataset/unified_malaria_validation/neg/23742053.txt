background: biomphalaria glabrata mollusc intermediate host for
schistosoma mansoni, digenean flatworm parasite causes human intestinal
schistosomiasis. estimated 200 million people 74 countries suffer from
schistosomiasis, terms morbidity severe tropical disease
after malaria. epigenetic information informs status gene activity that
is heritable, changes reversible based dna
sequence. epigenetic mechanisms generate variability provides source for
potentially heritable phenotypic variation therefore could involved the
adaptation environmental constraint. phenotypic variations particularly
important host-parasite interactions selective pressure rate
of evolution high. context, epigenetic changes expected be
major drivers phenotypic plasticity co-adaptation host and
parasite. consequently, characterization genomes invertebrates
that parasite vectors intermediate hosts, also essential to
understand epigenetic machinery functions better decipher the
interplay host parasite.
methods: cpgo/e ratios used proxy investigate occurrence 
cpg methylation b. glabrata coding regions. presence dna methylation in
b. glabrata also confirmed several experimental approaches: restriction
enzymatic digestion isoschizomers, bisulfite conversion based techniques and
lc-ms/ms analysis.
results: work, report dna methylation, one the
carriers epigenetic information, occurs b. glabrata; approximately 2% of
cytosine nucleotides methylated. describe methylation machinery b. 
glabrata. methylation occurs predominantly cpg sites, present high ratios
in coding regions genes associated housekeeping functions. also
demonstrate bisulfite treatment methylation occurs multiple copies 
nimbus, transposable element.
conclusions: study details dna methylation first time, one the
carriers epigenetic information b. glabrata. general characteristics of
dna methylation observed b. glabrata genome conform what
epigenetic studies reported invertebrate species.
