malaria relevant parasitic disease worldwide, severe malaria is
characterized cerebral edema, acute lung injury (ali), multiple organ
dysfunctions; however, mechanisms lung damage need better clarified.
in study, used kunming outbred mice infected plasmodium berghei anka
(pbanka) elucidate profiles cell immunoglobulin mucin domain-3
(tim-3) ligand galecin-9 (gal-9) development ali. mice were
injected intraperitoneally 10(6) pbanka-infected red blood cells. lungs 
and mediastinal lymph nodes (mlns) harvested days 5, 10, 15, 20 post 
infections (p.i.). grade lung injury histopathologically evaluated.
tim-3- gal-9-positive cells lungs mlns stained by
immunohistochemistry, messenger rna (mrna) expressions tim-3, gal-9,
and related cytokines assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction (qrt-pcr). bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf) analyses performed
from days 18 20 p.i. results showed pathological severities in
the lungs increased times total protein level balfs 
significantly elevated pbanka-infected mice. numbers gal-9(+) and
tim-3(+) cells lungs significantly increased, mrna levels 
both gal-9 tim-3 lungs mlns over-expressed pbanka-infected
mice. conclusion, data suggested tim-3/gal-9 may play role in
pbanka-induced ali.
