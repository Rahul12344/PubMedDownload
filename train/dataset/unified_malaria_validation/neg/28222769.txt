background: host selection important determinant vectorial capacity
because malaria transmission increases mosquitoes feed humans than
non-humans. host selection also affects outcome long-lasting insecticidal 
nets (llin). despite recent nationwide implementation llin-based malaria
control program papua new guinea (png), little known host
selection local anopheles vectors. study investigated host
selection anopheles vectors png.
methods: blood-engorged mosquitoes sampled using barrier screen method
and blood meals analyzed vertebrate host source pcr-amplification the
mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. abundance common hosts estimated in
surveys. test homogeneity proportions manly resource selection 
ratio used determine hosts selected proportion their
abundance.
results: two thousand four hundred forty blood fed anopheles females seven
species sampled five villages madang, png. 2,142 samples tested, 
2,061 (96.2%) yielded definitive host source; human, pig, dog.
hosts selected proportion abundance, rather were
under-selected over-selected mosquitoes. four species, anopheles
farauti (sensu stricto) (s.s.), anopheles punctulatus (s.s.), anopheles farauti
no. 4 anopheles longirostris, over-selected humans villages low llin 
usage, over-selected pigs villages high llin usage. anopheles
koliensis consistently over-selected humans despite high llin usage, and
anopheles bancroftii over-selected pigs.
conclusions: plasticity host selection anopheles species depends 
its opportunistic, anthropophilic zoophilic behavior, extent of
host availability llin usage mosquitoes forage hosts. high 
anthropophily an. koliensis increases likelihood contacting llin
inside houses. allows population size reduced levels
insufficient support transmission. contrast, feeding alternative
hosts likelihood opportunistic species contact llin lower,
making difficult control. maintaining high population size, the
proportion feed humans outdoors sustain residual transmission despite
high llin usage village.
