the crispr/cas9 nuclease system powerful method genetically modify the
human malarial parasite, plasmodium falciparum. currently, method carried
out co-transfection two plasmids, one containing cas9 nuclease gene, 
and another encoding sgrna donor template dna. however, the
efficiency modification currently low owing low frequency these
plasmids parasites. improve crispr/cas9 nuclease system p.
falciparum, developed novel method using transgenic parasite, pfcas9,
which stably expresses cas9 nuclease using centromere plasmid. examine
the efficiency genetic modification using pfcas9 parasite, performed
site-directed mutagenesis kelch13 gene, considered involved 
artemisinin resistance. results demonstrated targeted mutation could
be introduced almost 100% efficiency transfected pfcas9 parasites
were treated two drugs maintain centromere plasmid containing
the cas9 nuclease plasmid sgrna. therefore, pfcas9
parasite useful parasite line genetic modification p. falciparum.
