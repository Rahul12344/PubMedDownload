microbes co-infect host. recently maternally inherited endosymbiotic
bacteria wolbachia shown protect insects range microbial
and eukaryotic pathogens. mosquitoes experimentally infected wolbachia 
upregulated immune responses protected number pathogens
including viruses, bacteria, plasmodium filarial nematodes. been
hypothesised immune upregulation underpins wolbachia-mediated protection.
drosophila strong model understanding host-wolbachia-pathogen
interactions. wolbachia-mediated antiviral protection drosophila been
demonstrated number different wolbachia strains. study we
investigate whether wolbachia-infected flies also protected against
pathogenic bacteria. drosophila simulans lines infected five different
wolbachia strains challenged pathogenic bacteria pseudomonas
aeruginosa pa01, serratia marcescens erwinia carotovora mortality
compared paired lines without wolbachia. difference mortality was
observed flies without wolbachia. similarly antibacterial
protection observed d. melanogaster infected wolbachia.
interestingly, d. melanogaster oregon rc flies naturally infected 
wolbachia showed upregulation antibacterial immune genes tepiv,
defensin, diptericin b, pgrp-sd, cecropin a1 attacin compared paired
flies without wolbachia. taken together results indicate that
wolbachia-mediated antibacterial protection ubiquitous insects and
furthermore mechanisms antibacterial antiviral protection are
independent. suggest immune priming antibacterial protection
observed wolbachia-infected mosquitoes may consequence recent
artificial introduction symbiont insects normally carry
wolbachia antibacterial protection unlikely found insects
carrying long-term wolbachia infections.
