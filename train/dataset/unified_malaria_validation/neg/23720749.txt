acquired antimalarial drug resistance produces treatment failures led 
periods global disease resurgence. plasmodium falciparum, resistance is
known arise genome-level changes mutations gene

responsible plasmodial surface anion channel, nutrient channel that
also transports ions antimalarial compounds host erythrocyte membrane.
two blasticidin s-resistant lines exhibited markedly reduced expression clag
genes linked channel activity, genome-level changes. silencing
aborted production channel protein directly responsible for
reduced uptake. silencing affected clag paralogs two chromosomes was
mediated specific histone modifications, allowing rapidly reversible drug
