molecular diagnosis malaria nucleotide amplification requires sophisticated
and expensive instruments, typically found well-established laboratories.
loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) provided new platform 
easily adaptable molecular technique molecular diagnosis malaria without
the use expensive instruments. new primer set designed targeting
the 18s rrna gene detection plasmodium falciparum whole blood
samples. efficacy lamp using new primer set assessed study
in comparison previously described set lamp primers well as
with microscopy real-time pcr reference methods detecting p.
falciparum. pre-addition hydroxy napthol blue (hnb) lamp reaction
caused distinct color change, thereby improving visual detection system.
the new lamp assay found 99.1% sensitive compared microscopy and
98.1% compared real-time pcr. meanwhile, specificity 99% 100%
in contrast microscopy real-time pcr, respectively. moreover, lamp
method good agreement microscopy real-time pcr (0.94 and
0.98, respectively). new lamp method detect least 5parasites/μl of
infected blood within 35min, lamp method tested study,
could detect minimum 100parasites/μl human blood 60min of
amplification. thus, new method sensitive specific, carried out
in short time, substitute pcr healthcare clinics standard
laboratories.
