background: artemisiae annuae herba (aah) traditionally used drug
for treatment malaria, heat stroke, bacterial infection, fever in
east-asia. although aah used treatment inflammation-related
symptoms, underlying mechanism antiinflammatory activity aah still
unknown.
objective: investigated whether aah inhibitory effect the
production pro-inflammatory mediators lipopolysaccharide-stimulated raw
264.7 macrophage cells.
materials methods: investigation forced inhibitory effect of
aah production tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-α, interleukin (il)-6,
nitric oxide (no), inducible synthase (inos) macrophages. furthermore, 
we examined effect aah activation nuclear factor kappa b (nf-κb)
and mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapks) pathways.
results: found aah suppresses production tnf-α, il-6, inos
gene expression. moreover, aah inhibited nuclear translocation p65 and
iκbα degradation nf-κb pathway decreased extracellular
signal-regulated kinase, p38, c-jun nh2-terminal kinase phosphorylation mapk
signaling pathway.
conclusions: consequently, results indicate aah contains
antiinflammatory activity effect derived repression the
activation nf-κb mapks pathways. first demonstrated that
antiinflammatory effect aah underlying mechanism macrophage cells.
