phylogenetic relationships among malaria vectors closely related species in
thailand using multilocus dna sequences.

phunngam p, chareonviriyaphap t, bangs mj, arunyawat u.

the evolutionary taxonomic status important understanding speciation
events phylogenetic relationships closely related vector and
nonvector species. information useful targeting important disease
vector species groups development novel genetic-based vector and
pathogen control methods. study, different phylogenetic analyses were
performed reconstruct phylogenetic trees primary malaria vectors in
thailand based sequence information 4 dna fragments nuclear and
mitochondrial regions. primary anopheles species subgenus cellia
involved malaria transmission thailand separate clearly 3 distinct
clades: leucosphyrus group, minimus subgroup, maculatus group. the
phylogenetic trees based different reconstructed algorithms different gene
regions provided congruent phylogenetic status mosquito species studied.
the phylogenetic relationships malaria vector species examined followed
similar patterns based morphological characters. estimate divergence
time among anopheles species infers present eocene 
and miocene periods (>41 million years ago). congruent phylogenetic analysis of
malaria vectors presented different algorithms gene regions. the
nuclear toll6 fragment appears useful molecular phylogenetic, species dna
barcode, anopheles population genetic analyses.
