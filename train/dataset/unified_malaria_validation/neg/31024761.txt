background: hypusination essential post-translational modification in
eukaryotes. two enzymes required modification, namely deoxyhypusine 
synthase (dhs) deoxyhypusine hydrolase also conserved. plasmodium
falciparum human malaria parasites possess genes hypusination enzymes,
which hypothesized targets antimalarial drugs.
methods: transgenic p. falciparum parasites modification the
pf3d7_1412600 gene encoding pfdhs enzyme created insertion glms
riboswitch m9 inactive variant. pfdhs protein studied in
transgenic parasites confocal microscopy western immunoblotting. the
biochemical function pfdhs enzyme parasites assessed hypusination
and nascent protein synthesis assays. gene essentiality assessed by
competitive growth assays chemogenomic profiling.
results: clonal transgenic parasites integration glms riboswitch
downstream pfdhs gene established. pfdhs protein present the
cytoplasm transgenic parasites asexual stages. pfdhs protein could be
attenuated fivefold transgenic parasites active riboswitch, whereas
pfdhs protein expression unaffected control transgenic parasites with
insertion riboswitch-inactive sequence. attenuation pfdhs expression
for 72 h led significant reduction hypusinated protein; however, global
protein synthesis unaffected. parasites attenuated pfdhs expression
showed significant growth defect, although decline rapid as
parasites attenuated dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase
(pfdhfr-ts) expression. pfdhs-attenuated parasites showed increased sensitivity
to n 1-guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane, structural analog spermidine, known 
inhibitor dhs enzymes.
discussion: loss pfdhs function leads reduced hypusination, may be
important synthesis essential proteins. growth defect in
parasites attenuated pf dhs expression suggests gene essential.
however, slower decline pfdhs mutants compared pfdhfr-ts mutants in
competitive growth assays suggests pfdhs less vulnerable an
antimalarial target. nevertheless, data validate pfdhs antimalarial
target inhibited spermidine-like compounds.
