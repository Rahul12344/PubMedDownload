introduction: piroplasms hemoprotozoa comprising heterogeneous tick-borne
parasites, differentiated three genera, namely babesia, theileria,
and cytauxzoon. aim study determine prevalence, molecular 
identification, phylogenetic relationship theileria spp. babesia 
spp. tick species isolated different domestic animals two different 
geographical locations iran.
materials methods: total 930 ticks collected goats, sheep, and
cattle examined presence theileria spp. babesia spp. using
pcr targeting 18s rrna gene followed sequencing. sequence analysis was
performed based data published genbank theileria spp. and
babesia spp. isolates using bioinformatic tools, standard nucleotide 
blast.
results: 390 430 base pair fragment 18s rrna gene theileria and
babesia species successfully amplified 17.2% examined ticks (16of
93). genome theileria babesia species detected 4 ticks collected 
heris, including 3 dermacentor marginatus 1 rhipicephalus sanguineus, and
also 12 ticks collected chabahar, including 10 r. sanguineus 2 d.
marginatus. partial analysis 18s rrna gene sequence four d. marginatus,
collected goats sheep heris, showed infected with
theileria spp. 95-97% identical iranian theileria ovis present in
the genbank database (genbank acc. no. kp019206.1). five r. sanguineus,
collected sheep goats chabahar, infected babesia spp. 
were 91-97% identical iranian babesia ovis present genbank database
(genbank acc. no. ay362829.1: kt587794.1).
conclusion: prevalence babesia theileria different southeastern 
and northwestern parts iran, higher prevalence babesiosis the
southeastern region theileriosis northwestern region. sequence
analysis 18s rrna gene revealed t. ovis b. ovis genetically
polymorphic regions.
