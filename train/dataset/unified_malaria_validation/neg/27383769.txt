translation control plays important role regulation gene expression 
in malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum, especially transition stages
between vertebrate host mosquito vector. here, determined function
of puf-family member puf1 (denoted pfpuf1 p. falciparum protein)
during p. falciparum sexual development. show pfpuf1 expressed all
gametocyte stages higher levels female gametocytes. pfpuf1 disruption
did interfere asexual erythrocyte cycle parasite resulted
in approximately tenfold decrease mature gametocytes. the
pfpuf1-disrupted lines, gametocytes appeared normal stage iii but
subsequently exhibited sharp decline gametocytemia. accompanied 
a concomitant accumulation dead dying late-stage gametocytes, which
retained normal gross morphology. addition, significantly female
gametocytes lost pfpuf1-disrupted lines development, resulting
in reversed male-to-female sex ratio. results indicate pfpuf1 is
important differentiation maintenance gametocytes, especially
female gametocytes.
