malaria remains major global health issue, affecting millions killing
hundreds thousands people annually. efforts break transmission cycle
of causal plasmodium parasite, cure afflicted, rely
upon functional characterization genes essential parasite's growth 
development. studies often based upon manipulations parasite
genome disrupt modify gene interest understand importance and
function. however, approaches limited availability of
selectable markers time required generate transgenic parasites.
moreover, also risk disrupting native gene regulatory elements with
the introduction exogenous sequences. address limitations, have
developed crispr-rgr, streptococcus pyogenes (sp)cas9-based gene editing system
for plasmodium utilizes ribozyme-guide-ribozyme (rgr) single guide rna
(sgrna) expression strategy rna polymerase ii promoters. using
rodent-infectious plasmodium yoelii, demonstrate gene disruptions
and coding sequence insertions efficiently generated, producing marker-free
parasites homology arms short 80-100 bp. additionally, find that
the common practice using one sgrna produce unintended plasmid
integration desired locus replacement editing events, whereas use two 
sgrnas results locus replacement editing. lastly, show crispr-rgr
can used crispr interference (crispri) binding catalytically dead
spcas9 (dspcas9) region upstream gene interest, resulting a
position-dependent, strand-independent reduction gene expression. this
robust flexible system facilitates efficient genetic characterizations of
rodent-infectious plasmodium species.
