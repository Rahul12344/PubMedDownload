apicomplexan parasites responsible numerous important human diseases
including toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidiosis, importantly malaria. there
is constant need new antimalarials, one keenly pursued drug
targets ancient algal endosymbiont, apicoplast. apicoplast is
essential parasite survival, several aspects metabolism and
maintenance validated targets anti-parasitic drug treatment. most
apicoplast proteins nuclear encoded imported the
organelle. recently, protein translocon typically required endoplasmic
reticulum associated protein degradation (erad) proposed act in
apicoplast protein import. here, show ubiquitylation conserved and
essential component process. identify apicoplast localized ubiquitin
activating, conjugating ligating enzymes toxoplasma gondii plasmodium 
falciparum observe biochemical activity vitro reconstitution. using
conditional gene ablation complementation analysis link activity to
apicoplast protein import parasite survival. studies suggest
ubiquitylation mechanistic requirement apicoplast protein import
independent proteasomal degradation pathway.
