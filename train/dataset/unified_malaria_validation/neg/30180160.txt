background: clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
(crispr)/cas9 technology rapidly emerged effective tool gene
editing. although great advances gene editing medical entomology field 
have arisen, attempts gene editing reported sand flies, the
vectors leishmaniasis.
methodology/principal findings: here, described detailed protocol sand
fly embryo microinjection taking consideration sand fly life cycle, 
manipulation oviposition requirements non-model organism. following
our microinjection protocol, hatching rate injected embryos 11.90%-14.22%
was achieved, rate consistent non-model organism dipterans as
mosquitoes. essential factors adaptation crispr/cas9 technology the
sand fly field addressed including selection target gene the
design production sgrna. vitro cleavage assay optimized test 
the activity sgrna protocol streptococcus pyogenes cas9
(spcas9) protein expression purification described. relevant
considerations successful gene editing sand fly specifics of
embryology double-stranded break dna repair mechanisms discussed.
conclusion significance: step-by-step methodology reported this
article significant use setting sand fly embryo
microinjection station incorporation crispr/cas9 technology the
sand fly field. gene editing strategies used mosquitoes model
insects adapted work sand flies, providing tools and
relevant information adapting gene editing techniques vectors of
leishmaniasis. gene editing sand flies provide essential information on
the biology vectors medical veterinary relevance rise 
better understanding vector-parasite-host interactions.
