the extensive redundancy use invasion ligands plasmodium falciparum,
and unique ability switch invasion pathways hampered vaccine 
development. p. falciparum strains dd2 w2mef shown change from
sialic acid (sa)-dependent sa-independent phenotypes selected on
neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes. following observation increasing
ability dd2 invade neuraminidase-treated cells cultured several
weeks, systematically investigated phenomenon comparing invasion
phenotypes dd2, w2mef 3d7 strains p. falciparum cultured with
gentle shaking (suspended) static (static) conditions. static dd2 
and w2mef remained sa-dependent entire duration investigation,
suspended parasites spontaneously progressively switched sa-independent
phenotype week 2 onwards. furthermore, returning suspended cultures to
static conditions led gradual reversal sa-dependent phenotype. switch
to sa-independent phenotype accompanied upregulation key invasion
ligand, reticulocyte-binding homologue 4 (rh4), increased invasion was
inhibited antibodies rh4 receptor, cr1. data demonstrates novel
mechanism inducing switching invasion pathways p. falciparum
parasites may provide clues understanding mechanisms involved.
