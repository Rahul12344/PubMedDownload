background: genetic variation essential means evolution adaptation
in many organisms response environmental change. certain dna alterations
can carried site-specific recombinases (ssrs) fall two
families: serine tyrosine recombinases. ssrs seldom found in
eukaryotes. gene homologous tyrosine site-specific recombinase been
identified genome plasmodium falciparum. sequence highly
conserved among five members plasmodia.
methodology/principal findings: predicted open reading frame encodes a
∼57 kda protein containing c-terminal domain including putative tyrosine
recombinase conserved active site residues r-h-r-(h/w)-y. n-terminus 
typical alpha-helical bundle potentially mixed alpha-beta domain resembling
that λ-int. pf-int mrna expressed differentially p. falciparum
erythrocytic life stages, peaking schizont stage. recombinant pf-int and
affinity chromatography dna genomic synthetic origin used to
identify potential dna targets sequencing micro-array hybridization.
interestingly, sequences captured also included highly variable subtelomeric 
genes var, rif, stevor sequences. electrophoretic mobility shift
assays dna carried verify pf-int/dna binding. finally, pf-int
knock-out parasites created order investigate biological role of
pf-int.
conclusions/significance: data identify first time malaria parasite
gene structural functional features recombinases. pf-int may bind 
and alter dna, either sequence specific non-specific fashion, and
may contribute programmed random dna rearrangements. pf-int first
molecular player identified potential role genome plasticity this
pathogen. finally, pf-int knock-out parasite viable showing detectable
impact blood stage development, compatible function.
