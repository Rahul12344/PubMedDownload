coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused novel sars-cov-2 virus
is severe flu-like illness associated hyperinflammation and
immune dysfunction. virus induces strong b cell response little
is known immune pathology viral infection. acute plasmodium
falciparum malaria also causes acute clinical illness characterized by
hyperinflammation due strong production pro-inflammatory cytokines 
a massive activation cells. malaria, cells express variety of
co-inhibitory receptors might consequence activation also
might limit overwhelming function. thus, cells implicated in
protection well pathology. outcome malaria thought a
consequence balance co-activation co-inhibition cells.
following hypothesis cells covid-19 might similar, dual
function, comprehensively characterized differentiation (ccr7, cd45ro) and
activation status (hla-dr, cd38, cd69, cd226), co-expression co-inhibitory
molecules (pd1, tim-3, lag-3, btla, tigit), well expression pattern 
the transcription factors t-bet eomes cd8+ cd4+ cells pbmc n =
20 sars-cov-2 patients compared n = 10 p. falciparum infected patients n =
13 healthy controls. overall, acute covid-19 malaria infection resulted 
comparably elevated activation altered differentiation status cd8+ and
cd4+ cell populations. effector cells covid-19 malaria patients showed
higher frequencies inhibitory receptors t-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3
(tim-3) lymphocyte-activation gene-3 (lag-3) linked increased
activation levels upregulation transcription factors t-bet and
eomes. covid-19 patients severe disease course showed higher levels
of lag-3 tim-3 patients mild disease course. recovery, a
rapid normalization inhibitory receptors could observed. summary, 
comparing expression different co-inhibitory molecules cd8+ cd4+ 
cells covid-19 vs. malaria, transient increase expression of
certain inhibitory receptors like lag-3 tim-3 covid-19 overall
context acute immune activation.
