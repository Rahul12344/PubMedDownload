haemosporidians, group vector-borne parasites include plasmodium,
infect vertebrates including birds. although mosquitoes crucial elements in
the transmission avian malaria parasites, little known ecology 
vectors. examined presence plasmodium haemoproteus lineages five
mosquito species belonging genera culex ochlerotatus test the
effect vector species, season host-feeding source transmission
dynamics pathogens. analyzed 166 blood-fed individually 5,579
unfed mosquitoes (grouped 197 pools) locality southern spain. in
all, 15 plasmodium two haemoproteus lineages identified basis 
a fragment 478 bp mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. infection prevalence
of blood parasites unfed mosquitoes varied species (range: 0-3.2%) and
seasons. feeding source identified 91 mosquitoes 78% were
identified bird. found i) several plasmodium lineages shared among
different culex species one plasmodium lineage shared culex and
ochlerotatus genera; ii) mosquitoes harboured haemoproteus parasites; iii) pools 
of unfed females mostly ornithophilic culex species higher plasmodium
prevalence mammophylic culex species studied. however, the
mammophylic ochlerotatus caspius pool samples greatest plasmodium
prevalence. relative high prevalence may determined inter-specific
differences vector survival, susceptibility infection also the
possibility species feeds birds frequently previously
thought. finally, iv) infection rate mosquitoes varies seasons and
reaches maximum prevalence autumn minimum prevalence spring.
