fkbp protein, referred destabilization domain (dd) tag fused a
native protein n- c-terminus targets protein proteosomal
degradation. regulated expression achieved via addition compound, shld-1,
that stabilizes protein prevents degradation. limited number studies

quantified regulation reporter green fluorescent protein (gfp) luciferase 
constructs fused three dd variants parasite cells either via transient or
stable transfection. regulation obtained original fkbp derived dd
domain compared two triple mutants dd24 dd29, described
to provide better regulation c-terminal tagging cell types. when
cloned c-terminal reporter proteins, dd24 provided strongest
regulation allowing reporter activity reduced lower levels dd and
to restore activity stabilised proteins higher levels dd29.

targeting ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (resa) c-terminus.
the tagged protein demonstrated important modulation expression.
