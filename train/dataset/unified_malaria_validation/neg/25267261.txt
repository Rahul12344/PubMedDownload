background: host genotype accounts component variability in
susceptibility childhood plasmodium falciparum malaria. however, despite
numerous examples host polymorphisms associated tolerance resistance
to infection, direct evidence impact host genetic polymorphisms 
in vivo parasite population difficult obtain. parasite molecules whose
expression likely associated adaptation that
are directly involved host-parasite interaction. prime candidate 
family parasite var gene-encoded molecules p. falciparum-infected
erythrocytes, pfemp1, binds various host molecules facilitates parasite
sequestration host tissues avoid clearance spleen.
methods: assess impact host genotype infecting parasite
population used published parasite var gene sequence dataset compare var 
gene expression patterns parasites children polymorphisms in
molecules thought interact modulate display pfemp1 infected 
erythrocyte surface: abo blood group, haemoglobin s, alpha-thalassaemia, the
t188g polymorphism cd36 k29m polymorphism icam1.
results: expression levels 'group a-like' var genes, encode specific
group pfemp1 variants previously associated low host immunity severe 
malaria, showed signs elevation among children blood group ab. other
host factor tested showed evidence association var expression.
conclusions: preliminary findings suggest host abo blood group may 
a measurable impact infecting parasite population. needs be
verified larger studies.
