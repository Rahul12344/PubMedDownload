introduction: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency most
common enzymopathy human population affecting estimated 8% world
population, especially living areas past present malaria
endemicity. decreased g6pd enzymatic activity associated drug-induced
hemolysis increased risk severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia leading to
brain damage. g6pd gene x chromosome therefore mutations cause
enzymatic deficiency hemizygote males homozygote females the
majority heterozygous females intermediate activity (between 30-80% of
normal) large distribution range deficiency normality.
current g6pd qualitative tests unable diagnose g6pd intermediate
activities could hinder wide use 8-aminoquinolines plasmodium vivax 
elimination. aim study assess diagnostic performances of
the new carestart g6pd quantitative biosensor.
methods: total 150 samples venous blood g6pd deficient, intermediate
and normal phenotypes collected among healthy volunteers living along the
north-western thailand-myanmar border. samples analyzed complete blood
count, gold standard spectrophotometric assay using trinity kits the
latest model carestart g6pd biosensor analyzes g6pd hemoglobin.
results: bland-altman comparison carestart normalized g6pd values 
of gold standard assay showed strong bias values resulting poor area 
under-the-curve values 30% 80% thresholds. performing receiver
operator curve identified threshold values carestart product equivalent
to 30% 80% gold standard values good sensitivity specificity
values, 100% 92% (for 30% g6pd activity) 92% 94% (for 80% activity)
respectively.
conclusion: carestart g6pd biosensor represents significant improvement for
quantitative diagnosis g6pd deficiency previous versions. further
improvements validation studies required assess utility for
informing radical cure decisions malaria endemic settings.
