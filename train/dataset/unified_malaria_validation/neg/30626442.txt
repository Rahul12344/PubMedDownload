background: continuous vector pathogen surveillance essential preventing
outbreaks mosquito-borne diseases. several mosquito species acting vectors 
of japanese encephalitis virus (jev), dengue virus, zika virus, malaria parasites
and pathogens primary mosquito species shanghai, china. however, few
surveys human pathogenic arboviruses mosquitoes shanghai been
reported last ten years. therefore, study, evaluated mosquito
activity shanghai, china 2016 tested presence of
alphaviruses, flaviviruses, orthobunyaviruses several parasitic pathogens.
results: five pooled samples jev-positive [4/255 pools culex
tritaeniorhynchus 1/256 pools cx. pipiens (s.l.)] based analysis the
ns5 gene. alphaviruses, orthobunyaviruses, plasmodium filariasis not
found study. phylogenetic molecular analyses revealed jev
strains belonged genotype i. moreover, newly detected shanghai jev strains
were genetically close previously isolated shandong strains responsible for
transmission 2013 japanese encephalitis (je) outbreak shandong
province, china distantly related shanghai strains
detected early 2000s. e proteins newly detected shanghai jev
strains differed live attenuated vaccine sa14-14-2-derived
strain six amino residues: e130 (ile→val), e222 (ala→ser), e327 (ser→thr),
e366 (arg→ser/pro), e393 (asn→ser) e433 (val→ile). however, differences
were observed key amino acid sites related antigenicity. minimum jev
infection rates 1.01 0.65 per 1000 cx. tritaeniorhynchus cx. pipiens
(s.l.), respectively.
conclusions: five new shanghai jev genotype strains, detected ten-year 
hiatus local mosquito surveillance, genetically close strains involved
in 2013 shandong je outbreak. jev still circulating, vaccination
in children extensively continuously promoted. moreover, jev
mosquito surveillance programmes document genotype variation,
intensity distribution circulating viruses use development 
implementation disease prevention control strategies.
