the plasmodium falciparum var gene family encodes âˆ¼60 surface antigens which
parasites escape host immune responses via clonal expression var genes.
however, mechanism controlling mutual exclusivity, associated with
alterations chromatin assembly, understood. here, determined how
expression var gene family regulated two recq dna helicase family
members, pfrecq1 pfwrn, p. falciparum genetic manipulation, we
found complete var repertoire silenced pfrecq1 knockout, whereas 
their expression show noticeable changes pfwrn knocked out. more
important, mutually exclusive expression var genes could rescued by
complementation pfrecq1. addition, knocking either two
helicase genes changed perinuclear cluster distribution subtelomeres and
subtelomeric var genes. whereas deletion pfrecq1 increased heterochromatin
mark trimethylated (h3k9me3) transcription start site (tss) var
gene upsc1, deletion effect global distribution h3k9me3
over gene bodies, including var genes. chip-seq assay showed that
pfrecq1 enriched globally tsss genes, whereas pfwrn-enriched
regions occurred gene bodies var gene family, other
genes tsss genes. pfrecq1 deletion, upsc1 var gene moved from
the active perinuclear transcription region silenced region upsc
type. findings imply pfrecq1, pfwrn, essential for
maintaining clonal expression var genes.
