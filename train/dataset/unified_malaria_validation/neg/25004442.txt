the genetic polymorphisms candidate markers antimalarial drug
resistance pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfatp6, pfmrp1 investigated relationship
with vitro susceptibility plasmodium falciparum isolates clinical
response following artesunate (as)-mefloquine (mq) combination 21 27
samples obtained patients recrudescence adequate clinical response,
respectively. mq (21.0 vs. 49.9nm) (1.6 vs. 2.8nm) ic50 values
(concentrations inhibit parasite growth 50%) significantly higher in
isolates collected patients recrudescence. furthermore, significantly
higher mq ic50 found isolates patients recrudescence that
carried pfmrp1 mutations amino acid residues 191y, 437a, 876v. as
sensitivity, significant association also detected isolates from
patients recrudescence carried gene mutations amino acid residues
437a 876v. mq ic50 isolates recrudescence carried ≥4 pfmdr1
gene copies significantly higher carrying one gene copy. in
addition, significantly higher proportion isolates carrying one gene copy
was detected group adequate clinical response compared with
recrudescence. results limited sample size suggested potential link
between pfmdr1 gene copy number pfmrp1 gene mutation, vitro parasite
susceptibility, as-mq treatment response.
