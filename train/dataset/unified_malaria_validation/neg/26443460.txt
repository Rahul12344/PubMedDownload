members clonally variant plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane
protein 1 (pfemp1) family mediate adhesion infected erythrocytes (ies) to
vascular receptors. pfemp1 expression normally confined nanoscale knob
protrusions ie surface membrane. investigate relationship between
the densities ie surface knobs pfemp1 variant expressed, used
specific antibody panning generate three sublines p. falciparum clone
it4, expresses pfemp1 variants it4var04, it4var32b, it4var60. the
knob density subline determined atomic force microscopy (afm)
and scanning electron microscopy (sem) compared pfemp1 knob-associated
histidine-rich protein (kahrp) expression. selection uniform expression of
it4var04 produced little change knob density, compared unselected ies. in
contrast, selection it4var32b expression increased knob density approximately
3-fold, whereas ies selected it4var60 expression essentially knobless.
when it4var60(+) ies subsequently selected express it4var04 it4var32b,
they displayed low high knob densities, respectively. sublines
expressed kahrp regardless pfemp1 expressed. study documents the
first time knob density related pfemp1 variant expressed. may
reflect topological requirements ensure optimal adhesive properties the
ies.importance: infections plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites still
responsible many deaths, especially among children pregnant women. new
interventions needed reduce severe illness deaths caused this
malaria parasite. thus, better understanding mechanisms behind the
pathogenesis essential. main reason plasmodium falciparum malaria is
more severe disease caused malaria species ability to
express variant antigens infected erythrocyte surface. antigens 
presented membrane protrusions known knobs. study set to
investigate interplay different variant antigens surface of
p. falciparum-infected erythrocytes density knobs the
antigens expressed. direct analysis relationship 
reported adds important understanding complexity of
malaria antigen presentation.
