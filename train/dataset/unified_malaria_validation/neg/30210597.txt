the current study analyzed gene expression profiles endolymphatic sac (es)
in rats identified expressed genes, present human rat es, to
reveal key hubs inflammatory responses. microarray data (accession no.
e-mexp-3022) obtained european bioinformatics institute database,
including three biological replicates es plus dura tissues three
replicates pure dura tissues form rats. differentially expressed genes (degs) 
were screened using linear model microarray data method a
protein-protein interaction (ppi) network constructed using data the
search tool retrieval interacting genes/proteins database followed 
a module analysis via clustering overlapping neighborhood expansion.
function enrichment analysis performed using database annotation,
visualization integrated discovery online tool. total 612 degs were
identified, including 396 upregulated 216 downregulated genes. gene ontology 
term enrichment analysis indicated degs associated cell adhesion,
including Î±5-integrin (itga1) secreted phosphoprotein 1 (spp1); cell
co-stimulation, including c-c chemokine ligand (ccl)21 ccl19; the
toll-like receptor signaling pathway, including toll-like receptor (tlr)2, tlr7
and tlr8. conclusions supported kyoto encyclopedia genes and
genomes pathway analyses revealing extracellular matrix-receptor interaction,
including itga1 spp1; leukocyte transendothelial migration,
includingclaudin-4 (cldn4); malaria, including tlr2. hub roles itga1, 
cd24 spp1 revealed calculating three topological properties the
ppi network. ccl21, ccl19 cldn4 demonstrated crucial following
significant module analysis according corresponding threshold, which
revealed enriched inflammation pathways. tlr7, tlr2, granzyme 
tlr8 common genes associated inflammatory responses rat human
es. conclusion, abnormal expression aforementioned
inflammation-associated genes may associated development of
autoimmune inner ear diseases.
