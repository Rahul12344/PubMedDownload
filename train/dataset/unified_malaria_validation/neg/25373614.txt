background: course intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (idc),
the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum tightly orchestrates rise fall
of transcript levels hundreds genes. considerable debate focused on
the relative importance transcriptional versus post-transcriptional processes 
in regulation transcript levels. enzymatically active forms rnapii in
other organisms associated phosphorylation serines at
positions 2 5 heptad repeats within c-terminal domain (ctd) of
rnapii. reasoned insight contribution transcriptional
mechanisms gene expression p. falciparum could obtained comparing the
presence enzymatically active forms rnapii multiple genes the
abundance associated transcripts.
results: exploited phosphorylation state ctd detect
enzymatically active forms rnapii p. falciparum genes across idc. 
we raised highly specific monoclonal antibodies three forms the
parasite ctd, namely unphosphorylated, ser5-p ser2/5-p, used in
chip-on-chip type experiments map genome-wide occupancy rnapii. our
data reveal idc divided early late phases rnapii
occupancy evident simple bi-phasic rnapii binding profiles. comparison to
mrna abundance, identified sub-sets genes high occupancy by
enzymatically active forms rnapii relatively low transcript levels and
vice versa. show presence active repressive histone
modifications correlates rnapii occupancy idc.
conclusions: simple early/late occupancy rnapii cannot account the
complex dynamics mrna accumulation idc, suggesting major role for
mechanisms acting downstream rnapii occupancy control gene
expression parasite.
