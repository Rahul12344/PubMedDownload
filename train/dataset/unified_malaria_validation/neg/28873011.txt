malaria remains grand challenge disruptive innovation global health
therapeutics diagnostics. anopheles stephensi one major vectors 
malaria asia. vector transmission control key focus areas fight
against malaria, field postgenomics research proteomics play a
substantive role. moreover, identify novel strategies control vector
population, necessary understand vector life processes global
and molecular scale. context, fat body vital organ required for
vitellogenesis, vector immunity, vector physiology, vector-parasite
interaction. given central role energy metabolism, vitellogenesis, and
immune function, proteome profile fat body impact blood
meal (bm) ingestion protein abundances vital organ been
investigated far. therefore, using proteomics approach, identified the
proteins expressed fat body an. stephensi differential
expression response bm ingestion. all, identified 3,218 proteins in
the fat body using high-resolution mass spectrometry, 483 found 
be differentially expressed response bm ingestion. bioinformatics
analysis proteins underscored role amino acid metabolism,
vitellogenesis, lipid transport, signal peptide processing, mosquito immunity,
and oxidation-reduction processes. interestingly, identified five novel genes,
which found differentially expressed upon bm ingestion. proteins 
exhibited altered expression present study potential targets for
vector control strategies development transmission blocking vaccines in
the fight malaria.
