background: next-generation sequencing (ngs) offers great opportunities for
studying biology insect vectors disease. prerequisites successful
analyses include high quality annotated genome assemblies techniques
designed use model organisms tested optimised use 
insects. aimed test improve genomic tools studying major
malaria vector anopheles funestus.
results: guide future rnaseq transcriptomic studies an. funestus, we
compared two methods enrichment non-ribosomal rna analysis: enrichment
of polyadenylated rna ribosomal rna depletion using kit designed deplete
human/rat/mouse rrna. found large differences two methods the
resulting transcriptomes, due differential representation 
polyadenylated non-polyadenylated transcripts. used rnaseq data for
validation targeted manual editing draft an. funestus genome
annotation, validating 62 % annotated introns, manually improving the
annotation seven gene families involved detoxification xenobiotics
and integrated two published transcriptomic datasets recently published 
genome assembly.
conclusions: mrna enrichment method makes substantial, replicable
difference transcriptome composition, least partly due the
representation non-polyadenylated transcripts final transcriptome.
therefore, great care taken comparing gene expression data among
studies. ribosomal rna depletion total rna using kit designed deplete
human/rat/mouse rrna works mosquitoes and, argue, results truer
representation transcriptome poly(a) selection. an. funestus
genome annotation considerably improved help new rnaseq 
data guided manual gene editing efforts great benefit to
the anopheles research community studies insect's genome and
transcriptome.
