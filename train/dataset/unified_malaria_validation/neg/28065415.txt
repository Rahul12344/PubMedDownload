plasmodium ovale widely distributed tropical countries, whereas 
been reported americas. problem globally rarely 
detected microscopy owing low parasite density, feature of
clinical ovale malaria. p.o. curtisi p.o. wallikeri widespread both
africa asia, known sympatric many african countries 
southeast asian countries. small subunit ribosomal rna (ssurrna) gene, cytochrome
b (cytb) gene, merozoite surface protein-1 (msp-1) gene initially
studied molecular discrimination p.o. curtisi p.o. wallikeri using
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) dna sequencing. dna sequences genes 
from p. ovale southeast asia southwestern pacific regions also
targeted differentiate two sympatric types. terms clinical
manifestations, p.o. wallikeri tended produce higher parasitemia levels and
more severe symptoms. date, studies used the
quantitative pcr method discrimination two distinct p. ovale types.
conventional pcr consequent dna sequencing common method used to
differentiate two types. necessary identify two types
because relapse periodicity, drug susceptibility, mosquito species preference
need studied reduce ovale malaria. article, easier method 
molecular-level discrimination p.o. curtisi p.o. wallikeri proposed.
