thermosensation provides vital inputs malaria vector mosquito, anopheles 
gambiae utilizes heat-sensitivity within broad spectrum behaviors,
most notably, localization human hosts blood feeding. study,
we examine thermosensory behaviors larval-stage an. gambiae, result
of obligate aquatic habitats importance vectorial capacity,
represents opportunistic target vector control part global
campaign eliminate malaria. case adults, immature mosquitoes
respond differentially diverse array external heat stimuli. addition, 
larvae exhibit striking phenotypic plasticity thermal-driven behaviors 
are established temperature embryonic development occurs. within this
spectrum, rnai-directed gene-silencing studies provide evidence essential
role transient receptor potential sub-family a1 (trpa1) channel in
mediating larval thermal-induced locomotion thermal preference within a
discrete upper range ambient temperatures.
