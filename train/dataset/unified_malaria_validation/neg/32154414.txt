introduction: plasmodium falciparum relies gametocytogenesis transmit 
humans mosquitoes. gametocyte development 1 (pfgdv1) upstream activator 
and epigenetic controller gametocytogenesis. emergence drug resistance 
is major public health concern requires development new
strategies target transmission malaria. putative drug target,
pfgdv1 characterized identify polymorphisms alleles under
selection polymorphisms influence protein structure.
methods: study characterized single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in
primary sequences (n = 30) pfgdv1 gene generated thirty blood samples
collected patients infected p. falciparum secondary sequences (n = 
216) retrieved plasmodb. chromaspro, muscle, tajima's statistic, slac, and
strum used editing raw sequences, performing multiple sequence alignment 
(msa), identifying signatures selection, detecting codon sites selection
pressure, determining effect snps, respectively.
results: msa primary secondary sequences established existence five
snps, consisting four non-synonymous substitutions (nssnps) (p.p217h, p.r398q,
p.h417n, p.d497e), synonymous substitution (p.s514s). analysis of
amino acid changes reveals p.p217h, p.r398q, p.h417n comprise
non-conservative changes. tajima's statistic showed snps 
balancing selection, slac analysis identified p.p217h the
strongest positive selection. . analysis based thermodynamics
indicated p.p217h destabilizing effect, p.r398q p.d497e have
stabilizing effects protein structure.
conclusions: existence four nssnps implies pfgdv1 minimal
diversity encoded protein. selection analysis demonstrates these
nssnps balancing selection local global populations.
however, p.p217h exhibits positive directional selection consistent previous
reports showed differentiatial selection p. falciparum low and
high transmission regions. therefore, in-silico prediction experimental
determination protein structure necessary evaluate pfgdv1 target
candidate drug design development.
