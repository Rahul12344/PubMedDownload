the phylum apicomplexa includes many parasitic genera medical veterinary
importance including plasmodium (causative agent malaria), toxoplasma
(toxoplasmosis), babesia (babesiosis). apicomplexan parasites
possess unique, essential organelle, apicoplast, plastid without
photosynthetic ability. although apicoplast considered evolved
through secondary endosymbiosis red alga common ancestral cell of
apicomplexans, evolutionary history debate recently. the
apicoplast genome around 30-40 kb length. repertoire arrangement 
the apicoplast genome-encoded genes differ among apicomplexan genera, although
within genus plasmodium almost conserved. genes apicoplast
genome may useful markers plasmodium phylogeny, single
copy (except inverted repeat region) may phylogenetic
signal mitochondrial genome commonly used for
plasmodium phylogeny. review describes recent studies concerning the
evolutionary origin apicoplast, presents evolutionary comparison the
primary structures apicoplast genomes apicomplexan parasites, and
summarizes recent findings malaria phylogeny based apicoplast
genome-encoded genes.
