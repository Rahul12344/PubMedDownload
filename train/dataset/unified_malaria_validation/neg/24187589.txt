genome biology mosquitoes holds potential developing knowledge-based
control strategies vectorborne diseases malaria, dengue, west
nile, others. although genomes three major vector mosquitoes been
sequenced, attempts elucidate relationship intron codon usage 
bias across species phylogenetic contexts limited. study, we
investigated relationship intron content codon bias of
orthologous genes among three vector mosquito species. found antagonistic
relationship codon usage bias intron number genes each
mosquito species. pattern evident among intronless the
intron-containing orthologous genes associated either low high codon bias
among three species. furthermore, covariance codon bias and
intron number directional component associated species phylogeny
when compared nonmosquito insects. applying maximum
likelihood-based continuous regression method, show codon bias intron
content genes vary among insects phylogeny-dependent manner, with
no evidence adaptive radiation species-specific adaptation. discuss 
functional evolutionary significance antagonistic relationships between
intron content codon bias.
