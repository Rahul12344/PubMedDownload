artemisinin (art)-based combination therapy (act) used first-line
treatment uncomplicated falciparum malaria worldwide. however, despite high
potency rapid action, high rate recrudescence associated with
art monotherapy act long recent emergence art resistance.
art-induced ring-stage dormancy recovery implicated possible
causes recrudescence; however, little known characteristics of
dormant parasites, including whether dormant parasites metabolically active. 
we investigated transcription 12 genes encoding key enzymes various
metabolic pathways p. falciparum dihydroartemisinin (dha)-induced
dormancy recovery. transcription analysis showed immediate downregulation 
for 10 genes following exposure dha continued transcription 2 genes
encoding apicoplast mitochondrial proteins. transcription several
additional genes encoding apicoplast mitochondrial proteins, particularly 
genes encoding enzymes pyruvate metabolism fatty acid synthesis pathways, 
was also maintained. additions inhibitors biotin acetyl-coenzyme (coa)
carboxylase enoyl-acyl carrier reductase fatty acid synthesis pathways
delayed recovery dormant parasites 6 4 days, respectively,
following dha treatment. results demonstrate metabolic pathways are
downregulated dha-induced dormant parasites. contrast, fatty acid and
pyruvate metabolic pathways remain active. findings highlight new targets
to interrupt recovery parasites art-induced dormancy reduce the
rate recrudescence following art treatment.
