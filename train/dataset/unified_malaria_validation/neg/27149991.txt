background: plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1)
variants encoded var genes mediate pathogenic cytoadhesion and
antigenic variation malaria. pfemp1s broadly divided three
principal groups (a, b c) contain conserved arrangements of
functional domains called domain cassettes. despite tremendous diversity
there compelling evidence restricted subset pfemp1s expressed 
severe disease. study antibodies patients severe and
uncomplicated malaria compared differences reactivity range of
pfemp1s determine whether antibodies particular pfemp1 domains were
associated severe uncomplicated malaria.
methods: parts expressed var genes severe malaria patient identified
by rnaseq several partial pfemp1 domains expressed together
with others laboratory isolates. antibodies papuan patients these
parts multiple pfemp1 proteins measured.
results: patients uncomplicated malaria likely antibodies 
that recognized pfemp1 group c type recognized broader repertoire of
group b pfemp1s patients severe malaria.
conclusion: data suggest exposure broad range group b
pfemp1s associated protection severe disease papua, indonesia.
