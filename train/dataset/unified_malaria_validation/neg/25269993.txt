background: development malaria vaccine hindered the
allele-specific responses produced parasite antigens' high genetic
diversity. antigen genetic diversity must thus evaluated designing a
completely effective vaccine. plasmodium falciparum p12, p38 p41 proteins
have red blood cell binding regions s48/45 domains located on
merozoite surface, p41 forming heteroduplex p12. three genes have
been identified plasmodium vivax share similar characteristics 
orthologues plasmodium falciparum. plasmodium vivax pv12 pv38 low
genetic diversity pv41 polymorphism described.
methods: present study aimed evaluating p. vivax p41 (pv41) gene's
polymorphism. dna sequences colombian clinical isolates pv41 gene 
analysed characterising studying genetic diversity the
evolutionary forces produced variation pattern observed.
results: similarly members 6-cys family, pv41 low genetic
polymorphism. pv41 3'-end displayed highest nucleotide diversity value;
several substitutions found positive selection. negatively
selected codons inter-species level identified s48/45 domains; p41
would thus seem functional/structural constraints due presence 
these domains.
conclusions: spite functional constraints pv41 s48/45 domains,
immune system pressure seems allowed non-synonymous substitutions to
become fixed within adaptation mechanism; including pv41 s48/45
domains vaccine thus carefully evaluated due domains
containing allele variants.
