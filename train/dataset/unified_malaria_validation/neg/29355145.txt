background & objectives: northeast (ne) india one high endemic regions 
for malaria preponderance plasmodium falciparum, resulting high
morbidity mortality. p. falciparum parasite region showed high
polymorphism drug-resistant molecular biomarkers. however, paucity 
of information related merozoite surface protein 1 (msp-1) glutamate-rich 
protein (glurp) extensively studied various parts the
world. present study was, therefore, aimed investigating genetic
diversity p. falciparum based msp-1 glurp arunachal pradesh, state
in ne india.
methods: two hundred forty nine patients fever screened for
malaria, 75 positive p. falciparum. blood samples collected
from microscopically confirmed patient. dna extracted; nested
polymerase chain reaction sequencing performed study genetic
diversity msp-1 (block 2) glurp.
results: block 2 msp-1 gene found highly polymorphic, and
overall allelic distribution showed ro33 dominant allele (63%),
followed mad20 (29%) k1 (8%) alleles. however, extensive diversity (9
alleles 4 genotypes) 6-10 repeat regions exclusively r2 type were
observed glurp.
interpretation & conclusions: p. falciparum population ne india was
diverse might responsible higher plasticity leading survival 
of parasite turn higher endemicity falciparum malaria of
this region.
