in tanzania, chloroquine replaced sulphadoxine- pyrimethamine (sp) a
first-line treatment uncomplicated malaria. due high resistance in
malaria parasites, sp lasted 5 years end 2006 was
replaced current artemisinin combination therapy. therefore, set a
study determine current genotypic mutations associated plasmodium
falciparum resistance artemisinin, partner drugs chloroquine. parasites
dna extracted dried blood spots collected finger-prick from
tanzanian malaria infected patients. dna sequenced using miseq then
genotypes translated drug resistance haplotypes wellcome sanger
institute, uk. 422 samples successful sequenced k13 gene (marker
for artemisinin resistance), wild type (wt) found 391 samples (92.7%) 
whereby 31 samples (7.3%) mutations k13 gene. 31 samples with
mutations, one sample r561h, mutation associated delayed
parasite clearance southeast asia, another sample a578s, mutation not
associated artemisinin whilst 29 samples k13 novel mutations. were
no mutations pgb, exo, p23_bp pfmdr1 position 86 1246 (markers 
resistance artemisinin partner drugs) 270 samples (60.4%) mutations at
pfmdr1 y184f. additionally, genotyped pfcrt positions 72-76 (major predictors 
for chroquine resistance), found wt gene 443 444 samples (99.8%). in
conclusion, study found mutations k13-propeller gene high prevalence 
of chloroquine susceptible p. falciparum southeast tanzania.
