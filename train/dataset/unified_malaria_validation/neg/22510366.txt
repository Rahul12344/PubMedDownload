background: genetic polymophisms duffy antigen receptor chemokines
(darc) gene successfully protected blood stage infection plasmodium
vivax infection. fy (a-, b-) phenotype predominant among african
populations, particularly originating west africa, rare
among non-african populations. aim study analyse frequency
of four duffy blood groups based snps (t-33c, g125a, g298a c5411t) two 
local tribes sudanese arabs, shagia manasir, the
region fourth nile cataract sudan.
methods: analysis polymorphisms performed 217 individuals (126
representatives shagia tribe 91 manasir). real-time pcr and
taqman genotyping assays used study prevalence alleles and
genotypes.
results: analysis allelic genotype frequency t-33c
polymorphisms demonstrated significant dominance c allele cc
genotype (or = 0.53 [0.32-0.88]; p = 0.02) tribes. g125a polymorphism
is associated phenotype fy(a-, b-) identified 83% shagia and
77% manasir. regard g298a polymorphisms, genotype frequencies were
different tribes (p = 0,002) single aa homozygote found.
based four snps examined, 20 combinations genotypes shagia and
manasir tribes determined. genotype cc/aa/gg/ct occurred often in
shagia tribe (45.9%) rare manasir tribe (6.6%) (p < 0.001 shagia
versus manasir). fy*aes allele identified analysed tribes. the
presence individuals fy*a/fy*a genotype demonstrated 
shagia tribe.
conclusion: probably first report showing genotypically
duffy-negative people carry fy*bes fy*aes. identification the
fy*aes allele tribes may due admixture non-african genetic
background. taken whole, allele genotype frequencies shagia 
and manasir statistically different. however, presence of
individuals fy*a/fy*a genotype demonstrated shagia
tribe.
