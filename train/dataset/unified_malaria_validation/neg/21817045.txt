malaria remains devastating disease largely widespread drug
resistance. new drugs better understanding mechanisms drug action
and resistance essential fulfilling promise eradicating malaria.
using high-throughput chemical screening genome-wide association analysis, we
identified 32 highly active compounds genetic loci associated with
differential chemical phenotypes (dcps), defined greater equal to
fivefold differences half-maximum inhibitor concentration (ic(50)) between
parasite lines. chromosomal loci associated 49 dcps confirmed by
linkage analysis tests genetically modified parasites, including three
genes linked 96% dcps. drugs whose responses mapped to
wild-type mutant pfcrt alleles tested combination vitro in
vivo, yielded promising new leads antimalarial treatments.
