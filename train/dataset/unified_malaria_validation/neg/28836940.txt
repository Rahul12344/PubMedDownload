background: molecular mechanisms transcriptional regulation poorly
understood plasmodium falciparum. addition, genes plasmodium
falciparum transcriptionally poised handful cis-regulatory
elements known operate transcriptional regulation. here, employed an
epigenetic signature based approach identify significance previously
uncharacterised intergenic regions enriched histone modification marks
leading discovery enhancer-like elements.
results: found enhancer-like elements significantly enriched with
h3k4me1, generate unique non-coding bi-directional rnas majority 
function cis-regulators. furthermore, functional enhancer reporter assay
demonstrates enhancer-like elements regulate transcription target
genes plasmodium falciparum. study also suggests plasmodium
genome segregates functionally related genes discrete housekeeping and
pathogenicity/virulence clusters, presumably robust transcriptional control
of virulence/pathogenicity genes.
conclusions: report contributes understanding parasite regulatory 
genomics identification enhancer-like elements, defining epigenetic
and transcriptional features provides resource functional cis-regulatory
elements may give insights virulence/pathogenicity plasmodium
falciparum.
