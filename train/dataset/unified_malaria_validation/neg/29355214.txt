the us national academies' (nas) recent report 'gene drives horizon:
advancing science, navigating uncertainty, aligning research public
values' examines requirements responsible conduct research involving
gene drives non-human organisms. many complex ethical issues raised 
the introduction gene drive technologies mosquito population control 
been anticipated development field-testing earlier-generation
genetic engineering approaches mosquitoes. one issue-the requirement for
informed consent field trials-is addressed explicitly nas' report. 
some commentators presumed informed consent play role a
protection research participants studies genetically modified
mosquitoes. others argued human subjects field trials, 
so informed consent requirement apply. ethically and
practically important presumptions adequately scrutinized to
ensure applications informed consent trials properly
justified. argue informed consent individual research participants
in gene drive trials may required: (1) blood forms clinical 
data collected them, likely case studies
involving epidemiological endpoints, incidence new infections with
dengue malaria; (2) participate social science and/or behavioral
research involving completion surveys questionnaires; (3) when
their home property accessed location recorded spatial

regulations guidelines allow requirements waived modified,
