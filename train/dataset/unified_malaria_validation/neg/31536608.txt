plasmodium relapses attributed activation dormant liver-stage
parasites responsible significant number recurring malaria
blood-stage infections. characteristic human infections caused p.
vivax p. ovale, relative contribution malaria disease burden and
transmission remains poorly understood. largely difficult
to identify 'bona fide' relapse infections due ongoing transmission most
endemic areas. here, use p. cynomolgi-rhesus macaque model relapsing
malaria demonstrate clinical immunity form single
sporozoite-initiated blood-stage infection prevent illness relapses
and homologous reinfections. integrating data whole blood rna-sequencing,
flow cytometry, p. cynomolgi-specific elisas, opsonic phagocytosis assays, we
demonstrate immunity associated rapid recall response by
memory b cells expand produce anti-parasite igg1 mediate
parasite clearance relapsing parasites. reduction parasitemia during
relapses mirrored reduction total number circulating
gametocytes, importantly, cumulative proportion gametocytes increased 
during relapses. overall, study reveals p. cynomolgi relapse infections
can clinically silent macaques due rapid memory b cell responses that
help clear asexual-stage parasites still carry gametocytes.
