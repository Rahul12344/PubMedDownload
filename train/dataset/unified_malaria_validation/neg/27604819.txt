heterozygous somatic mutations affecting spliceosome gene sf3b1 drive
age-related clonal hematopoiesis, myelodysplastic syndromes (mds) other
neoplasms. study role disorders, generated knock-in mice with
hematopoietic-specific expression sf3b1-k700e, commonest type sf3b1
mutation mds. sf3b1k700e/+ animals impaired erythropoiesis progressive
anemia without ringed sideroblasts, well reduced hematopoietic stem cell
numbers host-repopulating fitness. understand molecular basis these
observations, analyzed global rna splicing sf3b1k700e/+ hematopoietic
cells. aberrant splicing associated usage cryptic 3' splice and
branchpoint sites, described human sf3b1 mutants. however, found a
little overlap aberrantly spliced mrnas mouse versus human, suggesting
that anemia may consequence globally disrupted splicing. furthermore, the
murine orthologues genes associated ring sideroblasts human mds,
including abcb7 tmem14c, aberrantly spliced sf3b1k700e/+ mice.
our findings demonstrate that, despite significant differences affected
transcripts, overlap phenotypes associated sf3b1-k700e
between human mouse. future studies focus understanding basis
of similarities differences means deciphering consequences 
of spliceosome gene mutations mds.
