three-dimensional positioning nuclear genome plays important role in
the epigenetic regulation genes. although nucleographic domain
compartmentalization regulation epigenetic state gene expression is
well established higher organisms, remains poorly understood the
pathogenic parasite plasmodium falciparum. present study, report that
two histone tail modifications, h3k9ac h3k14ac, differentially
distributed parasite nucleus. find colocalization active gene
promoters tu1 (tubulin-1 expressed asexual stages) h3k9ac
marks nuclear periphery. contrast, asexual stage inactive gene
promoters pfg27 (gametocyte marker) pfs28 (ookinete marker) occupy
h3k9ac devoid zones nuclear periphery. histone h3k9 predominantly
acetylated pcaf/gcn5 class lysine acetyltransferases, well
characterized parasite. interestingly, embelin, specific inhibitor of
pcaf/gcn5 family histone acetyltransferase, selectively decreases total h3k9ac
acetylation levels (but h3k14ac levels) around var gene promoters,
leading downregulation var gene expression, suggesting interplay among 
histone acetylation status, well subnuclear compartmentalization of
different genes activation parasites. finally, found that
embelin inhibited parasitic growth low micromolar range, raising the
possibility using histone acetyltransferases target antimalarial
therapy.
