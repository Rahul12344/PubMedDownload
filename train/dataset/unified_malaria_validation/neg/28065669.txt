the human malaria parasite, plasmodium falciparum, depends coordinated
regulation gene expression development propagation within human
host. recent developments suggest gene regulation parasite largely
controlled epigenetic mechanisms. here, discuss recent advancements
contributing understanding mechanisms controlling gene regulation
in parasite, including nucleosome landscape, histone modifications, and
nuclear architecture. addition, various processes involved regulation of
parasite-specific genes gene families examined. finally, address the
use epigenetic processes targets novel antimalarial therapies.
collectively, topics highlight unique biology p. falciparum, and
contribute understanding mechanisms regulating gene expression 
deadly parasite.
