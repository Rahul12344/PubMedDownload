identification rna targets rna-binding proteins (rbps) essential for
complete understanding biological functions. however, still a
challenge identify biologically relevant targets rbps vitro 
strategies rip-seq, hits-clip, goldclip due potentially high
background complicated manipulation. malaria parasites, rip-seq gene
disruption tools available currently identification rbp
targets. here, adopted tribe (targets rna binding proteins
identified editing) system vivo identify rna targets pfdis3, a
key exoribonuclease subunit rna exosome plasmodium falciparum. generated
a transgenic parasite line pfdis3-adarcd, catalyzes adenosine
(a)-to-inosine (i) conversion potential interacting sites of
pfdis3-targeting rnas. pfdis3 target genes contain one edit site. the
majority edit sites detected pfdis3-tribe locate exons spread
across entire coding regions. nucleotides adjacent edit sites
contain ∼75% + t. pfdis3-tribe target genes biases toward higher rip
enrichment, suggesting pfdis3-tribe preferentially detects stronger pfdis3
rip targets. collectively, pfdis3-tribe favorable tool identify vivo
target genes rbp high efficiency reproducibility. additionally, the
pfdis3-targeting genes involved stage-related biological processes 
the blood-stage development. thus pfdis3 appears shape dynamic
transcriptional transcriptome malaria parasites post-transcriptional
degradation variety unwanted transcripts strands asexual
blood stage.
