splicing mrna ancient evolutionarily conserved process eukaryotic
organisms, intron-exon structures vary. plasmodium falciparum extreme 
at nucleotide bias (>80%), providing unique opportunity investigate how
evolutionary forces acted intron structures. study, developed 
an vivo luciferase reporter splicing assay employed combination with
lariat isolation sequencing characterize 5' 3' splicing requirements
and experimentally determine intron branch point p. falciparum. this
analysis indicates p. falciparum mrnas canonical 5' 3' splice
sites. however, 5' consensus motif weakly conserved tolerates
nucleotide substitution, including fifth nucleotide intron, is
more typically g nucleotide eukaryotes. comparison, 3' splice
site strong eukaryotic consensus sequence adjacent polypyrimidine
tract. four different p. falciparum pre-mrnas, multiple branch points per
intron detected, u instead typical residue. weak
branch point consensus detected among 18 identified branch points. this
analysis indicates p. falciparum retains many consensus eukaryotic splice
site features, despite extreme codon bias, possesses flexibility in
branch point nucleophilic attack.
