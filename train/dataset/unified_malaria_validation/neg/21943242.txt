background: reports severe cases increasing levels drug resistance
highlight importance improved plasmodium vivax case management. whereas
monitoring p. vivax resistance anti-malarial drug vivo vitro
tests remain challenging, molecular markers resistance represent valuable
tool high-scale analysis surveillance studies. new high-throughput
assay detecting relevant markers related p. vivax drug resistance
was developed assessed papua new guinea (png) patient isolates.
methods: pvdhfr, pvdhps pvmdr1 fragments amplified multiplex nested
pcr. then, pcr products processed ldr-fma (ligase detection
reaction - fluorescent microsphere assay). 23 snps, including pvdhfr 57-58-61 and
173, pvdhps 382-383, 553, 647 pvmdr1 976, simultaneously screened 366
png p. vivax samples.
results: genotyping successful 95.4% samples least one gene.
the coexistence multiple distinct haplotypes parasite population
necessitated introduction computer-assisted approach data analysis.
whereas 73.1% patients infected least one wild-type genotype at
codons 57, 58 61 pvdhfr, triple mutant genotype detected 65.6% of
the patients, often associated 117t mutation. one patient carried
the 173l mutation. mutant 647p pvdhps genotype allele approaching genetic
fixation (99.3%), whereas 35.1% patients infected parasites carrying
the pvmdr1 976f mutant allele.
conclusions: ldr-fma described allows discriminant genotyping of
resistance alleles pvdhfr, pvdhps, pvmdr1 genes used in
large-scale surveillance studies.
