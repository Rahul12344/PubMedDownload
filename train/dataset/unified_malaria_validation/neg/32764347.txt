congenital abnormalities cause serious fetal consequences. term torch used
to designate common perinatal infections, where: (t) refers to
toxoplasmosis, (o) means "others" includes syphilis, varicella-zoster,
parvovirus b19, zika virus (zikv), malaria among others, (r) refers to
rubella, (c) relates cytomegalovirus infection, (h) herpes simplex
virus infections. among main abnormalities identified neonates exposed 
congenital infections central nervous system (cns) damage, microcephaly,
hearing loss, ophthalmological impairment, requiring regular follow-up to
monitor progression. protein changes mutations, post-translational
modifications, abundance, structure, function may indicate pathological
condition onset first symptoms, allowing early diagnosis and
understanding particular disease infection. term "proteomics" is
defined science studies proteome, consists total
protein content cell, tissue organism given space time,
including post-translational modifications (ptms) interactions between
proteins. currently, quantitative bottom-up proteomic strategies allow rapid 
high throughput characterization complex biological mixtures. investigating
proteome modulation host-pathogen interaction helps elucidating the
mechanisms infection predicting disease progression. "molecular
battle" host pathogen key identify drug targets and
diagnostic markers. here, conducted survey proteomic techniques applied
to congenital diseases classified terminology "torch", including
toxoplasmosis, zikv, malaria, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus (hiv),
herpes simplex virus (hsv) human cytomegalovirus (hcvm). highlighted 
proteins and/or protein complexes actively involved infection. the
proteomic studies reported performed cell line models, the
evaluation tissues (brain, muscle, placenta) biofluids (plasma, serum 
and urine) animal models still underexplored. moreover, a
plethora studies focusing pathogen host without considering 
triad mother-fetus-pathogen dynamic interconnected system.
