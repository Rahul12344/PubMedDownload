background: malaria still public health problem malaysia chloroquine
(cq) first-line drug treatment policy uncomplicated malaria. 
there scarcity information magnitude plasmodium falciparum
cq resistance. study aims investigate presence single point
mutations p. falciparum chloroquine-resistance transporter gene (pfcrt) at
codons 76, 271, 326, 356 371 p. falciparum multi-drug resistance-1
gene (pfmdr1) codons 86 1246, molecular markers cq resistance.
methods: total 75 p. falciparum blood samples collected different 
districts pahang state, malaysia. single nucleotide polymorphisms pfcrt
gene (codons 76, 271, 326, 356 371) pfmdr1 gene (codons 86 1246) were
analysed using mutation-specific nested pcr restriction fragment length
polymorphism (pcr-rflp) methods.
results: mutations pfcrt k76t pfcrt r371i prevalent among
pfcrt gene mutations reported study; 52% 77%, respectively. other
codons pfcrt gene positions 86 1246 pfmdr1 gene were
found mostly wild type. significant associations pfcrt k76t, pfcrt n326s
and pfcrt i356t mutations parasitaemia also reported.
conclusion: high existence mutant pfcrt t76 may indicate low
susceptibility p. falciparum isolates cq peninsular malaysia. the
findings study establish baseline data molecular markers p.
falciparum cq resistance, may help surveillance drug resistance
in peninsular malaysia.
