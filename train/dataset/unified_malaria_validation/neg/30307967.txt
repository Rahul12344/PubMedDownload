the objective study identify potential mrna expression changes 
chicken livers associated environmental exposure to
dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (ddt) metabolites (ddts). in
particular, focused genes relating immune system metabolism. 
analyzed liver samples free-ranging chickens kwazulu-natal, south africa,
for contamination ddts. area predominantly uses ddt malaria
control program, homes sprayed annually pesticide. genes
relating immune system metabolism selected potential genetic
biomarkers could linked higher contamination ddts. rt-qpcr
analysis 39 samples showed strong correlations ddts contamination 
mrna expression following genes: avbd1, avbd2, avbd6 avbd7
(down-regulated), cyp17, elovl2 sqle (up-regulated). study shows for
the first time interesting significant correlations genetic material 
collected environmentally-exposed chickens mrna expression several
genes involved immunity metabolism. findings show usefulness 
analysis field samples region high levels environmental
contamination detecting potential biomarkers exposure. particular, we
observed clear effects ddt contamination mrna expression genes
involved immune suppression, endocrine-disrupting effects, lipid
dysregulation. results interest guiding future studies further
elucidate pathways involved clinical importance toxicity associated
with ddt exposure contaminated environments, ascertain health risk to
livestock subsequent risks food security people.
