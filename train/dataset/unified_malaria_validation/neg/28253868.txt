background: plasmodium falciparum surfin4.1 putative ligand expressed the
merozoite likely infected red blood cell, whose gene suggested 
be directional selection eastern kenyan population, under
balancing selection thai population. understand difference, surf
4.1 sequences western kenyan p. falciparum isolates analysed. frameshift 
mutations copy number variation (cnv) also examined parasites
from western kenya thailand.
results: positively significant departures neutral expectations were
detected surf 4.1 region encoding c-terminus variable region 2
(var2) 3 population-based tests western kenyan population similar in
the thai population, covered previous analysis eastern
kenyan population. significant excess non-synonymous substitutions per
nonsynonymous site synonymous substitutions per synonymous site also
detected var2 region. negatively significant departures neutral
expectations detected region encoding var1 c-terminus consistent to
the previous observation eastern kenyan population. parasites possessing a
frameshift mutation resulting product without intracellular trp-rich (wr)
domains 22/23 western kenya 22/36 thailand. one copy 
surf 4.1 gene detected western kenya (4/24), cnv found in
thailand (0/36).
conclusions: authors infer high polymorphism surfin4.1 var2
c-terminus kenyan thai populations shaped-up diversifying
selection maintained balancing selection. phenomena likely
driven immunological pressure. whereas surfin4.1 var1 c-terminus is
suggested directional selection consistent previous report for
the eastern kenyan population. western kenyan isolates possess frameshift 
mutation would limit expression surfin4.1 merozoite, 
60% thai isolates possess frameshift, would affect level and
type selection pressure protein seen two
extremities tajima's values var1 c-terminus kenyan thai
populations. cnv observed kenyan isolates may consequence this
frameshift mutation increase benefits merozoite surface.
