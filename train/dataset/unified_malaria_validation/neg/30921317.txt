background: malaria remains endemic several countries south america with
low moderate transmission intensity. regional human migration through
underserved endemic areas may responsible significant parasite dispersion 
making disease resilient interventions. thus, genetic characterization
of malarial parasites important tool assess endemic areas may
connect via movement infected individuals. here, four sites in
geographically separated areas reporting 80% malaria morbidity colombia
were studied. sites located imaginary transect line 1,500 km
from northwest south pacific coast colombia minimal distance
of 500 km populations display noticeable ethnic, economic,
epidemiological, ecological differences.
methodology/principal findings: total 624 plasmodium vivax samples 
four populations genotyped using eight microsatellite loci. although a
strong geographic structure expected populations, moderate
evidence genetic differentiation observed using suite population
genetic analyses. high genetic diversity, shared alleles, low linkage
disequilibrium also found p. vivax populations providing no
evidence bottleneck clonal expansions expected recent reductions
in transmission could result scaling interventions
or environmental changes. patterns consistent disease is
not endemic site also imply gene flow among 
populations across 1,500 km.
conclusion /significance: observed patterns p. vivax consistent a
"corridor" connected endemic areas sustain high level genetic
diversity locally restore parasite-subdivided populations via migration
of infected individuals even local interventions achieved substantial
reduction clinical cases. consequences findings terms of
control elimination discussed.
