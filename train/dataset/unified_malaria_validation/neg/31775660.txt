background: recent studies shown cd103 important marker for
tissue-resident memory cells (trm) plays important role in
anti-infection. however, role cd103+ trm elucidated the
progress s. japonicum infection induced disease.
methods: 6-8 weeks old c57bl/6 mice infected s. japonicum. mice were
sacrificed lungs removed 5-6 weeks infection.
immunofluorescent staining q-pcr performed identify expression of
cd103 molecule. single cellular populations made, percentages cd103 on
both cd4+ cd8+ lymphocytes dynamical observed flow cytometry (fcm).
moreover, expression memory cells related molecules cd69 cd62l, t
cell function associated molecules cd107a, ifn-γ, il-4, il-9, il-10 were
compared cd103+ cd4+ cd8+ cells fcm.
results: cd103+ cells emerged lung naive s. japonicum
infected mice. percentage absolute numbers pulmonary cd4+ and
cd8+ cells increased s. japonicum infection (p < 0.05). percentage
of cd103+ cells cd8+ cells decreased significantly early stage s. 
japonicum infection (p < 0.05). increased cd69, decreased cd62l cd107a
expressions detected cd4+ cd8+ cd103+ cells lungs of
infected mice (p < 0.05). compared cd8+ cd103+ cells, cd4+ cd103+ cells
from infected mice expressed higher level cd69 lower level cd62l molecules
(p < 0.05). moreover, higher percentage il-4+, il-9+ il-10+ cells cd4+ 
cd103+ pulmonary cells found infected mice (p < 0.05). significantly
increased il-4 il-9, decreased ifn-γ expressing cells detected in
cd8+cd103+ cells infected mice (p < 0.05).
conclusions: cd103-expressing pulmonary cd4+ cd8+ cells play important
roles mediating s. japonicum infection induced granulomatous inflammation in
the lung.
