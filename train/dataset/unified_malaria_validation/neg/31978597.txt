a platyhelminth, spirometra erinaceieuropaei, belonging class cestoda,
causes human sparganosis, infection larva results subtle
inflammation body host. previously reported purification 
a glycoprotein, plerocercoid-immunosuppressive factor (p-isf) the
excretory/secretory products s. erinaceieuropaei plerocercoids may be
involved immuno-modification. determined sequence p-isf the
n-terminal internal 10 amino acids p-isf using degenerate pcr 5'- 
and 3'-race methods. putative gene encoding p-isf 1443 bp long the
gene contained 10 exons 9 introns genomic dna size 5205 bp. p-isf
consists 480 amino acids including n-terminal signal peptide sequence, and
has two unknown domains,-cestoda cysteine-rich domains (ccds) fibronectin
type iii domain two ccds. cysteine residues conserved the
two ccds, shared 62% amino acid identities. homologous analysis revealed
that ccds homologous unknown protein diphyllobothrium latum. 
to produce specific antibodies, expressed recombinant p-isf (rp-isf) using
wheat germ protein synthetic system. p-isf localized sub-cutaneous
tissues parenchymal tissues plerocercoids. transcription p-isf 
detected plerocercoid stage, adult stage. western blotting
also showed band plerocercoide stage adult. rp-isf not
suppress nitrite production raw 264.7 cells stimulated lps, this
might due lack carbohydrate chains recombinant protein.
