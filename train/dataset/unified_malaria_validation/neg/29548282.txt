background: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd; ec 1.1.1.49) deficiency is
one common x-linked recessive hereditary disorders world.
primaquine (pq) used radical cure p. vivax prevent relapse.
recently, also used reduce p. falciparum gametocyte carriage block
transmission. however, pq metabolites oxidize hemoglobin generate excessive
reactive oxygen species trigger acute hemolytic anemia malaria
patients inherited g6pd deficiency.
methods: total 252 blood samples collected malaria patients myanmar 
were used study. g6pd variant analysed multiplex allele specific
pcr kit, diaplexc™ g6pd genotyping kit [asian type]. accuracy the
multiplex allele specific pcr confirmed sequencing analysis.
results: prevalence distribution g6pd variants 252 malaria patients 
myanmar analysed. six different types g6pd allelic variants were
identified 50 (7 females 43 males) malaria patients. predominant
variant mahidol (68%, 34/50), 91.2% (31/34) 8.8% (3/34) were
males females, respectively. g6pd variants including kaiping (18%,
9/50), viangchan (6%, 3/50), mediterranean (4%, 2/50), union (2%, 1/50) and
canton (2%, 1/50) also observed.
conclusions: results study suggest concern proper safe 
use pq radical cure malaria myanmar needed combining g6pd
deficiency test pq prescription. establishment follow-up system to
monitor potential pq toxicity malaria patients given pq also
required.
