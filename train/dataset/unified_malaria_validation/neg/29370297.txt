a microscopy-based diagnosis gold standard detection and
identification malaria parasites patient's blood. however, detection 
of cases involving low number parasites differentiation species
sometimes requires skilled microscopist. although pcr-based diagnostic methods 
are already known powerful tools, time required apply such
methods still much longer comparison traditional microscopic
observation. thus, improvements pcr systems sought facilitate 
rapid accurate detection human malaria parasites plasmodium falciparum, p.
vivax, p. ovale, p. malariae, well p. knowlesi, simian
malaria parasite currently widely distributed southeast asia. nested
pcr targets small subunit ribosomal rna genes malaria parasites was
performed using "fast pcr enzyme". first pcr, universal primers 
parasite species used. second pcr, inner-specific primers, which
targeted sequences p. falciparum, p. vivax, p. ovale, p. malariae, p.
knowlesi, used. pcr reaction time reduced use "fast 
pcr enzyme", 65 minutes required perform first second pcrs. 
the specific primers reacted sequences targeted parasite
species never cross-reacted sequences species the
defined pcr conditions. diagnoses 36 clinical samples obtained
using new pcr system highly consistent microscopic diagnoses.
