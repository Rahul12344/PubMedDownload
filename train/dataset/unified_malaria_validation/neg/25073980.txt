background: proteins abc family (atp-binding cassette) represent the
largest known group efflux pumps, responsible transporting specific
molecules across lipid membranes prokaryotic eukaryotic organisms. in
arthropods shown play role insecticide defense/resistance.
the presence abc transporters possible association insecticide 
transport yet investigated mosquito anopheles stephensi, the
major vector human malaria middle east south asian regions. we
investigated presence role abcs transport permethrin insecticide
in susceptible strain mosquito species.
methods: identify abc transporter genes obtained transcriptome from
untreated larvae an. stephensi compared annotated
transcriptome anopheles gambiae. analyse association abc
transporters permethrin conducted bioassays permethrin alone in
combination abc inhibitor, investigated expression profiles
of identified genes larvae exposed permethrin.
results: bioassays showed increased mortality mosquitoes permethrin
was used combination abc-transporter inhibitor. genes abc
transporters detected transcriptome, five selected
(anstabcb2, anstabcb3, anstabcb4, anstabcmember6 anstabcg4). increased
expression one (anstabcg4) observed larvae exposed ld50 
dose permethrin. contrary found insect species, no
up-regulation observed anstabcb genes.
conclusions: results show first time involvement abc
transporters larval defense permethrin an. stephensi and, in
general, confirm role abc transporters insecticide defense. the
differences observed previous studies highlight need research
as, despite growing number studies abc transporters insects, the
heterogeneity results available present allow us infer
general trends abc transporter-insecticide interactions.
