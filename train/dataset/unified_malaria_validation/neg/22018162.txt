background: mechanisms anti-malarial immune responses occur still
not fully clear. natural killer (nk) cells thought play pivotal role 
innate responses plasmodium falciparum. study, suitability of
nk92 cells models nk mechanisms involved immune response
against malaria investigated.
methods: nk92 cells assessed several signs activation and
cytotoxicity due contact parasites well examined by
oligonucleotide microarrays insight impact p. falciparum-infected
erythrocytes transcriptome. address parasite side such
interaction, growth inhibition assays performed including non-nk cells as
controls.
results: performing microarrays nk92 cells, impact parasites 
transcriptional level observed. findings show that, although not
evidently activated irbcs, nk92 cells show transcriptional signs priming
and proliferation. addition, decreased parasitaemia observed due to
co-incubation nk92 cells. however, effect might nk-specific
since irrelevant cells also affected parasite growth vitro.
conclusions: although nk92 cells shown behave poor models 
nk immune response parasites, results obtained study may be
of use future investigations regarding host-parasites interactions in
malaria.
