sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine never recommended treatment of
plasmodium vivax malaria parasite intrinsically resistant to
pyrimethamine. combination introduced promising agent treat
plasmodium falciparum malaria many countries withdrawn few
years due development spread resistant strains. presently,
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine used partner drug artemisinin-based
combination therapy treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria, combination 
of artesunate-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine currently use india. in
countries like india, p. vivax p. falciparum equally
prevalent, proportion p. vivax bacteria exposed to
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine due misdiagnosis mixed infections. reports on
the vivo therapeutic efficacy sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine p. vivax are
rare, study mutations marker genes p. vivax dhfr (pvdhfr) and
pvdhps important predicting drug selection pressure and
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance monitoring. studied prevalence of
point mutations haplotypes genes 80 p. vivax isolates
collected urban kolkata, india, dna sequencing method. point mutation
rates genes low. double mutant pvdhfr a15n50r58n117i173
(mutations boldface) single mutant pvdhps genotype
s382g383k512a553v585 prevalent, 35% isolates harbored 
wild-type genotype. triple mutant anrni-sgkav found 29.9% isolates. no
quintuple mutant genotype recorded. p. vivax parasites urban kolkata
may still susceptible sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. hence, combination of
antimalarial drugs like artesunate-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine introduced p.
falciparum infection might effective p. vivax infection also. study 
therapeutic efficacy combination p. vivax thus strongly suggested.
