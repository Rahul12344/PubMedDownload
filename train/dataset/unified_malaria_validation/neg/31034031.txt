background: emergence resistant parasites artemisinin poses threat to
malaria treatment. study aimed investigate k13 gene mutations in
plasmodium falciparum artesunate (as)/sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) efficacy
study sudan.
methods: total 31 (14 failures 17 adequate clinical parasitological 
response [acpr]) pretreatment dried blood samples patients with
uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria treated as/sp examined. nested
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) dna sequencing k13 gene performed.
results: pcr products obtained 30 (96.8%) samples sequencing was
successful 28 (90.3%). mutation k13 gene recorded the
treatment failure group. single mutation (c>t; a621v) one acpr patient
sample detected.
conclusion: evidence k13 mutation among as/sp treatment failure
patients. single mutation k13 gene linked treatment failure has
been detected.
