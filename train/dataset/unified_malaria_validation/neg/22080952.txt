erythrocyte invasion plasmodium falciparum central pathogenesis of
malaria. invasion requires series extracellular recognition events between
erythrocyte receptors ligands merozoite, invasive form the
parasite. none known receptor-ligand interactions involved are
required parasite strains, indicating parasite able access 
multiple redundant invasion pathways. here, show identified a
receptor-ligand pair essential erythrocyte invasion tested p. 
falciparum strains. systematically screening library erythrocyte
proteins, found ok blood group antigen, basigin, receptor
for pfrh5, parasite ligand essential blood stage growth.
erythrocyte invasion potently inhibited soluble basigin basigin
knockdown, invasion could completely blocked using low concentrations of
anti-basigin antibodies; importantly, effects observed across all
laboratory-adapted field strains tested. furthermore, ok(a-) erythrocytes,
which express basigin variant weaker binding affinity pfrh5, had
reduced invasion efficiencies. discovery cross-strain dependency a
single extracellular receptor-ligand pair erythrocyte invasion p.
falciparum provides focus new anti-malarial therapies.
