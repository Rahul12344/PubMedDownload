the selection insecticide resistance malaria vectors potential to
compromise insecticide-based malaria vector control program. ensure that
transmission-interrupting tools remain effective, choice evidence
based, insecticide surveillance monitoring essential. study assessed 
and compared residual efficacy organophosphate insecticide pirimiphos
methyl (actellic 300 cs, 0-2-diethylamino-6-methylpyrimidin-4-yl 0,
0-dimethylphosphorothioate) 1 g/m2 pyrethroid deltamethrin (k-othrine 
wg 250, (s)-alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl (1r, 3r)-3-
(2,2-dibromovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylate) 20 mg/m2 indoor
residual spraying cement mud-rendered walls inside houses. insecticide
susceptibility profiles local malaria vectors also assessed using world
health organization standard protocols. residual efficacy actellic 300 cs 
on cement mud walls lasted 5 mo surfaces, complete mortality
of anopheles gambiae sensu stricto giles (kisumu strain) (diptera: culicidae) 
cone assays. 8 mo, average residual effect actellic 300 cs remained
much better cement walls mud walls significantly different
from deltamethrin-treated cement walls. anopheles funestus sensu stricto giles
was resistant 0.05% deltamethrin 0.01% bendiocarb remained completely 
susceptible 5% malathion 4% dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane. the
duplicated p450 genes, cyp6p9a cyp6p9b, found highly overexpressed
in deltamethrin-resistant an. funestus s.s compared bendiocarb-resistant 
individuals. pirimiphos methyl cs recommended intra-domiciliary spraying
for malaria control could replace dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane within 
context insecticide resistance management strategy.
