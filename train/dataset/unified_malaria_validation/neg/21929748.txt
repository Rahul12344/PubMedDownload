the influence host genetics susceptibility plasmodium falciparum malaria
has extensively studied past twenty years. clear that
malaria parasites imposed strong selective forces human genome in
endemic regions. different genes identified associated with
different malaria related phenotypes. factors promote severity malaria
include parasitaemia, parasite induced inflammation, anaemia sequestration of
parasitized erythrocytes brain microvasculature.recent advances human
genome research technologies genome-wide association studies (gwas) and
fine genotyping tools enabled discovery several genetic polymorphisms
and biomarkers warrant study host-parasite interactions. this
review describes discusses human gene polymorphisms identified thus far 
have shown associated susceptibility resistance p.
falciparum malaria. although polymorphisms play significant roles in
susceptibility malaria, several findings inconclusive contradictory
and must considered caution. discovery genetic markers associated 
with different malaria phenotypes help elucidate pathophysiology of
malaria enable development interventions cures. diversity human
populations well environmental effects influence clinical
heterogeneity malaria, thus warranting investigations goal of
developing new interventions, therapies better management malaria.
