pyrethroid insecticides front line vector control tools used bed nets 
to reduce malaria transmission burden. however, resistance major
vectors anopheles arabiensis posing serious challenge success
of malaria control. herein, elucidated molecular biochemical basis 
pyrethroid resistance knockdown resistance-free anopheles arabiensis
population chad, central africa. using heterologous expression p450s in
escherichia coli coupled metabolism assays established the
over-expressed p450 cyp6p4, located major pyrethroid resistance (rp1)
quantitative trait locus (qtl), responsible resistance type type 
ii pyrethroid insecticides, exception deltamethrin, correlation
with field resistance profile. however, cyp6p4 exhibited metabolic activity
towards non-pyrethroid insecticides, including ddt, bendiocarb, propoxur and
malathion. combining fluorescent probes inhibition assays molecular docking 
simulation, established cyp6p4 bind deltamethrin cannot
metabolise it. possibly due steric hindrance large vdw 
radius bromine atoms dihalovinyl group deltamethrin docks into
the heme catalytic centre. establishment cyp6p4 partial pyrethroid
resistance gene explained observed field resistance permethrin, its
inability metabolise deltamethrin probably explained high mortality from
deltamethrin exposure field populations sudano-sahelian an.
arabiensis. findings describe heterogeneity resistance towards
insecticides, even class, highlighting need thoroughly
understand molecular basis resistance implementing resistance
management/control tools.
