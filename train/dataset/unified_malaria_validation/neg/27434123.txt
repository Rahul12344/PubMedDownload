malaria vaccine development hampered limited availability of
antigens identified conventional discovery approaches, improvements
are needed enhance efficacy leading vaccine candidate rts,s that
targets circumsporozoite protein (csp) infective sporozoite. we
report transcriptome-based approach identify novel pre-erythrocytic vaccine 
antigens could potentially used combination csp. hypothesized 
that stage-specific upregulated genes would enrich protective vaccine
targets, used tiling microarray identify p. falciparum genes transcribed
at higher levels liver stage versus sporozoite blood stages of
development. prepared dna vaccines 21 genes using predicted
orthologues p. yoelii p. berghei tested efficacy using different
delivery methods pre-erythrocytic malaria rodent models. our
primary screen using p. yoelii balb/c mice, found 16 antigens
significantly reduced liver stage parasite burden. confirmatory screen
using p. berghei c57bl/6 mice, confirmed 6 antigens protective in
both models. two antigens, combined csp, provided significantly greater
protection csp alone models. based observations reported
here, transcriptional patterns plasmodium genes useful identifying
novel pre-erythrocytic antigens induce protective immunity alone in
combination csp.
