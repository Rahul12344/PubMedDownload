background: study describes bioinformatics approach designed identify
plasmodium vivax proteins potentially involved reticulocyte invasion.
specifically, different protein training sets built tuned based on
different biological parameters, experimental evidence secretion
and/or involvement invasion-related processes. profile-based sequence method
supported hidden markov models (hmms) used build classifiers to
search biologically-related proteins. transcriptional profile p.
vivax intra-erythrocyte developmental cycle screened using these
classifiers.
results: bioinformatics methodology identifying potentially secreted p.
vivax proteins designed using sequence redundancy reduction probabilistic
profiles. methodology led identifying set 45 proteins are
potentially secreted p. vivax intra-erythrocyte development cycle 
could involved cell invasion. thirteen 45 proteins already been
described vaccine candidates; experimental evidence protein
expression 7 32 remaining ones, previous studies of
expression, function immunology carried additional 25.
conclusions: results support idea probabilistic techniques like
profile hmms improve similarity searches. also, different adjustments as
sequence redundancy reduction using pisces cd-hit allowed data clustering
based rational reproducible measurements. kind approach selecting 
proteins specific functions highly important supporting large-scale
analyses could aid identification genes encoding potential new
target antigens vaccine development drug design. present study has
led targeting 32 proteins testing regarding ability to
induce protective immune responses p. vivax malaria.
