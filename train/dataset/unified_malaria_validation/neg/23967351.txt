despite efficient vector transmission, plasmodium parasites suffer great
bottlenecks developmental stages within anopheles mosquitoes. the
outcome depends complex three-way interaction host, parasite gut
bacteria. although considerable progress made recently deciphering
anopheles effector responses, little currently known regarding underlying 
microbial immune elicitors. interesting candidate sense the
pathogen-derived prenyl pyrophosphate designated phosphoantigen
(e)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (hmbpp), found plasmodium 
most eubacteria higher eukaryotes. hmbpp potent stimulant 
known human vγ9vδ2 cells, unique lymphocyte subset expands during
several infections including malaria. study, show vγ9vδ2 cells 
proliferate stimulated supernatants intraerythrocytic stages of
plasmodium falciparum cultures, suggesting biologically relevant doses of
phosphoantigens excreted parasite. next, used anopheles gambiae 
investigate immune- redox- stimulating effects hmbpp. demonstrate a
potent activation vitro one signaling pathways earlier

erk activated a. gambiae 4a3b cell line. additionally, hmbpp and
the downstream endogenous metabolite isopentenyl pyrophosphate displayed
antioxidant effects promoting cellular tolerance hydrogen peroxide
challenge. provided mosquito blood meal, hmbpp induced temporal
changes expression several immune genes. contrast to
meso-diaminopimelic acid containing peptidoglycan, hmbpp induced expression of
dual oxidase nitric oxide synthase, two key determinants plasmodium
infection. furthermore, temporal fluctuations midgut bacterial numbers were
observed. multifaceted effects observed study indicates hmbpp is
an important elicitor common plasmodium gut bacteria the
