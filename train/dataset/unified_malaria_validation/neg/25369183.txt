toxoplasma gondii malaria parasites contain unique essential relict
plastid called apicoplast. apicoplast proteins encoded the
nucleus transported organelle via endoplasmic reticulum (er). 
three trafficking routes proposed apicoplast membrane proteins: (i)
vesicular trafficking er golgi apicoplast, (ii)
contiguity er membrane apicoplast allowing direct flow of
proteins, (iii) vesicular transport directly er apicoplast.
previously, identified set membrane proteins t. gondii apicoplast 
which also detected large vesicles near organelle. data presented
here show large vesicles bearing apicoplast membrane proteins not
the major carriers luminal proteins. vesicles continue appear in
parasites lost plastid due mis-segregation, indicating that
the vesicles derived apicoplast. test role golgi
body vesicle formation, parasites treated brefeldin transiently
transfected dominant-negative mutant sar1, gtpase required er 
golgi trafficking. immunofluorescence patterns showed little change. these
findings confirmed using stable transfectants, expressed toxic
dominant-negative sar1 following cre-loxp mediated promoter juxtaposition. our
data support hypothesis large vesicles mediate the
trafficking luminal proteins apicoplast. results show 
the large vesicles bearing apicoplast membrane proteins continue observed
in absence golgi plastid function. data raise possibility
that apicoplast proteome generated two novel er plastid trafficking 
pathways, plus small set proteins encoded apicoplast genome.
