the role infection erythropoietic dysfunction poorly understood. in
children p. falciparum malaria, by-product hemoglobin digestion in
infected red cells (hemozoin) associated severity anemia 
independent circulating levels inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis
alpha (tnf-α). gain insight common specific effects tnf-α 
hemozoin erythropoiesis, studied gene expression profile purified
primary erythroid cultures exposed either tnf-α (10 ng/ml) hemozoin
(12.5 μg/ml heme units) 24 hours. perturbed gene function assessed using 
co-annotation associated gene ontologies expression selected genes
representative profile observed confirmed real time pcr (rtpcr).
the changes gene expression induced agent largely distinct; many 
of genes significantly modulated tnf-α affected hemozoin. 
genes modulated tnf-α significantly enriched encoding proteins 
involved control type 1 interferon signalling immune response
to viral infection. contrast, genes induced hemozoin significantly
enriched functional roles regulation transcription apoptosis.
further analyses rtpcr revealed hemozoin increases expression of
transcription factors form part integrated stress response is
accompanied reduced expression genes involved dna repair. study

anemia. generally respective transcription profiles highlight varied
mechanisms erythropoiesis may disrupted infectious
