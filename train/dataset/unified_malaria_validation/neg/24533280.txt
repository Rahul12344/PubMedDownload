the need new antimalarials persistent due emergence drug
resistant parasites. aim identify new drug targets plasmodium
falciparum phylogenomics among plasmodium spp. comparative genomics to
homo sapiens. proposed target discovery pipeline largely independent of
experimental data based assumption p. falciparum proteins are
likely essential (i) similar proteins proteome 
and (ii) highly conserved across malaria parasites mammals. 
hypothesis tested using sequenced saccharomycetaceae species touchstone.
consecutive filters narrowed potential target space p. falciparum 
proteins likely essential, matchless human proteome,
expressed blood stages parasite, amenable small molecule
inhibition. final set 40 candidate drug targets significantly enriched
in essential proteins comprised proven targets (e.g. dihydropteroate
synthetase enzymes non-mevalonate pathway), targets currently under
investigation (e.g. calcium-dependent protein kinases), new candidates of
potential interest phosphomannose isomerase, phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxylase, signaling components, transporters. targets prioritized
based druggability indices availability vitro assays.
potential inhibitors inferred similarity known targets other
disease systems. identified candidates p. falciparum provide insight
into biochemical peculiarities vulnerable points malaria parasite 
might serve starting points rational drug discovery.
