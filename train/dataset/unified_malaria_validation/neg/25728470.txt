male traits signal health vigour used females choose better
quality mates, cases male trait selected females differs among
populations. multiple male traits maintained female mate choice if
both traits equally honest indicators male quality, tests this
prediction rare. choosing males based traits, females could gain
direct benefits males (assistance parental care), females
choose extra-pair mates based traits, females gain male sperm, 
potentially indirect genetic benefits offspring. common
yellowthroats (geothylpis trichas), female choice extra-pair mates targets two
different plumage ornaments: black mask wisconsin population the
yellow bib new york population. previously, found black mask 
wisconsin related greater major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class ii
variation, turn signals better survival disease resistance. 
study, examined signalling function yellow bib new york test 
whether signals aspects male quality black mask in
wisconsin. predicted, found yellow bib new york closely
associated mhc variation, also signals survival resistance to
blood parasites. thus, ornament preferred females differs two 
populations, different ornaments signal similar aspects male health
and genetic quality, specifically information regarding mhc variation and
potential indirect genetic benefits females.
