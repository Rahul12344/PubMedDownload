background: chloroquine (cq), alone combination with
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, widely used treatment plasmodium
falciparum plasmodium vivax several decades vanuatu solomon
islands prior introduction artemether-lumefantrine (al) 2008.
however, effect chloroquine selection parasite population, may
affect efficacy lumefantrine partner drugs artemisinin, has
not well assessed. study aims provide baseline data molecular
markers (pfcrt pfmdr1), along origins pfcrt, prior the
introduction al.
methods: blood spots obtained epidemiological surveys conducted on
tanna island, tafea province, vanuatu temotu province, solomon islands in
2008. additional samples malaita province, solomon islands collected as
part artemether-lumefantrine efficacy study 2008. plasmodium falciparum 
pfcrt pfmdr1 genes examined polymorphisms. microsatellite markers
flanking pfcrt also examined ascertain origins cq resistance.
results: pfcrt analysis revealed 100% parasites tafea province, vanuatu
and malaita province, solomon islands 98% parasites temotu province, 
solomon islands carried k76t polymorphism confers cq resistance.
comparison pfcrt allelic patterns microsatellite markers flanking pfcrt
revealed six haplotypes 70% isolates possessing haplotypes very
similar observed papua new guinea. dominant (98.5%) pfmdr1 allele
across island groups yycnd.
conclusions: prior introduction al solomon islands vanuatu, 
p. falciparum isolates possessed point mutations known confer cq resistance
and possibly associated decreased susceptibility quinine and
halofantrine, increased susceptibility artemisinin lumefantrine.
overall, pfcrt allelic types flanking microsatellite markers exhibited
similarities papua new guinea, suggesting parasites share a
common ancestry. current use al p. falciparum p. vivax
infections enable changes markers, absence cq pressure,
to monitored.
