whole-sporozoite vaccines engender sterilizing immunity malaria animal
models importantly, humans. gene editing allows removal of
specific parasite genes, enabling generation genetically attenuated parasite
(gap) strains vaccination. using rodent malaria parasites, previously
shown late liver stage-arresting replication-competent (larc) gaps confer
superior protection compared early liver stage-arresting
replication-deficient gaps radiation-attenuated sporozoites. however,
generating larc gap human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum (p.
falciparum) challenging. here, report generation and
characterization likely unprecedented p. falciparum larc gap generated by
targeted gene deletion mei2 gene: p. falciparum mei2-. robust
exoerythrocytic schizogony extensive cell growth dna replication was
observed p. falciparum mei2- liver stages human liver-chimeric mice.
however, p. falciparum mei2- liver stages failed complete development 
not form infectious exoerythrocytic merozoites, thereby preventing their
transition asexual blood stage infection. therefore, p. falciparum mei2- 
replication-competent, attenuated human malaria parasite strain potentially 
increased potency, useful vaccination protect p. falciparum
malaria infection.
