background: highly efficient crispr/cas9-based marker-free genome editing
system established plasmodium falciparum (pf). however, the
current methods, two drug-selectable markers needed episome retention,
which may present hurdles consecutive genome manipulations due limited
number available selectable markers. loading capacity donor dna also
unsatisfactory due large size cas9 nuclease sgrna co-expression
system, limits size knock-in dna fragments. the
inefficient end joining (ej) dna repair mechanism pf, suicide-rescue
approach could used address challenges. cas9 nuclease sgrna were
co-expressed single plasmid (suicide vector) one selectable marker,
and donor dna ligated plasmid (rescue vector) containing
only ampicillin-resistance gene (ampr) colel replication origin (ori). 
nonetheless, whether approach mediate even regular gene editing in
pf remains unknown. study aimed demonstrate basic gene editing
function cas9-mediated suicide-rescue system.
findings: suicide rescue vectors constructed co-transfected into
pf3d7. system worked expected used disrupt pfset2 gene to
insert green fluorescent protein-renilla luciferase (gfp-ruc) fusion gene
cassette 3334 base pairs (bp) pf47 locus, demonstrating the
suicide vector actually induced double-strand breaks (dsbs) rescue
vector functioned without maintenance via drug selection.
conclusions: adapted marker-free crispr/cas9 system single
episome-selectable marker performs well current systems general gene
editing lays solid foundation studies including consecutive
gene manipulations large gene knock-ins.
