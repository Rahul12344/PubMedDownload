malaria still one important health-problems world is
endemic iran. since 1994, collapse former soviet union, new threat 
of malaria importation emerged countries northern iran. 
work carried provide evidence status anopheline
species composition, malaria parasite species, natural infectivity of
mosquitoes distributed pars-abad district, borderline azerbaijan 
northwestern iran. mosquitoes collected may december 2008 in
anopheline seasonal activity identified species level. genus-
and species-specific primers plasmodium ssrdna gene used for
specific amplification female mosquito head+thorax. members anoheles
maculipennis complex identified sequence analysis ribosomal
internal transcribed spacer ii (its2-rdna). morphological character-based
identification showed 1455 anopheline female specimens, 1121 (77%)
were a. maculipennis s.l. 334 (23%) anoheles hyrcanus. molecular
analysis species complex indicated presence anoheles sacharovi 984 
(67.6%) a. maculipennis 137 (9.4%) region. none themosquito's
head-thorax found naturally infected malaria parasite. results of
this study, particularly high dominance a. sacharovi, suggest potential risk
of malaria epidemic region, need continuous epidemiological 
surveillance.
