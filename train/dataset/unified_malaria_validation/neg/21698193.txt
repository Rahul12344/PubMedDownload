background: apical membrane antigen 1 (ama1) leading candidate vaccine
antigen blood-stage malaria, although date numerous clinical trials
using mainly protein-in-adjuvant vaccines shown limited success. we
describe pre-clinical development optimization recombinant human and
simian adenoviral (adhu5 chad63) orthopoxviral (mva) vectors encoding
transgene inserts plasmodium falciparum ama1 (pfama1).
methodology/principal findings: adhu5-mva prime-boost vaccination mice and
rabbits using vectors encoding 3d7 allele pfama1 induced cellular
immune responses well high-titer antibodies showed growth inhibitory
activity (gia) homologous heterologous parasite strains. in
an effort overcome issues pfama1 antigenic polymorphism and
pre-existing immunity adhu5, simian adenoviral (chad63) vector mva
encoding two alleles pfama1 developed. antigen, composed 3d7 
and fvo alleles pfama1 fused tandem expression driven single 
promoter, optimized antigen secretion transmembrane expression. these
bi-allelic pfama1 vaccines, administered mice rabbits, demonstrated
comparable immunogenicity mono-allelic vaccines purified serum igg now
showed gia two divergent strains p. falciparum encoded the
vaccine. cd8(+) cd4(+) cell responses epitopes both
common unique two alleles pfama1 also measured mice.
conclusions/significance: optimized transgene inserts encoding two divergent
alleles antigen successfully inserted adeno- and
pox-viral vaccine vectors. adenovirus-mva immunization leads induction 
t cell responses common alleles, well functional antibody responses
that effective encoded strains p. falciparum vitro.
these data support clinical development vaccine candidates
in phase i/iia clinical trials.
