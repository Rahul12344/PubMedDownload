the main atheroprotective mechanism high-density lipoprotein (hdl) been
regarded reverse cholesterol transport, whereby cholesterol peripheral
tissues removed transported liver elimination. although
numerous additional atheroprotective mechanisms suggested, role 
hdl modulating signal transduction cell membrane-bound receptors has
received little attention date. potential recently highlighted
following identification polymorphism adenylyl cyclase 9 gene
(adcy9) shown determining factor risk cardiovascular
(cv) events patients treated hdl-raising compound dalcetrapib.
indeed, adcy9 part signaling pathway β2-adrenergic receptor
(β2-ar) membrane-bound proteins affected changes membrane-rich
cholesterol plasma membrane domains (caveolae). numerous g-protein-coupled
receptors (gpcrs) ion channels affected caveolae, caveolae
composition acting 'signalosome'. polymorphisms genes encoding adcy9 
and β2-ar associated response β2-agonist drugs patients with
asthma, malaria sickle cell disease. crystallization β2-ar has
found cholesterol tightly bound transmembrane structures receptor.
cholesterol also shown modulate activity receptor.
apolipoprotein a1 (apoa1), major protein component hdl, destabilizes and
removes cholesterol caveolae high affinity interaction with
atp-binding cassette transporter. furthermore, β2-ar activity may affected 
apoa1/hdl-targeted therapies. taken together, observations suggest common
pathway potentially links primary hdl function regulation signal
transduction.
