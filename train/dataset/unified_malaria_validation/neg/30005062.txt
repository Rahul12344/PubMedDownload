the mitochondrial f-type atp synthase, multisubunit nanomotor, critical 
maintaining cellular atp levels. t. gondii apicomplexan parasites,
many subunit components necessary proper assembly functioning this
enzyme appear missing. here, report identification 20 novel
subunits t. gondii f-type atp synthase mass spectrometry analysis of
partially purified monomeric (approximately 600 kda) dimeric (>1 mda) forms
of enzyme. despite extreme sequence diversification, key fo subunits a, b,
and identified conserved structural features. orthologs these
proteins restricted apicomplexan, chromerid, dinoflagellate species.
interestingly, absence ciliates indicates major diversion, with
respect subunit composition enzyme, within alveolate clade.
discovery highly diversified novel components apicomplexan f-type
atp synthase complex could facilitate development novel antiparasitic
agents. structural functional characterization unusual enzyme complex
will advance fundamental understanding energy metabolism apicomplexan
species.
