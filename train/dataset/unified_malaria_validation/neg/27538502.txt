background: understanding regulation mechanism var gene expression is
crucial explaining antigenic variation plasmodium falciparum. recent work 
observed that while var genes produce transcripts, var genes
exhibit high expression levels. however, global regulation var expression 
and relationship epigenetic genetic control remains be
established.
result: systematically reanalyzed existing genomic data including
chromatin configurations gene expressions; first time used robust
statistical methods show intron 2 kb upstream regions each
endogenous var gene always maintain high chromatin accessibility, high
potential bind transcription factors (tfs). levels transcripts for
different var gene family members associated chromatin
accessibility. given var gene thus shows punctuated chromatin states
throughout asexual life cycle. demonstrated three independent
transcript datasets. chromatin accessibility var intron 2 kb upstream 
regions also positively correlated gc content, suggesting the
level var genes silencing might encoded intron sequences.
interestingly, var intron 2 kb upstream regions exhibit higher chromatin
accessibility genes relatively lower transcription levels,
suggesting punctuated repressive function regulatory elements.
conclusion: integrating analyzing epigenomic, genomic transcriptomic
data, work reveals novel distal element var control. found dynamic
modulations specific epigenetic marks around var intron distal
upstream regions involved general var gene expression patterns in
malarial antigenic variation.
