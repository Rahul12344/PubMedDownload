background: recent years, genus asaia (rhodospirillales: acetobacteraceae)
has isolated different anopheles species presented promising
tool combat malaria. bacterium unique features presence in
different organs mosquitoes (midgut, salivary glands reproductive organs) 
of female male mosquitoes vertical horizontal transmission. these
specifications lead possibility introducing asaia robust candidate
for malaria vector control via paratransgenesis technology. several studies 
been performed microbiota anopheles mosquitoes (diptera: culicidae) 
iran middle east find suitable candidate controlling malaria
based paratransgenesis approaches. present study first report of
isolation, biochemical molecular characterization genus asaia within
five different anopheles species originated different zoogeographical 
zones south, east, north iran.
methods: mosquitoes originated field-collected laboratory-reared
colonies five anopheles spp. adult mosquitoes anesthetized; midguts
were isolated dissection, followed grinding midgut contents 
then cultured enrichment broth media later caco3 agar plates
separately. morphological, biochemical physiological characterization were
carried appearance colonies. molecular confirmation,
selected colonies cultured, dnas extracted pcr performed 
on 16s ribosomal rna gene using specific newly designed primers.
results: morphological, biochemical, physiological molecular results
indicated isolates members genus asaia.
conclusions: contrary previous opinions, findings show asaia bacteria
are present insectary-reared colonies field-collected mosquitoes 
can isolated simple specific methods. furthermore, respect 
fact isolated asaia within different anopheles specimens from
distinct climatic zoogeographical regions, promising may be
concluded species genus tolerate complicated environmental
conditions vector-borne diseases endemic regions. therefore, be
considered promising target paratransgenesis vector control programs.
however, suggest introducing new technologies next generation
sequencing robust silico approaches may pave way find unique
biomarker rapid reliable differentiation asaia species.
