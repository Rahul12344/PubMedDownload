background: understanding geographical distribution drug resistance of
plasmodium falciparum important effective treatment malaria. drug
resistance previously inferred mainly records clinical
resistance. however, clinical resistance always consistent the
parasite's genetic resistance. thus, molecular identification parasite's
drug resistance required. africa, clinical resistance pyrimethamine
(pyr) chloroquine (cq) evident 1980 studies investigating 
the genetic resistance drugs conducted late 1990s. in
this study, genotyping genes involved resistance pyr cq was
performed using archive blood samples africa 1984 1998.
methods: parasite dna extracted p. falciparum-infected blood smears
collected travellers returning japan africa 1984 1998.
genotypes dihydrofolate reductase gene (dhfr) cq-resistance
transporter gene (pfcrt) determined polymerase chain reaction
amplification sequencing.
results: genotyping dhfr pfcrt successful 59 80 samples,
respectively. one wild-type seven mutant dhfr genotypes identified.
three dhfr genotypes lacking s108n mutation (nrsi, icsi, irsi; amino acids at
positions 51, 59, 108, 164 mutations underlined) highly prevalent
before 1994 reduced 1995, accompanied increase genotypes 
the s108n mutation. dhfr irni genotype first identified nigeria in
1991 present samples, frequency gradually increased. however, two 
double mutants (icni nrni), latter exclusively found west
africa, frequent irni genotype. two pfcrt genotypes 
found, wild-type southeast asian type (cviet; amino acids positions 
72-76 mutations underlined). cviet genotype already present early
as 1984 tanzania nigeria, appeared throughout africa 1984 
1998.
conclusions: study first report molecular identification of
pyr- cq-resistant genotypes p. falciparum africa 1990.
genotyping dhfr pfcrt using archive samples revealed new aspects of
the evolutionary history pyr- cq-resistant parasites africa.
