background: evolutionary pressure plasmodium falciparum malaria known to
have favoured large number human gene adaptations, surprisingly
little investigation effect malaria human mitochondrial sequence
variation. plasmodium falciparum infection cause severe malaria anaemia (sma)
with insufficient tissue oxygenation, lactic acidosis death. despite equal
degrees severe anaemia, individuals develop lactic acidosis others 
do not. case-control study design used investigate whether differences
in host mitochondrial gene sequences associated lactic acidosis sma.
full mitochondrial sequences obtained 36 subjects sma complicated 
by lactic acidosis 37 subjects sma without lactic acidosis. two
groups matched age, sex, degree anaemia.
results: compared reference sequence, median 60 nucleotide variants
per individual (interquartile range 4-91) found, average frequency of
3.97 variants per 1000 nucleotides. frequency distribution of
non-synonymous dna variants genes associated oxidative phosphorylation
were statistically different two groups. non-synonymous variants 
predicted disruptive effect proteins responsible for
oxidative phosphorylation present similar frequency groups.
conclusions: lactic acidosis sma appear consistently associated
with high prevalence mitochondrial gene variant.
