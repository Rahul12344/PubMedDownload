plasmodium vivax p. cynomolgi produce numerous caveola-vesicle complex (cvc) 
structures within surface infected erythrocyte membrane. these
contrast electron-dense knob protrusions expressed surface of
plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes. investigate the
three-dimensional (3-d) structure cvcs identity predominantly
expressed 95 kda cvc protein. liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry
analysis immunoprecipitates monoclonal antibodies p. cynomolgi
extracts identified protein member plasmodium helical
interspersed subtelomeric (phist) superfamily calculated mass 81 kda.
we named orthologous proteins pvphist/cvc-81(95) pcyphist/cvc-81(95) ,
analysed structural features, including pexel motif, repeated sequences
and c-terminal phist domain, show phist/cvc-81(95) highly
expressed trophozoites. generated images cvcs 3-d using electron
tomography (et), used immuno-et show phist/cvc-81(95) localizes the
cytoplasmic side cvc tubular extensions. targeted gene disruptions were
attempted vivo. pcyphist/cvc-81(95) gene disrupted, parasites 
containing episomes tgdhfr selection cassette retrieved by
selection pyrimethamine. suggests phist/cvc-81(95) essential
for survival malaria parasites.
