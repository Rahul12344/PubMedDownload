background: national treatment guidelines nepal adopted artemisinin
combination therapies (acts) treatment uncomplicated falciparum
malaria since 2004. emergence artemisinin resistance greater mekong
sub-region (gms) beyond may become threat nepal well. main
objective study assess therapeutic efficacy antimalarial
drug artemether-lumefantrine uncomplicated p. falciparum infected patients 
health centers/hospitals treated period 2 years (2013-2014).
methods: giemsa stained thick thin smears, prepared uncomplicated
falciparum malaria patients visited selected sentinel sites nepal
during 2013 2014 met inclusion criteria included parasitemia
(1000-10,000 /μl blood), evaluated 28 days acts treatment,
following world health organization (who) therapeutic efficacy protocol. based 
on re-occurrence fever resurge parasitemia, study patients were
classified resistant susceptible. blood specimens filter papers were
further analyzed polymerase chain reaction (pcr), specifically k13
propeller gene mutation (a recently identified molecular marker act
resistance).
results: total 56,013 suspected malaria cases screened study. 
of which, 120 (0.21%) infected falciparum malaria. 120, 28 cases
of p. falciparum (28/120; 23.33%) enrolled study, 24 cases
completed post-treatment follow 28 days. one case 24 (4%) 
was identified late treatment failure (ltf). k13 mutation, proxy indicator
for act resistance parasites, detected day 1, indicates
resistance yet reached molecular level.
conclusion: one case late treatment failure identified study.
act combination using artemether-lumefantrine still effective the
treatment uncomplicated falciparum malaria nepal. close monitoring and
supervision act resistance essential future malaria treatment in
nepal.
