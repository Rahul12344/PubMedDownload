malaria caused plasmodium species, whose transmission vertebrate hosts
is facilitated mosquito vectors. transition cold blooded mosquito
vector host represents physiological stress parasite, and
additionally malaria blood stage infection characterised intense fever
periods. recent years, become clear heat shock proteins play an
essential role parasite's life cycle. plasmodium falciparum expresses 
two prominent heat shock proteins: heat shock protein 70 (pfhsp70) heat shock
protein 90 (pfhsp90). proteins implicated the
development pathogenesis malaria. eukaryotes, hsp70 hsp90 proteins 
are functionally linked essential adaptor protein known hsp70-hsp90 
organising protein (hop). study, recombinant p. falciparum hop (pfhop)
was heterologously produced e. coli purified nickel affinity
chromatography. using specific anti-pfhop antisera, expression and
localisation pfhop p. falciparum investigated. pfhop shown to
co-localise pfhsp70 pfhsp90 parasites trophozoite stage. gel
filtration co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggested pfhop was
present complex together pfhsp70 pfhsp90. association pfhop 
with pfhsp70 pfhsp90 suggests protein may mediate the
functional interaction two chaperones.
