background: plasmodium parasites need cross midgut salivary gland
epithelia complete life cycle mosquito. however, our
understanding molecular mechanism mosquito genes participate 
in process still limited.
methodology/principal findings: identified anopheles gambiae epithelial
serine protease (agesp) constitutively expressed submicrovillar
region mosquito midgut epithelial cells basal side salivary 
glands critical plasmodium parasites cross two epithelial
barriers. agesp silencing greatly reduces plasmodium berghei plasmodium
falciparum midgut invasion prevents transcriptional activation of
gelsolin, key regulator actin remodeling reported plasmodium agonist. 
agesp expression highly induced midgut cells invaded plasmodium,
suggesting protease also participates apoptotic response to
invasion. salivary gland epithelial cells, agesp localized basal
side--the surface sporozoites interact. agesp expression the
salivary gland also induced response p. berghei p. falciparum
sporozoite invasion, agesp silencing significantly reduces number of
sporozoites invade organ.
conclusion: findings indicate agesp required plasmodium parasites
to effectively traverse midgut salivary gland epithelial barriers.
plasmodium parasites need modify actin cytoskeleton mosquito epithelial
cells successfully complete life cycle mosquito agesp appears
to major player regulation process.
