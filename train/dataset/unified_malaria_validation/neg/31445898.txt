molecular taxonomy based identification species form dna barcodes
are extensively used evolutionary systematics. almost dna barcodes
contain detailed information barcoding gene along uninformative
sequences particular species. therefore, technique highly essential 
remove reduce number uninformative sequences ought create
species-specific barcodes differentiation. actual variation genetic
sequences, called single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) genotyping, be
utilized develop new tool rapid, reliable, high-throughput assay 
distinguish known species. snps act important hereditary markers for
uncovering evolutionary history normal genetic polymorphisms. keeping 
mind, propose decision tree-based barcoding (dtb) algorithm generating
snp barcodes dna barcoding sequence several evolutionarily related
species accurately identify single species. address issue, we
analyzed mitochondrial coi gene sequences 64 species anopheles mosquitoes. 
after alignment truncating, 32 snps discovered coi gene sequences 
anopheles mosquitoes computed set decision rule for
constructing decision tree. decision tree based barcoding algorithm
generates 126 nodes 32 loci discriminating 64 anopheles mosquito species.
finally, concluded dtb method useful effective generating 
sequence tags anopheles mosquito species identification.
