the african malaria vector, anopheles gambiae, characterized multiple
polymorphic chromosomal inversions become widely studied system 
exploring models speciation. near complete reproductive isolation between
different inversion types, known chromosomal forms, led suggestion 
that a. gambiae early stages speciation, divergence evolving the
face considerable gene flow. compared standard chromosomal arrangement 
(savanna form) genomes homozygous j, b, c, u inversions (bamako
form) order identify regions genomic divergence respect to
inversion polymorphism. found levels divergence two sub-taxa
within inversions (2rj 2rb), level lower expected
and confined near inversion breakpoints, consistent gene flux model.
unexpectedly, found majority diverged regions located 
x chromosome, contained half significantly diverged regions, with
much divergence located within exons. surprising given the
bamako savanna chromosomal forms within molecular form is
defined locus near centromere x chromosome. two x-linked genes (a heat
shock protein p450 encoding genes) involved reproductive isolation between
the molecular forms a. gambiae also significantly diverged
between two chromosomal forms. results suggest genes mediating
reproductive isolation likely located x chromosome, thought to
be case molecular forms. conclude genes located on
the sex chromosome may major force driving speciation these
chromosomal forms a. gambiae.
