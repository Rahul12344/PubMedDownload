typical multicopper oxidases (mcos) ten conserved histidines one
conserved cysteine coordinate four copper atoms. copper ions are
required oxidase activity. studies insect mcos, discovered a
gene named multicopper oxidase-related protein (mcorp). mcorps share
sequence similarity mcos, lack many copper-coordinating residues.
we identified mcorp orthologs many insect species, other
invertebrates vertebrates. predicted mcorps would lack oxidase
activity due absence copper-coordinating residues. test this
prediction, purified recombinant tribolium castaneum (red flour beetle) mcorp 
and analyzed enzymatic activity using variety substrates. expected,
no oxidase activity detected. study mcorp function vivo, analyzed
expression profiles tcmcorp anopheles gambiae (african malaria mosquito)
mcorp, assessed rnai-mediated knockdown phenotypes. found mcorps
are constitutively expressed low level tissues analyzed.
injection tcmcorp dsrna larvae resulted 100% mortality prior adult 
eclosion, death occurring mainly pharate pupal stage late
pharate adult stage. injection tcmcorp dsrna pharate pupae resulted in
the death approximately 20% treated insects pupal adult
transition greatly shortened life span remaining insects. in
addition, knockdown tcmcorp females prevented oocyte maturation and, thus, 
greatly decreased number eggs laid. results indicate tcmcorp is
an essential gene function required reproduction. an
understanding role mcorp plays insect physiology may help develop
new strategies controlling insect pests.
