plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1), expressed p.
falciparum-infected erythrocytes, major family clonally variant targets
of naturally acquired immunity malaria. previous studies demonstrated
that areas malaria endemic, antibodies infected erythrocytes 
children severe malaria tend seroprevalent antibodies to
infected erythrocytes children nonsevere malaria. data led
to working hypothesis pfemp1 variants associated parasite virulence
are relatively conserved structure. however, longevity such
serologically conserved variants parasite population unknown. here,
using infected erythrocytes recently sampled clinical p. falciparum samples,
we measured serological conservation using pools antibodies sera had
been sampled 10 12 years earlier. serological conservation infected
erythrocytes strongly correlated expression specific pfemp1 subsets
previously found associated severe malaria. however, found no
association serological conservation per se disease severity within
these data. contrasts simple hypothesis p. falciparum isolates
with serologically conserved group pfemp1 variants cause severe malaria. the
data instead consistent periodic turnover immunodominant epitopes
of pfemp1 associated severe malaria.
