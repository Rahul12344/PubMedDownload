background: plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase
(pfdhfr-ts) well-defined target anti-malarial drug, pyrimethamine
and cycloguanil. emergence malaria parasites resistant drugs been
shown associated point mutations gene coding target
enzymes. although 3d-structure p. falciparum bifunctional pfdhfr-ts has
been reported previously, relatively little known interactions
between pfdhfr pfts domains roles junctional region that
links two domains together. therefore, thorough understanding the
interaction two domains role junctional region this
target important knowledge could assist development new
effective anti-malarial drugs aimed overcoming drug-resistant malaria.
methods: system developed investigate interaction pfdhfr and
pfts domains role junctional region activity the
recombinant pfts. based ability co-transformed plasmids coding for
pfdhfr pfts truncated junctional region complement growth of
ts-deficient escherichia coli strain χ2913reca(de3) minimum media without
thymidine supplementation, active pfts mutants minimal length junctional 
region identified. interactions active pfdhfr pfts domains
were demonstrated using bacterial two-hybrid system.
results: using ts-deficient e. coli strain χ2913reca(de3), authors shown
for first time p. falciparum junctional region least 44 amino
acids longer necessary pfts domain active synthesis 
of thymidylate cells. truncation junctional region the
bifunctional pfdhfr-ts confirmed results, suggested 
critical length junctional peptide pfdhfr-ts would essential the
activity ts catalyze synthesis thymidylate.
conclusion: present study demonstrated interactions pfdhfr
and pfts domains bifunctional pfdhfr-ts, revealed junctional 
region linking two protein domains essential expression of
catalytically active pfts domain. findings could useful since inhibition
of pfdhfr-ts domain-domain interaction could form basis development
of new anti-malarial drugs based targeting non-active site region 
important enzyme.
