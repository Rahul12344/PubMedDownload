malaria parasites modify human host cell, mature erythrocyte. this
modification mediated large number parasite proteins exported
to host cell, also underlying cause pathology caused by
malaria infection. amongst proteins many hsp40 co-chaperones, a
single hsp70. proteins implicated several processes the
host cell, including potential role protein transport, however further
molecular players process remain obscure. address this, have
utilized chemical cross-linking followed mass spectrometry immunoblotting 
to isolate characterize proteins complexes containing exported hsp40
(pfe55), known exported hsp70 (pfhsp70x). data reveal 
of proteins contained high molecular weight protein complexes. these
complexes found infected erythrocyte, within the
parasite-derived compartment referred parasitophorous vacuole.
surprisingly, data also reveal association pfhsp70x components 
ptex, putative protein translocon within membrane parasitophorous
vacuole. results suggest p. falciparum- infected human erythrocyte
contains numerous high molecular weight protein complexes, may potentially 
be involved host cell modification.
