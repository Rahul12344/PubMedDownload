malaria parasites induce complex cellular clinical phenotypes, including
anemia, cerebral malaria death wide range mammalian hosts. host genes
and parasite 'toxins' implicated malarial disease, the
contribution parasite genes remains fully defined. assess
disease balb/c mice wistar rats infected rodent malaria parasite
plasmodium berghei gene knock merozoite surface protein (msp) 7.
msp7 essential infection p. falciparum, enhances erythrocyte
invasion 20%. vivo, compared wild type, p. berghei δmsp7 mutant
is associated abrogation death decrease 3% 2% peak,
circulating parasitemia. δmsp7 mutant also associated less anemia and
modest increase size follicles spleen. together data show 
that deletion single parasite invasion ligand modulates blood stage disease,
as measured death anemia. work first assess the
contribution gene present plasmodial species severe disease.
