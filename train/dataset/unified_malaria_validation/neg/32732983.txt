plasmodium falciparum causes severe form malaria humans. the
adhesion infected erythrocytes (ies) endothelial receptors
(sequestration) uninfected erythrocytes (rosetting) considered major
elements pathogenesis disease. sequestration rosetting
appear involve particular members several ie variant surface antigens
(vsas) ligands, interacting multiple vascular host receptors, including
the abo blood group antigens. study, subjected genetically distinct p.
falciparum parasites vitro selection increased ie adhesion abo
antigens absence potentially confounding receptors. selection
resulted ies adhered stronger pure abo antigens, erythrocytes, 
to various human cell lines unselected counterparts. however,
selection result marked qualitative changes transcript levels of
the genes encoding best-described vsa families, pfemp1 rifin. rather,
overall transcription gene families tended decline following
selection. furthermore, selection-induced increases adhesion abo
occurred absence marked changes immune igg recognition ie surface
antigens, generally assumed target mainly vsas. study sheds new light on
our understanding processes molecules involved ie sequestration and
rosetting.
