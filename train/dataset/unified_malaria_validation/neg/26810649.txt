lysine acetylation critical posttranslational modification influences
protein activity, stability, binding properties. acetylation histone
proteins particular well-characterized feature gene expression
regulation. protozoan parasitetoxoplasma gondii, number lysine
acetyltransferases (kats) contribute gene expression essential for
parasite viability. natural product garcinol recently reported inhibit
enzymatic activities gcn5 p300 family kats species. show 
that garcinol inhibits tggcn5b, nuclear gcn5 family kat known be
required fortoxoplasmatachyzoite replication. treatment tachyzoites with
garcinol led reduction global lysine acetylation, particularly histone
h3 tggcn5b itself. also performed transcriptome sequencing (rna-seq),
which revealed increasing aberrant gene expression coincident increasing
concentrations garcinol. majority genes most
significantly affected garcinol also associated tggcn5b a
previously reported chromatin immunoprecipitation assay microarray
technology (chip-chip) analysis. dysregulated gene expression induced by
garcinol significantly inhibitstoxoplasmatachyzoite replication, the
concentrations used exhibit overt toxicity human host cells. garcinol also 
inhibitsplasmodium falciparumasexual replication 50% inhibitory
concentration (ic50) similar fortoxoplasma together, data support
that pharmacological inhibition tggcn5b leads catastrophic failure in
gene expression control prevents parasite replication.
