plasmodium toxoplasma genera apicomplexan parasites infect
millions people year. former causes malaria, latter causes
neurotropic infections associated weakened developing immune system.
these parasites harbor peculiar organelle, apicoplast. apicoplast is
the product ancient endosymbiosis heterotrophic a
photosynthetic protist. explore cellular molecular mechanisms that
enabled stable union two previously independent organisms. include the
exchange metabolites, transfer genes, transport proteins, overall
coordination biogenesis proliferation. mechanisms still active
today exploited treat parasite infection. shaped the
dramatic changes occurred evolution phylum
apicomplexa--including gain loss photosynthesis, adaptation to
symbiosis parasitism, explosion animal diversity-that ultimately
provided aquatic alga access every biotope planet.
