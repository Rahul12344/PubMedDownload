arthropod-borne infectious diseases responsible nearly 1.5 million deaths
annually across globe, malaria responsible >50% deaths.
recent efforts enhance malaria control focused developing genetically 
modified anopheles mosquitoes resistant malaria parasite infection by
manipulating proteins essential immune response. although this
approach shown promise, lack efficient genetic tools mosquito
makes difficult investigate innate immunity using reverse genetics. current
gene knockdown strategies based small interfering rna typically
labourious, inefficient, require extensive training. present study, we
describe use morpholino antisense oligomers knockdown mek-erk
signalling midgut anopheles stephensi simple feeding
protocol. anti-mek morpholino provided saline meal readily ingested by
female mosquitoes minimal toxicity resulted knockdown total mek
protein levels 3-4 days morpholino feeding. further, anti-mek morpholino
feeding attenuated inducible phosphorylation downstream kinase erk and, as
predicted previous work, reduced parasite burden mosquitoes infected with
plasmodium falciparum. knowledge, first example morpholino 
use target protein knockdown via feeding insect vector. results
suggest method efficient studies individual proteins, but
also studies phenotypic control complex cell signalling networks. as
such, protocol effective alternative current methods gene
knockdown arthropods.
