the variable number tandem repeats (vntrs) provides valuable information about
both functional evolutionary aspects genetic diversity. comparative
analysis 3 plasmodium falciparum genomes shown 9% its
open reading frames (orfs) harbor vntrs. although microsatellites vntr genes 
of p. vivax reported, vntr polymorphism genes examined
widely. study, 230 p. vivax genes analyzed vntrs serv, 33
kinds tr deletions insertions 29 p. vivax genes (12.6%) found. of
these, 9 vntr fragments 8 p. vivax genes used pcr amplification and
sequence analysis examine genetic diversity among 134 isolates four
southeast asian countries (china, republic korea, thailand, myanmar) 
different malaria endemicity. confirmed existence extensive
polymorphism vntr fragments field isolates. detection provides several
suitable markers analysis molecular epidemiology p. vivax field
isolates.
