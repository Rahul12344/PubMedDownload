vector control one major global strategies control malaria.
however, major obstacle vector control development multiple
resistances organochlorine, organophosphorus insecticides pyrethroids that
are currently used public health spraying bednets. salivary
glands vectors first target organ human-vector contact during
biting parasite-vector contact prior parasite development mosquito 
midguts. salivary glands secrete anti-haemostatic, anti-inflammatory
biologically active molecules facilitate blood feeding host also 
inadvertently inject malaria parasites vertebrate host. anopheles
stephensi mosquito, urban vector malaria human rodent species
has identified reference laboratory model study mosquito-parasite
interactions. study, adopted conventional proteomic approach of
2d-electrophoresis coupled maldi-tof mass spectrometry bioinformatics to
identify putative differentially expressed annotated functional salivary proteins
between an. stephensi susceptible multiresistant strains genetic
background. results show 2d gel profile maldi-tof comparisons that
identified 31 differentially expressed putative modulated proteins in
deltamethrin/ddt resistant strains an. stephensi. among 15 proteins were
found upregulated 16 proteins downregulated. studies interpret
that an. stephensi (multiresistant) caused upregulated expression proteins 
and enzymes like cytochrome 450, short chain dehyrdogenase reductase,
phosphodiesterase etc may impact insecticide resistance and
xenobiotic detoxification. study elucidates proteomic response salivary 
glands differentially regulated proteins response insecticide resistance
development include structural, redox regulatory enzymes several
pathways. identified proteins may play role regulating mosquito biting
behavior patterns may implications development malaria
parasites resistant mosquitoes parasite transmission.
