phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase c (pi-plc) major regulator of
calcium-dependent signal transduction, shown important in
various processes malaria parasite plasmodium. pi-plc generally
implicated calcium liberation intracellular stores action 
its product, inositol-(1,4,5)-trisphosphate, dependent calcium
for activation. describe plc genes plasmodium species. the
encoded proteins contain domains typically found pi-plcs δ class
but almost twice long orthologues mammals. transcriptional
analysis qrt-pcr plc erythrocytic cycle p. falciparum
revealed steady expression levels increased late schizont stages.
genetic analysis p. berghei model revealed plc locus was
targetable plc gene knock-outs could obtained, thereby strongly
indicating gene essential blood stage development.
alternatively, attempted modify plc expression promoter exchange 
approach found gene refractory over-expression indicating that
plc expression levels might additionally tightly controlled.
