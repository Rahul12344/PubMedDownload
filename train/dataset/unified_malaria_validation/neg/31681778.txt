background: artemisia annua chinese medicinal herb. artemisinin-derivatives 
are recommended part combination treatment uncomplicated malaria.
herbal dietary supplements (hds) increasingly used worldwide and
hds-induced liver injury becoming growing concern. case report: present
the first case severe acute cholestatic hepatitis due intake of
artemisia annua tea chemoprophylaxis malaria patient returning from
ethiopia. patients presented jaundice, elevated transaminases, and
parameters cholestasis (total bilirubin 186.6 μmol/l, conjugated bilirubin
168.5 μmol/l). liver biopsy showed portal hepatitis lymphocytic
infiltration bile ducts diffuse intra-canalicular and
intra-cytoplasmic bilirubinostasis. toxicologic analysis artemisia tea
revealed ingredients arteannuin b, deoxyartemisin, campher, scopoletin.
there identifiable etiologies liver disease. roussel uclaf
causality assessment method (rucam) score assessed "probably" causal
relationship. sequencing genes encoding hepatic transporters bile acid
homeostasis (bsep, mdr3, fic1) found genetic variants typically associated
with hereditary cholestasis syndromes. normalization bilirubin occurred 3
months onset disease. conclusion: use artemisinin-derivatives
for malaria prevention ineffective potentially harmful thus 
discouraged. moreover, case demonstrates yet inadequate understanding 
of pathophysiology susceptibility hds induced liver injury.
