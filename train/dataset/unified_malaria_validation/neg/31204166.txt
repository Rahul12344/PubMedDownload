monitoring antimalarial resistance important prevent spread,
but available options assessing resistance less ideal field 
settings. although molecular detection perhaps efficient method, it
is also complex requires dna extraction pcr
instrumentation. develop deployable approach, designed new probes,
which, used combination inhibitor-tolerant taq polymerase, enable
single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping directly whole blood. probes
feature two strategic design elements: locked nucleic acids enhance
specificity reporter dyes cy5 tex615, less optical overlap
with blood absorbance spectra commonly used dyes. probe
performance validated traditional laboratory-based instrument then
further tested field-deployable adaptive pcr instrument develop a
point-of-care platform appropriate use malaria settings. probes
discriminated wild-type plasmodium falciparum the
chloroquine-resistant crt pf3d7_0709000:c.227a>c (p.lys76thr) mutant the
presence 2% blood. additionally, allelic discrimination plots new 
probes, samples clustered closely respective axes compared with
samples using minor groove binder probes 6-fam vic reporter dyes. our
strategy greatly simplifies single-nucleotide polymorphism detection provides
a accessible alternative antimalarial resistance surveillance the
field.
