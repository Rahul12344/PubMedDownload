background: insect cuticle protects environmental stresses as
insecticides, physical injury, dehydration pathogenic microorganisms.
structural cuticular proteins (cps) primary components cuticle,
and interest physiology-based pest management methods. anopheles
sinensis cps poorly characterised present, therefore performed
whole-genome sequence analysis re-analysed available transcriptome data to
identify potential insecticide resistance-associated cps.
results: genome analysis revealed 238 putative cps belonging 11 different
families; 136 proteins possessing rebers riddiford motif (cpr), 12 cps
analogous peritrophins single chitin-binding domain (cpap1), eight cps 
analogous peritrophins three chitin-binding domains (cpap3), four
proteins 44 amino acid motif (cpf), five cpf-like (cpfl) proteins, nine
tweedle proteins, three proteins low complexity alanine residues (cplca),
26 proteins low complexity conserved glycine residues (cplcg), seven
proteins low complexity invariant w residues (cplcw), 27 proteins low 
complexity proline residues (cplcp), one protein two three
copies c-x -c motif (cpcfc). two cps belonging cpr cpap3 families
were over-expressed deltamethrin-resistant strain.
conclusion: results establish information framework an. sinensis cps
that provides basis molecular research. © 2017 society chemical
