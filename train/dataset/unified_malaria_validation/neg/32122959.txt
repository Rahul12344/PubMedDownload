innovative tools essential advancing malaria control depend an
understanding molecular mechanisms governing transmission malaria parasites
by anopheles mosquitoes. crispr/cas9-based gene disruption powerful method
to uncover underlying biology vector-pathogen interactions form
the basis mosquito control strategies. however, embryo injection methods used 
to genetically manipulate mosquitoes (especially anopheles) difficult and
inefficient, particularly non-specialist laboratories. here, adapted the
remot control (receptor-mediated ovary transduction cargo) technique to
deliver cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex adult mosquito ovaries, generating
targeted heritable mutations malaria vector anopheles stephensi
without injecting embryos. anopheles, remot control gene editing as
efficient standard embryo injections. application remot control to
anopheles opens power crispr/cas9 methods malaria laboratories that
lack equipment expertise perform embryo injections establishes 
flexibility remot control diverse mosquito species.
