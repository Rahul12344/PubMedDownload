background: prevention malaria faces repeated emergence of
plasmodium falciparum resistance drugs, often involving point mutations the
target gene. pregnant woman, currently recommendation the
administration intermittent preventive treatment (iptp) with
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine. sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) resistance has
increased several years africa, stressing need alternative
molecules. context, first randomized clinical trial comparing the
efficacy sp mefloquine iptp conducted recently benin.
using samples trial, current study evaluated quantified the
prevalence mutations pfdhfr pfdhps genes well copy number
of pfmdr1 gene parasites p. falciparum-infected pregnant women before
first second iptp administration, delivery.
methods: pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism polymorphic codons of
the pfdhfr gene (51, 59, 108, 164) performed. identification of
mutations three codons pfdhps gene (436, 437 540) achieved by
pcr sequencing. copy number quantification pfmdr1 gene performed
using real-time pcr.
results: results show high prevalence rate mutant parasites women taking 
iptp sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine mefloquine. prevalence triple 
quadruple mutants high first drug regimen administration (79/93, 85%),
and remained similar delivery. infection mutant parasites not
correlated low birth weight placental infection. samples, the
copy number pfmdr1 gene equal one.
conclusions: clinical trial comparing sp mefloquine efficacy iptp 
showed sp remained efficacious preventing low birth weight. present study 
shows high prevalence triple quadruple mutations implicated sp
resistance. although pfdhfr/pfdhps triple quadruple mutations were
frequent, evidence correlation genotypes the
lack efficacy sp context iptp. nevertheless, obvious
that sp soon compromised whole africa. molecular markers been
recommended monitor sp efficacy iptp, given current prevalence 
mutant parasites usefulness questionable.
