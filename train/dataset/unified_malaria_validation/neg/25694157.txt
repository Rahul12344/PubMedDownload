drugs target folate-synthesis pathway long history of
effectiveness variety pathogens. antimalarials, antifolates
were safe well tolerated, resistance emerged quickly persisted
even decreased drug pressure. primary determinants resistance in
plasmodium falciparum well-described point mutations enzymes
dihydropteroate synthase dihydrofolate reductase targeted combination 
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. recent work highlighted contributions of
additional parasite adaptation antifolate resistance. fact, evolution
of antifolate-resistant parasites multifaceted complex. gene amplification
of first enzyme parasite folate synthesis pathway, gtp-cyclohydrolase,
is strongly associated resistant parasites potentially contributes to
persistence resistant parasites. understanding parasites adjust
flux folate pathway important development of
alternative agents targeting crucial synthesis pathway.
