background: artemisinin resistance plasmodium falciparum extends across
southeast asia associated worsening partner drug resistance 
a decline efficacy frontline artemisinin-based combination therapy.
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (dp) essential component preventive and
curative treatment region, therapeutic efficacy fallen in
cambodia.
methods: prospective clinical parasitological evaluation dp was
conducted two sites upper myanmar august 2013 december 2014,
enrolling 116 patients acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria. patients
received dp orally 3 days together primaquine 0.25 mg/kg admission.
parasite clearance half-lives based 6 hourly blood smears, day 42
therapeutic responses assessed well parasite k13 genotypes.
results: median parasite clearance half-life prolonged, clearance
half-life greater 5 h 21% patients. delayed parasite clearance was
significantly associated mutations propeller region parasite
k13 gene. k13 f446i mutation found 25.4% infections was
associated median clearance half-life 4.7 h compared 2.7 h for
infections without k13 mutations (p < 0.001). failures 42
days follow-up, although 18% patients persistent parasitaemia day 3.
conclusion: dominant k13 mutation observed upper myanmar, f446i, appears
to associated intermediate rate parasite clearance compared to
other common mutations described elsewhere greater mekong subregion.
discerning phenotype requires relatively detailed clearance measurements,
highlighting importance methodology assessing artemisinin resistance.
