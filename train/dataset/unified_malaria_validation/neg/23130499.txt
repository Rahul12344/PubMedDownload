objective: investigate genetic structure plasmodium vivax
circumsporozoite surface protein (pvcsp) p. vivax merozoite surface protein 1
(pvmsp1) genes field isolates malaria parasites four different
regions thailand.
material method: data collected cross-sectional survey, consisting
of 273 p. vivax infected blood samples malaria clinics 4 different border
regions thailand february 2008 february 2009. dried blood spots
were extracted dna plasmodium species confirmed species-specific
primer sets. pvcsp pvmsp1 genes amplified population genetics 
were analyzed using heterozygosity (h) formula, f-stat lian programs.
result: considerable variation pvmsp1 gene within 2 fragments
for 0.8303, whereas pvcsp showed low 0.1418. significant
differences allele frequencies sites quantified fst, linkage
disequilibrium (ld). results showed pvmsp1 f2; fst = 0.063, p = 0.07; pvmsp1 
f2 rflp pattern; fst = 0.154, p = 0.005; pvmsp1 f3; fst = 0.23, p = 0.005 the
overall loci showed fst = 0.151, p = 0.005 (fisher's exact test). values of
index association (i(s)a) non-significant. evidence ld
within p. vivax populations.
conclusion: h(e) locus pvmsp1 gene showed significant differences 
in allele frequencies sites.
