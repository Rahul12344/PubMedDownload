in order characterize demographic traits spatial structure of
cameroonians bulinus globosus, intermediate host schistosoma haematobium,
genetic structure seven different populations, collected tropical
zone, studied using six polymorphic microsatellites. intrapopulation genetic 
diversity ranged 0.37 0.55. interpopulation genetic diversity variation
clearly illustrated significant isolation due distance gene flow
substantially limited neighbouring populations. effective population sizes
(ne) relatively low (from 3.0 18.6), supposes high rate from
which populations would lose genetic diversity drift. analysis of
genetic temporal variability indicated fluctuations allelic frequencies (35 of
42 locus-population combinations, p<0.05) characteristic stochastic
demography, reinforced events bottlenecks detected all
populations. findings demonstrated cameroonian b. globosus were
mixed-maters populations showing clear preference outcrossing.
these data also suggest genetic drift gene flow main factors
shaping genetic structure studied populations.
