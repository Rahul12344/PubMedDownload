babesiosis become new global threat impacting human health, human 
babesiosis cases caused babesia microti. antigens b.
microti described used diagnosis human
babesiosis. present study, report bioinformatic analysis,
cloning expression sequence encoding b. microti seroreactive
antigen 5-1-1 investigate potential incorporation serologic diagnostic 
tools babesiosis. bioinformatic analysis recombinant gene expression were
performed molecularly characterize seroreactive antigen 5-1-1. enhanced
chemiluminescence (ecl)-western blot methods used detect specific
antibodies infected mice. immunofluorescence antibody assays (ifa) were
performed detect localization bmsa5-1-1 b. microti parasites. elisa 
and immunochromatographic (ict) tests developed using recombinant bmsa5-1-1 
to evaluate potential use rapid detection methods b. microti
antibodies diagnosis babesiosis. recombinant expression plasmid 
was constructed inserting target gene fragment pet28a vector 
double digestion bamhi xhoi restriction enzymes. recombinant
bmsa5-1-1 protein expressed escherichia coli (rbmsa5-1-1) purified 
means ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (nta) agarose columns. polyclonal antibodies
were generated rbmsa5-1-1. based indirect immunofluorescence assay
results, bmsa5-1-1 appeared localize surface b. microti. elisa tests
using rbmsa5-1-1 antigen detected specific antibodies infected mice as
early 4 days post-infection. results indicate two methods we
developed detect specific antibodies mice different stages infection
with sensitivities 100% (rbmsa5-1-1 elisa) 90% (ict). specificity of
the two methods 100%. sera patients suffering closely related
parasitic diseases, malaria toxoplasmosis, produced negative results.
in conclusion, seroreactive antigen 5-1-1, member bmn1 protein family,
is expressed outer surface b. microti promising candidate
antigen early diagnosis babesiosis. rbmsa5-1-1 elisa ict methods
show good potential detecting specific antibodies mice different stages
of infection.
