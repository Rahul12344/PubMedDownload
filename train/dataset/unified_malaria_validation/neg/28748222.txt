background: plasmodium cynomolgi, non-human primate malaria parasite species,
has important model parasite since discovery 1907. similarities in
the biology p. cynomolgi closely related, less tractable, human
malaria parasite p. vivax make model parasite choice liver biology 
and vaccine studies pertinent p. vivax malaria. molecular genome-scale
studies p. cynomolgi relied current reference genome sequence,
which remains highly fragmented 1,649 unassigned scaffolds little
representation subtelomeres.  methods: using long-read sequence data
(pacific biosciences smrt technology), assembled annotated new reference
genome sequence, pcym, sourced indian rhesus monkey. compare newly
assembled genome sequence several plasmodium species,
including re-annotated p. coatneyi assembly.
results: new pcym genome assembly significantly higher quality the
existing reference, comprising 56 pieces, gaps improved average
gene length. detailed manual curation ensured comprehensive annotation of
the genome 6,632 genes, nearly 1,000 previously attributed p.
cynomolgi. new assembly also improved representation the
subtelomeric regions, account nearly 40% sequence. within the
subtelomeres, identified 1300 plasmodium interspersed repeat ( pir) 
genes, well striking expansion 36 methyltransferase pseudogenes that
originated single copy chromosome 9.
conclusions: manually curated pcym reference genome sequence important 
new resource malaria research community. high quality contiguity 
of data enabled discovery novel expansion methyltransferase 
in subtelomeres, illustrates new comparative genomics capabilities
that unlocked complete reference genomes.
