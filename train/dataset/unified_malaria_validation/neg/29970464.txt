apicomplexa obligate intracellular parasites actively invade, replicate 
within, egress host cells. parasite actinomyosin-based molecular
motor complex (often referred glideosome) considered important
mediator parasite motility virulence. mature intracellular parasites often
become motile prior egress host cells, genera,
this motility important successful egress well subsequent
invasion new host cells. determine whether actinomyosin-based motility is
important red blood cell egress invasion activities malaria
parasite, used conditional genetic approach delete gap45, primary 
component glideosome, asexual blood stages plasmodium falciparum our
results confirm essential nature gap45 invasion show that
p. falciparum require functional motor complex undergo egress 
the red blood cell. malarial egress therefore differs fundamentally induced 
egress related apicomplexan toxoplasma gondiiimportance clinical malaria
results cycles replication single-celled parasites genus
plasmodium red blood cells. intracellular parasite replication followed 
a highly regulated, protease-dependent process called egress, rupture of
the bounding membranes allows explosive release daughter merozoites which
rapidly invade fresh red cells. parasite actinomyosin-based molecular motor
(the glideosome) proposed provide mechanical force drive
invasion. studies related parasite toxoplasma gondii shown that
induced egress requires parasite motility, mediated functional glideosome.
however, whether glideosome similar essential role egress malaria
merozoites red blood cells unknown. here, show although a
functional glideosome required red blood cell invasion plasmodium
falciparum merozoites, required egress. findings place
further emphasis key role protease cascade malarial egress.
