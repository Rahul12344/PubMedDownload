as result widespread resistance chloroquine (cq) and
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp), artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) 
been recommended first-line anti-malarial regimen côte d'ivoire since
2005. thorough understanding molecular bases p. falciparum resistance
to existing drugs therefore needed. aims study analyze the
in vitro sensitivity p. falciparum field isolates abobo cq,
pyronaridine (pyr) dihydroartemisinine (dha), investigate the
polymorphisms associated drug resistance. standard vitro drug
sensitivity microtechnique recommended used assess the
sensitivity plasmodium falciparum isolates collected december 2006. the
pfcrt haplotype 76 analysed pcr-rflp pfatpase 6 amplification
products sequenced. associations drug sensitivity parasite gene 
polymorphisms evaluated cohen's kappa test. correlation the
ic50 values different drugs assessed coefficient determination 
(r²). significance assumed p<0.05. 128 vitro tests performed, 112
(87.5%) successful. isolates, 56.2% resistant cq 48% for
pyr. one isolate (3.6%) demonstrated reduced dha sensitivity (ic50 higher 10
nm). mutant k76t pfcrt codon, present 90% dna fragments analyzed, was
associated cq-r (ĸ=0.76). n669y (16.1%), d734y (28.6%) d734h (1.8%) 
isolates found mutant pfatpase6, however, mutations not
associated diminished dha sensitivity (k=0.01). high levels of
antimalarial drug resistance abobo (côte d'ivoire) demand studies of
drug efficacy across whole country.
