immunological memory remarkable phenomenon survival initial
infection pathogen leads life-long protection disease upon
subsequent exposure pathogen. many infectious diseases,
long-lived protective humoral immunity induced single infection
in process depends generation memory b cells (mbcs) and
long-lived plasma cells. however, past decade become increasingly
evident many chronic human infectious diseases immunity not
readily established, including hiv-aids, malaria tb, associated with
fundamental alterations composition functionality mbc compartments.
a common feature diseases appears large expansion have
been termed exhausted b cells, tissue-like memory b cells atypical memory b
cells (ambcs) that, simplicity's sake, refer ambcs. been
suggested chronic immune activation inflammation drive expansion 
ambcs way ambcs contribute deficiencies acquisition of
immunity chronic infectious diseases. although ambcs heterogeneous both
within individuals diseases, several features common
including low expression cell surface markers define classical mbcs
in humans including cd21 cd27 high expression genes usually
expressed classical mbcs including t-bet, cd11c variety inhibitory
receptors, notably members fcrl family. another distinguishing feature 
their greatly diminished ability stimulated b cell receptors 
to proliferate, secrete cytokines produce antibodies. review, we
describe current understanding phenotypic markers ambcs, their
specificity relation disease-causing pathogen, functionality, the
drivers expansion chronic infections life span. briefly 
summarize features ambcs healthy individuals autoimmune disease.
we also comment possible relationship human ambcs t-bet+, cd11c+
