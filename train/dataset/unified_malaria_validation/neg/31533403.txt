artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) resistance widespread throughout
the greater mekong subregion. raises concern antimalarial treatment
in thailand since shares borders cambodia, laos, myanmar high
act failure rates reported. crucial information the
spread act resistance efficient planning treatment. study 
identify molecular markers antimalarial drug resistance: pfkelch13 and
pfmdr1 mutations 5 provinces southern thailand, 2012 2017, of
which 2 provinces thai- myanmar border (chumphon ranong), one on
thai-malaysia border (yala) 2 non-border provinces (phang nga surat 
thani). results showed c580y mutation pfkelch13 found mainly in
the province thai-myanmar border. mutations pfkelch13 gene 
found surat thani yala. pfmdr1 gene isolated thai-malaysia
border different pattern found areas (100% n86y)
whereas wild type strain present phang nga. study indicated the
molecular markers artemisinin resistance spread provinces
bordering along thai-myanmar, pattern pfmdr1 mutations the
areas along international border thailand differed the
non-border provinces. information molecular markers study
highlighted recent spread artemisinin resistant parasites endemic
area, data useful optimizing antimalarial treatment based 
regional differences.
