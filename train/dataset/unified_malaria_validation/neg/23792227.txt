insecticides organophosphate (op) pyrethroid (py) chemical families,
have respectively, use 50 30 years west africa, mainly against
agricultural pests, also vectors human disease. selection
pressure, practically molecules year year (mainly cotton),
has caused insecticide resistance pest populations bemisia tabaci,
vector harmful phytoviruses vegetables. evolution toward insecticide
resistance malaria vectors anopheles gambiae sensus lato (s.l.) is
probably related current use insecticides agriculture. thus,
successful pest vector control west africa requires investigation of
insect susceptibility, relation identification species sub
species, molecular forms biotypes. identification knock down
resistance (kdr) acetylcholinesterase gene (ace1) mutations modifying
insecticide targets individual insects measure enzymes activity
typically involved insecticide metabolism (oxidase, esterase and
glutathion-s-transferase) indispensable understanding mechanisms of
resistance. insecticide resistance good example genotype-phenotype 
links made successfully. insecticides used agriculture continue to
select new resistant populations b. tabaci could different
biotype vectors plant viruses. well, evolution insecticide
resistance an. gambiae threatens management malaria vectors west
africa. raises question priority use insecticides health
and/or agriculture, generally, question sustainability crop
protection vector control strategies region. here, review the
susceptibility tests, biochemical molecular assays data b. tabaci, a
major pest cotton vegetable crops, an. gambiae, main vector of
malaria. data reviewed collected benin burkina faso 2008
and 2010 corus 6015 research program. review aims show: (i) the
insecticide resistance b. tabaci well an. gambiae; (ii) due to
this, impact selection resistant populations malaria vector control 
strategies. measures could beneficial crop protection vector
control strategies west africa proposed.
