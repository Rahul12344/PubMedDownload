background: anopheles sinensis major vector malaria china. the
gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba)-gated chloride channel, encoded rdl
(resistant dieldrin) gene, important target insecticides widely 
varied structures. use various insecticides agriculture vector
control inevitably led development insecticide resistance, which
may reduce control effectiveness. therefore, important investigate
the presence distribution frequency resistance related mutation(s) 
an. sinensis rdl predict resistance withdrawn cyclodienes (e.g.
dieldrin) currently used insecticides, fipronil.
methods: two hundred forty adults an. sinensis collected nine
locations across guangxi zhuang autonomous region used. two fragments an.
sinensis rdl (asrdl) gene, covering putative insecticide resistance related
sites, sequenced respectively. haplotypes individual were
reconstructed phase2.1 software, confirmed clone sequencing. the
phylogenetic tree built using maximum-likelihood bayesian inference
methods. genealogical relations among different haplotypes also analysed
using network 5.0.
results: coding region asrdl gene 1674Â bp long, encoding protein 
557 amino acids. asrdl 98.0% amino acid identity anopheles
funestus, shared common structural features cys-loop ligand-gated ion
channels. three resistance-related amino acid substitutions (a296s, v327i and
t345s) detected nine populations an. sinensis guangxi, with
the 296s mutation abundant (77-100%), followed 345s (22-47%)
and 327i (8-60%). 38 asrdl haplotypes identified 240 individuals at
frequencies ranging 0.2 34.8%. genealogical analysis suggested multiple
origins 345s mutation asrdl.
conclusions: near fixation 296s mutation occurrence the
327i 345s mutations addition 296s, nine tested an. sinensis 
populations guangxi, strongly indicate risk multiple insecticide
resistance. haplotype diversity plus genetic heterogeneities the
geographical distribution, multiple origins asrdl alleles call a
location-customized strategy monitoring management insecticide
resistance.
