background: widespread emergence resistance pyrethroids major
threat gains made malaria control. monitor presence possible
emergence resistance variety insecticides used malaria
control rwanda, nationwide insecticide resistance surveys conducted in
2011 2013.
methods: larvae anopheles gambiae sensu lato mosquitoes collected 12
sentinel sites throughout rwanda. reared adults analysed for
knock-down mortality using insecticide test papers standard
diagnostic doses recommended insecticides. sub-sample tested
specimens analysed presence knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations.
results: total 14,311 mosquitoes tested sample 1406
specimens, 1165 (82.9%) identified anopheles arabiensis 241 (17.1%)
as anopheles gambiae sensu stricto. mortality results indicated significant
increase resistance lambda-cyhalothrin 2011 2013 83% the
sites, permethrin 25% sites, deltamethrin 25% sites ddt
in 50% sites. mosquitoes 83% sites showed full susceptibility 
to bendiocarb 17% sites suspected harbour resistance requires
further confirmation. resistance observed fenitrothion study
sites entire survey. kdr genotype results an. gambiae s.s.
showed 67 (50%) possessed susceptibility (ss) alleles, 35 (26.1%) 
32 (23.9%) mosquitoes heterozygous (rs) homozygous (rr) alleles,
respectively. 591 an. arabiensis genotyped, 425 (71.9%) possessed
homozygous (ss) alleles 158 (26.7%) 8 (1.4%) heterozygous (rs) 
homozygous (rr) alleles, respectively. metabolic resistance involving oxidase
enzymes also detected using synergist pbo.
conclusion: first nationwide study insecticide resistance in
malaria vectors rwanda. shows gradual increase insecticide
resistance pyrethroids (lambda-cyhalothrin, deltamethrin, permethrin) and
organochlorines (ddt) large presence target site insensitivity. the
results demonstrate need rwanda expand monitoring insecticide
resistance including metabolic resistance testing implement an
insecticide resistance management strategy sustain gains made malaria
control.
