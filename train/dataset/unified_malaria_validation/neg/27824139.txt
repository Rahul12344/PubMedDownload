adult females genus ixodes imbibe blood meals exceeding 100 times
their weight within 7‒9 days. period, ticks internalise
components host blood endocytic digest cells line tick midgut
epithelium. using rna-seq, aimed characterise midgut transcriptome
composition adult ixodes ricinus females early late phase of
engorgement. address specific adaptations haemoglobin-rich diet, we
compared midgut transcriptomes genetically homogenous female siblings fed 
either bovine blood haemoglobin-depleted serum. noted tick gut
transcriptomes subject substantial temporal-dependent expression changes
between day 3 day 8 feeding. contrast, number transcripts
significantly affected presence absence host red blood cells was
low. transcripts relevant processes associated blood-meal digestion
were analysed involvement selected encoded proteins tick midgut
physiology discussed. total 7215 novel sequences i. ricinus were
deposited public databases additional outcome study. results
broaden current knowledge tick digestive system may lead the
discovery potential molecular targets efficient tick control.
