background: doublesex gene controls somatic sexual differentiation many
metazoan species, including malaria mosquito anopheles gambiae dengue
and yellow fever vector aedes aegypti (diptera: culicidae). studied
dipteran dsx homologs, gene maintains functionality via evolutionarily
conserved protein domains sex-specific alternative splicing. upstream
factors regulate splicing dsx manner however 
remain variable even among closely related organisms. induction sex
ratio biases central mode action many emerging molecular insecticides,
it imperative elucidate much sex determination pathway as
possible mosquito disease vectors.
results: report full-length gene sequence doublesex gene in
culex quinquefasciatus (cxqdsx) male female-specific isoforms. cxqdsx
maintains characteristics possibly derived culicinae present the
aedes aegypti dsx gene (aeadsx) gain exon 3b presence rbp1 
cis-regulatory binding sites, also retains presumably ancestral attributes
present anopheles gambiae maintenance singular female-specific
exon 5. unlike aedes aegypti, find evidence intron gain the
female transcript(s), yet recover second female isoform generated via selection
of alternate splice donor. utilizing next-gen sequence (ngs) data, complete
the aeadsx gene model identify putative core promoter region aeadsx
and cxqdsx. also utilizing ngs data, construct full-length gene sequence for
the dsx homolog northern house mosquito culex pipiens form pipiens
(cxpipdsx). analysis peptide evolutionary rates cxqdsx cxpipdsx
(both members culex pipiens complex) shows male-specific portion of
the transcript evolved rapidly respect female-specific common
regions.
conclusions: studied insects, doublesex maintains sex-specific
splicing conserved doublesex/mab-3 domains mosquitoes culex
quinquefasciatus cx. pipiens. cis-regulated splicing cxqdsx not
appear follow either currently described mosquito model (for an. gambiae and
ae. aegypti); three mosquito genera exhibit evidence unique
cis-regulatory mechanisms. male-specific dsx terminus exhibits rapid peptide 
evolutionary rates, even among closely related sibling species.
