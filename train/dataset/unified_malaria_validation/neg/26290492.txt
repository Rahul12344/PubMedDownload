α(+)-thalassemia (α(+)-thal) common southern china. high frequency
could due dominant selection malaria. two molecular mechanisms
that produce α(+)-thal defined; one results -α(3.7) (rightward) 
deletion reciprocal ααα(anti 3.7) triplication, one results 
the -α(4.2) (leftward) deletion reciprocal ααα(anti 4.2) triplication.
considering de novo event produced chromosome α gene deletion
and chromosome α triplication, favorable allele, one
would expected find allelic frequencies. found favorable
selection -α(3.7) deletion chinese population, also found
that α triplication rare first thought, especially the
ααα(anti 3.7) triplication.
