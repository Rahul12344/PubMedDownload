background:  plasmodium infection depletes arginine, substrate nitric
oxide synthesis, impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation. increased
conversion arginine ornithine parasites host arginase proposed
mechanism arginine depletion.
methods:  we used high-performance liquid chromatography measure plasma
arginine, ornithine, citrulline levels malawian children cerebral
malaria mice infected plasmodium berghei anka without the
arginase gene. heavy isotope-labeled tracers measured quadrupole
time-of-flight liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry used quantify 
in vivo rate appearance interconversion plasma arginine, ornithine, and
citrulline infected mice.
results:  children cerebral malaria p. berghei-infected mice
demonstrated depletion plasma arginine, ornithine, citrulline. knock out
of plasmodium arginase alter arginine depletion infected mice.
metabolic tracer analysis demonstrated plasma arginase flux unchanged by
p. berghei infection. instead, infected mice exhibited decreased rates plasma 
arginine, ornithine, citrulline appearance decreased conversion plasma
citrulline arginine. notably, plasma arginine use nitric oxide synthase was
decreased infected mice.
conclusions:  simultaneous arginine ornithine depletion malaria
parasite-infected children cannot fully explained plasma arginase activity.
our mouse model studies suggest plasma arginine depletion driven
primarily decreased rate appearance.
