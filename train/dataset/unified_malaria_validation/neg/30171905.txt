more third world population constant risk contracting some
insect-transmitted disease, dengue fever, zika virus disease, malaria,
chagas' disease, african trypanosomiasis, others. independent life
cycle pathogen causing disease, insect vector hematophagous habit 
is common crucial trait transmission diseases. this
lifestyle unique, hematophagous insects feed blood, diet rich 
in protein relatively poor lipids carbohydrates, huge amounts and
low frequency. another unique feature insects blood meal
triggers essential metabolic processes, molting oogenesis and, this
way, regulates expression various genes involved events.
in paper, review current knowledge physiology biochemistry 
lipid metabolism insect disease vectors, comparing classical models
whenever possible. address lipid digestion absorption, hemolymphatic
transport, lipid storage fat body ovary. context, de 
novo fatty acid triacylglycerol synthesis discussed, including the
related fatty acid activation process intracellular lipid binding
proteins. lipids stored order mobilized later on, e.g. flight
activity survivorship, lipolysis β-oxidation also considered. all
these events need finely regulated, role hormones this
control summarized. finally, also review information infection, 
vector insect physiology affected, crosstalk immune
system lipid metabolism. abundant information lipid
metabolism vector insects, significant current gaps field are
indicated, well questions answered future.
