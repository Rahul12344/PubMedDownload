malaria, infectious disease caused parasites plasmodium genus, is
one world's major public health concerns causing million deaths
annually, mostly p. falciparum infections. clinical
symptoms associated blood stage disease, obligate part 
the parasite life cycle, form parasite called merozoite
recognizes invades host erythrocytes. erythrocyte invasion, merozoites
are directly exposed host humoral immune system making blood stage 
the parasite conceptually attractive therapeutic target. progress the
functional molecular characterization p. falciparum merozoite proteins,
however, hampered technical challenges associated expressing
these proteins biochemically active recombinant form. challenge is
particularly acute extracellular proteins, likely targets of
host antibody responses, contain structurally critical
post-translational modifications added recombinant
expression systems. here, report development method uses a
mammalian expression system compile protein resource containing entire
ectodomains 42 p. falciparum merozoite secreted cell surface proteins,
many previously characterized. importantly, able to
recapitulate known biochemical activities showing recombinant msp1-msp7
and p12-p41 directly interact, recombinant eba175 eba140 can
bind human erythrocytes sialic acid-dependent manner. finally, use sera
from malaria-exposed immune adults profile relative immunoreactivity of
the proteins show majority antigens contain conformational
(heat-labile) epitopes. envisage resource recombinant proteins
will make valuable contribution toward molecular understanding blood
stage p. falciparum infections facilitate comparative screening of
antigens blood-stage vaccine candidates.
