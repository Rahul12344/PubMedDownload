most patients cerebral malaria (cm) sustain cerebral microvascular
sequestration plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells (irbcs). although
many young children infected p. falciparum, cm remains rare outcome;
thus, hypothesized specific host conditions facilitate irbc cerebral
sequestration. identify host factors, compared peripheral
whole-blood transcriptomes malawian children irbc cerebral sequestration,
identified malarial-retinopathy-positive cm (ret+cm), transcriptomes of
children cm cerebral irbc sequestration, defined as
malarial-retinopathy-negative cm (ret-cm). ret+cm associated with
upregulation 103 gene set pathways, including cytokine, blood coagulation, and
extracellular matrix (ecm) pathways (p < 0.01; false-discovery rate [fdr] of
<0.05). neutrophil transcripts highly upregulated individual
transcripts ret+cm patients. activated neutrophils modulate diverse host
processes, including ecm, inflammation, platelet biology potentially
facilitate parasite sequestration. therefore, compared plasma neutrophil
proteins neutrophil chemotaxis ret+cm ret-cm patients. plasma
levels human neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase, proteinase 3, not
lactoferrin lipocalin, elevated ret+cm patients, neutrophil
chemotaxis impaired, possibly related increased plasma heme. neutrophils
were rarely seen cm brain microvasculature autopsy samples, neutrophil 
extracellular traps found, suggesting putative neutrophil effect on
endothelial cell biology results neutrophil soluble factors rather than
direct neutrophil cellular tissue effects. meanwhile, children ret-cm had
lower levels inflammation, higher levels alpha interferon, upregulation
of toll-like receptor pathways host transcriptional pathways, may
represent responses favor cerebral irbc sequestration.importance:
there approximately 198 million cases malaria worldwide 2013, 
estimated 584,000 deaths occurring mostly sub-saharan african children. cm 
a severe rare form plasmodium falciparum infection associated 
high rates mortality neurological morbidity, despite antimalarial
treatment. greater understanding pathophysiology cm would allow the
development adjunctive therapies improve clinical outcomes. hallmark of
cm cerebral microvasculature sequestration p. falciparum-infected red blood
cells (irbcs), results vasculopathy patients. data provide a
global analysis host pathways associated cm newly identify an
association activated neutrophils brain irbc sequestration. products of
activated neutrophils could alter endothelial cell receptors coagulation to
facilitate irbc adherence. future studies examine role neutrophils
in cm pathogenesis improve health outcomes.
