histone modification profiles predictive gene expression the
knowledge gained acquired studies done higher eukaryotes. however, 
genome-wide studies involving plasmodium falciparum, causative agent of
malaria, rather few, lower resolution (mostly using chip-on-chip),
and covering limited number histone modifications. recent study [1], we
have performed extensive genome-wide analyses multiple histone modifications
including active (h3k4me2, h3k4me3, h3k9ac, h3k14ac, h3k27ac h4ac),
inactive (h3k9me3 h3k27me3), elongation (h3k79me3) regulatory element
(h3k4me1) stage-specific manner. furthermore, used ligation-based
method suitable sequencing homopolymeric stretches seen p. falciparum
for next-generation sequencing library amplification [2], enabling highly
quantitative analysis extremely at-rich p. falciparum genome. recently
published study suggests transcription regulation virtue poised
chromatin differential histone modifications unique p. falciparum [1]. 
here describe experiments, quality controls chromatin
immunoprecipitation-sequencing data analysis associated study published in
epigenetics chromatin [1]. stage-specific chip-sequencing data histone
modifications submitted gene expression omnibus (geo) database the
