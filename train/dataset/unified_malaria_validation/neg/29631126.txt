bromodomain-containing proteins (bdps) involved regulation of
eukaryotic gene expression. compounds bind and/or inhibit bdps of
interest tools better understand epigenetic regulation, possible
drug leads different diseases, including malaria. study, assessed 
the activity 42 compounds demonstrated predicted (using virtual screening
of pharmacophore model) bind/inhibit eukaryotic bdps activity against
plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites. silico docking studies indicated that
all compounds predicted participate typical hydrogen bond interaction
with conserved asparagine (asn1436) p. falciparum histone
acetyltransferase (pfgcn5) bromodomain conserved water molecule. one
compound (the dimethylisoxazole sgc-cbp30; selective inhibitor crebbp (cbp) 
and ep300 bromodomains) also predicted salt-bridge the
morpholine nitrogen glu1389. tested vitro activity against
asynchronous asexual stage p. falciparum dd2 parasites, compounds displayed
50% growth inhibitory concentrations (ic50) >10 μm. testing three 
most potent compounds using synchronous parasites 72 h showed sgc-cbp30 
was active (ic50 3.2 μm). vitro cytotoxicity assays showed that
sgc-cbp30 ∼7-fold better selectivity parasites versus human cell
line (hek 293). together data provide possible starting point future 
investigation these, related compounds, tools understand epigenetic
regulation potential new drug leads.
