arthropod borne diseases cause significant human morbidity mortality and,
therefore, efficient measures control transmission disease agents would
have great impact human health. one strategy achieve goal based 
the manipulation bacterial symbionts vectors. bacteria the
gram-negative, acetic acid bacterium genus asaia found stably
associated larvae adults southeast asian malaria vector anopheles
stephensi, dominating microbiota mosquito. show the
infection anopheles gambiae larvae asaia bacteria stably
associated mosquitoes, becoming part microflora midgut and
remaining duration life cycle. moreover passed 
to next generation vertical transmission. additionally, show 
there increase developmental rate additional bacteria are
introduced organism leads us conclusion asaia plays 
yet undetermined crucial role larval stages. microarray analysis
showed larval genes mostly affected involved cuticle
formation, include mainly members cpr gene family.
