region ii duffy binding protein (pvdbp-ii) one promising
blood-stage vaccine candidate antigens plasmodium vivax having
knowledge nature genetic polymorphism pvdbp-ii among global p.
vivax isolates important developing dbp-based vaccine. using pcr 
sequencing, present molecular population genetic approach carried 
investigate sequence diversity natural selection dbp-ii gene 63 p.
vivax isolates collected unstable low transmission malaria-endemic areas
of iran 2008-2012. also, phylogenetic analysis, diversifying natural
selection, recombination across pvdbp-ii gene, including regions
containing b-cell epitopes analyzed using dnasp mega4 programs.
twenty two single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps, including 20 non-synonymous and
2 synonymous) identified pvdbp-ii, resulting 16 different pvdbp-ii
haplotypes among iranian p. vivax isolates. high binding inhibitory b-cell
epitope (h3) overlapping intrinsically unstructured/disordered region (aa:
384-392) appeared highly polymorphic (d384g/e385k/ k386n/q/r390h), and
positive selective pressure acted region. polymorphic amino
acids, located surface protein, selective
pressure implies increased recombination events exposure human
immune system. summary, pvdbp-ii gene displays genetic polymorphism among
iranian p. vivax isolates selective pressure. mutations,
recombination, positive selection seem play role resulting
genetic diversity, phylogenetic analysis dna sequences demonstrates that
iranian isolates represent sample global population. results are
useful understanding nature p. vivax population iran also
for development pvdbp-ii-based malaria vaccine.
