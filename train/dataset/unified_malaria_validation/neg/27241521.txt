during clinically silent liver stage plasmodium infection parasite
replicates single sporozoite thousands merozoites. infection of
humans rodents large numbers sporozoites arrest their
development within liver cause sterile protection subsequent
infections. disruption genes essential liver stage development rodent
malaria parasites yielded number attenuated parasite strains. key
question end increased attenuation relates vaccine efficacy.
here, generated rodent malaria parasite lines arrest liver stage
development probed impact multiple gene deletions attenuation and
protective efficacy. contrast p. berghei strain anka lisp2(-) uis3(-)
single knockout parasites, occasionally caused breakthrough infections, the
double mutant lacking genes completely attenuated even high numbers
of sporozoites administered. however, different vaccination protocols showed
that lisp2(-) parasites protected better uis3(-) double mutants. hence, 
deletion several genes yield increased safety might come cost
of protective efficacy.
