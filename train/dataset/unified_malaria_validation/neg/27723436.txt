perkinsus marinus protozoan parasite molluscs propagated in
vitro defined culture medium, absence host cells. previously
reported p. marinus trophozoites transfected high efficiency 
electroporation using plasmid based moe, highly expressed gene, and
proposed potential use "pseudoparasite." novel gene expression
platform parasites medical relevance choice surrogate
organism based phylogenetic affinity parasite interest, while
taking advantage whole engineered surrogate organism vaccination
adjuvant. improved original transfection plasmid incorporating a
multicloning site, enterokinase recognition sequence upstream gfp, a
his-tag demonstrate potential suitability heterologous expression
of plasmodium sp. genes relevant development anti-malarial vaccines.
plasmodium berghei hap2 msp8, currently considered candidate genes a
malaria vaccine, cloned p[moe]:gfp, constructs used to
transfect p. marinus trophozoites. within 48 hr transfection observed
fluorescent cells indicating p. berghei genes fused gfp were
expressed. expression appeared transient p. berghei genes, 
florescence transfectants diminished gradually time. although this
heterologous expression system require optimization integration and
constitutive expression plasmodium genes, results represent attainment 
proof "pseudoparasite" concept previously proposed, show that
the engineered p. marinus system potential become surrogate system
suitable expression plasmodium spp. genes interest, could
eventually used malaria vaccine delivery platform. aim present
study test ability marine protozoan parasite p. marinus express 
genes p. berghei .
