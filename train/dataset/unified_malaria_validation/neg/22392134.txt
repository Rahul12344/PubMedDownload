reactive oxygen species produced hemoglobin digestion host immune
system could adverse effects malaria parasites. protect themselves,
malaria parasites highly dependent antioxidant enzymes, including
superoxide dismutases thioredoxin-dependent peroxidases. date, several
thioredoxin peroxidases (tpx) characterized plasmodium falciparum,
but tpx plasmodium vivax yet characterized. complete
sequence gene coding thioredoxin peroxidase-1 p. vivax (pvtpx-1) was
amplified pcr cloned. using recombinant pvtpx-1 (rpvtpx-1), polyclonal
antibody produced mice immunolocalization enzyme the
parasite. antioxidant activity rpvtpx-1 evaluated mixed-function
oxidation assay. pvtpx-1 two conserved cysteine residues amino acid
sequence positions 50 170 formed dimer non-reducing
condition. using thiol mixed-function oxidation assay, antioxidant activity
of rpvtpx-1 revealed. indirect immunofluorescence microscopy the
specific antibody indicated pvtpx-1 expressed cytoplasm the
erythrocytic stage parasite dots-like pattern. results suggest
that p. vivax uses tpx-1 reduce detoxify hydrogen peroxides order to
maintain redox homeostasis proliferation host body.
