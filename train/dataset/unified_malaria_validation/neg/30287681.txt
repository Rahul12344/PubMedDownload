trnas emerging critical regulators cell physiology stress response.
here, demonstrate highly coordinated behavior repertoire trna
modifications plasmodium falciparum throughout intra-erythrocytic
developmental cycle (idc). observed synchronized increase 22 28
modifications ring trophozoite stage, consistent trna maturation
during translational up-regulation, asynchronous changes six
modifications. quantitative analysis ~2,100 proteins across idc revealed
that up- down-regulated proteins late early stages marked
codon bias directly correlates parallel changes trna modifications
and enhanced translational efficiency. thus propose model trna
modifications modulate abundance stage-specific proteins enhancing
translation efficiency codon-biased transcripts critical genes. these
findings reveal novel epitranscriptomic translational control mechanisms in
the development pathogenesis plasmodium parasites.
