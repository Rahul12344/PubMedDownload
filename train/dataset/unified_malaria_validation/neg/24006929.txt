the first epidemiological study thalassemia cyprus performed fawdry
in 1946. study determined frequency β-thalassemia (β-thal)
carriers around 18.0% α(0)-thal carriers (individuals both
cis α-globin genes inactive) around 2.0%. 1998, another study concluded
that cyprus one highest frequencies β-thal carriers worldwide
(17.2%). based haldane's hypothesis malaria might selective agent 
responsible maintenance high levels thalassemia sickle cell
disease many populations around world, expected following the
eradication disease cyprus 1948, carriers β-thal should
decline generation. order determine whether the
case, compiled frequency data β-thal carriers three separate surveys 
performed part cyprus national thalassaemia screening programme (ntsp).
the surveys carried 1986, 2003 2010 involving 9622, 6711 5228
subjects, respectively. expected drop prevalence β-thal carriers
for successive generation following eradication malaria, i.e., the
absence selection pressure, calculated using hardy-weinberg equation
and mathematical model hartl clark. surveys provide supporting
evidence decrease frequency β-thal carriers greek
cypriot population, drop 1.89% 24 years.
