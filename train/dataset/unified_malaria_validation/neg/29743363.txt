recent advances mass spectrometry methods instrumentation allow for
more accurate identification proteins low abundance. technology was
applied sindbis virus, prototypical alphavirus, investigate viral
proteome. determine host proteins specifically packaged alphavirus
virions, sindbis virus (sinv) grown multiple host cells representing
vertebrate mosquito hosts, total protein content purified virions 
determined. analysis identified host factors previously associated 
alphavirus entry, replication, egress. one host protein, sorting nexin 5
(snx5), shown critical replication three different
alphaviruses, sindbis, mayaro, chikungunya viruses. significant
finding addition host proteins, sinv nonstructural protein 2
(nsp2) detected within virions grown host cells examined. protein 
and rna-interacting capabilities nsp2 coupled presence virion 
support role nsp2 packaging and/or entry progeny virus. this
function identified protein. taken together, strategy 
identified least one host factor integrally involved alphavirus
replication. identification host proteins provides insight into
alphavirus-host interactions viral replication vertebrate and
invertebrate hosts. method virus proteome analysis may also useful for
the identification protein candidates host-based therapeutics.importance
pathogenic alphaviruses, chikungunya mayaro viruses, continue to
plague public health developing developed countries alike. alphaviruses
belong group viruses vectored nature hematophagous (blood-feeding) 
insects termed arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses). group of
viruses contains many human pathogens, dengue fever, west nile, and
yellow fever viruses. exceptions, vaccines prophylactics
for agents, leaving one-third world population risk infection.
identifying effective antivirals long-term goal combating these
diseases lack vaccines also are
effective ongoing epidemic. mass spectrometry-based analysis the
sindbis virus proteome effective identifying host genes involved in
virus replication novel functions virus proteins. identification these
factors invaluable prophylaxis group viruses.
