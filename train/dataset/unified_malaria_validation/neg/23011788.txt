one important step structure-based drug design studies is
obtaining protein active form cloning target gene. one our
previous study, determined internal shine-dalgarno-like sequence
present third methionine n-terminus wild type lactate
dehydrogenase enzyme plasmodium falciparum prevent translation full
length protein. inspection region p. vivax ldh, was
overproduced active enzyme, indicated codon preference same
region slightly different codon preference wild type pfldh. in
this study, 5'-ggaggc-3' sequence p. vivax codes two glycine residues
just third methionine exchanged 5'-ggagga-3', mimicking p.
falciparum ldh, prove possible effects internal sd-like
sequence expressing eukaryotic protein prokaryotic system. exchange 
was made site-directed mutagenesis. results indicated two glycine 
residues internal sd-like sequence (ggagga) third
methionine abolishes enzyme activity due preference prokaryotic
system used expression. study emphasizes awareness use a
prokaryotic system overproduce eukaryotic protein.
