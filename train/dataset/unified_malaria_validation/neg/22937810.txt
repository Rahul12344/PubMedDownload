background: search new drug targets antibiotics plasmodium
falciparum, major cause human deaths, pressing scientific issue, as
multiple resistance strains spread rapidly. metabolic network-based analyses may 
help identify parasite's essential enzymes whose homologous counterparts
in human host cells either absent, non-essential relatively less
essential.
results: using well-curated metabolic networks plasmonet parasite
plasmodium falciparum hepatonet1 human hepatocyte, selectivity 
48 experimental antimalarial drug targets analyzed. applying silico gene
deletions, 24 drug targets found perfectly selective, that
they essential parasite non-essential human cell. the
selectivity subset enzymes, essential models, was
evaluated reduced fitness concept. was, then, possible quantify
the reduction functional fitness two networks progressive
inhibition enzymatic activity. overall, silico analysis
provided selectivity ranking line numerous vivo in
vitro observations.
conclusions: genome-scale models useful depict quantify effects
of enzymatic inhibitions impaired production biomass components. from
the perspective host-pathogen metabolic interaction, estimation the
drug targets-induced consequences beneficial development a
selective anti-parasitic drug.
