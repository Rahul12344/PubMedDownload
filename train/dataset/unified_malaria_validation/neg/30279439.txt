plasmodium parasites exerted strong selective pressure primate genomes and
mutations genes encoding erythrocyte cytoskeleton proteins (ecp) determine
protective effects plasmodium infection/pathogenesis. thus
hypothesized ecp-encoding genes evolved response to
plasmodium-driven selection. analyzed evolutionary history 15
ecp-encoding genes primates, well plasmodium-encoded ligands
(kahrp, mesa emp3). results indicated epb42, slc4a1, spta1 evolved
under pervasive positive selection episodes positive selection tended
to occur frequently primate species host larger number of
plasmodium parasites. conversely, several genes, including ank1 sptb,
displayed extensive signatures purifying selection primate phylogenies,
homininae lineages, human populations, suggesting strong functional
constraints. analysis plasmodium genes indicated adaptive evolution mesa
and kahrp; latter, different positively selected sites located the
spectrin-binding domains. positively selected sites in
alpha-spectrin localized domains involved interaction kahrp,
we suggest two proteins engaged arms-race scenario. this
observation relevant kahrp essential formation "knobs", 
which represent major virulence determinant p. falciparum.
