trypanosoma brucei related pathogens transcribe genes polycistronic
arrays subsequently processed monocistronic mrnas. expression is
frequently regulated post-transcriptionally cis-acting elements the
untranslated regions (utrs). gpeet ep procyclins major surface
proteins procyclic (insect midgut) forms t. brucei. three regulatory
elements common 3' utrs mrnas regulate mrna turnover and
translation. glycerol-responsive element (gre) unique gpeet 3' utr 
and regulates expression independently ep. synthetic rna encompassing 
the gre showed robust sequence-specific interactions cytoplasmic proteins in
electromobility shift assays. this, combined column chromatography, led to
the identification 3 alba-domain proteins. rnai alba3 caused growth 
phenotype reduced levels alba1 alba2 proteins, indicative of
interactions family members. tandem-affinity purification and
co-immunoprecipitation verified interactions also identified alba4 in
sub-stoichiometric amounts. alba proteins cytoplasmic recruited to
starvation granules together poly(a) rna. concomitant depletion four 
alba proteins rnai specifically reduced translation reporter transcript

interactions poly(a) binding proteins, ribosomal protein p0 and, case
of alba3, cap-binding protein eif4e4. addition, alba2 alba3 partially
