communication cells ensures coordinated behavior. prokaryotes, this
signaling typically referred quorum sensing, whereas eukaryotic
cells, communication occurs hormones. recent years, reports shown
that small noncoding rnas, called micrornas (mirnas), transmitted one
species another, inducing signal interference distant species, even a
cross-kingdom manner. new mode cross-species communication might mediate 
symbiotic pathogenic relationships various organisms (e.g.,
microorganisms hosts). here, discuss several recent studies
concerning mirna-mediated cross-species gene regulation.
