southern zambia focus strategies create malaria-free zones.
interventions rolled include test treat strategies distribution
of insecticide-treated bed nets target vectors host-seek indoors and
late night. macha, choma district, collections mosquitoes made
outdoors using barrier screens within homesteads uv bulb light traps set next 
to goats, cattle, chickens rainy season 2015. anopheline
mosquitoes identified species using molecular methods plasmodium
falciparum infectivity determined elisa real-time qpcr methods. more
than 40% specimens caught identified anopheles squamosus theobald,
1901 six found harboring malaria parasites. single sample,
morphologically identified anopheles coustani laveran, 1900, also found to
be infectious. seven specimens caught outdoors next goat pens.
parasite-positive specimens well subset an. squamosus specimens from
either study archive collections area underwent
sequencing mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit gene. maximum
parsimony trees constructed aligned sequences indicated presence at
least two clades an. squamosus infectious specimens falling each
clade. single infectious specimen identified morphologically an. coustani 
could matched reference sequences. first report zambia
of infections an. squamosus, species described literature to
display exophagic traits. bionomic characteristics species needs to
be studied fully evaluate implications indoor-targeted vector 
control.
