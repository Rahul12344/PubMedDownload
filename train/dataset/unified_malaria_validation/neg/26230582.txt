pathogen-driven balancing selection determines richness human leukocyte
antigen (hla) alleles. changes pathogen spectrum may cause corresponding
changes hla loci. approximately 700 years ago, mongolian population moved
from north china yunnan region south china. pathogen 
spectrum south china differs north. study,
changes hla genes yunnan mongolian population, well the
underlying mechanism, investigated. sequence-based typing method (sbt) was
used genotype hla-drb1 470 individuals two mongolian populations and
another five ethnic groups. meanwhile, 10 autosomal short tandem repeats (strs)
were genotyped assess influence genetic background hla-drb1
frequencies. frequencies certain alleles changed significantly the
mongolian population migrated yunnan. example, drb1*12:02:01
increased 6.1% 35.4%. str analysis excluded possibility recent
bottleneck indicated 50% genetic consistency northern and
southern mongolians; tajima's value hla-drb1 exon2 dn/ds analysis
showed hla-drb1 genes mongolian populations balancing
selection. however, sites natural selection changed. proposed that
the dramatically change hla frequencies southern mongolian caused 
combination inter-population gene flow natural selection. certain diseases
specific south china, malaria, may driving force behind 
the enhanced drb1*12:02:01 frequency.
