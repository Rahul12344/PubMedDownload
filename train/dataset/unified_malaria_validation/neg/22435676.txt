the plasmodium falciparum genome equipped several subtelomeric gene
families implicated parasite virulence immune evasion. members of
these families uniformly positioned within heterochromatic domains are
thus subject variegated expression. best-studied example the
var family encoding major parasite virulence factor p. falciparum erythrocyte
membrane protein 1 (pfemp1). pfemp1 undergoes antigenic variation through
switches mutually exclusive var gene transcription. var promoters function 
crucial regulatory elements underlying epigenetic control strategy. here, 
we analysed promoters upsa, upsb upsc var, rifa1-type rif, stevor, phist
and pfmc-2tm genes investigated role endogenous gene transcription
by comparative genome-wide expression profiling transgenic parasite lines. 
find three major var promoter types functionally equal play an
essential role singular gene choice. unlike var promoters, promoters of
non-var families silenced default, transcription non-var
families subject mode mutually exclusive transcription as
has observed var genes. findings identified differential logic 
the regulation var subtelomeric virulence gene families, 
have important implications understanding future analyses of
phenotypic variation malaria parasites.
