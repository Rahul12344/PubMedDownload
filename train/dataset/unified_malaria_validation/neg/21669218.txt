blood-stage malaria plasmodium chabaudi characterized responsiveness
to testosterone (t): suppresses development protective immunity, whereas
once acquired immunity t-unresponsive. here, analyzed liver, t
target lymphoid organ anti-malaria activity, t-responsiveness of
gene expression immune mice. using affymetrix microarray technology, in
combination quantitative rt-pcr, identified (i) t-unresponsive
expression newly acquired mrnas encoding diverse sequences igg- and
igm-antibodies, (ii) 24 genes whose expression become t-unresponsive
including encoding t(h)2 response promoting ehmt2 erythrocyte
membrane protein band 7.2 stom, (iii) t-unresponsive expression mrnas 
cytokines il-1β, il-6, tnfα, ifnγ, well inos, even not
inducible infection, (iv) 35 genes retaining t-responsiveness, which
include encoding infection-inducible acute phase proteins saa1, saa2,
and orm2 well liver metabolism encode t-downregulated
female-prevalent enzymes cyp2b9, cyp2b13, cyp3a41, cyp7a1, sult2a2 the
t-upregulated male-prevalent enzymes cyp2d9, cyp7b1, ugt2b1, hsd3b2, hsd3b5,
respectively. mrna latter t-metabolizing enzyme even 5-fold
increased t, suggesting decrease effective concentrations the
liver immune mice. collectively, data suggest liver, has
acquired selective t-unresponsiveness gene expression, contributes the
acquired t-unresponsive, antibody-mediated protective immunity blood-stage
malaria p. chabaudi.
