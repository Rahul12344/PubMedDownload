gametocytogenesis gametogenesis malaria parasites complex processes of
cell differentiation development likely involving many gene products.
gametocytes develop blood vertebrate host mature gametocytes
are activated taken mosquito vector. several distinct mutants
have described block gametogenesis detailed molecular causes
for mutant phenotypes understood. investigate whether block in
gametogenesis also results changed transcriptional profile studied two
gene deletions mutants; act2(-) lacking stage-specific actin ii cdpk4(-)
lacking calcium-dependent protein kinase 4. whole genome microarray analysis 
performed rna mature gametocytes compare transcriptomes the
mutants wild-type plasmodium berghei. microarray analysis identified
∼12% genes differentially expressed either mutants
compared normal gametocytes, defined least two-fold change in
transcript abundance. large proportion differentially expressed genes
overlapped two mutants, consistent related outcome gametocyte
arrest. distinct profiles mutant also observed. among the
down-regulated genes thioredoxin 2 members merozoite surface
protein 7 family. generation characterization msp7(-)/mspr1(-)/mspr2(-) 
triple mutant re-analysis trx2(-) parasites revealed impairment life
cycle progression. together, analysis provides resource molecular
signatures plasmodium berghei gametogenesis exemplifies potential of
expression profiling distinct genetically arrested parasites.
