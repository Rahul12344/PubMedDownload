major efforts currently underway develop novel, complementary methods to
combat mosquito-borne diseases. mosquito genetic control strategies (gcss) have
become increasingly important area research account their
species-specificity, track record targeting agricultural insect pests, and
their environmentally non-polluting nature. number programs targeting aedes 
and anopheles mosquitoes, vectors human arboviruses malaria respectively, 
are currently developed deployed many parts world.
operationally implementing technologies large scale however, beyond
proof-of-concept pilot programs, hampered absence adequate sex
separation methods. sex separation eliminates females laboratory male
mosquitoes prior release. despite need sex separation control 
of mosquitoes, limited efforts recent years developing
systems fit-for-purpose. special issue parasites vectors 
we report progress global coordinated research program on
"exploring genetic, molecular, mechanical behavioural methods sex

the joint fao/iaea division nuclear techniques food agriculture with
the specific aim building efficient sex separation systems mosquito
species. effort overcome current barriers briefly highlight we
believe three main reasons progress slow developing
appropriate sex separation systems: availability methods not
scalable, difficulty building ideal genetic systems and, finally, 
lack research efforts area.
