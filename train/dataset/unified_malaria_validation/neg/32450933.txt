the genome plasmodium falciparum one skewed base-pair
compositions eukaryote, content 80-90%. start stop
codons at-rich, probability finding upstream open reading frames
(uorfs) messenger rnas (mrnas) high parasite mrnas average of
11 uorfs leader sequences. similar eukaryotes, uorfs repress
the translation downstream open reading frame (dorf) p. falciparum, yet
the parasite translation machinery able bypass uorfs reach the
dorf initiate translation. happen leaky scanning and/or
reinitiation.in report, assessed leaky scanning reinitiation by
studying effect uorfs translation dorf, case, the
luciferase reporter gene, showed mechanisms employed the
asexual blood stages p. falciparum. furthermore, addition codon
usage uorf, translation dorf governed kozak sequence 
length uorf, inter-cistronic distance uorf dorf. based
on features whole-genome data analysed uncover classes genes that
might regulated uorfs. study indicates leaky scanning and
reinitiation appear widespread asexual stages p. falciparum, which
may require modifications existing factors involved translation
initiation addition novel, parasite-specific proteins.
