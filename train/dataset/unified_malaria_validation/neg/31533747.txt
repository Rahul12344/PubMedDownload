background: plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen-1 (pfama-1) a
promising candidate antigen blood-stage malaria vaccine. however, antigenic
variation diversity pfama-1 still major problems design universal
malaria vaccine based antigen, especially domain (di). detail
understanding pfama-1 gene polymorphism provide useful information 
this potential vaccine component. here, general characteristics genetic
structure effect natural selection dis among bioko p. falciparum
isolates analysed.
methods: 214 blood samples collected bioko island patients p.
falciparum malaria 2011 2017. fragment spanning di pfama-1 was
amplified nested polymerase chain reaction sequenced. polymorphic
characteristics effect natural selection analysed using mega 5.0,
dnasp 6.0 popart programs. genetic diversity 576 global pfama-1 dis were
also analysed. protein function prediction new amino acid mutation sites was
performed using polyphen-2 program.
results: 131 different haplotypes pfama-1 identified 214 bioko island 
p. falciparum isolates. amino acid changes identified bioko island were
found c1l. 32 amino acid changes identified pfama-1 sequences bioko
island found predicted rbc-binding sites, b cell epitopes iur regions.
overall patterns amino acid changes bioko pfama-1 dis similar those
in global pfama-1 isolates. differential amino acid substitution frequencies were
observed samples different geographical regions. eight new amino acid
changes bioko island isolates also identified three-dimensional
protein structural consequences predicted. evidence natural selection
and recombination event observed global isolates.
conclusions: patterns nucleotide diversity amino acid polymorphisms of
bioko island isolates similar global pfama-1 dis. balancing
natural selection across dis might play major role generating genetic
diversity global isolates. amino acid changes dis occurred in
predicted b-cell epitopes. novel sites mapped three dimensional structure of
pfama-1 showed regions located corner. results may
provide significant value design malaria vaccine based this
antigen.
