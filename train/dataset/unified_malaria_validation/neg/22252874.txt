mammalian macrophage migration inhibitory factor (mif) multifaceted cytokine
involved extracellular intracellular functions. malaria parasites
express mif homologue might modulate host immune responses against
blood-stage parasites, potential importance mif life
cycle stages remains unstudied. study, characterized mif homologue
of plasmodium yoelii throughout life cycle, emphasis preerythrocytic 
stages. p. yoelii mif (py-mif) expressed blood-stage parasites and
detected low levels mosquito salivary gland sporozoites. mif expression was
strong throughout liver-stage development localized cytoplasm the
parasite, evidence release host hepatocyte. examine the
importance py-mif liver-stage development, generated py-mif knockout 
parasite (p. yoelii δmif). p. yoelii δmif parasites grew normally asexual
erythrocytic-stage parasites showed normal infection mosquitoes. in
contrast, p. yoelii δmif strain attenuated liver stage. mice
infected p. yoelii δmif sporozoites either develop blood-stage
parasitemia exhibited delay onset blood-stage patency.
furthermore, p. yoelii δmif parasites exhibited growth retardation vivo.
combined, data indicate plasmodium mif important liver-stage
development p. yoelii, likely play intrinsic role 
parasite development rather modulating host immune responses infection.
