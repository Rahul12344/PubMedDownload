mismatch specific endonuclease (mse) method used detect natural
polymorphisms pvs25 pv38 genes plasmodium vivax. eighty seven patients 
with p. vivax recruited republic korea (rok). pvs25 pv38 genes
were amplified polymerase chain reaction (pcr), pcr amplicons were
mixed reference dna sequences. following denaturation gradual
annealing, product mixtures cleaved mse. heteroduplex types 
readily detected gel electrophoresis, extra bands shorter sizes
would appear cleavage. mse cleavage 657- bp product pvs25 
mixtures, three genotypes detected, pv38 mixtures 1220-bp
products presented two genotypes rok isolates. mse cleavage, the
mismatched samples pvs25 pv38 completely sequenced, results
were complete agreement mse analyses. conclusion, genotyping of
pvs25 pv38 mse cleavage could potential method the
high-throughput screening large field samples.
