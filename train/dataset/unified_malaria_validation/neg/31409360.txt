background: plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (pfemp1)
antigens play critical role host immune evasion. serologic responses to
these antigens associated protection clinical malaria,
suggesting antibodies pfemp1 antigens may contribute natural immunity.
the first n-terminal constitutive domain pfemp1 duffy binding-like
alpha (dbl-α) domain, contains 300 400 base pair region unique each
particular protein (the dbl-α "tag"). dbl-α tag used marker of
pfemp1 diversity serologic responses malaria-exposed populations. 
study, using sera malaria-endemic region, responses dbl-α tags were
compared responses corresponding entire dbl-α domain (or "parent"
domain) coupled succeeding cysteine-rich interdomain region (cidr).
methods: protein microarray populated dbl-α tags, parent dbl-cidr head
structures, downstream pfemp1 protein fragments probed sera from
malian children (aged 1 6 years) adults control arms apical
membrane antigen 1 (ama1) vaccine clinical trials malaria
transmission season. serological responses dbl-α tag dbl-cidr head
structure measured compared children adults, throughout the
season.
results: malian serologic responses pfemp1's dbl-α tag region not
correlate seasonal malaria exposure, responses parent
dbl-cidr head structure either children adults. parent dbl-cidr head
structures better indicators malaria exposure.
conclusions: larger pfemp1 domains may better indicators malaria exposure
than short, variable pfemp1 fragments dbl-α tags. pfemp1 head structures 
that include conserved sequences appear particularly well suited study as
serologic predictors malaria exposure.
