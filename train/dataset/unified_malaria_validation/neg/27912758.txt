background: recent reports emergence spread artemisinin resistance in
the southeast asia region, including myanmar, pose greater threat malaria
control elimination india. wholeÂ genome sequencing studies associated
mutations k13 propeller gene (k13), pf3d7_1343700 artemisinin
resistance vitro vivo. aim present study find
the k13 gene polymorphisms plasmodium falciparum parasites three
sites northeast region india, bordering bangladesh myanmar.
methods: total 254 samples collected 2014-2015 tripura, mizoram 
and arunachal pradesh states northeast region india used obtain
the full-length k13 gene sequences.
results: three non-synonymous (ns) mutations: two propeller region, namely
at codon 446 578, observed besides one codon 189 non-propeller
region. treatment outcome affected mutations the
sites. addition, microsatellite variation n-terminus k13 protein
was observed study sites.
conclusion: first study document presence f446i ns mutation
in k13 propeller region changlang district, arunachal pradesh, site
adjoining indo-myanmar border region, mutation highly
prevalent. addition, ns mutation a578s observed lunglei
district, mizoram, site bordering bangladesh k189t mutation relatively
higher frequency mizoram tripura states. presence f446i mutation in
a region close myanmar border notable. considering spread of
anti-malarial drug resistance southeast asia northeast region of
india past, urgent need undertake systematic mapping
studies ascertain role extent mutation artemisinin
resistance region country.
