heme metabolism central blood-stage infection malaria parasite
plasmodium falciparum. parasites retain heme biosynthesis pathway not
require activity infection heme-rich erythrocytes, can
scavenge host heme meet metabolic needs. nevertheless, heme biosynthesis in
parasite-infected erythrocytes potently stimulated exogenous
5-aminolevulinic acid (ala), resulting accumulation phototoxic
intermediate protoporphyrin ix (ppix). use photodynamic imaging, mass
spectrometry, parasite gene disruption, chemical probes reveal that
vestigial host enzymes cytoplasm plasmodium-infected erythrocytes
contribute ala-stimulated heme biosynthesis ala uptake depends on
parasite-established permeability pathways. show ppix accumulation in
infected erythrocytes harnessed antimalarial chemotherapy using
luminol-based chemiluminescence combinatorial stimulation low-dose
artemisinin photoactivate ppix produce cytotoxic reactive oxygen. this
photodynamic strategy advantage exploiting host enzymes refractory 
resistance-conferring mutations.
