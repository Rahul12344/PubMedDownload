since pvtarag55 protein (pvtarag55) plasmodium vivax (p. vivax) expressed
during parasite's sporozoite stage, strongly suggested, potential
candidate development vaccine malaria. pvtarag55
polymorphisms examined among isolates various locations asian
countries mainly; thus current study could set valuable baseline data for
the development vaccine clinical trials. total 59 samples were
collected asian countries one isolate africa. pvtarag55 gene from
59 isolates amplified, sequenced, analyzed. pvtarag55 contained highly 
conserved tryptophan-rich domain (trd) variable alanine-rich domain (ard). 
in comparison sal-1 strain, 10 allelic types pvtarag55 found among
59 isolates. main observed variations insertions deletions of
repeated sequences ala-rich domain. four types ggvaaap repeats were
found codon 324. interestingly, ggvaaap found majority sal-1 type
in world. two repeats (x2) found isolates korea, china, and
india. type total deletion ggvaaap three repeat (x3) found from
indonesia isolates. furthermore, "second insertion repeats"—with one two
repeats—were found afgapsgfaprp amino acid sequences codon 338. two
repeats (x2) afgapsgfaprp found indonesia, png isolates. finally, 
a "third repeat" present ttvnpea amino acid sequences codon 429 (the 
indonesian isolates three ttvnpea sequences position). isolates 
rok revealed "conserved sequences" tryptophan-rich domain pvtarag55 with
single amino acid substitutions (m180i). hence, extensive antigenic diversity
of pvtarag55 taken account vaccine development.
