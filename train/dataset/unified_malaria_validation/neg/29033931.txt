malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ma-ards) often
lethal complication malaria. currently, adequate therapy syndrome 
exists. although glucocorticoids (gcs) used improve clinical outcome
of ards, therapeutic benefits remain unclear. previously developed a
mouse model ma-ards, dexamethasone treatment revealed gc resistance. 
in present study, investigated gc sensitivity mouse microvascular lung 
endothelial cells stimulated interferon-γ (ifn-γ) plasmodium berghei
nk65 (pbnk65). upon challenge ifn-γ alone, dexamethasone inhibited the
expression ccl5 (rantes) 90% ccl2 (mcp-1) cxcl10 (ip-10) by
50%. accordingly, whole transcriptome analysis revealed dexamethasone
differentially affected several gene clusters particular inhibited large
cluster ifn-γ-induced genes, including chemokines. contrast, combined
stimulation ifn-γ pbnk65 extract impaired inhibitory actions gcs on
chemokine release, without affecting capacity gc receptor to
accumulate nucleus. subsequently, investigated effects gcs on
two signaling pathways activated ifn-γ. dexamethasone left phosphorylation and
protein levels signal transducer activator transcription 1 (stat1)
unhampered. contrast, dexamethasone inhibited ifn-γ-induced activation 
two mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapk), jnk, p38. however, pbnk65
extract abolished inhibitory effects gcs mapk signaling, inducing gc
resistance. data provide novel insights mechanisms gc actions
in endothelial cells show malaria may impair beneficial effects of
gcs.
