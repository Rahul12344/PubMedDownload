experimental cerebral malaria (ecm) gamma interferon (ifn-γ)-dependent
syndrome. however, whether ifn-γ promotes ecm direct synergistic
targeting multiple cell populations acting primarily specific
responsive cell type currently unknown. here, using panel cell- and
compartment-specific ifn-γ receptor 2 (ifn-γr2)-deficient mice, show that
ifn-γ causes ecm signaling within hematopoietic nonhematopoietic 
compartments. mechanistically, hematopoietic nonhematopoietic
compartment-specific ifn-γr signaling exerts additive effects orchestrating
intracerebral inflammation, leading development ecm. surprisingly, mice
with specific deletion ifn-γr2 expression myeloid cells, cells, or
neurons completely susceptible terminal ecm. utilizing reductionist 
vitro system, show synergistic ifn-γ tumor necrosis factor (tnf)
stimulation promotes strong activation brain blood vessel endothelial cells.
combined, data show within hematopoietic compartment, ifn-γ causes
ecm acting redundantly targeting non-t cell non-myeloid cell
populations. within nonhematopoietic compartment, brain endothelial cells,
but neurons, may major target ifn-γ leading ecm development.
collectively, data provide information ifn-γ mediates development 
of cerebral pathology malaria infection.
