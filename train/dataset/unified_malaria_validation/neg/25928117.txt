background: nigeria, despite change national malaria drug policy to
artemisinin combination therapy (act) 2005 due widespread chloroquine
resistance, chloroquine (cq) still widely used treatment malaria
because cheap, affordable accessible. use act management
of uncomplicated malaria currently promoted. employment genetic
markers track circulating chloroquine-resistant parasites useful in
elucidating likely poor efficacy chloroquine, especially settings 
is recommended treatment uncomplicated falciparum malaria. this
study determined prevalence pfcrt haplotypes point mutations pfmdr1
genes four years change antimalarial treatment policy cq the
acts lagos, commercial city south-west, nigeria.
methods: cross sectional study uncomplicated malaria children
less 12Â years presented fever symptoms suggestive of
malaria. parasite dna extracted 119 patients 251 children who
were positive plasmodium falciparum microscopy amplified. the
occurrence haplotypes investigated pfcrt gene using probe-based qpcr
and single nucleotide polymorphisms pfmdr1 gene using nested pcr.
results: one hundred nine (109) 119 children p falciparum
infection (91.6%) harbourd parasites mutant pfcrt haplotype (cviet). out
of this, 4.2% comprised mixture genotypes encoding cvmnk cviet, while
4.2% wild type (cvmnk). furthermore, frequency point mutations 
pfmdr1 62.2% 69.0% codons y86 f184 respectively. no
mutations codons 1034, 1042 1246 pfmdr1 genes.
conclusion: high frequency cq-resistant haplotypes (cviet) and
mutations pfmdr1 associated cq resistance p. falciparum among these
children suggest cq-resistant parasites still circulation. continuous
use chloroquine may continue increase level mutations pfcrt and
pfmdr1genes. need strengthen current case management efforts at
promoting act use well urgently restricting access chloroquine the
national drug regulatory agency, national agency food drug administration and
control (nafdac).
