background: recent studies used contact data three-dimensional (3d) genome
reconstructions hi-c (chromosome conformation capture next-generation
sequencing) assess co-localization functional genomic annotations in
the nucleus. analyses dichotomized data point pairs belonging a
functional annotation "close" "far" based threshold tested
for enrichment "close" pairs. propose alternative approach avoids
dichotomization data instead directly estimates significance of
distances within 3d reconstruction.
results: applied approach 3d genome reconstructions plasmodium
falciparum, causative agent malaria, saccharomyces cerevisiae and
compared results previous approaches. found significant 3d
co-localization centromeres, telomeres, virulence genes, several sets of
genes developmentally regulated expression p. falciparum; significant
3d co-localization centromeres long terminal repeats s. cerevisiae.
additionally, tested experimental observation telomeres form three to
seven clusters p. falciparum s. cerevisiae. applying affinity propagation 
clustering telomere coordinates 3d reconstructions yielded six telomere
clusters organisms.
conclusions: distance-based assessment replicated key findings, avoiding
dichotomization data (which previously yielded threshold-sensitive
results).
