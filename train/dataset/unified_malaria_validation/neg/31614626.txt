complications due malaria caused mostly host immunological responses.
plasmodium falciparum subverts host immunity various strategies, including
modulation host immune responses regulating cytokines. the
transcriptional alterations major cytokines immunoregulators analyzed
in study gene expression profiling clinically defined subgroups
of p. falciparum patients. malaria patients included dhalai district
hospital tripura uncomplicated malaria (uc) severe malaria (sm) and
healthy controls endemic non-endemic areas india. qpcr gene
expression analysis performed factors grouped into
three clusters based altered expressions. first cluster was
downregulated increased parasitic burden included t-bet, gata3,
eomes, tgf-β, stat4, stat6 cytokines ifn-γ, il-12, il-4, il-5, il-13.
rantes, il-8, ccr8, cxcr3 decreased sm group. second cluster 
was upregulated severity included tnf-α, il-10, il-1β il-7. pd-1 and
bcl6 increased sm group. third cluster comprised nf-κb was
not altered. level perforin suppressed grb expression was
elevated sm. p. falciparum malaria burden characterized modulation
of host immunity via compromization cell-mediated responses suppression 
of innate immune-regulators.
