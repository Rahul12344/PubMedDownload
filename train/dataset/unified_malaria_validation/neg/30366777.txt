cytochrome p450 2d6 (cyp2d6) responsible metabolic activation of
primaquine, antimalarial drug. cyp2d6 genetically polymorphic, these
polymorphisms associated interindividual variations observed the
therapeutic efficacy primaquine. understand association, we
performed in vitro enzymatic analyses wild-type cyp2d6.1 49 cyp2d6
allelic variants, expressed 293ft cells, using primaquine a
substrate. concentrations cyp2d6 variant holoenzymes measured by
using carbon monoxide (co)-reduced difference spectroscopy, wild type and
27 variants showed peak 450 nm. kinetic parameters km, vmax, and
intrinsic clearance (vmax/km) primaquine 5-hydroxylation characterized.
the kinetic parameters wild type 16 variants measured, the
values remaining 33 variants could determined low
metabolite concentrations. among variants, six (i.e., cyp2d6.17, .18, .35,
.39, .53, .70) showed significantly reduced intrinsic clearance compared with
that cyp2d6.1. three-dimensional structural modeling analysis performed to
elucidate mechanism changes kinetics cyp2d6 variants. our
findings provide insights allele-specific activity cyp2d6 for
primaquine, could clinically useful malaria treatment and
eradication efforts.
