background: continued exposure malaria-causing parasites endemic regions of
malaria induces significant levels acquired immunity adult individuals. a
better understanding transcriptional basis acquired immunological
response may provide insight immune system boosted during
vaccination, infected individuals differ symptomology.
methodology/principal findings: peripheral blood gene expression profiles 9
semi-immune volunteers plasmodium vivax malaria prevalent region
(buenaventura, colombia) compared 7 naïve individuals a
region reported transmission malaria (cali, colombia) a
controlled infection mosquito bite challenge p. vivax. fluidigm nanoscale 
quantitative rt-pcr array used survey altered expression 96 blood
informative transcripts 7 timepoints controlled infection, rnaseq
was used contrast pre-infection early parasitemia timepoints. no
evidence transcriptional changes prior appearance blood stage
parasites day 12 13, time strong interferon response
and, unexpectedly, down-regulation transcripts related inflammation and
innate immunity. differential expression confirmed rnaseq, which
also suggested perturbations aspects cell function erythropoiesis.
despite differences clinical symptoms semi-immune malaria
naïve individuals, subtle differences transcriptomes observed,
although 175 genes showed significantly greater induction repression the
naïve volunteers cali.
conclusion/significance: gene expression profiling whole blood reveals the
type duration immune response p. vivax infection, highlights 
subset genes may mediate adaptive immunity.
