glutathione plays crucial role redox regulation malaria parasite 
plasmodium falciparum linked drug resistance mechanisms, especially 
resistance antimalarial drug chloroquine (cq). determination of
the glutathione-dependent redox potential recently established living
parasites using cytosolically expressed biosensor comprising redox-sensitive
green fluorescent protein coupled human glutaredoxin 1 (hgrx1-rogfp2). in
order elucidate redox changes induced antimalarial drugs to
consolidate application spectrum ratiometric biosensor we
systematically compared methods probing thiol redox metabolism.
among methods cell disruptive non-disruptive approaches including 
spectrophotometric assays ellman's reagent naphthalene dicarboxyaldehyde
as well molecular probes thioltracker™ violet the
dichlorofluorescein-based probe cm-h2dcfda. directly compare methods,
blood stages cq-sensitive p. falciparum 3d7 strain challenged with
the oxidative agent diamide antimalarial drugs artemisinin cq 1h,
4h, 24h. conditions, dose-dependent changes different redox
parameters could monitored compared discussed. furthermore
detected slight differences thiol status parasites transiently transfected 
with hgrx1-rogfp2 comparison control 3d7 cells. conclusion,
thioltracker™ violet and, even so, hgrx1-rogfp2 probe reacted reliably
and sensitively drug induced changes intracellular redox metabolism. 
results substantiated classical cell disruptive methods.
