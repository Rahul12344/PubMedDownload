background: darc (duffy blood group, chemokine receptor) gene encodes a
transmembrane glycoprotein functions chemokine transporter, a
receptor plasmodium vivax p. knowlesi, expresses duffy blood
group antigens (fy). fy(a-b-) phenotype found people african descent is
typically associated -67t>c mutation 5'-untranslated region (utr), 
which prevents red blood cells invaded p. vivax p. knowlesi. aim
of study establish darc allele frequencies african american
blood donor cohort, determine phylogenetic tree darc, compare human and
neandertal darc genes.
study design methods: darc nucleotide sequence 54 african american
blood donors determined genomic dna. heterozygous substitutions were
resolved sequencing haplotype-specific amplifications. phylogenetic tree 
for darc established using neighbor-joining method pan troglodytes
as root.
results: total 108 haplotypes darc gene could unambiguously
determined nucleotide position -300 5' utr +300 3' utr.
eleven different alleles found, including clinically relevant fy*a,
fy*b, fy*b-67c, fy*b298a, fy*x alleles. phenotype predictions based on
genotypes matched serologically determined phenotypes exactly: 52% fy(a-b-), 
28% fy(a-b+), 20% fy(a+b-).
conclusions: nucleotide sequencing approach using one amplicon practical
genotyping method darc allows determination haplotypes even in
heterozygous constellations. developed phylogenetic tree darc alleles
and postulated distinct fy*b allele ancestral extant darc alleles in
humans.
