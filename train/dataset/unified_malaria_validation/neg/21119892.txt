with completion near completion many malaria parasite
genome-sequencing projects, efforts directed better
understanding gene functions discovery vaccine drug targets.
inter- intraspecies comparisons parasite genomes provide
invaluable insights parasite evolution, virulence, drug resistance, and
immune invasion. genome-wide searches loci various selection pressures 
may lead discovery genes conferring drug resistance encoding for
protective antigens. addition, plasmodium falciparum genome sequence
provides basis development various microarrays monitor gene
expression detect nucleotide substitution deletion/amplification.
genome-wide profiling parasite proteome, chromatin modification, and
nucleosome position also depend availability parasite genome. this
brief review, highlight recent advances studies in
characterizing gene function related phenotype p. falciparum were
made possible genome sequence, particularly development a
genome-wide diversity map various high-throughput genotyping methods for
genome-wide association studies (gwas).
