plasmodium parasites employ posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms their
life cycle transitions host cell invasion replication within the
mosquito vector mammalian host. rna binding proteins (rbps) provide one
mechanism modulation rna function. explore role plasmodium rbps 
during parasite replication, searched rbps might play role during
liver stage development, parasite stage exhibits extensive
growth replication. identified parasite ortholog mei2 (meiosis
inhibited 2) rbp conserved among plasmodium species (plasmei2) and
exclusively transcribed liver stage parasites. epitope-tagged plasmodium
yoelii plasmei2 expressed liver stage schizogony showed an
apparent granular cytoplasmic location. knockout plasmei2 (plasmei2(-)) p. 
yoelii affected late liver stage development. p. yoelii plasmei2(-)
liver stage size increased progressively late development, similar to
wild-type parasite development. however, p. yoelii plasmei2(-) liver stage
schizonts exhibited abnormal dna segregation phenotype failed form
exoerythrocytic merozoites. consequently cellular integrity p. yoelii
plasmei2(-) liver stages became increasingly compromised late development 
the majority p. yoelii plasmei2(-) underwent cell death time wild-type 
liver stages mature release merozoites. resulted complete block 
p. yoelii plasmei2(-) transition liver stage blood stage infection in
mice. results show first time importance plasmodium rbp in
the coordinated progression late liver stage schizogony maturation new 
invasive forms.
