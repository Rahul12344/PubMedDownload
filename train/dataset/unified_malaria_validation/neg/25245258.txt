background: anopheles sinensis one important malaria vectors in
china southeast asian countries. high levels resistance been
reported species due long-term use insecticides, especially
pyrethroids, public health agricultural purposes. knockdown resistance
(kdr) caused single base pair mutation gene encoding sodium
channel strongly associated pyrethroid insecticide resistance many
anopheles mosquitoes. methods currently available detecting kdr
mutations an. sinensis.
methods: novel allglo probe-based qpcr (allglo-qpcr) method developed to
screen predominant kdr mutations an. sinensis mosquitoes the
jiangsu province. results allglo-qpcr, allele-specific pcr (as-pcr), and
taqman-mgb probe-based qpcr (taqman-qpcr) compared. comparative analysis
of equipment required, ease use cost available methods also
performed. finally, allglo-qpcr method used detect frequencies 
kdr mutations four provinces central china.
results: six kdr genotypes detected an. sinensis jiangsu
province dna sequencing. allglo-qpcr method detected kdr
genotypes high level accuracy (97% sensitivity 98% specificity).
allglo-qpcr correctly determined kdr genotypes 98.73% 158 an. sinensis 
samples, whereas taqman-qpcr as-pcr correctly identified 96.84% 88.61% of
mutations, respectively. furthermore, allglo-qpcr method simpler to
perform, requires less equipment, exhibits moderate expense cost comparing 
with tested methods kdr mutation detection. samples collected from
four provinces central china showed high frequency kdr
mutation an. sinensis, detected established allglo-qpcr method.
conclusion: novel allglo-qpcr method developed kdr mutation detection 
an. sinensis exhibits greater specificity sensitivity currently
available methods cost-effective; therefore, represents useful
tool entomological surveillance.
