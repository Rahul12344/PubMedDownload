background: artemisinin resistance plasmodium falciparum malaria emerged
in western cambodia. major threat global plans control and
eliminate malaria artemisinins key component antimalarial
treatment throughout world. identify key features associated the
delayed parasite clearance phenotype, employed dna microarrays profile 
physiological gene expression pattern resistant isolates.
results: ring trophozoite stages, observed reduced expression of
many basic metabolic cellular pathways suggests slower growth and
maturation parasites first half asexual
intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (idc). schizont stage, an
increased expression essentially functionalities associated protein
metabolism indicates prolonged thus increased capacity protein
synthesis second half resistant parasite idc. modulation
of p. falciparum intraerythrocytic transcriptome may result differential
expression regulatory proteins transcription factors chromatin
remodeling associated proteins. addition, unique uniform copy
number variation pattern cambodian parasites may represent an
underlying genetic background contributes resistance phenotype.
conclusions: decreased metabolic activities ring stages consistent
with previous suggestions higher resilience early developmental stages 
to artemisinin. moreover, increased capacity protein synthesis protein
turnover schizont stage may contribute artemisinin resistance by
counteracting protein damage caused oxidative stress and/or protein
alkylation effect drug. study reports first global
transcriptional survey artemisinin resistant parasites provides insight to
the complexities molecular basis pathogens drug resistance
phenotypes vivo.
