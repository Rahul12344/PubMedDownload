background: wolbachia endosymbiotic bacteria capable inducing chronic
upregulation insect immune genes situations phenotype may
influence transmission important insect-borne pathogens. however the
molecules involved interactions characterized.
results: show recombinant wolbachia surface protein (wsp) stimulates
increased transcription immune genes mosquito cells derived the
mosquito anopheles gambiae, naturally uninfected wolbachia; at
least two upregulated genes, tep1 apl1, known important in
plasmodium killing species. cells aedes albopictus, is
naturally wolbachia-infected, challenged wsp lower levels of
upregulation observed an. gambiae cells.
conclusions: found wsp strong immune elicitor naturally
wolbachia-uninfected mosquito species (anopheles gambiae) milder elicitor
in naturally-infected species (aedes albopictus). since wsp mosquito
non-native (nematode) wolbachia strain used, data suggest is
a generalized tolerance wsp ae. albopictus.
