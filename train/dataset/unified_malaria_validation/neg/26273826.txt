background: differentiation one life-cycle stage next critical for
survival transmission apicomplexan parasites. number studies have
shown stage differentiation stochastic process associated a
point commits cell change pattern gene expression.
studies differentiation merozoite production (merogony) t. annulata
postulated commitment involves concentration threshold dna binding
proteins auto-regulatory loop.
principal findings: study apiap2 dna binding proteins show changes
in expression level merogony t. annulata identified. dna
motifs bound orthologous domains plasmodium found enriched in
upstream regions stage-regulated t. annulata genes validated targets
for t. annulata ap2 domains electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa).
two findings particular note: gene t. annulata encoding the
orthologue apiap2 domain ap2-g factor commits plasmodium to
gametocyte production, expression profile indicating involvement in
transmission t. annulata tick vector; genes encoding related domains
that bind, predicted bind, sequence motifs type 5'-(a)cacac(a)
are implicated differential regulation gene expression, one gene
(ta11145) likely preferentially up-regulated via auto-regulation the
cell progresses merogony.
conclusions: postulate theileria factor possessing ap2 domain
orthologous plasmodium ap2-g may regulate gametocytogenesis a
similar manner ap2-g. addition, paralogous apiap2 factors recognise
5'-(a)cacac(a) type motifs could operate competitive manner promote
reversible progression towards point commits cell undergo
merogony. factors possessing ap2 domains bind (or predicted bind)
this motif present vector-borne genera theileria, babesia and
plasmodium, apicomplexa; leading proposal mechanisms
that control stage differentiation show degree conservation.
