artemisinin used production "artemisinin combination
therapies" treatment malaria. feeding precursors proven to
be one effective methods enhance artemisinin production plant
cultured cells. current paper, biosynthesis artemisinin (art) and
its four analogs dihydroartemisinic acid (dhaa) suspension-cultured cells
of artemisia annua investigated. arts detected hplc/gc-ms and
isolated various chromatography methods. structures four dhaa
metabolites, namely, dihydro-epi-deoxyarteannuin b, arteannuin i, arteannuin k,
and 3-Î²-hydroxy-dihydro-epi-deoxyarteannuin b, elucidated physicochemical
and spectroscopic analyses. correlation gene expression art
content investigated. results rt-pcr showed dhaa could
up-regulate expression amorpha-4,11-diene synthase gene (ads),
amorpha-4,11-diene c-12 oxidase gene (cyp71av1), farnesyl diphosphate
synthase gene (fps) (3.19-, 7.21-, 2.04-fold higher control
group, resp.), indicated biosynthesis processes dhaa art 
enzyme-mediated.
