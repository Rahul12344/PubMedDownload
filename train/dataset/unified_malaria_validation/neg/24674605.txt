background: result extensive chloroquine resistance (cqr) plasmodium
falciparum late 1990s, ethiopia replaced cq sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine
(sp) first-line drug, turn replaced artemisinin combination
therapy 2004. plasmodium falciparum resistance cq determined the
mutation k76t p. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) 
gene. understanding diversity p. falciparum genome crucial since has
the potential influence important phenotypes parasite drug
resistance. limited data available regarding type pfcrt mutant allelic 
type, effect cq withdrawal diversity parasite population in
south-central oromia, ethiopia.
methods: finger-pricked blood spotted whatman 3mm filter papers collected
from falciparum malaria patients. parasite dna extracted individual
blood spots filter papers. presence k76t mutations determined
using nested pcr isolates. complete sequencing mutations pfcrt
72-76 done set randomly selected resistant isolates. four
microsatellite (ms) markers analysed determine heterozygosity.
results: although cq withdrawn decade, 100% parasites 
still carried pfcrt k76t mutation. isolates mutant k76t
polymorphism. based combinations ms markers, seven different ethiopian cqr 
variants (e1-e7) identified. heterozygosity (h(e)) ms flanking pfcrt
chloroquine resistance allele ranged 0.00 (mscrt -29, -29.268 kb) 0.21
(mscrt -2, -2.814 kb). h(e) ranged 0.00 (msint 3, 0 kb) 0.19 (msint 2, 0 
kb) ms within pfcrt gene. intronic ms flanking pfcrt gene
showed low levels diversity.
conclusion: pfcrt cqr allele seems fixed study area. the
different haplotypes associated cqr, cviet genotype identified.
no reversal wild-type occurred ethiopia unlike many africa
countries cqr parasites declined cessation cq use. decreased
diversity cqr isolates surrounding pfcrt suggests cq selection and
homogenization among cqr parasite population. mutation msint 3 mscrt
-29 mutant pfcrt allele fixed, seems mutations msint 2
and mscrt -2 still evolving may indicate start re-diversification 
of population fixed 76 population.
