chloroquine (cq) resistance plasmodium falciparum determined the
mutations chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene. point
mutation codon 76 (k76t), observed 91% p.
falciparum isolates india, major determinant cq resistance. to
overcome limitations challenges traditional methods, this
investigation developed easy use loop mediated isothermal amplification 
(lamp) protocol rapid detection k76t mutation associated cq
resistance p. falciparum naked eye visualization. in- house designed
primers synthesized optimized specifically distinguish cq
resistant mutants p. falciparum. lamp reaction optimal 61 °c for
60 min calcein dye added prior amplification enable visual
detection. demonstrate detection limit <2 ng/μl respectively,
supporting high sensitivity calcein based lamp method. best of
our knowledge first report establishment easy, reliable 
and cost effective lamp assay rapid specific detection highly cq
resistance p. falciparum malaria.
