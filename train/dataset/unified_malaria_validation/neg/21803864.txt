coordinated regulation gene expression hallmark plasmodium
falciparum asexual blood-stage development cycle. report carbon
catabolite repressor protein 4 (ccr4)-associated factor 1 (caf1) critical in
regulating 1,000 genes malaria parasites' intraerythrocytic
stages, especially egress invasion proteins. caf1 knockout results in
mistimed expression, aberrant accumulation localization proteins involved 
in parasite egress, invasion new host cells, leading premature release 
of predominantly half-finished merozoites, drastically reducing the
intraerythrocytic growth rate parasite. study demonstrates caf1 
of ccr4-not complex significant gene regulatory mechanism needed for
plasmodium development within human host.
