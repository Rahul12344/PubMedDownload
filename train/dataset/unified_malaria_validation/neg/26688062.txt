malaria tropical disease significant morbidity mortality. better 
understanding metabolism important etiological agent,
plasmodium falciparum, paramount development better treatment and
other mitigation measures. farnesyldiphosphate synthase/geranylgeranyldiphosphate
synthase (fpps/ggpps) key enzyme synthesis isoprenic chains
present many essential structures. p. falciparum, well handful of
other organisms, fpps/ggpps shown bifunctional enzyme. by
genetic tagging microscopy, observed changing localization fpps/ggpps
in blood stage parasites. given great importance alternative splicing 
other transcriptional phenomena gene regulation generation protein 
diversity, investigated processing fpps/ggpps transcript p.
falciparum high-throughput sequencing methods four time-points along the
intraerythrocytic cycle p. falciparum. identified levels transcript
diversity order magnitude higher previously observed organism,
as well stage-specific splicing events. data suggest that
alternative splicing p. falciparum important feature gene regulation
and generation protein diversity.
