malaria responsible 1.5 million deaths year, especially
among children (snow et al. 2005). despite severity malaria situation
and great effort development new drug targets (yuan et al. 2011) 
is still relative low investment toward antimalarial drugs. briefly are
targets classes antimalarial drugs currently tested including: kinases, 
proteases, ion channel gpcr, nuclear receptor, among others (gamo et al.
2010). review malaria signal transduction pathways red blood cells
(rbc) well infected rbcs endothelial cells interactions, namely
cytoadherence. last process thought play important role the
pathogenesis severe malaria. molecules displayed surface both
infected erythrocytes (ie) vascular endothelial cells (ec) exert themselves
as important mediators cytoadherence, induce structural 
and metabolic changes sides, also trigger multiple signal
transduction processes, leading alteration gene expression, the
balance positive negative regulation determining endothelial
