background: small fraction mosquito species genus anopheles 
are able transmit malaria, one biggest killer diseases poverty,
which mostly prevalent tropics. diversity genetic, yet
unknown, causes. attempt contribute elucidation these
variances, international "anopheles genomes cluster consortium" project
(a.k.a. "16 anopheles genomes project") established, aiming a
comprehensive genomic analysis several anopheline species, are
malaria vectors. frame international consortium carrying this
project team studied genes encoding families non-coding rnas (ncrnas),
concentrating four classes: microrna (mirna), ribosomal rna (rrna), small
nuclear rna (snrna), particular small nucleolar rna (snorna) and, finally,
transfer rna (trna).
results: analysis carried using, exclusively, computational
approaches, evaluating primary ngs reads well respective
genome assemblies produced consortium stored vectorbase; moreover, 
the results rnaseq surveys cases available and
meaningful also accessed order obtain supplementary data, were
"pre-genomic era" sequence data stored nucleic acid databases. the
investigation included identification analysis, species studied, 
of ncrna genes belonging several families, well analysis the
evolutionary relations genes cross-comparisons other
members genus anopheles.
conclusions: study led identification members gene
families majority twenty different anopheline taxa. set tools 
the study evolution molecular biology important disease vectors
has, thus, obtained.
