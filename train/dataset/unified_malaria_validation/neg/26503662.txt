the evolutionary selection malaria parasites within individual hosts an
important factor emergence drug resistance still well
understood. examined selection process drug resistance the
mouse malaria agent plasmodium berghei compared dynamics selection
for atovaquone pyrimethamine. resistance drugs shown 
associated genetic lesions dihydrofolate reductase gene case
of pyrimethamine mitochondrial cytochrome b gene atovaquone. a
mouse malaria model selection drug resistance, based repeated
incomplete treatment (rict) therapeutic dose antimalarial drugs, was
established. number treatment cycles development stable
resistance atovaquone (2.47 ± 0.70; n = 19) found significantly
lower pyrimethamine (5.44 ± 1.46; n = 16; p < 0.0001), even the
parental p. berghei leiden strain cloned prior resistance selection.
similar results obtained p. berghei edinburgh. mutational changes
underlying resistance identified s110n dihydrofolate reductase 
for pyrimethamine y268n, y268c, y268s, l271v-k272r, g280d cytochrome b
for atovaquone. results consistent rate mitochondrial dna
mutation higher nucleus suggest mutation leading 
to pyrimethamine resistance rare event.
