artemisinins rapidly acting currently available antimalarial
drugs. artesunate become treatment choice severe malaria, and
artemisinin-based combination therapies (acts) foundation modern
falciparum malaria treatment globally. safety tolerability profile is
excellent. unfortunately, plasmodium falciparum infections mutations 
'k13' gene, reduced ring-stage susceptibility artemisinins, slow
parasite clearance patients treated acts, widespread southeast
asia. review clinical efficacy data region (2000-2015) provides 
strong evidence loss first-line acts western cambodia, first
artesunate-mefloquine dha-piperaquine, attributed primarily to
k13 mutated parasites. ring-stage activity artemisinins therefore
critical sustained efficacy acts; lost, rapid selection 
partner drug resistance act failure inevitable consequences. consensus
methods monitoring artemisinin resistance available. despite
increased investment regional control activities, acts failing across an
expanding area greater mekong subregion. although multiple k13 mutations
have arisen independently, successful multidrug-resistant parasite genotypes 
taking threaten spread india africa. stronger containment
efforts new approaches sustaining long-term efficacy antimalarial
regimens needed prevent global malaria emergency.
