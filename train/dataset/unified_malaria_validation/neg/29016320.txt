antibody responses chlamydia trachomatis (ct) antigens may useful tools for
surveillance trachoma estimating cumulative prevalence infection within 
a population. data compared three different platforms-multiplex bead
array (mba), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), lateral flow assay
(lfa)-measuring antibody responses ct antigen protein plasmid gene
product 3 (pgp3). sensitivity defined proportion specimens testing 
antibody positive set dried blood spots tanzanian 1-9-year olds
who positive ct nucleic acid nucleic acid amplification test
(naat)-positive individuals (n = 103). sensitivity lfa could be
determined use dried blood spots test; specimen
type yet adapted lfa. specificity defined proportion of
sera u.s. bolivian 1-9-year olds previously tested negative 
the chlamydia microimmunofluorescence (mif) assay testing negative to
pgp3-specific antibodies (n = 154). sensitivity mba elisa the
same-93.2 (95% confidence interval [ci]: 88.3-98.1). specificity ranged across
platforms 96.1 (95% ci: 91.8-98.2) 99.4% (95% ci: 98.2-100). elisa
performance similar regardless whether plates precoated or
freshly coated antigen. sensitivity specificity control panels were
similar cutoff determined using receiver operator curves finite
mixture model, cutoffs differed approximately 0.5 od using 
the different methodologies. platforms show good sensitivity and
specificity show good agreement tests population level, but
indicate variability elisa outcomes depending cutoff determination
methodology.
