resistance plasmodium spp. anti-malarial drugs primary obstacle in
the fight malaria, molecular markers drug resistance have
been applied adjunct surveillance resistance. study, 
we investigated prevalence mutations pvmdr1, pvcrt-o, pvdhfr, and
pvdhps genes temperate-zone p. vivax parasites central china. total 
26 isolates selected, including 8 previously shown a
lower susceptibility chloroquine vitro. pvmdr1, pvcrt-o, pvdhps
genes, resistance-conferring mutations discovered. however, highly
prevalent (69.2%), single-point mutation (s117n) found pvdhfr gene. in
addition, tandem repeat polymorphisms existed pvdhfr pvdhps genes, which
warranted studies relation parasite resistance antifolate
drugs. study suggests p. vivax populations central china may 
still relatively susceptible chloroquine sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.
