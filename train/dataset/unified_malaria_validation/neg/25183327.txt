objective: study genetic diversity msp-1, msp-2, glurp genes of
plasmodium falciparum (p. falciparum) isolates 3 endemic areas thailand: 
tak, kanchanaburi ranong provinces.
methods: total 144 p. falciparum isolates collected prior treatment
during january, 2012 june, 2013 genotyped. dna extracted; allele
frequency diversity msp-1, msp-2, glurp genes investigated by
nested polymerase chain reaction.
results: p. falciparum isolates study high rate multiple genotypes
infection (96.5%) overall mean multiplicity infection 3.21. the
distribution allelic families msp-1 significantly different among
isolates tak, kanchanaburi, ranong msp-2. k1 mad20
were predominant allelic families msp-1 gene, whereas alleles
belonging 3d7 frequent msp-2 gene. glurp gene the
least diverse alleles. population structure p. falciparum isolates tak
and ranong quite similar revealed presence similar proportions
of mad20 k1 alleles msp-1 loci, 3d7 fc27 alleles msp-2 loci well
as comparable mean moi. isolates kanchanaburi different structures; 
most prevalent alleles k1 ro33.
conclusions: present study shows p. falciparum isolates tak and
ranong provinces similar allelic pattern msp-1 msp-2 diversity but
different kanchanaburi isolates. allelic variant profiles valuable
baseline data future epidemiological study malaria transmission for
continued monitoring polymorphisms associated antimalarial drug
resistance areas.
