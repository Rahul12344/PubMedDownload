the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum invades, replicates within and
destroys red blood cells asexual blood stage life cycle responsible
for clinical disease crucial parasite propagation. invasive malaria
merozoites possess characteristic apical complex secretory organelles that
are discharged tightly controlled highly regulated order during
merozoite egress host cell invasion. prominent organelles, 
the rhoptries, twinned, club-shaped structures body bulb region
that tapers narrow neck meets apical prominence merozoite. 
different protein populations localise rhoptry bulb neck, the
function many proteins spatially segregated within
the rhoptries unknown. using conditional disruption gene encoding the
only known glycolipid-anchored malarial rhoptry bulb protein, rhoptry-associated 
membrane antigen (rama), demonstrate rama indispensable blood
stage parasite survival. contrary previous suggestions, rama required
for trafficking rhoptry bulb proteins. instead, rama-null parasites
display selective mislocalisation subset rhoptry bulb neck proteins
(rons) produce dysmorphic rhoptries lack distinct neck region. the
mutant parasites undergo normal intracellular development egress display 
a fatal defect invasion induce echinocytosis target red blood
cells. results indicate distinct pathways regulate biogenesis two
main rhoptry sub-compartments malaria parasite.
