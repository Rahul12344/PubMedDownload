immunization malaria parasites developmentally arrest immediately
after liver stage way currently known confer sterilizing
immunity humans rodent models. various ways attenuate
parasite development resulting different timings arrest, a
significant impact vaccination efficiency. understand impacts
vaccination efficiency, newly developed gain-of-function methods used 
to generate wide array differently attenuated parasites. combination 
multiple attenuation approaches offers potential engineer efficiently
attenuated plasmodium parasites learn fascinating biology 
same time. discuss recent studies potential targeted parasite 
manipulation using genome editing develop live attenuated malaria vaccines.
