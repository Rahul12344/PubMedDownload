background: plasmodium knowlesi simian malaria parasite been
identified cause malaria humans. date, several thousand cases human
knowlesi malaria reported around southeast asia. thus far, 
detailed study genetic diversity natural selection p. knowlesi
circumsporozoite protein (csp), prominent surface antigen sporozoite 
the parasite. present study, genetic diversity natural selection
acting nonrepeat regions gene encoding p. knowlesi csp were
investigated, focusing t-cell epitope regions c-terminal the
protein.
methods: blood samples 32 knowlesi malaria patients 2 wild monkeys
(macaca fascicularis) used. csp p. knowlesi isolates was
amplified pcr, cloned escherichia coli, sequenced. nonrepeat
regions csp gene analysed genetic diversity, natural selection
and haplotypic grouping using mega5 dnasp version 5.10.00 programmes. a
haplotype network constructed based c-terminal (th2r/th3r) t-cell
epitope regions using median-joining method network version 4.6.1.2
programme. previously published sequences regions (malaysia borneo,
singapore) also included analysis.
results: total 123 p. knowlesi csp sequences analysed. multiple
sequence alignment revealed 58 amino acid changes, 42 novel amino acid
haplotypes identified. polymorphism higher c-terminal th2r/th3r
epitope (π = 0.0293, n = 123) region compared overall combined nonrepeat
regions (π = 0.0120, n = 123). negative natural selection observed within the
nonrepeat regions csp gene. within c-terminal th2r/th3r epitope
regions, evidence slight positive selection. based haplotype
network analysis th2r/th3r regions, five abundant haplotypes were
identified. sharing haplotypes humans macaques observed.
conclusion: study contributes understanding type and
distribution naturally occurring polymorphism p. knowlesi csp gene.
this study also provides measurement genetic diversity p. knowlesi
and identifies predominant haplotypes within malaysia based c-terminal
th2r/th3r regions.
