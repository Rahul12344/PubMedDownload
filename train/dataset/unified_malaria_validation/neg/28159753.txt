there need new interventions ongoing burden vector-borne 
diseases malaria dengue. one suggestion develop genes
encoding effector molecules block parasite development within vector,
and use nuclease-based homing reaction form gene drive spread
those genes target populations. effector gene reduces fitness 
of mosquito contribute drive, loss-of-function
mutations effector eventually replace functional copies, but
protection may nonetheless persist sufficiently long provide public health
benefit. here, present quantitative model allowing one predict the
duration protection function probabilities different molecular 
processes homing reaction, various fitness effects, efficacy
of effector blocking transmission. factors increase duration of
protection include reducing frequency pre-existing resistant alleles, 
probability nonrecombinational dna repair, probability of
homing-associated loss effector, fitness costs nuclease and
effector, completeness parasite blocking. target species that
extend area much larger typical dispersal distance, duration
of protection expected highest release site, decrease away
from there, eventually falling zero, effector-less drive constructs replace
effector-containing ones. also model alternative strategy using the
nuclease target essential gene, linking effector sequence
that restores essential function resistant nuclease. depending 
upon parameter values, approach prolong duration protection. 
models highlight key design criteria needed achieve desired level of
public health benefit.
