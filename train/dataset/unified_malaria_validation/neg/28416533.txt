to capture transcriptional dynamics within proliferating cells, methods to
differentiate nascent transcription preexisting mrnas desired. one
approach label newly synthesized mrna transcripts vivo the
incorporation modified pyrimidines. however, human malaria parasite,
plasmodium falciparum, incapable pyrimidine salvage mrna biogenesis. to
capture cellular mrna dynamics plasmodium development, engineered
parasites salvage pyrimidines expression single
bifunctional yeast fusion gene, cytosine deaminase/uracil
phosphoribosyltransferase (fcu). show expression fcu allows the
direct incorporation thiol-modified pyrimidines nascent mrnas. using
developmental stage-specific promoters express fcu-gfp enables the
biosynthetic capture in-depth analysis mrna dynamics subpopulations
of cells undergoing differentiation. demonstrate utility method by
examining transcriptional dynamics sexual gametocyte stage transition,
a process essential malaria transmission hosts. using the
pfs16 gametocyte-specific promoter express fcu-gfp 3d7 parasites, found 
that sexual stage commitment governed transcriptional reprogramming and
stabilization subset essential gametocyte transcripts. also measured
mrna dynamics f12 gametocyte-deficient parasites demonstrate the
transcriptional program required sexual commitment maturation is
initiated likely aborted due absence pfap2-g transcriptional
regulator lack gametocyte-specific mrna stabilization. biosynthetic
labeling plasmodium mrnas incredibly versatile, used measure
transcriptional dynamics stage parasite development, allow for
future applications comprehensively measure rna-protein interactions the
malaria parasite.
