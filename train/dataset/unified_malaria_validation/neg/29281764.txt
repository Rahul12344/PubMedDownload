host immune response key role controlling progression malaria
infection. well-established murine model experimental cerebral malaria 
(ecm) plasmodium berghei anka infection, proinflammatory th1 cd8+ cell
response essential disease development. interferon regulatory factor 1
(irf1) transcription factor promotes th1 responses, absence was
previously shown protect ecm death. yet exact mechanism protection
remains unknown. demonstrated irf1-deficient mice (irf1 knockout)
were protected ecm death despite displaying early neurological signs.
resistance ecm death result reduced parasite sequestration and
pathogenic cd8+ cells brain. analysis revealed irf1
deficiency suppress interferon-γ production delayed cd8+ cell
proliferation. cxcr3 expression found decreased pathogenic cd8+ t
cells, limited migration brain. addition, reduced
expression adhesion molecules brain endothelial cells hampered leucocyte
retention brain. taken together, factors limited sequestration of
pathogenic cd8+ cells consequently ability induce extensive damage
to blood-brain barrier.
