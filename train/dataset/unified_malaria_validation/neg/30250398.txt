falciparum plasmodium vivax, recently zoonotic parasite, plasmodium
knowlesi, identified countries region. presence of
this parasite poses challenge malaria control programmes, is
maintained zoonotic reservoir forest-dwelling macaque monkeys.
methods: cross-sectional malaria parasite species prevalence survey was
conducted along laos-vietnam border central part two countries.
human blood samples collected savannakhet laos quang tri in
vietnam august october 2010 assayed presence human
malaria parasite species p. knowlesi. pcr targeting 18s small subunit
ribosomal rna gene circumsporozoite protein gene used plasmodium
species identification.
results: nine cases p. knowlesi detected pcr blood samples the
laos side three vietnam side. p. knowlesi infections found 
in co-infection p. vivax, triple infections p. knowlesi, p.
vivax p. falciparum detected laos. phylogenetic analysis these
