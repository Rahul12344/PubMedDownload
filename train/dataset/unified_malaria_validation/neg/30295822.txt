background: southeast asia, plasmodium knowlesi, parasite long-tailed
macaques (macaca fascicularis), important cause human malaria.
plasmodium cynomolgi also commonly infects monkeys, one naturally 
acquired symptomatic human case reported previously.
methods: malariometric studies involving 5422 subjects (aged 6 months 65
years) conducted 23 villages pailin battambang, western cambodia. 
parasite detection genotyping conducted blood samples, using
high-volume quantitative pcr (upcr).
results: asymptomatic malaria parasite infections detected 1361 14732 
samples (9.2%). asymptomatic infections nonhuman primate malaria parasites
were found 21 individuals living close forested areas; p. cynomolgi was
found 11, p. knowlesi found 8, p. vivax p. cynomolgi 
found 2. 2 subjects female, 14 men aged 20-40 years.
geometric mean parasite densities 3604 parasites/ml p. cynomolgi
infections 52488 parasites/ml p. knowlesi infections. p. cynomolgi
isolates wild-type dihydrofolate reductase genes, contrast very
high prevalence mutations human malaria parasites. asymptomatic
reappearance p. cynomolgi occurred 2 subjects 3 months first
infection.
conclusions: asymptomatic naturally acquired p. cynomolgi p. knowlesi
infections occur humans.
clinical trials registration: nct01872702.
