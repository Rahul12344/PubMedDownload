low efficiency often observed delivery dna vaccines. use of
superparamagnetic nanoparticles (spions) deliver genes via magnetofection
could improve transfection efficiency target vector desired
locality. here, magnetofection used enhance delivery malaria dna 
vaccine encoding plasmodium yoelii merozoite surface protein msp1(19)
(vr1020-pymsp1(19)) plays critical role plasmodium immunity. the
plasmid dna (pdna) containing membrane associated 19-kda carboxyl-terminal
fragment merozoite surface protein 1 (pymsp1(19)) conjugated with
superparamagnetic nanoparticles coated polyethyleneimine (pei) polymer, with
different molar ratio pei nitrogen dna phosphate. reported effects
of spions-pei complexation ph values properties resulting
particles, including ability condense dna gene expression in
vitro. initially lowering ph value spions-pei complexes 2.0, the
size complexes decreased since pei contained large number amino
groups became increasingly protonated acidic condition, the
electrostatic repulsion inducing less aggregation. reaggregation was
prevented phs complexes increased 4.0 7.0,
respectively, dna addition. spions/pei complexes ph 4.0 showed better
binding capability pymsp1(19) gene-containing pdna neutral ph,
despite negligible differences size surface charge the
complexes. study indicated ability protect dna molecules due 
the structure polymer acidic ph could help improve transfection
efficiency. transfection efficiency magnetic nanoparticle carrier for
malaria dna vaccine vitro eukaryotic cells, indicated via pymsp1(19)
expression, significantly enhanced application external magnetic
field, cytotoxicity comparable benchmark nonviral reagent
(lipofectamine 2000).
