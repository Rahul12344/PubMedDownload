background: next generation sequencing (ngs) technology revolutionized
genomic genetic research. pace change area rapid three
major new sequencing platforms released 2011: ion torrent's pgm,
pacific biosciences' rs illumina miseq. compare results
obtained platforms performance illumina hiseq, the
current market leader. order compare platforms, get sufficient
coverage depth allow meaningful analysis, sequenced set 4
microbial genomes mean gc content ranging 19.3 67.7%. together,
these represent comprehensive range genome content. report our
analysis sequence data terms coverage distribution, bias, gc
distribution, variant detection accuracy.
results: sequence generated ion torrent, miseq pacific biosciences
technologies displays near perfect coverage behaviour gc-rich, neutral and
moderately at-rich genomes, profound bias observed upon sequencing 
extremely at-rich genome plasmodium falciparum pgm, resulting no
coverage approximately 30% genome. analysed ability call
variants platform found could call slightly variants
from ion torrent data compared miseq data, expense higher
false positive rate. variant calling pacific biosciences data possible
but higher coverage depth required. context specific errors observed 
both pgm miseq data, pacific biosciences platform.
conclusions: three fast turnaround sequencers evaluated able to
generate usable sequence. however key differences quality
of data applications support.
