differentiation extracellular leishmania promastigotes within sand fly
vector, termed metacyclogenesis, considered essential parasites to
regain mammalian host infectivity. metacyclogenesis accompanied changes 
the local parasite environment, including secretion complex glycoconjugates
within promastigote secretory gel colonization degradation the
sand fly stomodeal valve. deletion stage-regulated hasp sherp genes on
chromosome 23 leishmania major known stall metacyclogenesis sand 
fly vitro culture. here, parasite mutants deficient specific
genes within hasp/sherp chromosomal region used investigate
their role metacyclogenesis, parasite transmission establishment of
infection. metacyclogenesis stalled hasp/sherp mutants vivo and,
although still capable osmotaxis, mutants failed secrete promastigote
secretory gel, correlating lack parasite accumulation thoracic
midgut failure colonise stomodeal valve. defects prevented
parasite transmission new mammalian host. sand fly midgut homogenates
modulated parasite behaviour vitro, suggesting role molecular
interactions parasite vector leishmania development within the
sand fly. first time, stage-regulated expression small haspa
proteins leishmania (leishmania) demonstrated: haspa2 expressed
only extracellular promastigotes haspa1 intracellular amastigotes.
despite lack expression amastigotes, replacement haspa2 the
null locus background delays onset pathology balb/c mice. this
haspa2-dependent effect reversed haspa1 gene addition, suggesting 
haspas may role host immunomodulation.
