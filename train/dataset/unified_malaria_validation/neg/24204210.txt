molecular interactions male female factors mating profoundly
affect reproductive behavior physiology female insects. natural
populations malaria mosquito anopheles gambiae, blood-fed females direct
nutritional resources towards oogenesis inseminated. show 
the mating-dependent pathway egg development mosquitoes regulated 
by interaction steroid hormone 20-hydroxy-ecdysone (20e)
transferred males copulation female mating-induced stimulator 
oogenesis (miso) protein. rnai silencing miso abolishes increase in
oogenesis caused mating blood-fed females, causes delay oocyte
development, impairs function male-transferred 20e.
co-immunoprecipitation experiments show miso 20e interact female 
reproductive tract. moreover miso expression mating induced 20e via
the ecdysone receptor, demonstrating close cooperation two factors.
male-transferred 20e therefore acts mating signal females translate
into increased investment egg development via miso-dependent pathway. the
identification male-female reproductive interaction offers novel
opportunities control mosquito populations transmit malaria.
