purpose: low content artemisinin related biosynthetic pathway is
influenced role certain enzymes formation artemisinin. the
regulation genes involved artemisinin biosynthesis genetic
engineering choice enhance content. research aims transform
ads p19 gene antisilencing artemisia annua see their
effects artemisinin production. methods: presence p19 ads genes was
confirmed polymerase chain reaction (pcr) products sequencing
analysis. plasmids, contain ads and/or p19 genes, transformed into
agrobacterium tumefaciens, inserted leaves hairy roots a.
annua vacuum syringe infiltration methods. successful transformation
was checked gus histochemical test pcr analysis. artemisinin 
levels measured using hplc. results: percentages blue area on
leaves using vacuum syringe infiltration method hairy roots up
to 98, 92.55%, 99.00% respectively. ads-p19 sample contained higher
level artemisinin (0.18%) compared samples. transformed hairy root
with co-transformation ads-p19 contained 0.095% artemisinin, no
artemisinin found control hairy root. transformation ads and
p19 genes a. annua plant successfully done could enhance the
artemisinin content transformed leaves ads-p19 2.57 folds
compared untransformed leaves, p19, cotransformed ads were
up 2.25, 1.29, 1.14 folds respectively. conclusion: antisilencing p19 gene
could enhance transformation efficiency ads artemisinin level a.
annua.
