in brazilian amazon region, malaria caused plasmodium malariae is
considered zoonosis cross-transfer parasite between
humans neotropical primates. contribute information issue, we
investigated occurrences natural infection plasmodium sp. among
neotropical primates maranhense amazon (amazon region state of
maranhão), northeastern region brazil. blood samples collected
from 161 neotropical primates six species caught environmental
reserve (sítio aguahy) captive primates (cetas-wildlife screening
center, municipality são luís), maranhão. plasmodium sp. diagnosed
based light microscopy, pcr, qpcr lamp amplification 18s rrna
gene. serum samples also assayed means indirect immunofluorescence for
igg antibodies p. malariae/p. brasilianum, p. falciparum p. berghei. 
parasites detected light microscopy five slides captive
primates (four sapajus spp. one callithrix jacchus). molecular tests, 
34.16% (55/161) 29.81% (48/161) animals sampled positive the
qpcr pcr assays, respectively. pcr, 47/48 animals positive p.
malariae/p. brasilianum; these, eight free-living primates 39 from
cetas, são luís. one sample showed band genus-specific reaction, not
in second pcr reaction. anti-p. malariae/p. brasilianum igg antibodies were
detected four serum samples sapajus spp. captivity. study,
circulation p. malariae/p. brasilianum neotropical primates confirmed, 
with low levels parasitemia low levels antibodies. importance of
these animals reservoirs human malaria region studied still
unknown. scenario impact control elimination malaria in
this region.
