plasmodium parasites exposed endogenous exogenous oxidative stress
during complex life cycle. minimize oxidative damage, parasites use 
glutathione (gsh) thioredoxin (trx) primary antioxidants. previously
showed disruption plasmodium berghei gamma-glutamylcysteine
synthetase (pbggcs-ko) glutathione reductase (pbgr-ko) genes resulted a
significant reduction gsh intraerythrocytic stages, defect growth 
in pbggcs-ko parasites. report, time course experiments parasite
intraerythrocytic development morphological studies showed growth delay
during ring schizont progression. morphological analysis shows a
significant reduction size (diameter) trophozoites schizonts with
increased number cytoplasmic vacuoles pbggcs-ko parasites comparison
to wild type (wt). furthermore, pbggcs-ko mutants exhibited impaired
response oxidative stress increased levels nuclear dna (ndna) damage.
reduced gsh levels result mitochondrial dna (mtdna) damage protein 
carbonylations neither pbggcs-ko pbgr-ko parasites. addition, the
pbggcs-ko mutant parasites showed increase mrna expression genes
involved oxidative stress detoxification dna synthesis, suggesting a
potential compensatory mechanism allow parasite proliferation. these
results reveal low gsh levels affect parasite development the
impairment oxidative stress reduction systems damage ndna. our
studies provide new insights role gsh antioxidant system the
intraerythrocytic development plasmodium parasites, potential translation
into novel pharmacological interventions.
