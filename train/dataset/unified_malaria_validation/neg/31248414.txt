background: malaria eradication globally yet achieved transmission
is sustained many endemic countries. plasmodium falciparum continues to
develop resistance currently available anti-malarial drugs, posing great
problems malaria elimination. study evaluates frequencies of
asymptomatic infection multidrug resistance-1 (mdr-1) gene mutations in
parasite isolates, form basis understanding persistently high
incidence south west, nigeria.
methods: total 535 individuals aged 6 months screened the
epidemiological survey evaluating asymptomatic transmission. parasite prevalence 
was determined histidine-rich protein ii rapid detection kit (rdt) healthy 
individuals. plasmodium falciparum mdr-1 gene mutations detected by
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) followed restriction enzyme digest and
electrophoresis determine polymorphism parasite isolates. sequencing was
done confirm polymorphism. proportions compared using chi-square test 
p value < 0.05.
results: malaria parasites detected rdt 204 (38.1%) individuals.
asymptomatic infection detected 117 (57.3%) symptomatic malaria
confirmed 87 individuals (42.6%). overall, individuals detectable malaria
by rdt significantly higher individuals symptoms, 87 197 (44.2%), 
than asymptomatic persons; 117 338 (34.6%), p = 0.02. sub-set 75
isolates, 18(24%) 14 (18.6%) individuals pfmdr1 86y 1246y mutations.
conclusions: still high malaria transmission rate nigeria higher
incidence asymptomatic infections. parasites harbour mutations pfmdr1
which contribute artemisinin partner drug resistance; surveillance strategies 
to reduce spread drug resistance endemic areas needed eliminate 
the reservoir malaria parasites mitigate eradication malaria
in nigeria.
