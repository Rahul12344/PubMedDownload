conditional cell death systems useful various aspects basic science
with wide range applications, including genetic pest control. recently
demonstrated expression mammalian pro-apoptotic factor, b-cell
leukaemia/lymphoma 2-associated x protein (bax), induce apoptosis specific
tissues using tissue specific promoters silkworm mosquito. here, we
newly identified functional promoter asian malaria vector, anopheles
stephensi, enables gene expression specifically testis. produced 
a transgenic mosquito line expresses mouse bax control this
testis-specific promoter. transgenic mosquito males exhibited aberrant testes
without functional sperm complete sterility, whereas transgenic females
maintained normal fecundity. despite abnormal testes, transgenic males 
maintained normal function male accessory glands typical mating behaviour.
as result mating males, females showed refractoriness 
mating. results suggest transgenic males induce female sterility via
mating. mosquito one important disease vectors, the
control population benefits global public health. thus, this
bax-mediated synthetic male-specific sterilization system could applied to
population control mosquitoes.
