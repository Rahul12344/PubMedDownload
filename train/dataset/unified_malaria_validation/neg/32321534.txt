background: malaria control tanzania currently relies primarily on
long-lasting insecticidal nets indoor residual spraying, alongside effective 
case management behaviour change communication. study explored opinions 
of key stakeholders national progress towards malaria elimination, the
potential currently available vector control interventions helping achieve 
elimination 2030, need alternative interventions could be
used supplement malaria elimination efforts tanzania.
methods: exploratory qualitative study, focus group discussions held
with policy-makers, regulators, research scientists community members.
malaria control interventions discussed were: (a) improved housing, (b) larval
source management, (c) mass drug administration (mda) ivermectin reduce
vector densities, (d) release modified mosquitoes, including genetically
modified irradiated mosquitoes, (e) targeted spraying mosquito swarms, 
(f) spatial repellents.
results: larval source management spatial repellents widely supported
across stakeholder groups, insecticide-spraying mosquito swarms 
the least preferred. support mda ivermectin high among policy
makers, regulators research scientists, encountered opposition among
community members, instead expressed strong support programmes improve
housing poor people high transmission areas. policy makers, however,
challenged idea government-supported housing improvement due its
perceived high costs. techniques mosquito modification, specifically those
involving gene drives, viewed positively community members, policy makers
and regulators, encountered high degree scepticism among scientists.
overall, policy-makers, regulators community members trusted scientists to
provide appropriate advice decision-making.
conclusion: stakeholder opinions regarding alternative malaria interventions were
divergent except larval source management spatial repellents, which
there universal support. mda ivermectin, housing improvement and
modified mosquitoes also widely supported, though faced concerns from
at least one stakeholder group. policy-makers, regulators community
members noted reliance scientists make informed decisions, 
reasoning benefits disadvantages specific interventions included
factors beyond technical efficiency. study suggests need encourage
and strengthen dialogue research scientists, policy makers, regulators
and communities regarding new interventions.
