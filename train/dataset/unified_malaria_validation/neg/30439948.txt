malaria parasites remodel host erythrocytes gain nutrients avoid the
immune system. host erythrocytes modified hundreds effector proteins
exported parasite host cell. protein export mediated 
ptex translocon comprising five core components exp2 considered to
form putative pore spans vacuole membrane enveloping parasite
within erythrocyte. explore function importance exp2 for
parasite survival asexual blood stage plasmodium falciparum we
inducibly knocked expression exp2. reduction exp2 expression
strongly reduced parasite growth proportional degree protein knockdown 
and tended stall development half way asexual cell cycle.
once knockdown inducer removed exp2 expression restored, parasite
growth recovered dependent upon length degree knockdown. establish 
exp2 function hence basis growth reduction, trafficking an
exported protein monitored following exp2 knockdown. resulted severe 
attenuation protein export consistent exp2, ptex general,
being conduit export proteins host compartment.
