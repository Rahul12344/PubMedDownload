hemocytes tiny circulating blood cells insects known play multiple
roles physiological well cellular immune responses. however, the
molecular nature hemocytes blood feeding insects, especially mosquitoes
which transmit several deadly diseases malaria, dengue etc. still
limited. therefore, know basic molecular composition naïve mosquito
hemocyte encoded proteins, sequenced rna-seq library analyzed total of
13,105,858 illumina sequencing reads mosquito anopheles stephensi, an
urban malarial vector india. denovo assembly approach yielded buildup of
3025 contigs, molecular functional annotation. total 1829 contigs
(48%) could mapped mosquito transcript database, remaining
1196 unmatched contigs, least 1108 contigs i.e. 40% total contigs, yielded 
a significant match available draft genome. immunodb analysis predicted 
total 88 putative hemocyte transcripts belonging 11 immune family proteins.
a comprehensive molecular analysis several unique transcripts including novel 
lrr, holotricin, obp, nifu, involved immunity, chemo sensing,
cell-cell communication, nitrogen fixation/metabolism etc. provides initial
evidence mosquito hemocytes carry unique ability meet manage cell
specific diverse functions mosquito blood. unexpected observation of
abundant transcripts encoding hypothetical proteins unknown functions
indicated much hemocyte biology remains understood.
