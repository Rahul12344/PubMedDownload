background: mannose binding lectin, plasma protein protects host virus,
bacteria, parasites. deficiency mbl levels associated with
susceptibility various infectious diseases including p. falciparum malaria.
common mbl polymorphisms promoter coding regions associated with
decrease plasma mbl levels production deformed mbl, respectively. the
present study, hypothesized mbl2 variants plasma mbl levels could 
associated different clinical phenotypes severe p. falciparum malaria.
methods: hospital based study conducted eastern odisha, india is
endemic p. falciparum malaria. common mbl-2 polymorphisms (codon 54, h-550l,
and y-221x) typed 336 cases severe malaria (sm) [94 cerebral malaria
(cm), 120 multi-organ dysfunction (mod), 122 non-cerebral severe malaria (ncsm)] 
and 131 un-complicated malaria patients (um). plasma mbl levels quantified
by elisa.
results: severe malaria patients displayed lower plasma levels mbl compared to
uncomplicated falciparum malaria. furthermore, categorization severe
malaria patients various subtypes, plasma mbl levels low mod
patients compared categories. higher frequency ab genotype allele
b observed mod compared um (ab genotype: p = 0.006; b allele: p =
0.008). addition, prevalence yx genotype mbl y-221x polymorphism was
also statistically frequent mod case um (p = 0.009).
conclusions: observations present study reveal mbl-2
polymorphisms (codon 54 y-221x) lower plasma mbl levels associated
with increased susceptibility multi organ dysfunctions p. falciparum
malaria.
