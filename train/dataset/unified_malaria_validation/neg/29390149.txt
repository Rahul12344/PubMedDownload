background: antenatal exposure parasites affect infants' subsequent
responses vaccination. present study investigated maternal prenatal
infections newborns' antiparasite cytokine profiles relate immunoglobulin 
g (igg) responses standard vaccination infancy.
methods: total 450 kenyan women tested parasitic infections 
pregnancy. newborns' responses plasmodium falciparum, schistosome, and
filaria antigens assessed cord blood lymphocytes. following standard
neonatal vaccination, infant cohort followed biannually age 30 months
for measurement circulating igg levels haemophilus influenzae b (hib),
diphtheria toxoid (dt), hepatitis b virus (hbv), tetanus toxoid.
results: trajectories postvaccination igg levels classified functional
principal component (pc) analysis assess child's response profile. two
main components, pc1, reflecting height response time, pc2,
reflecting crossover high low responses low high responses,
were identified. cord blood cytokine responses schistosome filarial
antigens showed significant association augmented antihelminth
interleukin 10 reduced antibody levels, particularly dt hbv, a
more rapid postvaccination decline circulating igg levels hib.
conclusion: antenatal sensitization schistosomiasis filariasis related 
production antiparasite interleukin 10 birth associated reduced
antivaccine igg levels infancy, possibly impaired protection.
