background: transfer rna (trna)-derived fragments (trfs) widely
identified nature, functioning diverse biological pathological
situations. yet, presence small rnas plasmodium spp. remains
unknown. systematic identification characterization trfs therefore
highly needed understand roles plasmodium parasites,
particularly virulent plasmodium falciparum parasite.
results: genome-wide small rnas sizes ranging 18-30 nucleotides p.
falciparum deep-sequenced via illumina hiseq 2000 technology. in-depth
analysis revealed presence vast number small rnas originating from
trna-coding genes, responsible 22.4% total reads second
predominant group. three p. falciparum-derived trf types (ptrfs) identified 
as 5'ptrfs, mid-ptrfs 3'ptrfs. majority (90%) ptrfs derived 
trnas coded eight amino acids: pro, phe, asn, gly, cys, gln, ala.
stem-loop reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed the
presence trfs blood stages p. falciparum. four new motifs an
enriched g/c feature determined cleavage sites might guide the
generation ptrfs.
conclusions: knowledge, first report genome-wide
investigation ptrfs plasmodium species. identification ptrfs
reveals complex small rna system manipulated malaria parasite, might
promote research function trfs pathogenesis plasmodium
infections.
