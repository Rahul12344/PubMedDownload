the mass migration occurred 2009-2013 insurgency in
northeastern nigeria could increased malaria incidence plasmodium
falciparum genetic diversity north central nigeria. determine p. falciparum
sequence diversity region, screened 282 samples collected regional 
clinics 2015-2018 plasmodium spp. and, positive samples,
determined p. falciparum infection complexity allele diversity using pcr. 
34 p. falciparum-positive samples, 39 msp1, 31 msp2, 13 glurp alleles were
detected, 88% infections polyclonal. identified trimorphic and
dimorphic allele combinations high percentage samples, indicative a
high infection complexity study population. high genetic diversity a
catalyst evolution drug-resistant alleles. improved measures (e.g.,
better drug quality, diagnostics) needed control p. falciparum
transmission reduce potential emergence drug resistance in
nigeria.
