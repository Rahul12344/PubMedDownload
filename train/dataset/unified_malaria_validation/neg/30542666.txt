background: malaria parasite species differ greatly harm to
humans. p. falciparum kills hundreds thousands per year, p. vivax kills 
much less often p. malariae relatively benign. strains rodent
malaria parasite plasmodium chabaudi show phenotypic variation virulence
during infections laboratory mice. make excellent species study 
genes may responsible trait. understanding mechanisms
which underlie differences virulence learn parasites adapt their
hosts might prevent disease. methods: present complete
reference genome sequence virulent p. chabaudi strain, pccb, and
perform detailed comparison genome less virulent pcas strain.
results: found greatest variation subtelomeric regions, in
particular amongst sequences pir gene family, been
associated virulence establishment chronic infection. despite
substantial variation sequence level, repertoire genes has
been largely maintained, highlighting requirement functional conservation
as well diversification host-parasite interactions. however, subset of
pir genes, previously associated increased virulence, highly
expressed pccb, suggesting role gene family virulence
differences strains. found core genes involved red blood cell 
invasion positive selection virulent strain has
a greater preference reticulocytes, elsewhere associated 
increased virulence. conclusions: results provide basis a
mechanistic understanding phenotypic differences plasmodium
chabaudi strains, might ultimately translated better
understanding malaria parasites affecting humans.
