gene drives enormous potential control insect populations of
medical agricultural relevance. preferentially biasing own
inheritance, gene drives rapidly introduce genetic traits even these
confer negative fitness effect population. recently developed
gene drives based crispr nuclease constructs designed disrupt key 
genes essential female fertility malaria mosquito. construct
copies associated genetic disruption one homologous
chromosome another gamete formation, process called homing that
ensures majority offspring inherit drive. drives the
potential cause long-lasting, sustainable population suppression, though 
are also expected impose large selection pressure resistance the
mosquito. one population suppression gene drives showed rapid invasion
of caged population 4 generations, establishing proof principle for
this technology. order assess potential emergence resistance
to gene drive population allowed run 25 generations 
monitored frequency gene drive time. following initial
increase gene drive observed gradual decrease frequency that
was accompanied spread small, nuclease-induced mutations target 
gene resistant cleavage restore functionality. such
mutations showed rates increase consistent positive selection face
of gene drive. findings represent first documented example of
selection resistance synthetic gene drive lead important design
recommendations considerations order mitigate resistance future 
gene drive applications.
