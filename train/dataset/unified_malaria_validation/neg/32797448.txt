over past years only, next-generation sequencing technologies became
accessible many applications rapidly derived, development of
rna-seq, technique uses deep sequencing profile whole transcriptomes.
rna-seq power discover new transcripts splicing variants, single
nucleotide variations, fusion genes, mrna levels-based expression profiles.
preparing rna-seq libraries delicate usually obligates buying
expensive kits require large amounts stating materials. method
presented flexible cost-effective. using method, prepared
high-quality strand-specific rna-seq libraries rna extracted human 
malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum. libraries compatible with
illuminaÂ®'s sequencers genome analyzer hi-seq. method however be
easily adapted platforms.
