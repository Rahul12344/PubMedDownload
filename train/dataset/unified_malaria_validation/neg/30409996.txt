the life cycle malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum tightly
regulated, oscillating stages intense proliferation quiescence.
cyclic 48-hour asexual replication plasmodium markedly different cell 
division higher eukaryotes, mechanistically poorly understood. here, we
report tight synchronisation malaria parasites early phases 
cell cycle exposure dl-α-difluoromethylornithine (dfmo), results in
the depletion polyamines. induces inescapable cell cycle arrest g1 
(~15 hours post-invasion) blocking g1/s transition. cell cycle-arrested
parasites enter quiescent g0-like state but, upon addition exogenous
polyamines, re-initiate cell cycle. ability halt malaria parasites 
at specific point cell cycle, subsequently trigger re-entry
into cell cycle, provides valuable framework investigate cell cycle
regulation parasites. subsequently used gene expression analyses to
show re-entry cell cycle involves expression ca2+-sensitive
(cdpk4 pk2) mitotic kinases (nima ark2), deregulation the
pre-replicative complex associated expression pk2. changes gene
expression could driven transcription factors myb1 two apiap2
family members. new approach parasite synchronisation therefore expands
our currently limited toolkit investigate cell cycle regulation malaria
parasites.
