anopheles mosquitoes transmit plasmodium parasites mammals, including the
species cause malaria humans. malaria pathology caused rapid
multiplication parasites asexual intraerythrocytic cycles. sexual stage
parasites also produced intraerythrocytic cycle ingested
by mosquito, initiating gametogenesis subsequent sporogonic stage
development. here, present plasmodium protein, termed microgamete surface
protein (migs), important role male gametocyte osmiophilic body
(mob) formation microgamete function. migs expressed exclusively male
gametocytes microgametes, migs localises mob microgamete 
surface. targeted gene disruption migs rodent malaria parasite plasmodium
yoelii 17xnl generated knockout parasites (δpymigs) proliferate normally 
erythrocytes form male female gametocytes. number mob male
gametocyte cytoplasm markedly reduced exflagellation microgametes
is impaired δpymigs. addition, anti-pymigs antibody severely blocked the
parasite development anopheles stephensi mosquito. migs might thus a
potential novel transmission-blocking vaccine target candidate.
