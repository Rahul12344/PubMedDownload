rna interference (rnai), naturally occurring phenomenon eukaryotic
organisms, extremely valuable tool utilized laboratory
for functional genomic studies. ability knockdown individual genes
selectively via reverse genetic technique allowed many researchers to
rapidly uncover biological roles numerous genes within many organisms, 
evaluation loss-of-function phenotypes. major human malaria vector
anopheles gambiae, predominant method used reduce function targeted
genes involves injection double-stranded (dsrna) hemocoel the
adult mosquito. method successful, gene knockdown adults
excludes functional assessment genes expressed potentially
play roles pre-adult stages, well genes expressed in
limited numbers cells adult mosquitoes. describe method the
injection serine protease inhibitor 2 (srpn2) dsrna early pupal
stage validate srpn2 protein knockdown observing decreased target protein 
levels formation melanotic pseudo-tumors srpn2 knockdown adult
mosquitoes. evident phenotype described previously adult stage 
knockdown srpn2 function, recapitulated adult phenotype by
srpn2 knockdown initiated pupal development. used conjunction with
a dye-labeled dsrna solution, technique enables easy visualization simple
light microscopy injection quality distribution dsrna hemocoel.
