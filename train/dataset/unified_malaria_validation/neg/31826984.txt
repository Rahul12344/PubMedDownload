flaviviruses dengue, yellow fever, zika, west nile, japanese
encephalitis virus present substantial global health burdens. new vaccines are
being sought address safety manufacturing issues associated current
live attenuated vaccines. here, describe new insect-specific flavivirus,
binjari virus, found remarkably tolerant exchange its
structural protein genes (prme) aforementioned pathogenic
vertebrate-infecting flaviviruses (vifs). chimeric binj/vif-prme viruses remained
replication defective vertebrate cells replicated high efficiency 
mosquito cells. cryo-electron microscopy monoclonal antibody binding studies 
illustrated chimeric binj/vif-prme virus particles structurally and
immunologically similar parental vifs. pilot manufacturing c6/36
cells suggests high yields reached 109.5 cell culture
infectious dose/ml ≈7 mg/liter. binj/vif-prme viruses showed utility in
diagnostic (microsphere immunoassays elisas using panels human equine 
sera) vaccine applications (illustrating protection zika virus
challenge murine ifnar-/- mouse models). binj/vif-prme viruses thus represent 
a versatile, noninfectious (for vertebrate cells), high-yield technology for
generating chimeric flavivirus particles low biocontainment requirements.
