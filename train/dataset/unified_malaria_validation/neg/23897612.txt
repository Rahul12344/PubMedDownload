following anopheles mosquito-mediated introduction human host, plasmodium 
parasites infect hepatocytes undergo intensive replication. accumulating
evidence indicates cd8(+) cells induced immunization attenuated
plasmodium sporozoites confer sterile immunity liver stage of
infection; however, mechanisms underlying protection clearly
understood. address this, generated recombinant plasmodium berghei anka
expressing fusion protein ovalbumin epitope green fluorescent protein
in cytoplasm parasite. shown ovalbumin epitope is
presented infected liver cells manner dependent transporter
associated antigen processing becomes target specific cd8(+) t
cells cell receptor transgenic mouse line ot-i, leading protection 
at liver stage plasmodium infection. visualized interaction between
ot-i cells infected hepatocytes intravital imaging using two-photon
microscopy. ot-i cells formed clusters around infected hepatocytes, leading to
the elimination intrahepatic parasites subsequent formation large
clusters ot-i cells liver. gamma interferon expressed cd8(+) cells
was dispensable protective response. additionally, found that
polyclonal ovalbumin-specific memory cd8(+) cells induced de novo
immunization able confer sterile protection, although threshold
frequency protection relatively high. studies revealed novel
mechanism specific cd8(+) cell-mediated protective immunity demonstrated
that proteins expressed cytoplasm plasmodium parasites become
targets specific cd8(+) cells liver-stage infection.
