although extensively studied prokaryotes, prevalence significance of
dna n(6)-methyladenine (6ma m(6)da) eukaryotes underappreciated
until recent studies, demonstrated 6ma regulates gene expression 
as potential heritable mark. interrogate 6ma sites single-base
resolution, report da-6ma-seq (dpni-assisted n(6)-methyladenine sequencing),
an approach uses dpni cleave methylated adenine sites duplex dna. we
find dpni cuts sequence motifs besides canonical gatc restriction 
sites, thereby expanding utility method. da-6ma-seq achieves higher
sensitivity nanograms input dna lower sequencing depth than
conventional approaches. study 6ma base resolution chlamydomonas
genome apply new method two eukaryotic organisms, plasmodium and
penicillium. combined conventional approaches, method shows that
most 6ma sites fully methylated strands dna various sequence
contexts.
