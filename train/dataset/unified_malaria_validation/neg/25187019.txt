background: mutations pfdhfr pfdhps genes shown associate
with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) resistance plasmodium falciparum
parasites. however, pfdhfr, pfdhps genotypes correlations sp treatment
outcome indonesia yet well analysed.
methods: obtaining informed consent, 61 uncomplicated falciparum malaria
patients recruited banjar district, south kalimantan province, indonesia,
from october 2009 august 2010. treated single oral dose sp
and effects clinical parasitological status followed day 28
after treatment. occasionally, thick smear blood film microscopy
observation blood spot filter paper pfdhfr pfdhps genotype
analysis collected.
results: pfdhfr pfdhps genotypes 24 p. falciparum-infected patients
consisting adequate clinical parasitological response (acpr) (n = 6; 25.0%)
and early treatment failure (etf) (n = 10; 41.7%) late parasitological failure
(lpf) (n = 8; 33.3%) obtained sequencing. two novel mutations pfdhps
gene, k540t i588f, determined ten five isolates, respectively.
these mutations present pfdhfr/pfdhps combined haplotypes of
anrni/sgtga (n = 6), anrnl/sgtga (n = 4), anrni/sgeaa(588f) (n = 5),
(mutation codons bold typed); haplotypes mostly belonging to
parasitological failure (etf lpf). parasites acquiring five mutations in
pfdhfr/pfdhps haplotypes four mutations additional i588f respond
adequately sp treatment.
conclusion: many plasmodium falciparum infected patients banjar district,
south kalimantan, indonesia respond adequately sp treatment 
low ineffectiveness sp area associated two novel mutations of
pfdhps, k540t i588f.
