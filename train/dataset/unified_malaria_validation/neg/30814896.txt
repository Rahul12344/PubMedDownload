the species artemisia, one largest genera family asteraceae, are
frequently utilized treatment diseases malaria, hepatitis,
cancer, inflammation, infections fungi, bacteria, viruses.
karyological studies performed 18 artemisia khorassanica populations:
eleven diploid (2n = 18) seven tetraploid (2n = 36). mean
chromosome lengths 3.61 3.84 Âµm diploids tetraploids,
respectively. two chromosome types ("m", "sm") formed karyotype formulas "18m"
for diploids "36m" "34m + 2sm" tetraploids. mean 2c dna contents 
were 5.91 11.53 pg diploids tetraploids, respectively. the
transcription levels key genes involved artemisinin production were
compared diploid (b, d, h) tetraploid (o, p, r) a. khorassanica relative
to a. annua standard species. artemisinin content detected diploid
and tetraploid a. khorassanica populations. significant diefrences were
detected diploids tetraploids terms dxr , hmgr, fds, ads
gene expression. implies genomic amplification likely
occurs amount repetitive dna unique sequences. dbr2 gene
was expressed diploid a. khorassanica low amount silenced 
autotetraploid a. khorassanica.
