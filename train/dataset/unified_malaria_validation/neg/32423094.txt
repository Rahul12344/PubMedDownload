in december 2019, novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) new
coronavirus (sars-cov-2) recognized city wuhan, china. rapidly, 
became epidemic china spread throughout world reaching
pandemic proportions. high mortality rates characterize sars-cov-2 disease
(covid-19), mainly affects elderly, causing unrestrained
cytokines-storm subsequent pulmonary shutdown, also suspected micro
thromboembolism events. present time, specific dedicated
treatments, approved vaccines, available, though promising data come
from use anti-inflammatory, anti-malaria, anti-coagulant drugs. in
addition, seems males susceptible sars-cov-2 females,
with males 65% likely die infection females. data 
world health organization (who) chinese scientists show cases
about 1.7% women contract virus die compared 2.8% men,
and data hong kong hospitals state 32% male 15% female
covid-19 patients required intensive care died. hand, the
long-term fallout coronavirus may worse women men due to
social psychosocial reasons. regardless sex- gender-biased data
obtained gathered sometimes controversial scientific
journals, central points considered. firstly, sars-cov-2 a
strong interaction human ace2 receptor, plays essential role in
cell entry together transmembrane serine protease 2 (tmprss2); is
interesting note ace2 gene lays x-chromosome, thus allowing
females potentially heterozygous differently assorted compared men
who definitely hemizygous. secondly, higher ace2 expression rate in
females, though controversial, might ascribe worst prognosis, in
contrast worldwide epidemiological data. finally, several genes involved 
inflammation located x-chromosome, also contains high number 
immune-related genes responsible innate adaptive immune responses to
infection. genes, ras-pathway, might directly indirectly
impact ace1/ace2 balance influencing main actors (e.g., abo locus, 
sry, sox3, adam17). unexpectedly, higher levels ace2 ace1/ace2
rebalancing might improve outcome covid-19 sexes reducing
inflammation, thrombosis, death. moreover, x-heterozygous females might also 
activate mosaic advantage show pronounced sex-related differences
resulting sex dimorphism, favoring counteracting the
progression sars-cov-2 infection.
