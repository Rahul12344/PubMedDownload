background: drug resistance major problem control plasmodium falciparum
infection endemic countries. last decade, african countries have
changed first-line treatment artemisinin-based combinations therapy (act);
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) recommended intermittent preventive
therapy (ipt). molecular markers related p falciparum resistance analysed
for period transition sp act, isolates imported africa.
methods: first group samples taken period june 2002 and
june 2006 (n = 113); second group period november 2008 and
august 2010 (n = 46). several alleles analysed nested pcr-rflp: 51, 59,
108, 164, pfdhfr gene; 436, 437, 540, 581, pfdhps gene; 86, 1246,
in pfmdr1 gene 76, pfcrt gene. prevalence alleles the
groups compared chi-squared fisher's exact tests.
results: pfdhfr n51i, c59r s108n 90% two groups; 
samples i164. pfdhps, 437 g 581 g, increased 80% and
10.9% (p = 0.024), respectively second group. 540 g decreases (24% 
16.%) 436a disappears end follow-up (p = 0.004) the
second group. 76i-pfcrt stayed 95% two groups. prevalence of
86y-pfmdr1 decreased eight years.
conclusions: pharmacological pressure affects resistance strains prevalence. 
as sp, disappearance 436a decrease 540 g suggest these
mutations fixed. hand, studies carried act
introduction show selection strains carrying snps n86y, d1246y
in pfmdr1. work, prevalence pfmdr1- d1246y increasing, perhaps 
as result selective pressure act. continued surveillance essential 
monitor effectiveness treatments.
