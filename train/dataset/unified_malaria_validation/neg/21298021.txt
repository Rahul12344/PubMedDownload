the clonally variant plasmodium falciparum pfemp1 adhesin virulence factor
and prime target humoral immunity. encoded repertoire of
functionally differentiated var genes, display architectural diversity 
allelic polymorphism. serological relationship key understanding 
evolutionary constraints gene family rational vaccine design. here,
we investigated palo alto/varo it4/r29 3d7/pf13_003 parasites lines. 
varo r29 form rosettes uninfected erythrocytes, phenotype associated
with severe malaria. express allelic cys2/group nts-dbl1α(1) pfemp1
domain implicated rosetting, whose 3d7 ortholog encoded pf13_0003. using
these three recombinant nts-dbl1α(1) domains, elicited antibodies mice that
were used develop monovariant cultures panning selection. 3d7/pf13_0003
parasites formed rosettes, revealing correlation sequence identity 
virulence phenotype. antibodies cross-reacted allelic domains in
elisa minimally cys4/group b/c pfl1955w nts-dbl1α. contrast,
they variant-specific surface seroreactivity monovariant-infected 
red cells facs analysis rosette-disruption assays. thus, elisa
can differentiate serogroups, surface reactivity assays define more
restrictive serotypes. irrespective cumulated exposure infection,
antibodies acquired humans living malaria-endemic area also displayed a
variant-specific surface reactivity. although seroprevalence exceeded 90% for
each rosetting line, kinetics acquisition surface-reactive antibodies
differed younger age groups. data indicate humans acquire an
antibody repertoire non-overlapping serotypes within serogroup, consistent
with antibody-driven diversification pressure population level. in
addition, data provide important information vaccine design, as
production vaccine targeting rosetting pfemp1 adhesins require
engineering induce variant-transcending responses combining multiple
serotypes elicit broad spectrum immunity.
