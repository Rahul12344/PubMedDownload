the growing use protozoan parasites expressing fluorescent reporter genes,
together advances microscopy, enabling visualisation their
behaviour functions within host earliest stages of
infection previously unparalleled spatiotemporal resolution. these
developments begun provide novel insights, informing our
understanding host immune responses may initiated, cells are
involved types response elicited. review of
these recent observations highlight importance cellular communication
between site infection draining lymph node (dln) establishing
infection immunity. also highlight number remaining challenges and
unknowns arise inability follow fate map journey a
single cell spatially separated tissue sites. response these
challenges, review recently described experimental strategy extends the
spatial temporal limits previous imaging approaches, significantly
allowing longitudinal analysis cellular migration skin and
draining lymph nodes vivo, without requirement invasive surgery.
