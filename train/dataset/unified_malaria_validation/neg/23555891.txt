introduction: plasmepsin v (pm-v) functionally conserved orthologues across 
the plasmodium genus who's binding antigenic processing pexel motifs
for export 200-300 essential proteins important virulence and
viability causative plasmodium species. study undertaken to
determine p. vivax plasmepsin v ind (pvpm-v-ind) pexel motif export pathway for
pathogenicity-related proteins/antigens export thereby altering plasmodium
exportome erythrocytic stages.
method: identify characterize plasmodium vivax plasmepsin-v-ind (mutant)
gene cloning, sequence analysis, silico bioinformatic protocols and
structural modeling predictions based docking studies binding capacity with
pexel motifs processing terms binding accessibility export proteins.
results: cloning sequence analysis genetic diversity demonstrates
pvpm-v-ind (mutant) gene highly conserved among isolates different
geographical regions india. imperfect duplicate insertion types mutations
(svse 246-249 aa slse 266-269 aa) identified among indian 
isolates comparison p.vivax sal-1 (pvpm-v-sal 1) isolate. silico
bioinformatics interaction studies pexel peptide active enzyme reveal that
pvpm-v-ind (mutant) active endoplasmic reticulum lumen membrane
embedding essential activation plasmepsin v. structural modeling
predictions based docking studies pexel motif show significant variation 
in substrate protein binding imperfect mutations data mined pexel
sequences. predicted variation docking score interacting amino
acids pvpm-v-ind (mutant) proteins pexel lopinavir suggests a
modulation activity pvpm-v terms binding accessibility at
these sites.
conclusion/significance: functional modeled validation pvpm-v-ind (mutant)
imperfect duplicate insertions data mined pexel sequences leading altered
binding substrate accessibility enzyme makes plausible target 
investigate export mechanisms silico virtual screening novel
pharmacophore designing.
