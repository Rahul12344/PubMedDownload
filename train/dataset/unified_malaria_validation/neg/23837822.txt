background: clear coordinated reciprocal actions kinases
and phosphatases fundamental regulation development growth of
the malaria parasite. protein phosphatase type 1 key enzyme playing diverse 
and essential roles cell survival. dephosphorylation activity/specificity 
is governed interaction catalytic subunit (pp1c) regulatory
proteins. among these, inhibitor-2 (i2) one evolutionarily ancient
pp1 regulators. vivo studies various organisms revealed defect in
chromosome segregation cell cycle progression function i2 is
blocked.
results: report, present evidence plasmodium falciparum, the
causative agent deadly form malaria, expresses structural
homolog mammalian i2, named pfi2. biochemical, vitro vivo studies
revealed pfi2 binds pp1 inhibits activity. showed that
the motifs 12ktisw16 102hyne105 critical pfi2 inhibitory activity.
functional studies using xenopus oocyte model revealed pfi2 able to
overcome g2/m cell cycle checkpoint inducing germinal vesicle breakdown.
genetic manipulations p. falciparum suggest essential role pfi2 no
viable mutants disrupted pfi2 gene detectable. additionally, peptides
derived pfi2 competing rvxf binding sites pp1 exhibit
anti-plasmodial activity blood stage parasites vitro.
conclusions: taken together, data suggest pfi2 protein could play 
role regulation p. falciparum cell cycle pfpp1
phosphatase regulatory activity. structure-activity studies regulator led
to identification peptides anti-plasmodial activity blood
stage parasites vitro suggesting pp1c-regulator interactions could a
novel means control malaria.
