objective: explore effect immunogenicity immunizing protection of
gama gene dna vaccine, related merozoite, ookinete sporozoite 
invasion.
methods: gene fragments obtained using pcr technique eukaryotic
expression vector (containing immunostimulatory sequence) built. balb/c mice 
were divided pbs control group, empty vector control group study group
and immunized week 0, 3 6 respectively. blood collected 2 weeks
after immunization serum separated detect igg, igg1 igg2a
levels. spleen mice obtained preparation splenic mononuclear cell
and cytokine il-4 ifn-γ levels detected. indirect immunofluorescence
and western blot employed verify specificity antiserum. sporozoite
and merozoite invasion used respectively detect immune protective
effect 2 weeks third immunization. ookinete conversion rate in vitro
and oocyst numbers mosquito stomach observed evaluate the
transmission-blocking levels.
results: gama dna vaccine group: antiserum could combined recombinant 
protein specifically green fluorescence signals merozoite, ookinete and
sporozoite observable, specific fragments fluorescence signals
were observable empty vector group. compared control group, specific 
igg dna vaccine immunity group significantly increased (p < 0.01), igg1
and igg2a increased (p < 0.01). il-4, ifn-γ content study group
significantly increased, compared control group (p < 0.01). gama dna vaccine
immunity could obviously block erythrocyte-stage infection (caused by
sporozoite invasion); compared control group, liver worm load slightly
reduced (p < 0.05), antiserum ookinete numbers (cultured in vitro) no
significant difference oocyst numbers mosquito stomach dna vaccine
group.
conclusions: gama good antigenicity, could stimulate body to
produce specific immune responses; dna vaccine immunity could play a
good protective effect, effect limited slight
reduction liver worm load, obvious erythrocyte-stage protective
effect transmission-blocking effect. therefore, trying immunization
strategies research value gama (as multi-stage antigen
vaccine multi-stage combined vaccine components life-cycle of
plasmodium) necessary.
