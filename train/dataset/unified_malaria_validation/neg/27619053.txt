many plasmodium falciparum proteins share homology with, generally
longer respective orthologs. this, extent, attributed
to insertions. here, studied p. falciparum rna hypermethylase,
trimethylguanosine synthase (pftgs1) harbors 76 amino acid insertion in
its methyltransferase domain. bioinformatics analysis revealed this
insertion present tgs1 orthologs plasmodium species well.
interestingly, classical nuclear localization signal (nls) predicted the
insertions primate parasite tgs1 proteins. check whether predicted
nls functional, developed vivo heterologous system using s.
cerevisiae. predicted nls fused dimeric gfp able localize the
fusion protein nucleus yeast indicating indeed recognized by
the yeast nuclear import machinery. showed pftgs1 nls binds
to p. falciparum importin-α vitro, confirming nls also recognized 
by p. falciparum classical nuclear import machinery. thus, study we
report novel function insertion pftgs1.
