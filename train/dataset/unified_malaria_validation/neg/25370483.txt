the available tools conditional gene expression plasmodium falciparum 
limited. here, enable reliable control target gene expression, build a
system efficiently modulate translation. overcame several problems
associated approaches regulating gene expression p. falciparum.
specifically, system functions predictably across several native and
engineered promoter contexts, affords control reporter native
parasite proteins irrespective subcellular compartmentalization.
induction repression gene expression rapid, homogeneous stable
over prolonged periods. demonstrate practical application system, we
used reveal direct links antimalarial drugs native
parasite molecular target. important outcome given rapid spread of
resistance, intensified efforts efficiently discover optimize new
antimalarial drugs. overall, studies presented highlight utility our
system broadly controlling gene expression performing functional genetics
in p. falciparum.
