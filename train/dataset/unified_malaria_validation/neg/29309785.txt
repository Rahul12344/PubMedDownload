understanding pathophysiology associated host parasite interactions of
the malaria infection prerequisite developing effective prevention and
treatment strategies. exact mechanism underlying malaria associated
ineffective dyserythropoiesis yet fully understood. important
protein, haemoglobin serves main amino acid reservoir available the
intra-erythrocytic plasmodium. important check expression profiling 
of globin genes may help us understand host parasite interactions and
its potential contribution infection disease. here, in-vitro
culture system used study effect different doses plasmodium
falciparum haematopoietic stem cell expansion, differentiation expression 
of globin genes. upon exposure different doses p. falciparum parasites 
of strains 3d7, dd2 rkl9 (intact lysed form) different stages of
erythroid development, cells demonstrated suppression growth and
differentiation. almost stages erythroid development upon parasite
exposure, γ globin gene found downregulated α/β well 
α/non- α globin mrna ratios late stage erythroid cells found be
reduced (p < .01) compared untreated controls. imbalance globin
chain expression might considered one factors involved malaria
associated inappropriate erythropoietic responses.
