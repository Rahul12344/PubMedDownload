the recent reports resistance plasmodium falciparum artemisinin
derivatives partner drugs demand intensive studies toward understanding
the molecular mechanisms resistance. study, examined vitro
susceptibility 63 p. falciparum field isolates collected the
china-myanmar border area chloroquine (cq) piperaquine (ppq). parasite
isolates remained highly resistant cq, geometric mean 50% inhibitory 
concentration (ic50) 252.7 nm range 51.9 1,052.0 nm. in
comparison, parasites geometric mean ic50 28.4 nm ppq, 
fairly wide range 5.3 132.0 nm, suggesting certain parasite isolates
displayed relatively high levels resistance ppq. interestingly, within 
4 years study, parasites exhibited continuous decline in
susceptibilities cq ppq, significant correlation
between responses cq ppq (pearson correlation coefficient = 0.79, p <
0.0001). consistent cq-resistant phenotype, parasites carried the
pfcrt k76t mutation, parasites cviet type prevalent in
southeast asia. contrast, pfmdr1 mutations relatively rare, gene
amplification detected. pfmdr1 n1042d mutation associated with
resistance cq. pfmrp1 gene, four substitutions reached relatively high
prevalence >22%, i876v mutation associated reduced
sensitivity cq. however, could establish link ppq responses
and polymorphisms three genes associated quinoline drug
resistance.
