in sexually reproducing organisms, meiosis essential step responsible for
generation haploid gametes diploid somatic cells. quest for
understanding regulatory mechanisms meiotic recombination plasmodium led to
identification gene encoding protein contains 11 copies c2h2 zinc 
fingers (znf). reverse genetic approaches used create plasmodium berghei 
parasites either lacking expression full-length plasmodium berghei zinc finger
protein (pbzfp) (knockout [ko]) expressing pbzfp lacking c-terminal zinc
finger region (truncated [trunc]). mice infected ko parasites survived two
times longer (p < 0.0001) mice infected wild-type (wt) parasites. in
mosquito transmission experiments, infectivity ko trunc parasites 
severely compromised (>95% oocyst reduction). ko parasites revealed total lack 
of trimethylation histone 3 several lysine residues (k4, k27, k36)
without effect acetylation patterns (h3k9, h3k14, h4k16). reduced dna 
damage reduced expression topoisomerase-like spo11 ko parasites
with normal rad51 expression suggest functional role pbzfp during
genetic recombination involves dna double-strand break (dsb) formation
followed dna repair. finding raise possibility convergent

protein histone 3 lysine 4 (h3k4) methyltransferase activity. these
functions include major role played latter binding recombination
