resistance antimalarials targeting folate pathway widespread.
gtp-cyclohydrolase (gch1), first enzyme pathway, exhibits extensive
copy number variation (cn) parasite isolates areas history of
longstanding antifolate use. increased cn gch1 associated greater
number point mutations enzymes targeted antifolates, pyrimethamine
and sulphadoxine. observations suggest increases gch1 cn 
an adaptation drug pressure, changes cn experimentally
demonstrated directly alter drug susceptibility. determine changes in
gch1 expression alone modify pyrimethamine sensitivity, manipulated gch1 cn in
several parasite lines test effect drug sensitivity. report that
increases gch1 cn alter pyrimethamine resistance parasites lines.
however find evidence detrimental effect high levels gch1
overexpression parasite lines high endogenous levels gch1 expression, 
revealing importance maintaining balance folate pathway and
implicating changes gch1 expression preserving proper metabolic flux. 
work expands understanding parasite adaptation drug pressure and
provides possible mechanism specific mutations become fixed within
parasite populations.
