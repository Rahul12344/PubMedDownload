background: anti-malarial resistance is, continues significant
challenge fight malaria threat achieving malaria
elimination. zambia, chloroquine (cq), safe, affordable well-tolerated
drug, removed use 2003 due high levels resistance evidenced
with treatment failure. study sought investigate prevalence of
chloroquine resistance markers southern western provinces zambia
14 years withdrawal cq.
methods: data cross-sectional, all-age household survey, conducted 
the peak malaria transmission season (april-may 2017) analysed. the
all-age survey, socio-demographic information coverage malaria
interventions collected. consenting individuals tested malaria with
a rapid diagnostic test spot blood collected filter paper create a
dried blood spot (dbs). photo-induced electronic transfer-polymerase chain
reaction (pet-pcr) used analyse dbs presence four
malaria species. plasmodium falciparum positive samples analysed high
resolution melt (hrm) pcr detect presence genotypic markers drug
resistance p. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) p.
falciparum multi-drug resistance (pfmdr) genes.
results: total 181 p. falciparum positive samples examined pfcrt
k76t mdr n86. 181 samples 155 successfully amplified pfcrt 145
for pfmdr n86. overall prevalence cq drug-resistant parasites 1.9%
(3/155), significant difference two provinces. n86y/f
mutations pfmdr gene observed sample.
conclusion: study reveals return cq sensitive parasites southern
and western provinces zambia 14 years withdrawal. surveillance of
molecular resistant markers anti-malarials included malaria 
elimination programme resistance monitored country wide.
