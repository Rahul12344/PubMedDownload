background: plasmodium falciparum, deadliest malaria-causing parasite, an
extremely at-rich (80.7 %) genome. high at-content, sequence-based
annotation genes functional elements remains challenging. order to
better understand regulatory network controlling gene expression the
parasite, complete genome annotation well analysis tools adapted for
at-rich genomes needed. recent studies genome-wide nucleosome positioning 
in eukaryotes shown nucleosome landscapes exhibit regular
characteristic patterns 5'- 3'-end protein non-protein coding
genes. addition, nucleosome depleted regions found near transcription
start sites. unique nucleosome landscape patterns may exploited 
identification novel genes. paper, propose computational approach
to discover novel putative genes based exclusively nucleosome positioning data
in at-rich genome p. falciparum.
results: using binary classifiers trained nucleosome landscapes gene
boundaries two independent nucleosome positioning data sets, able to
detect total 231 regions containing putative genes genome of
plasmodium falciparum, 67 highly confident genes found data
sets. eighty-eight 231 newly predicted genes exhibited transcription
signal rna-seq data, indicative active transcription. addition, 20 out
of 21 selected gene candidates validated rt-pcr, 28 of
the 231 genes showed significant matches using blastn expressed
sequence tag (est) database. furthermore, 108 (47%) 231 putative novel
genes overlapped previously identified unannotated long non-coding rnas.
collectively, results provide experimental validation 163 predicted
genes (70.6%). finally, 73 231 genes found potentially
translated based signal polysome-associated rna-seq representing
transcripts actively translated.
conclusion: results clearly indicate nucleosome positioning data
contains sufficient information novel gene discovery. distinct nucleosome 
landscapes around genes found many eukaryotic organisms, this
methodology could used characterize transcriptome organism,
especially coupled dna-based gene finding experimental
methods (e.g., rna-seq).
