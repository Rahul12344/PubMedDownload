background: sickle haemoglobin (hbs) haemoglobin c (hbc) caused by
point mutations beta globin gene, offer substantial malaria
protection. despite fact blood disorder caused homozygosity for
hbc much less severe caused homozygosity hbs (sickle cell
anaemia), sickle mutation come dominate many old-world
malarious regions, whilst hbc highly restricted geographical
distribution. suggested discrepancy may due sickle
cell heterozygotes enjoying higher level malaria protection than
heterozygotes hbc. higher fitness sickle cell heterozygotes relative 
hbc heterozygotes could certainly allowed sickle cell allele spread
more rapidly. however, observations carrying either hbc hbs enhances an
individual's capacity transmit malaria parasites mosquitoes could also shed
light conundrum.
methods: population genetic model used investigate evolutionary
consequences strength malaria selection correlated either
hbs frequency hbc frequency.
results: selection pressure malaria positively correlated the
frequency either hbs hbc, easier hbs succeed the
competitive interaction two alleles.
conclusions: feedback process whereby presence variant haemoglobins
increases level malaria selection population could contributed
to global success hbs relative hbc, despite former's higher blood
disorder cost.
