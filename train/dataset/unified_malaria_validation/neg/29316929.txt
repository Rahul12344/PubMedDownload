background: point mutations plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase
(pfdhfr) dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps) genes confer resistance to
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) occur increasing rates. present study aimed
to identify pfdhfr pfdhps mutations p. falciparum isolates recovered 
women received two doses sp pregnancy bandundu, democratic
republic congo (drc).
methods: total 48 women confirmed p. falciparum infection enrolled
in study. finger-prick blood samples collected filter paper at
the time delivery used dna isolation. pfdhfr pfdhps genes were
amplified nested pcr protocol. dna sequencing performed strands,
and point mutations analysed.
results: 48 (100.0%) p. falciparum isolates carried least one
polymorphism genes. wild-type haplotypes pfdhfr (cncsi [c50, n51, 
c59, s108, i164]) pfdhps (sakaa [s436, a437, k540, a581, a613]) not
observed study. pfdhfr, n51i (85.4%), c59r (60.4%), s108n (100.0%) 
polymorphisms detected. triple mutation (cirni) (mutant amino acids are
underlined) prevalent (47.9%) pfdhfr haplotype. study, p.
falciparum isolates (100.0%) harboured a437g allele pfdhps gene. also,
k540e a581g polymorphisms observed one (2.1%) isolate. single mutant 
haplotype (sgkaa) detected 97.9% isolates. mutant pfdhfr pfdhps
allele combinations revealed quintuple (cicni-sgega; 2.1%), quadruple
(cirni-sgkaa; 47.9%), triple (cicni-sgkaa; 35.4%, cnrni-sgkaa; 12.5%), double
(cncni-sgkaa; 2.1%) haplotypes.
conclusions: study, rate sgega haplotype low (2.1%). although
k540e a581g alleles common eastern africa, distinct lineage 
sgega also present drc, located central africa. this
haplotype associated decreased efficacy sp pregnant women and
infants, therefore, carefully considered drc sp
resistance routinely monitored.
