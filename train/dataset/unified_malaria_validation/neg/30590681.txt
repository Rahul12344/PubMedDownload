background: gut microbiota recently shown impact malaria disease
progression outcome, prior studies shown plasmodium infections 
increase likelihood enteric bacteria causing systemic infections.
currently, known whether plasmodium infection impacts human gut
microbiota prelude bacteremia whether antimalarials affect gut
microbiota. goal determine degree plasmodium infections and
antimalarial treatment affect human gut microbiota.
methods: one hundred kenyan infants underwent active surveillance malaria
from birth 10 months age. malaria episode treated with
artemether-lumefantrine (al). treatments, including antibiotics, were
recorded. stool samples collected approximately biweekly basis. ten
children selected basis stool samples collected before
(n = 27) (n = 17) malaria episode without antibiotics 
administered collections. samples subjected 16s ribosomal
ribonucleic acid gene (v3-v4 region) sequencing.
results: bacterial community network analysis revealed obvious differences 
the malaria/al samples, consistent difference 
in alpha beta diversity taxonomic analysis family genus level 
with one exception. sequence variant (sv) level, akin bacterial
species, 1 top 100 svs significantly different. addition,
predicted metagenome analysis revealed significant difference metagenomic
capacity malaria/al samples. number malaria
episodes, 1 versus 2, explained significant variation gut microbiota
composition infants.
conclusions: in-depth bioinformatics analysis stool bacteria revealed 
the first time human malaria episode/al treatment minimal effects on
gut microbiota kenyan infants.
