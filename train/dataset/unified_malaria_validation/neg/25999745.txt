purpose: global spread bla ctx-m-i extended-spectrum beta-lactamase
(esbl)-producing salmonella spp. remains major threat treatment control.
evidence emergence spread marker lacking nigeria. this
study investigated bla ctx-m-i esbl production among salmonella isolates from
hospitalized patients.
methods: patients (158 total) made two groups evaluated. group was
composed 135 patients persistent pyrexia group b composed 23
gastroenteritis patients stool samples. samples cultured, and
isolates identified subjected antibiotic susceptibility testing 
by standard methods. isolates screened esbl production, bla
ctx-m-i genes transferability double disk synergy test, plasmid
extraction, polymerase chain reaction, conjugation experiment.
results: thirty-five (25.9%) salmonella isolates identified group a, of
which 74.3% s. typhi, 22.9% s. paratyphi two (5.7%) invasive
non-typhoidal s. enteritidis. nine plasmodium falciparum infections were
recorded, four identified co-infections typhoidal
salmonella. two (8.7%) s. enteritidis samples obtained group b
(p>0.05). total 24 isolates esbl-positive, eliciting resistance five
to seven antibiotics, multiple-drug resistant. esbl production due to
the bla ctx-m-i gene cluster detected eleven (45.8%) salmonella isolates. 
nine (81.8%) eleven bla ctx-m-i esbl producers s. typhi two
(18.2%) isolates s. enteritidis. four nine s. typhi bla ctx-m-i
esbl-producing strains harbored 23 kb self-transmissible plasmid was
co-transferred cefotaxime augmentin resistance escherichia coli j53-2
transconjugants.
conclusion: study revealed emergence bla ctx-m-i s. typhi agent
of persistent pyrexia potential spread enterobacteriaceae in
lagos, nigeria. cautionary prescription judicious use third-generation
cephalosporins, particularly cefotaxime, treatment typhoid fever and
routine screening p. falciparum co-infection esbl-producing salmonella
in laboratories diagnosis persistent pyrexia conditions patients
are recommended.
