the phylum apicomplexa includes large group early branching eukaryotes
having significant medical economical importance. molecular machinery
responsible protein trafficking poorly understood apicomplexans. 
one important proteins involved clathrin-mediated protein
trafficking epsin, contains enth domain, conserved domain crucial 
membrane bending leading vesicle formation. undertook homology searching
and phylogenetic analyses produce rigorously annotated set epsin homologs
retrieved diverse apicomplexan genomes. genomic phylogenetic comparisons
revealed apicomplexans contain unusual epsin homologs distinct from
those observed mammals yeast. although four epsin genes in
mammalian system five yeast genome, apicomplexan parasites consist
only single epsin gene. apicomplexan epsin contains conserved enth
domain consisting phosphoinositide (ptdins)-binding sites indicate about
their functional significance formation vesicles; however, absence 
of ubiquitin-interacting motif (uim) suggests possible different mechanism 
protein trafficking. existence dileucine motif plasmodium,
cryptosporidum parvum eimeria tenella epsins might solve functionality 
while lacking lot conserved motifs motif known interact with
different adaptor protein complexes (ap1, ap2 ap3). epsin homologs 
also shown different peptide motifs reported possible interaction
with α-ear appendage, γ-ear appendage eh domain present different
adaptors. bioinformatic phylogenetic analyses suggest apicomplexan
epsins unusual functionality mammalian epsins. this
detailed study may greatly facilitate future molecular cell biological
investigation role epsins parasites.
