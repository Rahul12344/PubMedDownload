the role intra-host genetic diversity dengue viral populations remains a
topic debate, particularly impact transmission changes this
diversity. several approaches taken increasing decreasing the
genetic diversity populations rna viruses drawn appear 
contradictory conclusions. 2-6 fold increase genetic diversity wild
type population dengue virus serotype 1(denv1) infectious clone
population derived wild type population, produced treatment with
nucleotide analogue 5 fluorouracil (5fu), drove populations extinction.
removal 5fu immediately prior extinction, resulted return to
pre-treatment levels fitness genetic diversity, albeit novel single
nucleotide polymorphisms. observations support concept denv
populations exist fitness peaks determined transmission requirements 
and either increase decrease genetic diversity may result loss of
fitness.
