background: human malaria susceptibility determined multiple genetic
factors. unclear, however, genetic variants remain important over
time.
methods: genetic associations 175 high-quality polymorphisms within several
malaria candidate genes examined sample 8096 individuals from
northeast tanzania using altitude, seroconversion rates, parasite rates as
proxies historical, recent, current malaria transmission intensity. a
principal component analysis used derive 2 alternative measures overall
malaria propensity location across different time scales.
results: common red blood cell polymorphisms (ie, hemoglobin s,
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, α-thalassemia) ones be
associated 3 measures transmission intensity first principal 
component. moderate associations found immune response genes
(ie, il3 il13) parasite rates, could reproduced using
the alternative measures malaria propensity.
conclusions: demonstrated potential using altitude and
seroconversion rate measures malaria transmission capturing medium- to
long-term time scales detect genetic associations likely persist
over time. measures also advantage minimizing deleterious
effects random factors affecting parasite rates respective association 
signals.
