trafficking rhoptry chimeric protein rhoph2-gfp, contains rhoph2
signal peptide plus downstream five amino acids, dissected treating
parasites brefeldin three different time points. twenty eight hrs-stage
trophozoites accumulated chimera within parasite endoplasmic reticulum.
in 32 hrs-stage schizonts, chimera distributed parasite cytoplasm 
but parasitophorous vacuole. 36 hrs stage-schizonts, chimera
was detected individual structures around developing merozoites and, in
contrary non-treated parasites, immature rhoptry vesicles could detected
in cytoplasm immature merozoites. data show chimera is
trafficked rhoptries via brefeldin a-sensitive pathway indicating that
this trafficking similar endogenous rhoptry proteins, 
the five amino acids downstream signal peptide cleavage site may contain
the sorting signal required rhoptry targeting.
