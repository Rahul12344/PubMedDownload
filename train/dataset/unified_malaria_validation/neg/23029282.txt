the efficacy whole-sporozoite malaria vaccine would partly determined 
the strain-specificity protective responses malarial sporozoites
and liver-stage parasites. evidence previous reports inconsistent,
where studies shown protective immunity induced irradiated 
or live sporozoites rodents humans cross-protective others
strain-specific. present work, studied strain-specificity of
live sporozoite-induced immunity using two genetically immunologically
different strains plasmodium cynomolgi, pc746 pcceylon, toque monkeys. 
two groups monkeys immunized live sporozoites either pc746
(n = 5), pcceylon (n = 4) strain, bites 2-4 sporozoite-infected 
anopheles tessellates mosquitoes per monkey concurrent treatments with
chloroquine primaquine abrogate detectable blood infections. subsequently,
a group non-immunized monkeys (n = 4), two groups immunized monkeys
were challenged mixture sporozoites two strains bites 
2-5 infective mosquitoes strain per monkey. order determine the
strain-specificity protective immunity, proportions parasites of
the two strains challenge infections quantified using allele
quantification assay, pyrosequencing™, based single nucleotide polymorphism 
(snp) parasites' circumsporozoite protein gene. pyrosequencing™ data
showed significant reduction parasites immunizing strain each
group strain-specifically immunized monkeys occurred, indicating a
stronger killing effect parasites immunizing strain. thus, the
protective immunity developed following single, live sporozoite/chloroquine
immunization, acted specifically immunizing strain was,
therefore, strain-specific. experiment allow us determine 
parasite stage strain-specific protective immunity directed, it
is possible target immunity could either pre-erythrocytic
stage, blood-stage, both.
