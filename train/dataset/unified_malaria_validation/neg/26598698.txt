genetic engineering technologies used create transgenic mosquitoes
carrying antipathogen effector genes targeting human malaria parasites to
generate gene-drive systems capable introgressing genes throughout wild
vector populations. developed highly effective autonomous clustered
regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)-associated protein 9
(cas9)-mediated gene-drive system asian malaria vector anopheles
stephensi, adapted mutagenic chain reaction (mcr). specific system 
results progeny males females derived transgenic males exhibiting 
a high frequency germ-line gene conversion consistent homology-directed
repair (hdr). system copies ∼ 17-kb construct site insertion 
to homologous chromosome faithful, site-specific manner. dual
anti-plasmodium falciparum effector genes, marker gene, autonomous
gene-drive components introgressed ∼ 99.5% progeny following
outcrosses transgenic lines wild-type mosquitoes. effector genes remain
transcriptionally inducible upon blood feeding. contrast efficient
conversion individuals expressing cas9 germ line, males and
females derived transgenic females, expected drive
component molecules egg, produce progeny high frequency of
mutations targeted genome sequence, resulting near-mendelian
inheritance ratios transgene. mutant alleles result presumably from
nonhomologous end-joining (nhej) events segregation somatic and
germ-line lineages early development. data support design this
system active strictly within germ line. strains based this
technology could sustain control elimination part malaria
