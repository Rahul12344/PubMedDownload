biological robustness allows mutations accumulate maintaining functional
phenotypes. despite crucial role evolutionary processes, mechanistic
details robustness originates remain elusive. using evolutionary
trajectory analysis approach, demonstrate robustness evolved malaria
parasites selective pressure antimalarial drug inhibiting the
folate synthesis pathway. series four nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions
at targeted enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr), render parasites
highly resistant antifolate drug pyrimethamine. nevertheless, stepwise
gain four dhfr mutations results tradeoffs pyrimethamine
resistance parasite fitness. here, report epistatic interaction
between dhfr mutations amplification gene encoding first upstream 
enzyme folate pathway, gtp cyclohydrolase (gch1). gch1 amplification
confers low level pyrimethamine resistance would thus selected by
pyrimethamine treatment. interestingly, gch1 amplification be
co-opted parasites reduces cost acquiring drug-resistant
dhfr mutations downstream metabolic pathway. compensation of
compromised fitness extra gch1 example robustness evolve a
system thus expand accessibility evolutionary trajectories leading
toward highly resistant alleles. evolution robustness gain of
drug-resistant mutations broad implications development new
drugs molecular surveillance resistance existing drugs.
