background: plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance (cqr) transporter
protein (pfcrt) known important key cqr. recent studies have
definitively demonstrated link mutations gene pfcrt and
resistance chloroquine p. falciparum. although mutations are
predictive chloroquine resistance, quantitatively predictive of
the degree resistance.
methods: study, total 95 recently adapted p. falciparum isolates
from thailand included analysis. parasites characterized for
their drug susceptibility phenotypes genotypes respect pfcrt. from
the original 95 isolates, 20 selected complete pfcrt sequence analysis.
results: almost parasites characterized carried previously
reported mutations k76t, a220s, q271e, n326s, i356t r371i. complete
sequencing, isolates identified novel mutations k76a e198k.
there suggestion parasites carrying e198k less resistant than
those not. addition, pfcrt pfmdr1 gene expression were
investigated real-time pcr. relationship expression level of
either genes response drug observed.
conclusion: data present study suggest genes must contribute 
to degree resistance resistance phenotype established 
mutations pfcrt.
