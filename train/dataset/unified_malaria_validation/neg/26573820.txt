background: genome editing malaria parasites key generation live 
attenuated parasites used experimental vaccination approaches. dna repair in
plasmodium generally occurs homologous recombination. 
used generate transgenic parasites lack one three genes, leading to
developmental arrest liver allowing host launch protective
immune response. effective principle, approach safe use 
in humans single surviving parasites still cause disease. use
zinc-finger nucleases generate attenuated parasite lines lacking entire
chromosome arm, timed induction double-strand break. rare surviving
parasites also allow investigation unconventional dna repair mechanisms in
a rodent malaria parasite.
results: single, zinc-finger nuclease-induced dna double-strand break results
in generation attenuated parasite lines show varying degrees of
developmental arrest, protection efficacy immunisation regime safety,
depending timing zinc-finger nuclease expression within life cycle.
we also identify dna repair microhomology-mediated end joining little 
as four base pairs, resulting surviving parasites thus breakthrough
infections.
conclusions: malaria parasites repair dna double-strand breaks with
surprisingly small mini-homology domains located across break point. timely
expression zinc-finger nucleases could used generate new generation of
attenuated parasite lines lacking hundreds genes.
