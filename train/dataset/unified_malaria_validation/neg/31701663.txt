membrane transport proteins, also known transporters, control movement 
ions, nutrients, metabolites, waste products across membranes cell
and central biology. proteins type also serve drug targets 
and key players phenomenon drug resistance. malaria parasite
has relatively reduced transportome, approximately 2.5% genes 
encoding transporters. even so, assigning functions physiological roles to
these proteins, ascertaining contributions drug action drug
resistance, challenging. review presents detailed critique
and synthesis disruption phenotypes, protein subcellular localisations,
protein functions (observed predicted), links antimalarial drug
resistance parasite's transporter genes. breadth depth of
the gene disruption data particularly impressive, least one phenotype
determined parasite's asexual blood stage transporter gene, and
multiple phenotypes available 76% genes. analysis curated data 
set revealed relatively little redundancy plasmodium
transportome; almost two-thirds parasite's transporter genes essential
or required normal growth asexual blood stage parasite, and
this proportion increased 78% disruption phenotypes available the
other parasite life stages included analysis. observations,
together finding 22% transportome implicated the
parasite's resistance existing antimalarials and/or drugs within the
development pipeline, indicate transporters likely serve, are
already serving, drug targets. integration different biological and
bioinformatic data sets also enabled selection candidates transport
processes known essential parasite survival, the
underlying proteins thus far remained undiscovered. include potential 
transporters pantothenate, isoleucine, isopentenyl diphosphate, well 
putative anion-selective channels may serve pore component the
parasite's 'new permeation pathways'. novel insights parasite's
biology included identification transporters potential development
of antimalarial treatments, transmission-blocking drugs, prophylactics, and
genetically attenuated vaccines. syntheses presented herein set foundation 
for elucidating functions physiological roles key members the
plasmodium transportome and, ultimately, explore realise potential
as therapeutic targets.
