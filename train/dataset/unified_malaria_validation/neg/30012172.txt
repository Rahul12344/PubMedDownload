background: plasmodium malariae characterized long asymptomatic
persistence human host. epidemiology p. malariae incompletely
understood hampered limited knowledge genetic polymorphisms.
previous reports africa shown heterogeneity within p. malariae
circumsporozoite protein (pmcsp) gene. however, comparative studies asian
countries lacking. here, genetic polymorphisms pmcsp asian isolates
have characterized.
methods: blood samples 89 symptomatic p. malariae-infected patients were
collected, thailand (n = 43), myanmar (n = 40), lao pdr (n = 5), and
bangladesh (n = 1). pmcsp amplified using semi-nested pcr sequencing. 
the resulting 89 pmcsp sequences analysed together 58 previously
published pmcsp sequences representing african countries using bioedit, mega6,
and dnasp.
results: polymorphisms identified pmcsp grouped 3 populations:
thailand, myanmar, kenya. nucleotide diversity ratio of
nonsynonymous synonymous substitutions (dn/ds) thailand myanmar were
higher compared kenya. phylogenetic analysis showed clustering of
pmcsp sequences according origin isolates (asia vs. africa). high
genetic differentiation (fst = 0.404) observed p. malariae isolates
from asian african countries. sequence analysis pmcsp showed presence 
of tetrapeptide repeat units naag, ndag, napg central repeat region
of gene. plasmodium malariae isolates asian countries carried fewer
copies naag compared african countries. napg repeat was
only observed asian isolates. additional analysis 2 t-cell epitopes, th2r
and th3r, showed limited heterogeneity p. malariae populations.
conclusions: study provides valuable information genetic
polymorphisms pmcsp isolates asia advances understanding p.
malariae population asia africa. polymorphisms central repeat
region pmcsp showed association geographical origin p. malariae
isolates potentially used marker genetic epidemiology p.
malariae population.
