malaria highly endemic yunnan province, china, incidence of
malaria highest along sino-burmese border. aim study 
determine whether genetic polymorphisms associated prevalence of
malaria among chinese residents sino-burmese border region. fourteen
otherwise healthy people glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd)
deficiency, 50 malaria patients, 67 healthy control subjects included in
our cross-sectional study. analyzed frequency g3093t t520c
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) cr1. logistic regression used to
calculate prevalence odds ratio (por) 95% confidence interval (ci) of
malaria t520c snp cr1 snps g6pd, il-4, il-4r, il-1a, nos,
cd40lg, tnf, luc7l. frequency 3093t/3093t genotype cr1 the
malaria group (0.16) significantly higher control group
(0.045, p < 0.05), significantly lower g6pd deficiency group
(0.43, p < 0.01). frequency 520t/520t genotype cr1 was
significantly higher malaria patients (0.78) control
group (0.67, p < 0.05) g6pd-deficiency group (0.36, p < 0.05). allele
of t520c variant cr1 significantly associated prevalence of
malaria (por: 1.460; 95% ci: 0.703-3.034). polymorphisms g6pd not
significantly influence prevalence malaria (p > 0.05). gtgtgtc haplotype
consisting il-1a (rs17561), il-4 (rs2243250), tnf (rs1800750), il-4r
(rs1805015), nos (rs8078340), cd40lg (rs1126535), luc7l (rs1211375) was
significantly associated prevalence malaria (por: 1.822, 95% ci:
0.998-3.324). 3093g/3093g 520t/520t genotypes predominant genetic
variants cr1 among chinese residents near sino-burmese border, t
allele t520c associated prevalence malaria region.
although g6pd deficiency protect malaria, may diminish the
association malaria cr1 polymorphisms population. the
gtgtgtc haplotype also associated prevalence malaria this
region.
