background: sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) recommended prophylactic
treatment malaria pregnancy artemisinin combination therapy the
recommended first-line anti-malarial treatment. selection sp resistance is
ongoing since sp readily available health facilities private drug
shops sub-saharan africa. study reports prevalence and
distribution pfdhps mutations a540e a581g tanzania. found
together, mutations confer high-level sp resistance (sometimes referred 
as 'super-resistance'), associated loss protective efficacy of
sp-iptp.
methods: dna samples extracted malaria-positive blood samples filter
paper, used malaria rapid diagnostic test strips whole blood collected from
eight sites seven administrative regions tanzania. pcr-rflp ssop-elisa 
techniques used genotype a540e a581g pfdhps. data analysed
using spss version 18 chi square and/or fischer exact tests used to
compare prevalence regions.
results: high inter-regional variation pfdhps-540e observed
(χ(2) = 76.8, p < 0.001). high inter-regional variation 581g observed
(fe = 85.3, p < 0.001). tanga kagera found highest
levels sp resistance. high prevalence pfdhps-581g observed tanga
(56.6 %) northeastern tanzania kagera (20.4 %) northwestern tanzania
and 540-581 eg haplotype found 54.5 19.4 %, respectively.
pfdhps-581g detected pwani lindi regions located south tanga
region.
conclusions: selection sp super-resistant pfdhps a581g highest northern 
tanzania. variation distribution sp resistance observed across the
country: northeastern tanga region northwestern kagera region highest
prevalence sp super-resistance markers, pwani lindi the
southeast prevalence super-resistance zero. studies be
conducted understand factors underlying remarkable heterogeneity sp
resistance country.
