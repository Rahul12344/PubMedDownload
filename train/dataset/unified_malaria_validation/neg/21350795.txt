the emergence chloroquine resistance plasmodium falciparum significant
public health problem malaria endemic. aimed evaluate efficacy
of pyrosequencing assess chloroquine resistance among p. falciparum isolates
from southwestern region saudi arabia analyzing k76t n86y
mutations p. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) p. 
falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1) genes, respectively. blood samples (n 
= 121) microscopically positive p. falciparum cases collected. dna 
extracted, fragments genes amplified pcr using new
sets primers. amplicons sequenced using pyrosequencer. the
121 samples amplified assessment pfcrt k76t pfmdr1 n86y
mutations. samples amplified pfcrt 76t mutation harbored the
aca codon (121/121; 100%), indicating presence 76t mutation. the
pfmdr1 n86y mutation, 72/121 samples (59.5%) sequence aat that
position, indicating presence wild-type allele (86n). however, 49/121 
samples (40.5%) tat codon, indicating mutant allele (y) position 86.
this study shows pyrosequencing could useful high throughput, rapid,
and sensitive assay detection specific single nucleotide polymorphisms
in drug-resistant p. falciparum strains. help health authorities in
malaria-endemic regions adopt new malaria control strategies be
applicable diagnostic drug resistance assays malaria other
life-threatening pathogens endemic respective countries.
