we developed convenient, robust low-cost rna detection system suitable
for high-throughput applications. system uses highly specific sandwich
hybridization capture target rna directly onto solid support, followed by
on-site signal amplification via 2-dimensional, branched hybridizing chain
polymerization toehold-mediated strand displacement reaction. assay
uses sybr green detect targets concentrations low 1 pm, without
involving nucleic acid purification enzymatic reaction, using ordinary
oligonucleotides without modification labeling. system demonstrated in
the detection malaria rna blood gapdh gene expression cell lysate.
