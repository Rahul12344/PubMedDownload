hemoglobinopathies thalassemias commonly encountered monogenic
disorders blood humans, posing major genetic public health problem
round globe. hb (hbb: c.20a>t)-β-thalassemia (β-thal) compound
aberrant heterozygosity inconsistent phenotypic expression, poorly
described clinically mapped. comprehensive genetic characterization a
population highly warranted complete understanding clinical
heterogeneity, disease prognosis therapeutic management. study, hb
s-β-thal (n = 60) patients, strictly defined varying degrees clinical
presentations, selected evaluate genotype-phenotype agreement.
furthermore, β-globin (n = 120) α-globin gene clusters (n = 60) were
genetically characterized statistically correlated clinical
terminologies explain clinical heterogeneity. results revealed the
association arab-indian haplotypes nine different frameworks of
β-thal together modulating role α-thalassemia (α-thal). study
subjects, including carriers β-thal haplotype iii [- - - - - - -] (8.0%),
presented varying severe patterns clinical symptoms painful
crisis, multiple infections splenomegaly, outcome significantly less
hb f higher hb levels (p < 0.5). study findings indicated together
with α-thal, β-thal haplotypes hb f levels, may possibly provide close
justification support clinical heterogeneity study population.
