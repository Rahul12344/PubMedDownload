artemisinin, endoperoxide sesquiterpene lactone, effective antimalarial
drug isolated chinese medicinal plant artemisia annua l. due its
effectiveness multi-drug-resistant cerebral malaria, becomes the
essential components artemisinin-based combination therapies are
recommended world health organization preferred choice malaria 
tropica treatments. date, plant a. annua still main commercial source
of artemisinin. although semi-synthesis artemisinin via artemisinic acid in
yeast feasible present, another promising approach reduce price of
artemisinin using plant metabolic engineering obtain higher content of
artemisinin transgenic plants. past years, agrobacterium-mediated
transformation system a. annua established number genes
related artemisinin biosynthesis successfully transferred a.
annua plants. review, progress increasing artemisinin content in
a. annua transgenic approach future prospect summarized and
discussed.
