radicicol, antifungal antibiotic, previously identified compound
having antimalarial activity. however, mechanism action plasmodium
falciparum elucidated. characterizing antimalarial function, we
observed radicicol manifested two distinct developmental defects cultured
p. falciparum concentration-dependent manner. low concentration of
radicicol, significant percentage drug-treated parasites arrested at
the schizont stage, higher concentration, parasites unable to
multiply schizont ring. also, newly formed rings trophozoites
were extremely delayed development, eventually leading cell death. we
intended characterize potential molecular target radicicol its
sublethal doses. results demonstrated radicicol specifically impaired
mitochondrial replication. decrement associated severalfold
increment topoisomerase vib transcript well protein treated cells
over untreated parasites. topoisomerase vib found localized 
the organelle fraction. docking study revealed radicicol fits the
bergerat fold pf topoisomerase vib present atpase domain. altogether,
these data allow us conclude p. falciparum topoisomerase vib might one
of targets radicicol causing inhibition mitochondrial replication.
hence, radicicol suitably employed explore mitochondrial physiology
of malaria parasites.
