hemoglobin (hb) concentration outcome interaction genetic
variation environmental factors, including nutritional status, sex, age, 
altitude. genetic diversity influencing protein complex varies widely
across populations. variants related abnormal hb altered characteristics of
the erythrocytes increase risk anemia. prevalent related 
the inherited globin abnormalities affecting hb production structure.
malaria-endemic regions harbor highest frequencies variants associated
with frequent monogenic diseases risk nonnutritional anemia 
and considered public health problems. variation genes encoding for
enzymes membrane proteins red blood cells also influence erythrocyte life 
span risk anemia. variants rare. interindividual
variability hematological parameters also influenced common genetic
variation across whole genome. identified variants associated
with hb production, erythropoiesis, iron metabolism. specialized databases
have developed organize update large body available
information genetic variation related hb variation, frequency,
geographical distribution, clinical significance. present review analyzed
the underlying genetic factors affect hb concentrations, clinical
relevance, geographical distribution across populations.
