the majority malaria rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) detect plasmodium
falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (pfhrp2), encoded pfhrp2 gene.
recently, p. falciparum isolates peru found lack pfhrp2 leading to
false-negative rdt results. hypothesized pfhrp2-deleted parasites peru
derived single genetic event. evaluated parasite population
structure pfhrp2 haplotype samples collected 1998 2005 using
seven neutral seven chromosome 8 microsatellite markers, respectively. five
distinct pfhrp2 haplotypes, corresponding five neutral microsatellite-based
clonal lineages, detected 1998-2001; pfhrp2 deletions occurred within
four haplotypes. 2003-2005, outcrossing among parasite lineages resulted
in eight population clusters inherited five pfhrp2 haplotypes seen
previously new haplotype; pfhrp2 deletions occurred within four these
haplotypes. findings indicate genetic origin pfhrp2 deletion in
peru single event, likely occurred multiple times.
