introduction: knockdown resistance (kdr) strongly linked pyrethroid
insecticide resistance anopheles gambiae africa, may vital
significance current increased use pyrethroid-treated bed net
programmes. study aimed determining species composition, levels of
insecticide resistance, knockdown patterns anopheles gambiae sensu lato in
areas areas without insecticide resistance teso north teso south 
subcounties, western kenya.
materials methods: vulnerability tests, mosquito larvae sampled 
using dipper, reared 3-5-day-old female mosquitoes (4944 100 mosquitoes
per insecticide) exposed 0.75% permethrin, 0.05% deltamethrin, 
0.1% bendiocarb using tube assay method. species identification kdr
east gene pcrs also performed randomly selected mosquitoes the
collections; including adult mosquitoes (3448) sampled using standard collection 
methods.
results: anopheles gambiae sensu stricto majority terms species
composition 78.9%. bendiocarb caused 100% mortality deltamethrin had
higher insecticidal effects (77%) female mosquitoes permethrin (71%).
susceptible kengatunyi cluster higher proportion an. arabiensis (20.9%)
than resistant rwatama (10.7%). kengatunyi mosquitoes exposed deltamethrin had
the highest kdt50 r 8.2. anopheles gambiae sensu stricto anopheles
arabiensis equal allelic frequency 0.84. indoor resting mosquitoes had
100% mortality rate 24 h since exposure. overall ss genotypic frequency 
teso north teso south subcounties 79.4% 13.7% homozygous ll
genotype 6.9% heterozygous ls genotype. significant difference (ρ
< 0.05) allele frequencies kengatunyi (0.61) rwatama (0.95).
mosquito samples collected 2013 highest allelic frequency 0.87.
discussion. likely, higher selection pressure exerted indoors by
insecticidal nets, higher resistance alleles. use pyrethroid
impregnated nets agrochemicals may caused female mosquitoes select
for pyrethroid resistance. different modes action chemical properties in
different types pyrethroids aggravated variety edaphic climatic
factors may caused different levels susceptibility indoor and
outdoor vectors pyrethroids carbamate. species composition populations
in collection method may influenced insecticide resistance
capacity different species. conclusions recommendations. phenotypic
and genotypic insecticide resistance levels confirmed teso north and
teso south subcounties western kenya. insecticide resistance management
practices kenya fast tracked harmonized agricultural sector
agrochemical-based activities legislation, possibly switch carbamate
use order ease selection pressure pyrethroids useable in
insecticidal nets indoor residual spray due low human toxicity. 
implication high resistance levels mosquitoes collected teso
subcounties resistance likely persist even increase if
monomolecules permethrin deltamethrin continue used all
net- nonnet-based mosquito control purposes. usage mutually reinforcing
piperonyl butoxide (pbo) prohibits particular enzymes vital metabolic
activities inside mosquito systems integrated pyrethroid-llins 
to create pyrethroid-pbo nets extremely viable option.
