malaria major disease tropics chemotherapy remains main
mode treatment rise spread drug-resistant malaria can
lead human tragedy. two membrane transport proteins, pfmdr1 (plasmodium
falciparum multidrug resistance protein 1) pfcrt (p. falciparum chloroquine
resistance transporter), shown cause resistance several
antimalarials. pfmdr1 pfcrt localized digestive vacuolar
membrane appear regulate transport drugs physiological
metabolites. study used mk571, 2-amino quinoline, explore
its interaction pfmdr1 pfcrt chloroquine-sensitive -resistant
strains p. falciparum. results show chloroquine-resistant strains
(e.g., k1, dd2, 7g8) consistently sensitive mk571 than
chloroquine-sensitive strains (e.g., 3d7, 106/1 d10). association,
however, maintained chloroquine-resistant strain fcb ic50 
value similar chloroquine-sensitive strains. moreover, susceptibility 
of chloroquine-sensitive -resistant strains mk571 correlate 
mutated pfcrt, reversible verapamil; correlates mutations
in pfmdr1. furthermore, mk571 appears target parasite's digestive vacuole 
(dv), demonstrated ability mk571 to: (1) block accumulation of
the fluorescent dye fluo-4 am, pfmdr1 substrate, digestive vacuole;
(2) reduce transvacuolar ph gradient; (3) inhibit formation of
β-hematin vitro. moreover, presence non-toxic concentrations mk571
sensitized chloroquine-sensitive -resistant parasites mefloquine 
halofantrine, likely competing pfmdr1-mediated sequestering the
drugs dv compartment away drugs' cytosolic targets. our
data, nevertheless, found minimal decrease mk571 ic50 value fcb
parasite second pfmdr1 copy inactivated via gene disruption. taken
together, findings study suggest mk571 interacts native and
mutant pfmdr1 modulates import drugs solutes parasite's dv
and, such, mk571 may useful tool characterization pfmdr1 drug
interactions substrate specificity.
