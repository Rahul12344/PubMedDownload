background: since 2011, artesunate + sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (asp), instead of
chloroquine, recommended treatment uncomplicated malaria in
india. ujjain, central india, annual parasite index <0.1, the
prevalence drug-resistant plasmodium falciparum unknown. parts 
india chloroquine sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine-resistant p. falciparum is
prevalent. aim study determine prevalence anti-malarial
drug resistance-associated genetic polymorphisms p. falciparum collected in
ujjain 2009 2010, prior introduction asp.
methods: blood samples 87 patients p. falciparum mono-infection
verified microscopy collected filter-paper nine major pathology
laboratories ujjain city. codons pfcrt 72-76, pfmdr1 1034-1246, pfdhfr 16-185,
pfdhps 436-632 pfnhe1 ms4760 haplotypes identified sequencing. pfcrt 
k76t pfmdr1 n86y identified restriction fragment length polymorphism,
and pfmdr1 gene copy number real-time pcr.
results: sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance-associated pfdhfr 108 n 59r
alleles found 75/78 (96%) 70/78 (90%) samples, respectively, and
pfdhps 437g found 7/77 (9%) samples. double mutant pfdhfr 59r + 108 n were
found 62/76 (82%) samples. triple mutant pfdhfr 59r + 108 n pfdhps 437g
were found 6/76 (8%) samples. chloroquine-resistance-associated pfcrt 76 was
found 82/87 (94%). pfcrt 72-76 haplotypes found were: 80/84 (95%) svmnt,
3/84 (4%) cvmnk 1/84 (1%) cvmnt. pfmdr1 n86 86y identified 70/83 
(84%) 13/83 (16%) samples, respectively. pfmdr1 s1034 + n1042 + d1246 were
identified together 70/72 (97%) successfully sequenced samples. one pfmdr1 
gene copy found 74/75 (99%) successfully amplified samples.
conclusion: first characterization key anti-malarial drug
resistance-associated genetic markers among p. falciparum collected ujjain,
madhya pradesh, india. results indicate efficacy standard dose
chloroquine time study likely poor, whereas asp was
likely efficacious, supporting changed drug treatment policy. however, 
p. falciparum reduced susceptibility sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine highly
prevalent, highlighting need continuous surveillance asp efficacy in
the study area.
