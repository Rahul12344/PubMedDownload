plasmodium vivax prevalent human malaria parasite outside africa. 
yet, studies aimed identify genes signatures consistent natural
selection rare. here, present comparative analysis pattern of
genetic variation five sequenced isolates p. vivax divergence 
two closely related species, plasmodium cynomolgi plasmodium knowlesi, using 
a set orthologous genes. contrast plasmodium falciparum, parasite
that causes lethal form human malaria, find significant
constraints evolution synonymous sites genome wide p. vivax. the
comparative analysis polymorphism divergence across loci allowed us to
identify 87 genes patterns consistent positive selection, including
genes involved "exportome" p. vivax, potentially involved 
evasion host immune system. nevertheless, found pattern of
polymorphism genome wide consistent significant amount of
constraint replacement changes prevalent negative selection. our
analyses also show silent polymorphism tends larger toward ends of
the chromosomes, many genes involved antigenicity located,
suggesting natural selection acts shaping patterns of
variation within genes also affects genome organization.
