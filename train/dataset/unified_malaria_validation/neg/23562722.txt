dead box rna helicases play crucial roles rna metabolism splicing,
ribosome biogenesis, rna transport, degradation translation. ddx6/dozi
(development zygote inhibited) one well characterized member 
dead box family highly conserved humans malaria parasite. ddx6 
involved variety biological processes, include sexual
development protozoan parasite. present manuscript report that
p. falciparum dozi (ddx6 homologue); pfdz50 contains characteristic dna and
rna binding, nucleic acid-dependent atpase rna unwinding activities.
enzymatic characterization truncated derivatives pfdz50 pfdz50t1
(domain 1) pfdz50t2 (domain 2) shows none contains atpase
activity. furthermore, confirmed pfdz50 interacts pfeif4e mainly
through domain 1. using vitro translation assays show pfdz50 inhibits 
translation. assays report externally added pfeif4e
restores ~70% translation. using immunofluorescence assays demonstrate that
pfdz50 localized mainly cytoplasm asexual intraerythrocytic
developmental stages p. falciparum. localization pattern suggests 
that pfdz50 appears typically granular bodies throughout cytoplasm. thus
these studies advance knowledge regarding function pfdz50/ddx6 in
general.
