background: plasmodium vivax responsible approximately 80 million malaria 
cases world. apical membrane antigen1 (ama-1) type integral
membrane protein present plasmodium species. ama-1 interferes critical 
steps invasion human hepatocytes sporozoites red blood cells by
merozoites one immunodominant antigens eliciting a
protective immune response human. considered promising antigen 
inclusion vaccine p. vivax. since knowledge needed to
lighten scope antigen compared genetic variation p. vivax
ama-1from iranian isolate reported malarious
countries far.
methods: p. vivax genomic dna extracted whole blood iranian
patient patent p. vivax infection. nucleotide sequence 446 amino
acid (aa) residues (42-488 pvama-1) amplified pcr cloned puc19
vector sequencing.
results: sequence analysis antigen showed high degree identity (99%) 
with strong homology pvama-1 gene p. vivax s3 sko814 isolates 
india korea (asian isolates) respectively, 96% similarity p. vivax
sal-1 ama-1 gene el salvador.
conclusions: cloned characterized three domains pvama-1 gene an
iranian patient. predicted protein sequence gene showed some
discrepancies corresponding protein comparing similar genes reported
from malarious countries.
