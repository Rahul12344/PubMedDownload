a large proportion death toll associated malaria consequence 
malaria infection pregnancy, causing 200,000 infant deaths annually.
we previously published first extensive genetic association study of
placental malaria infection, extend analysis considerably,
investigating genetic variation 9,000 snps 1,000 genes
involved immunity inflammation involvement susceptibility 
placental malaria infection. applied new approach incorporating results from
both single gene analysis well gene-gene interactions protein-protein 
interaction network. found suggestive associations variants gene
klrk1 single gene analysis, well evidence associations of
multiple members il-7/il-7r signalling cascade combined analysis.
to knowledge, first large-scale genetic study placental
malaria infection date, opening door follow-up studies trying to
elucidate genetic basis neglected form malaria.
