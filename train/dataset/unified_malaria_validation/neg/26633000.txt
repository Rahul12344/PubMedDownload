genetic factors likely contribute low severe malaria case fatality
rates melanesian populations, association studies underpowered 
may provide plausible mechanistic explanations significant associations
are detected. preparation genome-wide association study, 29 candidate
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) minor allele frequencies >5% were
examined case-control study 504 papua new guinean children severe
malaria. parallel, immunological substudy performed convalescent
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) cases controls. following
stimulation toll-like receptor (tlr) 1/2 agonist, effector cytokines and
chemokines assayed. significant genetic association observed
involved nonsynonymous snp (tlr1rs4833095) tlr1 gene. recessive (tt)
genotype associated reduced odds severe malaria 0.52 (95%
confidence interval (0.29-0.90), p=0.006). concentrations pro-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin-1β tumour necrosis factor α significantly higher
in severe malaria cases compared healthy controls, lower children
with protective recessive (tt) genotype. genetic variant tlr1 may
contribute low severe malaria case fatality rates region a
reduced pro-inflammatory cellular phenotype.
