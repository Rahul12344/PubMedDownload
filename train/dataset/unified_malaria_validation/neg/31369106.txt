background: malaria control efforts sudan rely heavily case management. 
2004, health authorities adopted artemisinin-based combination therapies (acts)
for treatment uncomplicated malaria. however, recent surveys have
reported act failure prevalent irrational malaria treatment practice. 
we examine whether widespread use act failure adhere national
guidelines led evolution drug resistance genes.
methods: genotyped known drug resistance markers (pfcrt, pfmdr-1, pfdhfr,
pfdhps, pfk13 propeller) flanking microsatellites among plasmodium
falciparum isolates obtained 2009 2016 different geographical
regions sudan. data compared published findings pre-act
(1992-2003).
results: high prevalence pfcrt76t, pfmdr-1-86y, pfdhfr51i, pfdhfr108n,
pfdhps37g observed regions, pfk13 mutations detected.
compared pre-act data, pfcrt-76t pfmdr-1-86y decayed, while
pfdhfr-51i, pfdhfr-108n pfdhps-437g strengthened. haplotypes pfcrt-cviet,
pfmdr-1-nfsnd/yfsnd, pfdhfr-icni pfdhps-sgkaa predominated sites.
microsatellites flanking drug resistance genes showed lower diversity than
neutral ones, signifying high act pressure/selection.
conclusions: evaluation p. falciparum drug resistance genes sudan matches
the drug deployment pattern. regular monitoring genes, coupled with
clinical response, considered combat spread act resistance.
