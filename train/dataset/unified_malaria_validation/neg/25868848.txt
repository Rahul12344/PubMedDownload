avian malaria one common veterinary problems southeast asia.
the standard molecular method detection avian malaria parasite
involves phenol-chloroform extraction parasite genomic (g)dna followed 
the amplification parasite gdna using polymerase chain reaction (pcr).
however, phenol-chloroform extraction method time-consuming requires
large amounts samples toxic organic solvents, thereby limiting its
applications parasite detection field. study aimed compare the
performance chelex-100 resin phenol/chloroform extraction methods 
extraction plasmodium gallinaceum gdna whole avian blood been
dried filter papers (a common field sampling method). specificity and
sensitivity pcr assays p. gallinaceum cytochrome b (cytb) cytochrome
oxidase subunit (coxi) gene fragments (544 588bp, respectively) were
determined, found sensitive gdna extracted chelex-100 
resin method phenol/chloroform method. pcr assays also
performed detect p. gallinaceum 29 blood samples dried filter papers
from domestic chickens malaria endemic area, reliable
identification seven field isolates p. gallinaceum obtained an
accuracy 100%. analysis cytb coxi gene nucleotide sequences
revealed existence least two genetically distinct populations p.
gallinaceum thailand, differed reference strain 8a of
p. gallinaceum. conclusion, chelex-100 resin extraction method simple
and sensitive method isolating gdna whole avian blood dried filter
paper. genomic dna extracted chelex method could subsequently applied
for pcr-based detection p. gallinaceum dna sequencing. pcr assays 
provide reliable diagnostic tool molecular epidemiological studies p.
gallinaceum infections domestic chickens wild birds.
