protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (prmt1) arginine-specific protein
methyltransferase methylates number proteins involved transcription 
and rna metabolism parasitic helminths, including human blood fluke,
schistosoma japonicum. characterize role prmt1 development s.
japonicum investigate influence parasite-host interactions, we
cloned expressed protein existing cdna library. report that
the clone encoded polypeptide comprising 360 amino acids predictive mr
of 42 kda. bioinformatic analyses predicted many potential b cell
epitopes cell epitopes associated sjcprmt1, suggesting a
potential candidate molecule vaccine development. purified recombinant
protein s. japonicum (chinese strain) (rsjcprmt1) found immunogenic,
eliciting high antibody titer mice. moreover, western blot analysis revealed
that protein could recognized sera infected mice. using flow
cytometry, showed rsjcprmt1 slightly upregulated expression cd40, 
cd80, cd86, mhc-ii molecules mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cell
(bmdc), indicating rsjcprmt1 could induce mouse bmdc mature and,
therefore, activate immune response. overall, findings provide evidence
that rsjcprmt1 could serve effective candidate molecule development
of vaccine infection s. japonicum.
