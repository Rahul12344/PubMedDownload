evasion clinical interventions streptococcus pneumoniae occurs through
selection non-susceptible genomic variants. report whole-genome sequencing 
of 3,085 pneumococcal carriage isolates 2.4-km(2) refugee camp. this
sequencing provides unprecedented resolution process recombination 
its impact population evolution. genomic recombination hotspots show
remarkable consistency lineages, indicating common selective pressures
acting certain loci, particularly associated antibiotic resistance.
temporal changes antibiotic consumption reflected changes in
recombination trends, demonstrating rapid spread resistance selective
pressure high. highest frequencies receipt donation recombined
dna fragments observed non-encapsulated lineages, implying this
largely overlooked pneumococcal group, beyond reach current
vaccines, may major role genetic exchange adaptation the
species whole. findings advance understanding pneumococcal
population dynamics provide information design future intervention
strategies.
