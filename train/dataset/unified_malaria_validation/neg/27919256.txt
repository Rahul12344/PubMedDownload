background: plasmodium falciparum resistance anti-malarial drugs remains a
major obstacle malaria control elimination. parasite developed
resistance every anti-malarial drug introduced wide-scale treatment.
however, spread resistance may reversible. malawi first country
to discontinue chloroquine use due widespread resistance. within decade of
the removal drug pressure, molecular marker chloroquine-resistant
malaria disappeared drug shown excellent clinical
efficacy. many countries observed decreases prevalence chloroquine
resistance discontinuation chloroquine use. zambia, chloroquine
was used first-line treatment uncomplicated malaria treatment
failures led ministry health replace artemether-lumefantrine in
2003. specimens recent study analysed evaluate prevalence of
chloroquine-resistant malaria nchelenge district decade chloroquine
use discontinued.
methods: parasite dna extracted dried blood spots collected by
finger-prick pregnant women enrolling clinical trial. the
specimens underwent pyrosequencing determine genotype p. falciparum
chloroquine resistance transporter, gene associated cq
resistance.
results: three-hundred two specimens successfully analysed. no
chloroquine-resistant genotypes detected.
conclusion: study found disappearance chloroquine-resistant malaria
after removal chloroquine drug pressure. chloroquine may role for
malaria prevention treatment zambia throughout region the
future.
