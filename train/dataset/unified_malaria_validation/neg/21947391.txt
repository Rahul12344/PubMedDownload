plasmodium falciparum isolates decreased susceptibility quinine are
increasingly found malaria patients. mechanisms involved this
resistance yet understood. several studies claim alongside mutations
in pfcrt pfmdr1 genes, pfnhe-1 na(+)/h(+) exchanger polymorphism
plays role decreasing susceptibility. however, conflicting results the
link pfnhe-1 gene quinine resistance arise field- and
culture-adapted isolates. tested association pfnhe-1, pfcrt, and
pfmdr1 polymorphisms field- culture-adapted isolates various
countries vitro susceptibility quinine. field isolates presented
a higher diversity pfnhe-1 microsatellite sequence culture-adapted
isolates. culture-adapted isolates field isolates, mutations the
pfcrt pfmdr1 genes, well higher number dnnnd repeats the
pfnhe-1 gene, associated higher 50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50))
of quinine. furthermore, culture-adapted isolates one 
dnnnd repeat pfnhe-1 gene also harbored mutated pfcrt pfmdr1 genes
with apparent cumulative effect quinine susceptibility. study supports
the involvement pfnhe-1 gene modulation vitro quinine
response associated mutated pfcrt pfmdr1 genes. culture adaptation 
could responsible selection specific haplotypes three genes.
methods used drug testing might thus influence association between
pfnhe-1 polymorphism quinine susceptibility. however, exclude the
possibility particular settings, pfnhe-1 polymorphism used a
molecular marker surveillance quinine resistance.
