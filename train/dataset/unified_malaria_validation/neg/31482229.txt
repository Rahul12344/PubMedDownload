purpose: patients respond well cancer chemotherapy. one most
important factors contributing treatment response (efficacy toxicity) is
genetic determinant. current systematic review aims provide current status
of information genetic contribution genes encoding drug transport
proteins drug metabolizing enzyme, cytochrome p450 (cyp), relationship
with clinical outcomes cancer chemotherapy.
methods: literature search performed pubmed sciencedirect
databases. one hundred four research articles fulfilled inclusion
criteria none exclusion criteria included analysis.
results: various studies reported conflicting results polymorphisms of
the major genes association treatment outcomes patients various 
types cancer. nevertheless, among investigated gene polymorphisms, it
appears 1236c>t, 3435c>t 2677 g>t/a snps drug transporter
gene abcb1 promising determinants clinical outcomes. although
both 1236c>t 3435c>t polymorphism synonymous snps, several studies have
demonstrated synonymous snps silent. therefore, using the
haplotype (1236c>t, 2677g>t, 3435c>t) analysis rather single snp may
be useful approach phenotype prediction. patients with
variants cyp genes associated unsatisfactory treatment response
(efficacy toxicity), suggesting variants may associated with
either reduction absence cyp enzyme activity.
conclusions: controversial results may due several factors including
difference populations studied, sample size, tumor sites stages,
chemotherapeutic drug regimens, evaluation parameters efficacy and/or
toxicity. information successfully applied individualized
cancer chemotherapy, studies focused promising genetic
markers association clinical outcomes using standardized
protocols.
