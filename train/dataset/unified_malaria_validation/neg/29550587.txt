malaria parasites utilize methylerythritol phosphate (mep) pathway synthesis 
of isoprenoid precursors essential maturation survival of
parasites erythrocytic gametocytic stages. absence mep pathway 
in human host establishes mep pathway enzymes repertoire essential
drug targets. fourth enzyme, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2c-methyl-d-erythritol kinase
(ispe) proved essential pathogenic bacteria, however; yet 
been studied plasmodium species. study undertaken investigate 
genetic polymorphism concomitant structural implications plasmodium
vivax ispe (pvispe) employing sequencing, modeling bioinformatics
approach. report pvispe gene displayed six non-synonymous mutations which
were restricted non-conserved regions within gene seven
topographically distinct malaria-endemic regions india. phylogenetic studies
reflected pvispe occupies unique status within plasmodia genus reflects 
that plasmodium vivax ispe gene distant non-conserved relation with
human ortholog mevalonate kinase (mavk). structural modeling analysis revealed
that pvispe indian isolates critically conserved canonical
galacto-homoserine-mevalonate-phosphomevalonate kinase (ghmp) domain within the
active site lying deep cleft sandwiched atp cdpme-binding
domains. active core region highly conserved among clinical isolates,
may due >60% β-pleated rigid architecture. mapped structural analysis
revealed critically conserved active site pvispe, sequence, and
spacially among indian isolates; showing significant changes active
site. study strengthens candidature plasmodium vivax ispe enzyme 
future target novel antimalarials.
