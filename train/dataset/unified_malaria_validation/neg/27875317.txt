cyp2d6 important cytochrome p450 enzyme plays important role the
metabolism 25% currently prescribed drugs. presence of
polymorphisms cyp2d6 gene may modulate enzyme level activity, thereby 
affecting individual responses pharmacological treatments. prevalent 
diseases admixed population venezuela cardiovascular cancer, 
whereas viral, bacterial parasitic diseases, particularly malaria, are
prevalent amerindian populations; treatment diseases, several 
drugs metabolized cyp2d6 used. work, reviewed data
on cyp2d6 variability predicted metabolizer phenotypes, healthy volunteers
of two admixed five amerindian populations venezuela. venezuelan
population heterogeneous result genetic admixture three
major ethnical components: europeans, africans amerindians. are
noticeable inter-regional inter-population differences process of
mixing population. hitherto, published studies venezuela
on cyp2d6; therefore, necessary increase research regard, in
particular develop studies larger sample size. considerable 
amount work remaining cyp2d6 integrated clinical practice in
venezuela.
