schistosomiasis widespread parasitic infection affects humans, well 
as wild domestic animals. ranks second malaria, significant
health socio-economic impact developing countries. objective of
this study assess anti-schistosomal impact ziziphus spina-christi
leaf extract (zle) schistosoma mansoni-induced liver fibrosis cd-1 swiss
male albino mice. s. mansoni infection achieved dipping mouse tails 
schistosomal cercariae. zle treatment initiated 46 days post-infection 
administering dose extract daily basis 10 consecutive days. s. 
mansoni infection resulted liver granuloma fibrosis, drastic
elevation liver function factors, nitric oxide, lipid peroxidation, 
were associated reduction glutathione content substantial
inhibition antioxidant enzyme activities compared control.
induction hepatic granuloma, oxidative stress, fibrosis liver was
controlled zle administration, also produced inhibition matrix
metalloproteinase-9, alpha-smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor-Î², and
tissue inhibitors metalloproteinases expressions. addition, s.
mansoni-infected group exhibited increase bax caspase-3 levels a
decrease bcl-2 level. however, treatment zle mainly mitigated apoptosis
in liver. thus, findings study revealed ziziphus
spina-christi anti-apoptotic, anti-fibrotic, antioxidant, protective
effects s. mansoni-induced liver wounds. benefits ziziphus
spina-christi extract s. mansoni partly partially mediated enhancing
anti-fibrinogenic nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (nrf2)
pathways.
