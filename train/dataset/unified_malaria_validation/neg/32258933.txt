a phenotypic whole cell high-throughput screen asexual blood and
liver stages malaria parasite identified benzimidazole chemical series. 
among hits antiemetic benzimidazole drug lerisetron 1 (ic50 nf54 =
0.81 μm) methyl-substituted analogue 2 (ic50 nf54 = 0.098 μm). a
medicinal chemistry hit lead effort led identification of
chloro-substituted analogue 3 high potency drug-sensitive nf54
(ic50 nf54 = 0.062 μm) multidrug-resistant k1 (ic50 k1 = 0.054 μm) strains of
the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum. compounds 2 3 gratifyingly 
showed vivo efficacy plasmodium berghei p. falciparum mouse models
of malaria. cardiotoxicity risk expressed strong inhibition human
ether-a-go-go-related gene (herg) potassium channel identified major
liability address. led synthesis biological assessment of
around 60 analogues several compounds improved antiplasmodial
potency, relative lead compound 3, identified.
