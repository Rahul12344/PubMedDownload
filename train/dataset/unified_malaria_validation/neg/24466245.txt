background: plasmodium falciparum malaria treated 25 mg/kg chloroquine
(cq) irrespective age. theoretically, cq dosed according body
surface area (bsa). effect dosing cq according bsa been
determined doubling dose per kg doubled efficacy cq children
aged <15 years infected p. falciparum carrying cq resistance causing genes
typical africa. study aim determine effect age cq
concentrations.
methods findings: day 7 whole blood cq concentrations determined 150 
and 302 children treated 25 50 mg/kg, respectively, previously
conducted clinical trials. cq concentrations normalised dose taken in
mg/kg cq decreased decreasing age (p<0.001). cq concentrations normalised
for dose taken mg/m(2) unaffected age. median cq concentration 
children aged <2 years taking 50 mg/kg children aged 10-14 years taking 25
mg/kg 825 (95% confidence interval [ci] 662-988) 758 (95% ci 640-876)
nmol/l, respectively (p = 0.67). median cq concentration children aged
10-14 taking 50 mg/kg children aged 0-2 taking 25 mg/kg 1521 549
nmol/l. adverse events age/concentration dependent.
conclusions: cq under-dosed children ideally dosed according 
to bsa. children aged <2 years need approximately double dose per kg to
attain cq concentrations found children aged 10-14 years. clinical trials
assessing efficacy cq africa typically performed children aged
<5 years. thus efficacy cq typically assessed children cq is
under dosed. approximately 3 fold higher drug concentrations probably be
safely given youngest children. cq resistance concentration
dependent alternative dosing cq may overcome resistance africa.
