ethnopharmacological relevance: species aspidosperma known popularly as
"peroba, guatambu, carapanaúba, pau-pereiro" "quina". genus found 
in americas, mainly mexico argentina. many species of
aspidosperma used population treating cardiovascular diseases,
malaria, fever, diabetes rheumatism. phytochemical aspects species
of genus aspidosperma studied extensively. monoterpene indole
alkaloids main secondary metabolites aspidosperma species, about
250 isolated showing considerable structural diversity.
several showed important pharmacological activities.
aspidosperma subincanum mart. aspidosperma tomentosum mart. (apocynaceae) are
brazilian species widely used population treat diabetes mellitus,
hypercholesterolemia. pharmacological activities species been
investigated biological properties described related their
isolated indole alkaloids. however, pharmacological studies needed in
order justify use species folk medicine. review, we
present reports mainly focused chemical biological studies their
relationship ethnopharmacological use aspidosperma species.
aim study: aim review present ethnopharmacological
use correlated biological activities described extracts
and isolated compounds aspidosperma subincanum mart. aspidosperma
tomentosum mart. addition, aspects related biosynthetic pathways
are discussed, also nmr assignments synthesis information indole
alkaloids aspidosperma species included.
material methods: bibliographic search made theses and
dissertations using databases ndltd (networked digital library of
theses dissertations), oatd (open access theses dissertations) google
scholar. data gathered books, brazilian journals articles
available electronic databases as, google scholar, pubchem, scifinder,
web science, scielo, pubmed science direct. additionally, google
patents espacenet patent search (epo) also consulted. keywords
aspidosperma, a. subincanum, a. tomentosum, indole alkaloids used the
research. languages restricted portuguese, english spanish and
references selected according relevance.
results: a. subincanum mart. a. tomentosum mart. (apocynaceae) brazilian 
species widely used population treat diseases. extracts and
isolated compounds species shown antitumor antimalarial
activities. antitumor activity isolated compounds extensively
studied. however, antiplasmodial activity needs investigated as
well anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperlipidemic anorexigenic activities.
from a. subincanum twenty-one indole alkaloids isolated them
have extensively studied. leaves bark a. tomentosum four
alkaloids one flavonoid isolated. furthermore, cg-ms analysis seeds, 
branches, leaves arils identified nine indole alkaloids. stemmadenine has
been proposed precursor indole alkaloids obtained species of
aspidosperma. many biosynthetic steps characterized the
enzymatic level appropriate genes identified, however, steps 
have yet investigated still controversial. isolated
alkaloids a. subincanum a. tomentosum identified mass
spectrometry. many cases, nmr data either available was
incomplete. described meta-analysis available nmr data revealed that
the chemical shifts belonging indole ring might used characterize
this class alkaloids within complex matrices plant extracts. the
biological activities structural complexity compounds have
stimulated interest many groups synthesis. review, some
information synthesis indole alkaloids derivatives was
presented.
conclusions: a. subincanum a. tomentosum used population brazil
to treat many diseases. biological activities described extracts
and isolated compounds species agreement the
ethnopharmacological use others species aspidosperma, as,
antimalarial, treatment diabetes illnesses. species are
sources leading compounds used developing new drugs. in
addition, biological activities reported suggested by
ethnopharmacological data yet investigated could interesting
area search new bioactive compounds.
