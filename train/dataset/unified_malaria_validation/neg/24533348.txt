plasmodium (novyella) nucleophilum identified using microscopy pcr, an
egyptian goose (alopochen aegyptiacus) died são paulo zoo, brazil. this
parasite characterized elongated gametocytes, small meronts scant
cytoplasm, less eight merozoites mainly stages
appressed nuclei infected erythrocytes. additionally, plasmodium
(haemamoeba) sp. identified microscopy blood sample. the
latter parasite lacks nucleophilic blood stages characterized large
roundish trophozoites, large prominent centrally collated vacuole.
this co-infection confirmed pcr amplification mitochondrial
cytochrome b (cytb) gene sequencing; one plasmodium sp. cytb sequence
was detected blood sample. since parasitemia p. nucleophilum (2.4%) was
much higher p. (haemamoeba) sp. (0.2%), pcr may favored the
amplification cytb sequence former. phylogenetic analysis in
agreement conclusion reported cytb sequence positioned 
in branch sequences several novyella species. first
assignment mitochondrial cytb gene sequence p. nucleophilum. p.
(haemamoeba) parasite particularly similar plasmodium (haemamoeba) tejerai,
because advanced trophozoites young erythrocytic meronts possess large 
vacuole prominent pigment granules arranged around it, characteristic
features development species. definitive identification p.
(haemamoeba) species, mature meronts gametocytes required; however, these
were absent thin blood smear. representative images blood stages 
of p. nucleophilum p. (haemamoeba) sp. provided. together microscopy
data, p. nucleophilum cytb sequence assist molecular identification
(barcoding) plasmodium species birds.
