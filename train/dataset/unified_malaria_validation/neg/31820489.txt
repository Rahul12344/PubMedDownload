genetic association studies popular identifying genetic variants, as
single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), associated complex traits. 
statistical tests commonly performed one snp time assumed mode
of inheritance recessive, additive, dominant genetic model. such
analysis result inadequate power employed model deviates the
underlying true genetic model. propose integrative association test
procedure generalized linear model framework flexibly model data
from three common genetic models beyond. computationally
efficient resampling procedure adopted estimate null distribution of
the proposed test statistic. simulation results show methods maintain
the type error rate irrespective existence confounding covariates and
achieve adequate power compared methods true genetic model. the
new methods applied two genetic studies resistance severe
