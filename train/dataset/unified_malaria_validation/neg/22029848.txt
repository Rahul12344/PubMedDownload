background: sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) resistance widespread
throughout east southern africa artemisinin compounds combination with
synthetic drugs (act) recommended replacement treatments world
health organization (who). well high cure rates, act shown slow
the development resistance partner drug areas low moderate
transmission. study looked evidence protection partner drug in
a high transmission african context. evaluation part large combination
therapy pilot implementation programme tanzania, interdisciplinary
monitoring programme antimalarial combination therapy (impact-tz) methods:
the growth resistant dhfr parasite population sp monotherapy was
the first-line treatment measured four years (2002-2006), compared
with development resistant dhfr neighbouring population sp +
artesunate (sp+as) used first-line treatment interval.
the effect differing treatment regimes emergence resistance 
addressed three ways. first, looking rate increase frequency
of pre-existing mutant dhfr alleles monotherapy combination therapy.
second, examining whether de-novo mutant alleles emerged either
treatment. finally, measuring diversity three dhfr flanking microsatellite 
loci upstream dhfr gene.
results: reduction sp selection pressure resulting adoption of
act slowed rate increase frequency triple mutant resistant
dhfr allele. comparing two populations, higher levels genetic 
diversity sequence flanking dhfr triple mutant allele population
where act regimen used indicates reduction sp selection
pressure arising combination therapy.
conclusion: study demonstrated that, alleles containing two mutations 
dhfr arisen least four times independently containing triple 
mutant dhfr arose once, found carrying single unique asian-type
flanking sequence, apparently drives spread pyrimethamine resistance
associated dhfr alleles east africa. sp+as recommended use areas
where sp cure rates less 80% study reports observed
principle combination protection area pyrimethamine resistance
was already high.
