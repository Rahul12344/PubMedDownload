in addition role erythrocyte invasion, plasmodium falciparum actin is
implicated endocytosis, cytokinesis inheritance chloroplast-like
organelle called apicoplast. previously, inability visualise
filamentous actin (f-actin) dynamics restricted characterisation 
f-actin actin regulatory proteins, limitation recently overcame for
toxoplasma (periz et al, 2017). here, expressed validated
actin-binding chromobodies f-actin-sensors plasmodium falciparum and
characterised in-vivo actin dynamics. f-actin could chemically modulated, 
genetically disrupted upon conditionally deleting actin-1. comparative
approach, demonstrate formin-2, predicted nucleator f-actin, is
responsible apicoplast inheritance plasmodium toxoplasma, and
additionally mediates efficient cytokinesis plasmodium. finally, time-averaged
local intensity measurements f-actin toxoplasma conditional mutants
revealed molecular determinants spatiotemporally regulated f-actin flow.
together, data indicate formin-2 primary f-actin nucleator during
apicomplexan intracellular growth, mediating multiple essential functions.
