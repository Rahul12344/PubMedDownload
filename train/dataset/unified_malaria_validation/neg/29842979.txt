pfmdr1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) good correlate markers for
antimalarial drug resistance worldwide. present study comprehensive view 
screening pfmdr1 polymorphism antimalarials practiced geography and
time. study sites mizoram, tripura, meghalaya chosen multivariate drug
pressure due cross border migration transmission. mizoram gateway to
south east asia myanmar whereas tripura, meghalaya share porous border
with bangladesh. baseline finger pricked blood stained filter paper confirmed
uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum infected patients (year 2015) obtained
from national institute malaria research, new delhi, india. pfmdr1
polymorphism codon n86y, y184f, d1246y determined pcr-rflp, further
confirmed sequencing. observed marked predominance plasmodium
isolates pfmdr1 wild type alleles codons study i.e. 86, 184,
1246. spatially, plasmodium isolates mizoram diverse with
co-existence pfmdr1 genotype nyd, yyd, nfd haplotypes, followed by
tripura. isolates meghalaya nyd haplotype. reports, referring to
screening pfmdr1 snps cq/sp/as-sp across india, archived. temporal
study show distinct rise proportion pfmdr1 wild type n86 allele since
introduction artemether-lumefantrine first line antimalarial. hence
spatio-temporal screening plasmodium population pfmdr1 single nucleotide 
polymorphism accounts association antimalarial susceptibility and
validate pfmdr1 snps antimalarial drug resistant marker.
