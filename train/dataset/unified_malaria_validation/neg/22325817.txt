introduction: genetic make-up malaria parasite potent understanding
the parasite virulence, designing antimalarial vaccine evaluating impact 
of malaria control measures. paucity information genetic
structure plasmodium falciparum jharkhand, india malaria rampant
and study aimed establish molecular characterization p. falciparum
field isolates jharkhand measured two highly polymorphic genetic
markers, i.e. merozoite surface proteins (msps) 1 2.
methods: genetic diversity p. falciparum population low transmission 
area, ranchi, bokaro hazaribagh highly malarious area, latehar and
palamau districts jharkhand evaluated polymerase chain
reaction-sequencing analyzing msp-1 msp-2 genes explore genetic
structure parasite understudied region.
results: total 134 p. falciparum isolates analyzed polymorphic
regions msp-1 msp-2 classified according prevalence allelic
families. majority patients five sites mean monoclonal
infections 67·1 60·4% p. falciparum msp-1 msp-2, respectively, 
whereas, mean multiple genotypes 32·8 39·5% msp-1 msp-2,
respectively. interestingly, observed higher multiclonal infection low
transmission area compared highly malarious area case msp-1
genotypes, whereas msp-2 higher multiclonal infection observed highly
malarious area compared low transmission area. overall multiplicities of
infection msp-1 msp-2 1·38 1·39, respectively.
conclusion: first report molecular characterization p.
falciparum field isolates jharkhand. genetic diversity allelic
distribution found study somewhat similar reports india 
and southeast asian countries. however, p. falciparum infection highly
complex diverse disease-endemic regions jharkhand, suggesting
continual genetic mixing could significant implications use 
antimalarial drugs vaccines.
