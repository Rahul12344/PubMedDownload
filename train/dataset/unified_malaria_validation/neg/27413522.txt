the g-6-pd deficiency important polymorphism genotypic variants 
as 202a/376g, 376g/542t 376g/968t known west african populations. would
confer protection severe forms malaria although differences 
between various associations different studies. study genotyped
six (06) variants g-6-pd gene people symptomatic malaria urban 
areas burkina faso. one hundred eighty-two (182) patients tested
positive using rapid detection test microscopy included study. a
regular pcr genespark g6pd african kit run followed by
electrophoresis, allowing initially genotype six snps (g202a, a376g, a542t,
g680t, c563t t968c). women carrying mutations 202a and/or 376g were
further typed real-time pcr using taqman probes rs1050828 rs1050829. in
the study population g-6-pd deficiency prevalence 9.9%. addition of
g-6-pd a- (202a/376g) variant, 376g/542t 376g/968t variants also
detected. hemoglobin electrophoresis revealed 22.5% (41/182) the
individuals hbac compared with2.2% hbas one individual double
heterozygous hbsc. correlation g-6-pd deficiency or
haemoglobinopathies symptomatic malaria infections study. study
confirms g-6-pd deficiency confer protection plasmodium
falciparum infections. opposed previous genotyping studies carried in
burkina faso, study shows first time presence variant a- 
(376g/968c) warrants investigation national level in
specific ethnic groups.
