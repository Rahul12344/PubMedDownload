in study, characterized puf family gene member puf3 malaria
parasites plasmodium falciparum plasmodium yoelii secondary structure
prediction suggested rna-binding domains puf3 proteins consisted 
of 11 pumilio repeats similar human puf-a (also known
as pum3) saccharomyces cerevisiae puf6 proteins, involved in
ribosome biogenesis. neither p. falciparum (pf)puf3 p. yoelii (py)puf3 could 
be genetically disrupted, suggesting may essential the
intraerythrocytic developmental cycle. cellular fractionation pfpuf3 the
asexual stages revealed preferential partitioning nuclear fraction,
consistent nuclear localization pfpuf3::gfp pypuf3::gfp detected
by immunofluorescence. furthermore, pfpuf3 colocalized nucleolar marker 
pfnop1, demonstrating pfpuf3 nucleolar protein asexual stages.
we found, however, pypuf3 changed localization nucleolar to
being present cytosolic puncta mosquito liver stages, may
reflect alternative functions stages. affinity purification molecules
that associated ptp-tagged variant pfpuf3 revealed 31 proteins
associated 60s ribosome, enrichment 28s rrna internal
transcribed spacer 2 sequences. taken together, results suggest an
essential function pfpuf3 ribosomal biogenesis.
