background: multi-drug resistance severe/complicated cases emerging
phenotypes vivax malaria, may deteriorate current anti-malarial control 
measures. emergence phenotypes could associated either of
the two plasmodium vivax lineages. two lineages categorized old
world new world, based geographical sub-division genetic and
phenotypical markers. study revisited lineage hypothesis p. vivax 
typing distribution lineages among global isolates evaluated their
genetic relatedness using panel new mini-satellite markers.
methods: 18s ssu rrna s-type gene amplified 420 plasmodium vivax field
isolates collected different geographical regions india, thailand and
colombia well four strains p. vivax originating nicaragua,
panama, thailand (pak chang), vietnam (ong). mini-satellite marker panel
was developed understand population genetic parameters tested 
a sample subset lineages.
results: 18s ssu rrna s-type gene typing revealed distribution both
lineages (old world new world) geographical regions. however,
distribution plasmodium vivax lineages highly variable every
geographical region. lack geographical sub-division lineages
suggests lineages globally distributed. ten mini-satellites were
scanned p. vivax genome sequence; tandem repeats located in
eight chromosomes. mini-satellites revealed substantial allelic diversity 
(7-21, ae = 14.6 ± 2.0) heterozygosity (he = 0.697-0.924, ae = 0.857 ± 0.033)
per locus. mini-satellite comparison two lineages revealed high but
similar pattern genetic diversity, allele frequency, high degree allele
sharing. neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree derived genetic distance data
obtained ten mini-satellites also placed lineages together every
cluster.
conclusions: global lineage distribution, lack genetic distance, similar
pattern genetic diversity, allele sharing strongly suggested both
lineages single species thus new emerging phenotypes associated with
vivax malaria could clearly classified belonging particular
lineage basis geographical origin.
