even though antigenic variation employed among parasitic protozoa host
immune evasion, tetrahymena thermophila, free-living ciliate, also change
its surface protein antigens. cysteine-rich glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(gpi)-linked surface proteins encoded family polymorphic ser genes.
despite availability t. thermophila genome, comprehensive analysis of
the ser family limited high degree polymorphism. order to
overcome problem, new approach adopted searching ser candidates
with common motif sequences, namely length-specific repetitive cysteine pattern
and gpi anchor site. candidate genes phylogenetically compared 
previously identified ser genes classified subtypes. ser candidates were
often found located tandem arrays subtypes several
chromosomal scaffolds. certain ser candidates located chromosomal
arrays transcriptionally expressed specific t. thermophila developmental 
stages. ser candidates selected motif analysis approach form the
foundation systematic identification entire ser gene family, which
will contribute understanding function basis t.
thermophila antigenic variation.
