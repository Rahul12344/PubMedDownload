background: mosquito species belong culex. pipiens complex 
primary vectors west nile virus, sindbis, dirofilaria immitis, many
arboviruses. knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations voltage-gated sodium
channel (vgsc) gene cx. pipiens inherited, one important
threats efficacy pyrethroids insecticides. knockdown resistance (kdr) 
mutation, l1014f, well-defined mechanism resistance pyrethroids and
ddt many insect species. aim study determine mechanisms of
insecticide resistance species.
methods: specimens cx. pipiens, major vector west nile virus, were
obtained tehran, iran collecting larvae polluted wastewater qarchak
of tehran. 2016 insecticide susceptibility tests performed according to
who methods deltamethrin 0.05%. focused determination point
mutation vgsc gene cx. pipiens real-time pcr.
results: results revealed high levels resistance deltamethrin 0.05%.
the lethal times i.e. lt50 lt90 deltamethrin 2.1530 8.5117 h
respectively. result real-time pcr confirmed presence resistant
genotype members tested population. study first report 
on kdr genotyping cx. pipiens tehran results vgsc gene 
position l1014f confirmed tta ttt nucleotide change.
conclusion: finding provide clue management insecticide
resistance mosquito vectors arboviruses decision for
replacement novel approach vector control.
