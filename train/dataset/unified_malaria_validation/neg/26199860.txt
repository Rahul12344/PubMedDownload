histone deacetylase (hdac) enzymes work together histone acetyltransferases 
(hats) reversibly acetylate histone non-histone proteins. a
result, enzymes involved regulating chromatin structure gene
expression well important cellular processes. hdacs validated
drug targets types cancer, four hdac inhibitors clinically
approved. however, also showing promise novel drug targets 
indications, including malaria parasitic diseases. study the
in vitro activity four anti-cancer hdac inhibitors examined against
parasites cause malaria trypanosomiasis. three inhibitors,
suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (saha; vorinostat(®)), romidepsin (istodax(®))
and belinostat (beleodaq(®)), clinically approved treatment t-cell
lymphoma, fourth, panobinostat, recently approved for
combination therapy use certain patients multiple myeloma. hdac
inhibitors found inhibit growth asexual-stage plasmodium
falciparum malaria parasites nanomolar range (ic50 10-200 nm), 
romidepsin active sub-μm concentrations bloodstream form
trypanosoma brucei brucei parasites (ic50 35 nm). compounds found to
have selectivity malaria parasites compared mammalian cells, but
were selective trypanosome parasites versus mammalian cells. all
compounds caused hyperacetylation histone non-histone proteins in

p. falciparum nuclear extracts addition recombinant pfhdac1 activity.
p. falciparum histone hyperacetylation data indicate hdac inhibitors may
differentially affect acetylation profiles histone h3 h4.
