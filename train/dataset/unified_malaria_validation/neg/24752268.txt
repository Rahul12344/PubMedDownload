quinine shown frequent clinical failures, yet mechanisms
of action resistance fully elucidated. however, resistance is
linked polymorphisms multiple genes, including multidrug resistance 1
(pfmdr1), chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt), sodium/hydrogen
exchanger gene (pfnhe1). here, investigated association vitro
quinine susceptibility genetic polymorphisms pfmdr1codons 86 184,
pfcrt codon 76, pfnhe1 ms4760 88 field isolates western kenya. in
vitro activity assessed based drug concentration inhibited 50% of
parasite growth (the ic50), parasite genetic polymorphisms determined
from dna sequencing. data revealed significant associations between
polymorphism pfmdr1-86y, pfmdr1-184f, pfcrt-76t quinine susceptibility 
(p < 0.0001 three associations). eighty-two percent parasites
resistant quinine carried mutant alleles codons (pfmdr1-86y,
pfmdr1-184f, pfcrt-76t), whereas 74% parasites susceptible quinine
carried wild-type allele (pfmdr1-n86, pfmdr1-y184, pfcrt-k76,
respectively). addition, quinine ic50 values parasites pfnhe1 ms4760 
3 dnnnd repeats significantly higher 1 2 repeats (p =
0.033 p = 0.0043, respectively). clinical efficacy studies required
to confirm validity markers importance parasite genetic
