many eukaryotic developmental cell fate decisions effected
post-transcriptionally involve rna binding proteins regulators translation 
of key mrnas. malaria parasites (plasmodium spp.), development round,
non-motile replicating exo-erythrocytic liver stage forms slender,
motile cell-cycle arrested sporozoites believed depend environmental
changes experienced transmission parasite mosquito
vector vertebrate host. identify plasmodium member rna
binding protein family puf key regulator transformation. the
absence pumilio-2 (puf2) sporozoites initiate eef development inside mosquito 
salivary glands independently normal transmission-associated environmental
cues. puf2- sporozoites exhibit genome-wide transcriptional changes result
in loss gliding motility, cell traversal ability reduction infectivity,
and, moreover, trigger metamorphosis typical early plasmodium intra-hepatic
development. data demonstrate puf2 key player regulating
sporozoite developmental control, imply transformation salivary
gland-resident sporozoites liver stage-like parasites regulated a
post-transcriptional mechanism.
