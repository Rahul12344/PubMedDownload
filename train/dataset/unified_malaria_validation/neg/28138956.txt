since ancient times mediterranean island sardinia known for
harboring population average body height shorter almost every
other ethnic group europe. century investigations, the
cause(s) origin uniqueness yet clear. shorter stature 
of sardinians appears documented since prehistoric times, as
revealed analysis skeletal remains discovered archaeological sites
on island. recently, number genetic, hormonal, environmental, infective 
and nutritional factors put forward explain unique
anthropometric feature, persisted long time, even environmental 
and living conditions improved around 1960. although putative factors
are supported sound empirical evidence, weaker support available for
others. recent advent whole genome analysis techniques shed new light on
specific variants origin short stature. however, marked
geographical variability stature across time space within island, 
the well-known presence pockets short height population the
southern districts, still puzzling findings attracted interest 
of anthropologists geneticists. purpose review focus the
state-of-the-art research stature, well factors made sardinians
the shortest among europeans.
