background: homopolymeric tracts, particularly poly da.dt, enriched within
the intergenic sequences eukaryotic genomes appear act as
intrinsic regulators nucleosome positioning. previous study the
incomplete genome human malarial parasite plasmodium falciparum reports 
higher expected enrichment poly da.dt tracts, far anticipated 
even highly rich genome. report analysis relative
frequency, length spatial arrangement homopolymer tracts complete 
p. falciparum genome, extending analysis twelve additional genomes of
apicomplexan parasites important human animal health. addition, using
nucleosome-positioning data available p. falciparum, explore the
correlation poly da.dt tracts nucleosome-positioning data key
expression landmarks within intergenic regions.
results: describe three apparent lineage-specific patterns homopolymeric
tract organization within intergenic regions apicomplexan parasites.
moreover, striking pattern enrichment overly long poly da.dt tracts in
the intergenic regions plasmodium spp. uniquely extends protein coding
sequences. conserved spatial arrangement poly da.dt immediately
flanking open reading frames predicted core promoter sites. key
landmarks relatively depleted nucleosomes p. falciparum, would
be expected poly da.dt acting nucleosome exclusion sequences.
conclusions: previous comparative studies homopolymer tract organization
emphasize evolutionary diversity; first report analysis
within single phylum. data provide insights evolution of
homopolymeric tracts selective pressures play maintenance and
expansion.
