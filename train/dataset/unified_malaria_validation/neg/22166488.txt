background: malaria still public health problem malaysia especially in
the interior parts peninsular malaysia states sabah sarawak
(east malaysia). first study genetic diversity genotype
multiplicity plasmodium falciparum malaysia.
methods: seventy-five p. falciparum isolates genotyped using nested-pcr
of msp-1 (block 2) msp-2 (block 3).
results: msp-1 msp-2 allelic families identified 65 blood samples.
ro33 predominant msp-1 allelic family identified 80.0% (52/65) 
samples k1 family least frequency. msp-2 allelic families,
3d7 showed higher frequency (76.0%) compared fc27 (20.0%). multiplicity of
p. falciparum infection (moi) 1.37 1.20 msp-1 msp-2,
respectively. total seven alleles detected; three msp-1
allelic families (ro33, mad20 k1) monomorphic terms size while
msp-2 alleles polymorphic (two 3d7 two fc27). heterozygosity (he) was
0.57 0.55 msp-1 msp-2, respectively.
conclusions: study showed moi p. falciparum low, reflected the
low intensity malaria transmission pahang, malaysia; ro33 3d7 
most predominant circulating allelic families. findings showed p.
falciparum low allelic diversity high frequency alleles. a
result, antimalarial drug efficacy trials based msp genotyping be
carefully interpreted.
