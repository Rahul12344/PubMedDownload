background: large polymorphic protein pfemp1 encoded var gene
family. pfemp1 shown play important role cytoadherence ligand
on surface infected erythrocytes thereby contributes distinct
pathogenesis malaria. study explored diversity dbl1α and
dbl2β-c2 domains protein indonesian plasmodium falciparum field
isolates.
methods: samples patients severe uncomplicated malaria two
different malaria-endemic areas indonesia collected dna directly
extracted. dried blood filter paper prepared rna extraction. pcr
amplicons either cloned subsequently sequenced directly sequenced for
analysis nucleotide amino acid level. recently published well as
self-designed primers used amplification.
results: blood eight patients finally used analysis. seventy-one
different sequences 500 dbl1α sequenced clones observed,
resulting average 8.9 different dbl1α sequences per isolate. average
dbl1α sequence similarity within isolates similar isolates.
phylogenetic analysis demonstrated clustering sequences regarding strain or
geographical origin. dbl1α sequences analysed distribution of
semi-conserved features (cysteine/polv1-4 grouping) classified six
sequence groups. dbl1α cys2 type observed expressed sequences in
vivo. expression certain dbl sequences implied potential involvement the
pathogenesis. expected, dbl2β-c2 domains showed high moderate homology 
among other.
conclusion: dbl1α domains pfemp1 clinical indonesian isolates showed 
high divergence among isolates similarities asia-pacific
strains. investigations important var gene domains larger
sample size required confirm statistical significance observed
associations severe malaria indonesian samples.
