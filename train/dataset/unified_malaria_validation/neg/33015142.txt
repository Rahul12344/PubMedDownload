it well established intracellular pathogens mobilise signalling pathways 
to manipulate gene expression host cell promote survival.
surprisingly, evidence specific host signalling molecules are
likewise activated a-nucleated erythrocytes response infection with
malaria parasites. paper (adderley et al., nature communications 2020),
we report system-wide assessment host erythrocyte signalling the
course infection plasmodium falciparum. achieved use
of antibody microarrays containing >800 antibodies directed human
signalling proteins, enabled us interrogate status host
erythrocyte signalling pathways ring, trophozoite schizont stages of
parasite development. confirmed pre-existing fragmentary data
on activation host erythrocyte pak-mek pathway, also identified
dynamic changes many additional signalling elements, trophozoite-infected
erythrocytes displaying largest mobilisation host cell signalling. this
study generated comprehensive dataset modulation host erythrocyte
signalling infection p. falciparum, provides proof of
principle human protein kinases activated plasmodium infection represent 
attractive targets antimalarial intervention.
