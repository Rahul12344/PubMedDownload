a completely effective vaccine malaria (one major infectious diseases 
worldwide) yet available; different membrane proteins involved in
parasite-host interactions proposed candidates designing it. 
has found proteins encoded merozoite surface protein (msp)-7
multigene family antibody targets natural infection; nucleotide
diversity three pvmsp-7 genes thus analyzed colombian parasite
population. contrast p. falciparum msp-7 loci ancestral p. vivax
msp-7 genes, specie-specific duplicates latter specie display high genetic
variability, generated single nucleotide polymorphisms, repeat regions, and
recombination. least three major allele types present pvmsp-7c,
pvmsp-7h pvmsp-7i positive selection seems operating central
region msp-7 genes. although region high genetic polymorphism, 
the c-terminus (pfam domain id: pf12948) conserved could important
candidate designing subunit-based antimalarial vaccine.
