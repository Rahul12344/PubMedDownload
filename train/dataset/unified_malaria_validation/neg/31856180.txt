malaria parasites follow complex life cycle consists multiple stages
that span human host mosquito vector. among species causing
malaria, plasmodium falciparum lethal, clinical symptoms
manifesting intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (idc). the
idc, p. falciparum progresses synchronous continuous cascade of
transcriptional programming previously established using population analyses.
while individual parasites known exhibit transcriptional variations to
evade host immune system commit sexual fate, rare expression
heterogeneity largely undetectable population level. therefore, we
combined single-cell rna-sequencing (scrna-seq) microfluidic platform and
fluorescence imaging delineate transcriptional variations among individual
parasites late asexual sexual stages. comparison asexual
and sexual parasites uncovered set previously undefined sex-specific genes. 
asexual parasites segregated three distinct clusters based the
differential expression genes encoding seras, rhoptry proteins, exp2 plus 
transporters. multiple pseudotime analyses revealed stage-specific
transitions distinct. rna fluorescent situ hybridization of
cluster-specific genes validated distinct stage-specific expression and
transitions idc defined highly variable transcriptional
pattern exp2. additionally, analyses indicated huge variations the
stage-specific transcript levels among parasites. overall, scrna-seq rna-fish
of p. falciparum revealed distinct stage transitions unexpected degrees of
heterogeneity potential impact transcriptional regulation idc 
and adaptive responses host.
