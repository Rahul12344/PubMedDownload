culex quinquefasciatus plays important role transmission vector-borne
diseases public health importance, including lymphatic filariasis (lf), as
well many arboviral diseases. currently, efforts tackle c. quinquefasciatus
vectored diseases based either mass drug administration (mda) lf, or
insecticide-based interventions. widespread intensive insecticide usage has
resulted increased resistance mosquito vectors, including c.
quinquefasciatus. herein, transcriptome profile ugandan
bendiocarb-resistant c. quinquefasciatus explored identify candidate genes
associated insecticide resistance. high levels insecticide resistance
were observed five six insecticides tested, lowest mortality 
(0.97%) reported permethrin, ddt, lambdacyhalothrin, bendiocarb 
deltamethrin mortality rate ranged 1.63-3.29%. resistance bendiocarb 
in exposed mosquitoes marked, 2.04% mortality following 1 h exposure and
58.02% 4 h. genotyping g119s ace-1 target site mutation detected a
highly significant association (p < 0.0001; or = 25) resistance and
ace1-119s. however, synergist assays using p450 inhibitor pbo, the
esterase inhibitor tpp resulted markedly increased mortality (to ≈80%),
suggesting role metabolic resistance resistance phenotype. using a
novel, custom 60 k whole-transcriptome microarray 16 genes significantly
overexpressed resistant mosquitoes detected, p450 cyp6z18
showing highest differential gene expression (>8-fold increase vs unexposed
controls). results provide evidence bendiocarb resistance ugandan
c. quinquefasciatus mediated target-site mechanisms and
over-expression detoxification enzymes.
