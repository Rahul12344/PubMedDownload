the plasmodium falciparum genome rich regions low amino acid complexity 
which evolve constraints size. explore extent diversity 
these loci, sequenced repeat regions pfmdr1, pfmdr5, pfmdr6, pfmrp2, and
the antigenic locus pfmsp8 laboratory cultured-adapted clinical isolates. 
we assessed associations repeats parasite vitro
responses 7 antimalarials determine possible adaptive roles these
repeats drug tolerance. results show extensive repeat variations the
reference clinical isolates loci. also observed modest increase
in dihydroartemisinin activity parasites harboring pfmdr1 sequence profile
7-2-10 (reflecting number asparagine repeats, number aspartate repeats,
and number asparagine repeats final series gene product) (p =
0.0321) reduced sensitivity chloroquine, mefloquine, quinine, and
dihydroartemisinin 7-2-11 profile (p = 0.0051, 0.0068, 0.0011, 
and 0.0052, respectively). interestingly, noted inverse association between
two drugs whereby isolates 6 asparagine repeats encoded pfmdr6 were
significantly susceptible piperaquine 8 (p = 0.0057).
against lumefantrine, 8 repeats were, however, sensitive (p =
0.0144). pfmrp2, 7-dnnnts/nnnnts (number dnnnts nnnnts motifs;
underlining indicates dimorphism) repeat group significantly associated 
a higher lumefantrine 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) (p = 0.008) in
those without. associations observed pfmsp8. results hint at
the probable utility repeat conformations markers vitro
antimalarial response; hence, biochemical functional studies ascertain their
role p. falciparum required.
