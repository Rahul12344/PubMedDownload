plasmodium berghei malaria.

intraerythrocytic parasites degrade haemoglobin make available nutrients for
their growth maturation. plasmepsins, aspartic proteases plasmodium
play significant role haemoglobin degradation proposed attractive
drug targets. present study gene encodes plasmepsin rodent
malaria parasite, plasmodium berghei, cloned expressed. gene was
sequenced expressed escherichia coli bl21de3 recombinant plasmepsin 
of molecular weight 43 kda obtained. sequence obtained analysed and
compared plasmepsins plasmodium spp. mice immunized the
recombinant plasmepsin induced strong humoral immune response. elisa ifa
performed serum immunized mice showed high antibody titres. along 
this, vivo study exhibited partial protection p. berghei infection
suggesting role plasmepsin malaria control.
