background: detection plasmodium spp. sometimes inconvenient especially 
rural areas distant laboratory. study portable
diagnostic test plasmodium spp. developed using insulated isothermal
polymerase chain reaction (iipcr) alternative approach improve this
situation.
methods: pair universal primers probe designed amplify and
detect gene encoding 18s small sub-unit rrna plasmodium spp using iipcr method
in portable device, pockit™. efficiency detection limit assay
were evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr)
approach subjected testing pockit™. detection results of
pockit™ displayed '+', '-' '?' based fluorescence ratio
after/before reaction. total 55 35 samples malaria patients and
healthy subjects, respectively, screened evaluate feasibility this
newly designed iipcr assay.
results: iipcr assay allowed detection various species plasmodium, 
including infecting humans (plasmodium falciparum, p. vivax, p. knowlesi,
p. malariae, p. ovale), monkeys, birds, rodents. efficiency assay
achieved 96.9 % lower detection limit ≥100 copies plasmodial
dna. specificity assay assured could detect human, bacterial
and parasitic dna. among 55 clinical samples tested, 47 (85.4 %) of
them detected positive pockit™. four (7.3 %) samples fluorescence
ratio after/before reaction <1.2 reported negative another four 
(7.3 %) ambiguously detected fluorescence ratios 1.2 and
1.3. fluorescence ratio found associated copy number
of plasmodial dna. approach considered qualitative method.
conclusions: portable iipcr system may serve alternative approach for
preliminary screening malaria endemic rural areas. system may also be
useful detecting animal malaria field. although as
quantitative qpcr method, comparatively fast easy handle. is
believed pockit-iipcr assay able achieve 100 % sensitivity if
increased amount dna sample used. iipcr assay also be
upgraded future detect multiple plasmodium spp. time by
designing specific primers probes.
