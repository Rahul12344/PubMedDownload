over 50 avian plasmodium species described. however, pcr-based
information shows much broader diversity genetic lineages parasites. 
this discrepancy indicates insufficient knowledge taxonomic diversity and
boundaries single species avian plasmodium species. recent taxonomy,
most genetically closely related lineages share morphology and
development patterns attributed biological species, 
no information lineages able cross. information crucial
to understand lineages form single multiple evolutionary units. due
to presence sexual process sporogonic development plasmodium parasites 
in mosquitoes, self cross-fertilization occur identified during
the oocyst stage. initiated vivo hybridization experiments two
widespread plasmodium relictum lineages (psgs1 pgrw11) experimentally
infected culex pipiens pipiens form molestus mosquitoes. study putative hybrid
oocysts, used laser microdissection technique together pcr-based
analyses mitochondrial nuclear genes. demonstrate psgs1 and
pgrw11 lineages develop infected mosquitoes parallel, also form hybrid 
oocysts two lineages. results accord recent global
phylogeographic study p. relictum suggested cross-fertilization
between psgs1 pgrw11 might occur. information helps understand
population structure, gene flow evolutionary process haemosporidian
parasites.
