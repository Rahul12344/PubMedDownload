objectives: malaria, caused plasmodium infection, remains major global
health problem. monocytes integral immune response, yet their
transcriptional functional responses primary plasmodium falciparum
infection clinical malaria poorly understood.
methods: transcriptional functional profiles monocytes examined
in controlled human malaria infection p. falciparum blood stages in
children adults acute malaria. monocyte gene expression functional
phenotypes examined rna sequencing flow cytometry peak infection
and compared pre-infection convalescence acute malaria.
results: subpatent primary infection, monocyte transcriptional profile was
dominated interferon (ifn) molecular signature. pathways enriched included 
type ifn signalling, innate immune response cytokine-mediated signalling.
monocytes increased tnf il-12 production upon vitro toll-like receptor
stimulation increased il-10 production upon vitro parasite restimulation. 
longitudinal phenotypic analyses revealed sustained significant changes the
composition monocytes following infection, increased cd14+cd16- and
decreased cd14-cd16+ subsets. acute malaria, monocyte cd64/fcγri expression
was significantly increased children adults, hla-dr remained stable.
although children adults showed similar pattern differentially expressed
genes, number magnitude gene expression change greater in
children.
conclusions: monocyte activation subpatent malaria driven ifn
molecular signature robust activation genes enriched pathogen
detection, phagocytosis, antimicrobial activity antigen presentation. the
greater magnitude transcriptional changes children acute malaria
suggests monocyte phenotypes may change age exposure.
