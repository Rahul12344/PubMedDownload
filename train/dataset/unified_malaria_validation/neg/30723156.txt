the plasmodium falciparum atpase pfatp4 target diverse range of
antimalarial compounds, including clinical drug candidate cipargamin. pfatp4 
was originally annotated ca2+ transporter, recent evidence suggests that
it na+ efflux pump, extruding na+ exchange h+ demonstrate
that atp4 proteins belong clade p-type atpases restricted to
apicomplexans closest relatives. employed variety genetic and
physiological approaches investigate atp4 protein apicomplexan
toxoplasma gondii, tgatp4. show tgatp4 plasma membrane protein.
knockdown tgatp4 effect resting ph ca2+ rendered parasites
unable regulate cytosolic na+ concentration ([na+]cyt). pfatp4
inhibitors caused increase [na+]cyt cytosolic alkalinization wt
but tgatp4 knockdown parasites. parasites tgatp4 knocked or
disrupted exhibited growth defect, attributable reduced viability of
extracellular parasites. parasites tgatp4 disrupted showed
reduced virulence mice. results provide evidence atp4 proteins
playing key conserved role na+ regulation apicomplexan parasites.
