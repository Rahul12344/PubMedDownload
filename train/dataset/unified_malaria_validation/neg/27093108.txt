the frequency candida infections currently rising, thus adversely
impacting global health. situation exacerbated azole resistance
developed fungal pathogens. candida tropicalis opportunistic pathogen
that causes candidiasis, example, immune-compromised individuals, cancer
patients, undergo organ transplantation. member the
non-albicans group candida known azole-resistant, is
frequently seen individuals treated cancers, hiv-infection, and
those underwent bone marrow transplantation. although genome c.
tropicalis sequenced 2009, genome annotation supported by
experimental validation. present study, carried proteomics
profiling c. tropicalis using high-resolution fourier transform mass
spectrometry. identified 2743 proteins, thus mapping nearly 44% the
computationally predicted protein-coding genes peptide level evidence. in
addition identifying 2591 proteins cell lysate yeast, also
analyzed proteome conditioned media c. tropicalis culture and
identified several unique secreted proteins among total 780 proteins. by
subjecting mass spectrometry data derived cell lysate conditioned
media proteogenomic analysis, identified 86 novel genes, 12 novel exons,
and corrected 49 computationally-predicted gene models. knowledge, is
the first high-throughput proteomics study c. tropicalis validating predicted 
protein coding genes refining current genome annotation. findings may
prove useful future global health efforts fight candida infections.
