background: baculovirus vector (bv) able transduce foreign genes into
mammalian cells efficiently safely incorporating mammalian promoter. 
the present study, tailored surface proteins expressed malaria
sporozoites enhance hepatocyte transduction. sporozoites infect hepatocytes
within minutes initial entry blood circulation. infectivity and
hepatocyte-specific selectivity mediated interplay hepatocytes
and sporozoite surface proteins. circumsporozoite protein (csp) the
thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (trap) bind heparan sulfate
proteoglycan hepatocyte surface contribute sporozoite infection and
hepatocyte selectivity.
methods: bvs displaying ectodomain consisting three different csp variants 
(full-length, n-terminal c-terminal) trap virus envelope were
constructed, resulting vitro hepatocyte transduction efficiency was
evaluated.
results: demonstrated improved hepatocyte transduction efficiency bvs
expressing csp trap ectodomains compared bvs without malaria surface
proteins. addition, gene transduction efficiencies bvs displaying csp or
trap higher expressing pres1 antigen hepatitis b virus.
conclusions: bvs expressing csp trap ectodomain could represent a
promising hepatocyte-specific gene delivery methodology. copyright © 2016 john
