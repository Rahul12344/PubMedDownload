malaria parasites transmitted humans mosquitoes genus anopheles,
and insects targets innovative vector control programs. proposed
approaches include use genetic strategies based transgenic mosquitoes
to suppress modify vector populations. although substantial advances been
made engineering resistant mosquito strains, limited efforts made in
refining mosquito transgene expression, particular attenuating effects 
insertions sites, result variations phenotypes impacts on
fitness due random integration transposon constructs. promising
strategy mitigate position effects identification insulator or
boundary dna elements could used isolate transgenes effects
of genomic environment. applied quantitative approaches show that
exogenous insulator-like dna derived drosophila melanogaster gypsy
retrotransposon increase stabilize transgene expression in
transposon-mediated random insertions recombinase-catalyzed, site-specific
integrations malaria vector mosquito, anopheles stephensi. sequences
can contribute precise expression transgenes mosquitoes engineered for
both basic applied goals.
