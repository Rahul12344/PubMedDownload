a century conceptual technological advances infectious disease research
has changed face medicine. however, remains lack effective
interventions poor understanding host immunity significant
and complex pathogens, including malaria. development successful
interventions intractable diseases requires comprehensive
understanding host-pathogen immune responses. major advance past
decade paradigm switch thinking contemporary reductionist 
(gene-by-gene protein-by-protein) view holistic (whole organism)
view. also, recognition host-pathogen immunity composed complex,
dynamic interactions cellular molecular components networks that
cannot represented individual component isolation. systems
immunology integrates field immunology omics technologies and
computational sciences comprehensively interrogate immune response a
systems level. herein, describe system immunology toolkit report
recent studies deploying systems-level approaches context natural
exposure malaria controlled human malaria infection. contribute our
perspective potential systems immunity rational design and
development effective interventions improve global public health.
