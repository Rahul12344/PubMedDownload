malaria continues one mankind's devastating diseases despite the
many varied efforts combat it. indispensable malaria elimination and
eventual eradication development effective vaccines. controlled human
malaria infection (chmi) invaluable tool vaccine efficacy assessment
and investigation early immunological molecular responses against
plasmodium falciparum infection. here, investigated gene expression changes
following chmi using rna-seq. peripheral blood samples collected in
bagamoyo, tanzania, ten adults injected intradermally (id) with
2.5x104 aseptic, purified, cryopreserved p. falciparum sporozoites (sanariaÂ®
pfspz challenge). total 2,758 genes identified differentially
expressed following chmi. transcriptional changes pronounced day 5
after inoculation, clinically silent liver phase. secondary
analysis, grouping volunteers according prepatent period duration,
identified 265 genes whose expression levels linked time blood stage
parasitemia detection. gene modules associated 265 genes linked
to regulation transcription, cell cycle, phosphatidylinositol signaling and
erythrocyte development. study showed malaria pre-exposed volunteers,
parasite prepatent period individual linked magnitude timing of
early gene expression changes id chmi.
