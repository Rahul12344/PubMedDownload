objective: despite malaria epidemiology extensively studied primates,
few studies conducted ungulates. half century without
descriptions plasmodium spp. deer since first identification, recent
research rediscovered plasmodium ungulates africa, asia, north america 
and south america, including central brazil. here, captive herd evaluated
in southern brazil using light microscopy pcr. dna samples tested for
fragment amplification two plasmodium spp. genes: mitochondrial cytochrome b
and small subunit ribosomal rna.
results: analyses negative. however, tests performed samples
that collected single time point, parasitemia may fluctuate over
the parasite's life cycle. thus, possibility occult infection cannot be
ruled out. despite negative results methods applied, cannot 
be categorically stated animals free plasmodium sp.
infection. monitoring and/or multiple sequential sampling may improve the
success rate detecting parasites. moreover, although survey plasmodium
represents first molecular study ungulate malaria parasites southern 
brazil, analysis samples different ungulate species important 
for characterizing epidemiology plasmodium mammals this
region.
