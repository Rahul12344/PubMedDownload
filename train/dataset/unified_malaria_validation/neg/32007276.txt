the antimalarial drug artemisinin reported possess direct anti-tumor 
effects various types tumor cells. however, anti-tumor potential has
not fully revealed, effects tumor susceptibility immune
surveillance host still unknown. natural killer (nk) cells the
first line tumor surveillance host, recognized a
promising target tumor immunotherapy. here, reported artemisinin
sensitized tumor cells nk cell cytolysis. human k562 raji tumor
cells, mouse yac-1 tumor cells susceptible human mouse nk
cell cytolysis in vitro artemisinin pretreatment. conjugation formation
between tumor cells nk cells increased pretreatment with
artemisinin. effects tumor cells artemisinin might results 
of tumor recognition nk cells, since major ligands nk cell surface
receptors affected. mechanistically, although artemisinin induce 
tumor cell apoptosis, artemisinin enriched apoptosis-related gene sets these
tumor cells, might predispose tumor cells apoptosis upon nk cell
cytolysis. moreover, nk cell numbers, percentages, maturation functions 
preserved presence artemisinin in vitro, suggesting artemisinin
displays detrimental effects tumor cells immune cells. these
data reveal novel anti-tumor mechanism artemisinin demonstrate that
artemisinin could promising drug candidate cancer treatment.
