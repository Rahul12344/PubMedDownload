the origin novel protein-coding genes de novo considered so
improbable impossible. less decade, especially last
five years, view overturned extensive evidence diverse
eukaryotic lineages. evidence mechanism contributed 
significant number genes genomes organisms diverse saccharomyces, 
drosophila, plasmodium, arabidopisis human. simple beginnings, these
genes instances acquired complex structure, regulated expression and
important functional roles. new genes often thought dispensable late
additions; however, recent de novo genes human play role in
disease. rather extremely rare occurrence, evident there
is relatively constant trickle proto-genes released testing ground 
of natural selection. currently unknown whether de novo genes arise
primarily 'rna-first' 'orf-first' pathway. either way, evolutionary
tinkering pool genetic potential may significant player 
in origins lineage-specific traits adaptations.
