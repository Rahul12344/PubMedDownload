plasmodiophora brassicae causes clubroot disease cruciferous plants, an
emerging threat canadian canola (brassica napus) production. review
focuses recent studies pathogenic diversity p. brassicae
populations, mechanisms pathogenesis resistance, development of
diagnostic tests pathogen detection quantification.taxonomy:
plasmodiophora brassicae soil-borne, obligate parasite within class
phytomyxea (plasmodiophorids) protist supergroup rhizaria.
disease symptoms: clubroot development characterized formation of
club-shaped galls roots affected plants. above-ground symptoms include 
wilting, stunting, yellowing premature senescence. disease cycle:
plasmodiophora brassicae first infects root hairs, producing motile zoospores
that invade cortical tissue. secondary plasmodia form within root cortex 
and, triggering expression genes involved production auxins, 
cytokinins plant growth regulators, divert substantial proportion 
plant resources hypertrophic growth root tissues, resulting the
formation galls. secondary plasmodia cleaved millions resting 
spores root galls quickly disintegrate, releasing long-lived resting
spores soil. serine protease, pro1, shown trigger resting 
spore germination. physiological specialization: physiological specialization
occurs populations p. brassicae, various host differential sets,
consisting different collections brassica genotypes, used to
distinguish among pathotypes parasite. detection quantification: p.
brassicae cannot cultured, bioassays bait plants traditionally used 
to detect pathogen soil. recent innovations detection and
quantification p. brassicae include use antibodies, quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) qpcr conjunction signature fatty
acid analysis, sensitive bioassays. resistance in
canola: clubroot-resistant canola hybrids, recently introduced canadian 
market, represent important new tool clubroot management crop.
genetic resistance must carefully managed, however, quickly
overcome regions. least three resistance genes one two
quantitative trait loci involved conferring resistance p. brassicae.
root hair infection still occurs resistant cultivars, secondary plasmodia 
often remain immature unable produce resting spores. fewer cell wall
breakages occur resistant hosts, spread plasmodium cortical
tissue restricted. information genetics clubroot resistance 
canola needed ensure effective resistance stewardship.
