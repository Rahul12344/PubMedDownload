the idea introducing genetic modifications wild populations insects to
stop spreading diseases 40 years old. synthetic disease
refractory genes successfully generated mosquito vectors dengue 
fever human malaria. equally important development population
transformation systems drive maintain disease refractory genes high
frequency populations. demonstrate underdominant population
transformation system drosophila melanogaster property being
both spatially self-limiting reversible original genetic state. both
population transformation reversal largely achieved within 
as 5 generations. described genetic construct {ud} composed two genes; 
(1) uas-rpl14.dsrna targeting rnai haploinsufficient gene rpl14 (2) an
rnai insensitive rpl14 rescue. proof-of-principle system the
uas-rpl14.dsrna knock-down gene placed control actin5c-gal4
driver located different chromosome {ud} insert. configuration
would effective wild populations without incorporating actin5c-gal4
driver part {ud} construct (or replacing uas promoter an
appropriate direct promoter). however anticipated approach that
underlies underdominant system could potentially applied number of
species.
