background & objectives: attractin, large multi-domain protein has
regulatory functions multiple physiological processes thus strong
therapeutic potential. invertebrates, first identified water-borne
protein pheromone plays important role chemical communication and
coordinates reproductive activities. role mosquitoes/insects remains
unknown. unexpected discovery attractin homolog olfactory tissue 
of anopheles culicifacies mosquito prompted us investigate possible role
of ac-attractin (ac-atrn) diverse behavioural responses, e.g. feeding, mating 
and non-genetic stresses.
methods: homology search analysis performed identify full length
attractin (ac-atrn) gene anopheles culicifacies mosquito. unravel its
molecular function external internal stresses, extensive real-time pcr
was performed neuro-olfactory tissues adult mosquitoes well as
in larval stages. further, behavioural assay conducted elucidate its
role mosquitoes mating behaviour.
results: results indicated ac-atrn 3942 bp long transcript which
encodes 1313 amino acid protein, multiple domains including cub, egf,
keltch, etc, 80-90% homology insect/mosquito homologs. ac-atrn gene
was dominantly expressed young larvae expression elevated in
response fresh food supply starved larvae. cold stress temporarily 
arrested expression ac-atrn gene. case adult mosquitoes, olfactory
and brain tissue showed relatively higher expression ac-atrn reproductive
organs. although, starvation yield significant changes olfactory
tissues, aging nutritional stress modulated ac-atrn expression the
brain tissue. furthermore, circadian rhythm dependent change expression 
of ac-atrn virgin mated mosquitoes (both sexes), indicates ac-atrn
might also pheromone guided role swarm formation mating
behaviour.
interpretation & conclusion: relative expression profiling ac-atrn gene in
the larvae nutritional cold stress suggested possible role in
mediating chemical communication towards food source thermal
regulation young larvae. similarly, might crucial regulatory role in
the stress management survival adult mosquitoes. results revealed that
ac-atrn gene global regulator many physiological processes mosquitoes 
including stress response mating behaviour thus might potential
target design novel intervention strategy mosquitoes.
