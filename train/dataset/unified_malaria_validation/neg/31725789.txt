the relationship deforestation malaria amazonian brazil is
complex, deeper understanding relationship required inform
effective control measures region. here, particularly interested
in characterizing impact land use land cover change genetics of
the major regional vector malaria, nyssorhynchus darlingi (root). used
nextera-tagmented, reductively amplified dna (nextrad) genotyping-by-sequencing
to genotype 164 ny. darlingi collected 16 collection sites divergent
forest cover levels seven municipalities four municipality groups span
the state amazonas northwestern amazonian brazil: são gabriel da cachoeira,
presidente figueiredo, four municipalities area around cruzeiro sul,
and lábrea. using dataset 5,561 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), we
investigated genetic structure ny. darlingi populations a
combination model- non-model-based analyses. identified weak to
moderate genetic differentiation among four municipality groups. no
evidence microgeographic genetic structure ny. darlingi among forest cover
levels within municipality groups, indicating may gene flow
across areas municipalities different degrees deforestation.
additionally, conducted environmental association analysis using two
outlier detection methods determine whether individual snps associated
with forest cover level without affecting overall population genetic structure.
we identified 14 outlier snps, investigated functions associated their
proximal genes, could characterized future studies.
