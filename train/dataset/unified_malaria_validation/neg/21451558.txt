hemoglobin c (hbc) recently associated protection against
plasmodium falciparum malaria. thought hbc influences development 
of immune responses malaria, suggesting variation hbc
locus (rs33930165) may interact polymorphic sites immune genes. we
investigated, 198 individuals belonging 34 families living burkina faso,
statistical interactions hbc 11 polymorphisms within interleukin-4
(il4), il12b, ncr3, tumor necrosis factor (tnf) lymphotoxin-Î± (lta), which
have previously associated malaria-related phenotypes. searched 
multilocus interactions using pedigree-based generalized multifactor
dimensionality reduction approach. detected 29 multilocus interactions for
mild malaria, maximum parasitemia asymptomatic parasitemia correcting
for multiple tests. single-nucleotide polymorphisms studied included 
in several multilocus models. nevertheless, significant multilocus
models included il12b 3' untranslated region, il12bpro lta+80, suggesting that
those polymorphisms play particular role interactions detected.
moreover, identified six multilocus models involving ncr3 encodes the
activating natural killer (nk) receptor nkp30, suggesting interaction 
hbc genes involved activation nk cells. generally, our
findings suggest interaction hbc genes influencing activation 
of effector cells phenotypes related mild malaria.
