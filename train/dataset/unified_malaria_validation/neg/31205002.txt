tackling relapsing plasmodium vivax zoonotic plasmodium knowlesi infections
is critical reducing malaria incidence mortality worldwide. understanding 
the biology important related parasites previously constrained
by lack robust molecular genetic approaches. here, establish
crispr-cas9 genome editing culture-adapted p. knowlesi strain define
parameters optimal homology-driven repair. establish scalable protocol
for production repair templates pcr demonstrate flexibility 
the system tagging proteins distinct cellular localisations. using
iterative rounds genome-editing generate transgenic line expressing p.
vivax duffy binding protein (pvdbp), lead vaccine candidate. demonstrate
that pvdbp plays role reticulocyte restriction alter the
macaque/human host cell tropism p. knowlesi. critically, antibodies raised
against p. vivax antigen potently inhibit proliferation strain,
providing invaluable tool support vaccine development.
