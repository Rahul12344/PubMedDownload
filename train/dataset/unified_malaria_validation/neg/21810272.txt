background: anopheles lesteri primary vector plasmodium spp. central
china. complete understanding vector population structure processes 
responsible differentiation important vector-based malaria
control programmes identifying heterogeneity disease transmission a
result discrete vector populations. adequate an. lesteri
population genetic data available.
methods: polymorphism sequence variations mitochondrial coii cytb genes
were assessed explore level genetic variability differentiation
among six populations an. lesteri china.
results: 30 (4.37%) 21 (5.33%) polymorphic sites mtdna-coii
and cytb gene, respectively. totally 31 coii 30 cytb haplotypes were
obtained. range fst values 0.101 0.655 mtdna-coii, and
0.029 0.231 cytb gene. analysis molecular variance (amova) showed
that percentage variation within populations (65.83%, 88.48%) greater 
than among populations (34.17%, 11.52%) using genes. tajima's and
fu's fs values negative, except tajima's values yn hnb
populations, suggest large number low-frequency mutations in
populations populations expansion proceeding.
conclusions: levels genetic variation within an. lesteri populations were
higher among them. results may suggest considerable levels of
gene flow, explanations, effect historical population
perturbations also hypothesized.
