faced intense levels chloroquine (cq) resistance plasmodium falciparum
malaria, rwanda replaced cq amodiaquine (aq)+sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) 
in 2001, subsequently artemether-lumefantrine (al) 2006, as
first-line treatments uncomplicated malaria. following years of
discontinuation cq use, re-emergence cq-susceptible parasites been
reported countries including malawi, kenya tanzania. contrast, high
levels sp resistant mutant parasites continue reported even countries
of presumed reduced sp drug selection pressure. prevalence distributions 
of genetic polymorphisms linked cq sp resistance two sites of
different malaria transmission intensities described better
understand drug-related genomic adaptations time exposure varying
drug pressures rwanda. using filter paper blood isolates collected p.
falciparum infected patients, dna extracted nested pcr performed to
identify resistance-mediating polymorphisms pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhps and
pfdhfr genes. amplicons total 399 genotyped samples analysed by
ligase detection reaction fluorescent microsphere assay. cq susceptible pfcrt 76k
and pfmdr1 86n wild-type parasites found 50% 81% isolates,
respectively. concurrently, sp susceptible pfdhps double (437g-540e), pfdhfr
triple (108n-51i-59r), quintuple pfdhps 437g-540e/pfdhfr 51i-59r-108n and
sextuple haplotypes found 84%, 85%, 74% 18% isolates,
respectively. high-level sp resistance associated pfdhfr 164l pfdhps 581g
mutant prevalences noted decline. mutations pfcrt 76t, pfdhfr 59r and
pfdhfr 164l found differentially distributed two study sites
with pfdhfr 164l mutants found ruhuha site, eastern rwanda. overall, 
sustained intense levels sp resistance mutations recovery cq
susceptible parasites found study following 7 years 14 years 
drug withdrawal use, respectively. likely, sustained high
prevalence resistant parasites due use dhfr/dhps inhibitors like 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (ts) treatment prophylaxis against
bacterial infections among hiv infected individuals well continued use 
of iptp-sp within east central african regions malaria prevention
among pregnant women. regard cq, slow recovery cq susceptible
parasites may caused partly continued use cq and/or cq
mimicking antimalarial drugs like aq spite policies withdraw from
rwanda neighbouring countries uganda tanzania. continued
surveillance p. falciparum cq sp associated polymorphisms recommended
for guiding future rational drug policy-making mitigation future risk of
anti-malaria drug resistance development.
