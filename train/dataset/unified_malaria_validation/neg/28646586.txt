although epidemiological observations, igg passive transfer studies and
experimental infections humans support feasibility developing
highly effective malaria vaccines, precise antigens induce protective
immunity remain uncertain. here, review methodologies applied vaccine
candidate discovery plasmodium falciparum malaria pre- to
post-genomic era. probing genomic cdna libraries antibodies of
defined specificities functional activity predominated former, whereas
reverse vaccinology encompassing high throughput silico analyses genomic,
transcriptomic proteomic parasite data sets mainstay latter.
antibody-guided vaccine design spanned eras currently benefits from
technological advances facilitating high-throughput screening downstream
applications. make case although exponentially increased 
ability identify numerous potential vaccine candidates relatively short
space time, significant bottleneck remains validation and
prioritization evaluation clinical trials. longitudinal cohort studies
provide supportive evidence results often conflicting studies.
demonstration antigen-specific antibody function valuable relative 
importance one mechanism another regards protection remains
undetermined. animal models offer useful insights may accurately reflect 
human disease. challenge studies humans preferable prohibitively
expensive. absence reliable correlates protection, suitable animal
models better understanding mechanisms underlying protective immunity
in humans, vaccine candidate discovery per se may sufficient provide
the paradigm shift necessary develop next generation highly effective
subunit malaria vaccines.
