schistosomiasis second malaria terms global impact among
diseases caused parasites. striking feature schistosomes their
ability thrive hosts decades. previously demonstrated
that stem cells, called neoblasts, promote homeostatic tissue maintenance in
adult schistosomes suggested cells likely contribute parasite
longevity. whether schistosome neoblasts functions independent of
homeostatic tissue maintenance, example processes tissue
regeneration following injury, remains unexplored. characterize the
schistosome cbp/p300 homolog, sm-cbp1. found depleting cbp1 transcript
levels rna interference (rnai) resulted increased neoblast proliferation 
and cell death, eventually leading organ degeneration. based these
observations speculated increased rate neoblast proliferation may a
response mitigate tissue damage due increased cell death. therefore, we
tested mechanical injury sufficient stimulate neoblast proliferation.
we found mechanical injury induced cell death neoblast
proliferation wound sites, suggesting schistosome neoblasts capable
of mounting proliferative responses injury. furthermore, observed 
health cbp1(rnai) parasites progressively declined course in
vitro experiments. determine fate cbp1(rnai) parasites context
of mammalian host, coupled rnai established technique transplant 
schistosomes mesenteric veins uninfected mice. found transplanted 
cbp1(rnai) parasites cleared vasculature recipient mice were
incapable inducing measurable pathology recipient hosts. together our
data suggest injury sufficient induce neoblast proliferation 
cbp1 essential parasite survival vivo. studies present new
methodology study schistosome gene function vivo highlight potential 
role schistosome neoblasts promoting tissue repair following injury.
