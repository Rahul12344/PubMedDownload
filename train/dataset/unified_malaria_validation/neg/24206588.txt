background: despite widespread coverage emergence artemisinin
resistance, relatively little known parasite populations
responsible. use pcr genotyping around highly polymorphic plasmodium
falciparum msp1, msp2 glurp genes become well established to
describe variability alleles within population parasites, well as
classify treatment outcome cases recurrent disease. primary objective
was assess emergence minority parasite clones seven days of
artesunate (as) treatment location established artemisinin resistance. 
an additional objective investigate whether classification clinical
outcomes remained valid additional genotyping performed.
methods: blood parasite genotyping collected 143 adult patients
presenting uncomplicated falciparum malaria clinical trial as
monotherapy western cambodia. nested allelic type-specific amplification of
the genes encoding merozoite surface proteins 1 2 (msp1 msp2) the
glutamate-rich protein (glurp) performed baseline, daily seven days
of treatment, failure. allelic variants analysed respect
to size polymorphisms using quantity one software enable identification
of polyclonal infections.
results: considerable variation msp2 alleles well-conserved msp1 glurp
were identified. baseline, 31% infections polyclonal one more
genes. patients recurrent malaria significantly likely have
polyclonal infections patients without recurrence (seven nine versus 36
of 127, p = 0.004). emergence minority alleles treatment detected
in one twenty-three cases defined artemisinin resistant.
moreover, daily genotyping alter final outcome classification 
recurrent cases.
conclusions: parasites responsible artemisinin-resistant malaria a
clinical trial western cambodia comprise dominant clones acute malaria 
infections rather minority clones emerging treatment. additional
genotyping therapy beneficial. disproportionately high rates of
polyclonal infections cases recurrence suggest complex infections lead to
poor treatment outcomes. current research objectives broadened to
include identification follow-up recurrent polyclonal infections 
define role potential agents emerging resistance.
