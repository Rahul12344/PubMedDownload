the development blood-stage malaria vaccine largely focused the
subunit approach. however, limited success strategy, mainly due to
antigenic polymorphism failure maintain potent parasite-specific
immune responses, indicates approaches must considered. whole
parasite (wp) vaccines offer many advantages sub-units; represent every
antigen organism, thus limiting effects antigenic polymorphism, and
similarly compensate individual immune-response (ir) gene-regulated
non-responsiveness particular antigen. development perspective,
they negate need identify compare relative efficacies of
individual candidate antigens. wp vaccines induce protective immunity is
largely cell-mediated. however, wp blood-stage vaccines present number of
challenges development pathway. key issues cryopreservation and
storage possible induction antibodies red blood cell surface

parasitized p. falciparum. used antigens construct
liposomes modified present mannose membrane target 
liposome antigen presenting cells. compared immunogenicity of
freshly prepared lyophilized liposome vaccines. following vaccination of
mice, liposomes induced significantly lower antibody responses human red cells
but potent strain- species-transcending cell-mediated immune responses to
parasite antigens. data support transitioning p. falciparum liposomal
