plasmodium falciparum, causative agent malaria, contributes significant
morbidity mortality worldwide. forward genetic analysis blood-stage
asexual cycle identified putative phosphatase pf3d7_1305500 an
important element intraerythrocytic development expressed throughout life 
cycle. preliminary evaluation identified atypical mitogen-activated 
protein kinase phosphatase. additional bioinformatic analysis delineated a
conserved signature motif three residues potential importance to
functional activity atypical dual-specificity phosphatase domain. a
homology model dual-specificity phosphatase domain developed use
in high-throughput silico screening available library antimalarial
compounds chembl-ntd. seven compounds set predicted affinity 
to active site tested vitro cultures, three reduced
activity ∆pf3d7_1305500 parasite, suggesting pf3d7_1305500 a
potential target selected compounds. identification compounds
provides novel starting point structure-based drug discovery strategy
that moves us closer toward discovery new classes clinical antimalarial
drugs. data suggest mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases
represent potentially new class p. falciparum drug target.
