background: tetrahymena thermophila possesses many attributes render an
attractive host expression recombinant proteins. surface proteins from
the parasites ichthyophthirius multifiliis plasmodium falciparum avian
influenza virus antigen h5n1 displayed cell membrane ciliate.
furthermore, demonstrated t. thermophila also able produce
a functional human dnase i. present study investigates heterologous
expression functional human intestinal alkaline phosphatase (hiap) using
t. thermophila thereby presents powerful tool optimization the
ciliate-based expression system.
results: functional full length human intestinal alkaline phosphatase was
expressed t. thermophila using codon-adapted gene containing native
signal-peptide gpi (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchor attachment signal.
hiap activity cell extract transformants suggested hiap gene
was successfully expressed. furthermore, demonstrated enzyme 
modified n-glycosylation localized surface membrane the
c-terminal gpi anchor. c-terminally truncated version hiap lacking gpi
anchor signal peptide secreted medium active enzyme. a
first approach establish high level expression system 14,000 u/liter
were produced time frame two days, exceeds production rate of
other published expression systems enzyme.
conclusions: expression hiap, protein commercial
interest could produced, also reporter enzyme offers the
possibility analyze t. thermophila genes play role regulation of
protein secretion. additionally, fact ciliates secrete an
endogenous alkaline phosphatase provides possibility use truncated
hiap reporter enzyme, allowing quantification measures be
necessary optimization host strains fermentation
processes.
