background: anopheles sinensis primary vector vivax malaria china
and control great threat development insecticide
resistance. contrast physiological resistance, report of
behavioural modifications resistant an. sinensis long-term insecticide
use, despite huge potential impact malaria transmission.
methods: larvae pupae an. sinensis collected yuanyang, bishan,
and wuhe counties southwestern eastern china. resistance deltamethrin 
was assayed using standard world health organization (who) susceptibility
test. frequency distribution kdr allele para-type sodium
channel gene determined polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification 
dna sequencing. contact repellency deltamethrin-impregnated bed nets was
evaluated using modified cone bioassay.
results: contemporary field populations three geographic locations
were resistant deltamethrin, mortality ranging 6.00 26.79%. three
kdr genotypes either l1014f l1014c substitution frequencies of
76.10-100% identified bishan wuhe populations, kdr
mutations detected yuanyang samples despite high phenotypic
resistance. susceptible mosquitoes exhibited significantly longer flying time
and takeoffs deltamethrin-treated bed nets (dtn) untreated bed
nets (utn), suggestive robust avoidance behaviour. however, significant
increases frequency takeoffs flying time observed in
deltamethrin-resistant an. sinensis populations exposed dtns, regardless 
of presence kdr mutation. moreover, first takeoff dtns by
resistant mosquitoes significantly lagged behind compared susceptible
mosquitoes.
conclusion: an. sinensis populations highly resistant deltamethrin
and exhibited decreased avoidance behaviour. behavioural modification
significantly associated deltamethrin resistance, directly related
to presence kdr mutations, indicating additional factors
contributing changes.
