sand flies include group insects medical importance that
vary geographic distribution, ecology, pathogen transmission.
approximately 163 species sand flies reported colombia.
surveillance presence sand fly species actualization species
distribution important predicting risks monitoring expansion 
of diseases sand flies transmit. currently, identification of
phlebotomine sand flies based morphological characters. however,
morphological identification requires considerable skills taxonomic
expertise. addition, significant morphological similarity some
species, especially among females, may cause difficulties the
identification process. dna-based approaches become increasingly useful 
promising tools estimating sand fly diversity ensuring rapid 
accurate identification species. partial sequence mitochondrial
cytochrome oxidase gene subunit (coi) currently used differentiate 
species different animal taxa, including insects, referred a
barcoding sequence. present study explored utility dna barcode
approach identification phlebotomine sand flies colombia. we
sequenced 700 bp coi gene 36 species collected different
geographic localities. coi barcode sequence divergence within single
species <2% cases, whereas divergence ranged 9% 26.6%
among different species. results indicated barcoding gene
correctly discriminated among previously morphologically identified species
with efficacy nearly 100%. analyses generated sequences indicated
that observed species groupings consistent morphological
identifications. conclusion, barcoding gene useful species
discrimination sand flies colombia.
