background: falcipain-2a ([fp2a] pf3d7_1115700) plasmodium falciparum
cysteine protease hemoglobinase. functional fp2a required potent
activity artemisinin, vitro selection artemisinin resistance
selected fp2a nonsense mutation.
methods: investigate associations fp2a polymorphisms artemisinin
resistance characterize diversity enzyme parasites 
china-myanmar border, sequenced full-length fp2a gene 140 p falciparum 
isolates collected 2004-2011.
results: isolates grouped 8 different haplotype groups. haplotype
group appeared samples obtained 2008, coinciding implementation
of artemisinin-based combination therapy region. functional studies,
compared wild-type parasites, fp2a haplotypes demonstrated increased
ring survival, haplotype groups exhibited significantly reduced fp2a
activity, group showing slowest protease kinetics reduced parasite
fitness.
conclusions: results suggest altered hemoglobin digestion due fp2a 
mutations may contribute artemisinin resistance.
