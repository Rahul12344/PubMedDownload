background: malaria still poses one major threats human health.
development effective antimalarial drugs decreased threat; however,
the emergence drug-resistant plasmodium falciparum, cause malaria, is
disconcerting. antimalarial drug chloroquine effectively used, but
resistant parasites spread worldwide. interestingly, withdrawal the
drug reportedly leads increased population susceptible parasites some
cases. examined prevalence genomic polymorphisms malaria parasite 
p. falciparum, associated resistance antimalarial drug chloroquine,
after withdrawal drug indonesia.
results: blood samples collected 95 malaria patients north sulawesi,
indonesia, 2010. parasite dna extracted analyzed polymerase chain
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) pfcrt and
pfmdr1. parallel, multiplex amplicon sequencing genes carried
out illumina miseq. 59 cases diagnosed p. falciparum infection 
microscopy, pcr-rflp analysis clearly identified genotype 76t pfcrt 44 
cases. sequencing analysis validated identified genotypes 44 cases and
demonstrated haplotype surrounding genomic region exclusively
svmnt. results pfmdr1 successfully obtained 51 samples, the
genotyping results obtained two methods completely consistent. in
pfmdr1, 86y mutant genotype observed 45 cases (88.2%).
conclusions: results suggest prevalence mutated genotypes
remained dominant even 6Â years withdrawal chloroquine this
region. diversified haplotype resistance-related locus, potentially
involved fitness costs, unauthorized usage chloroquine, and/or short
post-withdrawal period may account observed high persistence of
prevalence.
