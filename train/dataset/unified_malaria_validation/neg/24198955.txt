genetically engineered (ge) insects potential radically change pest
management worldwide. recent approvals ge insect releases, a
need synthesized framework evaluate potential ecological and
evolutionary effects. effects may occur two phases: transitory phase
when focal population changes density, steady state phase it
reaches new, constant density. review potential effects rapid change in
insect density related population outbreaks, biological control, invasive
species, ge organisms identify comprehensive list potential
ecological evolutionary effects ge insect releases. apply this
framework anopheles gambiae mosquito - malaria vector engineered
to suppress wild mosquito population - identify effects may occur
during transitory steady state phases release. methodology
reveals many potential effects phase, perhaps notably dealing 
with immunity transitory phase, pathogen vector evolution 
the steady state phase. importantly, framework identifies knowledge gaps 
mosquito ecology. identifying effects transitory steady state phases
allows rigorous identification potential ecological effects ge
insect release.
