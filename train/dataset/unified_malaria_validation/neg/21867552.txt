background: resistance anti-malarial drugs widespread problem control
programmes devastating disease. molecular tests available many
anti-malarial drugs useful tools surveillance drug resistance.
however, correlation treatment outcome molecular tests particular
parasite markers perfect, due part individuals able clear
genotypically drug-resistant parasites. study aimed identify molecular
markers human genome correlate clearance malaria
parasites drug treatment, despite drug resistance profile the
protozoan predicted molecular approaches.
methods: 3721 samples five african countries, known contain
genotypically drug resistant parasites, analysed. parasites were
collected patients subsequently failed clear infection
following drug treatment, expected, also patients successfully
cleared infections drug-resistant parasites. 67 human polymorphisms
(snps) 17 chromosomes analysed using sequenom's mass spectrometry iplex
gold platform, identify regions human genome, contribute to
enhanced clearance drug resistant parasites.
results: analysis data five countries revealed significant
associations phenotype ability clear drug-resistant plasmodium 
falciparum infection human immune response loci common populations.
overall, three snps showed significant association clearance of
drug-resistant parasites odds ratios 0.76 snp rs2706384 (95% ci
0.71-0.92, p = 0.005), 0.66 snp rs1805015 (95% ci 0.45-0.97, p = 0.03), and
0.67 snp rs1128127 (95% ci 0.45-0.99, p = 0.05), adjustment for
possible confounding factors. first two snps (rs2706384 rs1805015) are
within loci involved pro-inflammatory (interferon-gamma) anti-inflammatory
(il-4) cytokine responses. third locus encodes protein involved the
degradation misfolded proteins within endoplasmic reticulum, role,
if any, clearance phenotype unclear.
conclusions: study showed significant association three loci human 
genome ability parasite clear drug-resistant p. falciparum in
samples taken five countries distributed across sub-saharan africa. snp
rs2706384 snp1805015 previously reported associated risk
of malaria infection african populations. loci involved th1/th2
balance, association snps within genes suggests key role for
antibody clearance drug-resistant parasites. possible that
patients able clear drug-resistant infections enhanced ability to
control parasite growth.
