in study, performed cell-free expression plasmodium proteins using the
in vitro human cell-free protein expression systems dna mrna. malaria
rhoptry genes (pfc14_0344, pfc0120w, py01759, py00763, py07482, py04666) 
a maurer's cleft gene (pfa0680c) identified proteome analysis studies were
cloned pt7cfe1-chis expression vector. following coupled
transcription-translation procedure, expressed proteins analyzed his-tag 
staining western blotting using protein specific antibodies and
nickel-horseradish peroxidase (hrp) histidine detection. antibodies against
whole rhoptries plasmodium falciparum plasmodium yoelii merozoites and
antibodies specific pfmc-2tm protein identified translated proteins. 
rhoptry specific antibodies exhibited cross reactivity among expressed
proteins p. falciparum p. yoelii. results demonstrate in
vitro human cell-free protein expression system suitable rapid expression 
and screening malaria vaccine candidates diagnostic biomarkers.
