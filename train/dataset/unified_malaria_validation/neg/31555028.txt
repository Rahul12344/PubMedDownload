objective: parasites genus plasmodium cause great deal morbidity 
mortality worldwide, largely regions limited access indication the
tools necessary control mosquito populations treat human infections 
malaria. five species class eukaryotic pathogens cause different human
diseases, plasmodium falciparum alone infecting approximately 500 million
people per year resulting approximately one million deaths.
materials methods: two genes encoding shewanella-like protein
phosphatases p. falciparum, shlp1 shlp2, conserved among members of
plasmodiidae family. shlp frequently found asexual blood stages and
expressed stages life cycle parasite. shlp deletion results a
reduction microneme formation, ookinetes (zygote) development, complete
ablation oocyst formation, thereby blocking transmission parasite.
structure modeling shlp protein helpful understanding active
site binding site information hence used drug designing and
for therapeutics malaria. study shlp variants carried 
using uniprotkb database. homology modeling performed using schr√∂dinger
software, modeled structure verified using ramachandran plot. ten
antioxidants searched pubchem database docking comparative
analysis. docking carried shlp-modeled protein, the
ligand-protein interaction map analyzed. effective role resveratrol was
studied shlp protein using docking method identify protein-ligand
interaction scheme bond formation.
results: shlp protein modeled docking carried identify the
binding sites interaction shlp protein. docking study suggested that
resveratrol strong interaction shlp protein used a
potential ligand drug designing.
conclusion: shlp plays crucial role ookinetes microneme development in
plasmodium; hence ligand, interact inhibit shlp protein, a
potential drug malarial parasite development. studied binding of
antioxidant, resveratrol, protein-using docking method it
was found resveratrol antioxidant bind target shlp
protein.
