objective: elucidate genetic diversity plasmodium falciparum in
residual transmission foci northern india.
methods: clinically suspected patients malaria screened malaria
infection microscopy. 48 p. falciparum-infected patients enrolled from
tertiary care hospital chandigarh, india. blood samples collected from
enrolled patients, genomic dna extraction nested pcr performed for
further species confirmation. sanger sequencing carried using block 2
region msp1, r2 region glurp pfs25-specific primers.
results: extensive diversity found msp1 alleles predominantly ro33
alleles. overall allelic prevalence 55.8% ro33, 39.5% mad20 4.7% 
for k1. six variants observed mad20, whereas variant found ro33
and k1 alleles. phylogenetic analysis ro33 alleles indicated similarity
to south african isolates, whereas mad20 alleles showed similarity with
south-east asian isolates. glurp, extensive variation observed eleven
different alleles based aau repeats. however, pfs25 showed less diversity 
and stable among targeted genes.
conclusion: findings document genetic diversity among circulating strains
of p. falciparum area india low malaria transmission could have
implications control strategies reach national goal malaria
elimination.
