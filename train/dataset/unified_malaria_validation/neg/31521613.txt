background: transcriptome plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates varies
according strain, mosquito bites, disease severity clinical history.
therefore, remains challenge directly interpret parasite's
transcriptomic information general biological signature natural 
human malaria infection. confounding variations potentially overcome
with parasites derived controlled-human malaria infection (chmi) studies.
methods: performed chmi studies healthy immunologically naïve
volunteers receiving p. falciparum strain ((sanaria® pfspz challenge
(nf54)), different sporozoite dosage route infection. parasites
isolated volunteers day patency subjected vitro
culture several generations synchronized ring-stage parasites were
subjected transcriptome profiling.
findings: observed clear deviations chmi-derived parasites from
volunteer groups receiving different pfspz dose route. chmi-derived parasites
and pre-mosquito strain used pfspz generation showed significant
transcriptional variability gene clusters associated malaria
pathogenesis, immune evasion transmission. transcriptional variation
signature clusters also observed transcriptome p. falciparum
isolates acute clinical infections.
interpretation: work identifies previously unrecognized transcriptional
pattern malaria infections non-immune background. significant
transcriptome heterogeneity exits parasites derived human infections
and pre-mosquito strain, implying malaria parasites undergo change
in functional state adapt host environment. work also highlights
the potential use transcriptomics data chmi study advance our
understanding malaria parasite adaptation transmission humans. fund:
