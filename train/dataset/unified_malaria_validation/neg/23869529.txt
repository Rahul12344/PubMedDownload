plasmodium parasites remodel vertebrate host cells translocating
hundreds proteins across encasing membrane host cell cytosol via a
putative export machinery termed ptex. previously ptex150, hsp101 exp2 have
been shown bona fide members ptex. validate ptex88 trx2
are also genuine members ptex provide evidence expression ptex
components also expressed early gametocytes, mosquito liver stages,
consistent observations protein export restricted asexual
stages. although amenable genetic tagging, hsp101, ptex150, exp2 ptex88
could genetically deleted plasmodium berghei, keeping the
obligatory role complex postulated maintaining normal
blood-stage growth. contrast, putative thioredoxin-like protein trx2 could
be deleted, knockout parasites displaying reduced grow-rates, vivo
and vitro, reduced capacity cause severe disease cerebral malaria 
model. thus, essential parasite survival, trx2 may help optimize
ptex activity. importantly, generation trx2 knockout parasites that
display altered phenotypes provides much-needed tool dissect ptex function.
