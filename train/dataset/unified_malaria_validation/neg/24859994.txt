mutations plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt)
protein confer resistance antimalarial drug chloroquine. pfcrt localizes
to parasite digestive vacuole, site chloroquine action, it
mediates resistance transporting chloroquine digestive vacuole.
pfcrt belongs family transporter proteins called chloroquine
resistance transporter family. crt family proteins found throughout the
apicomplexa, protists, plants. despite importance pfcrt 
drug resistance, little known evolution native function crt
proteins. apicomplexan parasite toxoplasma gondii contains one crt family
protein. demonstrate t. gondii crt (tgcrt) colocalizes markers for
the vacuolar (vac) compartment parasites. tgcrt-containing vac 
highly dynamic organelle, changing morphology protein composition between
intracellular extracellular forms parasite. regulated knockdown of
tgcrt expression resulted modest reduction parasite fitness swelling of
the vac, indicating tgcrt contributes parasite growth vac physiology.
together, findings provide new information role crt family proteins
in apicomplexan parasites.
