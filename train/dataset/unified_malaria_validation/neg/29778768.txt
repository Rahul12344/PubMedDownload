glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency commonly seen malaria
endemic areas known confer selective advantage malaria.
recently, reported high proportion asymptomatic reservoir plasmodium
vivax botswana, calls intervention primaquine achieve radical
cure vivax malaria. considering individuals enzyme deficiency
are risk haemolysis following primaquine treatment, assessment the
population relative frequency g6pd deficiency imperative. samples
from 3019 children districts botswana successfully genotyped
for polymorphisms positions 202 376 g6pd gene. haematological
parameters also measured. overall population allele frequency (based 
the hemizygous male frequency) 2.30% (95% ci, 1.77-2.83), overall
frequency g6pd-deficient genotypes a- (hemizygote homozygote genotypes
only) 1.26% (95% ci, 0.86-1.66). g6pd deficiency spread botswana
according historical prevalence malaria north-west south-east
decreasing gradient trend. association g6pd status p.
vivax infection. g6pd a- form found associated decreased rbc count
and haemoglobin levels without known cause illness. conclusion, report
for first time prevalence g6pd deficiency botswana is
relevant strategies malaria elimination campaign. work to
examine activities enzyme botswana population risk for
malaria warranted.
