the use biomedical snp markers diseases improve effectiveness of
treatment. genotyping patients subsequent searching snps more
frequent norm commonly accepted method identification 
snp markers within framework translational research. bioinformatics
applications aimed millions unannotated snps "1000 genomes" make
this search snp markers focused less expensive. used web
service involving fisher's z-score candidate snp markers find a
significant change gene's expression. analyzed change caused 
snps gene's promoter via change affinity tata-binding protein 
for promoter. provide examples discuss use bioinformatics
application course practical analysis unannotated snps the
"1000 genomes" project. using known biomedical snp markers, identified 17
novel candidate snp markers nearby: rs549858786 (rheumatoid arthritis);
rs72661131 (cardiovascular events rheumatoid arthritis); rs562962093 (stroke);
rs563558831 (cyclophosphamide bioactivation); rs55878706 (malaria resistance,
leukopenia), rs572527200 (asthma, systemic sclerosis, psoriasis), rs371045754
(hemophilia b), rs587745372 (cardiovascular events); rs372329931, rs200209906,
rs367732974, rs549591993 (all four: cancer); rs17231520 rs569033466
(both: atherosclerosis); rs63750953, rs281864525, rs34166473 (all three:
malaria resistance, thalassemia).
