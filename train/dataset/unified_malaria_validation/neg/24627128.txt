sterols essential class lipids eukaryotes, serve as
structural components membranes play important roles signaling
molecules. sterols also high pharmacological significance:
cholesterol-lowering drugs blockbusters human health, inhibitors of
ergosterol biosynthesis widely used antifungals. inhibitors ergosterol 
synthesis also developed chagas's disease, caused trypanosoma
cruzi. develop silico pipeline globally evaluate sterol
metabolism perform comparative genomics. generate library hidden
markov model-based profiles 42 sterol biosynthetic enzymes, allows
expressing genomic makeup given species numerical vector.
hierarchical clustering vectors functionally groups eukaryote proteomes 
and reveals convergent evolution, particular metabolic reduction obligate
endoparasites. experimentally explore sterol metabolism testing set of
sterol biosynthesis inhibitors trypanosomatids, plasmodium falciparum,
giardia, mammalian cells, quantifying expression levels sterol
