leprosy chronic bacterial disease caused mycobacterium leprae. cytokines 
are known play vital role peacekeeper inflammatory other
immunocompromised conditions leprosy. study tried bridge 
gap information cytokine gene polymorphisms potential role the
pathogenesis leprosy. interleukin-10 (il-10) immunosuppressive cytokine,
found elevated leprosy accounted suppression host's
immune system regulating functions immune cells. helper cells
and regulatory (tregs) cells major source il-10 lepromatous
leprosy patients. study, documented association il-10
cytokine gene polymorphism disease progression. total 132
lepromatous leprosy patients 120 healthy controls analyzed il-10
cytokine gene polymorphisms using pcr-ssp assay flow cytometry used to
analyze il-10 secretion cd4 tregs various genotype leprosy patients.
the frequencies il-10 (-819) tt il-10 (-1082) gg genotypes were
significantly higher leprosy patients compared healthy controls. this
observation advocates genotypes associated the
susceptibility development disease. addition, flow cytometry
analysis demonstrated increased number il-10 producing cd4 treg cells
in il-10 (819) tt genotype compared ct cc genotypes. observations
were supported immunohistochemical studies. therefore, conclude
that il-10 cytokine gene polymorphisms affecting production determine 
the predilection progression leprosy study population.
