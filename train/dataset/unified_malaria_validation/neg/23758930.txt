background: sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) use treatment 
uncomplicated falciparum malaria malaysia since 1970s still widely 
employed spite widespread clinical resistance. resistance sp known to
be mediated mutations pfdhfr pfdhps genes. aim present
study investigate distribution pfdhfr pfdhps gene polymorphism 
in plasmodium falciparum field isolates kalabakan, sabah, northern
borneo.
methods: total number 619 individuals screened 23 study sites of
which 31 positive p. falciparum. analysis restriction fragment length
polymorphisms (rflp) used identify polymorphism pfdhfr pfdhps
genes positions 16, 51, 59, 108, 164 437, 540, 581, respectively.
results: samples least one mutation genes associated
with drug resistance. prevalence pfdhfr 59arg, 164leu 108asn were
100%, 80.65% 58.06%, respectively. pfdhps mutants 437gly 581gly accounted
for 100% 74.19% respectively. pfdhfr, common mutant genotypes
were combination 59arg + 164leu (22.58%) 59arg + 108asn + 164leu (51.61%). in
pfdhps common genotype 437gly + 581gly (74.19%). one individual
(3.22%) harboured parasites four pfdhfr (16 val + 59arg + 108asn + 164leu)
and two pfdhps (437gly + 581gly) mutations. highest quintuple pfdhfr/pfdhps
(41.94%) three pfdhfr (59arg + 108asn + 164gly) two pfdhps
(437gly + 581gly).
conclusion: data suggest high prevalence genetic variations conferring
resistance sp predict treatment failure becoming clinically
evident. areas like this, use sp may longer indicated.
