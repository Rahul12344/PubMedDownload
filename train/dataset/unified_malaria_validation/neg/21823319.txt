objective: study role tep1 gene anopheles dirns plasmodium 
yoelii infection rna interference.
methods: tep1 primers t7 promoter designed based sequence an.
dirus tep1 gene genbank database. pcr amplification tep1 gene was
completed an. dirus cdna template. adtep1 double-stranded rna was
synthesized using vitro transcription kit purified pcr products.
female an. dirus emerged 1-2 days divided three groups with
200 mosquitoes: tep1 interference group, egfp interference group control.
mosquitoes tep1 egfp interference groups microinjected chest 
147 ng adtep1 egfp double-stranded rna, respectively, of
control group untreated. effect tep1 interference p. yoelii an.
dirus estimated semi-quantitative pcr internal reference ads7 at
3 injection. 4 injection, mosquitoes infected by
egfp-expressing p. yoelii by265. infection rate infectivity mosquitoes
were observed anastomosing 25 midguts group 9 d
post-infection.
results: adtep1 double-stranded rna well interference tep1
expression an. dirus. infection rate groups control, egfp and
tep1 interference (24 +/- 2.83)%, (24 +/- 0.71)%, (80 +/- 3.54)%,
respectively; infectivity three groups 0.32 +/- 0.7, 0.44 +/- 
0.85, 5.52 +/- 4.84, respectively.
conclusion: adtep1 interference increases infection rate infectivity of
an. dirus p. yoelii, raises susceptibility an. dirus p. yoelii
significantly. tep1 plays critical role process p. yoelii infection.
