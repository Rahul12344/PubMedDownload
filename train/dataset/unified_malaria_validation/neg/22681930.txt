background: dna microarrays valuable tool malaria research for
over decade remain limited use part due relatively high cost,
poor availability, technical difficulty. aim alleviating 
these factors next-generation dna microarrays genome-wide transcriptome
analysis plasmodium falciparum plasmodium berghei using agilent 
8 x 15 k platform designed.
methods: probe design adapted previously published methods based 
the current transcript predictions available time p. falciparum
or p. berghei. array performance transcriptome analysis determined using 
dye-coupled, aminoallyl-labelled cdna streamlined methods hybridization, 
washing, array analysis developed.
results: new array design marks notable improvement number of
transcripts covered average number probes per transcript. array
performance excellent across wide range transcript abundance, low
inter-array inter-probe variability relative abundance measurements and
it recapitulated previously observed transcriptional patterns. additionally,
improvements sensitivity permitted 20-fold reduction necessary starting
rna amounts, reducing experimental costs widening range of
application.
conclusions: dna microarrays utilizing agilent 8 x 15 k platform for
genome-wide transcript analysis p. falciparum p. berghei mark an
improvement coverage sensitivity, increased availability research
community, simplification experimental methods.
