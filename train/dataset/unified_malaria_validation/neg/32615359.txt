histone modifying enzymes vital roles growth survival both
parasites humans. targeting epigenome new strategy the
treatment parasitic diseases. compounds modulating histone
acetylation/deacetylation recently reported hampering plasmodium,
schistosoma, leishmania, trypanosoma infections. beside new histone
deacetylase inhibitors, pfgcn5 bromodomain inhibitors recently
described inhibit plasmodium proliferation. sm histone deacetylase 8 and
smsirt2, well leishmania trypanosoma sirtuins (sir2rps), seem the
most reliable targets effectively fight related protozoan infections. 
selectivity toward parasite mammalian cells still open question, and
significant optimization efforts epidrugs still required improve
potency/selectivity decrease toxicity. recent reports alteration of
cellular signaling pathways provoked parasite infection changes the
host acetylation/deacetylation status gene promoters may suggest novel
therapeutic strategies treat diseases.
