lysine acetylation ubiquitous post-translational modification many
organisms including malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum, yet full
extent acetylation across parasite proteome remains unresolved. moreover, 
the functional significance acetylation specific acetyl-lysine sites
are regulated largely unknown. report seven-fold expansion the
known parasite 'acetylome', characterizing 2,876 acetylation sites 1,146
proteins. observe lysine acetylation targets diverse range protein
complexes particularly enriched within apicomplexan ap2 (apiap2)
dna-binding protein family. using quantitative proteomics determined that
artificial perturbation acetate/acetyl-coa balance alters the
acetyl-lysine occupancy several apiap2 dna-binding proteins related
transcriptional proteins. metabolic signaling could mediate significant
downstream transcriptional responses, show acetylation apiap2
dna-binding domain ablates dna-binding propensity. lastly, investigated
the acetyl-lysine targets class lysine deacetylase order begin
to explore class enzyme contributes regulating p. falciparum
acetylome.
