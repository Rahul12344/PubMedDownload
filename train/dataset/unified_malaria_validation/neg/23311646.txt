background: congenital malaria defined malaria parasitaemia first
week life. reported prevalence congenital malaria sub-saharan africa
is variable (0 - 46%). even though clinical significance congenital
malaria parasitaemia uncertain, anti-malarial drugs empirically prescribed
for sick newborns frontline health care workers. data prevalence of
congenital malaria high-risk newborns inform appropriate drug use and
timely referral sick newborns.
methods: blood samples untreated newborns less 1 week age time 
of referral korle bu teaching hospital accra, ghana peak malaria
seasons (april july) 2008 2010 examined malaria parasites by, 
i) giemsa-stained thick thin blood smears parasite count species
identification, ii) histidine-rich protein- lactic dehydrogenase-based rapid 
diagnosis tests, iii) polymerase chain reaction amplification merozoite
surface protein 2 gene, identification sub-microscopic parasitaemia. other
investigations also done clinically indicated.
results: 2008, nine cases plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia diagnosed
by microscopy 405 (2.2%) newborns. nine newborns low parasite
densities (â‰¤ 50 per microlitre). 2010, case parasitaemia by
either microscopy rapid diagnosis tests 522 newborns; however, 56/467 (12%)
cases p. falciparum detected polymerase chain reaction.
conclusion: congenital malaria uncommon cause clinical illness in
high-risk untreated newborns referred tertiary hospital first week of
life. empirical anti-malarial drug treatment sick newborns without laboratory
confirmation parasitaemia imprudent. early referral sick newborns to
hospitals resources skills appropriate care recommended.
