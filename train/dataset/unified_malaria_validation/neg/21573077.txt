background: plasmodium requires obligatory life stage mosquito host.
the parasites encounter number insults journeying host
and developed mechanisms avoid host defenses. lysozymes family of
important antimicrobial immune effectors produced mosquitoes response to
microbial challenge.
methodology/principal findings: mosquito lysozyme identified a
protective agonist plasmodium. immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that
anopheles gambiae lysozyme c-1 binds oocysts plasmodium berghei and
plasmodium falciparum 2 5 days infection. similar results were
observed anopheles stephensi p. falciparum, suggesting wide occurrence
of phenomenon across parasite vector species. lysozyme c-1 bind 
to cultured ookinetes recombinant lysozyme c-1 affect ookinete viability.
dsrna-mediated silencing lysc-1 anopheles gambiae significantly reduced the
intensity prevalence plasmodium berghei infection. conclude that
this host antibacterial protein directly interacts facilitates
development plasmodium oocysts within mosquito.
conclusions/significance: work identifies mosquito lysozyme c-1 a
positive mediator plasmodium development reduction reduces parasite
load mosquito host. findings improve understanding parasite
development provide novel target interrupt parasite transmission to
human hosts.
