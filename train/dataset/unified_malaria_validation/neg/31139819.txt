few information function stearoyl-coenzyme (coa) desaturase (scd) 
apicomplaxan parasite obtained. study, retrieved putative
fatty acyl-coa desaturase (tggt1_238950) protein alignment plasmodium
falciparum scd toxodb. typical δ9-desaturase domain revealed this
protein. putative desaturase tagged ha endogenously toxoplasma
gondii, endoplasmic reticulum localization putative desaturase was
revealed, consistent fatty acid desaturases other
organisms. therefore, tggt1_238950 designated t. gondii scd. based on
crispr/cas9 gene editing technology, scd conditional knockout mutants t.
gondii tati strain obtained. growth vitro pathogenicity mice
of mutants suggested scd might dispensable tachyzoite growth 
proliferation. scd-overexpressing line constructed explore scd
function. portion palmitoleic acid oleic acid increased in
scd-overexpressing parasites, compared rh parental strain, indicating
that t. gondii indeed competent unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. the
scd-overexpressing tachyzoites propagated slower parental strain, a
decreased invasion capability weaker pathogenicity mice. tgif2α
phosphorylation expression changes several genes demonstrated er 
stress triggered scd-overexpressing parasites, apt
toward autophagy apoptosis. function unsaturated fatty acid synthesis 
of tgscd consistent hypothesis. hand, scd might also be
involved tachyzoite autophagy apoptosis.
