background: pir genes comprise largest multi-gene family plasmodium,
with members found p. vivax, p. knowlesi rodent malaria species.
despite comprising 5% genome, little known functions of
the proteins encoded pir genes. p. chabaudi causes chronic infection mice, 
which may due antigenic variation. model, pir genes called cirs
and may involved mechanism, allowing evasion host immune responses.
in order fully understand role(s) cir proteins p. chabaudi
infection, detailed characterization cir gene family required.
results: cir repertoire annotated detailed bioinformatic
characterization encoded cir proteins performed. two major
sub-families identified, named b. members each
sub-family displayed different amino acid motifs, thus predicted have
undergone functional divergence. addition, expression entire cir
repertoire analyzed via rna sequencing microarray. 40% cir
gene repertoire expressed parasite population infection, and
dominant cir transcripts could identified. addition, differences 
observed pattern expression cir subgroups peak p.
chabaudi infection. finally, specific cir genes expressed different time 
points asexual blood stages.
conclusions: conclusion, large number cir genes expression
throughout intraerythrocytic cycle development indicates cir proteins
are likely important parasite survival. particular, detection of
dominant cir transcripts peak p. chabaudi infection supports idea
that cir proteins expressed, could perform important functions the
biology parasite. application methodologies described here
may allow elucidation cir sub-family b protein functions, including 
their contribution antigenic variation immune evasion.
