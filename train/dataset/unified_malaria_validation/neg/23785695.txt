background: malaria still remains public health problem iran. are
different vector control interventions insecticide spraying. present 
study carried determine susceptibility status anopheles
stephensi larvae temephos national plan monitoring mapping of
insecticide resistance.
methods: eight different localities two main malarious provinces were
determined field collecting sites. mosquitoes collected field
and reared insectray. susceptibility assays carried according to
the method. laboratory reared susceptible beech-lab strain used for
comparison. data analyzed using probit analysis determine lc50 lc90
values.
results: susceptibility an. stephensi temephos indicated lc50
ranged 0.0022 mg/l 0.0141 mg/l. although field strains were
susceptible temephos, considerable variations temephos resistance ratios of
field strains noticed localities studied comparison the
susceptible strain. low level resistance ratio noticed an. stephensi 
populations except chabahar strain (rr= 4.27 fold). field-collected
an. stephensi populations exhibited homogeneity larvicide except for
bandar abbas hormoodar village strains (p> 0.05%).
conclusion: due intensive use temephos neighboring countries and
occurrence resistant insecticide main malaria vector the
region, insecticide resistance gene may evolve populations an.
stephensi. temephos applied larvicide used judiciously
for resistance management, rotation strategy.
