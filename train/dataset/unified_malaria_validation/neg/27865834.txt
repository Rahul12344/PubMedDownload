the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum requires plasmodium translocon 
exported proteins (ptex) proliferate human red blood cells. the
blood stages malaria, several hundred parasite-encoded proteins exported
from parasite cytosol red blood cells. ptex translocon for
protein export comprises 5 proteins: exp2, ptex150, ptex88, hsp101 trx2. 
among them, exp2 thought constitute transmembrane pore, whereas the
other components seem play role unfolding luggage proteins or
providing driving force. however, detailed functional structural
characterizations ptex proteins performed. study, we
expressed characterized membrane-associated component exp2. because
expression exp2 lethal e. coli, exp2 expressed fusion protein
with gst, recombinant exp2 obtained protease digestion. the
recombinant exp2 formed pores bilayer lipid membranes. inner diameter of
the pore estimated approximately 3.5 nm based electron microscopy
images channel currents. size molecular mass determined 
by size exclusion chromatography blue native polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, determined pore comprises approximately 10-12 exp2
subunits. however, possibility pore structure different in
the ptex complex. results provide important insights protein
transport mechanism ptex, aid developing new drugs targeting
ptex.
