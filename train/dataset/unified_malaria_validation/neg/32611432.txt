background: anopheles mosquitoes vectors malaria, one most
important infectious diseases tropics. 500 anopheles species
have described worldwide, 30 considered public health
problem. honduras, information distribution anopheles spp. its
genetic diversity scarce. study aimed describe distribution and
genetic diversity anopheles mosquitoes honduras.
methods: mosquitoes captured 8 locations 5 malaria endemic departments
during 2019. two collection methods used. adult anophelines captured
outdoors using cdc light traps aspiration mosquitoes rest.
morphological identification performed using taxonomic keys. genetic analyses
included sequencing partial region cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene
(cox1) ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (its2).
results: total 1320 anophelines collected identified through
morphological keys. seven anopheles species identified. anopheles albimanus 
was widespread abundant species (74.02%). confirm the
morphological identification specimens, 175 122 sequences were
obtained cox1 its2, respectively. markers confirmed the
morphological identification. cox1 showed greater nucleotide diversity than
its2 species. high genetic diversity observed within populations
of an. albimanus an. darlingi proved highly homogeneous population.
phylogenetic analyses revealed clustering patterns an. darlingi an. neivai
in relation specimens south america. new sequences an. crucians, an. 
vestitipennis an. neivai reported study.
conclusions: report distribution genetic diversity anopheles
species endemic areas malaria transmission honduras. according our
results, taxonomic molecular approaches useful tools the
identification anopheline mosquitoes. however, molecular markers differ
in ability detect intraspecific genetic diversity. results provide
supporting data better understanding distribution malaria vectors
in honduras.
