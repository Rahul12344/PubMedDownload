background: relationship glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd)
deficiency clinical phenomena primaquine-sensitivity protection
from severe malaria remains poorly defined, past association studies
yielding inconsistent conflicting results. one possibility that
examination single genetic variant might underestimate presence true 
effects presence unrecognized functional allelic diversity.
methods: systematically examined possibility kenya, conducting a
fine-mapping association study erythrocyte g6pd activity 1828 kenyan
children across 30 polymorphisms around g6pd locus.
results: demonstrate strong functional role c.202g>a (rs1050828), 
accounts majority variance enzyme activity observed (p=1.5×10⁻²⁰⁰, 
additive model). additionally, identify common variants exert
smaller, intercorrelated effects independent c.202g>a, haplotype analyses 
suggest variant tags one two haplotype motifs opposite in
sequence identity effect direction. posit effects of
biological possible clinical significance, specifically noting c.376a>g 
(rs1050829) augments 202ag heterozygote risk deficiency trait two-fold (or
= 2.11 [1.12 - 3.84], p=0.014).
conclusions: results suggest c.202g>a responsible majority of
the observed prevalence g6pd deficiency trait kenya, also identify a
novel role c.376a>g genetic modifier marks common haplotype that
augments risk conferred 202ag heterozygotes, suggesting variation 
both loci merits consideration genetic association studies probing g6pd
deficiency-associated clinical phenotypes.
