in sub-saharan africa, children 5 years bear greatest burden severe 
malaria lack naturally acquired immunity develops following
repeated exposure infections plasmodium falciparum. antibodies the
surface p. falciparum infected erythrocytes (ie) play important role in
this immunity. children age 6 months, relative protection from
severe malaria observed thought partly due to
trans-placental acquired protective maternal antibodies. however, protective 
effect maternal antibodies fully established, especially role
of antibodies variant surface antigens (vsa) expressed ie. here, we
assessed immune pressure parasites infecting infants using markers
associated acquisition naturally acquired immunity surface
antigens. hypothesized that, maternal antibodies vsa imposed selection
pressure parasites, expression relatively conserved subset of
var genes called group var genes infants change waning maternal 
antibodies. test this, compared expression parasites children
between 0 12 months 12 months age. transcript quantity and
the proportional expression group var subgroup, including containing
domain cassette 13, positively associated age first year 
life, contrasts 12 months. accompanied decline 
infected erythrocyte surface antibodies increase parasitemia during
this period. observed increase group var gene expression age the
first year life, maternal antibodies waning before
acquisition naturally acquired antibodies repeated exposure, is
consistent idea maternally acquired antibodies impose selection
pressure parasites infect infants may play role protecting these
infants severe malaria.
