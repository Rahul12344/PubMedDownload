artesunate (art) derivative artemisinin isolated traditional
chinese medicine qinghao. although several studies reported efficiency of
artesunate treatment malaria, inhibiting fibroblasts collagen
synthesis, association artesunate scar formation unclear. 
research designed study significance artesunate (art) the
expression transforming growth factor (tgf-β1) small mother against
decapentaplegic (smad3) rabbit's ear hypertrophic scar model. twenty-four new 
zealand white rabbits randomly divided six groups: control group,
matrix group, low-concentration artesunate group (0.48%), medium-concentration
artesunate group (0.96%), high-concentration artesunate group (1.92%) and
silicone gel group. punched defects established rabbit's ear which
resulted hypertrophic scar. 28th day, topical artesunate creams 
applied twice day except control group. 56th day, scar samples
were collected histopathology immunoassay. hematoxylin eosin
staining, van gieson staining, immunohistochemistry western blot analysis
were done. amongst six groups, findings showed medium-concentration 
artesunate group (0.92%) efficiently decreased hypertrophic scar formation and
significantly reduced fibroblasts collagen synthesis. results also
shown decrease expression transforming growth factor (tgf-β1) and
declined small signal mother decapentaplegic (smad3). overall study
shows efficacy mechanism artesunate. concluded medium
concentration artesunate (0.92%) could effective therapeutic agent for
hypertrophic scars.
