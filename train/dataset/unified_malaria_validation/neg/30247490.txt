in human malaria vector anopheles gambiae, gene doublesex (agdsx) encodes
two alternatively spliced transcripts, dsx-female (agdsxf) dsx-male (agdsxm),
that control differentiation two sexes. female transcript, unlike 
male, contains exon (exon 5) whose sequence highly conserved all
anopheles mosquitoes far analyzed. found crispr-cas9-targeted
disruption intron 4-exon 5 boundary aimed blocking formation of
functional agdsxf affect male development fertility, whereas females
homozygous disrupted allele showed intersex phenotype complete
sterility. crispr-cas9 gene drive construct targeting sequence spread
rapidly caged mosquitoes, reaching 100% prevalence within 7-11 generations
while progressively reducing egg production point total population
collapse. owing functional constraint target sequence, selection 
alleles resistant gene drive occurred laboratory experiments.
cas9-resistant variants arose generation target site not
block spread drive.
