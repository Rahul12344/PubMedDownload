malaria affects 300 million people worldwide every year 450,000 brazil. in
coastal areas brazil, main malaria vector anopheles aquasalis, and
plasmodium vivax responsible majority malaria cases the
americas. insects possess powerful immune system combat infections. three
pathways control insect immune response: toll, imd, jak-stat. we
analyze immune role a. aquasalis jak-stat pathway p. vivax
infection. three genes, transcription factor signal transducers and
activators transcription (stat), regulatory protein inhibitors of
activated stat (pias) nitric oxide synthase enzyme (nos) were
characterized. expression stat pias higher males females and
in eggs first instar larvae compared larvae pupae. rna levels for
stat pias increased 24 36 hours (h) p. vivax challenge. nos
transcription increased 36 h post infection (hpi) protein already 
detected midgut epithelial cells 24 hpi. imunocytochemistry experiments
using specific antibodies showed non-infected insects stat pias 
found mostly fat body, infected mosquitoes proteins were
found body tissues. knockdown stat rnai increased number
of oocysts midgut a. aquasalis. first clear evidence for
the involvement specific immune pathway interaction brazilian 
malaria vector a. aquasalis p. vivax, delineating potential target the
future development disease controlling strategies.
