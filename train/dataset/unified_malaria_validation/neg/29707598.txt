background: artemisinin-resistant malaria (arm) remains significant threat to
malaria elimination. greater mekong subregion, prevalence arm in
certain regions reached greater 90%. artemisinin-resistant malaria is
clinically identified delayed parasite clearance associated 
mutations propeller domain kelch 13 gene. c580y most
prevalent mutation. detection arm currently relies labor-intensive 
time-consuming methods clinical phenotyping vitro susceptibility
testing.
methods: developed novel single-nucleotide polymorphism loop mediated
isothermal amplification (snp-lamp) test method detection c580y
mutation using novel primer design strategy.
results: snp-lamp 90.0% sensitive (95% confidence interval [ci],
66.9-98.3) 91.9% specific (95% ci, 82.6-96.7) without knowledge the
parasite load 100% sensitive (95% ci, 79.9-100) 97.3% specific (95%
ci, 89.7-99.5) parasitemia within assay dynamic range. tests
with potential application near-to-patient snp-lamp may deployed in
low- middle-income developed countries.
conclusions: single-nucleotide polymorphism lamp serve surveillance tool
and guide treatment algorithms arm clinically relevant time frame,
prevent unnecessary use additional drugs may drive additional resistance,
and avoid longer treatment regimens cause toxicity patient.
