gene network (gn) inference temporal gene expression data crucial and
challenging problem systems biology. expression data sets usually consist of
dozens temporal samples, networks consist thousands genes, thus
rendering many inference methods unfeasible practice. improve the
scalability gn inference methods, propose novel framework called genice, 
based probabilistic gns; main novelty introduction clustering 
procedure group genes related expression profiles provide an
approximate solution reduced computational complexity. use defined
clusters perform exhaustive search retrieve best predictor gene
subsets target gene, according multivariate criterion functions.
genice greatly reduces search space predictor candidates are
restricted one gene per cluster. finally, multivariate analysis performed
for defined predictor subset retrieve minimal subsets simplify the
network. experiments silico generated data sets, genice achieved
substantial computational time reduction compared solutions without the
clustering step, preserving gene expression prediction accuracy even
when number clusters small (about 50) relative number genes
(order thousands). plasmodium falciparum microarray data set, the
prediction accuracy achieved genice roughly 97%, respective
topologies involving glycolytic apicoplast seed genes large
intramodularity, small interconnection modules, module hub 
genes, reflecting small-world scale-free topological properties, expected.
