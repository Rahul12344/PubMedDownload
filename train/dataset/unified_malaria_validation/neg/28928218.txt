clip domain serine protease homologs (sphs) positive negative regulators 
of anopheles gambiae immune responses mediated complement-like protein
tep1 plasmodium malaria parasites microbial infections. have
previously reported sph clipa2 negative regulator the
tep1-mediated response showing clipa2 knockdown (kd) enhances mosquito
resistance infections fungi, bacteria, plasmodium parasites. here, we
identify another sph, clipa14, novel regulator mosquito immunity. we
found clipa14 hemolymph protein rapidly cleaved following a
systemic infection. clipa14 kd mosquitoes elicited potent melanization response
against plasmodium berghei ookinetes exhibited significantly increased
resistance plasmodium infections well systemic oral bacterial
infections. activity enzyme phenoloxidase, initiates melanin
biosynthesis, dramatically increased hemolymph clipa14 kd mosquitoes in
response systemic bacterial infections. ookinete melanization hemolymph
phenoloxidase activity increased cosilencing clipa14 and
clipa2, suggesting two sphs act concert control melanization
response. interestingly, clipa14 rnai phenotypes infection-induced
cleavage abolished tep1 loss-of-function background. results
suggest complex network sphs functions downstream tep1 regulate
the melanization reaction.
