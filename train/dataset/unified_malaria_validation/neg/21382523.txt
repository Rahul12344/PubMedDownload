plasmodium vivax malaria globally widespread disease responsible 50% 
human malaria cases central south america, south east asia indian
subcontinent. rising severity disease emerging resistance the
parasite emphasized need search novel therapeutic targets to
combat p. vivax malaria. plasmepsin 4 (pm4) food vacuole aspartic protease is
essential parasite functions viability initiating hemoglobin
digestion processing proteins looked upon potential drug
target. although plasmepsins plasmodium falciparum extensively
studied, plasmepsins p. vivax well characterized. the
first report detailing complete pm4 gene analysis indian p. vivax isolates. 
blast results sequences p. vivax plasmepsin 4 (pvpm4) shows 100% homology
among isolates p. vivax collected different geographical regions of
india. seven indian isolates contain intron within coding 
region. interestingly, pvpm4 sequence analysis showed high degree of
homology sequences plasmodium species available the
genebank. results strongly suggest pvpm4 highly conserved except a
small number amino acid substitutions modify key motifs active
site formation function structure enzymes. furthermore, our
study shows pvpm4 occupies unique phylogenetic status within plasmodium
group sufficiently differ closely related human aspartic
protease, cathepsin d. analysis 3d model pm4 showed typical aspartic 
protease structure bi-lobed, compact distinct peptide binding cleft in
both p. vivax p. falciparum. order validate appropriate use pm4 as
potential anti-malarial drug target, studies genetic structural variations
among p. vivax plasmepsins (pvpms) different geographical regions of
utmost importance drugs vaccine designs anti-malarial strategies.
