our understanding composition multi-clonal malarial infections 
epidemiological factors shape diversity remain poorly understood.
traditionally within-host diversity defined terms multiplicity
of infection (moi) derived pcr-based genotyping. massively parallel, single
molecule sequencing technologies enable individual read counts derived 
on genome-wide datasets facilitating development new statistical
approaches describe within-host diversity. class measures f(ws)
metric characterizes within-host diversity relationship population
level diversity. utilizing p. falciparum field isolates patients west
africa explore relationship traditional moi f(ws)
approaches. f(ws) statistics derived read count data 86,158 snps 
64 samples sequenced illumina ga platform. moi estimates derived by
pcr msp-1 -2 loci. significant correlations observed 
two measures, particularly msp-1 locus (p = 5.92×10(-5)). f(ws)
metric robust pcr-based approach owing reduced
sensitivity potential locus-specific artifacts. furthermore f(ws) metric
captures information range parameters influence out-crossing risk
