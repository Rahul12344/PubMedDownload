plasmodium falciparum sexual stage surface antigen pfs25 well-established
candidate malaria transmission-blocking vaccine development. immunization
with dna vaccines encoding pfs25 shown elicit potent antibody
responses mice nonhuman primates. studies aimed optimization
have revealed improved immunogenicity application vivo
electroporation using heterologous prime-boost approach. goal the
studies reported systematically evaluate impact codon
optimization, vivo electroporation, n-linked glycosylation the
immunogenicity pfs25 encoded dna vaccines. results study
demonstrate codon optimization vivo electroporation greatly
improved functional immunogenicity pfs25 dna vaccines, presence absence
of n-linked glycosylation significantly impact vaccine efficacy. these
findings suggest n-glycosylation pfs25 encoded dna vaccines not
detrimental overall transmission-blocking efficacy.
