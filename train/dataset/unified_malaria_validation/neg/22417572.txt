background: major concern malaria vaccine development genetic
polymorphisms typically observed among plasmodium isolates different
geographical areas across world. highly polymorphic regions been
observed plasmodium falciparum plasmodium vivax antigenic surface proteins
such circumsporozoite protein (csp), duffy-binding protein (dbp), merozoite
surface protein-1 (msp-1), apical membrane antigen-1 (ama-1) thrombospondin
related anonymous protein (trap).
methods: genetic variability assessed important polymorphic regions of
various vaccine candidate antigens p. vivax among 106 isolates amazon
region loreto, peru. addition, genetic diversity determined peruvian
isolates compared population studies various geographical locations
worldwide.
results: structured diversity found p. vivax populations show a
geographic pattern haplotypes gene candidates distributed
worldwide. addition, evidence balancing selection found polymorphic 
regions trap, dbp ama-1 genes.
conclusions: important good representation haplotypes
circulating worldwide implementing vaccine, regardless geographic
region deployment since selective pressure plays important role in
structuring antigen diversity.
