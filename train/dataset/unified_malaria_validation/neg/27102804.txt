background: amplicon pyrosequencing targets known genetic region thus
inherently produces reads highly anticipated certain features, as
conserved nucleotide sequence, case protein coding dna, open
reading frame. pyrosequencing errors, consisting mainly nucleotide insertions 
and deletions, hand likely disrupt open reading frames. 
an inverse relationship errors expectation based prior knowledge
can used advantageously guide process known basecalling, i.e. the
inference nucleotide sequence raw sequencing data.
results: new basecalling method described here, named multipass, implements a
probabilistic framework working raw flowgrams obtained by
pyrosequencing. sequence variant multipass calculates likelihood and
nucleotide sequence several likely sequences given flowgram data.
this probabilistic approach enables integration basecalling larger
model parameters incorporated, likelihood for
observing full-length open reading frame targeted region. apply the
method 454 amplicon pyrosequencing data obtained malaria virulence gene
family, multipass generates 20 % error-free sequences current
state art methods, provides sequence characteristics allow
generation set high confidence error-free sequences.
conclusions: novel method used increase accuracy existing and
future amplicon sequencing data, particularly extensive prior knowledge 
available obtained sequences, example analysis the
immunoglobulin vdj region multipass combined model the
known recombining germline genes. multipass available roche 454 data at
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/multipass-1.0 , concept potentially be
implemented sequencing technologies well.
