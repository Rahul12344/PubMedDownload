background: plasmodium vivax re-emerged 1993. although number of
infections steadily decreasing, likely continue affect
public health eradicated. aim study measure
anti-circumsporozoite protein (csp) antibody compare malaria prevalence. as
to understand prevalence, epidemiology study conducted the
republic korea.
methods: total 1,825 1,959 blood samples collected 2010 and
2011, respectively, inhabitants ganghwa cheorwon counties. the
antibody titers inhabitants measured enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (elisa) using recombinant protein purified escherichia coli
transformed csp gene-inserted pet-28a(+) expression vector. microscopic
examination performed identify malaria parasites.
results: annual parasite incidence (api) ganghwa decreased 4.28 in
2010 2.23 2011, cheorwon decreased 1.88 2010 1.15 in
2011. antibody-positive csp rate areas also decreased 18.14%
(331/1825) 2010 15.36% (301/1959) 2011. pearson analysis showed strong
correlation api antibody-positive csp rate areas
(r = 1.000, p < 0.01). intensity immune responses inhabitants
of cheorwon, measured mean optical density, decreased from
0.9186 ± 0.0472 2010 0.7035 ± 0.0457 2011 (p = 0.034), increased 
ganghwa 0.7649 ± 0.0192 2010 0.8237 ± 0.1970 2011 (p = 0.006). 
immune response increased according age (r = 0.686, p = 0.041).
conclusions: positive csp-elisa rate closely related api the
study areas. suggests seroepidemiological studies based csp-elisa
may helpful estimating malaria prevalence. moreover, studies can
be used establish evaluate malaria control eradication programmes in
high-risk areas korea.
