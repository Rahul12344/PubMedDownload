by binding adaptor protein skp1 serving substrate receptors the
skp1 cullin, f-box e3 ubiquitin ligase complex, f-box proteins regulate critical 
cellular processes including cell cycle progression membrane trafficking.
while f-box proteins conserved throughout eukaryotes well studied 
yeast, plants, animals, studies parasitic protozoa lagging. have
identified eighteen putative f-box proteins toxoplasma genome which
four predicted homologs plasmodium. two conserved f-box proteins
were demonstrated important toxoplasma fitness focus 
f-box protein, named tgfbxo1, highly expressed by
replicative tachyzoites also identified interactome screen a
toxoplasma skp1 binding protein. tgfbxo1 interacts toxoplasma skp1
confirming bona fide f-box protein. interphase parasites, tgfbxo1 a
component inner membrane complex (imc), organelle that
underlies plasma membrane. early replication, tgfbxo1 localizes the
developing daughter cell scaffold, site daughter cell imc 
and microtubules form extend from. tgfbxo1 localization daughter cell 
scaffold required centrosome duplication kinetochore separation was
completed. daughter cell scaffold localization required tgfbxo1 n-myristoylation 
and dependent small molecular weight gtpase, tgrab11b. finally, we
demonstrate tgfbxo1 required parasite growth due function a
daughter cell scaffold effector. tgfbxo1 first f-box protein studied
in apicomplexan parasites represents first protein demonstrated be
important daughter cell scaffold function.
