artemisia annua tea popular dosage form used treat prevent malaria in
some developing countries. however, repeated drinking leads obviously
decreased efficacy, may related induction metabolizing enzymes
by artemisinin. present study, ability different components in
a. annua activate pregnane x receptor constitutive androstane receptor
was evaluated dual luciferase reporter gene system. changes mrna
and protein expression cyp3a4 cyp2b6 determined quantitative
real-time pcr western blotting. results showed pregnane x
receptor-mediated cyp3a4 reporter gene system, chrysosplenetin arteannuin b
exhibited weak induction effect pregnane x receptor wt, arteannuin a
had strong induction effect pregnane x receptor wt pregnane x receptor
370 weak induction effect pregnane x receptor 163. pregnane x
receptor-mediated cyp2b6 reporter gene system, arteannuin moderate
induction effect pregnane x receptor wt pregnane x receptor 379, a
weak induction effect pregnane x receptor 403, arteannuin b weak
induction effect pregnane x receptor wt pregnane x receptor 379.
arteannuin strong induction effect constitutive androstane receptor 3 
in constitutive androstane receptor-mediated cyp3a4/2b6 reporter gene systems,
while arteannuin b showed weak induction effect constitutive androstane
receptor 3 constitutive androstane receptor-mediated cyp2b6 reporter gene 
system. mrna protein expressions cyp3a4 cyp2b6 increased when
the pregnane x receptor constitutive androstane receptor activated.
various components present a. annua differentially affect activities of
pregnane x receptor isoforms constitutive androstane receptor, which
indicates possibility drug-drug interaction. partly explains the
decline efficacy repeated drinking a. annua tea.
