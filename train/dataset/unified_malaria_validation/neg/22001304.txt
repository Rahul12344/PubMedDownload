the main objective investigation whether combination therapy of
sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (sp) plus artesunate (as) protects spread
of resistance sp malaria-endemic south-eastern iran. infected blood samples
of plasmodium falciparum (n=170) collected 2008-2010 the
adoption sp-as first line treatment iran. four different genes p.
falciparum [dihydropteroate synthetase (pfdhps), dihydrofolate reductase
(pfdhfr), chloroquine (cq) resistance transporter (pfcrt k76t) multidrug
resistance1 (pfmdr1 n86y)], associated sp cq resistance analyzed
using pcr-rflp methods. result showed 4.1, 95.9 100% prevalence pfdhfr
51i, 59r 108n, respectively majority patients (95.9%) found
to carry 59r 108n. prevalence single mutation pfdhps 437g gene
was 26.9% adoption sp-as, sp used first line
treatment; mutation started increase reached high level 55.5% in
2008 (χ(2) test, p<0.05). however, three years introduction sp-as,
this prevalence reduced 55.5% (in 2008) 39.1% (in 2009) then
40.5% (in 2010). frequency parasites carrying pfdhfr/pfdhps mutations
(n(51)r(59)n(108)/g(437)) decreased 53.3% 2008 39.1% 2009 38%
in 2010. addition, significant reduction seen frequency of
mutant alleles pfcrt 76t pfmdr1 86y cq discontinued study
areas treatment p. falciparum. explained fixation of
pfcrt 76t falciparum populations need time recover cq
sensitivity absence drug pressure region. conclusion, the
present findings suggest iran, sp still effective treatment of
uncomplicated falciparum malaria partner drug artemisinin combination
therapy (act) region.
