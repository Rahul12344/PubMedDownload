background: malaria infection plasmodium falciparum important basic
health problem tropical sub-tropical countries. standard
diagnostic method blood film examination visualize parasite morphology.
however, cases low parasitemia mixed infection low cryptic
species, microscopy sensitive enough. therefore, molecular techniques have
been widely employed.
methods: label-free dna biosensor based quartz crystal microbalance (qcm) to
diagnose genotype p. falciparum developed. avidin-biotin interaction 
used coat specific biotinylated probe gold surface qcm. gene
encoding merozoite surface protein 2 (msp2) amplified pcr products
were cut restriction enzyme (mwoi). enzymatic cutting made pcr
products suitable qcm development. hybridization probe enzymatic 
cutting dna fragments resulted frequency changes qcm.
results: newly developed qcm tested diagnosis ability using 
malaria laboratory strains clinical isolates. biosensor sensitive 
the sub-nanogram level, specific p. falciparum detection, no
cross-reaction p. vivax, stable room temperature 6 months. 
selection msp2 target gene geno-typing marker made qcm
potentially useful falciparum diagnosis simultaneously genotyping.
potency tested genotyping two allelic families p. falciparum, fc27 
ic1, using malaria laboratory strains, k1 3d7, respectively.
conclusions: dual function qcm successfully developed high
sensitivity specificity, cost-effective, stable field adaptable.
