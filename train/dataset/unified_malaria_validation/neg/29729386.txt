many rapid diagnostic tests (rdt) used suspected malaria cases based on
the detection protein encoded plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich 
protein-2 (pfhrp2) gene, shares high sequence homology pfhrp3 the
3d7 reference genome. parasite isolates showing pfhrp2 pfhrp3 gene deletions 
have emerging years, comprehensive genetic analysis 
variants still lacking. purpose, genomic data experimental p.
falciparum genetic crosses different laboratory lines (3d7, hb3, dd2, 7g8
and gb4) first analysed (n = 98). frequency pfhrp2 deletions was
consistent mendelian prediction hb3 × dd2 (56.7%;
95%ci = (39.5%-72.9%)). moreover, pfhrp2 pfhrp3 deletions segregated
independently genetic cross. analysis 3d7 × hb3 
7g8 × gb4 estimated probability spontaneously generating pfhrp2 deletion
during sexual recombination 6.2%. next, whole genome sequence data
from 1970 p. falciparum isolates collected globally analysed. nine samples
displayed depth coverage consistent pfhrp2 deletions (0.5%), the
corresponding split-read analysis could confirm deletions seven these
samples. twenty-eight isolates evidence pfhrp3 deletions (1.4%), are
widespread southeast asia. finally, meta-analysis published data revealed
a positive mean association frequencies pfhrp2 pfhrp3
deletions africa south america. result suggested shared selective
pressure acting genetic variants. conclusion, evidence genetic
selection pfhrp2 pfhrp3 deletions presented, experimental
crosses provide evidence fitness cost variants. work
is urgently needed accurately determine prevalence degree of
association genetic variants, respective impact on
diagnostic accuracy many in-use rdt.
