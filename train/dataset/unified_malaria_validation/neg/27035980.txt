y chromosomes control essential male functions many species, including sex
determination fertility. however, obstacles posed repeat-rich
heterochromatin, knowledge chromosome sequences limited handful of
model organisms, constraining understanding biology across tree of
life. here, leverage long single-molecule sequencing determine content 
and structure nonrecombining chromosome primary african malaria
mosquito, anopheles gambiae find an. gambiae consists almost
entirely massively amplified, tandemly arrayed repeats, which
can recombine similar repeats x chromosome. sex-specific genome
resequencing recent species radiation, an. gambiae complex, revealed
rapid sequence turnover within an. gambiae among species. exploiting 52
sex-specific an. gambiae rna-seq datasets representing developmental stages, 
we identified small repertoire y-linked genes lack x gametologs are
not y-linked species except an. gambiae, notable exception 
of yg2, candidate male-determining gene. yg2 gene conserved and
exclusive species examined, yet sequence similarity yg2 not
detectable genome distant mosquito relative, suggesting rapid
evolution chromosome genes highly dynamic genus malaria vectors. 
the extensive characterization an. gambiae provides long-awaited
foundation studying male mosquito biology, inform novel mosquito
control strategies based manipulation chromosomes.
