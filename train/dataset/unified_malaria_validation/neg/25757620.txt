this chapter discusses emerging field vector-mediated antibody gene
transfer alternative vaccine infectious disease, specific focus 
on hiv. however, methodology need confined hiv-1; general
strategy vector-mediated antibody gene transfer applied other
difficult vaccine targets like hepatitis c virus, malaria, respiratory syncytial 
virus, tuberculosis. approach improvement classical passive
immunization strategies administer antibody proteins host provide 
protection infection. vector-mediated gene transfer, antibody gene 
is delivered host, via recombinant adeno-associated virus (raav) vector;
this turn results long-term endogenous antibody expression the
injected muscle confers protective immunity. vector-mediated antibody gene
transfer rapidly move existing, potent broadly cross-neutralizing
hiv-1-specific antibodies clinic. gene transfer products demonstrate
a potency breadth identical original product. strategy eliminates
the need immunogen design interaction adaptive immune system 
generate protection, strategy far shown limited promise.
