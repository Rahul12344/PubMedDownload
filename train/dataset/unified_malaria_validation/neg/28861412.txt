malaria real constant danger nearly half world's population of
7.4 billion people. 2015, 212 million cases reported along 429,000
estimated deaths. world health organization recommends artemisinin-based
combinatorial therapies, artemisinin purpose mainly isolated 
from plant artemisia annua. however, plant supply artemisinin is
irregular, leading fluctuation prices. here, report development a
simple, sustainable, scalable production platform artemisinin. five
genes involved artemisinin biosynthesis engineered moss
physcomitrella patens via direct vivo assembly multiple dna fragments. in
vivo biosynthesis artemisinin obtained without modifications. a
high initial production 0.21 mg/g dry weight artemisinin observed after
only 3 days cultivation. study shows p. patens sustainable
and efficient production platform artemisinin without further
modifications allow industrial-scale production. stable supply of
artemisinin lower price artemisinin-based treatments, hence become
more affordable lower income communities affected malaria; an
important step toward containment deadly disease threatening millions
every year.
