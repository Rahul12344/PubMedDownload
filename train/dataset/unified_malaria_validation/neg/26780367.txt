regulatory roles cdks fundamental processes including cell cycle
progression transcription well conserved metazoans. family of
proteins undergone significant evolutionary divergence specialization.
several cdk-like kinases identified characterized parasitic
protozoans. however, clear functional role physiological relevance these
proteins protozoans still remain elusive. continuation recent
finding cdk-like protein pfpk5 regulates important dna replication protein
like origin recognition complex subunit 1 plasmodium falciparum, 
discussed emerging significance cdk1/2 homologs dna replication of
parasitic protozoans. fact, involvement proteins crucial cellular 
processes projects potential drug targets. possibilities cdks
offer potential therapeutic targets controlling parasite progression have
also explored.
