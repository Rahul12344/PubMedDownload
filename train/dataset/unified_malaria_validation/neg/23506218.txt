background: development spread plasmodium falciparum resistance to
artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) constitutes major threat recent 
global malaria control achievements. surveillance molecular markers could act 
as early warning system act-resistance clinical treatment failures
are apparent. aim study analyse temporal trends established
genotypes associated artemether-lumefantrine tolerance/resistance and
after deployment first-line treatment uncomplicated malaria in
tanzania 2006.
methods: single nucleotide polymorphisms p. falciparum multidrug
resistance gene 1 (pfmdr1) n86y, y184f, d1246y p. falciparum chloroquine
transporter gene (pfcrt) k76t analysed dried blood spots collected
during six consecutive studies children uncomplicated p. falciparum
malaria fukayosi village, bagamoyo district, tanzania, 2004-2011.
results: statistically significant yearly increase pfmdr1 n86,
184f, d1246 pfcrt k76 2006-2011 14% 61% (yearly = 1.38
[95% ci 1.25-1.52] p < 0.0001), 14% 35% (or = 1.17 [95% ci 1.07-1.30] p =
0.001), 54% 85% (or = 1.21 [95% ci 1.03-1.42] p = 0.016) 49% 85% (or = 
1.33 [95% ci 1.17-1.51] p < 0.0001), respectively. unlike pfmdr1 snp, a
significant increase pfcrt k76 observed already 2004-2006, from
26% 49% (or = 1.68 [95% ci 1.17-2.40] p = 0.005). 2006 2011 pfmdr1
nfd haplotype increased 10% 37% (or = 1.25 [95% ci 1.12-1.39] p <
0.0001), whereas yyy haplotype decreased 31% 6% (or = 0.73 [95% ci
0.56-0.98] p = 0.018). 390 successfully analysed samples one copy 
pfmdr1 gene.
conclusion: temporal selection molecular markers associated with
artemether-lumefantrine tolerance/resistance may represent early warning sign 
of impaired future drug efficacy. calls stringent surveillance of
artemether-lumefantrine efficacy tanzania emphasizes importance of
molecular surveillance complement standard vivo trials.
