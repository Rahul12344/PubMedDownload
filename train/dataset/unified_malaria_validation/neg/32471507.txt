background: multicopy var gene family plasmodium falciparum crucial 
importance pathogenesis antigenic variation. far var2csa, var
gene responsible placental malaria, found highly conserved among
all p. falciparum strains. here, new conserved 3d7 var gene (pf3d7_0617400) 
identified several field isolates.
methods: dna sequencing, transcriptional analysis, cluster differentiation
(cd) 36-receptor binding, indirect immunofluorescence with
pf3d7_0617400-antibodies quantification surface reactivity against
semi-immune sera used characterize nf54 clone gabonese field
isolate clone (moa c3) transcribing gene. population 714 whole genome
sequenced parasites analysed characterize conservation locus in
african asian isolates. genetic diversity two var2csa fragments was
compared genetic diversity 57 microsatellites fragments field
isolates.
results: pfga01_060022400 identified gabonese parasite isolate (moa)
from chronic infection found 99% identical pf3d7_0617400 
3d7 genome strain. transcriptional analysis immunofluorescence showed
expression gene nf54 moa clone cd36 binding assays and
surface reactivity semi-immune sera differed markedly two clones.
long-read pacific bioscience whole genome sequencing showed pfga01_060022400
is located internal cluster chromosome 6. full length
pfga01_060022400 detected 36 714 p. falciparum isolates 500 bp
fragments identified 100 isolates. var2csa parts highly 
conserved (he = 0) parts variable (he = 0.86) 57
microsatellites markers (he = 0.8).
conclusions: individual var gene sequences exhibit conservation global
parasite population suggesting purifying selection may limit overall genetic
diversity var genes. notably, field laboratory isolates expressing
the var gene exhibit markedly different phenotypes.
