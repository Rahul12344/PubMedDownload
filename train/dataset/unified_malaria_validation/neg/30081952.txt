background: apicomplexan parasite babesia orientalis, causative agent 
water buffalo babesiosis china, widespread central south china,
resulting huge economic loss annually. currently, effective
vaccine drug disease. babesia bovis plasmodium falciparum
were reported possess apicoplast contains methylerythritol
phosphate (mep) pathway inhibitable fosmidomycin, suggesting pathway 
could serve drug target screening new drugs. however, remains unknown
in b. orientalis.
methods: primers designed according seven mep pathway genes of
babesia microti babesia bovis. genes cloned, sequenced analyzed.
the open reading frames (orfs) first two enzyme genes, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 
5-phosphate synthase (bodxs) 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase 
(bodxr), cloned pet-32a expression vector expressed a
trx-tag fusion protein. rabbit anti-rbodxs rabbit anti-rbodxr antibodies were
generated. western blot performed identify native proteins bodxs
and bodxr b. orientalis. fosmidomycin geranylgeraniol used for
inhibition assay rescue assay, respectively, vitro cultivation of
b. orientalis.
results: seven enzyme genes b. orientalis mep pathway (dxs, dxr, ispd,
ispe, ispf, ispg isph) cloned sequenced, full length 2094,
1554, 1344, 1521, 654, 1932 1056 bp, respectively. bodxs bodxr were
expressed trx-tag fusion proteins, size 95 67 kda, respectively.
western blot identified 77 kda band native bodxs 49 kda band 
the native bodxr. drug assay results showed fosmidomycin could inhibit
the growth b. orientalis, geranylgeraniol could reverse effect of
fosmidomycin.
conclusions: babesia orientalis isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway, which
could potential drug target controlling curing babesiosis.
considering high price instability fosmidomycin, studies
should focus screening stable cheap drugs.
