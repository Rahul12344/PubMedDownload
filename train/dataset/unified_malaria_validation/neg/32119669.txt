approximately one-third global population risk plasmodium vivax
infection, estimated 7.51 million cases reported 2017. although,
p. vivax research currently limited lack robust continuous in
vitro culture system parasite, recent work optimizing short-term ex vivo
culture p. vivax cryopreserved isolates facilitated quantitative
assays synchronous parasites. pairing improved culture system with
low-input smart-seq2 rnaseq library preparation, sought determine whether
transcriptional profiling p. vivax would provide insight differential
survival parasites different culture media. end probed the
transcriptional signature three different ex vivo p. vivax samples four
different culture media using 1000 cells time point taken during
the course intraerythrocytic development cycle (idc). using strategy,
we achieved similar quality transcriptional data previously reported p. vivax 
transcriptomes. found little effect varying culture media parasite
transcriptional signatures, identified many novel gametocyte-specific genes 
transcriptomes facs-isolated gametocytes, determined invasion ligand
expression schizonts biological isolates across idc. total,
these data demonstrate feasibility utility p. vivax rnaseq-based
transcriptomic studies using minimal biomass input maximize experimental
capacity.
