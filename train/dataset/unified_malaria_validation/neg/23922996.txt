acquired immunity plasmodium falciparum infection causes change from
frequent, sometimes life-threatening, malaria young children asymptomatic, 
chronic infections older children adults. little known this
transition occurs antibodies extremely diverse pfemp1 parasite
antigens thought play role. pfemp1 encoded family 60 var
genes undergo clonal antigenic variation, potentially creating an
antigenically heterogeneous infecting population parasites within host.
previous theoretical work suggests antibodies pfemp1 may play role in
"orchestrating" expression within infections leading sequential,
homogeneous expression var genes, prolonged infection chronicity. here,
using cloning sequencing approach compare var expression homogeneity
(veh) isolates children asymptomatic clinical infections.
we show asymptomatic infections higher veh clinical infections and
a broader host antibody response. discuss relation potential
role host antibodies promoting chronicity infection parasite
survival low transmission season.
