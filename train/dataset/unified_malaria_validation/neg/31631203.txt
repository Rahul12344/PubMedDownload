malaria continues major concern developing countries despite
continuous efforts find cure disease. understanding pathogenesis
mechanism necessary identify effective drug targets malaria.
many years experimental research generated large amount data the
malarial parasite, plasmodium falciparum. data useful understand the
importance certain parasite proteins, often remains unclear these
proteins come together, interact proteins carry their
function. identification proteins involved pathogenesis important
step towards understanding molecular mechanism pathogenesis. this
study, dynamic stage-specific protein-protein interaction networks created
based gene expression data parasite's intra-erythrocytic stages and
static protein-protein interaction data. using previously known proteins a
biological event seed proteins, random walk restart (rwr) method 
used dynamic protein-protein interaction networks identify novel
proteins related event. two screening procedures namely, permutation test
and go enrichment test performed increase reliability rwr
predictions. proposed method first validated plasmodium falciparum
proteins related invasion, could reproduce existing knowledge
from small set seed proteins. used identify novel maurer's
clefts resident proteins, could identify 152 parasite proteins. show 
that current approach annotate conserved proteins unknown function. 
the predicted proteins help build mechanistic model disease
pathogenesis, useful identifying new drug targets.
