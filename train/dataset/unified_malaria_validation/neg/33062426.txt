the proteome malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum notable the
pervasive occurrence homopeptides low-complexity regions (i.e., regions
that made small subset amino-acid residue types). most
prevalent made residues encoded adenine/thymidine (at)-rich 
codons, particular asparagine. examined homopeptide occurrences within
protein domains p. falciparum. homopeptide enrichments occur hydrophobic
(e.g., valine), small residues (alanine glycine) short spans (<5
residues), enrichments disappear longer lengths. observe that
short asparagine homopeptides (<10 residues long) dramatic relative
depletion inside protein domains, indicating selective constraint keep
them forming. surmise possibly linked co-translational
protein folding, although specific protein domains enriched in
longer asparagine homopeptides (≥10 residues) indicating functional linkage for
specific poly-asparagine tracts. top gene ontology functional category
enrichments homopeptides associated diverse protein domains include
"vesicle-mediated transport", "dna-directed 5'-3' rna polymerase activity",
with various categories linked "binding" evidencing significant homopeptide
depletions. also, general homopeptides substantially enriched parts
of protein domains near/in idrs. implications findings 
discussed.
