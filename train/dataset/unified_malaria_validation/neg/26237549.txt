purpose review: emergence artemisinin resistance southeast asia
(sea), artemisinin combination therapies (acts) beginning fail,
threatens global endeavors control eliminate plasmodium falciparum
malaria. future efforts prevent spread calamity africa will
benefit last year's tremendous progress understanding artemisinin
resistance.
recent findings: multiple international collaborations established that
artemisinin resistance associated slow parasite clearance patients,
increased survival early-ring-stage parasites vitro, single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps) parasite's kelch protein gene (k13), parasite
'founder' populations sharing genetic background four additional snps,
parasite transcriptional profiles reflecting 'unfolded protein response' and
decelerated parasite development, elevated parasite
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase activity. western cambodia, k13 c580y 
mutation approaching fixation, frontline act failing cure nearly
half patients, likely due partner drug resistance. africa, dozens 
of k13 mutations detected low frequency, evidence yet of
artemisinin resistance.
summary: sea, clinical epidemiological investigations urgently needed 
to stop spread artemisinin resistance, monitor efficacy of
acts k13 mutations prevalent, identify currently-available drug
regimens cure act failures, rapidly advance new antimalarial compounds
through preclinical studies clinical trials.
