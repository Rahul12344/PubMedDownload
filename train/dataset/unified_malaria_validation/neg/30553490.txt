anopheles genus mosquitoes transmit human malaria and
consequently focus large scale genome transcriptome-wide association
studies. genetic tools define function candidate genes arising from
these analyses vital. moreover, genome editing offers potential modify
anopheles population structure local global scale provide complementary
tools towards ultimate goal malaria elimination. major breakthroughs in
anopheles genetic analysis came development germline transformation
and rna interference technology. yet, field revolutionised 
precise genome editing possible site-specific nucleases. we
review components current genetic toolkit available study
anopheles, focusing particularly technical advances used gain
insight malaria transmission design genetic methods control
anopheles vectors.
