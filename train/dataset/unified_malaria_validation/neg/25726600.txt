objective: identify analyze plasmodium ovale wallikeri 5 imported
malaria cases, detected positive microscopy negative by
conventional pcr.
methods: epidemiological information blood samples collected the
five patients. detection conducted microscopy, rapid diagnostic test
(rdt) nested pcr plasmodium genus-specific, species-specific and
plasmodium ovale wallikeri-specific primers. amplified products were
sequenced blast analysis performed line ncbi.
results: five patients returned africa, history of
malaria. microscopically positive plasmodium sp., two cases
showed pan positive rdt result. blood samples negative four
plasmodium spp. conventional nested pcr, positive nested pcr with
plasmodium ovale wallikeri-specific primers. blast analysis showed the
amplified sequences five cases complete homology p. ovale
wallikeri clone rsh10 18s ribosomal rna gene (accession no. kf219561.1).
conclusion: five cases classified positive microscopy while
negative conventional pcr confirmed plasmodium ovale wallikeri
infection nested pcr p. ovale wallikeri-specific primers.
