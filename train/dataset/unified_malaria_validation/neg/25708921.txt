xpd helicase, tfiih subunit, essential several processes including
transcription, ner, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis eukaryotes. another
component tfiih, namely p44, among well-known interacting partners of
xpd vital regulating helicase activities latter. however, none
of aboveÂ mentioned proteins functionally characterized in
plasmodium falciparum. consequently, study, performed detailed studies
on xpd interacting partner, p44, p. falciparum 3d7 strain.
accordingly, expressed purified recombinant pfxpd fragments and
pfp44 proteins characterized enzymatic activities pfxpd its
fragments. vivo stage-specific expression subcellular localizations of
pfxpd pfp44 proteins studied using specific antibodies the
intraerythrocytic developmental stages p. falciparum 3d7 strain. results
suggest pfxpd displays characteristic ssdna-dependent atpase 5'-3'
dna helicase activities. also report existence two high molecular
weight forms p44 p. falciparum 3d7 strain. pfxpd pfp44 colocalize 
in nucleus interact other, suggest most
likely components complex apparently, tfiih. furthermore, during
trophozoite schizont stages, proteins exhibit distinct cytoplasmic
distribution pattern implies pfxpd pfp44 might also involved in
other functions. studies aid understanding basic biology of
malaria parasite.
