apical membrane antigen 1 (ama-1) leading blood-stage malaria vaccine
candidate. consistent key role erythrocytic invasion, ama-1-specific
antibodies implicated ama-1-induced protective immunity. ama-1 is
also expressed sporozoites mature liver schizonts may a
target protective cell-mediated immunity. here, demonstrate first
time immunization ama-1 induce sterile infection-blocking immunity 
against plasmodium sporozoite challenge 80% immunized mice. significantly
higher levels gamma interferon (ifn-Î³)/interleukin-2 (il-2)/tumor necrosis
factor (tnf) multifunctional cells noted immunized mice control
mice. also report first identification minimal cd8(+) cd4(+) cell
epitopes plasmodium yoelii ama-1. data establish ama-1 target of
both preerythrocytic- erythrocytic-stage protective immune responses and
validate vaccine approaches designed induce cellular humoral
immunity.
