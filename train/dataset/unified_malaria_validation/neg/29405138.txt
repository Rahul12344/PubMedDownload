background: antimalarial drug resistance potential threat control and
elimination malaria. ascertain status antimalarial drug resistance
at study sites, correlation vitro drug sensitivity pattern and
drug resistance molecular markers plasmodium falciparum malaria was
undertaken.
materials methods: polymorphisms p. falciparum chloroquine resistance
transporter (pfcrt) k76t pfmdr1 n86y studied relation vitro
susceptibility p. falciparum culture (n = 10) field isolates (n = 40)
to chloroquine (cq), amodiaquine (aq), quinine (qn), mefloquine (mq) and
artemisinin (art). prevalence drug resistance molecular markers, pfdhfr
(codon s108n, c59r, n51i, i164 l a16v), pfdhps (codon s436f a437g),
pfatpase6 (codon d639g e431k) mutation propeller domain pfk13
gene also analysed. chi-square test parametric pearson correlation test 
were performed using spss version 17.
results: vitro assay showed 18% resistance cq, 8% aq 4% qn.
however, resistance observed towards mq art. mutations pfcrt
and pfmdr1 statistically significantly associated susceptibility
responses antimalarials; however, increased ic50values drugs were
reflected mutant and/or mixed isolates gene polymorphisms. cq was
found independent predictor antimalarials, i.e., aq, qn art,
with r2 score 0.241, 0.241 0.091, respectively. mutation pfatpase6
gene codon e431k observed one sample tripura also had
increased ic50value 6.28 nm. however, moderate numbers mutations codon
s108n, c59r i164 l pfdhfr gene s436f a437g pfdhps gene were
also observed. none samples showed mutation propeller domain pfk13
gene.
conclusion: correlation ic50and molecular markers antimalarial
drug resistance reported first time study. positive
correlation vitro drug resistance molecular markers for
antimalarial drug resistance could make vitro assay reliable tool predict
drug efficacy needed detection emerging resistance the
country.
