insecticide resistance genes often associated pleiotropic effects on
various mosquito life-history traits. however, little information is
available impact insecticide resistance blood feeding process in
mosquitoes. here, using two recently detected dna-based metabolic markers 
major malaria vector, an. funestus, investigated metabolic resistance
genes could affect blood meal intake. allowing field f1 and
lab f8 anopheles funestus strains feed human arm 30 minutes, we
assessed association key parameters blood meal process including, 
probing time, feeding duration, blood feeding success, blood meal size, and
markers glutathione s-transferase (l119f-gste2) cytochrome p450
(cyp6p9a_r)-mediated metabolic resistance. none parameters blood meal
process associated l119f-gste2 genotypes. contrast, cyp6p9a_r,
homozygous resistant mosquitoes significantly able blood-feed than
homozygous susceptible (or = 3.3; ci 95%: 1.4-7.7; p = 0.01) mosquitoes.
moreover, volume blood meal ingested cyp6p9a-ss mosquitoes lower
than cyp6p9a-rs (p<0.004) cyp6p9a-rr (p<0.006). suggests that
cyp6p9a gene inked feeding success blood meal size an.
funestus. however, correlation found expression cyp6p9a that
of genes encoding salivary proteins involved blood meal process. this
study suggests p450-based metabolic resistance may influence blood
feeding process anopheles funestus mosquito consequently ability to
transmit malaria parasites.
