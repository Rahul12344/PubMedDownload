several studies shown efficacy intermittent preventive treatment 
(ipt) using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) coupled expanded program of
immunization (epi) infants. however, adoption strategy conditioned
by long-term efficacy sp. impact ipt-sp coupled epi the
prevalence markers resistance sp evaluated study
conducted southern senegal. three cross-sectional surveys two health
districts (ipt+) conducted prior implementation, 1 year, 2 years 
after. third district located two districts served test zone
(ipt-). pcr tests carried filter papers collected children under
five two first measures positive rapid diagnostic tests the
same population third measure. mutations codons 51, 59, 108 the
dhfr gene codons 437 540 dhps analyzed. results showed
that prevalence dhfr triple mutation frequent 2 years in
ipt+ areas. regarding quadruple mutation, dhfr (51, 59, 108) dhps (437), 
no difference noted two areas. quintuple mutation not
observed 2 years implementation areas. however, individual
analysis showed significant differences individual mutation points 51, 59,
108, 437. study reveals despite increase prevalence of
individual mutations, ipt-sp coupled epi major impact dhfr
and dhps combined mutations.
