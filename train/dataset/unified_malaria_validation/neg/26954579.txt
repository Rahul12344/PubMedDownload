plasmodium vivax wide spread neglected malaria parasite. a
lack information parasite biology species. genome parasite 
encodes largest number tryptophan-rich proteins belonging to
'pv-fam-a' family potential drug/vaccine targets their
functional role(s) largely remains unexplored. using bacterial yeast two
hybrid systems, identified interacting partners two p.
vivax tryptophan-rich antigens called pvtrag36.6 pvtrag56.2. pvtrag36.6
interacts early transcribed membrane protein (etramp) p.vivax. is
apically localized merozoites early stages seen parasite
periphery suggesting likely involvement parasitophorous vacuole membrane
(pvm) development maintenance. hand, pvtrag56.2 interacts with
p.vivax merozoite surface protein7 (pvmsp7) localized merozoite
surface. co-localization pvtrag56.2 pvmsp1 molecular interaction 
with pvmsp7 probably suggest that, pvtrag56.2 part msp-complex, might
assist stabilize protein complex merozoite surface. conclusion, 
the pvtrag proteins different sub cellular localizations specific
associated functions intra-erythrocytic developmental cycle.
