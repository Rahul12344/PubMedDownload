cryptosporidium apicomplexan parasite causes disease
cryptosporidiosis humans, livestock, vertebrates. much the
knowledge cryptosporidium diversity derived 18s rrna gene (18s rdna)
phylogenies. eukaryote genomes generally multiple 18s rdna copies that
evolve concert, necessary accurate inference phylogenetic 
relationships. however, 18s rdna copies genomes evolve a
birth-and-death process result sequence divergence among copies. most
notably, divergent 18s rdna paralogs apicomplexan plasmodium share only
89-95% sequence similarity, encode structurally distinct rrna molecules, 
expressed different life cycle stages. present study, cryptosporidium
18s rdna amplified 28/72 (38.9%) eastern chipmunks (tamias striatus).
phylogenetic analyses showed co-occurrence two 18s rdna types, type 
type b, 26 chipmunks, type b clustered sequence previously
identified cryptosporidium chipmunk genotype ii. types b sister
group relationship shared less 93% sequence similarity. contrast,
actin heat shock protein 70 gene sequences homogeneous samples with
both types b present. therefore concluded types b are
divergent 18s rdna paralogs cryptosporidium chipmunk genotype ii. substitution
patterns types b consistent functionally constrained
evolution; however, type b evolved rapidly type higher g+c 
content (46.3% versus 41.0%). oocysts cryptosporidium chipmunk genotype ii
measured 4.17 μm (3.73-5.04 μm) × 3.94 μm (3.50-4.98 μm) length-to-width
ratio 1.06 ± 0.06 μm, infection occurred naturally jejunum, cecum, 
and colon eastern chipmunks. findings study implications 
the use 18s rdna sequences infer phylogenetic relationships.
