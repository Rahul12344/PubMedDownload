identification inter-individual variability drug metabolism through
cytochrome p450 2b6 (cyp2b6) enzyme important understanding the
differences clinical responses malaria hiv. study evaluates the
distribution cyp2b6 alleles, haplotypes inferred metabolic phenotypes
among subjects different ethnicity botswana. total 570 subjects were
analyzed cyp2b6 polymorphisms position 516 g > t (rs3745274), 785 a > g
(rs2279343) 983 t > c (rs28399499). samples collected three districts
of botswana population belongs bantu (serowe/palapye chobe) 
san-related (ghanzi) ethnicity. three districts showed different haplotype
composition according ethnic background similar metabolic inferred
phenotypes, 59.12%, 34.56%, 2.10% 4.21% subjects having,
respectively, extensive, intermediate, slow rapid metabolic profile. the
results hint possibility convergent adaptation detoxifying
metabolic phenotypes despite different haplotype structure due different
genetic background. main implication that, substantial
homogeneity metabolic inferred phenotypes among country, response to
drugs metabolized via cyp2b6 could individually associated increased
risk treatment failure toxicity. important facts since botswana 
is facing malaria elimination high hiv prevalence.
