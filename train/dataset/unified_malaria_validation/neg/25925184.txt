genetic polymorphisms pvdhfr pvdhps genes plasmodium vivax were
investigated 83 blood samples collected patients philippines,
bangladesh, nepal. snp-haplotypes pvdhfr gene amino acid
positions 13, 33, 57, 58, 61, 117, 173, pvdhps gene the
positions 383 553 analyzed nested pcr-rflp. results suggest diverse
polymorphic patterns pvdhfr alone well combination patterns with
pvdhps mutant alleles p. vivax isolates collected 3 endemic countries
in asia. samples carried mutant combination alleles pvdhfr pvdhps. the
most prevalent combination alleles found samples philippines and
bangladesh triple mutant pvdhfr combined single mutant pvdhps allele
and triple mutant pvdhfr combined double wild-type pvdhps alleles,
respectively. collected nepal quadruple mutant pvdhfr combined
with double wild-type pvdhps alleles. new alternative antifolate drugs 
effective sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp)-resistant p. vivax required.
