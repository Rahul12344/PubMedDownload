chitin-metabolizing products high industrial relevance current scenario
due wide biological applications, relatively lower cost, greater
abundance, sustainable supply. chitooligosaccharides remarkably wide
spectrum applications therapeutics antitumor agents,
immunomodulators, drug delivery, gene therapy, wound dressings, chitinase
inhibitors prevent malaria. hypocholesterolemic antimicrobial activities
of chitooligosaccharides make molecule choice food industry, and
their functional profile depends physicochemical characteristics.
recently, chitin-based nanomaterials also gaining tremendous importance in
biomedical agricultural applications. crystallinity insolubility of
chitin imposes major hurdle way polymer utilization. chemical
production processes known produce chitooligosaccharides variable
degree polymerization properties along ecological concerns.
biological production routes mainly involve chitinases, chitosanases, and
chitin-binding proteins. development bio-catalytic production routes for
chitin enhance production commercially viable
chitooligosaccharides defined molecular properties also provide a
means combat marine pollution value addition.
