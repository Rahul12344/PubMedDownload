the var genes human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum present a
challenge population geneticists due extreme diversity, is
generated high rates recombination. genes encode primary antigen
protein called pfemp1, expressed surface infected red blood
cells elicits protective immune responses. var gene sequences are
characterized pronounced mosaicism, precluding use traditional
phylogenetic tools require bifurcating tree-like evolutionary relationships.
we present new method identifies highly variable regions (hvrs), 
maps hvr complex network sequence node two nodes
are linked share exact match significant length. here, networks 
var genes recombine freely expected uniformly random
structure, constraints recombination produce network communities that
we identify using stochastic block model. validate method synthetic 
data, showing correctly recovers populations constrained
recombination, applying duffy binding like-α (dblα) domain of
var genes. find nine hvrs whose network communities map distinctive ways to
known dblα classifications clinical phenotypes. show the
recombinational constraints hvrs correlated, others are
independent. findings suggest micromodular structuring
facilitates independent evolutionary trajectories neighboring mosaic regions, 
allowing parasite retain protein function generating enormous
sequence diversity. approach therefore offers rigorous method analyzing
evolutionary constraints var genes, also flexible enough easily
applied generally highly recombinant sequences.
