ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation within malarial parasites burgeoning
field interest due several encouraging reports proteasome inhibitors
that able confer antimalarial activity. despite growing interest in
the plasmodium proteasome system, relatively little investigation done
to actually characterize parasite degradation machinery. report, we
provide initial biological investigation ubiquitylating components of
the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (erad) system, major 
pathway targeting misfolded proteins er cytosol proteasome
degradation. able show erad system essential parasite
survival putative plasmodium hrd1 (e3 ubiquitin ligase), ubc (e2
ubiquitin conjugating enzyme) uba1 (e1 ubiquitin activating enzyme) able 
to mediate vitro ubiquitylation. furthermore, using immunofluorescence, 
report plasmodium hrd1 localizes er membranes, plasmodium
ubc uba1 localize cytosol. addition, gene disruption
experiments indicate plasmodium hrd1 likely essential. have
conducted initial characterization ubiquitylating components the
plasmodium erad system, major pathway protein degradation parasite
maintenance. conjunction promising proteasome inhibitor studies, we
explore possibility targeting plasmodium erad system future
bottom-up drug development approaches.
