the pathogens causing aids, malaria, tuberculosis proven complex 
be overcome classical approaches vaccination. complexities human
immunology pathogen-induced modulation immune system mandate new
approaches vaccine discovery design. new field, systems vaccinology,
weds holistic analysis innate adaptive immunity within quantitative
framework enable rational design new vaccines elicit tailored
protective immune responses. key step approach discover
relationships earliest innate inflammatory responses vaccination
and subsequent vaccine-induced adaptive immune responses efficacy.
analysis responses clinical studies complicated the
inaccessibility relevant tissue compartments (such lymph node),
necessitating reliance upon peripheral blood responses surrogates. blood
transcriptomes, although indirect vaccine mechanisms, proven very
informative systems vaccinology studies. approach powerful when
innate adaptive immune responses integrated vaccine efficacy, 
is possible malaria advent robust human challenge model. this
is difficult aids tuberculosis, given human challenge models
are lacking efficacy observed clinical trials low highly
variable. challenge met appropriate clinical trial design for
partially efficacious vaccines analysis natural infection cohorts.
ultimately, systems vaccinology iterative approach mechanistic
hypotheses-derived analysis clinical studies-are evaluated model
systems, used guide development new vaccine strategies. in
this review, illustrate facets systems vaccinology
approach case studies.
