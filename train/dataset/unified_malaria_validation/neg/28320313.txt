background: opsins light sensitive receptors associated visual
processes. insects typically possess opsins stimulated ultraviolet,
short long wavelength (lw) radiation. six putative lw-sensitive opsins
predicted yellow fever mosquito, aedes aegypti malaria mosquito,
anopheles gambiae, eight southern house mosquito, culex
quinquefasciatus, suggest gene expansion family culicidae (mosquitoes)
relative insects. report first detailed molecular and
evolutionary analyses lw opsins three mosquito vectors, goal to
understanding molecular basis opsin-mediated visual processes could
be exploited mosquito control.
results: time divergence estimates suggest mosquito lw opsins
originated 18 19 duplication events 166.9/197.5 1.07/0.94
million years ago (my) likely occurred following predicted
divergence lineages anophelinae culicinae 145-226 my. fitmodel
analyses identified nine amino acid residues lw opsins may under
positive selection. these, eight amino acids occur n c termini 
are shared among three species, one residue tmiii unique to
culicine species. alignment 5' non-coding regions revealed potential conserved
non-coding sequences (cns) transcription factor binding sites (tfbs) seven
pairs lw opsin paralogs.
conclusions: analyses suggest opsin gene duplication residues possibly
associated spectral tuning lw-sensitive photoreceptors. explore two
mechanisms - positive selection differential expression mediated by
regulatory units cns - may contributed retention lw opsin 
genes culicinae anophelinae. discuss evolution mosquito lw
opsins context major earth events possible adaptation mosquitoes
to lw-dominated photo environments, implications mosquito control
strategies based disrupting vision-mediated behaviors.
