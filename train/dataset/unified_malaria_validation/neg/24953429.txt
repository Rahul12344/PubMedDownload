cerebral malaria associated cerebrovascular damage neurological
sequelae. however, neurological consequences uncomplicated malaria, the
most prevalent form disease, remain uninvestigated. here, using mild
malaria model, show single plasmodium chabaudi adami infection adult
mice induces neuroinflammation, neurogenic, behavioral changes absence
of blood-brain barrier breach. using cytokine arrays show infection
induces differential serum brain cytokine profiles, peak parasitemia 
and 15days post-parasite clearance. peak infection, along the
serum, brain also exhibited definitive pro-inflammatory cytokine profile,
and gene expression analysis revealed pro-inflammatory cytokines also
produced locally hippocampus, adult neurogenic niche. hippocampal
microglia numbers enhanced, noted shift activated profile 
this time point, accompanied striking redistribution microglia the
subgranular zone adjacent hippocampal neuronal progenitors. the
hippocampus, distinct decline progenitor turnover survival observed 
at peak parasitemia, accompanied shift neuronal glial fate
specification. studies transgenic nestin-gfp reporter mice demonstrated a
decline nestin-gfp(+)/gfap(+) quiescent neural stem cell pool peak
parasitemia. although cellular changes reverted normal 15days
post-parasite clearance, specific brain cytokines continued exhibit
dysregulation. behavioral analysis revealed selective deficits social and
anxiety-like behaviors, change observed locomotor, cognitive, and
depression-like behaviors, return baseline recovery. collectively,
these findings indicate even single episode mild malaria results in
alterations brain cytokine profile, causes specific behavioral
dysfunction, accompanied hippocampal microglial activation and
redistribution, definitive, transient, suppression adult hippocampal
neurogenesis.
