placental malaria, characterized sequestration plasmodium falciparum the
maternal placental blood space associated inflammatory damage, contributes to
poor birth outcomes ~200,000 infant deaths annually. specific mechanisms that
contribute placental damage dysfunction malaria completely 
understood. investigate potential role oxidative stress, antioxidant
genes markers oxidative damage assessed quantitative pcr and
immunohistochemistry plasmodium chabaudi as-infected pregnant mice. widespread
evidence lipid peroxidation observed associated higher
antioxidant gene expression conceptuses infected mice. assess extent
to oxidative damage might contribute poor birth outcomes be
amenable therapeutic intervention, infected pregnant mice treated with
n-acetylcysteine, free radical scavenger, tempol, intracellular
superoxide dismutase mimetic. results show mice treated with
n-acetylcysteine experienced malaria induced-pregnancy loss rate as
control animals failed mitigate placental oxidative damage. contrast,
tempol-treated mice exhibited subtle improvement embryo survival gestation 
day 12. although lipid peroxidation consistently reduced placentas
of mice, inversely related embryo viability. moreover, reduced
ifn-Î³ ccl2 plasma levels treated mice associated midgestational 
embryo viability. thus, although oxidative stress remarkable placental
malaria mitigation antioxidant therapy may improve pregnancy outcomes,
the underlying mechanistic basis potential therapeutic strategies require
additional investigation.
