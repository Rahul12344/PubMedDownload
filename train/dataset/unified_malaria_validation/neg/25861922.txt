annotating understanding function proteins elements a
genome difficult absence well-studied evolutionarily close
relative. causative agent malaria, one oldest deadly
global infectious diseases, good example problem. burden of
malaria huge pressing need new, effective antimalarial
strategies. however, techniques homology-dependent annotation transfer
are severely impaired parasite well-understood close
relatives. circumvent approach developed network-based method that
uses heavy path network-mining algorithm. uncovered protein-protein
associations implicated important cellular processes including genome
integrity, dna repair, transcriptional regulation, invasion, pathogenesis,
thus demonstrating utility method. url source code for
