simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) infection leads aids experimentally
infected rhesus macaques similarly hiv-infected humans. contrast, siv
infection natural hosts characterized down-regulation innate acute 
responses virus within weeks infection results limited
pathology. chloroquine (cq) used treatment prevention of

here, treated rhesus macaques cq acute phase sivmac251
infection intent decrease viral-induced immune activation and
possibly limit disease progression. contrary expected, cq treatment
resulted temporary increased expression interferon (ifn)-stimulating
genes worsened recovery cd4(+) cells blood. findings
confirm recent results observed asymptomatic hiv-infected patients suggest
that cq provide obvious benefit absence antiretroviral
therapy.
