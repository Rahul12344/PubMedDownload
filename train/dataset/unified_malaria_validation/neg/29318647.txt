sub-saharan africa, 75% annual sca births occur many
comorbidities exist. realizing effectiveness across continents hydroxyurea
(reach, clinicaltrials.gov nct01966731) prospective, phase i/ii open-label
trial hydroxyurea designed evaluate feasibility, safety, benefits
of hydroxyurea treatment children sca four sub-saharan african
countries. following comprehensive training local research teams, reach was
approved local ethics committees achieved full enrollment ahead of
projections 635 participants enrolled 30-month period, despite half
of families living >12 km clinical site. enrollment, study
participants (age 5.4 ± 2.4 years) substantial morbidity, including history
of vaso-occlusive pain (98%), transfusion (68%), malaria (85%), stroke (6%). 
significant differences laboratory characteristics noted across sites,
with lower hemoglobin concentrations (p < .01) angola (7.2 ± 1.0 g/dl) the
drc (7.0 ± 0.9 g/dl) compared kenya (7.4 ± 1.1 g/dl) uganda (7.5 ± 1.1

of α-thalassemia (58.4% least single α-globin gene deletion) g6pd
deficiency (19.7% males 2.4% females) across sites. car β-globin
haplotype present 99% participants. full enrollment reach
confirms feasibility conducting high-quality sca research africa;
