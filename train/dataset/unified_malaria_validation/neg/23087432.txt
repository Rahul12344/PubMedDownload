background: tryptophan-rich antigens malarial parasites proposed 
be potential vaccine candidate antigens. plasmodium vivax contains the
largest number antigens, need evaluated immune
responses.
methods: recombinant proteins 15 p. vivax tryptophan-rich antigens (pvtrags)
were expressed, purified, used human humoral cellular immune
responses. genetic polymorphism 15 genes also determined among
clinical p. vivax isolates.
results: lymphocytes p. vivax exposed individuals expressed higher level
of cd69 15 pvtrags. antigens also activated large
population cd4(+) cells produced higher level intracellular il-2,
inf-Î³ il-4. although mixed th1 th2 response these
antigens, response biased toward th2. majority p. vivax patients 
(75.7%-100%, n = 33) produced igg antibodies antigens. of
these antigens showed conserved t- b-cell epitopes parasite
population.
conclusions: results suggest presence memory cells humans
against antigens generate faster specific immune responses to
minimize p. vivax infection. characterization pvtrags may
lead identification potential therapeutic target.
