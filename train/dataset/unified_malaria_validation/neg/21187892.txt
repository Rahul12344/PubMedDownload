epigenetic regulatory mechanisms enzymes promising targets for
malaria therapeutic intervention; however, epigenetic component gene
expression p. falciparum poorly understood. dynamic stable association
of epigenetic marks genomic features provides important clues their
function helps understand histone variants/modifications used 
indexing plasmodium epigenome. describe novel, linear amplification
method next-generation sequencing (ngs) allows unbiased analysis 
extremely at-rich plasmodium genome. used method high resolution,
genome-wide analysis histone h2a variant, h2a.z two histone h3 marks
throughout parasite intraerythrocytic development. unlike organisms,
h2a.z constant, ubiquitous feature euchromatic intergenic regions
throughout intraerythrocytic cycle. almost perfect colocalisation of
h2a.z h3k9ac h3k4me3 suggests marks preferentially
deposited h2a.z-containing nucleosomes. performing rna-seq 8
time-points, show acetylation h3k9 promoter regions correlates very
well transcriptional status whereas h3k4me3 appears have
stage-specific regulation, low early stages, peaking trophozoite
stage, closely follow changes gene expression. improved ngs
library preparation procedure provides foundation exploit malaria
epigenome detail. furthermore, findings place h2a.z cradle p.
falciparum epigenetic regulation stably defining intergenic regions and
providing platform dynamic assembly epigenetic transcription
related complexes.
