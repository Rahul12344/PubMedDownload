the complement-like protein thioester-containing protein 1 (tep1) hallmark
effector molecule plasmodium ookinetes malaria vector anopheles
gambiae. previously shown knockdown noncatalytic clip
domain serine protease clipa2 increased tep1-mediated killing rendering
mosquitoes resistant plasmodium, bacterial fungal infections. here,
clipa2 coimmunoprecipitation hemolymph beauveria bassiana-infected
mosquitoes followed mass spectrometry functional genetic analysis led to
the identification apolipophorin-ii/i gene, encoding two lipid carrier
proteins apo-i ii, novel negative regulator tep1-mediated immune
response mosquito systemic infections. apo-ii/i exhibits similar rnai
phenotype clipa2 mosquito bioassays characterized increased resistance
to b. bassiana escherichia coli infections. provide evidence this
enhanced resistance systemic infections tep1 dependent. interestingly,
silencing apo-ii/i clipa2 upregulated expression tep1 following
systemic infections e. coli b. bassiana c-jun n-terminal kinase
pathway-dependent manner. results suggest mosquito apo-ii/i plays an
important immune regulatory role systemic infections provide novel
insight functional interplay lipid metabolism immune gene
regulation.
