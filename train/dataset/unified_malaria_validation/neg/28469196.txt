malaria, caused plasmodium parasites, thought one strongest
selective forces shaped genome modern humans endemic in
europe recent times. due eradication around mid-twentieth century,
the potential selective history malaria european populations largely
unknown. here, screen 224 ancient european genomes upper palaeolithic
to post-roman period 22 malaria-resistant alleles twelve genes
described literature. none specific mutations malaria
resistance, like g6pd, hbb duffy blood group, detected
among available samples, many malaria-resistant alleles existed
well advent agriculture. detected statistically significant
differences ancient modern populations atp2b4, fcgr2b abo
genes found evidence selection il-10 atp2b4 genes. however is
unclear whether malaria causative agent, genes also
involved immunological challenges. results suggest the
selective force represented malaria relatively weak europe, fact that
could associated recent historical introduction severe malaria
pathogen.
