dead/dexh-box rna helicases catalyze folding remodeling rna molecules 
in prokaryotic eukaryotic cells, well many viruses. are
characterized presence helicase domain conserved motifs that
are essential atp binding hydrolysis, rna interaction, unwinding
activities. large families dead/dexh-box proteins described in
different organisms, role molecular processes involving rna,
from transcriptional regulation mrna decay, described. review
aims summarize current knowledge dead/dexh-box proteins selected 
protozoan nematode parasites medical importance worldwide, as
plasmodium falciparum, leishmania spp., trypanosoma spp., giardia lamblia,
entamoeba histolytica, brugia malayi. discuss functional
characterization several proteins attempt understand better the
molecular mechanisms involving rna pathogens. current data also
highlight dead/dexh-box rna helicases might represent feasible drug targets 
due vital role parasite growth development.
