as result widespread antimalarial drug resistance, african countries
with endemic malaria have, recent years, changed malaria treatment
policy. senegal, health authorities changed chloroquine (cq) a
combination sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) plus amodiaquine (aq) 2003.
since 2006, artemisinin combination therapies (acts) artemether-lumefantrine 
(al) artesunate plus amodiaquine (as/aq) adopted uncomplicated
malaria treatment. several years cq withdrawal, current study wished
to determine level cq resistance molecular level selected sites 
in senegal, scientific community interested using cq again.
finger prick blood samples collected plasmodium falciparum-positive
children age 10 years (n = 474) cross-sectional surveys
conducted two study sites senegal different malaria transmission
levels. one site central senegal, site southern
part country. samples analyzed single nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps) p. falciparum cq resistance transporter gene (pfcrt; 
codons 72-76) using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) sequence-specific
oligonucleotide probe (ssop) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and
real-time pcr methods. total, 72- 76-codon region pfcrt was
amplified 449 blood samples (94.7%; 285 164 samples central and
southern sites senegal, respectively). study areas, prevalence 
the pfcrt wild-type single cvmnk haplotype high; central senegal, the
prevalence 70.5% 2009 74.8% 2010, southern senegal, the
prevalence 65.4% 2010 71.0% 2011. comparing data older studies
in senegal, sharp decline mutant type pfcrt prevalence evident: 
65%, 64%, 59.5% samples collected various sites 2000, 2001, and
2004 approximately 30% study. similar decrease mutant type
prevalence noted neighboring countries. continued
development increased cq susceptibility many african countries, may be
possible reintroduce cq near future drug combination; could
possibly given non-vulnerable groups, demands close monitoring of
possible reemergence cq resistance development.
