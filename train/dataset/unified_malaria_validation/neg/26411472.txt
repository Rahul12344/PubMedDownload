resistance individuals.

big-data-based edge biomarker new concept characterize disease features
based biomedical big data dynamical network manner, also
provides alternative strategies indicate disease status single samples.
this article gives comprehensive review big-data-based edge biomarkers for
complex diseases individual patient, defined biomarkers based 
on network information high-dimensional data. specifically, firstly
introduce sources structures biomedical big data accessible public 
for edge biomarker disease study. show biomedical big data are
typically 'small-sample size high-dimension space', i.e. small samples but
with high dimensions features (e.g. omics data) individual, in
contrast traditional big data many fields characterized as
'large-sample size low-dimension space', i.e. big samples low
dimensions features. then, demonstrate concept, model algorithm for
edge biomarkers big-data-based edge biomarkers. dissimilar to
conventional biomarkers, edge biomarkers, e.g. module biomarkers module
network rewiring-analysis, able predict disease state learning
differential associations molecules rather differential expressions 
of molecules disease progression treatment individual patients. in
particular, contrast using information common molecules edges
(i.e.molecule-pairs) across population traditional biomarkers including
network edge biomarkers, big-data-based edge biomarkers specific each
individual thus accurately evaluate disease state considering 
individual heterogeneity. therefore, measurement big data a
high-dimensional space required learning process also in
the diagnosing predicting process tested individual. finally, we
provide case study analyzing temporal expression data malaria
vaccine trial big-data-based edge biomarkers module network
rewiring-analysis. illustrative results show identified module
biomarkers accurately distinguish vaccines without protection and
outperformed previous reported gene signatures terms effectiveness and
efficiency.
