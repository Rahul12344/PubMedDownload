background: previously reported free heme generated during
experimental cerebral malaria (ecm) mice, central pathogenesis of
fatal ecm. heme-induced up-regulation stat3 cxcl10 promotes whereas
up-regulation ho-1 prevents brain tissue damage ecm. previously
demonstrated heme involved induction apoptosis vascular
endothelial cells. present study, tested hypothesis that
heme reduces blood-brain barrier integrity ecm induction apoptosis
of brain vascular endothelial cells stat3 target gene matrix
metalloproteinase three (mmp3) signaling.
methods: genes associated jak/stat3 signaling pathway induced upon
stimulation heme treatment, assessed using real time rt(2) profile pcr
arrays. human mmp3 promoter cloned luciferase reporter plasmid,
pmmp3, activity examined following exposure heme treatment a
luciferase reporter gene assay. order determine whether activated nuclear
protein stat3 binds mmp3 promoter regulates mmp3 gene, conducted 
chip analysis using heme-treated untreated human brain microvascular
endothelial cells (hbvec), determined mrna protein expression levels of
mmp3 using qrt-pcr western blot. apoptosis hbvec treated heme was
evaluated mtt tunel assay.
results: results show (1) heme activates variety jak/stat3
downstream pathways hbvec. stat3 targeted genes mmp3 c/ebpb
(apoptosis-related genes), regulated hbvec treated heme. (2)
heme-induced hbvec apoptosis via activation stat3 well downstream
signaling molecule mmp3 upregulation cxcl10 ho-1 expressions. (3)
phosphorylated stat3 binds mmp3 promoter hbvec cells, stat3 transcribed
mmp3 induced mmp3 protein expression hbvec cells.
conclusions: activated stat3 binds mmp3 promoter region regulates mmp3
in heme-induced endothelial cell apoptosis.
