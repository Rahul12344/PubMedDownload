although several studies supported sickle cell trait (hbas) protects
against falciparum malaria, exact mechanism sickle gene confers
protection unclear. further, information influence the
sickle gene parasitic diversity p. falciparum population severe
symptomatic malaria. study undertaken assess effect sickle
gene parasite densities diversities hospitalized adult patients
with severe falciparum malaria. study carried 166 adults
hospitalized subjects severe falciparum malaria sickle cell clinic and
molecular biology laboratory, veer surendra sai institute medical sciences and
research, burla, odisha, india. divided three groups basis 
of hemoglobin variants hbaa (n=104), hbas (n=30) hbss (n=32). msp-1 loci 
were genotyped using pcr-based methodology. parasite densities were
significantly high hbaa compared hbas hbss. multiplicity of
infection (moi) multi-clonality msp-1 significantly low hbss 
hbas compared hbaa. prevalence k1 (p<0 .0001) mad20 (p=0.0003)
alleles significantly high hbaa. ro33 allele detected higher
frequency hbss hbas, compared k1 mad20. sickle gene found to
reduce parasite densities diversity p. falciparum adults 
severe malaria.
