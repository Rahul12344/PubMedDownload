background: plasmodium falciparum malaria resistant chloroquine and
pyrimethamine originated limited foci migrated africa. remains
unresolved whether p. falciparum resistance sulfadoxine, conferred by
mutations dihydropteroate synthase (dhps), evolved following similar
pattern.
methods: dhps locus 893 p. falciparum isolates 12 countries asia, 
the pacific islands, africa, south america sequenced. haplotypes 6
microsatellite loci flanking dhps locus determined define genetic
relationships among sulfadoxine-resistant lineages.
results: six distinct sulfadoxine-resistant lineages identified. highly
resistant lineages appear originated southeast asia south
america. two resistant lineages found throughout southeast asia been
introduced east africa, appear spread.
conclusions: infrequent selection parasites highly resistant to
sulfadoxine subsequent migration resistant lineages asia to
africa similar patterns observed chloroquine pyrimethamine
resistance. findings strongly suggest global migration of
resistant parasites played decisive role establishment of
drug-resistant p. falciparum parasites, similar patterns may be
anticipated spread artemisinin resistance.
