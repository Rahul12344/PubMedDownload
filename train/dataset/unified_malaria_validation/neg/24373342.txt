background: antibodies essential role acquired immune response
against blood stage p. falciparum infection. although several antigens 
identified important antibody targets, still elusive antigens have
to recognized clinical protection. herein, analyzed antibodies from
plasmas symptomatic asymptomatic individuals living same
geographic area western amazon, measuring recognition multiple
merozoite antigens.
methods: specific fragments genes encoding merozoite proteins ama1 members
of msp ebl families circulating p. falciparum field isolates present 
asymptomatic symptomatic patients amplified pcr. cloning and
expression different versions antigens recombinant gst-fusion
peptides, tested reactivity patients' plasmas elisa presence
of igg subclasses reactive plasmas.
results: 11 24 recombinant antigens recognized plasmas either
symptomatic asymptomatic infections. antibodies msp9
(x2(df=1) = 9.26/p = 0.0047) msp5 (x2(df=1) = 8.29/p = 0.0069) more
prevalent asymptomatic individuals whereas opposite observed msp1 
block 2-mad20 (x2(df=1) = 6.41/p = 0.0206, fisher's exact test). plasmas from
asymptomatic individuals reacted intensely msp4 (u = 210.5,
p < 0.03), msp5 (u = 212, p < 0.004), msp9 (u = 189.5, p < 0.002) eba175
(u = 197, p < 0.014, mann-whitney's u test). igg1 igg3 predominant for
all antigens, patients also presented igg2 igg4. the
recognition msp5 (or = 0.112, ic95% = 0.021-0.585) msp9 (or = 0.125,
ic95% = 0.030-0.529, cross tab analysis) predicted 8.9 8 times less chances, 
respectively, present symptoms. higher antibody levels msp5 eba175
were associated odds ratios 9.4 (ic95% = 1.29-69.25) 5.7
(ic95% = 1.12-29.62, logistic regression), respectively, asymptomatic
status.
conclusions: merozoite antigens targets cytophilic antibodies and
antibodies msp5, msp9 eba175 independently associated with
decreased symptoms.
