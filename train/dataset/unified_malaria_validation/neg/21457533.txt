background: sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) chloroquine (cq) used
in treatment falciparum vivax malaria nepal. recently, resistance to
both drugs necessitated change towards artemisinin combination therapy
(act) plasmodium falciparum highly endemic areas. however, sp still
used p. falciparum infections low endemic areas cq used in
suspected cases areas lack diagnostic facilities. study examines 
the prevalence molecular markers cq sp resistance p. falciparum 
plasmodium vivax determine high levels vivo resistance reflected 
at molecular level well.
methods: finger prick blood samples (n=189) collected malaria positive 
patients two high endemic districts analysed single nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps) resistance related genes p. falciparum p.
vivax cq (pfcrt, pfmdr1, pvmdr1) sp (pfdhfr, pfdhps, pvdhfr), using
various pcr-based methods.
results discussion: positive p. vivax p. falciparum infections were
identified pcr 92 41 samples respectively. however, 
negative subsequent pcrs. based p. falciparum samples, molecular 
level cq resistance p. falciparum high since nearly parasites had
the pfcrt mutant haplotypes cviet (55%) svmnt (42%), though frequency the
pfmdr1 wild type haplotype relatively low (35%). molecular level sp
resistance p. falciparum found high. prevalent pfdhfr
haplotype double mutant cnrni (91%), frequency pfdhps double mutant 
sgeaa ageaa 38% 33% respectively. combined, frequency of
quadruple mutations (cnrni-sgeaa/ageaa) 63%. based p. vivax samples, low
cq sp resistance likely due low prevalence pvmdr1 y976f
mutation (5%) absence triple/quadruple mutations pvdhfr.
conclusions: based limited number samples, prevalence cq sp
resistance molecular levels population study area were
determined high p. falciparum low p. vivax. therefore, cq could
still used treatment p. vivax infections, remains be
tested vivo change act p. falciparum seems justified.
