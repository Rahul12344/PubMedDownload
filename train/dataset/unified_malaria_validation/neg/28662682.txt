background: burden falciparum malaria especially high sub-saharan
africa. differences pressure host immunity antimalarial drugs lead to
adaptive changes responsible high level genetic variations within and
between parasite populations. population-specific genetic studies survey
for genes positive balancing selection resulting drug pressure or
host immunity allow refinement interventions.
methods: performed pooled sequencing (pool-seq) genomes 100
plasmodium falciparum isolates nigeria. explored allele-frequency based
neutrality test (tajima's d) integrated haplotype score (ihs) identify
genes selection.
results: fourteen shared ihs regions least 2 snps score > 2.5 
were identified. regions code genes likely under
strong directional selection. two genes chloroquine resistance 
transporter (crt) chromosome 7 multidrug resistance 1 (mdr1) on
chromosome 5. weak signature selection dihydrofolate
reductase (dhfr) gene chromosome 4 mdr5 genes chromosome 13, 
2 3 snps respectively identified within ihs window. observed strong
selection pressure attributable continued chloroquine and
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine use despite official proscription the
treatment uncomplicated malaria. also major selective sweep on
chromosome 6 32 snps within shared ihs region. tajima's of
circumsporozoite protein (csp), erythrocyte-binding antigen (eba-175), merozoite 
surface proteins - msp3 msp7, merozoite surface protein duffy binding-like
(mspdbl2) serine repeat antigen (sera-5) 1.38, 1.29, 0.73, 0.84 and
0.21, respectively.
conclusion: demonstrated use pool-seq understand genomic
patterns selection variability p. falciparum nigeria, bears 
the highest burden infections. investigation identified known genomic
signatures selection drug pressure host immunity. evidence
that p. falciparum populations explore common adaptive strategies be
targeted development new interventions.
