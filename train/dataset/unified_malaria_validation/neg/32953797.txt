background: diabetic kidney disease (dkd) leading cause end-stage renal
disease; however, underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. recently,
bioinformatics analysis provided comprehensive insight toward molecular
mechanisms dkd. here, re-analyzed three mrna microarray datasets including 
a single-cell rna sequencing (scrna-seq) dataset, aim identifying
crucial genes correlated dkd contribute better understanding dkd
pathogenesis.
methods: three datasets including gse131882, gse30122, gse30529 utilized
to find differentially expressed genes (degs). potential functions degs
were analyzed gene ontology (go) kyoto encyclopedia genes and
genomes (kegg) pathway enrichment analysis. protein-protein interaction (ppi)
network constructed, hub genes selected top three molecular
complex detection (mcode) score. correlation analysis hub genes and
clinical indicators also performed.
results: total, 84 upregulated degs 49 downregulated degs identified.
enriched pathways upregulated degs included extracellular matrix (ecm)
receptor interaction, focal adhesion, human papillomavirus infection, malaria,
and cell adhesion molecules. downregulated degs mainly enriched in
ascorbate aldarate metabolism, arginine proline metabolism, endocrine-
and factor-regulated calcium reabsorption, mineral absorption longevity
regulating pathway, multiple species signaling pathway. seventeen hub genes
were identified, correlation analysis unexplored hub genes and
clinical features dkd suggested egf, kng1, gadd45b, cdh2 might have
reno-protective roles dkd. meanwhile, atf3, b2m, vcam1, cldn4, spp1, sox9,
jag1, c3, cd24 might promote progression dkd. finally, hub genes 
were found present immune cells diabetic kidneys, suggest the
important role inflammation infiltration dkd pathogenesis.
conclusions: study, found seventeen hub genes using scrna-seq
contained multiple-microarray analysis, enriched present understanding 
of molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis dkd cells' level and
provided candidate targets diagnosis treatment dkd.
