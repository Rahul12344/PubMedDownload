here describe ways sequence annotation plasmodium 
falciparum reference genome changed since publication 2002. the
malaria species responsible deaths worldwide, richness of
annotation accuracy sequence important resources p.
falciparum research community well basis interpreting genomes
of subsequently sequenced species. time publication 2002 60% of
predicted genes unknown functions. march 2019, number been
significantly decreased 33%. reduction due inclusion genes
that subsequently characterised experimentally genes significant
similarity others known functions. addition, structural annotation
of genes significantly refined; 27% gene structures changed
since 2002, comprising changes exon-intron boundaries, addition deletion of
exons addition deletion genes. sequence also undergone
significant improvements. addition correction large number of
single-base insertion deletion errors, major miss-assembly the
subtelomeres chromosome 7 8 corrected. number sequenced
isolates continues grow rapidly, single reference genome an
adequate basis interpreting intra-species sequence diversity. therefore
describe publication population reference genome p. falciparum,
called pfref1. reference enable community map regions that
are present current assembly. p. falciparum 3d7 continue be
maintained, ongoing curation ensuring continual improvements annotation
quality.
