mosquitoes high-impact disease vectors capacity transmit
pathogenic agents cause diseases malaria, yellow fever, chikungunya,
and dengue. continued growth knowledge genetic, molecular, and
physiological pathways mosquitoes allows development novel control 
methods continued optimization existing ones. emergence of
site-specific nucleases genomic engineering tools promises expedite
research crucial biological pathways disease vectors. utilization
of nucleases precise efficient manner dependent upon
knowledge manipulation dna repair pathways utilized mosquito.
while progress made deciphering dna repair pathways model
systems, research nature hierarchy mosquito dna repair
pathways, well mechanistic differences may exist, needed. in
this review, describe progress use site-specific nucleases in
mosquitoes, along hierarchy dna repair context mosquito
chromosomal organization structure, knowledge may manipulated
to achieve precise chromosomal engineering mosquitoes.
