there increasing evidence oncogenic kinase pak1 responsible not
only malignant transformation, also several diseases as
inflammatory diseases (asthma arthritis), infectious diseases including
malaria, aids, flu, well series neuronal diseases/disorders
(neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, alzheimer's diseases, huntington's
disease, epilepsy, depression, learning deficit, etc.) often cause
premature death. interestingly, natural pak1-blockers curcumin,
caffeic acid (ca) rosmarinic acid (ra) extend lifespan nematode
caenorhabditis elegans fruit flies. here, explore possibility c.
elegans could provide us quick inexpensive vivo screening system
for series potent safe (non-toxic) pak1-blocking therapeutics, we
examined effects pak1-deficiency down-regulation selected
functions worm, including reproduction, expression hsp16.2 gene, and
lifespan. short, found pak1 promotes reproduction, whereas it
inactivates hsp16.2 gene shortens lifespan, pi-3 kinase (age-1), tor,
and insulin-like signalling /ils (daf-2) worm. findings only
support "trade-off" theory reproduction versus lifespan, also suggest 
the possibility reduced reproduction (or hsp16.2 gene activation) of
this worm could used first indicator extended lifespan quick
in vivo screening pak1-blockers.
