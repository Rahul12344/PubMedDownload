glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency 1 commonest human
enzymopathies, caused inherited mutations x-linked gene g6pd. g6pd
deficiency makes red cells highly vulnerable oxidative damage, therefore
susceptible hemolysis. 200 g6pd mutations known: approximately
one-half polymorphic therefore common various populations. 500
million persons mutations mostly asymptomatic throughout
their lifetime; however, may develop acute sometimes severe 
hemolytic anemia triggered ingestion fava beans, number of
drugs (for example, primaquine, rasburicase), or, rarely, infection.
approximately one-half g6pd mutations instead sporadic: rare patients 
with mutations present chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia. almost
all g6pd mutations missense mutations, causing amino acid replacements that
entail deficiency g6pd enzyme activity: compromise stability the
protein, catalytic activity decreased, combination mechanisms
occurs. thus, genotype-phenotype correlations reasonably well clarified
in many cases. g6pd deficiency correlates remarkably, geographic
distribution, past/present malaria endemicity: indeed, unique
example x-linked human polymorphism balanced protection of
heterozygotes malaria mortality. acute hemolytic anemia managed
effectively provided promptly diagnosed. reliable diagnostic procedures are
available, point-of-care tests becoming increasingly important where
primaquine recently introduced analog tafenoquine required the
elimination malaria.
