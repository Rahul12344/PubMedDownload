background: anti-malarial drug resistance remains major threat global
malaria control efforts. africa, plasmodium falciparum remains susceptible 
artemisinin-based combination therapy (act), emergence resistant
parasites multiple countries southeast asia concerns emergence
and/or spread resistant parasites africa warrants continuous monitoring.
the world health organization recommends surveillance molecular markers 
of resistance included within therapeutic efficacy studies (tes). current 
study assessed molecular markers associated resistance to
artemether-lumefantrine (al) dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (dp) samples
collected children aged 6-59 months enrolled tes conducted siaya
county, western kenya 2016 2017.
methods: three hundred twenty-three samples collected pre-treatment (day-0)
and 110 samples collected day recurrent parasitaemia (up day 42)
were tested presence drug resistance markers pfk13 propeller
domain, pfmdr1 pfcrt genes sanger sequencing. additionally, the
pfpm2 gene copy number assessed real-time polymerase chain reaction.
results: mutations previously associated artemisinin resistance were
detected pfk13 propeller region. however, non-synonymous mutations
in pfk13 propeller region detected. common mutation found on
day-0 day recurrence pfmdr1 multidrug resistance marker at
codon 184f. mutations found pfcrt marker (< 5%). within 
dp arm, recrudescent cases (8 sample pairs) tested pfpm2 gene
copy number single gene copy. none associations observed
mutations treatment outcomes statistically significant.
conclusion: results indicate absence pfk13 mutations associated with
parasite resistance artemisinin area high proportion of
wild-type parasites pfcrt. although frequency pfmdr1 184f mutations
was high samples, association treatment failure reach
statistical significance. spread artemisinin-resistant parasites
remains possibility, continued monitoring molecular markers act
resistance needed complement clinical data inform treatment policy in
kenya malaria-endemic regions.
