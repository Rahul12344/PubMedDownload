objectives: plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance protein 1 (pfmrp1) has
recently emerged important determinant drug resistance mutations 
the gene associated several drugs. aim study to
understand level genetic diversity pfmrp1 determine the
association different mutations altered drug susceptibilities p.
falciparum.
methods: analysed 193 sequences pfmrp1 south-east asia, west asia,
africa, oceania south america. measured level genetic diversity and
determined signatures selection gene. vitro susceptibilities 28
p. falciparum isolates north-east myanmar panel seven commonly used 
antimalarials determined. statistical analysis performed determine
the association different mutations vitro drug susceptibilities.
results: total 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms identified 193
sequences, 22 non-synonymous. whereas mutations pfmrp1 gene 
were conserved among different countries within continent, different 
between continents. seven non-synonymous mutations identified the
north-east myanmar isolates; relatively frequent region well 
as neighbouring countries. molecular evolutionary analysis detected
signatures positive selection gene. moreover, mutations this
gene found associated reduced susceptibilities chloroquine,
mefloquine, pyronaridine lumefantrine.
conclusions: evidence positive selection pmfrp1 association
with susceptibilities parasites multiple drugs signifies potential 
as important candidate monitoring drug resistance.
