dna plasmodium berghei difficult manipulate escherichia coli by
conventional restriction ligation methods due high content adenine 
and thymine (at) nucleotides. limits ability clone large genes to
generate complex vectors modifying parasite genome. describe a
protocol using lambda red recombinase modify inserts p. berghei
genomic dna library constructed linear, low-copy, phage-derived vector. 
method uses primer extensions 50 bp, provide sufficient homology 
antibiotic resistance marker recombine efficiently p. berghei genomic
dna insert e. coli. subsequent vitro gateway reaction bacterial
marker replaced cassette selection p. berghei. insert is
then released used transfection. basic techniques describe here
can adapted generate highly efficient vectors gene deletion, tagging,
targeted mutagenesis, genetic complementation larger genomic regions.
