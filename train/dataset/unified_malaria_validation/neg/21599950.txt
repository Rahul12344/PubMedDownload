background: phytophthora species oomycete plant pathogens major
social economic impact genome sequences determined for
phytophthora infestans, p. sojae p. ramorum. pepsin-like aspartic proteinases
(aps) produced wide variety species (from bacteria humans) and
contain conserved motifs landmark residues. aps fulfil critical roles in
infectious organisms host cells. annotation phytophthora aps would
provide invaluable information studies roles physiology 
phytophthora species interactions hosts.
results: genomes phytophthora infestans, p. sojae p. ramorum contain 11-12
genes encoding aps. nine original gene models p. infestans database
and several p. sojae p. ramorum (three four, respectively) were
erroneous. gene models corrected basis est data, consistent
positioning introns orthologues conservation hallmark motifs.
phylogenetic analysis resolved phytophthora aps 5 clades. 12
sub-families, several contained unconventional architecture, either
lacked signal peptide propart region. remarkably, almost aps are
predicted membrane-bound.
conclusions: one twelve phytophthora aps unprecedented fusion
protein putative g-protein coupled receptor c-terminal partner. the
others appear related well-documented enzymes species,
including vacuolar enzyme encoded every fungal genome sequenced to
date. unexpectedly, however, oomycetes found active and
probably-inactive forms ap similar vertebrate bace, enzyme
responsible initiating processing cascade generates aÎ² peptide

plasmepsin v, membrane-bound ap cleaves effector proteins malaria
parasite plasmodium falciparum translocation host red blood
cell. since translocation phytophthora effector proteins currently a
topic intense research activity, identification phytophthora of
potential functional homologues plasmepsin v would appear worthy of
investigation. indeed, elucidation physiological roles aps
identified offers areas future study. significant revision gene
models detailed annotation presented significantly facilitate
experimental design.
