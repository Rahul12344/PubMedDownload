background: emergence chloroquine resistant plasmodium vivax serious
obstacle towards malaria control india. study elucidates temporal
pattern antifolate [sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp)] resistance p. vivax
infection means genetic polymorphisms, especially analysing single
nucleotide polymorphisms dihydrofolate reductase (pvdhfr) dihydropteroate 
synthase (pvdhps) gene among field isolates urban kolkata municipal
corporation rural purulia region west bengal, india.
methods: blood samples collected 99 microscopically diagnosed p. vivax 
patients (52 kolkata municipal corporation 47 purulia). parasitic
dna extracted followed polymerase chain reaction sequencing of
different codons pvdhfr gene (15, 33, 50, 57, 58, 61, 64, 117, 173 codons)
and pvdhps gene (373, 380, 382, 383, 384, 512, 553, 585, 601 codons) were
performed identify mutations.
results: prevalence double mutant dhfr a15p33n50f57 r 58 t61v64 n 117 i173
allele (53.85 %) observed kolkata municipal corporation (kmc) whereas in
purulia, wild dhfr a15p33n50f57s58t61v64s117i173 allele predominated
(48.94 %). pvdhps gene significant number isolates (17.31 %) kmc
contained double mutant s373e380s382 g 383 p384k512 g 553 v585m601 allele.
pvdhfr pvdhps combination haplotype revealed emergence quadruple
(13.46 %) quintuple (3.84 %) mutant allele kmc, might result poor
clinical response antifolate drugs.
conclusion: study reveals p. vivax parasites rural purulia may still 
be susceptible sp additional caution taken treatment of
vivax malaria kmc limit blooming quadruple quintuple mutant
allele remainder west bengal, india.
