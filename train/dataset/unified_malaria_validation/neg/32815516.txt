the apicoplast plasmodium falciparum parasites believed rely the
import three-carbon phosphate compounds use organelle anabolic
pathways, addition generation energy reducing power within the
organelle. generated series genetic deletions apicoplast metabolic 
bypass line determine genes involved apicoplast carbon metabolism are
required blood-stage parasite survival organelle maintenance. found
that pyruvate kinase ii (pyrkii) essential organelle maintenance, that
production pyruvate pyrkii responsible phenomenon.
enzymatic characterization pyrkii revealed activity ndps dndps
tested, suggesting may capable generating broad range of
nucleotide triphosphates. conditional mislocalization pyrkii resulted in
decreased transcript levels within apicoplast preceded organelle
disruption, suggesting pyrkii required organelle maintenance due to
its role nucleotide triphosphate generation.
