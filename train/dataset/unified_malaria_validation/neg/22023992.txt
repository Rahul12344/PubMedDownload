background: angiostrongylus cantonensis zoonotic parasite causes
eosinophilic meningitis humans. common source infection a.
cantonensis consumption raw undercooked mollusks (e.g., snails and
slugs) harbouring infectious third-stage larvae (l3). however, parasite is
difficult identify snails. purpose study develop a
quick, simple molecular method survey a. cantonensis intermediate host 
snails.
findings: used loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) assay, which
was performed using bst dna polymerase. reactions amplified a. cantonensis
18s rrna gene demonstrated high sensitivity; little 1 fg dna was
detected samples. furthermore, cross-reactivity found other
parasites toxoplasma gondii, plasmodium falciparum, schistosoma
japonicum, clonorchis sinensis, paragonimus westermani anisakis. pomacea
canaliculata snails exposed a. cantonensis first-stage larvae (l1) the
laboratory, l3 observed snails thirty-five days infection. 
all nine samples positive determined lamp assay a.
cantonensis, identified positive using pcr microscopy, this
demonstrates lamp sensitive effective diagnosis.
conclusions: lamp appropriate diagnostic method routine
identification a. cantonensis within intermediate host snail p.
canaliculata simplicity, sensitivity, specificity. holds
great promise useful monitoring tool a. cantonensis endemic regions.
