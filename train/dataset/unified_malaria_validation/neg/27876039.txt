background: knowing extent spread insecticide resistance malaria
vectors vital successfully manage insecticide resistance africa. this
information main malaria vector, anopheles funestus sensu stricto, is
completely lacking populous country africa, nigeria. study
reports insecticide susceptibility status molecular basis of
resistance an. funestus well involvement malaria transmission 
akaka-remo, farm settlement village southwest nigeria.
results: plasmodium infection analysis using taqman protocol coupled a
nested pcr revealed infection rate 8% an. funestus s.s. akaka-remo.
who susceptibility tests showed species developed multiple resistance to
insecticides study area. anopheles funestus s.s. population akaka-remo 
is highly resistant organochlorines: dieldrin (8%) ddt (10%). resistance
was also observed pyrethroids: permethrin (68%) deltamethrin (87%),
and carbamate bendiocarb (84%). mortality rate ddt slightly increased
(from 10 30%, n = 45) pbo pre-exposure indicating cytochrome p450s 
play little role ddt resistance high mortalities recorded pbo
pre-exposure permethrin (from 68 100%, n = 70) dieldrin (from 8 to
100%, n = 48) suggesting implication p450s observed permethrin 
dieldrin resistance. high frequencies resistant allele, 119f f0 (77%) and
f1 (80% resistant 72% susceptible) populations odd ratio of
1.56 (p = 0.1859) show l119f-gste2 mutation almost fixed the
population. genotyping a296s-rdl mutation f0 f1 samples shows 
an association dieldrin resistance odd ratio 81 (p < 0.0001)
(allelic frequency (r) = 76% f0; f1, 90 10% observed in
resistant susceptible populations, respectively) mutation yet 
fixed population.
conclusion: study reports multiple insecticide resistance an. funestus
from akaka remo. is, therefore, necessary pay attention major 
malaria vector effective malaria control nigeria.
