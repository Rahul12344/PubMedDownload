viviparous reproduction characterized maternal retention developing
offspring within reproductive tract gestation, culminating live
birth. cases, mother provide nutrition beyond present 
yolk; known matrotrophic viviparity. phenomenon best
associated mammals, observed insects viviparous
cockroach, diploptera punctata. female d. punctata carry developing embryos in
the brood sac, reproductive organ acts uterus placenta 
protecting providing nutritive secretion intrauterine developing
progeny. basic physiology d. punctata pregnancy been
characterized, little known molecular mechanisms underlying this
phenomenon. study combined rna-seq analysis, rna interference, other
assays characterize molecular physiological changes associated d.
punctata reproduction. comparison four stages female reproductive
cycle males revealed unique gene expression profiles corresponding each
stage sexes. differentially regulated transcripts interest include
the previously identified family milk proteins transcripts associated with
juvenile hormone metabolism. rna interference methoprene application
experiments established potential impacts bothbreakdown synthesis
reduction juvenile hormone maintaining pregnancy d. punctata. these
studies provide comprehensive molecular mechanisms associated cockroach 
viviparity, critical resource comparative purposes among
viviparity insect systems.
