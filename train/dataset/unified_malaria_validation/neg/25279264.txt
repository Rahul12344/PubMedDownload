mosquito densoviruses (dnvs) candidate agents paratransgenic control of
malaria vector-borne diseases. unlike mosquito dnvs, the
anopheles gambiae dnv (agdnv) non-pathogenic larval mosquitoes. however,
the cost infection upon adults molecular mechanisms underpinning
infection mosquito host unknown. using life table analysis, show
that agdnv infection minimal effects an. gambiae survival (no significant 
effect 2 replicates slight 2 day survival decrease third
replicate). using microarrays, show agdnv minimal effect 
adult mosquito transcriptome, 4-15 genes differentially regulated
depending statistical criteria imposed. minimal impact upon global
transcription provides mechanistic understanding lack virus
pathogenicity, suggesting long co-evolutionary history shifted towards
avirulence. applied standpoint, lack strong induced fitness costs
makes agdnv attractive agent paratransgenic malaria control.
