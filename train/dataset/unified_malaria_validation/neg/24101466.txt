as volant mammals, bats captivating high taxonomic
diversity, vital roles ecosystems--particularly pollinators and
insectivores--and, recently, important roles maintenance
and transmission zoonotic viral diseases. genome sequences identified
evidence striking expansion positive selection gene families

parasites century, hosts, possess perhaps most
phylogenetically diverse set hemosporidian genera species. provide a
molecular framework study parasites, surveyed bats three
remote areas upper guinean forest ecosystem. detected four distinct
genera hemosporidian parasites: plasmodium, polychromophilus, nycteria, and
hepatocystis. intriguingly, two species plasmodium bats fall within the
clade rodent malaria parasites, indicative multiple host switches across
mammalian orders. show nycteria species form distinct phylogenetic
group hepatocystis parasites display unusually high diversity and
prevalence epauletted fruit bats. diversity high prevalence novel
lineages chiropteran hemosporidians underscore exceptional position of
bats among mammalian hosts hemosporidian parasites support
hypotheses pathogen tolerance consistent exceptional immunology of
bats.
