ethiopia changed first-line anti-malarial drug uncomplicated plasmodium
falciparum malaria sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) coartem(®) 2004
following nation-wide assessment efficacy drugs 2003. this
study conducted assess prevalence sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
resistance-associated mutations dhfr dhps genes p. falciparum three
years sp withdrawal bahir dar, northwest ethiopia. total 165 blood 
spot samples collected patients infected p. falciparum bahir
dar health center 2005 (n=78) 2008 (n=87) using whatman (3m) filter
papers. three dhfr codons (dhfr108, dhfr 51 dhfr 59) two dhps
codons (dhfr 437 540) believed determine sp resistance were
detected using nested pcr-based dot blot-hybridization technique. dhfr,
only dhfr59arg mutant-type showed statistically significant reduction from
80.3% 2005 56.4% 2008 (p<0.01) significant increase wild
type dhfr59cys haplotypes 4.9% 2005 29.5% 2008 (p<0.01). double
mutants dhfr108asn/51ile detected rate 98.4% 2005 98.7% in
2008. significant decrease triple dhfr (108asn/51ile/59arg) mutation was
observed 2005 (78.6%) 2008(56.4%) (p<0.01). quadruple mutations of
dhfr (108asn/51ile/59arg)/dhps437gly significantly declined 78.6% in
2005 53.8% 2008 (p<0.01) quintuple mutations (dhfr
(108asn/51ile/59arg)/dhps437gly/dhps540glu) showed reduction 60.6% to
37.2% three years (p<0.01). conclusion, decline prevalence of
dhfr/dhps combination mutations might indicate re-emergence sensitive
parasites population following sp withdrawal. therefore, further
monitoring assessment important determine feasibility of
re-introduction sp alone combination affordable safer drug
in future ethiopia.
