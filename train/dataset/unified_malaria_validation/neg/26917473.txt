malaria caused plasmodium, particularly plasmodium falciparum, most
serious widespread parasitic disease humans. recq helicase family members 
are essential homologous recombination-based error-free dna repair processes
in domains life. recq helicases present organism differ and
several homologues identified various multicellular organisms. these
proteins involved various pathways dna metabolism providing duplex
unwinding function. five members recq family present homo sapiens but
p. falciparum contains two members family. report the
detailed biochemical functional characterization bloom (blm) homologue
(pfblm) p. falciparum 3d7 strain. purified pfblm exhibits atpase 3' to
5' direction specific dna helicase activity. calculated average reaction rate
of atpase ~13 pmol atp hydrolyzed/min/pmol enzyme. the
immunofluorescence assay results show pfblm expressed stages
of intraerythrocytic development p. falciparum 3d7 strain. stages 
of development addition nucleus pfblm also localizes cytoplasm. 
gene disruption studies pfblm dsrna showed required the
ex-vivo intraerythrocytic development parasite p. falciparum 3d7 strain.
the dsrna mediated inhibition parasite growth suggests variety of
pathways affected resulting curtailing parasite growth. study 
will helpful unravelling basic mechanism dna transaction the
malaria parasite additionally may provide leads understand parasite
specific characteristics protein.
