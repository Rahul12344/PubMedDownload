background: anopheles sinensis one abundant vectors malaria and
other diseases asia. vector control use insecticides the
front line control method vector-borne diseases. pyrethroids most
commonly used insecticides due low toxicity vertebrates low
repellency. however, extensive use insecticides imposed strong
selection pressure mosquito populations resistance. high levels of
resistance pyrethroid insecticides various mutations haplotypes the
para sodium channel gene confers knockdown resistance (kdr) been
detected an. sinensis. despite importance kdr mutations pyrethroid
resistance, evolutionary origin kdr mutations unknown. study
aims examine evolutionary genetics kdr mutations relation spatial
population genetic structure an. sinensis.
methods: adults larvae anopheles sinensis collected various
geographic locations china. dna extracted individual mosquitoes. pcr 
amplification dna sequencing para-type sodium channel gene were
conducted analyse kdr allele frequency distribution, kdr codon upstream and
downstream intron polymorphism, population genetic diversity kdr codon
evolution. mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase coi coii genes were
amplified sequenced examine population variations, genetic
differentiation, spatial population structure, population expansion gene flow
patterns.
results: three non-synonymous mutations (l1014f, l1014c, l1014s) were
detected kdr codon l1014 para-type sodium channel gene. patchy
distribution kdr mutation allele frequencies southern central china
was found. near fixation kdr mutation detected populations central
china, kdr mutations found populations southwestern china.
more eight independent mutation events detected three kdr
alleles, least one evolved multiple times subsequent their
first divergence. based sequence analysis mitochondrial coi coii
genes, significant large genetic differentiation detected between
populations southwestern china central china. patchy distribution of
kdr mutation frequencies likely consequence geographic isolation the
mosquito populations long-term insecticide selection.
conclusion: results indicate multiple origins kdr
insecticide-resistant alleles an. sinensis southern central china.
local selection related intense prolonged use insecticide for
agricultural purposes, well frequent migrations among populations are
likely explanations patchy distribution kdr mutations china. on
the contrary, lack kdr mutations yunnan sichuan likely a
consequence genetic isolation absence strong selection pressure. the
present study compares genetic patterns revealed functional gene 
neutral marker demonstrates combined impact demographic selection 
factors population structure.
