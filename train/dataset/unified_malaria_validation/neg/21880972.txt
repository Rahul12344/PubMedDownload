accurate malaria diagnosis dual roles identification symptomatic
persons effective malaria treatment also enumeration asymptomatic
persons contribute epidemiologic determinants transmission. three
currently used diagnostic tests, microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests (rdts), and
real-time pcr, different sensitivities specificities, are
parasite density dependent. here, compare concordance among 451 febrile 
episodes cohort 2,058 children adults followed 6 months a
region central tanzania hypoendemic malaria. microscopy, histidine-rich
protein-based rdt, two different real-time pcr gene probes detected
plasmodium falciparum 20, 54, 41, 78 episodes fever, respectively. they
had complete concordance 9 episodes. real-time pcr 18s probe 
more sensitive mitochondrial probe cytochrome b despite higher
copy numbers mitochondrial dna. pcr yields increased 4-fold by
glycogen/acetate precipitation low-speed centrifugation. duplicate pcr
increases low-density malaria detection. rdt highest number unique
positives, presumably persistent antigen despite absence parasites,
although rdt detect 3 parasitemias 1,000 parasites/Î¼l. a
latent class analysis, real-time pcr significantly higher sensitivity than
did microscopy rdt. agreement real-time pcr, rdt, microscopy was
highest march april, p. falciparum parasite rate and
parasite densities highest. real-time pcr sensitive specific than
rdt microscopy low-prevalence, low-parasite-density settings.
