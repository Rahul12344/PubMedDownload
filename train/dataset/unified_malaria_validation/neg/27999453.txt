polymorphisms cytokine genes alter production proteins and
consequently affect immune response. trihybrid heterogeneity the
brazilian population characterized condition use ancestry
informative markers. objective study evaluate frequency of

gene polymorphisms association malaria vivax genomic ancestry.
samples 90 vivax malaria-infected individuals 51 noninfected individuals
from northern brazil evaluated. genotyping carried using aso-pcr 
or pcr/rflp. genomic ancestry individuals classified using 48
insertion/deletion polymorphism biallelic markers. differences in
the proportions african, european, native american ancestry men
and women. significant association observed allele genotype
frequencies 6 snps malaria-infected noninfected individuals.
however, trend toward decreasing frequency individuals
carrying tnf-308a allele increasing proportion european ancestry.
no ethnic-specific snps identified, allelic genotype
association susceptibility resistance vivax malaria. understanding the
genomic mechanisms ancestry influences association critical 
requires study.
