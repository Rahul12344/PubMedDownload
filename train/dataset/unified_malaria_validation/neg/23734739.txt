background: isoprenoids diverse abundant group natural
products. plasmodium falciparum, isoprenoid synthesis proceeds the
methyl erythritol diphosphate pathway products metabolized by
farnesyl diphosphate synthase (fpps), turning enzyme key branch point
of isoprenoid synthesis. changes fpps activity could alter flux of
isoprenoid compounds downstream fpps and, hence, play central role the
regulation number essential functions plasmodium parasites.
methods: isolation cloning gene pf3d7_18400 done amplification 
from cdna mixed stage parasites p. falciparum. sequencing, the
fragment subcloned pgex2t recombinant protein expression. verify if
the pf3d7_1128400 gene encodes functional rpffpps protein, catalytic
activity assessed using substrate [4-14c] isopentenyl diphosphate and
three different allylic substrates: dimethylallyl diphosphate, geranyl
diphosphate farnesyl diphosphate. reaction products identified by
thin layer chromatography reverse phase high-performance liquid
chromatography. confirm product spectrum formed rpffpps, isoprenic
compounds also identified mass spectrometry. apparent kinetic constants
km vmax substrate determined michaelis-menten; also,
inhibition assays performed using risedronate.
results: expressed protein p. falciparum fpps (rpffpps) catalyzes the
synthesis farnesyl diphosphate, well geranylgeranyl diphosphate, being
therefore bifunctional fpps/geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (ggpps) enzyme.
the apparent km values substrates dimethylallyl diphosphate, geranyl
diphosphate farnesyl diphosphate were, respectively, 68 ± 5 μm, 7.8 ± 1.3 μm 
and 2.06 ± 0.4 μm. protein expressed constitutively all
intra-erythrocytic stages p. falciparum, demonstrated using transgenic
parasites haemagglutinin-tagged version fpps. also, present data
demonstrate recombinant protein inhibited risedronate.
conclusions: rpffpps bifunctional fpps/ggpps enzyme structure of
products foh ggoh confirmed mass spectrometry. plasmodial fpps
represents potential target rational design chemotherapeutic agents 
to treat malaria.
