background: thirty-one glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi)-anchored proteins of
plasmodium vivax, merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1), msp1 paralogue, msp4, msp5,
msp8, msp10 reported homologs plasmodium falciparum gene
annotation bioinformatics tools. gpi-anchored proteins contain two
epidermal growth factor (egf)-like domains c-terminus. here, p. vivax
merozoite surface protein 8 (pvmsp8) considered potential targets of
protective immunity.
methods: recombinant pvmsp8 (rpvmsp8) expressed, purified, used the
assessment humoral cellular immune responses p. vivax-infected patients
and immune mice. moreover, target epitope ant-pvmsp8 antibodies and
subcellular localization pvmsp8 also determined.
results: rpvmsp8 successfully expressed purified soluble form
as ~55 kda. pvmsp8 localized outer circle pigments associated 
the food vacuole. rpvmsp8 protein high antigenicity (73.2% in
sensitivity 96.2% specificity) patients infected p. vivax. igg2
antibody subtype predominantly responses antigen. antibody
response pvmsp8 increased day 7 slightly decreased within
a month. longevity anti-pvmsp8 antibody stably sustained 12-year
recovery patient samples. anti-pvmsp8 antibodies recognized two epitopes
that located outside c-terminal egf-like domain. cellular immune
response p. vivax-exposed individuals produced high levels ifn-γ il-10 
upon pvmsp8 antigen stimulation vitro.
conclusions: data study suggest pvmsp8 antigen potential
to induce humoral cellular immune responses patients p. vivax
infection. subcellular localization pvmsp8 confirmed was
associated parasite food vacuole blood-stage parasites. further
characterization protein useful blood stage p. vivax vaccine 
development.
