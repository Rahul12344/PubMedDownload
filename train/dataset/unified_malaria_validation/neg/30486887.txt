background: malaria nigeria principally due plasmodium falciparum and,
to lesser extent plasmodium malariae plasmodium ovale. plasmodium vivax 
is thought absent nigeria particular sub-saharan africa in
general, due near fixation duffy negative gene population. 
nevertheless, frequent reports p. vivax infection duffy negative 
individuals sub-region, including reports two countries sharing
border nigeria west (republic benin) east (cameroon).
additionally, two cases microscopic vivax-like malaria from
nigerian indigenous population. hence molecular surveillance circulating
plasmodium species two states (lagos edo) southwestern nigeria was
carried out.
methods: cross-sectional survey september 2016 march 2017 was
conducted. 436 febrile patients included present work. venous blood 
of patients subjected rdt well microscopy. further, parasite
dna isolated positive samples pcr diagnostic employed followed
by direct sequencing 18s rrna plasmodium species well sequencing 
of portion promoter region duffy antigen receptor chemokines.
samples positive p. vivax re-amplified several times finally using
the high fidelity taq rule bias introduced.
results: 256 (58.7%) amplifiable malaria parasite dna, p. falciparum was, 
as expected, major cause infection, either alone 85.5% (219/256; 97 from
edo 122 lagos), mixed p. malariae 6.3% (16/256) p. vivax
1.6% (4/256). one five p. vivax isolates found single
infection. dna sequencing subsequent alignment 18s rrna p. vivax
with reference strains displayed high similarities (100%). remarkably,
the t-33c identified p. vivax samples, thus confirming all
vivax-infected patients current study duffy negative.
conclusion: present study gave first molecular evidence p. vivax in
nigeria duffy negative individuals. though restricted two states; edo in
south-south lagos south-west nigeria, real burden species in
nigeria sub-saharan africa might underestimated, hence is
need put place country-wide, well sub-saharan africa-wide
surveillance appropriate control measures.
