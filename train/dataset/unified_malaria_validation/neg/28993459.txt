the histozoic myxozoan parasite kudoa thyrsites causes postmortem myoliquefaction
and responsible economic losses salmon aquaculture pacific
northwest. despite importance, little known host-parasite
relationship, including host response infection. present work sought
to characterize immune response atlantic salmon infection,
recovery, reexposure k. thyrsites exposure infective seawater,
infected uninfected smolts sampled three times 4,275 degree-days.
histological analysis revealed infection severity decreased time exposed 
fish, controls evidence infection. following secondary
exposure fish, severity infection controls similar that
measured exposed fish first sampling time significantly reduced
in reexposed fish, suggesting acquisition protective immunity. using
immunohistochemistry, detected population mhiiβ+ cells infected muscle
that followed pattern abundance concordant parasite prevalence.
infiltration cells infected myocytes preceded destruction the
plasmodium dissemination myxospores. dual labeling indicated majority of
these cells cd83+/mhiiβ+ using reverse transcription-quantitative pcr, we
detected significant induction cellular effectors, including
macrophage/dendritic cells (mhii/cd83/mcsf), b cells (igm/igt), cytotoxic t
cells (cd8/nkl), musculature infected fish. data support role
for cellular effectors antigen-presenting cells (monocyte/macrophage 
dendritic cells) along b cells acquired protective immune
response atlantic salmon k. thyrsites.
