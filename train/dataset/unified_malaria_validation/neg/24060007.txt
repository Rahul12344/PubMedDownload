background: amplified fragment length polymorphism (aflp) markers frequently 
used wide range studies, genome-wide mapping, population genetic
diversity estimation, hybridization introgression studies, phylogenetic
analyses, detection signatures selection. important issue be
addressed fields distribution markers across 
genome, particularly relation gene sequences.
results: using in-silico restriction fragment analysis genomes nine
eukaryotic species characterise distribution aflp fragments across 
genome and, particularly, relation gene locations. first, identify the
physical position markers across chromosomes species. observed
accumulation fragments around (peri) centromeric regions species is
produced repeated sequences, accumulation disappears aflp bands 
rather fragments considered. second, calculate percentage aflp
markers positioned within gene sequences. typical ecori/msei enzyme pair,
this ranges 28 87% usually larger expected chance
because higher gc content gene sequences relative intergenic ones.
in agreement this, use enzyme pairs gc-rich restriction sites
substantially increases percentages. example, using enzyme
system saci/hpaii, 86% aflp markers located within gene sequences a.
thaliana, 100% markers plasmodium falciparun. find 
a typical trait controlled 50 genes average size, 1000 aflps used in
a study, number within 1 kb distance genes would 
only 1-2, 50% genes would markers within that
distance.
conclusions: high coverage aflp markers across genomes high
proportion markers within close gene sequences make suitable for
genome scans detecting large islands differentiation genome.
however, specific traits, percentage aflp markers close genes can
be rather small. therefore, genome scans directed towards search markers
closely linked selected loci difficult task many instances.
