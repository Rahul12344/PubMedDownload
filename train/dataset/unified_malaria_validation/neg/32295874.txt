blood feeding integral behavior mosquitoes acquire nutritional
resources needed reproduction. requirement also enables mosquitoes to
serve efficient vectors acquire potentially transmit multitude of
mosquito-borne diseases, notably malaria. recent studies suggest that
mosquito immunity stimulated following blood meal, independent infection 
status. since blood feeding promotes production hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone
(20e), hypothesized 20e plays important role priming immune
response pathogen challenge. here, examine immunological effects of
priming anopheles gambiae 20e prior pathogen infection, demonstrating a
significant reduction bacteria plasmodium berghei survival mosquito
host. transcriptome sequencing (rna-seq) analysis following 20e treatment
identifies several known 20e-regulated genes, well several immune genes
with previously reported function antipathogen defense. together, data
demonstrate 20e influences cellular immune function antipathogen
immunity following mosquito blood feeding, arguing importance hormones 
the regulation mosquito innate immune function.importance blood feeding is
required provide nutrients mosquito egg production serves a
mechanism acquire transmit pathogens. shortly blood meal taken,
there peak production 20-hydroxyecdysone (20e), mosquito hormone
that initiates physiological changes, including yolk protein production and
mating refractoriness. here, examine additional roles 20e regulation
of mosquito immunity, demonstrating priming immune system 20e
increases mosquito resistance pathogens. identify differentially expressed 
genes response 20e treatment, including several involved innate immune
function well lipid metabolism transport. together, data argue
that 20e stimulates mosquito cellular immune function innate immunity shortly
after blood feeding.
