in southern pacific coast chiapas, mexico (sm), two abundant
vector species, nyssorhynchus albimanus anopheles pseudopunctipennis, were
susceptible different plasmodium vivax pvs25/28 haplotypes. broaden our
understanding existing p. vivax area, genes encoding proteins
relevant ookinete development 18s rrna studied. p. vivax
infectivity (percentage infected mosquitoes oocyst numbers) evaluated 
by simultaneously feeding infected blood samples patients ny. albimanus
and an. pseudopunctipennis female mosquitoes. three infectivity patterns were
identified: one group parasites infective an. pseudopunctipennis 
than ny. albimanus, another group infective ny. albimanus, a
third group infected vectors similarly. 29 parasite isolates, the
molecular variations ookinete-specific genes 18s rrna-type were
analyzed. using concatenated sequences, phylogenetic trees, structure
analysis, parasite clustering within sm isolates from
other geographical origins investigated. ml phylogenetic tree resolved two
parasite lineages: pvsm-a pvsm-b. associated different 18s
rrna variant. pvsm-a parasites 18s rrna variant rv2 correspond to
parasites causing high oocyst infection ny. albimanus. new ml tree and
structure analysis, comprising global sequences, showed pvsm-a clustered
with latin american parasites. meanwhile, isolates pvsm-b 18s rrna
variant rv1 remained unique genetic cluster comprising two subgroups:
pvsm-ba, producing high infection an. pseudopunctipennis, pvsm-bb, causing
similar oocyst infection vector species. pvsm-a parasites were
genetically similar parasites south america. meanwhile, pvsm-b were
exclusive southern mexico share ancestry asian parasites. results
suggest lineages evolved separately, likely geographic vector
restriction.
