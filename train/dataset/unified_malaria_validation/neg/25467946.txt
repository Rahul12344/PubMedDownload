our recent studies focused identification characterization the
tryptophan-rich proteins plasmodium vivax parasite role the
elicitation humoral cellular responses erythrocyte-binding activity
was investigated. here, report humoral responses 32.4-kda p. vivax
tryptophan-rich antigen (pvtrag32.4) among sera p. vivax-infected
patients. pvtrag32.4 also contains unusually high percentage tryptophan
residues (10.7 %) positionally conserved orthologues in
plasmodium yoelii (pypag1 pypag2) plasmodium falciparum (pftrythra and
pfmatra). thirty-four 40 (85.0 %) p. vivax isolates showed seropositivity 
to recombinant pvtrag32.4 elisa. mean ± sd values optical density (od) 
for p. vivax subjects naïve individuals 1.02 ± 0.36 0.26 ± 0.11,
respectively. western blot analysis, majority subjects studied
(n = 44) showed reactivity recombinant, purified pvtrag32.4. antigen 
does show binding erythrocytes, immunofluorescence data
reveals expressed erythrocytic stages parasite. sequence
analysis clinical isolates various parts country shows that
pvtrag32.4 highly conserved. functional in-depth characterization such
type novel proteins parasite warranted development of
successful malaria intervention methods.
