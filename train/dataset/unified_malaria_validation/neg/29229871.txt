malaria major public health concern northeast india preponderance 
of drug-resistant strains. recently partner drug artemisinin
combination therapy (act) sulphadoxine pyrimethamine (sp). antifolate drug
resistance associated mutations dihydropteroate synthase
(dhps) dihydrofolatereductase (dhfr) genes. study investigated
antifolate drug resistance molecular level. total 249 fever cases
from arunachal pradesh, ne india, screened malaria, these, 75
were found positive plasmodium falciparum. samples sequenced and
analysed help bioedit clustalw. three novel point mutations 
found dhps gene 10 haplotypes along already reported
mutations. single haplotype quadruple mutation found dhfr
gene. study reports higher degree antifolate drug resistance evidenced 
by presence multiple point mutations dhps dhfr genes. findings 
of study strongly discourage use sp partner drug act.
