for 100 years studies avian haemosporidian parasite species relied
on similarities morphology establish species concept. some
exceptional cases also included information life cycle and
sporogonic development. 50 avian plasmodium spp. been
described. however, pcr-based studies show much broader diversity of
haemosporidian parasites, indicating possible existence diverse group of
cryptic species. present study, using similarity phylogenetic
species definition concepts, believe report first characterised
cryptic speciation case avian plasmodium parasite. used sequence
information mitochondrial cytochrome b gene constructed phylogenies of
identified plasmodium spp. define position phylogenetic tree.
after analysis blood stages, morphology parasite shown be
identical plasmodium circumflexum. however, geographic distribution the
new parasite, phylogenetic information, well patterns development of
infection, indicate parasite differs p. circumflexum. plasmodium
homocircumflexum n. sp. described based information genetic
differences described lineages, phylogenetic position biological
characters. parasite develops parasitemia experimentally infected birds -
the domestic canary serinus canaria domestica, siskin carduelis spinus and
crossbill loxia curvirostra. anaemia caused high parasitemia, well as
cerebral paralysis caused exoerythrocytic stages brain, main
reasons mortality. exoerythrocytic stages also form organs (heart,
kidneys, liver, lungs, spleen, intestines pectoral muscles). dna
amplification unsuccessful faecal samples heavily infected birds. the
sporogonic development initiates, abortive, oocyst stage two
common european mosquito species, culex pipiens pipiens (forms pipiens and
molestus) aedes vexans. vectors plasmodium sp. remain unknown.
