epigenetic mechanisms, dna methylation, determine immune cell phenotype. 
to understand epigenetic alterations induced helminth coinfections, we
evaluated longitudinal effect ascariasis schistosomiasis infection 
cd4+ cell dna methylation downstream tuberculosis (tb)-specific and
bacillus calmette-guérin-induced immune phenotype. experiments performed
on human primary immune cells longitudinal cohort recently tb-exposed
children. compared age-matched uninfected controls, children active
schistosoma haematobium ascaris lumbricoides infection 751 differentially
dna-methylated genes, 72% hypermethylated. gene ontology pathway analysis
identified inhibition ifn-γ signaling, cellular proliferation, th1
pathway. targeted real-time quantitative pcr methyl-specific endonuclease
digestion confirmed dna hypermethylation transcription factors batf3, id2,
stat5a, irf5, pparg, runx2, irf4, nfatc1 cytokines cytokine receptors 
ifngr1, tnfs11, relt (tnf receptor), il12rb2, il12b (p < 0.001;
sidak-bonferroni). functional blockage ifn-γ signaling pathway was
confirmed, helminth-infected individuals decreased upregulation of
ifn-γ-inducible genes (mann-whitney p < 0.05). hypomethylation il-4
pathway dna hypermethylation th1 pathway confirmed ag-specific 
multidimensional flow cytometry demonstrating decreased tb-specific ifn-γ tnf
and increased il-4 production cd4+ cells (wilcoxon signed-rank p < 0.05). in
s. haematobium-infected individuals, dna methylation immune phenotypic 
changes persisted least 6 mo successful deworming. work
demonstrates helminth infection induces dna methylation immune
perturbations inhibit tb-specific immune control duration of
these changes helminth specific.
