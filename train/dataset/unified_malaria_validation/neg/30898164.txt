background: world health organization recommends regular therapeutic efficacy
studies (tes) monitor performance first second-line anti-malarials.
in 2016, efficacy safety artemether-lumefantrine (al) treatment of
uncomplicated falciparum malaria assessed tes conducted between
april october 2016 four sentinel sites kibaha, mkuzi, mlimba, ujiji
in tanzania. study also assessed molecular markers artemisinin and
lumefantrine (partner drug) resistance.
methods: eligible patients enrolled four sites, treated standard
doses al, monitored 28 days clinical laboratory assessments. 
the main outcomes pcr corrected cure rates, day 3 positivity rates, safety
of al, prevalence single nucleotide polymorphisms plasmodium falciparum
kelch 13 (pfk13) (codon positions: 440-600) p. falciparum multi-drug
resistance 1 (pfmdr1) genes (codons: n86y, y184f d1246y), markers of
artemisinin lumefantrine resistance, respectively.
results: 344 patients enrolled, three withdrew, six lost follow-up;
and results analysed 335 (97.4%) patients. two patients treatment
failure (one early treatment failure one recrudescent infection) pcr
correction, yielding adequate clinical parasitological response of > 98%. 
day 3 positivity rates ranged 0 5.7%. common adverse events included
cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea. two patients serious adverse 
events; one died first dose al another required hospitalization 
after second dose al (on day 0) recovered completely. 344 samples
collected enrolment (day 0), 92.7% 100% successfully sequenced for
pfk13 pfmdr1 genes, respectively. six (1.9%) non-synonymous mutations 
pfk13, none previously associated artemisinin resistance. 
for pfmdr1, nfd haplotype (codons n86, 184f d1246) detected 134
(39.0%) samples; ranging 33.0% mlimba 45.5% mkuzi. difference
among four sites significant (p = 0.578). samples single
copy pfmdr1 gene.
conclusion: study indicated high efficacy al safety profile was
consistent previous reports. known artemisinin-resistance
pfk13 mutations, high prevalence pfmdr1 haplotype associated
with reduced sensitivity lumefantrine (but reduced efficacy observed in
the subjects). continued tes monitoring markers resistance to
artemisinin partner drugs critical early detection resistant
parasites inform evidence-based malaria treatment policies. trial
