drug resistance always one important impediments global
malaria control. artemisinin resistance recently confirmed the
greater mekong subregion (gms) efforts surveillance containment are
intensified. determine potential mechanisms artemisinin resistance and
monitor emergence spread resistance regions gms, we
investigated vitro sensitivity 51 culture-adapted parasite isolates
from china-myanmar border area four drugs. 50% inhibitory
concentrations (ic₅₀s) dihydroartemisinin, mefloquine lumefantrine were
clustered relatively narrow, 3- 6-fold range, whereas ic₅₀ range of
artesunate 12-fold. assessed polymorphisms candidate resistance
genes pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfatp6, pfmdr6 pfmt (a putative metabolite/drug
transporter). k76t mutation pfcrt reached fixation study parasite
population, whereas point mutations pfmdr1 pfatp6 low levels of
prevalence. addition, pfmdr1 gene amplification detected. none 
mutations pfmdr1 pfatp6 associated significantly vitro
sensitivity artemisinin derivatives. abc transporter gene pfmdr6 harbored 
two point mutations, two indels, number variations three simple repeats.
only length variation microsatellite repeat appeared associated with
altered sensitivity dihydroartemisinin. pfmt gene two point mutations 
and one codon deletion; i30n n496- reached high levels of
prevalence. however, none snps haplotypes pfmt correlated
significantly resistance four tested drugs. compared other
parasite populations gms, studies revealed drastically different
genotype drug sensitivity profiles parasites china-myanmar border
area, artemisinins deployed extensively 30 years.
