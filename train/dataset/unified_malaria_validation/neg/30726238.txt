endosymbiosis driven major molecular cellular innovations. plasmodium
spp. parasites cause malaria contain essential, non-photosynthetic
plastid-the apicoplast-which originated secondary (eukaryote-eukaryote)
endosymbiosis. discover organellar pathways evolutionary biomedical
significance, performed mutagenesis screen essential genes required 
apicoplast biogenesis plasmodium falciparum. apicoplast(-) mutants were
isolated using chemical rescue permits conditional disruption the
apicoplast new fluorescent reporter organelle loss. five candidate
genes validated (out 12 identified), including triosephosphate
isomerase (tim)-barrel protein likely derived core metabolic enzyme
but evolved new activity. results demonstrate, knowledge, first 
forward genetic screen assign essential cellular functions unannotated p.
falciparum genes. putative tim-barrel enzyme newly identified
apicoplast biogenesis proteins open opportunities discover new mechanisms of
organelle biogenesis, molecular evolution underlying eukaryotic diversity, and
drug targets multiple parasitic diseases.
