symbiosis recognized driving force evolution, role finds
its ultimate expression variety associations bonding insects with
microbial symbionts. associations contributed evolutionary
success insects, hosts acquiring capacity exploit novel
ecological niches, symbionts passing facultative associations to
obligate, mutualistic symbioses. bacterial symbiont insects, transition
from free-living life style mutualistic symbiosis often resulted a
reduction genome size, generation smallest bacterial
genomes thus far described. here, show process genome reduction is
still occurring asaia, group bacterial symbionts associated a
variety insects. indeed, comparative genomics asaia isolated different
mosquito species revealed substantial genome size gene content reduction in
asaia anopheles darlingi, south-american malaria vector. thus propose
asaia novel model study genome reduction dynamics, within single
bacterial taxon, evolving common biological niche.
