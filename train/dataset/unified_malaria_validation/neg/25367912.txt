the development resistance antimalarials major challenge global
malaria control. artemisinin-based combination therapies, newest class of
antimalarials, used worldwide reports artemisinin
resistance southeast asia. february may 2013, conducted
open-label, nonrandomized therapeutic efficacy studies artemether-lumefantrine
(al) dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (dp) zaire uíge provinces in
northern angola. parasitological clinical responses treatment in
children uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum monoinfection measured
over 28 days, main outcome pcr-corrected adequate clinical and
parasitological response (acpr) proportion day 28. parasites treatment
failures analyzed presence putative molecular markers of
resistance lumefantrine artemisinins, including recently identified
mutations k13 propeller gene. 320 children finishing study, 25 
treatment failures observed: 24 al arms 1 dp arm. the
pcr-corrected acpr proportions day 28 al 88% (95% confidence interval
[ci], 78 95%) zaire 97% (91 100%) uíge. dp, proportions
were 100% (95 100%) zaire, 100% (96 100%) uíge. none the
treatment failures molecular evidence artemisinin resistance. contrast,
91% al late-treatment failures markers associated lumefantrine
resistance day failure. absence molecular markers for
artemisinin resistance observed efficacies drug combinations
suggest evidence artemisinin resistance northern angola. is
evidence increased lumefantrine resistance zaire, continue 
be monitored.
