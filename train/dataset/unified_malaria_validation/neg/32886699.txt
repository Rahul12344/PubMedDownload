introduction: false-negative malaria rapid diagnostic test (rdt) results amongst 
symptomatic malaria patients detrimental could lead ineffective
malaria case management. study determined nationwide contribution of
parasites pfhrp2 pfhrp 3 gene deletions false negative malaria rdt
results ghana.
methods: cross sectional study whole blood (~2 ml) collected
from patients presenting malaria symptoms 100 health facilities all
the regions ghana may august 2018. aliquot blood used to
prepare thin thick blood smears, filter paper blood spots (dbs) spot a
pfhrp 2 rdt kit. remaining blood separated plasma blood cells
and stored -20°c. plasmodium parasite density species identity was
estimated blood smears. plasmodium falciparum specific 18s rrna pcr,
merozoite surface protein (msp 1) glutamate rich protein (glurp) gene pcr
were used identify p. falciparum positive samples, subjected to
pfhrp 2/3 exon1-2 exon2 genotyping.
results: 2,860 microscopically p. falciparum positive patients analyzed,
134 (4.69%) false negative p. falciparum specific rdt results. samples for
pcr analysis available 127 false negative patients, the
analysis identified 116 (91.3%) positive p. falciparum. 58.1%
(79/116) false negative rdt samples tested positive msp 1 glurp
pcr. genotyping exon 1-2 exon 2 pfhrp 2 gene identified 12.9%
(10/79) 39.5% (31/79) samples respectively deletions. genotyping
exon 1-2 exon 2 pfhrp 3 gene identified 15.2% (12/79) 40.5%
(32/79) samples respectively deletions. 5% (4/79) false
negative samples deletions exon 1-2 exon 2 pfhrp 2 gene.
out 49 samples tested positive aldolase luminex, 32.6% (16/49)
and) deletions pfhrp 2 exon 2 2% (1/49) deletions exon 2
and exon 1-2 pfhrp 2 gene.
conclusions: low prevalence false negative rdt test results provides
assurance pfhrp 2 based malaria rdt kits remain effective diagnosing
symptomatic malaria patients across regions ghana. although 
a low prevalence parasites deletions exon 2 exon 1-2 pfhrp 
2 gene prevalence parasites deletions pfhrp 2 exon 2 a
third false negative rdt results. need ensure rapid, accurate and
reliable malaria diagnosis requires continuous surveillance parasites with
pfhrp 2 gene deletions.
