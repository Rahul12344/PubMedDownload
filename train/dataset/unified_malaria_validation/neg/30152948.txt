retrospective investigation pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine resistance indicators in
falciparum-malaria positive blood samples south-western saudi arabia.

al-harthi sa.

the efficacy sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (sp) plasmodium falciparum malaria 
treatment increasingly compromised development parasites' resistance.
saudi arabia shifted new combinations including artesunat compound 
last decade. investigated occurrence mutations p. falciparum
dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) n51i, c59r s108n p. falciparum
dihyropteroate synthetase (pfdhps) a437g k540d major indicators sp
resistance stored dna extracts 41 p. falciparum infected specimens
collected ksa southern endemic regions 2012 2014. analysis of
alleles' polymorphisms nested-pcr-rflp showed 68%, 7%, 24% samples
carried parasites pfdhfr 51i, 59r, 108n mutant type alleles,
respectively. one isolate's genotype shared mutations 51i 108n. all
parasites conserved wild type alleles codons 437 540 pfdhps gene.
