background: anopheles pseudopunctipennis important malaria vector the
neotropical region species involved plasmodium transmission in
the andean foothills. wide geographical distribution america, high
preference biting humans capacity rest inside dwellings feeding,
are attributes contributing vector status. previous reports tried 
elucidate taxonomic status, distinguishing populations north, central
and south america. present study used mitochondrial marker examine
the demographic history an. pseudopunctipennis northwestern argentina.
methods: twelve localities selected across 550 km distribution of
this species argentina, including two near bolivian border several 
south tucumán, sampling. fragment cytochrome oxidase (coi) gene
was sequenced haplotype relationships analyzed statistical
parsimony network neighbor-joining (nj) tree. genetic differentiation was
estimated fst. historical demographic processes evaluated using
diversity measures, neutrality tests mismatch distribution.
results: forty-one haplotypes identified, haplotype 
common widely distributed. neither network nj tree showed any
geographic differentiation northern southern populations. haplotype
diversities, tajima's dt fu & li's f neutrality tests mismatch
distribution supported scenario holocene demographic expansion.
conclusion: demographic pattern suggests an. pseudopunctipennis has
undergone single colonization process, ancestral haplotype shared by
specimens localities, indicating mitochondrial gene flow. genetic
differentiation minimal, observed one northern one southern 
locality. estimated time population expansion species was
during holocene. data suggest regional vector control measures
would equally effective northern southern localities sampled, 
also insecticide resistant genes may spread rapidly within region.
