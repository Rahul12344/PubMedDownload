to explore structural basis odorant specificity odorant receptors of
the human malaria vector mosquito, anopheles gambiae, odorant-binding subunits
(agam\ors) expressed xenopus oocytes combination agam\orco (coreceptor
subunit) assayed 2-electrode voltage clamp 25 structurally
related odorants. agam\or13 agam\or15 display 82% amino acid identity had
similar, somewhat distinct odorant response profiles. ratio of
acetophenone 4-methylphenol responses used mutation-based analysis of
agam\or15, interchanging 37 disparate residues agam\or15 agam\or13.
eleven mutations caused significant changes odorant responsiveness. mutation
of alanine 195 resulted largest shift response ratio agam\or15
toward agam\or13. concentration-response analysis series mutations of
residue 195 revealed large effect acetophenone sensitivity, ec50 values
varying >1800-fold correlating residue side chain length. similar
results obtained propiophenone benzaldehyde. but, other
odorants, 4-methylphenol, 4-methylbenzaldehyde, and
4-methylpropiophenone, effect mutation much smaller (ec50 values
varied ≤16-fold). results show alanine 195, putatively located at
the second extracellular loop/fourth transmembrane domain interface, plays a
critical role determining odorant response specificity agam\or15.
