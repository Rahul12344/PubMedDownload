adherence plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes host endothelium is
conferred parasite-derived virulence factor p. falciparum erythrocyte
membrane protein 1 (pfemp1), major contributor malaria severity. pfemp1
located knob structures erythrocyte surface anchored the
cytoskeleton, plasmodium helical interspersed subtelomeric (phist) gene
family plays role many host cell modifications including binding the
intracellular domain pfemp1. here, show conditional reduction the
phist protein pfe1605w strongly reduces adhesion infected erythrocytes 
endothelial receptor cd36. adhesion endothelial receptors less
affected even unaltered pfe1605w depletion, suggesting phist proteins 
might optimized subsets pfemp1 variants. pfe1605w play role 
in pfemp1 transport, directly interacts intracellular
segment pfemp1 cytoskeletal components. first report a
phist protein interacting key molecules cytoadherence complex the
host cytoskeleton, functional role seems play essential role in
the pathology p. falciparum.
