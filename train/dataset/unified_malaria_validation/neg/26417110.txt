gametocytes nonreplicative sexual forms mediate malaria transmission 
a mosquito vector. generated asexual blood-stage parasites that
proliferate circulation. however, little known this
transition genetically regulated. here, report apetala2 (ap2)
family transcription factor, ap2-g2, regulates transition a
transcriptional repressor. disruption ap2-g2 rodent malaria parasite
plasmodium berghei prevent commitment sexual stage halt
development appearance sex-specific morphologies. chip-seq analysis
revealed ap2-g2 targeted ∼1,500 genes recognized five-base motif in
their promoters. target genes required asexual
proliferation parasites blood, suggesting ap2-g2 blocks the
program precedes asexual replication promote conversion sexual
stage. microarray analysis showed identified targets constituted ∼70% of
the up-regulated genes ap2-g2-depleted parasites, suggesting ap2-g2
actually functions repressor gametocytes. promoter assay using a
centromere plasmid demonstrated binding motif functions cis-acting 
negative regulatory element. results suggest global transcriptional
repression, occurs initial phase gametocytogenesis, an
essential step plasmodium sexual development.
