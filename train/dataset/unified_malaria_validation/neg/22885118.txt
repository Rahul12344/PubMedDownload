unmethylated cpg dinucleotide motifs bacterial dna synthetic
oligodeoxynucleotides (odn) potent stimulators vertebrate innate

modulation mosquito immunity plasmodium. anopheles stephensi anopheles 
gambiae mosquitoes inoculated cpg-odn showed significant reductions the
prevalence plasmodium infection, intensity plasmodium infection, number
of eggs produced. microarrays used elucidate transcriptional profiles
of fat bodies cpg-odn-treated mosquitoes. total, 172 genes were
differentially expressed, 136 up-regulated 36 were
down-regulated. major functional class cpg-odn-regulated genes encoded
immune response-related proteins (31%). within group, genes associated 
coagulation/wound healing frequently represented (23%). knockdown
of transglutaminase gene up-regulated cpg-odn chemical
inhibition enzyme resulted significant increase plasmodium
infection. mosquitoes treated cpg-odns found less
susceptible plasmodium infection. transcriptional profiling fat body
suggests protection associated coagulation/wound healing. show
for first time transglutaminase activity plays role control 
plasmodium infection.
