background: anopheles albimanus key malaria vector northern
neotropics. current vector control measures region based mass
distributions long-lasting insecticidal nets (llins) focal indoor residual
spraying (irs) pyrethroids. resistance pyrethroid insecticides be
mediated increased esterase and/or multi-function oxidase activity and/or
mutations voltage-gated sodium channel gene. aim work to
characterize homologous kdr region voltage-gated sodium channel gene
in an. albimanus conduct preliminary retrospective analysis field
samples collected 1990's, coinciding time intense pyrethroid
application related agricultural public health insect control the
region.
methods: degenerate primers designed amplify homologous kdr region in
a pyrethroid-susceptible laboratory strain (sanarate) an. albimanus.
subsequently, specific primer pair used amplify sequence the
region contains 1014 codon associated pyrethroid resistance in
other anopheles spp. (l1014f, l1014s l1014c).
results: direct sequencing pcr products confirmed presence the
susceptible kdr allele sanarate strain (l1014) presence of
homozygous-resistant kdr alleles field-collected individuals mexico
(l1014f), nicaragua (l1014c) costa rica (l1014c).
conclusions: first time, kdr region an. albimanus described.
furthermore, molecular evidence suggests presence kdr-type resistance in
field-collected an. albimanus mesoamerica 1990s. research is
needed conclusively determine association genotypes and
resistant phenotypes, extent may compromise current vector
control efforts.
