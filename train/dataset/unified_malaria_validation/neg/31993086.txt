documenting isolation notoriously difficult species vast polymorphic 
populations. high proportions shared variation impede estimation of
connectivity, even despite leveraging information many genetic markers. we
overcome impediments combining classical analysis neutral variation
with assays structure selected variation, demonstrated using
populations principal african malaria vector anopheles gambiae. accurate
estimation mosquito migration crucial efforts combat malaria.
modeling cage experiments suggest mosquito gene drive systems will
enable malaria eradication, establishing safety efficacy requires
identification isolated populations conduct field testing. we
assess lake victoria islands candidate sites, finding one island 30 km
offshore differentiated mainland samples populations across
the continent. collectively, results suggest sufficient contemporary
isolation islands warrant consideration field-testing locations
and illustrate shared adaptive variation useful proxy connectivity in
highly polymorphic species.
