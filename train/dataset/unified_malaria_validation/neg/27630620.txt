anopheles mosquito midgut harbors diverse group endogenous bacteria that
grow extensively blood feeding help food digestion nutrition
in many ways. although, growth endogenous bacteria regulated various
factors, however, robust antibacterial immune reactions generally
suppressed body compartment heme peroxidase hpx15 crosslinked mucins
barrier. barrier formed luminal side midgut blocks 
direct interactions recognition bacteria elicitors immune 
reactive midgut epithelium. hypothesized absence hpx15, an
increased load exogenous bacteria enormously induce mosquito midgut
immunity situation turn, easily regulate mosquito-pathogen
interactions. study, found blood feeding induced ashpx15 gene
in anopheles stephensi midgut promoted growth endogenous well as
exogenous fed bacteria. addition, mosquito midgut also efficiently
regulated number bacteria induction classical toll
and imd immune pathways. case ashpx15 silenced midguts, growth of
midgut bacteria largely reduced induction nitric oxide
synthase (nos) gene, downstream effector molecule jak/stat pathway.
interestingly, significant induction classical immune pathways was
observed midguts. importantly, nos well known negative
regulator plasmodium development, thus, proposed induction of
diverged immune pathways absence hpx15 mediated midgut barrier might be
one strategies manipulate vectorial capacity anopheles mosquito.
