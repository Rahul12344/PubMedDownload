transmission-blocking vaccines (tbv) target sexual-stages malaria
parasite mosquito midgut widely considered essential tool
for malaria elimination. high-titer functional antibodies required against
target antigens achieve effective transmission-blocking activity. have
fused pfs25, leading malaria tbv candidate antigen imx313, molecular
adjuvant expressed chad63 mva viral vectors secreted 
protein-nanoparticle. pfs25-imx313 expressed viral vectors a
protein-nanoparticle significantly immunogenic gives significantly
better transmission-reducing activity monomeric pfs25. addition, we
demonstrate pfs25-imx313 protein-nanoparticle leads qualitatively
improved antibody response comparison soluble pfs25, well to
significantly higher germinal centre (gc) responses. results demonstrate
that antigen multimerization using imx313 promising strategy enhance
antibody responses pfs25, pfs25-imx313 highly promising tbv
candidate vaccine.
