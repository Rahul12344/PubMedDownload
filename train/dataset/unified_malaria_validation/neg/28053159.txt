immunization humans whole sporozoites confers complete, sterilizing
immunity malaria infection. however, achieving consistent safety while
maintaining immunogenicity whole parasite vaccines remains formidable
challenge. generated genetically attenuated plasmodium falciparum (pf)
malaria parasite deleting three genes expressed pre-erythrocytic stage 
(pf p52-/p36-/sap1-). tested safety immunogenicity the
genetically engineered (pf gap3ko) sporozoites human volunteers. pf gap3ko
sporozoites delivered 10 volunteers using infected mosquito bites 
single exposure consisting 150 200 bites per subject. subjects remained
blood stage-negative developed inhibitory antibodies sporozoites. gap3ko
rodent malaria parasites engendered complete, protracted immunity against
infectious sporozoite challenge mice. results warrant clinical
testing pf gap3ko potential development vaccine strain.
