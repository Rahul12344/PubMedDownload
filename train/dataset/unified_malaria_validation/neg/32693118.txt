splenomegaly, major symptom plasmodium infection, extensively studied for
its immunopathological role mice malaria model infected plasmodium
berghei anka. status autophagic regulation hosts malaria
pathogenesis remains unreported till date. study demonstrated autophagy,
proteasomal degradation nrf2-keap1 antioxidant pathway status host
during plasmodium infection taking murine spleen organ interest.
initial staining autophagic gene expression indicate possibility of
autophagic pathway activation. although conversion lc3a lc3b and
lysosome-autophagosome fusion increases, final degradation step remains
incomplete. resultant upregulation p62 altered phosphorylated status
enhances binding keap1 causing nrf2 translocation nucleus. nrf2 act
as transcription factor upregulating p62 level leading autoinduction
loop p62 expression. interestingly, enhancement p62 interaction with
proteasome subunit rpt1 indicates possible role transporting ubiquitinated
cargo proteasome complex. ubiquitination level increased subsequent
upregulation three modes proteasomal degradation i.e trypsin-like,
caspase-like especially chymotrypsin-like. sqstm1/p62 plays critical
central role regulating autophagy, proteasomal degradation, nrf2-keap1
pathway. incomplete autophagic flux final step may key
therapeutic target, autophagic degradation subsequent pathogenic peptide
presentation utmost necessity downstream immune response.
