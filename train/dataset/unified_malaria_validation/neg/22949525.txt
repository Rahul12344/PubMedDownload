the plasmodial surface anion channel (psac) increases erythrocyte permeability to
many solutes malaria uncertain physiological significance. used a
psac inhibitor different efficacies channels two plasmodium
falciparum parasite lines found concordant effects transport vitro 
parasite growth external nutrient concentrations reduced. linkage
analysis using growth inhibition phenotype dd2 Ã— hb3 genetic cross
mapped clag3 genomic locus, consistent role two clag3 genes in
psac-mediated transport. altered inhibitor efficacy, achieved allelic
exchange expression switching clag3 genes, indicated the
inhibitor kills parasites direct action psac. parasite unable 
undergo expression switching, inhibitor selected ectopic homologous
recombination clag3 genes increase diversity available
channel isoforms. broad-spectrum inhibitors, presumably interact with
conserved sites channel, also exhibited improved efficacy nutrient
restriction. findings indicate psac functions nutrient acquisition 
for intracellular parasites. although key questions regarding channel its
biological role remain, antimalarial drug development targeting psac be
pursued.
