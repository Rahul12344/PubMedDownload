the infection dynamics avian haematozoa, includes genera plasmodium,
haemoproteus, leucocytozoon, complicated variety environmental
factors host-parasite interactions. japan, prevalence haematozoa in
wild birds recently determined several local areas. however, no
information annual prevalence avian haematozoa single study site
has reported. here, investigated long-term infection dynamics of
haematozoa wild birds inhabiting mountain forest japan. blood samples
were collected 415 wild birds captured chichibu mountains saitama 
prefecture altitude 1650 2007 2010. obtained samples
were examined haematozoan infection using nested polymerase chain reaction
(pcr) cytochrome b (cytb) genes haematozoa. total 62 415
(14.9%) forest birds pcr positive haematozoa. relatively high infection 
rates leucocytozoon found among several bird species (parus ater, 64.3%; 
parus montanus, 81.8%) may due host preference vector black
flies host nestling pattern forest. phylogenetic analysis of
amplified cytb sequences revealed first time variety lineages
of avian haematozoa distributed among wild bird hosts high-altitude
forest stand japan. notably, significant seasonal changes prevalence of
avian haematozoa observed; however, continuous investigation likely
provide detailed information host-parasite interactions, including local
environmental factors, influence dynamics avian haematozoan
infections.
