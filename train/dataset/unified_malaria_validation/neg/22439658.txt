pradesh, india.

background: malaria continues significant health problem india.
several intended plasmodium falciparum vaccine candidate antigens are
highly polymorphic. genetic diversity p. falciparum merozoite surface
protein-1 (msp-1) extensively studied various parts world.
however, limited data available india. aim present study 
a molecular characterization block 2 region msp-1 gene the
tribal-dominated, forested region madhya pradesh.
methods: dna sequencing analysis carried 71 field isolates collected
between july 2005 november 2005 98 field isolates collected july
2009 december 2009. alleles identified dna sequencing aligned the
strain 3d7 polymorphism analysis done using edit sequence tool
(dnastar).
results: malaria positivity 26% 2005, rose 29% 2009 p.
falciparum prevalence also increased 72% 2005 81% 2009. the
overall allelic prevalence higher k1 (51%) followed mad20 (28%) and
ro33 (21%) 2005 2009, ro33 highest (40%) followed k1 (36%) and
mad20 (24%).
conclusions: present study reports extensive genetic variations dynamic
evolution block 2 region msp-1 central india. characterization of
antigenic diversity vaccine candidate antigens valuable future vaccine
trials well understanding population dynamics p. falciparum
parasites area.
