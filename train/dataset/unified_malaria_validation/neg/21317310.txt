antigenic variation human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum depends
on transcriptional regulation var gene family. individual
parasite, mrna expressed exclusively 1 var gene âˆ¼60, the
rest genes transcriptionally silenced. modifications chromatin
structure dna regulatory elements associated var gene been
implicated organization maintenance silent state. whether
silencing established level entire chromosomal regions via
heterochromatin spreading level individual var promoters the
action silencing element within var intron debated. here, we
consider possibilities, using clonal parasite lines carrying chromosomally
integrated transgenes. confirm previous finding loss adjacent
var intron results var promoter activation show that
transcriptional activation var promoter within cluster affect the
transcriptional activity neighboring var promoters. results provide more
evidence hypothesis var genes primarily silenced level of
an individual gene, rather heterochromatin spreading. also tested 
intrinsic directionality intron's silencing effect upstream or
downstream var promoters. found intron capable silencing in
either direction that, established, var promoter-intron pair stably
maintained many generations, suggesting possible role epigenetic
memory. study provides insights regulation endogenous var gene
clusters.
