completion sequencing plasmodium vivax genome transcriptome offers 
the chance identify antigens among >5000 candidate proteins. identify those
p. vivax proteins immunogenic, total 152 candidate proteins (160
fragments) expressed using wheat germ cell-free system. results of
western blot analysis showed 92.5% (148/160) targets expressed, 
and 96.6% (143/148) soluble form 67.7% solubility rate. the
proteins screened protein arrays sera 22 vivax malaria patients
and 10 healthy individuals confirm immune profile, 44 (27.5%,
44/160) highly reactive p. vivax antigens identified. overall, 5 candidates 
(rhoptry-associated membrane antigen [rama], pv-fam-a -b, exp-1 and
hypothetical protein pvx_084775) showed positive reaction >80% patient 
sera, 21 candidates 50% 80%. 23% highly
immunoreactive proteins hypothetical proteins, described first time 
in study. one top immunogenic proteins, rama, characterized and
confirmed serological marker recent exposure p. vivax infection.
these novel immunoproteomes greatly facilitate identification of
promising novel malaria antigens may warrant study.biological
significance: establishment high-throughput cloning expression systems
has permitted construction protein arrays proteome-wide study of
plasmodium vivax. study, high-throughput screening assays been
applied investigate blood stage-specific immune proteomes p. vivax. we
identified 44 antigenic proteins 152 putative candidates, 23% 
of hypothetical proteins described first time study.
in addition, pvrama characterized confirmed serological
marker exposure infections. expression one-third selected
antigenic genes shifted p. vivax plasmodium falciparum,
suggesting genes may represent important factors associated p.
vivax selectivity young erythrocytes and/or immune evasion. novel 
immune proteomes p. vivax blood stage provide baseline further
prospective serological marker studies malaria. methods could used to
determine immunodominant candidate antigens p. vivax genome.
