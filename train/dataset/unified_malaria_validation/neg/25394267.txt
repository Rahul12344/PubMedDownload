plasmodium falciparum deadly human malarial parasite, responsible for
an estimated 207 million cases disease 627,000 deaths 2012. recent
studies reveal parasite actively regulates large fraction genes
throughout replicative cycle inside human red blood cells that
epigenetics plays important role precise gene regulation. here, we
discuss recent advances understanding three aspects epigenetic
regulation p. falciparum: changes histone modifications, nucleosome
occupancy three-dimensional genome structure. compare three
aspects p. falciparum epigenome eukaryotes, show
that large-scale compartmentalization particularly important determining
histone decomposition gene regulation p. falciparum. conclude by
presenting gene regulation model p. falciparum combines described 
epigenetic factors, discussing implications model the
future malaria research.
