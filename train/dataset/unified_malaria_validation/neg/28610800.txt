humanized mouse models present important tool preclinical evaluation of
new vaccines therapeutics. show human variable repertoire of
antibody sequences cloned previously described human immune system (his)
mouse model possesses functional human cd4+ cells b cells, namely
his-cd4/b mice. sequenced variable igg genes single memory b-cell and
plasma-cell sorted splenocytes whole blood lymphocytes his-cd4/b mice 
that vaccinated human plasmodial antigen, recombinant plasmodium
falciparum circumsporozoite protein (rpfcsp). demonstrate rpfcsp
immunization triggers diverse b-cell igg repertoire composed various human
vh family genes distinct v(d)j recombinations constitute diverse cdr3
sequences similar humans, although low hypermutated sequences generated. 
these results demonstrate substantial genetic diversity responding human b
cells his-cd4/b mice capacity mount human igg class-switched
antibody response upon vaccination.
