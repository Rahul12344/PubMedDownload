background: host genetics play important role plasmodium falciparum malaria
susceptibility. however, information host genetic factors their
relationships malaria vaccine trial site iganga, uganda is
limited. main objective study determine prevalence of
selected host genetic markers relationship malaria incidence 
vaccine trial site iganga, uganda. 1-year longitudinal cohort study, 423 
children aged 9 years recruited malaria episodes were
investigated. host genetic polymorphisms assessed pcr-rflp, haemoglobin
electrophoresis dna sequencing. using multivariate negative binomial
regression model, estimates impact human genetic polymorphisms on
malaria incidence performed. statistical tests, p value <0.05
was considered significant.
results: prevalences sickle cell haemoglobin trait, g6pd c.202 g>a (rs
1050828) nos2 -954 g>c (rs 1800482) variants 26.6, 22.7 17.3%,
respectively. inducible nitric oxide synthase 2 (nos2 -954 g>c; rs 1800482)
heterozygosity associated lower incidence malaria age groups
{adjusted incident rates ratio (airr) 0.59; 95% ci [0.386-0.887]; p = 0.012)}.
about 4% study subjects co-existence sickle cell hb trait g6pd
deficiency. sickle cell hb heterozygotes (hb as) aged less 1 year
experienced significantly malaria episodes annually children with
normal haemoglobin (hb aa) {airr = 1.98; 95% ci [1.240-3.175]; p = 0.004}. 
was significant influence sickle cell trait malaria incidence among 
older children 1-9 years.
conclusions: mutation (nos2 -954 g>c; rs 1800482) nitric oxide synthase 2 gene
promoter associated lower incidence acute malaria. normal
haemoglobin (wild genotype; hbaa) associated reduced malaria incidence
rates first year life. understanding interplay 
host genetics malaria susceptibility required.
