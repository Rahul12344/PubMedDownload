dna microarray presently one powerful fastest growing
technologies genomic research infectious diseases. accordingly, dna
microarray-based global analyses plasmodium parasites provided many insights
into general biology malaria infection. parasite perspective, 
was shown complex plasmodium life cycle characterized high level
of coordination gene expression time parasites a
considerable capacity alter transcriptional profile response to
external stimuli and/or adaptation varying growth conditions host. in
addition transcriptional profiling, dna microarrays shown useful
for quantitative analyses plasmodium genomic dna including characterizations
of sequence polymorphisms copy number variants (cnv) well genomic loci 
associated different chromatin factors (e.g., immunoprecipitated material
(chip-on-chip)). here, present protocols transcriptional profiling,
comparative genomic hybridization (cgh), chip-on-chip analyses been
developed use low-density long oligonucleotide dna microarrays of
plasmodium species. many presented procedures including rna purification, 
dna amplification, chromatin immunoprecipitation likely be
transferable genomic platforms microarray technologies and
new generation sequencing.
