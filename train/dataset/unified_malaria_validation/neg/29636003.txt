background: non-human primates long identified harbour different
species plasmodium. long-tailed macaques (macaca fascicularis), particular,
are reservoirs p. knowlesi, p. inui, p. cynomolgi, p. coatneyi p. fieldi.
a previous study conducted sarawak, malaysian borneo, however revealed that
long-tailed macaques could potentially harbour novel species plasmodium based 
on sequences small subunit ribosomal rna circumsporozoite genes. to
further validate finding, mitochondrial genome apicoplast
caseinolytic protease genes plasmodium spp. sequenced 43
long-tailed macaque blood samples.
results: apart several named species malaria parasites, long-tailed
macaques found potentially infected novel species plasmodium, 
namely one refer "p. inui-like." group parasites bifurcated into
two monophyletic clades indicating presence two distinct sub-populations. 
further analyses, relied assumption strict co-phylogeny between
hosts parasites, estimated population expansion event 150,000 to
250,000Â years present one sub-populations preceded that
of expansion p. knowlesi. furthermore, sub-populations found 
have diverged common ancestor p. inui approximately 1.5 million years
ago. addition, phylogenetic analyses also demonstrated long-tailed
macaques new hosts p. simiovale.
conclusions: malaria infections long-tailed macaques sarawak, malaysian
borneo complex include novel species plasmodium is
phylogenetically distinct p. inui. macaques new natural hosts of
p. simiovale, species previously described toque monkeys (macaca
sinica) sri lanka. results suggest ecological factors could affect
the evolution malaria parasites.
