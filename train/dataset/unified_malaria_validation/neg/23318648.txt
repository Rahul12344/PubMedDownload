if drug-resistant malaria mutants less fit sensitive forms, will
wane time active drug pressure removed overall sensitivity
to drug may restored. however, studies addressing issue have
been largely retrospective. here, undertook predictive study, using mutant
rodent malaria parasites resistant artemisinin combination treatment (act)
version artesunate+mefloquine (atn+mf) gain insights ability to
compete atn+mf-sensitive forms untreated hosts. previously, plasmodium
chabaudi parasites resistant atn+mf selected vivo prolonged
passaging mice increasing doses two drugs, shown harbour
duplication mdr1 gene. here, resistant parasite, as-atnmf1, mixed 
with progenitor as-atn different proportions mixture injected
into mice left untreated. absolute percentage parasitaemias the
proportion parasite monitored microscopy proportional
sequencing, respectively, every two days period 14days. as-atnmf1
outperformed progenitor as-atn whole sampling period regardless of
the relative starting proportion parasite clone. order assess if
consecutive sub-inoculations could responsible apparent fitness
gain resistant parasite, growth compared as-atn27p, a
parasite passaged number times as-atnmf1, left
untreated. although small fluctuations proportion parasite were
observed time, relative abundance last day sampling
(day 14) virtually identical starting inoculum. conclude
that fitness cost associated mdr1-associated atn+mf resistance
in vivo. observations offer first insights within-host
dynamics act-resistant -sensitive parasites absence drug
