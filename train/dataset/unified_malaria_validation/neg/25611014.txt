in issue journal, brima et al. report thought-provoking research
providing potential evolutionary rationale whereby natural selection might have
preserved genes predispose metabolic syndrome. cd-1 mice fed 
high fat diet, induced metabolic changes characteristic metabolic
syndrome. addition, high fat diet provided substantial protection from
lethality due infection trypanosoma cruzi. authors hypothesize that
the genes predispose metabolic syndrome protection against
infectious disease. thus, selective advantage dying infectious
disease implicitly provides selective pressure predisposing metabolic
syndrome. hypothesis follows similar line reasoning provided
explanations survival hbs mutation sickle cell disease and
renal disease-associated genetic variants apolipoprotein l1. variants these
two genes provide protection malaria trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense,
respectively.
