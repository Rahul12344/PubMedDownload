background: malarial parasite plasmodium falciparum undergoes complex life 
cycle, including intraerythrocytic developmental cycle, is
metabolically dependent infected human red blood cell (rbc). describe
whole cell metabolic activity within p. falciparum rbcs the
asexual reproduction phase intraerythrocytic developmental cycle, we
developed integrated host-parasite metabolic modeling framework driven by
time-dependent gene expression data.
results: validated model reproducing experimentally determined 1)
stage-specific production biomass components precursors the
parasite 2) metabolite concentration changes medium p.
falciparum-infected rbc cultures. model allowed us explore time- and
strain-dependent p. falciparum metabolism hypothesize host cell
metabolism alters response malarial infection. specifically, metabolic 
analysis showed uninfected rbcs coexist infected cells same
culture decrease production 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, oxygen-carrying 
regulator, reducing ability hemoglobin cells release oxygen.
furthermore, response parasite-induced oxidative stress, infected rbcs
downgraded glycolytic flux using pentose phosphate pathway and
secreting ribulose-5-phosphate. mechanism links individually observed
experimental phenomena, glycolytic inhibition ribulose-5-phosphate
secretion, oxidative stress response.
conclusions: although metabolic model incorporate regulatory
mechanisms per se, alterations gene expression levels caused regulatory
mechanisms manifested model altered metabolic states. provides
the model capability capture complex multicellular host-pathogen metabolic
interactions infected rbc culture. system-level analysis revealed
complex relationships parasite reduce oxygen release in
uninfected cells presence infected rbcs well role of
different metabolic pathways involved oxidative stress response of
infected rbcs.
