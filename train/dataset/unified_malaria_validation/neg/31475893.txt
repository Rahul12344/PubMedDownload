background: presently, malaria one prevalent deadly infectious
disease across africa, asia, america started spread in
europe. despite large research carried field, still, 
lack efficient anti-malarial therapeutics. paper, highlight the
increasing efforts urgently needed towards development discovery
of potential antimalarial drugs, must safe affordable. new drugs
thus mentioned also able counter spread malaria parasites have
been resistant existing agents.
objective: main objective review highlight recent
development use system biologybased approaches towards design and
discovery novel anti-malarial inhibitors.
method: huge literature survey performed gain advance knowledge about
the global persistence malaria, available treatment shortcomings of
the available inhibitors. literature search depth analysis also done 
gain insight use system biology drug discovery this
approach could utilized towards development novel anti-malarial
drug.
results: system-based analysis made easy understand large scale
sequencing data, find candidate genes expression malaria disease
progression design drug molecules complementary the
target proteins term shape configuration.
conclusion: review article focused recent computational advances in
new generation sequencing, molecular modeling, docking related malaria
disease utilization modern system network biology approach to
antimalarial potential drug discovery development.
