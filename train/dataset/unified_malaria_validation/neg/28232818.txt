malaria major parasitic infection globally particularly tropical and
sub-tropical regions world responsible 198 million cases 
estimated deaths due disease 0.6 million. emergence drug
resistance malaria parasite alarming necessary understand 
its underlying cause molecular mechanisms. established drug 
resistant malaria parasites defective mismatch repair (mmr) therefore 
essential study pathway components detail. recently number
of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms reported genes
involved mmr pathways. pfmlh endonuclease essential restore mmr
in drug resistant strains plasmodium falciparum. considering facts
about role mmr emergence drug resistant parasite, manuscript
we report genome wide analysis components mmr pathway as
mlh, pms1, msh2-1, msh2-2, msh6, uvrd using silico bioinformatics based
approaches. phylogenetic analysis revealed evolutionary closeness the
mmr components various organisms. noteworthy p. falciparum contains
two homologs msh2, located different chromosomes. structural 
modeling components showed similarity human/yeast mmr
components. docking studies reveal pfuvrd pfmlh interact each
other. silico identification interacting partners major mmr
components identified numerous p. falciparum specific proteins. line 
previous studies present study also contribute significantly to
understand mmr pathway malaria parasite.
