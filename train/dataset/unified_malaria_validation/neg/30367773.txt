despite efforts eliminate it, malaria remains major public health concern,
particularly côte d'ivoire. chloroquine (cq) one first drugs used
for treatment, officially withdrawn market 2007 following
reports high levels chloroquine resistance. present study carried
out withdrawal cq provides update rates cq
resistance côte d'ivoire. samples collected september 2013 and
march 2014 abidjan january may 2016 abengourou san pedro
through cross-sectional studies. parasitemia assessed microscopy, and
single nucleotide polymorphism pfcrt (codon 76) gene analyzed by
nested pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism. total 343 samples
were analyzed: 119, 106 118 abidjan, abengourou, san pedro,
respectively. sex ratio patients 0.92. mean age patients
enrolled 9.6 years (sd = 10.8). geometric mean parasite density was
21,337 parasites/μl (sd = 49,508; range, 2,000-200,000). molecular analysis
revealed 57 k76t mutants (16.6%): 33, 9, 15 abidjan, abengourou san
pedro, respectively. found patients aged ≤15 years (42/57) 
who parasitemia greater 10,000 parasites/μl (40/57). first
study conducted côte d'ivoire reporting decline pfcrt k76t mutation rate.
thus, results indicate importance following observed trend
also national level.
