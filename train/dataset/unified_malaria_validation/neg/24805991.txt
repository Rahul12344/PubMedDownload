with inevitable selection resistance antimalarial drugs treated
populations, need new medicines enter clinic new
targets progress drug discovery pipeline. study set out
to develop transgenic rodent model testing inhibitors plasmodium
falciparum cyclic gmp-dependent kinase vivo. model needed would
allow us investigate whether differences amino acid sequence enzyme
between species influences vivo efficacy. report successful
development transgenic p. berghei line cyclic gmp-dependent
protein kinase (pkg) replaced p. falciparum orthologue. demonstrate
that p. falciparum orthologue able functionally complement the
endogenous p. berghei pkg gene throughout blood stage development early
sexual development. however, subsequent development mosquito severely 
compromised. show due defect female lineage the
transgenic using genetic crosses male female deficient p.
berghei lines. defect could due expression female-specific target
in mosquito stages p. berghei cannot phosphorylated p.
falciparum kinase. using previously reported anti-coccidial inhibitor the
cyclic gmp-dependent protein kinase, show difference vivo efficacy
between transgenic control p. berghei lines. vivo model be
useful screening future generations cyclic gmp-dependent protein kinase
inhibitors allowing us overcome species-specific differences the
enzyme primary sequence would influence vivo efficacy rodent
model. approach also applicable vivo testing other
antimalarial compounds target known.
