trioxacarcin polyoxygenated, structurally complex antibiotic produced by
streptomyces spp., possesses high anti-bacterial, anti-malaria, and
anti-tumor activities. trioxacarcin biosynthetic pathway involves type ii
polyketide synthases (pkss) l-isoleucine unique starter unit, well
as many complex post-pks tailoring enzymes resistance regulatory
proteins. work, two regulatory genes, txn9 coding streptomyces
antibiotic regulatory protein family regulator txn11 two-component
response regulator, revealed absolutely required trioxacarcin
production individually inactivating six annotated regulatory genes in
the txn cluster. complementation assay suggested two activators not
have regulatory cascade relationship. moreover, transcriptional analysis showed
that activate 15 28 txn operons, indicating complicated
regulatory network involved trioxacarcin production. information gained
from study may useful improving production highly potent
trioxacarcin a.
