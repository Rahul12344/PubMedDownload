background: today, cancer still one prevalent and
high-mortality diseases, summing 9 million deaths 2018. has
motivated researchers study application machine learning-based
solutions cancer detection accelerate diagnosis help its
prevention. among several approaches, one automatically classify tumor
samples gene expression analysis.
methods: work, aim distinguish five different types cancer
through rna-seq datasets: thyroid, skin, stomach, breast, lung. so, 
have adopted previously described methodology, compare the
performance 3 different autoencoders (aes) used deep neural network
weight initialization technique. experiments consist assessing two
different approaches training classification model - fixing weights 
after pre-training aes, allowing fine-tuning entire network - and
two different strategies embedding aes classification network,
namely importing encoding layers, inserting complete ae. we
then study varying number layers first strategy, aes latent
vector dimension, imputation technique data preprocessing step
impacts network's overall classification performance. finally, goal 
of assessing well pipeline generalize, apply same
methodology two additional datasets include features extracted from
images malaria thin blood smears, breast masses cell nuclei. also
discard possibility overfitting using held-out test sets images 
datasets.
results: methodology attained good overall results rna-seq image
extracted data. outperformed established baseline considered
datasets, achieving average f1 score 99.03, 89.95, 98.84 mcc 
0.99, 0.84, 0.98, rna-seq (when detecting thyroid cancer), the
malaria, wisconsin breast cancer data, respectively.
conclusions: observed approach fine-tuning weights top 
layers imported ae reached higher results, presented
experiences, considered datasets. outperformed previous
reported results comparing established baselines.
