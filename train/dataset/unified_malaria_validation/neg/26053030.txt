background: hiv-1 plasmodium falciparum malaria cause substantial morbidity
in sub-saharan africa, especially co-infecting pathogens. examined the
relationship presence p. falciparum dna plasma samples clinical
malaria well impact atazanavir, hiv-1 protease inhibitor (pi), on
p. falciparum pcr positivity.
methods: actg study a5175 compared two nnrti-based regimens one pi-based
anti-retroviral (arv) regimen antiretroviral therapy na√Øve participants. we
performed nested pcr plasma samples p. falciparum 18s rrna gene to
detect presence malaria dna 215 221 participants enrolled in
blantyre lilongwe, malawi. also studied closest sample preceding the
first malaria diagnosis 102 persons clinical malaria randomly
selected follow samples 88 persons without clinical malaria.
results: pcr positivity observed 18 (8%) baseline samples not
significantly associated age, sex, screening cd4+ t-cell count, baseline
hiv-1 rna level co-trimoxazole use within first 8 weeks. neither baseline 
pcr positivity (p = 0.45) pcr positivity initiation antiretroviral
therapy (p = 1.0) significantly associated subsequent clinical malaria.
randomization pi versus nnrti arv regimens significantly
associated either pcr positivity (p = 0.5) clinical malaria (p = 0.609). 
clinical malaria associated history tuberculosis (p = 0.006) 
lower bmi (p = 0.004).
conclusion: p. falciparum dna detected 8% participants baseline, but
was significantly associated subsequent development clinical malaria.
hiv pi therapy decrease prevalence pcr positivity incidence 
clinical disease.
