the present research reports detailed silico analysis chromatin assembly 
factor-1 (caf-1) family human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum. our
analysis revealed five chromatin assembly factor-1 genes p. falciparum
(pfcaf-1) pfcaf-1 family divided two classes where, class a
belongs caf-1 complex others kept class b. comparative
studies, orthologs pfcaf-1 family identified across 53 eukaryotic species
and evolutionary relationships drawn different caf-1 subfamilies. the
phylogenetic analysis revealed grouping evolutionary-related species together,
although, divergence observed branching pattern. detailed analysis of
domain composition highlighted species-specific features viz. species-specific
kdds repeats 84 amino acids identified pfcaf-1a whereas, members of
caf-1c/rbap48 rbap46 subfamily exhibited least variation size domain
composition. qrt-pcr analysis revealed upregulation pfcaf-1 members in
trophozoite schizont stage. furthermore, comparative expression analysis 
the available transcriptome proteome data along qrt-pcr analysis
revealed mixed expression patterns (coordination well non-coordination
between different studies). protein-protein interaction network analyses of
pfcaf-1 family carried highlighting important complexes based on
interologs. pfrbap48 found highly connected total 108
ppis followed pfrbap46. results unravel insights pfcaf-1 family
and identify unique features, thus opening new perspectives targeted 
developments understand combat malaria menace.
