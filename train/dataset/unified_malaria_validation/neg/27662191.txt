mosquito-transmitted diseases like malaria dengue fever global problem
and estimated 50-100 million dengue dengue hemorrhagic fever cases are
reported worldwide every year. mermithid nematode romanomermis wuchangensis
has successfully used ecosystem-friendly biocontrol agent mosquito
prevention laboratory studies. however, nematode undergo sex
differentiation vitro culture, seriously affected application 
of biocontrol field. study, based transcriptome sequencing
analysis r. wuchangensis, rwucmab-3, rwuclaf-1 rwuctra-2 cloned and
used investigate molecular regulatory function sex differentiation. qrt-pcr
results demonstrated expression level rwucmab-3 male and
female displayed obvious difference 3rd day parasitic stage, 
earlier rwuclaf-1 rwuctra-2, highlighting sex differentiation process
may start 3rd day parasitic stage. besides, fitc used marker
to test dsrna uptake efficiency r. wuchangensis, fluorescence intensity 
increased fitc concentration 16 h incubation, indicating nematode
can successfully ingest soaking solution via cuticle. rnai results revealed
the sex ratio r. wuchangensis rnai treated groups soaked dsrna of
rwucmab-3 significantly higher gfp dsrna treated groups control
groups, highlighting rnai rwumab-3 may hinder development male
nematodes. results suggest rwucmab-3 mainly involves initiation
of sex differentiation development male sexual dimorphism. rwuclaf-1
and rwuctra-2 may play vital role nematode reproductive developmental
system. conclusion, transcript sequences presented study could provide
more bioinformatics resources future studies gene cloning other
molecular regulatory mechanism r. wuchangensis. moreover, identification and
functional analysis sex differentiation genes may clarify sex
differentiation mechanism r. wuchangensis, helpful solve the
uncompleted sex differentiation problem vitro culture potential
large-scale field application controlling larvae c. quinquefasciatus, a.
aegypti a. albopictus.
