background: plasmodium malariae widely spread neglected human malaria
parasite, causes chronic infections. studies genetic polymorphisms of
anti-malarial drug target genes p. malariae limited. previous reports have
shown polymorphisms p. malariae dihydrofolate reductase gene associated
with pyrimethamine resistance linked pyrimethamine drug pressure. this
study investigated polymorphisms p. malariae homologous genes, chloroquine
resistant transporter multidrug resistant 1, associated chloroquine 
mefloquine resistance plasmodium falciparum.
methods: orthologous p. malariae crt mdr1 genes studied 95
patients p. malariae infection 2002 2016 thailand (n = 51) 
and myanmar (n = 44). gene sequences analysed using bioedit, mega7, and
dnasp programs. mutations gene amplifications compared p.
falciparum plasmodium vivax orthologous genes. protein topology models
derived observed pmcrt pmmdr1 haplotypes constructed and
analysed using phyre2, swiss model discovery studio visualization v 17.2.
results: two non-synonymous mutations observed exon 2 (h53p, 40%) and
exon 8 (e278d, 44%) pmcrt. topology model indicated h53p e278d
were located outside transmembrane domain unlikely affect
protein function. pmmdr1 diverse pmcrt, 10 non-synonymous 
3 synonymous mutations observed. non-synonymous mutations located the
parasite cytoplasmic site, transmembrane 11 nucleotide binding domains 1 
2. polymorphisms conferring amino acid changes transmembrane and
nucleotide binding domains predicted effect pmmdr1
conformation, unlikely affect protein function. p. malariae
parasites study contained single copy mdr1 gene.
conclusions: observed polymorphisms pmcrt pmmdr1 genes unlikely to
affect protein function unlikely related chloroquine drug pressure.
similarly, absence pmmdr1 copy number variation suggests limited
mefloquine drug pressure p. malariae parasite population, despite long
time use thailand treatment falciparum malaria.
