background: mobility birds across continents exposes to
numerous vectors potential transmit pathogens spread them
into new regions. combination rich species diversity birds along the
small amount molecular studies iran makes observing blood parasite
distribution wild avian populations indispensable estimation and
administration blood parasites.
methodology/principal findings: order evaluate infection rate and
molecular context avian blood parasites, bird samples collected
(passerine = 316 non-passerine = 14) eight provinces northern iran
between june september 2015 2016. bird samples examined for
haematoprotozoan infections morphological screening using light microscope and
mtdna cytb gene amplification. total 115 birds positive blood
parasites molecular approach (34.84% overall infection). infection rate of
haemoproteus, plasmodium, leucocytozoon 33.03%, 1.21%, 0.6%,
respectively. sequences analysis detected 43 lineages iranian birds'
hosts. lineages attributed three genera haemoproteus (n = 37), plasmodium
(n = 4), leucocytozoon (n = 2), 23 lineages fully matched previously
recorded sequences genbank malavi data reciprocities. five lineages of
acdum1, acdum2, parus1, pyery01, siskin1 detected multiple hosts'
species dissimilar families. bayesian tree, sequences clustered 
in three main monophyletic clades haemoproteus, plasmodium, leucocytozoon 
genera.
conclusions/significance: first study outlining molecular detection of
hematozoa passerines iran, current study recorded 20 new lineages
for three genera haemoproteus, plasmodium, leucocytozoon. additional
investigations taxa avifauna parts iran may
provide extra information blood parasites, hosts relationships and
distribution patterns.
