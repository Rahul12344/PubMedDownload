liver-resident memory (liver trm ) cells exert protective immune responses
following liver infection malaria parasites. however, trm cells 
developed consequence properly maintained remain 
poorly understood. here, show transcriptional repressor, capicua
(cic), controls liver cd8+ trm cell development maintain normal liver
function. cic-deficient mice greater number liver cd8+ trm cells and
liver injury phenotypes accompanied increased levels proinflammatory
cytokine genes liver tissues. excessive formation cd69+ cd8+ trm -like
cells also observed mice acetaminophen-induced liver injury (aili).
moreover, expansion liver cd8+ trm cell population liver injury phenotypes
in t-cell-specific cic null mice rescued codeletion ets translocation 
variant [etv]5 alleles, indicating etv5 cic target gene responsible for
regulation cd8+ trm cell development liver function. also discovered
that etv5 directly regulates expression hobit, master transcription factor
for trm cell development, cd8+ cells. conclusion: findings suggest the
cic-etv5 axis key molecular module controls cd8+ trm cell development, 
indicating pathogenic role cd8+ trm cells liver injury.
