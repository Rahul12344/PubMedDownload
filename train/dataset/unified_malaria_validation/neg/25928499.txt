whole-genome sequencing technologies increasingly applied plasmodium
falciparum clinical isolates identify genetic determinants malaria
pathogenesis. however, genome-wide discovery methods, haplotype scans for
signatures natural selection, hindered missing genotypes sequence
data. poor correlation single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) p.
falciparum genome complicates efforts apply established missing-genotype
imputation methods leverage patterns linkage disequilibrium (ld). the
accuracy state-of-the-art, ld-based imputation methods (impute, beagle) was
assessed measuring allelic r2 459 p. falciparum samples malaria
patients 4 countries: thailand, cambodia, gambia, malawi. restricting
our analysis 86 k high-quality snps across populations, found 
complete-case analysis restricted 21k snps (24.5%), despite single snp 
having 10% missing genotypes. accuracy beagle filling in
missing genotypes consistently high across populations (allelic r2,
0.87-0.96), performance impute mixed (allelic r2, 0.34-0.99)
depending reference haplotypes population. positive selection analysis
using beagle-imputed haplotypes identified loci involved resistance to
chloroquine (crt) thailand, cambodia, gambia, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
(dhfr, dhps) cambodia, artemisinin (kelch13) cambodia. tajima's d-based
analysis identified genes balancing selection encode
well-characterized vaccine candidates: apical merozoite antigen 1 (ama1) and
merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1). contrast, complete-case analysis
failed identify well-validated drug resistance candidate vaccine loci, 
except kelch13. setting low ld modest levels missing genotypes,
using beagle impute p. falciparum genotypes viable strategy for
conducting accurate large-scale population genetics association analyses, and
supporting global surveillance drug resistance markers candidate vaccine
