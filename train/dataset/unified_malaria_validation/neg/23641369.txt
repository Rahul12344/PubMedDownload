background: characterization plasmodium falciparum diversity commonly
achieved amplification polymorphic regions merozoite surface
proteins 1 (msp1) 2 (msp2) genes.
aims: present study aimed determine allelic variants distribution of
msp1 msp2 multiplicity infection p. falciparum field isolates 
kosti, central sudan, area characterized seasonal malaria transmission.
materials methods: total 121 samples (n = 121) collected a
cross-sectional survey march april 2003. dna extracted msp1
and msp2 polymorphic loci genotyped.
results: total number alleles identified msp1 block 2 11, 16 
alleles observed msp2 block 3. msp1, ro33 found the
predominant allelic type, carried alone combination mad20 k1
types, whereas fc27 family prevalent msp2. sixty two percent of
isolates multiple genotypes overall mean multiplicity infection
was 1.93 (ci 95% 1.66-2.20). age correlated parasite density (p = 0.017). in
addition, positive correlation observed parasite densities 
number alleles (p = 0.022).
conclusion: genetic diversity p. falciparum field isolates central sudan
was high consisted multiple clones.
