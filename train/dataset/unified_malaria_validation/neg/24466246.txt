one major concerns treating malaria conventional small drug
molecules rapid emergence drug resistance. specific silencing of
essential genes antisense oliogomers proposed alternative
approach may result antimalarial activity associated with
drug resistance. addition, approach could important biological
tool studying many genes' function reverse genetics. present a
novel methodology using peptide nucleic acids (pnas) useful tool gene
silencing plasmodium falciparum. pnas, designed specific antisense
molecules, conjugated cell penetrating peptide (cpp); namely,
octa-d-lysine via c-terminus, allow facile delivery cell
membranes. pnas added p. falciparum cultures found exclusively in
infected erythrocytes eventually localized nuclei parasites at
all stages intra erythrocytic development. show pnas
specifically regulated stably expressed transgene well an
endogenous essential gene, significantly reduced parasites' viability. this
study paves way simple approach silence variety p. falciparum
genes means deciphering function potentially develop highly
specific potent antimalarial agents.
