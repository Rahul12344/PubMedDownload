artemisinin-based therapies effective treatment malaria, which
reached 219 million cases killed 435,000 people 2017. meet the
growing demand artemisinin make accessible poorest, genetic
engineering artemisia annua becomes one promising approaches to
improve artemisinin yield. work, aabzip9 transcription factor been
identified characterized. expression profile aabzip9 revealed 
was clustered artemisinin specific biosynthetic pathway genes ads,
cyp71av1, dbr2, aldh1. furthermore, transiently dual-luc analysis showed 
that activation ads promoter enhanced aabzip9. meanwhile, yeast
one-hybrid assay showed aabzip9 able bind "acgt" cis-element
present ads cyp71av1 promoters. aabzip9 gene driven the
constitutive camv35s promoter glandular trichome specific cyp71av1
promoter stably transformed a. annua plants. transcript level of
aabzip9 increased 35s cyp71av1 driven transgenic plants
compared wild type gus control plants. transgenic a. annua
plants overexpressing aabzip9 showed elevated transcript level ads, the
transcription levels cyp71av1, dbr2, aldh1 significant change in
both types transgenic plants. significantly upregulated ads promoted the
accumulation artemisinin, dihydroartemisinic acid, artemisinic acid
biosynthesis transgenic a. annua plants. results suggest that
aabzip9 positively regulate biosynthesis artemisinin.
