background: control vector-borne diseases important improve human
and animal health worldwide. malaria one world's deadliest diseases and
is caused protozoan parasites genus plasmodium, transmitted
by anopheles spp. mosquitoes. recent evidences using subolesin (sub) akirin
(akr) vaccines showed reduction survival and/or fertility of
blood-sucking ectoparasite vectors infection vector-borne pathogens.
these experiments suggested possibility using akr malaria control.
methods: role akr plasmodium berghei infection fitness and
reproduction main malaria vector, anopheles gambiae characterized by
evaluating effect akr gene knockdown vaccination recombinant
mosquito akr parasite infection levels, fertility mortality female
mosquitoes.
results: gene knockdown rna interference mosquitoes suggested role for
akr mosquito survival fertility. vaccination recombinant aedes
albopictus akr reduced parasite infection mosquitoes fed immunized mice
when compared controls.
conclusions: results showed recombinant akr could used develop
vaccines malaria control. effective, akr-based vaccines could used to
immunize wildlife reservoir hosts and/or humans reduce risk pathogen
transmission. however, vaccines need evaluated field conditions
to characterize effect vector populations pathogen infection and
transmission.
