malaria causes every year half-a-million deaths. emergence parasites 
resistant available treatments makes identification new targets and
their inhibitors urgent task development novel anti-malaria drugs. 
protein kinase ck2 evolutionary-conserved eukaryotic serine/threonine
protein kinase plasmodium falciparum (pfck2) characterized 
promising target chemotherapeutic intervention malaria. we
report crystallographic structure catalytic domain pfck2α (d179s
inactive single mutant) complex atp resolution 3.0 å. compared to
the human enzyme, structure reveals subtly altered atp binding pocket
comprising five substitutions vicinity adenine base, together 
with potential allosteric sites, could exploited design novel inhibitors
specifically targeting plasmodium enzyme. provide evidence dual
autophosphorylation residues thr63 tyr30 pfck2. also show that
