background: myanmar, three types artemisinin-based combination therapy
(act) recommended first-line treatment uncomplicated falciparum
malaria: artemether-lumefantrine (al), artesunate-mefloquine (as + mq), and
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (dp). resistance artemisinins act
partner drugs reported greater mekong sub-region, regular
efficacy monitoring recommended act conducted myanmar. paper
reports results studies monitor efficacy three forms act
in sentinel sites northern myanmar, investigations mutations the
kelch13 (k13) propeller domain.
methods: seven therapeutic efficacy studies conducted 2011-12 2014 in
three sentinel sites myanmar (tamu, muse, tabeikkyin). three studies done
for evaluation al (204 patients), two studies as + mq (119 patients)
and two studies dp (147 patients). studies done according 2009 
standard protocol. polymorphisms k13 propeller domain examined in
dried blood spots collected day 0. primary endpoint adequate clinical 
and parasitological response (acpr) day 28 al day 42 dp and
as + mq, corrected exclude re-infection using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) 
genotyping. safety data collected self-reporting.
results: pcr-corrected acpr 97.2-100% al, 98.6-100% as + mq 100% 
for dp across study sites years. studies found prevalence k13
mutations (>440) 23% day-0 samples. f446i mutation 
common mutation, making 66.0% mutations found. seven nine day-3 
positive patients infected k13 wild type parasites. remaining two
cases day-3 parasitaemia p574l mutation.
conclusions: efficacy al, as + mq dp remains high northern myanmar 
despite widespread evidence k13 mutations associated delayed parasite
clearance. study showed already 2012 high frequency of
k13 mutations myanmar border india. high efficacy the
recommended act gives confidence continued recommendation use of
these treatments myanmar. trial registration numbers actrn12611001245987
(registered 06-12-2011) actrn12614000216617 (registered 28-02-2014).
