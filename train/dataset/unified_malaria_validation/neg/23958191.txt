purpose: atpases, constitute major category ion transporters the
human body, variety significant biological pathological roles.
however, lack high throughput assays atpases significantly limited
drug discovery area. recently found genetic deletion 
the atp dependent calcium pump pmca4 (plasma membrane calcium/calmodulin
dependent atpase, isoform 4) results infertility male mice due a
selective defect sperm motility. addition, recent discoveries humans
have indicated single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) pmca4 gene
determines susceptibility towards malaria plasmodium infection. therefore,
there urgent need develop specific pmca4 inhibitors. current
study, aim optimise validate high throughput screening compatible
assay using recombinantly expressed pmca4 htrf® transcreener® adp
(tr-fret) assay screen drug library.
methods results: pmca4 membrane microsomes prepared hek293 cells
overexpressing pmca4. western blot quantification revealed nearly nine-fold
increased expression pmca4 compared lacz (control virus)-infected cells.
maximal pmca4 microsomal activity achieved tr-fret assay 15ng/μl 
microsomal concentration, 30-minute pre-incubation compounds 37°c, and
calcium buffering 1mm egta providing 1μm free-calcium. finally a
dose-response curve carboxyeosin (a non-specific pmca inhibitor) under
optimised conditions showed significant pmca4 inhibition. upon confirmation 
the assay suitable high-throughput screening, screened the
chembionet small molecule library (~21,000 compounds) pmca4 assay 
identify apparent inhibitors. screening yielded 1,494
primary hits.
conclusions: optimised htrf® transcreener® adp assay for
high-throughput screening identify pmca4 inhibitors. output the
screening campaign provided preliminary chemical starting points could
be developed specific pmca4 inhibitors non-hormonal contraception 
or anti-malaria therapy.
