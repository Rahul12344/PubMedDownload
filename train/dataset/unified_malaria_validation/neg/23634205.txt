recently shown play important roles merozoite egress well 
as merozoite invasion. rodent malaria parasite plasmodium yoelii been
extensively used investigate mechanisms parasite virulence vivo 
a number important proteins identified key contributors

protease-like seras playing potential role virulence. show both
