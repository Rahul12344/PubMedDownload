transposon-based forward reverse genetic technologies contribute greatly
to ongoing efforts study mosquito functional genomics. piggybac
transposon-based enhancer-trap system developed functions efficiently in
the human malaria vector, anopheles stephensi. system consists six
transgenic lines anopheles stephensi, single piggybac-gal4 element
in unique genomic location; six lines single piggybac-uastdtomato
element; two lines, single minos element containing the
piggybac-transposase gene regulatory control hsp70 promoter from
drosophila melanogaster. enhancer detection depended upon efficient
remobilization piggybac-gal4 transposons, contain yeast
transcription factor gene gal4 regulatory control basal promoter. 
gal4 expression detected expression fluorescent protein
gene tdtomato regulatory control promoter gal4-binding uas
elements. five genetic screens larval- adult-specific enhancers, 314
progeny recovered 24,250 total progeny (1.3%) unique patterns of
tdtomato expression arising influence enhancer. frequency of
piggybac remobilization enhancer detection 2.5- 3-fold higher in
female germ lines compared male germ lines. small collection of
enhancer-trap lines described gal4 expression occurred adult
female salivary glands, midgut, fat body, either singly combination.
these three tissues play critical roles infection anopheles
stephensi malaria-causing plasmodium parasites. system lines
generated using valuable resources ongoing mosquito functional
genomics efforts.
