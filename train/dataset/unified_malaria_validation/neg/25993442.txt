mutually exclusive gene expression, whereby one member multi-gene
family selected activation, used malaria parasite plasmodium
falciparum escape human immune system perpetuate long-term, chronic
infections. family genes called var encodes chief antigenic and
virulence determinant p. falciparum malaria. var genes transcribed a
mutually exclusive manner, switching active genes resulting in
antigenic variation. recent work shed considerable light the
epigenetic basis var gene activation silencing, switching is
controlled remains mystery. particular, switching seems random,
but instead appears coordinated result timely activation of
individual genes leading sequential waves antigenically distinct parasite
populations. molecular basis apparent coordination unknown. 
we show var2csa, unusual highly conserved var gene, occupies unique
position within var gene switching hierarchy. induction switching 
the destabilization var specific chromatin using genetic chemical
methods repeatedly led rapid exclusive activation var2csa.
additional experiments demonstrated represent "true" switching events 
and simply de-silencing var2csa promoter, activation is
limited unique locus chromosome 12. combined translational
repression var2csa transcripts, frequent "default" switching locus and
detection var2csa untranslated transcripts non-pregnant individuals, 
data suggest var2csa could play central role coordinating switching,
fulfilling prediction made mathematical models derived population
switching patterns. studies provide first insights mechanisms 
by var gene switching coordinated well example a
pharmacological agent disrupt antigenic variation plasmodium falciparum.
