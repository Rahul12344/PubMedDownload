resistance available antimalarial drugs calls novel compounds
that hit unexploited targets parasite. here, show recently
discovered plasmodium falciparum lactate/proton symporter, pffnt, valid
druggable target, describe new class fluoroalkyl vinylogous acids that
potently block pffnt kill cultured parasites. original compound,
mmv007839, derived malaria box collection potent antimalarials
with unknown targets contains unique internal prodrug principle that
reversibly switches lipophilic transport form polar,
substrate-analogous active form. resistance selection cultured p. falciparum
parasites sub-lethal concentrations mmv007839 produced single
nucleotide exchange pffnt gene; this, functional characterization of
the resulting pffnt g107s validated pffnt novel antimalarial target. from
quantitative structure function relations established compound binding
mode pharmacophore. pharmacophore largely circumvents resistance 
mutation provides basis medicinal chemistry program targets
lactate proton transport new mode antimalarial action.
