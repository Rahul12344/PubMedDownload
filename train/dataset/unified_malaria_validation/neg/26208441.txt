at least 53 distinct isoforms plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance
transporter (pfcrt) protein expressed strains isolates p. falciparum
malarial parasites around globe. parasites exhibit range of
sensitivities chloroquine (cq) drugs. mutant pfcrt believed to
confer cytostatic cq resistance (cqr(cs)) transporting cq away dv
target (free heme released upon hemoglobin digestion). one theory that
variable cq transport catalyzed different pfcrt isoforms responsible 
for range cq sensitivities found p. falciparum. alternatively,
additional mutations drug-selected parasites, additional functions of
pfcrt, might complement pfcrt-mediated cq transport conferring range of
observed resistance phenotypes. distinguish possibilities, we
recently optimized convenient method measuring pfcrt-mediated cq transport,
involving heterologous expression saccharomyces cerevisiae. here, use 
method quantify drug transport activity 45 53 naturally
occurring pfcrt isoforms. data show variable levels cqr likely depend
upon either additional pfcrt functions additional genetic events, including
perhaps changes influence dv membrane potential. data also suggest 
the common k76t pfcrt mutation often used distinguish p. falciparum 
cqr phenotype not, itself, fully reliable indicator cqr status.
