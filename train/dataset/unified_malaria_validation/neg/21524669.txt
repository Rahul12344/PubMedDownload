the parasitic ciliate, ichthyophthirius multifiliis (ich), among most
important protozoan pathogens freshwater fish. ichthyophthirius cannot be
grown cell culture, development effective prophylactic and
therapeutic treatments hampered lack information regarding genes
involved virulence, differentiation growth. help address issue, we
have generated est libraries two major stages parasite life cycle
that infect develop within host tissues. total 25,084 ests were
generated non-normalized libraries prepared polya+ rna infective
theronts host-associated trophonts, respectively. cluster analysis identified
5311 unique transcripts (uniscripts), 2091 contigs 3220
singletons. extrapolation data based rates est discovery suggests
that half expected protein-coding genes i. multifiliis are
represented data. blastx comparisons genbank nr, uniprotkb
(swissprot trembl), well tetrahymena thermophila, plasmodium
falciparum, paramecium tetraurelia protein databases produced 3694
significant (e-value ≤1e(-10)) hits, 1178 annotated using gene
ontology (go) analysis. high proportion uniscripts (63%) showed similarity
to ciliate proteins. combined expression profiling data, go
ontology analysis biological process, cellular component, molecular
function revealed interesting differences gene families expressed two
stages. indeed, abundant transcripts highly stage-specific and
coincided metabolic activities associated stage. work
provides effective genomics resource understanding of
ichthyophthirius biology, lays groundwork identification of
potential drug targets vaccines candidates control this
devastating fish pathogen.
