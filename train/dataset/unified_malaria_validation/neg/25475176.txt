asparagine-linked glycans (n-glycans) medically important protists much
to tell us evolution n-glycosylation n-glycan-dependent
quality control (n-glycan qc) protein folding endoplasmic reticulum.
while host n-glycans built upon dolichol-pyrophosphate-linked precursor
with 14 sugars (glc3man9glcnac2), protist n-glycan precursors vary from
glc3man9glcnac2 (acanthamoeba) man9glcnac2 (trypanosoma) glc3man5glcnac2
(toxoplasma) man5glcnac2 (entamoeba, trichomonas, eimeria) glcnac2
(plasmodium giardia) zero (theileria). related organisms differing
n-glycan lengths (e.g. toxoplasma, eimeria, plasmodium, theileria), the
present n-glycan variation based upon secondary loss alg genes, which
encode enzymes add sugars n-glycan precursor. n-glycan precursor
with man5glcnac2 necessary sufficient n-glycan qc, is
predicted presence udp-glucose:glucosyltransferase (uggt) plus
calreticulin and/or calnexin. many parasites lack glucose n-glycan
precursor, uggt product may identified inhibition glucosidase ii. the
presence armless calnexin toxoplasma suggests secondary loss n-glycan
qc coccidia. positive selection n-glycan sites occurs secreted
proteins organisms n-glycan qc based upon increased likelihood 
of threonine serine +2 position versus asparagine. contrast,
there appears selection n-glycan length plasmodium n-glycan 
site density toxoplasma. finally, suggestive evidence for
n-glycan-dependent erad trichomonas, glycosylates degrades the
exogenous reporter mutant carboxypeptidase (cpy*).
