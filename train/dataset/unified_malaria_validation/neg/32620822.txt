plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein 3 (pvmsp3) encoded multi-gene 
family. these, pvmsp3α, pvmsp3β pvmsp3γ, considered vaccine
targets. despite comprehensive analyses pvmsp3α pvmsp3β, little known
about structural sequence diversity pvmsp3γ. analysis 118 complete
pvmsp3γ sequences diverse endemic areas thailand 9 reported sequences
has shown 86 distinct haplotypes. based variation insert domains, pvmsp3γ
can classified 3 types, i.e. belem, salvador nr520. imperfect
nucleotide repeats found six regions gene; none encoded tandem
amino acid repeats. predicted coiled-coil heptad repeats abundant the
protein displayed variation length location. interspersed phase shifts
occurred heptad arrays may impact protein structure.
polymorphism pvmsp3γ seems generated intragenic recombination and
driven natural selection. p. vivax isolates thailand exhibit
population structure, suggesting limited gene flow across endemic areas.
phylogenetic analysis suggested insert domains could been
subsequently acquired evolution pvmsp3γ. sequence structural
diversity pvmsp3γ may complicate vaccine design due alteration predicted
immunogenic epitopes among variants.
