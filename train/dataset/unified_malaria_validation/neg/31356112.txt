we aimed investigate significant genes associated diabetic nephropathy
(dn), potential mechanisms process dn pathogenesis. we
downloaded microarray data gse111154 gene expression omnibus (geo)
database. first, analyzed differentially expressed genes (degs) early 
diabetic nephropathy (edn) samples nondiabetic control samples. functional
and pathway enrichment analysis carried out. disease-related gene sets were
analyzed. then, constructed protein-protein interaction (ppi) network 
predicted relation. finally, transcriptional regulation analyses microrna 
and transcription factors performed. totally 554 degs edn samples
and nondiabetic control samples obtained. enrichment analysis of
disease-related gene sets showed transforming growth factor beta 1 (tgfb1)
was significantly enriched dn. tgfb1 involved pathways, as
proteoglycans cancer, malaria, amebiasis. furthermore, tgfb1 the
highest degree ppi network. addition, tgfb1 correlated mir-21-5p, 
mir-146a-5p, rad21. tgfb1, mir-146a-5p, mir-21-5p important dn
development. furthermore, tgfb1 may involved dn progression the
regulation mir-21-5p, mir-146a-5p, rad21.
