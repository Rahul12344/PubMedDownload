the development human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum controlled
by coordinated changes gene expression throughout complex life cycle, 
the corresponding regulatory mechanisms incompletely understood. study the
relationship genome architecture gene regulation plasmodium, we
assayed genome architecture p. falciparum three time points 
erythrocytic (asexual) cycle. using chromosome conformation capture coupled 
next-generation sequencing technology (hi-c), obtained high-resolution
chromosomal contact maps, used construct consensus
three-dimensional genome structure time point. observed strong
clustering centromeres, telomeres, ribosomal dna, virulence genes,
resulting complex architecture cannot explained simple volume
exclusion model. internal virulence gene clusters exhibit domain-like structures 
in contact maps, suggesting play important role genome
architecture. midway erythrocytic cycle, highly
transcriptionally active trophozoite stage, genome adopts open
chromatin structure increased chromosomal intermingling. addition, we
observed reduced expression genes located spatial proximity the
repressive subtelomeric center, colocalization distinct groups of
parasite-specific genes coordinated expression profiles. overall, our
results indicative strong association p. falciparum spatial 
genome organization gene expression. understanding molecular processes
involved genome conformation dynamics could contribute discovery of
novel antimalarial strategies.
