introduction: glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency most
common enzymopathy relatively high frequency malaria-endemic regions.
in eritrea, scanty knowledge g6pd deficiency. aim study
was characterize determine prevalence four common g6pd allelic
variants.
methods: three hundred fourteen dried blood spot samples unrelated
microscopically diagnosed malaria patient eritrean ethnic groups living five
zobas (regions) eritrea analysed pcr-rflp method identify g6pd 
b, g6pd (a376g), g6pd a-(g202a), g6pd mediterranean (c563t) variants. to
confirm rflp results, samples positive a376g negative g202a
variants subjected sanger sequencing subset pcr products (exon
5) directly sequenced identify a376g mutations.
results: g6pd genotyping, g6pd b detected 87.5% a376g detected 
12.5% malaria patients, whereas g202a c563t absent. bivariate
statistical analysis showed statistically significant association g6pd 
genotypes zoba (p < 0.004 < 0.05). sequencing revealed expected a376g
variant. exon 5, four common (a376g) mutations, three uncommon mutations
rs782669677 (535g→a) one potentially new mutation (451g→c), relative the
reference, mrna nm_001042351 detected. bioinformatic analysis these
mutations' potential functional impact suggests minimal effect protein
function.
conclusion: first report indicating g6pd b g6pd genotypes 
are prevalent eritrea. similar findings reported neighboring
countries. studies including phenotype analysis needed corroborate
the observed results.
