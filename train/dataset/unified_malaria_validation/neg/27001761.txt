nearly half world's population risk malaria. increasing drug
resistance intensified need novel therapeutics, including treatments 
with intrinsic transmission-blocking properties. study, demonstrate
that isoprenoid abscisic acid (aba) modulates signaling mammalian host
to reduce parasitemia formation transmissible gametocytes the
mosquito host reduce parasite infection. oral aba supplementation mouse
model malaria well tolerated led reduced pathology enhanced
gene expression liver spleen consistent infection recovery. oral 
aba supplementation also increased mouse plasma aba levels signal 
the mosquito midgut upon blood ingestion. accordingly, showed that
supplementation plasmodium falciparum-infected blood meal aba increased
expression mosquito nitric oxide synthase reduced infection prevalence 
a nitric oxide-dependent manner. identification mechanisms whereby aba
reduces parasite growth mammals mosquitoes could shed light balance
of immunity metabolism across eukaryotes provide strong foundation 
clinical translation.
