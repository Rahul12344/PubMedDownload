uncomplicated resolves time; however, 1% cases, almost
exclusively among young children, malaria becomes severe life threatening,
resulting nearly 700,000 deaths year africa alone. among most
severe complications plasmodium falciparum infection cerebral malaria 
a fatality rate 15 20%, despite treatment antimalarial drugs. cerebral
malaria takes second toll african children, leaving survivors high risk
of debilitating neurological defects. present, effective adjunctive
therapies cerebral malaria, developing therapies would large 
impact saving young lives africa. report results open new
avenue development highly selective adjunctive therapies cerebral 
malaria targeting pathways regulate host parasite metabolism.
