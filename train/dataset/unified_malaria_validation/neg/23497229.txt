background: artesunate plus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (as+sp) first-line 
treatment plasmodium falciparum infection several south asian countries,
including afghanistan. molecular studies provide sensitive means investigate
the current state drug susceptibility sp component, also
provide information likely efficacy potential forms of
artemisinin-combination therapy.
methods: years 2007 2010, 120 blood spots patients p.
falciparum malaria obtained four provinces afghanistan. pcr-based
methods used detect drug-resistance mutations dhfr, dhps, pfcrt and
pfmdr1, well determine copy number pfmdr1.
results: majority (95.5%) infections double mutation dhfr
gene (c59r, s108n); mutations dhfr positions 16, 51 164 seen. 
isolates wild type across dhps gene, five isolates the
provinces kunar nangarhar eastern afghanistan triple mutation
a437g / k540e / a581g; five cases successfully treated three
receiving as+sp two receiving dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. isolates
showed pfcrt svnmt chloroquine resistance haplotype. five 79 isolates 
the pfmdr1 n86y mutation, 52 pfmdr1 y184f; positions 1034, 1042 and
1246 wild type isolates. pfmdr1 gene amplified any
sample.
conclusions: study indicates shortly adoption as+sp as
first-line treatment afghanistan, parasites double mutation
haplotype dhfr, small number isolates eastern afghanistan
harboured triple mutation haplotype dhps. impact mutations on
the efficacy as+sp remains assessed significant numbers patients, 
but results clearly concerning since suggest higher degree sp
resistance previously detected. focused molecular clinical
studies region urgently required.
