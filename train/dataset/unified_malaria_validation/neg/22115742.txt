erythrocytes infected malaria parasites increased permeability ions 
and various nutrient solutes, mediated parasite ion channel known the
plasmodial surface anion channel (psac). parasite clag3 gene family encodes
psac activity, may also additional unidentified components this
channel. consistent lack clag3 homology genes ion channels,
psac number unusual functional properties. here, report psac
exhibits unusual form voltage-dependent inactivation. inactivation was
readily detected whole-cell patch-clamp configuration steps to
negative membrane potentials. fraction current inactivates, its
kinetics, rate recovery voltage-dependent, though a
modest effective valence (0.7Â±0.1 elementary charges). properties 
affected solution composition charge carrier, suggesting inactivation
intrinsic channel protein. intriguingly, inactivation absent in
cell-attached recordings took several minutes appear obtaining the
whole-cell configuration, suggesting interactions soluble cytosolic
components. inactivation could also largely abolished application of
intracellular, extracellular protease. findings implicate
inactivation via charged cytoplasmic channel domain. domain may be
tethered one soluble intracellular components physiological
conditions.
