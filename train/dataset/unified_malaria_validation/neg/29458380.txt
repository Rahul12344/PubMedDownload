background: artemisinin-based combination therapy first-line anti-malarial
treatment uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum infection angola. date,
the prevalence polymorphisms pfk13 gene, associated artemisinin
resistance, pfmdr1, associated lumefantrine resistance, been
systematically studied angola.
methods: dna isolated pretreatment late treatment failure dried
blood spots collected 2015 round therapeutic efficacy studies in
benguela, lunda sul, zaire provinces angola. pfk13 propeller domain
and pfmdr1 gene sequenced analysed polymorphisms. pfmdr1 copy number
variation assessed using real-time pcr method. association between
pfmdr1 pfk13 mutations treatment failure investigated.
results: majority pretreatment (99%, 466/469) late treatment
failure (100%, 50/50) samples wild type pfk13. three pretreatment
samples (1%) carried a578s mutation commonly observed africa not
associated artemisinin resistance. 543 pretreatment day late
treatment failure samples successfully analysed pfmdr1 copy number variation 
carried one copy pfmdr1. nyd haplotype predominant pfmdr1
haplotype, present 63% (308/491) pretreatment samples, followed nfd,
which present 32% (157/491) pretreatment samples. pfmdr1 n86 allele
was overrepresented day late treatment failure samples participants
receiving artemether-lumefantrine (p value 0.03).
conclusions: pretreatment parasites patients participating therapeutic 
efficacy studies 2015 angola's three sentinel sites showed genetic evidence
of susceptibility artemisinins, consistent clinical outcome data showing 
greater 99% day 3 clearance rates. lack increased pfmdr1 copy number 
is consistent previous reports sub-saharan africa. although pfmdr1 nyd 
and nfd haplotypes overrepresented artemether-lumefantrine late treatment
failure samples, role markers resistance unclear given these
haplotypes also present majority successfully treated patients 
the artemether-lumefantrine treatment arms.
