understanding mechanisms cd4 memory cell (tmem) differentiation in
malaria critical vaccine development. however, metabolic regulation of
cd4 tmem differentiation clear, particularly persistent infections. 
this study, investigated role fatty acid synthesis (fas) tmem
development plasmodium chabaudi chronic mouse malaria infection. show 
t cell-specific deletion early pharmaceutical inhibition acetyl coa
carboxylase 1, rate limiting step fas, inhibit generation early memory 
precursor effector cells (mpec). compare role fas early
differentiation survival tmem chronic infection, specific inhibitor of
acetyl coa carboxylase 1, 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid, administered at
different times postinfection. strikingly, number tmem reduced
when fas inhibited cell priming tmem survival
phase. fas inhibition priming increased effector cell (teff)
proliferation strongly decreased peak parasitemia, consistent with
improved teff function. conversely, mpec decreased, cell-intrinsic
manner, upon early fas inhibition chronic, acute, infection. early
cure infection also increased mitochondrial volume tmem compared teff,
supporting previous reports acute infection. demonstrate the
mpec-specific effect due higher fatty acid content synthesis in
mpec compared terminally differentiated teff. conclusion, fas cd4 t
cells regulates early divergence tmem teff chronic infection.
