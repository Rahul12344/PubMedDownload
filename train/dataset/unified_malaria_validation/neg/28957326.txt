plasmodium parasites, along piroplasm relatives, caused
malaria-like illnesses terrestrial mammals millions years. several
plasmodium-protective alleles recently evolved human populations, but
little known host adaptation blood parasites deeper evolutionary
timescales. work, analyze mammalian adaptation ~500 plasmodium- 
piroplasm- interacting proteins (ppips) manually curated scientific
literature. show (i) ppips enriched immune functions and
pleiotropy pathogens, (ii) rate adaptation across mammals
is significantly elevated ppips, compared carefully matched control
proteins. ppips high pathogen pleiotropy show strongest signatures of
adaptation, pattern fully explained immune enrichment.
several pieces evidence suggest blood parasites specifically imposed
selection ppips. first, even non-immune ppips lack interactions with
other pathogens adapted twice rate matched controls. second, ppip 
adaptation linked high expression liver, critical organ the
parasite life cycle. finally, detailed investigation alpha-spectrin, a
major red blood cell membrane protein, shows domains particularly high 
rates adaptation known interact specifically p. falciparum. 
overall, show host proteins interact plasmodium piroplasm
parasites experienced elevated rates adaptation across mammals, and
provide evidence adaptation likely driven blood
parasites.
