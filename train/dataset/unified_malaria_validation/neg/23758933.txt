countries among 22 hiv testing rate pregnant women less than
20%. currently, pregnant women must access healthcare facility (hf) 
screened receive available prevention mother-to-child hiv transmission
(pmtct) interventions. finding new approaches increase hiv testing among
pregnant women necessary realize who/ president's emergency plan for

methods: cluster randomized trial tests comparative effectiveness a
congregation-based healthy beginning initiative (hbi) versus clinic-based
approach rates hiv testing pmtct completion among cohort of

and participants (in order), randomization occurs church
level. trial unblinded, churches informed their

testing participants' knowledge healthy pregnancy habits addition hiv
acquisition modes, effective pmtct interventions. baby receptions provide a
contact point follow-up delivery. approach designed reduce 
barriers screening including knowledge, access, cost stigma. primary
aim evaluate effect hbi hiv testing rate among pregnant
women. secondary aims evaluate effect hbi rate hiv
testing among male partners pregnant women rate pmtct completion
among hiv-infected pregnant women.
