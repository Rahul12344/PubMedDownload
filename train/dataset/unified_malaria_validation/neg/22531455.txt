background: aim study investigate cytochrome p450 2c8*2
(cyp2c8*2) distribution allele frequency three populations west and
east africa exposed plasmodium falciparum malaria. cyp2c8 enzyme involved
in metabolism anti-malarials amodiaquine chloroquine. presence
of cyp2c8*2 defective allele recently associated higher rate of
chloroquine-resistant malaria parasites.
methods: total 503 young subjects genotyped single nucleotide
polymorphism rs11572103 (a/t). eighty-eight southern senegal, 262 
eastern uganda 153 southern madagascar. pcr-rflp technique used 
to discriminate wild-type (a) defective allele (t).
results: cyp2c8*2 (t) allele frequency 0.222 ± 0.044 detected in
senegal, 0.105 ± 0.019 uganda 0.150 ± 0.029 madagascar.
conclusions: study demonstrated cyp2c8*2 allele widespread in
africa. allele occurs different frequency west east africa, 
higher senegal uganda madagascar. data indicate an
important fraction populations analysed decreased enzymatic
activity, thus higher risk drug accumulation two possible
consequences: i) exacerbation drug-associated adverse side effects; ii) 
increase drug-resistance selection pressure p. falciparum parasites.
