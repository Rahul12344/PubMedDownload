background: tumor necrosis factor (tnf) pleiotropic functions the
demyelinating autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis (ms) murine model
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (eae). tnf regulates disability
during progressive disease remains unresolved. using progressive eae model
characterized sustained tnf increasing morbidity, study evaluates the
role unregulated tnf exacerbating central nervous system (cns) pathology
and inflammation.
methods: progressive ms mimicked myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (mog)
peptide immunization mice expressing dominant negative ifn-γ receptor alpha 
chain human glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter (gfapγr1∆).
diseased gfapγr1∆ mice treated anti-tnf control monoclonal antibody 
during acute disease monitor therapeutic effects sustained disability,
demyelination, cns inflammation, blood brain barrier (bbb) permeability.
results: tnf specifically sustained infiltrating macrophages. anti-tnf
treatment decreased established clinical disability mortality rate within 7
days. control disease progression associated decline myelin loss
and leukocyte infiltration, well macrophage activation. addition to
mitigating cns inflammation, tnf neutralization restored bbb integrity and
enhanced cns anti-inflammatory responses.
conclusions: sustained tnf production infiltrating macrophages associated with
progressive eae exacerbates disease severity promoting inflammation and
disruption bbb integrity, thereby counteracting establishment an
anti-inflammatory environment required disease remission.
