for species risk extinction, parasites would expected to
face similar fate. cases, time running efforts identify
and study parasitic fauna gone. surveyed the
hemoparasite fauna 50 black-chested, spiny-tailed iguanas (ctenosaura
melanosterna), critically-endangered species, island coast of
honduras. blood samples captured animals tested hemoparasites by
thin blood smear molecular analyses. based microscopy, two parasites 
identified, plasmodium sp. 14% iguanas hepatozoon sp. 32%. for
both parasites, parasitemia levels <0.1%. prevalence parasitemias of
hepatozoon declined increasing host size, pattern differing most
prior studies saurian reptiles. subset iguanas with
microscopy-confirmed plasmodium infections, sequence analysis 454â€‰bp the
cytochrome b gene indicated plasmodium species distinct known
plasmodium closely related p. chiricahuae (96.5% similarity)
followed p. mexicanum (95.8% similarity). efforts amplify hepatozoon
parasite using pcr successful. additional surveys studies this
host-parasite system would valuable, science management 
this endangered animal.
