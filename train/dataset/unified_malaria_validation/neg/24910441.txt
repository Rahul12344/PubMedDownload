carboxypeptidases digestive enzymes cleave single amino acid
residue c-terminus protein. digestive carboxypeptidase gene
regulatory elements insects shown efficiency drive midgut
specific expression transgenic mosquitoes. however endogenous promoter 
been reported indian malaria vector anopheles culicifacies major
vector indian subcontinent. report cloning carboxypeptidase gene 
in an. culicifacies including 5' upstream regions named accp. in
the upstream region gene arthropod initiator sequence two repeat
sequences particular importance ttatc gtttt also identified. 
1290 base pairs open reading frame encodes protein 48.5kda. coding
region gene shares 82% 72% similarity nucleotide level with
anopheles gambiae ae. aegypti carboxypeptidase gene, respectively. peak
expression gene found 3h blood feeding is
limited midgut only. based protein sequence, 3d structure accp
was predicted active centre enzyme predicted consist gln
183, glu 186, 308 ser 309 amino acid residues. comparison protein 
sequence among different genera revealed conservation zinc binding
residues. phylogenetically, accp found closely related an. gambiae.
