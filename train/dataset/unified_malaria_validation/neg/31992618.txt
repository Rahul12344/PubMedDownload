new antimalarial drugs needed. benzoxaborole an13762 showed excellent
activity cultured plasmodium falciparum, fresh ugandan p.
falciparum isolates, murine malaria models. gain mechanistic insights, 
we selected vitro p. falciparum isolates resistant an13762. of
11 independent selections 100 200 nm an13762, 50% inhibitory
concentration (ic50) increased 18-118 nm 180-890 nm, whole-genome
sequencing resistant parasites demonstrated mutations prodrug activation
and resistance esterase (pfpare). introduction pfpare mutations led a
similar level resistance, recombinant pfpare hydrolyzed an13762 the
benzoxaborole an10248, activity similar an13762 for
which selection resistance readily achieved. parasites further
selected micromolar concentrations an13762 developed higher-level
resistance (ic50, 1.9 5.0 μm), sequencing revealed additional mutations in
any 5 genes, 4 associated ubiquitination/sumoylation enzyme
cascades; introduction one mutations, sumo-activating enzyme
subunit 2, led similar level resistance. gene mutated highly
resistant parasites encodes p. falciparum cleavage specificity factor
homolog pfcpsf3, previously identified antimalarial target another
benzoxaborole. parasites selected resistance an13762 cross-resistant 
with close analog, an13956, standard antimalarials, an10248, or
other benzoxaboroles known different p. falciparum targets. thus, an13762
appears novel mechanism antimalarial action multiple mechanisms 
of resistance, including loss function pfpare preventing activation to
an10248, followed alterations ubiquitination/sumoylation pathways or
pfcpsf3.importance benzoxaboroles study potential new drugs treat
malaria. one benzoxaborole, an13762, potent activity promising features, 
but mechanisms action resistance unknown. gain insights into
these mechanisms, cultured malaria parasites nonlethal concentrations 
an13762 generated parasites varied levels resistance. parasites 
low-level resistance mutations pfpare, processes an13762 an
active metabolite; pfpare mutations prevented processing. parasites with
high-level resistance mutations number enzymes, mostly those
involved stress responses. parasites selected an13762 resistance 
resistant antimalarials, suggesting novel mechanisms action and
resistance an13762, valuable feature new class antimalarial drugs.
