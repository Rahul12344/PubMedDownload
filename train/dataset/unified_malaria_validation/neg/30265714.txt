sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) used malaria chemoprophylaxis pregnant
women children ghana. plasmodium falciparum resistance sp linked 
mutations dihydropteroate synthase gene (pfdhps), dihydrofolate reductase 
gene (pfdhfr) amplification gtp cyclohydrolase 1 (pfgch1) gene. pfgch1
duplication associated pfdhfr l164, crucial mutant high level
pyrimethamine resistance rare ghana. presence amplified pfgch1
in ghanaian isolates could indicator evolution l164 mutant.
this study therefore determined pfgch1 copy number variations sp
resistance mutations clinical isolates ghana. one hundred ninety-two 
(192) blood samples collected children aged â‰¤14 years uncomplicated
malaria 2013-14 2015-16 used. quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction (qrt-pcr) used detect pfgch1 copy number nested
pcr-sanger sequencing used detect mutations pfdhps pfdhfr genes. twelve
parasites (6.3%) harbored double copies pfgch1 gene 192
samples. 12, 75% pfdhfr i51-r59-n108, 92% pfdhps g437
mutant, 8% pfdhps e540 67% sp resistance haplotype irng. no
l164 detected samples amplified pfgch1. rare t108 mutant
associated cycloguanil resistance showed predominance (60%) n108 the
2015-16 isolates. observation parasites increased copy number of
pfgch1 gene indicative future evolution rare quadruple pfdhfr
mutant, i51-r59-n108-l164, ghanaian parasites. mutant pfdhps isolates also had
increased gch1 copy number suggestive may also facilitate sulphadoxine
resistance. selection parasites pfgch1 gene amplification will
enhance sustenance persistence parasites sp resistance the
country. policy makers need begin search replacement
chemoprophylaxis drug malaria vulnerable groups ghana.
