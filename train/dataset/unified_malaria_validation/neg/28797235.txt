background: henan province malaria elimination stage, all
reports disease imported since 2012 90% coming africa.
surveillance population studies essential early detection and
subsequent prevention spread drug resistance. k13-propeller gene
was recently identified proposed molecular marker artemisinin (art)
resistance. study, detected mutations k13-propeller gene in
samples taken imported malaria cases henan province 2012 2015.
methods: 483 samples obtained plasmodium
falciparum-infected malaria migrant workers returned henan province from
africa 2012 2015. single nucleotide polymorphisms the
k13-propeller gene assessed nested pcr dna sequencing. frequency and
geographic difference k13-propeller gene mutant types analyzed.
results: 483 patients, 476 cured 7 died. k13-propeller 
mutations blood samples 7 patients died, 23
different genotypes k13-propeller observed 24 (4.97%) 
samples. c580y, predominant one resistance art, not
detected samples, r539t p574l also associated with
art resistance, observed two samples angola equatorial guinea.
no mutations detected 11 samples north africa. frequency 
k13-propeller 6.50% (8/123) central africa, followed east africa (1/19,
5.26%), west africa (9/198, 4.55%) south africa (6/132, 4.55%). 
significant difference among four areas (p = 0.795).
conclusion: r539t p574l found migrant workers traveled from
africa henan province, although frequency k13-propeller mutants was
low. data may enrich molecular surveillance antimalarial resistance 
and helpful developing updating antimalarial policy henan 
province.
