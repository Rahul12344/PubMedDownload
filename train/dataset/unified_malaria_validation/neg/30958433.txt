background: era precision medicine, chemotherapy still considered
the cornerstone treatment lung cancer patients without gene mutations. how
to reduce toxicity increase efficiency chemotherapy worth
exploring. study aimed investigate curative effects safety of
hyperthermia combined chemotherapy (hct) advanced patients with
non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc), especially malignant pleural
effusion.
methods: retrospectively evaluated medical records 93 patients with
advanced nsclc (stage iiib-iv) march 2011 january 2014. patients were
divided hct chemotherapy (ct) groups. hct group treated with
gemcitabine cisplatin (gp) regimen combined regional radiofrequency deep
hyperthermia, ct group treated gp regimen only. with
malignant pleural effusion extra underwent thoracentesis intrapleural
injection chemotherapy combined hyperthermic not. clinical treatment
results adverse reactions compared analyzed treatment. spss
19.0 software (spss inc., usa) used statistical data processing. p values
less 0.05 accepted statistically significant.
results: among 93 patients, hct group included 48 patients (16 patients 
malignant pleural effusion), ct group included 45 patients (10 patients with
malignant pleural effusion). significant difference two 
groups patient characteristics. overall response rate (orr) pleural
effusions much better hct group ct group (81.2% vs. 40.0%,
p = 0.046). patients hct group lower incidence rate weakness (12.5%
vs. 46.7%, χ = 13.16, p < 0.001) gastrointestinal (25.0% vs. 77.8%,
χ = 25.88, p < 0.001) adverse reactions ct group. objective
tumor response survival showed significant differences.
conclusions: hyperthermia combined chemotherapy might lead the
development better therapeutic strategy advanced nsclc malignant
pleural effusion patients. also, could greatly reduce chemotherapy toxic
effects incidence weakness gastrointestinal adverse reactions in
advanced nsclc patients.
