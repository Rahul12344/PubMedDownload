drug-resistant plasmodium falciparum major threat global malaria control 
and elimination efforts. botswana, southern african country approaching
malaria elimination, p. falciparum molecular data available. parasites
were assessed pollymerase chain reaction (pcr) confirmation of
positive rapid diagnostic tests, multiplicity infection (moi), drug
resistance markers among isolates clinical uncomplicated malaria cases
collected health facilities. 211 dried blood spot samples selected 
study, 186 (88.2%) pcr positive p. falciparum. mean moi based on
msp1 genotyping 2.3 associated age. high prevalence of
wild-type parasites pfcrt pfmdr1 found, haplotype frequency
(k76/n86) 88.8% 17.7% isolates two copies pfmdr1
gene. pfatpase6, parasites carried wild-type s769 allele.
sequencing showed evidence non-synonymous mutations associated reduced
artemisinin derivative sensitivity p. falciparum k13 gene. conclusion, 
we found p. falciparum parasites botswana mostly wild type the
drug resistance markers evaluated. yet, high rate molecular
marker associated reduced sensitivity lumefantrine. results indicate
the need systematic drug efficacy surveillance complement malaria
elimination efforts.
