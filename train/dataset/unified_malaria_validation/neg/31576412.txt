key message: blue yellow light affected metabolism morphology. blue
and red promote doxp/mep pathway. ads gene expression increased plants
cultivated blue, promoting artemisinin content. artemisinin-based
combination therapies effective treatment highly lethal malaria.
artemisinin produced small quantities glandular trichomes of
artemisia annua l. aim evaluate effect light quality a.
annua cultivated vitro different light qualities, considering anatomical
and morphological changes, volatile composition, artemisinin content 
expression two key enzymes artemisinin biosynthesis. yellow light is
related increase number glandular trichomes seemed to
positively affect molecular diversity a. annua. yellow light-stimulated
glandular trichome frequency without triggered area enhancement, whereas blue
light stimulated parameters. blue light enhanced thickness leaf
epidermis. b-promoting effect due increased cell size to
increased cell numbers. green yellow light positively influenced volatile
diversity plantlets. nevertheless, blue red light seemed promote
the doxp/mep pathway, red light stimulates mva pathway. amorpha-4,11-diene 
synthase gene expression significantly increased plants cultivated under
blue light, red light, promoting artemisinin content. results showed 
that light quality, specifically blue yellow light, positively affected 
secondary metabolism morphology plantlets. seemed steps prior 
to last one artemisinin biosynthesis pathway could strongly
influenced blue light. work provides alternative method increase the
amount artemisinin production a. annua without use transgenic
plants, employment blue light.
