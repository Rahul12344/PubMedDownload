red blood cells (rbcs) known function refuge providing food
resources shelter host's immune system malaria
parasite (plasmodium) infection. recent studies reported significant
production extracellular vesicles (microparticles, mps) circulation 
malaria patients. however, unclear extracellular vesicles are
generated biological functions are. study, isolated the
mps culture medium normal rbcs malaria parasite-infected rbcs
(irbcs), compared quantity origins, profiled mirnas deep
sequencing. found much larger number mps released culture irbcs
than culture normal rbcs. investigation indicated that, in
these mps, human argonaute 2 (hago2) found bind hundreds mirnas.
these hago2-mirna complexes transferred parasites, the
expression essential malaria antigen, pfemp1, downregulated by
mir-451/140 binding b subgroups var genes, family
of genes encoding pfemp1. data suggest first time that, the
release mps, mature rbcs present innate resistance malaria infection.
these studies also shed new light reason rbcs' genetic mutation occurs
mainly populations living intensive malaria endemic areas the
possibility using mirnas novel medicines malaria patients.
