the susceptibility anopheles mosquitoes plasmodium infections relies on
complex interactions insect vector malaria parasite. number
of studies shown mosquito innate immune responses play important
role controlling malaria infection strength parasite
clearance genetic control, little known influence of
environmental factors transmission success. present evidence 
the composition vector gut microbiota one major components 
determine outcome mosquito infections. a. gambiae mosquitoes collected 
natural breeding sites cameroon experimentally challenged wild
p. falciparum isolate, gut bacterial content submitted for
pyrosequencing analysis. meta-taxogenomic approach revealed broader
richness midgut bacterial flora previously described. unexpectedly,
the majority bacterial species found small proportion of
mosquitoes, 20 genera shared 80% individuals. show that
observed differences gut bacterial flora adult mosquitoes result of
breeding distinct sites, suggesting native aquatic source where
larvae grown determines composition midgut microbiota.
importantly, abundance enterobacteriaceae mosquito midgut
correlates significantly plasmodium infection status. striking
relationship highlights role natural gut environment parasite
transmission. deciphering microbe-pathogen interactions offers new perspectives
to control disease transmission.
