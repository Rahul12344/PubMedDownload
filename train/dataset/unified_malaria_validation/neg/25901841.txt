as newly developed assay detection endogenous enzyme activity the
single-catalytic-event level, rolling circle enhanced enzyme activity detection
(reead) used measure enzyme activity single human cells and
malaria-causing parasites, plasmodium sp. current reead assays rely organic
dye-tagged linear dna probes report rolling circle amplification products 
(rcps), cost may hinder widespread use reead. show
that new class activatable probes, nanocluster beacons (ncbs), simplify 
the reead assays. easily prepared without need purification capable
of large fluorescence enhancement upon hybridization, ncbs cost-effective and
sensitive. compared conventional fluorescent probes, ncbs also more
photostable. demonstrated reporting human topoisomerases (htopi)
cleavage-ligation reaction, proposed ncbs suggest read-out format
attractive future reead-based diagnostics.
