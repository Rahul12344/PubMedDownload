the genetic diversity glutamate-rich protein (glurp) r2 region plasmodium
falciparum isolates collected 12 years introduction of
artemisinin combination treatment malaria osogbo, osun state, nigeria, 
compared study. blood samples collected filter paper 2004 
2015 febrile children ages 1-12 years. r2 region glurp gene 
was genotyped using nested polymerase chain reaction nucleotide
sequencing. all, 12 glurp alleles observed total 199 samples
collected two study years. multiplicity infection (moi) marginally 
increased two study years; however, differences statistically
insignificant (2004 samples moi = 1.23 versus 2015 samples moi = 1.47). some
alleles stable prevalence, whereas two glurp alleles, viii xi, 
showed considerable variability years. variability was
replicated glurp sequences regions compared ours. the
expected heterozygosity (he) values (he = 0.87) identical two
groups. high variability rearrangement amino acid repeat units in
the r2 region observed, amino acid repeat sequence
dknekgqheiveveeilpe prevalent years, compared two other
repeat sequences observed study. parasite population characterized 
this study displayed extensive genetic diversity. detailed genetic profile of
the glurp r2 region potential help guide epidemiological
studies aimed toward rational design novel chemotherapies are
antagonistic toward malaria.
