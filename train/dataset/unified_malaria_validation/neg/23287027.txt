the emergence spread plasmodium falciparum resistant commonly used 
anti-malarial drugs major challenge control elimination of
malaria. present study provides information genetic analysis multidrug 
resistance 1 (pfmdr1) (n86y/y184f/s1034c/n1042d/f1226y/d1246y) multidrug
resistance protein 1 (pfmrp1) (h191y/s437a/i876v/f1390i/k1466r) genes are
probably associated artemisinin well chloroquine resistance
transporter (pfcrt) 76t p. falciparum clinical isolates (n=200) exposed to
artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) 4years adoption iran.
also, copy number pfmdr1 gene screened association pfmdr1
mutations incriminate artemisinin resistance. using nested pcr-rflp and
sequencing analysis, none samples mutation codons 1034, 1042,
1226 1246 pfmdr1, 86y 184f mutations detected 46% 2%
of examined samples, respectively. also, significant difference was
identified among analyzed samples collected (baseline, 2002-2005) and
after adoption act (2007-2010) (p>0.05). pfmrp1 gene, mutations at
positions 191y (76.5%), 437a (69.5%), 876v (64.5%) 1390i (17%) detected 
and samples displayed mutation codon 1466r. total, 42.5% examined
isolates carried pfmdr1 86y pfcrt 76t none parasites
simultaneously harbored pfcrt 76t, pfmdr1 86y, 184f pfmrp1 191y, 437a, 876v, 
1390i mutations. addition, copy number pfmdr1 gene (n = 1) similar 
as sensitive isolate, 3d7, artemisinin. summary, none potential
mutations associated artemisinin derivatives resistance was
significantly changed 4years adoption act iran.
