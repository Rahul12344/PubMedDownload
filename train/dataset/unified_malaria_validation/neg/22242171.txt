malaria largest impact infectious disease shaping human
genome, exerting enormous selective pressure genes improve survival in
severe malaria infections. modern humans originated africa lost skin
melanization migrated temperate regions globe. although is
well documented loss melanization improved cutaneous vitamin synthesis,
melanin plays evolutionary ancient role insect immunity malaria in
some instances melanin implicated play immunoregulatory role in
vertebrates. thus, tested hypothesis melanization may protective
in malaria infections using mouse models. congenic c57bl/6 mice differed
only gene encoding tyrosinase, key enzyme synthesis melanin,
showed difference clinical course infection plasmodium yoelii
17xl, causes severe anemia, plasmodium berghei anka, causes severe
cerebral malaria plasmodium chabaudi causes uncomplicated chronic
disease. moreover, neither genetic deficiencies vitamin synthesis nor
vitamin supplementation effect survival cerebral malaria. taken
together, results indicate neither melanin vitamin production
improve survival severe malaria.
