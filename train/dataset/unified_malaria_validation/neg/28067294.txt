the principal afrotropical human malaria vector mosquito, anopheles gambiae,
remains significant threat global health. critical component the
transmission malaria ability an. gambiae females detect and
respond human-derived chemical kairomones search blood meal
hosts. basis host odor responses resides olfactory receptor neurons
(orns) express chemoreceptors encoded large gene families, including 
odorant receptors (ors) variant ionotropic receptors (irs). ors
have focus extensive investigation, functional ir complexes the
chemical compounds activate identified an. gambiae.
here report transcriptional profiles functional characterization of
three an. gambiae ir (agir) complexes specifically respond amines or
carboxylic acids - two classes semiochemicals implicated in
mediating host-seeking adult females known activate an. gambiae
ors (agors). results suggest agirs play critical roles detection 
and behavioral responses important classes host odors are
underrepresented agor chemical space.
