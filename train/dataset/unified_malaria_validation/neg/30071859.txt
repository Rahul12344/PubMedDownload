background: 8-aminoquinolines primaquine clear mature plasmodium
falciparum gametocytes responsible transmission human to
mosquitoes bring radical cure plasmodium vivax clearing dormant liver
stages. deployment primaquine thus relevance malaria elimination
efforts challenged widespread prevalence glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase deficiency (g6pdd) endemic countries since primaquine g6pdd
individuals may lead acute haemolysis. study, prevalence g6pdd 
was investigated different settings ethiopia using phenotyping and
genotyping approaches.
methods: community school based cross-sectional surveys conducted from
october december 2016 four administrative regions (gambela, benishangul
gumuz, oromia, amhara) ethiopia. finger prick blood samples collected
for g6pd enzyme activity using carestartâ„¢ g6pd screening test genotyping 
of 36 selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) located g6pd gene
and flanking regions.
results: overall, prevalence phenotypic g6pdd 1.4% (22/1609). 
first time ethiopian population, african variant (a-) detected 
3.5% (7/199) limited set genotyped samples, all
phenotypically normal. interestingly, individuals variation at
the rs2515904 locus. strong geographical variation observed both
phenotypic genotypic g6pdd; three-quarters phenotypically g6pdd
individuals detected gambela.
conclusion: low prevalence g6pdd detected present study
populations. presence a- variant alongside g6pd mutants 
patchy distribution g6pdd indicate larger studies specifically designed
to unravel distribution g6pdd small geographical scale may needed to
tailor malaria elimination efforts ethiopia local context.
