endemic countries increasingly adopting molecular tools efficient typing,
identification surveillance malaria parasites vector mosquitoes, 
as integral part control programs. sustainable establishment of
these accurate approaches operations research strengthen malaria control
and elimination efforts, simple affordable methods, parsimonious reagent
and equipment requirements essential. present simple chelex-based
technique extracting malaria parasite vector dna field collected
mosquito specimens. morphologically identified 72 anopheles gambiae sl. from
156 mosquitoes captured pyrethrum spray catches sleeping rooms of
households within 2,000 km(2) vicinity malaria institute macha. after
dissection separate head thorax abdomen 72 anopheles 
gambiae sl. mosquitoes, two sections individually placed 1.5 ml
microcentrifuge tubes submerged 20 μl deionized water. using sterile 
pipette tip, mosquito section separately homogenized uniform
suspension deionized water. ensuing homogenate mosquito
section, 10 μl retained 10 μl transferred separate
autoclaved 1.5 ml tube. separate aliquots subjected dna extraction by
either simplified chelex standard salting extraction
protocol(9,10). salting protocol so-called widely used 
employs high salt concentrations lieu hazardous organic solvents (such as
phenol chloroform) protein precipitation step dna
extraction(9). extracts used templates pcr amplification using
primers targeting arthropod mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
dehydrogenase (nadh) subunit 4 gene (nd4) check dna quality, pcr for
identification anopheles gambiae sibling species(10) nested pcr for
typing plasmodium falciparum infection. comparison using dna quality (nd4) pcr
showed 93% sensitivity 82% specificity chelex approach relative to
the established salting protocol. corresponding values sensitivity and
specificity 100% 78%, respectively, using sibling species identification
pcr 92% 80%, respectively p. falciparum detection pcr. 
significant differences proportion samples giving amplicon signal 
chelex regular salting protocol across three pcr applications. the
chelex approach required three simple reagents 37 min complete, 
salting protocol entailed 10 different reagents 2 hr 47 min'
processing time, including overnight step. results show chelex
method comparable existing salting extraction be
substituted simple sustainable approach resource-limited settings
where constant reagent supply chain often difficult maintain.
