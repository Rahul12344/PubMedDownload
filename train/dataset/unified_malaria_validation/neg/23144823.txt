liver-stage malaria parasites promising target drugs vaccines
against malaria infection. however, little currently known gene
regulation stage. study, used rodent malaria parasite
plasmodium berghei showed ap2-family transcription factor, designated
ap2-l, plays critical role liver-stage development parasite.
ap2-l-depleted parasites proliferated normally blood mosquitoes.
however, ability parasites infect liver approximately
10,000 times lower wild-type parasites. vitro assays showed 
the sporozoites parasites invaded hepatocytes normally their
development stopped middle liver schizont stage. expression
profiling using transgenic p. berghei showed fluorescent protein-tagged
ap2-l increased rapidly liver schizont stage suddenly disappeared 
with formation mature liver schizont. dna microarray analysis showed
that expression several genes, including parasitophorous vacuole 
membrane proteins, significantly decreased early liver stage of
ap2-l-depleted parasites. investigation targets transcription
factor greatly promote exploration liver-stage antigens the
elucidation mechanisms hepatocyte infection malaria parasites.
