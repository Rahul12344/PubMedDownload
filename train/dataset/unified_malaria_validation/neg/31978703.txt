post-translational modifications histones histone modifying enzymes play
important roles gene regulations physiological processes in
parasites. inhibitors modifying enzymes could useful novel
therapeutics parasitic diseases chemical probes investigation
of epigenetics. development parasitic histone modulators got rapid
expansion last years. number highly potent selective
compounds reported, together extensive preclinical studies of
their biological activity. compounds widely used in
humans targeting cancer found non-toxic. review summarizes the
antiparasitic activities histone histone modifying enzymes inhibitors
evaluated last years. current chemotherapy parasites is
still satisfactory, therefore, compounds represents good starting points
for discovery effective antiparasitic drugs.
