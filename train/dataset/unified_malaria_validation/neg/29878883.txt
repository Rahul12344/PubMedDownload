the development new ways probe samples three-dimensional (3d)
structure dna paves way depth systematic analyses genome
architecture. 3c-like methods coupled high-throughput sequencing now
assess physical interactions pairs loci genome-wide fashion, thus
enabling creation genome-by-genome contact maps. spreading such
protocols creates many new opportunities methodological development: 
we infer 3d models contact maps? models help us gain insights
into biological processes? several recent studies applied protocols p.

genome organization different moments life cycle. small
genomic size, fairly simple (yet changing) genomic organization its

infer 3d models use downstream analysis. here, review set of
methods used build analyse three-dimensional models contact maps data
with special highlight p. falciparum's genome organization.
