malaria one severe tropical infectious diseases. 220
million people around world clinical malaria infection one
million die plasmodium annually. parasitic pathogen replicates
efficiently human host making difficult eradicate. transmitted
by mosquito vectors far mosquito control programs effectively
eliminated transmission. malaria's enormous health economic
impact need develop new control eventual elimination strategies, a
big research effort made better understand biology this
parasite interactions vertebrate host. determination the
genome sequence organization, elucidation role key proteins,
and cell signaling studies helped develop understanding the
molecular mechanisms provide parasite's versatility. parasite can
sense environment adapt benefit survival, indeed essential
for complete life cycle. many years studied the
plasmodium parasite able sense melatonin. review discuss the
melatonin signaling pathway role control plasmodium replication
and development.
