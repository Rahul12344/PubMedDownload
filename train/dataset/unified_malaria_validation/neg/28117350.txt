large-scale molecular epidemiologic studies plasmodium falciparum parasites
have provided insights parasite biology transmission, identify the
spread drug resistance, useful assessing vaccine targets. the
polyclonal nature infections high transmission settings problematic for
traditional genotyping approaches. next-generation sequencing (ngs) approaches to
parasite genotyping allow sensitive detection minority variants,
disaggregation complex parasite mixtures, scalable processing large
samples sets. therefore, designed, validated, applied field parasites
an approach leverages sequencing individually barcoded samples a
multiplex manner. utilize variant barcodes, invariant linker sequences and
modular template-specific primers allow simultaneous generation of
high-dimensional sequencing data multiple gene targets. modularity
permits cost-effective reproducible way query many genes once. in
mixtures reference parasite genomes, quantitatively detected unique
haplotypes comprising little 2% polyclonal infection. applied 
genotyping approach field-collected parasites collected western kenya in
order simultaneously obtain parasites genotypes three unlinked loci. in
summary, present rapid, scalable, flexible method genotyping
individual parasites enables molecular epidemiologic studies parasite
evolution, population structure transmission.
