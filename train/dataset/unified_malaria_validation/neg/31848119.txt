the major growth point-of-care malaria diagnosis past decade been
based immunochromatographic malaria rapid diagnostic tests (mrdts), which
generally detect plasmodium falciparum via abundant histidine-rich protein 2 
(hrp2). here, review discovery biology hrp2, well the
strengths weaknesses hrp2-based diagnosis compared alternative
antigens. highlight recent studies describing hrp2 deletion latin america, 
eritrea, possibly regions, methodological challenges of
confirming deletion pfhrp2 gene. also discuss mechanism of
persistent hrp2 positivity effective antimalarial treatment, along with
other emerging hrp2-based applications, including detection submicroscopic
malaria diagnosis severe malaria.
