chloroquine (cq) fansidar (sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, sp) widely used
for treatment plasmodium falciparum several decades malaysia prior to
the introduction artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) 2008. our
previous study kalabakan, located south-east coast sabah showed high
prevalence resistance cq sp, suggesting use treatment may no
longer effective area. study aimed provide baseline data of
antimalarial drug resistant markers p. falciparum isolates kota marudu
located north-east coast sabah. mutations genes associated cq
(pfcrt pfmdr1) sp (pfdhps pfdhfr) assessed pcr amplification 
and restriction fragment length polymorphism. mutations kelch13 marker
(k13) associated artemisinin resistance determined dna sequencing
technique. assessment pfmdr1 copy number variation associated with
mefloquine resistant done real-time pcr technique. low prevalence (6.9%)
was indicated pfcrt k76t pfmdr1 n86y mutations. p. falciparum
isolates harboured pfdhps a437g mutation. prevalence pfdhfr gene
mutations, s108n i164l, 100% 10.3%, respectively. combining the
different resistant markers, two isolates conferred cq sp
treatment failure markers contained mutant alleles pfcrt pfmdr1
together quintuple pfdhps/pfdhfr mutation (combination pfdhps a437g+a581g
and pfdhfr c59r+s108n+i164l). p. falciparum isolates carried single copy
number pfmdr1 wild type k13 marker. study demonstrated low
prevalence cq sp resistance alleles study area. continuous
monitoring antimalarial drug efficacy warranted findings provide
information policy makers ensuring proper malaria control.
