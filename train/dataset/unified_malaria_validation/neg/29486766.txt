background: niger, malaria transmission markedly seasonal 
disease burden occurring children rainy season. seasonal malaria
chemoprevention (smc) amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (aq + sp)
is recommended country administered monthly during
the rainy season. moreover, clinical decisions use sp intermittent
preventive treatment pregnancy (iptp) depend upon validated molecular 
markers sp resistance plasmodium falciparum observed local parasite
population. however, little known molecular markers resistance for
either sp aq south niger. address question, clinical samples
which met clinical biological criteria, collected gabi, madarounfa
district, maradi region, niger 2011-2012 (before smc implementation).
molecular markers resistance pyrimethamine (pfdhfr), sulfadoxine (pfdhps)
and amodiaquine (pfmdr1) assessed dna sequencing.
results: prior smc implementation, samples showed high proportion of
clinical samples carried pfdhfr 51i/59r/108n haplotype associated with
resistance pyrimethamine pfdhps 436a/f/h 437g mutations associated
with reduced susceptibility sulfadoxine. contrast mutations codons 581g,
and 613s pfdhps gene, pfmdr1, 86y, 184y, 1042d 1246y associated
with resistance amodiaquine, less frequently observed. importantly,
pfdhfr i164l pfdhps k540e mutations shown clinically relevant 
markers high level clinical resistance sp detected gabi.
conclusions: although parasites genotypes associated highest levels
of resistance aq + sp yet common setting, importance for
deployment smc iptp dictates monitoring markers of
resistance accompany interventions. study also highlights the
parasite heterogeneity within small spatial area need use caution
when extrapolating results surveys molecular markers resistance a
single site inform regional policy decisions.
