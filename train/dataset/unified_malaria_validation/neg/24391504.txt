eukaryotes. plasmodium falciparum, epigenetic marks regulate expression 
of genes involved several aspects host-parasite interactions, including
antigenic variation. identities genomic positions many histone
modifications cataloged, targeted defined genomic
regions remains poorly understood. example, variant antigen encoding loci
(var) targeted deposition unique histone marks mystery that
continues perplex field. describe recruitment ortholog
of histone modifier set2 var genes direct interactions the
c-terminal domain (ctd) rna polymerase ii. higher eukaryotes, set2 a
histone methyltransferase recruited rna pol ii mrna transcription;
however, ortholog p. falciparum (pfset2) atypical architecture 
its role regulating transcription unknown. show pfset2 binds
to unphosphorylated form ctd, property inconsistent its
recruitment mrna synthesis. further, show h3k36me3, epigenetic
mark deposited pfset2, enriched active silent var gene loci,
providing additional evidence recruitment associated mrna
production. over-expression dominant negative form pfset2 designed to
disrupt binding rna pol ii induced rapid var gene expression switching,
confirming importance pfset2 var gene regulation role for
rna pol ii recruitment. rna pol ii known transcribe non-coding rnas 
from active silent var genes, providing possible mechanism it
could recruit pfset2 var loci. work unifies previous reports histone
