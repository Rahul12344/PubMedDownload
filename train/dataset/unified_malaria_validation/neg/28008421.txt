plasmodium vivax predominant cause malaria asia-pacific,
south america horn africa. laboratory studies species are
constrained inability maintain parasite continuous ex vivo
culture, genomic approaches provide alternative complementary avenue
to investigate parasite's biology epidemiology. date, molecular
studies p. vivax relied salvador-i reference genome sequence,
derived monkey-adapted strain south america. however, salvador-i 
reference remains highly fragmented 2500 unassembled scaffolds.  using 
high-depth illumina sequence data, assembled annotated new reference
sequence, pvp01, sourced directly patient papua indonesia. draft
assemblies isolates china (pvc01) thailand (pvt01) also prepared
for comparative purposes. quality pvp01 assembly improved greatly
over salvador-i, fragmentation reduced 226 scaffolds. detailed manual
curation ensured highly comprehensive annotation, functions attributed
to 58% core genes pvp01 versus 38% salvador-i. assemblies pvp01,
pvc01 pvt01 larger salvador-i (28-30 versus 27 mb), owing to
improved assembly subtelomeres.  extensive repertoire 1200
plasmodium interspersed repeat (pir) genes identified pvp01 compared to
346 salvador-i, suggesting vital role parasite survival development.
the manually curated pvp01 reference pvc01 pvt01 draft assemblies are
important new resources study vivax malaria. pvp01 maintained genedb and
ongoing curation ensure continual improvements assembly annotation
quality.
