the employment nanoparticles obtained various synthesis routes as
novel pesticides recently attracted high research attention. impressive number
of studies conducted test toxic potential wide
number arthropod pests vectors, major emphasis mosquitoes and
ticks. however, precise information mechanisms action nanoparticles 
against insects mites limited, noteworthy exception silica,
alumina, silver, graphene oxide nanoparticles insects, no
information available mites. here, summarize current knowledge the
mechanisms action nanoparticles insects. silver graphene
oxide nanoparticles significant impact insect antioxidant and
detoxifying enzymes, leading oxidative stress cell death. ag nanoparticles
also reduced acetylcholinesterase activity, polystyrene nanoparticles
inhibited cyp450 isoenzymes. au nanoparticles act trypsin inhibitors and
disrupt development reproduction. metal nanoparticles bind p 
proteins nucleic acids, respectively, leading decrease membrane
permeability, therefore organelle enzyme denaturation, followed cell
death. besides, ag nanoparticles up- downregulate key insect genes, reducing 
protein synthesis gonadotrophin release, leading developmental damages and
reproductive failure. toxicity sio2 al2o3 nanoparticles due to
their binding insect cuticle, followed physico-sorption waxes and
lipids, leading insect dehydration. final section, insect
nanotoxicology research trends critically discussed, outlining major
challenges predict ecotoxicological consequences arising the
real-world use nanoparticles pesticides.
