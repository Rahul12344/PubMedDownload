aims: chemical biological studies river nile derived-microorganisms
are limited. hence, work carried screen river nile habitat.
identification isolated organisms, chemical profiling ethyl
acetate extracts well screening antimicrobial, antileishmanial,
antitrypanosomal, antimalarial activities investigated.
methods: identification microbial isolates carried using
bacterial 16s rrna fungal 18s rrna gene sequencing. chemical profiling the
etoac extracts using lc-hresims spectroscopy carried out. vitro
antimicrobial screening using modified version clsi method,
antileishmanial antitrypanosomal activities screened using leishmania
donovani promastigote assay, l. donovani axenic amastigote assay, trypanosoma
brucei trypamastigotes assay thp1 toxicity assay. vitro antimalarial
activities d6 (chloroquine sensitive) w2 (chloroquine-resistant)
strains plasmodium falciparum evaluated.
results: seven isolated microorganisms identified streptomyces
indiaensis, bacillus safensis, b. anthracis, bacillus sp., aspergillus
awamori. chemical investigation different extracts showed several bioactive
compounds, identified as; nigragillin, 5-caboxybenzofuran dyramide b a. 
awamori actinopolysporin b s. indiaensis. hand many
nitrogenous compounds high molecular weights showed hits may
correspond new long chain and/or cyclic peptides. etoac extract b.
safensis fermentation broth showed highest activity p. falciparum d6 
and p. falciparum w2 (ic50 = 25.94 27.28 μg/ml, respectively), two
isolates s. indiaensis bacillus sp. rn-011 extracts showed highest
antitrypanosomal activity (ic50 = 0.8 0.96 μg/ml).
conclusion: river nile could new source production promising
bioactive leading compound antimicrobial antiparasitic activities may
be correlated.
