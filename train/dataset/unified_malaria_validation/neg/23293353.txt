overcoming antigenic variation one major challenges development 
of effective vaccine plasmodium falciparum, causative agent human
malaria. inclusion multiple ag variants subunit vaccine candidates one
strategy aimed overcome problem leading blood-stage
malaria vaccine targets, is, merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1) apical
membrane ag 1 (ama1). however, previous studies, utilizing malaria ags, have
concluded inclusion multiple allelic variants, encoding altered peptide
ligands, vaccine may detrimental priming vivo
restimulation ag-experienced cells. study, analyze cell
responses two alleles msp1 ama1 induced vaccination malaria-naive
adult volunteers bivalent viral-vectored vaccine candidates. show a
significant bias 3d7/mad20 allele compared wellcome allele for
the 33 kda region msp1, 19 kda fragment ama1 ag.
although bias could caused "immune interference" priming, data 
do support significant role "immune antagonism" memory cell
restimulation, despite observation latter minimal epitope level in
vitro. lack class hla epitopes wellcome allele recognized 
by vaccinated volunteers may fact contribute observed bias. also
show controlled infection 3d7 strain p. falciparum parasites neither
boosts existing 3d7-specific cell responses appears "immune divert"
cellular responses toward wellcome allele.
