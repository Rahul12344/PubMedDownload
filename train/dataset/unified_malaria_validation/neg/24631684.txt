mosquitoes exhibit ∼24 h rhythms physiology behavior, regulated the
cooperative action endogenous circadian clock environmental
light:dark cycle. here, characterize diel (observed light:dark
conditions) time-of-day changes metabolic detoxification resistance to
insecticide challenge anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. better understanding 
mosquito chronobiology yield insights developing novel control
strategies important disease vector. previously identified >2000
rhythmically expressed an. gambiae genes. include metabolic detoxification 
enzymes peaking various times throughout day. especially interesting was
the identification rhythmic genes encoding enzymes capable pyrethroid
and/or ddt metabolism (cyp6m2, cyp6p3, cyp6z1, gste2). hypothesized that
these temporal changes gene expression would confer time-of-day specific
changes metabolic detoxification responses insecticide challenge. an.
gambiae mosquitoes (adult female pimperena mali-nih strains) tested by
gene expression analysis diel rhythms key genes associated with
insecticidal resistance. biochemical assays total gst, esterase, oxidase 
enzymatic activities undertaken time-specific mosquito head body
protein lysates. determine rhythmic susceptibility insecticides by
survivorship, mosquitoes exposed ddt deltamethrin across diel
cycle. report occurrence temporal changes gst activity samples
extracted body head single peak late-night dawn, no
rhythms detected oxidase esterase activity. pimperena strain was
found resistant insecticidal challenge, subsequent genomic analysis 
revealed presence resistance-conferring kdr mutation. observed diel
rhythmicity key insecticide detoxification genes mali-nih strain, 
peak phases previously reported pimperena strain. insecticide
sensitive mali-nih strain mosquitoes exhibited diel rhythm survivorship to
ddt exposure bimodal variation deltamethrin challenge. results
demonstrate rhythms detoxification pesticide susceptibility an. gambiae
mosquitoes; knowledge could incorporated mosquito control and
experimental design strategies, contributes basic understanding of
mosquito biology.
