objective: determine sensitivity real time polymerase chain reaction 
(pcr) malaria diagnosis compare accuracy microscopy an
antigen based rapid diagnostic test (optimal).
study design: cross-sectional analytical study.
place duration study: military hospital, armed forces institute of
transfusion armed forces institute pathology, rawalpindi, july to
december 2011.
methodology: venous blood samples 300 clinically suspected patients malaria
were tested malaria parasite microscopy optimal; malaria parasite 
index calculated positive samples. plasmodium genus specific real
time pcr performed specimens, targeting small subunit rrna gene.
diagnostic accuracy three tests compared cost analysis done.
results: 300 patients, malaria parasite detected 110, 106 123
patients microscopy, optimal pcr respectively. real time pcr 100%
sensitive microscopy optimal sensitivity 89.4% 86.2%
respectively. methods 100% specific. cost per test calculated to
be 0.2, 2.75 3.30 us$ microscopy, optimal pcr respectively, excluding 
the capital cost pcr equipment.
conclusion: genus specific real time pcr diagnosis malaria was
successfully established highly sensitive affordable technology that
should incorporated diagnostic algorithm country.
