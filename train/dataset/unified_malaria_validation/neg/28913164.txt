a range protistan parasites occur blood vertebrates are
transmitted haematophagous invertebrate vectors. 48 genera recognized
in bood primarily basis parasite morphology host specificity;
including extracellular kinetoplastids (trypanosomatids) intracellular
apicomplexa (haemogregarines, haemococcidia, haemosporidia piroplasms). gene 
sequences available growing number species molecular phylogenies
often link parasite host vector evolution.Â this review endeavours to
reconcile molecular clades biological characters. four major trypanosomatid 
clades associated site development vector: salivarian or
stercorarian trypanosoma, supra- peri-pylorian leishmania. four
haemogregarine clades associated acarine vectors (hepatozoon and
b, karyolysus, hemolivia) another two leeches (dactylosoma,
haemogregarina sensu stricto). two haemococcidian clades (lankesterella,
schellackia) using leeches mosquitoes (as paratenic hosts!) paraphyletic
with monoxenous enteric coccidia. two major haemosporidian clades been
associated mosquito vectors (plasmodium mammals, plasmodium birds 
and lizards), two midges (hepatocystis bats, parahaemoproteus from
birds) two louse-flies black-flies (haemoproteus leucocytozoon
from birds). three major piroplasm clades recognized: one associated with
transovarian transmission ticks (babesia sensu stricto); one with
pre-erythrocytic schizogony vertebrates (theileria/cytauxzoon); one with
neither (babesia sensu lato). broad comparative studies allied groups
suggest trypanosomatids haemogregarines evolved first aquatic and
then terrestrial environments, evidenced extant lineages invertebrates
and radiation vertebrates. contrast, haemosporidia haemococcidia 
are thought evolved first vertebrates proto-coccidia then
incorporated invertebrate vectors. piroplasms thought evolved in
ticks diversified mammals. molecular studies required more
parasite taxa refine current thought, ultimately transmission studies 
mandated determine vectors many haemoprotozoa.
