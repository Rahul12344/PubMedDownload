background: heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) family conserved molecules that
constitute major part cell's protein folding machinery. role of
hsp70s parasitic origin host cell immune modulation remained
contentious. largely due fact several studies implicating
hsp70 immune modulation rely use recombinant protein derived from
bacteria often fraught lipopolysaccharide (lps) contamination. 
this reason, need clarify role parasite hsp70 modulating
host immune cells.
objective: current study sought investigate role plasmodium
falciparum hsp70 (pfhsp70) immune modulation.
method: expressed recombinant pfhsp70 using three bacterial expression hosts: 
e. coli xl1 blue, e. coli clearcoli bl21 brevibacillus choshinensis,
respectively. investigated immunostimulatory capability pfhsp70
by monitoring cytokine production murine immune cells cultured presence
of protein.
results: recombinant pfhsp70 produced using e. coli xl1 blue expression host
induced il6 il8 cytokines. hand, pfhsp70 produced e. coli
clearcoli b. choshinensis expression systems associated no
detectable traces lps exhibited immunomodulatory activity.
conclusion: findings demonstrate pfhsp70 possess
immunomodulatory function. furthermore, study confirm e. coli
clearcoli b. choshinensis appropriate expression systems the
production lps-free recombinant protein.
