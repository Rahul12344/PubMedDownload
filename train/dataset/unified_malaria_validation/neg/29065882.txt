background: pakistan estimated annual burden 1.5 million malaria cases.
the current situation calls effective malaria control eradication
programme country. currently, primaquine attractive option for
eliminating reservoirs plasmodium vivax hypnozoites killing gametocytes of
plasmodium falciparum. however, drug causes haemolysis individuals who
are glucose-6-phosphate (g6pd) deficient. important map g6pd deficiency 
and malaria distribution pakistan design effective malaria eradication
regimen. frequency g6pd deficiency (g6pdd) malaria patients been
reported pakistan meaningful way. purpose study to
evaluate frequency g6pd c.563c>t (g6pd mediterranean) male individuals 
with without falciparum malaria.
methods: two hundred ten archived dna samples males (110 falciparum
malaria patients 100 healthy individuals) utilized study.
healthy blood donors selected based stringent pre-defined criteria.
patients confirmed malaria parasites microscopy immune
chromatographic assay detecting p. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2.
parasitaemia also computed. dna samples tested g6pd c.563c>t
mutation pcr-rflp according previously defined protocol its
allelic frequency computed.
results: g6pd c.563c>t observed four 110 patients falciparum
malaria two 100 healthy donors. mean (± sd) haemoglobin, median (iqr)
platelet median (iqr) parasite count g6pd-deficient malaria-patients 
8.9 ± 0.9 g/dl, 124 × 109/l (iqr 32, 171) 57,920/μl blood (iqr 12,920,
540,000) respectively.
conclusions: cumulative allelic frequency g6pd 563c.c>t 0.0285 detected
in 6 210 x-chromosomes southern pakistan. frequency g6pd allele
was 0.0364 malaria-patients 0.0200 healthy individuals. large studies
including females needed elucidate true burden g6pdd in
malaria-endemic areas. information enable local health policy makers 
design effective strategies eliminating malaria form region.
