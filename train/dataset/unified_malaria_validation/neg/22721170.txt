background: malaria caused plasmodium vivax experimentally neglected
severe disease substantial burden human health. technical
limitations, little known biology important human pathogen. 
whole genome analysis methods patient-derived material thus likely have
a substantial impact understanding p. vivax pathogenesis and
epidemiology. example, allow study evolution population
biology parasite, allow parasite transmission patterns be
characterized, may facilitate identification new drug resistance
genes. parasitemias typically low parasite cannot readily 
cultured, on-site leukocyte depletion blood samples typically needed to
remove human dna may 1000x abundant parasite dna. these
features precluded analysis archived blood samples require the
presence laboratories close proximity collection field samples
for optimal pre-cryopreservation sample preparation.
results: show in-solution hybridization capture used to
extract p. vivax dna human contaminating dna laboratory without the
need on-site leukocyte filtration. using whole genome capture method, we
were able enrich p. vivax dna bulk genomic dna less 0.5% a
median 55% (range 20%-80%). level enrichment allows efficient
analysis samples whole genome sequencing introduce any
gross biases data. method, obtained greater 5x
coverage across 93% p. vivax genome four p. vivax strains from
iquitos, peru, similar results using leukocyte filtration
(greater 5x coverage across 96% ).
conclusion: whole genome capture technique enable efficient whole
genome analysis p. vivax larger geographic region valuable
archived sample collections.
