with spread chloroquine (cq)-resistant malaria india,
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) alone combination artesunate used as
an alternative antimalarial drug. due continuous drug pressure, plasmodium
falciparum parasite exhibiting resistance antifolates mutations 
in candidate genes dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) dihydropteroate synthetase 
(dhps). earlier study flanking microsatellite markers dhfr mutant
alleles india shown single origin pyrimethamine resistance 
some minor haplotypes shared haplotypes southeast asian (thailand)
strains. present study, analyzed 193 indian p. falciparum
isolates 15 microsatellite loci around dhps investigate genetic
lineages mutant dhps alleles different parts country. eighty-one
of samples mutant dhps alleles, 62 andaman and
nicobar islands remaining 19 mainland india. 112 isolates
with wild-type dhps allele, 109 mainland india 3 from
andaman nicobar islands. consistent model selection, mean
expected heterozygosity (h(e)) around mutant dhps alleles (h(e) = 0.55; n = 81)
associated sulfadoxine resistance lower (p â‰¤ 0.05) mean h(e)
around wild-type dhps allele (h(e) = 0.80; n = 112). genetic
diversity flanking microsatellites dhps dhfr among isolates,
which confirms assertion dhps mutations early stage of
fixation parasite population. microsatellite haplotypes around various
mutant dhps alleles suggest resistant dhps alleles multiple
independent origins india, especially andaman nicobar islands.
determining genetic lineages resistant dhps alleles andaman and
nicobar islands mainland india significant, given role asia 
intercontinental spread chloroquine- pyrimethamine-resistant parasites 
the past.
