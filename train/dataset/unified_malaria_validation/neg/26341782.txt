background: severity outcome malaria influenced host immunity in
which chemokines regulated upon activation, normal cell expressed and
secreted (rantes) play important role. previous studies show variations
in rantes gene affect rantes protein production, hence altering host
immunity. study, relationship presence mutations rantes
and incidence malaria cohort children living malaria-endemic area
of uganda determined.
methods: longitudinal study comprising 423 children aged between
6 months 9 years, actively followed 1 year. malaria episodes 
occurring cohort children detected affected children treated 
with national policy drug regimen. mutations rantes gene determined
by pcr-rflp method frequencies calculated. multivariate negative
binomial regression model used estimate impact rantes mutations 
malaria incidence. statistical tests, p-value <0.05 considered as
significant.
results: frequencies -403a in1.1c allele 53.7 19.2 %,
respectively. mutations found -28 locus. adjustment of
incidence rates age, blood group, insecticide-treated bed net (itn) use,
malaria history sickle cell trait, 1n1.1t/c heterozygotes homozygotes
showed non-significant trend towards higher incidence rates compared to
wild-type individuals (irr = 1.10; p = 0.55 irr = 1.25; p = 0.60,
respectively). similarly, significant difference malaria
incidence rates rantes -403g/a heterozygotes homozygotes those
without mutations (irr = 1.09; p = 0.66 irr = 1.16; p = 0.50, respectively). 
no relation seen rantes polymorphisms, baseline parasite densities
and time first re-infection administration anti-malaria drugs.
conclusions: study showed -403a mutation occurs nearly half of
the study population in1.1c allele occurs one every four children. 
despite high frequency mutations, clear association
with malaria incidence. studies evaluating markers, could
potentially modulate rantes gene transcription alongside genetic modifiers 
of malaria susceptibility, may provide explanations less
dramatic findings.
