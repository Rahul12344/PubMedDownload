the coordinated exit intracellular pathogens host cells process
critical success spread infection. phospholipases have
been shown play important roles bacteria host cell egress virulence,
their role release intracellular eukaryotic parasites largely
unknown. examined malaria parasite protein phospholipase activity and
found involved hepatocyte egress. hepatocytes, plasmodium
parasites surrounded parasitophorous vacuole membrane (pvm), must 
be disrupted parasites released blood. however, a
molecular basis, little known pvm ruptured. show that
plasmodium berghei phospholipase, pbpl, localizes pvm infected
hepatocytes. provide evidence parasites lacking pbpl undergo completely
normal liver stage development merozoites produced defect in
egress host hepatocytes. investigate further, established a
live-cell imaging-based assay, enabled us study temporal dynamics of
pvm rupture quantitative basis. using assay could show that
pbpl-deficient parasites exhibit impaired pvm rupture, resulting delayed
parasite egress. wild-type phenotype could re-established gene
complementation, demonstrating specificity pbpl deletion phenotype. in
conclusion, identified first time plasmodium phospholipase that
is important pvm rupture turn parasite exit infected
hepatocyte therefore established key role parasite phospholipase in
egress.
