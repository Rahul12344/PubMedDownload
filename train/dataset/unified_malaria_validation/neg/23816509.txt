the 28s rrna gene amplified sequenced p. falciparum p. vivax
isolates collected northwest india. based upon sequence diversity the
plasmodium 28srrna gene comparison human counterpart, various nested 
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) primers designed 3r region the
28srrna gene evaluated field isolates. first report
demonstrating utility gene species-specific diagnosis malaria 
for two species, prevalent india. initial evaluation 363 clinical
isolates indicated that, comparison microscopy, showed sensitivity 
and specificity 85·39% 100% respectively, sensitivity specificity 
of nested pcr assay found 99·08% 100% respectively. assay 
was also successful detecting mixed infections undetected by
microscopy. results demonstrate utility 28s rrna gene a
diagnostic target detection major plasmodial species infecting
humans.
