cryptosporidium parasites infect intestinal cells, causing cryptosporidiosis.
despite high morbidity association stunting developing world,
current therapies cryptosporidiosis limited efficacy. calcium-dependent 
protein kinases (cdpks) essential enzymes biology protozoan
parasites. cdpk1 cloned genome cryptosporidium parvum, potent
and specific inhibitors developed based structural studies. 
study, evaluated anti-cryptosporidium activity novel cdpk1 inhibitor,
1294, demonstrated 1294 significantly reduces parasite infection in
vitro, half maximal effective concentration 100 nm. pharmacokinetic
studies revealed 1294 well absorbed, half-life supporting daily
administration. oral therapy 1294 eliminated cryptosporidium parasites 
6 7 infected severe combined immunodeficiency-beige mice, parasites
did recur immunosuppressed mice. mice treated 1294 less
epithelial damage, corresponding less apoptosis. thus, 1294 important
lead development drugs treatment cryptosporidiosis.
