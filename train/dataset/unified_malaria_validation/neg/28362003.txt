while phylum apicomplexa includes "only" several thousand described species
of obligatory parasites animals, may fact specious group 
parasitic protists million species 1. best known representatives 
are plasmodium spp., toxoplasma gondii cryptosporidium spp., belong 
the important widespread human parasites exacting enormous disease
burden. hand, dinoflagellates colpodellids, are
monophyletic apicomplexans, ecologically highly significant, they
belong abundant marine protists 2. common ancestor these
groups likely free-living photosynthesizing protist, one wonders,
which evolutionary forces contributed dramatic transition its
descendants arguably successful intracellular parasites? although a
range various processes mechanisms contributed transition, most
likely also involved acquisition genes via horizontal gene transfer
(hgt), might provided typical characteristics parasitic cell,
such immune escape, nutritional dependence capacity invade other
cells.
