anopheles maculipennis complex comprises important malaria vectors iran, 
middle east, europ. principal way control malaria remains the
use chemical insecticides vectors vaccine 
malaria prevention. extensive use organophosphate compounds caused to
emergence distribution insecticide resistance anopheles species in
asia. current study aimed detection three well-known amino acid
substitutions (i114t, l119f, f120l) glutathione s-transferases epsilon
2 (gste2) gene associated ddt organophosphate insecticides
resistance anopheles maculipennis population collected iran. adult
samples an. maculipennis collected hand total catch animal 
human shelters azerbaijan-gharbi zanjan provinces. following
morphological identification, dna extracted yta genomic dna extraction
mini kit amplification rdna-its2 gste2 fragments. âˆ¼500 bp fragment was
amplified using f rdna-its2 gste2 primers. rdna-its2 sequence analysis showed
100% similarity an. maculipennis. gste2 nucleotide sequence similarity
within species 99-100%, while, 95-96 % compared anopheles
sacharovi gste2 sequences available genbank. amino acid sequence comparisons
showed novel amino acid substitution n148d position 15.79% frequency.
the current study reports new gste2 amino acid substitution an. maculipennis
s.s., first time. function mutation n148d association 
with resistance phenotype need validate. however, integration these
data malaria control program still remains challenge.
