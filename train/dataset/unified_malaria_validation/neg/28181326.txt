single molecule real-time (smrt) sequencing recently used obtain
full-length cdna sequences improve genome annotation reveal rna
isoforms. here, used one method called isoform sequencing pacific
biosciences (pacbio) sequence cdna library asian malaria mosquito
anopheles stephensi. 600 000 full-length cdnas, referred reads of
insert, identified. owing inherently high error rate pacbio
sequencing, tested different approaches error correction. found that
error correction using illumina rna sequencing (rna-seq) generated data than
using default smrt pipeline. full-length error-corrected pacbio reads
greatly improved gene annotation anopheles stephensi: 4867 gene models
were updated 1785 alternatively spliced isoforms added the
annotation. addition, six trans-splicing events, exons different
primary transcripts joined together, identified an. stephensi. all
six trans-splicing events appear conserved culicidae, also
found anopheles gambiae aedes aegypti. proteins encoded by
trans-splicing events also highly conserved orthologues these
proteins cis-spliced outgroup species, indicating trans-splicing may 
arise mechanism rescue genes broke evolution.
