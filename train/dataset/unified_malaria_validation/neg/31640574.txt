background: drug resistant malaria growing concern democratic
republic congo (drc), previous studies indicate parasites
resistant sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine chloroquine spatially clustered.
this study explores longitudinal changes spatial patterns understand how
resistant malaria may spreading within drc, using samples nation-wide
population-representative surveys.
methods: selected 552 children pcr-detectable plasmodium falciparum
infection identified known variants pfdhps pfcrt genes associated 
with resistance. compared proportion mutant parasites 2013 
previously reported adults 2007, identified risk factors carrying
a resistant allele using multivariate mixed-effects modeling. finally, fit a
spatial-temporal model observed data, providing smooth allele frequency
estimates space time.
results: proportion co-occurring pfdhps k540e/a581g mutations increased by
16% 2007 2013. spatial-temporal model suggests spatial
range pfdhps double mutants expanded time, prevalence and
range pfcrt mutations remained steady.
conclusions: study uses population-representative samples describe the
changing landscape sp resistance within drc, persistence of
chloroquine resistance. vigilant molecular surveillance critical for
controlling spread resistance.
