an understanding immunogenetic basis naturally acquired immunity to
plasmodium falciparum infection would aid designing rationally based 
malaria vaccine. variants within fc gamma receptors (fcγrs) mediate immunity 
through engagement immunoglobulin g immune mediators, gamma 
interferon (ifn-γ), resulting erythrophagocytosis production of
inflammatory cytokines severe malarial anemia (sma). toll-like receptors
(tlrs) trigger transcription proinflammatory cytokines induce adaptive
immune responses. therefore, receptors may condition malaria disease
pathogenesis alteration adaptive innate immune responses. to
further delineate impacts fcγriiia tlr9 sma pathogenesis, the
associations fcγriiia -176f/v tlr9 -1237t/c variants, sma (hemoglobin
[hb] < 6.0 g/dl), circulating ifn-γ levels investigated children (n =
301) western kenya acute malaria. multivariate logistic regression
analysis (controlling potential confounders) revealed children 
fcγriiia -176v/tlr9 -1237c (vc) variant combination 64% reduced odds of
developing sma (odds ratio [or], 0.36; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.20 to
0.64; p = 0.001), carriers fcγriiia -176v/tlr9 -1237t (vt) variant
combination twice susceptible sma (or, 2.04; 95% ci, 1.19 3.50; p =
0.009). children sma higher circulating ifn-γ levels non-sma
children (p = 0.008). hemoglobin levels negatively correlated ifn-γ
levels (r = -0.207, p = 0.022). consistently, fcγriiia -176v/tlr9 -1237t (vt)
carriers higher levels circulating ifn-γ (p = 0.011) relative to
noncarriers, supporting observation higher ifn-γ levels associated
with sma. results demonstrate fcγriiia-176f/v tlr9 -1237t/c
variants condition susceptibility sma functional changes circulating
ifn-γ levels.
