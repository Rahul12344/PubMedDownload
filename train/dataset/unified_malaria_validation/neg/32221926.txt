trypanosomatids rely primarily posttranscriptional mechanisms control 
of gene expression, regulation rna processing, localization, degradation,
and translation rna-binding proteins (rbps). determine mechanisms by
which rbps control gene expression trypanosomatids, transcriptome-wide
identification mrna targets mapping rna-binding site required.
here present current rip-seq (rna immunoprecipitation followed by
high-throughput sequencing) protocol generally apply elucidate
rna/protein interactions trypanosoma brucei. technique provides valuable
information workings messenger ribonucleoprotein (mrnp) networks and
trypanosome gene expression mechanisms.
