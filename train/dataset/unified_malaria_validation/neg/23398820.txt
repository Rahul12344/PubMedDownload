background: acquisition complex transcriptional regulatory abilities and
epigenetic machinery facilitated transition ancestor apicomplexans 
from free-living organism obligate parasite. ability control
sophisticated gene expression patterns enabled ancient organisms evolve 
several differentiated forms, invade multiple hosts evade host immunity. 
these abilities acquired remains outstanding question protistan
biology.
results: work, study set domain bearing genes implicated in
mediating immune evasion, invasion cytoadhesion pathways modern
apicomplexans, including malaria parasites. provide first conclusive
evidence horizontal gene transfer histone h4 lysine 20 (h4k20)
modifier, set8, animal host ancestor apicomplexans. set8 is
known contribute coordinated expression genes involved immune
evasion modern apicomplexans. also show likely transfer h3k36
methyltransferase (ashr3 plants), possibly derived algal endosymbionts.
these transfers appear date transition free-living organisms to
parasitism coincide proposed horizontal acquisition cytoadhesion 
domains, o-glycosyltransferase modifies domains, primary
family transcription factors found apicomplexan parasites. notably,
phylogenetic support conclusions robust genes clearly are
dissimilar set sequences found closely related parasite perkinsus
marinus, ciliates, nearest free-living organisms complete genome 
sequences available.
conclusions: animal plant sources epigenetic machinery provide new
insights evolution parasitism apicomplexans. along the
horizontal transfer cytoadhesive domains, o-linked glycosylation key
transcription factors, acquisition set domain methyltransferases marks a
key transitional event evolution parasitism important protozoan
lineage.
