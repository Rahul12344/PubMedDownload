metabolic resistance insecticides threatens malaria control. however, little
is known fitness cost field populations malaria vectors, thus
limiting design suitable resistance management strategies. here, we
assessed association glutathione s-transferase gste2-mediated
metabolic resistance life-traits natural populations anopheles
funestus. total 1200 indoor resting blood-fed female an. funestus (f₀) 
collected mibellon, cameroon (2016/2017), allowed lay eggs
individually. genotyping f1 mosquitoes l119f-gste2 mutation revealed
that l/l119-homozygote susceptible (ss) mosquitoes significantly laid eggs
than heterozygotes l119f-rs (odds ratio (or) = 2.06; p < 0.0001) homozygote
resistant 119f/f-rr (or = 2.93; p < 0.0001). l/l119-ss susceptible mosquitoes
also showed higher ability oviposition 119f/f-rr resistant (or =
2.68; p = 0.0002) indicating reduced fecundity resistant mosquitoes.
furthermore, l119f-rs larvae developed faster (nine days) l119f-rr and
l119f-ss (11 days) (x² = 11.052; degree freedom (df) = 4; p = 0.02) suggesting
a heterozygote advantage effect larval development. interestingly, l/l119-ss 
developed faster 119f/f-rr (or = 5.3; p < 0.0001) revealing increased
developmental time resistant mosquitoes. however, genotyping sequencing
revealed l119f-rr mosquitoes exhibited higher adult longevity compared 
rs (or > 2.2; p < 0.05) ss (or > 2.1; p < 0.05) increased frequency
of gste2-resistant haplotypes mosquitoes d30 adult emergence.
additionally, comparison expression gste2 revealed significantly
increased expression d1-d30 emergence adults (anova test (f) = 8;
df= 3; p = 0.008). negative association gste2 life traits of
an. funestus could facilitate new resistance management strategies. however, 
increased longevity gste2-resistant mosquitoes suggests increase in
resistance could exacerbate malaria transmission.
