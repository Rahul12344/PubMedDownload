within liver, plasmodium sporozoites traverse cells searching a
"suitable" hepatocyte, invading cells process results the
formation parasitophorous vacuole (pv), within parasite undergoes 
intracellular replication liver stage. previously established that
two members plasmodium s48/45 protein family, p36 p52, essential
for productive invasion host hepatocytes sporozoites simultaneous 
deletion results growth-arrested parasites lack pv. recent studies
point toward pathway entry possibly involving interaction p36 with
hepatocyte receptors epha2, cd81, sr-b1. however, relationship between
p36 p52 sporozoite invasion remains unknown. show that
parasites single p52 p36 gene deletion lack pv hepatocyte 
invasion, thereby pheno-copying lack pv observed p52/p36 dual
gene deletion parasite line. indicates proteins equally
important establishment pv act pathway. created 
plasmodium yoelii p36mcherry tagged parasite line allowed us visualize
the subcellular localization p36 found partially co-localizes with
p52 sporozoite secretory microneme organelles. furthermore, through
co-immunoprecipitation studies vivo, determined p36 p52 form a
protein complex sporozoites, indicating concerted function proteins
within pv formation pathway. however, upon sporozoite stimulation, p36
was released secreted protein p52 not. results support model
in putatively glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi)-anchored p52 may serve
as scaffold facilitate interaction secreted p36 host cell
during sporozoite invasion hepatocytes.
