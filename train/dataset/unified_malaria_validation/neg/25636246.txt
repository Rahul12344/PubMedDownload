native european passerine birds frequently clinically inapparent carriers 
haemosporidian parasites genus plasmodium. clinical disease death 
only exceptionally reported. present study, tissue samples 233 wild
passerine birds found dead eastern austria examined situ
hybridization (ish) partial cytochrome b gene sequence analysis the
presence, abundance taxonomic assignment plasmodium spp. 34 cases
(14.6%), ish yielded positive result large numbers developmental stages
in different cell types spleen, liver, brain lung. abundance of
the tissue stages, comparable fatal cases avian malaria in
penguins, suggested major contribution cause death. genetic analysis 
revealed infections representatives three different valid species of
plasmodium, plasmodium elongatum, plasmodium lutzi plasmodium vaughani.
genetically identical parasite lineages found previous study in
penguins kept vienna zoo, providing evidence role wild birds as
reservoir hosts. further, study provides evidence several species of
plasmodium able abundantly proliferate endemic wild birds ultimately
resulting mortalities.
