pathogenesis malaria infections linked remodeling erythrocytes, a
process dependent trafficking hundreds parasite-derived proteins
into host erythrocyte. recent studies demonstrated plasmodium
translocon exported proteins (ptex) serves central gateway for
trafficking proteins, inducible knockdown core ptex
constituents blocked trafficking classes cargo the
erythrocyte. however, role auxiliary component ptex88 protein
export remains less clear. used inducible knockdown technologies 
p. falciparum p. berghei assess role ptex88 parasite development
and protein export, reveal vivo growth ptex88-deficient
parasites hindered. interestingly, unable link observation 
a general defect export variety known parasite proteins, suggesting
that ptex88 functions different fashion core ptex components.
strikingly, ptex88-deficient p. berghei incapable causing cerebral
malaria despite robust pro-inflammatory response host. parasites
also exhibited reduced ability sequester peripheral tissues were
removed readily circulation spleen. keeping these
findings, ptex88-deficient p. falciparum-infected erythrocytes displayed reduced 
binding endothelial cell receptor, cd36. suggests ptex88 likely 
plays specific direct indirect role mediating parasite sequestration
rather making universal contribution trafficking exported
proteins.
