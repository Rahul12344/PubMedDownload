background: plasmodium falciparum virulent parasite five
plasmodium species cause human malaria, biological analysis the
parasite critical development novel strategies disease control.
dna endonucleases important maintaining biological activity, gene
stability parasite interaction host immune systems. this
study, ten sequences dna endonucleases found genome p.
falciparum 3d7 clone, seven predicted contain an
endonuclease/exonuclease/phosphatase (ipr005135) domain plays important 
role dna catalytic activity. seven dna endonucleases p. falciparum were
systematically investigated.
methods: plasmodium falciparum 3d7 clone cultured human o+ rbcs, rna was
extracted 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48Â h post invasion real-time quantitative
pcr carried analyse transcription seven dna endonuclease
genes asexual stages. immunofluorescence assay carried confirm 
location encoded proteins expressed erythrocytic stages. finally,
the catalytic activity dna nucleases tested.
results: seven proteins analysed, two proteins soluble. fragments
derived rest five endonuclease sequences successfully expressed 
soluble proteins, used generate antisera protein
localization. proteins located nucleus ring and
trophozoite stages. schizont stage, proteins encoded pf3d7_1238600,
pf3d7_0107200 pf3d7_0319200 punctuated forms parasite most
likely around nuclei merozoites. proteins encoded pf3d7_0305600
and pf3d7_1363500 distributed around infected erythrocyte membrane. 
enzymatic activity recombinant gst-pf3d7_1238600 efficient
without divalent iron, activity rest four enzymes iron
dependent. further, divalent irons show specific enhancement the
activity gst-pf3d7_1238600, activity gst-pf3d7_0107200,
gst-pf3d7_1363500 gst-pf3d7_0319200 cu2+ dependent. activity of
gst-pf3d7_0305600 dependent mg2+ mn2+. except gst-pf3d7_1363500, four 
of gst tagged recombinant proteins hydrolysed supercoiled circular
plasmid dna without divalent metal ions. gst-pf3d7_1363500 protein
only changed supercoiled circular plasmid dna nicked plasmids, even with
cu2+.
conclusions: fragments derived five endonuclease sequences p.
falciparum 3d7 clone successfully expressed. proteins displayed diverse 
cell distribution, biochemical enzymatic activities, indicated that
they carried different biological function development parasite 
the erythrocytes. dna repair dna degradation capacity dna
endonucleases biology parasite remained studied.
