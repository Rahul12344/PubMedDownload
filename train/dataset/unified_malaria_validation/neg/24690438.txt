background: anopheles anthropophagus, one important mosquito-borne
disease vectors asia, mainly takes blood meals humans transmits 
malaria filariae. micrornas (mirnas) small non-coding rnas, play a
critical role many cellular processes, including development, differentiation,
apoptosis innate immunity.
methods: investigated global mirna expression profile male female
adults a. anthropophagus using illumina hiseq2000 sequencing combined with
northern blot.
results: using mirnas closely-related species anopheles gambiae and
aedes aegypti reference, obtained 102 mirnas candidates 12.43
million raw sequencing reads male 16.51 million reads female, 81
of found known mirnas an. gambiae and/or ae. aegypti, the
remaining 21 mirnas considered novel. analyzing revised read count
of mirnas male female, 29 known mirnas show sexual difference expression: 
>2-fold read count mirnas male female. especially for
mir-989, highly expressed female mosquitoes, shows almost 
detected expression male mosquitoes, indicating mir-989 may involved
in physiological activity female mosquito adults. expression four
mirnas different growth stages mosquito identified northern
blot. several mirnas show stage-specific expression, mir-2943 only
expressed egg stage, suggesting mir-2943 may associated the
development mosquito eggs.
conclusions: present study represents first global characterization of
an. anthropophagus mirnas sexual differences stage-specific functions. a
better understanding functions mirnas offer new insights 
mosquito biology implications effective control mosquito-borne
infectious diseases.
