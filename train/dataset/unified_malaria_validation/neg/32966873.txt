the sensitivity volatile carbon dioxide (co2) produced humans other
animals critical component host preference behaviors malaria
vector mosquito anopheles coluzzii. molecular receptors responsible the
ability sense co2 encoded three putative gustatory receptor (gr) genes 
(gr22,23,24) expressed distinctive array sensory neurons housed
in maxillary palp capitate peg sensilla an. coluzzii. despite the
identification components subsequent studies, paucity 
understanding regarding respective roles three grs mosquito's
co2 transduction process. address this, used crispr/cas9-based gene
editing technique combined vivo electrophysiological recordings to
directly examine role gr22,23,24 detecting co2 an. coluzzii. these
studies reveal gr23 gr24 absolutely required maintain in
vivo co2 sensitivity while, contrast, gr22 knock mutants still able to
respond co2 stimuli albeit significantly weaker sensitivity. data
supports model gr22 plays modulatory role enhance the
functionality gr23/24 complexes responsible co2 sensitivity of
mosquitoes.
