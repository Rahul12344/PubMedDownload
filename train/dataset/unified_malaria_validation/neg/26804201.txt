parasite proteins called pfemp1 inserted surface infected
erythrocytes, play key role severe pathology associated infection
by plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite. proteins mediate binding 
infected cells endothelial lining blood vessels strategy avoid 
clearance spleen major targets naturally acquired immunity.
pfemp1 encoded large multi-gene family called var. mutually-exclusive
transcriptional switching var genes allows parasites escape host
antibodies. study examined detail patterns expression var 
well-characterized sample parasites kenyan children. instead observing
clear inverse relationships expression broad sub-classes of
pfemp1, found expression different pfemp1 groups vary relatively
independently. parasite adaptation host antibodies also appears involve a
general reduction detectable var gene expression. suggest parasites
switch different pfemp1 variants high low expression
states. strategy could provide means avoiding immunological detection
and promoting survival high levels host immunity.
