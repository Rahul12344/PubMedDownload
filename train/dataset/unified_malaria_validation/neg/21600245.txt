plasmodium falciparum enolase (pfeno) localizes cytosol, nucleus, cell
membrane cytoskeletal elements, suggesting multiple non-glycolytic functions 
for protein. recent observation association enolase food 
vacuole (fv) immuno-gold electron microscopic images p. falciparum raised
the possibility yet another moonlighting function protein. we
provide additional support localization demonstrating presence of
pfeno purified fvs immunoblotting. examine potential functional role
of fv-associated pfeno, assessed ability pfeno complement mutant
saccharomyces cervisiae strain deficient enolase activity. strain
(tetr-eno2), enolase 1 gene deleted expression enolase 2 gene
is control tetracycline repressible promoter. enolase deficiency
in strain previously shown cause growth retardation, vacuolar
fragmentation altered expression certain vacuolar proteins. expression 
pfeno enolase-deficient yeast strain restored three phenotypic
effects. however, transformation tetr-eno2 enzymatically active,
monomeric mutant form pfeno (δ(5)pfeno) fully restored cell growth, only
partially rescued fragmented vacuolar phenotype, suggesting dimeric 
structure pfeno required optimal vacuolar functions. bioinformatic 
searches revealed presence plasmodium orthologs several yeast vacuolar 
proteins predicted form complexes pfeno. together, these
observations raise possibility association pfeno food vacuole in
plasmodium may physiological function(s).
