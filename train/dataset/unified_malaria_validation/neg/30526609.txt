background: malaria still serious public health problem bioko island
(equatorial guinea), although number annual cases greatly reduced
since 2004 bioko island malaria control project (bimcp). better
understanding malaria parasite population diversity transmission dynamics 
is critical assessing effectiveness malaria control measures. the
objective study investigate genetic diversity plasmodium
falciparum populations multiplicity infection (moi) bioko island
7 years bimcp.
methods: total 181 patients uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria
diagnosed microscopy collected bioko island january 2011 to
december 2014. parasite dna extracted using chelex-100 species were
identified using real-time pcr followed high-resolution melting. plasmodium 
falciparum msp1 msp2 allelic families determined using nested pcr.
results: three msp1 alleles (k1, mad20, ro33) two msp2 alleles (fc27 
3d7) analysed samples. msp1, mad20 allelic family was
predominant 96.69% (175/178) followed respectively k1 allelic family 
with 96.07% (171/178) r033 allelic family 70.78% (126/178). msp2, the
fc27 allelic family frequently detected 97.69% (169/173)
compared 3d7 72.25% (125/173). twenty-six different alleles observed
in msp1 9 alleles k1, 9 alleles mad20 8 alleles r033. in
msp2, 25 individual alleles detected 5 alleles fc27 20 alleles 
for 3d7. overall moi 5.51 respectively 3.5 2.01 msp1 and
msp2. significant increase overall moi correlated age group 
the patients (p = 0.026) parasite densities (p = 0.04).
conclusions: present data showed high genetic diversity moi values among 
the p. falciparum population study, reflecting high endemic level
and malaria transmission bioko island. data provide valuable information
for surveillance p. falciparum infection assessing appropriateness
of current malarial control strategies endemic area.
