export parasite proteins host erythrocyte essential survival
of plasmodium falciparum asexual life cycle. several studies
described key factors within parasite involved protein export,
the mechanisms employed traffic exported proteins within host cell are
currently unknown. members hsp70 family chaperones, together their
hsp40 cochaperones, facilitate protein trafficking organisms, are
thus likely used p. falciparum trafficking exported proteins. 
large group hsp40 proteins encoded parasite exported host
cell, one hsp70, p. falciparum hsp70x (pfhsp70x), exported them.
pfhsp70x absent plasmodium species found p. falciparum 
and closely related species infect apes. herein, utilized clustered 
regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (crispr)/cas9 genome editing in
p. falciparum investigate essentiality pfhsp70x. show parasitic
growth unaffected knockdown pfhsp70x using dihydrofolate
reductase (dhfr)-based destabilization domain glms ribozyme system.
similarly, complete gene knockout pfhsp70x affect ability of
p. falciparum proceed intraerythrocytic life cycle. effect 
pfhsp70x knockdown/knockout export proteins host red blood cell 
(rbc), including critical virulence factor p. falciparum erythrocyte membrane
protein 1 (pfemp1), tested, found process unaffected.
these data show although pfhsp70x sole exported hsp70, not
essential asexual development p. falciparum. importance half the
world's population lives risk malaria. intraerythrocytic life cycle of
plasmodium spp. responsible clinical manifestations malaria; therefore,
knowledge parasite's ability survive within erythrocyte needed
to combat deadliest agent malaria, p. falciparum. outstanding question 
in field p. falciparum undertakes essential process trafficking
its proteins within host cell. organisms, chaperones hsp70
are employed protein trafficking. plasmodium species causing human
disease, chaperone pfhsp70x unique p. falciparum, only
parasite protein kind exported host (s. külzer et al., cell
microbiol 14:1784-1795, 2012). placed pfhsp70x ideal target to
inhibit protein trafficking kill parasite. however, show pfhsp70x
is required export parasite effectors essential for
parasite survival inside rbc.
