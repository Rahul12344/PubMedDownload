evaluation murine isotype antibodies essential subunit vaccine
development inbred mouse strains diverse genetic backgrounds respond
different recombinant proteins. regard, main goal study
was measuring comparing profile igg isotype responses c57bl/6
mice. purpose, extracellular region plasmodium vivax
thrombospondin-related adhesive protein (pvtrap) gene expressed in
escherichia coli rosetta (de3)-pet23a. then, recombinant pvtrap alone or
emulsified freund's complete adjuvant applied immunization the
c57bl/6 mice. role antibodies cellular immune responses induced by
recombinant pvtrap evaluated. results showed level anti-rpvtrap
igg2c significantly higher igg2a groups received rpvtrap
alone (mean od490 = 0.798 ± 0.12 0.39 ± 0.1, respectively) emulsified
with cfa/ifa (mean od490 = 1.48 ± 0.07 0.605 ± 0.13, respectively; p < 0.05, 
independent sample t-test). additionally, immunized mice rpvtrap and
rpvtrap + cfa/ifa intermediate-avidity igg2a antibody high-avidity
igg2c antibody well mean serum antibody titers results exhibited
that rpvtrap rpvtrap + cfa/ifa mouse groups, igg2a end-point titer
(1:3200 1:25,600, respectively) noteworthy lower igg2c (1:25,600 and
1:102,400, respectively). moreover, results revealed eliciting
significant levels ifn-γ (p < 0.05, independent sample t-test) no
detectable level il-4 mouse groups received rpvtrap alone and
emulsified cfa/ifa compared mouse control groups. general, 
results showed correctly interpreting th1 immune responses c57bl/6
mouse strain critical measure igg2c instead igg2a along ifn-γ.
