determining genetic basis fitness central understanding evolution
and transmission microbial pathogens. human malaria parasites (plasmodium
falciparum), experimental work fitness focused asexual blood stage
parasites, stage easily cultured, although transmission
of malaria requires female anopheles mosquitoes vertebrate hosts. we
explore powerful approach identify genetic determinants parasite
fitness across invertebrate vertebrate life-cycle stages p.
falciparum. combines experimental genetic crosses using humanized mice, with
selective whole genome amplification pooled sequencing determine
genome-wide allele frequencies identify genomic regions selection
across multiple lifecycle stages. applied approach genetic crosses
between artemisinin resistant (art-r, kelch13-c580y) art-sensitive (art-s,
kelch13-wt) parasites, recently isolated southeast asian patients. two
striking results emerge: observed (i) strong genome-wide skew (>80%) towards
alleles art-r parent mosquito stage, dropped ~50% 
blood stage selfed art-r parasites selected against; (ii) repeatable 
allele specific skews blood stage parasites particularly strong selection
(selection coefficient (s) ≤ 0.18/asexual cycle) alleles art-r
parent loci chromosome 12 containing mrp2 chromosome 14 containing
arps10. approach robustly identifies selected loci strong potential 
for identifying parasite genes interact mosquito vector or
compensatory loci involved drug resistance.
