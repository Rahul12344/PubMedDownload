escherichia coli klebsiella pneumoniae producing extended-spectrum
β-lactamases (esbls) among multidrug-resistant pathogens in
hospitals spreading worldwide. horizontal gene transfer spread of
high-risk clones involved esbl dissemination. investigation the
resistance phenotypes 101 consecutive clinical e. coli (n=58) k.
pneumoniae (n=43) isolated komfo anokye teaching hospital ghana 3 
months revealed 63 (62%) esbl phenotype. 63 blactx-m gene, 
sequence analysis showed 62 blactx-m-15. blactx-m-15 was
linked isecp1 orf477δ isolates, isolates also carried
blatem, aac(3)-ii, aaca4cr, and/or blaoxa-30 genes incf plasmids.
xbai/pulsed-field electrophoresis showed heterogeneity among isolates both
species, suggesting blactx-m-15 dissemination caused horizontal gene
transfer rather clonal spread species ghana.
