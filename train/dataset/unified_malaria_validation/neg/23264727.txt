plasmodium falciparum surfin(4.1) type transmembrane protein thought to
locate merozoite surface responsible reversible adherence 
to erythrocyte invasion. study, evaluated surf(4.1) gene
segment encoding extracellular region polymorphism, signature positive
selection, degree linkage disequilibrium, temporal change allele
frequency distribution p. falciparum isolates thailand 1988-89, 2003, 
and 2005. found surfin(4.1) highly polymorphic, particularly the
c-terminal side variable region located predicted
transmembrane region. signature positive diversifying selection the
variable region detected multiple tests and, lesser extent, on
conserved n-terminally located cysteine-rich domain tajima's test. linkage
disequilibrium sites long distance (> 1.5 kb) detected, and
multiple surfin(4.1) haplotype sequences detected 1988/89 still circulated 
2003. single amino acid polymorphism allele frequency distributions
were significantly different 1988/89 2003 groups, suggesting that
the frequency distribution surfin(4.1) extracellular region remained stable
over 14 years.
