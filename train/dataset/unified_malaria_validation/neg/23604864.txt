background: plasmodium vivax prevalent malaria species brazil. the
parasite-host coevolutionary process viewed 'arms race', which
adaptive genetic changes one eventually matched alterations the
other.
methods: following candidate gene approach analyzed cd40, cd40l and
blys genes participate b-cell co-stimulation, associations p.
vivax malaria. study sample included 97 patients 103 controls. we
extracted dna using extraction purification commercial kit identified
the following snps: -1c > cd40 gene, -726t > c cd40l gene the
-871c > blys gene using pcr-rflp. analyzed genotype allele
frequencies direct counting. also compared observed expected
genotype frequencies using hardy-weinberg equilibrium.
results: allele genotype frequencies snps differ
statistically patient control groups. gene-gene interactions not
observed cd40 blys cd40l blys genes. overall,
the genes hardy-weinberg equilibrium. significant differences not
observed among frequencies antibody responses p. vivax sporozoite 
and erythrocytic antigens cd40 blys genotypes.
conclusions: results study show that, although investigated cd40,
cd40l blys alleles differ functionally, variation alter the
functionality molecules way would interfere susceptibility to
the disease. variants genes may influence clinical course rather
than simply increase decrease susceptibility.
