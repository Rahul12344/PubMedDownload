the actomyosin motor complex glideosome provides force needed by
apicomplexan parasites toxoplasma gondii (tg) plasmodium falciparum
(pf) invade host cells gliding motility motile forms.
glideosome associated protein 45 (pfgap45) essential component the
glideosome complex facilitates anchoring effective functioning the
motor. dissection events regulate pfgap45 may provide insights how
the motor glideosome operate. found pfgap45 phosphorylated 
response phospholipase c (plc) calcium signaling. phosphorylated 
p. falciparum kinases protein kinase b (pfpkb) calcium dependent protein
kinase 1 (pfcdpk1), calcium dependent enzymes, s89, s103 s149.
the phospholipase c pathway influenced phosphorylation s103 s149. 
phosphorylation pfgap45 sites differentially regulated during
parasite development. localization pfgap45 association may be
independent phosphorylation sites. pfgap45 regulation response
to calcium fits well previously described role calcium host
cell invasion malaria parasite.
