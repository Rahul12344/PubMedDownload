background: markedly high failure rate three-day artesunate-mefloquine was
observed area along thai-myanmar border.
methods: identification plasmodium falciparum isolates intrinsic
resistance component artesunate-mefloquine combination was
analysed integrated information clinico-parasitological response,
together systemic drug exposure (area blood/plasma concentration-time 
curves (auc)) dihydroartemisinin mefloquine, vitro sensitivity of
p. falciparum total 17 29 p. falciparum isolates patients
with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria. analysis contribution in
vitro parasite sensitivity systemic drug exposure relationship with
pfmdr1 copy number group sensitive response performed 21 69
cases.
results: identification resistance and/or reduced intrinsic parasitocidal
activity artesunate and/or mefloquine without pharmacokinetic other
host-related factors confirmed six cases: one reduced sensitivity to
artesunate alone, two resistance mefloquine alone, three reduced
sensitivity artesunate combined resistance mefloquine. resistance
and/or reduced intrinsic parasitocidal activity mefloquine/artesunate,
together contribution pharmacokinetic factor mefloquine and/or
artesunate identified seven cases: two resistance mefloquine
alone, five resistance mefloquine combined reduced sensitivity
to artesunate. pharmacokinetic factor alone contributed recrudescence three
cases, inadequate whole blood mefloquine levels (auc0-7days).
other host-related factors contributed recrudescence one case.
amplification pfmdr1 (increasing pfmdr1 copy number) related molecular
marker artesunate-mefloquine resistance seems suitable molecular
marker predict occurrence recrudescence.
conclusions: despite evidence low level decline sensitivity of
p. falciparum isolates artemisinins areas along thai-myanmar border,
artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) would expected remain key
anti-malarial drug treatment multidrug resistance p. falciparum. continued
monitoring active surveillance clinical efficacy act, including
identification true artemisinin resistant parasites, required for
appropriate implementation malaria control policy area.
