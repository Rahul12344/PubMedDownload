background: multiplicity genetic diversity plasmodium falciparum infection
might play role determining clinical outcome malaria infection and
could fair reflection disease transmission rate. study
investigated genetic diversity p. falciparum multiplicity infection
in relation severity malaria age patients gezira state,
sudan.
methods: cross-sectional health facilities-based survey conducted gezira
state, sudan january 2012. total 140 p. falciparum malaria patients
diagnosed microscopy confirmed using nested pcr recruited and
classified uncomplicated malaria severe malaria states according 
standard criteria. dna extracted msp1 msp2 allelic families 
determined using nested pcr.
results: overall multiplicity infection (moi) 2.25 2.30 2.15
for uncomplicated severe malaria respectively. statistically
significant differences uncomplicated severe malaria (sm) patient
groups moi regard msp1, msp2 overall moi (mann-whitney u-test; all
p < 0.05). predominant msp1 allelic families mad20 uncomplicated
malaria ro33 severe malaria. distribution fc27 ic1/3d7
msp2 allelic families approximately across disease severity. one
hundred eleven p. falciparum isolates (81 %) consisted multiple genotypes;
71/90 (78.9 %) uncomplicated malaria 40/50 (85.1 %) severe malaria
patient groups. neither msp1 msp2 allelic families showed association with
malaria severity. statistically significant differences multiplicity of
infection observed different age groups.
conclusion: study majority p. falciparum isolates from
uncomplicated severe malaria patients consisted multiple genotypes.
further molecular epidemiological studies delineate link p.
falciparum genotype malaria phenotype different regions are
encouraged.
