background: despite evident success malaria control many sites the
arabian peninsula, malaria remains endemic spots, yemen and
south-west saudi arabia. addition local transmission, imported malaria
sustains extra source parasites challenge strengths local
control strategies. study examined genetic diversity plasmodium
falciparum yemen mutations drug resistant genes, elucidate parasite 
structure distribution drug resistance genotypes region.
methods: five polymorphic loci (msp-2, pfg377 three microsatellites on
chromosome 8) involved anti-malarial drug resistance, four drug
resistant genes (pfcrt, pfmdr1, dhfr dhps) genotyped 108 p.
falciparum isolates collected three sites yemen: dhamar, hodeidah taiz.
results: high diversity seen non-drug genes, pfg377 (he = 0.66), msp-2
(he = 0.80) three microsatellites chr 8, 7.7 kb (he = 0.88), 4.3 kb
(he = 0.77) 0.8 kb (he = 0.71). high level mixed-genotype
infections (57%), average 1.8 genotypes per patient. linkage
disequilibrium seen drug resistant genes non-drug markers
(p < 0.05). genetic differentiation populations low (most pair-wise
fst values <0.03), indicating extensive gene flow parasites the
three sites.
conclusion: high diversity p. falciparum yemen indicative large
parasite reservoir, represents challenge control efforts. presence
of two distinct pfcrt genotype, cviet svmnt, suggests chloroquine
resistance possibly related migratory path africa asia. 
absence triple mutant dhfr genotype (irn) dhps mutations supports 
use artesunate + sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine first-line therapy. however,
the prevalent pfmdr1 genotype nfsnd [21%] previously associated with
tolerance/resistance response artemisinin combination therapy (act). regular
surveys are, therefore, important monitor spread pfmdr1 dhfr mutations 
and response act.
