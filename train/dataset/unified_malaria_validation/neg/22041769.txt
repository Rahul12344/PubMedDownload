the cytochrome oxidase subunit (coxi) gene sequences three recent
(2007-2008) clinical plasmodium knowlesi isolates klang valley, peninsular
malaysia, determined compared older (1960's) peninsular
malaysia, recent isolates sarawak (on borneo island), isolate from
thailand. multiple alignment sequences showed three clinical
isolates similar older peninsular malaysia isolates to
those sarawak thailand. phylogenetic tree based coxi sequences
revealed three distinct clusters p. knowlesi. first cluster consisted of
isolates peninsular malaysia, second consisted sarawak isolates and
the third composed thailand isolate. findings study highlight 
the usefulness mitochondrial coxi gene suitable marker for
phylogeographic studies p. knowlesi.
