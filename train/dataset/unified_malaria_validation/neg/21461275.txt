relatively little studied ama-1 vaccine plasmodium vivax 
and plasmid dna vaccine encoding p. vivax ama-1 (pvama-1). present 
study, plasmid dna vaccine encoding ama-1 reemerging korean p. vivax has
been constructed preliminary study done cellular immunogenicity 
to recipient balb/c mice. pvama-1 gene cloned expressed the
plasmid vector ubpcama-1, protein band approximately 56.8 kda was
obtained transfected cos7 cells. balb/c mice immunized
intramuscularly using gene gun 4 times vaccine, proportions
of splenic t-cell subsets examined fluorocytometry week 2 the
last injection. spleen cells intramuscularly injected mice revealed no
significant changes proportions cd8(+) t-cells cd4(+) t-cells.
however, mice immunized using gene gun, significantly higher (p<0.05)
proportions cd8(+) cells observed compared ub vector-injected control 
mice. results indicated cellular immunogenicity plasmid dna
vaccine encoding ama-1 reemerging korean p. vivax weak was
injected intramuscularly; however, promising effect observed using gene
gun injection technique.
