redox balance essential survival, growth multiplication malaria
parasites oxidative stress involved mechanism action many
antimalarial drugs. hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) plays important role redox
signalling pathogen-host cell interactions. monitoring intra- and
subcellular redox events, highly sensitive specific probes required.
here, stably expressed ratiometric h2o2 redox sensor rogfp2-orp1 the
cytosol mitochondria plasmodium falciparum (p. falciparum) nf54-attb
blood-stage parasites evaluated sensitivity towards oxidative stress,
selected antimalarial drugs, novel lead compounds. compartments, 
sensor showed reproducible sensitivity towards h2o2 low micromolar range
and towards antimalarial compounds pharmacologically relevant concentrations. 
upon short-term exposure (4 h), artemisinin derivatives, quinine mefloquine
impacted h2o2 levels mitochondria, whereas chloroquine a
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) inhibitor affected cytosol; 24 h
exposure arylmethylamino steroids g6pd inhibitors revealed oxidation of
mitochondria cytosol, respectively. genomic integration h2o2 sensor
expressed subcellular compartments p. falciparum provides basis for
studying complex parasite-host cell interactions drug effects with
spatio-temporal resolution preserving cell integrity, sets stage
for high-throughput approaches identify antimalarial agents perturbing redox
equilibrium.
