serine repeat antigen (sera) conserved among species genus plasmodium. 
sera genes form multigene family generally tandemly clustered a
single chromosome. although plasmodium species encode multiple sera genes,
the number varies species. among species, members share similar
sequences gene organization. sera possess central papain-like cysteine
protease domain, however, members, active site cysteine residue is
substituted serine. recent studies implicate gene family number 
of aspects parasite biology induction protective immune response. 
review summarizes current understanding important gene family in
several plasmodium species. plasmodium falciparum (pf)-sera family, for
example, consists nine gene members. unlike multigene families in
plasmodium species, pf-sera genes exhibit antigenic variation. pf-sera5
nucleotide diversity also low. moreover, although pf-sera5 highly
transcribed blood stage malaria infection, large amount is
released host blood following schizont rupture, malaria endemic
