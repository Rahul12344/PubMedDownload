only recently discovered haemoglobin (hb) belongs standard
gene repertoire insects, although tracheal system used for
respiration. classical oxygen-carrying function hb obvious for
hexapods living hypoxic environments. insect species, including the
common fruit fly drosophila melanogaster, physiological role hb yet
unclear. here, study recombinant haemoglobin european honeybee apis
mellifera (ame) malaria mosquito anopheles gambiae (aga). spectroscopic
evidence shows proteins classified hexacoordinate hbs 
strong affinity distal histidine. agahb1 proposed play role in
oxygen transport sensing based multimeric state, slow autoxidation, and
small significant amount five-coordinated haem deoxy ferrous form. 
amehb appears behave like vertebrate neuroglobin complex function 
given diversified distribution genome.
