we studied consensus sequences within four least 'variable blocks' (vb)
present dbl6ε domain var2csa, protein involved adhesion of
infected red blood cells plasmodium falciparum causes the
pregnancy-associated malaria (pam). characterising consensus sequences with
respect recognition antibodies percentage responders among pregnant 
women living areas p. falciparum endemic allows identification of
the antigenic sequences within vb. combining consensus
sequences among four serotypes vb1 vb5, often recognized ones
are expected induce pan-reactive antibodies recognizing var2csa all
plasmodial strains. sequences main interest design an
immunogenic molecule. using similar approach dbl6ε, studied the
five dbl cidrpam var2csa, identified vb segments
with highly conserved consensus sequences. addition, identified consensus
sequences var genes expressed non-pam parasites. finding paves
the way vaccine design pathologies caused p. falciparum.
