micrornas (mirnas) evolutionary conserved, small non-coding rna size
ranging 19 24 nucleotides. endogenously regulate gene expression
at post transcriptional level either translation repression mrna
degradation. mirnas shown potential used biomarker the
diagnosis, prognosis, therapy infectious diseases. many mirnas shown 
significantly altered expression infection. altered expression of
mirna level infected human identified use advanced
diagnostic tools. review, highlighted use mirna an
emerging tool identification human infectious disease. till date, 
several mirnas reported molecular biomarker infectious
diseases, mirna-150 mirna-146b-5p human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv); mirna-122, mirna-21, mirna-34a hepatitis; mirna-361-5p and
mirna-29c tuberculosis; mirna-16 mirna-451 malaria mirna-181 in
helicobacter pylori infection. diagnosis infection help a
biomarker non-invasive tool shown key role early
diagnosis infection. discovery circulating mirna blood of
infected patients potential become powerful non-invasive biomarker
in coming future.
