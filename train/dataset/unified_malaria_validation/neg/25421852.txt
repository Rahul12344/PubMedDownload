background: elevated expression enzymes insecticide metabolism
activity lead high levels insecticide resistance malaria vector,
anopheles gambiae. study, adult female mosquitoes insecticide
susceptible resistant strain dissected four different body parts.
rna samples used microarray analysis determine the
enrichment patterns key detoxification gene families within mosquito
and identify additional candidate insecticide resistance genes may have
been overlooked previous experiments whole organisms.
results: general enrichment transcription genes four major
detoxification gene families (carboxylesterases, glutathione transferases, udp
glucornyltransferases cytochrome p450s) observed midgut and
malpighian tubules. yet subset p450 genes previously been
implicated insecticide resistance gambiae, show surprisingly varied
profile tissue enrichment, confirmed qpcr and, three candidates, by
immunostaining. stringent selection process used define list 105
genes significantly (p â‰¤0.001) expressed body parts the
resistant versus susceptible strain. half these, including the
cytochrome p450s list, identified previous whole organism
comparisons strains, several new candidates detected,
notably comparisons transcriptomes dissected abdomen
integuments.
conclusions: use rna extracted whole organism identify
candidate insecticide resistance genes risk missing candidates key
genes responsible phenotype restricted expression within body
and/or expression certain tissues. however, transcription 
genes implicated metabolic resistance insecticides enriched any
one single organ, comparison transcriptome individual dissected body
parts cannot recommended preferred means identify new candidate
insecticide resistant genes. instead rich data set vivo sites of
transcription consulted designing follow qpcr validation steps,
or screening known candidates field populations.
