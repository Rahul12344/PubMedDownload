the discovery understanding antigenic proteins essential for
development vaccine malaria. plasmodium falciparum, pf92 have
been characterized merozoite surface protein, protein expressed 
at late schizont stage, study pv92, orthologue pf92 p.
vivax, reported. thus, protein structure pv92 analyzed, and
the gene sequence aligned plasmodium spp. using
bioinformatics tools. recombinant pv92 protein expressed purified
using bacterial expression system used immunization mice gain the
polyclonal antibody evaluation antigenicity protein array. also,
the antibody pv92 used subcellular analysis immunofluorescence
assay. pv92 protein signal peptide sexual stage s48/45 domain,
and cysteine residues n-terminal pv92 completely conserved.
the n-terminal pv92 successfully expressed soluble form using a
bacterial expression system. antibody raised pv92 recognized the
parasites completely merged pvmsp1-19, indicating pv92 was
localized merozoite surface. evaluation human humoral immune
response pv92 indicated moderate antigenicity, 65% sensitivity 95%
specificity protein array. taken together, merozoite surface localization 
and antigenicity pv92 implicate might involved attachment and
invasion merozoite new host cell immune evasion invasion
process.
