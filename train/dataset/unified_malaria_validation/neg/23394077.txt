background: transgenic plasmodium falciparum expressing luciferase offers an
attractive bioluminescence-based assay platform investigation the
pharmacological properties anti-malarial drugs. side-by-side comparison
of bioluminescence fluorescence-based assays, utilizing luciferase reporter
cassette confers strong temporal pattern luciferase expression during
the s-phase intraerythrocytic development, reported.
methods: key assay parameters range commercially available luminogenic
substrates determined compared measured using malaria sybr
green fluorescence assay. addition, short-term temporal effects of
anti-malarial compounds evaluated using bioluminescent fluorescent
assay platforms.
results: z', % coefficient variation 50% inhibition concentrations are
essentially bioluminescent fluorescent assays transgenic
parasites generated chloroquine-sensitive -resistant genetic
backgrounds. bioluminescent assays, irrespective luminogenic agent
employed, do, however, offer significantly enhanced signal-to-noise ratios.
moreover, bioluminescent assay dynamic terms determining
temporal effects immediately following drug perturbation.
conclusion: study suggests opportunities bioluminescence-based
assays lie measurement 50% inhibition concentrations, the
cheaper fluorescence assay performs excellently restricted need
to genetically modify parasite clone investigation. instead, assays
that use dynamic response luciferase reporter semi-automated
screening additional pharmacological properties, relative rate-of-kill
and lethal dose estimation, attractive development opportunity.
