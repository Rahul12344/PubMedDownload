plasma membrane ca2+-atpases key calcium exporter proteins tissues,
and pmca4b main calcium transporter human red blood cells (rbcs).
in order assess expression level pmca4b, developed flow
cytometry specific antibody binding method quantitatively detect this
protein erythrocyte membrane. interestingly, found several healthy
volunteers showing significantly reduced expression rbc-pmca4b. western blot
analysis isolated rbc membranes confirmed observation, indicated that
there compensatory alterations pmca isoforms. addition,
reduced pmca4b levels correlated lower calcium extrusion capacity these
erythrocytes. exploring potential genetic background reduced
pmca4b levels, found missense mutations atp2b4 coding regions, while
a formerly unrecognized minor haplotype predicted second promoter region
closely correlated lower erythrocyte pmca4b protein levels. recent gwa
studies, snps atp2b4 haplotype linked reduced mean
corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations (mchc), protection malaria
infection. data suggest altered regulation gene expression is
responsible reduced rbc-pmca4b levels probably linked the
development human disease-related phenotypes.
