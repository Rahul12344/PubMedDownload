malaria infections containing multiple parasite genotypes ubiquitous in
nature, play central role models recombination, intra-host dynamics, 
virulence, sex ratio, immunity drug resistance evolution plasmodium. while
these multiple infections (mis) often assumed result superinfection
(bites multiple infected mosquitoes), know remarkably little 
composition generation. isolated 336 parasite clones eight patients
from malawi (high transmission) six thailand (low transmission) by
dilution cloning. genotyped using 384 single-nucleotide polymorphisms,
revealing 22 independent haplotypes malawi (2-6 per mi) 15 thailand
(2-5 per mi). surprisingly, six patients thailand six eight 
malawi contained related haplotypes, haplotypes similar within-
than between-infections. results argue simple superinfection
model. instead, observed kinship patterns may explained inoculation 
multiple related haploid sporozoites single mosquito bites, immune
suppression parasite subpopulations within infections, serial transmission
of related parasites people. relatedness maintained endemic
areas face repeated bites infected mosquitoes profound
implications understanding malaria transmission, immunity intra-host
dynamics co-infecting parasite genotypes.
