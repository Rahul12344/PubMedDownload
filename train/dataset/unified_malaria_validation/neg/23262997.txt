plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, become matter concern due
to recent reports life-threatening severity development parasite
resistance different antimalarial drugs. magnitude problem still
undetermined. present study undertaken determine vivo efficacy 
of chloroquine (cq) chloroquine plus primaquine p. vivax malaria in
kolkata polymorphisms pvmdr1 pvcrt-o genes. total 250
patients p. vivax monoinfection recruited randomized two
groups, b; treated chloroquine chloroquine plus primaquine,
respectively; followed 42 days according protocol 2009. 
data analyzed using per-protocol analyses. assessed polymorphisms 
pvmdr1 pvcrt-o genes dna-sequencing method. 250 patients
recruited, 204 completed 42-day follow-up period, 101 group 103 in
group b. group a, non-pcr-corrected efficacy cq 99% (95% confidence
interval [ci], 0.944 1.00), group b, cases classified as
adequate clinical parasitological response (acpr). day 3 positivity was
observed 11 (5.3%) cases. specific mutation pattern recorded the
pvcrt-o gene. eight nonsynonymous mutations found pvmdr1 gene, three 
of new. y976f mutation detected isolate.
chloroquine, either alone combination primaquine, still effective
against p. vivax malaria study area. (the study protocol registered in
ctri [clinical trial registry-india] indian council medical research
under registration no. ctri/2011/09/002031.).
