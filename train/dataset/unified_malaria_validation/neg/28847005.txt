in two previously described donors, extracellular domain lair1, a
collagen-binding inhibitory receptor encoded chromosome 19 (ref. 1), was
inserted v dj segments antibody. insertion generated, 
through somatic mutations, broadly reactive antibodies rifins, type 
variant antigen expressed surface plasmodium falciparum-infected
erythrocytes. investigate frequently antibodies produced in
response malaria infection, screened plasma two large cohorts of
individuals living malaria-endemic regions. report 5-10% of
malaria-exposed individuals, none european blood donors tested, have
high levels lair1-containing antibodies dominate response infected
erythrocytes without conferring enhanced protection febrile malaria. by
analysing antibody-producing b cell clones protein, cdna gdna
levels, characterized additional lair1 insertions v dj
segments discovered second insertion modality whereby lair1 exon
encoding extracellular domain flanking intronic sequences inserted
into switch region. exon shuffling, mechanism leads production
of bispecific antibodies lair1 domain precisely positioned the
elbow vh ch1 domains. additionally, one donor genomic dna 
encoding vh ch1 domains deleted, leading production a
camel-like lair1-containing antibody. sequencing switch regions memory 
b cells european blood donors revealed frequent templated inserts
originating transcribed genes that, rare cases, comprised exons with
orientations frames compatible expression. results reveal
different modalities lair1 insertion lead public dominant
antibodies infected erythrocytes suggest insertion templated 
dna represents additional mechanism antibody diversification be
selected immune response pathogens exploited b cell
