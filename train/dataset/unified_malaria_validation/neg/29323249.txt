plasmodium gametocytes sexual forms malaria parasite essential for
transmission mosquitoes. better understand gametocytes differ from
asexual blood-stage parasites, performed systematic analysis available
'omics data p. falciparum plasmodium species. 18 transcriptomic and
proteomic data sets evaluated presence curated "gold standards"
of 41 gametocyte-specific versus 46 non-gametocyte genes integrated using
bayesian probabilities, resulting gametocyte-specificity scores p.
falciparum genes. illustrate utility gametocyte score, explored 
newly predicted gametocyte-specific genes potential biomarkers gametocyte
carriage exposure. analyzed humoral immune response field samples
against 30 novel gametocyte-specific antigens found five antigens be
differentially recognized gametocyte carriers compared malaria-infected 
individuals without detectable gametocytes. also validated the
gametocyte-specificity 15 identified gametocyte transcripts culture
material samples naturally infected individuals, resulting eight
transcripts >1000-fold higher expressed gametocytes compared to
asexual parasites whose transcript abundance allowed gametocyte detection 
naturally infected individuals. integrated genome-wide gametocyte-specificity
scores provide comprehensive resource identify targets monitor p.
falciparum gametocytemia.
