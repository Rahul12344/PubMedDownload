malaria significant public health problem several tropical countries
including thailand. prevalence plasmodium vivax infection been
increasing past decades. plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein
(pvmsp) gene encodes malaria vaccine candidate antigen. polymorphic nature 
leads antigenic variation, barrier vaccine development, drug
resistance, potential multiple-clone infections within malaria
patients. objective study investigate genetic diversity of
pvmsp1 pvmsp3 gene p. vivax populations thailand. total 100 p.
vivax isolates collected western (kanchanaburi tak provinces) and
southern (ranong provinces) regions along thai-myanmar border analyzed
using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism
(pcr-rflp). analysis f1, f2, f3 regions pvmsp1 revealed 5, 2, 3
allelic variants, respectively. three major types pvmsp3-α two major types
of pvmsp3-β identified based pcr product sizes. digestion 
restriction enzymes, 29, 25, 26, 18 patterns distinguished rflp for
pvmsp1 (f2, alu i), pvmsp1 (f2, mnl i), pvmsp3-α, pvmsp3-β, respectively.
combination family variant (pvmsp1 pvmsp3) resulted high genetic
polymorphism p. vivax population. additionally, using pvmsp1 polymorphic
marker revealed significant association multiple-genotype infections
and p. vivax parasitemia. results strongly supported p. vivax
populations endemic areas along thai-myanmar border highly
diverse.
