background. prominent variant surface antigens (vsas) plasmodium
falciparum var gene-encoded plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane
protein 1 (pfemp1) family, serves parasite-sequestering ligand to
endothelial cells. study examined antibody reactivity of
autologous plasma symptomatic asymptomatic malaria infected children
against infected erythrocytes' surface antigens using flow cytometry.
methods. ethidium-bromide-labelled erythrocytic mature forms p. falciparum
parasites obtained symptomatic asymptomatic children sequentially
incubated autologous plasma fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (fitc)
antihuman igg. plasma antibody reactivity detected flow cytometry.
results. asymptomatic children prevalence trophozoites peripheral 
blood (66%) compared symptomatic children (16%), p = 0.002. mean
percentage infected rbcs reacting autologous sera 89.78 among
symptomatic children compared 79.62 among asymptomatic children (p = 0.09).
moreover, mean fluorescence intensity (mfi) asymptomatic was
significantly higher compared symptomatic children (p value = 0.040).
conclusion. variant surface antigens plasmodium falciparum infected rbcs 
symptomatic malaria children tend better recognized igg antibodies. this
may suggest role igg antibodies severity malaria.
