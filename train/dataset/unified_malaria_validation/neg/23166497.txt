mosquito immunity studies focused mainly characterizing immune effector
mechanisms elicited parasites, bacteria recently, viruses.
however, elicited entomopathogenic fungi remain poorly understood, 
despite ubiquitous nature microorganisms unique invasion
route bypasses midgut epithelium, important immune tissue and
physical barrier. here, used malaria vector anopheles gambiae model
to investigate role melanization, potent immune effector mechanism of
arthropods, mosquito defense entomopathogenic fungus beauveria
bassiana, using vivo functional genetic analysis confocal microscopy. 
temporal monitoring fungal growth mosquitoes injected b. bassiana
conidia showed melanin eventually formed stages, including conidia,
germ tubes hyphae, except single cell hyphal bodies. nevertheless,
melanin rarely aborted growth stages mycelium
continued growing despite melanized. silencing tep1 clipa8, key
positive regulators plasmodium bacterial melanization a. gambiae,
abolished completely melanin formation hyphae germinating conidia
or germ tubes. detection layer hemocytes surrounding germinating
conidia hyphae suggested melanization early fungal stages is
cell-mediated late stages humoral response dependent tep1
and clipa8. microscopic analysis revealed specific association tep1 with
surfaces hyphae requirement both, tep1 clipa8, recruiting
phenoloxidase surfaces. finally, fungal proliferation rapid 
tep1 clipa8 knockdown mosquitoes exhibited increased sensitivity to
natural b. bassiana infections controls. sum, mosquito melanization
response retards significantly b. bassiana growth dissemination, finding
that may exploited design transgenic fungi potent bio-control
activities mosquitoes.
