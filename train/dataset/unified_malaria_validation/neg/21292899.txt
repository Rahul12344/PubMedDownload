the malaria vaccine candidate antigens erythrocyte binding antigen 175 (eba-175),
merozoite surface protein 3 (msp-3), apical membrane antigen (ama-1) from
plasmodium falciparum isolates countries central west africa were
assessed allelic diversity. samples collected filter paper 600
p. falciparum-infected symptomatic patients cameroon, republic congo,
burkina faso, ghana, senegal screened class-specific amplification
fragments. genetic diversity, assessed mean heterozygosity, comparable
among countries. detected clinical increase eba 175 f-allele frequency
from west east across study region. statistical difference msp-3
allele distribution countries observed. ama-1 3d7 alleles were
present lower frequency central africa west africa. also
detected little genetic differentiation among sampling locations. this
finding indicates that, least level resolution offered by
restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, antigens showed
remarkable genetic homogeneity throughout region sampled, perhaps caused by
balancing selection maintain diverse array antigen haplotyes.
