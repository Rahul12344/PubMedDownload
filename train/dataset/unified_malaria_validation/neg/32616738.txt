the genomic diversity plasmodium malariae malaria parasites understudied,
partly infected individuals tend present low parasite densities, 
leading difficulties obtaining sufficient parasite dna genome analysis.
selective whole genome amplification (swga) increases relative levels of
pathogen dna clinical sample, adapted p. malariae
parasites. design customized swga primers successfully amplify p.
malariae dna extracted directly unprocessed clinical blood samples obtained 
from patients p. malariae-mono-infections six countries, further
test efficacy swga mixed infections plasmodium spp. swga
enables successful whole genome sequencing samples low parasite
density (i.e. one sample parasitaemia 0.0064% resulted 44% the
genome covered by ≥ 5 reads), leading average 14-fold increase genome
coverage compared unamplified samples. identify total 868,476
genome-wide snps, 194,709 unique across 18 high-quality isolates.
after exclusion hypervariable subtelomeric regions, high-quality core
subset 29,899 unique snps defined. population genetic analysis suggests
that p. malariae parasites display clear geographical separation continent.
further, swga successfully amplifies genetic regions interest as
orthologs p. falciparum drug resistance-associated loci (pfdhfr, pfdhps,
pfcrt, pfk13 pfmdr1), several non-synonymous snps detected 
genes. conclusion, established robust swga approach assist 
whole genome sequencing p. malariae, thereby facilitate implementation
of much-needed large-scale multi-population genomic studies neglected
malaria parasite. demonstrated plasmodia, genetic diversity
studies provide insights biology underlying disease inform
malaria surveillance control measures.
