purpose: introduction artemisinin-based combination therapies (acts) in
treating uncomplicated malaria sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) intermittent
preventive treatment pregnancy drastically decreased burden of
malarial disease around world. however, acts known select drug
resistance markers. gabon, artemether-lumefantrine induced increase 
prevalence n86-pfmdr1, associated treatment failure. however,
little data available regarding resistance markers southeastern gabon.
this study aimed evaluate evolution resistance haplotypes pfcrt,
pfdhps, pfdhfr, pfk13 genes 2011 2014 southeastern gabon.
methods: total 233 plasmodium falciparum dna samples collected from
febrile pediatric patients south gabon: franceville, urban area;
koulamoutou, semi-urban area; lastourville, rural area. pfcrt, pfdhps,
pfdhfr, propeller domain pfk13 sequenced isolates.
results: overall prevalence (3.7%-11.5%) wild-type haplotype pfcrt
72-76 cvmnk significantly different 2011 2014 southeast
gabon. pfdhfr (codons 51, 59, 108, 164), irni triple-mutant haplotype was
the prevalent (>89.0%). icni ncni mutant haplotypes ncsi
wild-type haplotype showed minor prevalence. differences the
distributions haplotypes across 4 years three study sites.
for pfdhps, aakaa sgkaa mutant haplotypes sakaa wild-type
haplotype similarly present three areas study period. 
agkaa double mutant first observed 2013 franceville 2014 in
koulamoutou lastourville. interestingly, a578s mutation (0.4%) and
two new a494v (0.4%) v504a (0.9%) mutations found pfk13.
conclusion: despite withdrawal chloroquine, frequency resistant
allele 76t remained high south gabon. moreover, high level of
resistant haplotypes iptp-sp found.
