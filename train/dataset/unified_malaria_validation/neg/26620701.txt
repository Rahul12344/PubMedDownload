background: endothelial protein c receptor (epcr) recently identified a
key receptor plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 mediating
sequestration p. falciparum-infected erythrocytes patients suffering from
severe malaria. soluble epcr (sepcr) inhibits binding p. falciparum epcr in
vitro increased levels sepcr associated h3 haplotype of
the epcr encoding procr gene. hypothesized elevated sepcr
levels, possibly linked procr h3 genetic variant, may confer protection
against severe forms malaria. study determined frequencies procr
haplotypes h1-4 plasma levels sepcr tanzanian study population to
investigate possible association severe malaria.
methods: study participants children 5 years age admitted the
korogwe district hospital (n = 143), diagnosed severe malaria (n = 
52; including cerebral malaria n = 17), uncomplicated malaria (n = 24), an
infection malaria (n = 67). addition, blood samples 71
children living nearby villages included. snps defining the
haplotypes procr gene determined post-pcr ligation detection
reaction-fluorescent microsphere assay.
results: individuals carrying least one h3 allele significantly higher
levels sepcr individuals h3 alleles (p < 0.001). difference in
the frequency h3 found non-malaria patients, malaria patients 
or village population (p > 0.1). plasma levels sepcr differed between
these three groups, higher sepcr levels village population compared
to hospitalized patients (p < 0.001) higher levels malaria patients
compared non-malaria patients (p = 0.001). however, differences found 
in distribution h3 (p = 0.2) levels sepcr (p = 0.8) patients
diagnosed severe uncomplicated malaria.
conclusion: frequencies snps determining procr haplotypes concordance 
with african studies. procr h3 allele associated higher levels
of sepcr, confirming earlier findings, however, tanzanian population;
neither procr haplotype level sepcr associated severe malaria,
however, larger studies needed confirm findings.
