the ratio non-synonymous synonymous substitutions (dn/ds) useful
measure strength mode natural selection acting protein-coding
genes. widely used study patterns selection protein genes a
genomic scale-from small genomes viruses, bacteria, parasitic
eukaryotes largest eukaryotic genomes. chapter describe the
steps necessary calculate dn/ds genes using least two
genomes. include brief discussion assigning orthologs, codon-aware
alignment orthologs. describe use codeml program the
paml package phylogenetic analysis calculate dn/ds perform 
some statistical tests positive selection. outline methods for
interpreting output describe one may use data make discoveries
about biology species. finally, worked example show the
steps used calculate dn/ds 3,261 orthologs six plasmodium species,
including tests adaptive evolution (see worked_example.pdf).
