the battle malaria substantially impeded recurrence of
drug resistance plasmodium falciparum, deadliest human malaria parasite.
to counter problem, novel antimalarial drugs urgently needed, especially 
those target unique pathways parasite, since less likely 
have side effects. mitochondrial type ii nadh dehydrogenase (ndh2) p.
falciparum, pfndh2 (pf3d7_0915000), considered good prospective
antimalarial drug target decade, since malaria parasites lack the
conventional multi-subunit nadh dehydrogenase, complex i, present the
mammalian mitochondrial electron transport chain (mtetc). instead, plasmodium
parasites contain single subunit ndh2, lacks proton pumping activity 
is absent humans. significant amount effort expended develop 
pfndh2 specific inhibitors, yet essentiality pfndh2 been
convincingly verified. herein, knocked pfndh2 p. falciparum via a
crispr/cas9 mediated approach. deletion pfndh2 alter parasite's
susceptibility multiple mtetc inhibitors, including atovaquone elq-300. we
also show antimalarial activity fungal ndh2 inhibitor hdq its
new derivative ck-2-68 due inhibition parasite cytochrome bc1
complex rather pfndh2. compounds directly inhibit the
ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity malarial bc1 complex. our
results suggest pfndh2 likely good antimalarial drug target.
