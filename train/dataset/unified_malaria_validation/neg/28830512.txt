background: dynamics histone modifications plasmodium falciparum
indicates existence unique mechanisms link epigenetic factors with
transcription. here, studied impact acetylated histone code on
transcriptional regulation intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (idc)
of p. falciparum.
results: using dominant-negative transgenic approach, showed that
acetylations histone h4 play direct role transcription. specifically,
these histone modifications mediate inverse transcriptional relationship
between factors cell proliferation host-parasite interaction. of
the four h4 acetylations, h4k8ac likely rate-limiting, regulatory step,
which modulates overall dynamics h4 posttranslational modifications.
h4k8ac exhibits maximum responsiveness hdac inhibitors highly
dynamic distribution pattern along genome p. falciparum idc.
moreover, h4k8ac functions mainly euchromatin occupancy shifts
from intergenic regions located upstream 5' end open reading frame the
protein coding regions. shift directly indirectly associated with
transcriptional activities corresponding genes. h4k8ac also active in
the heterochromatin stimulates expression main antigenic gene
family (var) presence promoter region.
conclusions: overall, demonstrate h4k8ac potential major regulator
of chromatin-linked transcriptional changes p. falciparum life cycle which
is associated euchromatin also heterochromatin
environment. potentially highly significant finding suggests a
regulatory connection growth parasite-host interaction 
play major role malaria parasite virulence.
