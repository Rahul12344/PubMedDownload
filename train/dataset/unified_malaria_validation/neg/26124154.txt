the aim study assess prevalence mutations plasmodium
falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps)
genes among pregnant women using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) an
intermittent preventive treatment (iptp). molecular epidemiological study p.
falciparum parasite resistance markers sp conducted august 2010 to
february 2012 mukono district central uganda. dna extracted 413 p.
falciparum-positive samples. real-time pcr, followed melting curve analysis,
was used characterize point mutations pfdhfr pfdhps genes 
associated sp resistance. prevalence single-nucleotide mutations 
in pfdhfr codons 51i, 59r, 108n pfdhps codons 437g 540e 
high (>98%), reaching 100% fixation one dose sp, prevalence of
581g 3.3% baseline, reaching 12.5% one dose sp. baseline, 
prevalence pfdhfr pfdhps quintuple mutations 89%, whereas sextuple
mutations (including 581g) prevalent (3.9%), reaching 16.7% one
dose sp. however, numbers infections follow-up visits small,
and hence insufficient statistical power test whether a
true rise prevalence allele. overall high frequency pfdhfr 
and pfdhps quintuple mutations throughout pregnancy excluded analyses 
possible associations certain haplotypes risk lower birth
weight anemia. however, women infected p. falciparum 1.3-g/dl-lower 
hemoglobin levels (p = 0.001) delivered babies 400-g-lower birth
weight (p = 0.001) compared nonparasitemic women. despite this, 44 women who
were p. falciparum positive baseline became negative one two doses of
sp (i.e., 50.5%), implying sp-iptp still efficacy. p. falciparum
resistance markers sp high population, whereas p. falciparum
infection associated poor birth outcomes.
