the pfmdr1 gene, encodes p-glycoprotein homolog 1, shown a
reliable marker resistance plasmodium falciparum related artesunate and
mefloquine combination therapy. aims study investigate the
copy number pfmdr1 p. falciparum isolates collected 4
malaria-endemic areas thailand (kanchanaburi, mae hongson, ranong, tak)
along thailand-myanmar (burma) border (thai-myanmar border) using sybr
green standard method taqman real-time polymerase chain reaction
(rt-pcr) compare efficiency (sensitivity specificity) sybr
green taqman rt-quantitative (q)pcr methods determining pfmdr1 gene
copy number. ninety-six blood samples collected onto filter paper from
patients uncomplicated falciparum malaria attended malaria clinics in
the kanchanaburi (n  =  45), mae hongson (n  =  18), ranong (n  =  11), tak
(n  =  22) provinces thailand. parasite genomic dna extracted dried
blood spots using qiacube™ automated sample preparation. pfmdr1 gene copy
number determined taqman (63 samples) sybr green (96 samples)
real-time pcr. seventy-one (74.0%), 14 (14.6%), 10 (10.4%), 1 (1%) isolates
carried 1, 2, 3, 4 pfmdr1 gene copies, respectively. forty-three 48
(89.6%), 6 11 (54.5%), 3 4 (75.0%) samples, respectively, showed
agreement results 1, 2, 3 pfmdr1 gene copies determined both
methods. efficiency sybr green identifying pfmdr1 gene copy number
was found significantly correlated taqman. considering its
simplicity relatively low cost, sybr green rt-qpcr therefore promising
alternative technique determination pfmdr1 copy number.
