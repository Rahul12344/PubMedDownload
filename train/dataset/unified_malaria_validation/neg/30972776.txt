the past decade witnessed dramatic decreases malaria-associated mortality 
and morbidity around world. progress largely due intensified
malaria control measures, implementation rapid diagnostics establishing 
network anticipate mitigate antimalarial drug resistance. however, the
ultimate tool malaria prevention development implementation 
effective vaccine. date, malaria vaccine efforts focused determining
which thousands antigens expressed plasmodium falciparum are
instrumental targets protective immunity. antigenic variation and
antigenic polymorphisms arising parasite genes immune selection present 
a daunting challenge target antigen selection prioritization, a
given caveat interpreting immune recall responses results monovalent
vaccine trials. immune evasion strategies executed parasite
highlight myriad ways become recurrent infection. this
review provides update immune effector mechanisms malaria focuses on
our improved ability interrogate complexity human immune system,
accelerated recent methodological advances. appreciating human immune 
landscape influences effectiveness longevity antimalarial immunity
will help explain conditions necessary immune effector mechanisms
to prevail.
