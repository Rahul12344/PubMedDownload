background: absence effective vaccine, malaria treatment and
eradication still challenge endemic areas globally. is
especially case current reported emergence resistance to
artemisinin agents southeast asia. study therefore explored the
prevalence k13-propeller gene polymorphisms among plasmodium falciparum
parasites northern uganda.
methods: adult patients (≥18 years) presenting out-patients department lira
and gulu regional referral hospitals northern uganda randomly recruited. 
laboratory investigation presence plasmodium infection among patients 
done using plasmodium falciparum exclusive rapid diagnostic test, histidine rich 
protein-2 (hrp2) (pf). finger prick capillary blood patients positive
malaria test spotted filter paper whatman no. 903. parasite dna 
extracted using chelex resin method sequenced mutations k13-propeller 
gene using sanger sequencing. pcr dna sequence products analyzed using in
dnasp 5.10.01software, data processed excel spreadsheet 2007.
results: total 60 parasite dna samples sequenced. polymorphisms 
k13-propeller gene detected four (4) 60 parasite dna samples
sequenced. non-synonymous polymorphism codon 533 previously detected in
cambodia found parasite dna samples analyzed. polymorphisms codon
522 (non-synonymous) codon 509 (synonymous) also found samples
analyzed. study found evidence positive selection plasmodium
falciparum population northern uganda (tajima's d = -1.83205; fu li's
d = -1.82458).
conclusions: polymorphism k13-propeller gene previously reported in
cambodia found ugandan plasmodium falciparum parasites. 
need continuous surveillance artemisinin resistance gene markers the
country.
