reticulocyte-binding homologues (rh) ligand family mediates merozoite 
invasion erythrocytes plasmodium falciparum. among five members this
family identified far, p. falciparum reticulocyte-binding homologue-5
(pfrh5) found essential parasite survival across strains 
differ virulence route host-cell invasion. based essential role 
in invasion early evidence sequence conservation, pfrh5 been
prioritized development vaccine candidate. however, little known
about extent genetic variability rh5 field potential
impact diversity clinical outcomes vaccine evasion. samples
collected prospective cohort study malaria incidence conducted in
kalifabougou, southwestern mali, used estimate genetic diversity,
measure haplotype prevalence, assess within-host dynamics pfrh5
variants time relation clinical malaria. total 10
nonsynonymous polymorphic sites identified pfrh5 gene, resulting in
13 haplotypes encoding unique protein variants. four variants not
been previously observed. plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte-binding homologue-5 
had low amino acid haplotype (h = 0.58) nucleotide (π = 0.00061) diversity.
by contrast leading blood-stage malaria vaccine candidate antigens,
amino acid differences associated changes risk febrile
malaria consecutive infections. conserved b- t-cell epitopes were
identified. results support prioritization pfrh5 possible
inclusion broadly cross-protective vaccine.
