background: production recombinant proteins proper conformation,
appropriate post-translational modifications easily scalable and
cost-effective system challenging. lactococcus lactis recently been
identified efficient gram positive cell factory production of
recombinant protein. others used expression host the
production selected malaria vaccine candidates. safety production 
system confirmed multiple clinical trials. explored l.
lactis cell factories production 31 representative plasmodium
falciparum antigens varying sizes (ranging 9 90 kda) varying
degree predicted structural complexities including eleven antigens with
multiple predicted structural disulfide bonds, considered
difficult-to-produce proteins.
results: 31 recombinant constructs attempted l. lactis expression
system, initial expression efficiency 55% 17 31 recombinant
gene constructs producing high levels secreted recombinant protein. the
majority constructs failed produce recombinant protein were
found consist multiple intra-molecular disulfide-bonds. found these
disulfide-rich constructs could produced high yields genetically fused
to intrinsically disorder protein domain (glurp-r0). exploiting the
distinct biophysical structural properties intrinsically disordered
protein region developed simple heat-based strategy fast purification of
the disulfide-rich protein domains yields ranging 1 40 mg/l.
conclusions: novel procedure production purification of
disulfide-rich recombinant proteins l. lactis described.
