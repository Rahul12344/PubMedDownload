the development method rapidly diagnose neospora caninum infection is
highly desirable. recombinase polymerase amplification (rpa), combined with
lateral flow (lf) strips, novel approach rapidly amplify visualize
dna. developed prototype lf-rpa assay, using primers probe that
targeted specific sequence n. caninum nc-5 gene. n. caninum-specific
lf-rpa assay first tested purified dna oocysts amplified n.
caninum dna detectable levels 10 min, constant temperature without
the need expensive thermocycler. designed rpa primers probe
displayed 100% specificity detecting n. caninum without cross-reaction
with dna nine related protozoan spp. (eg toxoplasma gondii, sarcocystis
gigantean, sarcocystis zuoi, hammondia hammondi, hammondia heydorni, eimeria
cylindrica, plasmodium falciparum, theileria annulata babesia bigemina).
although, lf-rpa assay detected amounts low 50 fg n. caninum dna, was
nearly 5-fold less sensitive previously published qpcr nested pcr
assays. tested diagnostic performance lf-rpa assay the
detection n. caninum dna aborted bovine fetal tissue samples, compared 
the results obtained nested pcr. 75 samples examined, 
18 (24%) 17 (22.6%) tested positive using lf-rpa nested pcr,
respectively. results indicate lf-rpa suitable assay rapid 
and reliable detection n. caninum.
