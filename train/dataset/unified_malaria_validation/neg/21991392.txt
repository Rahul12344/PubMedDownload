malaria transmission sub-saharan africa varies seasonally intensity.
outbreaks malaria occur beginning rainy season, whereas,
during dry season, reports disease less frequent. anopheles
gambiae mosquitoes, main malaria vector, observed year long their
densities low dry season generally lasts several months.
aestivation, seasonal migration, local adaptation suggested as
mechanisms enable mosquito populations persist dry season.
studies chromosomal inversions shown inversions 2la, 2rb, 2rc, 2rd, 
and 2ru associated various physiological changes confer aridity
resistance. however, little known phenotypic plasticity responds

mosquitoes acute desiccation conducted genome-wide analysis their
transcriptomes using affymetrix plasmodium/anopheles genome array. the
transcription 248 genes (1.7% transcripts) significantly affected
in experimental conditions, including 96 increased expression 152
with decreased expression. general, data indicate reduction the
metabolic rate mosquitoes exposed desiccation. transcripts accumulated at
higher levels desiccation associated oxygen radical
detoxification, dna repair stress responses. proportion transcripts
within 2la 2rs (2rb, 2rc, 2rd, 2ru) (67/248, 27%) similar the
percentage transcripts located within inversions (31%). data may
be useful efforts elucidate role chromosomal inversions aridity
tolerance. scope application anopheline genome demonstrates that
examining transcriptional activity relation genotypic adaptations greatly
expands number candidate regions involved desiccation response in
this important malaria vector.
