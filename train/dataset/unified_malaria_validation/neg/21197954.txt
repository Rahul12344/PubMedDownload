the pa3004 gene pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 originally annotated a
5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (mtap). however, pa3004 encoded protein 
uses 5'-methylthioinosine (mti) preferred substrate represents 
known example specific mti phosphorylase (mtip). mtip utilize
5'-methylthioadenosine (mta). inosine weak substrate k(cat)/k(m)
value 290-fold less mti second best substrate identified. the
crystal structure p. aeruginosa mtip (pamtip) complex hypoxanthine was
determined 2.8 å resolution revealed 3-fold symmetric homotrimer. the
methylthioribose phosphate binding regions pamtip similar mtaps,
and purine binding region similar purine nucleoside
phosphorylases (pnps). catabolism mta p. aeruginosa involves
deamination mti phosphorolysis hypoxanthine (mta → mti → hypoxanthine).
this pathway also exists plasmodium falciparum, purine nucleoside
phosphorylase (pfpnp) acts inosine mti. three tight-binding
transition state analogue inhibitors pamtip identified dissociation
constants picomolar range. inhibitor specificity suggests early
dissociative transition state pamtip. quorum sensing molecules associated
with mta metabolism bacterial pathogens suggesting pamtip potential
therapeutic target.
