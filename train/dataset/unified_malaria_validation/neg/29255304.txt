success eliminating malaria depend whether parasite evolution outpaces
control efforts. here, show plasmodium falciparum parasites (the
deadliest species causing human malaria) found in
low-transmission-intensity areas evolved invest transmission to
new hosts (reproduction) less within-host replication (growth) than
parasites found high-transmission areas. cellular level, this
adaptation manifests increased production reproductive forms (gametocytes) 
early infection expense processes associated multiplication
inside red blood cells, especially membrane transport protein trafficking. at
the molecular level, manifests changes expression levels genes 
encoding epigenetic translational machinery. specifically, expression levels 
of gene encoding ap2-g-the transcription factor initiates
reproduction-increase transmission intensity decreases. accompanied by
downregulation upregulation genes encoding hdac1 hda1-two histone
deacetylases epigenetically regulate parasite's replicative and
reproductive life-stage programmes, respectively. parasites reproductive mode 
show increased reliance prokaryotic translation machinery found inside the
plastid-derived organelles. thus, dissection parasite's adaptive
regulatory architecture identified new potential molecular targets for
malaria control.
