background: reliable measures anti-malarial resistance crucial malaria
control. resistance typically complex trait: multiple mutations single 
parasite (a haplotype genotype) necessary elaboration resistant
phenotype. frequency genetic motif (proportion parasite clones the
parasite population carry given allele, haplotype genotype) useful
measure resistance. areas high endemicity, malaria patients generally
harbour multiple parasite clones; multiplicities infection (mois)
greater one. however, standard experimental procedures allow
measurement marker prevalence (proportion patient blood samples test
positive given mutation combination mutations), frequency. 
misleading compare marker prevalence sites different mean
mois; frequencies required instead.
methods: bayesian statistical model developed estimate plasmodium
falciparum genetic motif frequencies prevalence data collected field.
to assess model performance computational speed, detailed simulation study 
was implemented. application model tested using datasets five
sites uganda. datasets included prevalence data markers resistance
to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine average moi estimate study site.
results: simulation study revealed genetic motif frequencies that
were estimated using model accurate precise conventional
estimates based direct counting. importantly, model require
measurements moi patient; used average moi patient
population. furthermore, dataset included partially genotyped patient blood 
samples, model imputed data missing. using model the
ugandan data, genotype frequencies estimated four biologically relevant 
genotypes identified.
conclusions: model allows fast, accurate, reliable estimation the
frequency genetic motifs associated resistance anti-malarials using
prevalence data collected malaria patients. model require
per-patient moi measurements easily analyse data five markers. the
model valuable tool monitoring markers anti-malarial drug
resistance, including markers resistance artemisinin derivatives and
partner drugs.
