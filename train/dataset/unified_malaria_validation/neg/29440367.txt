genetically attenuated malaria parasites (gap) arrest liver stage
development powerful immunogens afford complete durable protection
against sporozoite infection. late liver stage-arresting gap provide superior
protection sporozoite challenge mice compared early live
stage-arresting attenuated parasites. however, late liver
stage-arresting gap generated date. therefore, identification of
additional loci critical late liver stage development be
used generate novel late liver stage-arresting gaps importance. we
further explored genetic attenuation plasmodium yoelii combining two gene
deletions, plasmei2 liver-specific protein 2 (lisp2), cause late
liver stage arrest various degrees infrequent breakthrough blood stage
infection. dual gene deletion resulted synthetic lethal phenotype that
caused complete attenuation highly susceptible mouse strain. p.
yoeliiplasmei2-lisp2- arrested late liver stage development not
persist livers beyond 3 days infection. immunization gap
elicited robust protective antibody responses outbred inbred mice 
sporozoites, liver stages, blood stages well eliciting protective
liver-resident cells. immunization afforded protection both
sporozoite challenge blood stage challenge. findings provide evidence
that completely attenuated late liver stage-arresting gap achievable via 
synthetic lethal approach might enable path forward creation a
completely attenuated late liver stage-arresting p. falciparum gap.
