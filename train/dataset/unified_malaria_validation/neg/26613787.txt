if copy number variants (cnvs) predominantly deleterious, would expect
them efficiently purged populations large effective
population size (ne) populations small ne. malaria parasites
(plasmodium falciparum) provide excellent organism examine prediction,
because protozoan shows broad spectrum population structures within a
single species, large, stable, outbred populations africa, small unstable
inbred populations south america intermediate population
characteristics south east asia. characterized 122 single-clone parasites, 
without prior laboratory culture, malaria-infected patients seven
countries africa, south east asia south america using high-density
single-nucleotide polymorphism/cnv microarray. scored 134 high-confidence cnvs
across parasite exome, including 33 deletions 102 amplifications, which
ranged size <500 bp 59 kb, well 10,107 flanking, biallelic
single-nucleotide polymorphisms. overall, cnvs rare, small, skewed
toward low frequency variants, consistent deleterious model. relative to
african south east asian populations, cnvs significantly common 
south america, showed significantly less skew allele frequencies, were
significantly larger. background low frequency cnv, also identified
several high-frequency cnvs putative positive selection using fst
outlier analysis. included known adaptive cnvs containing rh2b pfmdr1, 
and several cnvs (e.g., dna helicase three conserved proteins) that
require investigation. data consistent significant impact 
of genetic structure cnv burden important human pathogen.
