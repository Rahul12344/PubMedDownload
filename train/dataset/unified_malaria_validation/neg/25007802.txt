background: resistance anti-malarials major public health problem
worldwide. deployment artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) 
have reports reduced sensitivity act malaria parasites in
south-east asia. tanzania, artemether-lumefantrine (alu) recommended
first-line drug treatment uncomplicated malaria. study surveyed the
distribution plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance protein-1 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) associated increased parasite tolerance to
alu, tanzania.
methods: total 687 plasmodium falciparum positive dried blood spots on
filter paper rapid diagnostic test strips collected finger pricks from
patients attending health facilities six regions tanzania mainland 
june 2010 august 2011 used. polymerase chain reaction-restriction
fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) technique used detect pfmdr1 snps 
n86y, y184f d1246y.
results: variations distribution pfmdr1 polymorphisms among 
regions. tanga region exceptionally high prevalence mutant alleles, 
mbeya highest prevalence wild type alleles. haplotype yfy was
exclusively prevalent tanga (29.6%) whereas nyd haplotype the
most prevalent regions. excluding tanga mbeya, four, common
pfmdr1 haplotypes vary remaining four regions (χ² = 2.3, p
= 0.512). nfd haplotype second prevalent haplotype all
regions, ranging 17% - 26%.
conclusion: first country-wide survey pfmdr1 mutations associated 
with act resistance. distribution individual pfmdr1 mutations codons 86,
184 1246 varies throughout tanzanian regions. general homogeneity 
in distribution common pfmdr1 haplotypes reflecting strict implementation of
alu policy tanzania overall prevalence nfd haplotype ranging 17
to 26% among haplotypes. continuation alu first-line drug this
haplotype expected keep rising, thus need continued
pharmacovigilance studies monitor delayed parasite clearance drug.
