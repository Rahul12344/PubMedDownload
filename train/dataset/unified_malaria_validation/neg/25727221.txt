object: chloroquine (cq) quinoline-based drug widely used prevention
and treatment malaria. recent studies provided evidence this
drug may also harbor antitumor properties, whereby cq possesses ability to
accumulate lysosomes blocks cellular process autophagy. therefore, 
the authors study set investigate whether cq analogs, in
particular clinically established antimalaria drugs, would also able exert 
antitumor properties, specific focus glioma cells.
methods: toward goal, authors treated different glioma cell lines with
quinine (qn), quinacrine (qnx), mefloquine (mfq), hydroxychloroquine (hcq)
and investigated endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress-induced cell death, autophagy,
and cell death.
results: agents blocked cellular autophagy exerted cytotoxic effects on
drug-sensitive drug-resistant glioma cells varying degrees potency
(qnx > mfq > hcq > cq > qn). furthermore, quinoline-based drugs killed glioma
cells highly resistant temozolomide (tmz), current standard of
care patients glioma. cytotoxic mechanism involved induction 
apoptosis er stress, indicated poly(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp)
cleavage chop/gadd153. induction er stress resulting apoptosis
could confirmed vivo setting, tumor tissues animals
treated quinoline-based drugs showed increased expression chop/gadd153,
along elevated tunel staining, measure apoptosis.
conclusions: thus, antimalarial compounds investigated study hold
promise novel class autophagy inhibitors treatment newly
diagnosed tmz-sensitive recurrent tmz-resistant gliomas.
