background: high-throughput molecular biology techniques yield vast amounts of
data, often detecting small portions ribonucleotides corresponding to
specific identifiers. existing bioinformatic methodologies categorize compare
these elements using inferred descriptive annotation given sequence
information irrespective fact may representative the
identifier whole.
results: annotations, matter granularity, aligned genomic
sequences therefore annotated genomic intervals. developed
absidconvert, methodology converting genomic identifiers first
mapping onto common universal coordinate system using interval tree
which subsequently queried overlapping identifiers. absidconvert many 
potential uses, including gene identifier conversion, identification features 
within genomic region, cross-species comparisons. utility is
demonstrated three case studies: 1) comparative genomic study mapping
plasmodium gene sequences corresponding human mosquito transcriptional
regions; 2) cross-species study incyte clone sequences; 3) analysis of
human ensembl transcripts mapped affymetrixÂ®; agilent microarray probes.
absidconvert currently supports id conversion 53 species given list of
input identifiers, genomic sequence, genome intervals.
conclusion: absidconvert provides efficient reliable mechanism for
conversion identifier domains interest. flexibility tool
allows custom definition identifier domains contingent upon availability 
and determination genomic mapping interval. genomes sequences
for genetic elements refined, tool become increasingly
useful accurate. absidconvert freely available web application or
downloadable virtual machine at: http://bioinformatics.louisville.edu/abid/.
