incidence sickle cell trait india high peninsular south,
south-eastern, central south-western india, north north-eastern 
india, absent. unicentric origin scd tribals nilgiri hills 
southern india proposed. present study frequency hbs trait
and beta-globin gene haplotypes conducted tribal-rich states of
chhattisgarh jharkhand get insight uneven distribution hbs 
in india. jharkhand borders hbs-high odisha chhattisgarh, and
hbs-low up, bihar bengal. cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis performed
on collected blood samples, detect sickle haemoglobin (hbs) followed by
dna analysis. hbs associated beta-gene haplotype constructed samples 
positive hbs tribals pcr-rflp. 805 (chhattisgarh - 261,
jharkhand - 544; greater 36 percent tribals) samples analysed hbs frequency 
was 13 percent chhattisgarh 3.3 percent jharkhand. within jharkhand,
frequencies varied considerably 10 percent tatanagar nil sahibganj.
the arab-india (ai) haplotype beta-globin cluster occurred low frequency,
confined mainly chhattisgarh. abundant haplotype the
populations east asian, + - - - - - +, rare hbs, mainly sahibganj
in east jharkhand, lacked ai. results indicate besides the
heterozygote advantage againstmalaria, uneven regional distribution hbs
trait restricted movement two different populations, dravidian
from south tibeto-burman east indianmainland which
failed tomeet, conjecture, due severe climatic conditions (deserts and
heat) prevailing parts central india. apparently, jharkhand became a
zone contact recent times.
