background: prevention transfusion-transmitted malaria at-risk children and
pregnant women endemic areas inexpensive chloroquine longer
effective due widespread drug resistance. urgent need devising
new strategies transfusion malarial safety. investigated frequency 
transfusion transmission malaria within ghanaian blood donation system
using blood donations 106 asymptomatic adult ghanaian blood donors.
study design methods: paired samples 106 blood donations recipients 
(before transfusion) tested anti-merozoite surface protein-1/2
using commercial lab21 malaria enzyme immunoassay (eia), four
antigen-specific in-house eias, plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pldh) eia. 
additionally, plasmodium dna screened using species-specific nested
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) pan-plasmodium quantitative pcr.
donor-recipient parasite identity defined two concordant genotyping
strategies.
results: plasmodium antibody prevalence 100% donors recipients,
with least one antigen. parasitemia prevalence 54.7% donors and
recipients median levels 20 5.3 copies/μl, respectively, the
difference correlated age (p = 0.0001). multiple species infections were
frequent (8.5%). twenty-four units parasitemic blood transfused to
nonparasitemic recipients, 10 (41.7%) became infected transfusion.
molecular genotyping 13 distinct markers (antigenic genes microsatellite
loci) identified three nine parasitemic recipients transfusion with
level allelic identity suggesting 14% 28% definite possible
transfusion-related parasitemia.
conclusion: none currently available screening assays appear suitable to
minimize transfusion malaria without compromising blood supply endemic
areas.
