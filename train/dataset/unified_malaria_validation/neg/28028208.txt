the renewed effort eliminate malaria permanently remove tremendous
burden highlights questions combination tools would sufficient in
various settings new tools need developed. gene drive mosquitoes
constitute promising set tools, multiple different possible approaches 
including population replacement introduced genes limiting malaria
transmission, driving-y chromosomes collapse mosquito population, gene
drive disrupting fertility gene thereby achieving population suppression or
collapse. approaches recent success advances under
laboratory conditions, raising urgency understanding could be
deployed real world potential impacts each. new analyses are
needed existing models gene drive primarily focus nonseasonal or
nonspatial dynamics. use mechanistic, spatially explicit, stochastic,
individual-based mathematical model simulate gene drive approach a
variety sub-saharan african settings. approach exhibits broad region of
gene construct parameter space successful elimination malaria
transmission due targeted vector species. introduction realistic
seasonality vector population dynamics facilitates gene drive success compared
with nonseasonal analyses. spatial simulations illustrate constraints release 
timing, frequency, spatial density challenging settings for
construct success. within parameter space success, gene drive
approach provides tool malaria elimination unlike anything presently
available. provided potential barriers success surmounted, achieves
high efficacy reducing transmission potential lower delivery requirements 
in logistically challenged settings.
