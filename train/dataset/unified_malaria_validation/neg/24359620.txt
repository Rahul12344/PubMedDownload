background: medicinal plant artemisia annua covered filamentous
trichomes glandular, artemisinin producing trichomes. high artemisinin
supply needed reduced cost treating malaria. artemisinin production
in bioreactors facilitated better insight obtained the
biosynthesis artemisinin metabolites. therefore, metabolic
activities glandular filamentous trichomes investigated the
transcriptome level.
results: laser pressure catapulting, glandular filamentous trichomes as
well apical sub-apical cells glandular trichomes collected and
their transcriptome sequenced using illumina rna-seq. de novo transcriptome
was assembled (trinity) studied differential expression analysis
(edger).a comparison transcriptome glandular filamentous
trichomes shows mep, mva, terpene lipid biosynthesis pathways are
significantly upregulated glandular trichomes. conversely, transcripts
coding specific sesquiterpenoid triterpenoid enzymes 8-epi-cedrol
synthase uncharacterized oxidosqualene cyclase significantly
upregulated filamentous trichomes. known artemisinin biosynthesis genes
are upregulated glandular trichomes detected apical and
sub-apical cells glandular trichomes. significant differential
expression could observed apical sub-apical cells.
conclusions: results underscore vast metabolic capacities a. annua
glandular trichomes nonetheless point existence specific terpene
metabolic pathways filamentous trichomes. candidate genes might be
involved artemisinin biosynthesis proposed based putative
function differential expression level.
