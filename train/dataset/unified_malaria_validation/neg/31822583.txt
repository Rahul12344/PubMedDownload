members haloacid dehalogenase (had) family metabolite phosphatases play
an important role regulating multiple pathways plasmodium falciparum
central carbon metabolism. show p. falciparum protein,
phosphoglycolate phosphatase (pgp), regulates glycolysis pentose pathway flux
in asexual blood stages via detoxifying damaged metabolite
4-phosphoerythronate (4-pe). disruption p. falciparum pgp gene caused
accumulation two previously uncharacterized metabolites, 2-phospholactate 
4-pe. 4-pe putative side product glycolytic enzyme,
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, accumulation inhibits the
pentose phosphate pathway enzyme, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-pgd).
inhibition 6-pgd 4-pe leads unexpected feedback response that
includes increased flux pentose phosphate pathway result partial
inhibition upper glycolysis, concomitant increased sensitivity to
antimalarials target pathways downstream glycolysis. results

parasite voracious appetite, requiring large amounts glucose and
nutrients rapid growth proliferation inside human red blood cells.
the host cell resource rich, double-edged sword; nutrient excess
can lead undesirable metabolic reactions harmful by-products. here, we
demonstrate parasite possesses metabolite repair enzyme (pgp) that
suppresses harmful metabolic by-products (via substrate dephosphorylation) and
allows parasite maintain central carbon metabolism. loss pgp leads to
the accumulation two damaged metabolites causes domino effect of
metabolic dysregulation. accumulation one damaged metabolite inhibits an
essential enzyme pentose phosphate pathway, leading substrate
accumulation secondary inhibition glycolysis. work highlights the
parasite coordinates metabolic flux eliminating harmful metabolic by-products 
to ensure rapid proliferation resource-rich niche.
