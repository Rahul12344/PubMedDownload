placental malaria caused plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes that
bind placental tissue. binding mediated var2csa, parasite antigen
coded var gene, interacts chondroitin sulfate (csa).
consequences include maternal anemia fetal growth retardation.
antibody-mediated immunity placental malaria acquired successive
pregnancies, target var2csa-specific protective antibodies unclear.
we assessed var2csa-specific antibodies pregnant women analyzed their
relationships protection placental infection, preterm birth, low
birthweight. antibody responses n-terminal region var2csa early 
pregnancy associated reduced risks infections low birthweight. 
among women infected pregnancy, increase csa binding inhibition 
associated reduced risks placental infection, preterm birth, low
birthweight. data suggest antibodies var2csa n-terminal region
mediate immunity placental malaria associated outcomes. results
validate current vaccine development efforts var2csa n-terminal constructs.
