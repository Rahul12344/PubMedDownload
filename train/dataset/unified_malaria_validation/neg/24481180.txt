background: disease-causing organisms notorious fast rates molecular
evolution ability adapt rapidly changes ecology. sex plays
a key role evolution, recent studies, humans multicellular
organisms, document genes expressed principally exclusively males
exhibit fastest rates adaptive evolution. however, despite importance 
of sexual reproduction many unicellular taxa, sex-biased gene expression 
its evolutionary implications overlooked.
methods: analyse genomic data multiple malaria parasite (plasmodium)
species proteomic data sets different parasite life cycle stages.
results: accelerated evolution male-biased genes examined in
multicellular taxa, analyses reveal accelerated evolution genes
with male-specific expression also feature unicellular organisms. this
'fast-male' evolution adaptive likely facilitated male-biased sex
ratio gametes mating pool. furthermore, propose exceptional
rates evolution observe driven interactions males host
immune responses.
conclusions: reveal novel form host-parasite coevolution enables
parasites evade host immune responses negatively impact upon fertility.
the identification parasite genes accelerated evolution important
implications identification drug vaccine targets. specifically,
vaccines targeting males vulnerable parasite evolution those
targeting females sexes.
