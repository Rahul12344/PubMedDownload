cytoadherence-linked asexual gene 9 (clag9), conserved plasmodium protein
expressed asexual blood stages, involved cytoadherence of
infected red blood cells (rbcs) endothelial lining blood vessels. here,
we show plasmodium falciparum clag9 (pfclag9) component the
pfclag9-rhoph complex involved merozoite binding human
erythrocytes. characterize pfclag9, expressed four fragments pfclag9,
encompassing entire protein. immunostaining analysis using anti-pfclag9
antibodies showed expression localization pfclag9 apical end the
merozoites. mass spectrometric analysis merozoite extracts after
immunoprecipitation using anti-pfclag9 antibody identified p. falciparum
rhoptry-associated protein 1 (pfrap1), pfrap2, pfrap3, pfrhoph2, pfrhoph3 
associated proteins. identified rhoptry proteins expressed, their
association pfclag9 domains assessed using protein-protein
interaction tools. showed pfclag9 binds human rbcs interacting
with glycophorin a-band 3 receptor-coreceptor complex. agreement 
cellular localization, pfclag9 strongly recognized antibodies generated
during natural infection. mice immunized c-terminal domain pfclag9
were partially protected subsequent challenge infection plasmodium
berghei, supporting biological role pfclag9 natural
infection. taken together, results provide direct evidence the
existence pfrhoph-clag9 complex plasmodium merozoite surface that
binds human rbcs.
