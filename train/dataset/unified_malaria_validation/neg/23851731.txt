a total 76 birds belonging 23 species 14 families examined 
presence plasmodium spp. haemoproteus spp. birds trapped four
localities gansu province, china, june-july 2011. dna isolated from
blood samples parasite detection, identification based pcr assays 
and sequences 479 bp cyt b gene. total prevalence haemosporidians
was 21.0%. haemoproteus spp. detected 14 birds (prevalence 18.4%). the
lineage cyapic1 cyanopica cyanus, parus major, passer montanus and
pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax new; genetically distinct probably
represents new species genus haemoproteus. three lineages represented
known species: rbs4 (from lanius tephronotus), lineage haemoproteus lanii;
coll2 (from turdus mupinensis), lineage haemoproteus pallidus turdus2
(from turdus rubrocanus), lineage haemoproteus minutus. lineage rbs5
(from lanius cristatus l. tephronotus) differs 1.4% rbs4 probably
represents intraspecific entity h. lanii. lineages tuchr1 (recorded
from t. mupinensis), ww1 (recorded upupa epops) ywt2 (recorded from
motacilla flava) linked known species moment. only
one bird positive plasmodium (prevalence 1.4%), i.e. p. major infected
with lineage grw4 plasmodium relictum. latter lineage been
considered previous studies typical migratory birds having
transmission tropical areas only; record sedentary bird china
suggests transmission temperate latitudes.
