blood parasites potential threats health penguins their
conservation management. little penguins eudyptula minor native to
australia new zealand, susceptible piroplasmids (babesia),
hemosporidians (haemoproteus, leucocytozoon, plasmodium) kinetoplastids
(trypanosoma). studied total 263 wild little penguins 20 sites along
the australian southeastern coast, addition 16 captive-bred little
penguins. babesia sp. identified seven wild little penguins, positive
individuals recorded new south wales, victoria tasmania. true prevalence
was estimated 3.4% 4.5%. round forms parasite were
observed, gene sequencing confirmed identity parasite and
demonstrated closely related babesia poelea boobies (sula spp.) and
b. uriae murres (uria aalge). none babesia-positive penguins
presented signs disease, confirming earlier suggestions chronic
infections parasites substantially problematic otherwise
healthy little penguins. searched also kinetoplastids, despite
targeted sampling little penguins near location trypanosoma
eudyptulae originally reported, parasite detected.
