background: timing origin human malarias focus great
interest. previous studies mitochondrial genome concluded plasmodium 
in primates, including parasitic humans, radiated relatively recently
during process host switches common. investigations, however, 
assumed constant rate evolution tightly bound (fixed) calibration points
based host fossils host distribution. investigate effect such
assumptions using different molecular dating methods. include parasites from
lemuroidea since distribution provides external validation time
estimates allowing us disregard scenarios cannot explain their
introduction madagascar.
results: reject assumption plasmodium mitochondrial genome, 
unit gene separately, evolves constant rate. analyses show 
lemuroidea parasites monophyletic group shares common ancestor 
all catarrhini malarias except related p. falciparum. however, found 
no evidence group parasites branched hosts early the
evolution primates. applied relaxed clock methods different
calibrations points explore origin primate malarias including those
found african apes. showed previous studies likely underestimated 
origin malarial parasites primates.
conclusions: use fossils host absolute calibration the
assumption strict clock likely underestimate time performing molecular 
dating analyses malarial parasites. indeed, exploring different calibration
points, found time radiation primate parasites may have
taken place eocene, time consistent radiation african
anthropoids. radiation four human parasite lineages part such
events. time frame estimated investigation, together our
phylogenetic analyses, made plausible scenario gorillas humans
acquired malaria pan lineage.
