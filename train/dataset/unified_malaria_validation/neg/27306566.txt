the problem community detection networks develop mathematically
principled approach combines network metadata detect
communities accurately done either alone. crucially, the
method assume metadata correlated communities we
are trying find. instead, method learns whether correlation exists and
correctly uses ignores metadata depending whether contain useful
information. demonstrate method synthetic networks known structure
and real-world networks, large small, drawn social, biological and
technological domains.
