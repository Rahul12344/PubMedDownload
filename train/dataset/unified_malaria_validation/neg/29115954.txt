background: democratic republic congo (drc) characterized a
holoendemic malaria area main vectors anopheles funestus and
members anopheles gambiae complex. due political instability and
socio-economic challenges region, knowledge insecticide resistance
status resistance mechanisms vectors limited. mosquitoes were
collected mining site north-eastern part country and,
following identification, subjected extensive testing target-site
and biochemical basis resistance. quantitative real-time pcr used to
assess suite 10 genes frequently involved pyrethroid and
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (ddt) resistance an. gambiae females and
males. an. funestus, gene expression microarray analysis carried on
female mosquitoes.
results: species, deltamethrin resistance recorded along high
resistance suspected resistance ddt an. gambiae an. funestus,
respectively. total 85% an. gambiae carried kdr mutations either
homozygous resistant (rr) (l1014s, l1014f both) heterozygous (rs), however 
only 3% carried rdl mutant allele (rs) ace-1 mutations recorded. 
synergist assays indicated strong role p450s deltamethrin resistance 
both species. an. gambiae, analysis transcription levels showed the
glutathione-s-transferase, gsts1-2, produced highest fold change in
expression (7.6-fold females 31-fold males) followed gste2,
thioredoxin peroxidase (tpx2), cytochrome oxidases (cyp6m2 cyp6p1). all
other genes tested produced fold change values 2. microarray analysis
revealed significant over-transcription cuticular proteins well cyp6m7, 
cyp6p9a cyp6p9b insecticide resistant an. funestus.
conclusions: data show high levels deltamethrin resistance the
main malaria vector species, conferred enzymatic detoxification, present
in drc.
