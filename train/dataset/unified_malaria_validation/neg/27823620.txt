background: chloroquine, lysosomal inhibitor, used malaria, rheumatoid
arthritis, lupus erythematosus therapy. previous study, fip-gts, an
immunomodulatory protein ganoderma tsugae, inhibited cell viability lung 
cancer cells urothelial cancer cells. urothelial carcinoma common
type bladder cancer. cisplatin resistance important issue urothelial 
carcinoma therapy.
purpose: aim study investigate effect combination
treatment fip-gts chloroquine cytotoxicity resensitize the
cisplatin-resistant cells.
methods: fip-gts chloroquine cytotoxicity determined evaluating cck-8
assay. cell death pathways, ros cell cycle arrested analysed through
flow cytometry western blot. shrna targeting autophagy-related genes 
tested evaluate autophagic cell death resistant urothelial cells.
results: using cck-8 assay, chloroquine increased fip-gts-induced cytotoxicity in
parental cisplatin-resistant urothelial cancer cell lines. flow cytometry,
chloroquine enhanced fip-gts-mediated sub-g1 accumulation, annexin v positive
signal mitochondrial membrane potential loss. caspase-3/parp cascade and
z-vad-fmk performed prove fip-gts chloroquine induced
caspase-independent cell death. using h2dcfda staining flow cytometry,
fip-gts chloroquine induce ros production. n-acetyl cysteine, ros
scavenger, inhibited cytotoxicity lc3-ii accumulation fip-gts and
chloroquine-treated n/p cells. elucidate role autophagy in
caspase-independent cell death fip-gts chloroquine, lc3 shrna used to
inhibit autophagy n/p cells. capabilities fip-gts chloroquine to
induce cytotoxicity sub-g1 phase accumulation abolished in
autophagy-defective cells. first study reveal novel function
of fip-gts triggering caspase-independent cell death cisplatin-resistant
urothelial cancer cells.
conclusion: chloroquine enhanced fip-gts-induced autophagy dependent
caspase-independent cell death via abundant autophagosome accumulation.
combination treatment fip-gts chloroquine may provide new strategy for
urothelial cancer therapy.
