defining mechanisms plasmodium virulence regulated central to
understanding pathogenesis human malaria. serial blood passage of
plasmodium rodents, primates humans increases parasite virulence,
suggesting vector transmission regulates plasmodium virulence within the
mammalian host. agreement, disease severity modified vector
transmission, assumed 'reset' plasmodium original character.
however, direct evidence vector transmission regulates plasmodium virulence 
is lacking. use mosquito transmission serially blood passaged (sbp)
plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi interrogate regulation parasite virulence.
analysis sbp p. c. chabaudi mosquito transmission
demonstrates vector transmission intrinsically modifies asexual
blood-stage parasite, turn modifies elicited mammalian immune
response, turn attenuates parasite growth associated pathology.
attenuated parasite virulence associates modified expression pir
multi-gene family. vector transmission plasmodium therefore regulates gene
expression probable variant antigens erythrocytic cycle, modifies the
elicited mammalian immune response, thus regulates parasite virulence. 
results place mosquito centre efforts dissect mechanisms
