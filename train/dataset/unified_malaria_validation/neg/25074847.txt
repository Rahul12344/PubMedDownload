artesunate semi-synthetic derivative artemisinin used treat malaria,
and shown possess anti-inflammatory activity. study, 
investigated effect artesunate pge2 production/cox-2 protein expression
in lps+ifnγ-activated bv2 microglia. understand mechanism of
action compound, investigated interference nf-κb p38 mapk
signalling pathways. pge2 production determined using eia, protein
expressions inflammatory targets like cox-2, mpges-1, iκb, p38 mapkapk2
were evaluated using western blot. nf-κb-bearing luciferase reporter gene
assay used test effect artesunate nf-κb-mediated
pro-inflammatory gene expression hek293 cells stimulated tnfα (1ng/ml).
artesunate (2 4μm), significantly (p <0.01) suppressed pge2 production in
lps+ifnγ-activated bv2 microglia. effect found mediated via
reduction cox-2 mpges-1 proteins. artesunate also produced significant
inhibition tnfα il-6 production activated bv2 microglia. further
investigations showed artesunate (0.5-4μm) significantly (p <0.001) reduced 
nf-κb-driven luciferase expression, inhibited iκb phosphorylation and
degradation, inhibition ikk. artesunate inhibited phosphorylation of
p38 mapk substrate mapkapk2 following stimulation microglia with
lps+ifnγ. taken together, shown artesunate prevents
neuroinflammation bv2 microglia interfering nf-κb p38 mapk
signalling.
