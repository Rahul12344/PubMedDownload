the malaria-protective β-globin polymorphisms, sickle-cell (β(s)) and
β(0)-thalassaemia, canonical examples human adaptation infectious
disease. occurring distinct genetic backgrounds, vary markedly their
patterns linked genetic variation population level, suggesting
different evolutionary histories. β(s) associated five classical
restriction fragment length polymorphism haplotypes exhibit remarkable
specificity geographical distributions; contrast, β(0)-thalassaemia
mutations found haplotypes whose distributions overlap considerably. here,
we explore two polymorphisms display contrasting spatial haplotypic
distributions, despite malaria common selective pressure. present 
a meta-population genetic model, incorporating individual-based processes, 
tracks evolution β-globin polymorphisms different haplotypic
backgrounds. simulations reveal that, depending rate mutation, a
large population size and/or high population growth rate required both
the β(s)- β(0)-thalassaemia-like patterns. however, whilst β(s)-like 
pattern likely population subdivision high, migration low and
long-distance migration absent, opposite true β(0)-thalassaemia.
including gene conversion little effect overall probability each
pattern; however, inter-haplotype fitness variation exists, gene conversion 
is likely contributed diversity haplotypes actually

haplotype patterns exhibited β(s) β(0)-thalassaemia may provide important 
indications evolution adaptive alleles demographic
