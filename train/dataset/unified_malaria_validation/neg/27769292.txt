background: previous genome-wide analyses single nucleotide variation in
plasmodium falciparum identified evidence extended haplotype region on
chromosome 6 west africa, suggesting recent positive selection. pattern
is seen samples east africa south east asia, could be
marking selective process specific west africa. analyses haplotype
structure samples taken different times could give clues possible causes
of selection.
methods: study investigates chromosome 6 extended haplotypes gambia
by analysing alleles multiple microsatellite loci using genome sequence data
previously obtained clinical isolates collected 2008, followed by
genotyping 13 loci 439 isolates 1984, 1991, 2008 2014. temporal
changes haplotype structure frequencies determined.
results: region high linkage disequilibrium spanning 170Â kilobases (kb)
was identified ngs laboratory determined microsatellite alleles.
multiple long haplotypes found temporal populations gambia. 
two haplotypes detected samples 1984 1991. frequency 
of long-range haplotypes increased 2008 2014 populations. higher
fst older recent populations loci proximity genes
involved drug metabolism pathways.
conclusions: occurrence several long haplotypes intermediate
frequencies suggests unusual mode selection chromosome 6, possibly
combined recombination suppression specific haplotypes. selection
apparently occurred emergence known anti-malarial drug resistance
alleles, could due effects drugs unknown processes that
have long operating endemic region.
