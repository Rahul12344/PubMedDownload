infections dogs virulent strains babesia canis characterized by
rapid onset high mortality, comparable complicated human malaria. in
other apicomplexan parasites, babesia virulence factors responsible for
survival pathogenicity secreted host cell surface beyond where

evidence conserved factors apicomplexan hemoparasites involved in
immune-evasion (e.g. vesa-protein family), proteins secreted across irbc
membrane host bloodstream (e.g. sa- bc28 protein families),
potential moonlighting proteins (e.g. profilin histones), uncharacterized
antigens present acute crisis dogs. combined data provides first 
predicted partially validated set potential virulence factors exported
during fatal infections, exploited urgently needed innovative
intervention strategies aimed facilitating diagnosis management canine
