background: anti-malarial drug resistance emerged one biggest
challenges confronting worldwide effort control malaria. appearance of
chloroquine multi-drug resistance devastating effects therapeutic
efficacy former first-line agents. artemisinin proven excellent
therapeutic alternative fill void chemotherapeutic options left by
resistance mechanisms. time introduction, resistance artemisinins
had recorded, artemisinins demonstrated excellent parasite reduction
rates. attempt protect artemisinin efficacy, world health
organization (who) made artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) official 
first-line treatment recommendation uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum in
2006. brazil, artemether/lumefantrine became brazilian malaria control
programme's official treatment recommendation 2007. sarco/endoplasmic
reticulum ca2+ - atpase ortholog p. falciparum (pfatp6) suggested 
one targets artemisinins. consequently, pfatp6 gene polymorphisms are
being investigated markers artemisinin resistance elsewhere. goal of
this work describe molecular profile pfatp6 p. falciparum
isolates different localities amazonas state.
methods: dna polymorphisms pfatp6 gene 80 p. falciparum isolates from
11 municipalities amazonas state (western brazilian amazon), and
after introduction act brazilian anti-malarial guidelines, were
analysed automatic sequencing. mutations pfatp6 gene searched
using mutation surveyor v3.25 software.
results: p. falciparum pfatp6 gene presented polymorphisms codons 37, 630 
and 898. r37k mutation found 16% samples, a630s 32% and
i898i 52%. s769n mutation, however, detected analysed samples.
conclusion: despite small number samples, data presented provide
baseline information polymorphisms pfatp6 gene exposure
to act low transmission area, help infer drug selection
pressure area future.
