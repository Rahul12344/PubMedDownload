type interferons (t1ifns) among earliest cytokines produced during
infections due direct regulation innate immune signaling pathways.
reports suggested t1ifns produced malaria infection, but
little known vivo cellular origins t1ifns role in
protection. found addition plasmacytoid dendritic cells,
splenic red pulp macrophages (rpms) generate significant quantities t1ifns
in response p. chabaudi infection tlr9-, myd88-, irf7-dependent
manner. furthermore, t1ifns regulate expression interferon-stimulated genes
redundantly interferon-gamma (ifng), resulting redundancy resistance 
to experimental malaria infection. despite role sensing promoting
immune responses infection, observe rpms dispensable control
of parasitemia. results reveal rpms early sentinels malaria
infection, effector mechanisms previously attributed rpms not
essential control.
