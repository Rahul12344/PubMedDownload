background: mosquitoes primary vectors responsible malaria
transmission humans, numerous experiments conducted aid in
the control malaria transmission. one main approaches aims develop
malaria parasite resistance within mosquito population introducing a
resistance (r) allele. however, considering approach, critical
factors, life mosquito, female mosquito fertility capacity,
and human mosquito mobility, considered. thus, understanding
of mosquitoes humans affect disease dynamics needed better inform
malaria control policymaking. methods: study, method proposed to
create metanetwork basis geographic maps gambia, model
was constructed simulate evolution within mixed population, factors
such birth, death, reproduction, biting, infection, incubation, recovery, 
transmission populations considered network metrics. first, the
same number refractory mosquitoes (rr genotype) introduced each
population, prevalence r allele (the ratio resistant alleles to
all alleles) malaria examined. addition, series simulations were
performed evaluate two different deployment strategies reduction of
the prevalence malaria. r allele malaria prevalence calculated
for strategies, 10,000 refractory mosquitoes deployed randomly
selected populations selection based nodes top-betweenness values. the
10,000 mosquitoes deployed among 1, 5, 10, 20, 40 populations. results:
the simulations paper showed higher rr genotype
(resistant-resistant genes) ratio leads higher r allele prevalence and
lowers malaria prevalence. considering cost deployment, simulation was
performed 10,000 refractory mosquitoes deployed among 1 5 populations,
but approach reduce original malaria prevalence. thus, instead, 
the 10,000 refractory mosquitoes distributed among 10, 20, 40 populations
and shown effectively reduce original malaria prevalence. thus,
deployment among relatively small fraction central nodes offer an
effective strategy reduce malaria. conclusion: standard network centrality
measure suitable planning deployment refractory mosquitoes.
importance: malaria infectious disease caused plasmodial
parasite, control strategies focused genetically modifying the
mosquitoes. work aims create model takes account mosquito
development malaria transmission among population factors
influence disease dynamics better inform malaria-control policymaking.
