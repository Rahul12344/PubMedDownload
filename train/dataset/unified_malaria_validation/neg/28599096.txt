malaria devastating parasitic disease affecting half world's
population. rapid emergence resistance new antimalarial drugs,
including artemisinin-based therapies, made development drugs with
novel mechanisms action extremely urgent. proteases enzymes proven be
well suited target-based drug development due knowledge their
enzymatic mechanisms active site structures. importantly, plasmodium
proteases shown involved variety pathways are
essential parasite survival. however, pharmacological rather than
target-based approaches dominated field antimalarial drug
development, part due challenge robustly validating plasmodium
targets genetic level. fortunately, last years been
significant progress development efficient genetic methods modify
the parasite, including several conditional approaches. progress finally 
allowing us validate essential genes genetically, also study
their molecular functions. review, present current understanding of
the biological role proteases play malaria parasite life cycle. also
discuss recent advances plasmodium genetics, improvement of
protease-oriented chemical biology approaches, development of
malaria-focused pharmacological assays, combined achieve robust
biological, chemical therapeutic validation plasmodium proteases viable
drug targets.
