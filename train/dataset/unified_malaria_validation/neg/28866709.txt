background artemether, originally used malaria, exhibits potential
therapeutic efficacy several types cancer, including gastric cancer,
hepatocellular carcinoma, gliomas. study, investigated role
and mechanism artemether drug resistance neuroblastoma cells. material
and methods cell viability proliferation determined cck-8 edu
incorporation assay, respectively. gene expression measured real-time pcr 
and western blot analysis. results results revealed artemether treatment
remarkably inhibited proliferation neuroblastoma cell lines sh-sy5y,
sk-n-sh, sk-n-be2. addition, co-treatment tumor cells artemether
and doxorubicin significantly reduced cell viability dna synthesis compared
with doxorubicin-treated cells. molecular level, found combined
treatment artemether doxorubicin suppressed expression b7-h3 both
at mrna protein levels. addition, artemether failed sensitize tumor
cells doxorubicin sh-sy5y cells overexpressing b7-h3. conclusions
artemether-mediated inhibition b7-h3 may contribute doxorubicin sensitivity
in neuroblastoma cells, suggesting artemether could serve potential
therapeutic option neuroblastoma.
