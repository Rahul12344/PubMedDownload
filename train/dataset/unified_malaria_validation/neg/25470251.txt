background: red blood cell (rbc) polymorphisms common malaria endemic
regions known protect severe forms disease. therefore, 
it important screen polymorphisms drugs vaccines efficacy
trials. study undertaken evaluate associations clinical
malaria rbc polymorphisms assess biological interactions may be
necessary consideration designing clinical trials.
method: cross-sectional study 341 febrile children less five years
of age, associations clinical malaria common rbc polymorphisms
including sickle cell gene g6pd deficiency evaluated november
2008 june 2009 middle belt ghana, kintampo. g6pd deficiency was
determined quantitative methods whiles haemoglobin variants determined by
haemoglobin titan gel electrophoresis. blood smears stained giemsa 
parasite densities determined microscopically.
results: prevalence clinical malarial among enrolled children was
31.9%. frequency g6pd deficiency 19.0% haemoglobin
variants 74.7%, 14.7%, 9.1%, 0.9% respectively hbaa, hbac, hbas and
hbss. multivariate regression analysis, children hbas genotype had
79% lower risk malaria infection compared hbaa genotypes
(or = 0.21, 95% ci: 0.06-0.73, p = 0.01). hbac genotype significantly
associated malaria infection relative hbaa genotype (or = 0.70, 95%
ci: 0.35-1.42, p = 0.33). g6pd deficient subgroup marginally increased risk
of malaria infection compared g6pd normal subgroup (or = 1.76, 95% ci:
0.98-3.16, p = 0.06).
conclusion: results confirm previous findings showing protective effect
of sickle cell trait clinical malaria infection. however, g6pd deficiency 
associated marginal increase susceptibility clinical malaria
compared children without g6pd deficiency.
