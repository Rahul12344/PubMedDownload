many vector-borne pathogens rely antigenic variation prolong infections and
increase likelihood onward transmission. immune evasion strategy
often involves mutually exclusive switching members gene families that
encode functionally similar antigenically different variants the
course single infection. studies different pathogens suggested 
switching variant genes non-random genes intrinsic
probabilities activated silenced. factors could create a
hierarchy gene expression important implications infection
dynamics acquisition protective immunity. inferring complete switching
networks gene transcription data problematic, however, the
high dimensionality system uncertainty data. present 
statistically rigorous method analysing temporal gene transcription data to
reconstruct underlying switching network. using artificially generated
transcription profiles together vitro var gene transcript data two
plasmodium falciparum laboratory strains, show instead relying data
from long-term parasite cultures, accuracy greatly improved using
transcription time courses several parasite populations isolate,
each starting different variant distributions. method provides
explicit indications reliability resulting networks thus
be used test competing hypotheses regards underlying switching
pathways. results demonstrate antigenic switch pathways be
determined reliably short gene transcription profiles assessing multiple
time points, even subject moderate levels experimental error. this
should yield important new information switching patterns antigenically 
variable organisms might help shed light molecular basis of
antigenic variation.
