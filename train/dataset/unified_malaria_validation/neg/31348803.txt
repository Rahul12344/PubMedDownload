the essential distinct functions protein phosphatase type 1 (pp1)
catalytic subunit eukaryotes exclusively achieved interaction 
with myriad regulatory partners. work, report molecular and
functional characterization gametocyte exported protein 15 (gexp15), a
plasmodium specific protein, regulator pp1. vitro interaction studies 
demonstrated gexp15 physically interacts pp1 rvxf binding
motif p. berghei. functional assays showed gexp15 able increase
pp1 activity mutation rvxf motif completely abolished this
regulation. immunoprecipitation assays tagged gexp15 pp1 p. berghei
followed immunoblot mass spectrometry analyses confirmed interaction 
and showed present schizont gametocyte stages shared
protein complexes involved spliceosome proteasome pathways known
to play essential role parasite development. phenotypic analysis viable
gexp15 deficient p. berghei blood parasites showed unable to
develop lethal infection balb/c mice establish experimental cerebral
malaria c57bl/6 mice. further, although deficient parasites produced
gametocytes produce oocysts/sporozoites indicating high
fitness cost mosquito. global proteomic phosphoproteomic analyses of
gexp15 deficient schizonts revealed profound defect significant decrease
in abundance impact phosphorylation status proteins involved 
regulation gene expression invasion. moreover, depletion gexp15 seemed
to impact mainly abundance specific proteins female gametocytes.
our study provides first insight contribution pp1 regulator 
plasmodium virulence suggests gexp15 affects asexual sexual
life cycle.
