the age mosquitoes crucial determinant ability transmit
pathogens resistance insecticides. investigated changes the
abundance proteins found heads thoraces malaria mosquitoes
anopheles gambiae anopheles stephensi aged. protein expression
changes assessed using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and
the identity differentially expressed proteins determined using either 
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization tandem time-of-flight mass
spectrometry capillary high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled a
linear ion-trap (ltq)-orbitrap xl hybrid mass spectrometer. protein biomarkers
were validated semi quantitative western blot analysis. nineteen nine age 
dependent protein spots identified a. stephensi a. gambiae,
respectively. among proteins down-regulated age homologs of
adf/cofilin, cytochome c1, heat shock protein-70 eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 5a (eif5a). proteins up-regulated age included probable
methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, voltage-dependent anion-selective
channel fructose bisphosphate aldolase. semi quantitative western blot
analysis confirmed expression patterns observed 2-d dige eif5a and
adf/cofilin. work recommended determine whether biomarkers
are robust infection, blood feeding insecticide resistance. robust
biomarkers could incorporated rapid diagnostic assays ecological
and epidemiological studies.biological significance: study, have
identified several proteins characteristic changes abundance a.
gambiae a. stephensi aging process. changes may highlight 
underlying mechanisms beneath relationship mosquito age factors
affecting plasmodium transmission mosquito control. similarity changes
in protein abundance species primary dengue vector aedes
aegypti, revealed conserved patterns aging-specific protein regulation.
