carbon dioxide used traps six decades monitor
mosquito populations help make informed vector management decisions. co2 is
sensed gustatory receptors (grs) housed neurons maxillary palps.
co2-sensitive grs identified vinegar fly mosquitoes, but
it remains resolved whether receptors respond co2 bicarbonate. 
as opposed vinegar fly, mosquitoes three gr subunits, is
assumed subunits gr1 gr3 form functional receptors. attempt to
identify chemical species bind receptors, discovered gr2
and gr3 essential receptor function gr1 appears function a
modulator. xenopus oocytes coexpressing culex quinquefasciatus subunits
cquigr1/3 cquigr1/2 activated, cquigr2/3 gave robust responses to
sodium bicarbonate. interestingly, cquigr1/2/3-coexpressing oocytes gave
significantly lower responses. ternary combination markedly less
sensitive gr2/gr3 combination also observed orthologs 
yellow fever malaria mosquito. comparing responses of
cquigr2/cquigr3-coexpressing oocytes sodium bicarbonate samples (with or
without acidification) measuring concentration aqueous co2, showed 
that direct correlation dissolved co2 receptor response.
we concluded subunits gr2 gr3 essential carbon
dioxide-sensitive receptors activated co2 per se, not
bicarbonate.
