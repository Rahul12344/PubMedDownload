ecologically distinct regions country. total 219 p. vivax isolates
(16-30 per population) successfully haplotyped using 10 microsatellite
markers. wide range genetic diversity (he=0.37-0.87, rs=3.60-7.58) and
significant multilocus linkage disequilibrium (ld) observed six the

transmission intensities across country. genetic differentiation between
regions evident (jost's d=0.07-0.72), increasing divergence of
populations geographic distance. overall, p. vivax isolates clustered into
three major genetic populations subdividing mainland lowland coastal
regions, islands highlands. p. vivax gene flow follows major human
migration routes, higher gene flow amongst mainland parasite
