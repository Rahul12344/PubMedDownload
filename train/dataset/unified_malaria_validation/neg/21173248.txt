the african malaria mosquito anopheles gambiae diversifying ecotypes
known forms. process thought promoted adaptation to
different larval habitats, genetic underpinnings remain elusive. to
identify candidate targets divergent natural selection s, we
performed genomewide scanning paired population samples mali, followed by
resequencing genotyping five locations west, central, east
africa. genome scans revealed significant peak m-s divergence chromosome 
3l, overlapping five known suspected immune response genes. resequencing
implicated selective target near tep1 gene, whose complement c3-like 
product antiparasitic antibacterial activity. sequencing and
allele-specific genotyping showed allelic variant tep1 swept 
to fixation samples mali burkina faso spreading into
neighboring ghana, absent sampled cameroon, sampled
s populations. sequence comparison demonstrates allele related to,
but distinct from, tep1 alleles known resistance phenotype. experimental
parasite infections advanced mosquito intercrosses demonstrated strong
association tep1 variant resistance rodent malaria and
the native human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum. although malaria
parasites may direct agents pathogen-mediated selection tep1 in
nature--where larvae may vulnerable life stage--the process of
adaptive divergence potential consequences malaria
