mutations, strength selection upon mutant genotypes quantified.
five mutations dihydrofolate reductase dihydropteroate synthase genes 
began moderate frequencies achieved fixation 2005; frequency the
highly-sp-resistant "quintuple mutant" haplotype increased 19% 100%. 
selective advantage alleles haplotypes quantified selection

associated sp resistance, relative fitness quintuple mutant
haplotype 0.139 (95% c.i. 0.067-0.211), indicating substantial positive
selective advantage. mutations confer higher levels resistance sp 
not emerge. sp-resistant haplotypes rapidly selected fixed p.
