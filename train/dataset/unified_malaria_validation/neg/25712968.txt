background: immunity antigenically diverse parasite plasmodium falciparum 
is acquired gradually repeated exposure. studies areas high malaria
transmission shown asymptomatic individuals infected multiclonal
infections reduced risk febrile malaria follow-up.
methods: assessed relationship genetic diversity clones 
p. falciparum infections persist dry season subsequent
risk febrile malaria 225 individuals aged 2-25 years mali, the
6-month malaria dry seasons sharply demarcated. polymerase chain
reaction-based genotyping highly polymorphic merozoite surface protein 2
gene performed blood samples collected 5 cross-sectional surveys.
results: age-adjusted analysis, individuals multiclonal p. falciparum 
infections rainy season reduced risk febrile malaria,
compared individuals uninfected (hazard ratio [hr], 0.28; 95%
confidence interval [ci], .11-.69). contrast, significant
association risk malaria 1 clone baseline (hr, 0.71; 95%
ci, .36-1.40).
conclusions: results suggest persistent multiclonal infections carried
through dry season contribute protection subsequent febrile
malaria, possibly maintaining protective immune responses depend on
ongoing parasite infection.
