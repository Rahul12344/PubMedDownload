this study analyzed relationship intermittent preventive treatment
with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) (iptp-sp), rate multiple resistant
parasites submicroscopic gametocyte carriage among pregnant women the
beginning iptp implementation gabon (2005) six years (2011). 
detection pfdhfr pfdhps gene mutations performed pcr-rflp in
plasmodium (p.) falciparum positive samples collected pregnant women 2005
and 2011. gametocytes carriage detected pfs25mrna amplification using
qt-nasba. data analyzed according time collection (study period)
and iptp-sp doses. proportion isolates least triple pfdhfr
mutation (n = 39/42, 92.9% versus 100%, n = 78/78)) isolates with
the s108n/c59r/n51i/s436a/a437g multiple mutation (17.9% versus 75.6%)
significantly increased 2005 2011 (p<0.01). mutations i164l a581g
were found, higher proportions 436 437 mutations detected
in 2011.a trend toward higher frequency isolates five mutations was
observed women received two sp doses (p<0.01). pfs25mrna found 6.8 
% (n = 3/44) 34.6% (n = 27/78) samples collected 2005 2011
respectively (p<0.01). 2011, 74.0% (n = 20/27) women detected
submicroscopic gametocytes carried parasites s108n/c59r/n51/s436a/a437g 
multiple mutation. ten delivering women received three iptp-sp doses 
had submicroscopic plasmodium falciparum infection, none detected
gametocytes. following iptp-sp implementation, increase frequency of
multiple mutant parasites submicroscopic gametocyte carriage observed 
among pregnant women living gabon.
