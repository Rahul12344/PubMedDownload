objectives: drug resistance confers fitness advantage parasites exposed to
frequent drug pressure, yet mutations also may incur fitness cost. we
assessed fitness advantages costs artemisinin resistance plasmodium
falciparum vitro understand drug resistance spread evolve a
competitive environment.
methods: genotyping snps, drug susceptibility assays copy number
determination used assess impact artemisinin resistance on
parasite fitness. artemisinin-resistant clone (c9) selected vitro an
isogenic parental clone (d6) used conduct competitive growth studies to
assess fitness artemisinin resistance. resistant susceptible clones
were mixed grown alone presence absence drug pressure
(dihydroartemisinin pyrimethamine) quantify rate artemisinin
resistance gained lost.
results: experimentally demonstrate first time artemisinin
resistance provides fitness advantage selected infrequent
exposure drug, lost absence exposure artemisinin drugs.
the best correlations artemisinin resistance decreased vitro drug
susceptibility artemisinin derivatives, increased copy number pf3d7_1030100
and snp pf3d7_0307600. snp conferring e208k mutation kelch
gene (pf3d7_1343700) associated resistance. furthermore, observed
second-cycle ring-stage dormancy induced pyrimethamine, suggesting that
dormancy fitness trait provides advantage survival from
antimalarial drug stress.
conclusions: artemisinin-resistant p. falciparum fitness advantage to
survive predominate population even face infrequent exposure
to artemisinin drugs.
