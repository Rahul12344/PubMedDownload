casein kinase 1 (ck1) pleiotropic protein kinase implicated several
fundamental processes eukaryotic cell biology. plasmodium falciparum encodes a
single ck1 isoform, pfck1, expressed stages parasite's life
cycle. previously shown pfck1 gene cannot disrupted, that
the locus modified loss-of-function incurred, suggesting an
important role kinase intra-erythrocytic asexual proliferation. here,
we report use parasite lines expressing gfp- his-tagged pfck1 from
the endogenous locus investigate (i) dynamics pfck1 localisation during
the asexual cycle red blood cells, (ii) potential interactors pfck1, so
as gain insight involvement enzyme specific cellular
processes. immunofluorescence analysis reveals dynamic localisation pfck1,
with evidence pool enzyme directed membrane host
erythrocyte early stages infection, followed predominantly
intra-parasite localisation trophozoites schizonts association with
micronemes merozoites. furthermore, present strong evidence pool 
enzymatically active pfck1 secreted culture supernatant,
demonstrating pfck1 ectokinase. interactome experiments and
ensuing kinase assays using recombinant pfck1 phosphorylate putative
interactors vitro suggest involvement pfck1 many cellular processes
such mrna splicing, protein trafficking, ribosomal, host cell invasion.
