background: eukaryotic organisms, gene expression regulated multiple
levels processes transcription translation. absence a
tight regulatory network transcription human malaria parasite suggests
that gene expression may largely controlled post-transcriptional and
translational levels.
results: study, compare steady-state mrna polysome-associated mrna
levels plasmodium falciparum different time points asexual cell 
cycle. 30% genes, observe delay peak transcript
abundance polysomal fraction compared steady-state mrna
fraction, suggestive strong translational control. data show key
regulatory mechanisms could include inhibitory activity upstream open reading 
frames translational repression major virulence gene family by
intronic transcripts. addition, observe polysomal mrna-specific alternative
splicing events widespread transcription non-coding transcripts.
conclusions: different layers translational regulation likely to
contribute complex network controls gene expression eukaryotic 
pathogen. disrupting mechanisms involved translational control could 
provide novel anti-malarial strategies.
