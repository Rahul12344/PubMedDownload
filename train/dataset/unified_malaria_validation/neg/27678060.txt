aminopeptidases emerged new promising drug targets development of
novel anti-parasitic drugs. aspartyl aminopeptidase-like gene been
identified toxoplasma gondii genome (tgaap), although function remains
unknown. study, characterized tgaap performed functional analysis 
of gene product. firstly, expressed functional recombinant tgaap
(rtgaap) protein escherichia coli, found required metal ions for
activity showed substrate preference n-terminal acidic amino acids glu 
and asp. then, evaluated function drug target potential tgaap using
the crispr/cas9 knockout system. western blotting demonstrated deletion of
tgaap knockout strain. indirect immunofluorescence analysis showed that
tgaap localized cytoplasm wild-type parasite, not
expressed knockout strain. phenotype analysis revealed tgaap knockout
inhibited attachment/invasion, replication, substrate-specific activity
in t. gondii. finally, activity drug cid 23724194, previously described as
targeting plasmodium malarial parasite aap, tested rtgaap the
parasite. overall, tgaap knockout affected growth t. gondii not
completely abolish parasite replication growth. therefore, tgaap may comprise
a useful adjunct drug target t. gondii.
