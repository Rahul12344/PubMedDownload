background: burden malaria infection modern world remains
significant. specific changes relative proportions malaria vector
mosquitoes, maculipennis complex species, south western siberia over
the past 25 years 20th century attracted wide attention an
indicator dynamic geographical distribution. eurasia, studies of
fluctuations borders areas occupied sibling species complex,
as well relative proportions areas sympatric are
epidemiologically important.
methods: species identity chromosomal polymorphisms within population
were defined cytogenetic analysis polytene chromosomes third- and
fourth-instar larvae adult females anopheles mosquitoes collected the
period 1973 2012. total 37 anopheles samples (3,757 specimens) 
the ukraine, european russia urals studied. identify an. messeae 
s.l. cryptic species b, polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment 
length polymorphisms second internal transcribed spacer rrna genes
sequences (its2 pcr-rflp) used.
results: an. maculipennis s.s. expanding northeast speed of
approximately 30 km per year. 2008 2009, species appeared the
southern urals. emergence an. maculipennis region accompanied 
by decrease proportions an. messeae an. beklemishevi 
increase proportion an. messeae b within an. messeae s.l. highly 
likely southwestern border an. beklemishevi distribution area could
shift direction expanding area an. maculipennis.
conclusions: geographical distribution palaearctic mosquito species of
the maculipennis complex undergoing gradual shift. changes detected the
species distribution considered component biocenotic process
triggered global warming. warming consequent expansion 
an. maculipennis s.s. northeast, followed changes species
composition anopheles well relative proportions fluctuations
in species areas, exacerbate epidemiology malaria infection in
eurasia.
