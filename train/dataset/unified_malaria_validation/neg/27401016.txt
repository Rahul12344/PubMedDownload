background: mali, plasmodium falciparum malaria highly endemic remains 
stable despite implementation various malaria control measures.
understanding p. falciparum population structure variations across country
could provide new insights guide malaria control programmes. study, p.
falciparum genetic diversity population structure regions varying
patterns malaria transmission mali analysed.
methods: total 648 blood isolates adsorbed onto filter papers during
population surveillance surveys (december 2012-march 2013, october 2013) four 
distinct sites mali screened presence p. falciparum via
quantitative pcr (qpcr). multiple loci variable number tandem repeats analysis
(mlva) using eight microsatellite markers performed positive qpcr
samples. complete genotypes analysed genetic diversity, genetic
differentiation linkage disequilibrium.
results: 156 qpcr-positive samples, complete genotyping 112 samples was
achieved. parasite populations displayed high genetic diversity (mean
he = 0.77), consistent high level malaria transmission in
mali. genetic differentiation low (fst < 0.02), even sites located
approximately 900 km apart, thereby illustrating marked gene flux amongst
parasite populations. lack linkage disequilibrium revealed an
absence local clonal expansion, corroborated genotype
relationship results. contrast stable genetic diversity level observed 
throughout country, mean multiplicity infection increased north to
south (from 1.4 2.06) paralleled malaria transmission levels observed
locally.
conclusions: mali, high level genetic diversity pronounced gene
flux amongst p. falciparum populations may represent obstacle control
malaria. indeed, results suggest parasite populations polymorphic enough
to adapt host counteract interventions, anti-malarial
vaccination. additionally, panmictic parasite population structure imply that
resistance traits may disseminate freely one area another, making control
measures performed local level ineffective.
