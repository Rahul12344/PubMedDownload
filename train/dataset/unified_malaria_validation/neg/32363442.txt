adaptors reside multiple complexes involved maintenance chromatin
structure. rbap48 essential subunit chromatin assembly factor-1
(caf-1) complex, therefore also named caf-1c. detailed silico sequence
and structure analysis homologs rbap46/48 plasmodium falciparum
(pf3d7_0110700 pf3d7_1433300) exhibited conservation characteristic
features protein-seven-bladed wd40 Î²-propeller conformation and
different binding interfaces. comparative structural analysis highlighted
species-specific features parasite, yeast, drosophila, human
rbap46/48. present study, report cloning, expression, and
characterization p. falciparum pf3d7_0110700, putative rbap46/48

6xhistidine tag over-expressed escherichia coli b834 cells. protein
was purified ni-nta followed gel permeation chromatography. protein
expressed three asexual blood stages exhibited nuclear
localization. showed direct interaction purified rpfrbap46/48
