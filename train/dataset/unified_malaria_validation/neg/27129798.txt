objectives: purpose study determine normal range of
chitotriosidase activity cypriot population frequency 24bp 
duplication polymorphism. furthermore, compared allele frequency this
polymorphism two locations different malaria endemicity past.
design methods: plasma chitotriosidase activity measured using a
fluorogenic substrate. 24bp polymorphism detected using pcr analysis of
exon 10 chit1 gene. additional mutations detected using direct
sequencing.
results: normal range chitotriosidase activity found be
9.5-44.0nmol/ml/hr. among 114 normal individuals genotyped 24bp
duplication, 7% found homozygous, 36% heterozygous 57% wild type
(allele frequency 0.25). allele frequency polymorphism individuals
originating two locations different malaria endemicity past 
not significantly different. novel deletion mutation chit1 gene was
identified associated loss chitotriosidase activity. new deletion
eliminates 29 nucleotides exon 9 resulting generation premature 
stop codon, probably leading production aberrant protein molecule.
conclusions: normal range chitotriosidase activity allele
frequency 24bp duplication polymorphism cypriot population were
found similar mediterranean populations. evidence 
an association presence 24bp duplication polymorphism and
susceptibility malaria found. novel deletion exon 9 chit1 gene
was identified (allele frequency 0.01).
