background: hematophagous mosquitos ticks avoid host hemostatic system
through expression enzyme inhibitors targeting proteolytic reactions the
coagulation complement cascades. inhibitors characterized date 
were found salivary glands, relatively others identified 
the midgut. among those, boophilin 2-kunitz multifunctional inhibitor
targeting thrombin, elastase, kallikrein. however, kinetics boophilin 
interaction enzymes, modulates platelet function, whether
it inhibits thrombosis vivo determined.
methodology/principal findings: boophilin expressed hek293 cells and
purified homogeneity. using amidolytic assays surface plasmon resonance
experiments, demonstrated boophilin behaves classical,
non-competitive inhibitor thrombin respect small chromogenic
substrates mechanism dependent exosite-1 catalytic site.
inhibition accompanied blockade platelet aggregation, fibrin formation, 
and clot-bound thrombin vitro. notably, also identified boophilin a
non-competitive inhibitor fxia, preventing fix activation. addition,
boophilin inhibits kallikrein activity reciprocal activation, indicating 
that targets contact pathway. furthermore, boophilin abrogates cathepsin
g- plasmin-induced platelet aggregation partially affects
elastase-mediated cleavage tissue factor pathway inhibitor (tfpi). finally,
boophilin inhibits carotid artery occlusion vivo triggered fecl3, and
promotes bleeding according mice tail transection method.
conclusion/significance: inhibition several enzymes involved in
proteolytic cascades cell activation, boophilin plays major role keeping
the midgut microenvironment low hemostatic inflammatory tonus. this
response allows ticks successfully digest blood meal critical for
metabolism egg development. boophilin first tick midgut fxia
anticoagulant also found inhibit thrombosis.
