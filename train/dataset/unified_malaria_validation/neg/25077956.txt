background: single amino acid substitutions voltage-gated sodium channel
associated pyrethroid resistance constitute one main causative
factors knockdown resistance insects. kdr gene observed in
several mosquito species; however, point mutations para gene aedes
aegypti populations myanmar fully characterized. aim 
present study determine types frequencies mutations para
gene aedes aegypti collected used tires yangon city, myanmar.
methodology/principal findings: determined high pyrethroid resistance aedes
aegypti larvae collection sites yangon city, using simplified
knockdown bioassay. showed v1016g s989p mutations widely
distributed, high frequencies (84.4% 78.8%, respectively). contrast, 
we unable detect i1011m (or i1011v) l1014f mutations. f1534c mutations
were also widely distributed, lower frequency v1016g mutation
(21.2%). high percentage co-occurrence homozygous v1016g/s989p
mutations detected (65.7%). additionally, co-occurrence homozygous
v1016g/f1534c mutations (2.9%) homozygous v1016g/f1534c/s989p mutations
(0.98%) detected present study.
conclusions/significance: pyrethroid insecticides first used malaria
control 1992, since constantly used myanmar. intensive
use may explain strong selection pressure toward aedes aegypti, 
mosquito generally domestic endophagic species preference for
indoor breeding. extensive use ddt malaria control use 
chemical banned may also explain development pyrethroid resistance 
aedes aegypti.
