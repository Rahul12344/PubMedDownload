background: drug resistance remains chief concern malaria control. order
to determine genetic markers drug resistant parasites, tested the
genome-wide associations (gwa) sequence-based genotypes 35 kenyan p.
falciparum parasites activities 22 antimalarial drugs.
methods principal findings: parasites isolated children acute
febrile malaria adapted culture, sensitivity determined in
vitro growth presence anti-malarial drugs. parasites genotyped
using whole genome sequencing techniques. associations 6250 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) resistance individual anti-malarial agents
were determined, false discovery rate adjustment multiple hypothesis
testing. identified expected associations pfcrt region chloroquine
(cq) activity, novel loci associated amodiaquine, quinazoline, and
quinine activities. signals cq primaquine (pq) overlap around
pfcrt, interestingly phenotypes inversely related two
drugs. catalog variation dhfr, dhps, mdr1, nhe, crt, including
novel snps, confirm presence dhfr-164l quadruple mutant coastal
kenya. mutations implicated sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance or
near fixation sample set.
conclusions/significance: sequence-based gwa studies powerful tools for
phenotypic association tests. using approach falciparum parasites from
coastal kenya identified known previously unreported genes associated with
phenotypic resistance anti-malarial drugs, observe high-resolution
haplotype visualizations possible signature inverse selective
relationship cq pq.
