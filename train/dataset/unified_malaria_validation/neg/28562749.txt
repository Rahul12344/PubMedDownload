toll-like receptors (tlrs) critical mediators inflammatory response to
malarial infection, gene polymorphisms affecting tlr function may be
partially responsible inter-individual variation disease manifestation.
however, inconsistencies associations common genetic variants
of tlr4 (d299g) tlr9 (t-1237c t-1486c) malaria outcome. a
comprehensive search conducted identify relevant independent
plasmodium falciparum-infected case-control studies, meta-analysis including 
six studies snp performed obtain precise estimates the
pooled effects variants. results showed significant associations 
the -1486c allele risk severe malaria allele contrast (t vs. c, p 
= 0.004, = 1.26) homozygous (tt vs. cc, p = 0.03, = 1.51) genetic
models. association d299g t-1237c variants and
uncomplicated severe malaria using genetic models tested. however, 
in stratified analysis, -1237c associated risk severe malaria 
indian adults (tt vs. tc, p = 0.06, = 2.13; tt vs. tc+cc, p <0.00001, =

of -1486c risk factor warrants investigation functionality in
malaria pathogenesis. further, lack association t-1237c
variant weak, future studies examining detailed individual data from
different ethnic groups essential confirmation genetic
contribution malaria.
