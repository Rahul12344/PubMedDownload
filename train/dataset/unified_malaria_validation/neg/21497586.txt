genetic diversity plasmodium populations extensively documented 
in colombia plasmodium falciparum plasmodium vivax. recently, highly
variable microsatellite markers described used population-level 
studies genetic variation p. vivax throughout world. applied this
approach understand genetic structure p. vivax populations to
identify recurrence-associated haplotypes. this, three microsatellite markers 
of p. vivax amplified combined size fragments used to
establish genotypes. patients ongoing treatment efficacy trial were
kept either endemic non-endemic regions northwest colombia were
included study. total 58 paired clinical isolates, amplified. a
total 54 haplotypes observed among two regions. haplotypes 
exclusive endemic region highest degree polymorphism was
detected. addition, confirmed different genotypes of
recurrent-relapsing primary infection isolates suggesting activation of
heterologous hypnozoite populations. conclude analysis three
microsatellites valuable tool establish genetic characteristics p.
vivax populations colombia.
