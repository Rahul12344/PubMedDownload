strains serratia marcescens, originally isolated gut lumen adult
female anopheles stephensi mosquitoes, established persistent infection high
rates adult a. stephensi whether fed larvae sugar meal adults.
by contrast, congener s. fonticola originating aedes triseriatus had
lower infection a. stephensi, suggesting co-adaptation serratia strains 
different species host mosquitoes. coinfection high infection rate adult
a. stephensi resulted feeding s. marcescens elizabethkingia anophelis
in sugar meal, fed together larvae, infection rates e.
anophelis much higher s. marcescens adult a. stephensi,
suggesting suppression effect coinfection across life stages. primary
isolate s. marcescens resistant tested antibiotics, showed high
survival mosquito gut, produced alpha-hemolysins contributed 
lysis erythrocytes ingested blood meal. genomes two primary
isolates a. stephensi, designated s. marcescens ano1 ano2, were
sequenced compared serratia symbionts associated insects,
nematodes plants. serratia marcescens ano1 ano2 predicted virulence
factors possibly involved attacking parasites and/or causing opportunistic
infection mosquito hosts. s. marcescens ano1 ano2 possessed multiple
mechanisms antagonism microorganisms, including production of
bacteriocins multi-antibiotic resistance determinants. genes
contributing potential anti-malaria activity including serralysins, hemolysins
and chitinases found serratia species. interesting that
genome sequences s. marcescens ano1 ano2 distinctly different from
those serratia sp. ag1 ag2 isolated anopheles gambiae.
compared serratia sp. ag1 ag2, s. marcescens ano1 ano2 rrnas
and many important genes involved commensal anti-parasite traits.
