background: although world health organization recommends replacing quinine
(qn) artesunate due increased efficacy higher tolerance 
drug adults children, qn remains first-line treatment severe
malaria, especially africa. investigations microsatellite pfnhe-1 ms4760
polymorphisms culture-adapted isolates around world revealed
that increase number dnnnd amino acid motifs associated with
decreased qn susceptibility, whereas increase number ddnhndnhnnd
motifs associated increased qn susceptibility.
methods: context, analyse associations pfnhe-1 ms4760 
polymorphisms qn susceptibility, 393 isolates freshly collected between
october 2009 january 2010 july 2010 february 2011, respectively, at
the hôpital principal de dakar, senegal assessed ex vivo qn
susceptibility, genes amplified sequenced.
results: 393 plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates collected, 145 were
successfully cultured. 145 qn ic50s ranged 2.1 1291 nm, 17
isolates (11.7%) exceed qn reduced susceptibility threshold 611 nm. among 
the 393 p. falciparum clinical isolates, 47 different alleles observed. 
three prevalent profiles ms4760-1 (no = 72; 18.3%), ms4760-3 (no = 65; 
16.5%) ms4760-7 (no = 40; 10.2%). significant associations
observed qn ic50 values i) number repeats dnnnd block ii
(p = 0.0955, kruskal-wallis test); ii) number repeats ddnhndnhnnd in
block v (p = 0.1455, kruskal-wallis test); iii) ms4760 profiles (p = 0.1809,
kruskal-wallis test).
conclusions: pfnhe-1 ms4760 highly diverse parasite isolates dakar
(47 different profiles). three profiles (ms4760-1, ms4760-3 ms4760-7) were
predominant. number repeats block ii (dnnnd) block v (ddnhndnhnnd) 
was significantly associated qn susceptibility. new studies, and
especially vivo studies, necessary confirm role pfnhe-1 ms4760
as marker qn resistance.
