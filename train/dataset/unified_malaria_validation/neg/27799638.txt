the emergence artemisinin resistance among plasmodium falciparum the
greater mekong subregion threatens malaria control interventions is
associated multiple unique mutations k13 (pf3d7_1343700). aim this
study survey cambodian plasmodium vivax mutations k13 ortholog 
(k12, pvx_083080) might similarly confer artemisinin resistance. extracted
dna cambodian isolates collected 2009 2012 pooled by
province year submitted next-generation sequencing. single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps) identified using pile-up approach detected
minority snps. among 14 pools, found six unique snps, including three
nonsynonymous snps, across six codons k12 however, none snps were
orthologous artemisinin resistance-conferring mutations pf3d7_1343700, 
nonsynonymous changes persist time within populations. these
results suggest lack selection p. vivax population cambodia due to
artemisinin drug pressure.
