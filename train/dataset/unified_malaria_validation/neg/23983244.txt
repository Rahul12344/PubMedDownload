background: elucidating mechanisms naturally acquired immunity to
plasmodium falciparum infections would highly valuable malaria vaccine
development. asymptomatic multiclonal infections shown predict
protection clinical malaria transmission-dependent manner, the
mechanisms underlying unclear. assessed breadth antibody
responses several vaccine candidate merozoite antigens relation the
infecting parasite population clinical immunity.
methods: cohort study tanzania, 320 children aged 1-16 years were
asymptomatic baseline included. genotyped p. falciparum infections 
targeting msp2 gene using polymerase chain reaction capillary
electrophoresis measured antibodies 7 merozoite antigens using multiplex
assay. assessed correlation number clones breadth
of antibody response, examined effects risk malaria
during 40 weeks follow-up using age-adjusted multivariate regression models.
results: antibody breadth positively correlated number clones
(rr [risk ratio], 1.63; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.32-2.02). multiclonal
infections associated nonsignificant reduction risk malaria
in absence antibodies (rr, 0.83; 95% ci, .29-2.34). breadth the
antibody response significantly associated reduced risk malaria 
the absence infections (rr, 0.25; 95% ci, .09-.66). combination, these
factors associated lower risk malaria individually 
(rr, 0.14; 95% ci, .04-.48).
conclusions: data suggest malaria vaccines mimicking naturally
acquired immunity ideally induce antibody responses boosted by
natural infections.
