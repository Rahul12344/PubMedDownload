in iran, plasmodium vivax p. falciparum malaria detected, 
p. vivax predominant species. point mutations dihydrofolate reductase
(dhfr) gene plasmodia major mechanisms pyrimethamine
resistance. april 2007 june 2009, total 134 blood samples two
endemic areas southern iran collected patients infected p.
vivax p. falciparum. isolates analyzed p. vivax dihydrofolate
reductase (pvdhfr) p. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) point
mutations using various pcr-based methods. majority isolates (72.9%)
had wild type amino acids five codons pvdhfr. amongst mutant isolates, 
most common pvdhfr alleles double mutant 58 117 amino acids
(58r-117n). triple mutation 57, 58, 117 amino acids (57l/58r/117n) was
identified first time pvdhfr gene iranian p. vivax isolates.
all p. falciparumsamples analyzed (n = 16) possessed double mutant
pfdhfrallele (59r/108n) retained wild-type mutation position 51. this
may attributed fact falciparum malaria patients treated
using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) iran. presence mutant haplotypes
in p. vivax worrying, yet reached alarming threshold regarding 
drugs sp. results study reinforce importance of
performing molecular surveillance means continuous chemoresistance
assessment.
