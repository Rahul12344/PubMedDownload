background: genetic structural variation underpins multitude phenotypes,
with significant implications range biological outcomes. despite their
crucial role, structural variants (svs) often neglected overshadowed by
single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), used large-scale analysis
such genome-wide association population genetic studies.
results: facilitate high-throughput analysis structural variation we
have developed analytical pipeline visualisation tool, called sv-pop. 
utility pipeline demonstrated application large, 
multi-population p. falciparum dataset.
conclusions: designed facilitate downstream analysis visualisation
post-discovery, sv-pop allows straightforward integration multi-population
analysis, method sample-based concordance metrics, signals selection.
