due unique selective pressures extreme changes faced human
malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum throughout life cycle, parasite
has evolved distinct features alter gene expression patterns. along with
classical gene regulation transcription factors (tfs), one
family, ap2 tfs, described parasite genome, large body of
evidence points toward chromatin structure epigenetic factors mediating the
changes gene expression associated parasite life cycle stages. these
attributes may critically important immune evasion, host cell invasion and
development parasite two hosts, human anopheles vector.
thus, factors involved maintenance regulation chromatin and
epigenetic features represent potential targets antimalarial drugs. this
review, discuss mechanisms p. falciparum regulate chromatin
structure, nucleosome landscape, 3-dimensional structure genome and
additional distinctive features created parasite-specific genes gene
families. review conserved traits chromatin eukaryotes order to
highlight unique parasite.
