thirteen cuticular protein (cp) families recognized arthropods. in
this study, 250 anopheles sinensis cp genes identified named based on
genome transcriptome sequences. classified 10 families based
on motifs phylogenetic analyses. 11 insect species, nine cp
numbers > 150 apis mellifera tribolium castaneum cp numbers less
than 52. cps eight species occupied > 1.4% total genomic gene
number, whereas three species cps occupied < 1%. phylogenies 
cp family an. sinensis constructed discussed. 250 cps had
1-8 exons 144 cps (57.6%) two exons. intron length ranged from
66-3888 bp 174 introns (54.0%) 66-100 bp long. except two cps on
two contigs, 248 cps mapped onto 28 scaffolds 136 genes (54.4%)
restricted five scaffolds. total 107 cps clustered located 27
loci. cpr family conserved motif gsyslvepdgtvrtv. rr-1 subfamily 
had additional 21 amino acid (aa) motifs yvadengf sequence is
common insects. rr-2 subfamily additional 50 aa motifs two
additional regions rdgdvvkg g-x(3)-vv. comparison 115 orthologous
counterparts an. gambiae cps suggested purifying selection these
genes. study provides basic information useful studies on
biological functions an. sinensis cps well comparative genomics of
insect cps.
