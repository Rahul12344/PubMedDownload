the duffy blood group plays key role plasmodium knowlesi plasmodium
vivax invasion human erythrocytes. geographical distribution the
duffy alleles differs regions fy*a allele high
frequencies many asian populations, fy*b allele found predominately 
european populations fy*bes allele found predominantly african
regions. previous study peninsular malaysia indicated high homogeneity of
the dominant fy*a/fy*a genotype. however, distribution duffy genotypes
in malaysian borneo currently unknown. present study, distribution 
of duffy blood group genotypes allelic frequencies among p. knowlesi infected
patients well healthy individuals malaysian borneo determined. a
total 79 p. knowlesi patient blood samples 76 healthy donor samples were
genotyped using allele specific polymerase chain reaction (asp-pcr). subsequently
a p. knowlesi invasion assay carried fy*ab/ fy*a fy*a/ fy*a duffy 
genotype blood investigate either genotype conferred increased
susceptibility p. knowlesi invasion. results show almost equal
distribution homozygous fy*a/fy*a heterozygous fy*a/fy*b
genotypes. stark contrast duffy distribution peninsular
malaysia surrounding southeast asian region dominantly
fy*a/fy*a. mean percent invasion fy*a/fy*a fy*a/fy*b blood not
significantly different indicating neither blood group confers increased
susceptibility p. knowlesi invasion.
