background: although plasmodium vivax contributes almost half malaria
cases outside africa, relatively neglected compared more
deadly p. falciparum. known p. vivax populations possess high genetic 
diversity, differing geographically potentially due different vector species, 
host genetics environmental factors.
results: analysed high-quality genomic data 46 p. vivax isolates
spanning 10 countries across 4 continents. using population genetic methods we
identified hotspots selection pressure, including previously reported mrp1
and dhps genes, putative drug resistance loci. extra copies deletions in
the promoter region another drug resistance candidate, mdr1 gene, and
duplications duffy binding protein gene (pvdbp) potentially involved in
erythrocyte invasion, also identified. surveillance applications,
continental-informative markers found putative drug resistance loci, 
we show organellar polymorphisms could classify p. vivax populations across 
continents differentiate plasmodia spp.
conclusions: study shown genomic diversity lies within and
between p. vivax populations used elucidate potential drug resistance
and invasion mechanisms, well facilitate molecular barcoding the
parasite surveillance applications.
