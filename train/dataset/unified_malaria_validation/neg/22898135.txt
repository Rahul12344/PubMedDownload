background: aim study evaluate clinical outcome after
seven-day artesunate monotherapy uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria 
in yingjiang county along china-myanmar border investigate genetic
polymorphisms p. falciparum chloroquine-resistance transporter (pfcrt),
multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1), dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr),
dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps) atpase (pfatp6) genes.
methods: patients ≥ one year age fever (axillary temperature ≥37.5°c) 
history fever p. falciparum mono-infection included. patients
received anti-malarial treatment artesunate (total dose 16 mg/kg over
seven days) directly observed therapy. 28-day follow-up, treatment
efficacy effectiveness assessed based clinical parasitological
outcomes. treatment failure defined recrudescence original parasite
and distinguished new infection confirmed pcr. analysis gene mutation 
and amplification performed nested polymerase chain reaction.
results: sixty-five patients enrolled; 10 withdrew study, six
were lost follow-up. two patients demonstrated adequate clinical and
parasitological response; 12 detectable parasitaemia day 3. two
patients confirmed new infection pcr. efficacy artesunate
was 95.9%. pfcrt mutation codon 76 found isolates (100%), and
mutations codons 71 72 found 4.8% parasite isolates. no
mutation pfmdr1 (codons 86 1246) found. among samples, 5.1% were
wild type pfdhfr, whereas samples mutations four codons (51,
59, 108 164), mutations pfdhps (codons 436, 437, 540 581) were
found isolates. samples mutations pfatp6 codons 623 769, 
two new mutations (n683k r756k) found 4.6% 9.2% parasite
isolates, respectively.
conclusion: plasmodium falciparum infection associated slow parasite
clearance suspected artemisinin resistance china-myanmar border area. 
the prevalence pfcrt 76 markers sp resistance still high. it
should strengthened parasite clearance time clearance half life 
to confirm resistance status, molecular epidemiology provide
complementary information assess appropriateness current policies based
on artemisinin derivatives.
