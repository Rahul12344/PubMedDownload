the need sensitive time-efficient assay malaria led the
development molecular assays involving real-time pcr (qpcr), procedure 
has potential detect low levels parasitemia, identify mixed infections,
and allow precise differentiation species via melting curve analysis or
taqman fluorescence-labeled probes. since first study published 2001 at
least 17 assays developed, using ssurrna target
gene. used qpcr detect plasmodium falciparum p. vivax amplification 
of mtdna; technique evaluated whole-blood samples people living 
in areas malaria transmission brazilian amazon region located the
area inclusion highway br-163 (cuiabá-santarém) pará state: são luiz 
tapajós, municipal district itaituba (n = 74); três boeiras, municipal
district trairão (n = 134), são raimundo, municipal district aveiro
(n = 62). results real-time pcr-based method compared to
conventional microscopy established mtdna-pcr assay. qpcr (mtdna)
method 16-19 times efficient conventional pcr (mtdna) and
microscopy detecting plasmodial infections.
