mosquitoes vectors number important human animal diseases. the
development novel vector control strategies requires thorough understanding 
of mosquito biology. facilitate this, used rna-seq identify novel genes 
and provide first high-resolution view transcriptome throughout
development response blood feeding mosquito vector human
disease, aedes aegypti, primary vector dengue yellow fever. we
characterized mrna expression 34 distinct time points throughout aedes
development, including adult somatic germline tissues, using polya+
rna-seq. identify total 14,238 novel new transcribed regions
corresponding 12,597 new loci, well many novel transcript isoforms of
previously annotated genes. altogether results increase annotated
fraction transcribed genome long polya+ rnas twofold. we
also identified number patterns shared gene expression, well genes 
and/or exons expressed sex-specifically sex-differentially. expression
profiles small rnas ovaries, early embryos, testes, adult male and
female somatic tissues also determined, resulting identification of
38 new aedes-specific mirnas, ~291,000 small rna new transcribed regions,
many likely endogenous small-interfering rnas and
piwi-interacting rnas. genes potential interest transgene-based vector
control strategies also highlighted. data incorporated a
