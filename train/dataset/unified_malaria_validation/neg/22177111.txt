background: msp-1 one potential malarial vaccine candidate antigens.
however, extensive genetic polymorphism antigen field isolates 
plasmodium falciparum represents major hindrance development an
effective vaccine. therefore, study aimed establish prevalence and
genetic polymorphisms k1, mad20 ro33 allelic types msp-1 block 2 among 
p. falciparum clinical isolates lao pdr.
methods: plasmodium falciparum isolates collected 230 p.
falciparum-infected blood samples three regions lao pdr. k1, mad20 and
ro33 detected nested pcr; sscp used polymorphism screening. the
nested pcr products k1, mad20 ro33 allelic types different
banding patterns sscp, sequenced.
results: overall prevalence k1, mad20 ro33 allelic types p.
falciparum isolates lao pdr 66.95%, 46.52% 31.30%, respectively, of
samples study. single infections k1, mad20 ro33 allelic types were
27.83%, 11.74% 5.22%, respectively; remainders multiple clonal
infections. neither parasite density age related moi. sequence
analysis revealed 11 different types k1, eight different types
of mad20, 7 different types ro33. regional specific,
except type 1 allelic type common found 3 regions study.
conclusions: genetic polymorphism diverse allele types identified in
msp-1 block 2 among p. falciparum clinical isolates lao pdr. rather high
level multiple clonal infections also observed multiplicity of
infection rather low exceed 2.0. basic data useful for
treatment malaria control program lao pdr.
