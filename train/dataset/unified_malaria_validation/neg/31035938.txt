background: quinine (qn) remains effective drug malaria treatment.
however, quinine resistance (qnr) plasmodium falciparum reported in
many malaria-endemic regions particularly african countries. genetic
polymorphism p. falciparum na+/h+ exchanger (pfnhe1) considered to
influence qn susceptibility. here, ms4760 alleles pfnhe1 analysed from
imported african p. falciparum parasites isolated returning travellers in
wuhan, central china.
methods: total 204 dried-blood spots collected 2011-2016. the
polymorphisms pfnhe1 gene determined using nested pcr dna
sequencing.
results: sequences generated 99.51% (203/204) pcr products and
68.63% (140/204) isolates analysed successfully pfnhe1 ms4760
haplotypes. total, 28 distinct ms4760 alleles containing 0 5 dnnnd 1 to
3 nhndnhnnddd repeats identified. alleles, ms4760-1 (22.86%,
32/140), ms4760-3 (17.86%, 25/140), ms4760-7 (10.71%, 15/140) most
prevalent profiles. furthermore, 5 undescribed ms4760 alleles reported.
conclusions: study offers initial comprehensive analysis pfnhe1 ms4760 
polymorphisms imported p. falciparum isolates wuhan. pfnhe1 may
constitute good genetic marker evaluate prevalence qnr in
malaria-endemic non-endemic regions.
