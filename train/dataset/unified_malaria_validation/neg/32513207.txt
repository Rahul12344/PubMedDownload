background: plasmodium parasites undergo several major developmental transitions 
during complex lifecycle, enabled precisely ordered gene
expression programs. transcriptomes 48-h blood stages major human
malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum described using cdna microarrays
and rna-seq, assays always performed well within non-coding
regions, at-content often 90-95%.
results: developed directional, amplification-free rna-seq protocol
(daft-seq) reduce bias at-rich cdna, applied three
strains p. falciparum (3d7, hb3 it). strain-specific differences
were detected, overall strong conservation transcriptional
profiles. 3d7 reference strain, transcription detected 89% of
the genome, 78% genome transcribed mrnas. also find that
transcription bidirectional promoters frequently results non-coding,
antisense transcripts. datasets allowed us refine 5' 3'
untranslated regions (utrs), variable, long (> 1000 nt), often
overlap adjacent transcripts.
conclusions: approaches applied study allow refined description 
the transcriptional landscape p. falciparum demonstrate little
of densely packed p. falciparum genome inactive redundant. capturing
the 5' 3' ends mrnas, reveal constant dynamic use of
transcriptional start sites across intraerythrocytic developmental cycle that
will useful guiding definition regulatory regions use future 
experimental gene expression studies.
