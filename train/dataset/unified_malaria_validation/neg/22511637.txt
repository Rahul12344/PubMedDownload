objectives: curcumin natural plant product antimalarial activity and
immunomodulatory properties. study aimed investigate effects on
cd36 expression cd36-mediated plasmodium falciparum phagocytosis well as
the role played reactive oxygen species (ros) peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor γ retinoid x receptor (pparγ-rxr) these
processes.
methods: vitro antimalarial activity evaluated [³h]hypoxanthine
assay. ros production surface cd36 human monocyte/macrophages were
measured flow cytometry. pparγ cd36 mrna expression determined 
quantigene plex® assay rt-qpcr. nuclear pparγ activation analysed a
dna-binding elisa nuclear erythroid-related factor 2 (nrf2) expression 
analysed western blotting. p. falciparum phagocytosis assessed light
microscopy.
results: curcumin's antimalarial activity confirmed differ
between drug-susceptible -resistant p. falciparum strains. curcumin increased
monocyte ros production expression pparγ cd36 mrna protein 
levels. although pparγ activation blocked pparγ antagonist gw9662,
cd36 expression cd36-mediated p. falciparum phagocytosis inhibited 
by n-acetylcysteine (nac), suggesting pparγ-independent cd36 expression
pathway. identified seven putative nrf2 antioxidant response elements 
the cd36 gene promoter showed nac inhibited curcumin-induced nrf2
protein expression.
conclusions: cd36 expression cd36-mediated p. falciparum phagocytosis by
curcumin dependent ros production probably involve nrf2 pathway.
the dual immunomodulatory antimalarial mechanisms curcumin action may mean
that curcumin potential adjuvant treatment limiting risk of
recrudescence following standard antimalarial therapy.
