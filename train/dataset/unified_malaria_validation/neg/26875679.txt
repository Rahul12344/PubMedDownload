engineered gene drives - process stimulating biased inheritance of
specific genes - potential enable spread desirable genes
throughout wild populations suppress harmful species, may be
particularly useful control vector-borne diseases malaria.
although several types selfish genetic elements exist nature, been
successfully engineered laboratory thus far. discovery of
rna-guided crispr-cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats-crispr-associated 9) nucleases, utilized create,
streamline improve synthetic gene drives, rapidly changing. here, 
discuss different types engineered gene drives potential
applications, well current policies regarding safety regulation 
gene drives manipulation wild populations.
