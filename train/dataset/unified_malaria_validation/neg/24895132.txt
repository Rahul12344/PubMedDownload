diverse processes involved development malaria parasites. however, 
underlying molecular mechanisms pathways need unraveled, may be
achieved understanding regulation effectors second messengers.
calcium-dependent protein kinase (cdpk) family members regulate diverse parasitic
processes. cdpks absent host, kinases considered
as potential drug targets. dissected function atypical cdpk
from plasmodium falciparum, pfcdpk7. domain architecture pfcdpk7 very
different cdpks; pleckstrin homology domain adjacent 
to kinase domain two calcium-binding ef-hands n terminus. we
demonstrate pfcdpk7 interacts pi(4,5)p2 via pleckstrin homology
domain, may guide subcellular localization. disruption pfcdpk7
caused marked reduction growth blood stage parasites, as
maturation rings trophozoites markedly stalled. addition, parasite
proliferation significantly attenuated. findings shed light an
important role pfcdpk7 erythrocytic asexual cycle malaria
parasites.
