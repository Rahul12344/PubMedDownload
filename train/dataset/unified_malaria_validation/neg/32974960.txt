elucidating complex evolutionary armory mosquitoes deploy against
insecticides crucial maintain effectiveness insecticide-based
interventions. here, deciphered role 6.5-kb structural variation (sv)
in driving cytochrome p450-mediated pyrethroid resistance malaria vector, 
anopheles funestus. whole-genome pooled sequencing detected intergenic 6.5-kb 
sv duplicated cyp6p9a/b p450s pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes 
a translocation event. promoter analysis revealed 17.5-fold higher activity
(p < .0001) sv- carrying fragment sv- free one. quantitative
real-time pcr expression profiling cyp6p9a/b sv genotype supported
its role enhancer sv+/sv+ homozygote mosquitoes significantly
greater expression genes heterozygotes sv+/sv- (1.7- 2-fold) and
homozygotes sv-/sv- (4-to 5-fold). designing pcr assay revealed strong
association sv pyrethroid resistance (sv+/sv+ vs. sv-/sv-; odds 
ratio [or] = 2,079.4, p < .001). 6.5-kb sv present high frequency in
southern africa (80%-100%) absent east/central/west africa. experimental
hut trials revealed homozygote sv mosquitoes significantly greater
chance survive exposure pyrethroid-treated nets (or 27.7; p < .0001) to
blood feed susceptible mosquitoes. furthermore, mosquitoes
homozygote-resistant three loci (sv+/cyp6p9a_r/cyp6p9b_r) exhibited a
higher resistance level, leading far superior ability survive exposure to
nets homozygotes susceptible three loci, revealing strong
additive effect. study highlights important role structural
variations development insecticide resistance malaria vectors and
their detrimental impact effectiveness pyrethroid-based nets.
