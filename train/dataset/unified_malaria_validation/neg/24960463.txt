a key focus 21(st) century integrative biology drug discovery for
neglected tropical diseases use blast-based
computational methods identification orthologous groups pathogenic
organisms discern orthologs, view evaluate similarities and
differences among species, thus allow transfer annotation from
known/curated proteins new/non-annotated ones. used profile-based
sensitive methodology identify distant homologs, coupled ncbi's cog
(unicellular orthologs) kog (eukaryote orthologs), permitting us perform
comparative genomics analyses five protozoan genomes. orthosearch used 
five protozoan proteomes showing 3901 7473 orthologs identified
by comparison cog kog proteomes, respectively. core protozoa
proteome inferred 418 protozoa-cog orthologous groups 704 protozoa-kog
orthologous groups: (i) 31.58% (132/418) belongs category j (translation, 
ribosomal structure, biogenesis), 9.81% (41/418) category o
(post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones) using cog; (ii)
21.45% (151/704) belongs categories j, 13.92% (98/704) using 
kog. phylogenomic analysis showed four well-supported clades eukarya,
discriminating multicellular [(i) human, fly, plant worm] unicellular
[(ii) yeast, (iii) fungi, (iv) protozoa] species. encouraging results
attest usefulness profile-based methodology comparative
genomics accelerate semi-automatic re-annotation, especially protozoan 
proteomes. approach may also lend applications global health, 
for example, case novel drug target discovery pathogenic
organisms previously considered difficult research traditional drug
discovery tools.
