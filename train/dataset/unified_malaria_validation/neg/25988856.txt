peritoneal b-1a cells characterized expression cd5 enrichment
for germline-encoded igm b cell receptors. early studies showing expression 
diverse array vdj sequences among purified b-1a cells provided molecular
basis understanding heterogeneity b-1a cell repertoire.
antigen-driven positive selection identification b-1a specific
progenitors suggest multiple origins b-1a cells. introduction new
markers pd-l2, cd25, cd73, pc1 (plasma cell alloantigen 1, also known
as ectonucleotide phosphodiesterase/pyrophosphatase 1) helped identify
phenotypically functionally distinct b-1a subsets. among many b-1a subsets
defined new markers, pc1 unique subdivides b-1a cells into
pc1(hi) pc1(lo) subpopulations distinct functions, production of
natural igm gut iga, response pneumococcal antigen pps-3, secretion of
interleukin-10, support helper 1 (th 1) cell differentiation. rna
sequencing subsets revealed differential expression genes involved in
cellular movement immune cell trafficking. discuss new insights
underlying heterogeneous nature b-1a cell repertoire.
