glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency common enzymatic 
disorder humans appears protective falciparum severe
malaria. controversially, also thought plasmodium vivax driven the
recent selection g6pd alleles. use experimental approach determine
whether g6pd-mahidolg487a variant, widespread cause severe g6pd deficiency
in southeast asia, provides barrier vivax malaria. results show
that immature reticulocytes (cd71+) targeted p. vivax invasion are
enzymatically normal, even hemizygous g6pd-mahidol g487a mutants; thus,
allowing normal growth, development, high parasite density severely
deficient samples.
