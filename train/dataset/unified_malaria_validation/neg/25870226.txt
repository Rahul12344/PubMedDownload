erythrocytes infected malaria parasites increased permeability ions 
and nutrients, mediated plasmodial surface anion channel (psac) and
recently linked parasite clag3 genes. although encoded protein integral
to host membrane, precise contribution solute transport remains
unclear lacks conventional transmembrane domains have
homology ion channel proteins organisms. here, identified a
probable clag3 transmembrane domain adjacent variant extracellular motif.
helical-wheel analysis revealed strict segregation polar hydrophobic
residues opposite faces predicted α-helical transmembrane domain,
suggesting domain lines water-filled pore. single clag3 mutation
(a1210t) leupeptin-resistant psac mutant falls within transmembrane
domain may affect pore structure. allelic-exchange transfection and
site-directed mutagenesis revealed mutation alters solute selectivity
in channel. a1210t mutation also reduces blocking affinity psac
inhibitors bind opposite channel faces, consistent global changes in
channel structure. transfected parasites carrying mutation survived a
leupeptin challenge significantly better transfection control did. thus,
the a1210t mutation contributes directly altered psac activity and
leupeptin resistance. findings reveal molecular basis novel
antimalarial drug resistance mechanism, provide framework determining the
channel's composition structure, guide development of
therapies targeting psac.
