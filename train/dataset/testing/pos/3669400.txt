Two preparations of human serum albumin (Cohn fraction V), when subjected to
high-performance liquid chromatography, were found to contain albumin polymers
with molecular sizes of 35 X 10(4) daltons or greater (breakthrough fraction), as
well as tetramers, trimers and dimers. They bound to the envelope polypeptide of 
hepatitis B virus composed of translation products of the pre-S2 region and the S
gene (P31), carrying the receptor for polymerized human serum albumin, with an
activity increasing in parallel with the degree polymerization.
