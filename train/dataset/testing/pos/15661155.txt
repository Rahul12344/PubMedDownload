Rinderpest virus (RPV) is a morbillivirus that causes a highly contagious disease
affecting members of the order Artiodactyla. The viral L protein is the catalytic
subunit of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. To search for host cell proteins
with which L interacts, a library screen was performed using the yeast two-hybrid
system. Several host cell proteins were recovered from the library screen as
putative L-interactors; one of these was identified as striatin. A direct
interaction between RPV L and striatin was confirmed using both
co-immunoprecipitation assays and co-localisation studies using confocal
microscopy. Striatin was also shown to co-localise with the RPV L protein in
infected cells. The L proteins of morbilliviruses consist of three long highly
conserved domains separated by short unconserved stretches of amino acids. The L 
domain with which striatin interacts was investigated by co-immunoprecipitation
and striatin was shown to interact primarily with the central conserved domain.
