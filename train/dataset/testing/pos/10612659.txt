Host proteins are incorporated both on and inside human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 (HIV-1) virions. To identify cellular proteins inside HIV-1, virion
preparations were treated by a protease-digestion technique that removes external
host proteins, allowing for the study of the proteins inside the virus. Treated
HIV-1 preparations were analyzed by immunoblot, high-pressure liquid
chromatography, and protein sequence analyses. These analyses identified several 
cellular proteins inside HIV-1: elongation factor 1alpha,
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, HS-1, phosphatidylethanolamine-binding 
protein, Pin1, Lck, Nm23-H1, and the C-terminal tail of CD43. Several of these
proteins were found as fragments of their full-sized proteins that appear to be
generated by our protease treatment of the virions, the HIV-1 protease, or a
cellular protease. Recent advances in cell biology and biochemistry have
identified some of these proteins as actin-binding proteins. These results
support the hypothesis that actin filaments are incorporated into the virion and 
may provide additional clues for the understanding of the interaction between
viral and cellular proteins during assembly and budding.
