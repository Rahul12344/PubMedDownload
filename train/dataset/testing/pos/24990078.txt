Many members of the DEXD/H box helicase family play important roles in the innate
immune system against viral infection. Therefore, we isolated dsRNA complex in
myeloid dendritic cells. We found that DHx15, a DEXDc helicase family member, is 
one of the components of this complex. Knockdown of DHX15 expression by short
hairpin RNA efficiently reduced the ability of myeloid dendritic cells to produce
IFN-β, IL-6, and TNF-α in response to dsRNA and RNA virus. DHX15 specifically
bound polyinosine-polycytidylic acid via its helicase C-terminal domain. DHX15
interacted with MAVS and formed a complex following stimulation with
polyinosine-polycytidylic acid. The N-terminal domain containing a DEXDc motif in
DHX15 bound the C terminus of MAVS. DHX15 is required to activate IRF3
phosphorylation as well as NF-κB and MAPK signaling during RNA virus infection.
We, therefore, identified DHX15 as a new RNA virus sensor mediated by MAVS to
activate the immune responses to RNA.
