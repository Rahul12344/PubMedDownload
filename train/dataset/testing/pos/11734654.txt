Cancer cells may undergo loss or alterations in functions that certain viruses
normally target to promote virus replication. Virus mutants that have lost the
targeting function(s) should be able to grow in such cancer cells but not in
normal cells. A "tumor host range" (t-hr) selection procedure has been devised
and applied to polyoma virus based on this rationale. Studies of one t-hr mutant 
have led to the identification of the mSal2 gene product (p150(sal2)) as a
binding partner of the large T antigen. mSal2 encodes a multizinc finger protein 
and putative transcription factor homologous to the Drosophila homeotic gene
Spalt. The t-hr mutant encodes an altered large T protein that fails to interact 
with p150(sal2) and is defective in replication and tumor induction in newborn
mice.
