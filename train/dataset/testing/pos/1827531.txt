The hepatitis B virus (HBV) X gene product trans-activates viral and cellular
genes. The X protein (pX) does not bind independently to nucleic acids. The data 
presented here demonstrate that pX entered into a protein-protein complex with
the cellular transcriptional factors CREB and ATF-2 and altered their DNA binding
specificities. Although CREB and ATF-2 alone did not bind to the HBV enhancer
element, a pX-CREB or pX-ATF-2 complex did bind to the HBV enhancer. Thus, the
ability of pX to interact with cellular factors broadened the DNA binding
specificity of these regulatory proteins and provides a mechanism for pX to
participate in transcriptional regulation. This strategy of altered binding
specificity may modify the repertoire of genes that can be regulated by
transcriptional factors during viral infection.
