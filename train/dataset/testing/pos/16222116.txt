Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) from the high-risk group are associated with
cervical cancer, in contrast to HPVs from the low-risk group which are associated
with benign lesions of the genital tract. Here, we show that high-risk, but not
low-risk HPV E2 proteins, promote a mitotic block, often followed by
metaphase-specific apoptosis, and which is independent of the viral oncogenes E6 
and E7. High-risk HPV E2-expressing cells also show polyploidy, chromosomal
mis-segregation and centrosome amplification leading to genomic instability. We
link these defects to a specific and unusually strong interaction between
high-risk E2 and both Cdc20 and Cdh1, two activators of the Anaphase Promoting
Complex (APC), abnormal localization of Cdh1, and accumulation of APC substrates 
like cyclin B, in vivo. The finding that high-risk, but not low-risk HPV E2
proteins, induce genomic instability, raises the intriguing possibility that E2
proteins play a role in the oncogenic potential of high-risk papillomaviruses.
