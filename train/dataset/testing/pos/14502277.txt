Understanding the process of vector transduction has important implications for
the application and optimal use of a vector system for human gene therapy. Recent
studies with vectors based on adeno-associated virus type 5 (AAV-5) have shown
utility of this vector system in the lung, central nervous system, muscle and
eye. To understand the natural tropism of this virus and to identify proteins
necessary for AAV-5 transduction, we characterized 43 cell lines as permissive or
nonpermissive for AAV-5 transduction and compared the gene expression profiles
derived from cDNA microarray analyses of those cell lines. A statistically
significant correlation was observed between expression of the platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (PDGFR-alpha-polypeptide) and AAV-5 transduction.
Subsequent experiments confirmed the role of PDGFR-alpha and PDGFR-beta as
receptors for AAV-5. The tropism of AAV-5 in vivo also correlated with the
expression pattern of PDGFR-alpha.
