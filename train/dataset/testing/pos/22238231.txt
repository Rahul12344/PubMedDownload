A proline-rich region (PRR) within the rubella virus (RUBV) P150 replicase
protein that contains three SH3 domain-binding motifs (PxxPxR) was investigated
for its ability to bind cell proteins. Pull-down experiments using a glutathione 
S-transferase-PRR fusion revealed PxxPxR motif-specific binding with human p32
protein (gC1qR), which could be mediated by either of the first two motifs. This 
finding was of interest because p32 protein also binds to the RUBV capsid
protein. Binding of p32 to P150 was confirmed and was abolished by mutation of
the first two motifs. When mutations in the first two motifs were introduced into
a RUBV cDNA infectious clone, virus replication was significantly impaired.
However, virus RNA synthesis was found to be unaffected, and subsequent
immunofluorescence analysis of RUBV-infected cells revealed co-localization of
p32 and P150 but little overlap of p32 with RNA replication complexes, indicating
that p32 does not participate directly in virus RNA synthesis. Thus, the role of 
p32 in RUBV replication remains unresolved.
