APOBEC1 (A1) is a cytidine deaminase involved in the regulation of lipids in the 
small intestine. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a ubiquitous pathogen that is 
capable of infecting neurons in the brain, causing encephalitis. Here, we show
that A1 is induced during encephalitis in neurons of rats infected with HSV-1. In
cells stably expressing A1, HSV-1 infection resulted in significantly reduced
virus replication compared to that in control cells. Infectivity could be
restored to levels comparable to those observed for control cells if A1
expression was silenced by specific A1 short hairpin RNAs (shRNA). Moreover,
cytidine deaminase activity appeared to be essential for this inhibition and led 
to an impaired accumulation of viral mRNA transcripts and DNA copy numbers. The
sequencing of viral gene UL54 DNA, extracted from infected A1-expressing cells,
revealed G-to-A and C-to-T transitions, indicating that A1 associates with HSV-1 
DNA. Taken together, our results demonstrate a model in which A1 induction during
encephalitis in neurons may aid in thwarting HSV-1 infection.
