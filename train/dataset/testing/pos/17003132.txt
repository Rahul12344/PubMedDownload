The presence of the envelope glycoprotein Env in HIV-1 virions is essential for
infectivity. To date, the molecular mechanism by which Env is packaged into
virions has been largely unknown. Here, we show that TIP47 (tail-interacting
protein of 47 kDa), which has been shown to interact with Env, also binds the MA 
(matrix) domain of HIV-1 Gag protein and that these three proteins form a ternary
complex. Mutations in Gag that abrogate interaction with TIP47 inhibit Env
incorporation and virion infectivity as well as colocalization between Gag and
Env. We also show that TIP47 silencing impairs Env incorporation and infectivity 
and abolishes coimmunoprecipitation of Gag with Env. In contrast, overexpression 
of TIP47 increases Env packaging. Last, we demonstrate that TIP47 can interact
simultaneously with Env and Gag. Taken together, our results show that TIP47 is a
cellular cofactor that plays an essential role in Env incorporation, allowing the
encounter and the physical association between HIV-1 Gag and Env proteins during 
the viral assembly process.
