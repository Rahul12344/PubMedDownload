Hemorrhagic manifestations occur frequently accompanying a wide range of dengue
disease syndromes. Much work has focused on the contribution of immune factors to
the pathogenesis of hemorrhage, but how dengue virus (DENV) participates in the
pathogenic process has never been explored. Although there is no consensus that
apoptosis is the basis of vascular permeability in human dengue infections, we
showed in dengue hemorrhage mouse model that endothelial cell apoptosis is
important to hemorrhage development in mice. To explore the molecular basis of
the contribution of DENV to endothelial cell death, we show in this study that
DENV protease interacts with cellular IκBα and IκBβ and cleaves them. By inducing
IκBα and IκBβ cleavage and IκB kinase activation, DENV protease activates NF-κB, 
which results in endothelial cell death. Intradermal inoculation of DENV protease
packaged in adenovirus-associated virus-9 induces endothelial cell death and
dermal hemorrhage in mice. Although the H51 activity site is not involved in the 
interaction between DENV protease and IκB-α/β, the enzymatic activity is critical
to the ability of DENV protease to induce IκBα and IκBβ cleavage and trigger
hemorrhage development. Moreover, overexpression of IκBα or IκBβ protects
endothelial cells from DENV-induced apoptosis. In this study, we show that DENV
protease participates in the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhage and discover IκBα 
and IκBβ to be the new cellular targets that are cleaved by DENV protease.
