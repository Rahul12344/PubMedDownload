Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gene expression is activated by Tat, 
a virally encoded protein. Tat trans-activation requires viral
(trans-activation--responsive; TAR) RNA sequences located in the R region of the 
long terminal repeat (LTR). Existing evidence suggests that Tat probably
cooperates with cellular factors that bind to TAR RNA in the overall
trans-activation process. A HeLa complementary DNA was isolated and characterized
that encodes a TAR RNA-binding protein (TRBP). TRBP activated the HIV-1 LTR and
was synergistic with Tat function.
