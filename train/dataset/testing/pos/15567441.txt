Cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) mediate internalization of
HIV-1 Tat. Herein, we report that human WiDr cells, which express perlecan but no
other HSPGs, can internalize 125I-labeled Tat with minimal lysosomal degradation.
Pre-treatment of cells with heparitinase almost completely abolished 125I-Tat
surface binding, while the use of an HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)
promoter-reporter construct demonstrated that transactivation was potently
blocked by pretreatment of cells with heparitinase, indicating an essential role 
for perlecan in the biologic effects of Tat. We conclude that the perlecan
mediates Tat uptake and is required for HIV-1 LTR-directed transactivation in
this human cell type.
