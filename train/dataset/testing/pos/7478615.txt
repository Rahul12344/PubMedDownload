A function shared by the adenovirus E1A, papillomavirus E7 and SV40 TAg
oncoproteins is their ability to interfere with normal cell growth by interacting
with members of the retinoblastoma protein family. In this study, we show that
each of these oncoproteins can also bind to the 921 amino acid TBP-associated
factor-110 (TAF-110). The significance of the binding is underscored by the
observation that each oncoprotein binds to the same 77 amino acid carboxyl region
of TAF-110. In the case of E1A and TAg, this finding is consistent with their
abilities to stimulate transcription initiation, in part, through their known
interactions with TBP. While it is not clear whether E7 can also activate
promoters through protein:protein interactions with components of the
transcription initiation complex, our demonstration that E7 can bind to TAF-110, 
as well as TBP, suggests that E7 may modulate the expression of specific
promoters which could contribute to the pathogenesis of human papillomavirus.
