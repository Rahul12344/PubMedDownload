Transport of cargoes by kinesin-1 is essential for many cellular processes.
Nevertheless, the number of proteins known to recruit kinesin-1 via its cargo
binding light chain (KLC) is still quite small. We also know relatively little
about the molecular features that define kinesin-1 binding. We now show that a
bipartite tryptophan-based kinesin-1 binding motif, originally identified in
Calsyntenin is present in A36, a vaccinia integral membrane protein. This
bipartite motif in A36 is required for kinesin-1-dependent transport of the virus
to the cell periphery. Bioinformatic analysis reveals that related bipartite
tryptophan-based motifs are present in over 450 human proteins. Using vaccinia as
a surrogate cargo, we show that regions of proteins containing this motif can
function to recruit KLC and promote virus transport in the absence of A36. These 
proteins interact with the kinesin light chain outside the context of infection
and have distinct preferences for KLC1 and KLC2. Our observations demonstrate
that KLC binding can be conferred by a common set of features that are found in a
wide range of proteins associated with diverse cellular functions and human
diseases.
