A computer search revealed 10 proteins with homology to the sequence we
originally identified in vimentin as the site of cleavage by human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease. Of these 10 proteins (actin,
alpha-actinin, spectrin, tropomyosins, vinculin, dystrophin, MAP-2, villin, TRK-1
and Ig mu-chain), we show that 4 of the first 5 were cleaved in vitro by this
protease, as are MAP-1 and -2 [(1990) J. Gen. Virol. 71, 1985-1991]. In these
proteins, cleavage is not restricted to a single motif, but occurs at many sites.
However, cleavage is not random, since 9 other proteins including the
cytoskeletal proteins filamin and band 4.1 are not cleaved in the in vitro assay.
Thus, the ability of HIV-1 protease to cleave specific components of the
cytoskeleton may be an important, although as yet unevaluated aspect of the life 
cycle of this retrovirus and/or may directly contribute to the pathogenesis
observed during infection.
