Diverse members of the Paramyxovirus family of negative-strand RNA viruses
effectively suppress host innate immune responses through the actions of their V 
proteins. The V protein mediates interference with the interferon regulatory RNA 
helicase MDA5 to avoid cellular antiviral responses. Analysis of the interaction 
interface revealed the MDA5 helicase C domain as necessary and sufficient for
association with V proteins from human parainfluenza virus type 2, parainfluenza 
virus type 5, measles virus, mumps virus, Hendra virus, and Nipah virus. The
identified approximately 130-residue region is highly homologous between MDA5 and
the related antiviral helicase LGP2, but not RIG-I. Results indicate that the
paramyxovirus V proteins can also associate with LGP2. The V protein interaction 
was found to disrupt ATP hydrolysis mediated by both MDA5 and LGP2. These
findings provide a potential mechanistic basis for V protein-mediated helicase
interference and identify LGP2 as a second cellular RNA helicase targeted by
paramyxovirus V proteins.
