APOBEC3 proteins constitute a family of cytidine deaminases that provide
intracellular resistance to retrovirus replication and transposition of
endogenous retroelements. One family member, APOBEC3A (hA3A), is an orphan,
without any known antiviral activity. We show that hA3A is catalytically active
and that it, but none of the other family members, potently inhibits replication 
of the parvovirus adeno-associated virus (AAV). hA3A was also a potent inhibitor 
of the endogenous LTR retroelements, MusD, IAP, and the non-LTR retroelement,
LINE-1. Its function was dependent on the conserved amino acids of the hA3A
active site, consistent with a role for cytidine deamination, although mutations 
in retroelement sequences were not found. These findings demonstrate the potent
activity of hA3A, an APOBEC3 family member with no previously identified
function. They also highlight the functional differences between APOBEC3
proteins. The APOBEC3 family members have distinct functions and may have evolved
to resist various classes of genetic elements.
