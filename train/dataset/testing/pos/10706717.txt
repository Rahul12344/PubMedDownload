IL-18 induces IFN-gamma and NK cell cytotoxicity, making it a logical target for 
viral antagonism of host defense. We demonstrate that the ectromelia poxvirus p13
protein, bearing homology to the mammalian IL-18 binding protein, binds IL-18,
and inhibits its activity in vitro. Binding of IL-18 to the viral p13 protein was
compared with binding to the cellular IL-18R. The dissociation constant of p13
for murine IL-18 is 5 nM, compared with 0.2 nM for the cellular receptor
heterodimer. Mice infected with a p13 deletion mutant of ectromelia virus had
elevated cytotoxicity for YAC-1 tumor cell targets compared with control animals.
Additionally, the p13 deletion mutant virus exhibited decreased levels of
infectivity. Our data suggest that inactivation of IL-18, and subsequent
impairment of NK cell cytotoxicity, may be one mechanism by which ectromelia
evades the host immune response.
