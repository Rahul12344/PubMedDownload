Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are crucial in the innate immune response to
pathogens, in that they recognize and respond to pathogen associated molecular
patterns, which leads to activation of intracellular signaling pathways and
altered gene expression. Vaccinia virus (VV), the poxvirus used to vaccinate
against smallpox, encodes proteins that antagonize important components of host
antiviral defense. Here we show that the VV protein A52R blocks the activation of
the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) by multiple TLRs,
including TLR3, a recently identified receptor for viral RNA. A52R associates
with both interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 2 (IRAK2) and tumor necrosis
factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), two key proteins important in TLR
signal transduction. Further, A52R could disrupt signaling complexes containing
these proteins. A virus deletion mutant lacking the A52R gene was attenuated
compared with wild-type and revertant controls in a murine intranasal model of
infection. This study reveals a novel mechanism used by VV to suppress the host
immunity. We demonstrate viral disabling of TLRs, providing further evidence for 
an important role for this family of receptors in the antiviral response.
