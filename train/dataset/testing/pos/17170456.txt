It has previously been shown by our laboratory that OTK18, a human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-inducible zinc-finger protein, reduces
progeny-virion production in infected human macrophages. OTK18 antiviral activity
is mediated through suppression of Tat-induced HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)
promoter activity. Through the use of LTR-scanning mutant vectors, the specific
regions responsible for OTK18-mediated LTR suppression have been defined. Two
different LTR regions were identified as potential OTK18-binding sites by an
enhanced DNA-transcription factor ELISA system; the negative-regulatory element
(NRE) at -255/-238 and the Ets-binding site (EBS) at -150/-139 in the LTR. In
addition, deletion of the EBS in the LTR blocked OTK18-mediated LTR suppression. 
These data indicate that OTK18 suppresses LTR activity through two distinct
regulatory elements. Spontaneous mutations in these regions might enable HIV-1 to
escape from OTK18 antiretroviral activity in human macrophages.
