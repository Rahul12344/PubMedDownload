Picornavirus Type 1 IRESs comprise five principal domains (dII-dVI). Whereas dV
binds eIF4G, a conserved AUG in dVI was suggested to stimulate attachment of 43S 
ribosomal preinitiation complexes, which then scan to the initiation codon.
Initiation on Type 1 IRESs also requires IRES trans-acting factors (ITAFs), and
several candidates have been proposed. Here, we report the in vitro
reconstitution of initiation on three Type 1 IRESs: poliovirus (PV), enterovirus 
71 (EV71), and bovine enterovirus (BEV). All of them require eIF2, eIF3, eIF4A,
eIF4G, eIF4B, eIF1A, and a single ITAF, poly(C) binding protein 2 (PCBP2). In
each instance, initiation starts with binding of eIF4G/eIF4A. Subsequent
recruitment of 43S complexes strictly requires direct interaction of their eIF3
constituent with eIF4G. The following events can differ between IRESs, depending 
on the stability of dVI. If it is unstructured (BEV), all ribosomes scan through 
dVI to the initiation codon, requiring eIF1 to bypass its AUG. If it is
structured (PV, EV71), most initiation events occur without inspection of dVI,
implying that its AUG does not determine ribosomal attachment.
