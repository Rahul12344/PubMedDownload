The essential proteins NS1 and NS2 of minute virus of mice are encoded by mRNAs
R1 and R2, respectively. R2 is derived from R1 by excision of a large intron and 
thus splicing governs the relative ratios of NS1 and NS2. Excision of the large
intron utilizes a nonconsensus 5' donor site. We identified a U-rich and A-rich
intronic sequence immediately downstream of the nonconsensus 5' donor site that
functions as an intronic splicing enhancer (ISE) required for efficient
large-intron excision. The ISE binds the cellular RNA-processing proteins TIA-1
and TIAR, which enhance usage of the nonconsensus donor.
