BCA2 (Rabring7, RNF115 or ZNF364) is a RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligase that was
identified as a co-factor in the restriction imposed by tetherin/BST2 on HIV-1.
Contrary to the current model, in which BCA2 lacks antiviral activity in the
absence of tetherin, we found that BCA2 possesses tetherin-independent antiviral 
activity. Here we show that the N-terminus of BCA2 physically interacts with the 
Matrix region of HIV-1 and other retroviral Gag proteins and promotes their
ubiquitination, redistribution to endo-lysosomal compartments and, ultimately,
lysosomal degradation. The targeted depletion of BCA2 in tetherin-expressing and 
tetherin-deficient cells results in a significant increase in virus release and
replication, indicating that endogenous BCA2 possesses antiviral activity.
Therefore, these results indicate that BCA2 functions as an antiviral factor that
targets HIV-1 Gag for degradation, impairing virus assembly and release.
