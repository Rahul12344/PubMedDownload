Human phospholipid scramblase (PLSCR) 1 expression is strongly activated in
response to interferon (IFN) treatment and viral infection, and PLSCR1 is
necessary for the IFN-dependent induction of gene expression and antiviral
activity. We show here that PLSCR1 directly interacts with human T-cell leukemia 
virus type-1 (HTLV-1) Tax in vitro and in vivo. This interaction reduced the
cytoplasmic distribution of Tax. PLSCR1 efficiently repressed the Tax-mediated
transactivation of the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat and the NF-κB binding site
reporter constructs in an interaction-dependent manner in COS-1 and Tax-producing
HTLV-1-infected T cell lines. Furthermore, we show that PLSCR1 repressed the
homodimerization of Tax in vitro. These data reveal for the first time that
PLSCR1 specifically interacts with HTLV-1 Tax and negatively regulates its
transactivation activity by altering the subcellular distribution and the
homodimerization of Tax. PLSCR1 may play an important role in the IFN-mediated
repression of Tax-dependent transactivation during HTLV-1 infection.
