The enteroviruses poliovirus (PV), Coxsackie B virus (CVB) and rhinovirus (HRV)
are members of Picornaviridae that inhibit host cell translation early in
infection. Enterovirus translation soon predominates in infected cells, but
eventually also shuts off. This complex pattern of modulation of translation
suggests regulation by a multifactorial mechanism. We report here that eIF5B is
proteolytically cleaved during PV and CVB infection of cultured cells, beginning 
at 3 hours post-infection and increasing thereafter. Recombinant PV, CVB and HRV 
3Cpro cleaved purified native rabbit eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 5B in
vitro at a single site (VVEQG, equivalent to VMEQG479 in human eIF5B) that is
consistent with the cleavage specificity of enterovirus 3C proteases. Cleavage
separates the N-terminal domain of eIF5B from its essential conserved central
GTPase and C-terminal domains. 3Cpro-mediated cleavage of eIF5B may thus play an 
accessory role in the shutoff of translation that occurs in enterovirus-infected 
cells.
