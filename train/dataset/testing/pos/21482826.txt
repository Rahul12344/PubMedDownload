HIV-1 p17 matrix protein interacts with heparan sulfate side chain of CD44v3,
syndecan-2, and syndecan-4 proteoglycans expressed on human activated CD4+ T
cells affecting tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 2 production.

HIV-1 p17 contains C- and N-terminal sequences with positively charged residues
and a consensus cluster for heparin binding. We have previously demonstrated by
affinity chromatography that HIV-1 p17 binds strongly to heparin-agarose at
physiological pH and to human activated CD4(+) T cells. In this study we
demonstrated that the viral protein binds to heparan sulfate side chains of
syndecan-2, syndecan-4, and CD44v3 purified from HeLa cells and that these
heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) co-localize with HIV-1 p17 on activated
human CD4(+) T cells by confocal fluorescence analysis. Moreover, we observed a
stimulatory or inhibitory activity when CD4(+) T cells were activated with
mitogens together with nanomolar or micromolar concentrations of the matrix
protein.
