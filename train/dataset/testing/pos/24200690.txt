Inhibition of Coxsackievirus-associated dystrophin cleavage prevents
cardiomyopathy.

Heart failure in children and adults is often the consequence of myocarditis
associated with Coxsackievirus (CV) infection. Upon CV infection, enteroviral
protease 2A cleaves a small number of host proteins including dystrophin, which
links actin filaments to the plasma membrane of muscle fiber cells (sarcolemma). 
It is unknown whether protease 2A-mediated cleavage of dystrophin and subsequent 
disruption of the sarcolemma play a role in CV-mediated myocarditis. We generated
knockin mice harboring a mutation at the protease 2A cleavage site of the
dystrophin gene, which prevents dystrophin cleavage following CV infection.
Compared with wild-type mice, we found that mice expressing cleavage-resistant
dystrophin had a decrease in sarcolemmal disruption and cardiac virus titer
following CV infection. In addition, cleavage-resistant dystrophin inhibited the 
cardiomyopathy induced by cardiomyocyte-restricted expression of the CV protease 
2A transgene. These findings indicate that protease 2A-mediated cleavage of
dystrophin is critical for viral propagation, enteroviral-mediated cytopathic
effects, and the development of cardiomyopathy.
