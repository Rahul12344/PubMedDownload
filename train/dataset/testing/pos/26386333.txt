Cytoplasmic Processing bodies (P bodies), the RNA-protein aggregation foci of
translationally stalled and potentially decaying mRNA, have been reported to be
differentially modulated by viruses. Rotavirus, the causative agent of acute
infantile gastroenteritis is a double stranded RNA virus which completes its
entire life-cycle exclusively in host cell cytoplasm. In this study, the fate of 
P bodies was investigated upon rotavirus infection. It was found that P bodies
get disrupted during rotavirus infection. The disruption occurred by more than
one different mechanism where deadenylating P body component Pan3 was degraded by
rotavirus NSP1 and exonuclease XRN1 along with the decapping enzyme hDCP1a were
relocalized from cytoplasm to nucleus. Overall the study highlights decay and
subcellular relocalization of P body components as novel mechanisms by which
rotavirus subverts cellular antiviral responses.
