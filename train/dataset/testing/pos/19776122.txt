The DNA genome of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replicates via reverse transcription
within capsids following the encapsidation of an RNA template, the pregenomic RNA
(pgRNA). We previously demonstrated that the 5' cap proximity of the stem-loop
structure (epsilon or epsilon), an encapsidation signal, is critically important 
for the encapsidation of the pgRNA (J. K. Jeong, G. S. Yoon, and W. S. Ryu, J.
Virol. 74:5502-5508, 2000). Therefore, we speculated that the viral polymerase
(Pol), while bound to the 5' epsilon stem-loop structure, could recognize the cap
via its interaction with eIF4E, a eukaryotic translation initiation factor. Our
data showed the direct interaction between HBV Pol and eIF4E, as measured by
coimmunoprecipitation. Further, we demonstrated that eIF4E interacts with the
Pol-epsilon ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) rather than Pol alone, resulting in
eIF4E-Pol-epsilon RNP complex formation. In addition, we asked whether eIF4E
remains engaged to the Pol-epsilon RNP complex during nucleocapsid assembly.
Density gradient analysis revealed that eIF4E indeed was incorporated into
nucleocapsids. It is of great importance to uncover whether the incorporated
eIF4E contributes to viral reverse transcription or other steps in the HBV life
cycle.
