Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with human malignancies, especially those 
affecting the B cell compartment such as Burkitt lymphoma. The virally encoded
homolog of the mammalian pro-survival protein Bcl-2, BHRF1 contributes to viral
infectivity and lymphomagenesis. In addition to the pro-apoptotic BH3-only
protein Bim, its key target in lymphoid cells, BHRF1 also binds a selective
sub-set of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bid, Puma, Bak) expressed by host cells. A
consequence of BHRF1 expression is marked resistance to a range of cytotoxic
agents and in particular, we show that its expression renders a mouse model of
Burkitt lymphoma untreatable. As current small organic antagonists of Bcl-2 do
not target BHRF1, the structures of it in complex with Bim or Bak shown here will
be useful to guide efforts to target BHRF1 in EBV-associated malignancies, which 
are usually associated with poor clinical outcomes.
