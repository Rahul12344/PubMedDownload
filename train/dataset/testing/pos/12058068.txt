The vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) is a multisubunit enzyme that facilitates the
acidification of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells and plays an
important role in receptor-mediated endocytosis, intracellular trafficking
processes, and protein degradation. In this study we show that the C-terminal
fragment of 350 residues of the regulatory subunit H (V1H) of the V-ATPase shares
structural and functional homologies with the beta-chains of adaptor protein
complexes. Moreover, the fragment is similar to a region in the beta-subunit of
COPI coatomer complexes, which suggests the existence of a shared domain in these
three different families of proteins. For beta-adaptins, this fragment binds to
cytoplasmic di-leucine-based sorting motifs such as in HIV-1 Nef that mediate
endocytic trafficking. Expression of this fragment in cells blocks the
internalization of transmembrane proteins, which depend on di-leucine-based
motifs, whereas mutation of the consensus sequence GEY only partly diminishes the
recognition of the sorting motif. Based on recent structural analysis, our
results suggest that the di-leucine-binding domain consists of a HEAT or ARM
repeat protein fold.
