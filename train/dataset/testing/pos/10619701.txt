The inhibitory properties of phosphorylated cystatin alpha (P-cystatin alpha) and
a conjugated protein of the P-cystatin alpha with filaggrin linker segment
peptide (FLSP) against the growth of Staphylococcus bacteria and poliovirus were 
investigated. Both the P-cystatin alpha and the conjugated protein (P-cystatin
alpha-FLSP conjugate) as a model for the cornified envelope of skin inhibited the
cysteine protease activity of Staphylococcus aureus V8. The protease activity was
inhibited by normal cornified envelope of newborn rat skin, which contains
P-cystatin alpha, and P-cystatin alpha in cornified envelope of newborn rat skin 
also suppressed the growth of S. aureus V8. When P-cystatin alpha or P-cystatin
alpha-FLSP conjugate was added to cultured HeLa cells infected with poliovirus,
50-70% of the cell-death due to poliovirus infection was prevented. The
poliovirus 3C protease activity in the infected HeLa cells was inhibited by
P-cystatin alpha or P-cystatin alpha-FLSP conjugate. As a result, the processing 
of viral capsid peptides was suppressed. These findings suggest that P-cystatin
alpha and P-cystatin alpha-FLSP conjugate could play the role of the barrier
against microorganism infections due to inhibition of their cysteine protease
activities.
