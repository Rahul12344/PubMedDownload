The K1L protein of vaccinia virus is required for its growth in certain cell
lines (RK-13 and human). The cowpox host-range protein CP77 has been shown to
complement K1L function in RK-13 cells, despite a lack of homology between the
two proteins except for ankyrin repeats. We investigated the role of ankyrin
repeats of K1L protein in RK-13 cells. The growth of a recombinant vaccinia
virus, with K1L gene mutated in the most conserved ankyrin repeat, was severely
impaired. Infection with the mutant virus caused shutdown of cellular and viral
protein synthesis early in infection. We also investigated the interaction of K1L
protein with cellular proteins and found that K1L interacts with the rabbit
homologue of human ACAP2, a GTPase-activating protein with ankyrin repeats. Our
result suggests the importance of ankyrin repeat for host-range function of K1L
in RK-13 cells and identifies ACAP2 as a cellular protein, which may be
interacting with K1L.
