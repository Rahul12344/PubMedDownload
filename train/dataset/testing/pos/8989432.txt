Apolipoprotein H (apo H), isolated from human plasma albumin solution, was shown 
to capture HIV-1-related antigens from antigen-positive sera (HIV-1 AG+) of AIDS 
patients, by using HIV-1-specific polyclonal antibodies. In an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay and ligand blot and dot assays, apo H was able to bind
recombinant retroviral HIV antigens, especially Gag proteins p18 of HIV-1, p26 of
HIV-2, and Env gp160 of HIV-1. Binding was shown to be pH and NaCl dependent,
with an optimum at acidic pH and low ionic strength. Specificity was demonstrated
by saturation of this binding and inhibition either by homologous competition or 
by specific antisera. Binding was also observed in cell line-harvested viral
proteins. The mechanism of this apo H-polyspecific binding is discussed in
relation to conformational changes due to the influence of lipids or detergents.
