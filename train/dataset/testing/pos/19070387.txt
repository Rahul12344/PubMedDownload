BACKGROUND/AIMS: The hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) has been implicated as a
potential trigger of the epigenetic deregulation of some genes, but the
underlying mechanisms remain unknown. The aim of this study was to identify
underlying mechanisms involved in HBx-mediated epigenetic modification.
METHODS: Interactions between HBx and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) or histone
deacetylase-1 (HDAC1) were assessed by co-immunoprecipitation. DNA methylation of
gene promoters was detected by bisulfite sequencing, and HBx-mediated protein
binding to gene regulatory elements was evaluated by chromatin
immunoprecipitation. Target gene transcriptional activity was measured by
real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: HBx can interact directly with DNMT3A and HDAC1. HBx recruited DNMT3A to
the regulatory promoters of interleukin-4 receptor and metallothionein-1F and
subsequently silenced their transcription via de novo DNA methylation. By
contrast, the transcription of CDH6 and IGFBP3 was triggered by HBx through the
deprivation of DNMT3A from their promoters. Transcriptional levels of target
genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens were strongly correlated with
the occurrence of HBx.
CONCLUSIONS: The interaction of HBx and DNMT3A facilitates cellular epigenetic
modification (via regional hypermethylation or hypomethylation) at distinct
genomic loci, providing an alternative mechanism within HBx-mediated
transcriptional regulation, and a profound understanding of hepatitis and HCC
pathogenesis.
