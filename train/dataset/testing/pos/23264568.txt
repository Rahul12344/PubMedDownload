The primer for initiating reverse transcription in human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 (HIV-1) is tRNA(Lys3). Host cell tRNA(Lys) is selectively packaged into
HIV-1 through a specific interaction between the major tRNA(Lys)-binding protein,
human lysyl-tRNA synthetase (hLysRS), and the viral proteins Gag and GagPol.
Annealing of the tRNA primer onto the complementary primer-binding site (PBS) in 
viral RNA is mediated by the nucleocapsid domain of Gag. The mechanism by which
tRNA(Lys3) is targeted to the PBS and released from hLysRS prior to annealing is 
unknown. Here, we show that hLysRS specifically binds to a tRNA anti-codon-like
element (TLE) in the HIV-1 genome, which mimics the anti-codon loop of tRNA(Lys) 
and is located proximal to the PBS. Mutation of the U-rich sequence within the
TLE attenuates binding of hLysRS in vitro and reduces the amount of annealed
tRNA(Lys3) in virions. Thus, LysRS binds specifically to the TLE, which is part
of a larger LysRS binding domain in the viral RNA that includes elements of the
Psi packaging signal. Our results suggest that HIV-1 uses molecular mimicry of
the anti-codon of tRNA(Lys) to increase the efficiency of tRNA(Lys3) annealing to
viral RNA.
