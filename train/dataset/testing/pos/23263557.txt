The innate immune system senses viral DNA that enters mammalian cells, or in
aberrant situations self-DNA, and triggers type I interferon production. Here we 
present an integrative approach that combines quantitative proteomics, genomics
and small molecule perturbations to identify genes involved in this pathway. We
silenced 809 candidate genes, measured the response to dsDNA and connected
resulting hits with the known signaling network. We identified ABCF1 as a
critical protein that associates with dsDNA and the DNA-sensing components HMGB2 
and IFI204. We also found that CDC37 regulates the stability of the signaling
molecule TBK1 and that chemical inhibition of the CDC37-HSP90 interaction and
several other pathway regulators potently modulates the innate immune response to
DNA and retroviral infection.
