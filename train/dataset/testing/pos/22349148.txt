Recent research has shown that Coronavirus (CoV) replication depends on active
immunophilin pathways. Here we demonstrate that the drug FK506 (Tacrolimus)
inhibited strongly the growth of human coronaviruses SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and
HCoV-229E at low, non-cytotoxic concentrations in cell culture. As shown by
plaque titration, qPCR, Luciferase- and green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter 
gene expression, replication was diminished by several orders of magnitude.
Knockdown of the cellular FK506-binding proteins FKBP1A and FKBP1B in CaCo2 cells
prevented replication of HCoV-NL63, suggesting the requirement of these members
of the immunophilin family for virus growth.
