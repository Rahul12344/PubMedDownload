Specific regulatory nascent chains establish direct interactions with the
ribosomal tunnel, leading to translational stalling. Despite a wealth of
biochemical data, structural insight into the mechanism of translational stalling
in eukaryotes is still lacking. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to visualize
eukaryotic ribosomes stalled during the translation of two diverse regulatory
peptides: the fungal arginine attenuator peptide (AAP) and the human
cytomegalovirus (hCMV) gp48 upstream open reading frame 2 (uORF2). The C terminus
of the AAP appears to be compacted adjacent to the peptidyl transferase center
(PTC). Both nascent chains interact with ribosomal proteins L4 and L17 at tunnel 
constriction in a distinct fashion. Significant changes at the PTC were observed:
the eukaryotic-specific loop of ribosomal protein L10e establishes direct contact
with the CCA end of the peptidyl-tRNA (P-tRNA), which may be critical for
silencing of the PTC during translational stalling. Our findings provide direct
structural insight into two distinct eukaryotic stalling processes.
