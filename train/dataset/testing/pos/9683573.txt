We have cloned hTid-1, a human homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor protein
Tid56, by virtue of its ability to form complexes with the human papillomavirus
E7 oncoprotein. The carboxyl terminal cysteine-rich metal binding domain of E7 is
the major determinant for interaction with hTid-1. The carboxyl terminus of E7 is
essential for the functional and structural integrity of E7 and has previously
been shown to function as a multimerization domain. The hTid-1 protein is a
member of the DnaJ-family of chaperones. Its mRNA is widely expressed in human
tissues, including the HPV-18-positive cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa and
human genital keratinocytes, the normal host cells of the HPVs. The hTid-1 gene
has been mapped to the short arm of chromosome 16. The large tumor antigens of
polyomaviruses encode functional J-domains that are important for viral
replication as well as cellular transformation. The ability of HPV E7 to interact
with a cellular DnaJ protein suggests that these two viral oncoproteins may
target common regulatory pathways through J-domains.
