NS1 (nonstructural protein 1) is an important virulence factor of the influenza A
virus. We observed that NS1 proteins of the 1918 pandemic virus (A/Brevig
Mission/1/18) and many avian influenza A viruses contain a consensus Src homology
3 (SH3) domain-binding motif. Screening of a comprehensive human SH3 phage
library revealed the N-terminal SH3 of Crk and CrkL as the preferred binding
partners. Studies with recombinant proteins confirmed avid binding of NS1
proteins of the 1918 virus and a representative avian H7N3 strain to Crk/CrkL SH3
but not to other SH3 domains tested, including p85alpha and p85beta. Endogenous
CrkL readily co-precipitated NS1 from cells infected with the H7N3 virus. In
transfected cells association with CrkL was observed for NS1 of the 1918 and H7N3
viruses but not A/Udorn/72 or A/WSN/33 NS1 lacking this sequence motif. SH3
binding was dispensable for suppression of interferon-induced gene expression by 
NS1 but was associated with enhanced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling, as 
evidenced by increased Akt phosphorylation. Thus, the Spanish Flu virus resembles
avian influenza A viruses in its ability to recruit Crk/CrkL to modulate host
cell signaling.
