All human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) early mRNAs are polyadenylated at the
poly(A) signal within the early 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). The 3'end of the 
early E5 open reading frame and the 3'UTR of HPV-16 is very AU-rich, with five
regions similar to cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs). We show here that
a fragment of the early 3'end comprising four of the five CPE-like regions when
inserted downstream of a reporter gene confers regulation of the gene expression.
A key protein involved in cytoplasmic polyadenylation is CPEB. We show that the
human CPEB1 can repress the activity of the reporter construct containing the
HPV-16 early sequences. This repression can be counteracted by a human
cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase, hGLD-2 fused to CPEB1. The hGLD-2/CPEB1 fusion
protein facilitates furthermore poly(A) elongation of early HPV transcripts.
