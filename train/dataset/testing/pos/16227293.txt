Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 viral protein R (Vpr) is required for viral
pathogenesis and has been implicated in T-cell apoptosis through its activation
of caspase 3 and caspase 9 and perturbation of mitochondrial membrane potential. 
To understand better Vpr-mitochondria interaction, we report here the
identification of antiapoptotic mitochondrial protein HAX-1 as a novel Vpr
target. We show that Vpr and HAX-1 physically associate with each other.
Overexpression of Vpr in cells dislocates HAX-1 from its normal residence in
mitochondria and creates mitochondrion instability and cell death. Conversely,
overexpression of HAX-1 suppressed the proapoptotic activity of Vpr.
