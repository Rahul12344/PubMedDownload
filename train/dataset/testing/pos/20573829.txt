In a yeast two-hybrid screen for cellular factors that could interact with human 
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag protein, we identified PDZD8 and
confirmed the interaction by coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP). PDZD8 overexpression 
promoted the initiation of reverse transcription and increased infection by
pseudotyped retroviruses independent of the route of viral entry, while transient
knockdown of endogenous levels decreased HIV-1 infection. A mutant of PDZD8
lacking a predicted coiled-coil domain in its Gag-interacting region failed to
bind Gag and promote HIV-1 infection, identifying the domain of PDZD8 required
for mediating these effects. As such, we identify PDZD8 as a novel positive
mediator of retroviral infection.
