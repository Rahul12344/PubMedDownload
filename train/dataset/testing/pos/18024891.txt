Cellular mismatch and base-excision repair machineries have been shown to be
involved in Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) lytic DNA replication. We report here that
nucleotide-excision repair (NER) may also play an important role in EBV lytic DNA
replication. Firstly, the EBV BGLF4 kinase interacts with xeroderma pigmentosum C
(XPC), the critical DNA damage-recognition factor of NER, in yeast and in vitro, 
as demonstrated by yeast two-hybrid and glutathione S-transferase pull-down
assays. Simultaneously, XPC was shown, by indirect immunofluorescence and
co-immunoprecipitation assays, to interact and colocalize with BGLF4 in
EBV-positive NA cells undergoing lytic viral replication. In addition, the
efficiency of EBV DNA replication was reduced about 30-40 % by an XPC small
interfering RNA. Expression of BGLF4 enhances cellular DNA-repair activity in
p53-defective H1299/bcl2 cells in a host-cell reactivation assay. This
enhancement was not observed in the XPC-mutant cell line XP4PA-SV unless
complemented by ectopic XPC, suggesting that BGLF4 may stimulate DNA repair in an
XPC-dependent manner. Overall, we suggest that the interaction of BGLF4 and XPC
may be involved in DNA replication and repair and thereby enhance the efficiency 
of viral DNA replication.
