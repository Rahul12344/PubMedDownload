Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) is well known to be upregulated during
hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. The role of PI4 kinases in HCV has been
extensively investigated. Whether the PI4P phosphatase Sac1 is altered by HCV
remains unclear. Here, we identified ARFGAP1 to be a novel host factor for HCV
replication. We further show that Sac1 interacts with ARFGAP1 and inhibits HCV
replication. The elevation of PI4P induced by HCV NS5A is abrogated when the
coatomer protein I (COPI) pathway is inhibited. We also found an interaction
between NS5A and ARFGAP1. Furthermore, we identified a conserved cluster of
positively charged amino acids in NS5A critical for interaction between NS5A and 
ARFGAP1, induction of PI4P, and HCV replication. Our data demonstrate that
ARFGAP1 is a host factor for HCV RNA replication. ARFGAP1 is hijacked by HCV NS5A
to remove COPI cargo Sac1 from the site of HCV replication to maintain high
levels of PI4P. Our findings provide an additional mechanism by which HCV
enhances formation of a PI4P-rich environment.IMPORTANCE: PI4P is enriched in the
replication area of HCV; however, whether PI4P phosphatase Sac1 is subverted by
HCV is not established. The detailed mechanism of how COPI contributes to viral
replication remains unknown, though COPI components were hijacked by HCV. We
demonstrate that ARFGAP1 is hijacked by HCV NS5A to remove COPI cargo Sac1 from
the HCV replication area to maintain high-level PI4P generated by NS5A.
Furthermore, we identify a conserved cluster of positively charged amino acids in
NS5A, which are critical for interaction between NS5A and ARFGAP1, induction of
PI4P, and HCV replication. This study will shed mechanistic insight on how other 
RNA viruses hijack COPI and Sac1.
