Several herpesviruses contain open reading frames (ORFs) that encode potential
homologs of eucaryotic genes. Equine herpesvirus 2 (EHV-2) is a gammaherpesvirus 
related to other lymphotropic herpesviruses such as herpesvirus saimiri and
Epstein-Barr virus. The E1 ORF of EHV-2, a G protein-coupled receptor homolog,
shows 31 to 47% amino acid identity with known CC chemokine receptors. To
investigate whether E1 may encode a functional receptor, we cloned the E1 ORF and
expressed it in stably transfected cell lines. We report here the identification 
of the CC chemokine eotaxin as a functional ligand for the EHV-2 E1 receptor.
Chemokines are likely to play a role in the regulation of immune functions in
equine hosts during EHV-2 infection and, via interaction with E1, may affect
viral replication and/or escape from immune responses.
