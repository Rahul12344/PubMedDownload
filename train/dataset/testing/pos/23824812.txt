The interferon-inducible protein with tetratricopeptide (IFIT) family proteins
inhibit replication of some viruses by recognizing several types of RNAs,
including 5'-triphosphate RNA and 5' capped 2'-O unmethylated mRNA. However, it
remains unclear how IFITs inhibit replication of some viruses through recognition
of RNA. Here, we analyzed the mechanisms by which Ifit1 exerts antiviral
responses. Replication of a Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) 2'-O
methyltransferase (MTase) mutant was markedly enhanced in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts and macrophages lacking Ifit1. Ifit1 bound 5'-triphosphate RNA but
more preferentially associated with 5' capped 2'-O unmethylated mRNA. Ifit1
inhibited the translation of mRNA and thereby restricted the replication of JEV
mutated in 2'-O MTase. Thus, Ifit1 inhibits replication of MTase-defective JEV by
inhibiting mRNA translation through direct binding to mRNA 5' structures.
