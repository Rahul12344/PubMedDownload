In a previous study, infection with the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) was
shown to increase the sensitivity of the mammary epithelium toward prolactin
(PRL); furthermore, this effect could be mimicked by the binding of the MMTV
envelope protein (gp52) to its cell receptor. The present work has investigated
the possibility that gp52-induced changes in the PRL receptor (PRLR) were
responsible for this phenomenon. In vitro, gp52 doubled the PRLR concentration in
the plasmalemma of mammary epithelium without affecting the affinity. The origins
of these PRLRs were twofold: first, gp52 stimulated PRLR mRNA nearly fivefold,
suggesting that some of the receptors were newly synthesized. Second, there was a
redistribution of PRLRs within the mammary cell: PRLRs were shifted from an
internal pool to the plasma membrane. This relocation was very rapid, occurring
within 30 min. There did not appear to be any contribution from alterations in
PRLR degradation, since the half-life of PRLR was not affected by gp52. In
summary, the MMTV increases the PRL sensitivity of mouse mammary epithelium by
elevating PRLRs through both enhanced synthesis and recruitment from microsomes.
