The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transactivator protein, Tat, stimulates
transcription from the viral long terminal repeats via an arginine-rich
transactivating domain. Since arginines are often known to be methylated, we
investigated whether HIV type 1 (HIV-1) Tat was a substrate for known protein
arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs). Here we identify Tat as a substrate for the 
arginine methyltransferase, PRMT6. Tat is specifically associated with and
methylated by PRMT6 within cells. Overexpression of wild-type PRMT6, but not a
methylase-inactive PRMT6 mutant, decreased Tat transactivation of an HIV-1 long
terminal repeat luciferase reporter plasmid in a dose-dependent manner. Knocking 
down PRMT6 consistently increased HIV-1 production in HEK293T cells and also led 
to increased viral infectiousness as shown in multinuclear activation of a
galactosidase indicator assays. Our study demonstrates that arginine methylation 
of Tat negatively regulates its transactivation activity and that PRMT6 acts as a
restriction factor for HIV replication.
