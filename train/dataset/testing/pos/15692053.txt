Cytokine production plays a critical role in diseases caused by Kaposi's
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Here we show that a latent KSHV gene
product, kaposin B, increases the expression of cytokines by blocking the
degradation of their messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Cytokine transcripts are normally
unstable because they contain AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3' noncoding
regions that target them for degradation. Kaposin B reverses this instability by 
binding to and activating the kinase MK2, a target of the p38 mitogen-activated
protein kinase signaling pathway and a known inhibitor of ARE-mRNA decay. These
findings define an important mechanism linking latent KSHV infection to cytokine 
production, and also illustrate a distinctive mode by which viruses can
selectively modulate mRNA turnover.
