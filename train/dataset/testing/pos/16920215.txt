Alternate serotypes of adenovirus (Ad), including Ads of species B, are being
explored to circumvent the disadvantages of Ad serotype 5 gene delivery vectors. 
Whereas the majority of human Ads utilize the Coxsackievirus and adenovirus
receptor (CAR), none of the Ad species B use CAR. Ad species B is further divided
into two subspecies, B1 and B2, and utilizes at least two classes of receptors:
common Ad species B receptors and B2 specific receptors. CD46 has been implicated
as a B2-specific receptor. Ad serotype 3 (Ad3), a member of B1, utilizes CD80 and
CD86 as cellular attachment receptors. The receptor-interacting Ad fiber-knob
domain is highly homologous among species B Ads. We hypothesized that other
members of Ad species B may utilize CD80 and CD86 as cellular attachment
receptors. All tested species B members showed specific binding to cells
expressing CD80 and CD86, and the Ad fiber-knob domain from both B1 and B2 Ad
efficiently blocked CD80- and CD86-mediated infection of Ad3 vectors. Members of 
both B1 and B2 demonstrated CD80- and CD86-specific infection of CHO cells
expressing CD80 and CD86. Therefore, all of the members of Ad species B utilize
CD80 and CD86 for infection of cells.
