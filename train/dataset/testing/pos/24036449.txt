The inflammatory response mediated by the immune system is the major cause of
hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated liver injury. Here, we identified CD59, as a
novel HBc-interacting protein in hepatocytes by tandem affinity purification
(TAP) screening. The expression of CD59 was markedly down-regulated in
HBc-transfected HepG2 or HepG2.215 cells, which resulted in an upshift of
hepatocyte sensitivity to membrane attack complex (MAC)-induced cell lysis. These
results were consistent with the accumulation of MACs in the liver of
HBV-infected patients. Additional analyses using laser confocal microscopy,
quantitative PCR and flow cytometry revealed that CD59 was specifically
translocated to the nucleus upon binding to HBc, which induced the
down-regulation of CD59 on both the mRNA and protein levels.
