The bovine and human papillomavirus (BPV/HPV) E2 proteins bind specifically to
palindromic sequences ACCGN4CGGT that are concentrated within the viral long
control region, where they regulate viral oncogene transcription. E2 can activate
viral promoters over relatively large distances within the viral genome and was
shown to cooperate with a number of cellular transcription factors.
Transcriptional activator proteins, such as E2, are thought to act, at least in
part, by influencing the assembly and/or stability of preinitiation complexes and
it has been suggested that the transcription factor IID, composed by the
TATA-binding protein (TBP) and numerous TBP-associated factors (TAFs), is a
possible target of this important viral protein. In this paper, we demonstrate
that E2 proteins associate in vitro with several TAFs, in particular with
TAFII250 and TAFII80. In addition, we observed that the association of TAFII250
with BPV1 E2 is stronger than with HPV18 E2 and that the carboxy terminal domain 
of both viral proteins is involved in this interaction. On the other hand,
TAFII80 binds with similar strength to both E2 proteins through their amino
terminal region. These observations may help to explain the different behavior of
bovine and human E2 proteins, since BPV E2 is a stronger transcriptional
activator than HPV18 E2.
