Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute-phase protein induced by a variety of
inflammatory stimuli, including bacterial and viral infections. SAA was recently 
found to function as an opsonin for gram-negative bacteria. We report here that
SAA inhibited hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in cultured cells. SAA reduced
HCV infectivity in a dose-dependent manner when added during HCV infection but
not after virus entry. SAA bound HCV virions and specifically blocked HCV entry
but did not affect virus attachment. These findings suggest that SAA functions as
part of the host innate immune defense mechanisms against HCV infection in
humans.
