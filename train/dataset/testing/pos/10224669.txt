The related viruses herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV)
show distinct but related patterns of latent infection and reactivation in human 
sensory ganglia. The cellular POU family transcription factors Brn-3a and Brn-3b 
are expressed in sensory ganglia and bind to the TAATGARAT (R stands for purine) 
regulatory motifs in the immediate-early gene promoters of these viruses. We show
that Brn-3a activates the full length HSV IE1 promoter whereas Brn-3b represses
its activity. In contrast both Brn-3a and Brn-3b activate the full length VZV IE 
promoter. The response of the full length VZV promoter to Brn-3b is not observed 
with a minimal VZV immediate-early promoter lacking any TAATGARAT elements and
cannot be restored by addition of either the upstream TAATGARAT-containing region
of the HSV IE promoter or a VZV TAATGARAT-like element to this minimal promoter. 
The unique effect of Brn-3b on the full length VZV immediate early gene promoter 
may play a key role in the distinct pattern of latent infection and reactivation 
observed with this virus in vivo.
