Influenza A virus RNA replication requires an intricate regulatory network
involving viral and cellular proteins. In this study, we examined the roles of
cellular ubiquitinating/deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). We observed that
downregulation of a cellular deubiquitinating enzyme USP11 resulted in enhanced
virus production, suggesting that USP11 could inhibit influenza virus
replication. Conversely, overexpression of USP11 specifically inhibited viral
genomic RNA replication, and this inhibition required the deubiquitinase
activity. Furthermore, we showed that USP11 interacted with PB2, PA, and NP of
viral RNA replication complex, and that NP is a monoubiquitinated protein and can
be deubiquitinated by USP11 in vivo. Finally, we identified K184 as the
ubiquitination site on NP and this residue is crucial for virus RNA replication. 
We propose that ubiquitination/deubiquitination of NP can be manipulated for
antiviral therapeutic purposes.
