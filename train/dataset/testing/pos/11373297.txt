The Epstein-Barr virus-encoded early protein, BHRF1, is a structural and
functional homologue of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2. There is accumulating 
evidence that BHRF1 protects a variety of cell types from apoptosis induced by
various external stimuli. To identify specific proteins from normal epithelial
cells that interact with BHRF1 and that might promote or inhibit its
anti-apoptotic activity, we screened a yeast two-hybrid cDNA library derived from
human normal foreskin keratinocytes and identified a cellular gene encoding human
prenylated rab acceptor 1 (hPRA1). The interaction of hPRA1 with BHRF1 was
confirmed using glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, confocal laser
scanning microscopy, and co-immunoprecipitation. Two regions of PRA1, amino acids
30-53 and the carboxyl-terminal 21 residues, are important for BHRF1 interactions
and two regions of BHRF1, amino acids 1-18 and 89-142, including the Bcl-2
homology domains BH4 and BH1, respectively, are crucial for PRA1 interactions.
PRA1 expression interferes with the anti-apoptotic activity of BHRF1, although
not of Bcl-2. These results indicate that the PRA1 interacts selectively with
BHRF1 to reduce its anti-apoptotic activity and might play a role in the impeding
completion of virus maturation.
