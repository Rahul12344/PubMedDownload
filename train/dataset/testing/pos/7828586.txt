hepatitis B virus X protein and may play a role in X transactivation.

The X gene of human hepatitis B virus encodes the polypeptide HBx which
transactivates viral and host genes through a variety of cis-acting enhancer
elements present in RNA polymerases I, II and III promoters. To better understand
the mechanism of X transactivation, we cloned cDNAs of proteins that bind HBx.
Here we demonstrate that one of these cDNAs is a full-length cDNA of human RPB5, 
a subunit shared by RNA polymerases. The HBx transactivation domain and the
central region of human RPB5 were necessary for the specific binding of the two
proteins as shown by: (i) in vitro assays using deletion mutants of fusion
proteins; (ii) in vivo assays which detect associated proteins by
co-immunoprecipitation of the non-fused proteins from transfected HepG2 cells.
Over-expressed HBx seemed to associate with assembled forms of endogenous human
RPB5 in HBx-transfected cells, since the endogenous RPB5 co-immunoprecipitated
with HBx. The HBx binding region of human RPB5 by itself stimulated
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activities from several different reporters
having X-responsive element(s). Our results support the idea that the interaction
of HBx and human RPB5 can facilitate HBx transactivation and that human RPB5 has 
a domain which can communicate with transcriptional regulators.
