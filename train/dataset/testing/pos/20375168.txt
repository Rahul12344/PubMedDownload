Either ZEB1 or ZEB2/SIP1 can play a central role in regulating the Epstein-Barr
virus latent-lytic switch in a cell-type-specific manner.

We previously reported that the cellular protein ZEB1 can repress expression of
the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BZLF1 gene in transient transfection assays by
directly binding its promoter, Zp. We also reported that EBV containing a 2-bp
substitution mutation in the ZEB-binding ZV element of Zp spontaneously
reactivated out of latency into lytic replication at a higher frequency than did 
wild-type EBV. Here, using small interfering RNA (siRNA) and short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) technologies, we definitively show that ZEB1 is, indeed, a key player in 
maintaining EBV latency in some epithelial and B-lymphocytic cell lines. However,
in other EBV-positive epithelial and B-cell lines, another zinc finger
E-box-binding protein, ZEB2/SIP1, is the key player. Both ZEB1 and ZEB2 can bind 
Zp via the ZV element. In EBV-positive cells containing only ZEB1, knockdown of
ZEB1 led to viral reactivation out of latency, with synthesis of EBV
immediate-early and early lytic gene products. However, in EBV-positive cells
containing both ZEBs, ZEB2, not ZEB1, was the primary ZEB family member bound to 
Zp. Knockdown of ZEB2, but not ZEB1, led to EBV lytic reactivation. Thus, we
conclude that either ZEB1 or ZEB2 can play a central role in the maintenance of
EBV latency, doing so in a cell-type-dependent manner.
