Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is associated with severe neurological disorders in
children, and has been implicated as the infectious agent in several large-scale 
outbreaks with mortalities. Upon infection, the viral RNA is translated in a
cap-independent manner to yield a large polyprotein precursor. This mechanism
relies on the presence of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element within
the 5'-untranslated region. Virus-host interactions in EV71-infected cells are
crucial in assisting this process. We identified a novel positive IRES
trans-acting factor, far upstream element binding protein 1 (FBP1). Using binding
assays, we mapped the RNA determinants within the EV71 IRES responsible for FBP1 
binding and mapped the protein domains involved in this interaction. We also
demonstrated that during EV71 infection, the nuclear protein FBP1 is enriched in 
cytoplasm where viral replication occurs. Moreover, we showed that FBP1 acts as a
positive regulator of EV71 replication by competing with negative ITAF for EV71
IRES binding. These new findings may provide a route to new anti-viral therapy.
