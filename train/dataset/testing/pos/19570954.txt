Interaction studies have suggested that the non-structural protein encoded by
open reading frame 3 (ORF3) of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) binds
specifically to a regulator of G protein signalling (RGS) related to human RGS16 
(huRGS16). The full-length clone of RGS16 was generated from porcine cells and
sequence analysis revealed a close relationship to huRGS16 and murine RGS16. In
vitro pull-down experiments verified an interaction between porcine RGS16
(poRGS16) and ORF3 from PCV2. Using GST-linked ORF3 proteins from three different
genogroups of PCV2 and from porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) in the pull-down
experiments indicated that there were differences in their ability to bind
poRGS16. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that the expression of poRGS16 mRNA
could be induced by a number of cell activators including mitogens (LPS and PHA),
interferon inducers (ODN 2216 and poly I : C) and the neurotransmitter
norepinephrine. Immunofluorescence labelling confirmed the induced expression of 
poRGS16 at the protein level and suggested that the PCV2 ORF3 protein
co-localized with poRGS16 in LPS-activated porcine PBMC. Furthermore, poRGS16
appeared to participate in the translocation of the ORF3 protein into the cell
nucleus, suggesting that the observed interaction may play an important role in
the infection biology of porcine circovirus.
