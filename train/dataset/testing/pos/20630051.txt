HSV-1 viral capsid maturation and egress from the nucleus constitutes a
self-controlled process of interactions between host cytoplasmic membrane
proteins and viral capsid proteins. In this study, a member of the tetraspanin
superfamily, CTMP-7, was shown to physically interact with HSV-1 protein VP26,
and the VP26-CTMP-7 complex was detected both in vivo and in vitro. The
interaction of VP26 with CTMP-7 plays an essential role in normal HSV-1
replication. Additionally, analysis of a recombinant virus HSV-1-UG showed that
mutating VP26 resulted in a decreased viral replication rate and in aggregation
of viral mutant capsids in the nucleus. Together, our data support the notion
that biological events mediated by a VP26 - CTMP-7 interaction aid in viral
capsid enveloping and egress from the cell during the HSV-1 infectious process.
