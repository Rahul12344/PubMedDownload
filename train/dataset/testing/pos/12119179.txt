Focal adhesion plaques were severely affected in human embryonic fibroblasts
permeabilized with digitonin and incubated in buffer containing the human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease (HIV-1 PR). A mutant HIV-1 PR (3271 HIV-1 
PR) had no effect on focal adhesion plaques. Similar effects were seen with cells
microinjected with either HIV-1 PR or 3271 HIV-1 PR. Immunoblots of the human
embryonic fibroblasts demonstrated that a number of focal adhesion plaque
proteins were specifically cleaved by HIV-1 PR. These included fimbrin, focal
adhesion plaque kinase (FAK), talin, and, to a lesser extent, filamin, spectrin
and fibronectin. Proteins detected by antibodies to beta 4 integrin and alpha 3
integrin were also cleaved by the HIV-1 PR. Control experiments demonstrated that
the effect and protein cleavages described are due to action of the HIV-1 PR and 
not to the action of endogenous host cell proteases.
