Little is known about host factors necessary for retroviral virion assembly or
uncoating. We have previously shown that the principal structural protein of the 
human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1, the Gag polyprotein, binds the cyclophilin
peptidyl-prolyl isomerases; cyclophilins catalyse a rate-limiting step in protein
folding and protect cells from heat shock. Here we demonstrate that cyclophilin A
is specifically incorporated into HIV-1 virions but not into virions of other
primate immunodeficiency viruses. A proline-rich region conserved in all HIV-1
Gag polyproteins is required for cyclophilin A binding and incorporation.
Disruption of a single proline blocks the Gag-cyclophilin interaction in vitro,
prevents cyclophilin A incorporation into virions, and inhibits HIV-1
replication. Our results indicate that the interaction of Gag with cyclophilin A 
is necessary for the formation of infectious HIV-1 virions.
