The vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G) is a model transmembrane
glycoprotein that has been extensively used to study the exocytotic pathway. The 
cytoplasmic domain of VSV G contains information for several intracellular
sorting steps including efficient export from the ER, basolateral delivery, and
endocytosis. In order to identify proteins that potentially interact with the
polypeptide sorting motifs in the VSV G tail, the carboxy-terminal 27 amino acids
of VSV G were used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system. The protein identified
most frequently in the screen is a novel protein of 38 kDa, p38. In the present
work, the initial molecular and biochemical characterization of p38 is described.
Preliminary evidence suggests that p38 may interact transiently with endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) membranes, and thus may affect VSV G and other cargo movement at
the step of ER to Golgi traffic.
