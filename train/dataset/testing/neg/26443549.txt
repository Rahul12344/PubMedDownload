A library of 64 benzotriazole derivatives (17 of which were
[4-(benzotriazol-2-yl)phenoxy]alkanoic acids) were screened for antiviral
activity against a panel of twelve DNA and RNA viruses. Twenty-six compounds (12 
of which were [4-(benzotriazol-2-yl)phenoxy]alkanoic acids) displayed activity
against one or more viruses. CVB-5, RSV, BVDV, Sb-1 and YFV were, in decreasing
order, the more frequently and effectively affected viruses; DENV-2, WNV, HIV-1
and Reo-1 were only occasionally and modestly affected, while the remaining
viruses were not affected by any of the tested compounds. Worth of note were
compounds 33 and 35; the former for the activity against Sb-1 (EC50=7 μM) and the
latter for the large spectrum of activity including six viruses with a mean
EC50=12 μM. Even more interesting were the alkanoic acids 45-48 and 50-57 for
their activity against RSV and/or CVB-5. In particular, compound 56 displayed a
potent and selective activity against CVB-5 with EC50=0.15 μM and SI=100, thus
representing a valuable hit compound for the development of antiviral agents for 
the treatment of human pathologies related to this virus.
