Newcastle disease virus (NDV) causes an economically important disease that can
vary from clinically inapparent to highly virulent forms. Generally, NDV strains 
isolated from wild birds are non-pathogenic for chicken. However, there are
evidences supporting the fact that avirulent viruses maintained in feral birds
could have caused outbreaks of virulent NDV in poultry. The strain-specific
difference in virulence is determined by structural variations on the fusion
glycoprotein (F). More basic amino acids are present in the F cleavage site of
virulent strains. Nevertheless, other regions have been involved in virulence
determination. When we subjected an avirulent NDV isolated from a wild bird to a 
host change we found that the virus arose was virulent for chicken. Nucleotide
changes in the F protein cleavage site amino acid sequence and in the
hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein sequence are reported.
