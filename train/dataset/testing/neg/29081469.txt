Environmental DNA analysis for micro- and macro-organisms is rapidly developing. 
Environmental DNA means total DNA present in environmental media such as water or
soil, and includes DNA contained in the organisms themselves and extra-organism
DNA of macro-organisms. Analysis of environmental DNA can be divided into two
methods, species-specific detection and meta-barcoding, which can be used
according to each purpose. Applicable subjects are all organisms (including
viruses in this case) with DNA as genes, and application to rivers, ponds, lakes 
and marines has been reported. In this paper, the present situation of
environmental DNA analysis of macro organisms is described, and the possibility
of application to infectious disease studies and the problems to be solved are
discussed.
