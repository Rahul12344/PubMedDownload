Insect baculoviruses: powerful gene expression vectors.

Miller LK.

Baculovirus vectors have proven useful in producing high levels of biologically
active eukaryotic proteins and providing cellular fractions which are enriched in
the protein of interest. Expression occurs in infected insect cells which also
provide a suitable environment for post-translational modification and folding of
the protein product. Stable baculovirus vectors can be constructed rapidly with a
minimum of viral manipulation.
