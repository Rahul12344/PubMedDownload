The aim of this study was to examine whether it is possible to predict the
presence of persistently infected (PI) animals with bovine viral diarrhoea virus 
on dairy farms in The Netherlands, based on a few blood samples of the herd,
possibly in combination with a bulk milk test for antibodies. In 25 herds with,
and 24 herds without, PI animal(s) the probabilities of obtaining at least x
antibody positive animals out of a sample of n animals were calculated, with n
varying from 3 to 7 and values for x that were considered were n, n - 1 to n - x.
This probability, among animals 9-24 months old, ranged from 0.70 to 0.96 for
herds with PI animals and from 0.13 to 0.37 for herds without. Using the result
of bulk milk testing in addition did not add to the prediction. It was concluded 
that, due to the high percentage and large variation of antibody positive animals
in herds without PI animals, it is not possible to predict the presence of PI
animal(s) in dairy herds in The Netherlands using these methods.
