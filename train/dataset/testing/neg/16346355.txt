Characterization of the proteins and nucleic acid of the gypsy moth nuclear
polyhedrosis virus isolated in Ithaca, N.Y. (LdNPV-IT) is presented. A total of
29 viral structural proteins were identified by sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis when the virus was isolated in the
absence of alkaline protease activity. Fourteen surface envelope viral proteins
were identified by lactoperoxidase iodination. Eleven proteins were associated
with nucleocapsids prepared by Nonidet P-40 detergent treatment. Distinct
alterations of viral proteins were documented when virions were purified in the
presence of occlusion body-associated alkaline protease(s). Restriction enzyme
digests of viral DNA indicated that this isolate was composed of a large number
of genetic variants. On the basis of the major molar fragments resulting from
EcoRI, BamHI, BglII, and HindIII digests, the molecular weight of the LdNPV
genome was approximately 88 x 10.
