Basis for variable response of arboviruses to guanidine treatment.

Friedman RM.

The effect of guanidine on the replication of the group A arboviruses, Sindbis
virus, and Semliki Forest virus (SFV) was studied. Guanidine rapidly, but
reversibly, inhibited SFV ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis. The synthesis of all 
species of viral RNA was inhibited, but that of ribonuclease-resistant forms was 
least affected. This inhibition occurred when the drug was added at any point
during the log phase of virus growth. The growth of SFV was also markedly
inhibited, but Sindbis virus growth was unimpaired. Infection of
guanidine-treated cells with the viruses together resulted in a significant
inhibition of the yields of both. It appears that, in the case of Sindbis virus, 
viral RNA is ordinarily produced in such excess that inhibition of its synthesis 
does not reduce virus yields. In the case of SFV, guanidine also markedly
distorts the pattern of RNA synthesis by greatly decreasing the production of the
26S interjacent RNA form. This may account for the observed inhibition of SFV
growth in the presence of guanidine.
