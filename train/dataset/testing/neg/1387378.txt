Chimeric proteins between Escherichia coli histone-like HU and IHF were
constructed by genetic engineering, in which part of the arm region was replaced 
by the corresponding region of IHF alpha (designated as HupANhimA) or IHF beta
(HupANhimD); alternatively, an alpha-helix 2-beta 1 region was replaced by the
corresponding region of IHF alpha (HupAXhimA) or IHF beta (HupAXhimD) (symbols N 
and X indicate NotI and XhoI junctions). These proteins were synthesized in a
hupA-hupB double-deletion mutant. HupANhimA exhibited marked reduction in
nonspecific DNA binding in vitro, and a drastic loss of HU activity in
replicative transposition of Mu phage in vivo. HupANhimD also showed a
significant reduction in the ability for DNA binding, though this protein
supported Mu phage development. In contrast, the other two chimeric HU proteins
showed only slight changes in nonspecific DNA-binding ability: they retained
activities for transposition of Mu phage in vivo. These observations confirm that
the flexible arm of HU-2, a domain proposed for DNA binding [Tanaka et al.,
Nature 310 (1984) 376-381; Goshima et al., Gene 96 (1990) 141-145], plays an
important role in the physiological function of this protein. The results
indicate that a unique conformation of the arm structure of HU protein,
particularly the N-terminal half of a two-strand antiparallel beta-ribbon of the 
structure, is important for the DNA-binding ability of this protein.
