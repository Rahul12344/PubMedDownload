Dissociation of antiviral and antitumor immunity in resistance to Marek's
disease.

Powell PC, Rowell JG.

Immunization of chickens either with gluteral-dehyde-inactivated chicken kidney
cells infected with Marek's disease (MD) virus or with glutaraldehyde-inactivated
cells of MD lymphoma-derived continuous lymphoblastoid cell lines protected
against MD. The former type of immunity was associated with an immunologic
suppression of virus replication and virus antigen production after challenge
with virulent virus, but lymphocytes specifically cytotoxic to cells bearing MD
tumor antigens were not detected. In the latter type of immunity, virus
multiplication was not affected; some evidence of the stimulation of
cell-mediated antitumor immunity was found. The results supported the view that
immunity to MD may be directed against either virus-specific or tumor-specific
antigens and that in natural resistance to MD both mechanisms may be operative.
