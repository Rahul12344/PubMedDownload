Viral infections of the central nervous system often result in a spectrum of
movement disorders, ranging from slowness and rigidity to hyperkinetic movements 
such as chorea, ballism, dystonia, and myoclonus. The basal ganglia are
especially susceptible to some viruses, because of their intrinsic neurotropism, 
a predilection of opportunistic infections for the deep gray matter of the brain,
and possibly the mounting of an autoimmune response against basal ganglia
antigens. Viral encephalitides reviewed here include those caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus, influenza A virus, the Flavivirus family (such as West
Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus), and herpes simplex. Hyperkinetic
movement disorders associated with prion diseases will also be discussed. The
clinical features, etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of the
underlying infections and ensuing movement disorders will be reviewed.
