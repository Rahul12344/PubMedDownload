We conducted phylogenetic and epidemiologic analyses to determine sources of
outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV), subtype H5N1, in
poultry holdings in 2007 in Germany, and a suspected incursion of HPAIV into the 
food chain through contaminated deep-frozen duck carcasses. In summer 2007, HPAIV
(H5N1) outbreaks in 3 poultry holdings in Germany were temporally, spatially, and
phylogenetically linked to outbreaks in wild aquatic birds. Detection of HPAIV
(H5N1) in frozen duck carcass samples of retained slaughter batches of 1 farm
indicated that silent infection had occurred for some time before the incidental 
detection. Phylogenetic analysis established a direct epidemiologic link between 
HPAIV isolated from duck meat and strains isolated from 3 further outbreaks in
December 2007 in backyard chickens that had access to uncooked offal from
commercial deep-frozen duck carcasses. Measures that will prevent such undetected
introduction of HPAIV (H5N1) into the food chain are urgently required.
