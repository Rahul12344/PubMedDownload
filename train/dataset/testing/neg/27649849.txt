Although microtubules (MTs) are known to have important roles in intracellular
transport of many viruses, a number of reports suggest that specific viral
MT-associated proteins (MAPs) target MTs to subvert distinct MT-dependent
cellular processes. The precise functional importance of these interactions and
their roles in pathogenesis, however, remain largely unresolved. To assess the
association with disease of the rabies virus (RABV) MAP, P3, we quantitatively
compared the phenotypes of P3 from a pathogenic RABV strain, Nishigahara (Ni) and
a non-pathogenic Ni-derivative strain, Ni-CE. Using confocal/live-cell imaging
and dSTORM super-resolution microscopy to quantify protein interactions with the 
MT network and with individual MT filaments, we found that the interaction by
Ni-CE-P3 is significantly impaired compared with Ni-P3. This correlated with an
impaired capacity to effect association of the transcription factor STAT1 with
MTs and to antagonize interferon (IFN)/STAT1-dependent antiviral signaling.
Importantly, we identified a single mutation in Ni-CE-P3 that is sufficient to
inhibit MT-association and IFN-antagonist function of Ni-P3, and showed that this
mutation alone attenuates the pathogenicity of RABV. These data provide evidence 
that the viral protein-MT interface has important roles in pathogenesis,
suggesting that this interface could provide targets for vaccine/antiviral drug
development.
