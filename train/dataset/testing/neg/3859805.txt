Chronic oral herpes simplex virus infection in immunocompromised patients.

Cohen SG, Greenberg MS.

Recurrent herpes simplex virus infection is usually benign and self-limiting, but
in immunosuppressed patients it can be a chronic destructive process. Eight
patients with chronic aggressive herpes simplex virus infection of the oral
mucosa are described. All cases occurred in immunocompromised patients. The
distinctive clinical presentation of the oral lesions, the diagnosis, and
treatment are discussed.
