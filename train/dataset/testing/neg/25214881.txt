Viruses, such as HIV, hepatitis A, poliovirus, coxsackievirus B3 and
foot-and-mouth disease virus, use a variety of mechanisms to suppress the human
immune system in order to evade clearance by the host. Therefore, investigating
how a few changes in the viral genome of a nonlethal virus can lead to an
alteration in disease, from survivable to immunosuppression and death, would
provide valuable information into viral pathogenesis. In addition, we propose
that gaining a better insight into how these viruses suppress an antiviral immune
response could lead to viral-based therapeutics to combat specifc autoimmune
diseases such as multiple sclerosis and Type 1 diabetes.
