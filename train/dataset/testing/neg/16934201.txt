HIV, hepatitis C virus, and hepatitis B virus are global health concerns. Due to 
shared routes of transmission, coinfection is common. The incidence of
liver-related mortality in coinfected patients has risen significantly since the 
inception of highly active antiretroviral therapy, a treatment that has helped
decreased mortality rates from AIDS and opportunistic infections. This trend has 
led to increased research into the evaluation and management of the coinfected
patient. This article details the principles of successful management of this
challenging patient population.
