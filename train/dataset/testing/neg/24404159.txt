BACKGROUND: In this study, we aim to identify key climatic factors that are
associated with the transmission of Japanese encephalitis virus in areas located 
near the Three Gorges Dam, between 1997 and 2008.
METHODS: We identified three geographical regions of Chongqing, based on their
distance from the Three Gorges Dam. Collectively, the three regions consisted of 
12 districts from which study information was collected. Zero-Inflated Poisson
Regression models were run to identify key climatic factors of the transmission
of Japanese encephalitis virus for both the whole study area and for each
individual region; linear regression models were conducted to examine the
fluctuation of climatic variables over time during the construction of the Three 
Gorges Dam.
RESULTS: Between 1997 and 2008, the incidence of Japanese encephalitis decreased 
throughout the entire city of Chongqing, with noticeable variations taking place 
in 2000, 2001 and 2006. The eastern region, which is closest to the Three Gorges 
Dam, suffered the highest incidence of Japanese encephalitis, while the western
region experienced the lowest incidence. Linear regression models revealed that
there were seasonal fluctuations of climatic variables during this period.
Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression models indicated a significant positive
association between temperature (with a lag of 1 and 3 months) and Japanese
encephalitis incidence, and a significant negative association between rainfall
(with a lag of 0 and 4 months) and Japanese encephalitis incidence.
CONCLUSION: The spatial and temporal trends of Japanese encephalitis incidence
that occurred in the City of Chongqing were associated with temperature and
rainfall. Seasonal fluctuations of climatic variables during this period were
also observed. Additional studies that focus on long-term data collection are
needed to validate the findings of this study and to further explore the effects 
of the Three Gorges Dam on Japanese encephalitis and other related diseases.
