Rotaviruses are a major cause of severe diarrhea in children <5 years of age
worldwide. The rotavirus positivity rate in Iran was 15.3% to 67.6% in all
patients <5 years of age hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis, which was
significantly higher than recorded in outpatient departments. Moreover, the most 
commonly detected genotype was G1P[8], although in a single study a peak
prevalence of the G4P[8] genotype was reported.
