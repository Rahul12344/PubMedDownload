Canine parvovirus (CPV) is an important disease causing gastroenteritis and/or
haemorrhagic gastroenteritis in dogs. There are four antigenic types of CPV
reported worldwide viz. CPV 2, CPV 2a, CPV 2b and CPV 2c. The diagnosis of CPV
with the identification of the antigen type responsible remains problematic. In
the present study, identification as well as antigenic typing of CPV was done
using a de novo multiplex real time PCR to combat the problem of antigenic type
identification. From the study it could be concluded that the here developed
multiplex real time PCR assay could be used for rapid detection of CPV as well as
typing of its three antigenic types.
