Data from animal models indicate that interleukin-2 is potentially valuable in
the treatment of a variety of infectious diseases of viral, fungal, protozoal,
bacterial, and mycobacterial origin. The role of interleukin-2 in resistance to
infection with human immunodeficiency virus or Mycobacterium leprae (the
causative agent of leprosy) has recently been studied in detail. Data from animal
models and clinical trials indicate that relatively low doses of interleukin-2
effectively stabilize or reverse the course of these infections. The recent
characterization of Th1 and Th2 helper T cells, and their relationship to the
control of infectious diseases, are revealing the mechanisms involved in
producing disease. Increased understanding of these mechanisms may help extend
interleukin-2 therapy to other clinical applications.
