Differential reactivity of human serums with early antigens induced by
Epstein-Barr virus.

Henle W, Henle G, Zajac BA, Pearson G, Waubke R, Scriba M.

Inoculation of 64-10 or Raji cultures with Epstein-Barr virus derived from the
HRI-K clone of the P3J Burkitt's lymphoma line caused abortive infections in most
of the lymphoblastoid cells with synthesis of "early antigens" but few, if any,
capsids. Antibodies to early antigens were detected by indirect
immunofluorescence in serums of many patients with infectious mononucleosis,
Burkitt's lymphoma, or nasopharyngeal carcinoma. These antibodies were rarely
present in other serums even though some of them showed high titers of antibodies
to Epstein-Barr virus when assayed on EB3 Burkitt tumor cells; they also
prevented synthesis of early antigens, provided the serums were mixed with the
virus prior to inoculation. Antibodies to early antigens possibly reflect current
or recent disease processes that are associated with the virus.
