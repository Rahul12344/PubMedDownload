A reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) for detection 
of hepatitis E virus (HEV) RNA in serum was established using two pairs of
oligonucleotide acid from open reading frame 1 and 2 (ORF1 and ORF2) of HEV cDNA 
as the inner and outer primers. Eleven serial sera from two rhesus monkeys
experimentally infected with HEV were tested for HEV RNA with established
RT-nPCR. HEV RNA became detectable in these two monkeys on the sixth day and the 
ninth day, respectively, and persisted up to the 17th and the 22nd day after
infection, respectively. Twenty-eight serum specimens of the 41 patients with
acute sporadic hepatitis E were HEV RNA positive (68.3%). Proportions of positive
HEV RNA in patients sera collected one to ten days, 11 to 20 days and 21 to 34
days after their onset of the disease were 72.7% (16/22), 70.0% (7/10) and 55.5% 
(5/9), respectively. It suggests that viremia of HEV lasts a shorter period, and 
proportion of serum positive HEV RNA decreases with the course of the disease.
