[Therapy proposals for the quarantine of African green monkeys (Cercopithecus
aethiops)].

[Article in German]

Abel C, Eppler R, Hlinak P, Weigand G.

Attenuated live virus vaccines are usually tested in vivo for neurovirulent
properties by using African green monkeys. This report describes the health
condition of animals that have been imported from Ethiopia. The monkeys were
strongly malnourished when they arrived at the institute. One animal died during 
the shipment. In spite of many diagnostic and therapeutic efforts only 14 of 29
monkeys survived the 120-day-quarantine. Most animals died of infections of the
respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts within 4 weeks after arrival.
