Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is common across the world, especially in Asia,
Africa, Southern Europe, and Latin America. The association of HBV infection in
patients suffering from different oncological conditions is well established.
Many cases of HBV reactivation have been reported in patients on
immunosuppressive chemotherapy and in patients undergoing hematopoietic bone
marrow transplantations. Only one case has been reported so far of HBV
reactivation in a patient treated with programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1)
checkpoint inhibitors in the setting of HIV status. We report a case of a
51-year-old male, former smoker, diagnosed with stage IV poorly differentiated
adenocarcinoma of the lung, and started on pembrolizumab, who developed
reactivation of chronic hepatitis requiring antiviral therapy.
