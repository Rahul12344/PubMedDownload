We describe a child with congenital hypogammaglobulinemia that was diagnosed at
13 months of age. When he was 4 years old, gait disturbances began. The main
neurological manifestations were progressive spastic tetraparesis and
intellectual and speech deterioration. No infectious agent was identified. A
magnetic resonance imaging scan of the central nervous system revealed
periventricular demyelinating areas in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes 
with cortical atrophy. Stereotactic brain biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy caused by JC virus. He was treated
with intravenous and intraventricular cytarabine and interferon-alpha, and there 
was clinical improvement. We emphasize the need for brain biopsy as soon as a
neurological complication is suspected in patients with congenital
hypogammaglobulinemia for whom cerebrospinal cultures or polymerase chain
reaction analyses are negative.
