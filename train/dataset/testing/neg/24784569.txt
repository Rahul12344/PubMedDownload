The recent discovery of genetically distinct hantaviruses in multiple species of 
shrews and moles prompted a further exploration of their host diversification by 
analyzing frozen, ethanol-fixed and RNAlater®-preserved archival tissues and
fecal samples from 533 bats (representing seven families, 28 genera and 53
species in the order Chiroptera), captured in Asia, Africa and the Americas in
1981-2012, using RT-PCR. Hantavirus RNA was detected in Pomona roundleaf bats
(Hipposideros pomona) (family Hipposideridae), captured in Vietnam in 1997 and
1999, and in banana pipistrelles (Neoromicia nanus) (family Vespertilionidae),
captured in Côte d'Ivoire in 2011. Phylogenetic analysis, based on the
full-length S- and partial M- and L-segment sequences using maximum likelihood
and Bayesian methods, demonstrated that the newfound hantaviruses formed highly
divergent lineages, comprising other recently recognized bat-borne hantaviruses
in Sierra Leone and China. The detection of bat-associated hantaviruses opens a
new era in hantavirology and provides insights into their evolutionary origins.
