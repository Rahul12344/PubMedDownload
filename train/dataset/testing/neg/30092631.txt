Viral protein cages, with their regular and programmable architectures, are
excellent platforms for the development of functional nanomaterials. The ability 
to transform a virus into a material with intended structure and function relies 
on the existence of a well-understood model system, a noninfectious virus-like
particle (VLP) counterpart. Here, we study the factors important to the ability
of P22 VLP to retain or release various protein cargo molecules depending on the 
nature of the cargo, the capsid morphology, and the environmental conditions.
Because the interaction between the internalized scaffold protein (SP) and the
capsid coat protein (CP) is noncovalent, we have studied the efficiency with
which a range of SP variants can dissociate from the interior of different P22
VLP morphologies and exit by traversing the porous capsid. Understanding the
types of cargos that are either retained or released from the P22 VLP will aid in
the rational design of functional nanomaterials.
