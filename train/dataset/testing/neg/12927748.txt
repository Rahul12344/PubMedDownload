BACKGROUND: We report an interlaboratory comparison of methods for the
determination of hepatitis C virus (HCV) serum load and genotype between a
recently, established molecular laboratory at the Alaska Native Medical Center
(ANMC) and two independent laboratories using different assays. At ANMC, a
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR amplification methodology (QPCR) has been developed
in which HCV viral loads are determined by interpolation of QPCR results to those
of standards calibrated to the World Health Organization (WHO) First
International Standard for HCV. HCV genotype is subsequently determined by direct
sequencing of the DNA fragment generated from the QPCR assay.
OBJECTIVES AND STUDY DESIGN: The above methods were statistically compared to
results obtained for the same patient sera by two independent laboratories using 
different commercially available viral load assays; Quantiplex HCV RNA (Bayer
Diagnostics) and Amplicor HCV Monitor (v 2.0) (Roche Molecular Systems), as well 
as two different genotyping assays; restriction fragment length polymorphism
(RFLP) and INNO-LiPA HCV II (Innogenetics).
RESULTS: ANMC's Real-time QPCR HCV viral load results compared moderately well
with those obtained by the Quantiplex HCV RNA method (R2=0.3813), and compared
quite well with recent lot numbers of Amplicor HCV Monitor in which viral loads
are derived in IU/ml (R2=0.6408), but compared poorly with earlier lot numbers of
Amplicor HCV Monitor in which viral loads were derived in copies/ml (R2=0.0913). 
The ANMC direct sequencing method for genotype determination compared moderately 
to very well with both the RFLP (84-86%) and INNO-LiPA (85-97.5%) methods.
CONCLUSIONS: These viral load comparisons highlight the discrepancies that may
occur when patient HCV viral loads are monitored using different types of assays.
Comparison of HCV genotype by different methods is more reliable statistically
and important clinically for predicting probability of response to antiviral
therapy. However, viral loads are important for monitoring response once therapy 
has begun.
