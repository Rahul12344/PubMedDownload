[The role of genes of the system of mismatched base correction in genetic
recombination of Escherichia coli].

Karimova GA, Grigor'ev PS, Rybchin VN.

A genetic system was elaborated to study intramolecular recombination of
bacteriophages lambda and phi 80. Practically, the ideal complementation of
nucleotide sequences in recombining DNA molecules is required to obtain
recombinants resulting from RecA-dependent recombination in Escherichia coli
cells. a hypothesis is proposed to which the correction of mismatched bases
hinders recombinant formation during recombination of fully homologous DNAs. The 
increased yields of hybrid molecules during interaction of the same DNA in the
cells with deficient genes for correction support the hypothesis as well as
independent demonstration of mutation in a gene for correction according to the
effect of the increased yield of recombinants. A series of Escherichia coli cells
mutants with increased formation of recombinant clones has been obtained.
