Two distinct spherical virus-like particles were purified from the brown
planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens. One was a geographical isolate of Himetobi P
virus (Cripavirus, Dicistroviridae). The other was 30 nm in diameter and
contained positive-stranded RNA. The RNA was 1647 nucleotides in length and
encoded only its own capsid protein, indicating that this particle is a satellite
virus. Transmission tests showed that the satellite was transmitted vertically;
however, its helper virus was unknown. We named this satellite Nilaparvata lugens
commensal X virus (NLCXV).
