Vertebrates mount a strong innate immune response against viruses, largely by
activating the interferon system. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a common
intermediate formed during the life cycle of many viruses, is a potent trigger of
this response. In contrast, no general inducible antiviral defense mechanism has 
been reported in any invertebrate. Here we show that dsRNA induces antiviral
protection in the marine crustacean Litopenaeus vannamei. When treated with
dsRNA, shrimp showed increased resistance to infection by two unrelated viruses, 
white spot syndrome virus and Taura syndrome virus. Induction of this antiviral
state is independent of the sequence of the dsRNA used and therefore distinct
from the sequence-specific dsRNA-mediated genetic interference phenomenon. This
demonstrates for the first time that an invertebrate immune system, like its
vertebrate counterparts, can recognize dsRNA as a virus-associated molecular
pattern, resulting in the activation of an innate antiviral response.
