The diagnosis of enzootic bovine leukosis.

Mammerickx M, Portetelle D, Burny A.

This paper reviews the clinical and virological diagnostic procedures for
enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL). The clinical diagnosis must be always confirmed
by a specific laboratory test for Bovine Leukaemia Virus (BLV). Many virological 
tests were proposed. The sensitivity of all the diagnostic methods is sufficient 
to do an early detection of a BLV infection on an individual base. Advantages of 
the highly sensitive methods like RIA and ELISA appear when the samples to be
tested have naturally very low antibody titers (individual milk, bulk milk,
pooled sera).
