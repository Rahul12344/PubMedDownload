The direct interaction of mannose-specific plant lectins with gp120 of HIV-1 was 
studied by surface plasmon resonance. Inhibition experiments indicated that
exposed high mannose type glycans play a key role in the interaction. Most of the
lectins specifically accommodate outer alpha1,2-, alpha1,3-, or alpha1,6-linked
di- or trimannosides, and especially legume lectins, also interact with the
trimannoside core of the complex type glycans. The unexpected affinity of some
lectins towards gp120 presumably results from conformational differences in their
binding sites. These results demonstrate that mannose-specific plant lectins are 
powerful tools to study the accessibility and elucidate the function of the gp120
glycans in the recognition and infection of the host cells by HIV-1.
