Leukocyte migration inhibitory factor in primary and recurrent ocular infections 
by herpes simplex-virus.

Grabner G, Jarisch R.

Using a direct assay of leukocyte migration inhibitory factor (LMIF),
cell-mediated immunity to herpes simplex virus (HSV) antigen was measured in
patients who had primary and recurrent ocular HSV infections. Those with primary 
and recurrent epithelial disease had a significantly lower production of LMIF
than a control population than had had no herpetic infection for at least a year 
or longer (P less than 0.001). On the contrary, patients with deep stromal
involvement and anterior uveitis showed significant migration inhibition with HSV
antigen, similar to the one found in the healthy control group. The clinical and 
possible therapeutic implications of thes findings are discussed.
