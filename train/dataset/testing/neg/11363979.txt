AIDS: Simplified findings from some of the presentations at the Interscience
Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) are presented. A
virus associated with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) may be transmitted through saliva.
Homosexual or bisexual activities are primary risk factors for African Americans 
with KS. Intravenous infusions of IL-2 and indinavir increases CD4 counts
significantly. AIDS progression in children is associated with decreased levels
of IL-2. The duration of therapy with IL-2 is more important than the dose.
Pharmacists are essential for ensuring that drugs are prescribed properly and do 
not conflict with other drugs or allergies. Combination therapies are
increasingly seen as more effective.
