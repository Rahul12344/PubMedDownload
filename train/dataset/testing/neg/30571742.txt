A strain of Zika virus (ZIKV) of Asian origin associated with birth defects and
neurological disorders has emerged and spread through the Americas. ZIKV was
first isolated in the blood of nonhuman primates in Africa and has been detected 
in the blood, saliva, and urine of a few catarrhine species in both Africa and
Asia, suggesting that nonhuman primates may serve as both a source and a
reservoir of the virus. The recent introduction of ZIKV to human populations in
the Americas presents the potential for the virus to spread into nonhuman primate
reservoirs. Thus, it is critical to develop efficient and noninvasive detection
methods to monitor the spread of the virus in wild nonhuman primate populations. 
Here, we describe a method for ZIKV detection in noninvasively collected fecal
samples of a Neotropical primate. Fecal samples were collected from two captive
squirrel monkeys (Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis) that were experimentally
infected with ZIKV (Strain Mexico_1_44) and an additional two uninfected squirrel
monkeys. Nucleic acids were extracted from these samples, and RT-qPCR was used to
assay for the presence of ZIKV using primers flanking a 101 bp region of the NS5 
gene. In both ZIKV-inoculated animals, ZIKV was detected 5-11 days
post-infection, but was not detected in the uninfected animals. We compare the
fecal results to ZIKV detection in serum, saliva, and urine samples from the same
individuals. Our results indicate that fecal detection is a cost-effective,
noninvasive method for monitoring wild populations of Neotropical primates as
possible ZIKV reservoirs.
