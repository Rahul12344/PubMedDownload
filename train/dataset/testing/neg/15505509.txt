Ozone is known to act as a strong antimicrobial agent against bacteria, fungi,
and viruses. In the present study, we examined the effect of ozonated water
against Enterococcus faecalis and Streptcoccus mutans infections in vitro in
bovine dentin. After irrigation with ozonated water, the viability of E. faecalis
and S. mutans invading dentinal tubules significantly decreased. Notably, when
the specimen was irrigated with sonication, ozonated water had nearly the same
antimicrobial activity as 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). We also compared the 
cytotoxicity against L-929 mouse fibroblasts between ozonated water and NaOCl.
The metabolic activity of fibroblasts was high when the cells were treated with
ozonated water, whereas that of fibroblasts significantly decreased when the
cells were treated with 2.5% NaOCl. These results suggest that ozonated water
application may be useful for endodontic therapy.
