Oncolytic viruses offer a promising new modality for cancer treatment. The
strategy of this therapy is to develop viruses capable of selectively infecting
and replicating in malignant tumor cells. Oncolytic viruses can spread and
destroy malignant tumors without deleterious effects in normal tissues. These
viruses are genetically engineered based on both the biology of replicating
viruses and the major genetic defects in human cancer cells, so that they can
replicate in cancer cells but not in normal cells. The key to the development of 
such viruses is the identification of viral genes, the deletion or modification
of which enables tumor-specific cell destruction. Several clinical trials have
demonstrated the safety of oncolytic viruses as cancer therapy and have also
shown some encouraging results. Much evidence suggests that oncolytic viral
therapy works in synergy with standard cancer therapies. In this review, we will 
focus on the oncolytic viruses that may be beneficial to patients with lung
cancer in the near future.
