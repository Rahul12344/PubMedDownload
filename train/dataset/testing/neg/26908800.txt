BACKGROUND: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends
1-time hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing in the 1945-1965 birth cohort, in addition
to targeted risk-based testing. Emergency departments (EDs) are key venues for
HCV testing because of the population served and success in HIV screening. We
determined the burden of undocumented HCV infection in our ED, providing guidance
for implementation of ED-based HCV testing.
METHODS: An 8-week seroprevalence study was conducted in an urban ED in 2013. All
patients with excess blood collected for clinical purposes were included.
Demographic and clinical information including documented HCV infection was
obtained from electronic medical records. HCV antibody testing was performed on
excess samples.
RESULTS: Of 4713 patients, 652 (13.8%) were HCV antibody positive. Of these, 204 
(31.3%) had undocumented HCV infection. Among patients with undocumented
infections, 99 (48.5%) would have been diagnosed based on birth cohort testing,
and an additional 54 (26.5%) would be identified by risk-based testing. If our ED
adhered to the CDC guidelines, 51 (25.0%) patients with undocumented HCV would
not have been tested. Given an estimated 7727 unique ED patients with HCV
infection in a 1-year period, birth cohort plus risk-based testing would identify
1815 undocumented infections, and universal testing would identify additional 526
HCV-infected persons.
CONCLUSIONS: Birth cohort-based testing would augment identification of
undocumented HCV infections in this ED 2-fold, relative to risk-based testing
only. However, our data demonstrate that one-quarter of infections would remain
undiagnosed if current CDC birth cohort recommendations were employed, suggesting
that in high-risk urban ED settings a practice of universal 1-time testing might 
be more effective.
