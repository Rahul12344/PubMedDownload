BACKGROUND: We conducted investigations in 2 villages in Cambodia where outbreaks
of influenza H5N1 occurred among humans and poultry to determine the frequency of
and risk factors for H5N1 virus transmission.
METHODS: During May 2006, approximately 7 weeks after outbreaks of influenza H5N1
among poultry occurred, villagers living near households of 2 patients with
influenza H5N1 were interviewed about potential H5N1 exposures and had blood
samples obtained for H5N1 serological testing by microneutralization assay. A
seropositive result was defined as an influenza H5N1 neutralizing antibody titer 
of 1:80, with confirmation by Western blot assay. A case-control study was
conducted to identify risk factors for influenza H5N1 virus infection. Control
subjects, who had seronegative results of tests, were matched with
H5N1-seropositive persons by village residence, households with an influenza
H5N1-infected poultry flock, sex, and age.
RESULTS: Seven (1.0%) of 674 villagers tested seropositive for influenza H5N1
antibodies and did not report severe illness; 6 (85.7%) were male. The 7
H5N1-seropositive persons, all of whom were aged<or=18 years, were younger than
participants who tested seronegative for H5N1 antibodies (median age, 12.0 years 
vs. 27.4 years; P=.03) and were more likely than were the 24 control subjects to 
report bathing or swimming in household ponds (71.4% vs. 20.8%; matched odds
ratio, 11.3; P=.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Avian-to-human transmission of influenza H5N1 virus remains low,
despite extensive poultry contact. Exposure to a potentially contaminated
environment was a risk factor for human infection.
