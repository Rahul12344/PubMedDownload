We have used activity gel analysis and immunoblotting to provide evidence linking
the hepatitis B virus (HBV) reverse transcriptase with its longest unassigned
open reading frame (polymerase [Pol]-ORF). Activity gel analysis demonstrated
that infectious HBV particles secreted by the Hep 2.2.15 cell line contain major 
(approximately 70 kilodaltons [kDa]) and minor (approximately 90 kDa) reverse
transcriptase activities. By Western immunoblotting, we detected in both HBV
particles and Hep 2.2.15 cell extract a approximately 70-kDa Pol-specific
peptide. This approximately 70-kDa peptide reacted with antisera directed against
the carboxy terminus of the pol gene product. No such immunoreactivity was
observed with antisera against the amino terminus of the Pol peptide. The reverse
transcriptase protein which was eluted from the major approximately 70-kDa region
detected on an activity gel reacted with Pol-specific antisera. Furthermore,
reverse transcriptase activity was immunoprecipitated from dissociated HBV
particles by using Pol-specific antisera. On the basis of our results, we suggest
that HBV encodes its reverse transcriptase from the Pol-ORF.
