[Oral acyclovir therapy of virologically proven intraocular herpes simplex virus 
infections].

[Article in German]

Sundmacher R.

Three patients with severe intraocular herpetic disease (focal serous iritis,
endotheliitis, trabeculitis) were treated with oral acyclovir. Inflammatory signs
subsided promptly although only low-dose steroid eye drops were administered in
addition to antiviral therapy. Normally, the viral etiology of suspected
intraocular herpetic disease remains equivocal because virologic proof is
lacking. In these three cases, however, herpes simplex virus was isolated from
the aqueous humor before initiation of therapy, and the viral nature of the
diseases treated could thus be proven.
