The relation between the age at infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the
development of the carrier state is examined by using data from a number of
published and unpublished surveys. A remarkably consistent relation was found.
Infants infected perinatally (within the first 6 months of life) were found to
have a high probability of becoming carriers (0.885; 95% C.L. 0.84-0.93). Over
the infant and early childhood age classes there was found to be a sharp decrease
in the proportion of infections which lead to the carrier state. By adulthood
(over 15 years) the probability of developing the carrier status was found to be 
about 0.1. A model was fitted to the data by using maximum likelihood, which
provides a good empirical description of the observed data and can be used to
predict the expected probability of developing the carrier state given the age at
infection. It is postulated that, as a result of this rapid decline in the
probability of becoming a carrier during early childhood, a mass childhood
immunization campaign, which will tend to postpone the average age at infection
in the unvaccinated community, will have a disproportionately large impact on the
rate of generation of new carriers.
