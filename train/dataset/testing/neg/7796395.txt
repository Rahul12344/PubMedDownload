Telomerase activity was examined in 105 frozen samples from human normal liver
tissues, chronic liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Telomerase
activity was positive in 28 of 33 HCC tissues regardless of tumor stage or size. 
Telomerase was expressed in 15 of 18 differentiated HCC nodules smaller than 3
cm. HCC tissues from all eight hepatitis B virus-positive patients were
telomerase positive, while telomerase activity was not detected in normal liver
tissues (0 of 4). Weak telomerase activity was only detected in 1 of 22 nontumor 
liver tissues from HCC patients. Interestingly, in 19 of 38 hepatitis tissues and
6 of 8 cirrhotic liver tissues from apparently cancer-free patients, very weak
telomerase activity was detected. These results indicate that the expression of
telomerase may play a crucial role in hepatocarcinogenesis.
