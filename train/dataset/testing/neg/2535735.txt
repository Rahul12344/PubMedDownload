We previously showed (V. W. Raymond and J. T. Parsons, Virology 160:400-410,
1987) that variants of the Prague A strain of Rous sarcoma virus containing large
deletions impinging on a region of the src gene encoding amino acid residues 143 
to 169 were defective for transformation of chicken cells in culture. Here we
report that introduction of small (tri-and tetrapeptide) deletions into a region 
of pp60v-src containing amino acid residues 155 to 175 was found to inactivate
transformation. In addition, insertion of four, but not one, amino acid residues 
at position 161 also inhibited transformation. Biochemical analysis of the src
proteins encoded by individual transformation-defective variants revealed that
the structural alterations introduced into this domain had only marginal effects 
upon src tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity. However, the src proteins
encoded by defective variants exhibited a significantly shorter half-life within 
the cell, although these proteins efficiently and rapidly associated with
cellular membranes. Our results suggest that the structural domain encompassing
residues 155 to 177 may influence the stability of pp60src in the cellular
membrane, possibly via the interaction of src with a cellular membrane
component(s) or substrate(s).
