Premature infants suffer significant respiratory morbidity during infancy with
long-term negative consequences on health, quality of life, and health care
costs. Enhanced susceptibility to a variety of infections and inflammation play a
large role in early and prolonged lung disease following premature birth,
although the mechanisms of susceptibility and immune dysregulation are active
areas of research. This article reviews aspects of host-pathogen interactions and
immune responses that are altered by preterm birth and that impact chronic
respiratory morbidity in these children.
