Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus transmitted by mosquitoes, mostly
Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. After half a century of focal outbreaks of
acute febrile polyarthralgia in Africa and Asia, the disease unexpectedly spread 
in the past decade with large outbreaks in Africa and around the Indian Ocean and
rare autochthonous transmission in temperate areas. This emergence brought new
insights on its pathogenesis, notably the role of the A226V mutation that
improved CHIKV fitness in Ae. albopictus and the possible CHIKV persistence in
deep tissue sanctuaries for months after infection. Massive outbreaks also
revealed new aspects of the acute stage: the high number of symptomatic cases,
unexpected complications, mother-to-child transmission, and low lethality in
debilitated patients. The follow-up of patients in epidemic areas has identified 
frequent, long-lasting, rheumatic disorders, including rare inflammatory joint
destruction, and common chronic mood changes associated with quality-of-life
impairment. Thus, the globalization of CHIKV exposes countries with Aedes
mosquitoes both to brutal outbreaks of acute incapacitating episodes and endemic 
long-lasting disorders.
