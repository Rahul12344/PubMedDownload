Members of the gamma2-herpesvirus family encode cyclin-like proteins that have
the ability to deregulate mammalian cell cycle control. Here we report the key
features of the viral cyclin encoded by Murine Herpesvirus 68, M cyclin. M cyclin
preferentially associated with and activated cdk2; the M cyclin/cdk2 holoenzyme
displayed a strong reliance on phosphorylation of the cdk T loop for activity.
cdk2 associated with M cyclin exhibited substantial resistance to the cdk
inhibitor proteins p21(Cip) and p27(Kip). Furthermore, M cyclin directed cdk2 to 
phosphorylate p27(Kip1) on threonine 187 (T187) and cellular expression of M
cyclin led to down-regulation of p27(Kip1) and the partial subversion of the
associated G1 arrest. Mutation of T187 to a non-phosphorylatable alanine rendered
the p27(Kip1)-imposed G1 arrest resistant to M cyclin expression. Unlike the
related K cyclin, M cyclin was unable to circumvent the G1 arrest associated with
p21(Cip1) and was unable to direct its associated catalytic subunit to
phosphorylate this cdk inhibitor. These results imply that M cyclin has
properties that are distinct from other viral cyclins and that M cyclin
expression alone is insufficient for S phase entry.
