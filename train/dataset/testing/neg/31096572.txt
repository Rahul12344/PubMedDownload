Identifying drug resistance mutations is important for the clinical use of
antivirals and can help define both a drug's mechanism of action and the
mechanistic basis of resistance. Resistance mutations are often identified
one-at-a-time by studying viral evolution within treated patients or during viral
growth in the presence of a drug in cell culture. Such approaches have previously
mapped resistance to enfuvirtide, the only clinically approved HIV-1 fusion
inhibitor, to enfuvirtide's binding site in the N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) of
the Envelope (Env) transmembrane domain as well as a limited number of allosteric
sites. Here, we sought to better delineate the genotypic determinants of
resistance throughout Env. We used deep mutational scanning to quantify the
effect of all single-amino-acid mutations to the subtype A BG505 Env on
resistance to enfuvirtide. We identified both previously characterized and
numerous novel resistance mutations in the NHR. Additional resistance mutations
clustered in other regions of Env conformational intermediates, suggesting they
may act during different fusion steps by altering fusion kinetics and/or exposure
of the enfuvirtide binding site. This complete map of resistance sheds light on
the diverse mechanisms of enfuvirtide resistance and highlights the utility of
using deep mutational scanning to comprehensively map potential drug resistance
mutations.
