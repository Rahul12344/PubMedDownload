We examine the action of natural selection in a periodically changing environment
where two competing strains are specialists respectively for each environmental
state. When the relative fitness of the strains is subject to a very general
class of frequency-dependent selection, we show that coexistence rather than
extinction is the likely outcome. This coexistence may be a stable periodic
equilibrium, stable limit cycles of varying lengths, or be deterministically
chaotic. Our model is applicable to the population dynamics commonly found in
many types of viruses.
