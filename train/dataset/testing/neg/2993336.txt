Detection of cytomegalovirus by DNA-DNA hybridization employing probes labelled
with 32-phosphorus or biotin.

Various factors influencing the detection of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in
infected cells by DNA-DNA hybridization have been investigated. Employing the
Hind III O fragment of HCMV AD169 labelled with 32P, we found that detection
sensitivity was highly influenced by the method employed for extraction of DNA
from infected cells. Excision of the Hind III O fragment from the vector by
restriction endonuclease digestion prior to 32P-labelling further improved the
detection capability of the probe. Similarly, cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA detection
employing biotin-labelled probes and streptavidin/alkaline phosphatase in the
hybridot assay was also highly dependent on the method of DNA extraction prior to
hybridization. Finally, we describe an in situ assay employing a biotin-labelled 
probe and fluorescein-conjugated avidin to detect CMV DNA in cultured cells.
