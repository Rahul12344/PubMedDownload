Crossing the threshold of fear.

Sabatier R.

PIP: This interview was conducted with a 31-year-old US man from California, who 
has AIDS. He was 1st diagnosed in 1982. 4 years later, after a failed suicide
attempt and a subsequent period of depression and withdrawal, he began a new
career as an AIDS educator. His work has taken him across the US, where he is a
member of the US National Association of People with AIDS (NAPWA), to Africa, as 
a consultant to the Norwegian Red Cross. He has also advised a number of European
AIDS groups. He believes that people with AIDS (PWAs) and those who are
seropositive have been under-used in the AIDS epidemic and in the epidemic of
ignorance and prejudice which often follows the disease's spread. PWAs have a
special role to play in helping people overcome prejudicial attitudes toward
people with AIDS. This is both because people with AIDS have largely transcended 
the fear that people have of the disease, and because meeting a PWA humanizes the
situation. The interview also considers racial prejudice in NAPWA, denial of the 
disease, and the benefits in forging links between different groups affected by
AIDS.
