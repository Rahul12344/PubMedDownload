Inhibition of turkey herpesvirus replication by anti-cellular serum.

Quail embryo fibroblasts were used to investigate how rabbit and chicken antisera
against chicken erythrocytes carrying different B alleles of the major
histocompatibility antigens affect the neutralization of herpesvirus of turkeys
(HVT). Although the neutralizing activities of these antisera were rather low,
the HVT propagated in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) from certain genotypic
embryos was neutralized more by the antisera to the corresponding erythrocytes.
After absorption of these antisera with homologous erythrocytes, the neutralizing
activity of the absorbed sera was reduced slightly. These results reveal that the
virion antigens of HVT might be partially associated with the host cell antigens 
of the fibroblast infected with the virus. The virus grown in these cells might
incorporate the host cell antigens, including histocompatibility antigens, into
the virion envelope.
