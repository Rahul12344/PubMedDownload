Two unrelated patients with GATA2-haploinsufficiency developed a hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)-like disease during a varicella zoster virus (VZV)
infection. High copy numbers of VZV were detected in the blood, and the patients 
were successfully treated with acyclovir and intravenous immunoglobulins. After
treatment with corticosteroids for the HLH, both patients made a full recovery.
Although the mechanisms leading to this disease constellation have yet to be
characterized, we hypothesize that impairment of the immunoregulatory role of NK 
cells in GATA2-haploinsufficiency may have accentuated the patients'
susceptibility to HLH. Expansion of a double negative T-lymphocytic population
identified with CyTOF could be a further factor contributing to HLH in these
patients. This is the first report of VZV-triggered HLH-like disease in a primary
immunodeficiency and the third report of HLH in GATA2-haploinsufficiency. Since
HLH was part of the presentation in one of our patients, GATA2-haploinsufficiency
represents a potential differential diagnosis in patients presenting with the
clinical features of HLH-especially in cases of persisting cytopenia after
recovery from HLH.
