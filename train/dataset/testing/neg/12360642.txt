The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has recommended voluntary Human
Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) screening in all pregnant patients. Is the incidence
of HIV in women of child bearing age in South Dakota high enough to warrant
aggressive testing? Since HIV reporting began in 1985, there have been five cases
of maternal to fetal transmission (vertical transmission) of HIV in the state of 
South Dakota. The incidence of heterosexual transmission of HIV is increasing in 
South Dakota and in the year 2000, there have been seven new cases of HIV/AIDS
diagnosed in women between the ages of 15-39 years of age, "According to June
Snyder of the South Dakota Department of Health in April 2001."
