INTRODUCTION: An adequate level of personal protective equipment (PPE) is
necessary when treating patients with highly infectious diseases or those
contaminated with hazardous substances.
METHODS: Following National Institute for Health Research's Research Centre
(London, United Kingdom) approval, the authors of this study conducted a survey
of specialist registrars' knowledge of the respiratory and skin protection
requirements needed during a resuscitation scenario with Advanced Life Support.
Participant responses were compared to UK national recommendations and to a
previous survey in 2009.
RESULTS: A total of 98 specialist registrars (in Anesthesiology, n=51; in
Emergency Medicine (EM), n=21; and in Intensive Care Medicine (ICM) n=26)
completed hand-delivered surveys. The best knowledge of PPE requirements (76%)
was found for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), with less knowledge about
PPE requirements for anthrax, plague, Ebola virus disease (EVD), and smallpox
(60%). The results show limited knowledge of PPE requirements (20%-30%) for
various chemical warfare agents. Personal protective equipment knowledge
regarding treatment of sarin-contaminated casualties was over-rated by 80%, and
for patients with EVD, it was over-rated by up to 67% of participants.
CONCLUSION: The results of the tested cohort indicate that current knowledge
regarding PPE for chemical warfare agents remains very limited.
