Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the subtype H5N1 (HPAIV-H5N1) have
circulated continuously in Asia, Europe, and Africa since 2003. Investigations on
the environmental preference and global spread processes of the virus are needed.
We compiled 16 environmental variables to assess their correlation with
HPAIV-H5N1 occurrences by using a niche-based model called Maxent. We found the
virus had the strongest positive association with the human footprint index, as
well as the presence of certain types of wetlands and mild temperature (10-30 C).
Outbreaks of HPAIV-H5N1 in poultry or wild birds were also more frequent in
certain major habitat types (e.g., tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf
forests, temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, and flooded grasslands and
savannas) and ecoregions. We conducted trend surface analysis to generate the
travelling wave of the virus' global spread from 2003 to 2009, which indicated
that high mountains or plateaus did not affect the spread speed and direction.
