In response to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic, the U.S. military
established comprehensive policies to protect individual and public health and to
assure military readiness. Central to this effort was the creation of a
total-force HIV screening program. As representative of these military programs, 
the U.S. Army's HIV testing program is described. The first decade of this
program is assessed from financial, research, policy, and epidemic-control
perspectives. We conclude that the government's investment has been a prudent
one, leaving the U.S. military better positioned to counter the threats posed by 
the HIV pandemic.
