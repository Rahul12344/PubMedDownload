The immunogenic properties of Lassa virus GP1, GP2, and NP polypeptides were
studied in rabbits. Lassa virus NP polypeptide, in contrast to GP1 and GP2
polypeptides, was shown to induce the highest titres of antibodies determined by 
IFA and ELISA tests. Moreover, the antibody relative avidity experiment showed
that the anti-NP antibodies has ELISA index of 0.63 whereas anti-GP1 and anti-GP2
antisera had those of 0.49 and 0.28, respectively.
