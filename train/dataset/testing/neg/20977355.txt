Limited data exist on the use of acute-phase proteins as predictors of
HIV-related outcomes. We examined the relationship between postpartum α(1)-acid
glycoprotein (AGP) concentrations and HIV-related maternal mortality,
mother-to-child transmission, and HIV-free survival among 643 Zimbabwean women.
Elevated AGP was significantly associated with a 5.74-fold (p = 0.001) increased 
risk of maternal death, a 2.39-fold (p = 0.033) increased risk of postnatal
transmission, and a marginally significant 1.85-fold (p = 0.087) increased risk
of infant infection or death. In a resource-limited setting, AGP may be of
utility as an inexpensive prognostic tool for HIV-infected individuals.
