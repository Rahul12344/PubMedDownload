bisulfite induced polynucleotide-protein crosslinkage in bacteriophage MS2.

UV (lambda = 254 nm) irradiation of bacteriophage MS2 or its treatment with
bisulfite induce covalent crosslinkage of the RNA to the coat protein.
epilsonN-(2-oxopyrimidyl-4)-lysine was found in the phage hydrolysates after
either type of treatment. An equimolar mixture of 0-methylhydroxylamine and
bisulfite causes complete disappearance of the cross-links. This led to the
conclusion that one of the factors responsible for the UV-induced
polynucleotide-protein crosslinkage and the main factor in treatment with
bisulfite is substitution of the exocyclic amino group of the activated cytosine 
nucleus by the lysine residue epilson-amino group of the protein.
