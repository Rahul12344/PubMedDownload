To explore the relationship between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and
Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotypes, we performed IS6110-based restriction
fragment-length polymorphism analysis on M. tuberculosis culture specimens from
patients with smear-positive tuberculosis in a periurban community in South
Africa from 2001 through 2005. Among 151 isolates, 95 strains were identified
within 26 families, with 54% clustering. HIV status was associated with W-Beijing
strains (P = .009) but not with clustering per se. The high frequency of
clustering suggests ongoing transmission in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive
individuals in this community. The strong association between W-Beijing and HIV
infection may have important implications for tuberculosis control.
