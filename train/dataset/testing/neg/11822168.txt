Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is endemic in many parts of the world and poses a
permanent threat for cloven-hoofed animals in all countries. The available
vaccines against FMD are safe and efficacious. Combat of FMD by vaccination is
controversial in currently FMD-free countries including the ones of the European 
Union. The article summarizes our knowledge concerning production and use of
vaccines, virus persistence, differentiation between vaccinated and infected
animals, vaccination programs and perspectives of vaccine development.
