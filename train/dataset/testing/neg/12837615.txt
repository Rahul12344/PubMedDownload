Presently, Phase III efficacy trials with subunit immune antigens against the
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are occurring in both the USA and
some Southeast Asian countries. However, there is no feeling of d√®ja vu within
the scientific community that these studies will demonstrate meaningful
protection against HIV infection, perhaps because the immune responses crucial
for containment of the virus might not be elicited by this approach. Under this
prevailing gloomy setting for international acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS) therapy, RNA interference has been identified as a likely strategy in the 
understanding that inhibition of HIV replication can be mediated by
post-transcriptional gene silencing through the production of double-stranded RNA
(dsRNA) nucleotide intermediates. This review briefly explores the role of the
nef gene during HIV-1 infection and highlights the expectation that RNA
interference might serve as a new sequence-specific therapeutic arsenal in AIDS
prevention, and possibly treatment, in the years ahead.
