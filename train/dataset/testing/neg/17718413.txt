OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of p163 and EGFR-antisense cDNA in signal
transduction on Hep-2 laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma in vitro.
METHODS: The Hep-2 laryngeal squamous carcinoma cells were transfected by
recombinant adenovirus AdEasy-EGFR-antisense and AdEasy-p16beta in vitro. The
inhibition of the EGFR expression and cell growth and changes of cell cycle, DNA 
content, apoptosis and ultramicrostructure of the Hep-2 cells were examined by
MTT, Western blotting analysis, Flow cytometry analysis, Immunohistochemistry,
and transmission electron microscope respectively. Results The proliferation of
the Hep-2 cells was inhibited significantly by the infection of the Ad-
Ad-p16beta or Ad-antisense EGFR. The infection also accelerated the apoptosis of 
the cancer cells. The proport of of cells in G0/G1 phases increased to more than 
77.7%. The Ad-antisense EGFR-infected cells showed lower protein expression of
EGFR. The P16beta protein over expression was observed in the Ad-p16beta-infected
cells.
CONCLUSION: The transfection of Ad- Ad-p16beta and Adantisense EGFR into Hep-2
cells leads to over-expression of Ad-pl6beta, and under-expression of EGFR, along
with G1-phase arrest and apoptotic cell death. Both EGFR and Ad-p16beta play
important roles in the genesis, growth and differentiation of the human
laryngocarcinoma cells.
