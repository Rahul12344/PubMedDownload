Oncogenes in retroviruses, malignancy, and normal tissues.

Lacey SW.

Oncogenes are genes with a proven cancer association that appear to function
primarily in the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation. The
preliminary work leading to their discovery, their association with retroviruses,
the retrovirus life cycle, and the use of retroviruses to find and characterize
oncogenes is discussed in detail. Chromosomal abnormalities are discussed using
Burkitt's lymphoma and the myc oncogene as prototypes. Finally, the normal
(nonmalignant) functioning of oncogenes is discussed in terms of embryogenesis
and hepatic regeneration.
