Both Ebola virus (EBOV) and Reston virus (RESTV) cause disease in nonhuman
primates, yet only EBOV causes disease in humans. To investigate differences in
viral pathogenicity, humanized mice (hu-NSG-SGM3) were inoculated with EBOV or
RESTV. Consistent with differences in disease in human infection, pronounced
weight loss and markers of hepatic damage and disease were observed exclusively
in EBOV-infected mice. These abnormalities were associated with significantly
higher EBOV replication in the liver but not in the spleen, suggesting that in
this model, efficiency of viral replication in select tissues early in infection 
may contribute to differences in viral pathogenicity.
