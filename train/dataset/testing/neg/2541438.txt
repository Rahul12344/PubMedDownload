Transfer of neor and bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV1) DNA into rat embryo
fibroblasts led to colony formation in G418-containing medium, with no detectable
background in controls with neor DNA alone. More than 50% of the drug-resistant
clones could be further propagated in culture. The genetic functions of BPV1
involved in colony formation and in long-term immortalization were investigated
by both translation termination mutations in the full-length genome, which
inactivate individual open reading frames, and constructs in which these open
reading frames were separately expressed under control of long terminal repeat
promoter enhancers. Expression of either open reading frame E2 or E5 was
sufficient for formation of a drug-resistant colony, but long-term growth in
culture required that of E6. No significant cooperative effect was observed upon 
cotransfection of BPV1 and ras oncogene DNAs. Expression of the early region of
the human papillomavirus type 16 also led to immortalization of rat embryo
fibroblast cells in the same assay, and, unlike what was previously reported in
baby rat kidney cells, it required neither activation by a heterologous promoter,
nor a cooperating ras oncogene.
