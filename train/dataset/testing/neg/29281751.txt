Powdery mildew is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat. To date, few
powdery mildew resistance genes have been cloned from wheat due to the size and
complexity of the wheat genome. Triticum urartu is the progenitor of the A genome
of wheat and is an important source for powdery mildew resistance genes. Using
molecular markers designed from scaffolds of the sequenced T. urartu accession
and standard map-based cloning, a powdery mildew resistance locus was mapped to a
356-kb region, which contains two nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat
domain (NB-LRR) protein-encoding genes. Virus-induced gene silencing, single-cell
transient expression, and stable transformation assays demonstrated that one of
these two genes, designated Pm60, confers resistance to powdery mildew.
Overexpression of full-length Pm60 and two allelic variants in Nicotiana
benthamiana leaves induced hypersensitive cell death response, but expression of 
the coiled-coil domain alone was insufficient to induce hypersensitive response. 
Yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and luciferase
complementation imaging assays showed that Pm60 protein interacts with its
neighboring NB-containing protein, suggesting that they might be functionally
related. The identification and cloning of this novel wheat powdery mildew
resistance gene will facilitate breeding for disease resistance in wheat.
