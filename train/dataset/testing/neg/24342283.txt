Several human and animal myopathies, such as malignant hyperthermia (MH), central
core disease and equine recurrent exertional rhabdomyolysis (RER) are confirmed
or thought to be associated with dysfunction of skeletal muscle calcium
regulation. For some patients in whom the genetic cause is unknown, or when
mutational analysis reveals genetic variants with unclear pathogenicity, defects 
are further studied through use of muscle histopathology and in vitro contraction
tests, the latter in particular, when assessing responses to ryanodine receptor
agonists, such as caffeine. However, since muscle biopsy is not always suitable, 
researchers have used cultured cells to model these diseases, by examining
calcium regulation in myotubes derived from skin, following forced expression of 
muscle-specific transcription factors. Here we describe a novel adenoviral vector
that we used to express equine MyoD in dermal fibroblasts. In permissive
conditions, transduced equine and human fibroblasts differentiated into
multinucleated myotubes. We demonstrate that these cells have a functional
excitation-calcium release mechanism and, similarly to primary muscle-derived
myotubes, respond in a dose-dependent manner to increasing concentrations of
caffeine. MyoD-induced conversion of equine skin-derived fibroblasts offers an
attractive method for evaluating calcium homeostasis defects in vitro without the
need for invasive muscle biopsy.
