From 1985 to 1987 within the framework of our health monitoring programme, the
occurrence of S. aureus in our rodent colonies and their caretakers have been
surveyed. To obtain further information on S. aureus subtypes, isolates were
subjected to phage typing using the international set of bacteriophages. Strains 
derived from pathological processes but also randomly chosen isolates from
healthy animal carriers and the personnel underwent lysotyping. With respect to
the animals every hygienic unit harbours its characteristic S. aureus
lysotype(s). Among these, usually one pattern dominates in pathological processes
and healthy carriers, although the spectrum of phage types distributed among the 
caretakers shows a much greater variation and some of the attendants are
suspected to be not only transient carriers. A comparison with an earlier
investigation done in our institute about a decade ago (Lenz et al. 1978) shows
the prevalence of completely different phage types.
