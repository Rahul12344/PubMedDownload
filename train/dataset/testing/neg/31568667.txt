To understand the genetic diversity and patterns of circulation of rhinoviruses
(RV) and enteroviruses (EV) in Singapore, we retrospectively screened 2950 nasal 
swab samples collected from adults presenting to primary care services with signs
of febrile illness in Singapore during 2007-2013 using sequencing and
phylogenetic methods. Through sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, our results
show the year-round circulation of the three rhinovirus species, A, B, and C. A
diverse set of RV/EV serotypes were detected in Singapore with a predominance of 
RV-A in all years, whereas serotypes EV-C A21 and EV-D68 were only sporadically
detected. This study highlights the previously unrecognized diversity and burden 
in the adult population in Singapore.
