Encapsidation of presynthesized and nascent (synthesized de novo) vesicular
stomatitis virus (VSV) leader RNA in vitro by the nucleocapsid protein (N) and
the role of the phosphoprotein (P, previously known as NS) in this process were
examined. Presynthesized VSV leader RNAs were derived from the SP6 transcription 
vectors containing both (+) and (-) leader genes while the nascent RNA was
derived from transcription of viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. The N and
the P proteins were made by transcription from SP6 vectors containing the genes, 
followed by translation of the mRNAs in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Here, we
demonstrate that the N protein alone encapsidated presynthesized VSV leader RNA; 
however, prior formation of N-P complex totally abolished the encapsidation
property of N. On the other hand, encapsidation of nascent RNA by the N protein
was stimulated by the N-P complex. These results suggest that encapsidation by
the N protein of presynthesized and nascent VSV RNA are separate biochemical
processes which can be distinguished by the differential role of the
phosphoprotein P in the two reactions.
