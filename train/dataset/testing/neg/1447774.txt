The bacteriophage P1 late promoter sequence Ps controls the expression of the
genes in the tail-fibre operon. Transcription from Ps only occurs during the
second half of the P1 vegetative growth cycle and is positively regulated by the 
product of the phage gene 10. In this study degenerate oligonucleotides were used
as primers in site-directed mutagenesis reactions in order to construct a large
set of point mutations within the late promoter sequence Ps. A total of 35
independent single point mutations was isolated and the mutants were tested for
promoter activity. Mutations in the Escherichia coli-like -10 region and in a
late operator sequence, containing a symmetric sequence centred around position
-22, resulted in significant reductions in promoter strength. Most of these
mutations alter base-pairs that are highly conserved among the known late
promoter sequences of the P1 family. In addition, insertion mutants that change
the spacing between the -10 and the late operator indicate that a special
topological arrangement between the two boxes is crucial for late promoter
function. These results suggest that the product of gene 10 binds specifically to
a late operator in order to activate transcription from P1 late promoter
sequences.
