Patients undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are at high
risk of severe gastrointestinal bleeding caused by infections, graft versus host 
disease, and disturbances in haemostasis. BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is known to
cause hemorrhagic cystitis, but there is also evidence of BKV shedding in stool
and its association with gastrointestinal disease. We report putative association
of BKPyV replication with high plasma viral loads in a pediatric HSCT patient
developing hemorrhagic cystitis and severe gastrointestinal bleeding
necessitating intensive care. The observation was based on chart review and
analysis of BKPyV DNA loads in plasma and urine as well as retrospective
BKPyV-specific IgM and IgG measurements in weekly samples until three months
post-transplant. The gastrointestinal bleeding was observed after a >100-fold
increase in the plasma BKPyV loads and the start of hemorrhagic cystitis. The
BKPyV-specific antibody response indicated past infection prior to
transplantation, but increasing IgG titers were seen following BKPyV replication.
The gastrointestinal biopsies were taken at a late stage of the episode and were 
no longer informative of BK polyomavirus involvement. In conclusion,
gastrointestinal complications with bleeding are a significant problem after
allogeneic HSCT to which viral infections including BKPyV may contribute.
