Sera from individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and
HIV-related West African viruses can mediate high-titered, virus-specific
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in all stages of infection. No
cross-reactive ADCC can be detected between HIV and HIV-related West African
strains LAV-2, HTLV-IV, and SBL-6669. Because these two groups of viruses have
antigenically distinct envelope glycoproteins, ADCC-mediating antibodies are most
likely directed against envelope antigens. For HIV-specific ADCC, this was
further confirmed by using sera reacting with HIV envelope but negative for
antibodies against viral core antigens.
