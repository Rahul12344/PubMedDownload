PlyC, a bacteriophage-encoded endolysin, lyses Streptococcus pyogenes (Spy) on
contact. Here, we demonstrate that PlyC is a potent agent for controlling
intracellular Spy that often underlies refractory infections. We show that the
PlyC holoenzyme, mediated by its PlyCB subunit, crosses epithelial cell membranes
and clears intracellular Spy in a dose-dependent manner. Quantitative studies
using model membranes establish that PlyCB interacts strongly with
phosphatidylserine (PS), whereas its interaction with other lipids is weak,
suggesting specificity for PS as its cellular receptor. Neutron reflection
further substantiates that PlyC penetrates bilayers above a PS threshold
concentration. Crystallography and docking studies identify key residues that
mediate PlyCB-PS interactions, which are validated by site-directed mutagenesis. 
This is the first report that a native endolysin can traverse epithelial
membranes, thus substantiating the potential of PlyC as an antimicrobial for Spy 
in the extracellular and intracellular milieu and as a scaffold for engineering
other functionalities.
