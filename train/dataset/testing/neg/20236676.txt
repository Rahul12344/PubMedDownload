The amino acid sequence of viral capsid proteins contains information about their
folding, structure and self-assembly processes. While some viruses assemble from 
small preformed oligomers of coat proteins, other viruses such as phage P22 and
herpesvirus assemble from monomeric proteins (Fuller and King, 1980; Newcomb et
al., 1999). The subunit assembly process is strictly controlled through
protein:protein interactions such that icosahedral structures are formed with
specific symmetries, rather than aberrant structures. dsDNA viruses commonly
assemble by first forming a precursor capsid that serves as a DNA packaging
machine (Earnshaw, Hendrix, and King, 1980; Heymann et al., 2003). DNA packaging 
is accompanied by a conformational transition of the small precursor procapsid
into a larger capsid for isometric viruses. Here we highlight the pseudo-atomic
structures of phage P22 coat protein and rationalize several decades of data
about P22 coat protein folding, assembly and maturation generated from a
combination of genetics and biochemistry.
