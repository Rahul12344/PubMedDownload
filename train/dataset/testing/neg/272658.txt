Modification of DNA by the benzo[a]pyrene metabolite diol-epoxide
r-7,t-8-dihydroxy-t-9,10-oxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene.

Kakefuda T, Yamamoto H.

The structural modification of double-stranded circular DNA of simian virus 40
and plasmid ColE1 by in vitro binding of
r-7,t-8-dihydroxy-t-9,10-oxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene was studied.
Stepwise hydrolysis with endonuclease S1 and DNase followed by DNA base analysis 
by thin-layer chromatography provided evidence that binding to adenine caused the
local denaturation of DNA, whereas the more than 10-fold greater binding to
guanine did not create such local denaturation. Of the two synthetic
double-stranded polymers, poly(dA-dT).poly(dA-dT) and poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC),
bound to the diol-epoxide, only the former showed a marked hydrolysis after
endonuclease S1 treatment, whereas binding occurred 24-fold more on the latter.
