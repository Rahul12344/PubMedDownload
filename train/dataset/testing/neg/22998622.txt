Despite the widespread availability and use of influenza vaccines, influenza
still poses a considerable threat to public health. Vaccines against seasonal
influenza do not offer protection against pandemic viruses, and vaccine efficacy 
against seasonal viruses is reduced in seasons when the vaccine composition is
not a good match for the predominant circulating viruses. Vaccine efficacy is
also reduced in older adults, who are one of the main target groups for
vaccination. The continual threat of pandemic influenza, with the known potential
for rapid spread around the world and high mortality rates, has prompted
researchers to develop a number of novel approaches to providing immunity to this
virus, focusing on target antigens which are highly conserved between different
influenza A virus subtypes. Several of these have now been taken into clinical
development, and this review discusses the progress that has been made, as well
as considering the requirements for licensing these new vaccines and how they
might be used in the future.
