The simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (SV40 Tag) has been ascribed many
functions critical to viral propagation, including binding to the mammalian tumor
suppressor p53. Recent studies have demonstrated that SV40-transformed murine
cells have functional p53. The status of p53 in SV40-immortalized human cells,
however, has not been characterized. We have found that in response to ionizing
radiation, p53-dependent p21 transactivation activity is present, albeit reduced,
in SV40-immortalized cells and that this activity can be further reduced with
either dominant negative p53 expression or higher SV40 Tag expression.
Furthermore, overexpression of p53 in SV40-immortalized ataxia-telangiectasia
(A-T) cells restores p53-dependent p21 induction to typical A-T levels. All
SV40-immortalized cell lines exhibited an absence of G1 arrest. Moreover, all
SV40-immortalized cell lines exhibited increased apoptosis relative to primary
cells in response to ionizing radiation, suggesting that SV40 immortalization
results in a unique phenotype with regard to DNA damage responses.
