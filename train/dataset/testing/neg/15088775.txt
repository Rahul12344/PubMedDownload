The 'Doctrine of Original Antigenic Sin', first phrased by Francis, Davenport &
Hennessy in 1953, and followed up by occasional papers in the 1960s and 1970s,
has lived a life in obscurity and negligence ever since it was postulated. From
time to time, and with long intervals, papers on the subject appear. And almost
invariably, they are quickly forgotten. Although many will erroneously use the
phrase 'Antigenic Sin' to describe classical cross-reactions, the term should be 
reserved to describe the strain-specific serological response to earlier
influenza strains after infection or vaccination with later variants,
irrespective of whether one or more antigenic shifts had occurred during the
observation period of the study. It is unlikely that antibodies generated under
the mechanism of Antigenic Sin will have any major epidemiological relevance.
