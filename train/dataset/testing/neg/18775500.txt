A novel protein showing strong antiviral activities against cucumber mosaic virus
(CMV) and tomato mosaic virus (TMV) was purified from the coelomic fluid of the
earthworm Eisenia foetida. The protein was characterized as a cold-adapted serine
protease. Its molecular weight was estimated to be 27,000 by SDS-PAGE. The enzyme
was most active at pH 9.5 and 40-50 degrees C. The protease activity at 4 degrees
C was 60% of that obtained at the optimal temperature. The activity was
suppressed by various serine protease inhibitors. Partial N-terminal amino acid
sequence of the enzyme showed homology with serine proteases of earthworms, E.
foetida and Lumbricus rubellus previously studied. Our results suggest that the
enzyme can be applicable as a potential antiviral factor against CMV, TMV, and
other plant viruses.
