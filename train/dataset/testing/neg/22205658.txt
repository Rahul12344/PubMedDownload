Virus-like particles (VLPs) based on the small envelope protein of hepatitis B
virus (HBsAg-S) are immunogenic at the B- and T-cell level. In this study, we
inserted overlapping sequences encoding the carboxy terminus of the Helicobacter 
pylori katA gene product into HBsAg-S. The HBsAg-S-KatA fusion proteins were able
to assemble into secretion-competent VLPs (VLP-KatA). The VLP-KatA proteins were 
able to induce KatA-specific antibodies in immunized mice. The mean total IgG
antibody titers 41 days post-primary immunization with VLP-KatA (2.3 × 10(3))
were significantly greater (P < 0.05) than those observed for vaccination with
VLP alone (5.2 × 10(2)). Measurement of IgG isotypes revealed responses to both
IgG1 and IgG2a (mean titers, 9.0 × 10(4) and 2.6 × 10(4), respectively), with the
IgG2a response to vaccination with VLP-KatA being significantly higher than that 
for mice immunized with KatA alone (P < 0.05). Following challenge of mice with
H. pylori, a significantly reduced bacterial load in the gastric mucosa was
observed (P < 0.05). This is the first report describing the use of VLPs as a
delivery vehicle for H. pylori antigens.
