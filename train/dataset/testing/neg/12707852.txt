Infection of the central nervous system by the type 1 human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV-1) commonly results in a number of neurological impairments known, in 
their most severe form, as HIV-associated dementia (HAD). The persistence of HIV 
encephalitis (HIVE), the pathological correlate of HAD, in spite of highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) underscores the importance of continued research
focused on the neurobiology of HIV. To elucidate direct and indirect mechanisms
of HIV neuropathogenesis, current investigation is focused on neuroinvasion,
HIV-1-mediated mechanisms of neuronal damage and apoptosis, and compartmentalized
evolution of virus in the brain. The aim of this review is to provide a selective
overview of the most recent research on the neurobiology of HIV, adding only a
brief introduction regarding established principles.
