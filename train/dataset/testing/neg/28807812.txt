Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an emerging zoonotic viral respiratory
disease that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In 2015, the largest
MERS outbreak outside of the Middle East region occurred in the Republic of
Korea. The rapid nosocomial transmission of MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Korean
health care settings highlighted the importance and urgent need for a rapid and
reliable on-site diagnostic assay to implement effective control and preventive
measures. Here, the evaluation and validation of two newly developed reverse
transcription-insulated isothermal PCR (RT-iiPCR) methods targeting the ORF1a and
upE genes of MERS-CoV are described. Compared with World Health
Organization-recommended singleplex real-time quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR)
assays, both RT-iiPCR assays had comparable analytical sensitivity for the
detection of MERS-CoV RNA in tissue culture fluid and in sputum samples spiked
with infectious virus. Furthermore, clinical evaluation was performed with sputum
samples collected from subjects with acute and chronic respiratory illnesses,
including patients infected with MERS-CoV. The overall agreement values between
the two RT-iiPCR assays and the reference RT-qPCR assays were 98.06% (95% CI,
94.43%-100%; κ = 0.96) and 99.03% (95% CI, 95.88%-100%; κ = 0.99) for ORF1a and
upE assays, respectively. The ORF1a and upE MERS-CoV RT-iiPCR assays coupled with
a field-deployable system provide a platform for a highly sensitive and specific 
on-site tool for diagnosis of MERS-CoV infections.
