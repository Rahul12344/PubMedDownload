Infection with herpes simplex is one of the most common sexually transmitted
infections. Because the infection is common in women of reproductive age it can
be contracted and transmitted to the fetus during pregnancy and the newborn.
Herpes simplex virus is an important cause of neonatal infection, which can lead 
to death or long-term disabilities. Rarely in the uterus, it occurs frequently
during the transmission delivery. The greatest risk of transmission to the fetus 
and the newborn occurs in case of an initial maternal infection contracted in the
second half of pregnancy. The risk of transmission of maternal-fetal-neonatal
herpes simplex can be decreased by performing a treatment with antiviral drugs or
resorting to a caesarean section in some specific cases. The purpose of this
paper is to provide recommendations on management of herpes simplex infections in
pregnancy and strategies to prevent transmission from mother to fetus.
