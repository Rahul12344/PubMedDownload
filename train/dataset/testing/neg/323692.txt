Specific features of the structural organization of the mitochondrial genome in
rat liver.

Shugalii AV, Todorov IN, German AV, Baev AS.

The nature of intramolecular heterogeneity of mtDNA in the liver of white rats
has been studied. The peculiarities of the melting curve, and the possibility of 
DNA fractionation of nucleotide compounds with hydroxylapatite (HA) column
chromatography has shown the presence of sequences differing in the mean
nucleotide content. A section of about 350 pairs in size repeated four times was 
found in the reassociation of most thermolabile fraction with a mean composition 
of 28% GC. These sections are well seen on the denaturation map of the recorded
molecules formed in the range of temperature transition 'helix-coil'. The
distance between the centers of fusible sections (in percentage of total length) 
is 32.5, 32, 14.0 and 21.5.
