Adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1) has many advantages as a gene therapy
vector, but the presence of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) is an
important limitation. This study was designed to determine: (1) characteristics
of AAV NAbs in human subjects, (2) prevalence of AAV1 NAbs in heart failure
patients and (3) utility of aggressive immunosuppressive therapy in reducing NAb 
seroconversion in an animal model. NAb titers were assessed in a cohort of heart 
failure patients and in patients screened for a clinical trial of gene therapy
with AAV1 carrying the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase gene (AAV1/SERCA2a).
AAV1 NAbs were found in 59.5% of 1552 heart failure patients. NAb prevalence
increased with age (P=0.001) and varied geographically. The pattern of NAb titers
suggested that exposure is against AAV2, with AAV1 NAb seropositivity due to
crossreactivity. The effects of immunosuppression on NAb formation were tested in
mini-pigs treated with immunosuppressant therapy before, during and after a
single AAV1/SERCA2a infusion. Aggressive immunosuppression did not prevent
formation of AAV1 NAbs. We conclude that immunosuppression is unlikely to be a
viable solution for repeat AAV1 dosing. Strategies to reduce NAbs in heart
failure patients are needed to increase eligibility for gene transfer using AAV
vectors.
