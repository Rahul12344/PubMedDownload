The nucleotide sequence of the 3'-terminal portion of the tobacco etch virus
(TEV) genome was determined. The 2324-nucleotide sequence represented
approximately one-fourth of the TEV genome and included the capsid protein gene
and flanking regions. An open reading frame of 2135 nucleotides and an
untranslated region of 189 nucleotides adjacent to a polyadenylate tract were
identified. The sequence began within an open reading frame, indicating that the 
initiation codon was upstream of the available sequence data. The sequence of the
20 NH(2)-terminal amino acids of the TEV capsid protein was established
chemically. An identical amino acid sequence, predicted from the nucleotide
sequence, was located, commencing at amino acid - 263. These data indicated that 
maturation of the capsid protein required a post-translational cleavage of a
larger protein precursor, with a probable cleavage site between the amino acids
glutamine and glycine.
