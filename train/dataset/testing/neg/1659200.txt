Primary cancers of the vagina are rare. They comprise 1% to 2% of all gynecologic
malignancies and occur predominantly in older women. The diagnosis of primary
carcinoma of the vagina requires that the cervix and vulva be intact and that no 
clinical evidence of other primary tumors exist. Approximately 90% of all vaginal
tumors are squamous cell in type on histologic examination. Adenocarcinoma, which
is much less common (2% to 4%), is seen primarily in younger women with in utero 
exposure to diethylstilbestrol. In addition to exposure to diethylstilbestrol,
other environmental factors have been associated with the development of vaginal 
tumors, including chronic irritation from pessaries, previous hysterectomy for
benign disease, immunosuppression therapy, cervical irradiation, and
endometriosis. Infectious causes seem to play an even more pernicious role in
vaginal cancer. The two agents most often implicated are herpes simplex virus and
human papillomavirus. These viruses appear to serve as cofactors in the
inducement of various genital cancers, working together or with environmental
agents such as diethylstilbestrol and host-related genetic abnormalities. The
prognosis of vaginal cancer depends on the stage of the disease, with an overall 
5-year survival rate of 80% to 90% for early stages.
