BACKGROUND: In this study, we determined the prevalence of hepatitis G virus
(HGV) infection in end-stage hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease and
examined the influence of HGV coinfection on the outcome of liver
transplantation.
METHODS: HGV was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and 
Southern blotting in sera drawn from 159 patients who were known to be HCV
infected before transplantation. Patients were followed up for a mean of 28.4
months after transplantation.
RESULTS: Forty-one (25.3%) patients were HGV positive and the prevalence of HGV
infection was similar for different HCV genotypes. Both HGV-positive and
-negative groups had similar survival, recurrence rates, inflammatory activity
scores, and degree of fibrosis at the time of recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Infection with HGV is common in end-stage HCV-infected patients
presenting for liver transplantation. It influences neither the outcome of liver 
transplantation nor the recurrence of hepatitis in the graft.
