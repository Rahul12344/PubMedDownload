Limited production capacity and delays in vaccine development are major obstacles
to vaccination programs that are designed to mitigate a pandemic influenza. In
order to evaluate and compare the impact of various vaccination strategies during
a pandemic influenza, we developed an age/risk-structured model of influenza
transmission, and parameterized it with epidemiological data from the 2009 H1N1
influenza A pandemic. Our model predicts that the impact of vaccination would be 
considerably diminished by delays in vaccination and staggered vaccine supply.
Nonetheless, prioritizing limited H1N1 vaccine to individuals with a high risk of
complications, followed by school-age children, and then preschool-age children, 
would minimize an overall attack rate as well as hospitalizations and deaths.
This vaccination scheme would maximize the benefits of vaccination by protecting 
the high-risk people directly, and generating indirect protection by vaccinating 
children who are most likely to transmit the disease.
