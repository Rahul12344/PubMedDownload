Changes in the activities of nucleoside triphosphatases and nucleoside kinases in
Vero cells infected with Simian virus 40.

Ishii H, Kanzaki Y, Hatase O, Oda T.

Changes in the activities of three enzymes involved in nucleotide metabolism were
studied following infection of Vero cells with SV40. The results showed that SV40
infection enhanced the activities of uridine phosphokinase and UMP phosphokinase 
involved in nucleotide synthesis and suppressed the activity of nucleoside
triphosphatases involved in nulceotide degradation. These SV40-induced enzyme
activity changes probably served to somehow increase the quantity of nucleotides 
for virus proliferation.
