The influence of ionic, nonionic and amphoteric detergents or surfactants (SA) on
determination of influenza A virus haemagglutinin content in the inactivated
influenza vaccine by single-radial-immunodiffusion technique has been
investigated. It was found that the action of different SA on IIV in SRID test is
dependent on the mode of vaccine production, the procedure of virus inactivation 
and probably also on the specific structure of the antigen tested. Nevertheless, 
for nearly all SA used in this work the optimal concentrations (largest
precipitation area) ranged from 1 to 2%; lower concentrations (except of
amphoteric detergents) failed to yield an optimal effect.
