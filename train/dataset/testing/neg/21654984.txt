WHO declares on June 11, 2009, that H1N1 (Swine-influenza A) is pandemic. There
have been nearly 30,000 confirmed H1N1 cases across 74 countries. The reports
have shown sharp increase in the number of infections reported in recent days
from Chile, Japan, and the UK, and other parts of the world, with the most
dramatic increase recorded in Australia where more than 1200 cases were reported 
in a very short duration. As per the latest report of the Ministry of Health and 
Family Welfare, death from swine flu has reached to 1235. Around 12,3397 people
have been tested in India as on February 1, 2010. In India, 23.3% of people who
have tested for swine flu are found suffering from swine flu. Also around 4% of
people who have tested positive for swine flu have died and could not be saved in
India. The New York Times has reported that this is the first flu for being
pandemic in the last 41 years. This article enlightens the brief review about the
swine influenza virus, its modes of spread, and prevention measures. The aim of
this article is to bring awareness in general and know the consequences of the
