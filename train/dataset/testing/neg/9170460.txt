OBJECTIVE: To determine if the signs and symptoms of genital herpes in pregnancy 
accurately identify primary genital herpes infections using serologic testing for
final classification.
METHODS: Twenty-three women with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of
primary genital herpes infections in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy
were subsequently cultured and tested serologically (for herpes simplex virus
type 1 and herpes simplex virus type 2 antibodies) and classified as having true 
primary (no herpes simplex virus type 1 or type 2 antibodies), nonprimary
(heterologous herpes simplex virus antibodies present), or recurrent (homologous 
antibodies present) infections.
RESULTS: Only one of 23 women with clinical illnesses consistent with primary
genital herpes virus simplex infections had serologically-verified primary
infection. This primary infection was caused by herpes simplex virus type 1.
Three women had nonprimary type 2 infections, and 19 women had recurrent
infections. Among culture-proven recurrent infections, 12 were caused by herpes
simplex virus type 2 and three by herpes simplex virus type 1. Only one infant
was born preterm, and no clinically significant perinatal morbidity was observed.
CONCLUSION: Correct classification of gestational genital herpes infections can
be accomplished only when clinical evaluation is correlated with viral isolation 
and serologic testing using a type-specific assay. Severe first episodes of
genital herpes infections among women in the second and third trimesters of
pregnancy are not usually primary infections and are not commonly associated with
perinatal morbidity.
