BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Interferon-gamma induced protein 10 (IP-10) was suggested to
be involved in liver injury in viral hepatitis. This study aimed to investigate
the impact of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) G-201A (rs1439490) in
IP-10 gene on disease progression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.
METHODS: The -201 SNP in IP-10 promoter was genotyped from 577 patients with
different illness categories and 275 health controls; In vitro IP-10 promoter
activity was compared between haplotype GG and AA homozygotes using luciferase
reporter system in HepG2 cells. In vivo expression of IP-10 was compared between 
patients with -201 AA genotype and GG genotype.
RESULTS: The detected frequency of G-201A SNP was 17.8%, 25.3%, 26.6%, and 13.8% 
for patients with acute hepatitis B (AHB), patients with mild chronic hepatitis B
(CHB-M), patients with severe chronic hepatitis B (CHB-S), and health controls,
respectively. In vitro IP-10 promoter-driven luciferase activity in
pGL3-Enhancer-201A transfected HepG2 cells was 1.43-fold higher than that in
pGL3-Enhancer-201G transfected HepG2 cells (P<0.01). In vivo IP-10
transcriptional expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was 1.38-fold
higher in patients with -201 AA genotype than in patients with -201 GG genotype
(P<0.01).
CONCLUSION: G-201A in promoter region of IP-10 gene was associated with liver
disease progression in patients with HBV infection through up-regulating IP-10
expression.
