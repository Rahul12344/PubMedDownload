BACKGROUND: T-cells expressing the HSV1-TK suicide gene can be used for the
control of graft-versus-host disease following allogeneic stem cell
transplantation. To develop clinical trials based on such a strategy, we have
generated under good manufacturing procedures a novel 'split genome' human
packaging cell line (1704 cells).
METHODS: To minimize the risk of generating replication-competent retroviruses,
pol was truncated to remove sequences overlapping with env. To improve retroviral
infection and selection of transduced T-cells, high titers of GALV-pseudotyped
retroviral particles harboring a bicistronic Thy1-IRES-TK vector coding for the
CD90 GPI-anchored membrane molecule were produced by 1704 cells.
RESULTS: Using 1704 cell supernatant and an optimized transduction protocol,
approximately 50% of primary T-cells were transduced and could then be purified
(approximately 95%) using clinical-grade immunomagnetic beads directed against
CD90. Over 96% of these OKT3/IL-2-activated CD90(+)-selected T-cells were killed 
by ganciclovir. Cell proliferation and cytokine production of transduced T-cells 
and HLA-restricted cytotoxicity of transduced T-cell clones were identical to
those of their non-transduced counterparts cultured under the same conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: GALV-pseudotyped retroviral particles harboring a bicistronic
Thy1-IRES-TK vector allow efficient transduction and rapid selection of human
T-cells under conditions applicable for clinical trials using the new human 1704 
packaging cell line.
