Morphogenesis of vaccinia virus in the process of envelopment as observed by
freeze-etching electron microscopy.

Hung T, Chou C, Fang C, Chang Z.

The morphogenesis of vaccinia virus was studied during its synthesis in HeLa
cells. Freeze-etching electron microscopy demonstrated intramembrane granules
attached to convex faces, a granule-free area characterized by eccentric location
and smooth appearance, and an eccentric nucleoid structure occasionally
associated with a membranous structure. It is postulated that the granule-free
area may be a precursor of the nucleoid envelope.
