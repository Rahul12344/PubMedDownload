Aichi viruses (AiV) have been detected in patients with diarrheal diseases (DD). 
The aim of this study was to assess AiV infection rates in hospitalized children 
with DD, including 123 HIV-1 seropositive and 125 HIV-1 seronegative patients, in
two public pediatric hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. AiV was investigated by
nested RT-PCR. The AiV-positive samples were also tested for specie A rotavirus, 
norovirus, astrovirus, enteric adenovirus and bocavirus in order to assess
co-infections. AiV parcial genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were
performed. AiV were detected in 9/123 (7.32%) of the HIV-1 seropositive subjects 
and 1/125 (0.8%) of the HIV seronegative patients with DD (p = 0.019). The
phylogenetic analysis of positive samples disclosed that: i) 13 samples were
characterized as genotype A, with one of them being from the HIV-1 seronegative
patient; ii) one sample from a HIV-1 seropositive patient was characterized as
genotype B. AiV genotype A was grouped into 3 genetic clusters. Data suggest that
AiV may be an opportunistic pathogen infecting children with AIDS and DD.
