A focus assay method for Japanese encephalitis virus using complement and
anti-virus serum.

Kimura-Kuroda J, Yasui K.

A sensitive, quantitative, short-time, and reproducible focus assay for Japanese 
encephalitis (JE) virus is described. After 2 or 3 days of incubation, the
infected cells were treated with anti-JE virus serum and complement, and
subsequently stained with trypan blue; then clear foci were produced. This method
made it easy to titrate the infectivities not only of all seven JE virus strains 
tested but also of West Nile (WN), Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE), and St.
Louis encephalitis (SLE) viruses using hyperimmune anti-JE virus serum for the
latter. Moreover, even cell lines which hardly formed plaques by the agar overlay
method easily produced foci within 2 or 3 days by this method.
