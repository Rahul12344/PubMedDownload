This work describes an approach for calculating and measuring dipolar
interactions in multispin systems to monitor conformational changes in
icosahedral protein cages using site-directed spin labeling. Cowpea chlorotic
mottle virus (CCMV) is used as a template that undergoes a pH-dependent
reversible capsid expansion wherein the protein cage swells by 10%. The
sequence-position-dependent geometric presentation of attached spin-label groups 
provides a strategy for targeting amino acid residues most probative of
structural change. The labeled protein cage residues and structural transition
were found to affect the local mobility and dipolar interactions of the spin
label, respectively. Line-shape changes provided a spectral signature that could 
be used to follow the conformational change in CCMV coat dynamics. The results
provide evidence for a concerted swelling process in which the cages exist in
only two structural forms, with essentially no intermediates. This methodology
can be generalized for all symmetry types of icosahedral protein architectures to
monitor protein cage dynamics.
