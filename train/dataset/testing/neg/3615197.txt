A simple and rapid preparation of M13 sequencing templates for manual and
automated dideoxy sequencing.

Kristensen T, Voss H, Ansorge W.

A simple and rapid procedure for the preparation of M13 single stranded DNA
sequencing templates which does not involve phenol extractions and alcohol
precipitations is described. Bacteriophages are precipitated from media
supernatants with acetic acid and recovered on glass fiber filters. Subsequent
dissociation of the phages and removal of contaminants is performed while the DNA
is bound to the glass. Finally, the purified DNA is eluted in a small volume of
low-salt buffer. The yield is higher than that obtained by standard methods. The 
simplified procedure takes less than 30 minutes and does not demand special
skills or equipment; the sequence resolution is as good as that obtained by
standard procedures both with the Klenow fragment and T7 DNA polymerase, with
radioactive labelling as well as in automated sequencing with a fluorescent
label.
