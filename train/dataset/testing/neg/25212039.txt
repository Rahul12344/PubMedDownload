Three cyclotides were isolated from the whole plant of Viola yedoensis in this
study. The two, vary peptide E and cycloviolacin Y5, were previously reported,
and a novel cycloviolacin VY1 was characterized according to the interpretation
of MS/MS fragmentation of peptides which were produced from the reduced and
alkylated parent peptide with the digestion of Endo Lys-C, trypsin and
chymotrypsin, separately. The stability of remarkable resistance to proteolytic
degradation by trypsin and chymotrypsin, and that of thermal denaturation was
confirmed again. Besides, the IC50 value of cycloviolacin VY1 against influenza A
H1N1 virus was (2.27 +/- 0.20) microg x mL(-1). It is the first cyclotide
reported with anti-influenza A H1N1 virus activity in vitro assay.
