The complete nucleotide sequence of Cymbidium mosaic virus (CymMV) isolated from 
vanilla in Hainan province, China was determined for the first time. It comprised
6,224 nucleotides; sequence analysis suggested that the isolate we obtained was a
member of the genus Potexvirus, and its sequence shared 86.67-96.61% identities
with previously reported sequences. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that CymMV
from vanilla fragrans was clustered into subgroup A and the isolates in this
subgroup displayed little regional difference.
