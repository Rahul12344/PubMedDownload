BACKGROUND: Virus infections frequently exacerbate asthma, and in some cases may 
even precipitate its onset. Although this association is well known, experimental
investigation has been hampered by the lack of adequate models.
OBJECTIVE: The effects of acute respiratory virus infection on sensitization to
aereoallergen were investigated in this study.
METHODS: Nebulized ovalbumin was used as an aeroantigen in normal mice, and in
those infected with respiratory syncytial virus or influenza A.
RESULTS: Both viruses caused transient illness. Ovalbumin inhalation did not
induce specific serum antibodies unless the mice were infected at the time of
nebulization. In exposed uninfected mice cutaneous challenge with ovalbumin
caused no response, but caused acute systemic illness and collapse if previous
pulmonary exposure had occurred during respiratory infection. Mice that collapsed
in response to cutaneous ovalbumin were found to have IgG1 specific to ovalbumin 
that was not found in the other mice. Intracellular cytokine staining of
splenocyte cultures showed ovalbumin-specific production of IL-4 was enhanced by 
virus infection during exposure. In CD8+ T cells, ovalbumin-specific
interferon-gamma production was also enhanced by co-infection with influenza.
Both viruses were equally associated with the induction of anaphylaxis.
CONCLUSION: These results show that infection with respiratory viruses powerfully
augments cellular and humoral immune responses to aeroantigen and provide an
experimental model that allows such effects to be investigated.
