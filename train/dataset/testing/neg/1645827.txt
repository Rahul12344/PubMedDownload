A 40-year-old male with unremarkable past history was admitted because of
fainting during an athletic run in the city. At the time of admission there were 
increased plasma creatinine level and phosphokinase activity, with myoglobinuria 
and increased transaminase activity. Serologic tests for viruses on admission and
after 15 days showed a selective increase in the anti-CMV titer from 1/16 to
1/256, being negative for the remaining viruses. The renal function rapidly
recovered without sequelae. According to the literature, this would be the first 
reported case of acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis and acute hepatitis due to
cytomegalovirus infection in a previously healthy individual.
