Acute hepatitis B in patients in Britain related to previous operations and
dental treatment.

Polakoff S.

The frequency of transmission of hepatitis B virus infection from health service 
staff to patients was assessed from reports of confirmed cases of acute clinical 
hepatitis in 1980-3. During the four years 4505 reports (91% of the total)
included replies to a question about recent operations; 153 patients (3.4%) had
this history. Transfused blood or blood products were considered the source for
27 cases (0.06%). Eleven patients (0.02%) were infected in two clusters, both in 
cardiac surgery units; six were caused by a perfusion technician, who was a
symptomless carrier, and five by a surgical registrar during the incubation
period of an acute hepatitis B infection. The estimated average annual risk of a 
patient developing acute hepatitis B as part of a cluster caused by staff during 
surgical procedures was one in a million operations. For another 11 patients
blood transfusion could not be excluded as a source. Where no association between
surgery and hepatitis was found the incidence of a history, lay between 2.3 and
2.6%. The Hospital In-Patient Enquiry data showed that about 2.4% of the
population had had operations in a six month period. These findings suggest that 
transmission of hepatitis B infection from staff to patients is rare in Britain
and that the small risk could be eliminated by attention to measures to preserve 
asepsis and by immunising staff at risk.
