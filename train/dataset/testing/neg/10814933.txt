BACKGROUND: The efficacy of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was
prospectively monitored in HIV-1 seropositive patients by analyzing HIV-1 RNA
viral load.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the viral load course in two
different groups of patients (group 1: CD4>400/mm(3), group 2: CD4<200/mm(3))
during a period ranging from 9 to 25 months.
STUDY DESIGN: HIV-1 viral load, at the start and during HAART, was analyzed in
117 patients who had previously been treated only with two anti-transcriptase
drugs but were naive for protease inhibitors.
RESULTS: The results showed that, after the beginning of therapy, high plasma
HIV-1 RNA levels dropped to undetectable values (<50 copies HIV-RNA/ml) in one
third of patients over a mean period of about 9 months irrespective of the
initial CD4 cell count, even though a viral reduction of at least 2log(s) in a
significantly shorter period of time (P<0.001) was observed only among patients
who began retroviral therapy with a higher CD4 cell count.
CONCLUSION: The response to HAART was not dramatically affected by the initial
CD4 count. Though restricted to a small number of subjects, the data support the 
idea that therapeutic intervention can be effective even in an advanced stage of 
HIV-1 infection, when patients show a decreased number of CD4 T-lymphocytes.
