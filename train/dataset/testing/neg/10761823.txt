Depressive or psychotic symptoms are a well known side-effect of interferon alpha
(INF-alpha). Therefore, the questions arises whether a chronic psychosis should
be considered a contraindication for the treatment of active hepatitis C with
INF-alpha. We report on a 38-year-old woman with a chronic schizophrenic
psychosis, who acquired chronic aggressive hepatitis C. Considering the young age
of the woman, the potential risk of developing a hepatocellular carcinoma and the
result of the liver biopsy, treatment with interferon alpha 2 b (3x5 million
IU/week) was started. The patient was seen three times a week, her psychiatric
condition was monitored using the positive and negative symptoms score (PANSS).
No signs of psychotic or depressive symptoms appeared during INF-alpha therapy.
During the first 6 months the liver enzymes dropped slowly but the virus load was
increasing. After adding ribavirin to the therapy, the liver enzymes dropped
again, and the PCR carried out 9 months after initiation and 6 months after the
end of the 12 months INF-alpha treatment did not detect any virus RNA. This
positive result should encourage prospective studies including patients with
these two diagnoses on whether patients benefit from INF-alpha.
