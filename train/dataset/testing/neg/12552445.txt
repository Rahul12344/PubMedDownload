Cellular factors that may protect against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
infection were investigated in 27 HIV-exposed seronegative (ESN) female sex
workers (FSWs) and 27 HIV-seronegative female blood donors. Compared with blood
donors, ESN FSWs had significantly decreased expression levels of C-X-C chemokine
receptor 4 (CXCR4), but not of C-C chemokine receptor 5, on both memory (P<.001) 
and naive (P=.041) CD4(+) T cells. CXCR4 down-regulation was associated with
prolonged duration of commercial sex work by ESN FSWs. CD38 expression on CD8(+) 
T cells was significantly increased among ESN FSWs, compared with that among
blood donors (P=.017). There were no differences in HLA-DR and CD62L expression
between blood donors and ESN FSWs. Proportions of T cells producing the
beta-chemokines RANTES (regulated on activation, normally T cell-expressed and
-secreted), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, and MIP-1beta or the
cytokines interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis
factor-alpha, were similar in the 2 groups. These data indicate that ESN FSWs
differ from HIV-seronegative female blood donors with respect to immunological
factors that have no clear protective potential against HIV transmission.
