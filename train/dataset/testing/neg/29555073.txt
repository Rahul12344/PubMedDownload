The modern environmental and food analysis requires sensitive, accurate, and
rapid methods. The growing field of biosensors represents an answer to this
demand. Unfortunately, most biosensor systems have been tested only on distilled 
water or buffered solutions, although applications to real samples are
increasingly appearing in recent years. In this context, biosensors for potential
food applications continue to show advances in areas such as genetic modification
of enzymes and microorganisms, improvement of recognition element immobilization,
and sensor interfaces. This chapter investigates the progress in the development 
of biosensors for the rapid detection of food toxicants for online applications. 
Recent progress in nanotechnology has produced affordable, mass-produced devices,
and to integrate these into components and systems (including portable ones) for 
mass market applications for food toxicants monitoring. Sensing includes chemical
and microbiological food toxicants, such as toxins, insecticides, pesticides,
herbicides, microorganisms, bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms, phenolic 
compounds, allergens, genetically modified foods, hormones, dioxins, etc.
Therefore, the state of the art of recent advances and future targets in the
development of biosensors for food monitoring is summarized as follows:
biosensors for food analysis will be highly sensitive, selective, rapidly
responding, real time, massively parallel, with no or minimum sample preparation,
and platform suited to portable and handheld nanosensors for the rapid detection 
of food toxicants for online uses even by nonskilled personnel.
