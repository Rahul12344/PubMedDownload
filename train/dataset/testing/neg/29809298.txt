Risk factors (RFs) and mortality data of community-acquired respiratory virus
(CARVs) lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) with concurrent pulmonary
co-infections in the setting of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (allo-HSCT) is scarce. From January 2011 to December 2017, we
retrospectively compared the outcome of allo-HSCT recipients diagnosed of CARVs
LRTD mono-infection (n = 52, group 1), to those with viral, bacterial, or fungal 
pulmonary CARVs LRTD co-infections (n = 15, group 2; n = 20, group 3, and n = 11,
group 4, respectively), and with those having bacterial pneumonia mono-infection 
(n = 19, group 5). Overall survival (OS) at day 60 after bronchoalveolar lavage
(BAL) was significantly higher in group 1, 2, and 4 compared to group 3 (77%,
67%, and 73% vs 35%, respectively, P = .012). Recipients of group 5 showed a
trend to better OS compared to those of group 3 (62% vs 35%, P = .1).
Multivariate analyses showed bacterial co-infection as a RF for mortality (hazard
ratio[HR] 2.65, 95% C.I. 1.2-6.9, P = .017). We identified other 3 RFs for
mortality: lymphocyte count <0.5 × 109 /L (HR 2.6, 95% 1.1-6.2, P = .026), the
occurrence of and CMV DNAemia requiring antiviral therapy (CMV-DNAemia-RAT) at
the time of BAL (HR 2.32, 95% C.I. 1.1-4.9, P = .03), and the need of oxygen
support (HR 8.3, 95% C.I. 2.9-35.3, P = .004). CARV LRTD co-infections are
frequent and may have a negative effect in the outcome, in particular in the
context of bacterial co-infections.
