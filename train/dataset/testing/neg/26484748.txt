CONCLUSION: Not all patients diagnosed with congenital infection using umbilical 
cord assay were found to be positive for CMV-DNA by perilymphatic fluid assay. In
addition, a CMV-DNA-positive result was observed in one patient who had not been 
diagnosed with congenital infection. Sampling of perilymphatic fluid from a large
population of patients with congenital SNHL caused by congenital CMV infection or
of unknown etiology is required to determine the prevalence of CMV-related
profound HL.
OBJECTIVES: Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is one of the most frequent
manifestations in patients with congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Using
dried umbilical cord, a PCR-based assay was recently developed for the
retrospective detection of congenital CMV infection. This study analyzed the
presence of CMV in the perilymphatic fluid and evaluated differences in the
effect of cochlear implantation between CMV-positive and -negative groups.
METHOD: Perilymphatic fluid was collected from each patient at the time of
cochlear implantation and analyzed for the presence of CMV using a PCR method.
RESULTS: The perilymphatic fluid in two of the five patients suffering from
congenital CMV infection and in one of the 17 patients without congenital CMV
infection was found to be positive for CMV.
