To evaluate whether there is any impact of rotavirus infection on nontyphoid
Salmonella (NTS) gastroenteritis, a total of 207 diarrheal children who had
positive stool culture for NTS and also a stool examination for the rotavirus
antigen were retrospectively analyzed. According to the positivity of the stool
rotavirus antigen, patients were divided into two groups and compared with regard
to demographic data, clinical features, laboratory findings, and complications.
The results showed that there were no significant differences between the two
groups of patients with regard to demographic data, clinical features, and
laboratory findings, except that vomiting was more common in patients with a
coinfection of rotavirus (70.4% vs 40.0%, P = 0.003). Complication by bacteremia 
occurred more frequently in patients with coinfection of rotavirus (32% vs 9.3%, 
P = 0.004), but none of them developed extraintestinal focal infections, which
were observed only in patients with isolated NTS infection. Our study indicated
that concomitant rotavirus infection increased the risk of bacteremia in children
with NTS gastroenteritis, although the prognosis remained favorable.
