The role played by stereochemistry in the C2-substituent (left part) on the
S-DABO scaffold for anti-HIV-1 activity has been investigated for the first time.
A series of S-DABO analogues, where the double bond in the C2-substituent is
replaced by an enantiopure isosteric cyclopropyl moiety, has been synthesized,
leading to the identification of a potent lead compound endowed with picomolar
activity against RT (wt) and nanomolar activity against selected drug-resistant
mutants. Molecular modeling calculation, enzymatic studies, and surface plasmon
resonance experiments allowed us to rationalize the biological behavior of the
synthesized compounds, which act as mixed-type inhibitors of HIV-1 RT K103N, with
a preferential association to the enzyme-substrate complex. Taken together, our
data show that the right combination of stereochemistry on the left and right
parts (C6-substituent) of the S-DABO scaffold plays a key role in the inhibition 
of both wild-type and drug-resistant enzymes, especially the K103N mutant.
