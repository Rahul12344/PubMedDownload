Dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS)
are the re-emerging infectious diseases caused by dengue (DEN) virus, transmitted
by Aedes mosquito. There are more than 100,000 cases of dengue infection and more
than 100 deaths annually in Thailand. Virological surveillance for DEN viruses is
used as an early warning system to predict outbreaks. The seroprevalence of
infection and serotypes of DEN virus in 116 pediatric patients at Si Sa Ket
Province, Thailand were analyzed during June to September 2004. At the same
period, Aedes mosquitoes were caught from patients' and their neighbors' houses, 
from control houses, located in villages with no report of dengue infection
during the previous 3 years. The majority of DHF cases were secondary infections 
of DEN-2 and DEN-4 serotypes. Of the 1,652 Aedes mosquitoes collected 1,583 were 
Ae. aegypti and 69 Ae. albopictus. Ten mosquitoes from each house were pooled and
dengue viruses were determined using RT-PCR assay; only 1 positive pooled was
found. Although the dengue infection rate in the field caught mosquitoes was low,
the existing dengue virus control program in transmission areas by aerial
spraying to destroy the larva breeding sites should be continued.
