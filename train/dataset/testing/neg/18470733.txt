Giant cell hepatitis is a frequent reaction of the liver to different injuries in
newborns and in childhood, but rare in adults. This form of hepatitis is often
accompanied by cholestasis and shows fast progression to cirrhosis. In most cases
autoimmune, metabolic, toxic or viral origin can be found, but sometimes the
etiology remains hidden. This paper introduces two adult giant cell hepatitis
cases. Hepatitis C virus infection was the possible origin in the first case and 
autoimmune disease in the other one.
