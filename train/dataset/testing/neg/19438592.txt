We have reported that CXCL16, a recently discovered transmembrane chemokine, is
expressed in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF). However, it is not known whether
HGF express CXCR6, the receptor for CXCL16, or CXCL16 affects HGF biology. We
have shown that HGF expressed CXCR6 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction and flow cytometric analysis. Moreover, we elucidated that tumour
necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) DNA
(Toll-like receptor-9 ligand) treatment enhanced CXCR6 expression by HGF.
Interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13 and CpG DNA up-regulated CXCR6 expression by
TNF-alpha-stimulated HGF. On the other hand, IL-1beta and interferon-gamma
inhibited CXCR6 expression on TNF-alpha-treated HGF. CXCL16 treatment induced HGF
proliferation and phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) and
protein kinase B (AKT) in HGF. In conclusion, HGF expressed CXCR6 functionally,
because CXCL16 induced HGF proliferation and ERK and AKT phosphorylation in HGF. 
These results indicate that CXCL16 may play an important role in the pathogenesis
and remodelling in periodontally diseased tissues.
