Polio elimination in India thru' PPI.

Saxena D.

PIP: Smallpox has been eradicated through the administration of vaccines. Polio
could be the next vaccine-preventable disease to be eradicated. The year 2000 has
been set for the global eradication of polio. The UNICEF Progress of Nations 1996
reports that more than 80% of the world's children are being immunized against
the polio virus, and the annual number of cases has been reduced from 400,000 in 
1980 to 90,000 in the mid 1990s. The fixed day, fixed site core strategy of the
immunization program has helped to establish a regular contact between the
community and the service provider. In this approach, the facility, date, and
time of the immunization session in each area is fixed and widely publicized
through wall paintings, display boards, pamphlets, and word of mouth. Pulse Polio
Immunization (PPI) has met with considerable success in both its implementation
and social mobilization. Immunization coverage levels are low in some Indian
states, especially for female children, and also in some rural areas.
