Understanding the diversity of henipaviruses and related viruses is important in 
determining the viral ecology within flying-fox populations and assessing the
potential threat posed by these agents. This study sought to identify the
abundance and diversity of previously unknown paramyxoviruses (UPVs) in
Australian flying-fox species (Pteropus alecto, Pteropus scapulatus, Pteropus
poliocephalus and Pteropus conspicillatus) and in the Christmas Island species
Pteropus melanotus natalis. Using a degenerative reverse transcription-PCR
specific for the L gene of known species of the genus Henipavirus and two closely
related paramyxovirus genera Respirovirus and Morbillivirus, we identified an
abundance and diversity of previously UPVs, with a representative 31 UPVs
clustering in eight distinct groups (100 UPVs/495 samples). No new henipaviruses 
were identified. The findings were consistent with a hypothesis of co-evolution
of paramyxoviruses and their flying-fox hosts. Quantification of the degree of
co-speciation between host and virus (beyond the scope of this study) would
strengthen this hypothesis.
