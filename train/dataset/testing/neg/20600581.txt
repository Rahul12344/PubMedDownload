OBJECTIVE: Cumulative evidence supports that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected
natural killer (NK) cells induce severe systemic and cutaneous inflammation in
patients with hypersensitivity to mosquito bites (HMB). In order to understand
the pathogenesis of HMB, we established an EBV-infected cell line and
characterized the cytological profiles.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A novel EBV-infected NK-cell line, designated NKED, was
established from a patient with HMB and used for the present study along with two
other NK-cell lines, KAI3 and KHYG-1.
RESULTS: NKED expressed the latency II-related transcripts. NKED cells were
positive for CD2 and CD161 antigens, and negative for CD3, CD16, CD34, CD56, and 
T-cell receptor α/β and γ/δ antigens. Although NKED cells contained several
cytotoxic molecules, the cells had an extremely poor cytotoxic activity. The
majority of NKED cells were negative for perforin, major histocompatibility
complex class I-restricted NK-cell receptors, CD94 and KIR2D, and an activating
receptor, NKG2D. NKED cells, however, secreted higher levels of tumor necrosis
factor-α. Stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or tumor necrosis
factor-α induced expression of BZLF1 messenger RNA in the NKED and KAI3 cells,
indicating the transition from the latent- to the lytic-cycle infection.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggested that NKED cells revealed a very low cytotoxic
effect probably because of the low expression levels of perforin, but had the
ability to release proinflammatory cytokines. NKED cells did not reflect the
characteristics of HMB, as they were different from pathogenic NK cells
proliferating in the HMB patient, but the difference indicated that pathogenic NK
cells could change their character in the presence of interleukin-2.
