Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the known cause of almost all cases of
cervical cancer. An understanding of the HPV genome has allowed the development
of two prophylactic vaccines capable of protecting against both persistent HPV
infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) with 100% efficacy in
fully vaccinated women. The vaccines, manufactured by Merck (Gardasil, which was 
approved by the US FDA in June, 2006) and GlaxoSmithKline (Cervarix, which will
be submitted for US FDA approval by the end of 2006), both target HPV types 16
and 18, which together account for 70% of cervical cancer. Merck vaccine also
targets HPV 6 and 11, covering =90% of genital warts. These vaccines are highly
immunogenic and have an excellent safety profile. HPV vaccines promise to offer
an exciting contribution to healthcare and cancer prevention. However, many
questions remain concerning who to vaccinate, the duration of protection, cost,
public acceptance, and the potential for worldwide distribution.
