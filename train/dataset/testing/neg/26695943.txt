BACKGROUND: The nuclear protein Src-associated protein of 68 kDa in mitosis
(Sam68) is known to bind RNA and be involved in cellular processes triggered in
response to environmental stresses, including virus infection. Interestingly,
Sam68 is a multi-functional protein implicated in the life cycle of retroviruses 
and picornaviruses and is also considered a marker of virus-induced stress
granules (SGs). Recently, we demonstrated the partial redistribution of Sam68 to 
the cytoplasm in FMDV infected cells, its interaction with viral protease
3C(pro), and found a significant reduction in viral titers as consequence of
Sam68-specific siRNA knockdowns. Despite of that, details of how it benefits FMDV
remains to be elucidated.
METHODS: Sam68 cytoplasmic localization was examined by immunofluorescent
microscopy, counterstaining with antibodies against Sam68, a viral capsid protein
and markers of SGs. The relevance of RAAA motifs in the IRES was investigated
using electromobility shift assays with Sam68 protein and parental and mutant
FMDV RNAs. In addition, full genome WT and mutant or G-luc replicon RNAs were
tested following transfection in mammalian cells. The impact of Sam68 depletion
to virus protein and RNA synthesis was investigated in a cell-free system.
Lastly, through co-immunoprecipitation, structural modeling, and subcellular
fractionation, viral protein interactions with Sam68 were explored.
RESULTS: FMDV-induced cytoplasmic redistribution of Sam68 resulted in it
temporarily co-localizing with SG marker: TIA-1. Mutations that disrupted FMDV
IRES RAAA motifs, with putative affinity to Sam68 in domain 3 and 4 cause a
reduction on the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes with this protein and
resulted in non-viable progeny viruses and replication-impaired replicons.
Furthermore, depletion of Sam68 in cell-free extracts greatly diminished FMDV RNA
replication, which was restored by addition of recombinant Sam68. The results
here demonstrated that Sam68 specifically co-precipitates with both FMDV 3D(pol) 
and 3C(pro) consistent with early observations of FMDV 3C(pro)-induced cleavage
of Sam68.
CONCLUSION: We have found that Sam68 is a specific binding partner for FMDV
non-structural proteins 3C(pro) and 3D(pol) and showed that mutations at RAAA
motifs in IRES domains 3 and 4 cause a decrease in Sam68 affinity to these RNA
elements and rendered the mutant RNA non-viable. Interestingly, in FMDV infected 
cells re-localized Sam68 was transiently detected along with SG markers in the
cytoplasm. These results support the importance of Sam68 as a host factor
co-opted by FMDV during infection and demonstrate that Sam68 interact with both, 
FMDV RNA motifs in the IRES and viral non-structural proteins 3C(pro) and
3D(pol).
