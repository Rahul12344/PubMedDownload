OBJECTIVE: To optimize the management of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus 
(HCV).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed two questionnaires to determine Italian
healthcare professionals' opinions on the overall management of HCV chronic liver
disease and the use of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in the treatment of HCV. A
Delphi consensus method using the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method was used to
determine opinions of an expert panel (EP) of specialists.
RESULTS: Overall 443 physicians from 167 Italian centres completed the two
questionnaires. The EP confirmed the importance of collaboration with general
practitioners (GPs) and HCV testing in high-risk groups, but did not agree on
treating patients over 80 years of age with DAAs. Over 90% agreed that it was
important to quantify HCV-RNA, determine genotype, and test for anti-HIV and
HBsAg before starting DAAs. Transient elastography (FibroScan®) was used by >90% 
to evaluate the stage of liver fibrosis while serum biomarkers were used by <20%.
Adherence to therapy, drug-drug interactions and the possibility of treating
advanced liver disease were decisive factors in therapy choice. Monthly
monitoring during therapy was considered appropriate and 80% were in favor of
HCV-RNA testing 24 weeks after the end of the therapy to confirm sustained
virological response (SVR). Over 80% agreed that it was necessary to continue
follow-up of patients with advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Scientific organizations should review their guideline
recommendations to facilitate access to DAAs.
