Multiplicity of Scrapie virus in infected mouse spleen cells in vivo.

Lavelle GC.

Subpopulations of spleen cells from scrapie virus-infected mice were used to
determine the average virus content of infected cells in vivo at a time when
virus was rapidly increasing in titer in lymphoreticular tissues. Comparison of
the mean lethal doses of lysed to intact cells indicated averages of 2 to 6
infectious units per infected cell. In another experiment, preparations of
cytoplasmic nucleic acids extracted from spleen cells of infected mice had no
detectable infectivity, which suggests that the transmissible form of the virus
is not a free nucleic acid.
