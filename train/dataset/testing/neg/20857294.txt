T cells detect infected and transformed cells via antigen presentation by major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the cell surface. For T cell
stimulation, these MHC molecules present fragments of proteins that are expressed
or taken up by the cell. These fragments are generated by distinct proteolytic
mechanisms for presentation on MHC class I molecules to cytotoxic CD8(+) and on
MHC class II molecules to helper CD4(+) T cells. Proteasomes are primarily
involved in MHC class I ligand and lysosomes, in MHC class II ligand generation. 
Autophagy delivers cytoplasmic material to lysosomes and, therefore, contributes 
to cytoplasmic antigen presentation by MHC class II molecules. In addition, it
has been recently realized that this process also supports extracellular antigen 
processing for MHC class II presentation and cross-presentation on MHC class I
molecules. Although the exact mechanisms for the regulation of these antigen
processing pathways by autophagy are still unknown, recent studies, summarized in
this review, suggest that they contribute to immune responses against infections 
and to maintain tolerance. Moreover, they are targeted by viruses for immune
escape and could maybe be harnessed for immunotherapy.
