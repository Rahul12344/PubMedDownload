We recently reported that different purification methods of recombinant
adeno-associated virus type 2 (rAAV2) affect the transduction characteristics
following subretinal injection. In this study, we examined the roles of
contaminant proteins from the HEK-293 cells and helper adenovirus, inactivation
of helper adenovirus and cell stress induced by DNA-damaging agents in
rAAV-mediated retinal transduction. Our results showed that contaminating
factors/proteins resulting from the helper E1 deleted adenovirus are possibly
responsible for efficient RPE transduction. Future studies of these factors will 
undoubtedly lead to development of new therapeutic approaches to PR- and
RPE-specific retinal diseases.
