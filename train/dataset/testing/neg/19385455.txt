BACKGROUND: The hepatitis D virus super-infection contributes significantly to
the morbidity and mortality of hepatitis B virus infection. The objectives were
to describe the incidence of Hepatitis D virus and comparative analysis of
disease activity in patients of chronic hepatitis B virus, with and without
super-infection of hepatitis D virus.
METHODS: This Cross-sectional comparative study was conducted at Department of
Medicine and Gastroenterology Clinic Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi,
Pakistan from February 2007 to July 2007. HBsAg positive patients who attended
our Gastroenterology clinic were selected for the study. After screening for
Anti-HDV these patients were segregated in to Anti-HDV positive and negative
groups. Data was analyzed on SPSS 12.
RESULTS: Eighty-four patients were selected. Seventy-three patients who fulfilled
the inclusion criteria were enrolled in to the study. Anti-HDV was positive in 23
(31.5%) patients. Among these 23 anti-HDV positive, HDV-RNA was detected in 15
(75%) patients. The differences of age, gender, marital status and area of
residence whether rural or urban were not significant between the two groups.
HBV-DNA was significantly suppressed in majority of anti-HDV positive patients (p
= 0.019). Mean serum ALT levels were significantly higher in patients who had HDV
infection (p = 0.014).
CONCLUSION: HDV infection was common in this series of patients with a frequency 
of 31.5%. All patients of chronic HBV should be screened for HDV whether they are
asymptomatic HBV carriers or have chronic active hepatitis particularly when they
have raised serum ALT.
