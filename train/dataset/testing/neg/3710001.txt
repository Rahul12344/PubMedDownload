Serum hepatitis B virus DNA in acute hepatitis type B.

Pontisso P, Bortolotti F, Schiavon E, Chemello L, Alberti A, Realdi G.

Sera obtained within 7 days after clinical onset of acute hepatitis type B were
positive for hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA by spot hybridization only in 4 out of
45 patients who subsequently recovered, but in 10 out of 10 patients who instead 
developed chronic infection. These results indicate that in uncomplicated acute
hepatitis B, virus replication is limited to an early phase of infection, often
preceding the onset of clinical symptoms, and suggest that serum HBV-DNA may
represent an early and predictive marker of chronicity.
