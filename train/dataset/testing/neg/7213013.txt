Oligonucleotide fingerprint analyses of influenza C virion RNA recovered from
five different isolates.

Meier-Ewert H, Petri T, Bishop DH.

Five different isolates of influenza C virus which were isolated over a period of
32 years and from four different continents were compared by RNA genome
oligonucleotide fingerprinting analyses. The earliest isolate of influenza C
virus was reported in 1949 by Taylor (19) and served as a reference strain for
this study. The results obtained using this technique of comparing relatedness
between viruses clearly showed that all strains are distinct. However, the
similarities in the pattern of the oligonucleotide fingerprints are marked for
the more recent virus isolates (1966-1979), whereas the reference strain C/Taylor
shows more pronounced differences. The results are consistent with the high
degree of serological crossreaction amongst influenza C viruses isolated over a
long period of time, a property which sets this group of viruses apart from type 
A and B members of the orthomyxoviridae.
