Bungowannah virus, which belongs to the genus Pestivirus within the family
Flaviviridae, has been associated with myocarditis and a high incidence of
stillbirths in pigs. In 2003, the virus was initially detected in a large pig
farming complex on two separate sites in New South Wales, Australia. Until now,
it has not been detected at other locations. Despite a program of depopulation
and disinfection, the virus could be only eradicated from one of the affected
farm complexes, the Bungowannah unit, but became endemic on the second complex,
the Corowa unit. In the present study, the genetic variability of virus isolates 
collected between 2003 and 2014 in the endemically infected population has been
retrospectively investigated. Phylogenetic analysis carried out based on
sequences of the E2 and NS5B coding regions and the full-length open-reading
frame revealed that the isolates from the different farm sites are closely
related, but that samples collected between 2010 and 2014 at the Corowa farm site
clustered in a different branch of the phylogenetic tree. Since 2010, a
high-genetic stability of this RNA virus within the Corowa farm complex, probably
due to an effective adaptation of the virus to the affected pig population, could
be observed.
