OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between the level of serum TNF-alpha of
chronic hepatitis C with severity of disease and curative effect of anti-virus
therapy with interferon alpha.
METHODS: Thirty healthy controls and 102 patients with chronic hepatitis C were
recruited into this study. The level of serum TNF-alpha was determined by ELISA
in both groups. Then the 102 patients with chronic hepatitis C were evaluated
after being classified into mild (44 cases), moderate (34 cases), and severe
types (24 cases) based on the results of liver function tests. Liver functions,
viral load and genotype of HCV RNA were measured.
RESULTS: Before anti-virus treatment, the level of fasting serum TNF-alpha in the
patients with chronic hepatitis C (1) was higher than that of the normal
controls; (2) in the cases with mild type was lower than that in the moderate and
severe groups; (3) serum TNF-alpha was not associated with the HCV load; (4)
serum TNF-alpha was not significantly different between HCV subtypes 1b and 2a;
(5) serum TNF-alpha was not significantly different between the patients
responsive and non-responsive to the anti-virus treatment; (6) serum TNF-alpha
was positively correlated with the level of serum direct bilirubin, negatively
correlated with cholinesterase (CHE).
CONCLUSIONS: The level of fasting serum TNF-alpha in the patients with chronic
hepatitis was higher than that in the normal controls, and was positively
correlated with the severity of the disease but not correlated with the
therapeutic effect of interferon-alpha.
