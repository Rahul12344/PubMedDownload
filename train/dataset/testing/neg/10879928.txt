During a survey effected in a meat pigeon slaughterhouse of central Italy,
atrophy of primary lymphoid organs (bursa of Fabricius and thymus) and hypoplasia
of bone marrow were observed. Histologic, ultrastructural, and hematologic
examinations were performed on a total of 80 randomly selected 30-day-old meat
pigeons. By histologic studies, lymphocytic depletion and necrosis with cyst
formations in the bursa of Fabricius were detected in all subjects that showed
thymus and bursa atrophy at necropsy. Basophilic intranuclear inclusions were
also observed in bursal cells. After ultrastructural studies, these inclusions
were proved to be viral particles resembling circoviruslike particles in
morphology and size. Severe lymphocytic depletion of the bursa was plausibly
associated with the presence of the viral particles.
