Induction with thymoglobuline, a potent anti-thymocyte polyclonal antibody, has
been recently reported to allow minimization of postoperative immunosuppression
in organ transplantation. The relationship with recurrence of hepatitis C virus
(HCV) after liver transplantation (LTx) has never been investigated. We report
here on the outcome in 22 HCV+ patients receiving thymoglobuline pre-treatment
and minimal immunosuppression after LTx. Patient survival and acute rejection
rates were good, and remarkably low dosages and levels of immunosuppression were 
achieved with thymoglobuline, without exposing patients to an elevated risk of
rejection. A progressive weaning of the primary immunosuppressor was also
possible in the majority of patients without complications. The HCV recurrence
rate was similar to what is reported in the literature, although lower HCV-RNA
viral loads were obtained with thymoglobuline, with a mild histologic course.
Although our results need to be validated in large cohort studies, our experience
shows that minimization of immunosuppression with thymoglobuline is effective in 
protecting against rejection and demonstrated a positive impact on HCV recurrence
that deserves further investigation.
