OBJECTIVE: Microvesicles (MVs) have been indicated as important mediators of
intercellular communication and are emerging as new biomarkers of tissue damage. 
Our previous data indicate that reactive microglia/macrophages release MVs in
vitro. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether MVs are released by
microglia/macrophages in vivo and whether their number varies in brain
inflammatory conditions, such as multiple sclerosis (MS).
METHODS: Electron and fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry were used to
detect myeloid MVs in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of healthy controls, MS
patients, and rodents affected by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE), the animal model of MS.
RESULTS: Myeloid MVs were detected in CSF of healthy controls. In relapsing and
remitting EAE mice, the concentration of myeloid MVs in the CSF was significantly
increased and closely associated with disease course. Analysis of MVs in the CSF 
of 28 relapsing patients and 28 patients with clinical isolated syndrome from 2
independent cohorts revealed higher levels of myeloid MVs than in 13 age-matched 
controls, indicating a clinical value of MVs as a companion tool to capture
disease activity. Myeloid MVs were found to spread inflammatory signals both in
vitro and in vivo at the site of administration; mice impaired in MV shedding
were protected from EAE, suggesting a pathogenic role for MVs in the disease.
Finally, FTY720, the first approved oral MS drug, significantly reduced the
amount of MVs in the CSF of EAE-treated mice.
INTERPRETATION: These findings identify myeloid MVs as a marker and therapeutic
target of brain inflammation.
