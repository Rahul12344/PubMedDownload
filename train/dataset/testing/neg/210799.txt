Cycloleucine blocks 5'-terminal and internal methylations of avian sarcoma virus 
genome RNA.

Dimock K, Stolzfus CM.

Cycloleucine, a competitive inhibitor of ATP: L-methionine S-adenosyltransferase 
in vitro, has been used to reduce intracellular concentrations of
S-adenosylmethionine and by this means to inhibit virion RNA methylation in
chicken embryo cells that are infected with B77 avian sarcoma virus. Under
conditions of cycloleucine treatment, where virus production as measured by
incorporation of radioactive precursors or by number of infectious particles is
not significantly affected, the internal m6A methylations of the avian sarcoma
virus genome RNA are inhibited greater than 90%. The predominant 5'-terminal
structure in viral RNA produced by treated cells in m7G(5')pppG (cap zero) rather
than m7G-(5')pppGm (cap 1). It appears from these results that internal m6A and
penultimate ribose methylations are not required for avian sarcoma RNA synthesis 
and function. Furthermore, these methylations are apparently not required for
transport of genome RNA to virus assembly sites. The insensitivity of the
5'-terminal m7G methylation to inhibition by cycloleucine suggests that the
affinity of S-adenosylmethionine for 7-methylguanosine methyltransferase is
significantly greater than for the 2'-0-methyltransferases or the
N6-methyltransferases.
