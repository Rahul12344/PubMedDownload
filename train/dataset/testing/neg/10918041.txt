In this study we attempted to investigate the feasibility of transferring
exogenous DNA into the recipient host via polyomavirus major capsid protein VP(1)
pseudocapsids generated from recombinant Escherichia coli, designated PyVP(1,E), 
both in vitro and in vivo. NIH-3T3 and FR3T3 cells were transfected with pCMV
beta and pPyMT-1 plasmid DNA, respectively. In vitro DNA transfection was carried
out via Pseudofect- and PyVP(1,E)-mediated methods, or by co-precipitation with
calcium phosphate. Expression of beta-galactosidase and PyMT reporter genes was
examined by Western-blot analysis. Parallel experiments were performed in vivo by
direct injection of pCMV beta and pPyMT-1 plasmid DNA, complexed with PyVP(1,E), 
into the livers of Wistar rats, followed by Western-blot analysis and
histochemical staining. The results obtained from in vitro transfection
experiments showed that expression of the reporter genes can be detected in the
recipient cells at 48 h post-transfection. PyVP(1,E) was shown to exhibit
similarly efficient in vitro DNA transfection properties to Pseudofect, which was
obtained from recombinant baculovirus.
