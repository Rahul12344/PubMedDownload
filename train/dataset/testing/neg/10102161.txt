Human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) infection and its treatment are
peculiar in children. Adherence and compliance must be carefully taken into
account before initiating or changing therapy and in the choice of drugs. Even in
the absence of paediatric-specific trial results and notwithstanding
drug-labelling notations, all antiretroviral drugs should be used when indicated.
A combined therapy is compulsory. Therapy is highly recommended in category C or 
category 3 and recommended in category B children. Indications in categories N1, 
N2, A1 or A2 are limited. A triple association is recommended in category C or
category 3 children or in those with a high viral load, when compliance is
guaranteed. A step-down strategy is not advisable. Infants' treatment should be
inserted into controlled studies. Therapy should be changed when serious side
effects or poor tolerance (choose drugs with a different toxicity and greater
tolerance), poor compliance (individualize the motives) or treatment failure
(evaluate progression and adherence) occurs.
