Objective: To evaluate the implementation of the 2013 Royal Australian and New
Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 'Management of Hepatitis B in
Pregnancy' guideline.
Methods: Retrospective cohort study of the clinical management and obstetric
outcomes among hepatitis B virus-positive women in a single tertiary maternity
hospital. Women with viral load >200,000 IU/ml were referred to a specialised
clinic for consideration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate therapy to reduce
mother to child transmission.
Results: A total of 11,496 women gave birth during the study period, of which 101
(0.9%) women were hepatitis B virus positive. Viral load was measured in 99 (98%)
of 101 hepatitis B virus-positive women; 30 (30%) had a viral load
>200,000 IU/ml. Twenty-six women accepted tenofovir disoproxil fumarate; of
these, 23 had a successful virological response (viral load <200,000 IU/ml before
delivery).
Conclusions: Adherence to updated management guidelines and patient acceptance of
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in our Australian population were high when
provided in the context of a dedicated perinatal service.
