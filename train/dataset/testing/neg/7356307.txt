The data on the properties of the interferon production protein repressor are
presented. It was isolated from the chick embryo fibroblasts in the state of
hyperreactivity to repeated induction of poly (ri) poly (rC). The repressor
activity amounted to 2048 IIU/ml. The repressor was thermoresistant and stable to
pH 2.0-8.0. A pronounced interferon inhibitory effect of the repressor was
observed after 20 minutes of its contact with the cells at a temperature of 37
degrees C. Its half-life was 10 hours. The repressor similarity with homologous
interferon was noted.
