The risk for otolaryngologists who treat patients with AIDS and AIDS virus
infection: report of an in-process study.

Sooy CD, Gerberding JL, Kaplan MJ.

The risk of contracting acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a concern
to otolaryngologists and other health care workers. Failure to appreciate this
valid concern is dangerous, but overestimating it may be equally injurious to the
delivery of good patient care. We review the data on antibody titers and recovery
of cultured virus in blood, saliva, middle ear fluid, cerumen, tears, and nasal
mucous. We also report the initial findings of a prospective study of
otolaryngologists at the San Francisco General Hospital. It appears that the risk
of transmission of AIDS is low and can be minimized by sound infection control
measures similar to those for hepatitis B.
