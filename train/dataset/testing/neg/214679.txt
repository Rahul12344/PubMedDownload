Comparison of five diagnostic methods for the detection of rotavirus antigens in 
calf faeces.

Ellens DJ, de Leeuw PW, Straver PJ, van Balken JA.

Immunoelectroosmophoresis, complement fixation, immunofluorescence on inoculated 
cell cultures, electron microscopy, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were
compared for the detection of rotavirus in faecal samples from calves. Rotavirus 
particles could be detected in 39 out of 98 faecal samples by electron
microscopy. Immunofluorescence, complement fixation, and
immunoelectroosmophoresis detected rotavirus antigens in 39, 42, and 30 samples, 
respectively. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated rotavirus
antigens in 49 faecal samples. The assay is not only sensitive but also simple to
perform and suitable for large-scale testing.
