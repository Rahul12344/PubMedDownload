OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an adaptive working memory
(WM) training (WMT) program, the corresponding neural correlates, and
LMX1A-rs4657412 polymorphism on the adaptive WMT, in human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) participants compared to seronegative (SN) controls.
METHODS: A total of 201 of 206 qualified participants completed baseline
assessments before randomization to 25 sessions of adaptive WMT or nonadaptive
WMT. A total of 74 of 76 (34 HIV, 42 SN) completed adaptive WMT and all 40
completed nonadaptive WMT (20 HIV, 20 SN) and were assessed after 1 month, and 55
adaptive WMT participants were also assessed after 6 months. Nontrained
near-transfer WM tests (Digit-Span, Spatial-Span), self-reported executive
functioning, and functional magnetic resonance images during 1-back and 2-back
tasks were performed at baseline and each follow-up visit, and LMX1A-rs4657412
was genotyped in all participants.
RESULTS: Although HIV participants had slightly lower cognitive performance and
start index than SN at baseline, both groups improved on improvement index (>30%;
false discovery rate [FDR] corrected p < 0.0008) and nontrained WM tests after
adaptive WMT (FDR corrected, p ≤ 0.001), but not after nonadaptive WMT (training 
by training type corrected, p = 0.01 to p = 0.05) 1 month later. HIV participants
(especially LMX1A-G carriers) also had poorer self-reported executive functioning
than SN, but both groups reported improvements after adaptive WMT (Global:
training FDR corrected, p = 0.004), and only HIV participants improved after
nonadaptive WMT. HIV participants also had greater frontal activation than SN at 
baseline, but brain activation decreased in both groups at 1 and 6 months after
adaptive WMT (FDR corrected, p < 0.0001), with normalization of brain activation 
in HIV participants, especially the LMX1A-AA carriers (LMX1A genotype by HIV
status, cluster-corrected-p < 0.0001).
INTERPRETATION: Adaptive WMT, but not nonadaptive WMT, improved WM performance in
both SN and HIV participants, and the accompanied decreased or normalized brain
activation suggest improved neural efficiency, especially in HIV-LMX1A-AA
carriers who might have greater dopaminergic reserve. These findings suggest that
adaptive WMT may be an effective adjunctive therapy for WM deficits in HIV
participants. ANN NEUROL 2017;81:17-34.
