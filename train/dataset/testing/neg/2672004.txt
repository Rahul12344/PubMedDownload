Analysis of protooncogene RNA expression in marrow stromal cells from long-term
marrow culture demonstrated high levels of c-abl 5-, 6-, and 7-kilobase (kb) RNA 
transcripts. In experiments on three independently derived simian virus
40-transformed marrow stromal cell lines, the expression of these c-abl
transcripts was further increased in response to recombinant tumor necrosis
factor alpha (1000 units/ml) and interleukin 1 alpha (10 units/ml). Although
lymphocyte-conditioned medium predominantly up-regulated the 5-kb transcript,
interleukin 1 alpha primarily affected the 6-kb transcript. The up-regulation of 
the 5-kb c-abl message correlated with up-regulation of the
granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor transcript and down-regulation
of procollagen I transcripts in transformed cells. These data suggest that c-abl 
plays roles in the regulation of extracellular matrix expression and in the
regulation of hematopoietic growth factors by stromal cells.
