BACKGROUND: The WHO 'Global Strategy for Dengue Prevention and Control,
2012-2020' addresses the growing need for the treatment of dengue, and targets a 
25% reduction in morbidity and 50% in mortality (using 2010 estimates as
baseline). Achieving these goals requires future dengue prevention strategies
that will employ both potential vaccines and sustainable vector-control measures.
Maternally transferred dengue antibody is an important factor in determining the 
optimal age for dengue vaccination.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the seroprevalence of dengue antibodies among mothers
living in an area of high endemicity--Ban Pong, Ratchaburi Province--and to
assess maternal dengue antibodies transferred to cord blood.
MATERIALS & METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 141 pregnant
women who delivered at Ban Pong Hospital, Ratchaburi, Thailand. Maternal-cord
paired sera were tested for dengue neutralizing (NT) antibody by PRNT50 assay. A 
ratio of â‰¥ 1:10 NT titer to dengue serotype was considered seropositive.
RESULTS: Most mothers (137/141, 97.2%) had NT antibodies to at least one dengue
serotype in their sera. At birth, the proportion of cord sera with NT antibodies 
to DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4, were high and similar to the sera of their
mothers, at 93.6%, 97.2%, 97.9%, and 92.2%, respectively. The dengue geometric
mean titers (GMT) in cord blood were significantly higher than the maternal
antibodies (p<0.001): highest in DEN-2, followed by DEN-3, and then DEN-1. The
GMT of DEN-4 was the lowest among all four serotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: Dengue infection is highly prevalent among pregnant women in this
dengue-endemic area. Most of the cord blood had transferred dengue antibodies,
which may have an impact on the disease burden in this population.
