The analysis of 1558 clinical samples revealed influenza virus A(H1N1v) RNA in
339 patients with influenza and 163 fatal cases,which was made in May to December
2009. Data on the antigenic properties of more than 250 of pandemic virus strains
isolated at the Research Institute of Influenza and the molecular genetic
characteristics of 31 strains are presented. All the test isolates were found to 
have the S203 substitution in hemagglutinin, which was characteristic of one of 5
minor genome A(H1N1v) virus variants found in the United States and Mexico in
2009. All the test strains contain the S31N substitution in the M2 protein, which
determines viral resistance to adamantine, and have no H275Y substitution in
neuraminidase, which determines oseltamivir resistance. The substitution of amino
acid residue of Asp to Gly at position 222 of HA was found in 8 (73%) of 11
isolates from postmortem lung and trachea samples and in 2 (10%) of 20 isolates
from nasopharyngeal swabs. The determination of the pathogenic role of this
substitution calls for further investigations.
