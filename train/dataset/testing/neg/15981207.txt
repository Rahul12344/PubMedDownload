Effective eradication of human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive tumors may require
CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell-mediated immune responses. Ectopic expression of MHC class
II surface molecules has been described in the context of cervical cancer, but
coexpression with other components of the MHC class II antigen presentation
pathway has not been addressed. We have evaluated the MHC class II antigen
presentation pathway in malignant squamous epithelium of HPV+ cervical cancer
lesions by in situ costaining HLA-DR with CLIP or DMA/DMB. Cervical cancer cells 
exhibit 3 MHC class II phenotypes: (i) DR+/CLIP+ or DM+; (ii) DR+/CLIP- or DM-;
and (iii) DR-/CLIP+ or DM+. The identical profile has been identified in HPV+
ME180 cells, which serve as a target for HLA-DR4-restricted and HPV68,
E7-specific CD4+ T cells. IFN-gamma pretreatment of ME180 cells, associated with 
differential trafficking of MHC class II molecules, is necessary for effective
T-cell recognition. Although proinflammatory cytokines may facilitate MHC class
II-restricted antigen recognition in tumor cells, different phenotypes of the MHC
class II antigen presentation pathway may be associated with evasion from
CD4+-mediated cellular immune responses.
