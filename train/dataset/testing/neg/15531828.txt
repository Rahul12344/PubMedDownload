OBJECTIVE: To study the occurrence of nosocomial diarrhea in pediatric wards and 
the role of infections in its causation.
METHODS: 75 cases conforming to the CDC definition of nosocomial diarrhea were
selected for the study. Stool samples were subjected to direct microscopic
examination, bacteriological culture and direct antigen detection for Clostridium
difficile (C. difficile) and Rota virus.
RESULTS: All the cases were sporadic in origin. Rota virus was detected in 16.67%
cases and Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (E.P.E.C.) was detected in 12% cases.
Cases in which no pathogen was detected (82.7%) outnumbered those in which a
pathogen was identified (17.3%).
CONCLUSION: Rota virus and E.P.E.C were the most common etiological agents. C.
difficile was detected in one case only. Most of the sporadic cases of nosocomial
diarrhea in pediatric patients can be managed on fluids and electrolytes.
