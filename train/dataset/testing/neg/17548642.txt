Human neutrophil peptides (HNPs) are released from granules of neutrophils in
response to various activating stimuli and they participate in the killing of
bacteria and the stimulation of various inflammatory responses. HNPs also inhibit
infectivity of enveloped viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV). In this
study, we demonstrate that HNPs increase the uptake of IAV and bacteria by
neutrophils. The dimeric HNPs also induced aggregation of IAV and bacterial
particles, which may, in part, explain their ability to increase uptake. HNPs did
not increase neutrophil respiratory burst responses to IAV. We have recently
demonstrated direct interactions of HNPs with surfactant protein D (SP-D),
another important effector of innate immunity and antimicrobial host defense.
Although HNPs did not alter SP-D-dependent uptake of IAV, they counteracted the
ability of SP-D to increase IAV-induced neutrophil H2O2 generation. Our studies
reveal previously unappreciated functional effects of HNPs, expand our
understanding of the antiviral properties of HNPs, and suggest important
interactions between collectins and HNPs in the host response to viruses and
bacteria.
