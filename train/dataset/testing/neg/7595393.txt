Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) isolate PPK20 is transmitted by Paratrichodorus
pachydermus nematodes. The factor(s) determining vector transmissibility has been
shown to be located on TRV RNA 2. Sequence determination revealed that PPK20 RNA 
2 contains three open reading frames encoding the coat protein (cp) and proteins 
with molecular masses of 29.4 and 32.8 kDa. The 29.4 and 32.8 kDa protein-coding 
genes showed no significant sequence similarity to any other known tobravirus
gene. A full-length cDNA of PPK20 RNA 2 cloned between the 35S promoter and nos
terminator infected plants when co-inoculated with PPK20 RNA 1. Deletions in the 
reading frames of the 29.4 and 32.8 kDa proteins revealed that these sequences
are dispensable for replication of PPK20 RNA 2 in plants. Subgenomic RNAs for
translation of cp and the putative 29.4 and 32.8 kDa proteins were detected in
infected leaves. The possible role of PPK20 RNA 2 non-structural genes in TRV
vector transmission is discussed.
