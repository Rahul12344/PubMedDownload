Induction of appropriate types of innate and adaptive immune responses depending 
on the nature of antigens is crucial to cope with a variety of pathogens and
concurrently to avoid pathological reaction to self antigens. Recent studies have
been elucidating that the diversity of immune responses is critically controlled 
by dendritic cells (DCs). Two DC subsets have been identified in humans: myeloid 
DCs (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). The DC subsets recognize different
microbial pathogens by expressing distinct repertoires of Toll-like receptors,
and induce different types of innate and adaptive immune responses depending on
environmental factors. Particularly, pDC precursors produce vast amounts of type 
I interferons in response to viruses and thus play an important role in
anti-viral immunity. In addition, type I interferons derived from pDCs are
instrumental in activating mDCs. Elucidating cellular and molecular mechanisms by
which functions of the two DC subsets are modulated will lead to understanding
the pathogenesis of various immune-related diseases and to developing novel
immunological therapies.
