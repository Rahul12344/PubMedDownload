The hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF-1alpha) is a major regulator of
energy homeostasis and cellular adaptation to low oxygen stress. Recently,
HIF-1alpha has been discovered to function as a global regulator of macrophage
and neutrophil inflammatory and innate immune functions, as befits these
specialized phagocytic cells who must operate effectively in the hypoxic
microenvironments of infected tissues. This review summarizes current knowledge
of the role of HIF-1alpha in mammalian innate immunity, emphasizing insight
gained from conditional gene targeting of the transcription factor in the myeloid
cell lineage. Dynamic changes in HIF-1alpha expression in the course of
bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections are outlined and inferences drawn
regarding the consequences for pathogen and host. A better understanding of
HIF-1alpha function may provide novel and rational approaches for boosting innate
immune function in the therapy of certain complicated infectious disease
conditions.
