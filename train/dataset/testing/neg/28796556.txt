INTRODUCTION: The multiple myeloma (MM) treatment scenario has changed
considerably over the past few years. Several novel targeted therapies are
currently under consideration including oncolytic virotherapy. Areas covered:
This review provides an analysis of the mechanisms of action of virotherapy, and 
summarizes the preclinical and clinical studies of systemic virotherapy developed
for the treatment of MM. Different types of viruses have been identified,
including: adenovirus, vaccinia virus, herpes simplex virus 1, myxoma virus,
reovirus, measles virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and coxsackievirus A21.
Expert opinion: The above-mentioned viruses can do more than simply infect and
kill malignant plasma cells alone or in combination with chemo and/or
radiotherapy. In fact, some of them can also be used to purge myeloma cells from 
an autologous bone marrow (BM) transplant. Further investigations are required to
better explore the best therapeutic combinations for MM and to also overcome
antiviral response immunity that can limit the efficacy of this therapeutic
strategy.
