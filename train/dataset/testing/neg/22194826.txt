BACKGROUND: Since its appearance in 2009, the pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus
circulated worldwide causing several severe infections.
METHODS: Respiratory samples from patients with 2009 influenza A(H1N1) and acute 
respiratory distress attending 24 intensive care units (ICUs) as well as from
patients with lower respiratory tract infections not requiring ICU admission and 
community upper respiratory tract infections in the Lombardy region (10 million
inhabitants) of Italy during the 2010-2011 winter-spring season, were analyzed.
RESULTS: In patients with severe ILI, the viral load was higher in
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with respect to nasal swab (NS), (p<0.001)
suggesting a higher virus replication in the lower respiratory tract. Four
distinct virus clusters (referred to as cluster A to D) circulated
simultaneously. Most (72.7%, n = 48) of the 66 patients infected with viruses
belonging to cluster A had a severe (n = 26) or moderate ILI (n = 22). Amino acid
mutations (V26I, I116M, A186T, D187Y, D222G/N, M257I, S263F, I286L/M, and N473D) 
were observed only in patients with severe ILI. D222G/N variants were detected
exclusively in BAL samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple virus clusters co-circulated during the 2010-2011
winter-spring season. Severe or moderate ILI were associated with specific 2009
influenza A(H1N1) variants, which replicated preferentially in the lower
respiratory tract.
