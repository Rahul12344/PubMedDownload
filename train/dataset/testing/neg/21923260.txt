West Nile virus (WNV) ecology in neotropical ecosystems is poorly understood, and
vertebrate hosts responsible for infecting mosquitoes remain unidentified
throughout the Caribbean Basin. After a period of intense WNV transmission among 
sentinel chickens near Ceiba, Puerto Rico, we measured abundance of resident
birds and species-specific prevalence of WNV infection. Taking the product of
these measures indicates the relative number of WNV infections by species.
Greater Antillean grackle (Quiscalus niger) accounted for the most WNV infections
among birds in our 100-km(2) study site. In urban habitats, the house sparrow
(Passer domesticus) was frequently infected. Immature birds less than one year of
age were more likely to have detectable WNV-reactive antibodies than older birds 
of the same species.
