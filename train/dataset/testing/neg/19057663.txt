APOBEC3G (A3G) is a host cytidine deaminase that, in the absence of Vif,
restricts HIV-1 replication and reduces the amount of viral DNA that accumulates 
in cells. Initial studies determined that A3G induces extensive mutation of
nascent HIV-1 cDNA during reverse transcription. It has been proposed that this
triggers the degradation of the viral DNA, but there is now mounting evidence
that this mechanism may not be correct. Here, we use a natural endogenous reverse
transcriptase assay to show that, in cell-free virus particles, A3G is able to
inhibit HIV-1 cDNA accumulation not only in the absence of hypermutation but also
without the apparent need for any target cell factors. We find that although
reverse transcription initiates in the presence of A3G, elongation of the cDNA
product is impeded. These data support the model that A3G reduces HIV-1 cDNA
levels by inhibiting synthesis rather than by inducing degradation.
