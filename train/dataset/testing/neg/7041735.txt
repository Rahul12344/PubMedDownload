Reconsidering the early steps of protein secretion.

Hall MN, Schwartz M.

We have reviewed a unique mutation affecting the hydrophilic segment of the
lambda-receptor signal sequence. Considering the implications of this mutation,
we have proposed a model depicting early steps of protein secretion. The salient,
novel features of this model are as follows. 1) The model explicitly states that 
the LamB protein must initiate the export process to be synthesized. Commitment
to synthesis occur subsequent to an interaction between the hydrophilic segment
of the signal sequence and a membrane export site, the initial interaction
between the nascent secreted protein and the membrane. Implicit in this concept
is obligatory co-translational secretion of lambda receptor. 2) We suggest the
existence of a "stop translation" sequence. The role of this sequence is to halt 
translation in order to allow sufficient time for the hydrophilic portion of the 
signal sequence to initiate export by interacting with a membrane receptor. 3) We
suggest that at least part of the "stop translation" sequence is located
down-stream from the signal sequence, after residue 15 of the mature LamB
protein. 4) We further speculate, albeit in the absence of direct evidence, that 
the hydrophobic portion of the signal sequence may also be part of the "stop
translation" sequence.
