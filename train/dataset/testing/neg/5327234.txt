Granboulan, Nicole (Institute de Recherches sur le Cancer, Villejuif, Seine,

coli cells infected with bacteriophage R17. J. Bacteriol. 91:849-857. 1966.-The
ultrastructural alterations in Escherichia coli infected with the RNA
bacteriophage R17 were further investigated by means of the technique of
high-resolution autoradiography. Tritiated precursors to ribonucleic acid (RNA), 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and protein were employed in separate experiments. A
striking inhibition of cellular RNA, DNA, and protein synthesis was noted.
Whereas normal RNA synthesis occurs in the nucleoid, in infected cells RNA
synthesis is predominantly cytoplasmic, but later in the latent period, and
during the stage of active viral growth, the label is localized in a polar
region. In the late stages of viral growth, RNA synthesis occurs only around the 
crystals. Protein synthesis also becomes localized in a polar region, but DNA
synthesis remains confined to the nucleoid. Under conditions of chloramphenicol
inhibition of viral-coat protein synthesis, RNA label is localized in the
paranuclear lesion, providing further indication that RNA forms this fibrillar
structure.
