OBJECTIVE: Porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV) involved in pig to human
xenotransplantation have raised great concerns because of their ubiquitous nature
in pigs and their ability of infecting human cells in vitro. Although no
significant cytopathic effect attributed to PERV was evident on PERV-infected
human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, we did proteomic analysis to
investigate the differences of protein profile in order to further characterize
the effect of PERV infection.
METHODS: HEK293 cells were cocultured with porcine peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs). Protein profiles of PERV-infected and -noninfected HEK293 cells
were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Protein spots with
at least 1.5-fold alteration were identified by high-definition mass spectrometry
(HDMS) analysis. Then real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting were performed to
validate the proteomic results.
RESULTS: Differential analysis of PERV-infected and -noninfected HEK293 cells by 
2-DE revealed ten differentially regulated proteins. The proteins identified by
HDMS were involved in various cellular pathways including signal transduction,
cell apoptosis, and protein synthesis.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study revealed differentially expressed proteins 
in HEK293 cells cocultured with porcine PBMCs and implied that these changes were
probably induced by PERV infection. These results provide clues and potential
links to understanding the molecular effect of the infection by human-tropic
PERV.
