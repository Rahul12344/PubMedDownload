BACKGROUND: Elderly people are at increased risk for severe influenza illness and
constitute therefore a major target-group for seasonal influenza vaccination in
most industrialized countries. The aim of this study was to estimate influenza
vaccine effectiveness (VE) among individuals aged 60+ years over three seasons
and to assess if the screening method is a suitable tool to monitor influenza VE 
in this particular target-group in Germany.
METHODS: We identified laboratory-confirmed influenza cases aged 60+ years
through the national communicable disease reporting system for seasons 2010/11,
2011/12 and 2012/13. Vaccination coverage (VC) data were retrieved from a
database of health insurance claims representing ~85% of the total German
population. We applied the screening method to calculate influenza
subtype-specific VE and compared our results with VE estimates from other
observational studies in Europe.
RESULTS: In total, 7,156 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases were included. VE
against all influenza types ranged between 49% (95% confidence interval [CI]:
39-56) in 2011/12 and 80% (95% CI: 76-83%) in 2010/11. In 2010/11
subtype-specific VE against influenza A(H1N1)pdm and B was 76% and 84%,
respectively. In the following seasons, VE against influenza A(H1N1)pdm, A(H3N2) 
and B was 87%, -9% , 74% (2011/12), and 74%, 39%, 73% (2012/13). VE was higher
among hospitalized compared to non-hospitalized influenza A cases. Seventeen
observational studies from Europe reporting subtype-specific VE among the elderly
were identified for the respective seasons (all applying the test-negative
design) and showed comparable subtype-specific VE estimates.
CONCLUSIONS: According to our study, influenza vaccination provided moderate
protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm and B in individuals
aged 60+ but no or only little protection against A(H3N2). Higher VE among
hospitalized cases might indicate higher protection against severe influenza
disease. Based on the available data, the screening method allowed us to assess
subtype-specific VE in hospitalized and non-hospitalized elderly persons. Since
controlling for several important confounders was not possible, the applied
method only provided crude VE estimates. However, given the precise VC-data and
the large number of cases, the screening method provided results being in line
with VE estimates from other observational studies in Europe that applied a
different study design.
