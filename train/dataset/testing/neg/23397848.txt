Detection of fowl adenovirus (FAV) DNA from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded 
(FFPE) sections was attempted by PCR. Serotypes of FAV were classified by
sequencing the PCR products. In trials of PCR using a positive control infected
with serotype 2 FAV, the best primer set was 57F forward primer
(5'-CAARTTCAGRCAGACGGT-3') and 26R reverse primer (5'-GGCTTGACGTACGCTCCGTA-3'). A
second PCR with the same primer set revealed a clearer band in the
electrophoresis of generated PCR products. Generated PCR products were confirmed 
to be derived from infected FAV. In addition, PCR and sequencing of PCR products 
of the liver FFPE sections, from two natural inclusion body hepatitis cases that 
were not examined for virologic isolation, suggested that the detected FAV was
serotype 8a. The PCR of FFPE sections, and serotyping by the sequencing of PCR
products, are useful for diagnosis and epidemiologic analysis of FAV infections.
