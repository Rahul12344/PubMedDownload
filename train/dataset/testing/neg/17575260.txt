The core complex is a structure involved in the fusion mechanism of many viruses,
as well as in intracellular vesicle fusion. A powerful approach for studying the 
dynamic stages of HIV-1-cell fusion utilizes DP178, a core complex inhibitory
peptide derived from the known sequence of the virus. Strikingly, we show that
fatty acids can replace the entire C-terminal region of DP178, known to play a
crucial role in the activity of the peptide. The inhibitory activity correlated
with the length of the fatty acid, with the direction of fatty acid attachment
(N- or C-terminus) and, as envisioned by a new triple staining assay, with the
concentration of the peptides on cells. Our findings indicate, for the first
time, the C-terminal boundary of the endogenous core structure in situ and
establish that the C-terminal region of DP178 functions mainly as an anchor to
the cell membrane. Apart from the mechanistic implications, such short
lipopeptides provide new, promising fusion inhibitors. Because the fusion
mechanism of HIV-1 is shared by other pathogen-enveloped viruses and by
intracellular vesicle fusion, our results might influence the research and
therapeutic efforts in these systems as well.
