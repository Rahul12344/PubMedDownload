Study of the polypeptide content of erwiniophage ZF40c(5/5) and ZF40-421 virulent
mutants has shown that their virions include no less than 10 structural proteins 
with molecular weights ranging from 16.9 to 96.5 kDa. Three polypeptides belong
to a group of major proteins with molecular weights 39.2, 33.1 and 18.5 kDa. They
correlate with the polypeptides of phage head, tail sheath and tail core
correspondingly. It has been proven that the protein contents of these phages are
identical, taking into account that the percent ratio of all polypeptides
approaches 1.0. The polypeptide profile of isogenic variant of phage ZF40-421
obtained on EccRC5297 is characterized by another ratio of major proteins. These 
differences are reflected in the structure of procapsids, that explains low level
of stability and viability of the variant. The work shows for the first time the 
possibility of using HPLC-chromatography for studying native phage particles and 
their structural components.
