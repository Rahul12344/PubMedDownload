Infection by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and exposure to dietary aflatoxin B-1
(AFB(1)) have both been implicated by epidemiological studies to be important
risk factors in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our ability to
derive transgenic mice which develop liver cancer as a consequence of the
expression of a single gene from HBV, the HBx gene, provides an opportunity to
use this animal model to test whether AFB(1) can induce p53 mutations,
particularly at codon 249, which are frequently detected in HCC and, as a result,
act synergistically with HBV to accelerate the manifestation of disease. While
AFB(1) significantly shortened the latency of tumor development in the HBx
transgenic mice, the tumors did not have p53 mutations. As in tumors from the
untreated transgenic mice, the p53 tumor suppressor protein is found bound to the
HBx protein and sequestered in the cytoplasmic compartment of the tumor cell.
Despite the frequent involvement of ras mutations in mouse tumors, we also have
not detected activation of the ms p21 protein in the tumors from the
AFB(1)-treated mice. We conclude that although AFB(1) can act as a co-factor with
HBx to induce HCC in mice, its mode of action in vivo remains obscure.
