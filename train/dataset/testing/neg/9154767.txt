BACKGROUND: In patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
infection, aphthous ulceration of the mouth and oropharynx can become extensive
and debilitating. Preliminary reports suggest that thalidomide may promote the
healing of oral aphthous ulcers.
METHODS: We performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of
thalidomide as therapy for oral aphthous ulcers in HIV-infected patients. The
patients received a four-week course of either 200 mg of thalidomide or placebo
orally once per day. They were evaluated weekly for the condition of the ulcers, 
their quality of life, and evidence of toxicity. Assays were performed for plasma
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), soluble TNF-alpha receptors, and HIV
RNA.
RESULTS: Sixteen of 29 patients in the thalidomide group (55 percent) had
complete healing of their aphthous ulcers after four weeks, as compared with only
2 of 28 patients in the placebo group (7 percent; odds ratio, 15; 95 percent
confidence interval after adjustment for group sequential testing, 1.8 to 499;
unadjusted P<0.001). Pain diminished and ability to eat improved with thalidomide
treatment. The adverse effects noted with thalidomide included somnolence and
rash (7 patients each), and 6 of the 29 patients discontinued treatment because
of toxicity. Thalidomide treatment increased HIV RNA levels (median increase,
0.42 log10 copies per milliliter; increase with placebo, 0.05; P=0.04). With
thalidomide treatment there were unexpected increases in the plasma
concentrations of TNF-alpha and soluble TNF-alpha receptors.
CONCLUSIONS: Thalidomide is an effective treatment for aphthous ulceration of the
mouth and oropharynx in patients with HIV infection.
