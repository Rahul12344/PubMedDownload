CONTEXT.—: Infectious gastroenteritis is caused by various pathogens, including
bacteria, viruses, and parasites.
OBJECTIVE.—: To compare the performance of Seegene Allplex Gastrointestinal (24
targets: 13 bacteria, 5 viruses, and 6 parasites in 4 panels), Luminex xTAG
Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel (15 targets: 9 bacteria, 3 viruses, and 3
parasites), and BD MAX Enteric panel (5 bacteria and 3 parasites). We estimated
the agreement among 3 molecular assays.
DESIGN.—: A total of 858 stool samples (554 bacterial/parasite and 304 viral
pathogens) were included. A consensus positive/negative was defined as concordant
results from at least 2 tests. To evaluate the agreement among the assays, κ
value was calculated.
RESULTS.—: The overall positive percentage agreements of Seegene, Luminex, and BD
MAX were 94% (258 of 275), 92% (254 of 275), and 78% (46 of 59), respectfully.
For Salmonella, Luminex showed low negative percentage agreement because of
frequent false positives (n = 31) showing low median fluorescent intensity. For
viruses, positive/negative percentage agreements of Seegene and Luminex were
99%/96% and 93%/99%, respectively. Compared with routine microbiology testing,
Seegene, Luminex, and BD MAX additionally identified 39, 40, and 12 pathogens,
respectively. Sixty-one cases (16 cases with Seegene, 51 cases with Luminex, and 
1 case with BD MAX) showed positive results for multiple pathogens, but only 3
were consensus positive.
CONCLUSIONS.—: These multiplex molecular assays appear to be promising tools for 
the detection and identification of multiple gastrointestinal pathogens
simultaneously. However, careful interpretation of positive results for multiple 
pathogens is required.
