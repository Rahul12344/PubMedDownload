Despite enormous efforts no HIV-1 vaccine has been developed that elicits broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) to protect against infection to date. The high
antigenic diversity and dense N-linked glycan armor, which covers nearly the
entire HIV-1 envelope protein (Env), are major roadblocks for the development of 
bNAbs by vaccination. In addition, the naive human antibody repertoire features a
low frequency of exceptionally long heavy chain complementary determining regions
(CDRH3s), which is a typical characteristic that many HIV-1 bNAbs use to
penetrate the glycan armor. Native-like Env trimer immunogens can induce potent
but strain-specific neutralizing antibody responses in animal models but how to
overcome the many obstacles towards the development of bNAbs remains a challenge.
Here, we review recent HIV-1 Env immunization studies and discuss strategies to
guide strain-specific antibody responses towards neutralization breadth.
