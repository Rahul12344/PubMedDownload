BACKGROUND: Blockade of CD40-CD40 ligand (CD154) costimulatory pathway with
anti-CD154 antibody (Ab) prolongs allograft survival in experimental organ
transplantations; however, repeated agent administration is needed to provide an 
adequate immunosuppression. Seeking for simple and effective approach to
interfere this signaling, we applied adenovirus-mediated gene therapy by encoding
CD40Ig gene (AdCD40Ig).
METHODS: Liver graft from ACI (RT1av1) rat was transplanted orthotopically into
LEW (RT1l) rat, and AdCD40Ig was given to animals via the penile vein immediately
after grafting (n=6).
RESULTS: A single treatment with AdCD40Ig at 1x10(9) plaque forming units induced
specific expression of CD40Ig gene on allograft liver, produced substantial
amount of the protein in the sera, and allowed indefinite graft survival.
Whereas, LEW recipients given no treatment or control adenovirus vector (AdLacZ) 
promptly rejected ACI liver. In addition, AdCD40Ig-treated, long-term survivors
accepted skin graft from the donor strain but not the third party graft.
Histopathology revealed that liver structure of the long-term surviving animals
was completely preserved in normal with no infiltration of mononuclear cells.
CONCLUSION: Blockade of CD40-CD154 pathway by CD40Ig gene therapy is a potent
alloantigen-specific immunosuppressive strategy to induce permanent acceptance of
liver allograft and would be a new therapeutic candidate in a clinical liver
transplantation.
