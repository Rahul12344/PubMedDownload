Antibodies cross-reactive to pathogens and autoantigens are considered pivotal in
both infection control and accompanying autoimmunity. However, the pathogenic
roles of autoantibodies largely remain elusive without a priori knowledge of
disease-specific autoantigens. Here, through a novel quantitative proteogenomics 
approach, we demonstrated a successful identification of immunoglobulin variable 
heavy chain (VH) sequences highly enriched in pathological immune complex from
clinical specimens obtained from a patient with hepatitis C virus-induced
cryoglobulinemia (HCV-CG). Reconstructed single-domain antibodies were reactive
to both HCV antigens and potentially liver-derived human proteins. Moreover, over
the course of antiviral therapy, a substantial "de-evolution" of a distinct
sub-repertoire was discovered, to which proteomically identified
cryoprecipitation-prone autoantibodies belonged. This sub-repertoire was
characterized by IGHJ6*03-derived, long, hydrophobic complementarity determining 
region (CDR-H3). This study provides a proof-of-concept of de novo mining of
autoantibodies and corresponding autoantigen candidates in a disease-specific
context in human, thus facilitating future reverse-translational research for the
discovery of novel biomarkers and the development of antigen-specific
immunotherapy against various autoantibody-related disorders.
