As axons grow past intermediate targets, they change their responsiveness to
guidance cues. Local upregulation of receptor expression is involved, but the
mechanisms for this are not clear. Here protein synthesis is traced within
individual axons by introducing RNAs encoding visualizable reporters. Individual 
severed axons and growth cones can translate proteins and also export them to the
cell surface. As axons reach the spinal cord midline, EphA2 is among the
receptors upregulated on at least some distal axon segments. Midline reporter
upregulation is recapitulated by part of the EphA2 mRNA 3' untranslated region,
which is highly conserved and includes known translational control sequences.
These results show axons contain all the machinery for protein translation and
cell surface expression, and they reveal a potentially general and flexible
RNA-based mechanism for regulation localized within a subregion of the axon.
