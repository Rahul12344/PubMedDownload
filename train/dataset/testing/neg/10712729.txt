Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a key enzyme in the
glycolytic metabolism and the production of energy. This probably explains why
GAPDH was evidenced as a major therapeutical target in several parasitic
diseases; either as a vaccine candidate or as a target for chemotherapeutic
treatments. Schistosoma mansoni GAPDH (Sm37-GAPDH) is one of the main schistosome
vaccine candidates. The production of recombinant Sm37-GAPDH is essential to
evaluate the ability of this molecule to induce protective immunity in animals
and possibly in humans. The cDNA encoding Sm37-GAPDH has been cloned and
sequenced. In addition, five B cell (including the major B-cell epitope Sm35-5)
and two T cell epitopes have been localized on the molecule. Different expression
systems have been evaluated in respect with the production yield and the GAPDH
enzymatic activity. Some of them have led to either a high production of
insoluble material (E. coli) or to an inactive enzyme (Pischia pastoris). The
present article describes the production setting of rSm37-GAPDH using the
baculovirus-insect cell system. Large amounts of soluble rSm37-GAPDH with
enzymatic activity were obtained. Most sera from individuals living in an area
endemic for S. mansoni recognised the rSm37 molecule and inhibited its catalytic 
activity.
