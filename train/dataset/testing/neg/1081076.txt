Bacteriophage MS-2 in the immune response.

Snippe H, de Reuver MJ, Belder M, Willers JM.

Several aspects of the immune response to bacteriophage MS-2 were studied. In
thymectomized, irradiated and bone marrow-reconstituted (TXBM) mice, the response
was normal when a high dose of antigen was used. With a 50-fold lower dose of
MS-2, the response was impaired, indicating a T-cell involvement in antibody
formation. More evidence for the (partial) T-cell dependence of MS-2 was obtained
from experiments with anti-thymocyte serum or cyclophosphamide-treated mice.
(3H)-thymidine incorporation experiments demonstrated that both B and T cells
were active upon in vitro stimulation with MS-2. The dose of MS-2 which was able 
to induce a normal response in TXBM mice, proved to be optimal for both
sensitization and elicitation of a DH. It is concluded that MS-2 is a
thymus-dependent antigen which is only thymus independent in high doses.
