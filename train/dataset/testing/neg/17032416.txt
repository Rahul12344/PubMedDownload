BACKGROUND/AIM: Pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN) plus ribavirin is the standard
therapy for hepatitis C. Peg-IFN has several antiviral mechanisms, but its role
in hepatitis C treatment seems to be related to its immunomodulatory effect.
Ribavirin, an antiviral agent, potentiates IFN activity when added to it. Both
drugs are associated with adverse reactions of different magnitudes. Autoimmune
phenomena have been reported with this treatment. In this paper, we describe
cases of ALT/GGT flares during Peg-IFN plus ribavirin treatment, which related to
the appearance of anti-Golgi antibody and disease progress.
METHODS: We investigated three patients with hepatitis C and severe ALT/GGT
flares during Peg-IFN and ribavirin treatment coinciding with anti-Golgi complex 
antibody as the only marker of autoimmunity. We then reviewed the medical files
and tested anti-Golgi antibody in stored sera from 25 patients treated with
conventional IFN and in 14 patients treated with Peg-IFN.
RESULTS: The three patients were male, over 45 years of age; all were relapsers
and non-responders. Anti-Golgi antibody was positive during treatment coinciding 
with ALT/GGT flares but with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA negativity, disappearing
after stopping treatment, with normalization of ALT/AST levels. One patient had
progression of fibrosis from F2 to F3 despite negativity of HCV-RNA. In the last 
group, only two patients treated with Peg-IFN experienced ALT/GGT flares but
without anti-Golgi antibody
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of anti-Golgi complex antibody could be a marker of a
temporary autoimmune phenomenon and progressive disease.
