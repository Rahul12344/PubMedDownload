The serum of 387 hemodialysis patients from 9 dialysis units was checked for
anti-hepatitis C virus antibodies with a 1st-generation ELISA (Ortho) test: 61
patients were repeatedly positive. In order to avoid false-positive results,
these sera were tested with a 1st-generation confirmatory RIBA test,
2nd-generation screening ELISA test and 2nd-generation confirmatory RIBA test.
The 2nd-generation ELISA test confirmed data obtained with 1st-generation ELISA, 
however, the 1st-generation confirmatory RIBA test underestimated the number of
anti-HCV-positive patients.
