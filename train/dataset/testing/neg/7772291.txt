This review summarizes several recent developments in Salmonella genetics; some
of the procedures described can be easily adapted to Escherichia coli and have
also potential applications in non-enteric bacteria. The novel methods outlined
include genetic mapping procedures, ancillary tools for cloning, a strategy for
analyzing DNA-protein interactions in vivo, a method for plasmid curing and a
procedure for the detection of bacterial virulence genes.
