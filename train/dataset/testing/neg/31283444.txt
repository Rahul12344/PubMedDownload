Persistent viral infections require a host cell reservoir that maintains
functional copies of the viral genome. To this end, several DNA viruses maintain 
their genomes as extrachromosomal DNA minichromosomes in actively dividing cells.
These viruses typically encode a viral protein that binds specifically to viral
DNA genomes and tethers them to host mitotic chromosomes, thus enabling the viral
genomes to hitchhike or piggyback into daughter cells. Viruses that use this
tethering mechanism include papillomaviruses and the gammaherpesviruses
Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. This review
describes the advantages and consequences of persistent extrachromosomal viral
genome replication.
