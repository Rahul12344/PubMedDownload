Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has transformed HIV-1 infection from
an invariably fatal disease into a chronic infection requiring lifelong
treatment. However, the challenges we still face are the urgent need to provide
affordable sustainable therapy to the millions of infected individuals who live
in resource-poor countries, and the limitations posed by serious drug toxicity
and viral resistance associated with long-term therapy. Augmentation of
HIV-specific immunity by therapeutic vaccination is a possible alternative to
continuous HAART. In this review, progress in the development of therapeutic
immunization strategies is discussed.
