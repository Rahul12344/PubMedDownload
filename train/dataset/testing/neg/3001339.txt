Repression of adenovirus early gene expression by coinfection with a
temperature-sensitive mutant in the immediate-early gene of pseudorabies virus.

Feldman LT, Ahlers SE.

Wild-type adenovirus was coinfected with a mutant temperature sensitive for the
immediate-early gene of pseudorabies virus. At the nonpermissive temperature,
this mutant, tsG, strongly inhibited the transcription of all adenovirus early
genes, including E1A. This inhibition was not observed with wild-type
pseudorabies virus coinfection or with tsG coinfection at the permissive
temperature. The level of repression was dependent upon the ratio of tsG to
adenovirus in the infection. The results suggest that the temperature-sensitive
protein may be interacting with transcription factors on the viral DNA or with
the DNA itself to inhibit adenovirus transcription.
