The c-abl tyrosine kinase is the proto-oncogene of the v-abl oncogene of the
Abelson murine leukemia virus. Although mutational variants of c-Abl can exhibit 
gain of function and can produce a transformed phenotype, the function of c-Abl
in transformation remained unclear. Here, we report that the loss of c-abl
facilitates transformation. c-abl-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)
immortalized by SV40 T antigen acquired anchorage-independent growth, and by
constructing mutational variants of T antigen we showed that binding of large T
antigen to p53 and RB was necessary to induce anchorage-independent growth.
Although c-abl/p53 double-knockout MEFs did not undergo anchorage-independent
growth, those expressing human papilloma virus 16 E7, which mainly inactivates
RB, did. Our results show that the loss of c-abl facilitates
anchorage-independent growth in the context of p53 and RB deficiency, and suggest
that loss of function of c-abl facilitates some types of transformation.
