Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus
(PEDV) are major etiological agents of diarrhea and death in piglets. Multiplex
real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was developed for simultaneous
differential quantification of each virus in a single reaction tube, using Cy5-
and FAM-labeled TaqMan-probes based on sequences from the TGEV and PEDV
nucleocapsid genes. The copy numbers for transcripts of TGEV and PEDV were
quantified using this assay over a range from 9x10(7) to 9x10(1) copies and
7x10(7) to 7x10(1) copies, respectively. The variability of the intra-assay and
inter-assay were evaluated using standard solutions of each transcript, with
coefficients of variation (CV) less than 3.43 and 3.33%, respectively. Piglets
were experimentally infected with virulent TGEV and PEDV, and the amounts of
virus from the onset of diarrhea were measured. Samples obtained from farms
experiencing PED or TGE were quantified between 10(2) and 10(5) RNA copies. In
conclusion, this assay provides an effective etiological diagnostic tool for
detecting and quantifying viral loads. The assay may also prove useful for
detecting infections, ultimately leading to better disease control on farms.
