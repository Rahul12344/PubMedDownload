Translation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage PP7 RNA by a cell-free amino 
acid incorporating system from Escherichia coli.

We have compared the activities of the RNA genomes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa
phage PP7 and coliphages Qbeta and f2 in a cell-free amino acid incorporating
system derived from Escherichia coli. The rate of incorporation of [(14)C]leucine
in the PP7 RNA-directed system is greater than in the systems directed by either 
Qbeta or f2 RNA. The response to changes in phage RNA concentrations is similar
in all the systems, reaching a saturation level at 0.75 to 1.0 mg of RNA per ml
of reaction mixture. Analysis of complete reaction mixtures of the PP7 RNA and of
the Qbeta RNA systems by sucrose gradient centrifugation shows generally similar 
patterns for both RNAs. The principal differences are that in the PP7 system a
slightly higher percentage of RNA forms ribosome complexes and that the polysomes
are somewhat smaller. PP7 RNA is also degraded more extensively during the
reaction than is Qbeta RNA. Analysis of the products of the reactions by
acrylamide gel electrophoresis shows that PP7 coat protein is the only
identifiable product of the PP7 RNA-directed system, suggesting that only the
coat protein cistron is translated by E. coli ribosomes.
