Numerous monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that recognize and neutralize infectious
pathogens have been isolated and developed over the years. The fact that
infectious diseases can involve large populations of infected individuals is an
important factor that has motivated the search for both cost-effective and
scalable methods of antibody production. The current technologies for production 
of antibodies in plants allow for very rapid expression and evaluation that can
also be readily scaled for multikilogram production runs. In addition, recent
progress in manipulating glycosylation in plant production systems has allowed
for the evaluation of antibodies containing glycans that are nearly homogeneous, 
are mammalian in structure, and have enhanced neutralizing capabilities. Among
the anti-infectious disease antibodies that have been produced in plants are
included those intended for prevention or treatment of anthrax, Clostridium
perfringens, Ebola virus, human immunodeficiency virus, herpes simplex virus,
rabies, respiratory syncytial virus, staphylococcal enterotoxin, West Nile virus,
and tooth decay. Animal and human efficacy data for these MAbs are discussed.
