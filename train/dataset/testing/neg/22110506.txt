To establish a persistent latent infection, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) faces a
challenge in that the virus-infected host cell must transit through the germinal 
centre reaction. This is a site of B cell differentiation where antibody
responses are optimised, and the selection criteria for B cells are stringent.
The germinal centre environment is harsh, and the vast majority of B cells here
die by apoptosis. Only cells receiving adequate survival signals will
differentiate fully to be released into the periphery as long-term memory B cells
(the site of persistence). In this review, we detail the apoptotic pathways
potentially encountered by EBV-infected B cells during the process of infection, 
and we describe the functions of those EBV-regulated cellular and viral genes
that help promote survival of the host B cell.
