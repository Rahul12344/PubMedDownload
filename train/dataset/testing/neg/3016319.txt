Physical and genetic characterization of the genome of Lactobacillus lactis
bacteriophage LL-H.

Bacteriophage LL-H is a virulent phage of Lactobacillus lactis LL23. A
restriction map of the phage genome was constructed with various restriction
endonucleases. This chromosome has a 34-kilobase size and seems to be circularly 
permuted. We used a bank of LL-H restriction fragments to study the expression of
five of the seven main phage particle proteins. Immunoblotting experiments
permitted the mapping on the chromosome of several genes coding for phage
particle proteins. We also show that the gene of the main capsid protein is
expressed from its own promoter in an Escherichia coli strain.
