Interaction of protein synthesis initiation factors with mRNA has been studied in
order to characterize early events in the eukaryotic translation pathway.
Individual reovirus mRNAs labeled with 32P in the alpha position relative to the 
m7G cap and eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-4A, -4B, and -4F purified from
rabbit reticulocytes were employed. It was found that eIF-4A causes a structural 
change in mRNA, as evidenced by a nuclease sensitivity test: addition of high
concentrations of eIF-4A greatly increase the nuclease sensitivity of the mRNA,
suggesting that this factor can melt or "unwind" mRNA structure. ATP is required 
for this reaction. At low concentrations of eIF-4A, addition of eIF-4B is
required for maximal unwinding activity. Thus eIF-4B enhances eIF-4A activity.
Addition of eIF-4F also makes the mRNA sensitive to nuclease indicating a similar
unwinding role to that of eIF-4A. Stoichiometric comparisons indicate that eIF-4F
is more than 20-fold more efficient than eIF-4A in catalyzing this reaction. The 
unwinding activity of eIF-4F is inhibited by m7GDP, while that of eIF-4A is not. 
This suggests that eIF-4A functions independent of the 5' cap structure. Our
results also suggest that the unwinding activity of eIF-4F is located in the
46,000-dalton polypeptide of this complex, which has shown by others to be
similar or identical to eIF-4A.
