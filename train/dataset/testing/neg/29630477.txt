The purified whole-virus proteins derived from A/swine/Shanghai/1/2014 (H1N1)
(SH1) were chosen to immunize BALB/c mice to prepare the monoclonal antibody
(MAb) against hemagglutinin (HA) protein of an European avian-like (EA) H1N1
swine influenza virus (SIV). After cloning three times by limiting dilution, one 
strain of hybridoma cells named 3C7 secreting anti-HA protein MAb was obtained by
hybridoma technique. The results of indirect immunofluorescence assay and western
blot analyses showed that the MAb 3C7 specifically reacted with the HA protein of
EA H1N1 SIV. This work indicated that the MAb 3C7 would be a valuable tool as a
specific diagnostic reagent for SIV epidemiological surveys and identification of
HA protein epitopes of the EA H1N1 SIVs in the future.
