With the increasing prevalence of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the
possibility of a transmission of HIV via allogenic transplants has increased. To 
assess the risk of transferring HIV with allogenic cartilage grafts we
investigated the susceptibility of chondrocytes to the virus. Our results
indicate the absence of the HIV receptor (CD-4-molecule) on chondrocytes by
immunohistochemistry and FACS analyses. Furthermore cultures from chondrocytes
and high doses of HIV-1 did not show an active replication. Hence, we conclude
that normal cartilage cells cannot be infected by HIV. This means that the risk
of HIV transmission by cartilage allografts is very low if no contaminating
tissues like blood, perichondrium and calcifications etc. are present.
