The high immunogenicity of recombinant adenoviral vectors is one of the major
issues in the field of gene therapy. Adenoviral-based vectors are susceptible
both to cytotoxic T-lymphocyte and humoral immune responses. In addition, leaky
adenoviral genes also render transduced cells susceptible to host immune
responses. These are the main reasons why adenoviral-based vectors are not
suitable to correct genetic disorders, which require long-term expression of the 
transgene. Another limit to long-term transgene expression is posed by the fact
that adenoviral-based vectors do not integrate their genome into the cellular
chromosomal DNA of transduced cell populations. As it stands, adenoviral-mediated
gene transfer is a promising tool for cancer therapy and for genetic immunization
programs against infectious diseases, provided that host immune responses are
carefully controlled.
