The history of influenza pandemics was reviewed and clinical manifestations of
pneumonia associated with influenza virus infections are described. Several types
of pneumonia associated with the influenza virus infection have been reported: 1)
influenza complicated by secondary bacterial pneumonia, 2) primary influenza
virus pneumonia, 3) combined influenza virus and bacterial pneumonia. Secondary
bacterial pneumonia often produces a syndrome that is clinically distinguishable 
from that of primary viral pneumonia. In primary influenza virus pneumonia, chest
roentgenography revealed bilateral infiltrations but no consolidation.
Histologically, diffuse alveolar damage and hemorrhagic bronchiolitis were
frequently observed in primary influenza virus pneumonia, in which case the
prognosis was the worst. Although rare, the possibility of bronchiolitis
obliterans organizing pneumonia associated with influenza virus infection should 
be recognized. H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, or S. aureus were frequently
associated with influenza viral infection, and treatment against these bacteria
should be considered.
