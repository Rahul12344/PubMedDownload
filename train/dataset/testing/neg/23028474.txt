BACKGROUND: The majority of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic
(transmissible between animals and humans) in origin, and therefore integrated
surveillance of disease events in humans and animals has been recommended to
support effective global response to disease emergence. While in the past decade 
there has been extensive global surveillance for highly pathogenic avian
influenza (HPAI) infection in both animals and humans, there have been few
attempts to compare these data streams and evaluate the utility of such
integration.
METHODOLOGY: We compared reports of bird outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 in Egypt for
2006-2011 compiled by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the UN
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) EMPRESi reporting system with confirmed
human H5N1 cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) for Egypt during
the same time period.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Both human cases and bird outbreaks showed a cyclic pattern
for the country as a whole, and there was a statistically significant temporal
correlation between the data streams. At the governorate level, the first
outbreak in birds in a season usually but not always preceded the first human
case, and the time lag between events varied widely, suggesting regional
differences in zoonotic risk and/or surveillance effectiveness. In a multivariate
risk model, lower temperature, lower urbanization, higher poultry density, and
the recent occurrence of a bird outbreak were associated with increased risk of a
human case of HPAI in the same governorate, although the positive predictive
value of a bird outbreak was low.
CONCLUSIONS: Integrating data streams of surveillance for human and animal cases 
of zoonotic disease holds promise for better prediction of disease risk and
identification of environmental and regional factors that can affect risk. Such
efforts can also point out gaps in human and animal surveillance systems and
generate hypotheses regarding disease transmission.
