Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed human B lymphoblastoid cells share certain
properties with monocytes: they are capable of presenting protein antigens to
antigen-specific T-lymphocytes and of releasing an Interleukin 1-like factor. It 
was our interest to study whether transformed B-cells resemble monocytes by
generating toxic oxygen radicals. Human B-cell lines were developed from human
peripheral blood lymphocytes by EBV-transformation. The induction of the
respiratory burst in the B-cells was assessed by chemiluminescence (CL) in the
presence of lucigenin. B-cells were stimulated with phorbol-myristate-acetate
(PMA), zymosan particles, the chemotactic peptide f-met-phe, the complement split
product C5a and with a recently described granulocyte activating cytokine (GRAM).
Stimulation with PMA elicited a distinct CL-response in the tested B-cell lines. 
The CL-signal was significantly reduced by superoxide dismutase, but not by
D-mannitol and catalase. No significant response to any of the other stimuli was 
detected. Furthermore, none of the stimuli induced a luminol-enhanced CL signal, 
which, in contrast to lucigenin, is dependent on the presence of peroxidase. Our 
results indicate that EBV infected B-cells were able to generate significant
amounts of reactive oxygen species, particularly superoxide. It appears that
virus transformation uncovers genetic information which is usually not expressed 
in non-transformed B-cells.
