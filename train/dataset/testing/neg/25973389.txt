OBJECTIVE: Pancreatic beta-cells express three Munc18 isoforms. Much is known
about the roles of Munc18a (pre-docked secretory granules-SGs) and Munc18b
(newcomer SGs and SG-SG fusion) in insulin exocytosis. Although shown to
influence glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in rodents the precise role
of Munc18c in insulin SG exocytosis has not been elucidated. We here examined the
role of Munc18c in human pancreatic beta-cells.
METHODS: Munc18c-shRNA/RFP lenti-virus (versus control virus) was used to knock
down the expression level of Munc18c in human islets or single beta-cells.
Insulin secretion and granule exocytosis were measured by performing islets
perifusion, single-cell patch clamp capacitance measurements and total internal
reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM).
RESULTS: Munc18c is most abundant in the cytosol of human beta-cells. Endogenous 
function of Munc18c was assessed by knocking down (KD) its islet expression by
70% employing lenti-shRNA virus. Munc18c-KD caused reduction in cognate
syntaxin-4 islet expression but not in other exocytotic proteins, resulting in
the reduction in GSIS in first- (by 42%) and second phases (by 35%). Single cell 
analyses of RFP-tagged Munc18c-KD beta-cells by patch clamp capacitance
measurements showed inhibition in both readily-releasable pool (by 52%) and
mobilization from the reserve pool (by 57%). TIRFM to assess single SG behavior
showed that Munc18c-KD inhibition of first phase GSIS was attributed to reduction
in exocytosis of pre-docked and newcomer SGs, and second phase inhibition
attributed entirely to reduction in newcomer SG fusion (SGs that undergo minimal 
residence or docking time at the plasma membrane before fusion).
CONCLUSION: Munc18c is involved in the distinct molecular machineries that affect
exocytosis of both predocked and newcomer SG pools that underlie Munc18c's role
in first and second phases of GSIS, respectively.
