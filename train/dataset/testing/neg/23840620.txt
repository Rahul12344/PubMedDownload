OBJECTIVES: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging pathogen. We evaluated the
seroprevalence of HEV infection among swine farmers and the general population in
Taiwan, a nonendemic country.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional seroepidemiologic study in rural Taiwan
in 2012 and 2013. The study included swine farmers, health examination attendees,
pregnant women, and students. A commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was 
used to detect immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM against HEV. Pertinent information 
was collected using a questionnaire.
RESULTS: In total, 660 participants were enrolled in the study, including 156
swine farmers, 314 health examination attendees, 100 pregnant women, and 90
students. IgG anti-HEV was detected in 29.5% of swine farmers, 11.5% of health
examination attendees, 2% of pregnant women, and 1.1% of students. Two subjects
were positive for IgM anti-HEV. Logistic regression analysis revealed that swine 
farmers had an approximately 3.5-fold increased risk (odds ratio [OR], 3.46; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.91-6.27; p<0.0001) for being seropositive for IgG
anti-HEV as compared to the general population. Age was positively associated
with seropositive rate (OR, 1.07 per year; 95% CI, 1.05-1.09; p<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: HEV infection is prevalent in Taiwan. The seroprevalence of HEV
infection is high in swine farmers and in the elderly population.
