The RNase protection assay is a standard approach to determine mRNA levels of a
gene of interest in different tissues, developmental stages, or times of the day.
Splicing or promoter variants can be studied with specific probes. It is widely
used in chronobiology to study the temporal profile of expression of circadian
genes and the effects of genetic manipulation on these oscillations. Methods to
generate the riboprobes and to perform the RNase protection assay itself are
described in this chapter.
