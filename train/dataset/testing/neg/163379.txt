Detection of a virus-specific antigen on the surface of herpes simplex
virus-transformed cells.

Reed CL, Cohen GH, Rapp F.

A virion-associated antigen, CP-1, was detected on the surface of hamster cells
after transformation by inactivated herpes simplex virus type 1. Presence of the 
CP-1 antigen on the cells correlates with the synthesis of antibody by
tumorbearing hamsters capable of neutralizing both herpes simplex virus types 1
and 2.
