Orf (contagious ecthyma) is an exanthematic disease caused by a parapoxvirus and 
occurs primarily in sheep and goats with zoonotic implications. In the present
investigation, an orf outbreak in the Muzzaffarnagari sheep flock at the Central 
Institute for Research on Goats (CIRG), Makhdoom, Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, India, 
was investigated. Primary goat testes cell culture was used for isolation of the 
orf virus (ORFV) for the first time. The identity of the virus was confirmed by
amplification and sequence analysis of the major envelope glycoprotein (B2L) gene
and named ORFV/sheep/India/2012/CIRG. On phylogenetic analysis of B2L protein
gene, it clustered with the ORFV strains from China suggesting distinct ORFV
strains are circulating in India. On comparison of nucleotide and deduced amino
acid sequence analysis (n = 63), a unique 126S residue was observed in
ORFV/sheep/India/2012/CIRG. On further sequence analysis (B2L) of different ORFV 
strains (n = 63), some conserved amino acid residues were identified as
host-specific (sheep, human, camel, takin, and musk ox) and have been summarized.
