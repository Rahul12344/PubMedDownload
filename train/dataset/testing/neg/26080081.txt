Macacine herpesvirus 1 (MaHV1; B virus) naturally infects macaques (Macaca spp.) 
and can cause fatal encephalitis in humans. In Peninsular Malaysia, wild macaques
are abundant, and translocation is used to mitigate human-macaque conflict. Most 
adult macaques are infected with MaHV1, although the risk for transmission to
persons who handle them during capture and translocation is unknown. We
investigated MaHV1 shedding among 392 long-tailed macaques (M. fascicularis)
after capture and translocation by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks 
in Peninsular Malaysia, during 2009-2011. For detection of MaHV1 DNA, PCR was
performed on urogenital and oropharyngeal swab samples. Overall, 39% of macaques 
were shedding MaHV1 DNA; rates of DNA detection did not differ between sample
types. This study demonstrates that MaHV1 was shed by a substantial proportion of
macaques after capture and transport and suggests that persons handling macaques 
under these circumstances might be at risk for exposure to MaHV1.
