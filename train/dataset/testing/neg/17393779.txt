OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of adenovirus-mediated PTEN and P27 on the 
invasion of PC-3 in vitro and angiogenesis, along with their synergy in the
treatment of prostate cancer.
METHODS: Recombinant adenovirus vectors of the human tumor suppressor genes PTEN 
and P27 were constructed. The replication-incompetent recombinant adenovirus was 
packaged and propagated in HEK293 cells. The viral titer was examined by plaque
assay and the mRNA and protein expressions of PTEN and P27 in human prostate
cancer cell line PC-3 infected with Ad-PTEN and Ad-P27 were determined by RT-PCR 
and Western blot respectively. The invasion of PC-3 cells in vitro was examined
by Boyden chamber assay. MTT assay was used to testify the effect of supernatant 
from PC-3 infected with Ad-PTEN and Ad-P27 on the proliferation of endothelial
cells ECV-304 and the CAM test was used to testify the effect of PTEN and P27 on 
angiogenesis. The difference between the combined therapy group and the single
gene therapy group was also examined.
RESULTS: The viral titers of Ad-PTEN and Ad-P27 were 1.8 x 10(7) pfu/ml and 1.2 x
10(9) pfu/ml respectively. Adenovirus infection verified that the mRNA and
protein expression of PTEN and P27 were steady in human PC-3 cells. The invasion 
in vitro of PC-3 cells was significantly inhibited by infection with Ad-PTEN
or/and Ad-P27. CAM and MTT assays of ECV-304 confirmed that the supernatant from 
PC-3 cells infected with Ad-PTEN or/and Ad-P27 could inhibit the angiogenesis
effectively. There was a significant difference between the combined therapy
group and the single gene therapy group.
CONCLUSION: The combined gene therapy of Ad-PTEN and Ad-P27 plays a synergistic
role in inhibiting the invasiveness of PC-3 cells and angiogenesis.
