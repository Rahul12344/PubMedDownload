Glycoprotein D (gD) of herpes simplex virus type 1 is a type 1 membrane protein
in the virus envelope that binds to receptor molecules on the cell surface and
which induces cell-cell fusion when co-expressed with gB, gH and gL. A chimeric
gD molecule in which the membrane anchor and cytoplasmic tail domains were
replaced with analogous regions from the human CD8 molecule was as competent as
wild-type gD at mediating membrane fusion and virus entry. However, when gD was
tethered to the membrane by means of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi)-anchor 
sequence, which binds only to the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer, it was
unable to function in cell-cell fusion assays. This chimera was incorporated into
virions as efficiently as wild-type gD and yet virus particles containing
gpi-linked gD entered cells more slowly than virions containing wild-type gD in
their envelopes, suggesting that gD must be anchored in both leaflets of a lipid 
bilayer for it to function in both cell fusion and virus entry.
