BACKGROUND: While safer than their viral counterparts, conventional non-viral
gene delivery DNA vectors offer a limited safety profile. They often result in
the delivery of unwanted prokaryotic sequences, antibiotic resistance genes, and 
the bacterial origins of replication to the target, which may lead to the
stimulation of unwanted immunological responses due to their chimeric DNA
composition. Such vectors may also impart the potential for chromosomal
integration, thus potentiating oncogenesis. We sought to engineer an in vivo
system for the quick and simple production of safer DNA vector alternatives that 
were devoid of non-transgene bacterial sequences and would lethally disrupt the
host chromosome in the event of an unwanted vector integration event.
RESULTS: We constructed a parent eukaryotic expression vector possessing a
specialized manufactured multi-target site called "Super Sequence", and
engineered E. coli cells (R-cell) that conditionally produce phage-derived
recombinase Tel (PY54), TelN (N15), or Cre (P1). Passage of the parent plasmid
vector through R-cells under optimized conditions, resulted in rapid, efficient, 
and one step in vivo generation of mini lcc--linear covalently closed
(Tel/TelN-cell), or mini ccc--circular covalently closed (Cre-cell), DNA
constructs, separated from the backbone plasmid DNA. Site-specific integration of
lcc plasmids into the host chromosome resulted in chromosomal disruption and
10(5) fold lower viability than that seen with the ccc counterpart.
CONCLUSION: We offer a high efficiency mini DNA vector production system that
confers simple, rapid and scalable in vivo production of mini lcc DNA vectors
that possess all the benefits of "minicircle" DNA vectors and virtually eliminate
the potential for undesirable vector integration events.
