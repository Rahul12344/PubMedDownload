Feline caliciviruses (FCVs) have occasionally been described in cats in
association with enteric disease, but an etiological role for these viruses in
acute gastroenteritis is still unclear. In this study, molecular characterization
of FCV and feline norovirus (FNoV) was undertaken using real-time PCR (RT-PCR)
and sequence analysis of the ORF1 region in fecal specimens from 29 diarrheic
cats. The specimens were also screened for parvovirus, coronavirus, astrovirus
and group A rotavirus. A quantitative one step RT-PCR was also performed to
detect and quantitate NoV genogroup IV and the role of these animal caliciviruses
in feline gastroenteritis was investigated. This is the first description of
enteric FCV and FNoV in South America.
