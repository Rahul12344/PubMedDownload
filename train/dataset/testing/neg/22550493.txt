Certain infectious agents are associated with lymphomas, but the strength of the 
association varies geographically, suggesting that local environmental factors
make important contributions to lymphomagenesis. Endemic Burkitt's Lymphoma has
well-defined environmental requirements making it particularly suitable for
research into local environmental factors. The Epstein-Barr virus and holoendemic
Malaria are recognized as important cofactors in endemic Burkitt's Lymphoma and
their contributions are discussed. Additionally, infection with Chikungunya
Fever, a potentially oncogenic arbovirus, was associated with the onset of
endemic Burkitt's Lymphoma in one study and also with space-time case clusters of
the lymphoma. Chikungunya Virus has several characteristics typical of oncogenic 
viruses. The Flavivirus, Hepatitis C, a Class 1 Human Carcinogen, closely related
to the arboviruses, Yellow Fever, and Dengue, is also more distantly related to
Chikungunya Virus. The mechanisms of oncogenesis believed to operate in Hepatitis
C lymphomagenesis are discussed, as is their potential applicability to
Chikungunya Virus.
