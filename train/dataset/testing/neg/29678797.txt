Pregnancy is associated with modulations of maternal immunity that contribute to 
foeto-maternal tolerance. To understand whether and how these alterations impact 
antiviral immunity, a detailed cross-sectional analysis of selective pressures
exerted on HIV-1 envelope amino-acid sequences was performed in a group of
pregnant (n = 32) and non-pregnant (n = 44) HIV-infected women in absence of
treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Independent of HIV-1 subtype,
p-distance, dN and dS were all strongly correlated with one another but were not 
significantly different in pregnant as compared to non-pregnant patients.
Differential levels of selective pressure applied on different Env subdomains
displayed similar yet non-identical patterns between the two groups, with
pressure applied on C1 being significantly lower in constant regions C1 and C2
than in V1, V2, V3 and C3. To draw a general picture of the selection applied on 
the envelope and compensate for inter-individual variations, we performed a
binomial test on selection frequency data pooled from pregnant and non-pregnant
women. This analysis uncovered 42 positions, present in both groups, exhibiting
statistically-significant frequency of selection that invariably mapped to the
surface of the Env protein, with the great majority located within epitopes
recognized by Env-specific antibodies or sites associated with the development of
cross-reactive neutralizing activity. The median frequency of occurrence of
positive selection per site was significantly lower in pregnant versus
non-pregnant women. Furthermore, examination of the distribution of positively
selected sites using a hypergeometric test revealed that only 2 positions (D137
and S142) significantly differed between the 2 groups. Taken together, these
result indicate that pregnancy is associated with subtle yet distinctive changes 
in selective pressures exerted on the HIV-1 Env protein that are compatible with 
transient modulations of maternal immunity.
