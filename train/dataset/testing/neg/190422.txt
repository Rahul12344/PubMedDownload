Viruses isolated from captive and free-ranging wild ruminants in Alberta.

Thorsen J, Karstad L, Barrett MW, Chalmers GA.

Nasal secretions, leukocytes and preputial or vaginal swabs from a group of 15
captive wild ruminants, comprising six pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra
americana), seven fallow deer (Dama dama) and two mule deer (Odocoileus
hemionus), and from 50 free-ranging pronghorns in southern Alberta, were examined
for viral agents. Captive animals were given injections of dexamethasone daily
for 6 days in attempts to reactivate latent infections. Specimens were collected 
at 2-3 day intervals from days 0 to 18. Free-ranging pronghorns were sampled only
once, at the time of capture. Fifteen viral isolates were obtained from the
animals: six isolates of parainfluenza 3 (PI3) from nasal swabs from one fallow
deer and one mule deer; five isolates of herpesvirus from leukocytes, vaginal,
preputial and nasal swabs from three fallow deer; and four isolates of PI3 from
nasal secretions of the 50 free-ranging pronghorns.
