Structure-anti HIV activity relationships were established for a sample of 80
1-[2-hydroxyethoxy-methyl]-6-(phenylthio)thymine (HEPT) using a three-layer
neural network (NN). Eight structural descriptors and physicochemical variables
were used to characterize the HEPT derivatives under study. The network's
architecture and parameters were optimized in order to obtain good results. All
the NN architectures were able to establish a satisfactory relationship between
the molecular descriptors and the anti-HIV activity. NN proved to give better
results than other models in the literature. NN have been shown to be
particularly successful in their ability to identify non-linear relationships.
