Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) variants with reduced in vitro
sensitivity to zidovudine, conferred by specific mutations in the viral reverse
transcriptase, emerge during prolonged therapy. Late-stage disease and declining 
CD4 cell count are associated with more rapid emergence of these resistant
variants. Isolates of HIV-1 from seroconverters were screened for the
zidovudine-resistance marker mutation at codon 215. HIV-1 with the altered
genotype was detected in 5 (8.2%) of 61 patients soon after onset of symptomatic 
primary illness and from the sex partner of 1 patient. These transmitted
resistant viruses were either replaced by strains susceptible to zidovudine
within a few months of infection or persisted for up to 1 year in the absence of 
prolonged zidovudine therapy. The resistant genotype persisted in 3 of 5
seroconverters but in 2 patients had reverted to wild type at 48 and 52 weeks.
Primary infection with zidovudine-resistant variants of HIV-1 was not associated 
with a more severe symptomatic primary illness or more rapid CD4 cell decline at 
1 year after infection.
