Genetic analysis of simian virus 40. 3. Characterization of a
temperature-sensitive mutant blocked at an early stage of productive infection in
monkey cells.

Robb JA, Martin RG.

A temperature-sensitive mutant of simian virus 40 (SV40), ts(*)101, has been
characterized during productive infection in monkey kidney cells. The mutant
virion can adsorb to and penetrate the cell normally at the restrictive
temperature, but cannot induce the synthesis of cellular deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) nor initiate the synthesis of SV40-specific tumor, virion, or U antigens or
viral DNA. First-cycle infection with purified ts(*)101 DNA is normal at the
restrictive temperature, but the resulting progeny virions are still
temperature-sensitive. The mutant neither complements nor inhibits other
temperature-sensitive SV40 mutants or wild-type virions. The affected protein in 
the ts(*)101 mutant may be a regulatory structural protein, possibly a core
protein, that is interacting with the viral DNA.
