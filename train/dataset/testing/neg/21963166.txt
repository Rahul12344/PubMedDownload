Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), a low-grade malignancy that is associated with human
herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), is a multifocal tumor that most commonly affects
mucocutaneous sites. It might also involve lymph nodes and visceral organs, in
particular of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, but it can affect every
organ system. Four forms of the disease have been recognized: the classic, the
endemic, the transplant-associated, and the epidemic form. The endemic form, or
African KS, currently accounts for 10%-50% of all cancers in adults and up to 25%
of cancers in children in certain parts of Africa. The epidemic form or acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated KS is a frequent neoplasm in
bisexual and homosexual men with AIDS in the United States. Even though in North 
America and Europe the incidence of KS in men with AIDS has decreased
significantly after the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy
(HAART), in some developing countries, the incidence of KS keeps growing. The
pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, imaging findings, and more relevant
differential diagnoses are reviewed.
