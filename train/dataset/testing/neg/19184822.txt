Avian leukosis virus of subgroup J (ALV-J), isolated in the late 1980s,
predominantly causes myelocytic myeloid leukosis in meat-type chickens. In the
past few years, we have observed the occurrence of lesions indicative of
erythroblastosis in ALV-J-infected flocks and, in this paper, we report the
isolation of ALV-J strains from such flocks. Three of these isolates were acutely
transforming viruses, as shown by their ability to transform bone marrow cell
cultures. The bone marrow cultures transformed by these virus isolates were very 
similar to the myeloid cells transformed by the ALV-J strain 966. However, the
infection of meat-type chickens with these isolates either as embryos or as
1-day-old chicks resulted in the induction of erythroblastosis as well as
myelocytomatosis. Other histopathological changes observed in the inoculated
birds included neoplastic lesions such as cholangioma and testicular cell tumour,
and non-neoplastic lesions such as lymphomyeloid hyperplasia. This report
demonstrates that highly oncogenic ALV-J, capable of inducing a different
spectrum of disease other than the widely reported myelocytomatosis, could be
established in naturally infected flocks.
