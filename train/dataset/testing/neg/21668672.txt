BACKGROUND: Obesity has been identified as an independent risk factor for severe 
or fatal infection with 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza (2009 pH1N1), but was not
previously recognized for previous pandemic or seasonal influenza infections.
OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to evaluate the role of obesity as an independent risk
factor for severity of infection with 2009 pH1N1, seasonal H1N1, or a pathogenic 
H1N1 influenza virus.
METHODS: Diet-induced obese (DIO) and their non-obese, age-matched control
counterparts were inoculated with a 2009 pH1N1, A/California/04/2009 (CA/09),
current seasonal H1N1, A/NY/312/2001 (NY312), or highly pathogenic 1918-like
H1N1, A/Iowa/Swine/1931 (Sw31), virus.
RESULTS: Following inoculation with CA/09, DIO mice had higher mortality (80%)
than control mice (0%) and lost more weight during infection. No effect of
obesity on morbidity and mortality was observed during NY312 or Sw31 infection.
Influenza antigen distribution in the alveolar regions of the lungs was more
pronounced in DIO than control mice during CA/09 infection at 3 days
post-inoculation (dpi), despite similar virus titers. During CA/09 infection,
localized interferon-Î² and proinflammatory cytokine protein responses in the
lungs were significantly lower in DIO than control mice. Conversely, serum
cytokine concentrations were elevated in DIO, but not control mice following
infection with CA/09. The effect of obesity on differential immune responses was 
abrogated during NY312 or Sw31 infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data support epidemiologic reports that obesity may 
be a risk factor for severe 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza infection, but the role 
of obesity in seasonal or highly virulent pandemic influenza infection remains
unclear.
