OBJECTIVE: To study correlation between HPV infection and the etiology of human
papilloma and uncover the effects of HPV57 infection on IP, in order to provide a
new way for IP precaution and treatment.
METHOD: Sixty formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of IP were definitely
diagnosed by pathologists. They were examined by the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) technique to amplify HPV DNA with HPV L1 consensus primer and HPV57
type-specific primer. Ten specimens of chronic sinusitis were taken as control
group.
RESULT: All of the sixty IP specimens showed negative after amplification by HPV 
1.1 consensus primer MY09/11. There were forty-seven specimens(47/60, 78.3%)
showed positive for HPV type 57 after amplification by HPV57 type-specific
primer.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a possible role for HPV type 57 in the
pathogenesis of nasal inverted papilloma.
