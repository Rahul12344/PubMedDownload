It was reported that hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody-positivity adversely
affects cardiac function. As the screening for HCV began in 1992, we hypothesized
that HCV antibody-positive rate would be high in adult congenital heart disease
(ACHD) patients who underwent heart surgery before 1992 and adversely affected
cardiac function and long-term prognosis. We retrospectively enrolled 243 ACHD
patients (mean age 25.9 years) who underwent cardiac surgery before 1992 and
visited our hospital from 1995 to 2015. We compared clinical characteristics
including cardiac function and long-term prognosis between HCV antibody-positive 
(n = 48) and antibody-negative (n = 195) patients. The composite end point (CEP) 
included cardiac death, heart failure hospitalization, lethal ventricular
arrhythmias, and cardiac reoperation. The prevalence of reduced systemic
ventricular ejection fraction <50% was significantly higher in the HCV
antibody-positive group compared with the HCV antibody-negative group (17 vs
5.4%, p = 0.014). During a mean follow-up period of 10.1 years (interquartile
range 6 to 14 years), the CEP was noted in 51 patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis
showed the HCV antibody-positive group had significantly poor event-free survival
than the HCV antibody-negative group (log-rank, p = 0.002). In contrast, HCV
ribonucleic acid-positivity was not a significant predictor of the CEP in the HCV
antibody-positive group (log-rank, p = 0.442). Furthermore, the HCV
antibody-positivity was significantly associated with the CEP in both univariable
and multivariable Cox regression models (hazard ratio 2.37, 95% confident
interval 1.32 to 4.15, p = 0.005 and 1.96, 1.06 to 3.63, p = 0.032,
respectively). In conclusion, these results suggest that more attention should be
paid to HCV antibody-positivity in the management of ACHD patients.
