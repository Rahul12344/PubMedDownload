Natural killer (NK) cells are important for maintenance of innate immune system
stability and serve as a first line of defense against tumors and virus
infections; they can act either directly or indirectly and are regulated via
co-operation between inhibitory and stimulatory surface receptors. The recently
reported inhibitory receptor, TIGIT, can be expressed on the NK cell surface;
however, the expression level and function of TIGIT on NK cells during HIV
infection is unknown. In this study, for the first time, we investigated the
expression and function of TIGIT in NK cells from HIV-infected individuals. Our
data demonstrate that the level of TIGIT is higher on NK cells from patients
infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) compared with HIV-negative
healthy controls. TIGIT expression is inversely correlated with CD4+ T cell
counts and positively correlated with plasma viral loads. Additionally, levels of
the TIGIT ligand, CD155, were higher on CD4+ T cells from HIV-infected
individuals compared with those from healthy controls; however, there was no
difference in the level of the activating receptor, CD226, which recognizes the
same ligands as TIGIT. Furthermore, TIGIT was found to specifically up-regulated 
on CD226+ NK cells in HIV-infected individuals, and either rIL-10, or rIL-12 +
rIL-15, could induce TIGIT expression on these cells. In addition, high TIGIT
expression inhibited the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) by NK cells,
while TIGIT inhibition restored IFN-γ production. Overall, these results
highlight the important role of TIGIT in NK cell function and suggest a potential
new avenue for the development of therapeutic strategies toward a functional cure
for HIV.
