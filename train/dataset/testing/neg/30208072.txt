We have characterized the complete genome of a novel circular double-stranded DNA
virus, tentatively named Dioscorea nummularia-associated virus (DNUaV), infecting
Dioscorea nummularia originating from Samoa. The genome of DNUaV comprised 8139
bp and contained four putative open reading frames (ORFs). ORFs 1 and 2 had no
identifiable conserved domains, while ORF 3 had conserved motifs typical of
viruses within the family Caulimoviridae including coat protein, movement
protein, aspartic protease, reverse transcriptase and ribonuclease H. A
transactivator domain, similar to that present in members of several
caulimoviridae genera, was also identified in the putative ORF 4. The genome
size, organization, and presence of conserved amino acid domains are similar to
other viruses in the family Caulimoviridae. However, based on nucleotide sequence
similarity and phylogenetic analysis, DNUaV appears to be a distinct novel member
of the family and may represent a new genus.
