This study is to investigate the treatment of YinQiaojiedu soft capsule for
influenza virus A/PR8/34 (H1N1) infection. The model of pneumonia was established
by dropping influenza virus into the nose of normal mice, and the lung index and 
death rate were observed. Real time RT-PCR and Western blotting technique were
used to detect the virus load and the relative expression of M1 protein in lungs 
of mice on the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th day after infection. The results showed that
YinQiaojiedu soft capsule in 1 g x kg(-1) and 0.5 g x kg(-1) dose groups can
decrease the lung index significantly on the 3rd, 5th and 7th day after being
infected (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), and the number of death in the two groups of
animals decreased significantly. YinQiaojiedu soft capsule in 1 g x kg(-1) dose
group can decreased virus load at each time point, and lower it in 0.5 g x kg(-1)
dose group at the 3rd, 5th and 7th day (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). YinQiaojiedu soft
capsule can decrease the relative expression of M1 protein in lungs of mice, 1 g 
x kg(-1) and 0.5 g x kg(-1) dose groups are significantly lower in expression of 
M1 protein compared with model group at the 3rd and 7th day (P < 0.05, P < 0.01).
It can be concluded that YinQiaojiedu soft capsule exerts antiviral effects
against influenza virus by downregulating expression of virus load and M1
protein.
