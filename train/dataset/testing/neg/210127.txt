Animal studies on the efficacy of an inactivated herpes simplex virus vaccine
against recurrent herpes infection.

Scriba M.

The efficacy of inactivated herpes simplex virus vaccines for the treatment of
recurrent herpes infection was studied in an animal model. Neither the frequency 
nor the severity of recurrent herpetic lesions could be influenced by long-term
treatment of the animals with these vaccines.
