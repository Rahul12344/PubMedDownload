BACKGROUND: Amino acid sequence diversity is introduced into a phage-displayed
peptide library by randomizing library oligonucleotide DNA. We recently evaluated
the diversity of peptide libraries displayed on T7 lytic phage and M13
filamentous phage and showed that T7 phage can display a more diverse amino acid 
sequence repertoire due to differing processes of viral morphogenesis.
METHODS: In this study, we evaluated and compared the diversity of a 12-mer T7
phage-displayed peptide library randomized using codon-corrected trinucleotide
cassettes with a T7 and an M13 12-mer phage-displayed peptide library constructed
using the degenerate codon randomization method.
RESULTS: We herein demonstrate that the combination of trinucleotide cassette
amino acid codon randomization and T7 phage display construction methods resulted
in a significant enhancement to the functional diversity of a 12-mer peptide
library. This novel library exhibited superior amino acid uniformity and
order-of-magnitude increases in amino acid sequence diversity as compared to
degenerate codon randomized peptide libraries. Comparative analyses of the
biophysical characteristics of the 12-mer peptide libraries revealed the
trinucleotide cassette-randomized library to be a unique resource.
CONCLUSION: The combination of T7 phage display and trinucleotide cassette
randomization resulted in a novel resource for the potential isolation of binding
peptides for new and previously studied molecular targets.
