There has never been a locally transmitted outbreak of mosquito-borne disease in 
New Zealand, but the risk of an outbreak occurring is increasing with on-going
interceptions of exotic mosquito vectors across its border, increasing traffic of
goods and passengers, higher numbers of viremic travelers arriving, and local,
regional, and global environmental change. The risk posed to New Zealand by
chikungunya virus is potentially high because of the transmissibility of this
virus in subtropical climates, compounded by a population that is predominantly
immunologically naive to exotic arboviruses. However, risk reduction in New
Zealand should not be considered in isolation but must be viewed within a wider
South Pacific context. In this report, we discuss the potential threat posed by
chikungunya to the region, focusing in particular on New Zealand, and
re-emphasizing the need for a South Pacific-wide approach towards mosquito-borne 
disease prevention.
