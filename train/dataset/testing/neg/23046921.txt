In 2011, a novel orthobunyavirus of the Simbu serogroup, the Schmallenberg virus 
(SBV), was discovered using a metagenomic approach. SBV caused a large epidemic
in Europe in ruminants. As with related viruses such as Akabane virus, it appears
to be transmitted by biting midges. Transplacental infection often results in the
birth of malformed calves, lambs and goat kids. In more than 5000 farms in
Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, France, UK, Italy, Spain, Luxembourg, Denmark 
and Switzerland acute infections of adult ruminants or malformed SBV-positive
offspring were detected, and high seroprevalences were seen in adult ruminants in
the core regions in The Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. The discovery of SBV,
the spread of the epidemic, the role of vectors, the impact on livestock, public 
health issues, SBV diagnosis and measures taken are described in this review.
Lessons to be learned from the Schmallenberg virus epidemic and the consequences 
for future outbreaks are discussed.
