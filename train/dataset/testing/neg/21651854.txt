AIM: To clarify the activeness of H9 in vitro and internalization and modulation 
of the surface chemokine receptor CX3CR1 induced by H9, To discuss the influence 
of H9 on the chemokine receptor CX3CR1.
METHODS: Inhibition by chemotactic peptide on the physiological detection of
chemokine induced cell migration activity. Flowcytometry examined the effection
of H9 on intracellular calcium. Laser scanning confocal microscopy and flow
cytometry were used to determine the quality and quantity of CX3CR1
internalization.
RESULTS: H9 was able to block the migration induced by chemokine receptor. In the
chemoattraction test, H9 was unable to induce the chemotactic movement, and it
does not affect the signal transduction and activeness of cells. It was found
that H9 could induce internalization with a maximal rate of 70%, at the
concentration of 200 ng/mL. The internalized CX3CR1 molecules could recycled to
the cell surface.
CONCLUSION: H9 makes human CX3CR1 internalize. After internalizing, the CX3CR1
receptor recirculates the cell surface. It does not affect CX3CR1 physiology
function. H9 could be used as a specificity anti-virus peptide.
