Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is an RNA virus that is prone to high
rates of mutation. While the disease is managed with current antiretroviral
therapies, drugs with a new mode of action are needed. A strategy towards this
goal is aimed at targeting the native three-dimensional fold of conserved RNA
structures. This perspective highlights medium-sized peptides and peptidomimetics
used to target two conserved RNA structures of HIV-1. In particular, branched
peptides have the capacity to bind in a multivalent fashion, utilizing a large
surface area to achieve the necessary affinity and selectivity toward the target 
RNA.
