Transcription complexes that assemble at the HIV-1 promoter efficiently initiate 
transcription but generate paused RNA polymerase II downstream from the start
site. The virally encoded Tat protein hijacks positive transcription elongation
factor b (P-TEFb) to phosphorylate and activate this paused polymerase. In
addition, Tat undergoes a series of reversible post-translational modifications
that regulate distinct steps of the transcription cycle. To identify additional
functionally important Tat cofactors, we performed RNAi knockdowns of sixteen
previously identified Tat interactors and found that a novel E3 ligase, PJA2,
ubiquitinates Tat in a non-degradative manner and specifically regulates the step
of HIV transcription elongation. Interestingly, several different lysine residues
in Tat can function as ubiquitin acceptor sites, and variable combinations of
these lysines support both full transcriptional activity and viral replication.
Further, the polyubiquitin chain conjugated to Tat by PJA2 can itself be
assembled through variable ubiquitin lysine linkages. Importantly, proper
ubiquitin chain assembly by PJA2 requires that Tat first binds its P-TEFb
cofactor. These results highlight that both the Tat substrate and ubiquitin
modification have plastic site usage, and this plasticity is likely another way
in which the virus exploits the host molecular machinery to expand its limited
genetic repertoire.
