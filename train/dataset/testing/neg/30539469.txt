Antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies are useful tools to detect very small
amounts of antigenic materials and are applicable for antibody therapeutics. To
produce mouse monoclonal antibodies, a hybridoma between B lymphocytes and
myeloma cells is used to produce antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies. However,
a good hybridoma system is not available to obtain human monoclonal antibodies.
To produce antigen-specific human monoclonal antibodies, transformation of B
lymphocytes with Epstein-Barr viruses or a phage-display system is used. Here, we
describe the screening of antigen-specific, antibody-secreting cells using
microwell array chips to obtain antigen-specific human monoclonal antibodies. The
system can be applied to screen antigen-specific, antibody-secreting cells from
any animal species.
