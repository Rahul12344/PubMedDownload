We describe a simple slot-blot hybridization procedure with an oligo-probe for
identification of amplified HIV-1 DNA in seropositive subjects. Comparison are
realized, on the same DNA samples, with other methods DNA detection including
Southern blot tests after hybridization with a labelled probe, and
autoradiographic patterns after digestion with a restriction enzyme of the
amplified product hybridized. This new direct approach towards diagnosis of HIV-1
infection easily be carried out on a large scale.
