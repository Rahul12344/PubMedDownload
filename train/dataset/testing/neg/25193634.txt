Although vaccines against influenza are widely available, control of the disease 
remains elusive. In part, this is due to the inability of current vaccines to
induce durable, broadly protective immune responses. Prevention of influenza
depends primarily on effective antibody responses that block virus entry.
Following infection, high-affinity IgA antibodies are generated in the
respiratory tract that lead to immune exclusion, while IgG prevents systemic
spread. These are effective and long-lasting but also exert immune pressure.
Mutation of the antigenic determinants of influenza therefore rapidly leads to
emergence of novel variants that evade previously generated protective responses.
Not only do vaccines suffer from this strain-specific limitation, but also they
are suboptimal in their ability to induce durable immunity. However, recent
evidence has demonstrated the possibility of inducing broadly cross-reactive
antibody responses. Further understanding of the ways in which high-titer,
long-lived antibody responses directed against such cross-reactive epitopes can
be induced would lead to the development of novel vaccines that may remove the
requirement for recurrent vaccination.
