BACKGROUND: Influenza virus infections are a major cause of morbidity and the
identification of the type or subtype of a clinical isolate has important
clinical and epidemiological implications.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the ability of a reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) assay to type and subtype clinical human isolates of influenza 
virus.
STUDY DESIGN: Reference strains of influenza A H1N1, A/H3N2, and B viruses and
human clinical isolates of influenza virus representing antigenic variants from
the last 15 years were evaluated using an RT-PCR assay.
RESULTS: Amplicons of 325, 198 and 365 base pairs in length were obtained from
RNA extracted from influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B viruses, respectively. All
human-derived A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B reference strains and antigenic variants
tested were correctly identified.
CONCLUSIONS: RT-PCR is an effective alternative to traditional methods for typing
and subtyping influenza viruses.
