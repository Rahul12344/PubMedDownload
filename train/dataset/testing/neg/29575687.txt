A Getah virus (GETV) outbreak occurred in a swine farm in Hunan, China, between
June and July 2017. Approximately 200 piglets died 5-10 days after birth, and
more than 150 pregnant sows had stillbirths or foetal mummies in this outbreak.
GETV HuN1, isolated from the cerebrum of an infected piglet, shared a close
evolutionary relationship with the Kochi/01/2005 strain, isolated from pigs in
Japan. GETV was detected in the cerebral cortices of a dead foetus and in various
organs of two infected piglets, thereby demonstrating that GETV can be
transmitted through the placenta to infected newborn piglets with multiple tissue
tropisms. Seroepizootiologic investigation of GETV revealed that a wide infection
of GETV had been persisting in the farm between June 1 and July 17. In
conclusion, clinical and laboratory diagnostics of the diseased pigs in this
outbreak were consistent with GETV being the causative agent. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first unequivocal report of GETV in pigs in China.
