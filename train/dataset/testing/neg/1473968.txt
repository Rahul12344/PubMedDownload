Mannan-binding protein is an animal serum lectin (i.e. a molecule with the
ability to bind specifically to certain carbohydrate structures). The relevant
carbohydrate ligands are found on many pathogenic microorganisms. After binding
to suitable carbohydrate ligands, mannan-binding protein is found to be an
activator of the classical pathway of complement via an activation of the
C1r2C1s2 complex, i.e. antibody and C1q independent. The molecular organization
of MBP resembles that of C1q with a distinct division of collagen-like and
globular amino acid sequences. This molecular similarity seems to be the basis
for the common functional activity of the two proteins. MBP may play an important
protective role, especially at early stages of infection prior to the generation 
of the specific humoral and cellular defence system. The paper explores the
structure and the physiological functions of mannan-binding protein.
