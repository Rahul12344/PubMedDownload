The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is classically associated with three malignancies,
Burkitt's lymphoma. B-cell lymphoproliferative syndromes, and nasopharyngeal
carcinoma, and, more recently, with Hodgkin's disease, T-cell lymphomas, and
gastric carcinoma, as well as being the causal agent for infectious
mononucleosis. The relation of the virus to the malignancies varies from primary 
etiologic agent to necessary or contributory cofactor. Clonal EBV episomes are
found in all the malignant conditions. EBV infects both epithelial and lymphoid
cells, providing a pathobiological basis for these diverse associations. Most of 
the malignancies occur after years of viral dormancy and are accompanied or
triggered by viral reactivation, in contrast to infectious mononucleosis, which
results from primary infection with EBV. The EBV-associated malignancies offer
insights into the causation and early detection of cancer. The molecular virology
and pathobiology of EBV infection states provide the basis for the specific
diagnosis of these diseases and a framework for new therapies.
