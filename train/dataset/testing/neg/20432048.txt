RNA 2 and RNA 3 of lilac leaf chlorosis virus (LLCV) were sequenced and shown to 
be 2,762 nucleotides (nt) and 2,117 nts in length, respectively. RNA 2 encodes a 
putative 807-amino-acid (aa) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase associated protein with
an estimated M (r) of 92.75 kDa. RNA 3 is bicistronic, with ORF1 encoding a
putative movement protein (277 aa, M (r) 31.45 kDa) and ORF2 encoding the
putative coat protein (221 aa, M (r) 24.37 kDa). The genome organization is
similar to that typical for members of the genus Ilarvirus. Phylogenetic analyses
indicate a close evolutionary relationship between LLCV, ApMV, and PNRSV.
