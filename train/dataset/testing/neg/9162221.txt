Hepatitis C virus infects mononuclear leukocytes of patients with chronic
hepatitis C. Treatment with rhG-CSF led to a dose-related reduction in the
genomic and antigenomic hepatitis C viral strands in cultures of
mitogen-stimulated, naturally-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
patients with chronic hepatitis C. Hepatitis C virus genomic strand of subtype 1b
was suppressed in 5 of 11 cases, and concurrently with suppression of the viral
antigenomic strand in two of them. The treatment also resulted in a significantly
increased release of interleukin 6, but not of other cytokines. However, the
biological response of hepatitis C virus-infected mononuclear cells to treatment 
with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was unrelated to any
particular pattern of cytokine production.
