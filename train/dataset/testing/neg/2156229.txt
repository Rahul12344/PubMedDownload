The promoter P97 of human papillomavirus-16 (HPV-16) gives rise to transcripts
that encode the principal transforming genes of the virus, E6 and E7. The
activity of P97 is regulated by a cell-type-specific enhancer, as well as by
glucocorticoids and progesterone. We show here, that in CaSki cells, which
contain HPV-16 genomes, P97 is also inducible by phorbol esters. Functional
analysis of restriction fragments and oligonucleotides of the viral enhancer
localizes two phorbol ester response elements on two transcription factor binding
sites termed fp4e and fp9e. Sequence comparison, footprint analysis and bandshift
competition of the cloned motifs suggest that both fp4e and fp9e are bound by the
transcription factor AP1. These AP1 binding sites in HPV-16 and other
papillomaviruses may provide a link between cellular oncogenes like jun, fos and 
possibly ras, whose transcription stimulating activity may lead to an elevated
expression of the viral transforming genes E6 and E7.
