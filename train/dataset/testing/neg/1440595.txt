Among the representatives of the class aves, ocular lesions may be a particularly
strong indicator of systemic disorders. A causative diagnosis of ocular lesions
may be vital for the avian patient, not only as a basis for effective therapy of 
the primary disease, but also for saving the vision, as birds orientate
themselves primarily by vision. The following paper presents a synopsis of
important ocular disorders in avian patients that are either pathognomonic for
certain disorders or, when considered in conjunction with other organic diseases,
enable a specific diagnosis. Bacterial and parasitic infections were already
described in part 1 of this paper. Part 2 gives outlines of possible viral
etiologies and noninfectious diseases.
