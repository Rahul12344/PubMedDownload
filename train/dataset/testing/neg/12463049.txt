The rapid increase in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence and incidence
requires that Chinese health professionals mobilize for HIV prevention. The
article describes an HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome knowledge and
attitude assessment administered before and after a lecture. HIV transmission
knowledge was good, with 90 percent to 100 percent of participants correctly
identifying means of transmission. Prior to and after the lecture, 43 percent and
21 percent, respectively, were unwilling to sit or work with an HIV-infected
person. To increase the likelihood of prevention activities' success, HIV
knowledge and attitudes of health care personnel in China must be monitored and
improved.
