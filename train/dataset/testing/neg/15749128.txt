Here, we evaluate the T cell responses raised by our HIV-1 clade B DNA/MVA
vaccine for recognition of a HIV-1 circulating recombinant form (CRF) AG Gag
sequence (CRF-02). The cross-clade activity for the AG sequence was better
conserved for CD8 than CD4 T cells. CD8 T cells exhibited 75% conservation for
height and 83% conservation for breadth, whereas CD4 responses exhibited 45%
conservation for height and 50% conservation for breadth. Five CD8 epitopes and 8
CD4 epitopes were mapped. Three of the 5 CD8 epitopes and 2 of the 8 CD4 epitopes
were conserved across multiple HIV-1 clades. Impressively, all of the CD8
epitopes and half of the CD4 epitopes have been reported for human infections.
Our results demonstrate that the clade B DNA/MVA HIV vaccine elicits T cell
responses against epitopes that are conserved in multiple clades and recognized
by humans and macaques.
