The receptor internalization and degradation (RID) complex of adenovirus plays an
important role in modulating the immune response by downregulating the surface
levels of tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), thereby inhibiting NF-kappaB
activation. Total cellular content of TNFR1 is also reduced in the presence of
RID, which can be inhibited by treatment with lysosomotropic agents. In this
report, surface biotinylation experiments revealed that, although RID and TNFR1
were able to form a complex on the cell surface, the rate of TNFR1 endocytosis
was not affected by RID. However, the degradation of internalized TNFR1 was
enhanced significantly in the presence of RID. Therefore, these data suggest that
RID downregulates TNFR1 levels by altering the fate of internalized TNFR1 that
becomes associated with RID at the plasma membrane, probably by promoting its
sorting into endosomal/lysosomal degradation compartments.
