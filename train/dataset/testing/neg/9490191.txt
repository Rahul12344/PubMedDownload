BACKGROUND: Accidents resulting from percutaneous exposure account for
approximately one third of all accidents suffered at work by health workers in
hospitals. Their importance lies in the illnesses caused by pathogens that can be
transmitted in this way (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV virus). The aims are to
describe accidents of this type notified in a tertiary level hospital, identify
factors associated with these accidents in nursing staff and build a predictive
model for the individual risk of having an accident.
METHODS: A descriptive study of a retrospective cohort made up of all the people 
who notified having suffered an accident between 1-1-93 and 30-6-96. A study of
cases and controls in nursing staff during the period 1-1-95 to 30-6-96, analysed
through multiple logistical regression.
RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of cases of accidents in one year was 0.078 for
male and female nurses. In 57.3% of cases, disposable or pre-loaded syringes were
involved. The cumulative incidence of cases in one year was greater for
intravenous catheterisation (8.5% per 100,000). The risk of having an accident,
adjusted on account of confusing variables, was greater for female and male
nurses (OR = 3.22; I.C.95% = 1.96-5.27), or workers in the Haemodialysis Unit (OR
= 35.21; I.C.95% = 3.74-331.16) and for those employed on a temporary contract
(OR = 4.50; I.C.95% = 2.24-9.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Accidents resulting from percutaneous exposure at this hospital are 
more frequent among nursing staff and are basically caused by any type of hollow 
needles. Factors associated with these accidents were identified, allowing
specific prevention programmes to be targeted at those workers at greater risk.
The model obtained is valid to estimate the degree of individual accident
probability for the subjects studied.
