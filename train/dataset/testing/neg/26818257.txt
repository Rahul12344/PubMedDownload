Human endogenous retroviruses: friend or foe?

The integration of proviral DNA into host chromosomal DNA as an obligatory step
in the replication cycle of retroviruses is a natural event of genetic
recombination between virus and host. When integration occurs in cells of the
germ line, it results in mendelian inheritance of viral sequences that we call
endogenous retroviruses (ERV) and HERV for humans. HERVs and host often establish
a symbiotic relationship, especially in the placenta and in pluripotent embryonic
stem cells, but HERVs occasionally have deleterious consequences for the host.
This special issue of APMIS features the fascinating relationships between HERV
and humans in health and disease.
