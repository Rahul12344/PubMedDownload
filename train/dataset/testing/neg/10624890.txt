Plants from Northern Nigeria with a history of use in both human and veterinary
traditional medicine have been investigated for their antiviral activity and
their cytotoxicity determined. Extracts were tested against poliovirus,
astrovirus, herpes simplex viruses and parvovirus, using the microtitre plate
inhibition tests. Most of the extracts have activity against more than one virus 
at a dose rate of between 100 and 400 microg/100 microl.
