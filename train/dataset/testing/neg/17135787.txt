OBJECTIVE: Gene therapy is defined as the treatment of an acquired or inherited
disease by transfer of genetic material. The most common strategies in gene
therapy of bladder cancer are corrective, inductive and cytotoxic gene therapy.
Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are the most common molecular genetic 
abnormalities in bladder cancer and p53 gene transfer in the human bladder cancer
cell line by adenoviral or other vectors was demonstrated to be cytotoxic.
However, so far there has been no report of adeno-associated virus-2
vector-mediated p53 gene deliveries in bladder cancer. In this study, wild-type
p53 cDNA was transfected into the bladder cancer cells, using the
adeno-associated virus-2 vector, and the capability of rAAV-wt-p53 gene therapy
in bladder cancer was evaluated in vitro.
METHOD: Bladder cancer cell lines 5637 were transduced with adeno-associated
virus-2 vectors containing wild-type human p53 gene (rAAV-wt-p53). Gene
expression and transcriptional activation of p53 was determined by Western blot
analysis. The cellular growth inhibition and apoptosis of rAAV-mediated p53
transfection were assessed by flow cytometry. The combination effect of
rAAV-wt-p53 and cisplatin was measured by MTT assay.
RESULTS: The virus rAAV efficiently enters the cells and expresses its gene
products. The gene product of rAAV-wt-p53 is cytotoxic to bladder cancer cells.
The bladder cell line 5637 was found to experience a synergistic killing effect
when rAAV-wt-p53 was used in combination with cisplatin.
CONCLUSION: rAAV-mediated p53 gene transfer could offer a powerful novel
therapeutic approach in bladder cancer.
