According to phylogenetic data, about 100 years ago an avian influenza virus
passed the species barrier (possibly first) to pigs and (possibly from there) to 
humans. In 1979 an avian influenza A virus (as a whole, without reassortment)
again entered the pig population in northern Europe, forming a stable lineage.
Here it is shown that the early North European swine viruses exhibit higher than 
normal evolutionary rates and are highly variable with respect to plaque
morphology and neutralizability by monoclonal antibodies. Our results are
consistent with the idea that, in order to pass the species barrier, an influenza
A virus needs a mutator mutation to provide an additional number of variants,
from which the new host might select the best fitting ones. A mutator mutation
could be of advantage under such stress conditions and might enable a virus to
pass the species barrier as a whole even twice, as it seems to have happened
about 100 years ago. This stressful situation should be over for the recent swine
lineage, since the viruses seem to be adapted already to the new host in that the
most recent isolates--at least in northern Germany--are genetically stable and
seem to have lost the putative mutator mutation again.
