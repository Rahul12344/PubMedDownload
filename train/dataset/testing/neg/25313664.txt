The development of clinical vectors to correct genetic mutations that cause
inherited myopathies and related disorders of skeletal muscle is advancing at an 
impressive rate. Adeno-associated virus vectors are attractive for clinical use
because (1) adeno-associated viruses do not cause human disease and (2) these
vectors are able to persist for years. New vectors are now becoming available as 
gene therapy delivery tools, and recent preclinical experiments have demonstrated
the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of gene therapy with adeno-associated virus
for long-term correction of muscle pathology and weakness in
myotubularin-deficient canine and murine disease models. In this review, recent
advances in the application of gene therapies to treat inherited muscle disorders
are presented, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy and x-linked myotubular
myopathy. Potential areas for therapeutic synergies between rehabilitation
medicine and genetics are also discussed.
