Viral infection and renal transplant rejection.

Briggs JD, Timbury MC, Paton AM, Bell PR.

The occurrence of an outbreak of influenza in a renal transplant unit is
described. Five patients had a proved episode of infection, confirmed by a rise
in the complement fixation titre to influenza virus A, and this coincided in
three of the patients with episodes of acute rejection. It seems likely that the 
virus infection was responsible for the rejection, possibly through a stimulating
effect of the virus on the host's immune response.
