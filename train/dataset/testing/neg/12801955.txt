INTRODUCTION: Interleukin 10 knockout (IL-10-/-) mice spontaneously develop a Th1
T cell mediated colitis with many similarities to Crohn's disease. Daily
injections of IL-10 are unable to induce remission in mice with established
disease. In contrast, we have shown previously that intravenous administration of
adenoviral vectors encoding IL-10 (AdvmuIL-10) induces hepatic IL-10 release and 
leads to long term disease suppression with profound systemic immunoregulatory
changes.
AIMS: To determine whether rectal delivery of AdvmuIL-10 induces localised
colonic IL-10 expression without systemic immune suppression, and assess its
therapeutic efficacy in IL-10-/- mice with established colitis.
RESULTS: A single rectal infusion of 5 x 10(8) PFU AdvmuIL-10 to 10 week IL-
10-/- mice resulted in a median level of 27.3 pg/mg IL-10 in colonic homogenates 
harvested one week later. IL-10-/- mice with established colitis treated with an 
enema of 5 x 10(8) PFU AdvmuIL-10 entered clinical and histological remission
whereas empty cassette adenovirus (Adv0) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
treated mice developed progressive disease. After four weeks, the histological
score of AdvmuIL-10 treated mice (4.4 (1.5)) was significantly lower than that of
Adv0 (11.1 (1.1); p<0.001) and PBS (10.9 (1.0); p<0.01) treated controls. In
addition, the stool concentration of IL-1beta over the four week experiment was
significantly higher in mice treated with saline or Adv0 than in those treated
with AdvmuIL-10 (p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: Local AdvmuIL-10 therapy reverses colitis in IL-10-/- mice without
the systemic effects seen after intravenous administration. Gene therapy
strategies using adenoviral vectors encoding immunoregulatory cytokines may prove
to be a potent approach to the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as
Crohn's disease.
