The Audio Computer Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI) is a computer application that
allows a research participant to hear survey interview items over a computer
headset and read the corresponding items on a computer monitor. The ACASI
automates progression from one item to the next, skipping irrelevant items. The
research participant responds by pressing a number keypad, sending the data
directly into a database. The ACASI was used to enhance participants' sense of
privacy. A convenience sample of 257 young urban women, ages 18 to 29 years, were
interviewed in neighborhood settings concerning human immune deficiency virus
(HIV) sexual risk behaviors. Notebook computers were used to facilitate mobility.
The overwhelming majority rated their experience with ACASI as easy to use. This 
article will focus on the use of ACASI in HIV behavioral research, its benefits, 
and approaches to resolve some identified problems with this method of data
collection.
