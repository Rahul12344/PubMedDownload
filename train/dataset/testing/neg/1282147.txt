The association of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and tattooing was studied in
87 tattooed and 126 tattoo free healthy young men who did not engage in
intravenous drug use or multiple sexual activity. Antibody against HCV (anti-HCV)
was tested in serum specimens by enzyme immunoassay with C100-3, NS3, and core
antigens; 11 of the 87 (12.6%) tattooed and 3 of the 126 (2.4%) tattoo free
subjects were positive for anti-HCV (odds ratio = 5.9, 95% CI = 1.6-22.0). A
relationship was demonstrated by an increased risk for HCV infection with an
increasing number of tattooed site (P(trend) = 0.002). All but one of the 87
tattooed subjects had been infected by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and 25 were
carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). None of the 25 HBsAg carriers
was positive for anti-HCV whereas 11 of the 62 HBsAg non-carriers had anti-HCV,
suggesting a negative association between the HBsAg carriage and the long lasting
anti-HCV (P = 0.02, Fisher's exact). The status of the tattooer was also an
important determinant for HCV infection; the risk was higher if tattooing was
done by a non-professional friend than by a professional tattooist. Tattooing,
probably with improperly sterilized needles, can clearly pose an increased risk
for HCV infection in Taiwan. This study indicates the need for legal standards
for hygienic tattooing as part of preventive measures for the control of
parenterally transmitted infections.
