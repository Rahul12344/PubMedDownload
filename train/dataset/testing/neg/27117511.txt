BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) reactivation is accompanied by a 
sustained influx of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells that persist in genital tissue for 
extended periods. While CD4(+) T cells have long been recognized as being present
in herpetic ulcerations, their role in subclinical reactivation and persistence
is less well known, especially the role of CD4(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs).
METHODS: We characterized the Treg (CD4(+)Foxp3(+)) population during human HSV-2
reactivation in situ in sequential genital skin biopsy specimens obtained from
HSV-2-seropositive subjects at the time of lesion onset up to 8 weeks after
healing.
RESULTS: High numbers of Tregs infiltrated to the site of viral reactivation and 
persisted in proximity to conventional CD4(+) T cells (Tconvs) and CD8(+) T
cells. Treg density peaked during the lesion stage of the reactivation. The
number of Tregs from all time points (lesion, healed, 2 weeks after healing, 4
weeks after healing, and 8 weeks after healing) was significantly higher than in 
control biopsy specimens from unaffected skin. There was a direct correlation
between HSV-2 titer and Treg density.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of a high Treg to Tconv ratio with high viral
shedding suggests that the balance between regulatory and effector T cells
influences human HSV-2 disease.
