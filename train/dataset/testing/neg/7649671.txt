We prospectively studied, with 24-h Holter monitoring, 21 consecutive human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients, at all stages of the infection,
in order to assess their dysrhythmic profile. Three (14.3%) patients presented
one isolated run of supraventricular tachycardia, with < 10 beats, that was
considered clinically irrelevant. No patient presented other clinically relevant 
supraventricular or ventricular tachy or bradydysrhythmias. One (4.8%) patient
presented intermittent Mobitz type I second-degree AV block, two (9.5%) patients 
paroxistic 2:1 AV block and one (4.8%) patient presented a bifascicular block on 
the 12-lead ECG that persisted during the ambulatory recording. This study
suggests that clinically relevant cardiac tachydysrhythmias are rare in our
population of HIV infected patients. On the other hand we found an unexpectedly
high incidence of cardiac impulse conduction disturbances.
