Serological markers of hepatitis B virus infection were studied in a group of
recently presenting alcoholic out-patients and compared with a group of long-stay
in-patients suffering from chronic alcoholism. All markers of infection were
increased in the chronic group and were thought to be related to admission to the
Alcohol Unit. Although both groups had normal liver function tests, the patients 
with the longer alcohol history had evidence of two coexisting causes of liver
disease and may, therefore, have a much poorer prognosis.
