Investigations carried out by the authors have demonstrated that a new specially 
synthesized nonionic detergent, MECK, can be successfully used for obtaining pure
influenza virus surface antigens in preparative amounts. Hemagglutinin and
neuraminidase isolated by means of MECK retain their structure and biological
activity. Special attention has been devoted to the study of the immunological
characteristics of the preparations thus obtained. The high immunogenicity of
solubilized hemagglutinin and the complete retention of its antigenic activity
have been confirmed. The simplicity of the method for the isolation of influenza 
virus surface antigens and their purification from internal viral proteins and
the detergent make it possible to recommend the above method for the preparative 
isolation of external antigens.
