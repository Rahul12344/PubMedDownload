We report two cases of patients who developed ventricular tachycardia while
receiving intravenous infusions of ganciclovir
[9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxy)methylguanine, DHPG]. Worsening cytomegalovirus
infection prompted renewal of ganciclovir therapy under close cardiac monitoring 
in one of these patients, and ventricular tachycardia recurred. The close
temporal relationship between administration of the drug and onset of the
arrhythmias in conjunction with the absence of other factors known to predispose 
to arrhythmias suggest that ganciclovir may have played a role in the development
of arrhythmias in these patients. The clinical courses of the patients are
discussed, as are autopsy results.
