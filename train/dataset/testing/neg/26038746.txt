In 2010, a large outbreak of rotavirus gastroenteritis occurred in the Alice
Springs region of the Northern Territory, Australia. The outbreak occurred 43
months after the introduction of the G1P[8] rotavirus vaccine Rotarix(速).
Forty-three infants were hospitalized during the outbreak and analysis of fecal
samples from each infant revealed a G1P[8] rotavirus strain. The outbreak strain 
was adapted to cell culture and neutralization assays were performed using VP7
and VP4 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. The outbreak strain exhibited a
distinct neutralization resistance pattern compared to the Rotarix(速) vaccine
strain. Whole genome sequencing of the 2010 outbreak virus strain demonstrated
numerous amino acid differences compared to the Rotarix(速) vaccine strain in the 
characterized neutralization epitopes of the VP7 and VP4 proteins. Phylogenetic
analysis of the outbreak strain revealed a close genetic relationship to global
strains, in particular RVA/Human-wt/BEL/BE0098/2009/G1P[8] and
RVA/Human-wt/BEL/BE00038/2008/G1P[8] for numerous genes. The 2010 outbreak strain
was likely introduced from a globally circulating population of strains rather
than evolving from an endemic Australian strain. The outbreak strain possessed
antigenic differences in the VP7 and VP4 proteins compared to the Rotarix(速)
vaccine strain. The outbreak was associated with moderate vaccine coverage and
possibly low vaccine take in the population.
