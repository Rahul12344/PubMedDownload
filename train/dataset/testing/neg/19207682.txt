BACKGROUND: The association and profile of surface gene mutations with viral
genotypes have been studied in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) but 
not in subjects with occult HBV infection.
AIM: This study aimed to investigate the association of surface gene mutations
with viral genotypes in occult HBV infection.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Of 293 family contacts of 90 chronic HBV index patients, 110
consented for the study. Of 110 subjects, 97 were hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg) negative. HBV genotyping was done using direct DNA sequencing. The S-gene
was also sequenced in 13 chronic hepatitis B patients to serve as controls.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight (28.8%) of the 97 subjects had occult HBV infection.
Bidirectional sequencing of partial S-gene was successful in 13 of them. Seven
(53.8%) of the viral sequences are genotype A1, two (15.3%) each having genotypes
D5&D2 and one each (7.6%) having D1&G genotypes. Seven (53.8%) of the 13 HBsAg
positive patients, had genotype D&6 (46.1%) genotype A. A128V & T143M mutations
were observed in 5 of 13 (38.4%) subjects and A128V & P127S in 2 of 13 (15.3%)
patients (P = 0.385). A128V mutation was seen in two (15.3%) subjects with D2
genotype, while T143M mutation was seen in three (23.07%) subjects with
A1genotype. At aa125, three (23.07%) subjects with D5 genotype had methionine
instead of threonine. There were wild type sequences in five (38.4%) subjects,
one each of D1, G genotypes (20%) and four A1 (80%) genotypes. None of the
subjects had G145R mutation.
CONCLUSIONS: Occult HBV infection may be common in household contacts of chronic 
HBV infected patients. Equal prevalence of A&D sub-genotypes was present in
occult HBV subjects and in chronic HBV patients. Mutations of the S-gene are
genotype specific in both occult as well as chronic HBV infection.
