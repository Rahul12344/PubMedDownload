Many cases of acute hepatitis remain undiagnosed and the hepatitis E virus (HEV) 
is emerging in industrialized countries. The aim of this study was to assess the 
role HEV as causative agent in acute non-A, non-B, and non-C hepatitis patients
in Hungary. 10.5% of the 264 acute non-A, non-B, and non-C hepatitis patients
tested had anti-HEV IgG and 1.9% had anti-HEV IgM as tested by ELISA. After
confirmation by Western blot 6.1% of the acute non-A, non-B, and non-C hepatitis 
patients had anti-HEV IgG antibodies only and 1.1% of the patients had both IgG
and IgM. All 19 patients that were positive for anti-HEV IgG and/or IgM tested
negative for HEV RNA by PCR. Only a small proportion of the acute hepatitis cases
in the southwest of Hungary are assumed to be attributed to HEV infection,
however, hepatitis E should be considered along with hepatitis A, B, and C in the
diagnosis of acute hepatitis.
