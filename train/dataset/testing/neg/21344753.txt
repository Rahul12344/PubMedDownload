Nerve growth factor (NGF) is mainly secreted by the neuroglia cells, which can
exert biological effect through its receptors on the specific target cell
surface. NGF is closely related to neurocyte growth, differentiation and
apoptosis. As a neurotropic virus, HSV-1 an easily lead to neurocyte, neuroglia
cells death or apoptosis. In this study, the U251 human glioma cells were chosen 
as target cells to study the change of NGF and its receptors in the apoptosis
process of HSV-1 infection. Our results showed that U251 cells were permissive to
HSV-1 replication. In the apoptosis process of HSV-1 infected U251 cells, the
expression of both NGF and P75NTR increased and then decreased, while the
expression of TrkA decreased gradually. These result indicated that HSV-1 was
able to induce the abnormal expression of NGF and its receptors in U251 cells.
