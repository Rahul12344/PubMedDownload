To better understand the potential for antagonistic interactions between members 
of the same bacterial species, we have surveyed bacteriocin killing activity
across a diverse suite of strains of the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Our 
data demonstrate that killing activity from phage-derived bacteriocins of P.
syringae (R-type syringacins) is widespread. Despite a high overall diversity of 
bacteriocin activity, strains can broadly be classified into five main killing
types and two main sensitivity types. Furthermore, we show that killing activity 
switches frequently between strains and that switches correlate with localized
recombination of two genes that together encode the proteins that specify
bacteriocin targeting. Lastly, we demonstrate that phage-derived bacteriocin
killing activity can be swapped between strains simply through expression of
these two genes in trans. Overall, our study characterizes extensive diversity of
killing activity for phage-derived bacteriocins of P. syringae across strains and
highlights the power of localized recombination to alter phenotypes that mediate 
strain interactions during evolution of natural populations and communities.
