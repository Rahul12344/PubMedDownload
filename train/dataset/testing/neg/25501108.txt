Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare and aggressive brain
tumor. The aim of this study was to clarify the prevalence of T-cell-type PCNSL
(T-PCNSL) in a human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1)-endemic area of
Southwestern Japan. We retrospectively investigated 31 PCNSL cases diagnosed
between 1996 and 2013 at the University of Miyazaki Hospital. These cases
accounted for 4.4% of all nodal or extranodal malignant lymphomas.
Histologically, most of these cases were diagnosed as diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma, while only two cases were considered to be low-grade and high-grade
B-cell lymphoma (not otherwise specified). No T-PCNSL was found in this series.
In addition, Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNAs were not detected by in situ
hybridization in any of the cases. Overall, no T-PCNSL cases were found in 18
years in a region with a high frequency of HTLV-1 seropositivity, namely,
Southwestern Japan. This suggests that PCNSL and lymphomas of other anatomical
sites are biologically distinct.
