Oral lichen planus (OLP) occurs in from 2% to 3% of the population and may have a
risk of malignant transformation into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This risk is
not necessarily associated with exposure to tobacco and alcohol. An increased
awareness of a possible role of human papilloma virus (HPV) and SCC led us to
review a possible association between this virus infection and malignant
transformation of OLP. The possible linkage between HPV and the risk of
transformation of OLP to malignancy is discussed. Furthermore, management of OLP 
using immunosuppressive drugs may be associated with enhanced viral replication
and could theoretically affect the risk of malignant transformation. Implications
for clinical care are discussed.
