We used comprehensive serodiagnostic methods (IgM, IgG, and IgG avidity) and PCR 
to study Merkel cell polyomavirus and trichodysplasia spinulosa-associated
polyomavirus infections in children observed from infancy to adolescence.
Comparing seroconversion intervals with previous and subsequent intervals, we
found that primary infections with these 2 viruses were asymptomatic in
childhood.
