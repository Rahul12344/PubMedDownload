Although enteric viruses constitute a major cause of acute waterborne diseases
worldwide, environmental data about occurrence and viral load of enteric viruses 
in water are not often available. In this study, enteric viruses (i.e.,
adenovirus, aichivirus, astrovirus, cosavirus, enterovirus, hepatitis A and E
viruses, norovirus of genogroups I and II, rotavirus A and salivirus) were
monitored in the Seine River and the origin of contamination was untangled. A
total of 275 water samples were collected, twice a month for one year, from the
river Seine, its tributaries and the major WWTP effluents in the Paris
agglomeration. All water samples were negative for hepatitis A and E viruses.
AdV, NVGI, NVGII and RV-A were the most prevalent and abundant populations in all
water samples. The viral load and the detection frequency increased significantly
between the samples collected the most upstream and the most downstream of the
Paris urban area. The calculated viral fluxes demonstrated clearly the measurable
impact of WWTP effluents on the viral contamination of the Seine River. The viral
load was seasonal for almost all enteric viruses, in accordance with the
gastroenteritis recordings provided by the French medical authorities. These
results implied the existence of a close relationship between the health status
of inhabitants and the viral contamination of WWTP effluents and consequently
surface water contamination. Subsequently, the regular analysis of wastewater
could serve as a proxy for the monitoring of the human viruses circulating in
both a population and surface water.
