Single amino acid changes in the turnip mosaic virus viral genome-linked protein 
(VPg) confer virulence towards Arabidopsis thaliana mutants knocked out for

Previous resistance analyses of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants knocked out for
eukaryotic translation initiation factors showed that disruption of the
At-eIF(iso)4E or both the At-eIF(iso)4G1 and At-eIF(iso)4G2 genes resulted in
resistance against turnip mosaic virus (TuMV). This study selected TuMV virulent 
variants that overcame this resistance and showed that two independent mutations 
in the region coding for the viral genome-linked protein (VPg) were sufficient to
restore TuMV virulence in At-eIF(iso)4E and At-eIF(iso)4G1xAt-eIF(iso)4G2
knockout plants. As a VPg-eIF(iso)4E interaction has been shown previously to be 
critical for TuMV infection, a systematic analysis of the interactions between A.
thaliana eIF4Es and VPgs of virulent and avirulent TuMVs was performed. The
results suggest that virulent TuMV variants may use an eIF4F-independent pathway.
