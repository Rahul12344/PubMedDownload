The importance of investigating immunity in healthy children has been underscored
in the last few years by studies of the immune pathology of childhood illnesses, 
including human immunodeficiency virus. This study reports both ennumerative and 
functional immune measures in healthy inner city children. A total of 152 of 207 
children studied were completely heathy at the time of venipuncture and were
included in this study. Laboratory immune batteries were completed (or begun) the
same day as venipuncture. Relationships between age, gender, ethnicity, and
immunity were then analyzed. We found that gender predicted both the absolute
number and the percentage of T cells and helper cells and the percentage of
natural killer cells. Total leukocyte counts and percentages of lymphocytes and
granulocytes were related to ethnicity, as was the response to mitogen
stimulation (concanavalin A and pokeweed mitogen) and phagocytic ability. In
conclusion, age, gender, and ethnicity factors were found to contribute to
differences in various immune measures in children and require further
investigation.
