There is currently an urgent need for a viable, cheap, and readily available
treatment for the Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa. Here, it is proposed that 
melatonin may have significant utility in helping the management of this
outbreak. Optimizing natural killer (NK) cell responses seems crucial to
surviving Ebola virus infection. Melatonin increases NK cell cytotoxicity
significantly, suggesting efficacy in managing the Ebola virus. Under conditions 
of challenge, melatonin increases heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which inhibits Ebola
virus replication. Melatonin also has protective effects in cases of septic
shock, which, although bacterial, has similar end-point presentations involving
blood vessel leakage. Melatonin's effects on haemorrhage are mediated primarily
by a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines. By optimizing the appropriate immune
response, melatonin is likely to afford protection to those at high risk of Ebola
viral infection, as well as having direct impacts on the course of infection per 
se. Although no direct data pertain to the utility of melatonin in the management
of the Ebola virus, convergent bodies of data suggest its utility, which is
reviewed in this article.
