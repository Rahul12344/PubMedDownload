Characterization of the HIV epidemic in Thailand has benefited from the
systematic testing of young men upon entry into the military. These data, which
have shown that public health measures can reverse an HIV epidemic, have been
reanalyzed with current geographic information systems methods. The resulting
maps are, thus far, the best means of visualizing the geography of the dynamic
HIV epidemic in Thailand.
