Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) has been used as an experimental vaccine
vector against respiratory infections. We have tested the safety and
immunogenicity of a recombinant virus expressing the hemagglutinin of measles
virus (MVA-MV-H) using the mouse model of measles virus induced encephalitis and 
the cotton rat model for respiratory infection. MVA-MV-H proved to induce a TH1
response, neutralizing antibodies and conferred protection against both
encephalitis and lung infection. The cotton rat is very sensitive to infection
with replication competent vaccinia virus. In these animals MVA-MV-H proved to be
a very well tolerated vaccine. However, the efficiency in the presence of MV
specific maternal antibodies was low (even using a prime-boost strategy) and
therefore might have to be improved.
