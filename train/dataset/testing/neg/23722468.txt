BACKGROUND: Somatostatin receptor 1 (SSTR1) was preferentially methylated in
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive gastric cancer using promoter methylation
array. We aimed to analyse the epigenetic alteration and biological function of
SSTR1 in EBV-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC).
METHODS: Promoter methylation was examined by combined bisulphite restriction
analysis (COBRA) and pyrosequencing. The biological functions of SSTR1 were
evaluated by loss- and gain-of-function assays.
RESULTS: Promoter hypermethylation of SSTR1 was detected in EBV-positive gastric 
cancer cell lines (AGS-EBV) with SSTR1 transcriptional silence, but not in
EBV-negative gastric cancer cell lines with SSTR1 expression. Expression level of
SSTR1 was restored in AGS-EBV by exposure to demethylating agent. Moreover,
methylation level of SSTR1 was significantly higher in EBV-positive primary
gastric cancers compared with EBV-negative gastric cancers (P=0.004). Knock-down 
of SSTR1 in gastric cancer cell lines (AGS and BGC823) increased cell
proliferation and colony formation ability, and promoted G1 to S-phase
transition, enhanced cell migration and invasive ability. In contrast, ectopic
expression of SSTR1 in gastric cancer cell lines (MKN28 and MGC803) significantly
suppressed cell growth in culture conditions and reduced tumour size in nude
mice. The tumour suppressive effect of SSTR1 was associated with upregulation of 
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p16, p15, p27 and p21); downregulation of
oncogenes (MYC and MDM2), key cell proliferation and pro-survival regulators
(PI3KR1, AKT, BCL-XL and MET); and inhibition of the migration/invasion-related
genes (integrins, MMP1 (matrix metallopeptidase 1), PLAUR (plasminogen activator 
urokinase receptor) and IL8 (interleukin 8)).
CONCLUSION: Somatostatin receptor 1 is a novel methylated gene driven by EBV
infection in gastric cancer cells and acts as a potential tumour suppressor.
