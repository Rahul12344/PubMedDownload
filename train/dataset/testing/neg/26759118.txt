BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent form of dementia in the
elderly and no effective treatment is currently available. The mechanisms
triggering AD onset and progression are still imperfectly dissected. We aimed at 
deciphering the modifications occurring in vivo during the very early stages of
AD, before the development of amyloid deposits, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal
death and inflammation. Most current AD models based on Amyloid Precursor Protein
(APP) overproduction beginning from in utero, to rapidly reproduce the
histological and behavioral features of the disease within a few months, are not 
appropriate to study the early steps of AD development. As a means to mimic in
vivo amyloid APP processing closer to the human situation in AD, we used an
adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based transfer of human mutant APP and Presenilin 1 
(PS1) genes to the hippocampi of two-month-old C57Bl/6 J mice to express human
APP, without significant overexpression and to specifically induce its amyloid
processing.
RESULTS: The human APP, βCTF and Aβ42/40 ratio were similar to those in
hippocampal tissues from AD patients. Three months after injection the murine Tau
protein was hyperphosphorylated and rapid synaptic failure occurred characterized
by decreased levels of both PSD-95 and metabolites related to neuromodulation, on
proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS). Astrocytic GLT-1 transporter
levels were lower and the tonic glutamatergic current was stronger on
electrophysiological recordings of CA1 hippocampal region, revealing the
overstimulation of extrasynaptic N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) which
precedes the loss of long-term potentiation (LTP). These modifications were
associated with early behavioral impairments in the Open-field, Y-maze and Morris
Mater Maze tasks.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, this demonstrates that an AD-like APP processing,
yielding to levels of APP, βCTF and Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio similar to those observed in 
AD patients, are sufficient to rapidly trigger early steps of the amyloidogenic
and Tau pathways in vivo. With this strategy, we identified a sequence of early
events likely to account for disease onset and described a model that may
facilitate efforts to decipher the factors triggering AD and to evaluate early
neuroprotective strategies.
