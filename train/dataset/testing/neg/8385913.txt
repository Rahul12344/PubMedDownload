Homologs of the herpes simplex virus gB gene were identified in two
alpha-herpesviruses of platyrrhine monkeys, Herpesvirus saimiri 1 (HVS 1) and H. 
ateles 1 (HVA 1). These genes were cloned and sequenced in their entirety.
Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequences indicated that the gB
glycoproteins of these two viruses are of similar size, have 10 Cys residues and 
5 potential N-linked glycosylation sites which align exactly with those in other 
primate alpha-herpesvirus gB polypeptides, and have a similar distribution of
predicted secondary structural features, all of which indicate a conserved
structure of the gB polypeptide. Alignment of these two gB sequences with those
of four other primate alpha-herpesviruses (SA 8, B virus, HSV 1 and HSV 2)
revealed localized regions of extensive sequence divergence as well as highly
conserved regions. On comparison of the six primate virus gB sequences, the gBs
of the two platyrrhine monkey viruses form a subgroup separate from that of the
four catarrhine virus gBs. The degree of relatedness of the HVA 1 and HVS 1 gB
sequences to each other was equivalent to the degree of relatedness between the
human and the cercopithecine monkey virus gB sequences.
