An understanding of the immunopathogenic mechanisms of infection with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is fundamental in developing successful approaches
to designing effective therapeutic and vaccine strategies. In this regard, we
have investigated the mechanisms by which HIV inserts itself into the human
immune system and uses the elaborate cytokine network to its own replicative
advantage. We have also shown that the burden of HIV in CD4+ T cells is directly 
associated with a decline in this cell population in vivo and a progression to
disease. Mononuclear phagocytes may play a role in the pathogenesis of HIV
infection by serving as reservoirs of the virus. Of note is the fact that
monocytes in the peripheral blood of HIV-infected individuals are rarely infected
in vivo, whereas infected-tissue macrophages may play a role in organ-specific
HIV-related pathogenesis. The role of HIV-specific humoral and cell-mediated
immunity in HIV infection is not well understood. However, fine specificity of
responses against HIV have been delineated in some in-vitro systems. It is
unclear why these responses, particularly HIV-specific cytolytic T-cell
responses, diminish over the course of infection and are unable to contain
progression of infection.
