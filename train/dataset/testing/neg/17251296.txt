Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) virions contain heat shock proteins
(HSP), but these proteins have received limited attention. The objectives of this
study were to establish if the microbial 70-kDa HSP exerts an inhibitory effect
on the HIV-1 infection of human CD4+ T cells, to identify an inhibitory peptide
epitope within the sequence of HSP70, and to evaluate the kinetic features of any
inhibitory activity. The results of these studies suggest that microbial HSP70
exerts dose-dependent inhibition on CCR5 (R5) strains of clades B, C, and D of
HIV-1 infecting human CD4+ T cells. The site of the HIV-1-inhibitory function was
identified within the C-terminal peptide binding domain of HSP70, and the
function is expressed by the peptide epitope comprising amino acids 407 to 426.
The mechanism of inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity by HSP70 is blocking of the CCR5
coreceptors directly and indirectly by inducing CC chemokines and APOBEC3G. The
inhibitory effect of HSP70, its C-terminal fragment, or peptide 407-426 may make 
HSP70 useful as a microbicidal agent. A potentiating noncognate inhibition of
HIV-1 infectivity by combined treatment with HSP70 and monoclonal or polyclonal
antibody to CCR5 was demonstrated. This novel strategy may be utilized in
therapeutic immunization against HIV-1 infection.
