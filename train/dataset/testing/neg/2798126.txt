Transcription factor IIIC2 is required for in vitro transcription of the
adenovirus 2 VA1 gene and binds with high affinity to its B-box promoter element 
which is an 18 bp perfect inverted repeat. Partial proteolysis of TFIIIC2 with
chymotrypsin and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease yielded a species which
produced a discrete band in a gel shift assay with about twice the mobility of
the undigested complex. Chymotrypsin-digested TFIIIC2 produced a DNase I
footprint virtually identical to that of the undigested protein, but the
stability of the protein-VA1 DNA complex was drastically reduced and the in vitro
transcriptional activity was eliminated. These results indicate that a
chymotrypsin-resistant domain of TFIIIC2 binds to the B-box sequence. We
speculate that stable binding requires protease sensitive cooperative
interactions between TFIIIC2 DNA-binding domains.
