Zoonoses are infectious diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans. 
Transmission occurs directly or through vectors such as ticks, mosquitoes, or
flies. The causative agents include bacteria, parasites, viruses, and fungi.
Domestic pets and livestock, as well as wild animals, can be the source of
disease. In this summary, we will focus on a number of dermatologically relevant 
examples.
