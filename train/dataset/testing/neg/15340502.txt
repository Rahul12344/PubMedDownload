BACKGROUND: To study characteristics of peripheral T cell subsets in 94 children 
with chronic hepatitis B and to elucidate its relationships with clinical status 
and hepatic pathology.
METHODS: Peripheral T cell subsets were detected using flow cytometric analysis
with specific monoclonal antibodies staining in 94 patients with HBV infection.
The authors simultaneously detected their serum ALT, markers of HBV infection and
examined liver biopsy material for pathological changes.
RESULTS: In patients with serious liver lesion, the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ cells was 
significantly higher than those with mild lesion (1.41+/-0.54 vs 1.08+/-0.35, P
less than 0.05), which seemed to be associated with the various liver lesions
among the patients. In female cases, the levels of CD4+ T cells and the ratio of 
CD4+/CD8+ T cells were higher than their counterpart in male cases (33.1+/-5.39
vs 28.8+/-6.28, 1.28+/-0.32 vs 1.02+/-0.36, P less than 0.05), but the level of
CD8+ T cells was lower than those in males (26.79+/-4.66 vs 30.51+/-7.17, P less 
than 0.05). There was no obvious correlation between T cell subsets and
circulating HBV viral load, the size of spleen among the HBV-infected children.
CONCLUSION: The characteristics of peripheral T cell subsets probably suggests
the immune disorder occurred in these children with hepatitis B compared with
healthy controls and its mechanism needs further investigation.
