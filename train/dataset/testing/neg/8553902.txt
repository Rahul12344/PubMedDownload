At the present time, in no other system are the signals required for isotype
switching better understood than in the IgE system. IgE switching is therefore
becoming a general model for "directed" isotype switching in mice and humans. The
study of IgE regulation has proposed a paradigm of general importance for
immunology in the nineties, namely, the requirement for at least two signals in
order to trigger the final event, in this case DNA switch recombination to the
IgE isotype. The first signal is delivered by a cytokine, IL-4 or IL-13, and is
responsible for the choice of the isotype. The second signal is typically
delivered upon engagement of CD40 on B cells by the CD40 ligand expressed on T
cells, and results in switching and production of IgE. We shall herein discuss
the two-signal model for IgE switching in detail, stressing in particular the
cross-talk between signals, and the mechanisms responsible for IgE amplification.
