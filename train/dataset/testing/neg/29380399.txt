AIMS: The programmed death 1 (PD1)/PD1 ligand (PD-L1) axis plays an important
role in tumour cells escape from immune control. PD-L1 immunohistochemistry is a 
useful predictor of immunotherapy response, but is still not used widely in the
diagnostic setting. Here we describe results using PD-L1 immunohistochemistry
during routine diagnostics in lymphoma.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Ninety-one lymphoproliferative disease cases sharing tumour 
and non-malignant Hodgkin-Reed-Sternberg (HRS)-like cells with and without
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) association were investigated by immunohistochemistry
for PD-L1 (clone SP142). PD-L1 expression was present in more than 5% of tumour
or non-malignant HRS-like cells in 100% of EBV+ classical (C) Hodgkin lymphoma
(HL) (n = 10) and EBV-negative nodular sclerosis CHL (n = 8); 40% of EBV+ diffuse
large B cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (DLBCL-NOS) (n = 20); and 4% of
nodal peripheral T cell lymphoma of follicular helper T cell type (PTCL-TFH)
(n = 22). In contrast, nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (n = 4), lymphocyte-rich
CHL (n = 6), EBV+ hyperplasia (n = 8), plasmablastic lymphoma (n = 3) and
anaplastic lymphoma kinase-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (n = 5) seldom
exhibited PD-L1 in their large cells. Assessing PD-L1 positivity in tumour and
non-malignant large cells was helpful in differentiating between CHL versus nodal
PTCL-TFH (P < 0.0001) or EBV+ DLBCL-NOS (P = 0.0052) and between EBV+ DLBCL-NOS
versus nodal PTCL-TFH (P = 0.0052), with PD-L1 expression indicating the first
diagnosis in each of those sets.
CONCLUSION: Immunohistochemical evaluation of PD-L1 expression in tumour and
non-malignant HRS-like large cells may be useful for assessing either immune
escape or immunodeficiency in their pathogenesis.
