An automated biosensor system designed for measuring molecular interactions in
real time and without any labelling of the reactants has been used to study the
interaction of two animal viruses (vaccinia virus and poliovirus) and two plant
viruses (cowpea mosaic virus and tobacco mosaic virus) with monoclonal
antibodies. Using monoclonal antibodies specific for different conformational
states of viral protein, it was found that the virus particles retained their
conformational integrity when immobilized on the dextran matrix present on the
sensor chip. Compared to conventional solid phase immunoassays, in which
immobilized proteins are usually partly denatured, the biosensor system presents 
several advantages for studying virus-antibody interaction.
