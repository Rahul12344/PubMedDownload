In our recent studies, we found that LMP1 encoded by Epstein-Barr virus could
accelerate the formation of active c-Jun/Jun B heterodimer. We studied the
regulation of cyclinD1 by c-Jun/Jun B heterodimers by laser scanning confocal
influorescence microscopy, Western blot, luciferase activity assay, super-EMSA
and flow cytometry in the Tet-on-LMP1 HNE2 cell line, in which LMP1 expression
was regulated by Tet-on system. c-Jun/Jun B heterodimers induced by LMP1 could up
regulate cyclin D1 promoter activity and expression. Overexpression of cyclin D1 
accelerated the progression of cell cycle.
