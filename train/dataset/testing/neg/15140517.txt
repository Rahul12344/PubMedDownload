OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that p53 homozygous Arg/Arg genotype at codon
72 is a significant risk factor for the development of HPV induced cervical
cancer.
STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey on p53 allelotypes distribution in women
with different grade of cervical lesions and with or without HPV infection, in
comparison to the distribution on a control group of women cytologically normal
and HPV negative.
RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in the p53 polymorphism
distribution was found in relation to the infection with HPV, the cytological
pattern and both conditions. A modest but constant over-representation of
Pro-allelotypes was found in all groups in comparison to the control group.
CONCLUSION: Searching for p53 polymorphism in a clinical setting does not seem to
support secondary prevention procedures, at least for women in this area.
