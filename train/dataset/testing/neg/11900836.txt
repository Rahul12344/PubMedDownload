Virulent avian influenza A viruses produce lethal disease in chickens. Since cell
death can be caused by either necrosis or apoptosis, we investigated the types of
cell death that occur in natural hosts, chickens, infected with virulent avian
viruses. Using biochemical methods, we demonstrate that virulent avian influenza 
viruses induce apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells in liver, kidney, and
brain. Viral antigens were also detected in these organs, suggesting that viral
replication induces apoptosis in infected chickens. These results indicate that
apoptosis does occur in virulent avian influenza virus infection in a natural
host, and may contribute to the lethality of the virus.
