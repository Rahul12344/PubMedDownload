BACKGROUND: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the causative agent for enteric non-A,
non-B hepatitis. Transmission is via the faecal route but the possibility of
transmission by blood has been raised. Data concerning anti-HEV prevalence among 
chronic haemodialysis (HD) patients are few and give conflicting results.
METHODS: We tested for anti-HEV antibody 204 chronic HD patients attending a
single dialysis unit. A specific solid-phase enzyme-linked immunoassay (Abbott
HEV EIA) was used.
RESULTS: We found six anti-HEV-positive patients, the anti-HEV prevalence was 3% 
(95% CI 0-6%). The prevalence rates of HBV and HCV infections were 39% (31-45%)
and 22% (16-28%) respectively. No anti-HEV-positive patient showed past or
current biochemical signs of liver damage. One of six (17%) anti-HEV-positive
patients was an immigrant; no risk factor for anti-HEV antibody was identified in
the other anti-HEV-positive individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed a low anti-HEV prevalence: there was no association
between HEV and blood-borne infections (HBV, HCV, and HIV) in our HD patients;
most anti-HEV-positive patients we found were probably related to a local
infection by HEV. This is one of the first reports concerning seroepidemiology of
HEV infection in a large cohort of chronic HD individuals.
