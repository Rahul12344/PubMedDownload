STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: Verrucous carcinoma of the foot is often misdiagnosed
initially as plantar warts. Delayed diagnostic treatments with the use of optimal
biopsy techniques may result in significant hindrances for patient care and may
often result in detrimental outcomes to the patient. With the use of various
epidermal biopsy methods, early diagnostic treatment can be implemented to a
slow-growing lesion unresponsive to topical agents preventing unfavorable pedal
amputations.
DESIGN: A case study of verrucous carcinoma of the foot with surgical resection
was conducted along with a literature review.
BACKGROUND: Verrucous carcinoma (VC) of the foot is known to be a rare, locally
invasive, well-differentiated low-grade squamous cell carcinoma that may evolve
from the human papilloma virus. This localized tumor of the foot often has low
metastatic potential, however can be quite invasive. It is therefore pertinent to
obtain adequate radiological studies when planning for surgical resection of this
tumor. When localized to the foot, it often involves deep structures such as
tendons, muscle & bone. Complete wide local excision of the tumor is essential to
avoid recurrence. We present a case of verrucous carcinoma of the foot in a
46-year-old African American male with a past medical history of Human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Human papilloma virus (HPV). The patient refused
a Transmetatarsal amputation. The loss of the third digit was a result of tissue 
loss following resection and an attempt to relocate a severely laterally
dislocated 3rd digit, not PVD.
