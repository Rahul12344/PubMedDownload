INTRODUCTION: Cryptococcosis is the second most frequent cause of opportunistic
infections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients in Colombia. We aimed
to determine the prevalence of cryptococcosis in the Colombian department of
Atlántico.
METHODS: An active search for cryptococcosis cases was conducted between 2015 and
2017 in health institutions by distributing surveys to clinicians and
characterizing samples phenotypically and genotypically.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight cryptococcosis cases were identified (81.6% men, 76.3% HIV 
patients). The calculated annual prevalence was 5.08/1 million inhabitants.
Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii VNI was isolated in 34 cases.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the basis for passive surveillance of
cryptococcosis.
