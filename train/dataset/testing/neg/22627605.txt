BACKGROUND: HIV-1 strains have diversified extensively through mutation and
recombination since their initial transmission to human beings many decades ago
in Central Africa in the first part of the 20th Century (between 1915 and 1941). 
The upward trend in global HIV-1 diversity has continued unabated, with newer
groups, subtypes, and unique and circulating recombinants increasingly being
reported, especially in Africa.
OBJECTIVE: In this review, we focus on the extensive diversity of HIV-1 over a
decade (2000-2011), in 51 countries of the three African geographic regions
(eastern and southern, western and central, and northern Africa) as per the
WHO/UNAIDS 2010 classification.
METHODOLOGY: References for this review were identified through searches of
PubMed, conference abstracts, Google Scholar, and Springer Online Archives
Collection. We retrieved 273 citations, of which 200 reported HIV-1 diversity
from Africa from January, 2000 to August, 2011. Articles resulting from these
searches and relevant references cited in those articles were reviewed. Articles 
published in English and French were included.
FINDINGS: There has been a high diversity of HIV-1 in its epicenter, west-central
Africa. A few subtypes, namely, A (A1, A2, A3, A4, A5), C, CRF02_AG, and D
accounted for about 85% of new infections. Subtype A and D have been stable in
East Africa; C in southern Africa; A, G, CRF02_AG, and CRF06_cpx in western
Africa; and subtype B and CRF02_AG in northern Africa. Recently a new putative
group, designated P, was reported to be found in two Cameroonians.
CONCLUSION: The regional distributions of individual subtypes and recombinants
are broadly stable, although unique/circulating recombinant forms may play an
increasing role in the HIV pandemic. Understanding the kinetics and directions of
this continuing adaptation and its impact on viral fitness, immunogenicity, and
pathogenicity are crucial to the successful design of effective HIV vaccines.
There is need for regular monitoring and review updates, such as the one
presented here, to assist countries to plan and anticipate complex forms that may
be introduced with time.
