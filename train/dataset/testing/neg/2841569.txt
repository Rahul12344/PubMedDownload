We have constructed several plasmids to test the specificity of target selection 
for IS102 associated deletions. We had previously shown that the cIII region of
phage lambda is a target for IS102 mediated deletions and this region was
therefore introduced in pSC101, where IS102 resides, in such a way that it was
silent, transcribed or fully expressed. The deletion selection was provided by
the galactokinase system. The results we have obtained show that transcription of
the target region is required for deletion formation. The frequency of deletions 
in this target depends on its position along the transcript and is also
influenced by translation. Implications of these results on the regional
specificity of transposition are discussed.
