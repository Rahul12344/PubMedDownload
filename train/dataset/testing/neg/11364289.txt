AIDS: Treatment with protease inhibitors, drugs that inhibit HIV protease, an
essential enzyme for the survival of the HIV virus, decreases HIV to undetectable
levels and has generated great optimism. Although far from finding a cure, these 
findings are steps toward understanding HIV. In December 1995, the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approved saquinavir, followed by Norvir and Crixivan, all of
which are protease inhibitors. Although the availability of these drugs varies,
efforts are being made to provide the drugs to everyone. President Bill Clinton
has asked Congress to approve $52 million, a 50 percent increase for AIDS
research, to assist people who need these drugs throughout the country. In Latin 
America, efforts have been made to approve these drugs. According to Miklos
Salgo, director of virology at Hoffmann-La Roche, Brazil has been the first
country in Central and South America to approve saquinavir. Other scientists are 
optimistic that these new drugs will arrive in Latin America within a year.
