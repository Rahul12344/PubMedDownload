5-[(Hydroxymethyl)-O-pyrophosphoryl]uracil, an intermediate in the biosynthesis
of alpha-putrescinylthymine in deoxyribonucleic acid of bacteriophage phi W-14.

Maltman KL, Neuhard J, Warren RA.

In a nonpermissive host, an amber mutant, am 37, of bacteriophage phi W-14
synthesizes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of considerably greater buoyant density
than the DNA synthesized by wild-type phage. The am 37 DNA lacks the
hypermodified pyrimidine, alpha-putrescinylthymine (putThy). Instead, it contains
a new modified base, 5-[(hydroxymethyl)-O-pyrophosphoryl]uracil (hmPPUra).
Extracts of cells infected with wild-type phi W-14 convert the hmPPUra in am 37
DNA to putThy when incubated with putrescine.
