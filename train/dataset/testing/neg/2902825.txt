Human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)--associated myelopathy (HAM) has been 
shown to be closely related to HTLV-I infection. However, the mechanism by which 
this disease occurs after infection with HTLV-I is still obscure. We found that
HAM patients have unusually high proportions of CD4+ HLA-DR+ cells, CD8+HLA-DR+
cells, OKT9+ cells, and CD38(OKT10)+ cells in their peripheral blood, all of
which suggest the presence of activated T-lymphocytes. Antibody titer against
HTLV-I was much higher in HAM patients than in HTLV-I carriers without evident
neurological disease (p less than 0.01). Polyclonal gammopathy was also observed 
in most HAM patients, and 6 of 10 patients were positive for rheumatoid factor.
These observations, coupled with the previous observation that corticosteroid
therapy improves clinical symptoms in some patients, make it likely that
continuous activation of the immune system, initiated by HTLV-I infection, plays 
a key role in the pathogenesis of HAM.
