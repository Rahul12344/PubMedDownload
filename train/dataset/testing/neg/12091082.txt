BACKGROUND: PCR detection of CSF Herpes virus DNA is an important tool in the
diagnosis of CNS infections. Use of this test has been shown to have an impact on
patient management as measured by shortened patient stays, specific therapeutic
intervention, reduction of empirical expensive therapy administration, all of
which should translate into significant health care savings.
OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed at implementing, and evaluating both
clinically and analytically the performance of several commercially available PCR
based assays for the detection of Herpes virus infections of the CNS.
STUDY DESIGN: A total of 314 patients with suspected CNS Herpesvirus infection
were investigated, between 1999 and 2001, by Stair primers PCR. Starting on
January 2002, two commercially available real-time-PCR systems were implemented
and tested using the Stair primers PCR assay as golden standard and three
external control proficiency panels along with serial dilutions of positive
clinical samples.
RESULTS: Sensitivity of the assay was determined to be <200 copies per ml for HSV
and <1250 copies per ml for CMV. Positive results were obtained for 17 patients
(6 HSV-1, 1 HSV-2, 1 EBV, 1 CMV, 6 VZV and 2 HHV-6) whose clinical and analytical
findings were consistent with the PCR results. A real-time-PCR procedure was
introduced in 2002 with similar sensitivity, but a more rapid response.
CONCLUSION: Conventional end-point PCR proved useful to the diagnosis of CNS
herpes virus infection, with an impact on the clinical intervention. However, the
use of Real-Time-PCR has greatly enhanced these advantages, making results
available at a much earlier time, thus significantly reducing the need for
empirical treatment.
