A combination of gene and cell-based therapies may provide significant advantages
over existing treatments in terms of their effectiveness. However, long-term
efficient gene delivery has been difficult to achieve in many cell types,
including endothelial cells. We developed a freeze-thaw technique which
significantly increases the transduction efficiency of recombinant
adeno-associated virus vectors in human aortic endothelial cells (23-fold) and in
human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (128-fold) in comparison to current
methods for transduction. Freeze-thaw resulted in a transient but significant
increase in cell surface area by 1,174 +/- 69.8 microM2 per cell. Reduction of
cryogenic medium volume and repeated freeze-thaw further increased transduction
efficiency by 2.8- and 2.4-fold, respectively. Trypsinization, dimethylsulfoxide,
and cold temperatures, which are also involved in cell preservation, had no
significant impact on transduction efficiency. Increased transduction was also
observed in mesenchymal stem cells (42-fold) by the freeze-thaw method. The
potential mechanism of this novel technique likely involves an increase in the
net permeable area of biological membranes caused by water crystallization. These
findings provide a new approach for gene delivery in various cell types,
particularly in those resistant to transduction by conventional methods.
