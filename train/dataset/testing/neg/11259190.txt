Loading of most endogenous peptides on major histocompatibility complex class I
molecules is conditional on their transport into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
by the peptide transporter TAP. We describe an HSV-2/1 cross-reactive cytotoxic
T-cell (CTL) epitope that is processed in a TAP1-independent manner in vivo
following immunization of TAP1-/- mice with naked DNA or a recombinant vaccinia
virus. These data indicated that TAP1-independent processing of endogenous
proteins is sufficient to prime CTLs in vivo. TAP1-independent processing of this
epitope was not due to ER targeting by signal sequences and exogenous loading of 
MHC-I molecules and was not influenced by the amino acids flanking this epitope. 
In contrast, TAP1-/- mice infected with HSV-2 or HSV-2 mutants did not mount a
CTL response against this epitope.
