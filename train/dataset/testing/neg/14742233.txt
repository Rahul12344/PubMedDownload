A class of betulinic acid derivatives was synthesized to target two critical
steps in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication cycle, entry
and maturation. Each mechanism of HIV-1 inhibition is distinct from clinically
available anti-HIV therapeutics. The viral determinants of the antientry and
antimaturation activities are the bridging sheet of HIV-1 gp120 and the P24/p2
cleavage site, respectively.
