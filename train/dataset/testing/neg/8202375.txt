Extremely high frequencies of the A nucleotide are found in the RNA genomes of
the lentivirus group of retroviruses. It is presently unknown what molecular
force is responsible for this A-pressure. In this manuscript, we demonstrate a
correlation between this 'A-pressure' and the amino acid-usage of the lentivirus 
family. We compared the amino acid composition of the Gag and Pol proteins of the
human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) with that of the
second group of human retroviruses; the human T-cell leukemia viruses type I and 
II (HTLV-I and HTLV-II). Differences in total amino acid content correlate with
the preference for A-rich codons in the HIV genome. A pair-wise comparison of
homologous amino acid positions in the Pol proteins indicates that both
conservative and non-conservative changes can be accounted for by this A-bias.
The putative molecular mechanism underlying this A-pressure and the evolutionary 
consequences are discussed.
