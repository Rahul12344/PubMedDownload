Chicken infectious anaemia virus (CIAV) is an economically important and a highly
immunosuppressive virus affecting poultry industry worldwide. In this study we
assessed the immunomodulatory effects of four herbal preparations namely Withania
somnifera, Tinospora cordifolia, Azadirachta indica and E Care Se Herbal in
resisting the viral multiplication and immunosuppression inflicted by CIAV in
chicks. Day-old chicks (n = 90) were randomly and equally divided into six groups
(Groups A-F). Groups A-D were administered with purified extracts of W.
somnifera, T. cordifolia, A. indica and E Care Se Herbal, respectively followed
by the evaluation of viral load in lymphoid organs by quantitative real-time PCR 
and cell mediated immune response by flow cytometric analysis of CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cells. Groups A-D were found to resist CIAV multiplication and pathogenesis with 
significant reduction of viral load compared with the infected control
(P < 0.05). Group A-C chicks showed significantly higher (P < 0.05) CD4+ and CD8+
T cell counts compared to control birds while of E Care Se Herb had minimal
effect on T cell count. The findings suggested that the herbal preparations used 
during the study were effective as both prophylactic and immunomodulatory agents 
and thus have potential of being used against CIAV induced immunosuppression in
poultry.
