Recently, several pyrimidine and purine 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides have been shown 
to inhibit the replication of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV), the
causative agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). These
compounds are usually prepared by reduction of the corresponding
2'-deoxynucleosides. The present experiments demonstrate that
2',3'-dideoxynucleosides can also be made by enzymatic trans-glycosylation, using
the trans-N-deoxyribosylase from Lactobacillus helveticus. The broad specificity 
of this enzyme makes it possible to synthesize for metabolic studies
radiochemically pure 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides, using diverse purine and
pyrimidine base acceptors.
