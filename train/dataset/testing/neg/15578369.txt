The potential consequences of a competently executed smallpox attack have not
been adequately considered by policy makers. The possibility of release of an
aerosolized and/or bioengineered virus must be anticipated and planned for. The
transmission and infectivity of variola virus are examined. Arguments for and
against pre-event vaccination are offered. The likely morbidity and mortality
that would ensue from implementation of a mass pre-event vaccination program,
within reasonable boundaries, are known. The extent of contagion that could
result from an aerosolized release of virus is unknown and may have been
underestimated. Pre-event vaccination of first responders is urged, and voluntary
vaccination programs should be offered to the public. Two defenses against a
vaccine-resistant, engineered variola virus are proposed for consideration.
Methisazone, an overlooked drug, is reported to be effective for prophylaxis
only. The extent of reduction in the incidence of smallpox with use of this agent
is uncertain. It is useless for treatment of clinical smallpox. N-100 respirators
(face masks) worn by uninfected members of the public may prevent transmission of
the virus.
