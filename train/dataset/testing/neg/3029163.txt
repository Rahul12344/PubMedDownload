Genomic variation of adenovirus type 5 isolates recovered from bone marrow
transplant recipients.

Webb DH, Shields AF, Fife KH.

We characterized the genomic variation of adenovirus type 5 isolates recovered
from bone marrow transplant recipients in Seattle between 1976 and 1982. By
restriction endonuclease analysis, we identified three new adenovirus genomic
variants, each associated with a single invasive adenovirus infection. In
addition, we were able to obtain suggestive evidence for a nosocomial spread of a
particular group of isolates within this population. This study demonstrates that
the technique of restriction endonuclease analysis is an important
epidemiological tool for investigating viral infections.
