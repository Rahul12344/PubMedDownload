The 5' splice site signal (5'ss) in Moloney murine sarcoma virus ts110
(MuSVts110) RNA was found to participate in the regulation of its splicing
phenotype. This 5'ss (CAG/GUAGGA) departs from the mammalian consensus
(CAG/GURAGU) at positions +4 and +6, both of which base pair with U1 and U6 small
nuclear RNAs during splicing. A doubling in splicing efficiency and near
elimination of the splicing thermosensitivity characteristic of MuSVts110 were
observed in 5'ss mutants containing a U at position +6 (termed 5' A6U), even in
those in which U1-5'ss complementarity had been reduced. At the permissive
temperature (28 degrees C), the 5' A6U mutation increased the efficiency of the
second splicing reaction, while at the nonpermissive temperature (39 degrees C), 
both splicing reactions were positively affected.
