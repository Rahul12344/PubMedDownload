SETTING: Although the incidence of tuberculosis had been decreasing for many
years, it has recently risen.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the changes in the pattern and distribution of
intestinal tuberculosis and to alert surgeons to the importance of maintaining a 
high index of suspicion for this disease entity.
DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of 134 patients with intestinal tuberculosis
discharged from the Veterans General Hospital in Taipei from 1965 to 1995. All
records, bacteriological examinations and pathological specimens were reviewed
and extracted onto a standard questionnaire.
RESULTS: A decline in the case numbers of intestinal tuberculosis was noted after
1975. However, there seems to be a slight rise in case numbers since 1990. The
average age of those patients after 1990 (64.8 years) is higher than those before
1990 (44.4 years). None of our patients had clinical signs of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Most patients (81.3%, 109/134) had not
received a definite diagnosis until surgery. Active pulmonary tuberculosis was
found in 37 patients (29.1%).
CONCLUSION: The possible reasons for the rise in cases of intestinal tuberculosis
in our patients may be linked to an increased life expectancy, the reappearance
of some formerly 'silent' tuberculosis cases, and relapse in patients having
received incomplete antituberculosis chemotherapy. Its insidious and non-specific
clinical presentation makes the diagnosis of intestinal tuberculosis difficult.
An increased index of suspicion and greater familiarity with the disease may
shorten the time of diagnosis and may also prevent some unnecessary operations.
