PURPOSE: To genetically explore the fusion protein gene (F) in human
parainfluenza virus type 1 (HPIV1) and type 3 (HPIV3) strains, we analysed them
in patients with acute respiratory infections in Eastern Japan from 2011 to 2015.
METHODOLOGY: We constructed phylogenetic trees based on the HPIV and HPIV3 F gene
using the maximum likelihood method and conducted P-distance and selective
pressure analyses. We also predicted the linear epitopes of the protein in the
prototype strains. Furthermore, we mapped the amino acid substitutions of the
proteins.
RESULTS: Nineteen strains of HPIV1 and 53 strains of HPIV3 were detected among
the clinical acute respiratory infection cases. The phylogenetic trees indicated 
that the HPIV1 and HPIV3 strains were classified into clusters II and III and
cluster C, respectively. The P-distance values of the HPIV1 and HPIV3 F genes
were <0.03. Two positive selection sites were inferred in the HPIV1 (aa 8 and aa 
10), and one positive selection site was inferred in the HPIV3 (aa 108), but over
10 negative selection sites were inferred. Four epitopes were predicted for the
HPIV1 prototype strains, while five epitopes were predicted for the HPIV3
prototype strain. A positive selection site (aa 108) or the HPIV3 F protein was
involved in the predicted epitope. Additionally, we found that an amino acid
substitution (R73K) in the LC76627 HPIV3 strain presumably may affect the
resistance to neutralization by antibodies.
CONCLUSION: The F gene of HPIV1 and HPIV3 was relatively well conserved in the
eastern part of Japan during the investigation period.
