BACKGROUND: Hepatic flares (HF), which reflect hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related
immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), frequently occur in patients 
with HBV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection after the start of
antiretoroviral therapy (ART). The rate of hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg)
and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss is higher for patients with HF after
the initiation of ART.
METHODS: We retrospectively examined the kinetics of the HBsAg and HBeAg levels
of six HBV/HIV coinfected patients after the commencement of ART that included
tenofovir. All were male and HBeAg positive.
RESULTS: Three patients developed HF after the initiation of ART. All
subsequently lost HBeAg and one of them lost HBsAg after HF. None who did not
experience HF lost HBeAg. The HBsAg and HBeAg levels remarkably decreased when HF
occurred, but the decline of HBsAg was very slow in the periods before and after 
HF. The median decline of the HBsAg level at 48 weeks was 2.20 Log IU/mL for
patients with HF, but only 1.00 Log IU/ml for patients without HF. Little decline
was seen for either group in the median decline of the HBsAg level from 48 weeks 
to 96 weeks, 0.28 Log IU/mL in the HF group and 0.06 Log IU/mL in the non-HF
group.
CONCLUSION: The immune reconstitution of a HBV/HIV coinfected patient plays an
important role in the clearance of HBV. If HBsAg and HBeAg levels decrease
rapidly when HF occurs, the hepatic flare would be due to HBV-related IRIS.
