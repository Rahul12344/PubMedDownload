This paper describes characteristics of human amniotic epithelial cells (AEC)
transfected with a gene of origin-defective simian virus (SV) 40 large T-antigen 
(pMTIOD). Normal AEC before transfection with pMTIOD exhibited only low
proliferative potential under our culture conditions. On the other hand, AEC
cells transfected with pMTIOD exhibited greater proliferative potentials. Flow
cytometry and immunohistochemistry analyses showed that both the primary and the 
transfected AEC did not express appreciable levels of class II antigens. However,
the expression of class I antigen of the transfected AEC cells was slightly
increased. The cells obtained in this experiment have the ability to induce
tumors in severely combined immunodeficiency mice. This finding suggests that
established AEC line can be used as a tool to investigate possible expression of 
the desired gene in human AEC and the gene products, however, was not suitable as
a gene carrier to the recipient. Further experiments will be required to
establish AEC as a transgene carrier for somatic cell gene therapy.
