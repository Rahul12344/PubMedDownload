The effect of virus infection on the organism of pregnant mice and their
posterity was studied in experiment. The animals were infected with the prototype
strain A13 (Flores) of Coxsackie virus which was administered on days 4, 7, 11,
15 and 19 of pregnancy. It has been demonstrated that pregnant mice are much more
sensitive to the virus than non-pregnant females and that the placenta, along
with the striped muscles, is the main reservoir of the virus. The obtained
results also suggest that the virus penetrates into the tissues of the embryo
most intensively in the second half of pregnancy and that the duration of
manifestation of the virus in the tissues of the embryo depends on the period of 
intrauterine development. The study of the model system (long-term organ culture 
of the tissues of the organism) enabled us to establish a new fact of the
cytoproliferative activity of A13 Coxsackie virus in the organ culture and in the
placenta of mice infected in vivo, and also in the organ culture of the liver of 
their newborn, which is important for the confirmation of clinical observations
presuming a high probability of intrauterine infection by the mentioned virus
with its subsequent protracted persistence in the organism of the newborn.
