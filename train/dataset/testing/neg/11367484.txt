Barebacking no more: transmission of resistant HIV strains a reality.

Arroyo H.

AIDS: The progress on treating HIV with protease inhibitors is leading many in
the AIDS community to believe that people are becoming complacent about
practicing safer sex. There are many reports from the gay community of
"barebacking", or practicing unprotected receptive anal intercourse with partners
known to be HIV positive. This practice has lead to some infections with protease
inhibitor-resistant strains of HIV. In San Francisco, 1 out of every 35 new
infections is resistant to all 4 approved protease inhibitors and to most of the 
AZT family of drugs. Internet sites are included that provide information on the 
transmission of resistant HIV virus.
