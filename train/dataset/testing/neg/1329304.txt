Two outbreaks of the egg drop syndrome were observed in quail flocks maintained
on a farm together with chickens. The decrease in egg production ranged from 10.6
per cent to 50.6 per cent, and the number of soft-shelled eggs increased with the
decline in egg production. In both the outbreaks haemagglutination inhibiting
antibodies to EDS-76 virus were detected. Fluorescent viral antigen specific to
EDS-76 virus was also detected in the lining epithelial and glandular cells of
the uterus.
