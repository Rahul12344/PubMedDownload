MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression and modulators of
diverse biological pathways. Analyses of miRNA function as well as therapeutic
managing of miRNAs rely on cellular administration of miRNA inhibitors which may 
be achieved by the use of viral vehicles. This study explores the
miRNA-suppressive capacity of inhibitors expressed intracellularly from
lentivirus-derived gene vectors. Superior activity of two decoy-type inhibitors, 
a "Bulged Sponge" with eight miRNA recognition sites and a hairpin-shaped "Tough 
Decoy" containing two miRNA recognition sites, is demonstrated in a side-by-side 
comparison of seven types of miRNA inhibitors transcribed as short RNAs from an
RNA Pol III promoter. We find that lentiviral vectors expressing Tough Decoy
inhibitors are less vulnerable than Bulged Sponge-encoding vectors to targeting
by the cognate miRNA and less prone, therefore, to reductions in transfer
efficiency. Importantly, it is demonstrated that Tough Decoy inhibitors retain
their miRNA suppression capacity in the context of longer RNA transcripts
expressed from an RNA Pol II promoter. Such RNA Pol II-transcribed Tough Decoy
inhibitors are new tools in managing of miRNAs and may have potential for
temporal and spatial regulation of miRNA activity as well as for therapeutic
targeting of miRNAs that are aberrantly expressed in human disease.
