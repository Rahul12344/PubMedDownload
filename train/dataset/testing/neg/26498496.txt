BACKGROUND: Characterising the correlates of HIV persistence improves
understanding of disease pathogenesis and guides the design of curative
strategies. This study investigated factors associated with integrated HIV-1 DNA 
load during consistently suppressive first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART).
METHOD: Total, integrated, and 2-long terminal repeats (LTR) circular HIV-1 DNA, 
residual plasma HIV-1 RNA, T-cell activation markers, and soluble CD14 (sCD14)
were measured in peripheral blood of 50 patients that had received 1-14 years of 
efavirenz-based or nevirapine-based therapy.
RESULTS: Integrated HIV-1 DNA load (per 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells)
was median 1.9 log10 copies (interquartile range 1.7-2.2) and showed a mean
difference of 0.2 log10 copies per 10 years of suppressive ART (95% confidence
interval - 0.2, 0.6; p = 0.28). It was positively correlated with total HIV-1 DNA
load and frequency of CD8(+)HLA-DR/DP/DQ(+) cells, and was also higher in
subjects with higher sCD14 levels, but showed no correlation with levels of 2-LTR
circular HIV-1 DNA and residual plasma HIV-1 RNA, or the frequency of
CD4(+)CD38(+) and CD8(+)CD38(+) cells. Adjusting for pre-ART viral load, duration
of suppressive ART, CD4 cell counts, residual plasma HIV-1 RNA levels, and sCD14 
levels, integrated HIV-1 DNA load was mean 0.5 log10 copies higher for each 50%
higher frequency of CD8(+)HLA-DR/DP/DQ(+) cells (95% confidence interval 0.2,
0.9; p = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The observed positive association between integrated HIV-1 DNA load 
and frequency of CD8(+)DR/DP/DQ(+) cells indicates that a close correlation
between HIV persistence and immune activation continues during consistently
suppressive therapy. The inducers of the distinct activation profile warrant
further investigation.
