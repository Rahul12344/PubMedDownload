BACKGROUND: Delivery of comprehensive care for persons with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in rural and low prevalence settings
presents many challenges. We developed and evaluated a telehealth collaborative
care (TCC) program for persons with HIV in a rural area.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of TCC, and identify factors influencing 
implementation in rural settings.
DESIGN: Mixed methods evaluation of a quality improvement program with
pre-measures and post-measures.
PATIENTS: Veterans with HIV infection in Iowa and Illinois.
INTERVENTION: TCC integrated HIV specialty care delivered by clinical video
telehealth, with primary care delivered by generalist providers, in seven
Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) serving rural areas. Principles
guiding TCC design were: 1) clear delineation of specialty and primary care
clinic roles in co-managed care; 2) creation of processes to improve care
coordination between specialty and primary care teams; and 3) use of a patient
registry for population management across sites.
MEASURES: Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system performance measures for care
for HIV infection and common comorbidities, patient travel time to obtain care,
and patient satisfaction. Qualitative evaluation involved semi-structured
telephone interviews with patients.
KEY RESULTS: Thirty of 32 eligible patients chose TCC over traveling to the HIV
clinic for all care. Among 24 patients in TCC during the June 2011-May 2012
evaluation period, median age was 54 (range, 40-79), most (96 %) were men, and
median CD4 count was 707 cells/cm(3) (range, 233-1307). VA performance measures
were met for > 90 % of TCC patients. Median yearly travel time decreased from
320 min per patient prior to TCC to 170 min during TCC (p < 0.001). Interview
themes included: 1) overcoming privacy concerns during care in local primary care
clinics; 2) tradeoffs between access, continuity, and care coordination; and 3)
the role of specialist involvement in collaborative care.
DISCUSSION: Telehealth Collaborative Care is a feasible approach to providing
accessible and comprehensive care for persons with HIV in rural settings.
