Although efforts to develop a vaccine against HIV have so far met with little
success, recent studies of HIV-positive patients with strongly neutralizing sera 
have shown that the human immune system is capable of producing potent and
broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), some of which neutralize up to 90% of
HIV strains. These antibodies bind conserved vulnerable sites on the viral
envelope glycoprotein gp120, and identification of these sites has provided
exciting clues about the design of potentially effective vaccines. Carbohydrates 
have a key role in this field, as a large fraction of bnAbs bind carbohydrates or
combinations of carbohydrate and peptide elements on gp120. Additionally,
carbohydrates partially mask some peptide surfaces recognized by bnAbs. The use
of engineered glycoproteins and other glycostructures as vaccines to elicit
antibodies with broad neutralizing activity is therefore a key area of interest
in HIV vaccine design.
