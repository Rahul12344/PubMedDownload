In the current work, we have established and characterized a novel cell line from
rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The cell line, designated as RTH (rainbow
trout heart), was obtained by immortalizing heart cells with recombinant
retroviruses that transduced polyoma middle T antigen. This is the first time
such a strategy is used to obtain an immortalized fish cell line. The cells
showed an endothelial-like morphology and characteristics, constitutively
transcribing collagen, selectin and VCAM (vascular cell adhesion molecule), as
well as different chemokines and chemokine receptors, but not cytokeratin. As
already described for heart endothelial cells, RTH cells actively phagocytized
latex beads. Furthermore, RTH cells showed a high susceptibility to viral
hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). VHSV modulated the transcription of Mx,
major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II), VCAM and many of the chemokine and 
chemokine receptors expressed in these cells. Therefore, RTH cells constitute an 
excellent model to study the immune regulation of endothelial cells in fish and
their role in leukocyte extravasation.
