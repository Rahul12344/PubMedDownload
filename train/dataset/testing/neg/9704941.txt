PURPOSE: To describe the recent evolution of antiretroviral prescriptions and to 
look for clinical and biological changes among a population of HIV-infected
patients.
SUBJECTS: Patients received follow-up in the hospital-based information system of
the Groupe d'Epidémiologie Clinique du SIDA en Aquitaine (GECSA), Southwestern
France, from 1995 to 1997.
METHODS: Quarterly evolution of the prescriptions of antiretroviral treatments
and of the population clinical and biological indicators were studied in this
observational survey of computerized records obtained after each hospital
contact.
RESULTS: Overall numbers of patients who received follow-up and of hospital
contacts remained stable. The proportion of untreated patients decreased from
38.5% to 10.5%. Monotherapies were progressively abandoned. Double combination
therapies with two nucleoside analogues were used for 55% of the patients by
early 1996 and then decreased, whereas triple combination therapies with one
protease inhibitor (PI) rapidly increased to comprise up to 40% of the
prescriptions in 1997. PIs were prescribed earlier and earlier in the course of
HIV infection. Overall incidence of AIDS diagnoses and mortality rate decreased
by 18% and 22%, respectively, in the first 9 months of use of PIs compared with
the preceding 9 months, and by 47% and 56%, respectively, in the following 9
months (p<.001). The number of hospitalizations and the proportion of patients
with a CD4 cell count <200/mm3 decreased. AIDS cases diagnosed after introduction
of PIs had rarely been treated with PIs.
CONCLUSION: Over this 3-year period, physicians prescribed antiretroviral
treatments more and more frequently, and triple combination therapy with PI is
now common practice in France. Patients clinical and biological patterns have
improved 18 months after the introduction of PIs.
