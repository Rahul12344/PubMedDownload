BK virus (BKV) nephropathy is one of the major causes of allograft dysfunction or
graft loss in kidney transplant recipients. Early diagnosis and timely reduction 
in immunosuppressant is important for proper treatment. We report a 35-yr-old
male case of cadaveric renal transplantation with BK viral related
tubulointerstitial nephritis complicated by acute rejection. The diagnostic
biopsy showed severe inflammatory infiltrates, tubulitis, and peritubular
capillaritis. Discontinuation of mycophenolate mofetil, prednisone pulse therapy,
and r-globulin was successful in relieving allograft dysfunction.
