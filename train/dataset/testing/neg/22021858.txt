The ability of electrospray to propel large viruses into a mass spectrometer is
established and is rationalized by analogy to the atmospheric transmission of the
common cold. Much less clear is the fate of membrane-embedded molecular machines 
in the gas phase. Here we show that rotary adenosine triphosphatases
(ATPases)/synthases from Thermus thermophilus and Enterococcus hirae can be
maintained intact with membrane and soluble subunit interactions preserved in
vacuum. Mass spectra reveal subunit stoichiometries and the identity of tightly
bound lipids within the membrane rotors. Moreover, subcomplexes formed in
solution and gas phases reveal the regulatory effects of nucleotide binding on
both ATP hydrolysis and proton translocation. Consequently, we can link specific 
lipid and nucleotide binding with distinct regulatory roles.
