Many missense substitutions are identified in single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) data and large-scale random mutagenesis projects. Each amino acid
substitution potentially affects protein function. We have constructed a tool
that uses sequence homology to predict whether a substitution affects protein
function. SIFT, which sorts intolerant from tolerant substitutions, classifies
substitutions as tolerated or deleterious. A higher proportion of substitutions
predicted to be deleterious by SIFT gives an affected phenotype than
substitutions predicted to be deleterious by substitution scoring matrices in
three test cases. Using SIFT before mutagenesis studies could reduce the number
of functional assays required and yield a higher proportion of affected
phenotypes. may be used to identify plausible disease candidates among the SNPs
that cause missense substitutions.
