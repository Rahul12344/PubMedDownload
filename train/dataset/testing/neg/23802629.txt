Although 2-long terminal repeat (2-LTR) circles are only a fraction of the total 
viral DNA in infected cells, sequence analysis of 2-LTR circles reveals critical 
information regarding viral DNA synthesis and the nature of actively replicating 
virus. It was observed that a large proportion of the 2-LTR circular molecules in
the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) DNA of infected individuals are
mutated at the circle junction. The integrase inhibitor raltegravir (RAL) blocks 
the strand transfer step of the integration of HIV-1; as a consequence of
abortive integration a significant increase of episomal 2-LTR circles is
observed. Moreover, it was demonstrated that in patients treated with highly
active retroviral therapy (HAART) changes in 2-LTR concentration did not affect
junction sequences and flanking regions of 2-LTR. Here we evaluated whether RAL
therapy could have a differential impact on the 2-LTR circle junctional sequences
in patients with different virological profiles at the time of starting RAL
therapy. Sequence analysis indicates that RAL acts differently in the two
populations.
