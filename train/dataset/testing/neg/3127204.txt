The Bacillus subtilis phage luminal diameter 29 DNA polymerase, involved in
protein-primed viral DNA replication, was inhibited by phosphonoacetic acid
(PAA), a known inhibitor of alpha-like DNA polymerases, by decreasing the rate of
elongation. Three highly conserved regions of amino acid homology, found in
several viral alpha-like DNA polymerases and in the luminal diameter 29 DNA
polymerase, one of them proposed to be the PAA binding site, were also found in
the T4 DNA polymerase. This prokaryotic enzyme was highly sensitive to the drugs 
aphidicolin and the nucleotide analogues butylanilino dATP (BuAdATP) and
butylphenyl dGTP (BuPdGTP), known to be specific inhibitors of eukaryotic
alpha-like DNA polymerases. Two potential DNA polymerases from the linear plasmid
pGKL1 from yeast and the S1 mitochondrial DNA from maize have been identified,
based on the fact that they contain the three conserved regions of amino acid
homology. Comparison of DNA polymerases from prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin
showed extensive amino acid homology in addition to highly conserved domains.
These findings reflect evolutionary relationships between hypothetically
unrelated DNA polymerases.
