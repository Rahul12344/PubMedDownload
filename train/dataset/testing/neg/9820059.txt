Cytomegalovirus infections and their sequelae are the most serious complications 
in patients after allogenic bone marrow transplantations. Therefore in recent
years quite rightly attention is paid to new diagnostic methods which make
earlier and more sensitive detection of incipient CMV infection possible. The
method of the two-stage polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for early
detection of CMV infection and its possible further monitoring in 38 recipients
of allogenic bone marrow. A positive result was recorded in 15 (39%) patients
whereby in 10 (13%) repeated positivity was involved. In three in this group of
patients (8%) CMV disease developed, always preceded by PCR positivity.
Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive CMV PCR values were
100, 66, 20 and 100%. Concomitant comparison with serological examination
(antibody titre class IgM/seroconversion) revealed the small contribution of
serology (corresponding values are 67, 54, 11 and 95%) in patients after bone
marrow transplantations. The presented results provide evidence of the
contribution of PCR in the diagnosis of CMV in those patients where due to their 
high sensitivity and excellent predictive value it is possible to avoid the
toxicity of unnecessary antiviral treatment.
