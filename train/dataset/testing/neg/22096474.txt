Small molecule fluorometric boron dipyrromethene probes were developed to bind
hepatitis C virus-encoded NS5A protein and aid subcellular distribution studies. 
These molecules did not co-locate with NS5A, therefore alternative 'silent' azide
reporters were used to obtain a more relevant picture of their distribution.
Following pre-incubation with replicon cells, click chemistry was used to append 
a fluorophore to the azide that confirmed the co-localisation of the small
molecule with the NS5A protein, thus providing greater insight into the antiviral
mode of action of this chemotype.ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL: The online
