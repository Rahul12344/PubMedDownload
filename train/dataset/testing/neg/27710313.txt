West Nile virus (WNV) is an emerging arbovirus, circulating worldwide between
birds and mosquitoes, which impacts human and animal health. Since the mid-1990s,
WNV outbreaks have emerged in Europe and America and represent currently the
primary cause of encephalitis in the United States. WNV exhibits a great genetic 
diversity with at least eight different lineages circulating in the world, and
four (1, 2, Koutango, and putative new) are present in Africa. These different
WNV lineages are not readily differentiated by serology, and thus, rapid
molecular tools are required for diagnostic. We developed here real-time RT-PCR
assays for detection and genotyping of African WNV lineages. The specificity of
the assays was tested using other flaviviruses circulating in Africa. The
sensitivity was determined by testing serial 10-fold dilutions of viruses and RNA
standards. The assays provided good specificity and sensitivity and the
analytical detection limit was 10 copies/reaction. The RT-PCR assays allowed the 
detection and genotyping of all WNV isolates in culture medium, human serum, and 
vertebrate tissues, as well as in field and experimental mosquito samples.
Comparing the ratios of genome copy number/infectious virion (plaque-forming
units), our study finally revealed new insight on the replication of these
different WNV lineages in mosquito cells. Our RT-PCR assays are the first ones
allowing the genotyping of all WNV African variants, and this may have important 
applications in surveillance and epidemiology in Africa and also for monitoring
of their emergence in Europe and other continents.
