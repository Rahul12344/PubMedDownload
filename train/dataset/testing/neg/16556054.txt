Tumor-selective replicating viruses offer appealing advantages over conventional 
cancer therapy. ONYX-015 (dl1520) is the prototype for oncolytic adenoviral
therapy. It has undergone extensive clinical testing with proven safety and
evidence of promising clinical efficacy. The strategy underlying its
tumor-selective cell killing is based on deletion of the viral E1B-55K gene,
which is crucial for efficient viral replication in normal cells but dispensable 
in tumor cells. Originally, the successful replication of ONYX-015 was thought to
strictly depend on deregulated p53 signaling in tumor cells. However, recent
preclinical as well as clinical evidence questions this mechanism. The study by
O'Shea and colleagues is of immense importance as it sheds new light into the
molecular mechanism underlying the tumor-selective replication of ONYX-015. Based
on these findings, modulation of the proposed molecular mechanism by
pharmacologic agents or hyperthermia may largely enhance the therapeutic index of
ONYX-015 for tumor cells versus normal tissue and improve clinical efficacy.
Finally, new strategies to allow successful patient stratification for future
clinical trials appear to be in reach, based on the reported results.
