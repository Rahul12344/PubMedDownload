A blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to detect
antibodies to equine herpesvirus 2 in serum samples of horses. By measuring the
binding to a single epitope, this blocking ELISA gives a good picture of the
antibody status in the animal. The test is based on a monoclonal antibody with
neutralizing activity and had a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 100%.
Antibodies due to newly acquired infection in foals were successfully detected
with this blocking ELISA.
