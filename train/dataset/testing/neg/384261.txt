Perinatal viral carcinogenesis: the role of immunity.

Ioachim HL.

The perinatal period cumulates conditions favorable to carcinogenesis that
comprise high cellular multiplication rates, unstable homeostasis, and immune
incompetence. The placenta allows the passage of various antigens including
oncogenic viruses that have immunogenic or tolerogenic effects on the fetus.
According to the structural type in different species, the placenta also
transfers a diversity of maternal antibodies that protect efficiently the unborn 
progeny. However, in the postnatal period, the infant deprived of maternal
antibodies and still incompetent to produce sufficient levels of immunoglobulins 
is highly susceptible to viral carcinogenesis. In an experimental system, newborn
rats were totally protected against viral leukemogenesis by prenatal immunization
of mothers with either live or inactivated leukemia virus. The routes of transfer
and the comparative efficiency of serum and milk immunoglobulins of different
classes to neutralize the virus were examined. The passage of antibodies under
conditions of maternal immunosuppression was also studied.
