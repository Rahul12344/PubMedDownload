Recently there has been achieved a substantial progress in research concerning
pathogenesis of subacute spongiform viral encephalopathies. For this group of
disorders, there has been found a common unconventional virus - proteinaceous
infectious particle (PrP). There has been recognised a molecular mass,
biochemical composition and physicochemical properties of this infectious form.
Mutations of scrapie amyloid precursor gene discovered in
Gerstmann-Str√§ussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS) and familial cases of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) have been revealed. Nowadays examinations in the 
field of relationships between prion protein and mutations of scrapie precursor
gene are continued.
