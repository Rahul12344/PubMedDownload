PURPOSE: To review the high-resolution computed tomography (CT) findings in
hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) recipients who had proven human
metapneumovirus (HMPV) pneumonia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 5 HCT recipients who had proven HMPV
pneumonia. The patients included 4 men and 1 woman ranging in age from 23 to 58
years (mean age = 42 years). The CT scans were assessed for the presence,
appearance, size, and distribution of parenchymal abnormalities.
RESULTS: Human metapneumovirus was isolated in all 5 patients in this series.
None of these patients had any other infectious organism identified in cultures
or bronchoalveolar lavage. The predominant CT findings were bilateral
abnormalities in all patients, consisting primarily of a mixture of patterns,
including, most commonly, ground-glass attenuation and nodular opacities. Areas
of ground-glass opacification had no zonal predominance and were bilateral,
asymmetric, and patchily distributed. Multiple nodules were identified in 4 (80%)
of 5 patients. Nodules were multiple; less than 5 nodules were identified in 1
case, and 5 to 10 nodules were identified in 3 cases. All nodules in all cases
were less than 10 mm in diameter. Areas of air-space consolidation were
identified in 2 (40%) patients. All patients were available for follow-up;
lesions improved in 4 patients.
CONCLUSION: The thin-section CT manifestations of HMPV pneumonia usually consist 
of a mixture of patterns, including, most commonly, ground-glass attenuation and 
nodular opacities.
