By fusing a human hybridoma producing an IgG2 kappa antibody against human A431
epidermoid carcinoma cells with an Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B
lymphocyte producing an IgG2 kappa antibody against Pseudomonas aeruginosa
exotoxin A, we established a hybrid hybridoma producing a bispecific monoclonal
antibody reacting with both A431 cells and the exotoxin. Human IgG was purified
from the culture supernatant of the hybrid hybridoma, and the bispecific
monoclonal antibody in the IgG preparation was further separated from the two
parental antibodies by hydroxyapatite high-performance liquid chromatography. The
human bispecific monoclonal antibody thus obtained efficiently targeted the
antibody-reactive cells, A431, for attack by the exotoxin in vitro.
