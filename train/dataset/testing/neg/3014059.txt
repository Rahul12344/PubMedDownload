The prevalence of HTLV-III/LAV antibodies was evaluated in 222 Italian
asymptomatic hemophiliacs treated exclusively with commercial factor concentrates
made with American plasma. An increase of HTLV-III/LAV seropositivity from 1983
to 1985 was evident. This was independent of the type of hemophilia (A or B) but 
directly correlated to the amount of concentrate administered in the previous
year. Immunological data (T4 and T8 lymphocyte subsets) were evaluated in
relation to seropositivity to HTLV-III/LAV. The presence of antibodies was found 
to be significantly associated with a low T4/T8 ratio and to a reduced T4
subpopulation, whereas increased levels of T8 lymphocytes correlated weakly with 
seropositivity. Data from 47 hemophiliacs tested both in 1984 and 1985 showed
that 100% of those negative in 1984 and highly transfused in the previous year
seroconverted up to 1985, whereas 33% of those not highly transfused did so.
