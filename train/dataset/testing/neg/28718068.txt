Neuroimaging, in many patients with dengue encephalopathy, may reveal
periventricular signal changes. We report a 25-year-old man, who presented with
altered sensorium. Dengue-IgM test in serum was positive. Cerebrospinal fluid
examination was normal. MRI brain revealed presence of bilateral
parieto-occipital intraparenchymal bleed with mass effect. Neuroimaging was
consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. We report posterior
reversible encephalopathy syndrome in a normotensive patient with dengue
encephalopathy and systemic metabolic alterations.
