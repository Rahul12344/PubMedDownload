The etiology of monoclonal gammopathies remains unclear but familial occurrence
of immunopathies seems to favor a possible hereditary background. In support of
this view we report on a family in which five siblings had a monoclonal
gammopathy. When MGUS was diagnosed in two of them, a family study was carried
out: one sister died from multiple myeloma and four out of the seven living
siblings were discovered to have a MGUS. The immunogenetic study (HLA) showed no 
direct correlation between haplotypes and the presence of the monoclonal protein.
Nevertheless possible environmental exposure to viruses, chemicals and radiation 
was apparently excluded. This new report on familial involvement, the second ever
reported for number of affected subjects, strongly supports the theory of genetic
predisposition in the development of plasma cell dyscrasias.
