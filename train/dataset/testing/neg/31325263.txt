Background: Herpes zoster (HZ) is caused by varicella-zoster virus ( VZV )
reactivation. In the United States, Zoster vaccine (ZOSTAVAX) is indicated for HZ
prevention in patients ≥50 years.
Aims: To evaluate the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of ZOSTAVAX in
healthy Indian subjects, to support its registration in India.
Methods: This open-label, single-arm study was conducted at 10 sites in India.
Healthy Indians (≥50 years) received a single ZOSTAVAX dose. Immunogenicity was
assessed by VZV-specific antibody titer using gpELISA assay. VZV-specific
antibody geometric mean titers (GMT; Day 1 pre-vaccination, Week 6
post-vaccination) and geometric mean fold-rise (GMFR; Week 6 post-vaccination)
were assessed. Safety was evaluated by the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and 
serious adverse events (SAEs) within 42 days of vaccination. Two-sided 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated using t-distribution with natural
log-transformed values.
Results: Of the 250 subjects (mean age, 58.6 years) enrolled and vaccinated, 244 
subjects completed the 6-week follow-up. Overall, subjects in the per-protocol
population had GMT of 149.8 gpELISA units/mL (n=250; 95% CI: 132.6, 169.2) at Day
1 pre-vaccination, and 410.8 gpELISA units/mL (n=243; 95% CI: 373.0, 452.6) at
Week 6 post-vaccination. GMFR of VZV-specific antibody from Day 1 pre-vaccination
to Week 6 post-vaccination was 2.8 (95% CI: 2.5, 3.1). Overall, 67 subjects
(26.8%) experienced AEs, with 48 (19.2%) reporting injection-site AEs and 38
(15.2%) reporting non-injection-site AEs. SAE-abdominal pain and bronchitis-was
reported in one (0.4%) patient each. There was one death, which was unrelated to 
the vaccine.
Limitations: Since ZOSTAVAX introduces a new live attenuated virus, clinical
reactivation of ZOSTAVAX virus and wild-type VZV will need to be differentiated.
Conclusions: In healthy Indians ≥50 years, ZOSTAVAX was well tolerated and
resulted in expected VZV-specific antibody titer levels at 6 weeks
post-vaccination.
