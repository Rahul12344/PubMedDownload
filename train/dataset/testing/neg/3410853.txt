We have converted the TACAAA sequence present at position -29 of the adenovirus
EIIa late promoter into a canonical TATA box by oligonucleotide-directed
mutagenesis. When linear templates were analyzed in nuclear extracts,
transcription of the mutant promoter showed a 10-fold higher level of activity
than that of the wild-type promoter. This increase was correlated with an
increased affinity of the mutant promoter for transcription initiation factor
IID. Further analyses demonstrated that the activating functions of three EIIa
late upstream promoter elements (Huang, D.-H., and Roeder, R.G. (1988) Mol. Cell.
Biol. 8, 1906-1914) were maintained in the mutant promoter background. These
observations indicated, first, that the upstream elements did not act merely to
overcome a rate-limiting initiation step imposed by an inefficient TATA element
and, second, that the strength of the interaction between transcription
initiation factor IID and the TATA box was directly related to promoter activity.
