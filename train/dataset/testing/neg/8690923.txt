A murine heterotopic, nonvascularized cardiac allograft model was used to examine
the effects of the immunosuppressive cytokine, viral IL-10 (vIL-10), delivered by
gene transfer on graft rejection. Retroviral-mediated gene transfer and
expression of vIL-10 significantly prolonged allograft survival, without
conventional systemic immunosuppression, from 12.1 +/- 0.8 days to 39.4 +/- 2.5
days (p < 0.0001). The effect was specific, dose dependent, and restricted to the
site of transplantation. PCR analysis demonstrated specific expression of the
transferred gene within the allograft. Analysis of the cellular infiltrate in the
allografts showed a reduction in T cells and alloantigen-specific cytotoxic T
cells and IL-2 producing helper T cells. Thus, the transient local expression of 
a gene encoding an immunosuppressive protein within a graft can generate local
immunosuppression, making gene therapy a viable approach for facilitating
transplantation.
