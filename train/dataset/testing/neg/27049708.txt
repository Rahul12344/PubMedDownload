Chronic infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the main risk factors for 
the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the
emergence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in non-cirrhotic HCV patients,
especially after sustained virological response (SVR) is an unusual event.
Recently, it has been suggested that HCV genotype 3 may have a particular
oncogenic mechanism, but the factors involved in these cases as well as the
profile of these patients are still not fully understood. Thus, we present the
case of a non-cirrhotic fifty-year-old male with HCV infection, genotype 3a, who 
developed HCC two years after treatment with pegylated-interferon and ribavirin, 
with SVR, in Brazil.
