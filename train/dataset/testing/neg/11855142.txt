OBJECTIVE: Two kinds of murine interleukin-12 (mIL-12) fusion gene vaccines were 
used to treat the murine low-load malignant T cell lymphoma EL4 as minimal
residual disease (MRD) model.
METHODS: C57BL/6 synergistical mice were subcutaneously inoculated with 1 x 10(6)
wild-type (wt) EL4 tumor cells as low-load lymphoma model treated with two mIL-12
gene vaccines. Package cell line PA317/12 producing mIL-12 retrovirus (RV) was
used as in vivo vaccine and EL4 tumor cells transferred with mIL-12 gene as ex
vivo vaccine.
RESULTS: In both mIL-12 gene vaccine-treated groups, there was no tumor growth in
50% mice 60 days after inoculation. Nine of these no tumor growth mice were
re-challenged with 5 x 10(5) wt EL4 cells, and 5 of them survived without tumors 
in another 60 days. All control mice died with tumors within one month after
inoculation. Among those developed tumors in both vaccine-treated groups, the
development of tumors was delayed, the survival period prolonged (P < 0.01), and 
the tumors size at death smaller (P < 0.05) as compared with the controls. In the
long-survived vaccine-treated mice, no residual tumor cells were found by
morphological examination.
CONCLUSION: Both IL-12 gene vaccines can efficiently eliminate wt EL4 MRD in
C57BL/6 mice.
