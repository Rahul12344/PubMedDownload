In the world, there are many tests that allow the detection of HPV infection.
These tests are based on different operating principles and have different levels
of sensitivity. The first test to detect HPV infection was approved by the Food
and Drug Administration in 2003. Since then, the FDA has approved five more
commercial tests for this purpose, the last one in 2018. This paper discusses the
principles of molecular tests to detect HPV, which have been approved by the FDA,
the main differences between them, as well as their advantages and disadvantages.
