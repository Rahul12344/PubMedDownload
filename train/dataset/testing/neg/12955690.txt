Collapsing glomerulopathy (CG), a variant of idiopathic focal segmental
glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), can occur in both human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)-positive and HIV-negative patients. Idiopathic membranous
glomerulonephritis (MGN) has been reported to coexist with FSGS, but rarely with 
CG. We report 3 HIV-negative patients (2 men, 1 woman) who developed nephrotic
syndrome secondary to MGN complicated by CG, with relatively rapid disease
progression despite aggressive therapy.
