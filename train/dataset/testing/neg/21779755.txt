The seven basic patterns of inflammatory dermatoses according to Ackerman can be 
applied to infectious dermatoses. However, it should be borne in mind that
infection caused by one agent may induce differing patterns according to the
stage of disease. Dermatophytosis and the arthropod reaction belong to
perivascular dermatoses with spongiosis. Secondary syphilis and acrodermatitis
chronica atrophicans regularly show a lichenoid infiltrate with interface
dermatitis, whereas epidermal involvement is typically absent in erythema
migrans, virus exanthema and bacillary angiomatosis. Lupus vulgaris, atypic
mycobacteriosis, lepra, actinomycosis, cutaneous leishmaniosis and erysipelas
belong to the nodular and diffuse dermatoses. In the group of vasculitides,
septic vasculitis is induced by a biological agent, and the pattern of vesicular 
dermatitis is reflected by infections with herpes viruses, impetigo contagiosa
and staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome. Follicular dermatitis shows a pattern
of furuncles and carbuncles which are mainly caused by bacteria or fungi.
