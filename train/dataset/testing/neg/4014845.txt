Serologic classification of two ovine adenovirus isolates from the central United
States.

Adair BM, McKillop ER, McFerran JB.

Two ovine adenovirus (OAV) strains (RTS-42 and RTS-151), isolated from lambs in
the central United States, were compared using 2-way cross-neutralization tests
with the 6 recognized OAV species, 9 bovine adenovirus species, and 4 porcine
species. Virus RTS-42 was identified as OAV type 5, confirming previous results. 
Virus RTS-151 was identified as OAV type 6, although the serologic crossing was
largely one-sided.
