Infantile capillary hemangiomas are vascular neoplasms that can appear quite
infiltrative histologically and that are characterized by cords of cells with
areas of marked cellularity. These lesions have been shown to contain a
population of rapidly proliferative endothelial cells. Given the recent
association between the presence of human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) and another
proliferative vascular lesion, Kaposi's sarcoma, we used polymerase chain
reaction technology to examine a series of 16 biopsy specimens from 15 infantile 
capillary hemangiomas for the presence of HHV8 DNA. We were unable to detect HHV8
DNA in any of the lesions studied. All of the cases were examined in parallel
with a case of Kaposi's sarcoma that was known to be positive for HHV8 DNA and a 
series of negative controls. In all of our cases, amplification of beta-globin
gene DNA demonstrated adequate preservation of DNA in the tissue studied. These
findings suggest that not all endothelial cell proliferations can be attributed
to HHV8 and that the etiology of some of these conditions remains unclear.
