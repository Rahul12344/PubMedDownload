We present 42 cases of infectious mononucleosis caused by the Epstein-Barr virus 
in children. Patients were divided into two groups: those less than 4 years old
and those 4 to 16 years of age. Splenomegaly was more frequent in young patients.
Treatment with amoxicillin was associated with cutaneous rash. Heterophil
antibodies were more frequent in patients older than four years of age. In 93% of
the cases anticapside antibodies of IgM class were present. Complications were
rarely encountered. Pneumonia and haemolytic anemia were present. We believe that
anticapside antibodies of the IgM class should always be determined in patient
younger than four years of age. If heterophil antibodies (Paul-Bunnell) and IgM
are negative, we recommend that other specific serology related to the
Epstein-Barr virus be determined in any age group.
