The nucleotide sequence of a 2.2 kb genome region of the baculovirus
Cryptophlebia leucotreta granulosis virus (CIGV) encompassing the granulin gene
and a second open reading frame, designated ORF909, was determined. The putative 
granulin ORF comprises 744 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide with a predicted
M(r) of 29.3 K. The 5' leader of the granulin gene contains a canonical late
baculovirus promoter (ATAAG) and differs only in two nucleotide positions from
the sequence of Cydia pomonella granulosis virus (CpGV). Sequence comparison with
the granulin genes of different granulosis viruses indicated a very close
relationship between CIGV and CpGV of about 96% amino acid identity. ORF909 is
909 nucleotides in length and encodes a potential protein of M(r) 36.2K. It
contains two zinc finger-like motifs, similar to ME53, which was previously
described for Autographa californica multiple nucleocapsid nuclear polyhedrosis
virus. ORF909 protein is significantly shorter than ME53 protein, lacking more
than 105 amino acids of the amino terminus of ME53. Both genes contain an early
and a late promoter motif suggesting a similar temporal regulation. Homologous
sequences to ORF909 are also present upstream of the granulin genes of other
granulosis viruses (GVs) indicating that this ORF is common in GVs.
