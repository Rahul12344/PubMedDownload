Inactivation of the hemagglutinins of type A influenza viruses by physical and
chemical means: an aid to classification.

Cleeland R, Grunberg E, Prince HN.

The effects of temperature and treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate, Tween 20,
dithiothreitol, trypsin, or guanidine on the hemagglutinating capacity of six
strains of type A influenza virus (A(0)/PR8/34, A(1)/CAME/46, A(2)/J305/57,
A(2)/Bethesda/63, A(2)/HK/Aichi/68, and A(2)/HK/80/68), one strain of swine virus
(A/Swine/76/?), and one equine strain (A/Equi-2/63) were determined. The two Hong
Kong strains could be readily distinguished from the earlier A(2) strains by the 
resistance of their hemagglutinins to trypsin treatment and their inability to
recover hemagglutinating capacity after removal of dithiothreitol from treated
virus preparations. In these respects, the equine strain most closely resembled
the Hong Kong variants. The pattern of hemagglutination inactivation also set the
swine, PR8, and CAME strains apart from each other as well as from the other five
strains. The results suggest that separation of type A viruses into groups by the
pattern of inactivation of their hemagglutinins may be a valuable adjunct to
standard serology for a more definite classification of these viruses.
