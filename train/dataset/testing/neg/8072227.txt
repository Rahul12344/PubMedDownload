We report a case of sporadic acute type A hepatitis associated with acute renal
failure, due to mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis and interstitial
nephritis. A 42 year-old-man was admitted to Mitsui Memorial Hospital because of 
jaundice and oliguria with fever in February, 1989. His serum creatinine was 12.2
mg/dl, BUN 87 mg/dl, GOT 57 U/l and GPT 358 U/l. The serum IgM antibody to
hepatitis A virus was positive, which indicated recent infection with hepatitis A
virus. Hemodialysis and steroidal therapy were started, and the patient's acute
renal failure and liver dysfunction ameliorated within one month. Light
microscopic examinations showed an increased number of mesangial cells and an
increased amount of mesangial matrix, and also showed inflammatory cell invasion 
in the interstitium. Electron microscopic examinations showed proliferation of
mesangial cells and matrix, and a dense deposit along the basement membrane. On
immunofluoresent studies, fine granular deposits of IgA and Clq were observed in 
the mesangium.
