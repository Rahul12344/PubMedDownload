Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) mediates protection against infections by using the 
complement system, but certain microorganisms may increase infectivity by
exploiting this host defense system. Thus, it has been speculated whether
genetically determined low MBL levels may confer partial protection against
certain intracellular microorganisms, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We
investigated MBL alleles in 109 culture-positive human immunodeficiency
virus-uninfected patients with tuberculosis living in Denmark and 250 white
control subjects. Patients and control subjects were divided into 3 different
groups defined by undetectable, low, and high serum MBL concentrations, which
correlates to deficient, low, and high expressing MBL genotypes. A significantly 
decreased frequency of patients with the low-expressing MBL genotype was observed
in white patients compared to control subjects. The same tendency also was
observed in patients of other ethnic origin. It may be hypothesized that
heterozygosity for MBL variant alleles, which encodes low serum MBL levels, is
associated with protection against clinical tuberculosis.
