Rubella virus (RV), one of pathogens in TORCH syndrome, can lead to anisotropy of
the fetus, and therefore it is of great significance to screen RV infection among
women at child-bearing age. At the present, the screening of RV infection is
mainly based on the ELISA method, the specificity of RV antigens is very
important for ELISA tests. The antigenicity of RV is closely associated with its 
structural proteins, including capsid protein C, and envelope glycoproteins E1
and E2, which are important surface antigens of RV. This paper reviews the
advances in the studies on the structure features, immunogenicity and recombinant
proteins of the three structural proteins.
