Varicella zoster virus (VZV)-specific IgG and IgA antibody titers were determined
in serial serum samples of 23 patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome by the
immunoperoxidase assay. Varicella zoster virus-specific IgG antibodies were found
in the first serum samples of all the patients. In 80% of 20 patients in whom a
serum sample was available within 5 days after the onset of the disease.
VZV-specific IgA antibodies were detected. The second serum sample was
VZV-specific IgA-positive in all of the patients. While all the healthy age- and 
sex-matched control subjects had VZV-specific IgG antibodies, VZV-specific IgA
antibodies were detected in a low titer (dilution = 2) in only three of the
subjects. By using VZV-specific IgA antibody titers greater than or equal to 2
and greater than or equal to 4 by the immunoperoxidase assay as a "cutoff" for
younger and older patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, respectively, an early
diagnosis of the disease can be obtained in 89% of the younger and in 64% of the 
older patients by a single serum sample.
