The paper presents changes in the picture of CMV disease (CMV-D) in the era of
combination antiretroviral treatment. A significant reduction in the incidence of
CMV-D and deaths due to CMV-D as well as the increase of survival after the
diagnosis of CMV-D was observed. Although, CMV infection remains the problem
among HIV infected persons. Clinical presentation of CMV end-organ disease and
immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome were presented. Methods of diagnosis 
and recommended forms of therapies were described. The risk of HIV-disease
progression and death in CMV-viremic patients and the data on efficacy and safety
of preemptive therapy were discussed.
