A small DNA virus, named JC virus (JCV) and belonging to the Polyomaviridae, is
attracting the attention of anthropologists worldwide, as JCV genotyping appears 
to be a novel means of elucidating human migrations and the origins of various
ethnic groups. The basic properties of JCV, the regional distributions of JCV
genotypes, and the phylogenetic relationships among various JCV genotypes are
described. Then, a study is described in which the origin of the modern Japanese 
was extensively investigated using the JCV genotyping method. Based on JCV
genotypes in neighboring areas, the origins of people who carried JCV genotypes
to the Japanese Archipelago are discussed. Finally, the relationships between JCV
genotypes and Y-chromosome haplogroups are examined, as genetic variation on the 
Y chromosome has recently been examined in detail to investigate ancient human
migrations and the population structures of human groups.
