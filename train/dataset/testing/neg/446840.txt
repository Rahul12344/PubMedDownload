Type C RNA virus proteins: lack of binding specificity to host cell chromosomal
DNA in vitro.

Miles K, Schwartz SA.

Through the use of two different DNA-protein reconstitution methods, we examined 
the potential role of type C RNA tumor virus proteins as putative regulatory
agents in the control of virus expression. Rauscher murine leukemia virus,
purified from chronically infected rat cell cultures, was iodinated in vitro with
[125I], and dissociated in a nondetergent high-ionic-strength urea-containing
buffer. The chemically separated [125I]-labeled viral polypetides were
reconstituted with purified DNA by affinity column chromatography and by gradient
dialysis renaturation. In both instances, no detectable amount of radioactivity
specifically bound to double-stranded DNA of any origin. This observation was in 
contrast to the binding behavior of identically prepared and radiolabeled,
nonhistone chromosomal proteins purified from rat cell nuclei. This finding may
rule out, in eukaryotic cells, a well-described prokarytoic regulatory mechanism 
for the control of integrated viral gene expression.
