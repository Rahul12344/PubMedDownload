Influenza immunostimulating complexes (flu-ISCOMs) and a monovalent subvirion
vaccine prepared with an H1N1 strain of influenza virus were compared in mice for
immunogenicity and protection against challenge with homologous and heterotypic
influenza viruses. flu-ISCOMs but not subvirion vaccine fully protected mice
against homologous virus challenge after one immunization as assessed by
measurement of virus lung titers. The improved protection induced by flu-ISCOMs
was associated with a 10-fold higher prechallenge serum hemagglutination
inhibition titer. Furthermore, only flu-ISCOMs fully protected mice against
mortality and reduced morbidity following challenge with an influenza virus of
the serologically distinct H2N2 subtype. This cross-protection correlated with
the induction of virus cross-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes that recognized a
known major histocompatibility class I (H2-Kd)-restricted epitope within the
hemagglutinin of influenza virus that is conserved among the H1 and H2 influenza 
virus subtypes. flu-ISCOMs may offer significant advantages over current
commercial formulations as an improved influenza vaccine.
