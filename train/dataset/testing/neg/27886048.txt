The human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) unspliced transcript is used both
as mRNA for the synthesis of structural proteins and as the packaged genome.
Given the presence of retained introns and instability AU-rich sequences, this
viral transcript is normally retained and degraded in the nucleus of host cells
unless the viral protein REV is present. As such, the stability of the HIV-1
unspliced mRNA must be particularly controlled in the nucleus and the cytoplasm
in order to ensure proper levels of this viral mRNA for translation and viral
particle formation. During its journey, the HIV-1 unspliced mRNA assembles into
highly specific messenger ribonucleoproteins (mRNPs) containing many different
host proteins, amongst which are well-known regulators of cytoplasmic mRNA decay 
pathways such as up-frameshift suppressor 1 homolog (UPF1), Staufen
double-stranded RNA binding protein 1/2 (STAU1/2), or components of miRNA-induced
silencing complex (miRISC) and processing bodies (PBs). More recently, the HIV-1 
unspliced mRNA was shown to contain N⁶-methyladenosine (m⁶A), allowing the
recruitment of YTH N⁶-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2 (YTHDF2), an m⁶A
reader host protein involved in mRNA decay. Interestingly, these host proteins
involved in mRNA decay were shown to play positive roles in viral gene expression
and viral particle assembly, suggesting that HIV-1 interacts with mRNA decay
components to successfully accomplish viral replication. This review summarizes
the state of the art in terms of the interactions between HIV-1 unspliced mRNA
and components of different host mRNA decay machineries.
