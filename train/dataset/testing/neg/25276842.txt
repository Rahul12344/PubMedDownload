Herpes simplex keratitis (HSK) belongs to the major causes of visual morbidity
worldwide and available methods of treatment remain unsatisfactory. Primary
infection occurs usually early in life and is often asymptomatic. Chronic visual 
impairment and visual loss are caused by corneal scaring, thinning, and
vascularization connected with recurrent HSV infections. The pathogenesis of
herpetic keratitis is complex and is still not fully understood. According to the
current knowledge, corneal scarring and vascularization are the result of chronic
inflammatory reaction against HSV antigens. In this review we discuss the role of
innate and adaptive immunities in acute and recurrent HSV ocular infection and
present the potential future targets for novel therapeutical options based on
immune interventions.
