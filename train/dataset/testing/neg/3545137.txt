Diffuse dysplasia of cerebral hemispheres in a fetus. Possible viral cause?

Galloway PG, Roessmann U.

The pathologic anatomy of an infant born with an occluded ventricular system and 
cerebral dysplasia is described. The possible role of an intrauterine viral
infection as the cause is discussed, as is the possible relationship of this
lesion to cerebro-ocular dysgenesis (Warburg syndrome).
