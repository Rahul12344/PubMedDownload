Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) are at increased risk for
complications of liver disease if they become infected with the hepatitis A (HAV)
or hepatitis B (HBV) viruses. The authors examined the rates of testing for HAV, 
HBV, and HCV, as well as rates of vaccination against HAV and HBV in patients
with chronic HCV in a random sample (N = 207) of medical records of patients
enrolled in a methadone maintenance program. Almost all patients reviewed were
tested for HAV, HBV, and HCV. Of the 111 patients with chronic HCV, 53 (48.6%)
and 68 (63%) lacked immunity to HAV and HBV, respectively. Of those lacking
immunity, 29 (54.7%) and 2 (2.9%) were vaccinated for HAV and HBV, respectively. 
Despite high rates of testing for HAV, HBV, and HCV at a methadone maintenance
program, approximately half of those with chronic HCV eligible for the HAV
vaccine received it, and few of those eligible for HBV vaccine received it.
