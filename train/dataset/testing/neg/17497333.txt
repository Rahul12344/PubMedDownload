The rapid expansion of West Nile virus (WNV) throughout the New World has raised 
interest in understanding the population dynamics and patterns of dispersal of
emerging infectious diseases by wildlife. WNV affects humans, although its main
reservoirs are various species of birds. Here we analyse the prevalence of
WNV-neutralizing antibodies in nearly full-grown chicks belonging to seven
different species of colonial waterbirds at three localities in southern Spain.
Chicks with neutralizing antibodies against WNV were detected in three species
and at all three localities. However, the low antibody titres suggest the
presence of antibodies is probably due to maternal transfer of antibody,
presumably from exposure of the adult birds to WNV or a similar flavivirus at
some stage of their lives. The analyses of the movements of tagged birds
confirmed that all species with antibody visit regions that have had reports of
WNV infection over the past decade.
