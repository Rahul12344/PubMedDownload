The persistent inertia in the ability to culture environmentally abundant
microbes from aquatic ecosystems represents an obstacle in disentangling the
complex web of ecological interactions spun by a diverse assortment of
participants (pro- and eukaryotes and their viruses). In aquatic microbial
communities, the numerically most abundant actors, the viruses, remain the most
elusive, and especially in freshwaters their identities and ecology remain
unknown. Here, using ultra-deep metagenomic sequencing from pelagic freshwater
habitats, we recovered complete genomes of > 2000 phages, including small
"miniphages" and large "megaphages" infecting iconic freshwater prokaryotic
lineages. For instance, abundant freshwater Actinobacteria support infection by a
very broad size range of phages (13-200 Kb). We describe many phages encoding
genes that likely afford protection to their host from reactive oxygen species
(ROS) in the aquatic environment and in the oxidative burst in protist
phagolysosomes (phage-mediated ROS defense). Spatiotemporal abundance analyses of
phage genomes revealed evanescence as the primary dynamic in upper water layers, 
where they displayed short-lived existences. In contrast, persistence was
characteristic for the deeper layers where many identical phage genomes were
recovered repeatedly. Phage and host abundances corresponded closely, with
distinct populations displaying preferential distributions in different seasons
and depths, closely mimicking overall stratification and mixis.
