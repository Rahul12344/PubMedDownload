Isolation of a cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus by physical and immunological
techniques.

Rubinstein R, Stannard L, Polson A.

Procedures are described for the separation and purification of cytoplasmic
polyhedrosis viruses obtained from multiply infected Heliothis armigera larvae.
Separation was achieved by differential centrifugation and density gradient zone 
electrophoresis followed by complexing with nuclear polyhedrosis virus specific
antibody. The yield of cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus was increased by passage in
larvae reared on synthetic media.
