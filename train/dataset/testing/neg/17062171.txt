The official view is that India's epidemics are driven, directly and indirectly, 
by heterosexual prostitution. Review of available evidence by researchers in
India undermines this weakly supported orthodoxy and suggests that correcting
weaknesses in its AIDS surveillance system can lead to a more reliable picture of
HIV propagation and hence to evidence-based interventions. Contenders for leading
roles in HIV transmission are under-suspected and unmeasured skin-puncturing
exposures.
