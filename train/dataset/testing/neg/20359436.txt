To determine the association between Human papillomavirus (HPV)-type infections
with the frequency of Micronucleus (MN), a hospital-based, unmatched case-control
study was carried out. We evaluated and compared the average number of MN/1,000
cells among three groups of Mexican females. Twenty one women ranging in age from
31-56 years and divided into three groups were studied. Group I comprised seven
control women without cervical lesions and with HPV-negative, Group II was
composed of seven women with Squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) infected with
low-risk HPV low-risk, and Group III was made up of seven women with SIL infected
with high-risk HPV infection. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test revealed
differences among Groups I (5.14+/-3.02), II (13.43+/-3.41), and III
(25.43+/-3.41) (F=67.46; P=0.0001). We demonstrated an association between HPV
type infection and higher MN frequencies. However, a larger controlled study with
sufficient follow-up will be required to further evaluate the usefulness of this 
test in the clinical management of women with HPV infection.
