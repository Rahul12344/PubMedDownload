Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation (DNAm) have a central role in the
regulation of gene expression and thereby in cellular differentiation and tissue 
homeostasis. It has recently been shown that aging is associated with profound
changes in DNAm. Several of these methylation changes take place in a clock-like 
fashion, i.e. correlating with the calendar age of an individual. Thus, the
epigenetic clock based on these kind of DNAm changes could provide a new
biomarker for human aging process, i.e. being able to separate the calendar and
biological age. Information about the correlation of the time indicated by this
clock to the various aspects of immunosenescence is still missing. As chronic
cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is probably one of the major driving forces of
immunosenescence, we now have analyzed the correlation of CMV seropositivity with
the epigenetic age in the Vitality 90+cohort 1920 (122 nonagenarians and 21 young
controls, CMV seropositivity rates 95% and 57%, respectively). The data showed
that CMV seropositivity was associated with a higher epigenetic age in both of
these age groups (median 26.5 vs. 24.0 (p < 0.02,Mann–Whitney U-test) in the
young controls and 76.0 vs. 70.0 (p < 0.01) in the nonagenarians). Thus, these
data provide a new aspect to the CMV associated pathological processes.
