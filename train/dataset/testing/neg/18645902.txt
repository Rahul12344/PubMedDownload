The nucleotide sequence of the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein
gene of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) variant strain V4(UPM) was determined by
direct genomic RNA sequencing and confirmed by cycle sequencing. The gene
comprises 1996 nucleotides encoding a 615 amino acid protein of size 67.4 kDa.
The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of this strain were compared with those
of the parent strain V4(QUE). There are 16 nucleotide substitutions on V4(UPM),
eight of which are silent mutations and another eliminated a potential Asn-linked
glycosylation site in V4(UPM). In addition, an Arg (403) residue was shown to be 
absent in the variant strain. This deletion is thought to be significant because 
of its location in a highly conserved region of the HN protein.
