Retroviruses in human tumors.

Kurth R, Löwer J, Löwer R, Boller K, Frank H.

Retroviruses received widespread attention in the past not only because they
caused tumors in animals and, perhaps, in man, but also because they served as
useful tools to elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in the control of
eukaryotic gene expression. In this brief overview, evidences are presented that 
retrovirus-like particles can regularly be demonstrated in human teratocarcinomas
cultured in vitro. These viruses are morphologically reminiscent of animal
retrovirus strains but show also unique structural features. The viruses possess 
endogenous reverse transcriptase activity and can be banded at 1.16 g/ml in
sucrose gradients, a density characteristic of retroviruses. They can clearly be 
distinguished from animal retrovirus strains on immunological grounds. We will
also briefly summarize the data accumulating for the human T-cell lymphoma
viruses (HTLV) which were recently discovered first by Gallo et al. and
independently by Hinuma and Miyoshi. HTLV seem to play an etiological role in the
establishment of human adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and thus represent the
first pathogenic human retroviruses.
