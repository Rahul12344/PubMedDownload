OBJECTIVE: To review the current literature on the hepatitis G virus (HGV)
infection, with particular attention to the aspects of interest for the dental
staff.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The authors searched for original research and review
articles on specific aspects of the HGV infection including virology,
epidemiology, transmission, natural history, and dental zaspects of HGV
infection. The relevant articles were evaluated and reviewed.
RESULTS: HGV is a parenterally transmitted RNA virus that may cause acute,
chronic, and fulminant liver disease; however, the real pathogenic potential of
this virus and its possible effect on other hepatitic infections is still to be
clarified. Preliminary studies have failed to demonstrate strong relationships
between HGV infection and any oral disease. At present, data on the prevalence of
HGV infection among health care workers are scarce. Nevertheless, in view of the 
potential transmission rates of HGV and the lack of effective immunization, HGV
should be regarded as a potential occupational hazard for medical and dental
staff.
CONCLUSION: Many virological, medical, and oral aspects of HGV infection need to 
be further investigated; nevertheless, until related data are available, HGV
should be considered to be an infection that may be transmitted during dental
care.
