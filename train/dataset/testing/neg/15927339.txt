Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects human target cells mainly through gp350/220-CD21
and gp42-MHCII interactions; however, it has been shown that these interactions
are dispensable for EBV-invasion of susceptible cells, suggesting that other
viral proteins are involved in this process. It is probable that tegument
BNRF1/p140 protein is involved in EBV-invasion of target cells, since anti-p140
antibodies inhibit EBV-infection of B-lymphocytes and there is evidence that part
of the protein is located on virus surface. Sixty-six peptides, covering the
entire BNRF1/p140 sequence, were synthesised and tested in lymphoblastoid cell
line binding assays. Peptides 11465 and 11521 bound with high affinity to Raji,
Ramos and P3HR-1 cells but not to erythrocytes, showing cell-binding behaviour
similar to EBV. These two peptides induced antibodies recognising live
EBV-infected cells. Interestingly, peptide-11521 (YVLQNAHQIACHFHSNGTDA) or
antibodies induced by this peptide inhibited EBV-binding to B-lymphocytes,
suggesting that this p140-region could be involved in EBV and B-lymphocyte
interaction.
