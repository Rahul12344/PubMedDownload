Interleukin-24 (IL-24) is a cytokine encoded by a tumor suppressor gene of the
IL-10 family, also known as the melanoma differentiation associated gene-7
(Mda-7) and first discovered in human melanoma cells. Mda-7/IL-24 has been shown 
to inhibit the proliferation of various human tumor cell lines, but its effect on
the sensitivity of B cell lymphoma to chemotherapy agents is not yet clear. The
present study investigated the effects of Mda-7/IL-24 overexpression on the
sensitivity of human B cell lymphoma cells to chemotherapy, as well as its
mechanism of action. The sensitivity of stable Mda-7/IL-24 overexpressing Raji
and Daudi cells to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (CDDP), epirubicin and
vinblastine (VCR) were assessed by the MTS method, and the IC50 value calculated.
Cell apoptosis and the intracellular accumulation of Rhodamine-123 were assayed
by flow cytometry. The expression of multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1),
B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (BMI1),
topoisomerase II (Topo II) and multidrug resistance-related protein 1 (MRP1) mRNA
and protein were analyzed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting, respectively. In addition, western blot 
analysis was also used to investigate the effect of Mda-7/IL-24 on activity of
GTP-RhoA-ERK signaling pathway in Raji and Daudi cells. Growth inhibition and
apoptosis rates of Mda-7/IL-24 overexpressing Raji and Daudi cells were higher
than those of non-transfected cells and cells transfected with vector alone when 
treated with CDDP, epirubicin and VCR. The IC50 values of CDDP, epirubicin and
VCR were lower for Mda-7/IL-24-overexpressing Raji and Daudi cells than for
non-transfected cells and cells transfected with empty vector. Intracellular
accumulation of Rhodamine-123 and the expression of Topo II were higher, while
the levels of MDR1, BMI and MRP1 mRNA and protein were lower, in Mda-7/IL-24
overexpressing Raji and Daudi cells. Furthermore, the activities of GTP-RhoA-ERK 
signaling pathway in Raji and Daudi cells were suppressed. These results
indicated that Mda-7/IL-24 enhanced the sensitivity of B lymphoma cells to
chemotherapy agents by altering the expression of multidrug-resistance genes via 
downregulating GTP-RhoA-ERK signaling pathway, suggesting that treatment of B
cell lymphomas with Mda-7/IL-24 could avoid MDR.
