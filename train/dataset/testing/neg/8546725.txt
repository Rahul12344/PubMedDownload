OBJECTIVE: To report the antiinflammatory and antiviral effects of
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) treatment in 2 patients with AIDS and inflammatory
arthritis.
METHODS: Two patients with AIDS and inflammatory arthritis were treated with HCQ,
which was given in a loading dose of 600 mg/day. The maintenance dosage was
calculated to remain below 6.5 mg/kg/day. Both patients had initial T cell subset
studies; 1 patient, had serum and plasma collected before and after 1 year of HCQ
treatment. Assays were performed for T cell subsets, recoverable human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA, mitogen- and antigen-specific
proliferation, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels. New studies on the use of HCQ as 
an anti-HIV-1 agent are reviewed.
RESULTS: Both patients had a dramatic decrease in their arthritis activity.
Neither patient required immunosuppressive therapy or developed an opportunistic 
infection. In the patient who was studied after 1 year of therapy, there was a
1-log decrease in recoverable HIV-1 RNA, improved mitogen- and antigen-specific
immune responses, and a large decrease in the IL-6 level while taking HCQ. Recent
in vitro and in vivo assays in patients with HIV infection have shown similar
antiviral and antiinflammatory effects from HCQ.
CONCLUSION: HCQ may exert simultaneous anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects in
patients with HIV infection and inflammatory arthritis. If larger studies confirm
this observation, it may be the drug of choice in this population of patients.
