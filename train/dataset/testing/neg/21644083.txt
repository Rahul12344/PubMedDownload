West Nile virus (WNV) infections may trigger febrile conditions and/or
neuroinvasive disease in a portion of the exposed individuals. Serosurveillance
data from various regions of Turkey indicate WNV activity. The aim of this study 
was to confirm the antibody specificity of the serum samples via virus
neutralization assay, previously reported to be reactive for WNV IgM. The samples
originated from two individuals with the preliminary diagnosis of aseptic
meningitis/encephalitis of unknown etiology in 2009 and had been classified as
probable WNV infections. Cerebrospinal fluid and sera samples of these patients
had been evaluated as negative for WNV RNA and IgG antibodies. Only one serum
sample could be included in the neutralization assay due to the limited amounts
in the current investigation. The sample was observed as positive in dilutions of
1/20 and 1/40, thus confirming the diagnosis of WNV-related central nervous
system infection in a 62 year-old female patient from Ankara, Central Anatolia,
Turkey.
