Rotavirus nonstructural protein NSP4 has recently been suggested to function as a
viral enterotoxin and play a role in the pathophysiological mechanism whereby
rotaviruses induce diarrhea. The ability of rotavirus NSP4 to stimulate a humoral
immune response was examined in naturally infected children and adults, rotavirus
vaccinated children, as well as a cellular immune response in adults. In this
study, 10 of 10 naturally infected children and 9 of 10 rotavirus-vaccinated
children showed a weak humoral IgG immune response to recombinant NSP4 (rNSP4)
and/or a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 114-134 of NSP4. Modest
serum IgG antibody responses were detected in 20 of 20 adults. A cellular immune 
response to rNSP4 and/or NSP4(114-134) were detected in 8 of 10 adults measured
either as a T-cell proliferative response (7 of 10), an increased production of
IL-2 (6 of 10), or increased production of interferon-gamma (8 of 10). These
results indicate that NSP4 induces a humoral immune response in humans and show
for the first time that NSP4 stimulates a cellular immune response, possibly
including cytolytic T-cells.
