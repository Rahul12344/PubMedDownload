The influence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes on the natural history and the
response to treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B are of potential
interest. Compared to the patients with HBV genotype C, those with genotype B
were of a younger age and had a higher cumulative rate of hepatitis B e antigen
(HBeAg) seroconversion during the initial 6 years of follow-up. The earlier HBeAg
seroconversion in the patients with genotype B, however, did not provide them
with a benefit in terms of a reduced risk of developing long-term complications. 
The response to lamivudine therapy was evaluated in 21 patients infected with HBV
genotype B (all of subtype Ba) and 61 with genotype C. There were no differences 
in the virological response to lamivudine therapy, based on the reduction in
median logarithmic HBV DNA titer as well as alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
levels, normalization of ALT and the rate of HBeAg seroconversion between the
patients with genotypes B and C. No differences were noted either, in the
frequency of YMDD mutants at week 52 or the cumulative risk of HBV DNA
breakthroughs with YMDD mutations during long-term lamivudine therapy (median
37.5 months). In conclusion, there is no influence of HBV genotypes on the
development of long-term complications and lamivudine therapy in Hong Kong.
