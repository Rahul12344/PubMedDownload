Lipodystrophy: Glaxo researchers suggest mechanisms, publish data.

James JS.

AIDS: Two posters on research into the possible mechanisms for lipid
abnormalities were presented at the Retroviruses conference. These abnormalities 
appear to be associated with protease inhibitor use in some patients. The
research is based on lipid biochemistry, but since many at the conference were
unfamiliar with the concept, the posters were poorly received. The difficulty in 
researching the problem is that pharmaceutical companies are not inclined to
highlight problems associated with their drugs. Amprenavir (Agenerase), from
Glaxo Wellcome, has been associated with almost no lipid abnormalities among the 
1,500 patients in its expanded-access program, but no long-term studies have been
completed on this issue. No one is certain what causes the lipodystrophy, but the
fundamental problem is a loss of subcutaneous fat, which results in abnormal fat 
deposits in the body. Two potential mechanisms for avoiding this problem are
preventing the development of fat cells and increasing retinoid toxicity. Both
theories are described.
