Many properties of HSV-1 are especially suitable for using this virus as a vector
to treat diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS), such as Parkinson's
disease or malignant gliomas. These advantageous properties include natural
neurotropism, high transduction efficiency, large transgene capacity, and the
ability of entering a latent state in neurons. Selective oncolysis in combination
with modulation of the immune response mediated by replication-conditional HSV-1 
vectors appears to be a highly promising approach in the battle against malignant
glioma. Helper virus-free HSV/AAV hybrid amplicon vectors have great promise in
mediating long-term gene expression in the PNS and CNS for the treatment of
various neurodegenerative disorders or chronic pain. Current research focuses on 
the design of HSV-1-derived vectors which are targeted to certain cell types and 
support transcriptionally regulatable transgene expression. Here, we review the
recent developments on HSV-1-based vector systems and their applications in
experimental and clinical gene therapy protocols.
