BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Tenofovir (TDF)-associated renal dysfunction has been
described in various studies of human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients.
Our goal is to examine the incidence and magnitude of decrease in renal function 
in chronic hepatitis B patients treated with TDF.
METHODS: We performed a case-cohort study of 103 patients on TDF 300 mg and 103
patients unexposed to TDF (Entecavir) at 4 centers, who were matched for age±10
years, sex, and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) group.
Calculation and evaluation of eGFR were performed with both the Cockcroft-Gault
formula and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula.
RESULTS: The exposed and unexposed populations were well matched with a similar
mean age (44±10 y), proportion of male patients (63.1%), and baseline eGFR groups
(86.4% unimpaired). There was no significant difference in the proportion of
patients reclassified to a more severe renal classification (RMSRC) or in the
proportion of patients with decrease in eGFR of ≥20% in those exposed to TDF
versus control. The incidence density for RMSRC was 7.4 cases per 100
patient-years in the exposed group compared with 11.5 cases per 100 patient-years
in the unexposed group (95% CI, 0.31-1.34). The relative risk of exposed to
unexposed was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.31-1.34). On Cox proportional hazard analysis
following adjustment for sex, age, baseline diagnosis hypertension, diabetes,
impaired baseline renal function, and cirrhosis, TDF was not a predictor for
RMSRC or decrease in eGFR≥20%.
CONCLUSIONS: TDF treatment was not an independent predictor for significant
deterioration of renal function. Renal function of chronic hepatitis B patients
on antiviral therapy should be monitored, especially in those who are older
and/or with mildly impaired renal function.
