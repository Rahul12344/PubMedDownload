Transformation of mouse peritoneal macrophages and bone marrow cells by simian
virus 40.

Takayama H.

A fraction of cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages and bone marrow cells
acquired the ability to divide after infection by simian virus 40 (SV40). Two
types of transformed lines were obtained. Most transformants isolated 400-60 days
after infection did not display macrophage specific properties such as ingestion 
of opsonized red blood cells, possession of Fc receptors and complement
receptors, and acid phosphatase activity throughout the whole culture phase.
Cells of the transformed lines isolated by trypsin selection 2--6 months after
infection displayed these properties when the cell density became high and cell
growth was arrested. In the cells of the latter type of transformed lines, SV40
T-antigen was intensely demonstrated by immunofluorescence in the growing phase, 
but weakly or not at all in the stationary phase. It is suggested that the
reversion to the phenotype of the progenitor (expression of macrophage specific
functions) depends on the physiological state of the culture; however, it is
uncertain whether the development of the macrophage functions is directly related
to the SV40 T-antigen.
