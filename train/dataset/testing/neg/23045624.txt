BACKGROUND: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is associated with ischemic heart disease (IHD)
among organ transplant recipients. The relationship between the levels of
antibody for CMV with IHD in immunocompetent individuals is uncertain.
METHODS: We measured baseline CMV immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in 12,574
participants without IHD from the population-based EPIC-Norfolk cohort, aged
40-70 years old at recruitment in 1993-1997. Underlying causes of death or
hospitalization until 31 March 2008 were abstracted from death certificates and a
database of hospital admissions, respectively.
RESULTS: Of the participants, 58% were seropositive for CMV. After a mean
follow-up of 12 years (standard deviation, 2.2 years), 1356 first-time IHD events
occurred. After adjustment for classic IHD risk factors, belonging to the highest
antibody group was associated with an increased risk of incident IHD, compared
with seronegativity (hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.42).
After additional adjustment for measures of social class, inflammation, and
possible confounders, this association was unchanged (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95%
confidence interval, 1.04-11.41).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first population study to show that CMV IgG antibody
levels are related to incident IHD compared to seronegativity. Studies
correlating CMV antibody levels with direct measurements of active infection will
be necessary.
