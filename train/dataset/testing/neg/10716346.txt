As tools to examine template switches and recombination events during the process
of reverse transcription, two nearly identical Moloney murine leukemia
virus-based (MoMLV) retroviral vectors were constructed using the technique of
recombinatory polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The experimental vectors designed 
for this study were based on the well-characterized LN series vectors. The
protein coding regions normally present in the retroviral genome have been
replaced by the coding regions for two drug resistance markers, neomycin
phosphotransferase (Neo) and hygromycin phosphotransferase (Hyg). With only one
functional drug resistance gene in each vector, the individual vectors as well as
recombination events between them can be followed by phenotypic selection.
Utilization of recombinatory PCR allowed the insertion of very subtle nucleotide 
changes resulting in a series of restriction site polymorphisms in the two
retroviral vectors. The ability to create these subtle mutations in specific
locations of these retroviral vectors allowed the utilization of naturally
occurring areas of variability in the vectors and avoid regions important for
replication.
