OBJECTIVE: To characterize the risk of liver-related events and death in
hepatitis B virus (HBV)-exposed liver transplantation (LT) recipients.
METHODS: Retrospective review was performed in all adults who underwent LT
between January 1995 through December 2010 at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.
Recipients with graft failure or death within 14 d of LT or missing HBV status
were excluded, leaving 575 individuals for analysis. Patients were classified
according to HBV exposure status: Unexposed, Resolved HBV, Chronic HBV, or
hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) seropositive liver donor.
RESULTS: Compared with HBV-unexposed patients, the relative hazard of combined
liver-related events (rejection, cirrhosis, re-transplantation) and death after
LT was not increased in patients with a baseline history of resolved HBV
infection or chronic hepatitis B. Using anti-HBc seropositive donors also did not
increase the risk of liver-related events, death, or composite events (all p ≥
0.05). However, hepatitis C was associated with liver-related events [adjusted
hazard ratio (aHR), 1.59; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00-2.52], and blacks
had a higher risk of death (aHR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.01-2.22).
CONCLUSION: LT of patients with prior HBV exposure or use of anti-HBc
seropositive donors is not associated with increased risk of liver-related events
or death.
