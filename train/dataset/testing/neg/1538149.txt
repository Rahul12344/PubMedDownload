Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and newer serologic assays for hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) were used to investigate 19 HCV cross-challenge episodes in chimpanzees. In
these cross-challenges, 59% showed seroconversion after challenge, 33% showed
reappearance of HCV-associated hepatocellular ultrastructural changes, 5 animals 
not PCR-positive at the time of challenge showed return of PCR positivity, and
26% developed hepatitis after rechallenge. A total of 74% showed at least one of 
these signs of reinfection. The frequency of development of serologic and
ultrastructural responses was, however, reduced in secondary compared with
primary infections (P less than .01). In 10 animals, the cross-challenge was done
with heterologous strains, and in 9 with the originally infecting virus. There
was no significant difference in the responses to homologous and heterologous
challenges. The data suggest relatively weak immunity in HCV infections.
