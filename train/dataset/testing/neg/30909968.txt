OBJECTIVE: Anemia is the most common hematological complication of HIV infection 
that has a significant impact on the quality of life and clinical outcomes.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and associated
factors of anemia among adult HIV positive patients on Anti-retroviral therapy at
Deber Tabor hospital, northwest Ethiopia. An institution based cross-sectional
study was conducted on 365 HIV/AIDS patients on ART selected using the systematic
random sampling technique. Blood samples were analyzed using the Cell-DYN 1800
automated hematology analyzer to measure hemoglobin. Bivariable and multivariable
binary logistic regression analyzes were employed to find the predictors at
p-value < 0 .2 and 0.05, respectively.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of anemia was 34.0%[95% CI (29.0, 39.0)]; taking 
Zidovudine based antiretroviral regimen (AOR: 5.9, 95% CI 1.04, 13.86), CD4
count < 200 cells/mm3 (AOR: 4.8 95%, CI 1.14, 12.42), inability to read and write
(AOR: 3.2, 95% CI (1.24,8.40), inadequate dietary diversity (AOR: 2.2, 95% CI
1.15, 4.26), and female sex (AOR: 1.9, 95% CI 1.06, 3.69) were significantly
associated with increased odds of anemia. Therefore, routine screening of
hemoglobin level, proper treatment of respondents on zidovudine based ART regimen
and increasing productivity to improve dietary diversity are essential to prevent
anemia.
