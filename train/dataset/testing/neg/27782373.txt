BACKGROUND & AIMS: The proportion of HCV-infected patients over age 65 years in
Western countries is increasing. This growth and the advent of new antiviral
therapy bring into the question the real-world efficacy and safety of the
combination of sofosbuvir (SOF) and simeprevir (SMV) plus a flat dose of 800 mg/d
ribavirin (RBV) in elderly patients with cirrhosis compared to younger patients.
METHODS: Retrospective observational multicentre real-life investigation study of
SOF/SMV/RBV for a duration of 12 weeks in HCV genotype 1-infected patients with
cirrhosis.
RESULTS: Of the 270 patients enrolled in this study, with compensated cirrhosis, 
133 (49.2%) were ≥65 years of age. Sustained virological response at 12 weeks
(SVR12) was achieved by 94.2% (129/137) of those aged <65 years and 97.7%
(130/133) of those ≥65 years. Diabetes was the most common comorbidity in
patients ≥65 years compared to younger patients (26.3% vs 12.4% P<.003). The most
common adverse event (AE) in elderly patients was a grade 2 anaemia (35.3% vs
19.9% P<.004).
CONCLUSIONS: Sofosbuvir/simeprevir plus a daily flat dose of RBV 800 mg for
12 weeks was highly effective and safe in genotype 1 elderly patients with
compensated cirrhosis.
