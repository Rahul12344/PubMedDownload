PURPOSE: To describe the outcome of childhood primary central nervous system
lymphoma (PCNSL) treated with chemotherapy alone or with chemotherapy plus
cranial radiotherapy (CRT).
METHODS: Retrospective chart review of children with PCNSL at six tertiary care
pediatric centers.
RESULTS: Eight immunocompetent and four immunocompromised children were included.
Ten children received chemotherapy alone without CRT, with most receiving
high-dose methotrexate and high-dose cytarabine. Five year event-free survival
(EFS) in this group was 70.0 +/- 14.5%. Two children received chemotherapy plus
CRT; one relapsed and died while the other is alive in remission. Three children 
died, including two from relapsed disease. The other child with human
immunodeficiency virus infection died of an opportunistic infection while in
remission following chemotherapy alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Most children with PCNSL can achieve long-term remissions with
chemotherapy alone without CRT. Multi-center prospective studies are needed to
confirm or refute these results in a larger number of patients.
