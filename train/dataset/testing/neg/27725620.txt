BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a well-established oncogenic virus of
cervical, anogenital, and oropharyngeal cancer. Various subtypes of HPV have been
detected in 0% to 60% of breast cancers. The roles of HPV in the carcinogenesis
of breast cancer remain controversial. This study was performed to determine the 
prevalence of HPV-positive breast cancer in Korean patients and to evaluate the
possibility of carcinogenic effect of HPV on breast.
METHODS: Meta-analysis was performed in 22 case-control studies for HPV infection
in breast cancer. A total of 123 breast cancers, nine intraductal papillomas and 
13 nipple tissues of patients with proven cervical HPV infection were tested by
real-time polymerase chain reaction to detect 28 subtypes of HPV. Breast cancers 
were composed of 106 formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) breast cancer
samples and 17 touch imprint cytology samples of breast cancers.
RESULTS: The overall odds ratio between breast cancer and HPV infection was 5.43 
(95% confidence interval, 3.24 to 9.12) with I<sup>2</sup> = 34.5% in
meta-analysis of published studies with case-control setting and it was
statistically significant. HPV was detected in 22 cases of breast cancers (17.9%)
and two cases of intaductal papillomas (22.2%). However, these cases had weak
positivity.
CONCLUSIONS: These results failed to serve as significant evidence to support the
relationship between HPV and breast cancer. Further study with larger
epidemiologic population is merited to determine the relationship between HPV and
breast cancer.
