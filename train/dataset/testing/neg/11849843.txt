The flower of Trollius chinensis Bunge is used for treating upper respiratory
infections, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, and bronchitis in Chinese folk medicine.
The antiviral activities of the crude extract, total flavonoids, orientin,
vitexin and proglobeflowery acid isolated from the flowers of T. chinensis
against parainfluenza type 3 (Para 3) virus were investigated. The results showed
that the crude extract and total flavonoids exhibited a weak antiviral activity
against Para 3. Orientin and vitexin demonstrated potent or moderate antiviral
activity against Para 3. Proglobeflowery acid showed weak antiviral activity
against Para 3.
