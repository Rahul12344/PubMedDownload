BACKGROUND: Retrospective data suggest that cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) screening
in patients with late-stage human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) initiating
antiretroviral therapy (ART) may reduce cryptococcal disease and deaths.
Prospective data are limited.
METHODS: CrAg was measured using lateral flow assays (LFA) and latex
agglutination (LA) tests in 645 HIV-positive, ART-naive patients with CD4 counts 
≤100 cells/µL in Cape Town, South Africa. CrAg-positive patients were offered
lumbar puncture (LP) and treated with antifungals. Patients were started on ART
between 2 and 4 weeks and followed up for 1 year.
RESULTS: A total of 4.3% (28/645) of patients were CrAg positive in serum and
plasma with LFA. These included 16 also positive by urine LFA (2.5% of total
screened) and 7 by serum LA (1.1% of total). In 4 of 10 LFA-positive cases
agreeing to LP, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) CrAg LFA was positive. A positive
CSF CrAg was associated with higher screening plasma/serum LFA titers.Among the
28 CrAg-positive patients, mortality was 14.3% at 10 weeks and 25% at 12 months. 
Only 1 CrAg-positive patient, who defaulted from care, died from cryptococcal
meningitis (CM). Mortality in CrAg-negative patients was 11.5% at 1 year. Only 2 
possible CM cases were identified in CrAg-negative patients.
CONCLUSIONS: CrAg screening of individuals initiating ART and preemptive
fluconazole treatment of CrAg-positive patients resulted in markedly fewer cases 
of CM compared with historic unscreened cohorts. Studies are needed to refine
management of CrAg-positive patients who have high mortality that does not appear
to be wholly attributable to cryptococcal disease.
