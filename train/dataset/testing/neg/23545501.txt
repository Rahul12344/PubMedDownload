The DNA tumor virus Simian virus 40 (SV40) is a model system for studying
eukaryotic replication. SV40 large tumor antigen (LTag) is the initiator/helicase
that is essential for genome replication. LTag recognizes and assembles at the
viral replication origin. We determined the structure of two multidomain LTag
subunits bound to origin DNA. The structure reveals that the origin binding
domains (OBDs) and Zn and AAA+ domains are involved in origin recognition and
assembly. Notably, the OBDs recognize the origin in an unexpected manner. The
histidine residues of the AAA+ domains insert into a narrow minor groove region
with enhanced negative electrostatic potential. Computational analysis indicates 
that this region is intrinsically narrow, demonstrating the role of DNA shape
readout in origin recognition. Our results provide important insights into the
assembly of the LTag initiator/helicase at the replication origin and suggest
that histidine contacts with the minor groove serve as a mechanism of DNA shape
readout.
