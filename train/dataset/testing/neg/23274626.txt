Risks of introduction of lumpy skin disease (LSD) through traded Borena bulls to 
market chain and its consequences were assessed. The assessment used the
framework that has been recommended by the World Animal Health Organization (OIE)
for risk analysis. Likelihoods for release and exposure were estimated by a
qualitative scale ranging from negligible to very high, whereas the consequences 
which resulted from disease occurrences were assessed quantitatively. The
likelihood of the introduction of LSD to the market chain through traded Borena
bulls is found to be high (medium uncertainty), whereas the probability of
exposure is very high (medium uncertainty). From the total of 11,189 bulls
observed during outbreak investigation of LSD in six sites of feedlot operation
in and around Adama, 681(6.1 %) and 204 (1.8 %) bulls were found to be affected
and dead with LSD, respectively. The total economic loss due to LSD was estimated
to be 667,785.6 USD. The risk estimates for LSD are greater than negligible;
therefore, disease prevention and control strategy along the chain should be
carefully considered by the Ethiopian veterinary services.
