OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess epidemiological and clinical
features of human bocavirus (HBoV) coinfection with other viruses.
METHOD: Children coinfected with HBoV between January 2012 and December 2014 were
enrolled and retrospectively reviewed.
RESULT: A total of 984 patients were stratified into five groups: HBoV infection 
alone (n = 249), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection alone (n = 649),
HBoV coinfection with RSV (n = 28), with human rhinovirus (HRV) (n = 39) and with
other virus (n = 19). Length of hospitalization was longer in HBoV coinfection
with RSV group than HBoV (9.0 days vs. 7.0 days, p = 0.001), RSV (9.0 days vs.
8.0 days, p = 0.016) infection alone group. Pneumonia was more common in the HBoV
coinfection with RSV group compared with the HBoV, RSV infection alone group,
respectively (75.0% vs. 44.2%, 31.3%, p < 0.001). HBoV DNA copy numbers (383 000 
copies/ml) were positively correlated with the length of hospitalization
(r = 0.334, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: HBoV coinfection with RSV increases HBoV infection severity.
