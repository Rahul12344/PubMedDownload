According to the 2018 report of the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS
(UNAIDS), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a disease caused by the
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), remains a significant public health problem. 
The non-existence of a cure or effective vaccine for the disease and the
associated emergence of resistant viral strains imply an urgent need for the
discovery of novel anti-HIV drug candidates. The current study aimed to identify 
potential anti-retroviral compounds from Alchornea cordifolia. Bioactive
compounds were identified using several chromatographic and spectroscopic
techniques and subsequently evaluated for cytotoxicity and anti-HIV properties.
Molecular modelling studies against HIV-1 integrase (HIV-1 IN) were performed to 
decipher the mode of action of methylgallate, the most potent compound
(IC50 = 3.7 nM) and its analogues from ZINC database. Cytotoxicity assays showed 
that neither the isolated compounds nor the crude methanolic extract displayed
cytotoxicity effects on the HeLa cell line. A strong correlation between the in
vitro and in silico results was observed and important HIV-1 IN residues
interacting with the different compounds were identified. These current results
indicate that methylgallate is the main anti-HIV-1 compound in A. cordifolia stem
bark, and could be a potential platform for the development of new HIV-1 IN
inhibitors.
