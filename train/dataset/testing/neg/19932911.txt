Virus-like particles (VLPs) present viral antigens in a native conformation and
are effectively recognized by the immune system and therefore are considered as
suitable and safe vaccine candidates against many viral diseases. Here we
demonstrate that chimeric VLPs containing Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV)
glycoproteins G(N) and G(C), nucleoprotein N and the gag protein of Moloney
murine leukemia virus represent an effective vaccine candidate against Rift
Valley fever, a deadly disease in humans and livestock. Long-lasting humoral and 
cellular immune responses are demonstrated in a mouse model by the analysis of
neutralizing antibody titers and cytokine secretion profiles. Vaccine efficacy
studies were performed in mouse and rat lethal challenge models resulting in high
protection rates. Taken together, these results demonstrate that
replication-incompetent chimeric RVF VLPs are an efficient RVFV vaccine
candidate.
