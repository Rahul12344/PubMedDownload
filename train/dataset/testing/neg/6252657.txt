[Recent developments in the preparation of vaccines (author's transl)].

[Article in Dutch]

Meloen RH.

Recent developments in biochemistry, immunology and organic chemistry suggest two
new methods of producing vaccines. These new procedures which may perhaps be
adopted in the future, are described. It is shown that, in the case of foot- and 
mouth disease, viral protein 1 (VP1) rather than the complete virus may be used
in a vaccine. This protein could be produced by genetic manipulation. The
isolated antigenic site responsible for inducing neutralizing anti-bodies might
also be utilized in a vaccine. This antigenic site which probably is not any
longer than ten amino acids, may be produced by organic chemical synthesis once
its sequence is known. Both in the case of VP1 and in that of the antigenic site,
the immunogenities of these products have to be increased as VP1 is less
immunogenic than a comparable amount of complete virus, whereas the antigenic
site presumably is not immunogenic at all. These new vaccines are safer and
possibly cheaper to produce than the classical ones are. Moreover vaccines
against viral diseases could be produced, which cannot be obtained by classical
methods.
