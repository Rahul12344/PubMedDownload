An outbreak of gastroenteritis in young children caused by adenoviruses.

During October and November, 1978, gastroenteritis developed in 17 of 24 young
children aged between eight months and two years from an R.A.F. station in the
U.K. The illness, in which diarrhoea was always the predominant symptom, had an
incubation period of eight to ten days and lasted about a week. It seemed to be
transmitted from child to child, and in all but one instance parents and older
siblings remained well. Stool specimens from 14 of the affected children were
examined bacteriologically and virologically, and a highly significant
association was found between the presence of adenovirus particles in stools,
identified by electron microscopy, and the acute stage of the illness. This
evidence suggests that an adenovirus was the cause of this outbreak of
gastroenteritis.
