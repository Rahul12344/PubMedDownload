Mixed cryoglobulinemia is a systemic vasculitis described as a triad
characterized by purpura, weakness and arthralgias. Since the first description
of the disease in 1964 by Meltzer and Franklin our understanding of its
pathogenesis has increased considerably. The striking association of the disease 
with hepatitis C virus infection was initially noted in 1990. Since then, the
disease has gained growing attention among investigators involved in the study of
autoimmune systemic disorders because it represents one of the most intriguing
models of autoimmunity triggered by a virus. Nonetheless, a number of answered
questions still remain to be resolved and are reviewed in this article.
