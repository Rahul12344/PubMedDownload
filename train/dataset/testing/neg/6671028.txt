[Relation between primary and secondary antirubella immunization in a school
population].

Benvegn√π F, Gottardi G, Daniel L, Baraldo L.

The A.A. have analyzed the behaviour of the antibody titer against rubella in a
limited number of people constituted of two groups of student-girls (vaccinated
and not vaccinated, aged 12). It has been noticed that between the not-vaccinated
ones exists a high prevalence of serum-positives (89%), almost all with negative 
anamnesis for rubella, whose mean titer was 1:135. It has also been noticed that 
after the vaccination the prevalence of serum-positives was 94% whose mean titer 
was 1:97, inferior to that of natural immunization: 1:135.
