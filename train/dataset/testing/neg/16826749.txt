The review details natural immunological factors that are the first-line
protection from herpes simplex virus. These reactions may be conventionally
divided into 3 active phases. In Phase 1, the virus is attacked by proteins, such
as complement of precursors of natural class M (IgM) antibodies and antimicrobial
peptides. In Phase 2, the interferons produced by infected epithelial and
resident dendritic cells go into action. And, finally, in Phase 3, effector
cells, such as neutrophils, macrophages, and natural killer cells, show antiviral
activity.
