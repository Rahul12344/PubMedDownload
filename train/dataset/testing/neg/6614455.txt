A simple quantitative method for the determination of 3-fluorotyrosine
substitution in proteins.

Kehry MR, Wilson ML, Dahlquist FW.

A rapid quantitative method is described for determining 3-fluorotyrosine
incorporation into proteins. Derivatives of tyrosine and 3-fluorotyrosine with
o-phthalaldehyde are well separated from one another by a reverse-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography system used for routine analyses of
o-phthalaldehyde-amino acid derivatives. Since both amino acids are well resolved
from all other derivatized amino acids, the method is useful for amino acid
analyses of proteins. Determination of the fluorotyrosine content of proteins by 
this method involves a single separation step, is reproducible, and requires no
corrections for stability or yield. Further, the o-phthalaldehyde derivatives of 
5-fluorotryptophan, 2-fluorophenylalanine, 3-fluorophenylalanine, and
4-fluorophenylalanine can also be resolved. The method may be generally
applicable to fluorinated aromatic amino acid-labeled proteins that are studied
structurally and dynamically by nuclear magnetic resonance.
