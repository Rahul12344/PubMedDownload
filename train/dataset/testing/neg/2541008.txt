A message-dependent, cell-free translation system was prepared from both
uninduced and N,N'-hexamethylene-bis-acetamide-induced Friend erythroleukemia
cells following modification of standard protocols. Active extracts were prepared
by lysing Friend erythroleukemia cells in hypotonic buffer containing 50 microM
hemin and 10 mM cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and assaying translation
in vitro in the absence of exogenous nucleoside triphosphates. Both hemin and
cAMP were required for full activity and appeared to act by prolonging initiation
in vitro. Following treatment of cell extracts with micrococcal nuclease, brome
mosaic virus, globin, equine herpesvirus type 1, and frog virus 3 mRNA were
efficiently translated to yield full-sized products. Using brome mosaic virus as 
a test message, levels of translation equivalent to 30%-50% of that seen in
mock-treated lysates were obtained. These results attest to the translational
efficiency of extracts prepared and assayed in the manner described above, and
suggest that such extracts may be useful both for routine translational studies, 
and as a tool to dissect translational changes accompanying erythroid
differentiation in vitro.
