Solid-state NMR spectroscopy was used to analyze the conformational heterogeneity
of the major coat protein (pVIII) of filamentous bacteriophage fd. Both one and
two-dimensional solid-state NMR spectra of magnetically aligned samples of fd
bacteriophage reveal that an increase in temperature and a single site
substitution (Tyr21 to Met, Y21M) reduce the conformational heterogeneity
observed throughout wild-type pVIII. The NMR results are consistent with previous
studies indicating that conformational flexibility in the hinge-bend segment that
links the amphipathic and hydrophobic helices in the membrane-bound form of the
protein plays an essential role during phage assembly, which involves a major
change in the tertiary, but not secondary, structure of the coat protein.
