PURPOSE: Success of Ebola virus (EBOV) as a human pathogen relates at the
molecular level primarily to blockade the host cell type I interferon (IFN)
antiviral response. Most individuals who survive Ebola virus disease (EVD)
develop a chronic disease syndrome: approximately one-quarter of survivors suffer
from uveitis, which has been associated with presence of EBOV within the eye.
Clinical observations of post-Ebola uveitis indicate involvement of retinal
pigment epithelial cells.
METHODS: We inoculated ARPE-19 human retinal pigment epithelial cells with EBOV, 
and followed course of infection by immunocytochemistry and measurement of titer 
in culture supernatant. To interrogate transcriptional responses of infected
cells, we combined RNA sequencing with in silico pathway, gene ontology,
transcription factor binding site, and network analyses. We measured
infection-induced changes of selected transcripts by reverse
transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Human retinal pigment epithelial cells were permissive to infection with
EBOV, and supported viral replication and release of virus in high titer.
Unexpectedly, 28% of 560 upregulated transcripts in EBOV-infected cells were type
I IFN responsive, indicating a robust type I IFN response. Following EBOV
infection, cells continued to express multiple immunomodulatory molecules linked 
to ocular immune privilege.
CONCLUSIONS: Human retinal pigment epithelial cells may serve as an intraocular
reservoir for EBOV, and the molecular response of infected cells may contribute
to the persistence of live EBOV within the human eye.
TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: This bedside-to-bench research links ophthalmic findings
in survivors of EVD who suffer from uveitis with interactions between retinal
pigment epithelial cells and EBOV.
