Viral inhibitors, such as pleconaril and vapendavir, target conserved regions in 
the capsids of rhinoviruses (RVs) and enteroviruses (EVs) by binding to a
hydrophobic pocket in viral capsid protein 1 (VP1). In resistant RVs and EVs,
bulky residues in this pocket prevent their binding. However, recently developed 
pyrazolopyrimidines inhibit pleconaril-resistant RVs and EVs, and computational
modeling has suggested that they also bind to the hydrophobic pocket in VP1. We
studied the mechanism of inhibition of pleconaril-resistant RVs using RV-B5 (1 of
the 7 naturally pleconaril-resistant rhinoviruses) and OBR-5-340, a bioavailable 
pyrazolopyrimidine with proven in vivo activity, and determined the 3D-structure 
of the protein-ligand complex to 3.6 Å with cryoelectron microscopy. Our data
indicate that, similar to other capsid binders, OBR-5-340 induces thermostability
and inhibits viral adsorption and uncoating. However, we found that OBR-5-340
attaches closer to the entrance of the pocket than most other capsid binders,
whose viral complexes have been studied so far, showing only marginal overlaps of
the attachment sites. Comparing the experimentally determined 3D structure with
the control, RV-B5 incubated with solvent only and determined to 3.2 Å, revealed 
no gross conformational changes upon OBR-5-340 binding. The pocket of the
naturally OBR-5-340-resistant RV-A89 likewise incubated with OBR-5-340 and solved
to 2.9 Å was empty. Pyrazolopyrimidines have a rigid molecular scaffold and may
thus be less affected by a loss of entropy upon binding. They interact with
less-conserved regions than known capsid binders. Overall, pyrazolopyrimidines
could be more suitable for the development of new, broadly active inhibitors.
