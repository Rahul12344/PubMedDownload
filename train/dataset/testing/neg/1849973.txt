The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) mutant in1814 possesses an insertion
mutation that abolishes trans-activation of immediate early (IE) transcription by
the virion protein Vmw65. Interactions between in1814 and the host cell were
examined by use of an in vitro latency system which relies on infection of human 
foetal lung (HFL) cells at 42 degrees C to prevent lytic growth of virus. Mutant 
in1814 was retained in HFL cells after infection at low m.o.i. and incubation at 
42 degrees C, and was reactivated by superinfection of monolayers with viruses
that express the HSV-1 IE protein Vmw110. Moreover, latency was established by
in1814 in an analogous manner at 37 degrees C. The low cytotoxicity of in1814
enabled an investigation of latency after infection at high m.o.i. (five
particles per cell) to be undertaken. At 42 degrees C, or at 37 degrees C in the 
presence of an inhibitor of DNA synthesis, in1814 DNA was maintained at low
abundance (one to eight copies per infected cell) in a non-linear configuration. 
The absence of trans-activation by Vmw65 therefore predisposes HSV to latency, as
opposed to lytic growth, in HFL cells, resulting in the retention of the genome
in a form resembling that found in vivo.
