Paradoxical deterioration during antituberculous therapy is defined as the
clinical or radiological worsening of pre-existing tuberculous lesions or the
development of new lesions in a patient who initially improves. Although it has
frequently been reported for patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV), it can also be seen in HIV-negative patients. Here, we present a case of
miliary tuberculosis in a patient who clinically deteriorates after
antituberculous treatment, and discuss this confusing entity under the light of
the pertinent literature.
