AIM: The aim of the present study was to describe the salivary shedding of human 
herpesviruses (HHV) in renal transplant recipients and to observe the oral
manifestations in this group.
METHODS: A prospective case-control study was conducted with a study group of 20 
renal transplant recipients and a control group of 20 non-transplanted,
immunocompetent individuals. Clinical examination evaluated the presence of
drug-induced gingival overgrowth (DIGO), salivary flow, and caries. Stimulated
saliva was collected from both groups, with HHV being detected by using real-time
polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: The mean age of the study group was 45.90 ± 9.89 years, with 55% (11/20)
being female, 60% (12/20) being Caucasian, 65% (13/20) having a deceased donor,
and 70% (14/20) having used tacrolimus as the main immunosuppressive drug. Renal 
transplant recipients had shedding of more herpesviruses compared to the control 
group, with the exception of HHV-7. Statistical significance was found for herpes
simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) (P = 0.017) and cytomegalovirus (P = 0.035). DIGO was
observed in seven patients (35%), with 35% (7/20) presenting with decreased
salivary flow and four (20%) reporting xerostomia.
CONCLUSION: Renal transplant recipients excreted herpesviruses more often than
control individuals, especially HSV-1. Decreased salivary flow and xerostomia
were more frequent in patients who used tacrolimus, whereas those who used
cyclosporine had more cases of DIGO.
