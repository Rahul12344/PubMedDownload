Humanized mouse models present an important tool for preclinical evaluation of
new vaccines and therapeutics. Here we show the human variable repertoire of
antibody sequences cloned from a previously described human immune system (HIS)
mouse model that possesses functional human CD4+ T cells and B cells, namely
HIS-CD4/B mice. We sequenced variable IgG genes from single memory B-cell and
plasma-cell sorted from splenocytes or whole blood lymphocytes of HIS-CD4/B mice 
that were vaccinated with a human plasmodial antigen, a recombinant Plasmodium
falciparum circumsporozoite protein (rPfCSP). We demonstrate that rPfCSP
immunization triggers a diverse B-cell IgG repertoire composed of various human
VH family genes and distinct V(D)J recombinations that constitute diverse CDR3
sequences similar to humans, although low hypermutated sequences were generated. 
These results demonstrate the substantial genetic diversity of responding human B
cells of HIS-CD4/B mice and their capacity to mount human IgG class-switched
antibody response upon vaccination.
