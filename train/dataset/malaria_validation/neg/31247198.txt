The malaria parasite sporozoite sequentially invades mosquito salivary glands and
mammalian hepatocytes; and is the Plasmodium lifecycle infective form mediating
parasite transmission by the mosquito vector. The identification of several
sporozoite-specific secretory proteins involved in invasion has revealed that
sporozoite motility and specific recognition of target cells are crucial for
transmission. It has also been demonstrated that some components of the invasion 
machinery are conserved between erythrocytic asexual and transmission stage
parasites. The application of a sporozoite stage-specific gene knockdown system
in the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium berghei, enables us to investigate the
roles of such proteins previously intractable to study due to their essentiality 
for asexual intraerythrocytic stage development, the stage at which transgenic
parasites are derived. Here, we focused on the rhoptry neck protein 11 (RON11)
that contains multiple transmembrane domains and putative calcium-binding EF-hand
domains. PbRON11 is localised to rhoptry organelles in both merozoites and
sporozoites. To repress PbRON11 expression exclusively in sporozoites, we
produced transgenic parasites using a promoter-swapping strategy.
PbRON11-repressed sporozoites showed significant reduction in attachment and
motility in vitro, and consequently failed to efficiently invade salivary glands.
PbRON11 was also determined to be essential for sporozoite infection of the
liver, the first step during transmission to the vertebrate host. RON11 is
demonstrated to be crucial for sporozoite invasion of both target host cells -
mosquito salivary glands and mammalian hepatocytes - via involvement in
sporozoite motility.
