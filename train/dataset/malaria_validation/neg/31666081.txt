BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum malaria remains a major health problem in
Africa. The mechanisms of pathogenesis are not fully understood. Transcriptomic
studies may provide new insights into molecular pathways involved in the severe
form of the disease.
METHODS: Blood transcriptional levels were assessed in patients with cerebral
malaria, non-cerebral malaria, or mild malaria by using microarray technology to 
look for gene expression profiles associated with clinical status. Multi-way
ANOVA was used to extract differentially expressed genes. Network and pathways
analyses were used to detect enrichment for biological pathways.
RESULTS: We identified a set of 443 genes that were differentially expressed in
the three patient groups after applying a false discovery rate of 10%. Since the 
cerebral patients displayed a particular transcriptional pattern, we focused our 
analysis on the differences between cerebral malaria patients and mild malaria
patients. We further found 842 differentially expressed genes after applying a
false discovery rate of 10%. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of cerebral
malaria-informative genes led to clustering of the cerebral malaria patients. The
support vector machine method allowed us to correctly classify five out of six
cerebral malaria patients and six of six mild malaria patients. Furthermore, the 
products of the differentially expressed genes were mapped onto a human
protein-protein network. This led to the identification of the proteins with the 
highest number of interactions, including GSK3B, RELA, and APP. The enrichment
analysis of the gene functional annotation indicates that genes involved in
immune signalling pathways play a role in the occurrence of cerebral malaria.
These include BCR-, TCR-, TLR-, cytokine-, FcεRI-, and FCGR- signalling pathways 
and natural killer cell cytotoxicity pathways, which are involved in the
activation of immune cells. In addition, our results revealed an enrichment of
genes involved in Alzheimer's disease.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we examine a set of genes whose expression
differed in cerebral malaria patients and mild malaria patients. Moreover, our
results provide new insights into the potential effect of the dysregulation of
gene expression in immune pathways. Host genetic variation may partly explain
such alteration of gene expression. Further studies are required to investigate
this in African populations.
