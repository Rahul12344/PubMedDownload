One of the most important step in structure-based drug design studies is
obtaining the protein in active form after cloning the target gene. In one of our
previous study, it was determined that an internal Shine-Dalgarno-like sequence
present just before the third methionine at N-terminus of wild type lactate
dehydrogenase enzyme of Plasmodium falciparum prevent the translation of full
length protein. Inspection of the same region in P. vivax LDH, which was
overproduced as an active enzyme, indicated that the codon preference in the same
region was slightly different than the codon preference of wild type PfLDH. In
this study, 5'-GGAGGC-3' sequence of P. vivax that codes for two glycine residues
just before the third methionine was exchanged to 5'-GGAGGA-3', by mimicking P.
falciparum LDH, to prove the possible effects of having an internal SD-like
sequence when expressing an eukaryotic protein in a prokaryotic system. Exchange 
was made by site-directed mutagenesis. Results indicated that having two glycine 
residues with an internal SD-like sequence (GGAGGA) just before the third
methionine abolishes the enzyme activity due to the preference of the prokaryotic
system used for the expression. This study emphasizes the awareness of use of a
prokaryotic system to overproduce an eukaryotic protein.
