BACKGROUND: A vaccine that targets multiple developmental stages of malaria
parasites would be an effective tool for malaria control and elimination.
METHODS: A conserved gene in Plasmodium, the Plasmodium berghei gene
(PBANKA_020570) encoding a 51Â kDa protein (pb51 gene), was identified through
search of the PlasmoDB database using a combination of expression and protein
localization criteria. A partial domain of the Pb51 protein was expressed in a
prokaryotic expression system (rPb51) and used for immunization in mice. The
protein expression profile and localization were studied by Western blot and
indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), respectively. The inhibitory effect of
the anti-rPb51 antibodies on parasite proliferation was evaluated in erythrocytes
in vivo. The transmission-blocking activity of the immune sera was determined by 
in vitro ookinete conversion assay and by direct mosquito feeding assay (DFA).
RESULTS: The rPb51 elicited specific antibodies in mice. Western blot confirmed
Pb51 expression in schizonts, gametocytes and ookinetes. IFA showed localization 
of Pb51 on the outer membranes of schizonts, gametocytes, zygotes, retorts,
ookinetes and sporozoites of P. berghei. Mice immunized with the rPb51 protein
significantly reduced parasite proliferation and gametocyte conversion in vivo.
Moreover, the rPb51 antisera also significantly reduced the in vitro ookinete
conversion when added into the ookinete culture medium. In DFA, mice immunized
with the rPb51 reduced the prevalence of mosquito infection by 21.3% and oocyst
density by 54.8%.
CONCLUSIONS: In P. berghei, P51 was expressed in both asexual erythrocytic and
sexual stages and localized on the surface of these stages with the exception of 
the ring stage. The anti-rPb51 antibodies inhibited both P. berghei proliferation
in mice and transmission of the parasite to mosquitoes.
