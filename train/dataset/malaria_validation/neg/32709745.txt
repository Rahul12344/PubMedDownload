Infection by malaria parasites triggers dynamic immune responses leading to
diverse symptoms and pathologies; however, the molecular mechanisms responsible
for these reactions are largely unknown. We performed Trans-species Expression
Quantitative Trait Locus analysis to identify a large number of host genes that
respond to malaria parasite infections. Here we functionally characterize one of 
the host genes called receptor transporter protein 4 (RTP4) in responses to
malaria parasite and virus infections. RTP4 is induced by type I IFN (IFN-I) and 
binds to the TANK-binding kinase (TBK1) complex where it negatively regulates
TBK1 signaling by interfering with expression and phosphorylation of both TBK1
and IFN regulatory factor 3. Rtp4 -/- mice were generated and infected with
malaria parasite Plasmodiun berghei ANKA. Significantly higher levels of IFN-I
response in microglia, lower parasitemia, fewer neurologic symptoms, and better
survival rates were observed in Rtp4 -/- than in wild-type mice. Similarly, RTP4 
deficiency significantly reduced West Nile virus titers in the brain, but not in 
the heart and the spleen, of infected mice, suggesting a specific role for RTP4
in brain infection and pathology. This study reveals functions of RTP4 in IFN-I
response and a potential target for therapy in diseases with neuropathology.
