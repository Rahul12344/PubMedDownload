Mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT)
protein confer resistance to the antimalarial drug chloroquine. PfCRT localizes
to the parasite digestive vacuole, the site of chloroquine action, where it
mediates resistance by transporting chloroquine out of the digestive vacuole.
PfCRT belongs to a family of transporter proteins called the chloroquine
resistance transporter family. CRT family proteins are found throughout the
Apicomplexa, in some protists, and in plants. Despite the importance of PfCRT in 
drug resistance, little is known about the evolution or native function of CRT
proteins. The apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii contains one CRT family
protein. We demonstrate that T. gondii CRT (TgCRT) colocalizes with markers for
the vacuolar (VAC) compartment in these parasites. The TgCRT-containing VAC is a 
highly dynamic organelle, changing its morphology and protein composition between
intracellular and extracellular forms of the parasite. Regulated knockdown of
TgCRT expression resulted in modest reduction in parasite fitness and swelling of
the VAC, indicating that TgCRT contributes to parasite growth and VAC physiology.
Together, our findings provide new information on the role of CRT family proteins
in apicomplexan parasites.
