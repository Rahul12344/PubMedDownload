BACKGROUND: Anopheles anthropophagus, one of the most important mosquito-borne
disease vectors in Asia, mainly takes blood meals from humans and transmits both 
malaria and filariae. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, and play a
critical role in many cellular processes, including development, differentiation,
apoptosis and innate immunity.
METHODS: We investigated the global miRNA expression profile of male and female
adults of A. anthropophagus using illumina Hiseq2000 sequencing combined with
Northern blot.
RESULTS: By using the miRNAs of the closely-related species Anopheles gambiae and
Aedes aegypti as reference, we obtained 102 miRNAs candidates out of 12.43
million raw sequencing reads for male and 16.51 million reads for female, with 81
of them found as known miRNAs in An. gambiae and/or Ae. aegypti, and the
remaining 21 miRNAs were considered as novel. By analyzing the revised read count
of miRNAs in male and female, 29 known miRNAs show sexual difference expression: 
>2-fold in the read count of the same miRNAs in male and female. Especially for
miR-989, which is highly expressed in the female mosquitoes, but shows almost no 
detected expression in male mosquitoes, indicating that miR-989 may be involved
in the physiological activity of female mosquito adults. The expression of four
miRNAs in different growth stages of mosquito were further identified by Northern
blot. Several miRNAs show the stage-specific expression, of which miR-2943 only
expressed in the egg stage, suggesting that miR-2943 may be associated with the
development of mosquito eggs.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study represents the first global characterization of
An. anthropophagus miRNAs in sexual differences and stage-specific functions. A
better understanding of the functions of these miRNAs will offer new insights in 
mosquito biology and has implications for the effective control of mosquito-borne
infectious diseases.
