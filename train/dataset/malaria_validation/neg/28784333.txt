Malaria blood stage parasites develop within red blood cells where they are
contained in a vacuolar compartment known as the parasitophorous vacuole (PV).
This compartment holds a key role in the interaction of the parasite with its
host cell. However, the proteome of this compartment has so far not been
comprehensively analysed. Here we used BioID in asexual blood stages of the most 
virulent human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum to identify new proteins of
the PV. The resulting proteome contained many of the already known PV proteins
and validation by GFP-knock-in of 10 previously in P. falciparum uncharacterised 
hits revealed 5 new PV proteins and two with a partial PV localisation. This
included proteins peripherally attached to the inner face of the PV membrane as
well as proteins anchored in the parasite plasma membrane that protrude into the 
PV. Using selectable targeted gene disruption we generated mutants for 2 of the
10 candidates. In contrast we could not select parasites with disruptions for
another 3 candidates, strongly suggesting that they are important for parasite
growth. Interestingly, one of these included the orthologue of UIS2, a protein
previously proposed to regulate protein translation in the parasite cytoplasm but
here shown to be an essential PV protein. This work extends the number of known
PV proteins and provides a starting point for further functional analyses of this
compartment.
