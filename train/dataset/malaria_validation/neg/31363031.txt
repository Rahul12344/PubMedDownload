During its intraerythrocytic development, the malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum exposes variant surface antigens (VSAs) on infected erythrocytes to
establish and maintain an infection. One family of small VSAs is the polymorphic 
STEVOR proteins, which are marked for export to the host cell surface through
their PEXEL signal peptide. Interestingly, some STEVORs have also been reported
to localize to the parasite plasma membrane and apical organelles, pointing
toward a putative function in host cell egress or invasion. Using deep RNA
sequencing analysis, we characterized P. falciparum stevor gene expression across
the intraerythrocytic development cycle, including free merozoites, in detail and
used the resulting stevor expression profiles for hierarchical clustering. We
found that most stevor genes show biphasic expression oscillation, with maximum
expression during trophozoite stages and a second peak in late schizonts. We
selected four STEVOR variants, confirmed the expected export of these proteins to
the host cell membrane, and tracked them to a secondary location, either to the
parasite plasma membrane or the secretory organelles of merozoites in late
schizont stages. We investigated the function of a particular STEVOR that showed 
rhoptry localization and demonstrated its role at the parasite-host interface
during host cell invasion by specific antisera and targeted gene disruption.
Experimentally determined membrane topology of this STEVOR revealed a single
transmembrane domain exposing the semiconserved as well as variable protein
regions to the cell surface.IMPORTANCE Malaria claims about half a million lives 
each year. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most severe form of 
the disease, uses proteins that are translocated to the surface of infected
erythrocytes for immune evasion. To circumvent the detection of these gene
products by the immune system, the parasite evolved a complex strategy that
includes gene duplications and elaborate sequence polymorphism. STEVORs are one
family of these variant surface antigens and are encoded by about 40 genes. Using
deep RNA sequencing of blood-stage parasites, including free merozoites, we first
established stevor expression of the cultured isolate and compared it with
published transcriptomes. We reveal a biphasic expression of most stevor genes
and confirm this for individual STEVORs at the protein level. The membrane
topology of a rhoptry-associated variant was experimentally elucidated and linked
to host cell invasion, underlining the importance of this multifunctional protein
family for parasite proliferation.
