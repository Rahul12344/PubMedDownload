BACKGROUND: Extensive studies investigating the role of host genetic factors
during malaria associate glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency with
relative protection. G6PD deficiency had been reported to associate with
anti-malarial drug induced with haemolytic anaemia.
METHODS: A total of 301 Gabonese, Ghanaian, and Kenyan children aged 6-120 months
with severe malaria recruited in a multicentre trial on artesunate were included 
in this sub-study. G6PD normal (type B), heterozygous (type A(+)) and deficient
(type A(-)) genotypes were determined by direct sequencing of the common African 
mutations G202A and A376G. Furthermore, multivariate analyses were executed to
associate possible contributions of G6PD deficiency with baseline haemoglobin
levels, parasitaemia and with severe malarial anaemia.
RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-eight children (132 females and 146 males) were 
successfully genotyped for G6PD variants. The overall prevalence of G6PD
deficiency was 13 % [36/278; 3 % (4/132) female homozygous and 22 % (32/146) male
hemizygous], 14 % (40/278) children were female heterozygous while 73 % (202/278)
were G6PD normal [67 % (88/132) females and 78 % (114/146) males] individuals.
Multivariate regression revealed a significant association of moderately and
severely deficient G6PD genotypes with haemoglobin levels according to the
baseline data (p < 0.0001; G6PD heterozygous: p < 0.0001; G6PD deficient:
p = 0.009), but not with severe malarial anaemia (p = 0.66). No association of
G6PD genotypes with baseline parasitaemia.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, moderately (type A(+)) and severely (type A(-)) G6PD 
deficiency showed significant association with lower haemoglobin concentrations
at baseline in African children with severe malaria without leading to severe
malarial anaemia. In addition, there was no association of G6PD variant types
with parasite densities on admission.
