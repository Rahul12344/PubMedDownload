BACKGROUND: In Nigeria, despite the change in National malaria drug policy to
artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) in 2005 due to widespread chloroquine
resistance, chloroquine (CQ) is still widely used in the treatment of malaria
because it is cheap, affordable and accessible. The use of ACT for the management
of uncomplicated malaria is currently being promoted. The employment of genetic
markers to track circulating chloroquine-resistant parasites are useful in
elucidating likely poor efficacy of chloroquine, especially in settings where it 
is not recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. This
study determined the prevalence of pfcrt haplotypes and point mutations in pfmdr1
genes four years after the change in antimalarial treatment policy from CQ to the
ACTs in Lagos, a commercial city in South-West, Nigeria.
METHODS: This was a cross sectional study on uncomplicated malaria in children
less than 12Â years that presented with fever and other symptoms suggestive of
malaria. Parasite DNA was extracted from 119 patients out of 251 children who
were positive for Plasmodium falciparum by microscopy and amplified. The
occurrence of haplotypes was investigated in pfcrt gene using probe-based qPCR
and single nucleotide polymorphisms in pfmdr1 gene using nested PCR.
RESULTS: One hundred and nine (109) of the 119 children with P falciparum
infection (91.6%) harbourd parasites with the mutant pfcrt haplotype (CVIET). Out
of this, 4.2% comprised a mixture of genotypes encoding CVMNK and CVIET, while
4.2% had the wild type (CVMNK). Furthermore, the frequency of point mutations in 
pfmdr1 was 62.2% and 69.0% for codons Y86 and F184 respectively. There were no
mutations at codons 1034, 1042 and 1246 of the Pfmdr1 genes.
CONCLUSION: The high frequency of the CQ-resistant haplotypes (CVIET) and
mutations in Pfmdr1 associated with CQ resistance in P. falciparum among these
children suggest that CQ-resistant parasites are still in circulation. Continuous
use of chloroquine may continue to increase the level of mutations in pfcrt and
pfmdr1genes. There is need to strengthen current case management efforts at
promoting ACT use as well as urgently restricting access to chloroquine by the
National drug regulatory agency, National Agency for Food Drug Administration and
Control (NAFDAC).
