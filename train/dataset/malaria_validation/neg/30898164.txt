BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization recommends regular therapeutic efficacy
studies (TES) to monitor the performance of first and second-line anti-malarials.
In 2016, efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for the treatment of
uncomplicated falciparum malaria were assessed through a TES conducted between
April and October 2016 at four sentinel sites of Kibaha, Mkuzi, Mlimba, and Ujiji
in Tanzania. The study also assessed molecular markers of artemisinin and
lumefantrine (partner drug) resistance.
METHODS: Eligible patients were enrolled at the four sites, treated with standard
doses of AL, and monitored for 28 days with clinical and laboratory assessments. 
The main outcomes were PCR corrected cure rates, day 3 positivity rates, safety
of AL, and prevalence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum
kelch 13 (Pfk13) (codon positions: 440-600) and P. falciparum multi-drug
resistance 1 (Pfmdr1) genes (codons: N86Y, Y184F and D1246Y), markers of
artemisinin and lumefantrine resistance, respectively.
RESULTS: Of 344 patients enrolled, three withdrew, six were lost to follow-up;
and results were analysed for 335 (97.4%) patients. Two patients had treatment
failure (one early treatment failure and one recrudescent infection) after PCR
correction, yielding an adequate clinical and parasitological response of > 98%. 
Day 3 positivity rates ranged from 0 to 5.7%. Common adverse events included
cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Two patients had serious adverse 
events; one died after the first dose of AL and another required hospitalization 
after the second dose of AL (on day 0) but recovered completely. Of 344 samples
collected at enrolment (day 0), 92.7% and 100% were successfully sequenced for
Pfk13 and Pfmdr1 genes, respectively. Six (1.9%) had non-synonymous mutations in 
Pfk13, none of which had been previously associated with artemisinin resistance. 
For Pfmdr1, the NFD haplotype (codons N86, 184F and D1246) was detected in 134
(39.0%) samples; ranging from 33.0% in Mlimba to 45.5% at Mkuzi. The difference
among the four sites was not significant (p = 0.578). All samples had a single
copy of the Pfmdr1 gene.
CONCLUSION: The study indicated high efficacy of AL and the safety profile was
consistent with previous reports. There were no known artemisinin-resistance
Pfk13 mutations, but there was a high prevalence of a Pfmdr1 haplotype associated
with reduced sensitivity to lumefantrine (but no reduced efficacy was observed in
the subjects). Continued TES and monitoring of markers of resistance to
artemisinin and partner drugs is critical for early detection of resistant
parasites and to inform evidence-based malaria treatment policies. Trial
