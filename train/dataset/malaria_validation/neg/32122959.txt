Innovative tools are essential for advancing malaria control and depend on an
understanding of molecular mechanisms governing transmission of malaria parasites
by Anopheles mosquitoes. CRISPR/Cas9-based gene disruption is a powerful method
to uncover underlying biology of vector-pathogen interactions and can itself form
the basis of mosquito control strategies. However, embryo injection methods used 
to genetically manipulate mosquitoes (especially Anopheles) are difficult and
inefficient, particularly for non-specialist laboratories. Here, we adapted the
ReMOT Control (Receptor-mediated Ovary Transduction of Cargo) technique to
deliver Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex to adult mosquito ovaries, generating
targeted and heritable mutations in the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi
without injecting embryos. In Anopheles, ReMOT Control gene editing was as
efficient as standard embryo injections. The application of ReMOT Control to
Anopheles opens the power of CRISPR/Cas9 methods to malaria laboratories that
lack the equipment or expertise to perform embryo injections and establishes the 
flexibility of ReMOT Control for diverse mosquito species.
