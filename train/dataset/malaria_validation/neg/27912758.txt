BACKGROUND: Recent reports of emergence and spread of artemisinin resistance in
the Southeast Asia region, including Myanmar, pose a greater threat to malaria
control and elimination in India. WholeÂ genome sequencing studies have associated
mutations in the K13 propeller gene (k13), PF3D7_1343700 with artemisinin
resistance both in vitro and in vivo. The aim of the present study was to find
the k13 gene polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum parasites from the three
sites in the Northeast region of India, bordering Bangladesh and Myanmar.
METHODS: A total of 254 samples collected during 2014-2015 from Tripura, Mizoram 
and Arunachal Pradesh states in the Northeast region of India were used to obtain
the full-length k13 gene sequences.
RESULTS: Three non-synonymous (NS) mutations: two in the propeller region, namely
at codon 446 and 578, were observed besides one at codon 189 in the non-propeller
region. The treatment outcome was not affected by these mutations at any of the
sites. In addition, microsatellite variation in the N-terminus of the k13 protein
was observed at all the study sites.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to document the presence of F446I NS mutation
in the k13 propeller region from Changlang district, Arunachal Pradesh, a site
adjoining the Indo-Myanmar border region, where this mutation is highly
prevalent. In addition, NS mutation A578S has been observed only at Lunglei
district, Mizoram, a site bordering Bangladesh and K189T mutation with relatively
higher frequency in Mizoram and Tripura states. The presence of F446I mutation in
a region close to the Myanmar border is notable. Considering the spread of
anti-malarial drug resistance from Southeast Asia to the Northeast region of
India in the past, there is an urgent need to undertake systematic mapping
studies to ascertain the role and extent of this mutation in artemisinin
resistance in this region of country.
