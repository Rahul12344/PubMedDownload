OBJECTIVE: Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is widely used as intermittent
preventive treatment (IPT) for malaria in pregnant women in Sub-Saharan Africa.
There are reports of wide-spread SP resistance in countries where SP had once
been used as a first-line treatment. It is unclear whether the development of SP 
resistance also affects countries where SP is mainly used in the context of IPT, 
as is the case in Burkina Faso. To assess the efficacy of SP-based IPT, we
monitored the prevalence of SP conferring genetic mutations in the genes dhfr and
dhps in Plasmodium falciparum populations in a rural area of Burkina Faso over a 
period of 13 years.
METHODS: Molecular epidemiological study consisted of six consecutive
cross-sectional surveys of rainy and dry seasons (2009-2012). Data from the rainy
season in 2000 served as a baseline. Mutations in dhfr and dhps associated with
SP resistance were analysed by pyrosequencing in 861 parasite-positive samples.
RESULTS: The prevalence of the SP resistance conferring triple dhfr mutation 51I,
59R, 108N increased from 1.3% in the rainy season of 2000 to 35.3% in 2009, and
54.3% in 2011 (P ≤ 0.001). Comparing rainy and dry seasons, we observed an
increasing step-like pattern with higher prevalence of the dhfr triple mutant in 
the respective dry season compared with the preceding rainy season. The
proportion of the dhps 437Gly mutation in the rainy season of 2000 was 53.2% and 
subsequently increased to 77.6% in 2009 (P ≤ 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The increase in molecular markers linked with SP resistance
jeopardises the efficacy of IPTp and the planned IPTi interventions in Burkina
Faso, calling for careful monitoring of genotypic resistance markers and in vivo 
validation of IPT efficacy.
