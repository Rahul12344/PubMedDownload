Baculovirus (BV), an enveloped insect virus with a circular dsDNA genome,
possesses unique characteristics that induce strong innate immune responses in
mammalian cells. In this study, we show that BV administration in BALB/c mice not
only provides complete protection against a subsequent Plasmodium berghei
sporozoite infection for up to 7 d after the injection but also eliminates
existing liver-stage parasites completely. The elimination of sporozoites by BV
was superior to that by primaquine, and this effect occurred in a
TLR9-independent manner. At 6 h after BV administration, IFN-α and IFN-γ were
robustly produced in the serum, and RNA transcripts of IFN-stimulated genes were 
markedly upregulated in the liver compared with control mice. The in vivo passive
transfer of serum after BV administration effectively eliminated liver-stage
parasites, and IFN-α neutralization abolished this effect, indicating that the BV
liver-stage parasite-killing mechanism is downstream of the type I IFN signaling 
pathway. These findings provide evidence that BV-induced, fast-acting innate
immunity completely kills liver-stage parasites and, thus, may lead to new
malaria drug and vaccine strategies.
