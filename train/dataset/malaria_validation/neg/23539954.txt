Trafficking of the rhoptry chimeric protein RhopH2-GFP, which contains RhopH2
signal peptide plus the downstream five amino acids, was dissected by treating
parasites with Brefeldin A at three different time points. Twenty eight hrs-stage
trophozoites accumulated the chimera within the parasite endoplasmic reticulum.
In 32 hrs-stage schizonts, the chimera was distributed in the parasite cytoplasm 
but not in the parasitophorous vacuole. In 36 hrs stage-schizonts, the chimera
was detected in individual structures around the developing merozoites and, in
contrary to non-treated parasites, no immature rhoptry vesicles could be detected
in the cytoplasm of immature merozoites. These data show that this chimera is
trafficked to the rhoptries via Brefeldin A-sensitive pathway indicating that
this trafficking is similar to that of the endogenous rhoptry proteins, and that 
the five amino acids downstream of the signal peptide cleavage site may contain
the sorting signal required for rhoptry targeting.
