ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Species of Aspidosperma are known popularly as
"peroba, guatambu, carapanaúba, pau-pereiro" and "quina". The genus can be found 
in the Americas, mainly between Mexico and Argentina. Many species of
Aspidosperma are used by the population in treating cardiovascular diseases,
malaria, fever, diabetes and rheumatism. The phytochemical aspects of the species
of the genus Aspidosperma have been studied extensively. The monoterpene indole
alkaloids are the main secondary metabolites in Aspidosperma species, and about
250 of them have been isolated showing a considerable structural diversity.
Several of them have showed some important pharmacological activities.
Aspidosperma subincanum Mart. and Aspidosperma tomentosum Mart. (Apocynaceae) are
Brazilian species widely used by the population to treat diabetes mellitus,
hypercholesterolemia. The pharmacological activities of both species have been
investigated and the biological properties described can be related to their
isolated indole alkaloids. However, more pharmacological studies are needed in
order to justify the use of these species in folk medicine. In this review, we
present reports mainly focused on chemical and biological studies and their
relationship with the ethnopharmacological use of both Aspidosperma species.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this review is to present their ethnopharmacological
use as correlated to their biological activities as described for the extracts
and isolated compounds from Aspidosperma subincanum Mart. and Aspidosperma
tomentosum Mart. In addition, some aspects related to the biosynthetic pathways
are discussed, also NMR assignments and some synthesis information about indole
alkaloids from both Aspidosperma species are included.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The bibliographic search was made in theses and
dissertations using some databases such as NDLTD (Networked Digital Library of
Theses and Dissertations), OATD (Open Access Theses and Dissertations) and Google
Scholar. More data were gathered from books, Brazilian journals and articles
available on electronic databases such as, Google Scholar, PubChem, Scifinder,
Web of Science, SciELO, PubMed and Science Direct. Additionally, the Google
Patents and Espacenet Patent Search (EPO) were also consulted. The keywords
Aspidosperma, A. subincanum, A. tomentosum, indole alkaloids were used in the
research. The languages were restricted to Portuguese, English and Spanish and
references were selected according to their relevance.
RESULTS: A. subincanum Mart. and A. tomentosum Mart. (Apocynaceae) are Brazilian 
species widely used by the population to treat a few diseases. Extracts and
isolated compounds of both species have shown antitumor and antimalarial
activities. The antitumor activity of isolated compounds has been extensively
studied. However, the antiplasmodial activity needs to be investigated further as
well as the anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperlipidemic and anorexigenic activities.
From A. subincanum twenty-one indole alkaloids were isolated and some of them
have been extensively studied. From the leaves and bark of A. tomentosum four
alkaloids and one flavonoid were isolated. Furthermore, CG-MS analysis of seeds, 
branches, leaves and arils identified nine indole alkaloids. Stemmadenine has
been proposed as a precursor of indole alkaloids obtained from some species of
Aspidosperma. Many of the biosynthetic steps have been characterized at the
enzymatic level and appropriate genes have been identified, however, other steps 
have yet to be investigated and they are still controversial. Some isolated
alkaloids from A. subincanum and A. tomentosum were identified only by mass
spectrometry. In many cases, their NMR data was either not available or was
incomplete. The described meta-analysis of the available NMR data revealed that
the chemical shifts belonging to the indole ring might be used to characterize
this class of alkaloids within complex matrices such as plant extracts. The
biological activities and the structural complexity of these compounds have
stimulated the interest of many groups into their synthesis. In this review, some
information about the synthesis of indole alkaloids and their derivatives was
presented.
CONCLUSIONS: A. subincanum and A. tomentosum are used by the population of Brazil
to treat many diseases. A few biological activities described for the extracts
and isolated compounds of both species are in agreement with the
ethnopharmacological use for others species of Aspidosperma, such as,
antimalarial, the treatment of diabetes and other illnesses. These species are
sources of leading compounds which can be used for developing new drugs. In
addition, other biological activities reported and suggested by
ethnopharmacological data have yet to be investigated and could be an interesting
area in the search for new bioactive compounds.
