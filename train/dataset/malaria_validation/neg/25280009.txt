The apicomplexan intraerythrocytic parasite Babesia microti is an emerging human 
pathogen and the primary cause of human babesiosis, a malaria-like illness
endemic in the United States. The pathogen is transmitted to humans by the tick
vector, Ixodes scapularis, and by transfusion of blood from asymptomatic B.
microti-infected donors. Whereas the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of this
parasite have been sequenced, assembled and annotated, its apicoplast genome
remained incomplete, mainly due to its low representation and high A+T content.
Here we report the complete sequence and annotation of the apicoplast genome of
the B. microti R1 isolate. The genome consists of a 28.7 kb circular molecule
encoding primarily functions important for maintenance of the apicoplast DNA,
transcription, translation and maturation of organellar proteins. Genome analysis
and annotation revealed a unique gene structure and organization of the B.
microti apicoplast genome and suggest that all metabolic and non-housekeeping
functions in this organelle are nuclear-encoded. B. microti apicoplast functions 
are significantly different from those of the host, suggesting that they might be
useful as targets for development of potent and safe therapies for the treatment 
of human babesiosis.
