Infection of mice with strains of Plasmodium yoelii parasites can result in
different pathology, but molecular mechanisms to explain this variation are
unclear. Here we show that a P. yoelii gene encoding a HECT-like E3 ubiquitin
ligase (Pyheul) influences parasitemia and host mortality. We genetically cross
two lethal parasites with distinct disease phenotypes, and identify 43
genetically diverse progeny by typing with microsatellites and 9230
single-nucleotide polymorphisms. A genome-wide quantitative trait loci scan links
parasite growth and host mortality to two major loci on chromosomes 1 and 7 with 
LOD (logarithm of ﻿the odds) scores = 6.1 and 8.1, respectively. Allelic exchange
of partial sequences of Pyheul in the chromosome 7 locus and modification of the 
gene expression alter parasite growth and host mortality. This study identifies a
gene that may have a function in parasite growth, virulence, and host-parasite
interaction, and therefore could be a target for drug or vaccine development.Many
strains of Plasmodium differ in virulence, but factors that control these
distinctions are not known. Here the authors comparatively map virulence loci
using the offspring from a P. yoelii YM and N67 genetic cross, and identify a
putative HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase that may explain the variance.
