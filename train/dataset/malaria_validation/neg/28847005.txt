In two previously described donors, the extracellular domain of LAIR1, a
collagen-binding inhibitory receptor encoded on chromosome 19 (ref. 1), was
inserted between the V and DJ segments of an antibody. This insertion generated, 
through somatic mutations, broadly reactive antibodies against RIFINs, a type of 
variant antigen expressed on the surface of Plasmodium falciparum-infected
erythrocytes. To investigate how frequently such antibodies are produced in
response to malaria infection, we screened plasma from two large cohorts of
individuals living in malaria-endemic regions. Here we report that 5-10% of
malaria-exposed individuals, but none of the European blood donors tested, have
high levels of LAIR1-containing antibodies that dominate the response to infected
erythrocytes without conferring enhanced protection against febrile malaria. By
analysing the antibody-producing B cell clones at the protein, cDNA and gDNA
levels, we characterized additional LAIR1 insertions between the V and DJ
segments and discovered a second insertion modality whereby the LAIR1 exon
encoding the extracellular domain and flanking intronic sequences are inserted
into the switch region. By exon shuffling, this mechanism leads to the production
of bispecific antibodies in which the LAIR1 domain is precisely positioned at the
elbow between the VH and CH1 domains. Additionally, in one donor the genomic DNA 
encoding the VH and CH1 domains was deleted, leading to the production of a
camel-like LAIR1-containing antibody. Sequencing of the switch regions of memory 
B cells from European blood donors revealed frequent templated inserts
originating from transcribed genes that, in rare cases, comprised exons with
orientations and frames compatible with expression. These results reveal
different modalities of LAIR1 insertion that lead to public and dominant
antibodies against infected erythrocytes and suggest that insertion of templated 
DNA represents an additional mechanism of antibody diversification that can be
selected in the immune response against pathogens and exploited for B cell
engineering.
