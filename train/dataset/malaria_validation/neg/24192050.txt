Anopheles moucheti Evans (Diptera: Culicidae) is a major vector of malaria in
forested areas of Central Africa. However, few genetic tools are available for
this species. The present study represents the first attempt to characterize
chromosomes in An. moucheti females collected in Cameroon. Ovarian nurse cells
contained polytene chromosomes, which were suitable for standard cytogenetic
applications. The presence of three polymorphic chromosomal inversions in An.
moucheti was revealed. Two of these inversions were located on the 2R chromosome 
arm. The homology between the 2R chromosome arms of An. moucheti and Anopheles
gambiae Giles was established by fluorescent in situ hybridization of six An.
gambiae genic sequences. Mapping of the probes on chromosomes of An. moucheti
detected substantial gene order reshuffling between the two species. The presence
of polytene chromosomes and polymorphic inversions in An. moucheti provides a new
basis for further population genetic, taxonomic and ecological studies of this
neglected malaria vector.
