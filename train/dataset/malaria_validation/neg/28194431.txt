Pathogen-specific polyfunctional T cell responses have been associated with
favorable clinical outcomes, but it is not known whether molecular differences
exist between polyfunctional and monofunctional cytokine-producing T cells. Here,
we report that polyfunctional CD4+ T cells induced during Plasmodiumfalciparum
(P. falciparum) blood-stage infection in humans have a unique transcriptomic
profile compared with IFN-γ monofunctional CD4+ T cells and, thus, are
molecularly distinct. The 14-gene signature revealed in P. falciparum-reactive
polyfunctional T cells is associated with cytokine signaling and lymphocyte
chemotaxis, and systems biology analysis identified IL-27 as an upstream
regulator of the polyfunctional gene signature. Importantly, the polyfunctional
gene signature is largely conserved in Influenza-reactive polyfunctional CD4+ T
cells, suggesting that polyfunctional T cells have core characteristics
independent of pathogen specificity. This study provides the first evidence to
our knowledge that consistent molecular differences exist between polyfunctional 
and monofunctional CD4+ T cells.
