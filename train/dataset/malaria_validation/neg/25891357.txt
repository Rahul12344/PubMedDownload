The differentiation and protective capacity of Plasmodium-specific T cells are
regulated by both positive and negative signals during malaria, but the molecular
and cellular details remain poorly defined. Here we show that malaria patients
and Plasmodium-infected rodents exhibit atypical expression of the co-stimulatory
receptor OX40 on CD4 T cells and that therapeutic enhancement of OX40 signaling
enhances helper CD4 T cell activity, humoral immunity, and parasite clearance in 
rodents. However, these beneficial effects of OX40 signaling are abrogated
following coordinate blockade of PD-1 co-inhibitory pathways, which are also
upregulated during malaria and associated with elevated parasitemia.
Co-administration of biologics blocking PD-1 and promoting OX40 signaling induces
excessive interferon-gamma that directly limits helper T cell-mediated support of
humoral immunity and decreases parasite control. Our results show that targeting 
OX40 can enhance Plasmodium control and that crosstalk between co-inhibitory and 
co-stimulatory pathways in pathogen-specific CD4 T cells can impact pathogen
clearance.
