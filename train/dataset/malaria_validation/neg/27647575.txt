Faced with intense levels of chloroquine (CQ) resistance in Plasmodium falciparum
malaria, Rwanda replaced CQ with amodiaquine (AQ)+sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) 
in 2001, and subsequently with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in 2006, as
first-line treatments for uncomplicated malaria. Following years of
discontinuation of CQ use, re-emergence of CQ-susceptible parasites has been
reported in countries including Malawi, Kenya and Tanzania. In contrast, high
levels of SP resistant mutant parasites continue to be reported even in countries
of presumed reduced SP drug selection pressure. The prevalence and distributions 
of genetic polymorphisms linked with CQ and SP resistance at two sites of
different malaria transmission intensities are described here to better
understand drug-related genomic adaptations over time and exposure to varying
drug pressures in Rwanda. Using filter paper blood isolates collected from P.
falciparum infected patients, DNA was extracted and a nested PCR performed to
identify resistance-mediating polymorphisms in the pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhps and
pfdhfr genes. Amplicons from a total of 399 genotyped samples were analysed by
ligase detection reaction fluorescent microsphere assay. CQ susceptible pfcrt 76K
and pfmdr1 86N wild-type parasites were found in about 50% and 81% of isolates,
respectively. Concurrently, SP susceptible pfdhps double (437G-540E), pfdhfr
triple (108N-51I-59R), quintuple pfdhps 437G-540E/pfdhfr 51I-59R-108N and
sextuple haplotypes were found in about 84%, 85%, 74% and 18% of isolates,
respectively. High-level SP resistance associated pfdhfr 164L and pfdhps 581G
mutant prevalences were noted to decline. Mutations pfcrt 76T, pfdhfr 59R and
pfdhfr 164L were found differentially distributed between the two study sites
with the pfdhfr 164L mutants found only at Ruhuha site, eastern Rwanda. Overall, 
sustained intense levels of SP resistance mutations and a recovery of CQ
susceptible parasites were found in this study following 7 years and 14 years of 
drug withdrawal from use, respectively. Most likely, the sustained high
prevalence of resistant parasites is due to the use of DHFR/DHPS inhibitors like 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TS) for the treatment of and prophylaxis against
bacterial infections among HIV infected individuals as well as the continued use 
of IPTp-SP within the East and Central African regions for malaria prevention
among pregnant women. With regard to CQ, the slow recovery of CQ susceptible
parasites may have been caused partly by the continued use of CQ and/or CQ
mimicking antimalarial drugs like AQ in spite of policies to withdraw it from
Rwanda and the neighbouring countries of Uganda and Tanzania. Continued
surveillance of P. falciparum CQ and SP associated polymorphisms is recommended
for guiding future rational drug policy-making and mitigation of future risk of
anti-malaria drug resistance development.
