Transcription is a process by which the genetic information stored in DNA is
converted into mRNA by enzymes known as RNA polymerase. Bacteria use only one RNA
polymerase to transcribe all of its genes while eukaryotes contain three RNA
polymerases to transcribe the variety of eukaryotic genes. RNA polymerase also
requires other factors/proteins to produce the transcript. These factors
generally termed as transcription factors (TFs) are either associated directly
with RNA polymerase or add in building the actual transcription apparatus. TFs
are the most common tools that our cells use to control gene expression.
Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for causing the most lethal form of malaria 
in humans. It shows most of its characteristics common to eukaryotic
transcription but it is assumed that mechanisms of transcriptional control in P. 
falciparum somehow differ from those of other eukaryotes. In this article we
describe the studies on the main TFs such as myb protein, high mobility group
protein and ApiA2 family proteins from malaria parasite. These studies show that 
these TFs are slowly emerging to have defined roles in the regulation of gene
expression in the parasite.
