BACKGROUND: The mechanism of action of artemisinins against malaria is unclear,
despite their widespread use in combination therapies and the emergence of
resistance.
RESULTS: Here, we report expression of PfATP6 (a SERCA pump) in yeast and
demonstrate its inhibition by artemisinins. Mutations in PfATP6 identified in
field isolates (such as S769N) and in laboratory clones (such as L263E) decrease 
susceptibility to artemisinins, whereas they increase susceptibility to unrelated
inhibitors such as cyclopiazonic acid. As predicted from the yeast model,
Plasmodium falciparum with the L263E mutation is also more susceptible to
cyclopiazonic acid. An inability to knockout parasite SERCA pumps provides
genetic evidence that they are essential in asexual stages of development.
Thaperoxides are a new class of potent antimalarial designed to act by inhibiting
PfATP6. Results in yeast confirm this inhibition.
CONCLUSIONS: The identification of inhibitors effective against mutated PfATP6
suggests ways in which artemisinin resistance may be overcome.
