Linkage studies have revealed a linkage of mild malaria to chromosome 6p21 that
contains the NCR3 gene encoding a natural killer cell receptor, whereas
NCR3-412G>C (rs2736191) located in its promoter region was found to be associated
with malaria in Burkina Faso. Here we confirmed the association of rs2736191 with
mild malaria in a Congolese cohort and investigated its potential cis-regulatory 
effect. Luciferase assay results indicated that rs2736191-G allele had a
significantly increased promoter activity compared to rs2736191-C allele.
Furthermore, EMSAs demonstrated an altered binding of two nuclear protein
complexes to the rs2736191-C allele in comparison to rs2736191-G allele. Finally,
after in silico identification of transcription factor candidates, pull-down
western blot experiments confirmed that both STAT4 and RUNX3 bind the region
encompassing rs2736191 with a higher affinity for the G allele. To our knowledge,
this is the first report that explored the functional role of rs2736191. These
results support the hypothesis that genetic variation within natural killer cell 
receptors alters malaria resistance in humans.
