BACKGROUND: Elimination of malaria depends on mastering transmission and
understanding the biological basis of Plasmodium infection in the vector. The
first mosquito organ to interact with the parasite is the midgut and its
transcriptomic characterization during infection can reveal effective
antiplasmodial responses able to limit the survival of the parasite. The vector
response to Plasmodium vivax is not fully characterized, and its specificities
when compared with other malaria parasites can be of fundamental interest for
specific control measures.
METHODS: Experimental infections were performed using a membrane-feeding device. 
Three groups were used: P. vivax-blood-fed, blood-fed on inactivated gametocytes,
and unfed mosquitoes. Twenty-four hours after feeding, the mosquitoes were
dissected and the midgut collected for transcriptomic analysis using RNAseq. Nine
cDNA libraries were generated and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500. Readings
were checked for quality control and analysed using the Trinity platform for de
novo transcriptome assembly. Transcript quantification was performed and the
transcriptome was functionally annotated. Differential expression gene analysis
was carried out. The role of the identified mechanisms was further explored using
functional approaches.
RESULTS: Forty-nine genes were identified as being differentially expressed with 
P. vivax infection: 34 were upregulated and 15 were downregulated. Half of the P.
vivax-related differentially expressed genes could be related to autophagy;
therefore, the effect of the known inhibitor (wortmannin) and activator
(spermidine) was tested on the infection outcome. Autophagic activation
significantly reduced the intensity and prevalence of infection. This was
associated with transcription alterations of the autophagy regulating genes
Beclin, DRAM and Apg8.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that P. vivax invasion of An. aquasalis midgut
epithelium triggers an autophagic response and its activation reduces infection. 
This suggests a novel mechanism that mosquitoes can use to fight Plasmodium
infection.
