BACKGROUND: The Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine transporter gene (pfcrt) is
known to be involved in chloroquine and amodiaquine resistance, and more
particularly the mutations on the loci 72 to 76 localized within the second exon.
Additionally, new mutations (T93S, H97Y, C101F, F145I, M343L, C350R and G353V)
were recently shown to be associated with in vitro reduced susceptibility to
piperaquine in Asian or South American P. falciparum strains. However, very few
data are available on the prevalence of these mutations and their effect on
parasite susceptibility to anti-malarial drugs, and more particularly piperaquine
in Africa.
METHODS: A molecular investigation of these mutations was performed in 602
African P. falciparum parasites collected between 2017 and 2018 on malaria
patients hospitalized in France after a travel in African countries. Associations
between genotypes and in vitro susceptibilities to piperaquine and standard
antimalarial drugs were assessed.
RESULTS: None of the mutations, previously described as associated with
piperaquine resistance, was found in the 602 P. falciparum African isolates. The 
K76T mutation is associated with resistance to chloroquine (p < 0.0002) and
desethylamodiaquine (p < 0.002) in Africa. The K76T mutation is not associated
with in vitro reduced susceptibility to piperaquine. The mutation I356T,
identified in 54.7% (n = 326) of the African isolates, was significantly
associated with reduced susceptibility to quinine (p < 0.02) and increased
susceptibility to mefloquine (p < 0.04). The K76T and I356T mutations were
significantly associated in West African isolates (p = 0.008).
CONCLUSION: None of the mutations in pfcrt found to be associated with
piperaquine reduced susceptibility in Asia or South America (T93S, H97Y, C101F,
F145I, M343L C350R and G353V) were found in the 602 African isolates including
the three isolates with reduced susceptibility to piperaquine. The K76T mutation,
involved in resistance to chloroquine and amodiaquine, and the I356T mutation
were not associated with in vitro reduced susceptibility to piperaquine.
Differences in mefloquine susceptibility between I356 and 356T isolates were,
while statistically different, minimal. Further analyses are needed with a more
important sample size from the same geographic area to confirm the role of the
I356T mutation on quinine susceptibility.
