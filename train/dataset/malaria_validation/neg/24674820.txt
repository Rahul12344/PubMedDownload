BACKGROUND: Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is an essential nutrient for all organisms. 
The route of Pi utilization begins with Pi transport across the plasma membrane.
SCOPE OF REVIEW: Here, we analyzed the gene sequences and compared the
biochemical profiles, including kinetic and modulator parameters, of Pi
transporters in unicellular eukaryotes. The objective of this review is to
evaluate the recent findings regarding Pi uptake mechanisms in microorganisms,
such as the fungi Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the parasite
protozoans Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma rangeli, Leishmania infantum and
Plasmodium falciparum.
MAJOR CONCLUSION: Pi uptake is the key step of Pi homeostasis and in the
subsequent signaling event in eukaryotic microorganisms.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Biochemical and structural studies are important for
clarifying mechanisms of Pi homeostasis, as well as Pi sensor and downstream
pathways, and raise possibilities for future studies in this field.
