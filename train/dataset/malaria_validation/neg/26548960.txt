Accurate gene models are essential for understanding parasite biology. However,
transcript structure information is lacking for most parasite genes. Here, we
describe "Virtual Northern" analysis of the malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum to address this issue. RNA-seq libraries were made from
size-fractionated RNA. Transcript sizes for 3052 genes were inferred from the
read counts in each library. The data show that for almost half of the
transcripts, the combined untranslated regions are more than twice the length of 
the open reading frame. Furthermore, we identified novel polycistronic, or gene
overlapping, transcripts that suggest revisions to current gene models are
needed.
