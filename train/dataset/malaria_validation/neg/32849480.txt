Plasmodium vivax is increasingly the dominant species of malaria in the Greater
Mekong Subregion (GMS), which is pursuing regional malaria elimination. P. vivax 
lineages in the GMS are poorly characterized. Currently, P. vivax reference
genomes are scarce due to difficulties in culturing the parasite and lack of
high-quality samples. In addition, P. vivax is incredibly diverse, necessitating 
the procurement of reference genomes from different geographical regions. Here we
present four new P. vivax draft genomes assembled de novo from clinical samples
collected in the China-Myanmar border area. We demonstrate comparable length and 
content to existing genomes, with the majority of structural variation occurring 
around subtelomeric regions and exported proteins, which we corroborated with
detection of copy number variations in these regions. We predicted peptides from 
all PIR gene subfamilies, except for PIR D. We confirmed that proteins
classically labeled as PIR D family members are not identifiable by PIR motifs,
and actually bear stronger resemblance to DUF (domain of unknown function) family
DUF3671, potentially pointing to a new, closely related gene family. Further,
phylogenetic analyses of MSP7 genes showed high variability within the MSP7-B
family compared to MSP7-A and -C families, and the result was comparable to that 
from whole genome analyses. The new genome assemblies serve as a resource for
studying P. vivax within the GMS.
