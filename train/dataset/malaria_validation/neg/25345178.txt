This paper reports one case of atypical falciparum malaria imported from Africa, 
whose blood smear contains many large trophozoites, with punctiform or massive
brown pigment granules, the body shape of the plasmodium is similar to that of
Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale. After the gene detection by PCR, the case 
was diagnosed as falciparum malaria. As large trophozoites were rarely seen in
the peripheral blood of non-severe falciparum malaria cases, much attention
should be paid to the identification of Plasmodium falciparum and other plasmodia
in microscopic examinations.
