BACKGROUND: Malaria is one of the most serious vector-borne diseases in the
world. Vector control is an important measure for malaria prevention and
elimination. However, this strategy is under threat as disease vectors are
developing resistance to insecticides. Therefore, it is important to monitor
mechanisms responsible for insecticide resistance. In this study, the presence of
G119S mutation in the acetyl cholinesterase-encoding gene (ace-1) was
investigated in nine Anopheles sinensis populations sampled across Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region China.
METHODS: PCR-RFLP (polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length
polymorphism) method was used to genotype each individual adult of An. sinensis. 
Direct sequencing of PCR products was performed to verify the accuracy of
PCR-RFLP genotyping result. Population genetics analysis was conducted using
Genepop programme.
RESULTS: The frequencies of susceptible homozygotes, heterozygotes and resistant 
homozygotes in the nine populations ranged between 0-0.296, 0.143-0.500 and
0.333-0.857, respectively. Overall, a high frequency (0.519-0.929) of mutant 119S
allele was observed and the genotype frequency of the ace-1 gene of An. sinensis 
was at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in each of the nine examined populations.
CONCLUSION: The G119S mutation has become fixed and is widespread in An. sinensis
field populations in Guangxi, China. These findings are useful in helping design 
strategies for An. sinensis control.
