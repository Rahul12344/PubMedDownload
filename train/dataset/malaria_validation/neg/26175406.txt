The eukaryotic phylum Apicomplexa encompasses thousands of obligate intracellular
parasites of humans and animals with immense socio-economic and health impacts.
We sequenced nuclear genomes of Chromera velia and Vitrella brassicaformis,
free-living non-parasitic photosynthetic algae closely related to apicomplexans. 
Proteins from key metabolic pathways and from the endomembrane trafficking
systems associated with a free-living lifestyle have been progressively and
non-randomly lost during adaptation to parasitism. The free-living ancestor
contained a broad repertoire of genes many of which were repurposed for parasitic
processes, such as extracellular proteins, components of a motility apparatus,
and DNA- and RNA-binding protein families. Based on transcriptome analyses across
36 environmental conditions, Chromera orthologs of apicomplexan invasion-related 
motility genes were co-regulated with genes encoding the flagellar apparatus,
supporting the functional contribution of flagella to the evolution of invasion
machinery. This study provides insights into how obligate parasites with diverse 
life strategies arose from a once free-living phototrophic marine alga.
