Tick galactosyltransferases are involved in α-Gal synthesis and play a role
during Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection and Ixodes scapularis tick vector
development.

The carbohydrate Galα1-3Galβ1-(3)4GlcNAc-R (α-Gal) is produced in all mammals
except for humans, apes and old world monkeys that lost the ability to synthetize
this carbohydrate. Therefore, humans can produce high antibody titers against
α-Gal. Anti-α-Gal IgE antibodies have been associated with tick-induced allergy
(i.e. α-Gal syndrome) and anti-α-Gal IgG/IgM antibodies may be involved in
protection against malaria, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. The α-Gal on tick
salivary proteins plays an important role in the etiology of the α-Gal syndrome. 
However, whether ticks are able to produce endogenous α-Gal remains currently
unknown. In this study, the Ixodes scapularis genome was searched for
galactosyltransferases and three genes were identified as potentially involved in
the synthesis of α-Gal. Heterologous gene expression in α-Gal-negative cells and 
gene knockdown in ticks confirmed that these genes were involved in α-Gal
synthesis and are essential for tick feeding. Furthermore, these genes were shown
to play an important role in tick-pathogen interactions. Results suggested that
tick cells increased α-Gal levels in response to Anaplasma phagocytophilum
infection to control bacterial infection. These results provided the molecular
basis of endogenous α-Gal production in ticks and suggested that tick
galactosyltransferases are involved in vector development, tick-pathogen
interactions and possibly the etiology of α-Gal syndrome in humans.
