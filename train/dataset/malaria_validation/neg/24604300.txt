The morphogenesis of plasmodium in Didymium megalosporum was observed for the
first time by hanging drop culture and 3 % oat-agar culture under controlled
conditions. The development of plasmodium was characteristic formation process of
phaneroplasmodium. The mature plasmodium was white yellow or yellow green in
color, and had an extending fan-like sheet at the front, followed by a network of
veins. It could be easy to fuse into a bigger plasmodium during the formation and
die at high temperature or starvation. In view of the important role of
alpha-tubulin during the morphogenesis of plasmodium, we sequenced partial
sequence of alpha-tubulin gene, a total length of 1,159 bp, in this plasmodium.
It had an intron area from 177 to 235 bp, and the exon area had a similarity of
91 % relative to altA locus of alpha-tubulin gene in Physarum polycephalum, the
translated amino acid sequence was identical (100 % match) between the two.
