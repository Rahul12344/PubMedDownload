Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is the first-line treatment for uncomplicated
Plasmodium falciparum infection in Colombia. To assess AL efficacy for
uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Quibdo, Choco, Colombia, we conducted a
28-day therapeutic efficacy study (TES) following the WHO guidelines. From July
2018 to February 2019, febrile patients aged 5-65 years with microscopy-confirmed
P. falciparum mono-infection and asexual parasite density of 250-100,000
parasites/µL were enrolled and treated with a supervised 3-day course of AL. The 
primary endpoint was adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) on day
28. We attempted to use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genotyping to
differentiate reinfection and recrudescence, and conducted genetic testing for
antimalarial resistance-associated genes. Eighty-eight patients consented and
were enrolled; four were lost to follow-up or missed treatment doses. Therefore, 
84 (95.5%) participants reached a valid endpoint: treatment failure or ACPR. No
patient remained microscopy positive for malaria on day 3, evidence of delayed
parasite clearance and artemisinin resistance. One patient had recurrent
infection (12 parasites/µL) on day 28. Uncorrected ACPR rate was 98.8% (83/84)
(95% CI: 93.5-100%). The recurrent infection sample did not amplify during
molecular testing, giving a PCR-corrected ACPR of 100% (83/83) (95% CI:
95.7-100%). No P. falciparum kelch 13 polymorphisms associated with artemisinin
resistance were identified. Our results support high AL efficacy for falciparum
malaria in Choco. Because of the time required to conduct TESs in low-endemic
settings, it is important to consider complementary alternatives to monitor
antimalarial efficacy and resistance.
