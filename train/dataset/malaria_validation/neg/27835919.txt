The cAMP-dependent protein kinase PKA is a well-characterized member of the
serine-threonine protein AGC kinase family and is the effector kinase of cAMP
signaling. As such, PKA is involved in the control of a wide variety of cellular 
processes including metabolism, cell growth, gene expression and apoptosis.
cAMP-dependent PKA signaling pathways play important roles during infection and
virulence of various pathogens. Since fluxes in cAMP are involved in multiple
intracellular functions, a variety of different pathological infectious processes
can be affected by PKA signaling pathways. Here, we highlight some features of
cAMP-PKA signaling that are relevant to Plasmodium falciparum-infection of
erythrocytes and present an update on AKAP targeting of PKA in PGE2 signaling via
EP4 in Theileria annulata-infection of leukocytes and discuss cAMP-PKA signling
in Toxoplasma.
