The transformation of malaria ookinetes into oocysts occurs in the mosquito
midgut and is a major bottleneck for parasite transmission. The secreted ookinete
surface protein, circumsporozoite- and thrombospondin-related adhesive protein
(TRAP)-related protein (CTRP), is essential for this transition and hence
constitutes a potential target for malaria transmission blockade. CTRP is a
modular multidomain protein containing six tandem von Willebrand factor A-like
(A) domains and seven tandem thrombospondin type I repeat-like (TS) domains. Here
we present, to our knowledge, the first structure-function analysis of CTRP using
genetically modified Plasmodium berghei parasites expressing mutant versions of
the ctrp gene. Our data show that the A domains of CTRP are critical for ookinete
gliding motility and oocyst formation whilst, unexpectedly, its TS domains are
fully redundant. These results may have important implications for the design of 
CTRP-based transmission blocking strategies.
