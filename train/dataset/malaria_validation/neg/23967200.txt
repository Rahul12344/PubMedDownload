BACKGROUND: We have previously reported that free Heme generated during
experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) in mice, is central to the pathogenesis of
fatal ECM. Heme-induced up-regulation of STAT3 and CXCL10 promotes whereas
up-regulation of HO-1 prevents brain tissue damage in ECM. We have previously
demonstrated that Heme is involved in the induction of apoptosis in vascular
endothelial cells. In the present study, we further tested the hypothesis that
Heme reduces blood-brain barrier integrity during ECM by induction of apoptosis
of brain vascular endothelial cells through STAT3 and its target gene matrix
metalloproteinase three (MMP3) signaling.
METHODS: Genes associated with the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway induced upon
stimulation by Heme treatment, were assessed using real time RT(2) Profile PCR
arrays. A human MMP3 promoter was cloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid,
pMMP3, and its activity was examined following exposure to Heme treatment by a
luciferase reporter gene assay. In order to determine whether activated nuclear
protein STAT3 binds to the MMP3 promoter and regulates MMP3 gene, we conducted a 
ChIP analysis using Heme-treated and untreated human brain microvascular
endothelial cells (HBVEC), and determined mRNA and protein expression levels of
MMP3 using qRT-PCR and Western blot. Apoptosis in HBVEC treated with Heme was
evaluated by MTT and TUNEL assay.
RESULTS: The results show that (1) Heme activates a variety of JAK/STAT3
downstream pathways in HBVEC. STAT3 targeted genes such as MMP3 and C/EBPb
(Apoptosis-related genes), are up regulated in HBVEC treated with Heme. (2)
Heme-induced HBVEC apoptosis via activation of STAT3 as well as its downstream
signaling molecule MMP3 and upregulation of CXCL10 and HO-1 expressions. (3)
Phosphorylated STAT3 binds to the MMP3 promoter in HBVEC cells, STAT3 transcribed
MMP3 and induced MMP3 protein expression in HBVEC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Activated STAT3 binds to the MMP3 promoter region and regulates MMP3
in Heme-induced endothelial cell apoptosis.
