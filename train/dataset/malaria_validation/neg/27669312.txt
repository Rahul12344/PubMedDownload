The persistence of transgenes in the environment is a consideration in risk
assessments of transgenic organisms. Combining mathematical models that predict
the frequency of transgenes and experimental demonstrations can validate the
model predictions, or can detect significant biological deviations that were
neither apparent nor included as model parameters. In order to assess the
correlation between predictions and observations, models were constructed to
estimate the frequency of a transgene causing male sexual sterility in simulated 
populations of a malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae that were seeded with
transgenic females at various proportions. Concurrently, overlapping-generation
laboratory populations similar to those being modeled were initialized with
various starting transgene proportions, and the subsequent proportions of
transgenic individuals in populations were determined weekly until the transgene 
disappeared. The specific transgene being tested contained a homing endonuclease 
gene expressed in testes, I-PpoI, that cleaves the ribosomal DNA and results in
complete male sexual sterility with no effect on female fertility. The transgene 
was observed to disappear more rapidly than the model predicted in all cases. The
period before ovipositions that contained no transgenic progeny ranged from as
little as three weeks after cage initiation to as long as 11 weeks.
