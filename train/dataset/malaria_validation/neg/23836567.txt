Plasmodium ovale is one of several clinically relevant malaria species known to
cause disease in humans. However, in contrast to Plasmodium falciparum and
Plasmodium vivax, which are responsible for most cases of human malaria, P. ovale
has a wide distribution but low prevalence in tropical regions. Here, we report
the case of a soldier returning from Liberia with P. ovale wallikeri malaria.
This case highlights the limitations of both microscopy and the malaria rapid
diagnostic test for diagnosing infection with P. ovale and for distinguishing P. 
ovale wallikeri from P. ovale curtisi. To our knowledge, this is the first case
report in which quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction amplification
using the Cytochrome B gene, coupled with genomic sequencing of the potra locus, 
was used for definitive diagnosis of P. ovale wallikeri malaria.
