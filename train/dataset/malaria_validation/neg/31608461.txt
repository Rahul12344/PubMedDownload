A century of conceptual and technological advances in infectious disease research
has changed the face of medicine. However, there remains a lack of effective
interventions and a poor understanding of host immunity to the most significant
and complex pathogens, including malaria. The development of successful
interventions against such intractable diseases requires a comprehensive
understanding of host-pathogen immune responses. A major advance of the past
decade has been a paradigm switch in thinking from the contemporary reductionist 
(gene-by-gene or protein-by-protein) view to a more holistic (whole organism)
view. Also, a recognition that host-pathogen immunity is composed of complex,
dynamic interactions of cellular and molecular components and networks that
cannot be represented by any individual component in isolation. Systems
immunology integrates the field of immunology with omics technologies and
computational sciences to comprehensively interrogate the immune response at a
systems level. Herein, we describe the system immunology toolkit and report
recent studies deploying systems-level approaches in the context of natural
exposure to malaria or controlled human malaria infection. We contribute our
perspective on the potential of systems immunity for the rational design and
development of effective interventions to improve global public health.
