Since PvTARAg55 protein (PvTARAg55) of Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) is expressed
during the parasite's sporozoite stage, it was strongly suggested, as a potential
candidate for the development of a vaccine against malaria. PvTARAg55
polymorphisms were examined among isolates from various locations in Asian
countries mainly; thus the current study could set the valuable baseline data for
the development of a vaccine and clinical trials. A total of 59 samples were
collected from Asian countries and one isolate from Africa. PvTARAg55 gene from
59 isolates was amplified, sequenced, and analyzed. PvTARAg55 contained a highly 
conserved tryptophan-rich domain (TRD) and a variable alanine-rich domain (ARD). 
In comparison to the Sal-1 strain, 10 allelic types of PvTARAg55 were found among
59 isolates. The main observed variations were the insertions and deletions of
repeated sequences in the Ala-rich domain. Four types of GGVAAAP repeats were
found at codon 324. Interestingly, GGVAAAP was found to be majority of Sal-1 type
in the world. Two repeats (x2) were found in isolates from Korea, China, and
India. Type of total deletion of GGVAAAP and three repeat (x3) were found from
Indonesia isolates. Furthermore, "second insertion repeats"—with one or two
repeats—were found with AFGAPSGFAPRP amino acid sequences at codon 338. Two
repeats (x2) of AFGAPSGFAPRP were found in Indonesia, and PNG isolates. Finally, 
a "third repeat" was present with TTVNPEA amino acid sequences at codon 429 (the 
Indonesian isolates had three TTVNPEA sequences at that position). Isolates from 
ROK revealed "conserved sequences" in tryptophan-rich domain of PvTARAg55 with
single amino acid substitutions (M180I). Hence, the extensive antigenic diversity
of PvTARAg55 should be taken in account during the vaccine development.
