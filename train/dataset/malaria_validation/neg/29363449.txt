The genetic diversity of glutamate-rich protein (GLURP) R2 region in Plasmodium
falciparum isolates collected before and 12 years after the introduction of
artemisinin combination treatment of malaria in Osogbo, Osun State, Nigeria, was 
compared in this study. Blood samples were collected on filter paper in 2004 and 
2015 from febrile children from ages 1-12 years. The R2 region of the GLURP gene 
was genotyped using nested polymerase chain reaction and by nucleotide
sequencing. In all, 12 GLURP alleles were observed in a total of 199 samples
collected in the two study years. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) marginally 
increased over the two study years; however, the differences were statistically
insignificant (2004 samples MOI = 1.23 versus 2015 samples MOI = 1.47). Some
alleles were stable in their prevalence, whereas two GLURP alleles, VIII and XI, 
showed considerable variability between both years. This variability was
replicated when GLURP sequences from other regions were compared with ours. The
expected heterozygosity (He) values (He = 0.87) were identical for the two
groups. High variability in the rearrangement of the amino acid repeat units in
the R2 region were observed, with the amino acid repeat sequence
DKNEKGQHEIVEVEEILPE more prevalent in both years, compared with the two other
repeat sequences observed in the study. The parasite population characterized in 
this study displayed extensive genetic diversity. The detailed genetic profile of
the GLURP R2 region has the potential to help guide further epidemiological
studies aimed toward the rational design of novel chemotherapies that are
antagonistic toward malaria.
