BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen-1 (PfAMA-1) is a
promising candidate antigen for a blood-stage malaria vaccine. However, antigenic
variation and diversity of PfAMA-1 are still major problems to design a universal
malaria vaccine based on this antigen, especially against domain I (DI). Detail
understanding of the PfAMA-1 gene polymorphism can provide useful information on 
this potential vaccine component. Here, general characteristics of genetic
structure and the effect of natural selection of DIs among Bioko P. falciparum
isolates were analysed.
METHODS: 214 blood samples were collected from Bioko Island patients with P.
falciparum malaria between 2011 and 2017. A fragment spanning DI of PfAMA-1 was
amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Polymorphic
characteristics and the effect of natural selection were analysed using MEGA 5.0,
DnaSP 6.0 and Popart programs. Genetic diversity in 576 global PfAMA-1 DIs were
also analysed. Protein function prediction of new amino acid mutation sites was
performed using PolyPhen-2 program.
RESULTS: 131 different haplotypes of PfAMA-1 were identified in 214 Bioko Island 
P. falciparum isolates. Most amino acid changes identified on Bioko Island were
found in C1L. 32 amino acid changes identified in PfAMA-1 sequences from Bioko
Island were found in predicted RBC-binding sites, B cell epitopes or IUR regions.
Overall patterns of amino acid changes of Bioko PfAMA-1 DIs were similar to those
in global PfAMA-1 isolates. Differential amino acid substitution frequencies were
observed for samples from different geographical regions. Eight new amino acid
changes of Bioko island isolates were also identified and their three-dimensional
protein structural consequences were predicted. Evidence for natural selection
and recombination event were observed in global isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of nucleotide diversity and amino acid polymorphisms of
Bioko Island isolates were similar to those of global PfAMA-1 DIs. Balancing
natural selection across DIs might play a major role in generating genetic
diversity in global isolates. Most amino acid changes in DIs occurred in
predicted B-cell epitopes. Novel sites mapped on a three dimensional structure of
PfAMA-1 showed that these regions were located at the corner. These results may
provide significant value in the design of a malaria vaccine based on this
antigen.
