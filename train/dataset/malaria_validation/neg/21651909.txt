Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) is a major regulator of
calcium-dependent signal transduction, which has been shown to be important in
various processes of the malaria parasite Plasmodium. PI-PLC is generally
implicated in calcium liberation from intracellular stores through the action of 
its product, inositol-(1,4,5)-trisphosphate, and is itself dependent on calcium
for its activation. Here we describe the plc genes from Plasmodium species. The
encoded proteins contain all domains typically found in PI-PLCs of the δ class
but are almost twice as long as their orthologues in mammals. Transcriptional
analysis by qRT-PCR of plc during the erythrocytic cycle of P. falciparum
revealed steady expression levels that increased at the late schizont stages.
Genetic analysis in the P. berghei model revealed that the plc locus was
targetable but that plc gene knock-outs could not be obtained, thereby strongly
indicating that the gene is essential during blood stage development.
Alternatively, we attempted to modify plc expression through a promoter exchange 
approach but found the gene to be refractory to over-expression indicating that
plc expression levels might additionally be tightly controlled.
