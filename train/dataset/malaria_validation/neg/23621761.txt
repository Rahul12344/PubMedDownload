Amplification of the pfmdr1 gene is associated with clinical failures and reduced
in vivo and in vitro sensitivity to both mefloquine and artemether-lumefantrine
in South-East Asia. Several African countries have reported the absence or very
low prevalence of increased copy number, whilst South American reports are
limited to Peru without and Venezuela with increased pfmdr1 multiplication. The
relative pfmdr1 copy numbers were assessed in 68 isolates from Suriname collected
from different endemic villages (2005) and from mining areas (2009). 11% of the
isolates harbour multiple copies of the pfmdr1 gene. Isolates originating from
mining areas do not yet display a higher tendency for increased copy number and
no significant differences could be registered within a time span of 4 years, but
the mere presence of increased copy number warrants caution and should be
considered as an early warning sign for emerging drug resistance in Suriname and 
South America.
