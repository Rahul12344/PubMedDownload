In the human malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, the gene doublesex (Agdsx) encodes
two alternatively spliced transcripts, dsx-female (AgdsxF) and dsx-male (AgdsxM),
that control differentiation of the two sexes. The female transcript, unlike the 
male, contains an exon (exon 5) whose sequence is highly conserved in all
Anopheles mosquitoes so far analyzed. We found that CRISPR-Cas9-targeted
disruption of the intron 4-exon 5 boundary aimed at blocking the formation of
functional AgdsxF did not affect male development or fertility, whereas females
homozygous for the disrupted allele showed an intersex phenotype and complete
sterility. A CRISPR-Cas9 gene drive construct targeting this same sequence spread
rapidly in caged mosquitoes, reaching 100% prevalence within 7-11 generations
while progressively reducing egg production to the point of total population
collapse. Owing to functional constraint of the target sequence, no selection of 
alleles resistant to the gene drive occurred in these laboratory experiments.
Cas9-resistant variants arose in each generation at the target site but did not
block the spread of the drive.
