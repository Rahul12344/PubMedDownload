BACKGROUND: The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is characterized as a
holoendemic malaria area with the main vectors being Anopheles funestus and
members of the Anopheles gambiae complex. Due to political instability and
socio-economic challenges in the region, knowledge of insecticide resistance
status and resistance mechanisms in these vectors is limited. Mosquitoes were
collected from a mining site in the north-eastern part of the country and,
following identification, were subjected to extensive testing for the target-site
and biochemical basis of resistance. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to
assess a suite of 10 genes frequently involved in pyrethroid and
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) resistance in An. gambiae females and
males. In An. funestus, gene expression microarray analysis was carried out on
female mosquitoes.
RESULTS: In both species, deltamethrin resistance was recorded along with high
resistance and suspected resistance to DDT in An. gambiae and An. funestus,
respectively. A total of 85% of An. gambiae carried the kdr mutations as either
homozygous resistant (RR) (L1014S, L1014F or both) or heterozygous (RS), however 
only 3% carried the rdl mutant allele (RS) and no ace-1 mutations were recorded. 
Synergist assays indicated a strong role for P450s in deltamethrin resistance in 
both species. In An. gambiae, analysis of transcription levels showed that the
glutathione-S-transferase, GSTS1-2, produced the highest fold change in
expression (7.6-fold in females and 31-fold in males) followed by GSTE2,
thioredoxin peroxidase (TPX2), and cytochrome oxidases (CYP6M2 and CYP6P1). All
other genes tested produced fold change values below 2. Microarray analysis
revealed significant over-transcription of cuticular proteins as well as CYP6M7, 
CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b in insecticide resistant An. funestus.
CONCLUSIONS: These data show that high levels of deltamethrin resistance in the
main malaria vector species, conferred by enzymatic detoxification, are present
in the DRC.
