BACKGROUND: Malaria infection can present with a wide variety of symptoms,
ranging from mild to severe. Plasmodium falciparum isolates in uncomplicated and 
severe malaria infections may have different parasite genetic profiles. This
study was conducted to assess differences in genetic diversity and allelic
frequencies in P. falciparum isolates according to malaria severity and age of
patients in the Gublack area, northwest Ethiopia.
METHODS: Cross-sectional health facility-based study conducted in Gublak,
Ethiopia between July, 2017 and October, 2017. Symptomatic P. falciparum malaria 
patients with microscopically-confirmed infection were enrolled. Parasite DNA was
extracted from filter paper blood spots and the polymorphic regions of the msp-1 
and msp-2 genes were genotyped using allele-specific nested-PCR with fragment
analysis by gel electrophoresis.
RESULTS: A total of 118 patients were enrolled including 95 (80.5%) with
uncomplicated infection and 23 (19.5%) with severe disease. In msp-1, the K1
allelic family was similarly prevalent in uncomplicated 42 (44.2%) and severe
disease 12 (52.2%). In msp-2, FC27 was detected in 55 (57.9%) of uncomplicated
infections and IC/3D7 in 14 (60.9%) of severe infections. 76 (64.4%) of the 118
isolates contained multiple genotypes; 56 (58.9%) in uncomplicated infections and
19 (82.6%) in severe infections. The overall of multiplicity of infection was 2.2
(95% CI 1.98-2.42) with 1.4 (95% CI 1.23-1.55) and 1.7 (95% CI 1.49-1.86) for
msp-1 and msp-2, respectively. Multiplicity of infection was significantly higher
in severe than uncomplicated infections (3.0 (95% CI 2.61-3.47) versus 2.0 (95%
CI 1.83-2.23), respectively, p = 0.001). There was no difference in multiplicity 
of infection across age groups (p = 0.104).
CONCLUSION: Patients with severe malaria were more likely to have multiclonal
infections. Further studies are needed to describe the association between P.
falciparum genotypes and malaria severity in different malaria transmission
areas.
