Genetic crosses of phenotypically distinct strains of the human malaria parasite 
Plasmodium falciparum are a powerful tool for identifying genes controlling drug 
resistance and other key phenotypes. Previous studies relied on the isolation of 
recombinant parasites from splenectomized chimpanzees, a research avenue that is 
no longer available. Here we demonstrate that human-liver chimeric mice support
recovery of recombinant progeny for the identification of genetic determinants of
parasite traits and adaptations.
