BACKGROUND: Anti-malarial drug resistance remains a major threat to global
malaria control efforts. In Africa, Plasmodium falciparum remains susceptible to 
artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), but the emergence of resistant
parasites in multiple countries in Southeast Asia and concerns over emergence
and/or spread of resistant parasites in Africa warrants continuous monitoring.
The World Health Organization recommends that surveillance for molecular markers 
of resistance be included within therapeutic efficacy studies (TES). The current 
study assessed molecular markers associated with resistance to
Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) from samples
collected from children aged 6-59 months enrolled in a TES conducted in Siaya
County, western Kenya from 2016 to 2017.
METHODS: Three hundred and twenty-three samples collected pre-treatment (day-0)
and 110 samples collected at the day of recurrent parasitaemia (up to day 42)
were tested for the presence of drug resistance markers in the Pfk13 propeller
domain, and the Pfmdr1 and Pfcrt genes by Sanger sequencing. Additionally, the
Pfpm2 gene copy number was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: No mutations previously associated with artemisinin resistance were
detected in the Pfk13 propeller region. However, other non-synonymous mutations
in the Pfk13 propeller region were detected. The most common mutation found on
day-0 and at day of recurrence in the Pfmdr1 multidrug resistance marker was at
codon 184F. Very few mutations were found in the Pfcrt marker (< 5%). Within the 
DP arm, all recrudescent cases (8 sample pairs) that were tested for Pfpm2 gene
copy number had a single gene copy. None of the associations between observed
mutations and treatment outcomes were statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate absence of Pfk13 mutations associated with
parasite resistance to artemisinin in this area and a very high proportion of
wild-type parasites for Pfcrt. Although the frequency of Pfmdr1 184F mutations
was high in these samples, the association with treatment failure did not reach
statistical significance. As the spread of artemisinin-resistant parasites
remains a possibility, continued monitoring for molecular markers of ACT
resistance is needed to complement clinical data to inform treatment policy in
Kenya and other malaria-endemic regions.
