BACKGROUND: The human malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax infects red blood cells
through a key pathway that requires interaction between Duffy binding protein II 
(DBPII) and its receptor on reticulocytes, the Duffy antigen/receptor for
chemokines (DARC). A high proportion of P. vivax-exposed individuals fail to
develop antibodies that inhibit DBPII-DARC interaction, and genetic factors that 
modulate this humoral immune response are poorly characterized. Here, we
investigate if DBPII responsiveness could be HLA class II-linked.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A community-based open cohort study was carried
out in an agricultural settlement of the Brazilian Amazon, in which 336 unrelated
volunteers were genotyped for HLA class II (DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1 loci), and their 
DBPII immune responses were monitored over time (baseline, 6 and 12 months) by
conventional serology (DBPII IgG ELISA-detected) and functional assays
(inhibition of DBPII-erythrocyte binding). The results demonstrated an increased 
susceptibility of the DRB1*13:01 carriers to develop and sustain an anti-DBPII
IgG response, while individuals with the haplotype
DRB1*14:02-DQA1*05:03-DQB1*03:01 were persistent non-responders. HLA class II
gene polymorphisms also influenced the functional properties of DBPII antibodies 
(BIAbs, binding inhibitory antibodies), with three alleles (DRB1*07:01,
DQA1*02:01 and DQB1*02:02) comprising a single haplotype linked with the presence
and persistence of the BIAbs response. Modelling the structural effects of the
HLA-DRB1 variants revealed a number of differences in the peptide-binding groove,
which is likely to lead to altered antigen binding and presentation profiles, and
hence may explain the differences in subject responses.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The current study confirms the heritability of the
DBPII antibody response, with genetic variation in HLA class II genes influencing
both the development and persistence of IgG antibody responses. Cellular studies 
to increase knowledge of the binding affinities of DBPII peptides for class II
molecules linked with good or poor antibody responses might lead to the
development of strategies for controlling the type of helper T cells activated in
response to DBPII.
