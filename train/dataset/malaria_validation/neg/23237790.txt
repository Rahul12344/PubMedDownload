mRNA and protein expression profiles for three peroxiredoxins (TPx-1, TPx-2 and
1-Cys Prx) of liver stage Plasmodium berghei were examined through quantitative
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy
assay (IFA). RT-PCR experiments revealed that mRNA expression for the TPx-1 was
detected shortly after the sporozoite infection and kept expressed until the
schizont stage. In contrast, the mRNA expression for 1-Cys Prx had begun
increasing when the parasite developed into the schizont stage. Using the IFA,
TPx-1 and 1-Cys Prx were detected in the cytosol. This finding suggested the
developmental stage-specific expression of the cytosolic enzymes in the liver
stage parasite. On the other hand, the mRNA expression for TPx-2 had begun
increasing at the trophozoite stage and peaked at the schizont stage. In the IFA,
TPx-2 was found localized in the mitochondria. The increase of TPx-2 might be
explained by the exponential development of the parasite during the schizont
stage requiring ATP production which may induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in 
the mitochondria.
