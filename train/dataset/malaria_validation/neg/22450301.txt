Conditional mutagenesis is a powerful tool for genetic analysis in Plasmodium
berghei. It allows the study of proteins that function both during the parasite's
pre-erythocytic and erythrocytic development. Currently available parasite lines 
used for conditional mutagenesis were constructed in the NK65 strain, and express
a DNA recombinase under the control of pre-erythrocytic stage-specific promoters.
However, the integration of the recombinase in these lines is unstable leading to
inconsistent excision of the target gene. We describe improved lines of P.
berghei with stably integrated DNA recombinase that allow efficient,
stage-specific excision of target genes in the widely used ANKA strain.
