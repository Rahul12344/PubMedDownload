Plasmodium sporozoites invade hepatocytes to initiate infection in the mammalian 
host. In the infected hepatocytes, sporozoites undergo rapid expansion and
differentiation, resulting in the formation and release of thousands of invasive 
merozoites into the bloodstream. Both sporozoites and merozoites invade their
host cells by activation of a signaling cascade followed by discharge of
micronemal content. cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit
(PKAc)-mediated signaling plays an important role in merozoite invasion of
erythrocytes, but its role during other stages of the parasite remains unknown.
Becaused of the essentiality of PKAc in blood stages, we generated conditional
mutants of PKAc by disrupting the gene in Plasmodium berghei sporozoites. The
mutant salivary gland sporozoites were able to glide, invaded hepatocytes, and
matured into hepatic merozoites which were released successfully from merosome,
however failed to initiate blood stage infection when inoculated into mice. Our
results demonstrate that malaria parasite complete preerythrocytic stages
development without PKAc, raising the possibility that the PKAc independent
signaling operates in preerythrocytic stages of P. berghei.
