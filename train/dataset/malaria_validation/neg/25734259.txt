BACKGROUND: Planning and evaluating malaria control strategies relies on accurate
definition of parasite prevalence in the population. A large proportion of
asymptomatic parasite infections can only be identified by surveillance with
molecular methods, yet these infections also contribute to onward transmission to
mosquitoes. The sensitivity of molecular detection by PCR is limited by the
abundance of the target sequence in a DNA sample; thus, detection becomes
imperfect at low densities. We aimed to increase PCR diagnostic sensitivity by
targeting multi-copy genomic sequences for reliable detection of low-density
infections, and investigated the impact of these PCR assays on community
prevalence data.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Two quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays were developed for
ultra-sensitive detection of Plasmodium falciparum, targeting the high-copy
telomere-associated repetitive element 2 (TARE-2, ∼250 copies/genome) and the var
gene acidic terminal sequence (varATS, 59 copies/genome). Our assays reached a
limit of detection of 0.03 to 0.15 parasites/μl blood and were 10× more sensitive
than standard 18S rRNA qPCR. In a population cross-sectional study in Tanzania,
295/498 samples tested positive using ultra-sensitive assays. Light microscopy
missed 169 infections (57%). 18S rRNA qPCR failed to identify 48 infections
(16%), of which 40% carried gametocytes detected by pfs25 quantitative
reverse-transcription PCR. To judge the suitability of the TARE-2 and varATS
assays for high-throughput screens, their performance was tested on sample pools.
Both ultra-sensitive assays correctly detected all pools containing one
low-density P. falciparum-positive sample, which went undetected by 18S rRNA
qPCR, among nine negatives. TARE-2 and varATS qPCRs improve estimates of
prevalence rates, yet other infections might still remain undetected when absent 
in the limited blood volume sampled.
CONCLUSIONS: Measured malaria prevalence in communities is largely determined by 
the sensitivity of the diagnostic tool used. Even when applying standard
molecular diagnostics, prevalence in our study population was underestimated by
8% compared to the new assays. Our findings highlight the need for highly
sensitive tools such as TARE-2 and varATS qPCR in community surveillance and for 
monitoring interventions to better describe malaria epidemiology and inform
malaria elimination efforts.
