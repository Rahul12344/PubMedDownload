Malaria is a dangerous disease affecting millions around the globe.
Biosynthesized nanoparticles are used against a variety of diseases including
malaria worldwide. Here, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized from the leaf
extracts of Indigofera oblongifolia have been used in the treatment of mice
infected with Plasmodium chabaudi to evaluate the expression of iron regulatory
genes in the spleen. Infrared spectroscopy was used to identify the expected
classes of compounds in the extract. AgNPs were able to decrease the parasitemia 
nearly similar to the used reference drug, chloroquine. In addition, AgNPs
significantly decreased the spleen index after infection. Moreover, the iron
distribution was increased after the treatment. Finally, AgNPs could regulate the
mice spleen iron regulatory genes, Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), transferrin receptor 1
(TFR1) and hepcidin antimicrobial peptide (Hamp). Taken together, our findings
indicate that AgNPs have antimalarial activity and can control the state of iron 
in spleen. We need further investigations to determine mechanisms of action of
the AgNPs.
