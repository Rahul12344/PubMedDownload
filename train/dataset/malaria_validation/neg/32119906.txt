Viviparous reproduction is characterized by maternal retention of developing
offspring within the reproductive tract during gestation, culminating in live
birth. In some cases, a mother will provide nutrition beyond that present in the 
yolk; this is known as matrotrophic viviparity. While this phenomenon is best
associated with mammals, it is observed in insects such as the viviparous
cockroach, Diploptera punctata. Female D. punctata carry developing embryos in
the brood sac, a reproductive organ that acts as both a uterus and a placenta by 
protecting and providing a nutritive secretion to the intrauterine developing
progeny. While the basic physiology of D. punctata pregnancy has been
characterized, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying this
phenomenon. This study combined RNA-seq analysis, RNA interference, and other
assays to characterize molecular and physiological changes associated with D.
punctata reproduction. A comparison of four stages of the female reproductive
cycle and males revealed unique gene expression profiles corresponding to each
stage and between sexes. Differentially regulated transcripts of interest include
the previously identified family of milk proteins and transcripts associated with
juvenile hormone metabolism. RNA interference and methoprene application
experiments established the potential impacts of bothbreakdown and synthesis
reduction of juvenile hormone in maintaining pregnancy in D. punctata. These
studies provide the comprehensive molecular mechanisms associated with cockroach 
viviparity, which will be a critical resource for comparative purposes among
viviparity in insect systems.
