Considerable research effort has been directed at understanding the genetic and
molecular basis of mosquito innate immune mechanisms. Whether environmental
factors interact with these mechanisms to shape overall resistance remains
largely unexplored. Here, we examine how changes in mean ambient temperature,
diurnal temperature fluctuation and time of day of infection affected the
immunity and resistance of Anopheles stephensi to infection with Escherichia
coli. We used quantitative PCR to estimate the gene expression of three immune
genes in response to challenge with heat-killed E. coli. We also infected
mosquitoes with live E. coli and ran bacterial growth assays to quantify host
resistance. Both mosquito immune parameters and resistance were directly affected
by mean temperature, diurnal temperature fluctuation and time of day of
infection. Furthermore, there was a suite of complex two- and three-way
interactions yielding idiosyncratic phenotypic variation under different
environmental conditions. The results demonstrate mosquito immunity and
resistance to be strongly influenced by a complex interplay of environmental
variables, challenging the interpretation of the very many mosquito immune
studies conducted under standard laboratory conditions.
