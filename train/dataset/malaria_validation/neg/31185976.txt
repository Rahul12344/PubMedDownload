BACKGROUND: Mutational analysis of the Plasmodium falciparum kelch 13 (k13) gene 
is routinely performed to track the emergence and spread of artemisinin
resistance. Surveillance of resistance markers has been impeded by the difficulty
of extracting sufficient DNA from low parasite density infections common in
low-transmission settings, such as Southeast Asia. This problem can be overcome
by collecting large volumes of venous blood. Efficient methods for extracting and
amplifying k13 from dried blood spots (DBS) would facilitate resistance
surveillance.
METHODS: Methods for k13 amplification from standard Whatman 3MM DBS (stored for 
14 days at 28 °C with 80% relative humidity) were optimized by systematically
testing different extraction conditions. Conditions that improved parasite DNA
recovery as assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of 18S rDNA 
were then tested for their impact on k13 PCR amplification.
RESULTS: The optimized protocol for amplification of k13 from DBS is markedly
more sensitive than standard methods using commercial kits. Using this method,
k13 was successfully amplified from laboratory-created DBS samples with parasite 
densities as low as 500 parasites/mL. Importantly, the method recovers both DNA
and RNA, making it compatible with RNA-based ultrasensitive techniques currently 
in use.
CONCLUSIONS: The optimized DBS protocol should facilitate drug resistance
surveillance, especially in low-transmission settings where clinical malaria
infections with high parasite densities are rare.
