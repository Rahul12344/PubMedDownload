BACKGROUND: The problem of anti-malarial drug resistance is a long-term challenge
faced by malaria control in Yunnan Province. Recently, the detection rates of
chloroquine-resistant molecular markers (Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine
resistant transporter, Pfcrt) and artemisinin-resistant molecular markers (P.
falciparum kelch13 gene, ork13) were 85% and 35%, respectively. To understand the
association of k13 gene mutation with artemisinin resistance in falciparum
malaria cases, the difference in k13 gene differentiation between two populations
and artemisinin resistance phenotype on falciparum malaria cases in Myanmar were 
analysed in this study.
METHODS: This research involved all of falciparum malaria cases diagnosed
continuously in Yunnan Province from 2013 to 2015 and some of falciparum malaria 
cases found in Lazar, Myanmar. Blood samples were taken from the former group for
molecular epidemiological analysis of k13 gene mutations, and artemisinin
resistance phenotypes of P. falciparum were observed in the latter group using
the in vivo testing method recommended by the World Health Organization. Nested
PCR was used to amplify the propeller domain of the k13 gene in P. falciparum,
followed by sequencing.
RESULTS: A total of 202 blood samples were collected from Yunnan Province and 382
blood samples were collected from falciparum malaria cases in Myanmar. 49 of 382 
Myanmar cases were in vivo tested for artesunate resistance phenotype through
full treatment course observation. At the same time, all the blood samples were
screened for k13 gene mutation of P. falciparum. The genetic diversity of k13 was
higher in the Plasmodium isolates from Yunnan Province than those from Myanmar
cases. The genetic differentiation index of the two populations was 0.0410, where
the intra- and inter-group variations were 95.9% and 4.1%, respectively. The odds
ratio of artemisinin resistance phenotype and mutation at the locus 446 in k13
gene in Myanmar cases was 1.640, while the value was 1.840 based on the
estimations of the mutations in the 12 loci.
CONCLUSION: Although the Plasmodium isolates from Yunnan Province and those from 
Myanmar were collected from different sites, they still belong to the same
geographical population. It is, therefore, reasonable to contrast the artemisinin
resistance status of the Plasmodium population from Myanmar with the Plasmodium
population from Yunnan Province. As a result, based on the molecular
epidemiological investigation on k13 mutations of Plasmodium isolates in Yunnan
Province and the determination of the artemisinin resistance on falciparum
malaria cases in Myanmar, the positively genetic correlated was found between the
k13 locus mutations with artemisinin resistance phenotype. This provides a basis 
for further monitoring the artemisinin resistance by detection some molecular
markers in k13 gene of Plasmodium in Yunnan Province.
