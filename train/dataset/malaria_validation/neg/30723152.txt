The positioning of chromosomes in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell is highly
organized and has a complex and dynamic relationship with gene expression. In the
human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the clustering of a family of
virulence genes correlates with their coordinated silencing and has a strong
influence on the overall organization of the genome. To identify conserved and
species-specific principles of genome organization, we performed Hi-C experiments
and generated 3D genome models for five Plasmodium species and two related
apicomplexan parasites. Plasmodium species mainly showed clustering of
centromeres, telomeres, and virulence genes. In P. falciparum, the
heterochromatic virulence gene cluster had a strong repressive effect on the
surrounding nuclear space, while this was less pronounced in Plasmodium vivax and
Plasmodium berghei, and absent in Plasmodium yoelii In Plasmodium knowlesi,
telomeres and virulence genes were more dispersed throughout the nucleus, but its
3D genome showed a strong correlation with gene expression. The Babesia microti
genome showed a classical Rabl organization with colocalization of subtelomeric
virulence genes, while the Toxoplasma gondii genome was dominated by clustering
of the centromeres and lacked virulence gene clustering. Collectively, our
results demonstrate that spatial genome organization in most Plasmodium species
is constrained by the colocalization of virulence genes. P. falciparum and P.
knowlesi, the only two Plasmodium species with gene families involved in
antigenic variation, are unique in the effect of these genes on chromosome
folding, indicating a potential link between genome organization and gene
expression in more virulent pathogens.
