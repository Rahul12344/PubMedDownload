BACKGROUND: Malaria in pregnancy is associated with considerable morbidity and
mortality. Regular surveillance of artemisinin-based combination therapy
tolerance, or molecular makers of resistance, is vital for effective malaria
treatment, control and eradication programmes. Plasmodium falciparum multiple
drug resistance-1 gene (Pfmdr1) N86Y mutation is associated with reduced
susceptibility to lumefantrine. This study assessed the prevalence of Pfmdr1 N86Y
in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo.
METHODS: A total 1001 of P. falciparum-infected blood samples obtained from
asymptomatic malaria pregnant women having a normal child delivery at the Madibou
Integrated Health Centre were analysed. Pfmdr1 N86Y genotyping was conducted
using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism.
RESULTS: The wild type Pfmdr1 N86 allele was predominant (> 68%) in this study,
whereas a few isolates carrying the either the mutant allele (Pfmdr1 86Y) alone
or both alleles (mixed genotype). The dominance of the wildtype allele (pfmdr1
N86) indicates the plausible decline P. falciparum susceptibility to
lumefantrine.
CONCLUSION: This study gives an update on the prevalence of Pfmdr1 N86Y alleles
in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo. It also raises concern on the imminent
emergence of resistance against artemether-lumefantrine in this setting. This
study underscores the importance to regular artemether-lumefantrine efficacy
monitoring to inform the malaria control programme of the Republic of Congo.
