BACKGROUND: In Southeast Asia, Plasmodium knowlesi, a parasite of long-tailed
macaques (Macaca fascicularis), is an important cause of human malaria.
Plasmodium cynomolgi also commonly infects these monkeys, but only one naturally 
acquired symptomatic human case has been reported previously.
METHODS: Malariometric studies involving 5422 subjects (aged 6 months to 65
years) were conducted in 23 villages in Pailin and Battambang, western Cambodia. 
Parasite detection and genotyping was conducted on blood samples, using
high-volume quantitative PCR (uPCR).
RESULTS: Asymptomatic malaria parasite infections were detected in 1361 of 14732 
samples (9.2%). Asymptomatic infections with nonhuman primate malaria parasites
were found in 21 individuals living close to forested areas; P. cynomolgi was
found in 11, P. knowlesi was found in 8, and P. vivax and P. cynomolgi were both 
found in 2. Only 2 subjects were female, and 14 were men aged 20-40 years.
Geometric mean parasite densities were 3604 parasites/mL in P. cynomolgi
infections and 52488 parasites/mL in P. knowlesi infections. All P. cynomolgi
isolates had wild-type dihydrofolate reductase genes, in contrast to the very
high prevalence of mutations in the human malaria parasites. Asymptomatic
reappearance of P. cynomolgi occurred in 2 subjects 3 months after the first
infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic naturally acquired P. cynomolgi and P. knowlesi
infections can both occur in humans.
