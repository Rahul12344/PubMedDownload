STING is an innate immune cytosolic adaptor for DNA sensors that engage malaria
parasite (Plasmodium falciparum) or other pathogen DNA. As P. falciparum infects 
red blood cells and not leukocytes, how parasite DNA reaches such host cytosolic 
DNA sensors in immune cells is unclear. Here we show that malaria parasites
inside red blood cells can engage host cytosolic innate immune cell receptors
from a distance by secreting extracellular vesicles (EV) containing parasitic
small RNA and genomic DNA. Upon internalization of DNA-harboring EVs by human
monocytes, P. falciparum DNA is released within the host cell cytosol, leading to
STING-dependent DNA sensing. STING subsequently activates the kinase TBK1, which 
phosphorylates the transcription factor IRF3, causing IRF3 to translocate to the 
nucleus and induce STING-dependent gene expression. This DNA-sensing pathway may 
be an important decoy mechanism to promote P. falciparum virulence and thereby
may affect future strategies to treat malaria.
