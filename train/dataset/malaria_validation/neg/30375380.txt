Malaria reduces host fitness and survival by pathogen-mediated damage and
inflammation. Disease tolerance mechanisms counter these negative effects without
decreasing pathogen load. Here, we demonstrate that in four different mouse
models of malaria, adrenal hormones confer disease tolerance and protect against 
early death, independently of parasitemia. Surprisingly, adrenalectomy
differentially affects malaria-induced inflammation by increasing circulating
cytokines and inflammation in the brain but not in the liver or lung.
Furthermore, without affecting the transcription of hepatic gluconeogenic
enzymes, adrenalectomy causes exhaustion of hepatic glycogen and
insulin-independent lethal hypoglycemia upon infection. This hypoglycemia is not 
prevented by glucose administration or TNF-Î± neutralization. In contrast,
treatment with a synthetic glucocorticoid (dexamethasone) prevents the
hypoglycemia, lowers cerebral cytokine expression and increases survival rates.
Overall, we conclude that in malaria, adrenal hormones do not protect against
lung and liver inflammation. Instead, they prevent excessive systemic and brain
inflammation and severe hypoglycemia, thereby contributing to tolerance.
