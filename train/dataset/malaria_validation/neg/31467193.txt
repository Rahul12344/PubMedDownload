The requirement for next-generation antimalarials to be both curative and
transmission-blocking necessitates the identification of previously undiscovered 
druggable molecular pathways. We identified a selective inhibitor of the
Plasmodium falciparum protein kinase PfCLK3, which we used in combination with
chemogenetics to validate PfCLK3 as a drug target acting at multiple parasite
life stages. Consistent with a role for PfCLK3 in RNA splicing, inhibition
resulted in the down-regulation of more than 400 essential parasite genes.
Inhibition of PfCLK3 mediated rapid killing of asexual liver- and blood-stage P. 
falciparum and blockade of gametocyte development, thereby preventing
transmission, and also showed parasiticidal activity against P. berghei and P.
knowlesi Hence, our data establish PfCLK3 as a target for drugs, with the
potential to offer a cure-to be prophylactic and transmission blocking in
malaria.
