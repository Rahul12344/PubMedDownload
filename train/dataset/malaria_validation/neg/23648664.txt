Blocking transmission of malaria is a reliable way to control and eliminate
infection. However, in-depth knowledge of the interaction between Plasmodium and 
mosquito is needed. Studies suggest that innate immunity is the main mechanism
inhibiting development of malaria parasites in the mosquito. Recent studies have 
found that use of antibiotics that inhibit the mosquito gut flora can reduce the 
immune response of Anopheles gambiae, thereby contributing to the development of 
malaria parasites. In our study, we used the non susceptible model of Anopheles
dirus-Plasmodium yoelii to explore the effect of Anopheles intestinal flora on
the natural resistance of A. dirus to P. yoelii. We found that in mosquitoes
infected with Plasmodium, the intestinal flora can regulate expression of
thioester-containing protein (TEP1) via an RNAi gene-silencing approach. Our
results suggest that in the absence of TEP1, the natural microbiota cannot
suppress the development of P. yoelii in A. dirus. This suggests that AdTEP1
plays an important role in the resistance of A. dirus to P. yoelii. The
intestinal flora may modulate the development of P. yoelii in A. dirus by
regulating TEP1 expression.
