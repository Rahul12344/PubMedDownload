An epidemiological study of leishmaniasis was performed in Amazonian areas of
Ecuador since little information on the prevalent Leishmania and sand fly species
responsible for the transmission is available. Of 33 clinical specimens from
patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), causative parasites were identified
in 25 samples based on cytochrome b gene analysis. As reported previously,
Leishmania (Viannia) guyanensis and L. (V.) braziliensis were among the causative
agents identified. In addition, L. (V.) lainsoni, for which infection is reported
in Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Suriname, and French Guiana, was identified in patients
with CL from geographically separate areas in the Ecuadorian Amazon,
corroborating the notion that L. (V.) lainsoni is widely distributed in South
America. Sand flies were surveyed around the area where a patient with L. (V.)
lainsoni was suspected to have been infected. However, natural infection of sand 
flies by L. (V.) lainsoni was not detected. Further extensive vector searches are
necessary to define the transmission cycle of L. (V.) lainsoni in Ecuador.
