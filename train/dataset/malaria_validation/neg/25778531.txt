Plasmodium falciparum invasion of human red blood cells (RBCs) is an intricate
process requiring a number of distinct ligand-receptor interactions at the
merozoite-erythrocyte interface. Merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1), a highly
abundant ligand coating the merozoite surface in all species of malaria
parasites, is essential for RBC invasion and considered a leading candidate for
inclusion in a multiple-subunit vaccine against malaria. Our previous studies
identified an interaction between the carboxyl-terminus of MSP1 and RBC band 3.
Here, by employing phage display technology, we report a novel interaction
between the amino-terminus of MSP1 and RBC glycophorin A (GPA). Mapping of the
binding domains established a direct interaction between malaria MSP1 and human
GPA within a region of MSP1 known to potently inhibit P falciparum invasion of
human RBCs. Furthermore, a genetically modified mouse model lacking the GPA- band
3 complex in RBCs is completely resistant to malaria infection in vivo. These
findings suggest an essential role of the MSP1-GPA-band 3 complex during the
initial adhesion phase of malaria parasite invasion of RBCs.
