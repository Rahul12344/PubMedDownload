Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone coming from the traditional Chinese herb
Artemisia annua L. Artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) are the main
recommended treatment of malaria. Transcription factors regulation of artemisinin
belong to different families including AP2/ERF, bHLH, MYB and WRKY. Plant
hormones jasmonic acid (JA), abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA) and
gibberellins (GA) have been described as positively affecting artemisinin
biosynthesis in A. annua. Transporter and miRNA open up new possibilities for the
biosynthesis of high value artemisinin. We review recently major developments
regarding regulator which play a center role in artemisinin biosynthesis, and
provide suggestion for further studies.
