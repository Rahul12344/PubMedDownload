Phenotypic observation of thioredoxin peroxidase-1 (TPx-1) gene-disrupted
Plasmodium berghei (TPx-1 KO) in the liver-stage was performed with an in vitro
infection system in order to investigate defective liver-stage development in a
mouse infection model. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy assay with
anti-circumsporozoite protein antibody revealed that in the liver schizont stage,
TPx-1 KO parasite cells were significantly smaller than cells of the wild-type
parent strain (WT). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy assay with
anti-merozoite surface protein-1 antibody, which was used to evaluate late
schizont-stage development, indicated that TPx-1 KO schizont development was
similar to WT strain development towards the merozoite-forming stage (mature
schizont). However, fewer merozoites were produced in the mature TPx-1 KO
schizont than in the mature WT schizont. Taken together, the results suggest that
TPx-1 may be involved in merozoite formation during liver schizont development.
