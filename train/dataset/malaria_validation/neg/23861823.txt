BACKGROUND: The accuracy of the conclusions from in vivo efficacy anti-malarial
drug trials depends on distinguishing between recrudescences and re-infections
which is accomplished by genotyping genes coding P. falciparum merozoite surface 
1 (MSP1) and MSP2. However, the reliability of the PCR analysis depends on the
genetic markers' allelic diversity and variant frequency. In this study the
genetic diversity of the genes coding for MSP1 and MSP2 was obtained for P.
falciparum parasites circulating in Yemen.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 511 patients with fever and screened
for malaria parasites using Giemsa-stained blood films. A total 74 samples were
infected with P. falciparum, and the genetic diversity was assessed by nested PCR
targeting Pfmsp1 (Block2) and Pfmsp2 (block 3).
RESULTS: Overall, 58%, 28% and 54% of the isolates harboured parasites of the
Pfmsp1 K1, MAD20 and RO33 allelic families, and 55% and 89% harboured those of
the Pfmsp2 FC27 and 3D7 allelic families, respectively. For both genetic makers, 
the multiplicity of the infection (MOI) was significantly higher in the isolates 
from the foothills/coastland areas as compared to those from the highland
(P<0.05). Pfmsp2 had higher number of distinct allelic variants than Pfmsp1 (20
vs 11). The expected heterozygosity (HE) for Pfmsp1 and Pfmsp2 were 0.82 and
0.94, respectively. Nonetheless, a bias in the frequency distribution of the
Pfmsp1 allelic variants was noted from all areas, and of those of Pfmsp2 in the
samples collected from the highland areas.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in the complexity and allelic diversity of
Pfmsp1 and Pfmsp2 genes between areas probably reflect differences in the
intensity of malaria transmission. The biased distribution of allelic variants
suggests that in Yemen Pfmsp1 should not be used for PCR correction of in vivo
clinical trials outcomes, and that caution should be exercised when employing
Pfmsp2.
