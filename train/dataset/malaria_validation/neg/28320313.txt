BACKGROUND: Opsins are light sensitive receptors associated with visual
processes. Insects typically possess opsins that are stimulated by ultraviolet,
short and long wavelength (LW) radiation. Six putative LW-sensitive opsins
predicted in the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti and malaria mosquito,
Anopheles gambiae, and eight in the southern house mosquito, Culex
quinquefasciatus, suggest gene expansion in the Family Culicidae (mosquitoes)
relative to other insects. Here we report the first detailed molecular and
evolutionary analyses of LW opsins in three mosquito vectors, with a goal to
understanding the molecular basis of opsin-mediated visual processes that could
be exploited for mosquito control.
RESULTS: Time of divergence estimates suggest that the mosquito LW opsins
originated from 18 or 19 duplication events between 166.9/197.5 to 1.07/0.94
million years ago (MY) and that these likely occurred following the predicted
divergence of the lineages Anophelinae and Culicinae 145-226 MY. Fitmodel
analyses identified nine amino acid residues in the LW opsins that may be under
positive selection. Of these, eight amino acids occur in the N and C termini and 
are shared among all three species, and one residue in TMIII was unique to
culicine species. Alignment of 5' non-coding regions revealed potential Conserved
Non-coding Sequences (CNS) and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in seven
pairs of LW opsin paralogs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses suggest opsin gene duplication and residues possibly
associated with spectral tuning of LW-sensitive photoreceptors. We explore two
mechanisms - positive selection and differential expression mediated by
regulatory units in CNS - that may have contributed to the retention of LW opsin 
genes in Culicinae and Anophelinae. We discuss the evolution of mosquito LW
opsins in the context of major Earth events and possible adaptation of mosquitoes
to LW-dominated photo environments, and implications for mosquito control
strategies based on disrupting vision-mediated behaviors.
