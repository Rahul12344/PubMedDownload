Genetic vaccination, consisting in delivering a genetically engineered plasmid
DNA by a non-viral vector or technique into a tissue, is currently of great
interest. New delivery technique including DNA transfer by electroporation
recently greatly improved the potency of this concept. Because it avoids the step
of producing a recombinant protein, it is particularly of use in studying the
immunogenic properties of large proteins. Here we describe the use of
electroporation mediated DNA immunization to identify important protective
epitopes from the large VAR2CSA protein from Plasmodium falciparum implicated in 
the pathology of placental malaria. Immunizing mice and rabbit with DNA plasmids 
encoding different fragments of VAR2CSA leads to high titer antisera. Moreover an
N-terminal region of the protein was found to induce protective functional
antibodies.
