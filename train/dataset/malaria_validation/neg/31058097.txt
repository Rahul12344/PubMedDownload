Transgenic malaria parasites expressing fluorescent and bioluminescent proteins
are valuable tools to interrogate malaria-parasite biology and to evaluate drugs 
and vaccines. Using CRISPR/Cas9 methodology a transgenic Plasmodium falciparum
(Pf) NF54 line was generated that expresses a fusion of mCherry and luciferase
genes under the control of the Pf etramp10.3 gene promoter (line
mCherry-luc@etramp10.3). Pf etramp10.3 is related to rodent Plasmodium uis4 and
the uis4 promoter has been used to drive high transgene expression in rodent
parasite sporozoites and liver-stages. We examined transgene expression
throughout the complete life cycle and compared this expression to transgenic
lines expressing mCherry-luciferase and GFP-luciferase under control of the
constitutive gapdh and eef1a promoters. The mCherry-luc@etramp10.3 parasites
express mCherry in gametocytes, sporozoites, and liver-stages. While no mCherry
signal was detected in asexual blood-stage parasites above background levels,
luciferase expression was detected in asexual blood-stages, as well as in
gametocytes, sporozoites and liver-stages, with the highest levels of reporter
expression detected in stage III-V gametocytes and in sporozoites. The expression
of mCherry and luciferase in gametocytes and sporozoites makes this transgenic
parasite line suitable to use in in vitro assays that examine the effect of
transmission blocking inhibitors and to analyse gametocyte and sporozoite
biology.
