The use of long lasting insecticide nets (LLINs) treated with pyrethroïd is known
for its major contribution in malaria control. However, LLINs are suspected to
induce behavioral changes in malaria vectors, which may in turn drastically
affect their efficacy against Plasmodium sp. transmission. In sub Saharan Africa,
where malaria imposes the heaviest burden, the main malaria vectors are widely
resistant to pyrethroïds, the insecticide family used on LLINs, which also
threatens LLIN efficiency. There is therefore a crucial need for deciphering how 
insecticide-impregnated materials might affect the host-seeking behavior of
malaria vectors in regards to insecticide resistance. In this study, we explored 
the impact of permethrin-impregnated net on the host attractiveness for Anopheles
gambiae mosquitoes, either susceptible to insecticides, or carrying the
insecticide resistance conferring allele kdr. Groups of female mosquitoes were
released in a dual-choice olfactometer and their movements towards an attractive 
odor source (a rabbit) protected by insecticide-treated (ITN) or untreated nets
(UTN) were monitored. Kdr homozygous mosquitoes, resistant to insecticides, were 
more attracted by a host behind an ITN than an UTN, while the presence of
insecticide on the net did not affect the choice of susceptible mosquitoes. These
results suggest that permethrin-impregnated net is detectable by malaria vectors 
and that the kdr mutation impacts their response to a LLIN protected host. We
discuss the implication of these results for malaria vector control.
