Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), expressed on P.
falciparum-infected erythrocytes, is a major family of clonally variant targets
of naturally acquired immunity to malaria. Previous studies have demonstrated
that in areas where malaria is endemic, antibodies to infected erythrocytes from 
children with severe malaria tend to be more seroprevalent than antibodies to
infected erythrocytes from children with nonsevere malaria. These data have led
to a working hypothesis that PfEMP1 variants associated with parasite virulence
are relatively conserved in structure. However, the longevity of such
serologically conserved variants in the parasite population is unknown. Here,
using infected erythrocytes from recently sampled clinical P. falciparum samples,
we measured serological conservation using pools of antibodies in sera that had
been sampled 10 to 12 years earlier. The serological conservation of infected
erythrocytes strongly correlated with the expression of specific PfEMP1 subsets
previously found to be associated with severe malaria. However, we found no
association between serological conservation per se and disease severity within
these data. This contrasts with the simple hypothesis that P. falciparum isolates
with a serologically conserved group of PfEMP1 variants cause severe malaria. The
data are instead consistent with periodic turnover of the immunodominant epitopes
of PfEMP1 associated with severe malaria.
