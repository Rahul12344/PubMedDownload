BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax once considered benign is now being increasingly
associated with complicated malaria where the spectrum of complications is vast
and like Plasmodium falciparum. The clinical data is important with respect to
the immunopathological status of the patient. Several genes like the vir genes
and pvcrt-o are speculated to be attributing to the severity of P. vivax malaria.
METHODS: In the present study we carried out the transcription analysis of five
vir genes (vir 14-related, vir 12, vir 17-like, putative vir 14 and vir
10-related) and pvcrt-o gene in severe (n=12) and non-severe (n=7) P. vivax
clinical infections and studied the correlation of these genes with clinical
disease severity.
RESULTS: This study revealed multiorgan involvement in severe vivax cases with
severe thrombocytopenia and anemia, the predominantly occurring symptoms. Four
out of five vir genes and pvcrt-o showed a significant increase in expression
levels of severe infections compared to the non-severe infections indicating
their possible role in the changing pathogenesis of P. vivax.
CONCLUSIONS: The increased virulence in vivax malaria seems to be the result of
multifactorial parameters changing it phenotypically as well as genotypically.
However more studies are needed to understand the still nascent severity of P.
vivax malaria.
