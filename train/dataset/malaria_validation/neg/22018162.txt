BACKGROUND: Mechanisms by which anti-malarial immune responses occur are still
not fully clear. Natural killer (NK) cells are thought to play a pivotal role in 
innate responses against Plasmodium falciparum. In this study, the suitability of
NK92 cells as models for the NK mechanisms involved in the immune response
against malaria was investigated.
METHODS: NK92 cells were assessed for several signs of activation and
cytotoxicity due to contact to parasites and were as well examined by
oligonucleotide microarrays for an insight on the impact P. falciparum-infected
erythrocytes have on their transcriptome. To address the parasite side of such
interaction, growth inhibition assays were performed including non-NK cells as
controls.
RESULTS: By performing microarrays with NK92 cells, the impact of parasites on a 
transcriptional level was observed. The findings show that, although not
evidently activated by iRBCs, NK92 cells show transcriptional signs of priming
and proliferation. In addition, decreased parasitaemia was observed due to
co-incubation with NK92 cells. However, such effect might not be NK-specific
since irrelevant cells also affected parasite growth in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: Although NK92 cells are here shown to behave as poor models for the 
NK immune response against parasites, the results obtained in this study may be
of use for future investigations regarding host-parasites interactions in
malaria.
