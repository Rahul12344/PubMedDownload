BACKGROUND: Artemisiae annuae herba (AAH) has been traditionally used as a drug
for the treatment of malaria, heat stroke, bacterial infection, and fever in
East-Asia. Although AAH has been used for the treatment of inflammation-related
symptoms, the underlying mechanism of antiinflammatory activity of AAH is still
unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether AAH have an inhibitory effect on the
production of pro-inflammatory mediators in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW
264.7 macrophage cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The investigation was forced on the inhibitory effect of
AAH on the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6,
nitric oxide (NO), and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in macrophages. Furthermore, 
we examined the effect of AAH on the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)
and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathways.
RESULTS: We found that AAH suppresses NO production and TNF-α, IL-6, and iNOS
gene expression. Moreover, AAH inhibited the nuclear translocation of p65 and
IκBα degradation in NF-κB pathway and decreased the extracellular
signal-regulated kinase, p38, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase phosphorylation in MAPK
signaling pathway.
CONCLUSIONS: Consequently, these results indicate that AAH contains
antiinflammatory activity and this effect is derived from the repression on the
activation of NF-κB and MAPKs pathways. We first demonstrated that
antiinflammatory effect of AAH and its underlying mechanism in macrophage cells.
