BACKGROUND: In Mali, Plasmodium falciparum malaria is highly endemic and remains 
stable despite the implementation of various malaria control measures.
Understanding P. falciparum population structure variations across the country
could provide new insights to guide malaria control programmes. In this study, P.
falciparum genetic diversity and population structure in regions of varying
patterns of malaria transmission in Mali were analysed.
METHODS: A total of 648 blood isolates adsorbed onto filter papers during
population surveillance surveys (December 2012-March 2013, October 2013) in four 
distinct sites of Mali were screened for the presence of P. falciparum via
quantitative PCR (qPCR). Multiple loci variable number of tandem repeats analysis
(MLVA) using eight microsatellite markers was then performed on positive qPCR
samples. Complete genotypes were then analysed for genetic diversity, genetic
differentiation and linkage disequilibrium.
RESULTS: Of 156 qPCR-positive samples, complete genotyping of 112 samples was
achieved. The parasite populations displayed high genetic diversity (mean
He = 0.77), which was consistent with a high level of malaria transmission in
Mali. Genetic differentiation was low (FST < 0.02), even between sites located
approximately 900 km apart, thereby illustrating marked gene flux amongst
parasite populations. The lack of linkage disequilibrium further revealed an
absence of local clonal expansion, which was corroborated by the genotype
relationship results. In contrast to the stable genetic diversity level observed 
throughout the country, mean multiplicity of infection increased from north to
south (from 1.4 to 2.06) and paralleled malaria transmission levels observed
locally.
CONCLUSIONS: In Mali, the high level of genetic diversity and the pronounced gene
flux amongst P. falciparum populations may represent an obstacle to control
malaria. Indeed, results suggest that parasite populations are polymorphic enough
to adapt to their host and to counteract interventions, such as anti-malarial
vaccination. Additionally, the panmictic parasite population structure imply that
resistance traits may disseminate freely from one area to another, making control
measures performed at a local level ineffective.
