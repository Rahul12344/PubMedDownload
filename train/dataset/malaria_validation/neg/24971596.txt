Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite of humans and animals, and a model for other
apicomplexans including Plasmodium spp., the causative agents of malaria. Despite
many advances, manipulating the T. gondii genome remains labor intensive, and is 
often restricted to lab-adapted strains or lines carrying mutations that enable
selection. Here, we use the RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease to efficiently generate
knockouts without selection, and to introduce point mutations and epitope tags
into the T. gondii genome. These methods will streamline the functional analysis 
of parasite genes and enable high-throughput engineering of their genomes.
