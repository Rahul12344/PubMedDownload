The importance of guanylyl-cyclases (GCs) in apicomplexa has remained elusive due
to the large size of the genes. Two recent studies, including Brown and Sibley,
2018 in this issue of Cell Host & Microbe, make elegant use of genome editing
with CRISPR-Cas9 to characterize roles of GCs in Toxoplasma and Plasmodium.
