BACKGROUND: The monitoring of Plasmodium falciparum sensitivity to anti-malarial 
drugs is a necessity for effective case management of malaria. This species is
characterized by a strong resistance to anti-malarial drugs. In Senegal, the
first cases of chloroquine resistance were reported in the Dakar region in 1988
with nearly 7% population prevalence, reaching 47% by 1990. It is in this context
that sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine temporarily replaced chloroquine as first line
treatment in 2003, pending the introduction of artemisinin-based combination
therapy in 2006. The purpose of this study is to assess the ex vivo sensitivity
to different anti-malarial drugs of the P. falciparum population from Pikine.
METHODS: Fifty-four samples were collected from patients with non-complicated
malaria and aged between 2 and 20 years in the Deggo health centre in Pikine in
2014. An assay in which parasites are stained with 4',
6-di-amidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), was used to study the ex vivo sensitivity of 
isolates to chloroquine, amodiaquine, piperaquine, pyrimethamine, and
dihydroartemisinin. High resolution melting was used for genotyping of pfdhps,
pfdhfr, pfmdr1, and pfcrt genes.
RESULTS: The mean IC50s of chloroquine, amodiaquine, piperaquine,
dihydroartemisinin, and pyrimethamine were, respectively, 39.44, 54.02, 15.28,
2.23, and 64.70 nM. Resistance mutations in pfdhfr gene, in codon 437 of pfdhps
gene, and an absence of mutation at position 540 of pfdhps were observed.
Mutations in codons K76T of pfcrt and N86Y of pfmdr1 were observed at 51 and 11% 
population prevalence, respectively. A relationship was found between the K76T
and N86Y mutations and ex vivo resistance to chloroquine.
CONCLUSION: An increase in sensitivity of isolates to chloroquine was observed. A
high sensitivity to dihydroartemisinin was observed; whereas, a decrease in
sensitivity to pyrimethamine was observed in the parasite population from Pikine.
