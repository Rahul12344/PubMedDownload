BACKGROUND: Avian malaria occurs almost worldwide and is caused by Haemosporida
parasites (Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon). Vectors such as
mosquitoes, hippoboscid flies or biting midges are required for the transmission 
of these parasites. There are few studies about avian malaria parasites on
Madagascar but none about suitable vectors.
METHODS: To identify vectors of avian Plasmodium parasites on Madagascar, we
examined head, thorax and abdomen of 418 mosquitoes from at least 18 species
using a nested PCR method to amplify a 524 bp fragment of the haemosporidian
mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Sequences obtained were then compared with a
large dataset of haemosporidian sequences detected in 45 different bird species
(n = 686) from the same area in the Maromizaha rainforest.
RESULTS: Twenty-one mosquitoes tested positive for avian malaria parasites.
Haemoproteus DNA was found in nine mosquitoes (2.15%) while Plasmodium DNA was
found in 12 mosquitoes (2.87%). Seven distinct lineages were identified among the
Plasmodium DNA samples. Some lineages were also found in the examined bird
samples: Plasmodium sp. WA46 (EU810628.1) in the Madagascar bulbul, Plasmodium
sp. mosquito 132 (AB308050.1) in 15 bird species belonging to eight families,
Plasmodium sp. PV12 (GQ150194.1) in eleven bird species belonging to eight
families and Plasmodium sp. P31 (DQ839060.1) was found in three weaver bird
species.
CONCLUSION: This study provides the first insight into avian malaria transmission
in the Maromizaha rainforest in eastern Madagascar. Five Haemoproteus lineages
and seven Plasmodium lineages were detected in the examined mosquitoes. Complete 
life-cycles for the specialist lineages WA46 and P31 and for the generalist
lineages mosquito132 and PV12 of Plasmodium are proposed. In addition, we have
identified for the first time Anopheles mascarensis and Uranotaenia spp. as
vectors for avian malaria and offer the first description of vector mosquitoes
for avian malaria in Madagascar.
