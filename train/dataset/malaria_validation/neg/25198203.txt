ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters serve a variety of physiological
functions as well as play key roles in drug resistance. The genome of the human
malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, encodes multiple members of this family,
one of which, gABCG2, is transcribed predominantly in the gametocyte stage. Here 
we use gene deletion and tagging to investigate the expression, localization and 
function of gABCG2. The protein is found in a single dot-like lipid-rich
structure within female, but not male, gametocytes. gABCG2-knockout cell lines
produce more gametocytes of both sexes. By contrast, cholesteryl esters,
diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols are significantly reduced in gABCG2-knockout
gametocyte stages. We propose a role for gABCG2 in the regulation of gametocyte
numbers and in the accumulation of neutral lipids, which are likely important for
parasite development in the insect stages of the parasite life cycle.
