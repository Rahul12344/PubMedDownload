The genetic polymorphisms of the candidate markers of antimalarial drug
resistance pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfatp6, and pfmrp1 were investigated in relationship
with in vitro susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum isolates and clinical
response following artesunate (AS)-mefloquine (MQ) combination in 21 and 27
samples obtained from patients with recrudescence and adequate clinical response,
respectively. MQ (21.0 vs. 49.9nM) and AS (1.6 vs. 2.8nM) IC50 values
(concentrations that inhibit parasite growth by 50%) were significantly higher in
isolates collected from patients with recrudescence. Furthermore, a significantly
higher MQ IC50 was found in isolates from patients with recrudescence that
carried pfmrp1 mutations at amino acid residues 191Y, 437A, and 876V. For AS
sensitivity, a significant association was also detected in isolates from
patients with recrudescence that carried gene mutations at amino acid residues
437A and 876V. MQ IC50 of the isolates with recrudescence which carried ≥4 pfmdr1
gene copies was significantly higher than that carrying only one gene copy. In
addition, a significantly higher proportion of isolates carrying one gene copy
was detected in the group with adequate clinical response compared with
recrudescence. Results from this limited sample size suggested the potential link
between pfmdr1 gene copy number and pfmrp1 gene mutation, in vitro parasite
susceptibility, and AS-MQ treatment response.
