In 2008, dihydroartemisinin (DHA)-piperaquine (PPQ) became the first-line
treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in western Cambodia.
Recent reports of increased treatment failure rates after DHA-PPQ therapy in this
region suggest that parasite resistance to DHA, PPQ, or both is now adversely
affecting treatment. While artemisinin (ART) resistance is established in western
Cambodia, there is no evidence of PPQ resistance. To monitor for resistance to
PPQ and other antimalarials, we measured drug susceptibilities for parasites
collected in 2011 and 2012 from Pursat, Preah Vihear, and Ratanakiri, in western,
northern, and eastern Cambodia, respectively. Using a SYBR green I fluorescence
assay, we calculated the ex vivo 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of 310
parasites to six antimalarials: chloroquine (CQ), mefloquine (MQ), quinine (QN), 
PPQ, artesunate (ATS), and DHA. Geometric mean IC50s (GMIC50s) for all drugs
(except PPQ) were significantly higher in Pursat and Preah Vihear than in
Ratanakiri (P â‰¤ 0.001). An increased copy number of P. falciparum mdr1 (pfmdr1), 
an MQ resistance marker, was more prevalent in Pursat and Preah Vihear than in
Ratanakiri and was associated with higher GMIC50s for MQ, QN, ATS, and DHA. An
increased copy number of a chromosome 5 region (X5r), a candidate PPQ resistance 
marker, was detected in Pursat but was not associated with reduced susceptibility
to PPQ. The ex vivo IC50 and pfmdr1 copy number are important tools in the
surveillance of multidrug-resistant (MDR) parasites in Cambodia. While MDR P.
falciparum is prevalent in western and northern Cambodia, there is no evidence
for PPQ resistance, suggesting that DHA-PPQ treatment failures result mainly from
ART resistance.
