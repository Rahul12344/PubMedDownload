This chapter discusses the emerging field of vector-mediated antibody gene
transfer as an alternative vaccine for infectious disease, with a specific focus 
on HIV. However, this methodology need not be confined to HIV-1; the general
strategy of vector-mediated antibody gene transfer can be applied to other
difficult vaccine targets like hepatitis C virus, malaria, respiratory syncytial 
virus, and tuberculosis. This approach is an improvement over classical passive
immunization strategies that administer antibody proteins to the host to provide 
protection from infection. With vector-mediated gene transfer, the antibody gene 
is delivered to the host, via a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector;
this in turn results in long-term endogenous antibody expression from the
injected muscle that confers protective immunity. Vector-mediated antibody gene
transfer can rapidly move existing, potent broadly cross-neutralizing
HIV-1-specific antibodies into the clinic. The gene transfer products demonstrate
a potency and breadth identical to the original product. This strategy eliminates
the need for immunogen design and interaction with the adaptive immune system to 
generate protection, a strategy that so far has shown limited promise.
