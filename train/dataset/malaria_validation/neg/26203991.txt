Plasmodium vivax is the most common cause of malaria worldwide as well as
southeastern Turkey. After the implementation of a successful national
elimination program that the local malaria cases were not reported in 2011,
malaria returned to county of Savur located in southeastern Turkey in summer of
2012. The present study aimed to determine the prevalent P. vivax genotypes
isolated from southeastern Turkey. Genetic polymorphism in P. vivax CSP gene was 
analyzed by PCR-RFLP to assess the ratio of VK210 and VK247 types. Blood samples 
were obtained from 15 patients who lived in southeastern between 2005-2006.
According to the results, VK210 type was detected in 10 samples (66.6%), VK247
type was observed in three samples (20%). Remaining two samples showed mixed
infection (13.3%). The results of the present study first time showed the ratio
of P. vivax genotypes in southeastern Turkey before the elimination in 2011. The 
results of the present study will be enable researchers to compare the new
isolates with the previously detected ones and design new treatment
and/elimination strategies.
