The rapid and accurate diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria infection is an
essential factor in malaria control. Currently, malaria diagnosis in the field
depends heavily on using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) many of which detect
circulating parasite-derived histidine-rich protein 2 antigen (PfHRP2) in
capillary blood. P. falciparum strains lacking PfHRP2, due to pfhrp2 gene
deletions, are an emerging threat to malaria control programs. The novel assay
described here, named qHRP2/3-del, is well suited for high-throughput screening
of P. falciparum isolates to identify these gene deletions. The qHRP2/3-del assay
identified pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletion status correctly in 93.4% of samples with
parasitemia levels higher than 5 parasites/ÂµL when compared to nested PCR. The
qHRP2/3-del assay can correctly identify pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletions in
multiple strain co-infections, particularly prevalent in Sub-Saharan countries.
Deployment of this qHRP2/3-del assay will provide rapid insight into the
prevalence and potential spread of P. falciparum isolates that escape
surveillance by RDTs.
