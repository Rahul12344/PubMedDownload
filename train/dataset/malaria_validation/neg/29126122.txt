Haemosporidians are a diverse group of vector-borne parasitic protozoa that
includes the agents of human malaria; however, most of the described species are 
found in birds and reptiles. Although our understanding of these parasites'
diversity has expanded by analyses of their mitochondrial genes, there is limited
information on these genes' evolutionary rates. Here, 114 mitochondrial genomes
(mtDNA) were studied from species belonging to four genera: Leucocytozoon,
Haemoproteus, Hepatocystis, and Plasmodium. Contrary to previous assertions, the 
mtDNA is phylogenetically informative. The inferred phylogeny showed that, like
the genus Plasmodium, the Leucocytozoon and Haemoproteus genera are not
monophyletic groups. Although sensitive to the assumptions of the molecular
dating method used, the estimated times indicate that the diversification of the 
avian haemosporidian subgenera/genera took place after the Cretaceous-Paleogene
boundary following the radiation of modern birds. Furthermore, parasite clade
differences in mtDNA substitution rates and strength of negative selection were
detected. These differences may affect the biological interpretation of mtDNA
gene lineages used as a proxy to species in ecological and parasitological
investigations. Given that the mitochondria are critically important in the
parasite life cycle stages that take place in the vector and that the
transmission of parasites belonging to particular clades has been linked to
specific insect families/subfamilies, this study suggests that differences in
vectors have affected the mode of evolution of haemosporidian mtDNA genes. The
observed patterns also suggest that the radiation of haemosporidian parasites may
be the result of community-level evolutionary processes between their vertebrate 
and invertebrate hosts.
