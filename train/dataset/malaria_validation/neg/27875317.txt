CYP2D6 variability in populations from Venezuela.

Moreno N, Flores-Angulo C, Villegas C, Mora Y.

CYP2D6 is an important cytochrome P450 enzyme that plays an important role in the
metabolism of about 25% of currently prescribed drugs. The presence of
polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene may modulate enzyme level and activity, thereby 
affecting individual responses to pharmacological treatments. The most prevalent 
diseases in the admixed population from Venezuela are cardiovascular and cancer, 
whereas viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases, particularly malaria, are
prevalent in Amerindian populations; in the treatment of these diseases, several 
drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 are used. In this work, we reviewed the data
on CYP2D6 variability and predicted metabolizer phenotypes, in healthy volunteers
of two admixed and five Amerindian populations from Venezuela. The Venezuelan
population is very heterogeneous as a result of the genetic admixture of three
major ethnical components: Europeans, Africans and Amerindians. There are
noticeable inter-regional and inter-population differences in the process of
mixing of this population. Hitherto, there are few published studies in Venezuela
on CYP2D6; therefore, it is necessary to increase research in this regard, in
particular to develop studies with a larger sample size. There is a considerable 
amount of work remaining before CYP2D6 is integrated into clinical practice in
Venezuela.
