Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae producing extended-spectrum
β-lactamases (ESBLs) are among the most multidrug-resistant pathogens in
hospitals and are spreading worldwide. Horizontal gene transfer and spread of
high-risk clones are involved in ESBL dissemination. Investigation of the
resistance phenotypes of 101 consecutive clinical E. coli (n=58) and K.
pneumoniae (n=43) isolated at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Ghana over 3 
months revealed 63 (62%) with an ESBL phenotype. All 63 had a blaCTX-M gene, and 
sequence analysis showed that 62 of these were blaCTX-M-15. blaCTX-M-15 was
linked to ISEcp1 and orf477Δ in all isolates, and most isolates also carried
blaTEM, aac(3)-II, aacA4cr, and/or blaOXA-30 genes on IncF plasmids.
XbaI/pulsed-field electrophoresis showed heterogeneity among isolates of both
species, suggesting that blaCTX-M-15 dissemination is caused by horizontal gene
transfer rather than clonal spread of these species in Ghana.
