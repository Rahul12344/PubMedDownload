The actomyosin motor complex of the glideosome provides the force needed by
apicomplexan parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii (Tg) and Plasmodium falciparum
(Pf) to invade their host cells and for gliding motility of their motile forms.
Glideosome Associated Protein 45 (PfGAP45) is an essential component of the
glideosome complex as it facilitates anchoring and effective functioning of the
motor. Dissection of events that regulate PfGAP45 may provide insights into how
the motor and the glideosome operate. We found that PfGAP45 is phosphorylated in 
response to Phospholipase C (PLC) and calcium signaling. It is phosphorylated by 
P. falciparum kinases Protein Kinase B (PfPKB) and Calcium Dependent Protein
Kinase 1 (PfCDPK1), which are calcium dependent enzymes, at S89, S103 and S149.
The Phospholipase C pathway influenced the phosphorylation of S103 and S149. The 
phosphorylation of PfGAP45 at these sites is differentially regulated during
parasite development. The localization of PfGAP45 and its association may be
independent of the phosphorylation of these sites. PfGAP45 regulation in response
to calcium fits in well with the previously described role of calcium in host
cell invasion by malaria parasite.
