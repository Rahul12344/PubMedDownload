The variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) provides valuable information about
both the functional and evolutionary aspects of genetic diversity. Comparative
analysis of 3 Plasmodium falciparum genomes has shown that more than 9% of its
open reading frames (ORFs) harbor VNTRs. Although microsatellites and VNTR genes 
of P. vivax were reported, the VNTR polymorphism of genes has not been examined
widely. In this study, 230 P. vivax genes were analyzed for VNTRs by SERV, and 33
kinds of TR deletions or insertions from 29 P. vivax genes (12.6%) were found. Of
these, 9 VNTR fragments from 8 P. vivax genes were used for PCR amplification and
sequence analysis to examine the genetic diversity among 134 isolates from four
Southeast Asian countries (China, Republic of Korea, Thailand, and Myanmar) with 
different malaria endemicity. We confirmed the existence of extensive
polymorphism of VNTR fragments in field isolates. This detection provides several
suitable markers for analysis of the molecular epidemiology of P. vivax field
isolates.
