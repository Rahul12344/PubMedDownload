BACKGROUND: Transgenic Plasmodium falciparum expressing luciferase offers an
attractive bioluminescence-based assay platform for the investigation of the
pharmacological properties of anti-malarial drugs. Here a side-by-side comparison
of bioluminescence and fluorescence-based assays, utilizing a luciferase reporter
cassette that confers a strong temporal pattern of luciferase expression during
the S-phase of intraerythrocytic development, is reported.
METHODS: Key assay parameters for a range of commercially available luminogenic
substrates are determined and compared to those measured using a Malaria Sybr
Green I fluorescence assay. In addition, the short-term temporal effects of
anti-malarial compounds are evaluated using both bioluminescent and fluorescent
assay platforms.
RESULTS: The Z', % coefficient of variation and 50% inhibition concentrations are
essentially the same for bioluminescent and fluorescent assays in transgenic
parasites generated in both chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant genetic
backgrounds. Bioluminescent assays, irrespective of the luminogenic agent
employed, do, however, offer significantly enhanced signal-to-noise ratios.
Moreover, the bioluminescent assay is more dynamic in terms of determining
temporal effects immediately following drug perturbation.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that opportunities for bioluminescence-based
assays lie not in the measurement of 50% inhibition concentrations, where the
cheaper fluorescence assay performs excellently and is not restricted by the need
to genetically modify the parasite clone under investigation. Instead, assays
that use the dynamic response of the luciferase reporter for semi-automated
screening of additional pharmacological properties, such as relative rate-of-kill
and lethal dose estimation, are a more attractive development opportunity.
