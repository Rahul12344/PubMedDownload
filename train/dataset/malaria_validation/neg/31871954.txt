The severity of Plasmodium falciparum malaria is associated with parasite
cytoadherence, but there is limited knowledge about the effect of parasite
cytoadherence in malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Our objective was to evaluate the cytoadherence of infected red blood cells
(iRBCs) in a murine model of ARDS and to appraise a potential function of
endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) in ARDS pathogenesis. DBA/2 mice infected
with P. berghei ANKA were classified as ARDS- or hyperparasitemia- (HP-)
developing mice according to respiratory parameters and parasitemia. Lungs,
blood, and bronchoalveolar lavage were collected for gene expression or protein
analyses. Primary cultures of microvascular lung endothelial cells from DBA/2
mice were analyzed for iRBC interactions. Lungs from ARDS-developing mice showed 
evidence of iRBC accumulation along with an increase in EPCR and TNF
concentrations. Furthermore, TNF increased iRBC adherence in vitro.
Dexamethasone-treated infected mice showed low levels of TNF and EPCR mRNA
expression and, finally, decreased vascular permeability, thus protecting mice
from ARDS. In conclusion, we identified that increased iRBC cytoadherence in the 
lungs underlies malaria-associated ARDS in DBA/2-infected mice and that
inflammation increased cytoadherence capacity, suggesting a participation of EPCR
and a conceivable target for drug development.
