Plasmodium falciparum HKMTs (PfHKMTs) play a key role in controlling Plasmodium
gene expression and represent exciting new anti-malarial epigenetic targets.
Using an inhibitor series derived from the diaminoquinazoline HKMT inhibitory
chemotype, we have previously identified compounds with highly promising
antimalarial activity, including irreversible asexual cycle blood
stage-independent cytotoxic activity at nM concentrations, oral efficacy in in
vivo models of disease, and the unprecedented ability to reactivate dormant liver
stage parasites (hypnozoites). However, future development of this series will
need to address host versus parasite selectivity, where inhibitory activity
against human G9a is removed from the lead compounds, while maintaining potent
anti-Plasmodium activity. Herein, we report an extensive study of the SAR of this
series against both G9a and P. falciparum. We have identified key SAR features
which demonstrate that high parasite vs. G9a selectivity can be achieved by
selecting appropriate substituents at position 2, 4 and 7 of the quinazoline
ring. We have also, in turn, discovered that potent G9a inhibitors can be
identified by employing a 6-carbon 'Nle mimic' at position 7. Together, this data
suggests that while broadly similar, the G9a and potential PfHKMT target(s)
binding pockets and/or binding modes of the diaminoquinazoline analogues exhibit 
clear and exploitable differences. Based on this, we believe this scaffold to
have clear potential for development into a novel anti-malarial therapeutic.
