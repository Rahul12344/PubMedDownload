BACKGROUND: A highly efficient CRISPR/Cas9-based marker-free genome editing
system has been established in Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). However, with the
current methods, two drug-selectable markers are needed for episome retention,
which may present hurdles for consecutive genome manipulations due to the limited
number of available selectable markers. The loading capacity of donor DNA is also
unsatisfactory due to the large size of the Cas9 nuclease and sgRNA co-expression
system, which limits the size of knock-in DNA fragments. Because of the
inefficient end joining (EJ) DNA repair mechanism of Pf, a suicide-rescue
approach could be used to address the challenges. Cas9 nuclease and sgRNA were
co-expressed from a single plasmid (suicide vector) with one selectable marker,
and the donor DNA was ligated into the other plasmid (rescue vector) containing
only the ampicillin-resistance gene (AmpR) and a ColEl replication origin (ori). 
Nonetheless, whether this approach can mediate even the regular gene editing in
Pf remains unknown. This study aimed to demonstrate the basic gene editing
function of this Cas9-mediated suicide-rescue system.
FINDINGS: The suicide and rescue vectors were constructed and co-transfected into
Pf3D7. This system worked as expected when used to disrupt the Pfset2 gene and to
insert a green fluorescent protein-renilla luciferase (gfp-ruc) fusion gene
cassette of 3334 base pairs (bp) into the Pf47 locus, demonstrating that the
suicide vector actually induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) and that the rescue
vector functioned without maintenance via drug selection.
CONCLUSIONS: The adapted marker-free CRISPR/Cas9 system with only a single
episome-selectable marker performs well as the current systems for general gene
editing which lays a solid foundation for further studies including consecutive
gene manipulations and large gene knock-ins.
