This study reports the case of a Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus) that died
from avian malaria while under care at a rehabilitation center in Espírito Santo,
Brazil. The bird was rescued on October 2018, and remained under care until it
died suddenly on January 2019. A blood smear produced 8 days before death was
negative for parasites, whereas a blood smear produced post-mortem revealed a
high parasitemia by a parasite resembling Plasmodium cathemerium. The sequence of
a 412 bp segment of the cyt-b gene was identical to that of lineage PADOM09, and 
phylogenetic analysis corroborated that this parasite was closely-related to
known lineages of P. cathemerium. The acuteness and severity of the infection
documented in this case suggest that seabirds of the order Procellariiformes
might be highly susceptible to Plasmodium infections, raising the concern that
avian malaria may present a significant threat to their conservation.
