Plasmodium vivax is the second major human malaria parasite that inflicts
debilitating morbidity and consequent economic impact in South-East Asian
countries. The relapsing nature of P. vivax along with the emergence of
drug-resistant P. vivax strains has emphasized the urgent need for a vaccine.
However, the development of an effective vivax vaccine is seriously hampered due 
to the diversity and variation in parasite antigens and non-availability of
suitable animal models. DNA based vaccines represent an alternative approach in
inducing immunity to multiple targets from different stages of malaria parasite. 
DNA prime-boosting strategies induce both antibody mediated and cell-mediated
immune responses that are the major mechanisms of protection against malaria
parasites. We have earlier studied the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of 
the soluble and refolded forms of recombinant 42kDa fragment of Plasmodium vivax 
merozoite surface protein-1 (PvMSP-142) using P. cynomolgi rhesus monkey model.
In the present study, we have constructed a recombinant DNA vaccine encoding
42kDa fragment of P. vivax MSP-1 and studied the immunogenicity of PvMSP-142 DNA 
vaccine construct in mice. The 42kDa gene fragment of PvMSP-1 was PCR amplified
using gene specific primers and subcloned into pcDNA 3.1 (+) eukaryotic
expression vector. In vitro expression of PvMSP-142 plasmid construct was checked
by transfection in COS-1 cell line. Indirect immunofluorescence of transfected
COS-1 cells probed with monoclonal antibodies against PvMSP-142 exhibited
positive fluorescence. Immunization of BALB/c mice with PvMSP-142-pcDNA vaccine
construct revealed the immunogenicity of recombinant vaccine plasmid that can be 
enhanced by prime boosting with recombinant protein corresponding to the DNA
vaccine as evidenced by significant elevation of antibody and the cytokines
responses.
