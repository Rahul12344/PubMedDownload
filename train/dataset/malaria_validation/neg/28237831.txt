Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) is still used for malaria control in sub-Saharan
Africa; however, widespread resistance is a major concern. This study aimed to
determine the dispersal and origin of sulfadoxine resistance lineages in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo compared with East African Plasmodium falciparum
dihydropteroate synthetase (Pfdhps) haplotypes. The analysis involved 264
isolates collected from patients with uncomplicated malaria from Tanzania, Uganda
and DR Congo. Isolates were genotyped for Pfdhps mutations at codons 436, 437,
540, 581 and 613. Three microsatellite loci (0.8, 4.3 and 7.7 kb) flanking the
Pfdhps gene were assayed. Evolutionary analysis revealed a shared origin of
Pfdhps haplotypes in East Africa, with a distinct population clustering in DR
Congo. Furthermore, in Tanzania there was an independent distinct origin of
Pfdhps SGEGA resistant haplotype. In Uganda and Tanzania, gene flow patterns
contribute to the dispersal and shared origin of parasites carrying double- and
triple-mutant Pfdhps haplotypes associated with poor outcomes of intermittent
preventive treatment during pregnancy using SP (IPTp-SP). However, the origins of
the Pfdhps haplotypes in DR Congo and Eastern Africa sites are different. The
genetic structure demonstrated a divergent and distinct population cluster
predominated by single-mutant Pfdhps haplotypes at the DR Congo site. This
reflects the limited dispersal of double- and triple-mutant Pfdhps haplotypes in 
DR Congo. This study highlights the current genetic structure and dispersal of
high-grade Pfdhps resistant haplotypes, which is important to guide
implementation of SP in malaria chemoprevention strategies in the region.
