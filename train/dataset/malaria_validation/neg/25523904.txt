Plasmodium vivax is the most prevalent human malaria parasite outside of Africa. 
Yet, studies aimed to identify genes with signatures consistent with natural
selection are rare. Here, we present a comparative analysis of the pattern of
genetic variation of five sequenced isolates of P. vivax and its divergence with 
two closely related species, Plasmodium cynomolgi and Plasmodium knowlesi, using 
a set of orthologous genes. In contrast to Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite
that causes the most lethal form of human malaria, we did not find significant
constraints on the evolution of synonymous sites genome wide in P. vivax. The
comparative analysis of polymorphism and divergence across loci allowed us to
identify 87 genes with patterns consistent with positive selection, including
genes involved in the "exportome" of P. vivax, which are potentially involved in 
evasion of the host immune system. Nevertheless, we have found a pattern of
polymorphism genome wide that is consistent with a significant amount of
constraint on the replacement changes and prevalent negative selection. Our
analyses also show that silent polymorphism tends to be larger toward the ends of
the chromosomes, where many genes involved in antigenicity are located,
suggesting that natural selection acts not only by shaping the patterns of
variation within the genes but it also affects genome organization.
