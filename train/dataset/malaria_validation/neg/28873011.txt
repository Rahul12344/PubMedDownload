Malaria remains a grand challenge for disruptive innovation in global health
therapeutics and diagnostics. Anopheles stephensi is one of the major vectors of 
malaria in Asia. Vector and transmission control are key focus areas in the fight
against malaria, a field of postgenomics research where proteomics can play a
substantive role. Moreover, to identify novel strategies to control the vector
population, it is necessary to understand the vector life processes at a global
and molecular scale. In this context, fat body is a vital organ required for
vitellogenesis, vector immunity, vector physiology, and vector-parasite
interaction. Given its central role in energy metabolism, vitellogenesis, and
immune function, the proteome profile of the fat body and the impact of blood
meal (BM) ingestion on the protein abundances of this vital organ have not been
investigated so far. Therefore, using a proteomics approach, we identified the
proteins expressed in the fat body of An. stephensi and their differential
expression in response to BM ingestion. In all, we identified 3,218 proteins in
the fat body using high-resolution mass spectrometry, of which 483 were found to 
be differentially expressed in response to the BM ingestion. Bioinformatics
analysis of these proteins underscored their role in amino acid metabolism,
vitellogenesis, lipid transport, signal peptide processing, mosquito immunity,
and oxidation-reduction processes. Interestingly, we identified five novel genes,
which were found to be differentially expressed upon BM ingestion. Proteins that 
exhibited altered expression in the present study are potential targets for
vector control strategies and development of transmission blocking vaccines in
the fight against malaria.
