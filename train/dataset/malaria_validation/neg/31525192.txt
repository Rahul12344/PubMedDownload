Strongyloidiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the human infective
nematodes Strongyloides stercoralis, Strongyloides fuelleborni fuelleborni and
Strongyloides fuelleborni kellyi. Previous large-scale studies exploring the
genetic diversity of this important genus have focused on Southeast Asia, with a 
small number of isolates from the USA, Switzerland, Australia and several African
countries having been genotyped. Consequently, little is known about the global
distribution of geographic sub-variants of these nematodes and the genetic
diversity that exists within the genus Strongyloides generally. We extracted DNA 
from human, dog and primate feces containing Strongyloides, collected from
several countries representing all inhabited continents. Using a genotyping assay
adapted for deep amplicon sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform, we sequenced
the hyper-variable I and hyper-variable IV regions of the Strongyloides 18S rRNA 
gene and a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1)
gene from these specimens. We report several novel findings including unique S.
stercoralis and S. fuelleborni genotypes, and the first identifications of a
previously unknown S. fuelleborni infecting humans within Australia. We expand on
an existing Strongyloides genotyping scheme to accommodate S. fuelleborni and
these novel genotypes. In doing so, we compare our data to all 18S and cox1
sequences of S. fuelleborni and S. stercoralis available in GenBank (to our
knowledge), that overlap with the sequences generated using our approach. As this
analysis represents more than 1,000 sequences collected from diverse hosts and
locations, representing all inhabited continents, it allows a truly global
understanding of the population genetic structure of the Strongyloides species
infecting humans, non-human primates, and domestic dogs.
