BACKGROUND: In humans it is unknown if the composition of the gut microbiota
alters the risk of Plasmodium falciparum infection or the risk of developing
febrile malaria once P. falciparum infection is established. Here we collected
stool samples from a cohort composed of 195 Malian children and adults just prior
to an intense P. falciparum transmission season. We assayed these samples using
massively parallel sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene to identify the
composition of the gut bacterial communities in these individuals. During the
ensuing 6-month P. falciparum transmission season we examined the relationship
between the stool microbiota composition of individuals in this cohort and their 
prospective risk of both P. falciparum infection and febrile malaria.
RESULTS: Consistent with prior studies, stool microbial diversity in the present 
cohort increased with age, although the overall microbiota profile was distinct
from cohorts in other regions of Africa, Asia and North America. Age-adjusted Cox
regression analysis revealed a significant association between microbiota
composition and the prospective risk of P. falciparum infection; however, no
relationship was observed between microbiota composition and the risk of
developing febrile malaria once P. falciparum infection was established.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the diversity of gut microbiota across
geographic regions, and suggest that strategic modulation of gut microbiota
composition could decrease the risk of P. falciparum infection in malaria-endemic
areas, potentially as an adjunct to partially effective malaria vaccines.
