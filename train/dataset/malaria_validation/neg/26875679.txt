Engineered gene drives - the process of stimulating the biased inheritance of
specific genes - have the potential to enable the spread of desirable genes
throughout wild populations or to suppress harmful species, and may be
particularly useful for the control of vector-borne diseases such as malaria.
Although several types of selfish genetic elements exist in nature, few have been
successfully engineered in the laboratory thus far. With the discovery of
RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats-CRISPR-associated 9) nucleases, which can be utilized to create,
streamline and improve synthetic gene drives, this is rapidly changing. Here, we 
discuss the different types of engineered gene drives and their potential
applications, as well as current policies regarding the safety and regulation of 
gene drives for the manipulation of wild populations.
