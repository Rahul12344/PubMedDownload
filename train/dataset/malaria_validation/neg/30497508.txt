BACKGROUND: The transmission of malaria to mosquitoes depends on the presence of 
gametocytes that circulate in the peripheral blood of infected human hosts.
Sensitive estimates of the densities of female gametocytes (FG) and male
gametocytes (MG) may allow the prediction of infectivity to mosquitoes and thus a
molecular estimate of the human infectious reservoir for transmission.
METHODS: A novel multiplex qRT-PCR assay with intron-spanning primers was
developed for the parallel quantification of FG and MG. CCp4 (PF3D7_0903800)
transcripts specific for FG and PfMGET (PF3D7_1469900) transcripts specific for
MG were quantified in total nucleic acids. The assay was validated on sex-sorted 
gametocytes from culture material and on samples from clinical trials with
gametocytocidal drugs. Synthetic RNA standards were generated for the two targets
genes and calibrated against known gametocyte quantities.
RESULTS: The limit of detection was determined at 0.1 male and 0.1 female
gametocyte/µL, which was equal to the limit of quantification (LOQ) for MG, while
the LOQ for FG was 1 FG/µL. Results from previously reported clinical trials that
used separate gametocyte qRT-PCR assays for FG (targeting Pfs25) and MG
(targeting PfMGET) were reproduced with the multiplex assay. High levels of
agreement between separate assays and the multiplex approach were observed
(R2 = 0.9473, 95% CI 0.9314-0.9632, for FG measured by transcript levels of Pfs25
in qRT-PCR or CCp4 in multiplex; R2 = 0.8869, 95% CI 0.8541-0.9197, for MG
measured by PfMGET in either single or multiplex qRT-PCR). FG and MG transcripts 
were detected in pure ring stage parasites at 10,000- and 100,000-fold reduced
frequency for CCp4 and PfMGET, respectively. The CCp4 and PfMGET transcripts were
equally stable under suboptimal storage conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Gametocyte densities and their sex ratios can be determined in the
presented one-step multiplex assay with higher throughput than single assays. The
interpretation of low gametocyte densities at asexual parasite densities above
1000 parasites/µL requires caution to avoid false positive gametocyte signals
from spurious transcript levels in ring stage parasites.
