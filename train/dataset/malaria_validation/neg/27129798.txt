OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the normal range of
chitotriosidase activity in the Cypriot population and the frequency of the 24bp 
duplication polymorphism. Furthermore, we compared the allele frequency of this
polymorphism in two locations with different malaria endemicity in the past.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma chitotriosidase activity was measured using a
fluorogenic substrate. The 24bp polymorphism was detected using PCR analysis of
exon 10 of the CHIT1 gene. Additional mutations were detected using direct
sequencing.
RESULTS: The normal range of chitotriosidase activity was found to be
9.5-44.0nmol/ml/hr. Among 114 normal individuals genotyped for the 24bp
duplication, 7% were found to be homozygous, 36% heterozygous and 57% wild type
(allele frequency 0.25). The allele frequency of this polymorphism in individuals
originating from two locations with different malaria endemicity in the past was 
not significantly different. A novel deletion mutation in the CHIT1 gene was
identified associated with loss of chitotriosidase activity. This new deletion
eliminates 29 nucleotides from exon 9 resulting in the generation of a premature 
stop codon, probably leading to the production of an aberrant protein molecule.
CONCLUSIONS: The normal range of chitotriosidase activity and the allele
frequency of the 24bp duplication polymorphism in the Cypriot population were
found to be similar to those of other Mediterranean populations. No evidence for 
an association between the presence of the 24bp duplication polymorphism and
susceptibility to malaria was found. A novel deletion in exon 9 of the CHIT1 gene
was identified (allele frequency 0.01).
