Regulatory roles of CDKs in fundamental processes including cell cycle
progression and transcription are well conserved in metazoans. This family of
proteins has undergone significant evolutionary divergence and specialization.
Several CDK-like kinases have been identified and characterized in parasitic
protozoans. However, clear functional role and physiological relevance of these
proteins in protozoans still remain elusive. In continuation with the recent
finding that CDK-like protein PfPK5 regulates important DNA replication protein
like origin recognition complex subunit 1 in Plasmodium falciparum, here we have 
discussed the emerging significance of CDK1/2 homologs in DNA replication of
parasitic protozoans. In fact, involvement of these proteins in crucial cellular 
processes projects them as potential drug targets. The possibilities that CDKs
offer as potential therapeutic targets in controlling parasite progression have
also been explored.
