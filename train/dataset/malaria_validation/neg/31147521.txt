Malaria control efforts require implementation of new technologies that manage
insecticide resistance. Metarhizium pingshaense provides an effective,
mosquito-specific delivery system for potent insect-selective toxins. A semifield
trial in a MosquitoSphere (a contained, near-natural environment) in Soumousso, a
region of Burkina Faso where malaria is endemic, confirmed that the expression of
an insect-specific toxin (Hybrid) increased fungal lethality and the likelihood
that insecticide-resistant mosquitoes would be eliminated from a site. Also, as
Hybrid-expressing M. pingshaense is effective at very low spore doses, its
efficacy lasted longer than that of the unmodified Metarhizium Deployment of
transgenic Metarhizium against mosquitoes could (subject to appropriate
registration) be rapid, with products that could synergistically integrate with
existing chemical control strategies to avert insecticide resistance.
