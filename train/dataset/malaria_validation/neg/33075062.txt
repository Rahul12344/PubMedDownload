BACKGROUND: Mass drug administration (MDA) can rapidly reduce the burden of
Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). However, concerns remain about its contribution to
select for antimalarial drug resistance.
METHODS: We used Sanger sequencing and real-time PCR to determine the proportion 
of molecular markers associated with antimalarial resistance (k13, pfpm2, pfmdr1 
and pfcrt) in Pf isolates collected before (n = 99) and after (n = 112) the
implementation of two monthly MDA rounds with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
(DHAp) for two consecutive years in Magude district of Southern Mozambique.
RESULTS: None of the k13 polymorphisms associated with artemisinin resistance
were observed in the Pf isolates analyzed. The proportion of Pf isolates with
multiple copies of pfpm2, an amplification associated with piperaquine
resistance, was similar in pre- (4.9%) and post-MDA groups (3.4%; p = 1.000). No 
statistically significant differences were observed between pre- and post-MDA
groups in the proportion of Pf isolates neither with mutations in pfcrt and
pfmdr1 genes, nor with the carriage of pfmdr1 multiple copies (p>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: This study does not show any evidence of increased frequency of
molecular makers of antimalarial resistance after MDA with DHAp in southern
Mozambique where markers of antimalarial resistance were absent or low at the
beginning of the intervention.
