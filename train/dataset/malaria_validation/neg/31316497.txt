T cells play significant roles during Plasmodium falciparum infections. Their
regulation of the immune response in symptomatic children with malaria has been
deemed necessary to prevent immune associated pathology. In this study, we
phenotypically characterized the expression of T cell inhibitory(PD-1, CTLA-4)
and senescent markers (CD28(-), CD57) from children with symptomatic malaria,
asymptomatic malaria and healthy controls using flow cytometry. We observed
increased expression of T cell exhaustion and senescence markers in the
symptomatic children compared to the asymptomatic and healthy controls. T cell
senescence markers were more highly expressed on CD8 T cells than on CD4 T cells.
Asymptomatically infected children had comparable levels of these markers with
healthy controls except for CD8+ PD-1+ T cells which were significantly elevated 
in the asymptomatic children. Also, using multivariate regression analysis,
CTLA-4 was the only marker that could predict parasitaemia level. The results
suggest that the upregulation of immune exhaustion and senescence markers during 
symptomatic malaria may affect the effector function of T cells leading to
inefficient clearance of parasites, hence the inability to develop sterile
immunity to malaria.
