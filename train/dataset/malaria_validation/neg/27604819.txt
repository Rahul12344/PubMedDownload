in human MDS but develop anemia without ring sideroblasts.

Heterozygous somatic mutations affecting the spliceosome gene SF3B1 drive
age-related clonal hematopoiesis, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and other
neoplasms. To study their role in such disorders, we generated knock-in mice with
hematopoietic-specific expression of Sf3b1-K700E, the commonest type of SF3B1
mutation in MDS. Sf3b1K700E/+ animals had impaired erythropoiesis and progressive
anemia without ringed sideroblasts, as well as reduced hematopoietic stem cell
numbers and host-repopulating fitness. To understand the molecular basis of these
observations, we analyzed global RNA splicing in Sf3b1K700E/+ hematopoietic
cells. Aberrant splicing was associated with the usage of cryptic 3' splice and
branchpoint sites, as described for human SF3B1 mutants. However, we found a
little overlap between aberrantly spliced mRNAs in mouse versus human, suggesting
that anemia may be a consequence of globally disrupted splicing. Furthermore, the
murine orthologues of genes associated with ring sideroblasts in human MDS,
including Abcb7 and Tmem14c, were not aberrantly spliced in Sf3b1K700E/+ mice.
Our findings demonstrate that, despite significant differences in affected
transcripts, there is overlap in the phenotypes associated with SF3B1-K700E
between human and mouse. Future studies should focus on understanding the basis
of these similarities and differences as a means of deciphering the consequences 
of spliceosome gene mutations in MDS.
