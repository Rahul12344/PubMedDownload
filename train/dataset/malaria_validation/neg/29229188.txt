Malaria is caused by infection with Plasmodium parasites that have a complex life
cycle. The parasite protein P47 is critical for disease transmission. P47
mediates mosquito immune evasion in both Plasmodium berghei (Pbs47) and
Plasmodium falciparum (Pfs47), and has been shown to be important for optimal
female gamete fertility in P. berghei. Pfs47 presents strong geographic structure
in natural P. falciparum populations, consistent with natural selection of Pfs47 
haplotypes by the mosquito immune system as the parasite adapted to new vector
species worldwide. These key functions make Plasmodium P47 an attractive target
to disrupt malaria transmission.
