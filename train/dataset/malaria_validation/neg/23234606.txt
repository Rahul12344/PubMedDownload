BACKGROUND: Prompt treatment of malaria attacks with arteminisin-based
combination therapy (ACT) is an essential tool for malaria control. A new
co-blister tablet of artesunate-mefloquine (AM) with 25 mg/kg mefloquine has been
developed for the management of uncomplicated malaria attacks. This
non-inferiority randomized trial, was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and
safety of the new formulation of AM in comparison to artemether-lumefantrine (AL)
for the treatment of acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in adults 
in Senegal.
METHODS: The study was carried out from September to December 2010 in two health 
centres in Senegal. The study end points included (i) PCR corrected adequate
clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) at day 28, (ii) ACPR at days 42 and 
63, (iii) parasites and fever clearance time, (iv) incidence of adverse events
and patients biological profile at day 7 using the WHO 2003 protocol for
anti-malarial drug evaluation.
RESULTS: Overall, 310 patients were randomized to receive either AM (n = 157) or 
AL (n = 153). PCR corrected ACPR at day 28 was at 95.5% in the AM arm while that 
in the AL arm was at 96.7% (p = 0.83). Therapeutic efficacy was at 98.5% in the
AM arm versus 98.2% in the AL group at day 42 (p = 1). At day 63, ACPR in the AM 
and AL arms was at 98.2% and 97.7%, respectively (p = 0.32). The two treatments
were well tolerated with similar biological profile at day 7. However, dizziness 
was more frequent in the AM arm.
CONCLUSION: Artesunate-mefloquine (25 mg/Kg mefloquine) is efficacious and
well-tolerated for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in adult 
patients.
