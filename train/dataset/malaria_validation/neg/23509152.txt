Pfs25 is a leading candidate for a malaria transmission-blocking vaccine whose
potential has been demonstrated in a phase 1 trial with recombinant Pfs25
formulated with Montanide ISA51. Because of limited sequence polymorphism, the
anti-Pfs25 antibodies induced by this vaccine are likely to have
transmission-blocking or -reducing activity against most, if not all, field
isolates. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated transmission-blocking activities 
by membrane feeding assay of anti-Pfs25 plasma from the Pfs25/ISA51 phase 1 trial
against Plasmodium falciparum parasites from patients in two different
geographical regions of the world, Thailand and Burkina Faso. In parallel,
parasite isolates from these patients were sequenced for the Pfs25 gene and
genotyped for seven microsatellites. The results indicate that despite different 
genetic backgrounds among parasite isolates, the Pfs25 sequences are highly
conserved, with a single nonsynonymous nucleotide polymorphism detected in 1 of
41 patients in Thailand and Burkina Faso. The anti-Pfs25 immune plasma had
significantly higher transmission-reducing activity against parasite isolates
from the two geographical regions than the nonimmune controls (P < 0.0001).
