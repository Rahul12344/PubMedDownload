To evaluate whether recovery from complicated malaria follows a common trajectory
in terms of immunological mechanism or, rather, is highly individualized for each
patient, we performed longitudinal gene expression profiling of whole blood. RNA 
sequencing (RNAseq) was performed on blood samples obtained from eight patients
on four consecutive days between hospital admission and discharge. Six patients
were infected with Plasmodium falciparum, and two with Plasmodium vivax; one
patient was a pregnant woman infected with P. falciparum, who was hospitalized
for several weeks. The characterization of blood transcript modules (BTM) and
blood informative transcripts (BIT) revealed that patients' responses showed
little commonality, being dominated by the balance of gene activity relating to
lymphocyte function, inflammation, and interferon responses specific to each
patient. Only weak correlations with specific complicated malaria symptoms such
as jaundice, thrombocytopenia, or anemia were observed. The differential
expression of individual genes, including transcripts derived from the human
leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex, generally reflected differences in the
underlying immune processes. Although the results of this pilot study do not
point to any single process that might provide a target for complicated malaria
treatment or prevention or personalized medical strategies, larger patient series
and more extensive blood sampling may allow the classification of patients
according to their type of response in order to develop novel therapeutic
approaches.
