Thermosensation provides vital inputs for the malaria vector mosquito, Anopheles 
gambiae which utilizes heat-sensitivity within a broad spectrum of behaviors,
most notably, the localization of human hosts for blood feeding. In this study,
we examine thermosensory behaviors in larval-stage An. gambiae, which as a result
of their obligate aquatic habitats and importance for vectorial capacity,
represents an opportunistic target for vector control as part of the global
campaign to eliminate malaria. As is the case for adults, immature mosquitoes
respond differentially to a diverse array of external heat stimuli. In addition, 
larvae exhibit a striking phenotypic plasticity in thermal-driven behaviors that 
are established by temperature at which embryonic development occurs. Within this
spectrum, RNAi-directed gene-silencing studies provide evidence for the essential
role of the Transient Receptor Potential sub-family A1 (TRPA1) channel in
mediating larval thermal-induced locomotion and thermal preference within a
discrete upper range of ambient temperatures.
