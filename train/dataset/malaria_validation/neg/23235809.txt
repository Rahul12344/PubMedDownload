INTRODUCTION: The study of the biological aspects of Anopheles spp., strengthens 
the entomological surveillance.
OBJECTIVE: To determine biological aspects and behavior of adult Anopheles
mosquitoes in the urban area of Puerto Carreño municipality, Vichada, Colombia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wild anophelines were collected landing on humans both
indoors and outdoors between 18:00h and 06:00h for 50 min/h during two
consecutive nights/month for eight months in the urban area of Puerto Carreño.
The biting rate activity, the natural infection by Plasmodium falciparum and P.
vivax VK247 and VK210 using ELISA, and the annual entomological inoculation rate 
were determined for each species. The members of the Albitarsis complex were
determined by amplificacion of the white gene by polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: In order of abundance the species found were An. darlingi (n=1,166), An.
marajoara sensu stricto (n=152), An. braziliensis (n=59), An. albitarsis F
(n=25), An. albitarsis sensu lato (n=16), An. argyritarsis (n=3) and An. oswaldoi
sensu lato (n=2). An. darlingi showed two activity peaks between 21:00 to 22:00
and 05:00 to 06:00 hours outdoors and between 21:00 to 22:00 and 04:00 to 05:00
indoors. Natural infection of this species was found with P. vivax VK210 and its 
annual entomological inoculation rate was 2. Natural infection of An marajoara
sensu stricto with P. falciparum was found, with an annual entomological
inoculation rate of 5 and a peak biting activity between 18:00 to 19:00 hrs both 
indoors and outdoors.
CONCLUSION: Transmission of malaria in the urban area of Puerto Carreño, Vichada,
can occur by An. darlingi and An. marajoara s.s.
