Plasmodium rhoptry neck protein 2 (RON2), which is released from the neck portion
of the merozoite rhoptries and interacts with the microneme protein Apical
Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA1), plays a crucial role in erythrocyte invasion. In this 
study, we sequenced the Plasmodium vivax RON2 gene from 19 P. vivax isolates
collected in central China in order to establish whether this protein is under
positive diversifying selection, which may occur as a result of protective host
immune pressureâ€ . In comparison with the P. vivax Sal-1 reference line, we found 
10 amino acid substitutions dispersed throughout the open reading frame as well
as indels caused by polymorphism in a repeat unit (21-23 repeats of
(Q/E/K/N/H)(G/D)G(H/L/Y/P)G) in the second tandem repeat region located at amino 
acid positions 541-650. A McDonald-Kreitman test with RON2 sequences from the
primate malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi, detected significant departure from
neutrality in the PvRON2 3' region (nucleotide positions 2668-6609). These
results suggest that the PvRON2 gene has evolved under positive diversifying
selection.
