Identification of inter-individual variability for drug metabolism through
cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) enzyme is important for understanding the
differences in clinical responses to malaria and HIV. This study evaluates the
distribution of CYP2B6 alleles, haplotypes and inferred metabolic phenotypes
among subjects with different ethnicity in Botswana. A total of 570 subjects were
analyzed for CYP2B6 polymorphisms at position 516 G > T (rs3745274), 785 A > G
(rs2279343) and 983 T > C (rs28399499). Samples were collected in three districts
of Botswana where the population belongs to Bantu (Serowe/Palapye and Chobe) and 
San-related (Ghanzi) ethnicity. The three districts showed different haplotype
composition according to the ethnic background but similar metabolic inferred
phenotypes, with 59.12%, 34.56%, 2.10% and 4.21% of the subjects having,
respectively, an extensive, intermediate, slow and rapid metabolic profile. The
results hint at the possibility of a convergent adaptation of detoxifying
metabolic phenotypes despite a different haplotype structure due to the different
genetic background. The main implication is that, while there is substantial
homogeneity of metabolic inferred phenotypes among the country, the response to
drugs metabolized via CYP2B6 could be individually associated to an increased
risk of treatment failure and toxicity. These are important facts since Botswana 
is facing malaria elimination and a very high HIV prevalence.
