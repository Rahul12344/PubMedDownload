The antimalarial drugs are of fundamental importance in the control of malaria,
especially for the lack of efficient treatments and acquired resistance to the
existing drugs. For this reason, there is a continuous work in identifying novel,
less toxic and effective chemotherapies as well as new therapeutic targets
against the causative agents of malaria. In this context, a superfamily of
metalloenzymes named carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) has aroused a great
interest as druggable enzymes to limit the development of Plasmodium falciparum
gametocytes. CAs catalyze a common reaction in all life domains, the carbon
dioxide hydration to bicarbonate and protons (CO2 + H2O ⇔ HCO3- + H+). P.
falciparum synthesizes pyrimidines de novo starting from HCO3-, which is
generated from CO2 through the action of the η-CA identified in the genome of the
protozoan. Here, we propose a procedure for the preparation of a wider portion of
the protozoan η-CA, named PfCAdom (358 amino acid residues), with respect to the 
truncated form prepared by Krungkrai et al. (PfCA1, 235 amino acid residues). The
results evidenced that the recombinant PfCAdom, produced as a His-tag fusion
protein, was 2.7 times more active with respect the truncated form PfCA1.
