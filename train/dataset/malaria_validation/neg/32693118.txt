Splenomegaly, a major symptom in Plasmodium infection, is extensively studied for
its immunopathological role in mice malaria model infected with Plasmodium
berghei ANKA. The status of autophagic regulation in hosts in malaria
pathogenesis remains unreported till date. This study demonstrated the autophagy,
proteasomal degradation and NRF2-KEAP1 antioxidant pathway status in the host
during Plasmodium infection taking murine spleen as our organ of interest.
Initial staining and autophagic gene expression indicate a possibility of
autophagic pathway activation. Although the conversion of LC3A to LC3B and
lysosome-autophagosome fusion increases, the final degradation step remains
incomplete. Resultant upregulation of p62 and its altered phosphorylated status
enhances its binding to keap1 causing NRF2 translocation to the nucleus. NRF2 act
as transcription factor upregulating p62 level itself leading to an autoinduction
loop of p62 expression. Interestingly, enhancement of P62 interaction with
proteasome subunit RPT1 indicates a possible role in transporting ubiquitinated
cargo to proteasome complex. Ubiquitination level increased with subsequent
upregulation of all three modes of proteasomal degradation i.e trypsin-like,
caspase-like and especially chymotrypsin-like. Sqstm1/p62 plays a critical
central role in regulating autophagy, proteasomal degradation, and NRF2-KEAP1
pathway. The incomplete autophagic flux in the final step may be a key
therapeutic target, as autophagic degradation and subsequent pathogenic peptide
presentation is of utmost necessity for downstream immune response.
