Condensin is a multi-subunit protein complex regulating chromosome condensation
and segregation during cell division. In Plasmodium spp., the causative agent of 
malaria, cell division is atypical and the role of condensin is unclear. Here we 
examine the role of SMC2 and SMC4, the core subunits of condensin, during
endomitosis in schizogony and endoreduplication in male gametogenesis. During
early schizogony, SMC2/SMC4 localize to a distinct focus, identified as the
centromeres by NDC80 fluorescence and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing
(ChIP-seq) analyses, but do not form condensin I or II complexes. In mature
schizonts and during male gametogenesis, there is a diffuse SMC2/SMC4
distribution on chromosomes and in the nucleus, and both condensin I and
condensin II complexes form at these stages. Knockdown of smc2 and smc4 gene
expression reveals essential roles in parasite proliferation and transmission.
The condensin core subunits (SMC2/SMC4) form different complexes and may have
distinct functions at various stages of the parasite life cycle.
