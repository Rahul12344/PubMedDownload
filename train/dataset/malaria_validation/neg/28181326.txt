Single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing has recently been used to obtain
full-length cDNA sequences that improve genome annotation and reveal RNA
isoforms. Here, we used one such method called isoform sequencing from Pacific
Biosciences (PacBio) to sequence a cDNA library from the Asian malaria mosquito
Anopheles stephensi. More than 600 000 full-length cDNAs, referred to as reads of
insert, were identified. Owing to the inherently high error rate of PacBio
sequencing, we tested different approaches for error correction. We found that
error correction using Illumina RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) generated more data than
using the default SMRT pipeline. The full-length error-corrected PacBio reads
greatly improved the gene annotation of Anopheles stephensi: 4867 gene models
were updated and 1785 alternatively spliced isoforms were added to the
annotation. In addition, six trans-splicing events, where exons from different
primary transcripts were joined together, were identified in An. stephensi. All
six trans-splicing events appear to be conserved in Culicidae, as they are also
found in Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti. The proteins encoded by
trans-splicing events are also highly conserved and the orthologues of these
proteins are cis-spliced in outgroup species, indicating that trans-splicing may 
arise as a mechanism to rescue genes that broke up during evolution.
