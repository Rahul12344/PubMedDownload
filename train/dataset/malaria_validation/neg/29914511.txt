BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum is the most virulent parasite of the five
Plasmodium species that cause human malaria, and biological analysis of the
parasite is critical for the development of novel strategies for disease control.
DNA endonucleases are important for maintaining the biological activity, gene
stability of the parasite and interaction with host immune systems. In this
study, ten sequences of DNA endonucleases were found in the genome of P.
falciparum 3D7 clone, seven of them were predicted to contain an
endonuclease/exonuclease/phosphatase (IPR005135) domain which plays an important 
role in DNA catalytic activity. The seven DNA endonucleases of P. falciparum were
systematically investigated.
METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 clone was cultured in human O+ RBCs, RNA was
extracted at 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48Â h post invasion and real-time quantitative
PCR was carried out to analyse the transcription of the seven DNA endonuclease
genes in asexual stages. Immunofluorescence assay was carried out to confirm the 
location of the encoded proteins expressed in the erythrocytic stages. Finally,
the catalytic activity of the DNA nucleases were tested.
RESULTS: Of the seven proteins analysed, two proteins were not soluble. Fragments
derived from the rest five endonuclease sequences were successfully expressed as 
soluble proteins, and which were used to generate antisera for protein
localization. The proteins were all located in the nucleus at ring and
trophozoite stages. While at schizont stage, proteins encoded by PF3D7_1238600,
PF3D7_0107200 and PF3D7_0319200 were in the punctuated forms in the parasite most
likely around nuclei of the merozoites. But the proteins encoded by PF3D7_0305600
and PF3D7_1363500 were distributed around the infected erythrocyte membrane. The 
enzymatic activity of the recombinant GST-PF3D7_1238600 was very efficient
without divalent iron, while the activity of the rest four enzymes was iron
dependent. Further, divalent irons did not show any specific enhancement on the
activity of GST-PF3D7_1238600, but the activity of GST-PF3D7_0107200,
GST-PF3D7_1363500 and GST-PF3D7_0319200 were Cu2+ dependent. The activity of
GST-PF3D7_0305600 was dependent on Mg2+ and Mn2+. Except GST-PF3D7_1363500, four 
of the GST tagged recombinant proteins hydrolysed the supercoiled circular
plasmid DNA with or without divalent metal ions. The GST-PF3D7_1363500 protein
only changed the supercoiled circular plasmid DNA into nicked plasmids, even with
Cu2+.
CONCLUSIONS: Fragments derived from five of the endonuclease sequences of P.
falciparum 3D7 clone were successfully expressed. The proteins displayed diverse 
cell distribution, biochemical and enzymatic activities, which indicated that
they carried different biological function in the development of the parasite in 
the erythrocytes. The DNA repair and DNA degradation capacity of the DNA
endonucleases in the biology of the parasite remained further studied.
