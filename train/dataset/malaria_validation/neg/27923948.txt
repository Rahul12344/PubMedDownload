BACKGROUND:  Plasmodium infection depletes arginine, the substrate for nitric
oxide synthesis, and impairs endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Increased
conversion of arginine to ornithine by parasites or host arginase is a proposed
mechanism of arginine depletion.
METHODS:  We used high-performance liquid chromatography to measure plasma
arginine, ornithine, and citrulline levels in Malawian children with cerebral
malaria and in mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA with or without the
arginase gene. Heavy isotope-labeled tracers measured by quadrupole
time-of-flight liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to quantify the 
in vivo rate of appearance and interconversion of plasma arginine, ornithine, and
citrulline in infected mice.
RESULTS:  Children with cerebral malaria and P. berghei-infected mice
demonstrated depletion of plasma arginine, ornithine, and citrulline. Knock out
of Plasmodium arginase did not alter arginine depletion in infected mice.
Metabolic tracer analysis demonstrated that plasma arginase flux was unchanged by
P. berghei infection. Instead, infected mice exhibited decreased rates of plasma 
arginine, ornithine, and citrulline appearance and decreased conversion of plasma
citrulline to arginine. Notably, plasma arginine use by nitric oxide synthase was
decreased in infected mice.
CONCLUSIONS:  Simultaneous arginine and ornithine depletion in malaria
parasite-infected children cannot be fully explained by plasma arginase activity.
Our mouse model studies suggest that plasma arginine depletion is driven
primarily by a decreased rate of appearance.
