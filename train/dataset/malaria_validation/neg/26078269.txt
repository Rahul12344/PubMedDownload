Coevolution of ticks and the vertebrate immune system has led to the development 
of immunosuppressive molecules that prevent immediate response of skin-resident
immune cells to quickly fend off the parasite. In this article, we demonstrate
that the tick-derived immunosuppressor sialostatin L restrains IL-9 production by
mast cells, whereas degranulation and IL-6 expression are both unaffected. In
addition, the expression of IL-1β and IRF4 is strongly reduced in the presence of
sialostatin L. Correspondingly, IRF4- or IL-1R-deficient mast cells exhibit a
strong impairment in IL-9 production, demonstrating the importance of IRF4 and
IL-1 in the regulation of the Il9 locus in mast cells. Furthermore, IRF4 binds to
the promoters of Il1b and Il9, suggesting that sialostatin L suppresses mast
cell-derived IL-9 preferentially by inhibiting IRF4. In an experimental asthma
model, mast cell-specific deficiency in IRF4 or administration of sialostatin L
results in a strong reduction in asthma symptoms, demonstrating the
immunosuppressive potency of tick-derived molecules.
