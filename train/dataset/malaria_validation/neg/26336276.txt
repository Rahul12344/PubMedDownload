Leucine-to-phenylalanine substitution at residue L1014 in the voltage-gated
sodium channel, target site of action for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)
and pyrethroids, is the most common knockdown resistance (kdr) mutation reported 
in several insects conferring resistance against DDT and pyrethroids. Here, we
report presence of two coexisting alternative transversions, A>T and A>C, on the 
third codon position of L1014 residue in malaria vector Anopheles subpictus
Grassi (species A) from Jamshedpur (India), both leading to the same amino acid
substitution of Leu-to-Phe with allelic frequencies of 19 and 67%, respectively. 
A single primer-introduced restriction analysis-polymerase chain reaction
(PIRA-PCR) was devised for the identification of L1014F-kdr mutation in An.
subpictus resulting from either type of point mutation. Genotyping of samples
with PIRA-PCR revealed high frequency (82%) of L1014F-kdr mutation in the study
area.
