BACKGROUND: In West Africa, populations of the malaria vector mosquito, Anopheles
coluzzii, are seasonally exposed to strong desiccating conditions during the dry 
season. Their dynamics strictly follows the pace of the availability of suitable 
larval development sites (water collections). Accordingly, mosquitoes can
reproduce all year long where permanent breeding is possible, or stop
reproduction and virtually disappear at the onset of the dry season when surface 
water dries up, like observed in temporary habitats of dry savannah areas. This
highlights the strong adaptive abilities of this mosquito species, which relies
at least in part, upon physiological and molecular mechanisms of specific
signatures.
METHODS: Here, we analysed a range of physiological and molecular responses
expressed by geographically different populations of An. coluzzii inhabiting
permanent and temporary breeding sites from the north and the south-west of
Burkina Faso. Four mosquito colonies, namely (i) Oursi, built from females
breeding in permanent habitats of the north; (ii) Déou, from temporary northern
habitats; (iii) Soumousso from south-western temporary breeding sites; and (iv)
Bama, from permanent habitats of the same south-western zone, were reared in
climatic chambers under contrasted environmental conditions, mimicking
temperature, relative humidity and light regimen occurring in northern Burkina
Faso. Female mosquitoes were analysed for the seasonal variation in their amounts
of proteins, triglycerides and free-circulating metabolites. The expression level
of genes coding for the adipokinetic (AKH-I) and the AKH/corazonin-related
peptides (ACP) were also assessed and compared among populations and
environmental conditions.
RESULTS: Our analysis did not reveal an apparent pattern of physiological and
molecular variations strictly correlated with either the larval ecotype or the
geographical origin of the mosquitoes. However, specific distinct responses were 
observed among populations, suggesting that dry season survival may rely on more 
complex ecological parameters at a micro-habitat scale. Interestingly, the
physiological and molecular data support the hypothesis that different
aestivation abilities exist among populations of An. coluzzii inhabiting
contrasted ecological settings. In particular, the striking metabotypes
differentiation and the AKH mRNA expression level observed in females from
temporary northern populations may suggest the existence of a "strong"
aestivation strategy in these specimens.
CONCLUSION: Our work provides insights into the physiological and molecular basis
of dry and rainy season responses in An. coluzzii, and highlights the important
diversity of the mechanisms involved. Such results represent key data for
understanding the ecophysiological mechanisms underpinning the strong adaptive
potential of this malaria vector species, which undoubtedly contributes to the
spreading of mosquito distribution areas in space and time.
