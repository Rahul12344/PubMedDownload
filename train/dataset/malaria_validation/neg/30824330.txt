BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax malaria accounts for 80% of the malaria cases in
Delhi, India. The gene merozoite surface protein 3 alpha (MSP3α) is highly
polymorphic and has been used as marker in many P. vivax population studies.
METHODS: MSP3α has been used to assess the genetic diversity of P. vivax samples 
from Delhi (India) having more than one malaria episode (s) i.e. clinically
identified relapse cases using PCR-RFLP and sequencing.
RESULTS: Three major genotypes 2.0 kb (A), 1.4 kb (B) and 1.2 kb (C) were
amplified from 72 isolates with frequencies of 72.2%, 19.44% and 9.72%
respectively. One sample out of 72 showed mixed infection having both A and B
type genotypes. 82.05% patients showed same genotype while only 17.94% patients
showed different genotypes after subsequent malaria episodes. 18 different
genotypes with Alu I and 35 with Hha I were identified among 72 samples analyzed 
by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). 18 Pvmsp3α nucleotide
sequences were analyzed and it did not reveal any distinct intragenic differences
within sequences of the same type, however, allelic diversity among the three
types (Π = 0.029703) was observed. Phylogenetic analysis showed allelic family
types A, B and C were not clustered but distributed in different branches. The
results indicate that the P. vivax parasite population is highly diverse in
Delhi, India. A large number of amino acid substitutions were found at the locus 
of the isolates when compared with the Belem Strain (Π  = 0.030528). The
substantial sequence diversity is largely restricted to certain domains of
encoded protein. Analysis of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions suggested
that different selection forces were operating on different regions of the
protein molecule.
CONCLUSION: We propose that genotyping of the PvMSP-3α gene as one of the
molecular tools for differentiating relapse from new infection in epidemiological
settings. The analyses of sequence polymorphism in PvMSP-3α gene enable it as
potential candidate for inclusion in a P.vivax vaccine research.
