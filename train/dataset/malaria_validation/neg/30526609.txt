BACKGROUND: Malaria is still a serious public health problem on Bioko Island
(Equatorial Guinea), although the number of annual cases has been greatly reduced
since 2004 through the Bioko Island Malaria Control Project (BIMCP). A better
understanding of malaria parasite population diversity and transmission dynamics 
is critical for assessing the effectiveness of malaria control measures. The
objective of this study is to investigate the genetic diversity of Plasmodium
falciparum populations and multiplicity of infection (MOI) on Bioko Island
7 years after BIMCP.
METHODS: A total of 181 patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria
diagnosed with microscopy were collected from Bioko Island from January 2011 to
December 2014. Parasite DNA was extracted using chelex-100 and species were
identified using a real-time PCR followed by high-resolution melting. Plasmodium 
falciparum msp1 and msp2 allelic families were determined using nested PCR.
RESULTS: Three msp1 alleles (K1, MAD20, and RO33) and two msp2 alleles (FC27 and 
3D7) were analysed in all samples. In msp1, the MAD20 allelic family was
predominant with 96.69% (175/178) followed respectively by the K1 allelic family 
with 96.07% (171/178) and R033 allelic family with 70.78% (126/178). In msp2, the
FC27 allelic family was the most frequently detected with 97.69% (169/173)
compared to 3D7 with 72.25% (125/173). Twenty-six different alleles were observed
in msp1 with 9 alleles for K1, 9 alleles for MAD20 and 8 alleles for R033. In
msp2, 25 individual alleles were detected with 5 alleles for FC27 and 20 alleles 
for 3D7. The overall MOI was 5.51 with respectively 3.5 and 2.01 for msp1 and
msp2. A significant increase in overall MOI was correlated with the age group of 
the patients (P = 0.026) or parasite densities (P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: The present data showed high genetic diversity and MOI values among 
the P. falciparum population in the study, reflecting both the high endemic level
and malaria transmission on Bioko Island. These data provide valuable information
for surveillance of P. falciparum infection and for assessing the appropriateness
of the current malarial control strategies in the endemic area.
