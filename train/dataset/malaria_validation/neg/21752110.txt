Transmission of Plasmodium species from a mammalian host to the mosquito vector
requires the uptake, during an infected blood meal, of gametocytes, the precursor
cells of the gametes. Relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms
involved in the developmental switch from asexual development to sexual
differentiation or the maturation and survival of gametocytes. Here, we show that
a gene coding for a novel putative transporter, NPT1, plays a crucial role in the
development of Plasmodium berghei gametocytes. Parasites lacking NPT1 are
severely compromised in the production of gametocytes and the rare gametocytes
produced are unable to differentiate into fertile gametes. This is the earliest
block in gametocytogenesis obtained by reverse genetics and the first to
demonstrate the role of a protein with a putative transport function in sexual
development. These results and the high degree of conservation of NPT1 in
Plasmodium species suggest that this protein could be an attractive target for
the development of novel drugs to block the spread of malaria.
