BACKGROUND: Host genetics play an important role in Plasmodium falciparum malaria
susceptibility. However, information on host genetic factors and their
relationships with malaria in the vaccine trial site of Iganga, Uganda is
limited. The main objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of
selected host genetic markers and their relationship to malaria incidence in the 
vaccine trial site of Iganga, Uganda. In a 1-year longitudinal cohort study, 423 
children aged below 9 years were recruited and their malaria episodes were
investigated. Host genetic polymorphisms were assessed by PCR-RFLP, haemoglobin
electrophoresis and DNA sequencing. Using a multivariate negative binomial
regression model, estimates of the impact of human genetic polymorphisms on
malaria incidence were performed. In all statistical tests, a P value of <0.05
was considered as significant.
RESULTS: The prevalences of sickle cell haemoglobin trait, G6PD c.202 G>A (rs
1050828) and NOS2 -954 G>C (rs 1800482) variants were 26.6, 22.7 and 17.3%,
respectively. Inducible nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2 -954 G>C; rs 1800482)
heterozygosity was associated with lower incidence of malaria in all age groups
{Adjusted incident rates ratio (aIRR) 0.59; 95% CI [0.386-0.887]; P = 0.012)}.
About 4% of study subjects had co-existence of sickle cell Hb trait and G6PD
deficiency. Sickle cell Hb heterozygotes (Hb AS) aged less than 1 year
experienced significantly more malaria episodes annually than children with
normal haemoglobin (Hb AA) {aIRR = 1.98; 95% CI [1.240-3.175]; P = 0.004}. There 
was no significant influence of the sickle cell trait on malaria incidence among 
older children of 1-9 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Mutation (NOS2 -954 G>C; rs 1800482) of nitric oxide synthase 2 gene
promoter was associated with a lower incidence of acute malaria. The normal
haemoglobin (wild genotype; HbAA) was associated with reduced malaria incidence
rates during the first year of life. More understanding of the interplay between 
host genetics and malaria susceptibility is required.
