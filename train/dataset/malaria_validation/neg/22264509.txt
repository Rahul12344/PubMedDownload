A major virulence factor of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is
erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), a variant protein expressed on the
infected erythrocyte surface. PfEMP1 is responsible for adherence of infected
erythrocytes to the endothelium and plays an important role in pathogenesis.
Mutually exclusive transcription and switched expression of one of 60 var genes
encoding PfEMP1 in each parasite genome provides a mechanism for antigenic
variation. We report the identification of a parasite protein, designated
PfSET10, which localizes exclusively to the perinuclear active var gene
expression site. PfSET10 is a histone 3 lysine 4 methyltransferase required to
maintain the active var gene in a poised state during division for reactivation
in daughter parasites, and as such is required for P. falciparum antigenic
variation. PfSET10 likely maintains the transcriptionally permissive chromatin
environment of the active var promoter and thus retains memory for heritable
transmission of epigenetic information during parasite division.
