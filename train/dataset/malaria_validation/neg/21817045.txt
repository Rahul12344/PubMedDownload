Malaria remains a devastating disease largely because of widespread drug
resistance. New drugs and a better understanding of the mechanisms of drug action
and resistance are essential for fulfilling the promise of eradicating malaria.
Using high-throughput chemical screening and genome-wide association analysis, we
identified 32 highly active compounds and genetic loci associated with
differential chemical phenotypes (DCPs), defined as greater than or equal to
fivefold differences in half-maximum inhibitor concentration (IC(50)) between
parasite lines. Chromosomal loci associated with 49 DCPs were confirmed by
linkage analysis and tests of genetically modified parasites, including three
genes that were linked to 96% of the DCPs. Drugs whose responses mapped to
wild-type or mutant pfcrt alleles were tested in combination in vitro and in
vivo, which yielded promising new leads for antimalarial treatments.
