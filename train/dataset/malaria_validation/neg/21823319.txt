OBJECTIVE: To study the role of TEP1 gene from Anopheles dirns during Plasmodium 
yoelii infection by RNA interference.
METHODS: TEP1 primers with T7 promoter were designed based on the sequence of An.
dirus TEP1 gene from GenBank database. PCR amplification of TEP1 gene was
completed with An. dirus cDNA as template. The AdTEP1 double-stranded RNA was
synthesized by using in vitro transcription kit with purified PCR products.
Female An. dirus emerged for 1-2 days were divided into three groups each with
200 mosquitoes: TEP1 interference group, EGFP interference group and control.
Mosquitoes in TEP1 and EGFP interference groups were microinjected in chest with 
147 ng of AdTEP1 and EGFP double-stranded RNA, respectively, while those of
control group were untreated. Effect of TEP1 interference on P. yoelii in An.
dirus was estimated through semi-quantitative PCR with internal reference AdS7 at
3 d after injection. On 4 d after injection, mosquitoes were infected by
EGFP-expressing P. yoelii BY265. The infection rate and infectivity of mosquitoes
were observed through anastomosing 25 midguts from each group at 9 d
post-infection.
RESULTS: The AdTEP1 double-stranded RNA did well in the interference of TEP1
expression in An. dirus. The infection rate in the groups of control, EGFP and
TEP1 interference was (24 +/- 2.83)%, (24 +/- 0.71)%, and (80 +/- 3.54)%,
respectively; and the infectivity of the three groups was 0.32 +/- 0.7, 0.44 +/- 
0.85, and 5.52 +/- 4.84, respectively.
CONCLUSION: AdTEP1 interference increases the infection rate and infectivity of
An. dirus by P. yoelii, and raises the susceptibility of An. dirus to P. yoelii
significantly. TEP1 plays a critical role in the process of P. yoelii infection.
