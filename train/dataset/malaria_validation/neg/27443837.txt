AIM: In Benin, artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) has been recommended
as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria since
2004. The emergence in Southeast Asia of parasites that are resistant to
artemisinins poses a serious threat to global control of this disease. The
presence of artemisinin resistance genotypes in parasite populations in Benin is 
currently unknown. The present study investigated the prevalence of relevant
K13-propeller gene polymorphisms in parasite isolates from the north-western
region of Benin.
METHOD: Plasmodium falciparum isolates were collected from children with a
confirmed diagnosis of malaria aged 6 months to 5 years in two towns, Cobly and
Djougou, in the north-western part of Benin. The study was conducted during the
rainy season from July to November 2014 in local health facilities. The
K13-propeller gene was amplified in parasite isolates using nested PCR and
subsequently sequenced.
RESULTS: A total of 108 children were recruited into the study. The efficiency of
amplification reactions was 72% (78/108). The propeller domain of the K13 gene
was successfully sequenced in 78 P. falciparum isolates; all of them were wild
type with no polymorphisms detectable.
CONCLUSION: The absence of mutations in the K13 gene indicates that P. falciparum
parasite populations in the study area are still fully susceptible to
artemisinins.
