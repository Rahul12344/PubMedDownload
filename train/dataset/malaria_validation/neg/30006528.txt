Plasmodium species produce an ortholog of the cytokine macrophage migration
inhibitory factor, PMIF, which modulates the host inflammatory response to
malaria. Using a novel RNA replicon-based vaccine, we show the impact of PMIF
immunoneutralization on the host response and observed improved control of liver 
and blood-stage Plasmodium infection, and complete protection from re-infection. 
Vaccination against PMIF delayed blood-stage patency after sporozoite infection, 
reduced the expression of the Th1-associated inflammatory markers TNF-α, IL-12,
and IFN-γ during blood-stage infection, augmented Tfh cell and germinal center
responses, increased anti-Plasmodium antibody titers, and enhanced the
differentiation of antigen-experienced memory CD4 T cells and liver-resident CD8 
T cells. Protection from re-infection was recapitulated by the adoptive transfer 
of CD8 or CD4 T cells from PMIF RNA immunized hosts. Parasite MIF inhibition may 
be a useful approach to promote immunity to Plasmodium and potentially other
parasite genera that produce MIF orthologous proteins.
