Super-resistant Plasmodium falciparum threatens the effectiveness of
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in intermittent preventive treatment for malaria during
pregnancy. It is characterized by the A581G Pfdhps mutation on a background of
the double-mutant Pfdhps and the triple-mutant Pfdhfr. Using samples collected
during 2004-2008, we investigated the evolutionary origin of the A581G mutation
by characterizing microsatellite diversity flanking Pfdhps triple-mutant
(437G+540E+581G) alleles from 3 locations in eastern Africa and comparing it with
double-mutant (437G+540E) alleles from the same area. In Ethiopia, both alleles
derived from 1 lineage that was distinct from those in Uganda and Tanzania.
Uganda and Tanzania triple mutants derived from the previously characterized
southeastern Africa double-mutant lineage. The A581G mutation has occurred
multiple times on local Pfdhps double-mutant backgrounds; however, a novel
microsatellite allele incorporated into the Tanzania lineage since 2004
illustrates the local expansion of emergent triple-mutant lineages.
