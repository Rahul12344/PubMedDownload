We analyzed blood samples of resident and migratory Japanese birds to evaluate
the prevalence and genetic background of avian blood parasites in northern Japan.
We used PCR targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene to examine infections
of Leucocytozoon, Haemoproteus, and Plasmodium parasites in blood samples from
243 birds of 14 species in three orders (Passeriformes, Columbiformes, and
Anseriformes). Sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analysis. The infection
rate was 21% in pigeons (Columbiformes) and 17% in Anseriformes. A high infection
rate of 93.8% was found in crow species (Passeriformes). Haemoproteus and
Plasmodium parasites were detected in only two species. Infected blood samples
obtained from seven bird species involved two major clades of Leucocytozoon,
which were divided between resident and migratory birds. The parasites, which are
genetically distinct from parasites in Japanese resident birds, may have been
introduced to Japan by migratory bird species.
