BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum infection during pregnancy is a major cause of 
poor maternal health, adverse foetal outcome and infant mortality in sub-Saharan 
Africa. Genetic disposition is involved in susceptibility to malaria in pregnancy
and its manifestation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) influence gene regulation including
that of innate immune responses. A miRNA-146a rs2910164 G > C single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) has been associated with increased risks of several diseases, 
but no data as to malaria are available.
METHODS: The association between miRNA-146a rs2910164 and P. falciparum infection
among 509 Ghanaian women attending antenatal care (ANC) and 296 delivering
Ghanaian primiparae was investigated. Malaria parasites were diagnosed by
microscopy and PCR. Leukocyte-associated hemozoin in placental samples was
recorded as well. Proportions were compared between groups by Fisher's exact
test, and logistic regression models were used to adjust for possible
confounders.
RESULTS: By PCR, P. falciparum infection was detected in 63% and 67% of ANC
attendees and delivering primiparae, respectively. In both groups, two in three
women were either heterozygous or homozygous for miRNA-146a rs2910164. Among ANC 
attendees, homozygosity conferred increased odds of infection (adjusted odds
ratio (aOR), 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3-4.0), which was pronounced among primigravidae
(aOR, 5.8; 95% CI, 1.6-26) but only marginal in multigravidae. Likewise,
homozygosity for miRNA-146a rs2910164 in primiparae increased the odds of past or
present placental P. falciparum infection almost six-fold (aOR, 5.9; 95% CI,
2.1-18).
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that SNP rs2910164 G > C is associated with
increased odds for P. falciparum infection in first-time pregnant women who are
considered to lack sufficient acquired immune responses against
pregnancy-specific strains of P. falciparum. These findings suggest that
miRNA-146a is involved in protective malarial immunity, and specifically in the
innate component.
