Flaviviruses such as dengue, yellow fever, Zika, West Nile, and Japanese
encephalitis virus present substantial global health burdens. New vaccines are
being sought to address safety and manufacturing issues associated with current
live attenuated vaccines. Here, we describe a new insect-specific flavivirus,
Binjari virus, which was found to be remarkably tolerant for exchange of its
structural protein genes (prME) with those of the aforementioned pathogenic
vertebrate-infecting flaviviruses (VIFs). Chimeric BinJ/VIF-prME viruses remained
replication defective in vertebrate cells but replicated with high efficiency in 
mosquito cells. Cryo-electron microscopy and monoclonal antibody binding studies 
illustrated that the chimeric BinJ/VIF-prME virus particles were structurally and
immunologically similar to their parental VIFs. Pilot manufacturing in C6/36
cells suggests that high yields can be reached up to 109.5 cell culture
infectious dose/ml or ≈7 mg/liter. BinJ/VIF-prME viruses showed utility in
diagnostic (microsphere immunoassays and ELISAs using panels of human and equine 
sera) and vaccine applications (illustrating protection against Zika virus
challenge in murine IFNAR-/- mouse models). BinJ/VIF-prME viruses thus represent 
a versatile, noninfectious (for vertebrate cells), high-yield technology for
generating chimeric flavivirus particles with low biocontainment requirements.
