BACKGROUND: Targeted amplicon deep sequencing (TADS) of the 16S rRNA gene is
commonly used to explore and characterize bacterial microbiomes. Meanwhile,
attempts to apply TADS to the detection and characterization of entire parasitic 
communities have been hampered since conserved regions of many conserved parasite
genes, such as the 18S rRNA gene, are also conserved in their eukaryotic hosts.
As a result, targeted amplification of 18S rRNA from clinical samples using
universal primers frequently results in competitive priming and preferential
amplification of host DNA. Here, we describe a novel method that employs a single
pair of universal primers to capture all blood-borne parasites while reducing
host 18S rRNA template and enhancing the amplification of parasite 18S rRNA for
TADS. This was achieved using restriction enzymes to digest the 18S rRNA gene at 
cut sites present only in the host sequence prior to PCR amplification.
RESULTS: This method was validated against 16 species of blood-borne helminths
and protozoa. Enzyme digestion prior to PCR enrichment and Illumina amplicon deep
sequencing led to a substantial reduction in human reads and a corresponding 5-
to 10-fold increase in parasite reads relative to undigested samples. This method
allowed for discrimination of all common parasitic agents found in human blood,
even in cases of multi-parasite infection, and markedly reduced the limit of
detection in digested versus undigested samples.
CONCLUSIONS: The results herein provide a novel methodology for the reduction of 
host DNA prior to TADS and establish the validity of a next-generation
sequencing-based platform for universal parasite detection.
