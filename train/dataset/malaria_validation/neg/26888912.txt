OBJECTIVES: As most available antimalarial drugs are ineffective against the
Plasmodium falciparum transmission stages, new drugs against the parasite's
gametocytes are urgently needed to combat malaria globally. The unique biology of
gametocytes requires assays that need to be specific, to faithfully monitor
anti-gametocyte activity, and to be easy to perform, cheap and scalable to
high-throughput screening (HTS).
METHODS: We developed an HTS cell-based assay with P. falciparum gametocytes
specifically expressing a potent luciferase. To confirm HTS hit activity for
several parasite genotypes, the luciferase assay and the gametocyte lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, usable on any parasite isolate, were compared by
screening antimalarial drugs and determining IC50 values of anti-gametocyte hits 
from the 'Malaria Box' against early- and late-stage gametocytes.
RESULTS: Comparison of the two assays, conducted on the early and on late
gametocyte stages, revealed an excellent correlation (R(2) > 0.9) for the IC50
values obtained by the respective readouts. Differences in susceptibility to
drugs and compounds between the two parasite developmental stages were
consistently measured in both assays.
CONCLUSIONS: This work indicates that the luciferase and gametocyte LDH assays
are interchangeable and that their specific advantages can be exploited to design
an HTS pipeline leading to new transmission-blocking compounds. Results from
these assays consistently defined a gametocyte chemical susceptibility profile,
relevant to the planning of future drug discovery strategies.
