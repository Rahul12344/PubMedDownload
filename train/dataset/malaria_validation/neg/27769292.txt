BACKGROUND: Previous genome-wide analyses of single nucleotide variation in
Plasmodium falciparum identified evidence of an extended haplotype region on
chromosome 6 in West Africa, suggesting recent positive selection. Such a pattern
is not seen in samples from East Africa or South East Asia, so it could be
marking a selective process specific to West Africa. Analyses of the haplotype
structure in samples taken at different times could give clues to possible causes
of selection.
METHODS: This study investigates chromosome 6 extended haplotypes in The Gambia
by analysing alleles at multiple microsatellite loci using genome sequence data
previously obtained from clinical isolates collected in 2008, followed by
genotyping of 13 loci in 439 isolates from 1984, 1991, 2008 and 2014. Temporal
changes in haplotype structure and frequencies were determined.
RESULTS: A region of high linkage disequilibrium spanning over 170Â kilobases (kb)
was identified with both NGS and laboratory determined microsatellite alleles.
Multiple long haplotypes were found in all temporal populations from The Gambia. 
Two of the haplotypes were detected in samples from 1984 and 1991. The frequency 
of long-range haplotypes increased in 2008 and 2014 populations. There was higher
Fst between older and more recent populations at loci in proximity to genes
involved in drug metabolism pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of several long haplotypes at intermediate
frequencies suggests an unusual mode of selection in chromosome 6, possibly
combined with recombination suppression on specific haplotypes. Such selection
apparently occurred before the emergence of known anti-malarial drug resistance
alleles, and could be due to effects of other drugs or unknown processes that
have long been operating in this endemic region.
