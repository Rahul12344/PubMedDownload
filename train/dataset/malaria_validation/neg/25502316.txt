Artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum threatens global efforts to
control and eliminate malaria. Polymorphisms in the kelch domain-carrying protein
K13 are associated with artemisinin resistance, but the underlying molecular
mechanisms are unknown. We analyzed the in vivo transcriptomes of 1043 P.
falciparum isolates from patients with acute malaria and found that artemisinin
resistance is associated with increased expression of unfolded protein response
(UPR) pathways involving the major PROSC and TRiC chaperone complexes.
Artemisinin-resistant parasites also exhibit decelerated progression through the 
first part of the asexual intraerythrocytic development cycle. These findings
suggest that artemisinin-resistant parasites remain in a state of decelerated
development at the young ring stage, whereas their up-regulated UPR pathways
mitigate protein damage caused by artemisinin. The expression profiles of
UPR-related genes also associate with the geographical origin of parasite
isolates, further suggesting their role in emerging artemisinin resistance in the
Greater Mekong Subregion.
