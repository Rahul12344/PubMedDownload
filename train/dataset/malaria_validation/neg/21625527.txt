Many eukaryotic developmental and cell fate decisions that are effected
post-transcriptionally involve RNA binding proteins as regulators of translation 
of key mRNAs. In malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.), the development of round,
non-motile and replicating exo-erythrocytic liver stage forms from slender,
motile and cell-cycle arrested sporozoites is believed to depend on environmental
changes experienced during the transmission of the parasite from the mosquito
vector to the vertebrate host. Here we identify a Plasmodium member of the RNA
binding protein family PUF as a key regulator of this transformation. In the
absence of Pumilio-2 (Puf2) sporozoites initiate EEF development inside mosquito 
salivary glands independently of the normal transmission-associated environmental
cues. Puf2- sporozoites exhibit genome-wide transcriptional changes that result
in loss of gliding motility, cell traversal ability and reduction in infectivity,
and, moreover, trigger metamorphosis typical of early Plasmodium intra-hepatic
development. These data demonstrate that Puf2 is a key player in regulating
sporozoite developmental control, and imply that transformation of salivary
gland-resident sporozoites into liver stage-like parasites is regulated by a
post-transcriptional mechanism.
