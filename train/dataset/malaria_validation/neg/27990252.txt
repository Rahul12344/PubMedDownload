In this study, we interpreted RNA-seq time-course data of three developmental
stages of Plasmodium species by clustering genes based on similarities in their
expression profile without prior knowledge of the gene function. Functional
enrichment of clusters of upregulated genes at specific time-points reveals
potential targetable biological processes with information on their timings. We
identified common consensus sequences that these clusters shared as potential
points of coordinated transcriptional control. Five cluster groups showed
upregulated profile patterns of biological interest. This included two clusters
from the Intraerythrocytic Developmental Cycle (cluster 4 = 16 genes, and cluster
9 = 32 genes), one from the sexual development stage (cluster 2 = 851 genes), and
two from the gamete-fertilization stage in the mosquito host (cluster 4 = 153
genes, and cluster 9 = 258 genes). The IDC expressed the least numbers of genes
with only 1448 genes showing any significant activity of the 5020 genes (~29%) in
the experiment. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of these clusters revealed
a total of 671 uncharacterized genes implicated in 14 biological processes and
components associated with these stages, some of which are currently being
investigated as drug targets in on-going research. Five putative transcription
regulatory binding motifs shared by members of each cluster were also identified,
one of which was also identified in a previous study by separate researchers. Our
study shows stage-specific genes and biological processes that may be important
in antimalarial drug research efforts. In addition, timed-coordinated control of 
separate processes may explain the paucity of factors in parasites.
