We studied all consensus sequences within the four least 'variable blocks' (VB)
present in the DBL6ε domain of VAR2CSA, the protein involved in the adhesion of
infected red blood cells by Plasmodium falciparum that causes the
Pregnancy-Associated Malaria (PAM). Characterising consensus sequences with
respect to recognition of antibodies and percentage of responders among pregnant 
women living in areas where P. falciparum is endemic allows the identification of
the most antigenic sequences within each VB. When combining these consensus
sequences among four serotypes from VB1 or VB5, the most often recognized ones
are expected to induce pan-reactive antibodies recognizing VAR2CSA from all
plasmodial strains. These sequences are of main interest in the design of an
immunogenic molecule. Using a similar approach than for DBL6ε, we studied the
five other DBL and the CIDRpam from VAR2CSA, and again identified VB segments
with highly conserved consensus sequences. In addition, we identified consensus
sequences in other var genes expressed by non-PAM parasites. This finding paves
the way for vaccine design against other pathologies caused by P. falciparum.
