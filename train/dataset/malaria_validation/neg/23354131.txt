In recent years, many studies have focused on heterochromatin located at
chromosome ends, which plays an important role in regulating gene expression in
many organisms ranging from yeast to humans. Similarly, in the protozoan
Plasmodium falciparum, which is the most virulent human malaria parasite, the
heterochromatin present in telomeres and subtelomeric regions exerts a silencing 
effect on the virulence gene families located therein. Studies addressing P.
falciparum chromosome ends have demonstrated that these regions participate in
other functions, such as the formation of the T-loop structure, the replication
of telomeric regions, the regulation of telomere length and the formation of
telomeric heterochromatin. In addition, telomeres are involved in anchoring
chromosome ends to the nuclear periphery, thereby playing an important role in
nuclear architecture and gene expression regulation. Here, we review the current 
understanding of chromosome ends, the proteins that bind to these regions and
their impact on the biology and virulence of P. falciparum.
