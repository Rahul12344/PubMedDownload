BACKGROUND: Host selection is an important determinant of vectorial capacity
because malaria transmission increases when mosquitoes feed more on humans than
non-humans. Host selection also affects the outcome of long-lasting insecticidal 
nets (LLIN). Despite the recent nationwide implementation of LLIN-based malaria
control program in Papua New Guinea (PNG), little is known about the host
selection of the local Anopheles vectors. This study investigated the host
selection of Anopheles vectors in PNG.
METHODS: Blood-engorged mosquitoes were sampled using the barrier screen method
and blood meals analyzed for vertebrate host source with PCR-amplification of the
mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Abundance of common hosts was estimated in
surveys. The test of homogeneity of proportions and the Manly resource selection 
ratio were used to determine if hosts were selected in proportion to their
abundance.
RESULTS: Two thousand four hundred and forty blood fed Anopheles females of seven
species were sampled from five villages in Madang, PNG. Of 2,142 samples tested, 
2,061 (96.2%) yielded a definitive host source; all were human, pig, or dog.
Hosts were not selected in proportion to their abundance, but rather were
under-selected or over-selected by the mosquitoes. Four species, Anopheles
farauti (sensu stricto) (s.s.), Anopheles punctulatus (s.s.), Anopheles farauti
no. 4 and Anopheles longirostris, over-selected humans in villages with low LLIN 
usage, but over-selected pigs in villages with high LLIN usage. Anopheles
koliensis consistently over-selected humans despite high LLIN usage, and
Anopheles bancroftii over-selected pigs.
CONCLUSIONS: The plasticity of host selection of an Anopheles species depends on 
its opportunistic, anthropophilic or zoophilic behavior, and on the extent of
host availability and LLIN usage where the mosquitoes forage for hosts. The high 
anthropophily of An. koliensis increases the likelihood of contacting the LLIN
inside houses. This allows its population size to be reduced to levels
insufficient to support transmission. In contrast, by feeding on alternative
hosts the likelihood of the opportunistic species to contact LLIN is lower,
making them difficult to control. By maintaining high population size, the
proportion that feed on humans outdoors can sustain residual transmission despite
high LLIN usage in the village.
