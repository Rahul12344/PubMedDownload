BACKGROUND: To combat malaria transmission, the Ugandan government has embarked
upon an ambitious programme of indoor residual spraying (IRS) with a carbamate
class insecticide, bendiocarb. In preparation for this campaign, we characterized
bendiocarb resistance and associated transcriptional variation among Anopheles
gambiae s.s. mosquitoes from two sites in Uganda.
RESULTS: Gene expression in two mosquito populations displaying some resistance
to bendiocarb (95% and 79% An. gambiae s.l. WHO tube bioassay mortality in
Nagongera and Kihihi, respectively) was investigated using whole-genome
microarrays. Significant overexpression of several genes encoding salivary gland 
proteins, including D7r2 and D7r4, was detected in mosquitoes from Nagongera. In 
Kihihi, D7r4, two detoxification-associated genes (Cyp6m2 and Gstd3) and an
epithelial serine protease were among the genes most highly overexpressed in
resistant mosquitoes. Following the first round of IRS in Nagongera,
bendiocarb-resistant mosquitoes were collected, and real-time quantitative PCR
analyses detected significant overexpression of D7r2 and D7r4 in resistant
mosquitoes. A single nucleotide polymorphism located in a non-coding transcript
downstream of the D7 genes was found at a significantly higher frequency in
resistant individuals. In silico modelling of the interaction between D7r4 and
bendiocarb demonstrated similarity between the insecticide and serotonin, a known
ligand of D7 proteins. A meta-analysis of published microarray studies revealed a
recurring association between D7 expression and insecticide resistance across
Anopheles species and locations.
CONCLUSIONS: A whole-genome microarray approach identified an association between
novel insecticide resistance candidates and bendiocarb resistance in Uganda. In
addition, a single nucleotide polymorphism associated with this resistance
mechanism was discovered. The use of such impartial screening methods allows for 
discovery of resistance candidates that have no previously-ascribed function in
insecticide binding or detoxification. Characterizing these novel candidates will
broaden our understanding of resistance mechanisms and yield new strategies for
combatting widespread insecticide resistance among malaria vectors.
