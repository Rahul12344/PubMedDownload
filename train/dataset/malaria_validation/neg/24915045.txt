It has been theorized that inducing extreme reproductive sex ratios could be a
method to suppress or eliminate pest populations. Limited knowledge about the
genetic makeup and mode of action of naturally occurring sex distorters and the
prevalence of co-evolving suppressors has hampered their use for control. Here we
generate a synthetic sex distortion system by exploiting the specificity of the
homing endonuclease I-PpoI, which is able to selectively cleave ribosomal gene
sequences of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae that are located exclusively on
the mosquito's X chromosome. We combine structure-based protein engineering and
molecular genetics to restrict the activity of the potentially toxic endonuclease
to spermatogenesis. Shredding of the paternal X chromosome prevents it from being
transmitted to the next generation, resulting in fully fertile mosquito strains
that produce >95% male offspring. We demonstrate that distorter male mosquitoes
can efficiently suppress caged wild-type mosquito populations, providing the
foundation for a new class of genetic vector control strategies.
