The available tools for conditional gene expression in Plasmodium falciparum are 
limited. Here, to enable reliable control of target gene expression, we build a
system to efficiently modulate translation. We overcame several problems
associated with other approaches for regulating gene expression in P. falciparum.
Specifically, our system functions predictably across several native and
engineered promoter contexts, and affords control over reporter and native
parasite proteins irrespective of their subcellular compartmentalization.
Induction and repression of gene expression are rapid, homogeneous and stable
over prolonged periods. To demonstrate practical application of our system, we
used it to reveal direct links between antimalarial drugs and their native
parasite molecular target. This is an important outcome given the rapid spread of
resistance, and intensified efforts to efficiently discover and optimize new
antimalarial drugs. Overall, the studies presented highlight the utility of our
system for broadly controlling gene expression and performing functional genetics
in P. falciparum.
