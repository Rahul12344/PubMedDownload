BACKGROUND: Evolutionary pressure by Plasmodium falciparum malaria is known to
have favoured a large number of human gene adaptations, but there is surprisingly
little investigation of the effect of malaria on human mitochondrial sequence
variation. Plasmodium falciparum infection can cause severe malaria anaemia (SMA)
with insufficient tissue oxygenation, lactic acidosis and death. Despite equal
degrees of severe anaemia, some individuals develop lactic acidosis while others 
do not. A case-control study design was used to investigate whether differences
in host mitochondrial gene sequences were associated with lactic acidosis in SMA.
Full mitochondrial sequences were obtained from 36 subjects with SMA complicated 
by lactic acidosis and 37 subjects with SMA without lactic acidosis. The two
groups were matched for age, sex, and degree of anaemia.
RESULTS: Compared with the reference sequence, a median of 60 nucleotide variants
per individual (interquartile range 4-91) was found, with an average frequency of
3.97 variants per 1000 nucleotides. The frequency and distribution of
non-synonymous DNA variants in genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation
were not statistically different between the two groups. Non-synonymous variants 
predicted to have the most disruptive effect on proteins responsible for
oxidative phosphorylation were present at a similar frequency in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Lactic acidosis in SMA does not appear to be consistently associated
with the high prevalence of any mitochondrial gene variant.
