BACKGROUND: Malaria programmes use Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein-2
(PfHRP2) based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria diagnosis. The deletion 
of this target antigen could potentially lead to misdiagnosis, delayed treatment 
and continuation of active transmission.
METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum isolates (n = 1162) collected in Southern
Mozambique were assessed by RDTs, microscopy and/or 18SrRNA qPCR. pfhrp2 and
pfhrp3 deletions were investigated in isolates from individuals who were negative
by RDT but positive by microscopy and/or qPCR (n = 69) using gene-specific PCRs, 
with kelch13 PCR as the parasite DNA control.
RESULTS: Lack of pfhrp2 PCR amplification was observed in one of the 69 isolates 
subjected to molecular analysis [1.45% (95% CI 0.3-7.8%)].
CONCLUSIONS: The low prevalence of pfhrp2 deletions suggests that RDTs will
detect the vast majority of the P. falciparum infections. Nevertheless, active
surveillance for changing deletion frequencies is required.
