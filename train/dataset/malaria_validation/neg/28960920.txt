SCOPE: Haptoglobin (Hp), an acute phase inflammatory protein is associated with
malaria pathogenesis in several proteomics and genomics studies. The Hp gene has 
two co-dominant alleles: Hp1 and Hp2 that produce three genotypes: Hp1/Hp1,
Hp1/Hp2 and Hp2/Hp2.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, validation of the proteomics data with
Multiple Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectroscopy (MRM-MS) is performed and the
association of the Hp gene variants with severe, non-severe malaria and community
(healthy) controls using genotyping PCRs and DNA sequencing is analysed.
RESULTS: Highly significant values of Hp is observed in the MRM assay that show a
correlation with severity of malaria and is clearly distinguished from another
febrile disease, dengue. Moreover, the Hp2/Hp2 genotype is seen in high
percentages in non-severe malaria patients (74%) and community controls (72%)
whereas patients diagnosed with severe malaria show only (31%) of this genotype. 
Sequencing of the Hp promoter region reveals three SNPs along with 10 unique
haplotypes, out of which five are associated with non-severe and three with
severe malaria populations (χ2  = 130; df = 18; p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This proteo-genomic study focuses on the
correlation of the Hp protein and gene with malaria, thus highlighting the
pivotal role of this acute phase immune gene in malaria pathogenesis.
