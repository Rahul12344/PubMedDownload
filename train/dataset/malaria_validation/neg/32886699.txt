INTRODUCTION: False-negative malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) results amongst 
symptomatic malaria patients are detrimental as they could lead to ineffective
malaria case management. This study determined the nationwide contribution of
parasites with Pfhrp2 and Pfhrp 3 gene deletions to false negative malaria RDT
results in Ghana.
METHODS: This was a cross sectional study where whole blood (~2 ml) was collected
from patients presenting with malaria symptoms at 100 health facilities in all
the regions in Ghana from May to August 2018. An aliquot of the blood was used to
prepare thin and thick blood smears, filter paper blood spots (DBS) and spot a
PfHRP 2 RDT kit. The remaining blood was separated into plasma and blood cells
and stored at -20°C. Plasmodium parasite density and species identity was
estimated from the blood smears. Plasmodium falciparum specific 18S rRNA PCR,
merozoite surface protein (msp 1) and glutamate rich protein (glurp) gene PCR
were used to identify P. falciparum positive samples, which were subjected to
Pfhrp 2/3 exon1-2 and exon2 genotyping.
RESULTS: Of the 2,860 microscopically P. falciparum positive patients analyzed,
134 (4.69%) had false negative P. falciparum specific RDT results. Samples for
PCR analysis was available for 127 of the false negative patients, and the
analysis identified 116 (91.3%) as positive for P. falciparum. Only 58.1%
(79/116) of the false negative RDT samples tested positive by msp 1 and glurp
PCR. Genotyping of exon 1-2 and exon 2 of the Pfhrp 2 gene identified 12.9%
(10/79) and 39.5% (31/79) of samples respectively to have deletions. Genotyping
exon 1-2 and exon 2 of the Pfhrp 3 gene identified 15.2% (12/79) and 40.5%
(32/79) of samples respectively to have deletions. Only 5% (4/79) of the false
negative samples had deletions in both exon 1-2 and exon 2 of the Pfhrp 2 gene.
Out of the 49 samples that tested positive for aldolase by luminex, 32.6% (16/49)
and) had deletions in Pfhrp 2 exon 2 and 2% (1/49) had deletions in both exon 2
and exon 1-2 of the Pfhrp 2 gene.
CONCLUSIONS: The low prevalence of false negative RDT test results provides
assurance that PfHRP 2 based malaria RDT kits remain effective in diagnosing
symptomatic malaria patients across all the Regions of Ghana. Although there was 
a low prevalence of parasites with deletions in exon 2 and exon 1-2 of the Pfhrp 
2 gene the prevalence of parasites with deletions in Pfhrp 2 exon 2 was about a
third of the false negative RDT results. The need to ensure rapid, accurate and
reliable malaria diagnosis requires continuous surveillance of parasites with
Pfhrp 2 gene deletions.
