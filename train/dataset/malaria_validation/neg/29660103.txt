Background: Submicroscopic malaria infections contribute to malaria transmission.
Describing the extent of the parasite reservoir is of importance. In people
living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the frequency of subpatent
malaria infections is rarely reported. The aim of the present study was to
determine the frequency of submicroscopic infections in people living with HIV in
Gabon and its relationship with cotrimoxazole (CTX) use.
Methods: A survey was conducted in two health care centres in rural areas
(Koulamoutou and Oyem) and three in urban areas (Libreville) of Gabon from March 
2015 to June 2016. Blood samples were collected from consenting people living
with HIV with a negative blood smear. Information on CTX and antiretroviral
therapy intake was recorded from the medical file of the patient and through an
interview. For molecular analysis, the Plasmodium small subunit ribosomal RNA
gene was amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction.
Results: Submicroscopic infections were detected in 10.1% (n=12/119) of the
people living with HIV, more frequently in those residing in rural areas (15.1%) 
compared with urban areas (2.1%) (p<0.01). The proportion of anaemic patients was
1.74-fold more frequent in malaria-infected patients, although not statistically 
significant. Submicroscopic infections frequency did not vary according to CTX
intake (p=0.6).
Conclusions: The present pilot study highlights a non-negligible frequency of
submicroscopic malaria infections in people living with HIV from rural areas, but
no relationship with CTX intake was found.
