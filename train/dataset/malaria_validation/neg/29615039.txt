BACKGROUND: The Angolan government recommends three artemisinin-based
combinations for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria:
artemether-lumefantrine (AL), artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ), and
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP). Due to the threat of emerging anti-malarial 
drug resistance, it is important to periodically monitor the efficacy of
artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). This study evaluated these
medications' therapeutic efficacy in Benguela, Lunda Sul, and Zaire Provinces.
METHODS: Enrollment occurred between March and July 2017. Study participants were
children with P. falciparum monoinfection from each provincial capital.
Participants received a 3-day course of a quality-assured artemisinin-based
combination and were monitored for 28 (AL and ASAQ arms) or 42 days (DP arm).
Each ACT was assessed in two provinces. The primary study endpoints were: (1)
follow-up without complications and (2) failure to respond to treatment or
development of recurrent P. falciparum infection. Parasites from each patient
experiencing recurrent infection were genotyped to differentiate new infection
from recrudescence of persistent parasitaemia. These parasites were also analysed
for molecular markers associated with ACT resistance.
RESULTS: Of 608 children enrolled in the study, 540 (89%) reached a primary study
endpoint. Parasitaemia was cleared within 3 days of medication administration in 
all participants, and no early treatment failures were observed. After exclusion 
of reinfections, the corrected efficacy of AL was 96% (91-100%, 95% confidence
interval) in Zaire and 97% (93-100%) in Lunda Sul. The corrected efficacy of ASAQ
was 100% (97-100%) in Benguela and 93% (88-99%) in Zaire. The corrected efficacy 
of DP was 100% (96-100%) in Benguela and 100% in Lunda Sul. No mutations
associated with artemisinin resistance were identified in the pfk13 gene in the
38 cases of recurrent P. falciparum infection. All 33 treatment failures in the
AL and ASAQ arms carried pfmdr1 or pfcrt mutations associated with lumefantrine
and amodiaquine resistance, respectively, on day of failure.
CONCLUSIONS: AL, ASAQ, and DP continue to be efficacious against P. falciparum
malaria in these provinces of Angola. Rapid parasite clearance and the absence of
genetic evidence of artemisinin resistance are consistent with full
susceptibility to artemisinin derivatives. Periodic monitoring of in vivo drug
efficacy remains a priority routine activity for Angola.
