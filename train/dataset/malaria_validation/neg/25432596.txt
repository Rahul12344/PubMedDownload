BACKGROUND: Only a small fraction of the mosquito species of the genus Anopheles 
are able to transmit malaria, one of the biggest killer diseases of poverty,
which is mostly prevalent in the tropics. This diversity has genetic, yet
unknown, causes. In a further attempt to contribute to the elucidation of these
variances, the international "Anopheles Genomes Cluster Consortium" project
(a.k.a. "16 Anopheles genomes project") was established, aiming at a
comprehensive genomic analysis of several anopheline species, most of which are
malaria vectors. In the frame of the international consortium carrying out this
project our team studied the genes encoding families of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs),
concentrating on four classes: microRNA (miRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), small
nuclear RNA (snRNA), and in particular small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and, finally,
transfer RNA (tRNA).
RESULTS: Our analysis was carried out using, exclusively, computational
approaches, and evaluating both the primary NGS reads as well as the respective
genome assemblies produced by the consortium and stored in VectorBase; moreover, 
the results of RNAseq surveys in cases in which these were available and
meaningful were also accessed in order to obtain supplementary data, as were
"pre-genomic era" sequence data stored in nucleic acid databases. The
investigation included the identification and analysis, in most species studied, 
of ncRNA genes belonging to several families, as well as the analysis of the
evolutionary relations of some of those genes in cross-comparisons to other
members of the genus Anopheles.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study led to the identification of members of these gene
families in the majority of twenty different anopheline taxa. A set of tools for 
the study of the evolution and molecular biology of important disease vectors
has, thus, been obtained.
