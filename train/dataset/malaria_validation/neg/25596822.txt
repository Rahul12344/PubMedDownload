Mosquitoes are high-impact disease vectors with the capacity to transmit
pathogenic agents that cause diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, chikungunya,
and dengue. Continued growth in knowledge of genetic, molecular, and
physiological pathways in mosquitoes allows for the development of novel control 
methods and for the continued optimization of existing ones. The emergence of
site-specific nucleases as genomic engineering tools promises to expedite
research of crucial biological pathways in these disease vectors. The utilization
of these nucleases in a more precise and efficient manner is dependent upon
knowledge and manipulation of the DNA repair pathways utilized by the mosquito.
While progress has been made in deciphering DNA repair pathways in some model
systems, research into the nature of the hierarchy of mosquito DNA repair
pathways, as well as in mechanistic differences that may exist, is needed. In
this review, we will describe progress in the use of site-specific nucleases in
mosquitoes, along with the hierarchy of DNA repair in the context of mosquito
chromosomal organization and structure, and how this knowledge may be manipulated
to achieve precise chromosomal engineering in mosquitoes.
