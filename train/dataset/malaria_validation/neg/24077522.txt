The majority of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) detect Plasmodium
falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2), encoded by the pfhrp2 gene.
Recently, P. falciparum isolates from Peru were found to lack pfhrp2 leading to
false-negative RDT results. We hypothesized that pfhrp2-deleted parasites in Peru
derived from a single genetic event. We evaluated the parasite population
structure and pfhrp2 haplotype of samples collected between 1998 and 2005 using
seven neutral and seven chromosome 8 microsatellite markers, respectively. Five
distinct pfhrp2 haplotypes, corresponding to five neutral microsatellite-based
clonal lineages, were detected in 1998-2001; pfhrp2 deletions occurred within
four haplotypes. In 2003-2005, outcrossing among the parasite lineages resulted
in eight population clusters that inherited the five pfhrp2 haplotypes seen
previously and a new haplotype; pfhrp2 deletions occurred within four of these
haplotypes. These findings indicate that the genetic origin of pfhrp2 deletion in
Peru was not a single event, but likely occurred multiple times.
