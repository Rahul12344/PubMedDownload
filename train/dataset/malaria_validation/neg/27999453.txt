Polymorphisms in cytokine genes can alter the production of these proteins and
consequently affect the immune response. The trihybrid heterogeneity of the
Brazilian population is characterized as a condition for the use of ancestry
informative markers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the frequency of
-1031T>C, -308G>A and -238G>A TNFA, +874 A>T IFNG and -819C>T, and -592C>A IL10
gene polymorphisms and their association with malaria vivax and genomic ancestry.
Samples from 90 vivax malaria-infected individuals and 51 noninfected individuals
from northern Brazil were evaluated. Genotyping was carried out by using ASO-PCR 
or PCR/RFLP. The genomic ancestry of the individuals was classified using 48
insertion/deletion polymorphism biallelic markers. There were no differences in
the proportions of African, European, and Native American ancestry between men
and women. No significant association was observed for the allele and genotype
frequencies of the 6 SNPs between malaria-infected and noninfected individuals.
However, there was a trend toward decreasing the frequency of individuals
carrying the TNF-308A allele with the increasing proportion of European ancestry.
No ethnic-specific SNPs were identified, and there was no allelic or genotype
association with susceptibility or resistance to vivax malaria. Understanding the
genomic mechanisms by which ancestry influences this association is critical and 
requires further study.
