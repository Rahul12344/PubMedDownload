Plasmodium parasites must complete development in the mosquito vector for
transmission to occur. The mosquito innate immune response is remarkably
efficient in limiting parasite numbers. Previous work has identified a
LPS-induced TNFÎ± transcription factor (LITAF)-like transcription factor,
LITAF-like 3 (LL3), which significantly influences parasite numbers. Here, we
demonstrate that LL3 does not influence invasion of the mosquito midgut
epithelium or ookinete-to-oocyst differentiation but mediates a late-phase immune
response that decreases oocyst survival. LL3 expression in the midgut and
hemocytes is activated by ookinete midgut invasion and is independent of the
mosquito microbiota, suggesting that LL3 may be a component of a wound-healing
response. LL3 silencing abrogates the ability of mosquito hemocytes to
differentiate and respond to parasite infection, implicating hemocytes as
critical modulators of the late-phase immune response.
