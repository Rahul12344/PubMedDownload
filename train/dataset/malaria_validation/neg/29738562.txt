INTRODUCTION: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most
common enzymopathy in the human population affecting an estimated 8% of the world
population, especially those living in areas of past and present malaria
endemicity. Decreased G6PD enzymatic activity is associated with drug-induced
hemolysis and increased risk of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia leading to
brain damage. The G6PD gene is on the X chromosome therefore mutations cause
enzymatic deficiency in hemizygote males and homozygote females while the
majority of heterozygous females have an intermediate activity (between 30-80% of
normal) with a large distribution into the range of deficiency and normality.
Current G6PD qualitative tests are unable to diagnose G6PD intermediate
activities which could hinder wide use of 8-aminoquinolines for Plasmodium vivax 
elimination. The aim of the study was to assess the diagnostic performances of
the new Carestart G6PD quantitative biosensor.
METHODS: A total of 150 samples of venous blood with G6PD deficient, intermediate
and normal phenotypes were collected among healthy volunteers living along the
north-western Thailand-Myanmar border. Samples were analyzed by complete blood
count, by gold standard spectrophotometric assay using Trinity kits and by the
latest model of Carestart G6PD biosensor which analyzes both G6PD and hemoglobin.
RESULTS: Bland-Altman comparison of the CareStart normalized G6PD values to that 
of the gold standard assay showed a strong bias in values resulting in poor area 
under-the-curve values for both 30% and 80% thresholds. Performing a receiver
operator curve identified threshold values for the CareStart product equivalent
to the 30% and 80% gold standard values with good sensitivity and specificity
values, 100% and 92% (for 30% G6PD activity) and 92% and 94% (for 80% activity)
respectively.
CONCLUSION: The Carestart G6PD biosensor represents a significant improvement for
quantitative diagnosis of G6PD deficiency over previous versions. Further
improvements and validation studies are required to assess its utility for
informing radical cure decisions in malaria endemic settings.
