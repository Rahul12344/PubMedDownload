Plasmodium falciparum histone deacetylases (PfHDACs) are an important class of
epigenetic regulators that alter protein lysine acetylation, contributing to
regulation of gene expression and normal parasite growth and development. PfHDACs
are therefore under investigation as drug targets for malaria. Despite this, our 
understanding of the biological roles of these enzymes is only just beginning to 
emerge. In higher eukaryotes, HDACs function as part of multi-protein complexes
and act on both histone and non-histone substrates. Here, we present a proteomics
analysis of PfHDAC1 immunoprecipitates, identifying 26 putative P. falciparum
complex proteins in trophozoite-stage asexual intraerythrocytic parasites. The
co-migration of two of these (P. falciparum heat shock proteins 70-1 and 90) with
PfHDAC1 was validated using Blue Native PAGE combined with Western blot. These
data provide a snapshot of possible PfHDAC1 interactions and a starting point for
future studies focused on elucidating the broader function of PfHDACs in
Plasmodium parasites.
