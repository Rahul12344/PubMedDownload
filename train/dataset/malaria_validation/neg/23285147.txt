Functional studies have demonstrated a role for the Anopheles gambiae APL1A gene 
in resistance against the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Here, we
exhaustively characterize the structure of the APL1 locus and show that three
structurally different APL1A alleles segregate in the Ngousso colony. Genetic
association combined with RNAi-mediated gene silencing revealed that APL1A
alleles display distinct protective profiles against P. falciparum. One APL1A
allele is sufficient to explain the protective phenotype of APL1A observed in
silencing experiments. Epitope-tagged APL1A isoforms expressed in an in vitro
hemocyte-like cell system showed that under assay conditions, the most protective
APL1A isoform (APL1A(2)) localizes within large cytoplasmic vesicles, is not
constitutively secreted, and forms only one protein complex, while a less
protective isoform (APL1A(1)) is constitutively secreted in at least two protein 
complexes. The tested alleles are identical to natural variants in the wild A.
gambiae population, suggesting that APL1A genetic variation could be a factor
underlying natural heterogeneity of vector susceptibility to P. falciparum.
