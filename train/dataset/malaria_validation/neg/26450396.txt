DNA vaccines against infection with Plasmodium have been highly successful in
rodent models of malaria and have shown promise in the very limited number of
clinical trials conducted so far. The vaccine platform is highly attractive for
numerous reasons, such as low cost and a very favorable safety profile. Gene gun 
delivery of DNA plasmids drastically reduces the vaccine dose and does not only
have the potential to make vaccines more accessible and affordable, but also
simplifies (a) the testing of novel antigens as vaccine candidates, (b) the
testing of antigen combinations, and (c) the co-delivery of antigens with
molecular adjuvants such as cytokines or costimulatory molecules. Described in
this chapter are the preparation of the inoculum (i.e., DNA plasmids attached to 
gold particles, coating to the inside of plastic tubing also referred to as gene 
gun "bullets" or cartridges), the gene gun vaccination procedure, and the
challenge of mice with Plasmodium berghei parasites to test the efficacy of the
experimental vaccine.
