Acquired antimalarial drug resistance produces treatment failures and has led to 
periods of global disease resurgence. In Plasmodium falciparum, resistance is
known to arise through genome-level changes such as mutations and gene
duplications. We now report an epigenetic resistance mechanism involving genes
responsible for the plasmodial surface anion channel, a nutrient channel that
also transports ions and antimalarial compounds at the host erythrocyte membrane.
Two blasticidin S-resistant lines exhibited markedly reduced expression of clag
genes linked to channel activity, but had no genome-level changes. Silencing
aborted production of the channel protein and was directly responsible for
reduced uptake. Silencing affected clag paralogs on two chromosomes and was
mediated by specific histone modifications, allowing a rapidly reversible drug
resistance phenotype advantageous to the parasite. These findings implicate a
novel epigenetic resistance mechanism that involves reduced host cell uptake and 
is a worrisome liability for water-soluble antimalarial drugs.
