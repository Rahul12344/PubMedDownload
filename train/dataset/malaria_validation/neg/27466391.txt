Monoallelic expression of the var multigene family enables immune evasion of the 
malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in its human host. At a given time only a 
single member of the 60-member var gene family is expressed at a discrete
perinuclear region called the 'var expression site'. However, the mechanism of
var gene counting remains ill-defined. We hypothesize that activation factors
associating specifically with the expression site play a key role in this
process. Here, we investigate the role of a GC-rich non-coding RNA (ncRNA) gene
family composed of 15 highly homologous members. GC-rich genes are positioned
adjacent to var genes in chromosome-central gene clusters but are absent near
subtelomeric var genes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrates that
GC-rich ncRNA localizes to the perinuclear expression site of central and
subtelomeric var genes in trans. Importantly, overexpression of distinct GC-rich 
ncRNA members disrupts the gene counting process at the single cell level and
results in activation of a specific subset of var genes in distinct clones. We
identify the first trans-acting factor targeted to the elusive perinuclear var
expression site and open up new avenues to investigate ncRNA function in
antigenic variation of malaria and other protozoan pathogens.
