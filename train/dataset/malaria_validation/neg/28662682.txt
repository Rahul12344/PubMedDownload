BACKGROUND: The burden of falciparum malaria is especially high in sub-Saharan
Africa. Differences in pressure from host immunity and antimalarial drugs lead to
adaptive changes responsible for high level of genetic variations within and
between the parasite populations. Population-specific genetic studies to survey
for genes under positive or balancing selection resulting from drug pressure or
host immunity will allow for refinement of interventions.
METHODS: We performed a pooled sequencing (pool-seq) of the genomes of 100
Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Nigeria. We explored allele-frequency based
neutrality test (Tajima's D) and integrated haplotype score (iHS) to identify
genes under selection.
RESULTS: Fourteen shared iHS regions that had at least 2 SNPs with a score > 2.5 
were identified. These regions code for genes that were likely to have been under
strong directional selection. Two of these genes were the chloroquine resistance 
transporter (CRT) on chromosome 7 and the multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) on
chromosome 5. There was a weak signature of selection in the dihydrofolate
reductase (DHFR) gene on chromosome 4 and MDR5 genes on chromosome 13, with only 
2 and 3 SNPs respectively identified within the iHS window. We observed strong
selection pressure attributable to continued chloroquine and
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine use despite their official proscription for the
treatment of uncomplicated malaria. There was also a major selective sweep on
chromosome 6 which had 32 SNPs within the shared iHS region. Tajima's D of
circumsporozoite protein (CSP), erythrocyte-binding antigen (EBA-175), merozoite 
surface proteins - MSP3 and MSP7, merozoite surface protein duffy binding-like
(MSPDBL2) and serine repeat antigen (SERA-5) were 1.38, 1.29, 0.73, 0.84 and
0.21, respectively.
CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated the use of pool-seq to understand genomic
patterns of selection and variability in P. falciparum from Nigeria, which bears 
the highest burden of infections. This investigation identified known genomic
signatures of selection from drug pressure and host immunity. This is evidence
that P. falciparum populations explore common adaptive strategies that can be
targeted for the development of new interventions.
