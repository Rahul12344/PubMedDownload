Plasmodium aspartic proteases, termed plasmepsins (PMs) play many critical roles 
such as haemoglobin degradation, cleavage of PEXEL proteins and sporozoite
development in the parasite life cycle. Most of the plasmepsins are well
characterized, however the role of PM VIII in Plasmodium remains unknown. Here,
we elucidate the functions of PM VIII (PBANKA_132910) in the rodent malaria
parasite Plasmodium berghei (Pb). By targeted gene deletion, we show that PbPM
VIII is critical for sporozoite egress from an oocyst and gliding motility, which
is a prerequisite for the invasion of salivary glands and subsequent transmission
to the vertebrate host.
