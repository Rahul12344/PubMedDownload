BACKGROUND: There are over 200 million reported cases of malaria each year, and
most children living in endemic areas will experience multiple episodes of
clinical disease before puberty. We set out to understand how frequent clinical
malaria, which elicits a strong inflammatory response, affects the immune system 
and whether these modifications are observable in the absence of detectable
parasitaemia.
METHODS: We used a multi-dimensional approach comprising whole blood
transcriptomic, cellular and plasma cytokine analyses on a cohort of children
living with endemic malaria, but uninfected at sampling, who had been under
active surveillance for malaria for 8 years. Children were categorised into two
groups depending on the cumulative number of episodes experienced: high (≥ 8) or 
low (< 5).
RESULTS: We observe that multiple episodes of malaria are associated with
modification of the immune system. Children who had experienced a large number of
episodes demonstrated upregulation of interferon-inducible genes, a clear
increase in circulating levels of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 and
enhanced activation of neutrophils, B cells and CD8+ T cells.
CONCLUSION: Transcriptomic analysis together with cytokine and immune cell
profiling of peripheral blood can robustly detect immune differences between
children with different numbers of prior malaria episodes. Multiple episodes of
malaria are associated with modification of the immune system in children. Such
immune modifications may have implications for the initiation of subsequent
immune responses and the induction of vaccine-mediated protection.
