The emergence of artemisinin (ART) resistance in Plasmodium falciparum
intra-erythrocytic parasites has led to increasing treatment failure rates with
first-line ART-based combination therapies in Southeast Asia. Decreased parasite 
susceptibility is caused by K13 mutations, which are associated clinically with
delayed parasite clearance in patients and in vitro with an enhanced ability of
ring-stage parasites to survive brief exposure to the active ART metabolite
dihydroartemisinin. Herein, we describe a panel of K13-specific monoclonal
antibodies and gene-edited parasite lines co-expressing epitope-tagged versions
of K13 in trans. By applying an analytical quantitative imaging pipeline, we
localize K13 to the parasite endoplasmic reticulum, Rab-positive vesicles, and
sites adjacent to cytostomes. These latter structures form at the parasite plasma
membrane and traffic hemoglobin to the digestive vacuole wherein
artemisinin-activating heme moieties are released. We also provide evidence of
K13 partially localizing near the parasite mitochondria upon treatment with
dihydroartemisinin. Immunoprecipitation data generated with K13-specific
monoclonal antibodies identify multiple putative K13-associated proteins,
including endoplasmic reticulum-resident molecules, mitochondrial proteins, and
Rab GTPases, in both K13 mutant and wild-type isogenic lines. We also find that
mutant K13-mediated resistance is reversed upon co-expression of wild-type or
mutant K13. These data help define the biological properties of K13 and its role 
in mediating P. falciparum resistance to ART treatment.
