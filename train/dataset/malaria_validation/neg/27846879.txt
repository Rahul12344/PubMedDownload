BACKGROUND: The Greater Mekong Subregion is aiming to achieve regional malaria
elimination by 2030. Though a shift in malaria parasite species predominance by
Plasmodium vivax has been recently documented, the transmission of the two minor 
Plasmodium species, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale spp., is poorly
characterized in the region. This study aims to determine the prevalence of these
minor species in the China-Myanmar border area and their genetic diversity.
METHODS: Epidemiology study was conducted during passive case detection in
hospitals and clinics in Myanmar and four counties in China along the
China-Myanmar border. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in villages and
camps for internally displaced persons to determine the prevalence of malaria
infections. Malaria infections were diagnosed initially by microscopy and later
in the laboratory using nested PCR for the SSU rRNA genes. Plasmodium malariae
and P. ovale infections were confirmed by sequencing the PCR products. The P.
ovale subtypes were determined by sequencing the Pocytb, Pocox1 and Pog3p genes. 
Parasite populations were evaluated by PCR amplification and sequencing of the
MSP-1 genes. Antifolate sensitivity was assessed by sequencing the dhfr-ts and
dhps genes from the P. malariae and P. ovale isolates.
RESULTS: Analysis of 2701 blood samples collected from the China-Myanmar border
by nested PCR targeting the parasite SSU rRNA genes identified 561 malaria cases,
including 161 Plasmodium falciparum, 327 P. vivax, 66 P. falciparum/P. vivax
mixed infections, 4 P. malariae and 3 P. ovale spp. P. vivax and P. falciparum
accounted for >60 and ~30% of all malaria cases, respectively. In comparison, the
prevalence of P. malariae and P. ovale spp. was very low and only made up ~1% of 
all PCR-positive cases. Nevertheless, these two species were often misidentified 
as P. vivax infections or completely missed by microscopy even among symptomatic 
patients. Phylogenetic analysis of the SSU rRNA, Pocytb, Pocox1 and Pog3p genes
confirmed that the three P. ovale spp. isolates belonged to the subtype P. ovale 
curtisi. Low-level genetic diversity was detected in the MSP-1, dhfr and dhps
genes of these minor parasite species, potentially stemming from the low
prevalence of these parasites preventing their mixing. Whereas most of the dhfr
and dhps positions equivalent to those conferring antifolate resistance in P.
falciparum and P. vivax were wild type, a new mutation S113C corresponding to the
S108 position in pfdhfr was identified in two P. ovale curtisi isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: The four human malaria parasite species all occurred sympatrically
at the China-Myanmar border. While P. vivax has become the predominant species,
the two minor parasite species also occurred at very low prevalence but were
often misidentified or missed by conventional microscopy. These minor parasite
species displayed low levels of polymorphisms in the msp-1, dhfr and dhps genes.
