Protein export into the host red blood cell is one of the key processes in the
pathobiology of the malaria parasite Plasmodiumtrl falciparum, which extensively 
remodels the red blood cell to ensure its virulence and survival. In this study, 
we aimed to shed further light on the protein export mechanisms in the rodent
malaria parasite P. berghei and provide further proof of the conserved nature of 
host cell remodeling in Plasmodium spp. Based on the presence of an export motif 
(R/KxLxE/Q/D) termed PEXEL (Plasmodium export element), we have generated
transgenic P. berghei parasite lines expressing GFP chimera of putatively
exported proteins and analysed one of the newly identified exported proteins in
detail. This essential protein, termed PbCP1 (P. berghei Cleft-like Protein 1),
harbours an atypical PEXEL motif (RxLxY) and is further characterised by two
predicted transmembrane domains (2TMD) in the C-terminal end of the protein. We
have functionally validated the unusual PEXEL motif in PbCP1 and analysed the
role of the 2TMD region, which is required to recruit PbCP1 to discrete
membranous structures in the red blood cell cytosol that have a convoluted,
vesico-tubular morphology by electron microscopy. Importantly, this study reveals
that rodent malaria species also induce modifications to their host red blood
cell.
