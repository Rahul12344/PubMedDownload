According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Plasmodium falciparum is the
deadliest parasite among all species. This parasite possesses the ability to
sense molecules, including melatonin (MEL) and cAMP, and modulate its cell cycle 
accordingly. MEL synchronizes the development of this malaria parasite by
activating several cascades, including the generation of the second messenger
cAMP. Therefore, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis in P. falciparum 
erythrocytic stages (ring, trophozoite and schizont) treated with MEL and cAMP.
To investigate the expression profile of P. falciparum genes regulated by MEL and
cAMP, we performed RNA-Seq analysis in three P. falciparum strains (control, 3D7;
protein kinase 7 knockout, PfPK7-; and PfPK7 complement, PfPK7C). In the 3D7
strain, 38 genes were differentially expressed upon MEL treatment; however, none 
of the genes in the trophozoite (T) stage PfPK7- knockout parasites were
differentially expressed upon MEL treatment for 5 hours compared to untreated
controls, suggesting that PfPK7 may be involved in the signaling leading to
differential gene expression. Moreover, we found that MEL modified the mRNA
expression of genes encoding membrane proteins, zinc ion-binding proteins and
nucleic acid-binding proteins, which might influence numerous functions in the
parasite. The RNA-Seq data following treatment with cAMP show that this molecule 
modulates different genes throughout the intraerythrocytic cycle, namely, 75, 101
and 141 genes, respectively, in the ring (R), T and schizont (S) stages. Our
results highlight P. falciparum's perception of the external milieu through the
signaling molecules MEL and cAMP, which are able to drive to changes in gene
expression in the parasite.
