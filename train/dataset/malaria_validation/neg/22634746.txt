Malaria is responsible for more than 1.5 million deaths each year, especially
among children (Snow et al. 2005). Despite of the severity of malaria situation
and great effort to the development of new drug targets (Yuan et al. 2011) there 
is still a relative low investment toward antimalarial drugs. Briefly there are
targets classes of antimalarial drugs currently being tested including: kinases, 
proteases, ion channel of GPCR, nuclear receptor, among others (Gamo et al.
2010). Here we review malaria signal transduction pathways in Red Blood Cells
(RBC) as well as infected RBCs and endothelial cells interactions, namely
cytoadherence. The last process is thought to play an important role in the
pathogenesis of severe malaria. The molecules displayed on the surface of both
infected erythrocytes (IE) and vascular endothelial cells (EC) exert themselves
as important mediators in cytoadherence, in that they not only induce structural 
and metabolic changes on both sides, but also trigger multiple signal
transduction processes, leading to alteration of gene expression, with the
balance between positive and negative regulation determining endothelial
pathology during a malaria infection.
