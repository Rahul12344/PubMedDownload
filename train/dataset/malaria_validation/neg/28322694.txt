In Africa, control programs that target primarily Plasmodium falciparum are
inadequate for eliminating malaria. To learn more about prevalence and genetic
variability of P. malariae in Africa, we examined blood samples from 663
asymptomatic and 245 symptomatic persons from western Kenya during June-August of
2014 and 2015. P. malariae accounted for 5.3% (35/663) of asymptomatic infections
and 3.3% (8/245) of clinical cases. Among asymptomatic persons, 71% (32/45) of P.
malariae infections detected by PCR were undetected by microscopy. The low
sensitivity of microscopy probably results from the significantly lower
parasitemia of P. malariae. Analyses of P. malariae circumsporozoite protein gene
sequences revealed high genetic diversity among P. malariae in Africa, but no
clear differentiation among geographic populations was observed. Our findings
suggest that P. malariae should be included in the malaria elimination strategy
in Africa and highlight the need for sensitive and field-applicable methods to
identify P. malariae in malaria-endemic areas.
