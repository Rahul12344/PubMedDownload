Pathogens, and the infectious diseases they cause, have been paramount among the 
threats encountered by humans in their expansions throughout the globe. Numerous 
studies have identified immunity and host defence genes as being among the
functions most strongly targeted by selection, most likely pathogen-driven. The
dissection of the form and intensity of such selective pressures have increased
our knowledge of the biological relevance of the underlying immunological
mechanisms in host defence. Although the identities of the specific infectious
agents imposing these selective pressures remain, in most cases, elusive, the
impact of several pathogens, notably malaria and cholera, has been described.
However, past selection against infectious diseases may have some fitness costs
upon environmental changes, potentially leading to maladaptation and
immunopathology.
