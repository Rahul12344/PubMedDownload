OBJECTIVE: To investigate the seroprevalence of Sarcocystosis in the local
communities of Pangkor and Tioman islands, Malaysia, by using antigenic
recombinant surface antigens 2 and 3 from Sarcocystis falcatula (rSfSAG2 and
rSfSAG3) as the target proteins via Western blot and ELISA assays.
METHODS: SfSAG2 and SfSAG3 genes were isolated from S. falcatula and expressed in
Escherichia coli expression system. A total of 348 serum samples [volunteers from
both islands (n = 100), non-Sarcocystis parasitic infections patients (n = 50)
and healthy donors (n = 100)] were collected and tested with purified SfSAGs in
Western blot and ELISA assays to measure the seroprevalence of human
sarcocystosis.
RESULTS: None of the sera in this study reacted with rSfSAG2 by Western blot and 
ELISA. For rSfSAG3, relatively high prevalence of sarcocystosis was observed in
Tioman Island (75.5%) than in Pangkor Island (34%) by Western blot. In ELISA, the
different prevalence rate was observed between Tioman Island (43.8%) and Pangkor 
Island (37%). The prevalence rate in other parasitic infections (amoebiasis,
cysticercosis, filariasis, malaria, toxocariasis and toxoplasmosis) was 30% by
Western blot and 26% by ELISA. Only 8% (by Western blot) and 10% (by ELISA) of
healthy donors showed reactivity towards rSfSAG3.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study reporting a seroprevalence of sarcocystosis
in Pangkor and Tioman Islands, Malaysia. The combination of Western blot and
ELISA is suitable to be used for serodiagnosis of sarcocystosis. With further
evaluations, SfSAG3 can potentially be used to confirm infection, asymptomatic
screening, surveillance and epidemiological studies.
