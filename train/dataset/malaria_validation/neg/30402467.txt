Background: Insecticide resistance monitoring of the malaria vectors to different
classes of insecticides is necessary for resistance management. Malaria vector
control management approaches are essentially based on IRS and LLINs. However,
insecticide resistance is caused by several sources of selection and in case the 
selection pressure is from agricultural practices, then measures need to be taken
to avoid a failure of the control methods put in place. The current study was
undertaken to monitor the susceptibility of vectors to different classes of
insecticides in areas of varying agrochemical use patterns.
Methods: A survey to determine the agricultural chemical use pattern was
undertaken in ten localities across Côte d'Ivoire. In addition, WHO
susceptibility tests were carried out on adults Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes
emerging from collected larvae from the sites surveyed. Four insecticides from
each class of the four classes of insecticides were evaluated using the standard 
susceptibility test methods. Furthermore, the target site mutations involved in
resistance mechanisms were identified following the Taqman assay protocols and
mosquito species were identified using SINE-PCR.
Results: The mortalities of all the An. gambiae s.l populations were similar
regardless of the pesticide use pattern. The vectors were resistant to DDT,
deltamethrin, and bendiocarb in all localities. In contrast, mosquitoes showed
high susceptibility to malathion. High frequency of the Kdr-West gene allele was 
observed (70-100%). A single Kdr-East mutation was identified in a mosquito that 
harboured both Ace-1 and Kdr-West genes.
Conclusion: Cultivated marshlands representing good habitats for mosquito
development may deeply contribute to the selection of resistance genes given the 
intensive use of agrochemical for crop protection. In view of these, special
attention must be given to them to mitigate mosquito resistance to insecticides.
