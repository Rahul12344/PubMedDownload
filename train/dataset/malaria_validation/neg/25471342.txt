BACKGROUND: Complexes of cryptic species are common in several taxa and this is
also the case in the Anopheles genus, a group including all known human malaria
vectors. The Anopheles albitarsis complex comprises at least nine cryptic
species, some of which are implicated as vectors of human malaria. Several
different types of data have been generated for this species complex such as
cytogenetics, alloenzymes, morphological and feeding behavioral, hybridization
experiments, RAPD-PCR and RFLP and mitochondrial and nuclear markers. Studies
focused on its postzygotic isolation are still somewhat rare in the literature
despite their importance to understand the speciation process and the level of
gene flow potentially occurring among the different sibling species.
METHODS: Hybridization experiments between Anopheles albitarsis s.s. and
Anopheles marajoara, as well as backcrosses between hybrids and Anopheles
albitarsis s.s., were performed using the induced mating technique. Results were 
compared to intraspecific crosses. Larva-to-adult viability and sex ratio were
also assessed.
RESULTS: Male hybrids show very low insemination rates and nearly complete
sterility, apparently due to abnormalities in their reproductive organs. Evidence
of partial sterility among the hybrid females was also observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that Anopheles albitarsis s.s. and Anopheles
marajoara show a high level of postzygotic isolation with a strong hybrid male
sterility. This result is consistent with the Haldane's rule which states that in
interspecific crosses the heterogametic sex is the first to be affected. However,
the fact that the females are not completely sterile raises the possibility of
introgression between these two siblings species.
