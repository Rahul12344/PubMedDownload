During the clinically silent liver stage of a Plasmodium infection the parasite
replicates from a single sporozoite into thousands of merozoites. Infection of
humans and rodents with large numbers of sporozoites that arrest their
development within the liver can cause sterile protection from subsequent
infections. Disruption of genes essential for liver stage development of rodent
malaria parasites has yielded a number of attenuated parasite strains. A key
question to this end is how increased attenuation relates to vaccine efficacy.
Here, we generated rodent malaria parasite lines that arrest during liver stage
development and probed the impact of multiple gene deletions on attenuation and
protective efficacy. In contrast to P. berghei strain ANKA LISP2(-) or uis3(-)
single knockout parasites, which occasionally caused breakthrough infections, the
double mutant lacking both genes was completely attenuated even when high numbers
of sporozoites were administered. However, different vaccination protocols showed
that LISP2(-) parasites protected better than uis3(-) and double mutants. Hence, 
deletion of several genes can yield increased safety but might come at the cost
of protective efficacy.
