BACKGROUND: It has been shown that nearly a quarter of the initial predicted gene
models in the Plasmodium falciparum genome contain errors. Although there have
been efforts to obtain complete cDNA sequences to correct the errors, the
coverage of cDNA sequences on the predicted genes is still incomplete, and many
gene models for those expressed in sexual or mosquito stages have not been
validated. Antisense transcripts have widely been reported in P. falciparum;
however, the extent and pattern of antisense transcripts in different
developmental stages remain largely unknown.
RESULTS: We have sequenced seven bidirectional libraries from ring, early and
late trophozoite, schizont, gametocyte II, gametocyte V, and ookinete, and four
strand-specific libraries from late trophozoite, schizont, gametocyte II, and
gametocyte V of the 3D7 parasites. Alignment of the cDNA sequences to the 3D7
reference genome revealed stage-specific antisense transcripts and novel
intron-exon splicing junctions. Sequencing of strand-specific cDNA libraries
suggested that more genes are expressed in one direction in gametocyte than in
schizont. Alternatively spliced genes, antisense transcripts, and stage-specific 
expressed genes were also characterized.
CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to continue to sequence cDNA from different
developmental stages, particularly those of non-erythrocytic stages. The presence
of antisense transcripts in some gametocyte and ookinete genes suggests that
these antisense RNA may play an important role in gene expression regulation and 
parasite development. Future gene expression studies should make use of
directional cDNA libraries. Antisense transcripts may partly explain the observed
discrepancy between levels of mRNA and protein expression.
