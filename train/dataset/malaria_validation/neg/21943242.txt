BACKGROUND: Reports of severe cases and increasing levels of drug resistance
highlight the importance of improved Plasmodium vivax case management. Whereas
monitoring P. vivax resistance to anti-malarial drug by in vivo and in vitro
tests remain challenging, molecular markers of resistance represent a valuable
tool for high-scale analysis and surveillance studies. A new high-throughput
assay for detecting the most relevant markers related to P. vivax drug resistance
was developed and assessed on Papua New Guinea (PNG) patient isolates.
METHODS: Pvdhfr, pvdhps and pvmdr1 fragments were amplified by multiplex nested
PCR. Then, PCR products were processed through an LDR-FMA (ligase detection
reaction - fluorescent microsphere assay). 23 SNPs, including pvdhfr 57-58-61 and
173, pvdhps 382-383, 553, 647 and pvmdr1 976, were simultaneously screened in 366
PNG P. vivax samples.
RESULTS: Genotyping was successful in 95.4% of the samples for at least one gene.
The coexistence of multiple distinct haplotypes in the parasite population
necessitated the introduction of a computer-assisted approach to data analysis.
Whereas 73.1% of patients were infected with at least one wild-type genotype at
codons 57, 58 and 61 of pvdhfr, a triple mutant genotype was detected in 65.6% of
the patients, often associated with the 117T mutation. Only one patient carried
the 173L mutation. The mutant 647P pvdhps genotype allele was approaching genetic
fixation (99.3%), whereas 35.1% of patients were infected with parasites carrying
the pvmdr1 976F mutant allele.
CONCLUSIONS: The LDR-FMA described here allows a discriminant genotyping of
resistance alleles in the pvdhfr, pvdhps, and pvmdr1 genes and can be used in
large-scale surveillance studies.
