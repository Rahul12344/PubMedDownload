BACKGROUND: Studies in Southeast Asia reported a strong relationship between
polymorphisms at the propeller domain of the Kelch 13 (K13) protein encoded by
the Plasmodium falciparum k13 (pfk13) gene and delayed parasite clearance after
artemisinin treatment. In Africa, P. falciparum remains susceptible and
combination therapy regimens which include an artemisinin component display good 
efficacy. Using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), sub-microscopic persistence of
P. falciparum has previously been reported in one-third of children treated with 
artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) in western Kenya. In this study, further
investigation was made to evaluate whether these sub-microscopic residual
parasites also harbour mutations at the propeller region of pfk13 and whether the
mutations, if any, affect treatment outcome.
METHODS: The pfk13 propeller domain was genotyped in DNA samples obtained in 2009
from Kenyan children treated with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP). Paired samples at pre-treatment (day 0) and 
day of treatment failure (day 28 or 42) for 32 patients with documented recurrent
parasitaemia were available for genotyping. Additional day 3 DNA samples were
available for 10 patients.
RESULTS: No mutation associated with artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia was
observed. Only one DP-treated patient harboured a non-synonymous mutation at
codon 578 (A578S) of pfk13-propeller gene in the day 0 sample, but this allele
was replaced by the wild-type (A578) form on day 3 and on the day of recurrent
parasitaemia. The mutation at amino acid codon 578 showed no association with any
phenotype. Polymorphisms in pfk13 were not responsible for parasite persistence
and gametocyte carriage in the children treated with ACT.
CONCLUSION: This study contributes to the ongoing surveillance of suspected
artemisinin resistance parasites in Africa by providing baseline prevalence of
k13-propeller mutations in western Kenya with samples collected from a
longitudinal study. Clinical Trials Registration NCT00868465.
