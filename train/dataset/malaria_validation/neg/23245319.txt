switching frequency of a Plasmodium falciparum invasion gene.

Variation of surface adhesins, such as the Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte
invasion ligand PfRh4, is critical for virulence and immune evasion in many
microbes. While phenotypic switching is linked to transcriptional changes and
chromatin function, the determinants of switching frequency remain poorly
defined. By expressing a prokaryotic DNA methylase in P. falciparum, we directly 
assayed accessibility of transcriptionally active and silent chromatin at the
PfRh4 locus. Parasites selected for in vivo PfRh4 activation show a reversible
increase in promoter accessibility and exhibit perinuclear repositioning of the
locus from a silent to a conserved activation domain. Forced activation of a
proximal gene results in a similar repositioning of the PfRh4 locus, with a
concomitant increase in PfRh4 activation in a subpopulation of parasites and
promoter accessibility correlating with actively transcribed loci. Thus, nuclear 
repositioning is associated with increased P. falciparum switching frequency,
while promoter accessibility is tightly linked to clonally active PfRh4
promoters.
