We describe the type species of a novel genus of microsporidian parasite,
Pseudokabatana alburnus n. gen. n. sp., infecting the liver of topmouth culter,
Culter alburnus Basilewsky, 1855, from Lake Poyang off Xingzi county, Jiangxi
Province, China. The parasite elicits formation of spherical xenomas of up to
1.2 mm in diameter containing all observed life stages from early merogonal
plasmodia to mature spores contained within the cytoplasm of host hepatocytes.
Merogonal plasmodia existed in direct contact with the host cytoplasm and
contained up to 20 visible nuclei. Plasmotomy of the multinucleate plasmodium led
to formation of uninucleate cells in which the nucleus underwent further division
to form bi-nucleate presporonts, sporonts (defined by cells with a thickened
endospore) and eventually sporoblasts (containing pre-cursors of the spore
extrusion apparatus). Mature spores were pyriform and monokaryotic, measuring
2.3 ± 0.19 μm long and 1.3 ± 0.10 μm wide. Spores possessed a bipartite
polaroplast and 5-6 coils of a polar filament, in a single rank. The obtained
partial SSU rRNA gene sequence, 1383 bp in length, did not match any of
microsporidia available in GenBank. SSU rDNA-based phylogenetic analysis
indicated a new taxon branching with Kabatana rondoni, a parasite infecting the
skeletal muscle of Gymnorhamphichthys rondoni from the Amazon River. Due to
different host and tissue tropism, the novel taxon did not fit the diagnostic
criteria for the genus Kabatana. Further, based on SSU rDNA-inferred phylogenetic
analyses, different ultrastructural features of developmental stages, and
ecological considerations, a new genus Pseudokabatana and type species
Pseudokabatana alburnus n. sp. was erected for the parasite in topmouth culter.
