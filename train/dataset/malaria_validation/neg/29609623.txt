OBJECTIVES: Sickle cell anemia is due to a mutations on the betaglobin gene,
inducing abnormal hemoglobin. In West Africa the main mutations lead to S or C
types of hemoglobin. Patients with homozygote mutations seem protected against
severe malaria, but not against mild disease. The prevalence of abnormal
hemoglobin among patients attending dispensaries for mild malaria is thus
unknown. A retrospective study was conducted to update data on the prevalence of 
S and C hemoglobin among patients attending dispensaries with mild malaria.
Enrolment of patients was conducted during in vivo malaria treatment efficacy
survey following the 42 days WHO protocol. A group of non-infected pregnant women
and a group of patients with fever different from malaria, were also recruited in
the same dispensaries.
RESULTS: 794 blood samples were included. S and C genotypes were found in all the
regions of Ivory Coast with the highest prevalence in the Northern region (S and 
C genotypes, 27%). In non-infected patients, prevalence of mutations was higher
than in malaria patients.
CONCLUSION: A high proportion of patients with mild malaria carried genetic
hemoglobin disorder. This population of high risk must be better investigated to 
control treatment efficacy and to manage complications.
