Documenting isolation is notoriously difficult for species with vast polymorphic 
populations. High proportions of shared variation impede estimation of
connectivity, even despite leveraging information from many genetic markers. We
overcome these impediments by combining classical analysis of neutral variation
with assays of the structure of selected variation, demonstrated using
populations of the principal African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. Accurate
estimation of mosquito migration is crucial for efforts to combat malaria.
Modeling and cage experiments suggest that mosquito gene drive systems will
enable malaria eradication, but establishing safety and efficacy requires
identification of isolated populations in which to conduct field testing. We
assess Lake Victoria islands as candidate sites, finding one island 30 km
offshore is as differentiated from mainland samples as populations from across
the continent. Collectively, our results suggest sufficient contemporary
isolation of these islands to warrant consideration as field-testing locations
and illustrate shared adaptive variation as a useful proxy for connectivity in
highly polymorphic species.
