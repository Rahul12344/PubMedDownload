A large proportion of the death toll associated with malaria is a consequence of 
malaria infection during pregnancy, causing up to 200,000 infant deaths annually.
We previously published the first extensive genetic association study of
placental malaria infection, and here we extend this analysis considerably,
investigating genetic variation in over 9,000 SNPs in more than 1,000 genes
involved in immunity and inflammation for their involvement in susceptibility to 
placental malaria infection. We applied a new approach incorporating results from
both single gene analysis as well as gene-gene interactions on a protein-protein 
interaction network. We found suggestive associations of variants in the gene
KLRK1 in the single gene analysis, as well as evidence for associations of
multiple members of the IL-7/IL-7R signalling cascade in the combined analysis.
To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale genetic study on placental
malaria infection to date, opening the door for follow-up studies trying to
elucidate the genetic basis of this neglected form of malaria.
