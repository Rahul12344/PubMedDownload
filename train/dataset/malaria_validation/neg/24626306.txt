The polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods for the diagnosis of malaria
infection are expected to accurately identify submicroscopic parasite carriers.
Although a significant number of PCR protocols have been described, few studies
have addressed the performance of PCR amplification in cases of field samples
with submicroscopic malaria infection. Here, the reproducibility of two
well-established PCR protocols (nested-PCR and real-time PCR for the Plasmodium
18 small subunit rRNA gene) were evaluated in a panel of 34 blood field samples
from individuals that are potential reservoirs of malaria infection, but were
negative for malaria by optical microscopy. Regardless of the PCR protocol, a
large variation between the PCR replicates was observed, leading to alternating
positive and negative results in 38% (13 out of 34) of the samples. These
findings were quite different from those obtained from the microscopy-positive
patients or the unexposed individuals; the diagnosis of these individuals could
be confirmed based on the high reproducibility and specificity of the PCR-based
protocols. The limitation of PCR amplification was restricted to the field
samples with very low levels of parasitaemia because titrations of the DNA
templates were able to detect < 3 parasites/µL in the blood. In conclusion,
conventional PCR protocols require careful interpretation in cases of
submicroscopic malaria infection, as inconsistent and false-negative results can 
occur.
