BACKGROUND: The genome of Candida albicans displays significant polymorphism.
Point mutations in genes involved in resistance to antifungals may either confer 
phenotypic resistance or be devoid of phenotypic consequences.
OBJECTIVES: To catalogue polymorphisms in azole and echinocandin resistance genes
occurring in susceptible strains in order to rapidly pinpoint relevant mutations 
in resistant strains.
METHODS: Genome sequences from 151 unrelated C. albicans strains susceptible to
fluconazole and caspofungin were used to create a catalogue of non-synonymous
polymorphisms in genes involved in resistance to azoles (ERG11, TAC1, MRR1 and
UPC2) or echinocandins (FKS1). The potential of this catalogue to reveal putative
resistance mutations was tested in 10 azole-resistant isolates, including 1
intermediate to caspofungin. Selected mutations were analysed by mutagenesis
experiments or mutational prediction effect.
RESULTS: In the susceptible strains, we identified 126 amino acid substitutions
constituting the catalogue of phenotypically neutral polymorphisms. By excluding 
these neutral substitutions, we identified 22 additional substitutions in the 10 
resistant strains. Among these substitutions, 10 had already been associated with
resistance. The remaining 12 were in Tac1p (n = 6), Upc2p (n = 2) and Erg11p
(n = 4). Four out of the six homozygous substitutions in Tac1p (H263Y, A790V,
H839Y and P971S) conferred increases in azole MICs, while no effects were
observed for those in Upc2p. Additionally, two homozygous substitutions (Y64H and
P236S) had a predicted conformation effect on Erg11p.
CONCLUSIONS: By establishing a catalogue of neutral polymorphisms occurring in
genes involved in resistance to antifungal drugs, we provide a useful resource
for rapid identification of mutations possibly responsible for phenotypic
resistance in C. albicans.
