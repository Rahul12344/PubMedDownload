In this study, samples from the 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus outbreak from 
patients in Guinea with Ebola virus disease (EVD) were analyzed to discover and
classify what other pathogens were present. Throat swabs were taken from deceased
EVD patients, and peripheral blood samples were analyzed that had been taken from
patients when they presented at the treatment center with acute illness.
High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and bioinformatics were used to identify
the potential microorganisms. This approach confirmed Ebola virus (EBOV) in all
samples from patients diagnosed as acute positive for the virus by quantitative
reverse transcription-PCR in deployed field laboratories. Nucleic acid mapping to
Plasmodium was also used on the patient samples, confirming results obtained with
an antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (RDT) conducted in the field laboratories.
The data suggested that a high Plasmodium load, as determined by sequence read
depth, was associated with mortality and influenced the host response, whereas a 
lower parasite load did not appear to affect outcome. The identifications of
selected bacteria from throat swabs via RNA-seq were confirmed by culture. The
data indicated that the potential pathogens identified in the blood samples were 
associated with translocation from the gut, suggesting the presence of
bacteremia, which transcriptome data suggested may induce or aggravate the
acute-phase response observed during EVD. Transcripts mapping to different
viruses were also identified, including those indicative of lytic infections. The
development of high-resolution analysis of samples from patients with EVD will
help inform care pathways and the most appropriate general antimicrobial therapy 
to be used in a resource-poor setting. IMPORTANCE Our results highlight the
identification of an array of pathogens in the blood of patients with Ebola virus
disease (EVD). This has not been done before, and the data have important
implications for the treatment of patients with EVD, particularly considering
antibiotic stewardship. We show that EVD patients who were also infected with
Plasmodium, particularly at higher loads, had more adverse outcomes than patients
with lower levels of Plasmodium. However, the presence of Plasmodium did not
influence the innate immune response, and it is likely that the presence of EBOV 
dominated this response. Several viruses other than EBOV were identified, and
bacteria associated with sepsis were also identified. These findings were
indicative of bacterial translocation across the gut during the acute phase of
EVD.
