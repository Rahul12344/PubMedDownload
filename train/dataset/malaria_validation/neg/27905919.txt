BACKGROUND: The widespread emergence of resistance to pyrethroids is a major
threat to the gains made in malaria control. To monitor the presence and possible
emergence of resistance against a variety of insecticides used for malaria
control in Rwanda, nationwide insecticide resistance surveys were conducted in
2011 and 2013.
METHODS: Larvae of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato mosquitoes were collected in 12
sentinel sites throughout Rwanda. These were reared to adults and analysed for
knock-down and mortality using WHO insecticide test papers with standard
diagnostic doses of the recommended insecticides. A sub-sample of tested
specimens was analysed for the presence of knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations.
RESULTS: A total of 14,311 mosquitoes were tested and from a sample of 1406
specimens, 1165 (82.9%) were identified as Anopheles arabiensis and 241 (17.1%)
as Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto. Mortality results indicated a significant
increase in resistance to lambda-cyhalothrin from 2011 to 2013 in 83% of the
sites, permethrin in 25% of the sites, deltamethrin in 25% of the sites and DDT
in 50% of the sites. Mosquitoes from 83% of the sites showed full susceptibility 
to bendiocarb and 17% of sites were suspected to harbour resistance that requires
further confirmation. No resistance was observed to fenitrothion in all study
sites during the entire survey. The kdr genotype results in An. gambiae s.s.
showed that 67 (50%) possessed susceptibility (SS) alleles, while 35 (26.1%) and 
32 (23.9%) mosquitoes had heterozygous (RS) and homozygous (RR) alleles,
respectively. Of the 591 An. arabiensis genotyped, 425 (71.9%) possessed
homozygous (SS) alleles while 158 (26.7%) and 8 (1.4%) had heterozygous (RS) and 
homozygous (RR) alleles, respectively. Metabolic resistance involving oxidase
enzymes was also detected using the synergist PBO.
CONCLUSION: This is the first nationwide study of insecticide resistance in
malaria vectors in Rwanda. It shows the gradual increase of insecticide
resistance to pyrethroids (lambda-cyhalothrin, deltamethrin, permethrin) and
organochlorines (DDT) and the large presence of target site insensitivity. The
results demonstrate the need for Rwanda to expand monitoring for insecticide
resistance including further metabolic resistance testing and implement an
insecticide resistance management strategy to sustain the gains made in malaria
control.
