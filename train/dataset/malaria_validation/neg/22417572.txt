BACKGROUND: A major concern in malaria vaccine development is genetic
polymorphisms typically observed among Plasmodium isolates in different
geographical areas across the world. Highly polymorphic regions have been
observed in Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax antigenic surface proteins
such as Circumsporozoite protein (CSP), Duffy-binding protein (DBP), Merozoite
surface protein-1 (MSP-1), Apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) and Thrombospondin
related anonymous protein (TRAP).
METHODS: Genetic variability was assessed in important polymorphic regions of
various vaccine candidate antigens in P. vivax among 106 isolates from the Amazon
Region of Loreto, Peru. In addition, genetic diversity determined in Peruvian
isolates was compared to population studies from various geographical locations
worldwide.
RESULTS: The structured diversity found in P. vivax populations did not show a
geographic pattern and haplotypes from all gene candidates were distributed
worldwide. In addition, evidence of balancing selection was found in polymorphic 
regions of the trap, dbp and ama-1 genes.
CONCLUSIONS: It is important to have a good representation of the haplotypes
circulating worldwide when implementing a vaccine, regardless of the geographic
region of deployment since selective pressure plays an important role in
structuring antigen diversity.
