CRISPR-Cas9-modified pfmdr1 protects Plasmodium falciparum asexual blood stages
and gametocytes against a class of piperazine-containing compounds but
potentiates artemisinin-based combination therapy partner drugs.

Emerging resistance to first-line antimalarial combination therapies threatens
malaria treatment and the global elimination campaign. Improved therapeutic
strategies are required to protect existing drugs and enhance treatment efficacy.
We report that the piperazine-containing compound ACT-451840 exhibits
single-digit nanomolar inhibition of the Plasmodium falciparum asexual blood
stages and transmissible gametocyte forms. Genome sequence analyses of in
vitro-derived ACT-451840-resistant parasites revealed single nucleotide
polymorphisms in pfmdr1, which encodes a digestive vacuole membrane-bound
ATP-binding cassette transporter known to alter P. falciparum susceptibility to
multiple first-line antimalarials. CRISPR-Cas9 based gene editing confirmed that 
PfMDR1 point mutations mediated ACT-451840 resistance. Resistant parasites
demonstrated increased susceptibility to the clinical drugs lumefantrine,
mefloquine, quinine and amodiaquine. Stage V gametocytes harboring
Cas9-introduced pfmdr1 mutations also acquired ACT-451840 resistance. These
findings reveal that PfMDR1 mutations can impart resistance to compounds active
against asexual blood stages and mature gametocytes. Exploiting PfMDR1 resistance
mechanisms provides new opportunities for developing disease-relieving and
transmission-blocking antimalarials.
