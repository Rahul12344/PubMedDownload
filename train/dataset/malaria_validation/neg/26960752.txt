BACKGROUND: About 100 million passengers enter China via Shenzhen ports every
year and such huge populations increase the risk of various infectious diseases, 
particularly mosquito-borne diseases, entering China. This paper reports the
testing and monitoring of mosquito-borne diseases in febrile travelers through
Shenzhen ports in 2013.
METHODS: The blood samples of 619 febrile cases were collected and the serum of
each sample was used for the specific gene amplification and IgM antibody
detection of five typical mosquito-borne pathogens: Dengue virus (DENV), Japanese
encephalitis virus (JEV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), yellow fever virus (YFV),
and West Nile Virus (WNV). Additionally, malaria was diagnosed by rapid
diagnostic tests (RDTs).
RESULTS: In total, 34 cases were detected of DENV infection (serotype I to IV),
17 cases of JEV infection, 2 cases of CHIKV infection, and 3 cases of malaria
infection. No virus genes or IgM antibodies of YFV or WNV were detected in the
samples. DENV, JEV and CHIKV cases were mainly from Southeast Asia, while malaria
cases from Africa.
CONCLUSIONS: DENV, JEV and CHIKV were the primary pathogens imported via Shenzhen
ports. International travelers with mosquito-borne infections would accelerate
the spread of these diseases, thus reinforcing the need for surveillance of
mosquito-borne infections at ports should become a high priority.
