BACKGROUND: The doublesex gene controls somatic sexual differentiation of many
metazoan species, including the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae and the dengue
and yellow fever vector Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae). As in other studied
dipteran dsx homologs, the gene maintains functionality via evolutionarily
conserved protein domains and sex-specific alternative splicing. The upstream
factors that regulate splicing of dsx and the manner in which they do so however 
remain variable even among closely related organisms. As the induction of sex
ratio biases is a central mode of action in many emerging molecular insecticides,
it is imperative to elucidate as much of the sex determination pathway as
possible in the mosquito disease vectors.
RESULTS: Here we report the full-length gene sequence of the doublesex gene in
Culex quinquefasciatus (Cxqdsx) and its male and female-specific isoforms. Cxqdsx
maintains characteristics possibly derived in the Culicinae and present in the
Aedes aegypti dsx gene (Aeadsx) such as gain of exon 3b and the presence of Rbp1 
cis-regulatory binding sites, and also retains presumably ancestral attributes
present in Anopheles gambiae such as maintenance of a singular female-specific
exon 5. Unlike in Aedes aegypti, we find no evidence for intron gain in the
female transcript(s), yet recover a second female isoform generated via selection
of an alternate splice donor. Utilizing next-gen sequence (NGS) data, we complete
the Aeadsx gene model and identify a putative core promoter region in both Aeadsx
and Cxqdsx. Also utilizing NGS data, we construct a full-length gene sequence for
the dsx homolog of the northern house mosquito Culex pipiens form pipiens
(Cxpipdsx). Analysis of peptide evolutionary rates between Cxqdsx and Cxpipdsx
(both members of the Culex pipiens complex) shows the male-specific portion of
the transcript to have evolved rapidly with respect to female-specific and common
regions.
CONCLUSIONS: As in other studied insects, doublesex maintains sex-specific
splicing and conserved doublesex/mab-3 domains in the mosquitoes Culex
quinquefasciatus and Cx. pipiens. The cis-regulated splicing of Cxqdsx does not
appear to follow either currently described mosquito model (for An. gambiae and
Ae. aegypti); each of the three mosquito genera exhibit evidence of unique
cis-regulatory mechanisms. The male-specific dsx terminus exhibits rapid peptide 
evolutionary rates, even among closely related sibling species.
