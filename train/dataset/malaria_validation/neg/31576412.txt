KEY MESSAGE: Blue and yellow light affected metabolism and the morphology. Blue
and red promote the DOXP/MEP pathway. ADS gene expression was increased in plants
cultivated under blue, promoting artemisinin content. Artemisinin-based
combination therapies are the most effective treatment for highly lethal malaria.
Artemisinin is produced in small quantities in the glandular trichomes of
Artemisia annua L. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of light quality in A.
annua cultivated in vitro under different light qualities, considering anatomical
and morphological changes, the volatile composition, artemisinin content and the 
expression of two key enzymes for artemisinin biosynthesis. Yellow light is
related to the increase in the number of glandular trichomes and this seemed to
positively affect the molecular diversity in A. annua. Yellow light-stimulated
glandular trichome frequency without triggered area enhancement, whereas blue
light stimulated both parameters. Blue light enhanced the thickness of the leaf
epidermis. The B-promoting effect was due to increased cell size and not to
increased cell numbers. Green and yellow light positively influenced the volatile
diversity in the plantlets. Nevertheless, blue and red light seemed to promote
the DOXP/MEP pathway, while red light stimulates MVA pathway. Amorpha-4,11-diene 
synthase gene expression was significantly increased in plants cultivated under
blue light, and not red light, promoting artemisinin content. Our results showed 
that light quality, more specifically blue and yellow light, positively affected 
secondary metabolism and the morphology of plantlets. It seemed that steps prior 
to the last one in the artemisinin biosynthesis pathway could be strongly
influenced by blue light. Our work provides an alternative method to increase the
amount of artemisinin production in A. annua without the use of transgenic
plants, by the employment of blue light.
