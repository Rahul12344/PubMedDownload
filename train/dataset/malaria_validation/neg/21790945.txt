Male gametogenesis occurs directly after uptake of malaria parasites by the
mosquito vector and leads to the release of eight nucleated flagellar gametes.
Here, we report that one of the two parasite actin isoforms, named actin II, is
essential for this process. Disruption of actin II in Plasmodium berghei resulted
in viable asexual blood stages, but male gametogenesis was specifically
inhibited. Upon activation, male gametocyte DNA was replicated normally and
axonemes assembled, but egress from the host cell was inhibited, and axoneme
motility abolished. The major actin isoform, actin I, displayed dual localization
to the cytoplasm and the nucleus in male gametocytes. After activation actin I
was found to be restricted to the cytoplasm. In actII(-) mutant parasites, this
re-localization was abolished and actin I remained in both cellular compartments.
These findings reveal vital and pleiotropic functions for the actin II isoform in
male gametogenesis of the malaria parasite.
