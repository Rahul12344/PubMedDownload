Structure-activity relationship studies involving N-aryl-3-trifluoromethyl
pyrido[1,2- a]benzimidazoles (PBI) identified several compounds possessing potent
in vitro activities against the asexual blood, liver, and gametocyte stages of
the Plasmodium parasite with no cross-resistance to chloroquine. Frontrunner lead
compounds with good in vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion 
(ADME) profiles were subjected to in vivo proof-of-concept studies in NMRI mice
harboring the rodent P. berghei infection. This led to the identification of
compounds 10 and 49, effecting 98% and 99.93% reduction in parasitemia with mean 
survival days of 12 and 14, respectively, at an oral dose of 4 × 50 mg/kg. In
vivo pharmacokinetics studies on 10 revealed slow absorption, low volume of
distribution, and low clearance profiles. Furthermore, this series displayed a
low propensity to inhibit the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium
ion channel whose inhibition is associated with cardiotoxicity.
