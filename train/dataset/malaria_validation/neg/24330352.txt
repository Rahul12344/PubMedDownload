BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax re-emerged in 1993. Although the number of
infections has been steadily decreasing, it is likely to continue to affect
public health until it is eradicated. The aim of this study is to measure
anti-circumsporozoite protein (CSP) antibody and compare malaria prevalence. As
to understand the prevalence, an epidemiology study has to be conducted in the
Republic of Korea.
METHODS: A total of 1,825 and 1,959 blood samples were collected in 2010 and
2011, respectively, from the inhabitants of Ganghwa and Cheorwon counties. The
antibody titers of the inhabitants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) using recombinant protein purified from Escherichia coli
transformed with a CSP gene-inserted pET-28a(+) expression vector. Microscopic
examination was performed to identify malaria parasites.
RESULTS: The annual parasite incidence (API) in Ganghwa decreased from 4.28 in
2010 to 2.23 in 2011, and that in Cheorwon decreased from 1.88 in 2010 to 1.15 in
2011. The antibody-positive CSP rate in these areas also decreased from 18.14%
(331/1825) in 2010 to 15.36% (301/1959) in 2011. Pearson analysis showed a strong
correlation between the API and the antibody-positive CSP rate in these areas
(r = 1.000, P < 0.01). The intensity of the immune responses of the inhabitants
of Cheorwon, as measured by the mean optical density, decreased from
0.9186 ± 0.0472 in 2010 to 0.7035 ± 0.0457 in 2011 (P = 0.034), but increased in 
Ganghwa from 0.7649 ± 0.0192 in 2010 to 0.8237 ± 0.1970 in 2011 (P = 0.006). The 
immune response increased according to age (r = 0.686, P = 0.041).
CONCLUSIONS: The positive CSP-ELISA rate was closely related to the API in the
study areas. This suggests that seroepidemiological studies based on CSP-ELISA
may be helpful in estimating the malaria prevalence. Moreover, such studies can
be used to establish and evaluate malaria control and eradication programmes in
high-risk areas in Korea.
