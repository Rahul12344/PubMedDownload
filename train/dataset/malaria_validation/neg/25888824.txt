BACKGROUND: Anopheles sinensis has become an important malaria vector in China.
The long-term extensive utilization of pyrethroids for ITNs and IRS for mosquito 
control in the last three decades has resulted in the occurrence of resistant An.
sinensis populations in many regions. Knockdown resistance (kdr), caused by point
mutations in the VGSC gene, is one of the mechanisms that confer resistance to
DDT and pyrethroids. Recently, several investigations revealed the kdr occurrence
in some An. sinensis populations, however, no kdr data were available earlier
than 2009. A survey tracking the dynamics of the kdr mutations in past decades
would provide invaluable information to understand how the kdr alleles spread in 
mosquito populations temporally and spatially.
METHODS: A survey was conducted on the kdr alleles at condon 1014 of the VGSC
gene and their distributions in 733 specimens of An. sinensis and 232 specimens
of the other eight member species of the Anopheles hyrcanus group that were
collected from 17 provinces in China in 1996-2014.
RESULTS: A total of three kdr alleles, TTT (F), TTG (F) and TGT (C) were
detected, and TGT (C) and TTT (F) were already present in the specimens from
Jiangsu and Shandong as early as 1997. The TTT (F) was the most frequent mutant
allele, and largely distributed in central China, namely Shandong, Jiangsu,
Anhui, Henan, Shanghai, Jiangxi and Hubei. When data were analysed in three time 
intervals, 1996-2001, 2005-2009, 2010-2014, the prevalence of kdr alleles
increased progressively over time in the populations in central China. In
contrast, the kdr alleles were less frequent in the samples from other regions,
especially in Yunnan and Hainan, despite the documented presence of pyrethroid
resistant populations in those regions. Interestingly, no mutant alleles were
detected in all 232 specimens of eight other species in the An. hyrcanus group.
CONCLUSION: The survey revealed that the kdr occurrence and accumulation in the
An. sinensis populations were more frequent in central China than in the other
regions, suggesting that the kdr mutations may contribute significantly to the
pyrethroid resistance in the mosquitoes in central China.
