Anopheles maculipennis complex comprises some important malaria vectors in Iran, 
Middle East, and Europ. The principal way to control of malaria remains on the
use of chemical insecticides against its vectors because there is no vaccine for 
malaria prevention. Extensive use of organophosphate compounds has caused to
emergence and distribution of insecticide resistance in Anopheles species in
Asia. The current study aimed to the detection of three well-known amino acid
substitutions (I114T, L119F, and F120L) in the Glutathione S-Transferases epsilon
2 (GSTe2) gene are associated with DDT and organophosphate insecticides
resistance in an Anopheles maculipennis population collected from Iran. Adult
samples of An. maculipennis were collected by hand and Total catch in Animal and 
Human Shelters from Azerbaijan-Gharbi and Zanjan provinces. Following
morphological identification, DNA was extracted by YTA Genomic DNA Extraction
Mini Kit for amplification of rDNA-ITS2 and GSTe2 fragments. âˆ¼500 bp fragment was
amplified using F rDNA-ITS2 and GSTe2 primers. rDNA-ITS2 sequence analysis showed
100% similarity with An. maculipennis. GSTe2 nucleotide sequence similarity
within species was 99-100%, while, it was 95-96 % when compared with Anopheles
sacharovi GSTe2 sequences available in GenBank. Amino acid sequence comparisons
showed a novel amino acid substitution in N148D position with 15.79% frequency.
The current study reports new GSTe2 amino acid substitution in An. maculipennis
s.s., for the first time. The function of the mutation N148D and its association 
with resistance phenotype need to validate. However, the integration of these
data into the malaria control program still remains a challenge.
