The unicellular protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium impose on human
health worldwide the enormous burden of malaria. The possibility to genetically
modify several species of malaria parasites represented a major advance in the
possibility to elucidate their biology and is now turning laboratory lines of
transgenic Plasmodium into precious weapons to fight malaria. Amongst the various
genetically modified plasmodia, transgenic parasite lines expressing
bioluminescent reporters have been essential to unveil mechanisms of parasite
gene expression and to develop in vivo imaging approaches in mouse malaria
models. Mainly the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and the rodent
parasite P. berghei have been engineered to express bioluminescent reporters in
almost all the developmental stages of the parasite along its complex life cycle 
between the insect and the vertebrate hosts. Plasmodium lines expressing
conventional and improved luciferase reporters are now gaining a central role to 
develop cell based assays in the much needed search of new antimalarial drugs and
to open innovative approaches for both fundamental and applied research in
malaria.
