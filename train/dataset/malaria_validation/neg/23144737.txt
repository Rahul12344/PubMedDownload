Type I interferons (T1IFNs) are among the earliest cytokines produced during
infections due to their direct regulation by innate immune signaling pathways.
Reports have suggested that T1IFNs are produced during malaria infection, but
little is known about the in vivo cellular origins of T1IFNs or their role in
protection. We have found that in addition to plasmacytoid dendritic cells,
splenic red pulp macrophages (RPMs) can generate significant quantities of T1IFNs
in response to P. chabaudi infection in a TLR9-, MYD88-, and IRF7-dependent
manner. Furthermore, T1IFNs regulate expression of interferon-stimulated genes
redundantly with Interferon-gamma (IFNG), resulting in redundancy for resistance 
to experimental malaria infection. Despite their role in sensing and promoting
immune responses to infection, we observe that RPMs are dispensable for control
of parasitemia. Our results reveal that RPMs are early sentinels of malaria
infection, but that effector mechanisms previously attributed to RPMs are not
essential for control.
