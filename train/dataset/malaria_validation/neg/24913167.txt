Artemisinin (ART)-based combination therapy (ACT) is used as the first-line
treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria worldwide. However, despite high
potency and rapid action, there is a high rate of recrudescence associated with
ART monotherapy or ACT long before the recent emergence of ART resistance.
ART-induced ring-stage dormancy and recovery have been implicated as possible
causes of recrudescence; however, little is known about the characteristics of
dormant parasites, including whether dormant parasites are metabolically active. 
We investigated the transcription of 12 genes encoding key enzymes in various
metabolic pathways in P. falciparum during dihydroartemisinin (DHA)-induced
dormancy and recovery. Transcription analysis showed an immediate downregulation 
for 10 genes following exposure to DHA but continued transcription of 2 genes
encoding apicoplast and mitochondrial proteins. Transcription of several
additional genes encoding apicoplast and mitochondrial proteins, particularly of 
genes encoding enzymes in pyruvate metabolism and fatty acid synthesis pathways, 
was also maintained. Additions of inhibitors for biotin acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA)
carboxylase and enoyl-acyl carrier reductase of the fatty acid synthesis pathways
delayed the recovery of dormant parasites by 6 and 4 days, respectively,
following DHA treatment. Our results demonstrate that most metabolic pathways are
downregulated in DHA-induced dormant parasites. In contrast, fatty acid and
pyruvate metabolic pathways remain active. These findings highlight new targets
to interrupt recovery of parasites from ART-induced dormancy and to reduce the
rate of recrudescence following ART treatment.
