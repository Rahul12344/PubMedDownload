OBJECTIVE: Despite malaria epidemiology has been extensively studied in primates,
few studies were conducted in ungulates. After half a century without
descriptions of Plasmodium spp. in deer since its first identification, recent
research has rediscovered Plasmodium on ungulates in Africa, Asia, North America 
and South America, including Central Brazil. Here, a captive herd was evaluated
in southern Brazil using light microscopy and PCR. DNA samples were tested for
fragment amplification of two Plasmodium spp. genes: mitochondrial cytochrome b
and small subunit ribosomal RNA.
RESULTS: All analyses were negative. However, the tests were performed on samples
that were collected at a single time point, and parasitemia may fluctuate over
the parasite's life cycle. Thus, the possibility of occult infection cannot be
ruled out. Despite the negative results of all of the methods applied, it cannot 
be categorically stated that these animals are free from Plasmodium sp.
infection. Further monitoring and/or multiple sequential sampling may improve the
success rate of detecting parasites. Moreover, although this survey of Plasmodium
represents the first molecular study on ungulate malaria parasites from Southern 
Brazil, further analysis of samples from different ungulate species is important 
for characterizing the epidemiology of Plasmodium of these mammals in this
region.
