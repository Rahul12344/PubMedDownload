Six new lipodepsipeptides and an additional linear derivative named taxlllaids
A-G (1-7) have been identified in the entomopathogenic bacterium Xenorhabdus
indica. The structures of the main compounds have been solved by detailed NMR
spectroscopic analysis and the structures of minor derivatives were elucidated by
a combination of labelling experiments and detailed MS experiments. The absolute 
configuration of the taxlllaids was deduced by using the advanced Marfey method
and analysis of the biosynthesis gene cluster showing the presence of
epimerisation domains, which was subsequently proved to be correct by solid-phase
peptide synthesis of all taxlllaids. The exchange of a single amino acid in the
adenylation domain was shown to be responsible for substrate promiscuity of the
third A domain, resulting in the incorporation of leucine, phenylalanine or
tyrosine. Bioactivity testing revealed the taxlllaids to be weakly active against
Plasmodium falciparum and against a number of eukaryotic cell lines.
