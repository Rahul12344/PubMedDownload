Plasmodium vivax is a major cause of malaria morbidity worldwide yet has remained
genetically intractable. To stably modify this organism, we used zinc-finger
nucleases (ZFNs), which take advantage of homology-directed DNA repair mechanisms
at the site of nuclease action. Using ZFNs specific to the gene encoding P. vivax
dihydrofolate reductase (pvdhfr), we transfected blood specimens from Saimiri
boliviensis monkeys infected with the pyrimethamine (Pyr)-susceptible Chesson
strain with a ZFN plasmid carrying a Pyr-resistant mutant pvdhfr sequence. We
obtained Pyr-resistant parasites in vivo that carried mutant pvdhfr and
additional silent mutations designed to confirm editing. These results herald the
era of stable P. vivax genetic modifications.
