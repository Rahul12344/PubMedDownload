Malaria parasites proliferate by repeated invasion of and multiplication within
erythrocytes in the vertebrate host. Sexually committed intraerythrocytic
parasites undergo sexual stage differentiation to become gametocytes. After
ingestion by the mosquito, male and female gametocytes egress from erythrocytes
and fertilize within the mosquito midgut. A complex signaling pathway likely
responds to environmental events to trigger gametogenesis and regulate
fertilization; however, such knowledge remains limited for malaria parasites.
Several pseudokinases are highly transcribed at the gametocyte stage and are
possible multi-functional regulators controlling critical steps of the life
cycle. Here we characterized one pseudokinase, termed PypPK1, in Plasmodium
yoelii that is highly expressed in schizonts and male gametocytes.
Immunofluorescence assays for parasites expressing Myc-tagged PypPK1 confirmed
that PypPK1 protein is expressed in schizonts and sexual stage parasites.
Transgenic ΔpPK1 parasites, in which the PypPK1 gene locus was deleted by the
CRISPR/Cas9 method, showed significant growth defect and reduced virulence in
mice. In the blood stage, ΔpPK1 parasites were able to egress from erythrocytes
similar to wild type parasites; however, erythrocyte invasion efficacy was
significantly reduced. During sexual stage development, no clear changes were
seen in male and female gametocytemias as well as gametocyte egress from
erythrocytes; but, the number of exflagellation centers and oocysts were
significantly reduced in ΔpPK1 parasites. Taken together, PypPK1 has an important
role for both erythrocyte invasion and exflagellation center formation.
