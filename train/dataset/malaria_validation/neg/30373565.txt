BACKGROUND: In the Republic of Congo, artemisinin-based combinations have been
recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria since 2006. However, the
emergence of resistant parasites again these combinations in Southeast Asia is a 
threat for the control of this disease, especially in sub-Saharan Africa where
the weight of the disease is important. Indeed, polymorphisms in Plasmodium
falciparum K13-propeller gene have been involved in variations of drug
sensitivity of Plasmodium falciparum to artemisinin-based combinations. The aim
of the current study is to determine the prevalence of mutations of this gene in 
isolates collected in three health centers in Brazzaville.
METHODS: From May 2015 to May 2016, a total of 131, 259 and 416 samples from
patients with suspected malaria were collected at the Laboratoire National de
Santé Publique, Hôpital de Mfilou, and the CSI «Maman Mboualé» respectively.
After DNA isolation, genotyping and sequencing of Plasmodium falciparum
K13-propeller were performed in positive Plasmodium falciparum isolates
identified after msp-2 gene genotyping.
RESULTS: All 806 samples collected were msp-2 genotyped and Plasmodium falciparum
infections were confirmed in 287 samples with 43, 85, 159 samples from
Laboratoire National de Santé Publique, Hôpital de Mfilou, and the CSI «Maman
Mboualé» respectively. Of these 287 msp-2 positives samples, K13-propeller nested
PCR products were successfully obtained from 145 (50.52%) isolates and sequences 
were generated from 127(87.58%) nested products. None of mutations that were
associated with ACTs resistance in Southeast Asia were detected on the samples
from three different study sites from Brazzaville. However, one mutation type was
observed at position 578, where alanine was substituted by serine (A578S) in two 
isolates (1.57%, 2/127), those from the Hôpital de Mfilou. No mutation was found 
in isolates from the two other sites.
CONCLUSION: The current study shows a very limited polymorphism in the
K13-propeller gene in isolates from the Republic of Congo and K13 polymorphisms
associate with ACT resistance are not present in this country. However, permanent
and large surveillance of resistant parasite population using K13-propeller gene 
is recommended.
