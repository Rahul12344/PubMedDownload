The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a large macromolecular assembly of around 30
different proteins, so-called nucleoporins (Nups). Embedded in the nuclear
envelope the NPC mediates bi-directional exchange between the cytoplasm and the
nucleus and plays a role in transcriptional regulation that is poorly understood.
NPCs display modular arrangements with an overall structure that is generally
conserved among many eukaryotic phyla. However, Nups of yeast or human origin
show little primary sequence conservation with those from early-branching
protozoans leaving those of the malaria parasite unrecognized. Here we have
combined bioinformatic and genetic methods to identify and spatially characterize
Nup components in the rodent infecting parasite Plasmodium berghei and identified
orthologs from the human malaria parasite P. falciparum, as well as the related
apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. For the first time we show the
localization of selected Nups throughout the P. berghei life cycle. Largely
restricted to apicomplexans we identify an extended C-terminal poly-proline
extension in SEC13 that is essential for parasite survival and provide
high-resolution images of Plasmodium NPCs obtained by cryo electron tomography.
Our data provide the basis for full characterization of NPCs in malaria
parasites, early branching unicellular eukaryotes with significant impact on
human health.
