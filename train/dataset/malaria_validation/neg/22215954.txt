Complement receptor 1 (CR1) gene polymorphisms that are associated with Knops
blood group antigens may influence the binding of Plasmodium parasites to
erythrocytes, thereby affecting susceptibility to malaria. The aim of this study 
was to evaluate the genotype and allele and haplotype frequencies of
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Knops blood group antigens and examine 
their association with susceptibility to malaria in an endemic area of Brazil.
One hundred and twenty-six individuals from the Brazilian Amazon were studied.
The CR1-genomic fragment was amplified by PCR and six SNPs and haplotypes were
identified after DNA sequence analysis. Allele and haplotype frequencies revealed
that the Kn(b) allele and H8 haplotype were possibly associated with
susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum. The odds ratios were reasonably high,
suggesting a potentially important association between two Knops blood antigens
(Kn(b) and KAM(+)) that confer susceptibility to P. falciparum in individuals
from the Brazilian Amazon.
