BACKGROUND: Chloroquine, a lysosomal inhibitor, is used for malaria, rheumatoid
arthritis, and lupus erythematosus therapy. In our previous study, FIP-gts, an
immunomodulatory protein from Ganoderma tsugae, inhibited cell viability in lung 
cancer cells and urothelial cancer cells. Urothelial carcinoma is the most common
type of bladder cancer. Cisplatin resistance is an important issue in urothelial 
carcinoma therapy.
PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of combination
treatment with FIP-gts and chloroquine on cytotoxicity to resensitize the
cisplatin-resistant cells.
METHODS: FIP-gts and chloroquine cytotoxicity were determined by evaluating CCK-8
assay. Cell death pathways, ROS and cell cycle arrested were analysed through
flow cytometry and Western blot. ShRNA targeting to autophagy-related genes were 
tested to evaluate their autophagic cell death for resistant urothelial cells.
RESULTS: Using CCK-8 assay, chloroquine increased FIP-gts-induced cytotoxicity in
parental and cisplatin-resistant urothelial cancer cell lines. On flow cytometry,
chloroquine enhanced FIP-gts-mediated sub-G1 accumulation, annexin V positive
signal and mitochondrial membrane potential loss. Caspase-3/PARP cascade and
z-VAD-fmk were performed to prove that FIP-gts and chloroquine induced
caspase-independent cell death. Using H2DCFDA staining and flow cytometry,
FIP-gts and chloroquine did not induce ROS production. N-acetyl cysteine, a ROS
scavenger, inhibited the cytotoxicity and LC3-II accumulation in FIP-gts and
chloroquine-treated N/P cells. To elucidate the role of autophagy in
caspase-independent cell death by FIP-gts and chloroquine, LC3 shRNA were used to
inhibit autophagy in N/P cells. The capabilities of FIP-gts and chloroquine to
induce cytotoxicity and sub-G1 phase accumulation were abolished in
autophagy-defective cells. This is the first study to reveal the novel function
of FIP-gts in triggering caspase-independent cell death in cisplatin-resistant
urothelial cancer cells.
CONCLUSION: Chloroquine enhanced FIP-gts-induced autophagy dependent
caspase-independent cell death via abundant autophagosome accumulation.
Combination treatment with FIP-gts and chloroquine may provide a new strategy for
urothelial cancer therapy.
