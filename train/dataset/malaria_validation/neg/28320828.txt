Organisms with identical genome sequences can show substantial differences in
their phenotypes owing to epigenetic changes that result in different use of
their genes. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression plays a key role in the
control of several fundamental processes in the biology of malaria parasites,
including antigenic variation and sexual differentiation. Some of the histone
modifications and chromatin-modifying enzymes that control the epigenetic states 
of malaria genes have been characterized, and their functions are beginning to be
unraveled. The fundamental principles of epigenetic regulation of gene expression
appear to be conserved between malaria parasites and model eukaryotes, but
important peculiarities exist. Here, we review the current knowledge of malaria
epigenetics and discuss how it can be exploited for the development of new
molecular markers and new types of drugs that may contribute to malaria
eradication efforts.
