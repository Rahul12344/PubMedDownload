BACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease and is
fatal if untreated. There is no vaccine available against leishmaniasis. The
majority of patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) or VL develop a long-term 
protective immunity after cure from infection, which indicates that development
of an effective vaccine against leishmaniasis is possible. Such protection may
also be achieved by immunization with live attenuated parasites that do not cause
disease. We have previously reported a protective response in mice, hamsters and 
dogs with Leishmania donovani centrin gene knock-out parasites (LdCen-/-), a live
attenuated parasite with a cell division specific centrin1 gene deletion. In this
study we have explored the effects of salivary protein LJM19 as an adjuvant and
intradermal (ID) route of immunization on the efficacy of LdCen-/- parasites as a
vaccine against virulent L. donovani.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To explore the potential of a combination of
LdCen-/- parasites and salivary protein LJM19 as vaccine antigens, LdCen-/- ID
immunization followed by ID challenge with virulent L. donovani were performed in
hamsters in a 9-month follow up study. We determined parasite burden (serial
dilution), antibody production (ELISA) and cytokine expression (qPCR) in these
animals. Compared to controls, animals immunized with LdCen-/- + LJM19 induced a 
strong antibody response, a reduction in spleen and liver parasite burden and a
higher expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines after immunization and one month 
post-challenge. Additionally, a low parasite load in lymph nodes, spleen and
liver, and a non-inflamed spleen was observed in immunized animals 9 months after
the challenge infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that an ID vaccination using
LdCen-/-parasites in combination with sand fly salivary protein LJM19 has the
capability to confer long lasting protection against visceral leishmaniasis that 
is comparable to intravenous or intracardial immunization.
