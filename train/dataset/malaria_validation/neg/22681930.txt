BACKGROUND: DNA microarrays have been a valuable tool in malaria research for
over a decade but remain in limited use in part due their relatively high cost,
poor availability, and technical difficulty. With the aim of alleviating some of 
these factors next-generation DNA microarrays for genome-wide transcriptome
analysis for both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium berghei using the Agilent 
8 x 15 K platform were designed.
METHODS: Probe design was adapted from previously published methods and based on 
the most current transcript predictions available at the time for P. falciparum
or P. berghei. Array performance and transcriptome analysis was determined using 
dye-coupled, aminoallyl-labelled cDNA and streamlined methods for hybridization, 
washing, and array analysis were developed.
RESULTS: The new array design marks a notable improvement in the number of
transcripts covered and average number of probes per transcript. Array
performance was excellent across a wide range of transcript abundance, with low
inter-array and inter-probe variability for relative abundance measurements and
it recapitulated previously observed transcriptional patterns. Additionally,
improvements in sensitivity permitted a 20-fold reduction in necessary starting
RNA amounts, further reducing experimental costs and widening the range of
application.
CONCLUSIONS: DNA microarrays utilizing the Agilent 8 x 15 K platform for
genome-wide transcript analysis in P. falciparum and P. berghei mark an
improvement in coverage and sensitivity, increased availability to the research
community, and simplification of the experimental methods.
