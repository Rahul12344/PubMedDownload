Pathogens have to balance transmission with persistence. For Plasmodium
falciparum, the most widespread and virulent malaria parasite, persistence within
its human host requires continuous asexual replication within red blood cells,
while its mosquito-borne transmission depends on intra-erythrocytic
differentiation into non-replicating sexual stages called gametocytes. Commitment
to either fate is determined during the preceding cell cycle that begins with
invasion by a single, asexually committed merozoite and ends, 48 hours later,
with a schizont releasing newly formed merozoites, all committed to either
continued asexual replication or differentiation into gametocytes. Sexual
commitment requires the transcriptional activation of ap2-g (PF3D7_1222600), the 
master regulator of sexual development, from an epigenetically silenced state
during asexual replication. AP2-G expression during this 'commitment cycle'
prepares gene expression in nascent merozoites to initiate sexual development
through a hitherto unknown mechanism. To maintain a persistent infection, the
expression of ap2-g is limited to a sub-population of parasites (1-30%, depending
on genetic background and growth conditions). As sexually committed schizonts
comprise only a sub-population and are morphologically indistinguishable from
their asexually committed counterparts, defining their characteristic gene
expression has been difficult using traditional, bulk transcriptome profiling.
Here we use highly parallel, single-cell RNA sequencing of malaria cultures
undergoing sexual commitment to determine the transcriptional changes induced by 
AP2-G within this sub-population. By analysing more than 18,000 single parasite
transcriptomes from a conditional AP2-G knockdown line and NF54 wild-type
parasites at multiple stages of development, we show that sexually committed,
AP2-G+ mature schizonts specifically upregulate additional regulators of gene
expression, including other AP2 transcription factors, histone-modifying enzymes,
and regulators of nucleosome positioning. These epigenetic regulators may act to 
facilitate the expression and/or repression of genes that are necessary for the
initiation of gametocyte development in the subsequent cell cycle.
