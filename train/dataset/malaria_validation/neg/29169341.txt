BACKGROUND: It is now well-known that some antimalarials such as primaquine may
induce severe hemolytic anemia in people with G-6-PD deficiency. Antimalarial
drug prescriptions must, therefore take into account the patient's G-6-PD status 
in malaria endemic areas such as Burkina Faso, where the prevalence of this
genetic abnormality is relatively high. Although great clinical heterogeneity is 
observed depending on the molecular nature of the deficiency and the residual
enzyme activity in the red blood cell, there is very poor data on the prevalence 
of G-6-PD deficiency and the distribution of involved genetic variants in Burkina
Faso. In this systematic review, we present a synthesis of the various studies
carried out on the G-6-PD deficiency in Burkina Faso in order to determine its
prevalence, probable distribution of the genetic variants involved and their
clinical implications for a national systematic screening policy among the groups
most vulnerable to malaria.
METHODS: A systematic review was carried out to analyze available published data 
on the prevalence, phenotypes and mutations responsible for G-6-PD deficiency in 
Burkina Faso. The key words used were "G-6-PD deficiency AND Burkina Faso" or
"DÃ©ficit en G-6-PD AND Burkina Faso" in French. To identify the relevant
articles, two independent reviewers reviewed the titles, abstracts and the full
text of the selected papers.
RESULTS: An average prevalence of 16.6% (183/1100; CI 95%: 0.145-0.190) and 6.5% 
(69/1066; CI 95%: 0.051-0.081) of G-6-PD deficiency was found respectively in men
and women in this systematic review. Although the predominance (99.8% of G-6-PD
deficient cases) of 202A/376G G-6-PD A- variant, the Santamaria and Betica Selma 
variants were identified in Burkina Faso. Independently of the method used, the
enzymatic deficiency was significantly higher in males (2.5-20.5%) compared to
females (3.3-12.3%).
CONCLUSION: This systematic review suggests that despite the ubiquity of the
202A/376G G-6-PD A- variant in Burkina Faso, it will be necessary to consider the
Santamaria and Betica Selma variants although their frequencies remain to be
specified. A systematic screening of the G-6-PD deficiency is also needed to
prevent the occurrence of iatrogenic hemolytic accidents.
