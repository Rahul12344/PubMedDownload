Major efforts are currently underway to develop novel, complementary methods to
combat mosquito-borne diseases. Mosquito genetic control strategies (GCSs) have
become an increasingly important area of research on account of their
species-specificity, track record in targeting agricultural insect pests, and
their environmentally non-polluting nature. A number of programs targeting Aedes 
and Anopheles mosquitoes, vectors of human arboviruses and malaria respectively, 
are currently being developed or deployed in many parts of the world.
Operationally implementing these technologies on a large scale however, beyond
proof-of-concept pilot programs, is hampered by the absence of adequate sex
separation methods. Sex separation eliminates females in the laboratory from male
mosquitoes prior to release. Despite the need for sex separation for the control 
of mosquitoes, there have been limited efforts in recent years in developing
systems that are fit-for-purpose. In this special issue of Parasites and Vectors 
we report on the progress of the global Coordinated Research Program on
"Exploring genetic, molecular, mechanical and behavioural methods for sex
separation in mosquitoes" that is led by the Insect Pest Control Subprogramme of 
the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture with
the specific aim of building efficient sex separation systems for mosquito
species. In an effort to overcome current barriers we briefly highlight what we
believe are the three main reasons why progress has been so slow in developing
appropriate sex separation systems: the availability of methods that are not
scalable, the difficulty of building the ideal genetic systems and, finally, the 
lack of research efforts in this area.
