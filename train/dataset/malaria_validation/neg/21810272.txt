BACKGROUND: Anopheles lesteri is a primary vector of Plasmodium spp. in central
China. A complete understanding of vector population structure and the processes 
responsible for the differentiation is important to the vector-based malaria
control programmes and for identifying heterogeneity in disease transmission as a
result of discrete vector populations. There is no adequate An. lesteri
population genetic data available.
METHODS: Polymorphism of sequence variations in mitochondrial COII and Cytb genes
were assessed to explore the level of genetic variability and differentiation
among six populations of An. lesteri from China.
RESULTS: There were 30 (4.37%) and 21 (5.33%) polymorphic sites for mtDNA-COII
and Cytb gene, respectively. Totally 31 COII and 30 Cytb haplotypes were
obtained. The range of FST values was from 0.101 to 0.655 by mtDNA-COII, and
0.029 to 0.231 by Cytb gene. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed
that the percentage of variation within populations (65.83%, 88.48%) was greater 
than that among populations (34.17%, 11.52%) using both genes. The Tajima's D and
Fu's Fs values were all negative, except Tajima's D values of YN and HNB
populations, which suggest a large number of low-frequency mutations in
populations and the populations were in expansion proceeding.
CONCLUSIONS: Levels of genetic variation within An. lesteri populations were
higher than among them. While these results may suggest considerable levels of
gene flow, other explanations, such as the effect of historical population
perturbations can also be hypothesized.
