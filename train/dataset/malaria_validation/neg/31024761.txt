Background: Hypusination is an essential post-translational modification in
eukaryotes. The two enzymes required for this modification, namely deoxyhypusine 
synthase (DHS) and deoxyhypusine hydrolase are also conserved. Plasmodium
falciparum human malaria parasites possess genes for both hypusination enzymes,
which are hypothesized to be targets of antimalarial drugs.
Methods: Transgenic P. falciparum parasites with modification of the
PF3D7_1412600 gene encoding PfDHS enzyme were created by insertion of the glmS
riboswitch or the M9 inactive variant. The PfDHS protein was studied in
transgenic parasites by confocal microscopy and Western immunoblotting. The
biochemical function of PfDHS enzyme in parasites was assessed by hypusination
and nascent protein synthesis assays. Gene essentiality was assessed by
competitive growth assays and chemogenomic profiling.
Results: Clonal transgenic parasites with integration of glmS riboswitch
downstream of the PfDHS gene were established. PfDHS protein was present in the
cytoplasm of transgenic parasites in asexual stages. The PfDHS protein could be
attenuated fivefold in transgenic parasites with an active riboswitch, whereas
PfDHS protein expression was unaffected in control transgenic parasites with
insertion of the riboswitch-inactive sequence. Attenuation of PfDHS expression
for 72 h led to a significant reduction of hypusinated protein; however, global
protein synthesis was unaffected. Parasites with attenuated PfDHS expression
showed a significant growth defect, although their decline was not as rapid as
parasites with attenuated dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase
(PfDHFR-TS) expression. PfDHS-attenuated parasites showed increased sensitivity
to N 1-guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane, a structural analog of spermidine, and a known 
inhibitor of DHS enzymes.
Discussion: Loss of PfDHS function leads to reduced hypusination, which may be
important for synthesis of some essential proteins. The growth defect in
parasites with attenuated Pf DHS expression suggests that this gene is essential.
However, the slower decline of PfDHS mutants compared with PfDHFR-TS mutants in
competitive growth assays suggests that PfDHS is less vulnerable as an
antimalarial target. Nevertheless, the data validate PfDHS as an antimalarial
target which can be inhibited by spermidine-like compounds.
