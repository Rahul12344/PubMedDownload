Aims: Chemical and biological studies of the River Nile derived-microorganisms
are limited. Hence, this work was carried out to screen the River Nile habitat.
Identification of the isolated organisms, chemical profiling of their ethyl
acetate extracts as well as screening of their antimicrobial, antileishmanial,
antitrypanosomal, and antimalarial activities were investigated.
Methods: Identification of the microbial isolates were carried out using
bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal 18S rRNA gene sequencing. Chemical profiling of the
EtOAc extracts using LC-HRESIMS spectroscopy was carried out. The in vitro
antimicrobial screening using the modified version of the CLSI method,
antileishmanial and antitrypanosomal activities were screened using Leishmania
donovani promastigote assay, L. donovani axenic amastigote assay, Trypanosoma
brucei trypamastigotes assay and THP1 toxicity assay. The in vitro antimalarial
activities against D6 (chloroquine sensitive) and W2 (chloroquine-resistant)
strains of Plasmodium falciparum were evaluated.
Results: Seven isolated microorganisms were identified as Streptomyces
indiaensis, Bacillus safensis, B. anthracis, Bacillus sp., and Aspergillus
awamori. Chemical investigation of different extracts showed several bioactive
compounds, identified as; nigragillin, 5-caboxybenzofuran and dyramide B from A. 
awamori and actinopolysporin B from S. indiaensis. On the other hand many
nitrogenous compounds with high molecular weights showed no hits that may
correspond to new long chain and/or cyclic peptides. The EtOAc extract of B.
safensis fermentation broth showed the highest activity against P. falciparum D6 
and P. falciparum W2 (IC50 = 25.94 and 27.28 μg/mL, respectively), while two
isolates S. indiaensis and Bacillus sp. RN-011 extracts showed the highest
antitrypanosomal activity (IC50 = 0.8 and 0.96 μg/mL).
Conclusion: The River Nile could be a new source for production of promising
bioactive leading compound where antimicrobial and antiparasitic activities may
be correlated.
