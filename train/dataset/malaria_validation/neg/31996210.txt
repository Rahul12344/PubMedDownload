BACKGROUND: Molecular detection of low-density Plasmodium falciparum infections
is essential for surveillance studies conducted to inform malaria control
strategies in close-to-elimination settings. Molecular monitoring of residual
malaria infections usually requires a large study size, therefore sampling and
diagnostic processes need to be economical and optimized for high-throughput. A
method comparison was undertaken to identify the most efficient diagnostic
procedure for processing large collections of community samples with optimal test
sensitivity, simplicity, and minimal costs.
METHODS: In a reactive case detection study conducted on Zanzibar, parasitaemia
of 4590 individuals of all ages was investigated by a highly sensitive
quantitative (q) PCR that targets multiple var gene copies per parasite genome.
To reduce cost, a first round of positivity screening was performed on pools of
dried blood spots from five individuals. Ten cycles of a pre-PCR were performed
directly on the filter paper punches, followed by qPCR. In a second round,
samples of positive pools were individually analysed by pre-PCR and qPCR.
RESULTS: Prevalence in household members and neighbors of index cases was 1.7%
(78/4590) with a geometric mean parasite density of 58 parasites/µl blood. Using 
qPCR as gold standard, diagnostic sensitivity of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)
was 37% (29/78). Infections positive by qPCR but negative by RDT had mean
densities of 15 parasites/µl blood.
CONCLUSION: The approach of pre-screening reactive case detection samples in
pools of five was ideal for a low prevalence setting such as in Zanzibar.
Performing direct PCR on filter paper punches saves substantial time and
justifies the higher cost for a polymerase suitable for amplifying DNA directly
from whole blood. Molecular monitoring in community samples provided a more
accurate picture of infection prevalence, as it identified a potential reservoir 
of infection that was largely missed by RDT. The developed qPCR-based methodology
for screening large sample sets represents primarily a research tool that should 
inform the design of malaria elimination strategies. It may also prove beneficial
for diagnostic tasks in surveillance-response activities.
