The emergence and spread of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum impedes global
efforts to control and eliminate malaria. For decades, treatment of malaria has
relied on chloroquine (CQ), a safe and affordable 4-aminoquinoline that was
highly effective against intra-erythrocytic asexual blood-stage parasites, until 
resistance arose in Southeast Asia and South America and spread worldwide1.
Clinical resistance to the chemically related current first-line combination drug
piperaquine (PPQ) has now emerged regionally, reducing its efficacy2. Resistance 
to CQ and PPQ has been associated with distinct sets of point mutations in the P.
falciparum CQ-resistance transporter PfCRT, a 49-kDa member of the
drug/metabolite transporter superfamily that traverses the membrane of the acidic
digestive vacuole of the parasite3-9. Here we present the structure, at 3.2 Å
resolution, of the PfCRT isoform of CQ-resistant, PPQ-sensitive South American
7G8 parasites, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and antigen-binding
fragment technology. Mutations that contribute to CQ and PPQ resistance localize 
primarily to moderately conserved sites on distinct helices that line a central
negatively charged cavity, indicating that this cavity is the principal site of
interaction with the positively charged CQ and PPQ. Binding and transport studies
reveal that the 7G8 isoform binds both drugs with comparable affinities, and that
these drugs are mutually competitive. The 7G8 isoform transports CQ in a
membrane potential- and pH-dependent manner, consistent with an active efflux
mechanism that drives CQ resistance5, but does not transport PPQ. Functional
studies on the newly emerging PfCRT F145I and C350R mutations, associated with
decreased PPQ susceptibility in Asia and South America, respectively6,9, reveal
their ability to mediate PPQ transport in 7G8 variant proteins and to confer
resistance in gene-edited parasites. Structural, functional and in silico
analyses suggest that distinct mechanistic features mediate the resistance to CQ 
and PPQ in PfCRT variants. These data provide atomic-level insights into the
molecular mechanism of this key mediator of antimalarial treatment failures.
