Genetic association studies are popular for identifying genetic variants, such as
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), that are associated with complex traits. 
Statistical tests are commonly performed one SNP at a time with an assumed mode
of inheritance such as recessive, additive, or dominant genetic model. Such
analysis can result in inadequate power when the employed model deviates from the
underlying true genetic model. We propose an integrative association test
procedure under a generalized linear model framework to flexibly model the data
from the above three common genetic models and beyond. A computationally
efficient resampling procedure is adopted to estimate the null distribution of
the proposed test statistic. Simulation results show that our methods maintain
the Type I error rate irrespective of the existence of confounding covariates and
achieve adequate power compared to the methods with the true genetic model. The
new methods are applied to two genetic studies on the resistance of severe
malaria and sarcoidosis.
