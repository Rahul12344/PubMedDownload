BACKGROUND: Red blood cell (RBC) polymorphisms are common in malaria endemic
regions and are known to protect against severe forms of the disease. Therefore, 
it is important to screen for these polymorphisms in drugs or vaccines efficacy
trials. This study was undertaken to evaluate associations between clinical
malaria and RBC polymorphisms to assess biological interactions that may be
necessary for consideration when designing clinical trials.
METHOD: In a cross-sectional study of 341 febrile children less than five years
of age, associations between clinical malaria and common RBC polymorphisms
including the sickle cell gene and G6PD deficiency was evaluated between November
2008 and June 2009 in the middle belt of Ghana, Kintampo. G6PD deficiency was
determined by quantitative methods whiles haemoglobin variants were determined by
haemoglobin titan gel electrophoresis. Blood smears were stained with Giemsa and 
parasite densities were determined microscopically.
RESULTS: The prevalence of clinical malarial among the enrolled children was
31.9%. The frequency of G6PD deficiency was 19.0% and that for the haemoglobin
variants were 74.7%, 14.7%, 9.1%, 0.9% respectively for HbAA, HbAC, HbAS and
HbSS. In Multivariate regression analysis, children with the HbAS genotype had
79% lower risk of malaria infection compared to those with the HbAA genotypes
(OR = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.06-0.73, p = 0.01). HbAC genotype was not significantly
associated with malaria infection relative to the HbAA genotype (OR = 0.70, 95%
CI: 0.35-1.42, p = 0.33). G6PD deficient subgroup had a marginally increased risk
of malaria infection compared to the G6PD normal subgroup (OR = 1.76, 95% CI:
0.98-3.16, p = 0.06).
CONCLUSION: These results confirm previous findings showing a protective effect
of sickle cell trait on clinical malaria infection. However, G6PD deficiency was 
associated with a marginal increase in susceptibility to clinical malaria
compared to children without G6PD deficiency.
