Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) play a critical role in malaria diagnosis and
control. The emergence of Plasmodium falciparum parasites that can evade
detection by RDTs threatens control and elimination efforts. These parasites lack
or have altered genes encoding histidine-rich proteins (HRPs) 2 and 3, the
antigens recognized by HRP2-based RDTs. Surveillance of such parasites is
dependent on identifying false-negative RDT results among suspected malaria
cases, a task made more challenging during the current pandemic because of the
overlap of symptoms between malaria and COVID-19, particularly in areas of low
malaria transmission. Here, we share our perspective on the emergence of P.
falciparum parasites lacking HRP2 and HRP3, and the surveillance needed to
identify them amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
