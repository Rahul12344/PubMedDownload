We have previously developed a robust salivary gland-specific expression system
in transgenic Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. To establish transgenic mosquito
lines refractory to Plasmodium falciparum using this system, we generated a
transgenic mosquito harbouring the gene encoding an anti-P. falciparum
circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) single-chain antibody (scFv) fused to DsRed in a
secretory form (mDsRed-2A10 scFv). Fluorescence microscopy showed that the
mDsRed-2A10 scFv was localized in the secretory cavities and ducts of the
salivary glands in a secreted form. To evaluate P. falciparum
transmission-blocking in a rodent malaria model, a transgenic Plasmodium berghei 
line expressing PfCSP in place of PbCSP (PfCSP/Pb) was constructed. The PfCSP/Pb 
parasites were able to bind to the mDsRed-2A10 scFv in the salivary glands of the
transgenic mosquitoes. Importantly, the infectivity of the transgenic mosquitoes 
to mice was strongly impaired, indicating that the parasites had been
inactivated. These results suggest that salivary gland-specific expression of
antisporozoite molecules could be a promising strategy for blocking malaria
transmission to humans.
