In malaria-endemic areas, most pregnant women are susceptible to asymptomatic
Plasmodium falciparum infections. We present here the results of a
cross-sectional study conducted in Madibou, a southern district of Brazzaville in
the Republic of Congo, between March 2014 and April 2015. The main aim was to
characterize P. falciparum infections. Blood samples corresponding to peripheral,
placental and cord from 370 asymptomatic malaria women at delivery were diagnosed
for plasmodium infection by thick blood smears (microscopic infection).
Sub-microscopic infection was detected by PCR, using the MSP-2 gene as marker.
Microscopic infections were detected in peripheral, placental and cord blood
samples with a prevalence of respectively 7.3% (27/370), 2.7% (10/370) and 0%.
The negative samples were submitted to sub-microscopic detection, with respective
prevalence of 25.4% (87/343), 16.7% (60/360) and 9.4% (35/370) (P < 0.001). We
further investigated the genetic diversity of the parasite by characterizing MSP2
allelic families 3D7 (24 distinct alleles) and FC27 (20 distinct alleles). The
total number of alleles for these two families were 31, 25 and 19 in peripheral, 
placental and cord samples respectively. The 3D7 MSP-2 was the predominant
allelic family. The multiplicity of infections (MOI) in peripheral (mean
1.4 ± 0.01; range 1-4), placental (mean 1.2 ± 0.01; range 1-3) and cord samples
(1.4 ± 0.01; range 1-3) were similar (P = 0.9) and are unaffected by age,
gravidity or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. These results shown a high prevalence of 
sub-microscopic infection and a high genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum
strains in Congo. Age, gravidity and doses of preventive treatment based on
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine do not interfere with the multiplicity of infections.
