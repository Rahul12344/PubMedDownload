Macrophages express a wide array of invariant receptors that facilitate host
defense and mediate pathogenesis during pathogen invasion. We report on a novel
population of CD11bhighCD14+F4/80+ macrophages that express TCRβ. This population
expands dramatically during a Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection and sequesters in
the brain during experimental cerebral malaria. Importantly, measurement of TCRβ 
transcript and protein levels in macrophages in wildtype versus nude and Rag1
knockout mice establishes that the observed expression is not a consequence of
passive receptor expression due to phagocytosis or trogocytosis of peripheral T
cells or nonspecific antibody staining to an Fc receptor or cross reactive
epitope. We also demonstrate that TCRβ on brain sequestered macrophages undergoes
productive gene rearrangements and shows preferential Vβ usage. Remarkably, there
is a significant correlation in the proportion of macrophages that express TCRβ
and peripheral parasitemia. In addition, presence of TCRβ on the macrophage also 
correlates with a significant increase (1.9 fold) in the phagocytosis of
parasitized erythrocytes. By transcriptional profiling, we identify a novel set
of genes and pathways that associate with TCRβ expression by the macrophage.
Expansion of TCRβ-expressing macrophages points towards a convergence of the
innate and adaptive immune responses where both arms of the immune system
cooperate to modulate the host response to malaria and possibly other infections.
