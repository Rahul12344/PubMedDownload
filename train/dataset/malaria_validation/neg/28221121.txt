Artemisinin resistance containment in Myanmar was initiated in 2011 after
artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria was reported. Molecular
evidence suggests that asymptomatic malaria infections harboring drug resistance 
genes are present among residents of the Myanmar artemisinin resistance
containment zone. This evidence supports efforts to eliminate these hidden
infections.
