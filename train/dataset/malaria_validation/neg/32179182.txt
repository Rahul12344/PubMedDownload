Only recently it was discovered that haemoglobin (Hb) belongs to the standard
gene repertoire of insects, although their tracheal system is used for
respiration. A classical oxygen-carrying function of Hb is only obvious for
hexapods living in hypoxic environments. In other insect species, including the
common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the physiological role of Hb is yet
unclear. Here, we study recombinant haemoglobin from the European honeybee Apis
mellifera (Ame) and the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae (Aga). Spectroscopic
evidence shows that both proteins can be classified as hexacoordinate Hbs with a 
strong affinity for the distal histidine. AgaHb1 is proposed to play a role in
oxygen transport or sensing based on its multimeric state, slow autoxidation, and
small but significant amount of five-coordinated haem in the deoxy ferrous form. 
AmeHb appears to behave more like vertebrate neuroglobin with a complex function 
given its diversified distribution in the genome.
