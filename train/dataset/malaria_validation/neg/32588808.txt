Liver fluke infection caused by Opisthorchis viverrini is recognized as a
potential risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). The National Strategic Plan
to Control Liver Fluke Infection and Cholangiocarcinoma has implemented
microscopic-based stool examination screening. However, eggs of O. viverrini and 
minute intestinal flukes (MIFs) are nearly morphologically similar and could
result in inaccurate O. viverrini diagnosis. Stool specimens were collected from 
eight districts of Chiang Mai Province in northern Thailand. Opisthorchis-like
eggs were identified with the Kato-Katz technique and differentiated for O.
viverrini and MIFs using molecular study by PCR and PCR-restriction fragment
length polymorphism targeting the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) gene.
Prevalence of Opisthorchis-like eggs was 5.9% from a total of 9,570 specimens.
From PCR assays, all liver flukes were O. viverrini and all MIFs were Haplorchis 
taichui. The distribution of species was H. taichui (38.2%), O. viverrini
(10.5%), coinfection of H. taichui and O. viverrini (37.2%), and 14.1% were
negative from PCR. Totally, H. taichui was found in 75.4% of infections from
Opisthorchis-like specimens. ITS2 nucleotide sequencing analysis showed a single 
variant of O. viverrini with no variation and two variants of H. taichui. This
study first revealed the genetic background of Opisthorchis-like eggs in northern
Thailand. Minute intestinal flukes are occasionally misdiagnosed as O. viverrini 
leading to misinterpretation and overestimation of the burden of O. viverrini
infection. Molecular diagnosis such as PCR could effectively discriminate species
of Opisthorchis-like eggs and help shape the robustness of epidemiological data
to control liver fluke infection and raise awareness of other risk factors for
CCA.
