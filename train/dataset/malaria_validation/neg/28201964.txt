BACKGROUND: Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family are conserved molecules that
constitute a major part of the cell's protein folding machinery. The role of
Hsp70s of parasitic origin in host cell immune modulation has remained
contentious. This is largely due to the fact that several studies implicating
Hsp70 in immune modulation rely on the use of recombinant protein derived from
bacteria which is often fraught with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) contamination. For 
this reason, there is need to clarify the role of parasite Hsp70 in modulating
host immune cells.
OBJECTIVE: The current study sought to investigate the role of Plasmodium
falciparum Hsp70 (PfHsp70) in immune modulation.
METHOD: We expressed recombinant PfHsp70 using three bacterial expression hosts: 
E. coli XL1 Blue, E. coli ClearColi BL21 and Brevibacillus choshinensis,
respectively. We further investigated the immunostimulatory capability of PfHsp70
by monitoring cytokine production by murine immune cells cultured in the presence
of the protein.
RESULTS: Recombinant PfHsp70 produced using E. coli XL1 Blue expression host
induced IL6 and IL8 cytokines. On the other hand, PfHsp70 produced in E. coli
ClearColi and B. choshinensis expression systems was associated with no
detectable traces of LPS and exhibited no immunomodulatory activity.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that PfHsp70 does not possess
immunomodulatory function. Furthermore, our study further confirm E. coli
ClearColi and B. choshinensis as appropriate expression systems for the
production of LPS-free recombinant protein.
