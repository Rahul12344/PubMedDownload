Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is only used for intermittent preventive
treatment during pregnancy (IPTp) in most Sub-Saharan African countries. However,
there are concerns about the efficacy of IPTp-SP because of increasing
resistance. Combinations of point mutations in the dhps and dhfr genes of
Plasmodium falciparum are associated with SP resistance, in particular the
quintuple dhfr (N51, C59, S108) - dhps (codons A437, K540) mutant. In Nanoro,
Burkina Faso, filter paper samples from pregnant women at first antenatal care
visit and at delivery plus samples from the general population (GP) were studied 
for dhfr and dhps mutations by sequencing. Quintuple mutants were present in 2
delivery and 4 GP samples. This is the first time the quintuple mutation is found
in Burkina Faso and although the prevalence is still very low, emergence of the
quintuple mutation could highly diminish the efficacy of IPTp-SP. Close
surveillance of SP resistance mutations is therefore warranted.
