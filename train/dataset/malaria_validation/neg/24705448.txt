The major vectors of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa belong to subgenus Cellia.
Yet, phylogenetic relationships and temporal diversification among African
mosquito species have not been unambiguously determined. Knowledge about vector
evolutionary history is crucial for correct interpretation of genetic changes
identified through comparative genomics analyses. In this study, we estimated a
molecular phylogeny using 49 gene sequences for the African malaria vectors An.
gambiae, An. funestus, An. nili, the Asian malaria mosquito An. stephensi, and
the outgroup species Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti. To infer the
phylogeny, we identified orthologous sequences uniformly distributed
approximately every 5 Mb in the five chromosomal arms. The sequences were aligned
and the phylogenetic trees were inferred using maximum likelihood and
neighbor-joining methods. Bayesian molecular dating using a relaxed log normal
model was used to infer divergence times. Trees from individual genes agreed with
each other, placing An. nili as a basal clade that diversified from the studied
malaria mosquito species 47.6 million years ago (mya). Other African malaria
vectors originated more recently, and independently acquired traits related to
vectorial capacity. The lineage leading to An. gambiae diverged 30.4 mya, while
the African vector An. funestus and the Asian vector An. stephensi were the most 
closely related sister taxa that split 20.8 mya. These results were supported by 
consistently high bootstrap values in concatenated phylogenetic trees generated
individually for each chromosomal arm. Genome-wide multigene phylogenetic
analysis is a useful approach for discerning historic relationships among malaria
vectors, providing a framework for the correct interpretation of genomic changes 
across species, and comprehending the evolutionary origins of this ubiquitous and
deadly insect-borne disease.
