Parasites of the genus Plasmodium infect a wide range of mammalian hosts
including humans, primates, bats and arboreal rodents. A hallmark of Plasmodium
spp. is the very narrow host range, indicative of matching parasite-host
coevolution. Accordingly, their respective genomes harbour many unique genes and 
gene families that typically encode proteins involved in host cell recognition
and remodelling. Whether and to what extent conserved proteins that are shared
across Plasmodium spp. also exert distinct species-specific roles remains largely
untested. Here, we present detailed functional profiling of the female
gametocyte-specific ATP-binding cassette transporter gABCG2 in the murine
parasite Plasmodium berghei and compare our findings with data from the
orthologous gene in the human parasite Plasmodium falciparum. We show that P.
berghei gABCG2 is female-specific and continues to be expressed in zygotes and
ookinetes. In contrast to a distinct localization to Iipid-rich
gametocyte-specific spots as observed in P. falciparum, the murine malaria
parasite homolog is found at the parasite plasma membrane. Plasmodium berghei
lacking gABCG2 displays fast asexual blood-stage replication and increased
proportions of female gametocytes, consistent with the corresponding P.
falciparum knock-out phenotype. Strikingly, cross-species replacement of gABCG2
in either the murine or the human parasite did not restore normal growth rates.
The lack of successful complementation despite high conservation across
Plasmodium spp. is an indicator of distinct adaptations and tight parasite-host
coevolution. Hence, incompatibility of conserved genes in closely related
Plasmodium spp. might be more common than previously anticipated.
