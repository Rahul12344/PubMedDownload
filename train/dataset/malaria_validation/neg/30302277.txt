The precise role of autophagy in P. falciparum remains largely unknown. Although 
a limited number of autophagy genes have been identified in this apicomplexan,
only PfAtg8 has been characterized to a certain extent. On the basis of the
expression levels of PfAtg8 and the putative PfAtg5, we report that the basal
autophagy in this parasite is quite robust and mediates not only the
intraerythrocytic development but also fresh invasion of red blood cells (RBCs)
in the subsequent cycles. We demonstrate that the basal autophagy responds to
both inducers and inhibitors of autophagy. In addition, the parasite survival
upon starvation is temporally governed by the autophagy status. Brief periods of 
starvation, which induces autophagy, help survival while prolonged starvation
decreases autophagy leading to stalled parasite growth and reduced invasion.
Thus, starvation-induced autophagy is context dependent. Importantly, we report
characterization of another autophagy marker in this parasite, the putative
PfAtg5 (Pf3D7_1430400). PfAtg5 is expressed in all the intraerythrocytic stages
and partially colocalizes with ER, mitochondria, apicoplast and PfAtg8. It is
also present on the double membrane bound vesicles. Altogether, these studies
pave way for the detailed dissection of P. falciparum autophagy machinery and
insights into molecular and functional characterization of its players for
developing new therapeutics as antimalarials.
