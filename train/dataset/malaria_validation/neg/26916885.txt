Adherence of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes to host endothelium is
conferred through the parasite-derived virulence factor P. falciparum erythrocyte
membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), the major contributor to malaria severity. PfEMP1
located at knob structures on the erythrocyte surface is anchored to the
cytoskeleton, and the Plasmodium helical interspersed subtelomeric (PHIST) gene
family plays a role in many host cell modifications including binding the
intracellular domain of PfEMP1. Here, we show that conditional reduction of the
PHIST protein PFE1605w strongly reduces adhesion of infected erythrocytes to the 
endothelial receptor CD36. Adhesion to other endothelial receptors was less
affected or even unaltered by PFE1605w depletion, suggesting that PHIST proteins 
might be optimized for subsets of PfEMP1 variants. PFE1605w does not play a role 
in PfEMP1 transport, but it directly interacts with both the intracellular
segment of PfEMP1 and with cytoskeletal components. This is the first report of a
PHIST protein interacting with key molecules of the cytoadherence complex and the
host cytoskeleton, and this functional role seems to play an essential role in
the pathology of P. falciparum.
