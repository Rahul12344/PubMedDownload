BACKGROUND: Parasite prevalence and diversity are determined by the distribution 
of hosts and vectors and by the interplay among a suite of environmental factors.
Distributions of parasite lineages vary based on host susceptibility and
geographical barriers. Hemoparasites of the genera Haemoproteus and Plasmodium
have wide distributions, and high prevalence and genetic diversity within
perching birds (Order Passeriformes). The rufous-collared sparrow (Zonotrichia
capensis) is widely distributed in Central and South America across an immense
diversity of environments from sea level to more than 4000 meters above sea
level. It therefore provides an excellent model to investigate whether
altitudinal and latitudinal gradients influence the distribution, prevalence and 
diversity of haemosporidian parasites, their population structure and the
biogeographical boundaries of distinct parasite lineages.
RESULTS: We assembled samples from 1317 rufous-collared sparrows spanning 75
locales from across Central and South America (between 9.5°N and 54°S; 10-4655
meters above sea level). We used DNA sequence data from a fragment of the
mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (cytb) of Haemoproteus and Plasmodium from 325
positive samples and found prevalences of 22 and 3%, respectively. Haemoproteus
exhibited a higher prevalence than Plasmodium but with comparatively lower
genetic diversity. We detected a relationship of Plasmodium and Haemoproteus
prevalence with altitude and latitude; however, altitude and latitude did not
influence parasite diversity.
CONCLUSIONS: Parasite lineages showed a phylogeographical boundary coincident
with the Andes Mountains, although we also observed a north-south disjunction in 
Peru for Haemoproteus. Haemosporidian distribution was not homogeneous but
differed based on latitude and altitude. This is most probably due to
environmental factors that have influenced both vector distribution and
abundance, as well as parasite development. Our study provides key insights on
the distribution of haemoparasite lineages and parasite dynamics within hosts.
