: Background: Diversity in Plasmodium falciparum poses a major threat to malaria 
control and elimination interventions. This study utilized 12 polymorphic
microsatellite (MS) markers and the Msp2 marker to examine diversity,
multiplicity of infection (MOI) as well as the population structure of parasites 
circulating in two sites separated by about 92 km and with varying malaria
transmission intensities within the Greater Accra Region of Ghana.METHODS: The
diversity and MOI of P. falciparum parasites in 160 non-symptomatic volunteers
living in Obom (high malaria transmission intensity) and Asutsuare (low malaria
transmission intensity) aged between 8 and 60 years was determined using Msp2
genotyping and microsatellite analysis.
RESULTS: The prevalence of asymptomatic P. falciparum carriers as well as the
parasite density of infections was significantly higher in Obom than in
Asutsuare. Samples from Asutsuare and Obom were 100% and 65% clonal,
respectively, by Msp2 genotyping but decreased to 50% and 5%, respectively, when 
determined by MS analysis. The genetic composition of parasites from Obom and
Asutsuare were highly distinct, with parasites from Obom being more diverse than 
those from Asutsuare.
CONCLUSION: Plasmodium falciparum parasites circulating in Obom are genetically
more diverse and distinct from those circulating in Asutsuare. The MOI in samples
from both Obom and Asutsuare increased when assessed by MS analysis relative to
MSP2 genotyping. The TA40 and TA87 loci are useful markers for estimating MOI in 
high and low parasite prevalence settings.
