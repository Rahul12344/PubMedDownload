The cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COXI) gene sequences of three recent
(2007-2008) clinical Plasmodium knowlesi isolates from Klang Valley, peninsular
Malaysia, were determined and compared with those of older (1960's) peninsular
Malaysia, recent isolates from Sarawak (on Borneo Island), and an isolate from
Thailand. Multiple alignment of the sequences showed that the three clinical
isolates were more similar to the older peninsular Malaysia isolates than to
those from Sarawak and Thailand. Phylogenetic tree based on the COXI sequences
revealed three distinct clusters of P. knowlesi. The first cluster consisted of
isolates from peninsular Malaysia, the second consisted of Sarawak isolates and
the third composed of the Thailand isolate. The findings of this study highlight 
the usefulness of mitochondrial COXI gene as a suitable marker for
phylogeographic studies of P. knowlesi.
