Background: Artemisia annua is a Chinese medicinal herb. Artemisinin-derivatives 
are recommended as part of a combination treatment for uncomplicated malaria.
Herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) are increasingly used worldwide and
HDS-induced liver injury is becoming a growing concern. Case Report: We present
the first case of severe acute cholestatic hepatitis due to the intake of
Artemisia annua tea as chemoprophylaxis for malaria in a patient returning from
Ethiopia. The patients presented with jaundice, elevated transaminases, and
parameters of cholestasis (total bilirubin 186.6 μmol/L, conjugated bilirubin
168.5 μmol/L). A liver biopsy showed a portal hepatitis with lymphocytic
infiltration of the bile ducts and diffuse intra-canalicular and
intra-cytoplasmic bilirubinostasis. The toxicologic analysis of the Artemisia tea
revealed the ingredients arteannuin b, deoxyartemisin, campher, and scopoletin.
There were no other identifiable etiologies of liver disease. The Roussel Uclaf
Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) score assessed a "probably" causal
relationship. Sequencing of genes encoding for hepatic transporters for bile acid
homeostasis (BSEP, MDR3, and FIC1) found no genetic variants typically associated
with hereditary cholestasis syndromes. Normalization of bilirubin occurred 3
months after the onset of disease. Conclusion: The use of artemisinin-derivatives
for malaria prevention is ineffective and potentially harmful and should thus be 
discouraged. Moreover, the case demonstrates our as yet inadequate understanding 
of the pathophysiology and susceptibility to HDS induced liver injury.
