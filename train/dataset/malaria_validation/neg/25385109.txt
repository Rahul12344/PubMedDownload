Polymorphism in the ortholog gene of the Plasmodium falciparum K13 gene was
investigated in Plasmodium vivax isolates collected in Cambodia. All of them were
Sal-1 wild-type alleles except two (2/284, 0.7%), and P. vivax K12 polymorphism
was reduced compared to that of the P. falciparum K13 gene. Both mutant allele
isolates had the same nonsynonymous mutation at codon 552 (V552I) and were from
Ratanak Kiri province. These preliminary data should encourage additional studies
for associating artemisinin or chloroquine resistance and K12 polymorphism.
