BACKGROUND: Anopheles sinensis is a major vector of malaria in China. The
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-gated chloride channel, encoded by the RDL
(Resistant to dieldrin) gene, is the important target for insecticides of widely 
varied structures. The use of various insecticides in agriculture and vector
control has inevitably led to the development of insecticide resistance, which
may reduce the control effectiveness. Therefore, it is important to investigate
the presence and distribution frequency of the resistance related mutation(s) in 
An. sinensis RDL to predict resistance to both the withdrawn cyclodienes (e.g.
dieldrin) and currently used insecticides, such as fipronil.
METHODS: Two hundred and forty adults of An. sinensis collected from nine
locations across Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region were used. Two fragments of An.
sinensis RDL (AsRDL) gene, covering the putative insecticide resistance related
sites, were sequenced respectively. The haplotypes of each individual were
reconstructed by the PHASE2.1 software, and confirmed by clone sequencing. The
phylogenetic tree was built using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian inference
methods. Genealogical relations among different haplotypes were also analysed
using Network 5.0.
RESULTS: The coding region of AsRDL gene was 1674Â bp long, encoding a protein of 
557 amino acids. AsRDL had 98.0% amino acid identity to that from Anopheles
funestus, and shared common structural features of Cys-loop ligand-gated ion
channels. Three resistance-related amino acid substitutions (A296S, V327I and
T345S) were detected in all the nine populations of An. sinensis in Guangxi, with
the 296S mutation being the most abundant (77-100%), followed by 345S (22-47%)
and 327I (8-60%). 38 AsRDL haplotypes were identified from 240 individuals at
frequencies ranging from 0.2 to 34.8%. Genealogical analysis suggested multiple
origins of the 345S mutation in AsRDL.
CONCLUSIONS: The near fixation of the 296S mutation and the occurrence of the
327I and 345S mutations in addition to 296S, in all the nine tested An. sinensis 
populations in Guangxi, strongly indicate a risk of multiple insecticide
resistance. The haplotype diversity plus genetic heterogeneities in the
geographical distribution, and multiple origins of AsRDL alleles call for a
location-customized strategy for monitoring and management of insecticide
resistance.
