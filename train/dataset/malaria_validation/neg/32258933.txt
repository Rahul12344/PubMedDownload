A phenotypic whole cell high-throughput screen against the asexual blood and
liver stages of the malaria parasite identified a benzimidazole chemical series. 
Among the hits were the antiemetic benzimidazole drug Lerisetron 1 (IC50 NF54 =
0.81 μM) and its methyl-substituted analogue 2 (IC50 NF54 = 0.098 μM). A
medicinal chemistry hit to lead effort led to the identification of
chloro-substituted analogue 3 with high potency against the drug-sensitive NF54
(IC50 NF54 = 0.062 μM) and multidrug-resistant K1 (IC50 K1 = 0.054 μM) strains of
the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Compounds 2 and 3 gratifyingly 
showed in vivo efficacy in both Plasmodium berghei and P. falciparum mouse models
of malaria. Cardiotoxicity risk as expressed in strong inhibition of the human
ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel was identified as a major
liability to address. This led to the synthesis and biological assessment of
around 60 analogues from which several compounds with improved antiplasmodial
potency, relative to the lead compound 3, were identified.
