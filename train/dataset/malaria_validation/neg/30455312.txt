Concerns about malaria parasite resistance to treatment with artemisinin drugs
(ARTs) have grown with findings of prolonged parasite clearance t 1/2s (>5 h) and
their association with mutations in Plasmodium falciparum Kelch-propeller protein
K13. Here, we describe a P. falciparum laboratory cross of K13 C580Y mutant with 
C580 wild-type parasites to investigate ART response phenotypes in vitro and in
vivo. After genotyping >400 isolated progeny, we evaluated 20 recombinants in
vitro: IC50 measurements of dihydroartemisinin were at similar low nanomolar
levels for C580Y- and C580-type progeny (mean ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.62-1.61),
whereas, in a ring-stage survival assay, the C580Y-type progeny had 19.6-fold
(95% CI, 9.76-39.2) higher average counts. In splenectomized Aotus monkeys
treated with three daily doses of i.v. artesunate, t 1/2 calculations by three
different methods yielded mean differences of 0.01 h (95% CI, -3.66 to 3.67),
0.80 h (95% CI, -0.92 to 2.53), and 2.07 h (95% CI, 0.77-3.36) between C580Y and 
C580 infections. Incidences of recrudescence were 57% in C580Y (4 of 7) versus
70% in C580 (7 of 10) infections (-13% difference; 95% CI, -58% to 35%). Allelic 
substitution of C580 in a C580Y-containing progeny clone (76H10) yielded a
transformant (76H10C580Rev) that, in an infected monkey, recrudesced regularly 13
times over 500 d. Frequent recrudescences of ART-treated P. falciparum infections
occur with or without K13 mutations and emphasize the need for improved partner
drugs to effectively eliminate the parasites that persist through the ART
component of combination therapy.
