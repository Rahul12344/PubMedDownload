Glycosylation processes are under high natural selection pressure, presumably
because these can modulate resistance to infection. Here, we asked whether
inactivation of the UDP-galactose:β-galactoside-α1-3-galactosyltransferase
(α1,3GT) gene, which ablated the expression of the Galα1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc-R (α-gal)
glycan and allowed for the production of anti-α-gal antibodies (Abs) in humans,
confers protection against Plasmodium spp. infection, the causative agent of
malaria and a major driving force in human evolution. We demonstrate that both
Plasmodium spp. and the human gut pathobiont E. coli O86:B7 express α-gal and
that anti-α-gal Abs are associated with protection against malaria transmission
in humans as well as in α1,3GT-deficient mice, which produce protective
anti-α-gal Abs when colonized by E. coli O86:B7. Anti-α-gal Abs target Plasmodium
sporozoites for complement-mediated cytotoxicity in the skin, immediately after
inoculation by Anopheles mosquitoes. Vaccination against α-gal confers sterile
protection against malaria in mice, suggesting that a similar approach may reduce
malaria transmission in humans.
