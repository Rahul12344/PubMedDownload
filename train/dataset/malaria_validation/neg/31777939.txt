DNA cytosine modifications are key epigenetic regulators of cellular processes in
mammalian cells, with their misregulation leading to varied disease states. In
the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, a unicellular eukaryotic
pathogen, little is known about the predominant cytosine modifications, cytosine 
methylation (5mC) and hydroxymethylation (5hmC). Here, we report the first
identification of a hydroxymethylcytosine-like (5hmC-like) modification in P.
falciparum asexual blood stages using a suite of biochemical methods. In contrast
to mammalian cells, we report 5hmC-like levels in the P. falciparum genome of
0.2-0.4%, which are significantly higher than the methylated cytosine (mC) levels
of 0.01-0.05%. Immunoprecipitation of hydroxymethylated DNA followed by next
generation sequencing (hmeDIP-seq) revealed that 5hmC-like modifications are
enriched in gene bodies with minimal dynamic changes during asexual development. 
Moreover, levels of the 5hmC-like base in gene bodies positively correlated to
transcript levels, with more than 2000 genes stably marked with this modification
throughout asexual development. Our work highlights the existence of a new
predominant cytosine DNA modification pathway in P. falciparum and opens up
exciting avenues for gene regulation research and the development of
antimalarials.
