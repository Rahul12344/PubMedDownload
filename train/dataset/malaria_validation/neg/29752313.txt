Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, determine immune cell phenotype. 
To understand the epigenetic alterations induced by helminth coinfections, we
evaluated the longitudinal effect of ascariasis and schistosomiasis infection on 
CD4+ T cell DNA methylation and the downstream tuberculosis (TB)-specific and
bacillus Calmette-Guérin-induced immune phenotype. All experiments were performed
on human primary immune cells from a longitudinal cohort of recently TB-exposed
children. Compared with age-matched uninfected controls, children with active
Schistosoma haematobium and Ascaris lumbricoides infection had 751 differentially
DNA-methylated genes, with 72% hypermethylated. Gene ontology pathway analysis
identified inhibition of IFN-γ signaling, cellular proliferation, and the Th1
pathway. Targeted real-time quantitative PCR after methyl-specific endonuclease
digestion confirmed DNA hypermethylation of the transcription factors BATF3, ID2,
STAT5A, IRF5, PPARg, RUNX2, IRF4, and NFATC1 and cytokines or cytokine receptors 
IFNGR1, TNFS11, RELT (TNF receptor), IL12RB2, and IL12B (p < 0.001;
Sidak-Bonferroni). Functional blockage of the IFN-γ signaling pathway was
confirmed, with helminth-infected individuals having decreased upregulation of
IFN-γ-inducible genes (Mann-Whitney p < 0.05). Hypomethylation of the IL-4
pathway and DNA hypermethylation of the Th1 pathway was confirmed by Ag-specific 
multidimensional flow cytometry demonstrating decreased TB-specific IFN-γ and TNF
and increased IL-4 production by CD4+ T cells (Wilcoxon signed-rank p < 0.05). In
S. haematobium-infected individuals, these DNA methylation and immune phenotypic 
changes persisted at least 6 mo after successful deworming. This work
demonstrates that helminth infection induces DNA methylation and immune
perturbations that inhibit TB-specific immune control and that the duration of
these changes are helminth specific.
