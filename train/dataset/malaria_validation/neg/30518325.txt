BACKGROUND: The health and resilience of species in natural environments is
increasingly challenged by complex anthropogenic stressor combinations including 
climate change, habitat encroachment, and chemical contamination. To better
understand impacts of these stressors we examined the individual- and
combined-stressor impacts of malaria infection, food limitation, and
2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) exposures on gene expression in livers of Western
fence lizards (WFL, Sceloporus occidentalis) using custom WFL transcriptome-based
microarrays.
RESULTS: Computational analysis including annotation enrichment and correlation
analysis identified putative functional mechanisms linking transcript expression 
and toxicological phenotypes. TNT exposure increased transcript expression for
genes involved in erythropoiesis, potentially in response to TNT-induced anemia
and/or methemoglobinemia and caused dose-specific effects on genes involved in
lipid and overall energy metabolism consistent with a hormesis response of growth
stimulation at low doses and adverse decreases in lizard growth at high doses.
Functional enrichment results were indicative of inhibited potential for lipid
mobilization and catabolism in TNT exposures which corresponded with increased
inguinal fat weights and was suggestive of a decreased overall energy budget.
Malaria infection elicited enriched expression of multiple immune-related
functions likely corresponding to increased white blood cell (WBC) counts. Food
limitation alone enriched functions related to cellular energy production and
decreased expression of immune responses consistent with a decrease in WBC
levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite these findings, the lizards demonstrated immune resilience
to malaria infection under food limitation with transcriptional results
indicating a fully competent immune response to malaria, even under bio-energetic
constraints. Interestingly, both TNT and malaria individually increased
transcriptional expression of immune-related genes and increased overall WBC
concentrations in blood; responses that were retained in the TNT x malaria
combined exposure. The results demonstrate complex and sometimes unexpected
responses to multiple stressors where the lizards displayed remarkable resiliency
to the stressor combinations investigated.
