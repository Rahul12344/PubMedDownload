BACKGROUND: Anopheles barbirostris is a vector of malaria in Sri Lanka. The taxon
exists as a species complex in the Southeast Asian region. Previous studies using
molecular markers suggest that there are more than 4 distinct clades within the
An. barbirostris complex in Southeast Asia. The present study characterizes Sri
Lankan An. barbirostris using mtDNA cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and
ribosomal RNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) gene sequences.
FINDINGS: DNA was extracted from morphologically identified An. barbirostris
specimens from Sri Lanka, the COI and ITS2 regions amplified and their sequences 
analysed by comparison with other GenBank entries. Maximum likelihood trees
suggested that Sri Lankan An. barbirostris constitute a different molecular type 
most closely related to clade I.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering the uncorrected p distances between the clade I and Sri 
Lankan specimens it is fair to assume that the specimens collected from widely
separated locations in Sri Lanka with morphology characteristic of An.
barbirostris s.l. form a new molecular type with close resemblance to An.
barbirostris s.s from Indonesia and Thailand.
