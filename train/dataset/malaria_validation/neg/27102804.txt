BACKGROUND: Amplicon pyrosequencing targets a known genetic region and thus
inherently produces reads highly anticipated to have certain features, such as
conserved nucleotide sequence, and in the case of protein coding DNA, an open
reading frame. Pyrosequencing errors, consisting mainly of nucleotide insertions 
and deletions, are on the other hand likely to disrupt open reading frames. Such 
an inverse relationship between errors and expectation based on prior knowledge
can be used advantageously to guide the process known as basecalling, i.e. the
inference of nucleotide sequence from raw sequencing data.
RESULTS: The new basecalling method described here, named Multipass, implements a
probabilistic framework for working with the raw flowgrams obtained by
pyrosequencing. For each sequence variant Multipass calculates the likelihood and
nucleotide sequence of several most likely sequences given the flowgram data.
This probabilistic approach enables integration of basecalling into a larger
model where other parameters can be incorporated, such as the likelihood for
observing a full-length open reading frame at the targeted region. We apply the
method to 454 amplicon pyrosequencing data obtained from a malaria virulence gene
family, where Multipass generates 20 % more error-free sequences than current
state of the art methods, and provides sequence characteristics that allow
generation of a set of high confidence error-free sequences.
CONCLUSIONS: This novel method can be used to increase accuracy of existing and
future amplicon sequencing data, particularly where extensive prior knowledge is 
available about the obtained sequences, for example in analysis of the
immunoglobulin VDJ region where Multipass can be combined with a model for the
known recombining germline genes. Multipass is available for Roche 454 data at
http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MultiPass-1.0 , and the concept can potentially be
implemented for other sequencing technologies as well.
