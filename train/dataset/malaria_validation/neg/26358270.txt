Rabbit coccidiosis caused by members of the genus Eimeria can cause enormous
economic impact worldwide, but the genetics, epidemiology and biology of these
parasites remain poorly understood. In the present study, we sequenced and
annotated the complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes of five Eimeria species that
commonly infect the domestic rabbits. The complete mt genomes of Eimeria
intestinalis, Eimeria flavescens, Eimeria media, Eimeria vejdovskyi and Eimeria
irresidua were 6261bp, 6258bp, 6168bp, 6254bp, 6259bp in length, respectively.
All of the mt genomes consist of 3 genes for proteins (cytb, cox1, and cox3), 14 
gene fragments for the large subunit (LSU) rRNA and 11 gene fragments for the
small subunit (SSU) rRNA, but no transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. The gene order of the
mt genomes is similar to that of Plasmodium, but distinct from Haemosporida and
Theileria. Phylogenetic analyses based on full nucleotide sequences using
Bayesian analysis revealed that the monophyly of the Eimeria of rabbits was
strongly statistically supported with a Bayesian posterior probabilities. These
data provide novel mtDNA markers for studying the population genetics and
molecular epidemiology of the Eimeria species, and should have implications for
the molecular diagnosis, prevention and control of coccidiosis in rabbits.
