Plants regulate the synthesis of specialized compounds through the actions of
individual transcription factors (TFs) or sets of TFs. One such compound,
artemisinin from Artemisia annua, is widely used as a pharmacological product in 
the first-line treatment of malaria. However, the emergence of resistance to
artemisinin in Plasmodium species, as well as its low production rates, have
required innovative treatments such as exploiting the synergistic effects of
flavonoids with artemisinin. We overview current knowledge about flavonoid and
artemisinin transcriptional regulation in A. annua, and review the dual action of
TFs and structural genes that can regulate both pathways simultaneously.
Understanding the concerted action of these TFs and their associated structural
genes can guide the development of strategies to further improve flavonoid and
artemisinin production.
