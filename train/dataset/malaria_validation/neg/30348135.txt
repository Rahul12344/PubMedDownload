Whole genome sequencing and microsatellite analysis of the Plasmodium falciparum 
E5 NF54 strain show that the var, rifin and stevor gene families follow Mendelian
inheritance.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum exhibits a high degree of inter-isolate genetic
diversity in its variant surface antigen (VSA) families: P. falciparum
erythrocyte membrane protein 1, repetitive interspersed family (RIFIN) and
subtelomeric variable open reading frame (STEVOR). The role of recombination for 
the generation of this diversity is a subject of ongoing research. Here the
genome of E5, a sibling of the 3D7 genome strain is presented. Short and long
read whole genome sequencing (WGS) techniques (Ilumina, Pacific Bioscience) and a
set of 84 microsatellites (MS) were employed to characterize the 3D7 and non-3D7 
parts of the E5 genome. This is the first time that VSA genes in sibling
parasites were analysed with long read sequencing technology.
RESULTS: Of the 5733 E5 genes only 278 genes, mostly var and rifin/stevor genes, 
had no orthologues in the 3D7 genome. WGS and MS analysis revealed that
chromosomal crossovers occurred at a rate of 0-3 per chromosome. var, stevor and 
rifin genes were inherited within the respective non-3D7 or 3D7 chromosomal
context. 54 of the 84 MS PCR fragments correctly identified the respective MS as 
3D7- or non-3D7 and this correlated with var and rifin/stevor gene inheritance in
the adjacent chromosomal regions. E5 had 61 var and 189 rifin/stevor genes. One
large non-chromosomal recombination event resulted in a new var gene on
chromosome 14. The remainder of the E5 3D7-type subtelomeric and central regions 
were identical to 3D7.
CONCLUSIONS: The data show that the rifin/stevor and var gene families represent 
the most diverse compartments of the P. falciparum genome but that the majority
of var genes are inherited without alterations within their respective parental
chromosomal context. Furthermore, MS genotyping with 54 MS can successfully
distinguish between two sibling progeny of a natural P. falciparum cross and thus
can be used to investigate identity by descent in field isolates.
