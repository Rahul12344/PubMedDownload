Malaria, a major global health challenge worldwide, is accompanied by a severe
anemia secondary to hemolysis and increased erythrophagocytosis. Iron is an
essential functional component of erythrocyte hemoglobin and its availability is 
controlled by the liver-derived hormone hepcidin. We examined the regulation of
hepcidin during malarial infection in mice using the rodent parasite Plasmodium
berghei K173. Mice infected with Plasmodium berghei K173 develop a severe anemia 
and die after 18 to 22 days without cerebral malaria. During the early phase of
blood-stage infection (days 1 to 5), a strong inflammatory signature was
associated with an increased production of hepcidin. Between days 7 and 18, while
infection progressed, red blood cell count, hemoglobin and hematocrit
dramatically decreased. In the late phase of malarial infection, hepcidin
production was reduced concomitantly to an increase in the messenger RNA
expression of the hepcidin suppressor erythroferrone in the bone marrow and the
spleen. Compared with wild-type mice, Erfe-/- mice failed to adequately suppress 
hepcidin expression after infection with Plasmodium berghei K173. Importantly,
the sustained production of hepcidin allowed by erythroferrone ablation was
associated with decreased parasitemia, providing further evidence that transient 
iron restriction could be beneficial in the treatment of malaria.
