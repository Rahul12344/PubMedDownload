responses in Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Kilifi, Kenya.

The mechanisms of drug resistance development in the Plasmodium falciparum
parasite to lumefantrine (LUM), commonly used in combination with artemisinin,
are still unclear. We assessed the polymorphisms of Pfmspdbl2 for associations
with LUM activity in a Kenyan population. MSPDBL2 codon 591S was associated with 
reduced susceptibility to LUM (P = 0.04). The high frequency of Pfmspdbl2 codon
591S in Kenya may be driven by the widespread use of lumefantrine in artemisinin 
combination therapy (Coartem).
