The 28S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced from P. falciparum and P. vivax
isolates collected from northwest India. Based upon the sequence diversity of the
Plasmodium 28SrRNA gene in comparison with its human counterpart, various nested 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were designed from the 3R region of the
28SrRNA gene and evaluated on field isolates. This is the first report
demonstrating the utility of this gene for species-specific diagnosis of malaria 
for these two species, prevalent in India. The initial evaluation on 363 clinical
isolates indicated that, in comparison with microscopy, which showed sensitivity 
and specificity of 85·39% and 100% respectively, the sensitivity and specificity 
of the nested PCR assay was found to be 99·08% and 100% respectively. This assay 
was also successful in detecting mixed infections that are undetected by
microscopy. Our results demonstrate the utility of the 28S rRNA gene as a
diagnostic target for the detection of the major plasmodial species infecting
humans.
