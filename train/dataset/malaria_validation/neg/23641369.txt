BACKGROUND: Characterization of Plasmodium falciparum diversity is commonly
achieved by amplification of the polymorphic regions of the merozoite surface
proteins 1 (MSP1) and 2 (MSP2) genes.
AIMS: The present study aimed to determine the allelic variants distribution of
MSP1 and MSP2 and multiplicity of infection in P. falciparum field isolates from 
Kosti, central Sudan, an area characterized by seasonal malaria transmission.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total 121 samples (N = 121) were collected during a
cross-sectional survey between March and April 2003. DNA was extracted and MSP1
and MSP2 polymorphic loci were genotyped.
RESULTS: The total number of alleles identified in MSP1 block 2 was 11, while 16 
alleles were observed in MSP2 block 3. In MSP1, RO33 was found to be the
predominant allelic type, carried alone or in combination with MAD20 and K1
types, whereas FC27 family was the most prevalent in MSP2. Sixty two percent of
isolates had multiple genotypes and the overall mean multiplicity of infection
was 1.93 (CI 95% 1.66-2.20). Age correlated with parasite density (P = 0.017). In
addition, a positive correlation was observed between parasite densities and the 
number of alleles (P = 0.022).
CONCLUSION: Genetic diversity in P. falciparum field isolates in central Sudan
was high and consisted of multiple clones.
