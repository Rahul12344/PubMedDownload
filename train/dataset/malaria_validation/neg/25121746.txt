Clonally variant expression of surface antigens allows the malaria parasite
Plasmodium falciparum to evade immune recognition during blood stage infection
and secure malaria transmission. We demonstrate that heterochromatin protein 1
(HP1), an evolutionary conserved regulator of heritable gene silencing, controls 
expression of numerous P. falciparum virulence genes as well as differentiation
into the sexual forms that transmit to mosquitoes. Conditional depletion of
P. falciparum HP1 (PfHP1) prevents mitotic proliferation of blood stage parasites
and disrupts mutually exclusive expression and antigenic variation of the major
virulence factor PfEMP1. Additionally, PfHP1-dependent regulation of PfAP2-G, a
transcription factor required for gametocyte conversion, controls the switch from
asexual proliferation to sexual differentiation, providing insight into the
epigenetic mechanisms underlying gametocyte commitment. These findings show that 
PfHP1 is centrally involved in clonally variant gene expression and sexual
differentiation in P. falciparum and have major implications for developing
antidisease and transmission-blocking interventions against malaria.
