Plasmodium falciparum is the most prevalent and deadly species of the human
malaria parasites, and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is an enzyme involved in the 
redox response to oxidative stress. Essential for P. falciparum survival, the
enzyme has been highlighted as a promising target for novel antimalarial drugs.
Here we report the discovery and characterization of seven molecules from an
antimalarial set of 13533 compounds through single-target TrxR biochemical
screens. We have produced high-purity, full-length, recombinant native enzyme
from four Plasmodium species, and thioredoxin substrates from P. falciparum and
Rattus norvegicus. The enzymes were screened using a unique, high-throughput, in 
vitro native substrate assay, and we have observed selectivity between the
Plasmodium species and the mammalian form of the enzyme. This has indicated
differences in their biomolecular profiles and has provided valuable insights
into the biochemical mechanisms of action of compounds with proven antimalarial
activity.
