BACKGROUND: The relationship between glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
deficiency and clinical phenomena such as primaquine-sensitivity and protection
from severe malaria remains poorly defined, with past association studies
yielding inconsistent and conflicting results. One possibility is that
examination of a single genetic variant might underestimate the presence of true 
effects in the presence of unrecognized functional allelic diversity.
METHODS: We systematically examined this possibility in Kenya, conducting a
fine-mapping association study of erythrocyte G6PD activity in 1828 Kenyan
children across 30 polymorphisms at or around the G6PD locus.
RESULTS: We demonstrate a strong functional role for c.202G>A (rs1050828), which 
accounts for the majority of variance in enzyme activity observed (P=1.5×10⁻²⁰⁰, 
additive model). Additionally, we identify other common variants that exert
smaller, intercorrelated effects independent of c.202G>A, and haplotype analyses 
suggest that each variant tags one of two haplotype motifs that are opposite in
sequence identity and effect direction. We posit that these effects are of
biological and possible clinical significance, specifically noting that c.376A>G 
(rs1050829) augments 202AG heterozygote risk for deficiency trait by two-fold (OR
= 2.11 [1.12 - 3.84], P=0.014).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that c.202G>A is responsible for the majority of
the observed prevalence of G6PD deficiency trait in Kenya, but also identify a
novel role for c.376A>G as a genetic modifier which marks a common haplotype that
augments the risk conferred to 202AG heterozygotes, suggesting that variation at 
both loci merits consideration in genetic association studies probing G6PD
deficiency-associated clinical phenotypes.
