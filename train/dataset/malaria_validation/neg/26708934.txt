The objective of this article was to investigate the morphological and molecular 
characterization of Oestromyia leporina (Pallas, 1778) from wild plateau pikas
(Ochotona curzoniae) in Qinghai province, China. The third-stage larvae of O.
leporina were examined by scanning electron microscopy revealing morphology
characteristics of the spines on the cephalic, the thoracic segments, the
abdominal segments and the spiracular plates. The coding regions of 25 cytochrome
oxidase I (COI) genes of O. leporina were investigated. Eighty-one variable sites
and 21 haplotypes were identified and the nucleotide and haplotype diversities
were 0.04456 and 0.9767, respectively, indicating a rich genetic diversity in O. 
leporina. Phylogenetic analysis utilizing sequences of COI revealed two distinct 
lineages. These findings revealed ultrastructure and molecular characterization
among the O. leporina from plateau pikas in Qinghai province, China and had
implications for studying morphological identification, molecular epidemiology
and population genetics of O. leporina.
