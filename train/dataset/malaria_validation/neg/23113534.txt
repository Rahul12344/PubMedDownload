BACKGROUND: Prevention of transfusion-transmitted malaria in at-risk children and
pregnant women in endemic areas with inexpensive chloroquine is no longer
effective due to widespread drug resistance. There is an urgent need for devising
new strategies for transfusion malarial safety. We investigated the frequency of 
transfusion transmission of malaria within the Ghanaian blood donation system
using blood donations from 106 asymptomatic adult Ghanaian blood donors.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Paired samples from 106 blood donations and recipients 
(before and after transfusion) were tested for anti-merozoite surface protein-1/2
using the commercial Lab21 malaria enzyme immunoassay (EIA), four
antigen-specific in-house EIAs, and Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) EIA. 
Additionally, Plasmodium DNA was screened for using a species-specific nested
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a Pan-Plasmodium quantitative PCR.
Donor-recipient parasite identity was defined by two concordant genotyping
strategies.
RESULTS: Plasmodium antibody prevalence was 100% in both donors and recipients,
with at least one antigen. Parasitemia prevalence was 54.7% in both donors and
recipients with median levels of 20 and 5.3 copies/μL, respectively, the
difference being correlated to age (p = 0.0001). Multiple species infections were
frequent (8.5%). Twenty-four units of parasitemic blood were transfused to
nonparasitemic recipients, of which 10 (41.7%) became infected after transfusion.
Molecular genotyping with 13 distinct markers (antigenic genes and microsatellite
loci) identified three to nine parasitemic recipients after transfusion with
level of allelic identity suggesting 14% to 28% definite or possible
transfusion-related parasitemia.
CONCLUSION: None of the currently available screening assays appear suitable to
minimize transfusion malaria without compromising the blood supply in endemic
areas.
