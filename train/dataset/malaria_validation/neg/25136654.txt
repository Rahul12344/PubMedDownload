Artemisinin has been used in the production of "artemisinin combination
therapies" for the treatment of malaria. Feeding of precursors has been proven to
be one of the most effective methods to enhance artemisinin production in plant
cultured cells. At the current paper, the biosynthesis of artemisinin (ART) and
its four analogs from dihydroartemisinic acid (DHAA) in suspension-cultured cells
of Artemisia annua were investigated. ARTs were detected by HPLC/GC-MS and
isolated by various chromatography methods. The structures of four DHAA
metabolites, namely, dihydro-epi-deoxyarteannuin B, arteannuin I, arteannuin K,
and 3-Î²-hydroxy-dihydro-epi-deoxyarteannuin B, were elucidated by physicochemical
and spectroscopic analyses. The correlation between gene expression and ART
content was investigated. The results of RT-PCR showed that DHAA could
up-regulate expression of amorpha-4,11-diene synthase gene (ADS),
amorpha-4,11-diene C-12 oxidase gene (CYP71AV1), and farnesyl diphosphate
synthase gene (FPS) (3.19-, 7.21-, and 2.04-fold higher than those of control
group, resp.), which indicated that biosynthesis processes from DHAA to ART were 
enzyme-mediated.
