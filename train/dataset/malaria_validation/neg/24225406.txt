BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum resistance to anti-malarial drugs remains a
major obstacle to the control of malaria. In 2001 Tanzania replaced chloroquine
(CQ) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) as first-line drug, which in turn was
replaced by artemisinin combination therapy in 2006. SP has however, continued to
be used in intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp)
despite reports of high levels of resistance to SP due to the lack of
alternatives to SP for IPTp. Recent reports have indicated recovery of
CQ-susceptibility in Malawi, Kenya, Mozambique, and Tanzania based on the
prevalence of wild types at codon 76 of the Pfcrt gene in indigenous P.
falciparum populations. The current prevalence of this Pfcrt-76 CQ resistance
marker from six regions of Tanzania mainland is hereby reported.
METHODS: DNA extracted from filter-paper dried blood spots and rapid diagnostics 
kit strips collected from finger-prick blood were used to genotype the Pfcrt-76
resistance marker using PCR-RFLP. Data from previously published studies were
used to generate CQ susceptibility recovery trends using logistic regression
model.
RESULTS: Seven hundred and forty one (741) samples were genotyped. The current
frequency of the CQ-susceptible Pfcrt-K76 was above 92% and did not differ
between regions in Tanzania (χ(2) = 2.37; p = 0.795). The K76 allelic prevalence 
was between 85.7 and 93% in regions (χ(2) = 7.88, p = 0.163). The CQ resistance
recovery trends showed regional variability that may be caused by differences in 
malaria transmission intensity, but overall the trends converge as the
susceptibility levels in all regions approach >90%.
CONCLUSIONS: CQ withdrawal in Tanzania has resulted into >90% recovery of
susceptibility in ten years of withdrawal. These findings are in support of the
search for CQ-based combination drugs as a possible future alternative to SP for 
IPTp in places where full recovery of CQ-susceptibility will be evident.
