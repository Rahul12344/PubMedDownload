Background: Mass drug administration (MDA), with or without low-dose primaquine
(PMQLD), is being considered for malaria elimination programs. The potential of
PMQLD to block malaria transmission by mosquitoes must be balanced against
liabilities of its use.
Methods: Artemisinin-piperaquine (AP), with or without PMQLD, was administered in
3 monthly rounds across Anjouan Island, Union of Comoros. Plasmodium falciparum
malaria rates, mortality, parasitemias, adverse events, and PfK13 Kelch-propeller
gene polymorphisms were evaluated.
Results: Coverage of 85 to 93% of the Anjouan population was achieved with AP
plus PMQLD (AP+PMQLD) in 2 districts (population 97164) and with AP alone in 5
districts (224471). Between the months of April-September in both 2012 and 2013, 
average monthly malaria hospital rates per 100000 people fell from 310.8 to 2.06 
in the AP+PMQLD population (ratio 2.06/310.8 = 0.66%; 95% CI: 0.02%, 3.62%; P =
.00007) and from 412.1 to 2.60 in the AP population (ratio 0.63%; 95% CI: 0.11%, 
1.93%; P < .00001). Effectiveness of AP+PMQLD was 0.9908 (95% CI: 0.9053,
0.9991), while effectiveness of AP alone was 0.9913 (95% CI: 0.9657, 0.9978).
Both regimens were well tolerated, without severe adverse events. Analysis of 52 
malaria samples after MDA showed no evidence for selection of PfK13
Kelch-propeller mutations.
Conclusions: Steep reductions of malaria cases were achieved by 3 monthly rounds 
of either AP+PMQLD or AP alone, suggesting potential for highly successful MDA
without PMQLD in epidemiological settings such as those on Anjouan. A major
challenge is to sustain and expand the public health benefits of malaria
reductions by MDA.
