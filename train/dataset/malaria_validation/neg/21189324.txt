It is widely accepted that antibody responses against the human parasitic
pathogen Plasmodium falciparum protect the host from the rigors of severe malaria
and death. However, there is a continuing need for the development of in vitro
correlate assays of immune protection. To this end, the capacity of human
monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies in eliciting phagocytosis and parasite
growth inhibition via Fcγ receptor-dependent mechanisms was explored. In
examining the extent to which sequence diversity in merozoite surface protein 2
(MSP2) results in the evasion of antibody responses, an unexpectedly high level
of heterologous function was measured for allele-specific human antibodies. The
dependence on Fcγ receptors for opsonic phagocytosis and monocyte-mediated
antibody-dependent parasite inhibition was demonstrated by the mutation of the Fc
domain of monoclonal antibodies against both MSP2 and a novel vaccine candidate, 
peptide 27 from the gene PFF0165c. The described flow cytometry-based functional 
assays are expected to be useful for assessing immunity in naturally infected and
vaccinated individuals and for prioritizing among blood-stage antigens for
inclusion in blood-stage vaccines.
