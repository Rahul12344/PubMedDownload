Blood parasites are potential threats to the health of penguins and to their
conservation and management. Little penguins Eudyptula minor are native to
Australia and New Zealand, and are susceptible to piroplasmids (Babesia),
hemosporidians (Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon, Plasmodium) and kinetoplastids
(Trypanosoma). We studied a total of 263 wild little penguins at 20 sites along
the Australian southeastern coast, in addition to 16 captive-bred little
penguins. Babesia sp. was identified in seven wild little penguins, with positive
individuals recorded in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. True prevalence
was estimated between 3.4% and 4.5%. Only round forms of the parasite were
observed, and gene sequencing confirmed the identity of the parasite and
demonstrated it is closely related to Babesia poelea from boobies (Sula spp.) and
B. uriae from murres (Uria aalge). None of the Babesia-positive penguins
presented signs of disease, confirming earlier suggestions that chronic
infections by these parasites are not substantially problematic to otherwise
healthy little penguins. We searched also for kinetoplastids, and despite
targeted sampling of little penguins near the location where Trypanosoma
eudyptulae was originally reported, this parasite was not detected.
