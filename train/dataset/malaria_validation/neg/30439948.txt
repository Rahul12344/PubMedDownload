Malaria parasites remodel their host erythrocytes to gain nutrients and avoid the
immune system. Host erythrocytes are modified by hundreds of effector proteins
exported from the parasite into the host cell. Protein export is mediated by the 
PTEX translocon comprising five core components of which EXP2 is considered to
form the putative pore that spans the vacuole membrane enveloping the parasite
within its erythrocyte. To explore the function and importance of EXP2 for
parasite survival in the asexual blood stage of Plasmodium falciparum we
inducibly knocked down the expression of EXP2. Reduction in EXP2 expression
strongly reduced parasite growth proportional to the degree of protein knockdown 
and tended to stall development about half way through the asexual cell cycle.
Once the knockdown inducer was removed and EXP2 expression restored, parasite
growth recovered dependent upon the length and degree of knockdown. To establish 
EXP2 function and hence the basis for growth reduction, the trafficking of an
exported protein was monitored following EXP2 knockdown. This resulted in severe 
attenuation of protein export and is consistent with EXP2, and PTEX in general,
being the conduit for export of proteins into the host compartment.
