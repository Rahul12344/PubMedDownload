BACKGROUND: Detection of Plasmodium spp. is sometimes inconvenient especially in 
rural areas that are distant from a laboratory. In this study a portable
diagnostic test of Plasmodium spp. was developed using insulated isothermal
polymerase chain reaction (iiPCR) as an alternative approach to improve this
situation.
METHODS: A pair of universal primers and probe were designed to amplify and
detect gene encoding 18S small sub-unit rRNA of Plasmodium spp using iiPCR method
in a portable device, POCKIT™. The efficiency and detection limit of the assay
were evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
approach before being subjected to testing in POCKIT™. Detection results of
POCKIT™ were displayed as '+', '-' or '?' based on the fluorescence ratio
after/before reaction. A total of 55 and 35 samples from malaria patients and
healthy subjects, respectively, were screened to evaluate the feasibility of this
newly designed iiPCR assay.
RESULTS: The iiPCR assay allowed the detection of various species of Plasmodium, 
including those infecting humans (Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. knowlesi,
P. malariae, P. ovale), monkeys, birds, and rodents. Efficiency of the assay
achieved 96.9 % while the lower detection limit was ≥100 copies of plasmodial
DNA. Specificity of the assay was assured as it could not detect human, bacterial
and other parasitic DNA. Among the 55 clinical samples tested, 47 (85.4 %) of
them were detected as positive by POCKIT™. Four (7.3 %) samples with fluorescence
ratio after/before reaction of <1.2 were reported as negative while another four 
(7.3 %) were ambiguously detected as they had fluorescence ratios between 1.2 and
1.3. The fluorescence ratio was not found to be associated with the copy number
of plasmodial DNA. This approach can only be considered as a qualitative method.
CONCLUSIONS: The portable iiPCR system may serve as an alternative approach for
preliminary screening of malaria in endemic rural areas. The system may also be
useful for detecting animal malaria in the field. Although it is not as
quantitative as qPCR method, it is comparatively fast and easy to handle. It is
believed that the POCKIT-iiPCR assay is able to achieve 100 % sensitivity if
increased amount of DNA from each sample is used. The iiPCR assay can also be
upgraded in future to detect multiple Plasmodium spp. at the same time by
designing the specific primers and probes.
