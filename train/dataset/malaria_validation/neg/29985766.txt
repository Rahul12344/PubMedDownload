INTRODUCTION: Piroplasms are hemoprotozoa comprising heterogeneous tick-borne
parasites, which are differentiated into three genera, namely Babesia, Theileria,
and Cytauxzoon. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, molecular 
identification, and phylogenetic relationship of both Theileria spp. and Babesia 
spp. in tick species isolated from different domestic animals from two different 
geographical locations of Iran.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 930 ticks collected from goats, sheep, and
cattle were examined for the presence of Theileria spp. and Babesia spp. using
PCR targeting 18S rRNA gene followed by sequencing. Sequence analysis was
performed based on the data published in the GenBank on Theileria spp. and
Babesia spp. isolates using bioinformatic tools, such as the standard nucleotide 
BLAST.
RESULTS: A 390 or 430 base pair fragment of 18S rRNA gene of Theileria and
Babesia species was successfully amplified in 17.2% of the examined ticks (16of
93). Genome of Theileria or Babesia species was detected in 4 ticks collected in 
Heris, including 3 Dermacentor marginatus and 1 Rhipicephalus sanguineus, and
also in 12 ticks collected in Chabahar, including 10 R. sanguineus and 2 D.
marginatus. Partial analysis of 18S rRNA gene sequence of the four D. marginatus,
collected from goats and sheep in Heris, showed that they were infected with
Theileria spp. that were 95-97% identical to Iranian Theileria ovis present in
the GenBank database (GenBank acc. no. KP019206.1). While the five R. sanguineus,
collected from sheep and goats in Chabahar, were infected with Babesia spp. that 
were 91-97% identical to Iranian Babesia ovis present in the GenBank database
(GenBank acc. no. AY362829.1: KT587794.1).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of Babesia and Theileria is different in southeastern 
and northwestern parts of Iran, with higher prevalence of babesiosis in the
southeastern region and that of theileriosis in the northwestern region. Sequence
analysis of 18S rRNA gene revealed that T. ovis and B. ovis are genetically
polymorphic in these regions.
