The South Pacific countries Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Papua New Guinea (PNG) 
adopted artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) in 2008. We examined Kelch
13 and Kelch 12 genes in parasites originating from these countries before or at 
ACT introduction. Four Kelch 13 and two Kelch 12 novel sequence polymorphisms,
not associated with artemisinin resistance, were observed in parasites from
Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. No polymorphisms were observed in PNG parasites. The
findings provide useful baseline information.
