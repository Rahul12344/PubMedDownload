Plasmodium parasites express a potent inhibitor of cysteine proteases (ICP)
throughout their life cycle. To analyze the role of ICP in different life cycle
stages, we generated a stage-specific knockout of the Plasmodium berghei ICP
(PbICP). Excision of the pbicb gene occurred in infective sporozoites and
resulted in impaired sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes, despite residual PbICP
protein being detectable in sporozoites. The vast majority of these parasites
invading a cultured hepatocyte cell line did not develop to mature liver stages, 
but the few that successfully developed hepatic merozoites were able to initiate 
a blood stage infection in mice. These blood stage parasites, now completely
lacking PbICP, exhibited an attenuated phenotype but were able to infect
mosquitoes and develop to the oocyst stage. However, PbICP-negative sporozoites
liberated from oocysts exhibited defective motility and invaded mosquito salivary
glands in low numbers. They were also unable to invade hepatocytes, confirming
that control of cysteine protease activity is of critical importance for
sporozoites. Importantly, transfection of PbICP-knockout parasites with a
pbicp-gfp construct fully reversed these defects. Taken together, in P. berghei
this inhibitor of the ICP family is essential for sporozoite motility but also
appears to play a role during parasite development in hepatocytes and
erythrocytes.
