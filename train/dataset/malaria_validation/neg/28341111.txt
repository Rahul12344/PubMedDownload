Plasmodium vivax is the most widely distributed malaria species and the most
prevalent species of malaria in America and Asia. Vaccine development against P. 
vivax is considered a priority in the global program for the eradication of
malaria. Earlier studies have characterized the Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA-1)
ectodomain and the C-terminal region (19kDa) of the Merozoite Surface Protein 1
(MSP-1) of P. vivax as immunodominant antigens. Based on this characterization,
we designed a chimeric recombinant protein containing both merozoite
immunodominant domains (PvAMA166-MSP119). The recombinant PvAMA166-MSP119 was
successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris and used to immunize two different
mouse strains (BALB/c and C57BL/6) in the presence of the Poly (I:C) as an
adjuvant. Immunization with the chimeric protein induced high antibody titers
against both proteins in both strains of mice as detected by ELISA. Antisera also
recognized the native proteins expressed on the merozoites of mature P. vivax
schizonts. Moreover, this antigen was able to induce IFN-gamma-secreting cells in
C57BL/6 mice. These findings indicate that this novel yeast recombinant protein
containing PvAMA166 and PvMSP119 is advantageous, because of improved antibody
titers and cellular immune response. Therefore, this formulation should be
further developed for pre-clinical trials in non-human primates as a potential
candidate for a P. vivax vaccine.
