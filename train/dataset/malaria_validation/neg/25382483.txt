We validated the feasibility of using Plasmodium falciparum, the human malaria
parasite, DNA present in wild caught vector mosquitoes for the characterization
of chloroquine resistance status. House frequenting mosquitoes belonging to
Anopheles minimus complex were collected from human dwellings in a malaria
endemic area of Assam, Northeast India and DNA was extracted from the head-thorax
region of individual mosquitoes. Anopheles minimus complex mosquitoes were
identified to species level and screened for the presence of Plasmodium sp. using
molecular tools. Nested PCR-RFLP method was used for genotyping of P. falciparum 
based on K76T mutation in the chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene.
Three of the 27 wild caught An. minimus mosquitoes were harbouring P. falciparum 
sporozoites (positivity 11.1%) and all 3 were had 76T mutation in the pfcrt gene,
indicating chloroquine resistance. The approach of characterizing antimalarial
resistance of malaria parasite in vector mosquitoes can potentially be used as a 
surveillance tool for monitoring transmission of antimalarial drug resistant
parasite strains in the community.
