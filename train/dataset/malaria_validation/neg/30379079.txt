New glycosylated 26-membered triene macrolides catenulisporolides, the first
polyketide metabolites from Catenulispora species, were obtained by targeting
slow-forming colonies on selection agar plates and applying long-term
cultivation. Their structures, including the full stereochemistry, were defined
by comprehensive spectroscopic and chemical methods and confirmed by
bioinformatics analysis. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed the responsible
biosynthetic gene cluster spanning âˆ¼160 kbp, and feeding experiments with
isotope-labeled precursors showed that isovaleric acid acts as a rare starter
unit. Catenulisporolides exhibited antimalarial activities against resistant
strains of Plasmodium falciparum, and enhanced activity was observed in
semisynthetic derivatives.
