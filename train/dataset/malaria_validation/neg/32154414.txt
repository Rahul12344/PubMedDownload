Introduction: Plasmodium falciparum relies on gametocytogenesis to transmit from 
humans to mosquitoes. Gametocyte development 1 (Pfgdv1) is an upstream activator 
and epigenetic controller of gametocytogenesis. The emergence of drug resistance 
is a major public health concern and this requires the development of new
strategies that target the transmission of malaria. As a putative drug target,
Pfgdv1 has not been characterized to identify its polymorphisms and alleles under
selection and how such polymorphisms influence protein structure.
Methods: This study characterized single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
primary sequences (n = 30) of Pfgdv1 gene generated from thirty blood samples
collected from patients infected with P. falciparum and secondary sequences (n = 
216) retrieved from PlasmoDB. ChromasPro, MUSCLE, Tajima's D statistic, SLAC, and
STRUM were used in editing raw sequences, performing multiple sequence alignment 
(MSA), identifying signatures of selection, detecting codon sites under selection
pressure, and determining the effect of SNPs, respectively.
Results: MSA of primary and secondary sequences established the existence of five
SNPs, consisting of four non-synonymous substitutions (nsSNPs) (p.P217H, p.R398Q,
p.H417N, and p.D497E), and a synonymous substitution (p.S514S). The analysis of
amino acid changes reveals that p.P217H, p.R398Q, and p.H417N comprise
non-conservative changes. Tajima's D statistic showed that these SNPs were under 
balancing selection, while SLAC analysis identified p.P217H to be under the
strongest positive selection. . Further analysis based on thermodynamics
indicated that p.P217H has a destabilizing effect, while p.R398Q and p.D497E have
stabilizing effects on the protein structure.
Conclusions: The existence of four nsSNPs implies that Pfgdv1 has a minimal
diversity in the encoded protein. Selection analysis demonstrates that these
nsSNPs are under balancing selection in both local and global populations.
However, p.P217H exhibits positive directional selection consistent with previous
reports where it showed differentiatial selection of P. falciparum in low and
high transmission regions. Therefore, in-silico prediction and experimental
determination of protein structure are necessary to evaluate Pfgdv1 as a target
candidate for drug design and development.
