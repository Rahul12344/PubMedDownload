BACKGROUND: Maternal malarial infection leads to poor perinatal outcomes,
including low birth weight from preterm delivery and/or fetal growth restriction,
particularly in primigravidas. In placental malaria, Plasmodium
falciparum-infected red blood cells cause an inflammatory response that can
interfere with maternal-fetal exchange, leading to poor growth. The type I
interferon (IFN-I) pathway plays an immunomodulatory role in viral and bacterial 
infections, usually by suppressing inflammatory responses. However, its role in
placental malaria is unknown. This study examines the cytokine responses in
placental tissue from subsets of malaria-infected and uninfected women, and
attempts to correlate them with particular birth outcomes.
METHODS: 40 whole placental biopsy samples were obtained from pregnant women at
least 16 years of age recruited to a larger prospective chemoprevention trial
against malaria. These were patients at Tororo District Hospital in Uganda, an
area of high malaria endemicity where approximately 40% of women have evidence of
malaria infection at delivery. They were regularly followed at a local clinic and
monitored for fever, with blood smears performed then and at time of delivery to 
diagnose malaria infection. Placenta biopsies were taken for histological
diagnosis of placental malaria, as well as quantitative PCR analysis of genes in 
the IFN-I pathway (IFN-β, IL-10 and MX-1). Parameters such as infant birth weight
and gestational age were also recorded.
RESULTS: Histological analysis revealed placental malaria in 18 samples, while 22
were found to be uninfected. RT-PCR analysis showed a four-fold increase in IFN-β
and IL-10 expression in multigravidas with placental malaria when compared to
gravidity-matched, uninfected controls. This effect was not observed in
primigravidas. Interestingly, linear regression analysis showed a positive
association between IFN-β levels and higher birth weights (β = 101.2 g per
log2-fold increase in IFN-β expression, p = 0.042). This association was
strongest in primigravidas with placental malaria (β = 339.0, p = 0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate differential regulation of the IFN-I
pathway in placental malaria according to gravidity, with the greatest
anti-inflammatory response seen in multigravidas. The association between IFN-β
levels and higher birth weight also suggests a protective role for IFN-I against 
fetal growth restriction in placental malaria.
