BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the major complications of
Plasmodium falciparum malaria, especially among non-immune adults. It has
recently been revealed that activation of transcription factor nuclear factor
kappa B (NF-κB) induces pro-inflammatory gene expression involved in the
development of progressive renal inflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was
to determine whether urinary sediment NF-κB p65 can act as a biomarker for AKI in
patients with P. falciparum malaria.
METHODS: Urinary sediments from malaria patients, including Plasmodium vivax
malaria, uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, complicated P. falciparum malaria
without AKI (serum creatinine-Cr <3 mg/dl) and complicated P. falciparum malaria 
with AKI (Cr ≥3 mg/dl) were used to determine NF-κB p65 level by sandwich
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Urinary sediments obtained from
healthy controls were used as a normal baseline. Correlations between levels of
urinary sediment NF-κB p65 and pertinent clinical data were analysed.
RESULTS: Urinary sediment NF-κB p65 levels were significantly increased on the
day of admission (day 0) and on day 7 post-treatment in complicated P. falciparum
malaria patients with AKI, compared with those without AKI (p=0.001, p <0.001,
respectively), P. vivax patients (all p <0.001) and healthy controls (all p
<0.001). NF-κB p65 levels in urinary sediment cells showed a significant positive
correlation with serum Cr (Day 0: rs=0.792; p <0.001, Day 7: rs=0.605; p <0.001) 
and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (Day 0: rs=0.839; p <0.001, Day 7: rs=0.596; p
<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary sediment NF-κB p65 level is a useful indicator for
estimating renal tubular epithelial cell damage and subsequent development of AKI
among patients with P. falciparum malaria.
