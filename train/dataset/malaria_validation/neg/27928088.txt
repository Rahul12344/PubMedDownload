Babesiosis is an emerging tick-borne disease caused by apicomplexan parasites of 
the genus Babesia Most human infections in the United States are caused by
Babesia microti, but other infection-causing Babesia parasites have been
documented as well. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods can be used to 
identify this parasite to the species level. In this study, published real-time
PCR assays for the specific detection of B. microti were evaluated against
conventional PCR for their analytical performance. All evaluated real-time PCR
assays had comparable dynamic range and amplification efficiency, but the
sensitivity and specificity varied. The best performing test, a TaqMan assay
targeting the 18S ribosomal RNA gene, was further evaluated for diagnostic
performance using blood specimens submitted to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention for parasite detection and was found to have 100% sensitivity and 
specificity. In conclusion, the 18S TaqMan real-time PCR assay is a sensitive,
specific, and rapid method for identification of B. microti among cases of
babesiosis in the United States.
