In order to characterize the demographic traits and spatial structure of
Cameroonians Bulinus globosus, intermediate host of Schistosoma haematobium,
genetic structure of seven different populations, collected from the tropical
zone, was studied using six polymorphic microsatellites. Intrapopulation genetic 
diversity ranged from 0.37 to 0.55. Interpopulation genetic diversity variation
clearly illustrated their significant isolation due to distance with gene flow
substantially limited to neighbouring populations. The effective population sizes
(Ne) were relatively low (from 3.0 to 18.6), which supposes a high rate from
which populations would lose their genetic diversity by drift. Analysis of
genetic temporal variability indicated fluctuations of allelic frequencies (35 of
42 locus-population combinations, P<0.05) characteristic of stochastic
demography, and this is reinforced by events of bottlenecks detected in all
populations. These findings demonstrated that Cameroonian B. globosus were
mixed-maters with some populations showing clear preference for outcrossing.
These data also suggest that genetic drift and gene flow are the main factors
shaping the genetic structure of studied populations.
