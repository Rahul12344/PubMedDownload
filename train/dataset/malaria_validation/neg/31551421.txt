Transmission-blocking vaccines have the potential to be key contributors to
malaria elimination. Such vaccines elicit antibodies that inhibit parasites
during their development in Anopheles mosquitoes, thus breaking the cycle of
transmission. To date, characterization of humoral responses to Plasmodium
falciparum transmission-blocking vaccine candidate Pfs25 has largely been
conducted in pre-clinical models. Here, we present molecular analyses of human
antibody responses generated in a clinical trial evaluating Pfs25 vaccination.
From a collection of monoclonal antibodies with transmission-blocking activity,
we identify the most potent transmission-blocking antibody yet described against 
Pfs25; 2544. The interactions of 2544 and three other antibodies with Pfs25 are
analyzed by crystallography to understand structural requirements for elicitation
of human transmission-blocking responses. Our analyses provide insights into
Pfs25 immunogenicity and epitope potency, and detail an affinity maturation
pathway for a potent transmission-blocking antibody in humans. Our findings can
be employed to guide the design of improved malaria transmission-blocking
vaccines.
