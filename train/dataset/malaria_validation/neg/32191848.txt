The mitochondrion in parasitic protozoans is a clinically proven drug target. A
specialized ribosome (mitoribosome) is required to translate genes encoded on the
mitochondrial (mt) DNA. Despite the significance, little is known about
mitoribosomes in many medically and economically important unicellular
protozoans.
