OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum in
residual transmission foci of northern India.
METHODS: Clinically suspected patients with malaria were screened for malaria
infection by microscopy. 48 P. falciparum-infected patients were enrolled from
tertiary care hospital in Chandigarh, India. Blood samples were collected from
enrolled patients, genomic DNA extraction and nested PCR was performed for
further species confirmation. Sanger sequencing was carried out using block 2
region of msp1, R2 region of glurp and pfs25-specific primers.
RESULTS: Extensive diversity was found in msp1 alleles with predominantly RO33
alleles. Overall allelic prevalence was 55.8% for RO33, 39.5% for MAD20 and 4.7% 
for K1. Six variants were observed in MAD20, whereas no variant was found in RO33
and K1 alleles. A phylogenetic analysis of RO33 alleles indicated more similarity
to South African isolates, whereas MAD20 alleles showed similarity with
South-East Asian isolates. In glurp, extensive variation was observed with eleven
different alleles based on the AAU repeats. However, pfs25 showed less diversity 
and was the most stable among the targeted genes.
CONCLUSION: Our findings document the genetic diversity among circulating strains
of P. falciparum in an area of India with low malaria transmission and could have
implications for control strategies to reach the national goal of malaria
elimination.
