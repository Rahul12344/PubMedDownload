BACKGROUND: Acute malarial anemia remains a major public health problem.
Hepcidin, the major hormone controlling the availability of iron, is raised
during acute and asymptomatic parasitemia. Understanding the role and mechanism
of raised hepcidin and so reduced iron availability during infection is critical 
to establish evidence-based guidelines for management of malaria anemia. Our
recent clinical evidence suggests a potential role of IL-10 in the regulation of 
hepcidin in patients with acute P. falciparum malaria.
METHODS: We have measured secretion of hepcidin by primary macrophages and the
hepatoma cell line HepG2 stimulated with IL-10, IL-6 and Plasmodium
falciparum-infected erythrocytes.
FINDINGS: We have observed that IL-10 and IL-6 production increased in primary
macrophages when these cells were co-cultured with Plasmodium falciparum-infected
erythrocytes. We found that IL-10 induced hepcidin secretion in primary
macrophages in a dose-dependent manner but not in HepG2 cells. These effects were
mediated through signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
3-phosphorylation and completely abrogated by a specific STAT3 inhibitor.
CONCLUSION: IL-10 can directly regulate hepcidin in primary macrophages but not
in HepG2 cells. This effect can be modulated by Plasmodium falciparum. The
results are consistent with a role for IL-10 in modulating iron metabolism during
acute phase of infection.
