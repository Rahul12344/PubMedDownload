BACKGROUND: Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a subset of T cells that play an
important role in modulating T effector responses during infectious challenges.
The aim of this study was to evaluate possible associations between regulatory
gene polymorphisms and the risk of uncomplicated malaria and the control of
Plasmodium falciparum parasite density levels.
METHODS: Twelve regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter
regions of FOXP3 (ss270137548, rs11091253), IL10RA (rs56356146, rs7925112),
IL10RB (rs8178433, rs8178435, rs999788), STAT6 (rs3024941, rs3024943, rs3024944) 
and TNFRSF18 (ss2080581728, rs3753344) were genotyped in a cohort of Congolese
children. Studied subjects were followed up (passively) during one year. The
children who experienced one or several clinical episodes were genotyped as
"uncomplicated malaria" group (n=179) and those children who did not experience
any episode were genotyped as "asymptomatic children" group (n=138).
RESULTS: The prevalence of rs3024944CC genotype of STAT6 was significantly higher
in the group of asymptomatic children compared to that of uncomplicated malaria
(P=0.003). Similarly, the minor allele rs3024944C was more prevalent in the group
of asymptomatic children (P=0.019). Two novel SNPs were observed including
-163T/G (ss491228441) in IL10RA gene and -163C/T (ss491228440) in TNFRSF18 gene. 
The genotype ss491228441TT and the minor allele ss491228441G of the IL10RA were
more frequent in the group of asymptomatic children (P=0.006 and P=0.007,
respectively). The genotype rs11091253CT of the FOXP3 was associated with high
parasite density levels. In addition, a new promoter IL10RA variant (ss491228441)
contributes to shield against mild malaria.
CONCLUSION: The study indicated that the STAT6 promoter polymorphism rs3024944
was associated with uncomplicated malaria, whereas the FOXP3 promoter variant
rs11091253 was associated with significant P. falciparum parasitaemia levels.
These genetic data may contribute to the understanding of molecular mechanisms
that regulate immune response to P. falciparum infections.
