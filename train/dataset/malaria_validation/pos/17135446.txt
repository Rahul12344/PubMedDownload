Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize malaria parasites or their metabolites;
however, their physiological roles in malaria infection in vivo are not fully
understood. Here, we show that myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88
(MyD88)-dependent TLR signaling mediates brain pathogenesis of severe malaria
infection, namely cerebral malaria (CM). A significant number of MyD88-, but not 
TIR domain containing adaptor-inducing IFN-beta (TRIF)-deficient or wild-type
(WT) mice survived CM caused by Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection. Although
systemic parasitemia was comparable, sequestration of parasite and hemozoin load 
in the brain blood vessels was significantly lower in MyD88-deficient mice
compared with those in TRIF-deficient or WT mice. Moreover, brain-specific
pathological changes were associated with MyD88-dependent infiltration of CD8+,
CCR5+ T cells and CD11c+ dendritic cells, including CD11c+, NK1.1+ and B220+
cells, and up-regulation of genes such as Granzyme B, Lipocalin 2, Ccl3 and Ccr5.
Further studies using mice lacking various TLRs suggest that TLR2 and TLR9, but
not TLR4, 5 and 7, were involved in CM. These results strongly suggest that TLR2-
and/or TLR9-mediated, MyD88-dependent brain pathogenesis may play a critical role
in CM, the lethal complication during PbA infection.
