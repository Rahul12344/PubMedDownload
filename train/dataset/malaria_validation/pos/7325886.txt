Changes in conglutinin, immunoconglutinin, complement C3 and fibronectin
concentrations in cattle acutely infected with Babesia bovis.

Goodger BV, Wright IG, Mahoney DF.

Further pathophysiological studies of the hypotensive shock syndrome associated
with acute Babesia bovis infection in cattle have demonstrated changes in the
plasma concentrations of conglutinin, complement C3, fibronectin and
immunoconglutinin. Decreases in the first three components are presumably due to 
their contribution towards intravascular sludging of infected erythrocytes within
the microvascular system during the acute phase of infection. In contrast, the
increase in fibronectin and immunoconglutinin in the recovery phase suggests the 
involvement of these proteins in the reticulo-endothelial clearance of infected
or damaged erythrocytes, immune complexes and cryofibrinogen.
