Hepatic low density lipoprotein receptor binding and lipid profile in Mastomys
natalensis during Plasmodium berghei infection.

Singh V, Chander R, Kapoor NK.

Plasmodium berghei infection to Mastomys natalensis showed hyper
beta-lipoproteinemia. The increase in serum cholesterol is associated with
decreased uptake of low density lipoprotein (LDL) by the liver through receptor
mediated endocytosis. The membranes prepared from infected M. natalensis exhibit 
up to 50% decline in high affinity binding sites for human 125I-LDL. Significant 
increases in serum lipids, cholesterol, triglyceride and lipid peroxide (LPO)
contents of liver membrane were observed. Effects of lipid constituents and LPO
content of liver membrane in relation to LDL catabolism and other possible
mechanisms have been explained.
