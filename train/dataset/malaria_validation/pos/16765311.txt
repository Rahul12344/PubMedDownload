We examined the role of osteopontin (OPN) in immunity against Plasmodium
falciparum infection. We measured the mRNA levels for OPN and several cytokines
in RNA preparations extracted from dried blood on filter paper obtained from
falciparum malaria patients in Vietnam. Expression of OPN mRNA was detected in
134 of 161 patients. The expression of both interleukin-12 p40 and
interferon-gamma mRNAs in the group positive for OPN mRNA was significantly
higher than that in the group negative for OPN mRNA. The level of parasitemia in 
the OPN mRNA-positive group was much lower than that in the negative one. These
results suggest that OPN might suppress multiplication of the parasites through T
helper 1 cells-mediated immune responses.
