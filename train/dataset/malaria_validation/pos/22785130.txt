This study was carried out to ascertain the changes in acute phase proteins
(APPs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines in Theileria annulata infected water
buffalo. Thirty infected water buffaloes and 20 parasitologically free were used.
In the present study there was significant (P ≤ 0.05) increase in haptoglobin
(Hp), serum amyloid A (SAA), ceruloplasmin, α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and
fibrinogen levels (2.18 ± 0.29 g/l, 156.58 ± 3.48 mg/l, 31.23 ± 1.25mg/dl, 370.23
± 33.21 mg/l and 16.17 ± 1.18 g/l, respectively) in T. annulata infected water
buffaloes when compared to healthy ones (0.13 ± 0.01 g/l, 23.9 ± 0.56 mg/l, 21.23
± 1.21 mg/dl, 240.53 ± 22.45 mg/l and 4.2 ± 0.1 6g/l, respectively). Moreover,
there was significant (P ≤ 0.05) increase in the levels of TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-6,
IL-12, IL-1β and IFN-γ (2.55 ± 0.12 ng/ml, 98.32 ± 4.21 pg/ml, 152.32 ± 5.62
pg/ml, 26.44 ± 1.43 ng/ml, 240.33 ± 20.45 pg/ml and 123.65 ± 5.67 pg/ml,
respectively) in T. annulata infected water buffaloes when compared to healthy
ones (0.42 ± 0.04 ng/ml, 55.32 ± 3.21 pg/ml, 88.23 ± 3.21 pg/ml, 7.45 ± 0.67
ng/ml, 98.33 ± 3.45 pg/ml and 34.76 ± 1.56 pg/ml, respectively). There was also
significant decrease (P ≤ 0.05) in the Hb content, PCV%, RBCs and WBCs counts in 
the diseased water buffaloes compared to the control ones. Neutropenia,
eosinopenia, lymphopenia, monocytopenia and thrombocytopenia were also recorded. 
The biochemical changes revealed significant (P ≤ 0.05) elevation in the levels
of AST, ALT, ALP, LDL-c, VLDL-c, BHBA and NEFA, with significant (P ≤ 0.05)
decrease in the levels of total proteins, albumin, globulins, cholesterol,
triglyceride, glucose, G6PD, calcium and phosphorus in T. annulata infected water
buffaloes when compared to healthy ones. It could be concluded that APPs and
pro-inflammatory cytokines could be used as a valuable biomarkers in T. annulata 
infected water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis).
