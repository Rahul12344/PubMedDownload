BACKGROUND: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an enzyme that plays an
important role in many cellular functions. Deficiency of this enzyme results from
point mutations in the coding region of the G6PD gene. G6PD-deficiency is
important in malaria, as certain anti-malarial drugs could induce haemolysis in
such patients and mutations in this gene may influence the susceptibility or
resistance to the disease. Detailed information on genetic variations in the G6PD
gene for Sri Lankan populations is yet to be revealed. This study describes a set
of G6PD mutations present in a Sri Lankan population and their association with
uncomplicated malaria.
METHODS: DNA was extracted from 1,051 individuals. Sixty-eight SNPs in the region
of the G6PD gene were genotyped. A database created during the 1992-1993 malaria 
epidemic for the same individuals was used to assess the associations between the
G6PD SNPs and parasite density or disease severity of uncomplicated malaria
infections. Linkage disequilibrium for SNPs and haplotype structures were
identified.
RESULTS: Seventeen genetic variants were polymorphic in this population. The
mutant allele was the major allele in 9 SNPs. Common G6PD variants already
described in Asians or South-Asians seemed to be absent or rare in this
population. Both the severity of disease in uncomplicated malaria infections and 
parasitaemia were significantly lower in males infected with Plasmodium
falciparum carrying the ancestral allele of rs915942 compared to those carrying
the mutant allele. The parasite density of males infected with P. falciparum was 
significantly lower also in those who possessed the mutant alleles of rs5986877, 
rs7879049 and rs7053878. Two haplotype blocks were identified, where the
recombination rates were higher in males with no history of malaria when compared
to those who have experienced the disease in the past.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the most detailed survey of G6PD SNPs in a Sri Lankan
population undertaken so far that enabled novel description of single nucleotide 
polymorphisms within the G6PD gene. A few of these genetic variations identified,
demonstrated a tendency to be associated with either disease severity or parasite
density in uncomplicated disease in males. Known G6PD gene polymorphisms already 
described from elsewhere were either absent or rare in the local study
population.
