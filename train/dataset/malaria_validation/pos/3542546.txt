Plasmodium falciparum: inhibition in vitro with lactoferrin,
desferriferrithiocin, and desferricrocin.

Fritsch G, Sawatzki G, Treumer J, Jung A, Spira DT.

The microbial iron chelators desferriferrithiocin and desferricrocin as well as
human lactoferrin were tested in vitro against Plasmodium falciparum. The
microbial chelators inhibit the growth of P. falciparum in a dose dependent way. 
Parasite multiplication is stopped at 25-30 microM desferriferrithiocin, whereas 
60-90 microM desferricrocin are needed to exhibit the same effect. After iron
saturation, the microbial chelators are ineffective. Human lactoferrin (30
microM), both iron free and iron saturated, inhibits P. falciparum. A 3-day
preincubation of host erythrocytes with iron free and iron saturated lactoferrin 
prior to infection enhances this effect, which is therefore attributed to
lactoferrin bound iron. It has been suggested that the lactoferrin/iron complex
generates oxygen free radicals, which may cause membrane damage of both
erythrocyte and parasite. This process can be considered to lead to growth
inhibition of the parasite.
