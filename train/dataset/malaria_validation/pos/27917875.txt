Cerebral malaria (CM) is a severe complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection
responsible for thousands of deaths in children in sub-Saharan Africa. CM
pathogenesis remains incompletely understood but a number of effectors have been 
proposed, including plasma microparticles (MP). MP numbers are increased in CM
patients' circulation and, in the mouse model, they can be localised within
inflamed vessels, suggesting their involvement in vascular damage. In the present
work we define, for the first time, the protein cargo of MP during experimental
cerebral malaria (ECM) with the overarching hypothesis that this characterisation
could help understand CM pathogenesis. Using qualitative and quantitative
high-throughput proteomics we compared MP proteins from non-infected and P.
berghei ANKA-infected mice. More than 360 proteins were identified, 60 of which
were differentially abundant, as determined by quantitative comparison using
TMTTM isobaric labelling. Network analyses showed that ECM MP carry proteins
implicated in molecular mechanisms relevant to CM pathogenesis, including
endothelial activation. Among these proteins, the strict association of carbonic 
anhydrase I and S100A8 with ECM was verified by western blot on MP from DBA/1 and
C57BL/6 mice. These results demonstrate that MP protein cargo represents a novel 
ECM pathogenic trait to consider in the understanding of CM pathogenesis.
