Parasites have evolved a plethora of mechanisms to ensure their propagation and
evade antagonistic host responses. The intracellular protozoan parasite Theileria
is the only eukaryote known to induce uncontrolled host cell proliferation.
Survival of Theileria-transformed leukocytes depends strictly on constitutive
nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activity. We found that this was mediated by
recruitment of the multisubunit IkappaB kinase (IKK) into large, activated foci
on the parasite surface. IKK signalosome assembly was specific for the
transforming schizont stage of the parasite and was down-regulated upon
differentiation into the nontransforming merozoite stage. Our findings provide
insights into IKK activation and how pathogens subvert host-cell signaling
pathways.
