The first, obligatory replication phase of malaria parasite infections is
characterized by rapid expansion and differentiation of single parasites in liver
cells, resulting in the formation and release of thousands of invasive merozoites
into the bloodstream. Hepatic Plasmodium development occurs inside a specialized 
membranous compartment termed the parasitophorous vacuole (PV). Here, we show
that, during the parasite's hepatic replication, the C-terminal region of the
parasitic PV membrane protein exported protein 1 (EXP-1) binds to host
Apolipoprotein H (ApoH) and that this molecular interaction plays a pivotal role 
for successful Plasmodium liver-stage development. Expression of a truncated
EXP-1 protein, missing the specific ApoH interaction site, or down-regulation of 
ApoH expression in either hepatic cells or mouse livers by RNA interference
resulted in impaired intrahepatic development. Furthermore, infection of mice
with sporozoites expressing a truncated version of EXP-1 resulted in both a
significant reduction of liver burden and delayed blood-stage patency, leading to
a disease outcome different from that generally induced by infection with
wild-type parasites. This study identifies a host-parasite protein interaction
during the hepatic stage of infection by Plasmodium parasites. The identification
of such vital interactions may hold potential toward the development of novel
malaria prevention strategies.
