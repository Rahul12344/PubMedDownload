Cerebral malaria (CM) is an acute, generally lethal condition characterized by
high fever, seizures and coma. The genetic component to CM can be investigated in
mouse models that vary in degree of susceptibility to infection with Plasmodium
berghei ANKA. Using survival time to measure susceptibility in an informative F2 
cross (n=257), we identified linkage to chromosome 19 (Berr5 (Berghei resistance 
locus 5), LOD=4.69) controlling, in part, the differential response between
resistant BALB/c and susceptible C57BL/6 progenitors. BALB/c alleles convey
increased survival through the cerebral phase of infection but have no
quantitative effect on parasitemia during the later, anemic phase. The Berr5
locus colocalizes with three other immune loci, including Trl-4 (tuberculosis
resistance), Tsiq2 (T-cell secretion of IL-4) and Eae19 (experimental allergic
encephalitis 19), suggesting the possibility of a common genetic effect
underlying these phenotypes. Potential positional candidates include the family
of Ifit1-3 (interferon-inducible protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1-3) and 
Fas.
