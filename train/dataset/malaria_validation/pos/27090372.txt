In Plasmodium vivax malaria, mechanisms that trigger transition from
uncomplicated to fatal severe infections are obscure. In this multi-disciplinary 
study we have performed a comprehensive analysis of clinicopathological
parameters and serum proteome profiles of vivax malaria patients with different
severity levels of infection to investigate pathogenesis of severe malaria and
identify surrogate markers of severity. Clinicopathological analysis and
proteomics profiling has provided evidences for the modulation of diverse
physiological pathways including oxidative stress, cytoskeletal regulation, lipid
metabolism and complement cascades in severe malaria. Strikingly, unlike severe
falciparum malaria the blood coagulation cascade was not found to be affected
adversely in acute P. vivax infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
first comprehensive proteomics study, which identified some possible cues for
severe P. vivax infection. Our results suggest that Superoxide dismutase,
Vitronectin, Titin, Apolipoprotein E, Serum amyloid A, and Haptoglobin are
potential predictive markers for malaria severity.
