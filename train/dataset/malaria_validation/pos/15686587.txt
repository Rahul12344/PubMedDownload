The distribution of gene variants of the antigen processing proteins transporter 
associated with antigen processing type 1 (TAP1) and proteasome subunit beta type
9 (PSMB9) and of their shared bidirectional promoter was assessed in children
with either mild or severe malaria. The genetic study was performed on samples
collected during a longitudinal study on malariometric indices in an area
hyperendemic for Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Gabon. The allele frequencies
of the genes did not differ between the mild and the severe malaria groups. The
distributions of alleles among children with distinct phenotypes of severe
malaria were similar. A negative association of hypoglycaemia with the PSMB9
promoter variant PSMB9-R was found (odds ratio 0.01; chi2=12.1; P<0.0005;
Pc<0.03). The promoter allele TAP1-446G was associated with hyperparasitaemia and
absence of hypoglycaemia. TAP1, PSMB9, and TAP1/PSMB9 promoter alleles were in
strong linkage disequilibrium. DNA sequencing of the TAP1/PSMB9 promoter region
revealed a previously unrecognized single nucleotide polymorphism 455 bp upstream
of the TAP1 transcription start site.
