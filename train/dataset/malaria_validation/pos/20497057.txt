Pathogenic mechanisms underlying vivax malaria are poorly understood, with few
studies comparing endothelial and inflammatory responses with falciparum malaria.
In adults with uncomplicated vivax or falciparum malaria, we compared plasma
measurements of endothelial Weibel-Palade body release (angiopoietin-2) and
activation (ICAM-1, E-selectin), as well as selected cytokines. Despite a lower
median parasite count, angiopoietin-2 concentrations were higher in patients with
vivax malaria, compared with falciparum malaria. Per peripheral parasite, median 
plasma angiopoietin-2, ICAM-1, E-selectin, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10
concentrations were higher in patients with malaria due to Plasmodium vivax. P.
vivax induces greater endothelial Weibel-Palade body release and activation and
greater host inflammatory responses, compared with Plasmodium falciparum.
