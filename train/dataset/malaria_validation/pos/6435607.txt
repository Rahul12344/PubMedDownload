Polyamine levels and the activity of their biosynthetic enzymes in human
erythrocytes infected with the malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum.

Assaraf YG, Golenser J, Spira DT, Bachrach U.

Human erythrocytes contain only trace amounts of polyamines and lack active
polyamine biosynthetic enzymes. A remarkable increase in polyamine content, and
in the activity of ornithine and S-adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylases, is noted
in synchronous cultures of the malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum.
Polyamine biosynthesis reached peak values during the early trophozoite stage,
whereas nucleic acid and protein synthesis occurred later in mature trophozoites.
DL-alpha-Difluoromethylornithine, an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine
decarboxylase, did not interfere with merozoite invasion and with ring-form
development, but prevented the transformation of trophozoites to schizonts.
Concomitantly, the synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids was significantly
inhibited. These inhibitory effects could be readily reversed by the diamine
putrescine. Macromolecular synthesis and schizogony were normal when 5-10
mM-DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine and 0.1 mM-putrescine were added to the
cultures simultaneously.
