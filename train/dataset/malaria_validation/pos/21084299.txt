The malaria parasite invades the terminally differentiated erythrocytes, where it
grows and multiplies surrounded by a parasitophorous vacuole. Plasmodium blood
stages translocate newly synthesized proteins outside the parasitophorous vacuole
and direct them to various erythrocyte compartments, including the cytoskeleton
and the plasma membrane. Here, we show that the remodeling of the host cell
directed by the parasite also includes the recruitment of dematin, an
actin-binding protein of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton and its repositioning 
to the parasite. Internalized dematin was found associated with Plasmodium
14-3-3, which belongs to a family of conserved multitask molecules. We also show 
that, in vitro, the dematin-14-3-3 interaction is strictly dependent on
phosphorylation of dematin at Ser(124) and Ser(333), belonging to two 14-3-3
putative binding motifs. This study is the first report showing that a component 
of the erythrocyte spectrin-based membrane skeleton is recruited by the malaria
parasite following erythrocyte infection.
