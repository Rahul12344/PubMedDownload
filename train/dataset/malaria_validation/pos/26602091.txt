BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum malaria in India is characterized by high rates
of severe disease, with multiple organ dysfunction (MOD)-mainly associated with
acute renal failure (ARF)-and increased mortality. The objective of this study is
to identify cytokine signatures differentiating severe malaria patients with MOD,
cerebral malaria (CM), and cerebral malaria with MOD (CM-MOD) in India. We have
previously shown that two cytokines clusters differentiated CM from mild malaria 
in Maharashtra. Hence, we also aimed to determine if these cytokines could
discriminate malaria subphenotypes in Odisha.
METHODS: P. falciparum malaria patients from the SCB Medical College Cuttack in
the Odisha state in India were enrolled along with three sets of controls:
healthy individuals, patients with sepsis and encephalitis (n = 222). We
determined plasma concentrations of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines for all individuals using a multiplex assay. We then used an ensemble 
of statistical analytical methods to ascertain whether particular sets of
cytokines/chemokines were predictors of severity or signatures of a disease
category.
RESULTS: Of the 26 cytokines/chemokines tested, 19 increased significantly during
malaria and clearly distinguished malaria patients from controls, as well as
sepsis and encephalitis patients. High amounts of IL-17, IP-10, and IL-10
predicted MOD, decreased IL-17 and MIP-1α segregated CM-MOD from MOD, and
increased IL-12p40 differentiated CM from CM-MOD. Most severe malaria patients
with ARF exhibited high levels of IL-17.
CONCLUSION: We report distinct differences in cytokine production correlating
with malarial disease severity in Odisha and Maharashtra populations in India. We
show that CM, CM-MOD and MOD are clearly distinct malaria-associated pathologies.
High amounts of IL-17, IP-10, and IL-10 were predictors of MOD; decreased IL-17
and MIP-1α separated CM-MOD from MOD; and increased IL-12p40 differentiated CM
from CM-MOD. Data also suggest that the IL-17 pathway may contribute to malaria
pathogenesis via different regulatory mechanisms and may represent an interesting
target to mitigate the pathological processes in malaria-associated ARF.
