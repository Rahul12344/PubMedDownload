Central nervous system tissue of mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA)
exhibits similar histopathological features to those in post-mortem human
cerebral malaria (CM) tissue. In this study, the neurochemical characteristics of
PbA-infected and control mice were compared. Substance P-containing neurones were
almost completely lost from the cortex and striatum of PbA-infected mice seven
days after inoculation, whereas the intensity of calbindin immunolabelling was
increased compared with controls. Neuropeptide Y- and somatostatin-containing
neurones were dramatically reduced in number only in the cortex of day 7
post-inoculation mice compared with controls. This neurochemical pattern in mice 
with CM is similar to that previously reported to be produced in rats by
quinolinic acid. Since the level of quinolinic acid is known to be raised in the 
brains of PbA-infected mice, the results would be consistent with a role for
quinolinic acid in the production of brain damage in fatal murine CM.
