Cerebral malaria (CM) is a neurological complication of infection with Plasmodium
falciparum that is partly caused by cytokine-mediated inflammation. It is not
known whether interleukin-17 (IL-17) cytokines, which regulate inflammation,
control the development of CM. To evaluate the involvement of IL-17 cytokines in 
CM, we analyzed 46 common polymorphisms in IL17A, IL17F, and IL17RA (which
encodes the common receptor chain of the members of the IL-17 family) in two
independent African populations. A case-control study involving 115 Nigerian
children with CM and 160 controls from the community (CC) showed that IL17F
reference single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 6913472 (rs6913472) (P = 0.004;
odds ratio [OR] = 3.12), IL17F rs4715291 (P = 0.004; OR = 2.82), IL17RA
rs12159217 (P = 0.01; OR = 2.27), and IL17RA rs41396547 (P = 0.026; OR = 3.15)
were independently associated with CM. A replication study was performed in 240
nuclear Malian family trios (two parents with one CM child). We replicated the
association for 3 SNPs, IL17F rs6913472 (P = 0.03; OR = 1.39), IL17RA rs12159217 
(P = 0.01; OR = 1.52), and IL17RA rs41396547 (P = 0.04; OR = 3.50). We also found
that one additional SNP, IL17RA rs41433045, in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with
rs41396547, was associated with CM in both Nigeria and Mali (P = 0.002; OR = 4.12
in the combined sample). We excluded the possibility that SNPs outside IL17F and 
IL17RA, in strong LD with the associated SNPs, could account for the observed
associations. Furthermore, the results of a functional study indicated that the
aggravating GA genotype of IL17F rs6913472 was associated with lower IL-17F
concentrations. Our findings show for the first time that IL17F and IL17RA
polymorphisms modulate susceptibility to CM and provide evidence that IL-17F
protects against CM.
