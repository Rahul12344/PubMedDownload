Theileria parasites infect and transform bovine lymphocytes, but host cell
immortalization is reversible, as upon parasite death the lymphocytes rapidly die
of apoptosis. Infection leads to a marked augmentation in the levels of
lymphocyte c-Myc, and the parasite achieves this by inducing increased c-myc
transcription and by prolonging the half-life of the transcription factor.
Reduction in c-Myc turnover can be ascribed to CK2-mediated phosphorylation of
the transcription factor. A parasite-dependent GM-CSF autocrine loop activates a 
JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathway that contributes to heightened c-myc transcription,
and inhibition of the pathway leads to caspase 9 activation and apoptosis that
can be directly ascribed to a reduction in c-Myc. An antiapoptotic role for c-Myc
was clearly demonstrated by specific inhibition of c-myc expression with
antisense oligonucleotides, and this correlates with loss of the antiapoptotic
protein Mcl-1, and, consistently, ectopic expression of c-Myc abrogates B-cell
death induced upon JAK2 inhibition. Thus, Theileria parasites ensure the survival
of their host lymphocytes via specific activation of c-Myc.
