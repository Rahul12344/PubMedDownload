The course of malaria does not only depend on the virulence of the parasite
Plasmodium but also on properties of host erythrocytes. Here, we show that
infection of erythrocytes from human sickle cell trait (HbA/S) carriers with ring
stages of P. falciparum led to significantly enhanced PGE(2) formation, Ca(2+)
permeability, annexin-A7 degradation, phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure at the
cell surface, and clearance by macrophages. P. berghei-infected erythrocytes from
annexin-A7-deficient (annexin-A7(-/-)) mice were more rapidly cleared than
infected wildtype cells. Accordingly, P. berghei-infected annexin-A7(-/-) mice
developed less parasitemia than wildtype mice. The cyclooxygenase inhibitor
aspirin decreased erythrocyte PS exposure in infected annexin-A7(-/-) mice and
abolished the differences of parasitemia and survival between the genotypes.
Conversely, the PGE(2)-agonist sulprostone decreased parasitemia and increased
survival of wild type mice. In conclusion, PS exposure on erythrocytes results in
accelerated clearance of Plasmodium ring stage-infected HbA/S or annexin-A7(-/-) 
erythrocytes and thus confers partial protection against malaria in vivo.
