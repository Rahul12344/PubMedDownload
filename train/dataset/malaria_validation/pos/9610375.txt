Bovine T-cells infected by the protozoan parasite Theileria parva undergo
lymphoblastoid transformation, and proliferate in an uncontrolled manner. While
it has been established that the transcription factor NF-kappa B is
constitutively activated in T. parva-infected T-cells, little is known about
other transcription factors such as AP-1 and ATF-2. We demonstrated increased
binding activity to the AP-1 and CREB/ATF-2 consensus binding sites and show that
the AP-1 complex is composed of c-Jun, JunD, c-Fos, and ATF-2. The transcription 
factors c-Jun and ATF-2 are constitutively phosphorylated in a parasite-dependent
manner. Both transcription factors can be phosphorylated by jun-NH2-terminal
kinase (JNK), but ATF-2 is also a substrate for p38. We determined whether p38 is
activated in T. parva-infected cells. Immunoblot analysis and inhibitor studies
indicate that JNK, but not p38, is involved in ATF-2 phosphorylation. Based on
these results and previous studies, we conclude that parasite interference with
mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways is restricted to constitutive
activation of JNK.
