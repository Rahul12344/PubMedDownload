The antioxidants as protectors of host stress organ injury in mice infected with 
Plasmodium berghei.

Arif AJ, Chandra S, Singh C.

A study has been made of counteracting the stress organ injury in Plasmodium
infection by means of antioxidants on the premise that free radicals are
responsible for causing the injury to stress organs. This was evidenced by
drastically altered biochemical parameters in liver and spleen of the host in
terms of elevated levels of lipid peroxides and xanthine oxidase (XO) activity,
and a fall in superoxide dismutase activity coupled with other drastic
biochemical changes. The cardinal factor responsible for the above was considered
to be XO which engenders free radicals purportedly responsible for the stress
organ (biochemical) injury. Results demonstrate a lowering of lipid peroxide
levels, xanthine oxidase activity, liver weight and modulation of protein level
in liver of the host (mouse) in Plasmodium infection when treated with catechin, 
glutathione and propylgallate.
