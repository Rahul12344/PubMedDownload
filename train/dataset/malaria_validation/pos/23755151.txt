INTRODUCTION: The angiogenic proteins angiopoietin (Ang)-1, Ang-2 and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are regulators of endothelial inflammation and
integrity. Since platelets store large amounts of Ang-1 and VEGF, measurement of 
circulation levels of these proteins is sensitive to platelet number, in vivo
platelet activation and inadvertent platelet activation during blood processing. 
We studied plasma Ang-1, Ang-2 and VEGF levels in malaria patients, taking the
necessary precautions to avoid ex vivo platelet activation, and related plasma
levels to platelet count and the soluble platelet activation markers P-selectin
and CXCL7.
METHODS: Plasma levels of Ang-1, Ang-2, VEGF, P-selectin and CXCL7 were measured 
in CTAD plasma, minimizing ex vivo platelet activation, in 27 patients with
febrile Plasmodium falciparum malaria at presentation and day 2 and 5 of
treatment and in 25 healthy controls.
RESULTS: Levels of Ang-1, Ang-2 and VEGF were higher at day 0 in malaria patients
compared to healthy controls. Ang-2 levels, which is a marker of endothelial
activation, decreased after start of antimalarial treatment. In contrast, Ang-1
and VEGF plasma levels increased and this corresponded with the increase in
platelet number. Soluble P-selectin and CXCL7 levels followed the same trend as
Ang-1 and VEGF levels. Plasma levels of these four proteins correlated strongly
in malaria patients, but only moderately in controls.
CONCLUSION: In contrast to previous studies, we found elevated plasma levels of
Ang-1 and VEGF in patients with malaria resulting from in vivo platelet
activation. Ang-1 release from platelets may be important to dampen the
disturbing effects of Ang-2 on the endothelium. Evaluation of plasma levels of
these angiogenic proteins requires close adherence to a stringent protocol to
minimize ex vivo platelet activation.
