BACKGROUND: Innate immunity plays a crucial role in the host defense against
malaria including Plasmodium falciparum malaria in pregnancy, but the roles of
the various underlying genes and mechanisms predisposing to the disease are
poorly understood.
METHODS: 98 single-nucletoide polymorphisms were genotyped in a set of 17
functionally related genes of the complement system in 145 primiparous Ghanaian
women with placental malaria, defined by placental parasitaemia or malaria
pigment, and as a control, in 124 non-affected primiparae.
RESULTS: Placental malaria was significantly associated with SNPs in the lectin
pathway genes MBL2, MASP2, FCN2 and in properdin. In particular, the main African
mannose-binding lectin deficiency variant (MBL2*G57E, rs1800451) increased the
odds of placental malaria (OR 1.6; permuted p-value 0.014). In contrast, a common
MASP2 mutation (R439H, rs12085877), which reduces the activity of MBL-MASP2
complexes occurred in 33% of non-affected women and in 22% primiparae with
placental malaria (OR 0.55, permuted p-value 0.020).
CONCLUSIONS: Excessive complement activation is of importance in the pathogenesis
of placental malaria by mediating inflammation, coagulation, and endothelial
dysfunction. Mutated MBL and MASP2 proteins could have direct intrinsic effects
on the susceptibility to placental malaria, in addition to their roles in
regulation of downstream complement activation.
