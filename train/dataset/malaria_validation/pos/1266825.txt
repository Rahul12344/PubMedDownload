Cognitive stimulation.

Marquis P.

Cross-sectional studies suggest that the intellectual development of American
children is affected by experiences in the first three years of life.
Furthermore, Piaget and White have observed and documented direct effects of the 
environment on the development of infants during the first year of life.
Principles derived from animal research and the disappointing results of
preschool intervention programs highlight the irreversible nature of early
infant-environment interaction. Future programs designed to prevent educational
incapacitation among children must concentrate on optimizing the developmental
milieu of the child before he is 4 years old. Accomplishing this task is the
practical challenge in the field of child development today.
