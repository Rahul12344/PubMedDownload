The infection of human erythrocytes by two strains of the human malarial
parasite, Plasmodium falciparum (FCQ-27 or the multi-drug-resistant strain K-1), 
markedly changed the transport characteristics of the nucleosides, adenosine and 
tubercidin, compared to uninfected erythrocytes. A component of the transport of 
these nucleosides was insensitive to the classical mammalian nucleoside transport
inhibitor nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR). In vitro studies with tubercidin
demonstrated ID50 values of 0.43 and 0.51 microM for FCQ-27 and K-1,
respectively. In addition, the nucleoside transport inhibitors NBMPR,
nitrobenzylthioguanosine (NBTGR), dilazep and dipyridamole also independently
exhibited antimalarial activity in vitro. The combination of tubercidin and NBMPR
or NBTGR in vitro demonstrated synergistic activity, whilst tubercidin together
with dilazep or dipyridamole showed subadditive activity. Analysis by HPLC
indicated that NBMPR could permeate the infected cell membrane and provided
evidence for the catabolism of NBMPR in vitro, with subsequent alteration of the 
purine pool in the infected erythrocyte. These observations further indicated the
possibility of the utilization of cytotoxic nucleosides against P. falciparum
infection in conjunction with a nucleoside transport inhibitor to protect the
host tissue.
