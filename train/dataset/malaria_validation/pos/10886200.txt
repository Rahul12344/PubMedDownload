Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the key growth factor for platelet production and is
elevated in states of platelet depletion. As thrombocytopenia is a common finding
in malaria, we analysed TPO regulation before, during and after antimalarial
treatment. Before treatment, TPO serum levels were significantly higher in
patients with severe malaria (n = 35) than in patients with uncomplicated malaria
(n = 44; P = 0.024), normalizing within 14-21 d of therapy. The rapid
normalization of TPO levels and increase in low peripheral platelet counts after 
treatment indicate that the biosynthesis of TPO and its regulation in malaria
patients are normal.
