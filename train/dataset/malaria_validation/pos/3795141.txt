Enzymatic characterization of Babesia bovis.

Rodriguez SD, Buening GM, Vega CA, Carson CA.

Agarose gel electrophoresis was used to identify metabolic enzymes in Babesia
bovis and B. bigemina. Glutamate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose
phosphate isomerase, and hexokinase were identified in B. bovis- and B.
bigemina-infected erythrocytes and B. bovis merozoite preparations. A specific
electrophoretic mobility was observed for each enzyme. Malate dehydrogenase,
glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and
adenylate kinase were only detected in normal erythrocyte preparations.
Inter-species, but not intra-species, variation was noted when comparing
electrophoretograms of both species. Kinin-activating activity was not detected
in B. bovis-infected erythrocyte or merozoite preparations at pH 4.2 or 7.6.
