Ornithine decarboxylase inhibition and the malaria-infected red cell: a model for
polyamine metabolism and growth.

Whaun JM, Brown ND.

The addition of DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine, an irreversible inhibitor of
ornithine decarboxylase, to human Plasmodium falciparum-infected red cells in
continuous culture decreased both parasite growth and intracellular polyamine
concentrations. Growth of P. falciparum in infected red cells was assessed by
parasite counts and by assays for macromolecular syntheses of protein, DNA and
RNA. Polyamine concentrations were measured by an automated high-performance
liquid chromatography method. Concentrations of DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine 
greater than 0.3 mM decreased intracellular levels of putrescine and spermidine, 
reduced ornithine decarboxylase activity and inhibited growth and maturation of
the intracellular parasite at the trophozoite stage. There was a concomitant
decrease in the synthesis of protein and nucleic acids in the infected cells. The
use of this parasitized red cell model system together with polyamine inhibitors 
provide means of studying polyamine synthesis and cell growth in the design of
new antimalarial therapy.
