Complications from falciparum malaria are responsible for over one million infant
deaths annually. There is as yet no clinically protective vaccine that has been
developed against human malaria parasites. While several studies have
demonstrated the inhibitory properties of human sera against Plasmodium
falciparum, there is no reported investigation that has examined the protective
effects of human breastmilk against the malaria parasite. This study demonstrates
the presence of significant antibody titers to ring, trophozoite, schizont and
gametocyte stages of P. falciparum in 144 Nigerian maternal milk samples and also
in paired maternal and infant sera. The study also demonstrates significant in
vitro growth inhibition of P. falciparum by maternal and infant sera, but most
notably by breastmilk samples and breastmilk constituents, such as lactoferrin
and sIgA. The results therefore suggest a protective in vivo role for breastmilk 
in the possible modulation of malaria frequency, severity and complications.
