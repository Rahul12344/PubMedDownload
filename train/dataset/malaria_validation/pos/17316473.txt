Plasmodium spp. cause the worst parasitic diseases in humans and evade host
immunity in complicated ways. Activated catabolism of tryptophan in dendritic
cells is thought to suppress immunity, which is mediated by an inducible
rate-limiting enzyme of tryptophan catabolism, indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO),
via both tryptophan depletion and production of toxic metabolites. In various
infections, including malaria, IDO is known to be activated but its biological
significance is unclear; therefore, we investigated whether malaria parasites
induce IDO to suppress host immune responses. We found that enzymatic activity of
IDO was elevated systematically in our mouse malaria model, and was abolished by 
in vivo IDO inhibition with 1-methyl tryptophan. Experimental infection with
Plasmodium yoelii showed that IDO inhibition slightly suppressed parasite density
in association with enhanced proliferation and IFN-gamma production by CD4+ T
cells in response to malaria parasites. Our observations suggest that induction
of IDO is one of the immune mechanisms of malaria parasites.
