T. annulata, the causative agent of tropical theileriosis in cattle, can also
infect ovine and caprine leukocytes in vitro. In vivo studies showed that this
parasite causes a mild infection in both these animal species, and in sheep
merozoite stage development seems to be inhibited. Since the nature of T.
annulata infected caprine and ovine cells is not known, all three cell lines were
karyotyped and phenotypically characterized by flow cytometry. They all express
mRNA of cytokines IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-8, and TNF-alpha, but not of
IFN-gamma, IL-2, and IL-4. In contrast, IL-6 mRNA was expressed in the cattle
cell line only, while mRNA of IL-10 was exclusively produced by the sheep cell
line. The observed differences in cytokine mRNA expression may be responsible for
the different pathogenesis of T. annulata infection in cattle and sheep.
