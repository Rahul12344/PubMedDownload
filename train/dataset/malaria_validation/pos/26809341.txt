Protective vaccination induces self-healing of otherwise lethal blood-stage
infections of Plasmodium chabaudi malaria. Here, we investigate mRNA expression
patterns of all 12 members of the Toll-like receptor (Tlr) gene family in the
liver, a major effector organ against blood-stage malaria, during lethal and
vaccination-induced self-healing infections of P. chabaudi in female Balb/c mice.
Gene expression microarrays reveal that all 12 Tlr genes are constitutively
expressed, though at varying levels, and specifically respond to infection.
Protective vaccination does not affect constitutive expression of any of the 12
Tlr genes but leads to differential expression (p < 0.05) of seven Tlrs (1, 2, 4,
7, 8, 12, and 13) in response to malaria. Quantitative PCR substantiates
differential expression at p < 0.01. There is an increased expression of Tlr2 by 
approximately five-fold on day 1 post-infection (p.i.) and Tlr1 by approximately 
threefold on day 4 p.i.. At peak parasitemia on day 8 p.i., none of the 12 Tlrs
display any differential expression. After peak parasitemia, towards the end of
the crisis phase on day 11 p.i., expression of Tlrs 1, 4, and 12 is increased by 
approximately four-, two-, and three-fold, respectively, and that of Tlr7 is
decreased by approximately two-fold. Collectively, our data suggest that though
all 12 members of the Tlr gene family are specifically responsive to malaria in
the liver, not only Tlr2 at the early stage of infection but also the Tlrs 1, 4, 
7, and 12 towards the end of crisis phase are critical for vaccination-induced
resolution and survival of otherwise lethal blood-stage malaria.
