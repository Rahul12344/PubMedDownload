The ubiquitin-specific protease USP7 stabilizes both Mdm2 and p53 by removing
ubiquitins, hence playing an important enzymatic role in the p53-Mdm2 pathway.
However, it is poorly understood how USP7 executes its dual-stabilization effect 
on Mdm2 and p53 in cellular context. Here, we report that STIP is a novel
macromolecular scaffold that links USP7 to the p53-Mdm2 pathway. STIP and a
fraction of USP7 interact and constitutively colocalize in nucleoplasma.
Overexpression of STIP stabilizes Mdm2 and p53, whereas downregulation of STIP
decreases Mdm2 and p53 levels. The effect of STIP on Mdm2 and p53 depends on USP7
function as a deubiquitinating enzyme. Furthermore, we demonstrate that STIP
mediates the assembly of two separate ternary protein complexes in vivo as
STIP-USP7-Mdm2 and STIP-USP7-p53, which facilitates USP7-mediated stabilization
of Mdm2 and p53. Collectively, these results pinpoint a new molecular function of
STIP and reveal a novel mechanism whereby USP7 executes its dual-stabilization
effect on Mdm2 and p53 via STIP scaffolding.
