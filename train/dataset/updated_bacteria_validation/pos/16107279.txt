Among digestive organs, the liver and the large intestine are abundant in T cells
expressing NK1.1. NK1.1+ T cells in the liver are mostly CD1d-dependent whereas
those in the large intestine are CD1d-independent. In this study, we investigated
the effects of Lactobacilli on NK1.1+ T cells in the digestive organs of mice.
C57BL/6 mice were orally given a dietary supplement prepared from mixed cultures 
of eight strains of Lactobacilli. Oral administration of Lactobacilli to mice
resulted in the selective expansion of NK1.1+ T cells in the large intestine.
These colon NK1.1+ T cells activated by Lactobacilli were found to express
IFN-gamma mRNA. The level of IFN-gamma in the serum was also elevated by the
administration of Lactobacilli. Our results suggest that Lactobacilli selectively
activate CD1d-independent NK1.1+ T cells in the large intestine to produce
IFN-gamma and therefore modulate Th1 immune responses.
