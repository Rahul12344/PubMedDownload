The survival of selected naturally occurring and genetically engineered bacteria 
in a fully functional laboratory-scale activated-sludge unit (ASU) was
investigated. The effect of the presence of 3-chlorobenzoate (3CB) on the
survival of Pseudomonas putida UWC1, with or without a chimeric plasmid, pD10,
which encodes 3CB catabolism, was determined. P. putida UWC1(pD10) did not
enhance 3CB breakdown in the ASU, even following inoculation at a high
concentration (3 x 10(8) CFU/ml). The emergence of a natural, 3CB-degrading
population appeared to have a detrimental effect on the survival of strain UWC1
in the ASU. The fate of two 3CB-utilizing bacteria, derived from activated-sludge
microflora, was studied in experiments in which these strains were inoculated
into the ASU. Both strains, AS2, an unmanipulated natural isolate which
flocculated readily in liquid media, and P. putida ASR2.8, a transconjugant
containing the recombinant plasmid pD10, survived for long periods in the ASU and
enhanced 3CB breakdown at 15 degrees C. The results reported in this paper
illustrate the importance of choosing strains which are well adapted to
environmental conditions if the use of microbial inoculants for the breakdown of 
target pollutants is to be successful.
