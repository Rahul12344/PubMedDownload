In the present study, the roles of interleukin 12 (IL-12) and IL-18 and their
possible interaction during superantigen-induced responses were studied by
injection of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) into mice. These data suggest
that the role of IL-12 in SEB-induced responses is limited to sustaining gamma
interferon release by an IL-18-independent mechanism.
