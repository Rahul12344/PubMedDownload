Anaplasma phagocytophilum is an obligate intracellular bacterium that infects
neutrophils and causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis. Infection induces
neutrophil secretion of interleukin-8 or murine homologs and perpetuates
infection by recruiting susceptible neutrophils. We hypothesized that antibody
blockade of CXCR2 would decrease A. phagocytophilum tissue load by interrupting
neutrophil recruitment but would not influence murine hepatic pathology. C3H-scid
mice were treated with CXCR2 antiserum or control prior to or on day 14 after
infection. Quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry for A. phagocytophilum were 
performed and severity of liver histopathology was ranked. Control mice had more 
infected cells in tissues than the anti-CXCR2-treated group. The
histopathological rank was not different between treated and control animals.
Infected cells of control mice clustered in tissue more than in treated mice. The
results support the hypothesis of bacterial propagation through chemokine
induction and confirm that tissue injury is unrelated to A. phagocytophilum
tissue load.
