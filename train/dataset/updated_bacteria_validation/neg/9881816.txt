The etiology of rheumatoid arthritis has been elusive, but it finally seems to be
explained by a combination of three factors: (i) a relatively mild deficiency of 
cortisol, the normal adrenocortical hormone that is essential for normal immunity
but which has achieved a bad reputation because of the use of excessive dosages
of it or its stronger derivatives, (ii) a deficiency of dehydro-epi-androsterone 
(DHEA), the chief androgen produced by the human adrenal cortex but which has
been little studied, and (iii) infection by organisms such as mycoplasma, which
have a relatively low virulence, are difficult to culture in the laboratory, and 
cause inflammation and destruction of tissue in periarticular and articular areas
of immunocompromised hosts. The mild adrenocortical deficiency apparently is
sufficient to impair immunity, especially after stress, and permit these
organisms to cause inflammatory arthritis. Further studies are necessary to
determine optimum therapy, but it will probably include safe physiologic dosages 
of cortisol and DHEA plus antibiotic treatment of infection by mycoplasma or
other causative organisms.
