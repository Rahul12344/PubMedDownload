Recognized more than a decade ago, NKT cells differentiate from mainstream thymic
precursors through instructive signals emanating during TCR engagement by
CD1d-expressing cortical thymocytes. Their semi-invariant alphabeta TCRs
recognize isoglobotrihexosylceramide, a mammalian glycosphingolipid, as well as
microbial alpha-glycuronylceramides found in the cell wall of Gram-negative,
lipopolysaccharide-negative bacteria. This dual recognition of self and microbial
ligands underlies innate-like antimicrobial functions mediated by CD40L induction
and massive Th1 and Th2 cytokine and chemokine release. Through reciprocal
activation of NKT cells and dendritic cells, synthetic NKT ligands constitute
promising new vaccine adjuvants. NKT cells also regulate a range of
immunopathological conditions, but the mechanisms and the ligands involved remain
unknown. NKT cell biology has emerged as a new field of research at the frontier 
between innate and adaptive immunity, providing a powerful model to study
fundamental aspects of the cell and structural biology of glycolipid trafficking,
processing, and recognition.
