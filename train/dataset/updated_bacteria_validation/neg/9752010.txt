Starting from strain of Salmonella typhimurium purD::lac, 86 exponential cultures
were mutagenized with NTG and white or light blue clones on E + ado + Xgal plate 
were selected as candidates of purRs mutant. Total 66 independent candidate
strains were obtained. By assaying their beta-galactosidase activity under the
repressed and derepressed conditions, determining their frequency of revertional 
mutation, Conducting transductional analysis of mutational site and dorminance
test, 11 candidates strains were proved to be super-repressor mutants. These
mutants are useful for studying the expression of purine biosynthetic gene and
relationship between protein structure and function in general.
