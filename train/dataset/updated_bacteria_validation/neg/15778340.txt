Activated NK T cells are known to rapidly stimulate NK cells and, subsequently,
CD8(+) T cells and B cells. In this report, we first demonstrate that the
downstream effects induced by alpha-galactosylceramide activated NK T cells on NK
cells are mainly dependent on IFN-gamma. We found that NK T cell activation of NK
cells requires a functional IFN-gamma signaling in macrophages and dendritic
cells but not in B cells, NK cells, or NK T cells. NK T cell activation is
dendritic cell-dependent whereas NK T cell activation of NK cells is indirect and
in part mediated by macrophages. Interestingly, in this context, macrophage
participation in the CD1d Ag presentation of alpha-galactosylceramide to NK T
cells is not necessary. These data indicate that NK T cell-dependent activation
of macrophages is required for optimal NK T cell-induced stimulation of NK cells.
