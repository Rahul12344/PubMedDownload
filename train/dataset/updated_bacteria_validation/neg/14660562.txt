Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (Pth) activity releases tRNA from the premature
translation termination product peptidyl-tRNA. Two different enzymes have been
reported to encode such activity, Pth present in bacteria and eukaryotes and Pth2
present in archaea and eukaryotes. Here we report the crystallographic structure 
of the Homo sapiens Pth2 at a 2.0-A resolution as well as its catalytic
properties. In contrast to the structure of Escherichia coli Pth, H. sapiens Pth2
has an alpha/beta fold with a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet in its core
surrounded by two alpha-helices on each side. This arrangement of secondary
structure elements generates a fold not previously reported. Its catalytic
efficiency is comparable with that reported for the archaeal Sulfolobus
solfataricus Pth2 and higher than that of the bacterial E. coli Pth. Several
lines of evidence target the active site to two close loops with highly conserved
residues. This active site architecture is unrelated to that of E. coli Pth. In
addition, intermolecular contacts in the crystal asymmetric unit cell suggest a
likely surface for protein-protein interactions related to the Pth2-mediated
apoptosis.
