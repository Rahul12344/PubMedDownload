Natural killer (NK) lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion
control infections and cancers, but these crucial activities decline with age. NK
cell development, homeostasis, and function require IL-15 and its chaperone,
IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15Rα). Macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) are major
sources of these proteins. We had previously postulated that additional IL-15 and
IL-15Rα is made by skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. These sources may be
important in aging, when IL-15-producing immune cells decline. NK cells circulate
through adipose tissue, where they may be exposed to local IL-15. The objectives 
of this work were to determine (1) if human muscle, subcutaneous adipose tissue
(SAT), and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) are sources of IL-15 and IL-15 Rα, and
(2) whether any of these tissues correlate with NK cell activity in elderly
humans. We first investigated IL-15 and IL-15Rα RNA expression in paired muscle
and SAT biopsies from healthy human subjects. Both tissues expressed these
transcripts, but IL-15Rα RNA levels were higher in SAT than in skeletal muscle.
We also investigated tissue obtained from surgeries and found that SAT and VAT
expressed equivalent amounts of IL-15 and IL-15Rα RNA, respectively. Furthermore,
stromal vascular fraction cells expressed more IL-15 RNA than did adipocytes. To 
test if these findings related to circulating IL-15 protein and NK cell function,
we tested 50 healthy adults aged > 70 years old. Plasma IL-15 levels
significantly correlated with abdominal VAT mass in the entire cohort and in
non-obese subjects. However, plasma IL-15 levels did not correlate with skeletal 
muscle cross-sectional area and correlated inversely with muscle strength. Plasma
IL-15 did correlate with NK cell cytotoxic granule exocytosis and with CCL4
(MIP-1β) production in response to NKp46-crosslinking. Additionally, NK cell
responses to K562 leukemia cells correlated inversely with muscle strength. With 
aging, immune function declines while infections, cancers, and deaths increase.
We propose that VAT-derived IL-15 and IL-15Rα is a compensatory NK cell support
mechanism in elderly humans.
