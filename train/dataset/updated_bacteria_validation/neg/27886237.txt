Staphylococcus aureus is a major human and animal pathogen and a common cause of 
mastitis in cattle. S. aureus secretes several leukocidins that target bovine
neutrophils, crucial effector cells in the defence against bacterial pathogens.
In this study, we investigated the role of staphylococcal leukocidins in the
pathogenesis of bovine S. aureus disease. We show that LukAB, in contrast to the 
γ-hemolysins, LukED, and LukMF', was unable to kill bovine neutrophils, and
identified CXCR2 as a bovine receptor for HlgAB and LukED. Furthermore, we
assessed functional leukocidin secretion by bovine mastitis isolates and observed
that, although leukocidin production was strain dependent, LukMF' was most
abundantly secreted and the major toxin killing bovine neutrophils. To determine 
the role of LukMF' in bovine mastitis, cattle were challenged with high (S1444)
or intermediate (S1449, S1463) LukMF'-producing isolates. Only animals infected
with S1444 developed severe clinical symptoms. Importantly, LukM was produced in 
vivo during the course of infection and levels in milk were associated with the
severity of mastitis. Altogether, these findings underline the importance of
LukMF' as a virulence factor and support the development of therapeutic
approaches targeting LukMF' to control S. aureus mastitis in cattle.
