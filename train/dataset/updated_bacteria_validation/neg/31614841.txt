Reports from previous studies now provide evidence that dyslipidaemia and
oxidative stress play crucial roles in the pathogenesis and progression of
diabetes and its related complications. This research is aimed to investigate the
potential effects of protein isolate from Parkia biglobosa seeds (PBPI) in
streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats by measuring blood glucose levels,
changes in lipid metabolism and biomarkers of oxidative stress. Diabetic rats
were treated orally with graded doses of PBPI, 200 mg/kg bw and 400 mg/kg bw, and
5 U/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.) of insulin once daily for 28 days with the fasting
blood glucose (FBG) monitored weekly. The effect of PBPI on the serum lipid
profile was measured while the extent of lipid peroxidation (LPO), as well as
antioxidant parameters (superoxide dismutase; SOD, catalase; CAT,
glutathione-S-transferase; GST and total glutathione; total GSH), was determined 
in the cardiac homogenates of diabetic rats. At the tested doses, treatment with 
PBPI was significantly effective in lowering FBG, serum triglyceride,
cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and very low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-c), while concurrently increasing high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c). PBPI also significantly decreased the elevations
witnessed in LPO levels and restored the biomarkers of oxidative stress in the
cardiac homogenate of experimental rats. The results from this study demonstrate 
that PBPI could improve dyslipidaemia and cardiac oxidative stress in the
experimental diabetic animal model possibly by reducing and effectively
scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as well as by increasing
antioxidant capacity in combating oxidative stress. Therefore, it can be
concluded that PBPI could be explored in the development of a potent
cardioprotective supplement or adjuvant therapy towards the management of
diabetes and its related complications.
