Infection at the injection site following parenteral drug abuse is a well known
complication. In Oslo, Norway's capital city with a population of 500,000, most
of these infections are treated on an out-patient basis in the surgical
department at Oslo Legevakt, a publicly funded primary health care facility.
During the four last months of 1998, 179 patients were admitted with skin and
soft tissue infections at the injection site compared to only 46 in the same
period in 1993. This suggests that the problem is increasing. In this
retrospective study these populations were analysed according to their age, sex, 
clinical appearance, and the treatment given. In 1998, 36 patients were admitted 
to hospital, the rest treated on an out-patient basis. A total of 112 patients
were treated with simple incision and drainage, 63 of whom were given
antibiotics. 37 patients were treated with antibiotics only. There were few
complications; two patients with deep venous thrombosis and one in need of skin
transplantation. We saw no development of life threatening infections among our
patients. The article also gives suggestions for treatment.
