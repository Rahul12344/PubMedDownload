Candida albicans, the major invasive fungal pathogen of humans, can cause both
debilitating mucosal infections and fatal invasive infections. Understanding the 
complex nature of the host-pathogen interaction in each of these contexts is
essential to developing desperately needed therapies to treat fungal infections. 
RNA-seq enables a systems-level understanding of infection by facilitating
comprehensive analysis of transcriptomes from multiple species (e.g., host and
pathogen) simultaneously. We used RNA-seq to characterize the transcriptomes of
both C. albicans and human endothelial cells or oral epithelial cells during in
vitro infection. Network analysis of the differentially expressed genes
identified the activation of several signaling pathways that have not previously 
been associated with the host response to fungal pathogens. Using an siRNA
knockdown approach, we demonstrate that two of these pathways-platelet-derived
growth factor BB (PDGF BB) and neural precursor-cell-expressed developmentally
down-regulated protein 9 (NEDD9)-govern the host-pathogen interaction by
regulating the uptake of C. albicans by host cells. Using RNA-seq analysis of a
mouse model of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis (HDC) and episodes of
vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) in humans, we found evidence that many of the same
signaling pathways are activated during mucosal (VVC) and/or disseminated (HDC)
infections in vivo. Our analyses have uncovered several signaling pathways at the
interface between C. albicans and host cells in various contexts of infection,
and suggest that PDGF BB and NEDD9 play important roles in this interaction. In
addition, these data provide a valuable community resource for better
understanding host-fungal pathogen interactions.
