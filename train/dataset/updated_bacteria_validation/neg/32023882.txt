One of the greatest impacts on the gastrointestinal microbiome is diet because
the host and microbiome share the same food source. In addition, the effect of
diet can diverge depending on the host genotype. Diets supplemented with
phytochemicals found in peppers might cause shifts in the microbiome. Thus,
understanding how these interactions occur can reveal potential health
implications associated with such changes. This study aims to explore the gut
microbiome of different Drosophila genetic backgrounds and the effects of dietary
pepper treatments on its composition and structure. We analyzed the gut
microbiomes of three Drosophila melanogaster genetic backgrounds (Canton-S,
Oregon-RC, and Berlin-K) reared on control and pepper-containing diets (bell,
serrano, and habanero peppers). Results of 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that
the variability of Drosophila gut microbiome can be driven mainly by genetic
factors. When the abundance of these communities is considered, pepper-containing
diets also appear to have an effect. The most relevant change in microbial
composition was the increment of Lactobacillaceae and Acetobacteraceae abundance 
in the pepper-containing diets in comparison with the controls in Oregon-RC and
Berlin-K. Regression analysis demonstrated that this enhancement was associated
with the content of phenolic compounds and carotenoids of the peppers utilized in
this study; specifically, to the concentration of β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin,
myricetin, quercetin, and apigenin.
