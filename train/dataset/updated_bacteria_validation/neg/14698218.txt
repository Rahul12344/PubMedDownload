The characteristics and primary structure of AJL-1, one of the lectins in the
skin mucus of the Japanese eel (Anguilla japonica), were examined. This lectin
exhibited beta-galactoside specific activity in a Ca2+ independent manner. We
previously reported that its molecular mass was 16,091Da, although it was
approximately 30 kDa as determined by gel filtration, indicating that it is a
homodimer having non-covalent bonds. This lectin was composed of 142 amino acid
residues having no half-cystinyl residues, and showed homology to members of the 
galectin family, especially to proto-type galectins. Gene expression of this
lectin was detected in skin only, and relative expression was high in an
individual that exhibited resistance to infectious disease. AJL-1 showed
agglutinating activity against pathogenic bacteria, Streptococcus difficile. This
suggests that AJL-1 functions as an important defensive factor at the body
surface.
