BACKGROUND: The reliability of the rapid urease test has not been proven in
patients with peptic ulcer bleeding. Some studies show bad diagnostic results
with the rapid urease test for gastrointestinal bleeding.
AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy of the rapid urease test in patients with bleeding
gastric or duodenal ulcers.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 96 patients with acute peptic ulcer bleeding
without proton pump inhibitor or antibiotic therapy within the last 14 days
before bleeding were included into the study. During index endoscopy, specimens
for histological and rapid urease test were obtained from the antrum and corpus
mucosa of the stomach. Patients were also investigated by the 13C-urea breath
test. Diagnostic quality parameters were calculated with the histology and the
13C-urea breath test as reference and compared with a matched control group with 
uncomplicated ulcers.
RESULTS: The sensitivity of the rapid urease test was 80% and the specificity
100% compared to histology and 13C-urea breath test. The negative predictive
value was 75%. These values were statistically significantly different from those
of the control group (sensitivity 96%, specificity 100%, negative predictive
value 88%).
CONCLUSION: The exclusive use of the rapid urease test cannot be recommended in
patients with peptic ulcer bleeding.
