More than 30 million surgical procedures are performed annually in the United
States, and surgical site infections (SSIs) remain a major postoperative
complication. Although bacteria contaminate all surgical wounds, not all wounds
become infected. In most cases, the host response eradicates the microbes. The
patient's (ie, host's) responsiveness, therefore, is an important variable in the
equation of factors that influence the rate of infection. Optimizing the
patient's physiological condition can help prevent SSIs. Initiatives that show
promise in reducing SSI rates include use of supplemental oxygen, maintenance of 
core body temperature, and rigorous management of blood sugar. Perioperative
nurses play an important role as the patient's infection control advocate.
