GNA13 is the most frequently mutated gene in germinal center (GC)-derived B-cell 
lymphomas, including nearly a quarter of Burkitt lymphoma and GC-derived diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma. These mutations occur in a pattern consistent with loss of
function. We have modeled the GNA13-deficient state exclusively in GC B cells by 
crossing the Gna13 conditional knockout mouse strain with the GC-specific AID-Cre
transgenic strain. AID-Cre(+) GNA13-deficient mice demonstrate disordered GC
architecture and dark zone/light zone distribution in vivo, and demonstrate
altered migration behavior, decreased levels of filamentous actin, and attenuated
RhoA activity in vitro. We also found that GNA13-deficient mice have increased
numbers of GC B cells that display impaired caspase-mediated cell death and
increased frequency of somatic hypermutation in the immunoglobulin VH locus.
Lastly, GNA13 deficiency, combined with conditional MYC transgene expression in
mouse GC B cells, promotes lymphomagenesis. Thus, GNA13 loss is associated with
GC B-cell persistence, in which impaired apoptosis and ongoing somatic
hypermutation may lead to an increased risk of lymphoma development.
