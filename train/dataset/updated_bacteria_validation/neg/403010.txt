Synthesis of hybrid bacterial plasmids containing highly repeated satellite DNA.

Brutlag D, Fry K, Nelson T, Hung P.

Hybrid plasmid molecules containing tandemly repeated Drosophila satellite DNA
were constructed using a modification of the (dA)-(dT) homopolymer procedure of
Lobban and Kaiser (1973). Recombinant plasmids recovered after transformation of 
recA bacteria contained 10% of the amount of satellite DNA present in the
transforming molecules. The cloned plasmids were not homogenous in size.
Recombinant plasmids isolated from a single colony contained populations of
circular molecules which varied both in the length of the satellite region and in
the poly(dA)-(dt) regions linking satellite and vector. While subcloning reduced 
the heterogeneity of these plasmid populations, continued cell growth caused
further variations in the size of the repeated regions. Two different simple
sequence satellites of Drosophila melanogaster (1.672 and 1.705 g/cm3) were
unstable in both recA and recBC hosts and in both pSC101 and pCR1 vectors. We
propose that this recA-independent instability of tandemly repeated sequences is 
due to unequal intramolecular recombination events in replicating DNA molecules, 
a mechanism analogous to sister chromatid exchange in eucaryotes.
