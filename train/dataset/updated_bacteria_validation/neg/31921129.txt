Studies focused on development of an attenuated vaccine against Mycobacterium
avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map), the causative agent of paratuberculosis
(Ptb) in cattle and other species, revealed that deletion of relA, a global gene 
regulator, abrogates the ability of Map to establish a persistent infection. In
the absence of relA, cattle develop CD8 cytotoxic T cells (CTL) with the ability 
to kill intracellular bacteria. Analysis of the recall response to a relA mutant,
Map/ΔrelA, with cells from a vaccinated steer demonstrated that a 35-kDa membrane
peptide (MMP) is one of the targets of the response. This observation suggested
that it might be possible to develop a peptide-based vaccine. As reported here,
the gene encoding the hypothetical MMP ORF, MAP2121c, was modified for expression
in mammalian cells as a first step in developing an expression cassette for
incorporation into a mammalian expression vector. The modified sequence of MMP,
tPA-MMP, was mutated to generate two additional sequences for the study, one with
substitutions to replace five potential residues that could be glycosylated,
tPA-MMP-5mut, and one with substitutions to replace the first two potential
residues that could be glycosylated, tPA-MMP-2mut. The sequences were placed in
an expression cassette to produce peptides for analysis. An ex vivo platform was 
used with flow cytometry and a bacterium viability assay to determine if
modifications in the gene encoding MMP for expression in mammalian cells altered 
its capacity to elicit development of CD8 CTL, essential for its use in a
peptide-based vaccine. Monocyte-depleted PBMC (mdPBMC) were stimulated with
antigen-presenting cells (APC) pulsed with different MMP constructs. CD4 and CD8 
T cells proliferated in response to stimulation with MMP (control) expressed in
Escherichia coli (eMMP), tPA-MMP, and tPA-MMP-2mut. CD8 T cells retained the
capacity to kill intracellular bacteria. The tPA-MMP-5mut failed to elicit a
proliferative response and was not included in further studies. The data show
that the expression cassettes containing MMP and MMP-2mut can be used to screen
and select a mammalian expression vector for the development of an efficacious
peptide-based vaccine against Ptb.
