A 23-year-old man presented with severe contact lens-associated keratitis and
descemetocele with pre-existing drug therapy. After 1 week of intensive
antibiotic treatment Aspergillus fumigatus was identified. Despite adjusted
antimycotic treatment a corneal perforation occurred. Due to peripheral scleral
infiltration the cornea was primarily closed with a double layer amniotic
membrane in order to avoid a sclerokeratoplasty with a bad prognosis. After 2
weeks the peripheral corneal situation stabilized and a simple keratoplasty á
chaud could be performed. After surgery and adjusted drug therapy, no adequate
signs of recovery occured. In repeated microbiological testing an additional
Candida albicans infection was diagnosed and therapy was readjusted. This
resulted in a cure of the corneal infection. After 5 years and a re-keratoplasty 
the patient presented with a clear corneal transplant and a corrected visual
acuity of 20/25.
