Endotoxin, cellular function, and nutrient blood flow.

Asher EF, Garrison RN, Ratcliffe DJ, Fry DE.

To study the effects of endotoxemia on hepatic mitochondrial function and
nutrient blood flow, rats were given intraperitoneal Escherichia coli endotoxin
at a lethal dose for 90% mortality of group. Controls received only diluent. Five
hours after the onset of endotoxemia, paired experimental and control animals had
indocyanine green (ICG) clearance determined as the half-life (t1/2) at low (5
mg/kg) or high (15 mg/kg) doses. Low-dose ICG clearance represented hepatic
nutrient blood flow; a Lineweaver-Burke plot of clearance rate v dose of
administration provided extrapolation to an infinite dose and served as a
sensitive indicator of hepatocellular function. Additional endotoxic rats were
killed at five hours, liver and kidney mitochondria were isolated, and isolates
were studied by the polarographic technique; the respiratory control index was
determined as a sensitive indicator of efficient cellular oxygen metabolism with 
glutamate and succinate as substrates. Our data indicated that (1) uncoupling of 
the mitochondrial function is not identified during the early phase of
endotoxemia, (2) reduced nutrient blood flow occurs during this early phase of
endotoxemia, and (3) subsequent cellular abnormalities in endotoxemia may be
secondary to ischemia and not direct cellular injury.
