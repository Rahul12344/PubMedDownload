Conditional gene expression systems are useful tools for studying the role of
essential or toxic gene products in bacterial systems. There is a paucity of such
systems available for use in the mycobacteria. The utility of the Escherichia
coli arabinose-inducible system was looked into, since it is tightly controlled
in response to the presence of arabinose and glucose. It was demonstrated that
the P(BAD) promoter can be used to express heterologous genes in Mycobacterium
smegmatis. Expression of a lacZ reporter gene demonstrated that promoter activity
was inducible in response to the presence of glucose, but only on solid medium.
This system was utilized to study the functional consequences of expressing one
member of a putative toxin-antitoxin pair (Rv1991c). Rv1991c has homology with a 
number of bacterial toxins, including ChpK, MazF and PemK. A potential antitoxin 
gene has been identified, adjacent to Rv1991c in the genome, which was
coexpressed with the toxin. Expression of the toxin alone inhibited the growth of
E. coli, whereas coexpression with the antitoxin did not. Expression of Rv1991c
also led to a marked reduction of cell viability in M. smegmatis, confirming its 
role as a potent toxin.
