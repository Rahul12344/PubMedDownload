CXC Chemokine Ligand 8 (CXCL8) plays an important role in gastric inflammation
and in the progression of gastric cancer induced by Helicobacter pylori (H.
pylori) infection. The association of CXCL8, CXC Chemokine Receptor 1 (CXCR1),
and CXC Chemokine Receptor 2 (CXCR2) polymorphisms with H. pylori infection and
gastric cancer progression needs to be investigated in a population within an
enigma area consisting of multiple ethnicities, such as Thailand. To analyze the 
relative risk of H. pylori infection and gastric cancer among Thai gastroduodenal
patients, gene polymorphisms in CXCL8 (promoter region -251) and in CXCR1 and
CXCR2 (receptors for CXCL8) were detected by polymerase chain
reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and allele
specific-PCR (AS-PCR). We also determined the presence of cytotoxin-associated
gene A (cagA) in Thai patients with H. pylori infection. Correlation between the 
CXCL8 (-251) polymorphism and CXCL8 gene expression was evaluated by quantitative
reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR). We found a significant association between
the T/A and A/A genotypes of CXCL8 (-251) with H.Â pylori infection. However, no
significant correlation was found between the CXCR1 (+2607) and CXCR2 (+1208)
gene polymorphisms with H. pylori infection among Thai gastroduodenal subjects.
Within the H. pylori-infected group of Thai gastroduodenal patients, no
significant differences in cagA were observed. In addition, the A/A genotype of
CXCL8 (-251) significantly correlated with the risk of gastric cancer and
correlated with higher CXCL8 gene expression levels in Thai gastroduodenal
patients. These results suggest that CXCL8 (-251) polymorphisms are associated
with H. pylori infection, an increased risk of stronger inflammatory responses,
and gastric cancer in Thai gastroduodenal patients.
