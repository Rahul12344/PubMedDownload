Novel hyper-resistant bacteria were isolated from the Crven Dol mine (Allchar,
North Macedonia), arsenic-rich extreme environment. Bacteria were recovered from 
a secondary mineral mixture, an alteration of hydrothermal realgar rich in
arsenates (pharmacolite, hornesite, and talmessite). The sample was recovered
from the dark part of the mine at 28 m depth. Three bacterial strains and a
bacterial consortium were isolated for their capacity to survive exposure to 32
g/L (209 mM) of arsenite, and 176 g/L (564 mM) of arsenate. The 16S rRNA gene
analysis identified bacterial isolates as Stenotrophomonas sp. and two
Microbacterium spp. This analysis also revealed that bacterial consortium
comprise two Bacteriodetes exhibiting similarity to Olivibacter ginsengisoli and 
to uncultured bacterium, and one γ-proteobacteria with similarity to Luteimonas
sp. Among all isolates Stenotrophomonas sp. exhibited the highest tolerance to As
compound as well as the capacity to accumulate As inside the cells. Analysis of
genes involved in As-resistance showed that recovered isolates possess the genes 
encoding the ArsB, Acr3(1) and Acr3(2) proteins, indicating that at least a part 
of their resistance could be ascribed to As-efflux systems described in isolates 
obtained from human-polluted environments.
