The oral microbiome can play a role in the instigation and progression of oral
diseases that can manifest into other systemic conditions. These associations
encourage the exploration of oral dysbiosis leading to the pathogenesis of
cancers. In this study, oral rinse was used to characterize the oral microbiome
fluctuation associated with oral cavity cancer (OCC) and oropharyngeal cancers
(OPC). The study cohort consists of normal healthy controls (n = 10, between 20
and 30 years of age; n = 10, above 50 years of age), high-risk individuals (n =
11, above 50 years of age with bad oral hygiene and/or oral diseases) and OCC and
OPC patients (n = 31, HPV-positive; n = 21, HPV-negative). Oral rinse samples
were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing on the MiSeq platform.
Kruskal-Wallis rank test was used to identify genera associated with OCC and OPC.
A logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine the performance of
these genera as a biomarker panel to predict OCC and OPC. In addition, a two-fold
cross-validation with a bootstrap procedure was carried out in R to investigate
how well the panel would perform in an emulated clinical scenario. Our data
indicate that the oral microbiome is able to predict the presence of OCC and OPC 
with sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 90%, respectively. With further
validation, the panel could potentially be implemented into clinical diagnostic
and prognostic workflows for OCC and OPC.
