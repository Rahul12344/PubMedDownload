BACKGROUND: Apical periodontitis includes periapical granulomas and radicular
cysts, which are histologically distinguished by the absence and the presence of 
an epithelial lining, respectively. The main cause of apical periodontitis is the
bacterial colonization of the root canal space. This research aimed at assessing 
whether and how periapical granulomas and radicular cysts differ in terms of
microbiota using high throughput amplicon target sequencing (HTS) techniques.
METHODS: This study included 5 cases of Periapical Granulomas (PGs) and 5 cases
of Radicular Cysts (RCs) selected on the base of histology out of 37 patients
from January 2015 to February 2016. Complete medical history, panoramic
radiograms (OPTs) and histologic records of each patient were assessed. Only
lesions greater than 1 cm in diameter and developed in proximity to teeth with
bad prognosis were included. The microbiota present in periapical granulomas and 
radicular cysts thus retrieved was finely characterized by pyrosequencing of the 
16S rRNA genes.
RESULTS: The core of OTUs shared between periapical granulomas and radicular
cysts was dominated by the presence of facultative anaerobes taxa such as:
Lactococcus lactis, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus warneri,
Acinetobacter johnsonii and Gemellales. L. lactis, the main OTUs of the entire
datasets, was associated with periapical granuloma samples. Consistently with
literature, the anaerobic taxa detected were most abundant in radicular cyst
samples. Indeed, a higher abundance of presumptive predicted metabolic pathways
related to Lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis was found in radicular cyst samples.
CONCLUSIONS: The present pilot study confirmed the different microbial
characterization of the two main apical periodontitis types and shade light on
the possible role of L. lactis in periapical granulomas.
