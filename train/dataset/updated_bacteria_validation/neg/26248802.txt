The chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 are important pharmaceutical targets due 
to their key roles in inflammatory diseases and cancer progression. We have
previously identified
2-[5-(4-fluoro-phenylcarbamoyl)-pyridin-2-ylsulfanylmethyl]-phenylboronic acid
(SX-517) and 6-(2-boronic
acid-5-trifluoromethoxy-benzylsulfanyl)-N-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-nicotinamide (SX-576)
as potent non-competitive boronic acid-containing CXCR1/2 antagonists. Herein we 
report the synthesis and evaluation of aminopyridine and aminopyrimidine analogs 
of SX-517 and SX-576, identifying (2-{(benzyl)[(5-boronic
acid-2-pyridyl)methyl]amino}-5-pyrimidinyl)(4-fluorophenylamino)formaldehyde as a
potent chemokine antagonist with improved aqueous solubility and oral
bioavailability.
