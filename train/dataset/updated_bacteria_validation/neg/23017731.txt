Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a subset of innate-like lymphocytes
that recognize glycolipid antigens bound by the major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC)-class-I-related protein CD1d. iNKT cells are activated early during a
variety of infections and inflammatory diseases and contribute to the subsequent 
development of adaptive immune responses. Consequently, iNKT cells play a
critical role in the development and resolution of inflammatory diseases and
represent attractive targets for the development of immunotherapies. Recent
studies have provided important insight into the mechanisms by which iNKT cells
become activated in response to diverse inflammatory stimuli. These new findings 
should be instrumental to promote the immunomodulatory properties of iNKT cells
for treatment of inflammatory diseases.
