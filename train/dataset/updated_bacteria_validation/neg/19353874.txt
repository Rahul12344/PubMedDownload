The performance and membrane fouling of submerged membrane bioreactor were
studied in the case of active sludge bulking under low temperature. The factors
contributing to membrane fouling were discussed from the microorganism aspect.
The results showed that COD removal efficiencies of supernatant and permeate were
85% and 92% respectively and filamentous sludge bulking had little impact on
them. The sludge settleability became bad and the filament index (FI) increased
from 2 to 5 during the formation of filamentous sludge bulking under low
temperature. The filamentous bacteria extending from the sludge flocs formed net 
structure. Membrane fouling changed with time in linear under low temperature and
the operation period of MBR was 15 d. However, membrane fouling was more serious 
in the condition of filamentous sludge bulking at low temperature, shortening the
operation period of MBR to 7 d. The extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)
content of bulking sludge was three times as that of normal sludge and the
relative hydrophobicity (RH) of sludge flocs was decreased as FI increased. The
increase of EPS and RH may cause more materials to deposit on the membrane
surface, thus the membrane fouling rate improved and the operation period of MBR 
became short. Further analysis indicated that the mixed liquid viscosity, Zeta
potential and sludge floc structure were all important factors of membrane
fouling.
