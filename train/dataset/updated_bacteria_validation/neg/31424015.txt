Tigecycline is a reserve antibiotic increasingly used for the treatment of
multidrug-resistant bacteria, especially Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter 
baumannii. At present, there are concerns regarding the testing and
interpretation of tigecycline susceptibility to bugs such as K. pneumoniae and A.
baumannii, which limit clinicians in appropriate usage. Use of appropriate method
for testing such as broth microdilution is essential. In addition, tigecycline
susceptibility testing is a challenge due to inconsistent results from various
antimicrobial susceptibility testing automated platforms. There is a great need
to define a suitable methodology along with interpretive criteria, especially for
K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii. The European Committee on Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
breakpoints show wide variation and are defined for different set of organisms.
Non-species-related pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) breakpoints defined
by the EUCAST can be used for organisms such as K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii.
