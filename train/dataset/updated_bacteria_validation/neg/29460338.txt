Endometriosis affects women of reproductive age via unclear immunological
mechanism(s). Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous group 
of myeloid cells with potent immunosuppressive and angiogenic properties. Here,
we found MDSCs significantly increased in the peripheral blood of patients with
endometriosis and in the peritoneal cavity of a mouse model of surgically induced
endometriosis. Majority of MDSCs were granulocytic, produced ROS, and arginase,
and suppressed T-cell proliferation. Depletion of MDSCs by antiGr-1 antibody
dramatically suppressed development of endometrial lesions in mice. The
chemokines CXCL1, 2, and 5 were expressed at sites of lesion while MDSCs
expressed CXCR-2. These CXC-chemokines promoted MDSC migration toward
endometriotic implants both in vitro and in vivo. Also, CXCR2-deficient mice show
significantly decreased MDSC induction, endometrial lesions, and angiogenesis.
Importantly, adoptive transfer of MDSCs into CXCR2-KO mice restored endometriotic
growth and angiogenesis. Together, this study demonstrates that MDSCs play a role
in the pathogenesis of endometriosis and identifies a novel CXC-chemokine and
receptor for the recruitment of MDSCs, thereby providing a potential target for
endometriosis treatment.
