Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infections are not reportable in Germany and limited
data on prevalence are available. CT screening has been offered free of charge to
pregnant women since 1995 and to all women under 25 years since 2008. For
symptomatic women and men, diagnostic testing is covered by statutory health
insurance. We describe the establishment of a nationwide, laboratory-based,
voluntary sentinel that electronically collects information on all performed CT
tests with test results, test reason and patient information. The sentinel
represents one third of all performed CT tests in Germany. In the period from
2008 to 2014, 3,877,588 CT tests were reported, 93% in women. Women aged 20-24
years and men aged 25-29 years were the most frequently tested age groups. The
overall proportion of positive tests (PPT) among women was 3.9% and among men
11.0%. The highest PPT among women was in the age groups 15-19 (6.8%) and 20-24
years (5.9%), and among men in the age groups 20-24 (19.2%), 15-19 (15.4%) and
25-29 years (14.8%). The PPT for CT was high among women and men younger than 25 
years. Prevention is urgently needed. Monitoring of CT infection in Germany
should be continued.
