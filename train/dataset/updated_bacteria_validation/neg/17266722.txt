Campylobacter jejuni is a common cause of bacterial enteritis. The surface
capsular polysaccharides are important for this bacterium to survive in the
environment, but little is known about their involvement in bacterium-host
interactions. This study showed that the C. jejuni capsular polysaccharides play 
an important role in adherence to and invasion of human embryonic epithelial
cells. However, no significant role of capsular polysaccharides was shown in
colonization of the chicken gut.
