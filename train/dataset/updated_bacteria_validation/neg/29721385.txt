Prognosis of ovarian cancer is associated with effector memory CD8+ T cell
accumulation in ascites, CXCL9 levels and activation-triggered signal
transduction in T cells.

The accumulation of intratumoral CD8+ T cells is associated with the survival of 
high grade serous ovarian carcinoma patients, but it is unclear which CD8+ T cell
subsets contribute to this effect and how they are affected by the peritoneal
tumor microenvironment. Here, we provide evidence for a functional link between
long relapse-free survival, accumulation of CD8+ effector memory T (TEM) cells in
peritoneal effusion (ascites), and the level of the CD8+ TEM attracting chemokine
CXCL9, produced by macrophages as a major source. We also propose a novel
mechanism by which the tumor microenvironment could contribute to T cell
dysfunction and shorter survival, i.e., diminished expression levels of essential
signaling proteins, including STAT5B, PLCγ1 and NFATc2. CD8+ TEM cells in
ascites, CXCL9 levels and the expression of crucial signal transduction proteins 
may therefore be important biomarkers to gauge the efficiency of immune therapies
and potentially represent therapeutic targets.
