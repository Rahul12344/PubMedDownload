Phagocytes restrict the germination of Aspergillus fumigatus conidia and prevent 
the establishment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in immunecompetent mice.
Here we report that immunecompetent mice recovering from a primary A. fumigatus
challenge are protected against a secondary lethal challenge. Using RAGγc
knock-out mice we show that this protection is independent of T, B and NK cells. 
In protected mice, lung phagocytes are recruited more rapidly and are more
efficient in conidial phagocytosis and killing. Protection was also associated
with an enhanced expression of CXCR2 and Dectin-1 on bone marrow phagocytes. We
also show that protective lung cytokine and chemokine responses are induced more 
rapidly and with enhanced dynamics in protected mice. Our findings support the
hypothesis that following a first encounter with a non-lethal dose of A.
fumigatus conidia, the innate immune system is primed and can mediate protection 
against a secondary lethal infection.
