Utilization of relatively low-cost modification of Fenton reaction for the
elimination of selected antibiotics and resistant coliforms in different part of 
wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was studied. The concentration of antibiotics
and occurrence of resistant gems in different stages of WWTP in the capital city 
of Slovakia - Bratislava was analyzed by LC-MS/MS technique. Consequently,
Fenton-like reaction was applied for the elimination of chemical and biological
contaminants. Comparative study with classical Fenton reaction was also done.
Very high concentrations of clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin and azithromycin in
influent water were found. Coliform bacteria were predominantly resistant to
ampicillin, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. After the mechanical stage, the
concentration of antibiotics in water was significantly decreased because of the 
sorption during this step. Biological step degraded 12 types of antibiotics.
Analyses of effluent water showed very bad elimination of azithromycin (919ng/L) 
and clarithromycin (684ng/L). Contrary, ciprofloxacin was removed with very high 
efficiency (95%). The number of resistant bacteria was also significantly
decreased in effluent water. In the case of Escherichia coli only ampicillin and 
gentamicin resistance bacteria were detected. Our results show that antibiotics
as well as resistant bacteria were eliminated by the modification of classical
Fenton reaction with high efficiency. The modification of the Fenton reaction can
decrease the process wages, environmental impact. Moreover, the degradation
process was easily controlled, monitored and tuned.
