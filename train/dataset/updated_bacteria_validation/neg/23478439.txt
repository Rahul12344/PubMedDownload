For different reasons, the amount of food loss for developing and developed
countries is approximately equivalent. Altogether, these losses represent
approximately 1/3 of the global food production. Significant amounts of
pasteurised milk are lost due to bad smell and unpleasant taste. Currently, even 
under the best cold chain conditions, psychrotolerant spore-forming bacteria,
some of which also harbour virulent factors, limit the shelf life of pasteurised 
milk. N2 gas-based flushing has recently been of interest for improving the
quality of raw milk. Here, we evaluated the possibility of addressing bacterial
growth in pasteurised milk during cold storage at 6 °C and 8 °C. Clearly, the
treatments hindered bacterial growth, in a laboratory setting, when N2-treated
milk were compared to the corresponding controls, which suggests that N2-flushing
treatment constitutes a promising option to extend the shelf life of pasteurised 
milk.
