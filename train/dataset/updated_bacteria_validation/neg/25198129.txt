Some pathogenic spore-forming bacilli employ a binary protein mechanism for
intoxicating the intestinal tracts of insects, animals, and humans. These
Gram-positive bacteria and their toxins include Clostridium botulinum (C2 toxin),
Clostridium difficile (C. difficile toxin or CDT), Clostridium perfringens
(Î¹-toxin and binary enterotoxin, or BEC), Clostridium spiroforme (C. spiroforme
toxin or CST), as well as Bacillus cereus (vegetative insecticidal protein or
VIP). These gut-acting proteins form an AB complex composed of ADP-ribosyl
transferase (A) and cell-binding (B) components that intoxicate cells via
receptor-mediated endocytosis and endosomal trafficking. Once inside the cytosol,
the A components inhibit normal cell functions by mono-ADP-ribosylation of
globular actin, which induces cytoskeletal disarray and death. Important aspects 
of each bacterium and binary enterotoxin will be highlighted in this review, with
particular focus upon the disease process involving the biochemistry and modes of
action for each toxin.
