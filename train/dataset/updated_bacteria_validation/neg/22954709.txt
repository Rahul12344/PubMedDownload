Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been shown to accelerate atherosclerosis and to
increase the prevalence of IL-4-producing natural killer T (NKT) cells in various
tissues. However, the role of NKT cells in the development of LPS-induced
atherosclerotic lesions has not been fully tested in NKT cell-deficient mice.
Here, we examined the lesion development in apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE-KO)
mice and apoE-KO mice on an NKT cell-deficient, CD1d knockout (CD1d-KO)
background (apoE-CD1d double knockout; DKO). LPS (0.5 μg/g body weight/wk) or
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was intraperitoneally administered to apoE-KO and
DKO mice (8-wk old) for 5 wk and atherosclerotic lesion areas were quantified
thereafter. Consistent with prior reports, NKT cell-deficient DKO mice showed
milder atherosclerotic lesions than apoE-KO mice. Notably, LPS administration
significantly increased the lesion size in apoE-KO, but not in DKO mice, compared
to PBS controls. Our findings suggest that LPS, and possibly LPS-producing
bacteria, aggravate the development of atherosclerosis primarily through NKT cell
activation and subsequent collaboration with NK cells.
