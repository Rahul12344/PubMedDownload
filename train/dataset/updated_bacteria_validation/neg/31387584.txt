BACKGROUND: Acetyl-CoA is an important metabolic intermediate and serves as an
acetylation precursor for the biosynthesis of various value-added
acetyl-chemicals. Acetyl-CoA can be produced from glucose, acetate, or fatty
acids via metabolic pathways in Escherichia coli. Although glucose is an
efficient carbon source for acetyl-CoA production, the pathway from acetate to
acetyl-CoA is the shortest and fatty acids can produce acetyl-CoA through fatty
acid oxidation along with abundant NADH and FADH2. In this study, metabolically
engineered E. coli strains for efficiently supplying acetyl-CoA from glucose,
acetate, and fatty acid were constructed and applied in one-step biosynthesis of 
N-acetylglutamate (NAG) from glutamate and acetyl-CoA.
RESULTS: A metabolically engineered E. coli strain for NAG production was
constructed by overexpressing N-acetylglutamate synthase from Kitasatospora setae
in E. coli BW25113 with argB and argA knockout. The strain was further engineered
to utilize glucose, acetate, and fatty acid to produce acetyl-CoA. When glucose
was used as a carbon source, the combined mutants of ∆ptsG::glk, ∆galR::zglf,
∆poxB::acs, ∆ldhA, and ∆pta were more efficient for supplying acetyl-CoA. The
acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) pathway and acetate kinase-phosphate
acetyltransferase (ACK-PTA) pathway from acetate to acetyl-CoA were investigated,
and the ACK-PTA pathway showed to be more efficient for supplying acetyl-CoA.
When fatty acid was used as a carbon source, acetyl-CoA supply was improved by
deletion of fadR and constitutive expression of fadD under the strong promoter
CPA1. Comparison of acetyl-CoA supply from glucose, acetate and palmitic acid
revealed that a higher conversion rate of glutamate (98.2%) and productivity (an 
average of 6.25 mmol/L/h) were obtained when using glucose as a carbon source.
The results also demonstrated the great potential of acetate and fatty acid to
supply acetyl-CoA, as the molar conversion rate of glutamate was more than 80%.
CONCLUSIONS: Metabolically engineered E. coli strains were developed for NAG
production. The metabolic pathways of acetyl-CoA from glucose, acetate, or fatty 
acid were optimized for efficient acetyl-CoA supply to enhance NAG production.
The metabolic strategies for efficient acetyl-CoA supply used in this study can
be exploited for other chemicals that use acetyl-CoA as a precursor or when
acetylation is involved.
