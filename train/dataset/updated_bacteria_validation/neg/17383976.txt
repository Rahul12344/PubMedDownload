Two regions in xylanase A from Bacillus halodurans C-125 (XynA), an alkaliphilic 
xylanase, were identified to be responsible for its activity at basic pH by
comparing the dissociation constants of the XynA proton donor Glu residue (pK(e2)
and pK(es2)) with those of xylanase B from Clostridium stercorarium F9 (XynB) and
their mutants constructed by substituting either Ser137/Asn127 of XynA/XynB or
the 4th loop, designed based on the structural difference close to the proton
donor. The substitution of XynB at Asn127 into Ser increased pK(e2) by 0.37. The 
effect is explained that the positive charge of His126 likely affects the proton 
donor via Asn127 and a water molecule in XynB, resulting in a decrease in pK(e2),
whereas such interactions were not observed with Ser. The substitution of XynB at
the 4th loop into XynA (XynB Loop4A) increased the pK(e2) and pK(es2) values by
0.29 and 0.62, respectively. The effect of the 4th loop in XynA is likely due to 
a hydrogen bond between Asp199 in the loop and Tyr239, which interacts with both 
the proton donors Glu195 and Arg204, with flexibility of the loop. Both the
mutations independently affected the increases in pK(e2).
