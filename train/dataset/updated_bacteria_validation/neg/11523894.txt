Arsenical resistance is important to bioleaching microorganisms because these
organisms release arsenic from minerals such as arsenopyrite during bioleaching. 
The acidophile Acidithiobacillus caldus KU was found to be resistant to the
arsenical ions arsenate, arsenite, and antimony via an inducible, chromosomally
encoded resistance mechanism. Because no apparent alteration of the toxic ions
was observed, Acidithiobacillus (At.) caldus was tested to determine if it was
resistant as a result of decreased accumulation of toxic ions. Reduced
accumulation of arsenate and arsenite by induced At. caldus cells supported this 
hypothesis. It was also found that, with the addition of an energy source,
induced At. caldus could transport arsenate and arsenite out of the cell against 
a concentration gradient. The lack of efflux in the absence of an added energy
source and in the presence of inhibitors suggested that efflux was energy
dependent. Induced At. caldus also expressed arsenate reductase activity,
indicating that At. caldus has an arsenical resistance mechanism that is
analogous to previously described systems from other Bacteria. Southern
hybridization analysis showed that At. caldus and other gram-negative acidophiles
carry an Escherichia coli arsB homologue on the chromosome.
