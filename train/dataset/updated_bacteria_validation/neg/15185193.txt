Antimicrobial resistance has been the subject of this and numerous other special 
issues of pediatric and infectious disease journals during the past several
years. Pediatricians may be forgiven for expressing skepticism occasionally about
dour scenarios predicting the advent of untreatable infections or a return to the
preantibiotic era. Certainly, some benefits may accrue to pharmaceutical
companies, academic and public health experts, and managed care systems from
promoting concern about antimicrobial resistance. In fact, the response to the
spread of resistance has been forceful, and in some cases successful, with
reductions achieved in unnecessary prescribing, treatment regimens modified, and 
some new antimicrobial agents made available during the past several years. The
problem, however, remains substantial, as several clear examples of dangerous and
nearly untreatable multiply resistant organisms exist and the costs associated
with treating resistant organisms continue to skyrocket. In many instances in the
developing world, antimicrobial resistance can mean that a formerly treatable
infection has become untreatable, and for pediatricians in the United States,
resistance has, at the least, complicated therapy and limited options in everyday
practice.
