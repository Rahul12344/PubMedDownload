Disruption of circadian regulation was recently shown to cause diabetes and
metabolic disease. We have previously demonstrated that retinal lipid metabolism 
contributed to the development of diabetic retinopathy. The goal of this study
was to determine the effect of diabetes on circadian regulation of clock genes
and lipid metabolism genes in the retina and retinal endothelial cells (REC).
Diabetes had a pronounced inhibitory effect on the negative clock arm with lower 
amplitude of the period (per) 1 in the retina; lower amplitude and a phase shift 
of per2 in the liver; and a loss of cryptochrome (cry) 2 rhythmic pattern in
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The positive clock arm was increased by diabetes
with higher amplitude of circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) and
brain and muscle aryl-hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like 1 (bmal1)
and phase shift in bmal1 rhythmic oscillations in the retina; and higher bmal1
amplitude in the SCN. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α
exhibited rhythmic oscillation in retina and liver; PPARγ had lower amplitude in 
diabetic liver; sterol regulatory element-binding protein (srebp) 1c had higher
amplitude in the retina but lower in the liver in STZ- induced diabetic animals. 
Both of Elongase (Elovl) 2 and Elovl4 had a rhythmic oscillation pattern in the
control retina. Diabetic retinas lost Elovl4 rhythmic oscillation and had lower
amplitude of Elovl2 oscillations. In line with the in vivo data, circadian
expression levels of CLOCK, bmal1 and srebp1c had higher amplitude in rat REC
(rREC) isolated from diabetic rats compared with control rats, while PPARγ and
Elovl2 had lower amplitude in diabetic rREC. In conclusion, diabetes causes
dysregulation of circadian expression of clock genes and the genes controlling
lipid metabolism in the retina with potential implications for the development of
diabetic retinopathy.
