Bacterial meningitis is a deadly disease most commonly caused by Streptococcus
pneumoniae, leading to severe neurological sequelae including cerebral edema,
seizures, stroke, and mortality when untreated. Meningitis is initiated by the
transfer of S. pneumoniae from blood to the brain across the blood-cerebrospinal 
fluid barrier or the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The underlying mechanisms are
still poorly understood. Current treatment strategies include adjuvant
dexamethasone for inflammation and cerebral edema, followed by antibiotics. The
success of dexamethasone is however inconclusive, necessitating new therapies for
controlling edema, the primary reason for neurological complications. Since we
have previously shown a general activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1α)
in bacterial infections, we hypothesized that HIF-1α, via induction of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is involved in transmigration of pathogens
across the BBB. In human, murine meningitis brain samples, HIF-1α activation was 
observed by immunohistochemistry. S. pneumoniae infection in brain endothelial
cells (EC) resulted in in vitro upregulation of HIF-1α/VEGF (Western
blotting/qRT-PCR) associated with increased paracellular permeability
(fluorometry, impedance measurements). This was supported by bacterial
localization at cell-cell junctions in vitro and in vivo in brain ECs from mouse 
and humans (confocal, super-resolution, electron microscopy, live-cell imaging). 
Hematogenously infected mice showed increased permeability, S. pneumoniae
deposition in the brain, along with upregulation of genes in the HIF-1α/VEGF
pathway (RNA sequencing of brain microvessels). Inhibition of HIF-1α with
echinomycin, siRNA in bEnd5 cells or using primary brain ECs from HIF-1α
knock-out mice revealed reduced endothelial permeability and transmigration of S.
pneumoniae. Therapeutic rescue using the HIF-1α inhibitor echinomycin resulted in
increased survival and improvement of BBB function in S. pneumoniae-infected
mice. We thus demonstrate paracellular migration of bacteria across BBB and a
critical role for HIF-1α/VEGF therein and hence propose targeting this pathway to
prevent BBB dysfunction and ensuing brain damage in infections.
