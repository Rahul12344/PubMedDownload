Originally identified as a low molecular weight acid phosphatase, LMW-PTP is
actually a protein tyrosine phosphatase that acts on many
phosphotyrosine-containing cellular proteins that are primarily involved in
signal transduction. Differences in sequence, structure, and substrate
recognition as well as in subcellular localization in different organisms enable 
LMW-PTP to exert many different functions. In fact, during evolution, the LMW-PTP
structure adapted to perform different catalytic actions depending on the
organism type. In bacteria, this enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of group 
1 and 4 capsules, but it is also a virulence factor in pathogenic strains. In
yeast, LMW-PTPs dephosphorylate immunophilin Fpr3, a peptidyl-prolyl-cis-trans
isomerase member of the protein chaperone family. In humans, LMW-PTP is encoded
by the ACP1 gene, which is composed of three different alleles, each encoding two
active enzymes produced by alternative RNA splicing. In animals, LMW-PTP
dephosphorylates a number of growth factor receptors and modulates their
signalling processes. The involvement of LMW-PTP in cancer progression and in
insulin receptor regulation as well as its actions as a virulence factor in a
number of pathogenic bacterial strains may promote the search for potent,
selective and bioavailable LMW-PTP inhibitors.
