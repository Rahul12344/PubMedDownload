The Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi is the only known human pathogen
that directly activates invariant NKT (iNKT) cells. The number and activation
kinetics of iNKT cells vary greatly among different strains of mice. We now
report the role of the iNKT cell response in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease
using C57BL/6 mice, a strain with optimal iNKT cell activation that is resistant 
to the development of spirochetal-induced inflammation. During experimental
infection of B6 mice with B. burgdorferi, iNKT cells localize to the inflamed
heart where they are activated by CD1d-expressing macrophages. Activation of iNKT
cells in vivo results in the production of IFN-gamma, which we demonstrate
ameliorates the severity of murine Lyme carditis by at least two mechanisms.
First, IFN-gamma enhances the recognition of B. burgdorferi by macrophages,
leading to increased phagocytosis of the spirochete. Second, IFN-gamma activation
of macrophages increases the surface expression of CD1d, thereby facilitating
further iNKT activation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that in the resistant
background, B6, iNKT cells modulate the severity of murine Lyme carditis through 
the action of IFN-gamma, which appears to self-renew through a positive feedback 
loop during infection.
