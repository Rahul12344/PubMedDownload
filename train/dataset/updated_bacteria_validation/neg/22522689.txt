Autotransporters are a large family of virulence factors of Gram-negative
bacterial pathogens. The autotransporter adhesin involved in diffuse adherence
(AIDA-I) is an outer membrane protein of Escherichia coli, which allows binding
to epithelial cells as well as the autoaggregation of bacteria. AIDA-I is
glycosylated by a specific heptosyltransferase encoded by the aah gene that forms
an operon with the aidA gene. aidA is highly prevalent in strains that cause
disease in pigs. Nevertheless, there are only two published whole-length
sequences for this gene. In this study, we sequenced the aah and aidA genes of 24
aidA-positive porcine strains harboring distinct virulence factor profiles. We
compared the obtained sequences and performed phylogenetic and pulsed-field
electrophoresis analyses. Our results suggest that there are at least 3 different
alleles for aidA, which are associated with distinct virulence factor profiles.
The genes are found on high-molecular-weight plasmids and seem to evolve via
shuffling mechanisms, with one of the sequences showing evidence of genetic
recombination. Our work suggests that genetic plasticity allows the evolution of 
aah-aidA alleles that are selected during pathogenesis.
