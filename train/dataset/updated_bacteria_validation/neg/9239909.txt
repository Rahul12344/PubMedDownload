BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections in children are associated with functional
and anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract, they tend to recur and can
cause permanent kidney damage.
AIM: To study in children with urinary tract infections, microbiological factors 
associated to recurrence, functional and anatomical abnormalities of the urinary 
tract.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective sample of children was incorporated into a
follow-up protocol after their first episode of bacteriologically-demonstrated
urinary tract infection. In all patients an abdominal ultrasound examination and 
a mictional urethrocystography were done and the presence of fimbriae was studied
in isolated strains of Escherichia coli.
RESULTS: Two hundred fifteen cases bad an adequate adherence to the study
protocol, 190 caused by E coli. Fimbriated E coli strains were isolated with
greater frequency from children with pyelonephritis than from those with a low
urinary tract infection (50 and 28% respectively). The absence of fimbriae in E
coli strains was associated with a higher risk of recurrent infections (odds
ratio = 3, confidence intervals = 2-9.2) and an abnormal urethrocystography (odds
ratio = 3, confidence intervals = 1.1-10.2).
CONCLUSIONS: These data are consistent with foreign reports and support the need 
to study adhesins in E coli strains isolated from children with urinary tract
infections.
