Neutrophils are involved in the alveolitis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
(IPF). However, their pathogenic mechanisms are still poorly understood.
Nintedanib has antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory activity in IPF. This study
aimed to investigate the regulatory mechanism of nintedanib on neutrophil
chemotaxis in bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Nintedanib was
administered via oral gavage to male C57BL/6 mice 24 h after a bleomycin
intratracheal injection (1.5 U/kg). Lung histopathological findings, the
expression of cytokines, and the regulatory signaling pathways of neutrophil
chemotaxis were analyzed. The effect of nintedanib was also investigated in a
mouse model with adoptive neutrophil transfer in vivo. Nintedanib significantly
decreased the histopathological changes and neutrophil recruitment in BLM-induced
pulmonary fibrosis. Nintedanib mediated a downregulation of chemokine (C-X-C
motif) receptor 2 (CXCR2) and very late antigen 4 (VLA-4) expression, as well as 
an upregulation of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) activity in
peripheral blood neutrophils in BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Nintedanib also
decreased the activation of endothelial cells by the decreased expression of
vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). The effect of nintedanib on
regulating neutrophil chemotaxis was also confirmed by a mouse model with
adoptive neutrophil transfer in vivo. In conclusion, nintedanib reduces
neutrophil chemotaxis and endothelial cell activation to regulate the severity of
BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis. These effects are associated with an enhancement 
of GRK2 activity and a reduction in CXCR2 and VLA-4 expression on neutrophils and
a decrease in VCAM-1 expression on endothelial cells.
