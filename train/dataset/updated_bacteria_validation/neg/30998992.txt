BACKGROUND & AIMS: Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a precursor to esophageal
adenocarcinoma (EAC). Progression from BE to cancer is associated with obesity,
possibly due to increased abdominal pressure and gastroesophageal reflux disease,
although this pathogenic mechanism has not been proven. We investigated whether
environmental or dietary factors associated with obesity contribute to the
progression of BE to EAC in mice.
METHODS: Tg(ED-L2-IL1RN/IL1B)#Tcw mice (a model of BE, called L2-IL1B mice) were 
fed a chow (control) or high-fat diet (HFD) or were crossbred with mice that
express human interleukin (IL) 8 (L2-IL1B/IL8 mice). Esophageal tissues were
collected and analyzed for gene expression profiles and by quantitative
polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry. Organoids
were established from BE tissue of mice and cultured with serum from lean or
obese individuals or with neutrophils from L2-IL1B mice. Feces from mice were
analyzed by 16s ribosomal RNA sequencing and compared to 16s sequencing data from
patients with dysplasia or BE. L2-IL1B were mice raised in germ-free conditions.
RESULTS: L2-IL1B mice fed an HFD developed esophageal dysplasia and tumors more
rapidly than mice fed the control diet; the speed of tumor development was
independent of body weight. The acceleration of dysplasia by the HFD in the
L2-IL1B mice was associated with a shift in the gut microbiota and an increased
ratio of neutrophils to natural killer cells in esophageal tissues compared with 
mice fed a control diet. We observed similar differences in the microbiomes from 
patients with BE that progressed to EAC vs patients with BE that did not develop 
into cancer. Tissues from dysplasias of L2-IL1B mice fed the HFD contained
increased levels of cytokines that are produced in response to CXCL1 (the
functional mouse homolog of IL8, also called KC). Serum from obese patients
caused organoids from L2-IL1B/IL8 mice to produce IL8. BE tissues from L2-IL1B
mice fed the HFD and from L2-IL1B/IL8 mice contained increased numbers of myeloid
cells and cells expressing Cxcr2 and Lgr5 messenger RNAs (epithelial progenitors)
compared with mice fed control diets. BE tissues from L2-IL1B mice raised in
germ-free housing had fewer progenitor cells and developed less dysplasia than in
L2-IL1 mice raised under standard conditions; exposure of fecal microbiota from
L2-IL1B mice fed the HFD to L2-IL1B mice fed the control diet accelerated tumor
development.
CONCLUSIONS: In a mouse model of BE, we found that an HFD promoted dysplasia by
altering the esophageal microenvironment and gut microbiome, thereby inducing
inflammation and stem cell expansion, independent of obesity.
