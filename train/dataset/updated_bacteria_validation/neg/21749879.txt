CXCR1 and CXCR2 are receptors for angiogenic ELR+CXC chemokines and are
differentially expressed on endothelial cells; however, their functional
significance in angiogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we determined the
functional significance of these receptors in modulating endothelial cell
phenotype by knocking-down the expression of CXCR1 and/or CXCR2 in human
microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) using short-hairpin RNA (shRNA). Cell
proliferation, migration, invasion and capillary-like structure (CLS) formation
were analyzed. Our data demonstrate that knock-down of CXCR1 and/or CXCR2
expression inhibited endothelial cell proliferation, survival, migration,
invasion and CLS formation. Additionally, we examined the mechanism of
CXCL8-dependent CXCR1 and/or CXCR2 mediated phenotypic changes by evaluating ERK 
phosphorylation and cytoskeletal rearrangement and observed inhibition of ERK
phosphorylation and cytoskeletal rearrangement in HMEC-1-shCXCR1, HMEC-1-shCXCR2 
and HMEC-1-shCXCR1/2 cells. Together, these data demonstrate that CXCR1 and CXCR2
expression plays a critical role in regulating multiple biological activities in 
human microvascular endothelial cells.
