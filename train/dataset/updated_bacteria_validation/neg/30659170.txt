Blocking CXCLs-CXCR2 axis in tumor-stromal interactions contributes to survival
in a mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma through reduced cell
invasion/migration and a shift of immune-inflammatory microenvironment.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by dense stromal
reaction (desmoplasia). We have previously reported that mice with conditional
KrasG12D mutation and knockout of TGF-Î² receptor type II (Tgfbr2), PKF mice,
develop PDAC with desmoplasia modulated by CXC chemokines that are produced by
PDAC cells through tumor-stromal interaction. In this study, we further
discovered that PDAC and cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) accelerated each
other's invasion and migration through the CXC chemokines-receptor (CXCLs-CXCR2) 
axis. Heterozygous knockout of Cxcr2 in PKF mice (PKF2h mice) prolonged survival 
and inhibited both tumor angiogenesis and PDAC microinvasion. Infiltration of
neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and arginase-1+ M2-like
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) significantly decreased in the tumors of
PKF2h mice, whereas inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)+ M1-like TAMs and
apoptotic tumor cells markedly increased, which indicated that blockade of the
CXCLs-CXCR2 axis resulted in a shift of immune-inflammatory microenvironment.
These results suggest that blocking of the CXCLs-CXCR2 axis in tumor-stromal
interactions could be a therapeutic approach against PDAC progression.
