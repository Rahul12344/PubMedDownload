We report a patient relapsing 9 months after CD19-targeted CAR T cell (CTL019)
infusion with CD19- leukemia that aberrantly expressed the anti-CD19 CAR. The CAR
gene was unintentionally introduced into a single leukemic B cell during T cell
manufacturing, and its product bound in cis to the CD19 epitope on the surface of
leukemic cells, masking it from recognition by and conferring resistance to
CTL019.
