A study of the effect of a complex probiotic preparation with bacteria of the
genus Bacillus and a microdose of larvae of the fly Hermetia illucens on the
physiological. parameters of fish has been carried out. It was established that
introduction of the complex into artificial feeds for tilapia and Russian
sturgeon juveniles during their incubation in recirculating aquaculture systems
improves the digestion efficiency and increases the rate of fish growth and body 
mass accumulation. In tilapia, a decrease in the cholesterol level was revealed, 
while in sturgeon, an increase in the hemoglobin content was found. It was noted 
that a probiotic with biologically active agents H. illucens had a stimulating
effect on the development of sexual gonads in female sturgeon fry, promoted an
increase in the ovary mass, and provided for the development of eggs without
morphological disturbances.
