INTRODUCTION: Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common bacterial
infection in patients with cirrhosis and ascites requiring prompt recognition and
treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, and
characteristics of SBP among in-patients with cirrhosis and ascites seen at our
facility.
METHODS: Thirty one patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites who were admitted
into the Medical ward of the Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital (EKSUTH),
Ado-Ekiti, Nigeria from August 2009 to July 2010 were retrospectively studied.
All the patients had abdominal paracentesis done within 48 hours of admission
under aseptic condition and the data obtained were analyzed.
RESULTS: The mean age of the studied population was 62Â±9 years (age range 43-78
years). Of the 21 that developed SPB, culture positive SBP was present in 66.7%
(14/21) while CNNA was found in 33.3% (7/21). The prevalence of MNB was 26%
(8/31) in this study. Of those with SBP, 93% had monomicrobial infection with
aerobic Gram negative bacilli being responsible in 66.7% of the cases with E.
coli (70%) being the predominant organism followed by Klebsiella species. Gram
positive organisms accounted for 33.3% with Streptococcal species (60%) being the
predominant organism followed by Staphylococcus aureus (40%). Patients with SBP
had significantly lower platelet count when compared with those without SBP, p < 
0.05. Also, international normalization ratio (INR) was significantly higher in
those patients with SBP compared with those without SBP, p < 0.05. The poor
prognostic indicators found in this study were; low ascitic protein, hepatic
encephalopathy, coagulopathy, renal dysfunction (creatinine >2 mg/dl) and
leukocytosis (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: It is therefore imperative to do diagnostic abdominal paracentesis
for cell count and culture in any patient with onset of ascites or cirrhotic
patients with ascites and suggestive symptoms compatible or suggestive of SBP.
