A strain of food-poisoning bacterium has been isolated by Jin Jiexiang (1963) in 
China from the fermented cornflour that has gone bad. These pathogenic
microorganism has been identified and named Pseudomonas by Zhao Naixin in 1988,
which is the same species as P. cocovenenans. The characteristics of them were
conformed to these of the species P. cepacia of section 2 of the genus
Pseudomonas. In view of the fact that the fine structures of the above mentioned 
three strains of Pseudomonas have not been described yet, we decided to observe
them with electron microscope. Results indicate there are many things in common
among the three strains, such as: appearing short rods, 0.6-0.8 microns in
diameter by 1.5-2.0 microns in length, one polar multiflagella; non-pili,
non-capsules, non-endospores; containing intranuclear inclusions (electron-dense 
bodies or concentric laminae bodies), accumulating intracytoplasmic PHB granules;
forming filaments, minicells and bizarrecells; producing extracellular
cellulose-like materials by the three strains have not been reported previously.
