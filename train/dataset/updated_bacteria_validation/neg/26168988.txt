INTRODUCTION: The European Cubicin(®) Outcomes Registry and Experience
(EU-CORE(SM)) was a retrospective, non-interventional, multicenter study which
evaluated the safety and effectiveness of daptomycin therapy in patients with
Gram-positive infections including infective endocarditis (IE).
METHODS: Data from the EU-CORE registry were collected for patients with IE who
had received at least one dose of daptomycin between January 2006 and April 2012,
across 18 countries in Europe (12), Latin America (5) and Asia (1). Clinical
outcomes were assessed as success (cured or improved), failure or non-evaluable. 
Adverse events (AEs) were recorded during treatment and for up to 30 days
post-treatment; follow-up data were collected for 2 years.
RESULTS: Of 6075 patients included in the EU-CORE registry, 610 were diagnosed
with IE as primary infection; 149 (24.4%) right-sided IE (RIE), 414 (67.9%)
left-sided IE (LIE), and 47 (7.7%) with both right- and left-sided IE (BRLIE).
Overall clinical success was achieved in 80.0% of patients (RIE 88.6%, LIE 76.6% 
and BRLIE 82.9%). Success rates for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) infections were 90.9%, 71.7% and 66.6% in patients with RIE, LIE and
BRLIE, respectively. The overall sustained clinical success rate in patients
followed for up to 2 years was 86.7% (RIE 93.5%, LIE 88.3% and BRLIE 77.8%). AEs 
deemed possibly related to daptomycin in the investigator's opinion were reported
in 2 (1.3%) RIE, 18 (4.3%) LIE and 1 (2.1%) BRLIE patients. There were 11 (1.8%) 
patients (2 with RIE, 8 with LIE and 1 with BRLIE) with AEs of creatine
phosphokinase elevation reported as possibly related to daptomycin.
CONCLUSION: Data from this real-world clinical setting showed that daptomycin was
well tolerated and effective for the treatment of LIE and BRLIE in addition to
RIE caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA. Two-year follow-up data
showed that a high proportion of patients had a sustained response.
