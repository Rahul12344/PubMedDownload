Cigarette smoke has a broad impact on the mucosal environment with the ability to
alter host defense mechanisms. Within the context of a bacterial infection, this 
altered host response is often accompanied by exacerbated cellular inflammation, 
characterized by increased neutrophilia. The current study investigated the
mechanisms of neutrophil recruitment in a murine model of cigarette smoke
exposure and, subsequently, a model of both cigarette smoke exposure and
bacterial infection. We investigated the role of IL-1 signaling in neutrophil
recruitment and found that cigarette smoke-induced neutrophilia was dependent on 
IL-1α produced by alveolar macrophages. In addition to being the crucial source
of IL-1α, alveolar macrophages isolated from smoke-exposed mice were primed for
excessive IL-1α production in response to bacterial ligands. To test the
relevance of exaggerated IL-1α production in neutrophil recruitment, a model of
cigarette smoke exposure and nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae infection was
developed. Mice exposed to cigarette smoke elaborated an exacerbated
CXCR2-dependent neutrophilia in response to nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae.
Exacerbated neutrophilia was dependent on IL-1α priming of the pulmonary
environment by cigarette smoke as exaggerated neutrophilia was dependent on IL-1 
signaling. These data characterize a novel mechanism of cigarette smoke priming
the lung mucosa toward greater IL-1-driven neutrophilic responses to bacteria,
with a central role for the alveolar macrophage in this process.
