HLA-DM is required for efficient peptide exchange on class II MHC molecules, but 
its mechanism of action is controversial. We trapped an intermediate state of
class II MHC HLA-DR1 by substitution of αF54, resulting in a protein with
increased HLA-DM binding affinity, weakened MHC-peptide hydrogen bonding as
measured by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and increased
susceptibility to DM-mediated peptide exchange. Structural analysis revealed a
set of concerted conformational alterations at the N-terminal end of the
peptide-binding site. These results suggest that interaction with HLA-DM is
driven by a conformational change of the MHC II protein in the region of the
α-subunit 3(10) helix and adjacent extended strand region, and provide a model
for the mechanism of DM-mediated peptide exchange.
