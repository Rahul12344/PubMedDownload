Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) in RA patients is associated with NSAID use. This
study aimed to validate the predictive value of presumed risk factors for
NSAID-associated PUD in a prospective gastroscopic study in RA patients.
Eighty-one NSAID using RA patients were prospectively divided into four presumed 
risk groups according to Helicobacter pylori status and history of PUD. As
additional risk factors the following were analysed: upper gastrointestinal GI
complaints; disability; daily dose of NSAID and antral gastritis. The presence of
PUD in the four risk groups did not differ. Additionally it was found that a
history of PUD was predictive for current PUD [odds ratio (OR) 3.9; 95% CI
1.1-14]. H. pylori status was not predictive. Transformation from one ulcer type 
to another was rare. NSAID dose was not a risk factor, while disability was of
borderline importance (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1-4.8). Current upper GI complaints were
bad predictors. PUD only occurred with a concomitant antral gastritis. A history 
of PUD, disability and antral gastritis were the most important predictors for
current PUD. When an ulcer relapsed it was of the same ulcer type as had been
present earlier. This may have practical implications for prophylaxis enabling
stratification by previous ulcer type.
