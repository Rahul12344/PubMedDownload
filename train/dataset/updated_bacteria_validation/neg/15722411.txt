A form of alpha-galactosylceramide, KRN7000, activates CD1d-restricted
Valpha14-invariant (Valpha14i) natural killer (NK) T cells and initiates multiple
downstream immune reactions. We report that substituting the C26:0 N-acyl chain
of KRN7000 with shorter, unsaturated fatty acids modifies the outcome of
Valpha14i NKT cell activation. One analogue containing a diunsaturated C20 fatty 
acid (C20:2) potently induced a T helper type 2-biased cytokine response, with
diminished IFN-gamma production and reduced Valpha14i NKT cell expansion. C20:2
also exhibited less stringent requirements for loading onto CD1d than KRN7000,
suggesting a mechanism for the immunomodulatory properties of this lipid. The
differential cellular response elicited by this class of Valpha14i NKT cell
agonists may prove to be useful in immunotherapeutic applications.
