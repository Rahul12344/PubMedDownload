Although the nature of the antigens and the immune responses they elicit to
achieve immunity to furunculosis are still not well defined, the currently
available vaccines comprising A. salmonicida bacterins emulsified in oil
adjuvants and delivered by intraperitoneal injection provide remarkably high
levels of long-lasting protection. Despite some concern over side-effects, these 
vaccines have been adopted by most Atlantic salmon farmers over the last four
years, transforming a situation where furunculosis outbreaks were becoming
catastrophic to one where losses from the disease are negligible. Present
evidence indicates that antibody responses to the polysaccharide capsule and iron
regulated outer membrane proteins are associated with protection. Furthermore,
cell-mediated immune responses involving antigen-induced release of cytokines
from lymphocytes and the resultant activation of macrophages with the ability to 
kill the pathogen are also considered important protective mechanisms. Vaccines
comprising whole A. salmonicida cultures grown under iron-restricted conditions
and delivered by injection in an oil adjuvant are expected to induce prolonged
stimulation of all the above responses. While these vaccines are suitable and
effective for administration to salmon smolts there is still a need for mass
vaccination by immersion or oral routes for salmonid fry. Effective means of
achieving this are still required.
