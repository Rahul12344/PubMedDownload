Intraperitoneal infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from BCG vaccine to male 
BALB/c mice provoked the formation of multinuclear macrophages in the peritoneal 
transudate. In 2 and 3 months after infection, their number increased
respectively by 34.4 and 66.7% in comparison with intact mice. At all
postinfection terms, far greater amounts of caspase 3, p53, Bad, and TNFα were
expressed by multinuclear macrophages than by the mononuclear ones. At these
terms, the content of Bcl-2-expressing macrophages with different numbers of
nuclei was pronouncedly high; of them, the number of multinuclear macrophages was
maximum. In 3 months after infection, the number of macrophages expressing Bcl-2 
significantly decreased irrespective of the number of their nuclei. At this term,
the number of macrophages expressing caspase 3, and TNFα also decreased. In
parallel, the number of macrophages expressing p53 and Bad somewhat increased.
These data attest to potentiality ("readiness") of macrophages infected with
Mycobacterium tuberculosis to apoptotic self-elimination.
