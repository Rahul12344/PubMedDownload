OBJECTIVE: We investigated the necessity of using sterile water in humidifiers
for avoiding respiratory tract infections during nasal continuous positive airway
pressure (nCPAP) therapy.
METHODS: Water in a convection-type humidifier (Sirius; Heinen and Löwenstein
GmbH; Bad Ems, Germany) was labeled with (99m)Tc-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic 
acid. Low-flow (2 L/min, 4 L/min, or 6 L/min) and high-flow (31 to 46 L/min)
rates were applied, rates typical for nCPAP. Heat and moisture exchange filters
were placed behind the start of the tube to measure any radioactive aerosol.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that no radioactive aerosols were produced, either with 
low or high flows.
CONCLUSIONS: The convection-type humidifier produces water vapor but does not
aerosolize the water. We conclude that bacteria, other microorganisms, or even
solutes that may be contained in the water cannot be transported into the air and
thus will not be deposited in the lung. In order to avoid respiratory tract
infections, sterile water is not required, at least in this particular
humidifier. We suggest that nonsterile tap water is probably a safe alternative.
