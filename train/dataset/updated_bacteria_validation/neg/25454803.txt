INTRODUCTION: C1q deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that is strongly
associated with development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Several
mutations in the coding regions of the C1q genes have been described that result 
in stop-codons or other genetic abnormalities ultimately leading to C1q
deficiency. Here we report on a Dutch boy suffering from recurrent infections
with a complete C1q deficiency, without any SLE symptoms.
METHODS: The presence of C1q in serum was assessed using ELISA and hemolytic
assay. By western blot we examined the different C1q chains in cell lysates. We
identified the mutation using deep-sequencing. By qPCR we studied the mRNA
expression of C1qA, C1qB and C1qC in the PBMCs of the patient.
RESULTS: Deep-sequencing revealed a homozygous mutation in the non-coding region 
of C1qB in the patient, whereas both parents were heterozygous. The mutation is
located two nucleotides before the splice site of the second exon. In-silico
analyses predict a complete abrogation of this natural splice site. Analyses of
in vitro cultured cells from the patient revealed a lack of production of C1q and
intracellular absence of C1qB in the presence of C1qA and C1qC peptides.
Quantitative PCR analysis revealed total absence of C1qB mRNA, a reduced level of
C1qA mRNA and normal levels of C1qC mRNA.
CONCLUSION: In this study we report a new mutation in the non-coding region of
C1qB that is associated with C1q deficiency.
