New tools have revealed that migrations of Phytophthora infestans have been a
dominant feature of the population biology of this pathogen for the past 50
years, and maybe for the past 170 years. We now have accurate information on the 
composition of many P. infestans populations. However, migration followed by
selection can lead and has led to dramatically rapid changes in populations over 
large regions. Except for the highlands of central Mexico, many populations of P.
infestans have probably been in flux over the past several decades. There is some
evidence that this pathogen has different characteristics in the field than it
does in the lab, and early field phenotypic analyses of hypotheses concerning
fitness and pathogenicity would be beneficial. The newly available capacity to
acquire and process vast amounts of weather and weather forecast data in
combination with advancements in molecular diagnostics enables much greater
precision in late blight management to produce recommendations that are site,
host, and pathogen specific.
