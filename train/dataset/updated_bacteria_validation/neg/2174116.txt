Retinoic acid together with dibutyryl cyclic AMP stimulated transcription of the 
platelet-derived growth factor alpha-receptor gene in embryonal carcinoma cells
(line F9). Processed mRNA transcripts appeared within 4 h after exposure to these
agents, and functional alpha:alpha homodimers appeared within 24 h.
