This study describes the cooperative effect of the two biocatalysts Acetobacter
aceti and Gluconobacter roseus for biodegradation as well as current generation. 
The electro activity of the biofilms of these two microorganisms was investigated
by the bioelectrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol and glucose using cyclic
voltammetry. Two chamber microbial fuel cells (MFCs) were constructed using
single culture of A. aceti (A-MFC), and G. roseus (G-MFC) and also using mixed
culture (AG-MFC). Each MFC was fed with four different substrates viz., glucose, 
ethanol, acetate and bad wine. AG-MFC produced higher power density with glucose 
(1.05 W/m(3)), ethanol (1.97 W/m(3)), acetate (1.39 W/m(3)) and bad wine (3.82
W/m(3)). COD removal (94%) was maximum for acetate fed MFCs. Higher coulombic
efficiency was obtained with bad wine (45%) as the fuel. This work provides the
scope of using these biofuel cells in wineries for performing the dual duty of
bad wine degradation along with current generation.
