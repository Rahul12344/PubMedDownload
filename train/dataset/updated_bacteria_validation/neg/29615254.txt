The most common livestock-associated lineage of methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in Western Europe is currently clonal complex (CC)
398. CC398-MRSA spread extensively across livestock populations in several
Western European countries, and livestock-derived CC398-MRSA strains can also be 
detected in humans. Based on their SCCmec elements, different CC398 strains can
be distinguished. SCCmec elements of 100 veterinary and human CC398-MRSA isolates
from Germany and Austria were examined using DNA microarray-based assays. In
addition, 589 published SCC and/or genome sequences of CC398-MRSA (including
both, fully finished and partially assembled sequences) were analysed by mapping 
them to the probe sequences of the microarrays. Several isolates and sequences
showed an insertion of a large fragment of CC9 genomic DNA into the CC398
chromosome. Fifteen subtypes of SCCmec elements were detected among the 100 CC398
isolates and 41 subtypes could be discerned among the published CC398 sequences. 
Eleven of these were also experimentally detected within our strain collection,
while four subtypes identified in the isolates where not found among the
sequences. A high prevalence of heavy metal resistance genes, especially of czrC,
was observed among CC398-MRSA. A possible co-selection of resistances to
antibiotics and zinc/copper supplements in animal feed as well as a spill-over of
SCCmec elements that have evolved in CC398-MRSA to other, possibly more virulent 
and/or medically relevant S. aureus lineages might pose public health problems in
future.
