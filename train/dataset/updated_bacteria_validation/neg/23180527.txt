We report the case of 42-year-old male, who developed infective endocarditis on
bicuspid aortic valve due to infection of the central line with Staphylococcus
aureus MSSA. The patient was hospitalised several times in district hospitals
because of worsening of heart failure. He had a few transthoracic (TTE) and one
transesophageal (TEE) echocardiography which did not reveal early stages of
perivalvular abscess and was disqualified from surgical procedures due to bad
left ventricular systolic function. The second TEE done a month after the first
one showed an abscess with perforation to the right ventricle. The patient died
disqualified again from surgical procedure due to multiorgan failure.
