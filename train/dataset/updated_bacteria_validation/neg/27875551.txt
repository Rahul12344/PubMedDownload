Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase or GAPDH is an evolutionarily conserved 
glycolytic enzyme. It catalyzes the two step oxidative phosphorylation of
D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate into 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate using inorganic
phosphate and NAD+ as cofactor. GAPDH of Group B Streptococcus is a major
virulence factor and a potential vaccine candidate. Moreover, since GAPDH
activity is essential for bacterial growth it may serve as a possible drug
target. Crystal structures of Group B Streptococcus GAPDH in the apo-form, two
different binary complexes and the ternary complex are described here. The two
binary complexes contained NAD+ bound to 2 (mixed-holo) or 4 (holo) subunits of
the tetrameric protein. The structure of the mixed-holo complex reveals the
effects of NAD+ binding on the conformation of the protein. In the ternary
complex, the phosphate group of the substrate was bound to the new Pi site in all
four subunits. Comparison with the structure of human GAPDH showed several
differences near the adenosyl binding pocket in Group B Streptococcus GAPDH. The 
structures also reveal at least three surface-exposed areas that differ in amino 
acid sequence compared to the corresponding areas of human GAPDH.
