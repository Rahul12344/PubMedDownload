BACKGROUND & AIMS: Celiac disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the small 
intestine mucosa due to permanent intolerance to dietary gluten. The aim was to
elucidate the role of small intestinal epithelial cells in the immunopathology of
celiac disease in particular the influence of celiac disease-associated bacteria.
METHODS: Duodenal biopsies were collected from children with active celiac
disease, treated celiac disease, and clinical controls. Intestinal epithelial
cells were purified and analyzed for gene expression changes at the mRNA and
protein levels. Two in vitro models for human intestinal epithelium, small
intestinal enteroids and polarized tight monolayers, were utilized to assess how 
interferon-γ, interleukin-17A, celiac disease-associated bacteria and gluten
influence intestinal epithelial cells.
RESULTS: More than 25 defense-related genes, including IRF1, SPINK4, ITLN1, OAS2,
CIITA, HLA-DMB, HLA-DOB, PSMB9, TAP1, BTN3A1, and CX3CL1, were significantly
upregulated in intestinal epithelial cells at active celiac disease. Of these
genes, 70% were upregulated by interferon-γ via the IRF1 pathway. Most
interestingly, IRF1 was also upregulated by celiac disease-associated bacteria.
The NLRP6/8 inflammasome yielding CASP1 and biologically active interleukin-18,
which induces interferon-γ in intraepithelial lymphocytes, was expressed in
intestinal epithelial cells.
CONCLUSION: A key factor in the epithelial reaction in celiac disease appears to 
be over-expression of IRF1 that could be inherent and/or due to presence of
undesirable microbes that act directly on IRF1. Dual activation of IRF1 and
IRF1-regulated genes, both directly and via the interleukin-18 dependent
inflammasome would drastically enhance the inflammatory response and lead to the 
pathological situation seen in active celiac disease.
