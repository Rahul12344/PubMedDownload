A novel, strictly aerobic, Gram-negative, yellow-orange-pigmented, motile,
catalase-positive, oxidase-negative bacterium, RW262(T), was isolated from water 
of the River Taff, Cardiff, UK, during January 2000. Phylogenetic analysis of the
16S rRNA gene indicated that strain RW262(T) was a member of the family
Cryomorphaceae within the phylum 'Bacteroidetes'. The DNA G+C content of strain
RW262(T) was 37.2 mol%. The predominant fatty acid was the branched-chain
saturated fatty acid i15:0 (44.2%). On the basis of polyphasic analysis of
phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, genotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, it is
proposed that this freshwater bacterium represents a novel genus and species
within the family Cryomorphaceae, Fluviicola taffensis gen. nov., sp. nov. The
type strain is RW262(T) (=NCIMB 13979(T)=DSM 16823(T)).
