Amyloid is traditionally viewed as a consequence of protein misfolding and
aggregation and is most notorious for its association with debilitating and
chronic human diseases. However, a growing list of examples of "functional
amyloid" challenges this bad reputation and indicates that many organisms can
employ the biophysical properties of amyloid for their benefit. Because of
developments in the structural studies of amyloid, a clearer picture is emerging 
about what defines amyloid structure and the properties that unite functional and
pathological amyloids. Here, we review various amyloids and place them within the
framework of the latest structural models.
