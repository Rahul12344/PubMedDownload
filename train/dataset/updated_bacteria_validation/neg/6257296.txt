On the fidelity of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis directed by
chromatin-associated deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase beta.

Fry M, Shearman CW, Martin GM, Loeb LA.

Accuracy of poly[d(A-T)] synthesis catalyzed by chromatin-bound deoxyribonucleic 
acid (DNA) polymerase beta was measured with several types. A new procedure was
developed for the isolation of copied poly[d(A-T)] from chromatin DNA. This
method involved in vitro copying of poly[d(A-T)] by native chromatin and
subsequent selective fragmentation of chromatin by restriction nucleases,
proteinase K, and heat denaturation. The fragmented natural DNA is then separated
from the high molecular weight poly[d(A-T)] by gel filtration. The efficacy of
DNA removal by this procedure was validated by cesium chloride gradient and
nearest-neighbor analysis of the product of the reaction and by measurement of
the fidelity of poly[d(A-T)] synthesis by Escherichia coli DNA Pol I contaminated
with increasing amounts of DNA. Also, DNA polymerases dissociated from chromatin 
retain the same accuracy as that of native chromatin. Synthesis of poly[d(A-T)]
by chromatin is catalyzed mainly by DNA polymerase-beta. By use of the described 
technique, we find that the fidelity of this reaction is exceptionally low;
approximately one dGTP was incorporated for every thousand complementary
nucleotides polymerized.
