One of the largest and longest Salmonella outbreaks in Germany within the last 10
years occurred in central Germany in 2013. To identify vehicles of infection, we 
analysed surveillance data, conducted a case-control study and food traceback. We
identified 267 cases infected with Salmonella Infantis with symptom onset between
16 April and 26 October 2013 in four neighbouring federal states. Results of our 
study indicated that cases were more likely to have eaten raw minced pork from
local butcher's shops [odds ratio (OR) 2·5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1·1-5·8]
and have taken gastric acid-reducing or -neutralizing medication (OR 3·8, 95% CI 
1·3-13) than controls. The outbreak was traced back to contaminated raw pork
products found in different butcher's shops supplied by one slaughterhouse, to
pigs at one farm and to an animal feed producer. Characterization of isolates of 
human, food, animal, feed, and environmental origin by phage-typing and
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis confirmed the chain of infection. Insufficient
hygiene standards in the slaughterhouse were the most probable cause of the
ongoing transmission. We recommend that persons taking gastric acid suppressants 
should refrain from consuming raw pork products. Improving and maintaining
adequate hygiene standards and process controls during slaughter is important to 
prevent future outbreaks.
