CD1d is a key antigen-presenting molecule involved in the selection and
activation of a highly conserved T cell subset known as NK T cells. In this
study, we analyzed the expression, regulation and function of human CD1d by
various antigen-presenting cells (APC) of myeloid origin, including circulating
monocytes, monocyte-derived dendritic cells and macrophages. CD1d was expressed
as a mature glycoprotein by these cells, and unlike the other members of the
human CD1 family its expression was constitutive and was not strongly
up-regulated by GM-CSF and IL-4 or a range of other cytokines. Despite their
remarkably low surface expression of CD1d, all myeloid lineage cells tested were 
extremely potent APC for responses of NK T cell clones to the synthetic
glycolipid antigen, alpha-galactosyl ceramide. Prominent localization of CD1d to 
the endocytic system of monocyte lineage cells was observed, and functional
studies suggested that this was important for achieving efficient antigen loading
onto CD1d. Overall, these results support the view that monocyte lineage cells
are important stimulators of CD1d-restricted immune responses, while also
underscoring the unique regulation of CD1d expression by these cells.
