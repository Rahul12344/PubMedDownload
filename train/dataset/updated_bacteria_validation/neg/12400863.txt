Larval mortality in Indian major carps is one of the major problems encountered
in the pond culture system. The present investigation was carried out to
investigate the proper age, duration of exposure, and optimum bacterin
concentration for vaccinating rohu (Labeo rohita) and catla (Catla catla) at
their early stages with a formalin killed Edwardsiella tarda bacterin suspension.
The development of immunological competence was recorded with spawn of rohu and
catla of 3 weeks of age exposed to a bacterin at a concentration 10(9) cfu ml(-1)
for 15 min, where it persisted up to 4 weeks post vaccination. They showed
significant resistance against challenge with virulent E. tarda bacteria.
Significant antibody titre could be recorded in advanced fries and fingerlings
exposed to 10(9) cfu/ml(-1) bacterin concentration for 45 and 60 min,
respectively.
