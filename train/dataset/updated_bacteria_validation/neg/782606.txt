[Localization in cells of Neisseria perflava and Klebsiella pneumoniae of
antigens in common (cross-reacting) with tissues of the human bronchopulmonary
apparatus].

[Article in Russian]

Ado AD, Fedoseeva VN.

A study was made of localization in the cells of Neisseria perflava and
Klebsiella pneumoniae of antigens common with the tissues of the human
broncho-pulmonary apparatus. A study was made of cross reactions of some
structures of Neisseria perflava and Klebsiella pneumoniae cells (capsule, walls,
cytoplasmic structure fraction, hyaloplasm) in the complement fixation test with 
antilung sera. Antigens cross reacting with the antilung sera were localized not 
only in the surface structures (walls) of bacterial cells, but also in the "deep"
components (cytoplasm fraction rich in ribonucleoproteids) of the microbe.
