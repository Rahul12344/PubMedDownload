[A CASE OF MILIARY TUBERCULOSIS ASSOCIATED WITH HEPATOSPLENIC ABSCESSES APPEARING
DURING ANTI-TUBERCULOUS TREATMENT].

A 27-year-old man with a 4-month history of treatment for miliary tuberculosis at
another hospital was admitted to our hospital for continued treatment. Computed
tomography showed new lesions in the S8 area of the liver and spleen, despite
resolution of chest radiographic findings. Because these new lesions were still
present after 8 months of treatment, we performed laparoscopic drainage of the
liver abscess. Purulent material drained from the lesion revealed positive
polymerase chain reaction results for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and
identification of granuloma with infiltrating lymphocytes and plasma cells
confirmed the diagnosis of tubercular liver abscess. Pathological changes in the 
spleen over the clinical course were also regarded as representing tubercular
abscess. Postoperative course was good, and tuberculosis treatment ended after 12
months. Tubercular liver abscess subsequently showed prominent reduction, and the
tubercular splenic abscess disappeared on abdominal ultrasonography. Tubercular
hepatosplenic abscesses appearing during tubercular treatment are rare. We report
this valuable case in which laparoscopic drainage of a liver abscess proved
useful for diagnosis and treatment.
