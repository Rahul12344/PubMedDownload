Edwardsiella tarda, which is known to be the causative agent of edwardsiellosis
in freshwater and marine fish, has two motility phenotypes. Typical strains
exhibiting motility are isolated mainly from freshwater fish and Japanese
flounder. Atypical strains exhibiting non-motility are isolated mainly from
marine fish, with the exception of Japanese flounder. Subtractive hybridization
was performed to identify genomic differences between these two phenotypes. Two
fragments which showed homology to potential virulence factors were isolated from
atypical strains: the autotransporter adhesin AIDA and a component of T6SS. We
analysed DNA sequences of about 5 kbp containing these fragments and identified
two partial ORF, and ORF encoding for other components of T6SS. The predicted
amino acid sequences showed remarkably low homology to components of T6SS
reported in the typical E. tarda strain PPD130/91. Furthermore, the organization 
of these ORF was different from the gene cluster of the typical E. tarda strain. 
AIDA and T6SS may therefore be associated with different pathogenicity in typical
and atypical E. tarda hosts.
