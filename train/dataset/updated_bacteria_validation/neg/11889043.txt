Transcription of the major histocompatibility complex class II family of genes is
regulated by conserved promoter elements and two gene-specific trans-activators, 
RFX and CIITA. RFX binds DNA and nucleates the assembly of an enhanceosome, which
recruits CIITA through protein--protein interactions. Transcriptional activation 
is a complex, multi-step process involving chromatin modification and recruitment
of the transcription apparatus. To examine the roles of the enhanceosome and
CIITA in these processes, we analysed the level of promoter-associated
hyperacetylated histones H3 and H4, TBP, TFIIB and RNA poly merase II in cells
lacking RFX or CIITA. We compared four genes co-regulated by RFX and CIITA
(HLA-DRA, HLA-DPB, HLA-DMB and Ii) and found that the enhanceosome and CIITA make
variable, promoter-dependent contributions to histone acetylation and
transcription apparatus recruitment. CIITA is generally implicated at multiple
levels of the activation process, while the enhanceosome contributes in a
CIITA-independent manner only at certain promoters. Our results support the
general notion that the impact of a particular activator on transcription in vivo
may vary depending on the promoter and the chromatin context.
