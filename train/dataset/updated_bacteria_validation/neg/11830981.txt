About 15% of the Dutch population has, in a more or lesser degree, complaints
about bad breath. This is caused particularly by the anaerobic metabolism of a
number of oral microorganisms, in which putrefaction occurs and volatile sulfur
compounds will be formed. Some of these compounds are also possibly involved in
the pathogenesis of periodontitis. A good oral hygiene is of primary importance
to prevent halitosis and to reduce bad breath. Antiseptic mouth-waters can be
helpful in the reduction of the bacterial metabolism. In addition, stimulation of
the salivary secretion has a dual favourable effect, firstly because of its
antimicrobial salivary proteins, and secondly by reduction of the retention of
nutrients in the oral cavity.
