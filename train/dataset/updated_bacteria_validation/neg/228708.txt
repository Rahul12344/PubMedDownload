EPR spectra of photosystem I and other iron protein components in intact cells of
cyanobacteria.

Cammack R, Luijk LJ, Maguire JJ, Fry IV, Packer L.

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were recorded of whole filaments of
the cyanobacteria Nostoc muscorum and Anabaena cylindrica. Signals due to
manganese were removed by freezing and thawing the cells in EDTA. EPR spectra
were assigned on the basis of their g values, linewidths, temperature dependence 
and response to dithionite and light treatments. The principal components
identified were: (i) rhombic Fe3+ (signal at g = 4.3), probably a soluble storage
form of iron; (ii) iron-sulfur centers A and B of Photosystem I; (iii) the
photochemical electron acceptor 'X' of Photosystem I; this component was also
observed for the first time in isolated heterocysts; (iv) soluble ferredoxin
which was present at a concentration of 1 molecule per 140 +/- 20 chlorophyll
molecules; (v) a membrane-bound iron-sulfur protein (g = 1.92). A signal g = 6 in
the oxidized state was probably due to an unidentified heme compound. During
deprivation of iron the rhombic Fe3+, centers A, B and X of Photosystem I, and
soluble ferredoxin were all observed to decrease.
