Bioaugmentation with anaerobic ruminal fungi and a pool of hydrogen-producing
fermenting bacteria was tested on wheat straw (WS) and mushroom spent straw (MSS)
with the aim of improving anaerobic digestion performance. Batch tests were set
up to simulate a Bioaugmentation Anaerobic Digestion (BAD) treatment comparing
single- (I-BAD) and two-stage (II-BAD) process configurations, at two reactor
scales, 120 and 1200 ml (×10). In both cases, higher CH4 cumulative production
was obtained in the II-BAD configuration on WS (65.1 ± 8.9 Nml and 922 ± 73.8 Nml
respectively). The II-BADx10 tests allowed increasing CH4 production (≃290% and
≃330% on WS and MSS, respectively) when compared to the unaugmented condition.
Final results highlighted the achievable advantages of the two stage
configuration in terms of CH4 production enhancement. Microbial community
investigations confirmed the efficiency of the bioaugmentation treatment and
revealed that such a result was mainly related to the Methanosarcinales increase,
mostly composed by Methanosaeta.
