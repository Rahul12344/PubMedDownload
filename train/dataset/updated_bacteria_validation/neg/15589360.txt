The mortality of overwhelming postsplenectomy infections (OPSI) is significant
(50 to 80 percent). Capnocytophaga canimorsus belongs to the normal oral flora of
dogs and cats. It is seldom responsible for human infections, but its prognosis
is bad (about 30 percent of overall mortality), especially in asplenic patients. 
We report a case of a splenectomized patient who suffered from communal septic
shock due to C. canimorsus septicaemia. The course of events was rapidly fatal.
Diagnosis and mode of contamination were determined only a few weeks after the
patient's death. This late microbiological diagnosis is due to a slow growth of
C. canimorsus in vitro.
