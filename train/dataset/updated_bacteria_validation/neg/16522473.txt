BACKGROUND: Commensal gut bacteria are essential for the development and
maintenance of the gut's immune system. Some bacteria strains, such as
Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, have been reported to provide
protection from allergic and inflammatory bowel diseases. However, the
interactions between these commensal bacteria and the immune system are largely
unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We studied the effects of a supernatant from the culture of B breve
C50 (BbC50) on the maturation, activation, and survival of human dendritic cells 
(DCs).
METHODS: DCs were differentiated from human monocytes with IL-4 and GM-CSF for 5 
days and cultured with BbC50 supernatant (BbC50SN) or LPS for 2 days.
RESULTS: BbC50SN induced DC maturation, with increase in CD83, CD86, and HLA-DR
expression. We also showed, for the first time, that BbC50SN prolonged DC
survival, with high IL-10 and low IL-12 production compared with that seen in
LPS-DCs. Moreover, BbC50SN inhibited the effects of LPS on DCs, both in terms of 
IL-12 production and in terms of survival. The prolonged DC survival was
independent of IL-10 production and nuclear factor kappaB pathway but was
associated with an upregulation of Bcl-xL and Phospho-Bad. Finally, BbC50SN
induced activation of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-transfected cells in contrast
to TLR4-, TLR7-, and TLR9-transfected cells.
CONCLUSION: The supernatant of B breve C50 can induce DC maturation and prolonged
DC survival through TLR2, with high IL-10 production. These properties might
correspond to a regulatory DC profile, which could limit the excessive TH1
response and control the excessive TH2 polarization observed in atopic newborns.
