A total of 143 patients with 159 episodes of intravascular device, blood-borne
infection were studied. All infections were confirmed by the same organism being 
recovered from blood culture and by semiquantitative culture of the catheter tip.
Sites of infection included the peripheral venous line (n = 72), central catheter
(n = 49), arterial line (n = 18), subclavian dialysis catheter (n = 12),
Swan-Ganz catheter (n = 4), Broviac catheter (n = 3), and transvenous pacemaker
wires (n = 1). Staphylococcus aureus (n = 78) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (n =
33) predominated as pathogens. Excessive length of catheterization was implicated
as directly responsible for this complication in patients with peripheral
intravenous and arterial lines. Nosocomial staphylococcal bacteremia must be
considered secondary to an indwelling intravascular device until proven
otherwise. Appropriate therapy requires removal of the catheters, excision of the
vein if suppuration or persistent bacteremia is identified, and specific
antibiotic therapy.
