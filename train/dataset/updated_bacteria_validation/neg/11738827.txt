Placing a gene of interest under the control of an inducible promoter greatly
aids the purification, localization and functional analysis of proteins but
usually requires the sub-cloning of the gene of interest into an appropriate
expression vector. Here, we describe an alternative approach employing in vitro
transposition of Tn Omega P(BAD) to place the highly regulable, arabinose
inducible P(BAD) promoter upstream of the gene to be expressed. The method is
rapid, simple and facilitates the optimization of expression by producing
constructs with variable distances between the P(BAD) promoter and the gene. To
illustrate the use of this approach, we describe the construction of a strain of 
Escherichia coli in which growth at low temperatures on solid media is dependent 
on threshold levels of arabinose. Other uses of the transposable promoter are
also discussed.
