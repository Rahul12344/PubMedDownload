Fresh produce is an important part of a healthy diet and is consumed in greater
quantity in the United States than ever before. Consumption of cantaloupe has
recently been associated with several large outbreaks of infections in North
America, highlighting the need for a better understanding of practices and
processes that may contribute to contamination. We reviewed all
cantaloupe-associated outbreaks that were reported to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) and published in the literature. Twenty-three
outbreaks occurred between 1984 and 2002; 1434 people became ill, 42 were
hospitalized, and two died in these outbreaks. Aetiological agents in the
outbreaks included five serotypes of Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter jejuni,
Escherichia coli O157:H7, and norovirus. We reviewed processes contributing to
cantaloupe contamination, conditions affecting survival and growth of bacterial
pathogens on melons, and potential methods for sanitization. For maximum safety, 
industry, federal, and international partners must collaborate to ensure that
appropriate interventions are in place to minimize the risk of contamination and 
prevent the growth of pathogens during cantaloupe production, processing,
storage, and preparation.
