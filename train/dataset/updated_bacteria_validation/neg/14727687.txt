Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection elevates the risk of gastric diseases
including peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. The infection induces inflammatory
cytokines, which could work both for and against lifetime infection in the human 
stomach. Genetic polymorphisms of the cytokines and other related ligands,
receptors, and enzymes may influence persistent HP infection. This paper
summarizes studies done on the associations between anti-HP antibody
seropositivity and polymorphism genotypes. To date, the associations with the
polymorphisms of fucosyl transferase 2 (FUT2 or secretor gene), FUT3 (Lewis
gene), interleukin 1A (IL-1A), IL-1B, IL-1RN, IL-8, IL-10, myeloperoxidase (MPO),
and tumor necrosis factor A (TNF-A) and TNF-B have been reported. Polymorphisms
of other related genes, CD14, CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), IL-1RI, nuclear
factor KB2 (NF-KB2), and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), have the potential to
influence persistent infection. Unpublished results from our datasets are
reported here for all these polymorphisms except TLR4. Gene-environment
interactions between these genotypes and smoking are reviewed. An effect on OR
due to the involvement of unexposed subjects is demonstrated to elucidate a
disadvantage in the studies done in areas where the majority of the population is
not exposed to HP.
