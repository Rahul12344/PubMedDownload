Exocellular mucopolysaccharide closely related to bacterial floc formation.

Tago Y, Aida K.

A bacterium isolated from activated sludge formed a visible floc and also
produced an exoenzyme that could bring about deflocculation. Scanning electron
microscopic examination revealed that the cells were embedded in a film mesh in
the floc, which disappeared after treatment with the deflocculating enzyme.
Polysaccharides isolated from the floc were fractionated into three fractions by 
diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex A-25 column chromatography, whereas those from the
free cells were fractionated into only two fractions. The missing fraction was a 
mucopolysaccharide composed of glucosamine, glucose, mannose, galactose, and
rhamnose and was hydrolyzed to oligosaccharides by the deflocculating enzyme. The
other two fractions were resistant to the enzyme. These results show that the
mesh structure of the floc is dependent on a mucopolysaccharide hydrolyzed by the
deflocculating enzyme.
