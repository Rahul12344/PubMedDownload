Antibiotics have been among the most successful classes of therapeutics and have 
enabled many of modern medicine's greatest advances. However,
antibiotic-resistant bacteria are emerging as critical public health threats,
with recent accounts of bacterial strains resistant to all approved antibiotics. 
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are naturally occurring molecules with the
potential to serve as the basis for a new class of anti-infectives targeting
these difficult-to-treat bacteria. The unique activities and features of AMPs are
discussed, with a focus toward the clinical importance of priming the antibiotic 
pipeline and the role AMPs can fulfill in the future of fighting drug-resistant
bacteria.
