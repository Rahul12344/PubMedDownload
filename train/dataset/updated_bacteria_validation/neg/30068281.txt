BACKGROUND: In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the global
burden of cancer which has been associated with several factors including
environmental influence, aging, diet, infectious agents, hormonal imbalance and
chronic inflammation, among others. Cancerous cells utilize more glucose for its 
proliferation and survival than normal cells. Thus, the regulation of glucose
consumption of cancerous cells through the inhibition of glucose
transporter-4-protein (GLUT4) encoded by solute carrier family-2-member-4-gene
(Slc2a4) by selected phytochemicals from Solanum xanthocarpum may serve as a new 
therapeutic candidate for the treatment of cancer.
METHODS: The seven identified potential inhibitors of GLUT4 from Solanum
xanthocarpum were retrieved from PubChem database. Examination of their
drug-likeness, toxicity prediction and molecular docking studies of these
compounds with GLUT4 were carried out using online tools such as Molinspiration, 
PreADMET V.2.0 and Patchdock server.
RESULTS: The findings revealed that, five out of the seven compounds fulfil oral 
drugability of Lipinski's rule of five (RO5) while two slightly meet the criteria
of RO5. Conversely, five of the compounds are predicted to be mutagen while the
remaining two are predicted to be safe for the body. Additionally, stigmasterol
glucoside has higher binding-affinity (7590) with GLUT4 when compared to
doxorubicin (6600) the control.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that stigmasterol glucoside from Solanum
xanthocarpum could be a promising therapeutic agent with better therapeutic
efficacy than doxorubicin in the treatment of cancer via the inhibition of GLUT4.
