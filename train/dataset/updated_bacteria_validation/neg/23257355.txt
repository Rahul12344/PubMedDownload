Clinical vignette: A 38-year-old man consults you in the GI clinic because of
frequent episodes of epigastric pain, nausea, and tiredness. His blood count
shows signs of mild iron deficiency anemia. Upper GI endoscopy was normal, but
antral and corpus biopsy specimens show evidence of gastric atrophy and
Helicobacter pylori infection. Colonoscopy and capsule endoscopy showed no
evidence of lesions in the large or small bowel. He receives a standard one-week 
course eradication therapy consisting of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI),
amoxicillin, and clarithromycin. His symptoms improve, but his infection persists
and he remains mildly anemic. He asks you whether the infection must be
eradicated, as he read on the Internet that it can cause stomach cancer. He is
also concerned about the anemia.
