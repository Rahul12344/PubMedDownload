This study evaluated the cytotoxicity and effect of fragments derived from three 
oral cationic peptides (CP): LL-37, D6-17 and D1-23 against cariogenic bacteria
under planktonic and biofilm conditions. For cytotoxicity analysis, two
epithelial cell lines were used. The minimum inhibitory concentration and the
minimal bactericidal concentration were determined for the CP fragments and the
control (chlorhexidine-CHX) against cariogenic bacteria. The fractional
inhibitory concentration was obtained for the combinations of CP fragments on
Streptococcus mutans. Biofilm assays were conducted with the best antimicrobial
CP fragment against S. mutans. The results indicated that D6-17 was not
cytotoxic. D1-23, LL-37 and CHX were not cytotoxic in low concentrations. D1-23
presented the best bactericidal activity against S. mutans, S. mitis and S.
salivarius. Combinations of CP fragments did not show a synergic effect. D1-23
presented a higher activity against S. mutans biofilm than CHX. It was concluded 
that D1-23 showed a substantial effect against cariogenic bacteria and low
cytotoxicity.
