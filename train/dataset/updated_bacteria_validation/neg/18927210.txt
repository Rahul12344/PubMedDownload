The complex interaction of genetic, microbial, and environmental factors may
result in continuous activation of the mucosal immune system leading to
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Most present treatments for IBD involve
altering or suppressing the aberrant immune response; however, the role of the
intestinal microbiota in the pathophysiology of IBD is becoming more evident. The
epithelial layer is essential for the proper functioning of the gastrointestinal 
tract, and its increased permeability to the luminal antigens may lead to the
inflammatory processes and mucosal damage observed in IBD. Factors affecting the 
efficacy of the epithelial barrier include presence of pathogenic bacteria (e.g.,
Helicobacter spp.), presence of probiotic bacteria, availability of selected
nutrients, and others. Defective function of the mucosal barrier might facilitate
the contact of bacterial antigens and adjuvants with innate and adaptive immune
cells to generate prolonged inflammatory responses. This review will briefly
describe the complex structure of the epithelial barrier in the context of
bacterial-mucosal interactions observed in human IBD and mouse models of colitis.
