Active extrusion is a common mechanism underlying detoxification of heavy metals,
drugs and antibiotics in bacteria, protozoa and mammals. In Escherichia coli, the
ArsAB pump provides resistance to arsenite and antimonite. This pump consists of 
a soluble ATPase (ArsA) and a membrane channel (ArsB). ArsA contains two
nucleotide-binding sites (NBSs) and a binding site for arsenic or antimony.
Binding of metalloids stimulates ATPase activity. The crystal structure of ArsA
reveals that both NBSs and the metal-binding site are located at the interface
between two homologous domains. A short stretch of residues connecting the
metal-binding site to the NBSs provides a signal transduction pathway that
conveys information on metal occupancy to the ATP hydrolysis sites. Based on
these structural features, we propose that the metal-binding site is involved
directly in the process of vectorial translocation of arsenite or antimonite
across the membrane. The relative positions of the NBS and the inferred mechanism
of allosteric activation of ArsA provide a useful model for the interaction of
the catalytic domains in other transport ATPases.
