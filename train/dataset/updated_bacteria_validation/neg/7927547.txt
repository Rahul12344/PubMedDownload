A total of 365 non pregnant women with bad obstetrics history (BOH) were studied 
with a control group of 100 women who had delivered full term clinically normal
infants. The presence of C. trachomatis antigen and T. gondii (IgM) and M.
hominis (IgG) antibodies was assessed by ELISA test. C. trachomatis antigen was
detected in 28.2 per cent of women with BOH whereas T. gondii and M. hominis
specific antibodies were found in 43.83 and 27.1 per cent respectively, these
were highly significant (P < 0.001) in comparison with the control group. In
case, facilities for culture are not available then detection of antigen and IgM 
class of antibodies by ELISA can pinpoint current infection.
