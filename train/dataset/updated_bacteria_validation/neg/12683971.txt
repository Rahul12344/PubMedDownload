When the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium (IHGSC) published its
draft of the human genome in February 2001, several genes were identified as
possible bacteria-to-vertebrate transfers (BVTs). These genes were identified by 
their highly significant sequence similarity to bacterial genes in BLAST
searches, and by their lack of matches among non-vertebrate eukaryote genes. Many
were later rejected as BVTs by several methods, including recovery of probable
orthologs from the genomes of incompletely sequenced eukaryotes. Whereas the BVT 
issue has received considerable attention, there has been no compilation of all
potential BVTs considered to date, nor any proposal of a single comprehensive
method for rigorously establishing the veracity of a putative BVT. In reviewing
the work to date, we list all of the proteins examined and propose systematic
tests to investigate whether a vertebrate gene proposed as a BVT is indeed of
bacterial origin. We use the proposed strategy to test--and reject--one of the
BVTs from the original IHGSC list.
