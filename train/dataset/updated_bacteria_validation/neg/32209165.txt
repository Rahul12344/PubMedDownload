BackgroundDiphtheria is a potentially fatal disease caused by toxigenic strains
of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, C. ulcerans or C. pseudotuberculosis.AimOur
objective was to review the epidemiology of diphtheria in the United Kingdom (UK)
and the impact of recent changes in public health management and
surveillance.MethodsPutative human toxigenic diphtheria isolates in the UK are
sent for species confirmation and toxigenicity testing to the National Reference 
Laboratory. Clinical, epidemiological and microbiological information for
toxigenic cases between 2009 and 2017 are described in this population-based
prospective surveillance study.ResultsThere were 33 toxigenic cases of diphtheria
aged 4 to 82 years. Causative species were C. diphtheriae (n = 18) and C.
ulcerans (n = 15). Most C. diphtheriae cases were cutaneous (14/18) while more
than half of C. ulcerans cases had respiratory presentations (8/15). Two thirds
(23/33) of cases were inadequately immunised. Two cases with C. ulcerans
infections died, both inadequately immunised. The major risk factor for C.
diphtheriae aquisition was travel to an endemic area and for C. ulcerans, contact
with a companion animal. Most confirmed C. diphtheriae or C. ulcerans isolates
(441/507; 87%) submitted for toxigenicity testing were non-toxigenic, however,
toxin positivity rates were higher (15/23) for C. ulcerans than C. diphtheriae
(18/469). Ten non-toxigenic toxin gene-bearing (NTTB) C. diphtheriae were also
detected.ConclusionDiphtheria is a rare disease in the UK. In the last decade,
milder cutaneous C. diphtheriae cases have become more frequent. Incomplete
vaccination status was strongly associated with the risk of hospitalisation and
death.
