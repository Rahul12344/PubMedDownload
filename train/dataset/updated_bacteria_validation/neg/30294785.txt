Turkey was the largest rainbow trout producer of the European countries in 2016, 
and the reason for this production is mainly attributed to its egg and fry
production. Flavobacterium psychrophilum cause the highest rates of mortality in 
the starting to feeding stages of the fish. In the present study, twenty-five
F. psychrophilum isolates recovered from rainbow trout, coruh trout and brook
trout were analysed by RAPD-PCR, ERIC-PCR, REP-PCR and PCR-RFLP, including 16S
rRNA, gyrA and gyrB gene regions and PCR-based serotyping method. The PCR-based
molecular analysis showed that the isolates could not be differentiated exactly
according to isolation source and geographical region. Most isolates were of
type-1 and type-2, and some of them were of type-0 and type-3; in addition, one
isolate showed a unique serotype. The combined analysis results showed that
F. psychrophilum isolates discriminated as five different genotypes and all
isolates were successfully discriminated based on host.
