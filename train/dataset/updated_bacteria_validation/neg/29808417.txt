The incidence of spondylodiscitis is increasing and attributable to an aging
population with multimorbidities. Spondylodiscitis represents a life-threatening 
disease. Typical clinical manifestations often involve nonspecific symptoms with 
back pain; however, due to the frequent absence of fever the disease is often
overlooked. Pathogen detection and spinal imaging with magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) are essential for the diagnosis. Identification of the causative pathogen
is particularly important for initiating targeted antibiotic treatment.
Debridement and stabilization are the mainstays of surgical management, even
though foreign material must be implanted into the focus of inflammation.
