'Streptomyces caelicus', an antibiotic-producing species of the genus
Streptomyces, and Streptomyces canchipurensis Li et al. 2015 are later
heterotypic synonyms of Streptomyces muensis Ningthoujam et al. 2014.

'Streptomyces caelicus' DSM 40835 was first reported as the producer of the
antibiotic griselimycin by some coworkers of Rhone Poulenc in 1971. The project
on isolation of the antibiotic compound was stopped because of the bad solubility
and selectivity of the compound towards Mycobacteria. At Sanofi-Aventis, Germany,
the project was re-evaluated in 2007 and the gene cluster of griselimycin could
be identified, characterized and was patented in 2013. At this time, 'S.
caelicus' was an invalid name. During the strain characterization work, it was
found that 'S. caelicus' belongs to the group of species of the genus
Streptomyces which show an unusual heterogeneity of the 16S rRNA gene sequences. 
However, high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities to Streptomyces muensis JCM
17576T and Streptomyces canchipurensis JCM 17575T were obvious. Here, we present 
a comparative description of 'Streptomyces caelicus' DS 9461 (=DSM 40835=NCCB
100592) with S. muensis and S. canchipurensis by use of a polyphasic taxonomy
approach and additional comparison of some housekeeping genes by multilocus
sequence analysis (MLSA). An emended description of Streptomyces muensis is
provided as a result of this work.
