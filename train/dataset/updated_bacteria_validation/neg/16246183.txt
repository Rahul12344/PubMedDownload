BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Despite our understanding of the pathophysiology of
different types of pancreatic fluid collections (PFC), few studies have attempted
to correlate the biochemical analysis of PFC contents with clinical and
radiological characteristics. The aim of this study was to assess the predictive 
value of fluid analysis for discerning collection type (pseudocyst vs acute fluid
collection with necrosis), presence of infection or communication with the
pancreatic duct in the setting of acute and chronic pancreatitis.
METHODS: Pancreatic fluid from 34 consecutive patients undergoing endotherapy of 
PFC was prospectively analyzed for seven variables: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 
total protein, albumin, glucose, amylase, lipase and specific gravity.
RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, adjusting for age and gender, high intracystic
levels of protein (OR 6.2; 95% CI 1.3-37.0), LDH (OR 6.8 [2.3-38.3]), and albumin
(OR 7.8 [1.3-67.4]), and low levels of glucose (OR 0.2 [0.03-0.9]) predicted the 
presence of PFC infection. The optimal threshold value for protein was 1000 g/dL,
which achieved a sensitivity of 73% and specificity of 75% for detecting
infection; the optimal cut-off for LDH was 1000 U/L (sensitivity 64%, specificity
85%), and the cut-off for albumin was 500 g/dL (sensitivity 75%, specificity
85%). There were no statistically significant differences in biochemical fluid
analysis with respect to fluid collection type (pseudocysts vs acute fluid
collection with necrosis) and the presence of pancreatic duct communication.
CONCLUSIONS: Biochemical analysis of PFC fluid is clinically helpful in detecting
fluid infection in patients with bacteria on Gram stain or positive fluid
cultures. Our findings fail to support the utility of fluid analysis in
characterizing cyst type, and we caution against its use in distinguishing
pseudocysts from acute fluid collection with necrosis.
