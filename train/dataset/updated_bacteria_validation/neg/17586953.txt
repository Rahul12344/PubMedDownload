Visceral leishmaniasis is endemic in southern Saudi Arabia. We prospectively
evaluated 121 patients with visceral leishmaniasis at King Fahad Hospital in
Gizan. All patients were infants and children. Seasonal variation was observed
with more cases presenting in late spring and summer and few in winter. The
predominant clinical features in these patients were chronic fever, abdominal
distention, weight loss and hepatosplenomegaly. Lymphadenopathy was rare in
contrast to African kala-azar. Common laboratory abnormalities included anemia,
leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia and hypergammaglobulinemia. Liver
function tests were deranged in one-third of patients. Leishmania
hemagglutination test was positive in all patients and all of them had positive
bone marrow smear or culture for Leishmania donovani. Patients responded well to 
stibogluconate (Pentostam) therapy with a cure rate of 96.7%. Four patients died 
in the first few days of therapy. Jaundice and grossly deranged liver function
tests were found to be bad prognostic signs.
