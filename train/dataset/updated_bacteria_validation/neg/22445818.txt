Campylobacter jejuni is a major bacterial cause of gastroenteritis world-wide.
C. jejuni produces a range of glycans including lipooligosaccharide (LOS), an
important virulence factor. The genetic content of the LOS synthesis locus varies
between C. jejuni strains and 19 classes have been described. Three LOS synthesis
genes of C. jejuni strain 81116 (NCTC 11828), wlaRG, wlaTB and wlaTC were the
focus of this study. WlaRG and the remaining two proteins of interest share
sequence similarity to aminotransferases and glycosyltransferases, respectively. 
These genes were insertionally inactivated and phenotypically characterised. Each
mutant produced truncated LOS. Mutants lacking WlaRG, WlaTB and WlaTC produced
LOS with reduced immunogenicity. Both the wlaRG and wlaTC mutants were non-motile
and aflagellate. In vitro invasion and adhesion assays revealed that the wlaRG,
wlaTB and wlaTC mutants displayed reduced adherence to chicken embryo
fibroblasts. All mutants were less invasive of human cells than 81116 confirming 
the role of intact LOS during invasion of human cells in vitro. Here we propose
the general composition for the 81116 LOS core backbone based on capillary
electrophoresis-mass spectrometry.
