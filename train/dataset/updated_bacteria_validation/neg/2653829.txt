A previously unreported endoribonuclease has been identified in Escherichia coli,
which has a preference for hydrolysis of pyrimidine-adenosine (Pyd-Ado) bonds in 
RNA. It was purified about 7000-fold to give a single band after
SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; the eluted protein gave the same RNase
specificity. The sizes of the native and denatured enzymes agreed suggesting that
the enzyme exists as a monomer of approximately 26 kDa. It is called RNase M. The
only other reported broadly specific endoribonuclease in E. coli is RNase I, a
periplasmic enzyme. Based on differences in charge, heat stability and substrate 
specificity, it was clear that RNase M is not RNase I. The specificity of RNase M
was remarkably similar to that of pancreatic RNase A even though the two enzymes 
differ in charge characteristics and size. Earlier studies had shown that mRNA
from the lactose operon of E. coli is hydrolyzed in vivo primarily between
Pyd-Ado bonds [Cannistraro et al. (1986) J. Mol. Biol. 192, 257-274] We propose
that this major RNase activity accounts for these cleavages observed in vivo and 
that it is the endonuclease for mRNA degradation in E. coli.
