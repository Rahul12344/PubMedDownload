Photosynthetic bacteria have to deal with the risk of photooxidative stress that 
occurs in presence of light and oxygen due to the photosensitizing activity of
(bacterio-) chlorophylls. Facultative phototrophs of the genus Rhodobacter adapt 
the formation of photosynthetic complexes to oxygen and light conditions, but
cannot completely avoid this stress if environmental conditions suddenly change. 
R. capsulatus has a stronger pigmentation and faster switches to phototrophic
growth than R. sphaeroides. However, its photooxidative stress response has not
been investigated. Here, we compare both species by transcriptomics and
proteomics, revealing that proteins involved in oxidation-reduction processes,
DNA, and protein damage repair play pivotal roles. These functions are likely
universal to many phototrophs. Furthermore, the alternative sigma factors RpoE
and RpoHII are induced in both species, even though the genetic localization of
the rpoE gene, the RpoE protein itself, and probably its regulon, are different. 
Despite sharing the same habitats, our findings also suggest individual
strategies. The crtIB-tspO operon, encoding proteins for biosynthesis of
carotenoid precursors and a regulator of photosynthesis, and cbiX, encoding a
putative ferrochelatase, are induced in R. capsulatus. This specific response
might support adaptation by maintaining high carotenoid-to-bacteriochlorophyll
ratios and preventing the accumulation of porphyrin-derived photosensitizers.
