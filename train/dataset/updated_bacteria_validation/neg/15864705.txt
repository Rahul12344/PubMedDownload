RATIONALE: We report on a cerebral infection by Pseudallescheria boydii in a
21-month-old boy after a near-drowning episode. MRI revealed multiple (> 60)
intracerebral abscesses.
METHODS: The surgical therapy included CSF drainage and microsurgical resection
of one abscess for microbiological diagnosis. Antimycotic therapy included
terbinafine and intraventricular caspofungin in addition to voriconazole.
RESULTS: Systemic side effects of chemotherapy were not observed. After placement
of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, the boy was transferred to a rehabilitation
clinic and improved neurologically. After 20 months, MRI documented a continuing 
remission of the disease.
CONCLUSION: Our case proves that an aggressive treatment should be undertaken and
can be successful in CNS pseudallescheriasis.
