Mammalian nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat containing proteins
(NLRs) are important pattern-recognition receptors, still the function of many
NLRs remains poorly defined. Here we review first insights into the molecular
function of NLRP10 highlighting the role of this specific NLR in innate and
adaptive immune responses.
