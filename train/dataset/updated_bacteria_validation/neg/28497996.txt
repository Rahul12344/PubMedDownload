No studies have reported the isolation of serotype Salmonella Isangi from cases
of salmonellosis in mainland China. We investigated an outbreak of foodborne
disease with salmonella and collected the samples from the patients and surplus
foods. Salmonella strains were isolated and the serotype was identified according
to the Kauffmann-White scheme. The relatedness of the isolates was determined
using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). 
Antimicrobial susceptibility was conducted by the broth microdilution method.
There were 74 diners in the case, 33 of which got ill, with an attack rate of
44.6% (33/74). A total of 24 samples were collected from the outbreak cases, six 
Salmonella Isangi strains were isolated and susceptible to all tested drugs. PFGE
and WGS analysis suggested that the pathogen dissemination through a single or
limited vector(s), the steamed fish and mixed food (fry spicy chicken, braised
pork ribs, and goose leg), may be the source of infection or be
cross-contaminated. We first report the characteristics of an outbreak and
molecular strain relatedness of Salmonella Isangi in mainland China.
