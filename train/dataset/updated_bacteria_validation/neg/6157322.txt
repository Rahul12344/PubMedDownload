Is there a specific stimulus of infectious-allergic bronchial asthma?

Ado AD, Fedoseeva VN.

1. Pigmented Neisseria species (Neisseria perflava, flava, subflava, sicca) are
constant inhabitants of patients with infectious asthma. 2. Of all the diverse
bronchial microflora of patients with infectious-allergic bronchial asthma, the
pigmented Neisseria species (Neisseria perflava, flava, subflava, sicca),
Staphylococci (Staphylococcus aureus, epidermidis), Klebsiella (Klebsiella
pneumoniae) are active sensitizers of the human broncho-pulmonary tract. 3.
Neisseria strains, possessing similar antigenic determinants to human lung
tissues, possess the highest allergenic activity. This raises the question of a
new criterion for evaluating the allergenicity of cultures according to their
antigenic characteristics. 4. In patients with infectious asthma allergy might
develop to some of the structures of microbial cells, in which antigenic
determinants, similar to human lung tissues are localized.
