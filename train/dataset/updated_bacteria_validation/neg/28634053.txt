Several short-term whole-organism bioassays based on transgenic aquatic models
are now under validation by the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development) to become standardized test guidelines for the evaluation of the
endocrine activity of substances. Evaluation of the endocrine disrupting capacity
of pesticides will be a domain of applicability of these future reference tests. 
The herbicide linuron and the insecticide fenoxycarb are two chemicals commonly
used in agricultural practices. While numerous studies indicate that linuron is
likely to be an endocrine disruptor, there is little information available on the
effect of fenoxycarb on vertebrate endocrine systems. Using whole-organism
bioassays based on transgenic Xenopus laevis tadpoles and medaka fry we assessed 
the potential of fenoxycarb and linuron to disrupt thyroid, androgen and estrogen
signaling. In addition we used in silico approach to simulate the affinity of
these two pesticides to human hormone receptors. Linuron elicited thyroid
hormone-like activity in tadpoles at all concentrations tested and, showed an
anti-estrogenic activity in medaka at concentrations 2.5mg/L and higher. Our
experiments suggest that, in addition to its previously established
anti-androgenic action, linuron exhibits thyroid hormone-like responses, as well 
as acting at the estrogen receptor level to inhibit estrogen signaling.
Fenoxycarb on the other hand, did not cause any changes in thyroid, androgen or
estrogen signaling at the concentrations tested.
