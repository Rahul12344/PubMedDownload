PURPOSE: Bloodstream infections remain an important cause of morbidity and
mortality. Rapid diagnosis can reduce the time from empiric antimicrobial therapy
to targeted therapy and improve patient outcomes.
METHODOLOGY: The fully automated Unyvero Blood Culture (BCU) Application (Curetis
GmbH) can identify a broad panel of pathogens (36 analytes covering over 50
pathogens) and 16 antibiotic resistance gene markers simultaneously in about 5 h.
The assay was evaluated in three clinical laboratories in comparison to routine
microbiological procedures.
RESULTS: A total of 207 blood cultures were included in the study, and 90.5 % of 
the species identified by culture were covered by the Unyvero BCU panel with an
overall sensitivity of 96.8 % and specificity of 99.8 %. The time to result was
reduced on average by about 34 h. The assay accurately identified 95 % of the
species, including 158/164 monomicrobial and 7/9 polymicrobial cultures. The
Unyvero BCU Cartridge detected a large number of resistance markers including
mecA (n=57), aac(6')aph(2'') (n=40), one vanB resistance gene, and six instances 
of blaCTX-M.
CONCLUSION: The Unyvero BCU Application provided fast, reliable results, while
significantly improving turnaround time in blood culture diagnostics.
