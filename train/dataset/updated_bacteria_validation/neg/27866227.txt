KEY MESSAGE: Genotypes with recombination events in the Triticum ventricosum
introgression on chromosome 7D allowed to fine-map resistance gene Pch1, the main
source of eyespot resistance in European winter wheat cultivars. Eyespot (also
called Strawbreaker) is a common and serious fungal disease of winter wheat
caused by the necrotrophic fungi Oculimacula yallundae and Oculimacula acuformis 
(former name Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides). A genome-wide association
study (GWAS) for eyespot was performed with 732 microsatellite markers (SSR) and 
7761 mapped SNP markers derived from the 90 K iSELECT wheat array using a panel
of 168 European winter wheat varieties as well as three spring wheat varieties
and phenotypic evaluation of eyespot in field tests in three environments. Best
linear unbiased estimations (BLUEs) were calculated across all trials and ranged 
from 1.20 (most resistant) to 5.73 (most susceptible) with an average value of
4.24 and a heritability of H 2 = 0.91. A total of 108 SSR and 235 SNP
marker-trait associations (MTAs) were identified by considering associations with
a -log10 (P value) ≥3.0. Significant MTAs for eyespot-score BLUEs were found on
chromosomes 1D, 2A, 2D, 3D, 5A, 5D, 6A, 7A and 7D for the SSR markers and
chromosomes 1B, 2A, 2B, 2D, 3B and 7D for the SNP markers. For 18 varieties
(10.5%), a highly resistant phenotype was detected that was linked to the
presence of the resistance gene Pch1 on chromosome 7D. The identification of
genotypes with recombination events in the introgressed genomic segment from
Triticum ventricosum harboring the Pch1 resistance gene on chromosome 7DL allowed
the fine-mapping of this gene using additional SNP markers and a potential
candidate gene Traes_7DL_973A33763 coding for a CC-NBS-LRR class protein was
identified.
