Typhoid fever affects an estimated 22 million people annually and causes 216,000 
deaths worldwide. We conducted an investigation in August and September 2010 to
examine the acceptability of typhoid vaccine in Neno District, Malawi where a
typhoid outbreak was ongoing. We used qualitative methods, including freelisting 
exercises, key informant and in-depth interviews, and group discussions.
Respondents associated illness with exposure to "bad wind," and transmission was 
believed to be airborne. Typhoid was considered extremely dangerous because of
its rapid spread, the debilitating conditions it produced, the number of related 
fatalities, and the perception that it was highly contagious. Respondents were
skeptical about the effectiveness of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH)
interventions. The perceived severity of typhoid and fear of exposure,
uncertainty about the effectiveness of WaSH measures, and widespread belief in
the efficacy of vaccines in preventing disease resulted in an overwhelming
interest in receiving typhoid vaccine during an outbreak.
