Using DNA probes specific for the genes encoding Vero cytotoxins 1 and 2 in
hybridization experiments on faecal samples, Vero cytotoxin-producing Escherichia
coli (VTEC) of serogroup O 157 were detected in 21 of 63 cases of haemorrhagic
colitis, 9 of 31 cases of non-bloody diarrhoea and 14 of 68 cases of haemolytic
uraemic syndrome. Compared with these results sorbitol-MacConkey agar in
conjunction with a specific O 157 antiserum gave a sensitivity of 62% in
haemorrhagic colitis, 56% in non-bloody diarrhoea and 57% in haemolytic uraemic
syndrome. The specificity of this method was 100% in all three groups. This
demonstrates that sorbitol-MacConkey agar is a useful screening method for the
detection of VTEC of serogroup O 157 when used in conjunction with a specific
homologous antiserum. However, this method does not detect VTEC belonging to
other serogroups and such strains were found, particularly in cases of haemolytic
uraemic syndrome.
