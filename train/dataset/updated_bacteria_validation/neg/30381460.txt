Natural killer (NK) cells play a critical role in controlling malignancies.
Susceptibility or resistance to lung cancer, for example, specifically depends on
NK cell function. Nevertheless, intrinsic factors that control NK cell-mediated
clearance of lung cancer are unknown. Here we report that NK cells exposed to
exogenous major histocompatibility class I (MHCI) provide a significant
immunologic barrier to the growth and progression of malignancy. Clearance of
lung cancer is facilitated by up-regulation of NKG2D, NKp46, and other activating
receptors upon exposure to environmental MHCI. Surface expression of the
inhibitory receptor Ly49C/I, on the other hand, is down-regulated upon exposure
to tumor-bearing tissue. We thus demonstrate that NK cells exhibit dynamic
plasticity in surface expression of both activating and inhibitory receptors
based on the environmental context. Our data suggest that altering the activation
state of NK cells may contribute to immunologic control of lung and possibly
other cancers.
