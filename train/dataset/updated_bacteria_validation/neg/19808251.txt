Group 1 CD1 (CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c)-restricted T cells recognize mycobacterial
lipid antigens and are found at higher frequencies in Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
(Mtb)-infected individuals. However, their role and dynamics during infection
remain unknown because of the lack of a suitable small animal model. We have
generated human group 1 CD1 transgenic (hCD1Tg) mice that express all three human
group 1 CD1 isoforms and support the development of group 1 CD1-restricted T
cells with diverse T cell receptor usage. Both mycobacterial infection and
immunization with Mtb lipids elicit group 1 CD1-restricted Mtb lipid-specific T
cell responses in hCD1Tg mice. In contrast to CD1d-restricted NKT cells, which
rapidly respond to initial stimulation but exhibit anergy upon reexposure, group 
1 CD1-restricted T cells exhibit delayed primary responses and more rapid
secondary responses, similar to conventional T cells. Collectively, our data
demonstrate that group 1 CD1-restricted T cells participate in adaptive immune
responses upon mycobacterial infection and could serve as targets for the
development of novel Mtb vaccines.
