Analysis of the complete DNA sequences of many microbial genomes available
reveals a fair number of putative ORFs without an identified function. A
systematic scan of the Escherichia coli chromosome was achieved by random
transposition with a newly developed Tn5 minitransposon derivative carrying the
arabinose-inducible araP(BAD) promoter oriented outward at one end
(Tn5-araP(BAD)). The transposon insertion mutants obtained were assayed for
conditional lethal phenotypes (arabinose dependence or sensitivity), for growth
at two temperatures (37 and 15 degrees C) and in different media (rich and
minimal medium). The Tn5-araP(BAD)-tagged genes were identified by sequencing the
transposon insertion points. In this way we found a new essential gene cluster
(yhbN-yhbG), produced conditional lethal (arabinose-dependent) mutations in
already known essential genes (folD, frr, plsC, thiL, serS, thrS, and trpS) and
provided a new phenotype (cold sensitivity) to other known genes (holD, ahpC, and
tolA). Moreover, we identified eight putative ORFs (kch, ycaM, ycbQ, yddA, yddB, 
ydeK, ydeX, and yliF) that appear to be required in optimum growth conditions
(rich medium at 37 degrees C) but not in the cold and in minimal medium.
