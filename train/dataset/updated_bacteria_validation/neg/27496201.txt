BACKGROUND: Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) significantly contribute to diarrhea
in piglets and weaners. The smallholder pig producers in Uganda identified
diarrhea as one of the major problems especially in piglets. The aim of this
study was to; i) characterize the virulence factors of E. coli strains isolated
from diarrheic and non-diarrheic suckling piglets and weaners from smallholder
herds in northern and eastern Uganda and ii) identify and describe the
post-mortem picture of ETEC infection in severely diarrheic piglets. Rectal swab 
samples were collected from 83 piglets and weaners in 20 herds and isolated E.
coli were characterized by PCR, serotyping and hemolysis.
RESULTS: The E. coli strains carried genes for the heat stable toxins STa, STb
and EAST1 and adhesins F4 and AIDA-I. The genes for the heat labile toxin LT and 
adhesins F5, F6, F18 and F41 were not detected in any of the E. coli isolates.
Where the serogroup could be identified, E. coli isolates from the same diarrheic
pig belonged to the same serogroup. The prevalence of EAST1, STb, Stx2e, STa,
AIDA-I, and F4 in the E. coli isolates from suckling piglets and weaners
(diarrheic and non-diarrheic combined) was 29, 26.5, 2.4, 1.2, 16, and 8.4 %,
respectively. However the prevalence of F4 and AIDA-I in E. coli from diarrheic
suckling piglets alone was 22.2 and 20 %, respectively. There was no significant 
difference in the prevalence of the individual virulence factors in E. coli from 
the diarrheic and non-diarrheic pigs (p > 0.05). The main ETEC strains isolated
from diarrheic and non-diarrheic pigs included F4/STb/EAST1 (7.2 %), F4/STb
(1.2 %), AIDA/STb/EAST1 (8 %) and AIDA/STb (8 %). At post-mortem, two diarrheic
suckling piglets carrying ETEC showed intact intestinal villi, enterocytes and
brush border but with a layer of cells attached to the brush border, suggestive
of ETEC infections.
CONCLUSION: This study has shown that the F4 fimbriae is the most predominant in 
E. coli from diarrheic piglets in the study area and therefore an F4-based
vaccine should be considered one of the preventive measures for controlling ETEC 
infections in the piglets in northern and eastern Uganda.
