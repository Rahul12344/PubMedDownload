Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a promising platform for expression of full-length 
antibodies owing to its several advantages as a production host (fast growth,
well characterized genetics, low manufacturing cost), however, low titers from
shake flask (typically < 5 mg/L) has limited its use for production of
research-grade material in antibody discovery programs. In this work, we used
global transcriptional machinery engineering (gTME) with high throughput
screening to increase the expression of full-length antibodies in E. coli. A
library of E. coli mutants carrying mutations in the global sigma factor RpoD
were generated and screened using the Bacterial Antibody Display (BAD) method for
enhanced expression. RpoD mutants were isolated that resulted in full-length
antibody titers of up to 130.7 ± 6.6 mg/L of shake flask culture with chaperone
co-expression. These results could be useful for production of several antibodies
quickly in shake flasks for characterization (e.g. antigen binding, biological
function) during the early discovery phase.
