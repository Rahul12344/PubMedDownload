In this paper we describe how utilization of low molecular weight
alginate-derived oligosaccharide (ADO) and chito-oligosaccharide (COS) in
conjunction with antibiotics, could more effectively inhibit the growth of
wild-type and resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Inhibition is effected by
modulating the bacteria's quorum sensing (QS) system, thus regulating biofilm
formation and reducing resistance to antibiotic treatment. This can be
demonstrated by using conventional MIC screening. COS showed synergistic effects 
with azithromycin, whereas ADO indicated additive effects against wild-type P.
aeruginosa. Using electrospray-ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS),
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flightmass spectroscopy
(MALDI-TOF-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), the chemical structure of
ADO and of COS was characterized. The wild-type and resistant strains were
identified by 16S rRNA sequence analysis. This report demonstrates the
feasibility of attenuating the tolerance of P. aeruginosa to azithromycin by
using specific marine oligosaccharides.
