The use of preventive antibiotics has become the standard of care in the
management of patients with multiple trauma who have injuries at risk for
infection. In many areas of surgical practice, preventive antibiotic utilization 
has been restricted to the perioperative period only. In this study we reviewed a
series of trauma patients with combined blunt chest injuries and extremity
fractures to determine whether the duration of postoperative antibiotic
administration would have adverse effects upon nosocomial pneumonia rates and
severity.
