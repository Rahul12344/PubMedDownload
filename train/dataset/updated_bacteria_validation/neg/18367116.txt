BACKGROUND: Transrectal ultrasound guided prostate needle biopsies are routinely 
performed to diagnose and stage prostate cancer. We prospectively evaluated the
safety, morbidity, and complication rate.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 336 patients who underwent transrectal
ultrasound guided prostate needle biopsy. A post-biopsy questionnaire was sent to
the patients 4 weeks after biopsy concerning questions about minor complications.
Information on major complications was obtained by telephone interview.
RESULTS: There were 2 major and 48 minor complications. The most common
complication was hematuria in 6.5% of cases, followed by pain while urinating in 
6.0% of cases. There was no statistically significance difference between
hematuria and aspirin/thrombolytic drug use (P = 0.170) and between positive
microbiology in urine and elevated temperature (P = 0.665).
CONCLUSIONS: Transrectal ultrasound guided prostate needle biopsy is safe for
diagnosing prostate cancer with few major and minor complications.
Aspirin/thrombolytic drug use in patients' history is no risk factor for
hematuria. Positive microbiology in urine before biopsy is no risk factor for a
higher infection rate.
