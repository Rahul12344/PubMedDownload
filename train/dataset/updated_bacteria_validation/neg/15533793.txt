We analyzed 15,512 unique transcripts from wild-type Danio rerio using a long
oligonucleotide microarray containing >16,000 65-mers probes. Total RNA was
isolated from staged embryos at 2 h intervals over a 24-h period. On average, at 
any given time point, 27% of the probe set detected corresponding transcripts in 
embryonic RNA. There were two predominant patterns in the nearly 4000 genes that 
changed expression in at least one time point during the first 24 hpf. At 12 hpf,
we detected 420 up-regulated and 386 down-regulated genes. By 24 hpf, the number 
of up- and down-regulated genes had increased to 954 and 766, respectively. While
the majority of these genes maintained their new level of expression for the
duration of the time course, we identified five genes with phasic regulation over
the 24-h time course. Two of these genes, germ cell nuclear factor and mesogenin,
have been identified as being expressed during gastrulation (5 1/4 to 10 h
postfertilization) and subsequently repressed. A cluster containing 36 distinct
ribosomal proteins was up-regulated at 12 h, indicating a capability for de novo 
protein synthesis during and after this stage. Twenty-three muscle-specific genes
were up-regulated late during the initial 24 hpf, corresponding to the
development and differentiation of the somites.
