Two types of lactose-binding lectins, AJL-1 and AJL-2, were purified from the
skin mucus extract of the Japanese eel Anguilla japonica by lactose affinity
chromatography and subsequent gel filtration. The molecular masses of AJL-1 and
AJL-2 were 16,091 and 31,743 Da, respectively. Intact AJL-1 was comprised of two 
identical 16-kDa subunits having blocked N termini and no disulfide bonds. AJL-2 
was a homodimer with disulfide bonds. Based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence
of the AJL-2 monomer, the nucleotide sequence of cDNA encoding this lectin was
determined by 3'- and 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The deduced amino acid
sequence showed approximately 30% homology with C-type lectins, which bind to
carbohydrates in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. In addition, AJL-2 exhibited highly
conserved consensus amino acid residues of the C-type carbohydrate recognition
domain, although this lectin showed Ca(2+)-independent activity. Gene expression 
of AJL-2 was detected only in the skin by Northern blot analysis, and this lectin
localization was demonstrated in the club cells by immunohistochemistry. These
results indicate that AJL-2 is secreted on the body surface and function as a
component of skin mucus. AJL-2 agglutinated Escherichia coli and suppressed its
growth, suggesting that this lectin is involved in host defense.
