OBJECTIVE: Chewing gum may act as a masking or a therapeutic agent against the
different chemical compounds that are responsible for oral malodor. An open-label
exploratory study investigated the effect of mastication and aromatic components 
of chewing gum on reducing oral volatile sulfur compounds.
METHOD AND MATERIALS: Twelve dental students (5 males and 7 females) acted as
their own controls. Toothbrushing stopped 12 hours before observations.
Measurements included organoleptic and volatile sulfur compound scores and the pH
of the anterior and posterior zones of the dorsal tongue. Measurements were made 
at 9 AM and 12 PM on 1 day for 3 successive weeks; week 1, no gum (control); week
2, test gum; week 3, unsweetened gum base. This open-label study was then
completed by an observer-blind study, according to the same schedule; the
recorded measurement was the plaque index.
RESULTS: The pH, volatile sulfur compounds, and organoleptic scores were similar 
for all groups. The pH was more basic in the posterior part than in the anterior 
zone of the dorsal tongue, irrespective of time and presence or absence of
chewing gum. In addition, the volatile sulfur compound score rose transiently
immediately after the test gum, and the organoleptic score fell in the first hour
only after the test gum. The two chewing gum groups seemed to have a greater
reduction in plaque index than did the control (no gum) group.
CONCLUSION: Chewing gum may have a valuable mechanical role in cleaning dental
surfaces, and the test gum may temporarily control bad breath. After 3 hours,
similar volatile sulfur compound scores were observed for subjects who chewed
either test or unsweetened gum base and control subjects.
