Functional evolution of an arsenic resistance operon has been accomplished by DNA
shuffling, involving multiple rounds of in vitro recombination and mutation of a 
pool of related sequences, followed by selection for increased resistance in
vivo. Homologous recombination is achieved by random fragmentation of the PCR
templates and reassembly by primerless PCR. Plasmid-determined arsenate
resistance from plasmid pl258 encoded by genes arsR, arsB, and arsC was evolved
in Escherichia coli. Three rounds of shuffling and selection resulted in cells
that grew in up to 0.5 M arsenate, a 40-fold increase in resistance. Whereas the 
native plasmid remained episomal, the evolved operon reproducibly integrated into
the bacterial chromosome. In the absence of shuffling, no increase in resistance 
was observed after four selection cycles, and the control plasmid remained
episomal. The integrated ars operon had 13 mutations. Ten mutations were located 
in arsB, encoding the arsenite membrane pump, resulting in a fourfold to sixfold 
increase in arsenite resistance. While arsC, the arsenate reductase gene,
contained no mutations, its expression level was increased, and the rate of
arsenate reduction was increased 12-fold. These results show that DNA shuffling
can improve the function of pathways by complex and unexpected mutational
mechanisms that may be activated by point mutation. These mechanisms may be
difficult to explain and are likely to be overlooked by rational design.
