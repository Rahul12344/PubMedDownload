We investigated differences in outcomes between 68 children hospitalized with
macrolide-sensitive Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MSMP group) and 25 children 
hospitalized with macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae pneumonia (MRMP group). In
the MRMP group, 19 children received macrolides and clinical failure occurred in 
six of which five had pneumonia progression during therapy.
