Gene transfection techniques have provided powerful methods to examine the roles 
of cellular and retroviral oncogenes in the transformation process in rodent
fibroblasts. However, the use of such techniques with diploid human fibroblasts
has been limited. We have developed transfection procedures to reproducibly
transfect such cells with oncogenes, and methods for the biological
characterization of the transformants. We have shown that the v-sis and T24 H-ras
oncogenes, as well as the platelet-derived growth factor gene (PDGF2/c-sis), are 
capable of inducing a transformed phenotype in normal diploid human fibroblasts, 
but are not capable of conferring infinite lifespan or making such cells
tumorigenic.
