This study shows that typing through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used 
to differentiate between strains of Campylobacter and Arcobacter, whereas by
means of conventional biotyping Arcobacter might be identified as atypical
Campylobacter. Microaerophilic "campylobacter-like" organisms were isolated from 
several drinking water treatment plants as well as environmental sources. The
strains were characterized by biotyping and PCR amplification of Campylobacter
flaA/flaB and 16s-rRNA Arcobacter butzleri-specific genes.
