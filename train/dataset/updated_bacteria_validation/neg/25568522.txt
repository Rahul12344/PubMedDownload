Historical developments and advancements in cesarean section techniques and
logistics have reduced the maternal and neonatal risks associated with the
procedure, while increasing the number of operatively completed pregnancies for
medically unjustifiable reasons. The uncritical attitude towards cesarean section
and the fast emergence of 'modern' diseases such as obesity at a young age,
asthma, type 1 diabetes mellitus and various forms of dermatitis have stimulated 
researches associating cesarean section with these diseases. Intestinal flora of 
the children born by cesarean section contains less bifidobacteria, i.e. their
intestinal flora is similar to the intestinal flora in diabetic individuals. In
children born by cesarean section, the 'good' maternal bacterial that are
normally found in the maternal birth canal and rectum are lacking, while the
'bad' bacteria that may endanger the child's immune system are frequently
present. In children born by vaginal delivery, the 'good' maternal bacteria
stimulate the newborn's white blood cells and other components of the immune
system, which has been taken as a basis for the hypotheses explaining the evident
association of the above morbidities and delivery by cesarean section.
