Two novel trialkyl-substituted aromatic acids, solwaric acids A and B, were
isolated from a marine Solwaraspora sp. cultivated from the ascidian Trididemnum 
orbiculatum. Solwaric acids A and B were isotopically labeled with U-¹³C glucose,
and analysis of a ¹³C-¹³C COSY allowed for unambiguous determination of the
location of the phenyl methyl group. The two novel compounds demonstrated
antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).
