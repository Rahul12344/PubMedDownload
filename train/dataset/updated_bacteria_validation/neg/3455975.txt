Production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies to Bacteroides
gingivalis.

Simonson LG, Merrell BR, Rouse RF, Shklair IL.

The rapid detection of Bacteroides gingivalis by immunological methods using
monoclonal antibodies could greatly improve the diagnosis and prognosis of severe
periodontal disease in adults. In this study, three distinct hybridomas were
produced which secrete monoclonal antibodies to soluble and whole-cell antigen
preparations of B. gingivalis. The BGII, V F9/2D hybridoma produced a murine
antibody that can detect all of the B. gingivalis isolates studied while never
cross-reacting with the other oral microbial antigens tested.
