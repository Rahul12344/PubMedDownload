Cortisol production in fry of rainbow trout (367-456 mg body weight) infected
with the ectoparasitic monogenean Gyrodactylus derjavini (mean intensities 4.7
and 4.9 parasites per fish) was studied at two temperature levels, 4-6 degrees C 
and 11-12 degrees C, respectively. Due to difficulties in obtaining an adequate
amount of plasma from the small sized fish, the corticosteroid concentration was 
measured in the body fluid recovered (as supernatant) after sonication and
centrifugation of whole fry. Infected fry at 11-12 degrees C showed an elevated
level of cortisol compared to uninfected fry. However, the cortisol concentration
was lower than in fish exposed to handling stress. At 4 degrees C, the cortisol
level in infected fish compared to uninfected was insignificantly increased. The 
findings are discussed in relation to the role of monogeneans as inducers of
secondary infections.
