Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of the pathogenicity island ETT2 and to
examine the relationship between the ETT2 locus and other virulence factors in
Escherichia coli (E. coli) isolated from piglets with diarrhea. A total of 354 E.
coli strains isolated from scouring piglets were tested using PCR for the
presence of the ETT2 locus. The E. coli strains were also analyzed for
enterotoxins, fimbriae, non-fimbrial adhesin, Shiga toxins, pathogenicity
islands, α-haemolysin (hlyA), afa8 gene cluster and autotransporter protease
(sepA) genes. The results showed that 215 (60.7%) of the isolates possessed the
ETT2 island. In 215 ETT2-positive E. coli strains, the virulence genes found were
EAST1 (27.0%), irp2 (18.6%), paa (15.4%), STb (7.9%), LT (6.5%), ler (4.7%), hlyA
(3.7%), AIDA-I (3.7%), K88 (3.7%), eae (3.3%), STa (2.8%), afaD (1.4%), afaE
(1.4%), K99 (0.9%) and sepA (0.47%), respectively, and the isolates could be
assigned into 25 different virulence factor patterns. In 139 ETT2-negative E.
coli strains, the virulence genes detected were EAST1 (38.9%), paa (14.4%), STb
(11.5%), AIDA-I (10.1%), irp2 (7.9%), sepA (2.16%), LT (0.7%), STa (0.7%), eae
(0.7%), ler (0.7%), hlyA (0.7%) and K88 (0.7%), respectively, and the isolates
could be classified into 13 different virulence factor patterns. Moreover, the
occurrence of LT gene of ETT2-positive E. coli strains was far more than that of 
ETT2-negative E. coli strains.
