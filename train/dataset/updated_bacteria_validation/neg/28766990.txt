This study investigated the pathogenesis of periodontitis and the role of
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 10 (NLRP10). The 
human oral epithelial cell line HOK-16B was infected with two periodontal
pathogens, Tannerella forsythia and Fusobacterium nucleatum, at various MOIs.
RT-PCR and immunoblotting demonstrated that infection increased mRNA and protein 
expression of NLRP10, respectively. The siRNA-mediated NLRP10 knockdown
significantly reduced IL-1α expression and secretion. Both bacteria induced
phosphorylation of ERK, JNK and p38 MAP kinases in HOK-16B cells. NLRP10
knockdown impaired ERK phosphorylation only. ERK inhibition significantly
decreased the expression of T. forsythia- and F. nucleatum-induced IL-1α. Our
data suggest that NLRP10 is involved in activating the ERK signalling pathway in 
HOK-16B cells infected with T. forsythia and F. nucleatum. This pathway likely
augments the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1α levels, which may play a critical
role in periodontitis.
