How living organisms create carbon-sulfur bonds during the biosynthesis of
critical sulfur-containing compounds is still poorly understood. The
methylthiotransferases MiaB and RimO catalyze sulfur insertion into tRNAs and
ribosomal protein S12, respectively. Both belong to a subgroup of
radical-S-adenosylmethionine (radical-SAM) enzymes that bear two [4Fe-4S]
clusters. One cluster binds S-adenosylmethionine and generates an Adoâ€¢ radical
via a well-established mechanism. However, the precise role of the second cluster
is unclear. For some sulfur-inserting radical-SAM enzymes, this cluster has been 
proposed to act as a sacrificial source of sulfur for the reaction. In this
paper, we report parallel enzymological, spectroscopic and crystallographic
investigations of RimO and MiaB, which provide what is to our knowledge the first
evidence that these enzymes are true catalysts and support a new sulfation
mechanism involving activation of an exogenous sulfur cosubstrate at an
exchangeable coordination site on the second cluster, which remains intact during
the reaction.
