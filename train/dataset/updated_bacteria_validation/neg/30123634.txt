Medicinal mushroom Ganoderma sp. is considered to be a key source for the
production of therapeutic agents. Our current review indicates that a limited
number (<19%; 79 out of >430) of isolated compounds have been tested and known to
be active against several microorganisms and parasites. In this review, we aim to
summarise all the antimicrobial and anti-parasitic works on Ganoderma sp.
displayed on web of science, google scholar and endnote X7 from 1932 to August
2016. We further present and discuss the structure of active compounds against
microorganisms and parasites. In addition, we also discuss the possible further
research to identify lead compounds from Ganoderma sp. as a novel strategy to
combat the potential global emergence of bad bugs and parasites.
