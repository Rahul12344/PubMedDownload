Gut microbiota are suspected to affect brain functions and behavior as well as
lowering inflammation status. Therefore, an effect on depression has already been
suggested by recent research. The aim of this randomized double-blind controlled 
trial was to evaluate the effect of probiotic treatment in depressed individuals.
Within inpatient care, 82 currently depressed individuals were randomly assigned 
to either receive a multistrain probiotic plus biotin treatment or biotin plus
placebo for 28 days. Clinical symptoms as well as gut microbiome were analyzed at
the begin of the study, after one and after four weeks. After 16S rRNA analysis, 
microbiome samples were bioinformatically explored using QIIME, SPSS, R and
Piphillin. Both groups improved significantly regarding psychiatric symptoms.
Ruminococcus gauvreauii and Coprococcus 3 were more abundant and β-diversity was 
higher in the probiotics group after 28 days. KEGG-analysis showed elevated
inflammation-regulatory and metabolic pathways in the intervention group. The
elevated abundance of potentially beneficial bacteria after probiotic treatment
allows speculations on the functionality of probiotic treatment in depressed
individuals. Furthermore, the finding of upregulated vitamin B6 and B7 synthesis 
underlines the connection between the quality of diet, gut microbiota and mental 
health through the regulation of metabolic functions, anti-inflammatory and
anti-apoptotic properties. Concluding, four-week probiotic plus biotin
supplementation, in inpatient individuals with a major depressive disorder
diagnosis, showed an overall beneficial effect of clinical treatment. However,
probiotic intervention compared to placebo only differed in microbial diversity
profile, not in clinical outcome measures.
