Pathogenesis of pyelonephritis. Escherichia coli-induced renal ultrastructural
changes.

Fry TL, Fried FA, Goven BA.

Escherichia coli-induced renal ultrastructural changes were observed 4 hr after
the intravenous injection of 2 times 10-minus 6 bacteria. The initial changes
consisted of mitochondrial swelling followed by intracellular vacuolation,
nuclear membrane dilation, and increased lysosomal phagocytic activity.
Alterations in the appearance of proximal tubular lysosomes included a loss of
osmiophilic staining properties. Many of the involved cells showed necrosis and
can presumably act as a nidus for bacterial proliferation.
