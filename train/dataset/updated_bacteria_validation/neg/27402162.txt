RNA ligases function pervasively across the three kingdoms of life for RNA
repair, splicing and can be stress induced. The RtcB protein (also HSPC117,
C22orf28, FAAP and D10Wsu52e) is one such conserved ligase, involved in tRNA and 
mRNA splicing. However, its physiological role is poorly described, especially in
bacteria. We now show in Escherichia coli bacteria that the RtcR activated rtcAB 
genes function for ribosome homeostasis involving rRNA stability. Expression of
rtcAB is activated by agents and genetic lesions which impair the translation
apparatus or may cause oxidative damage in the cell. Rtc helps the cell to
survive challenges to the translation apparatus, including ribosome targeting
antibiotics. Further, loss of Rtc causes profound changes in chemotaxis and
motility. Together, our data suggest that the Rtc system is part of a previously 
unrecognized adaptive response linking ribosome homeostasis with basic cell
physiology and behaviour.
