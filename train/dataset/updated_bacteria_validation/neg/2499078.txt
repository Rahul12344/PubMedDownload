The preparation of an in vitro assay system for the immunosuppressive activities 
of modified nucleosides on macrophage (M phi) functions is described. Briefly,
Listeria-elicited mouse peritoneal M phi s (Lm-M phi s) were treated with
nucleosides in vitro for 18 hr at less than 1 mM concentration and
chemiluminescence (CL) was measured after stimulation with opsonized zymosan. To 
confirm the usefulness of this assay (in vitro test), the immunosuppressive
activities of 1-methyladenosine (m1 Ado) and adenosine (Ado) were determined by
mouse Listeria infection (in vivo test), CL generation by M phi s obtained from
the peritoneal cavity of nucleoside-treated mice (in vivo-in vitro test), and the
in vitro test. The immunosuppressive activity of m1 Ado detected by the in vitro 
test was confirmed by the in vivo and the in vivo-in vitro tests. As for Ado, no 
immunosuppression was detected by the in vivo and the in vivo-in vitro tests
through a potent suppressive effect was detected by the in vitro test. The
ineffectiveness of Ado can be explained by the in vivo conversion of Ado to an
inactive form. Thus, the proposed in vitro test seems to be useful, with the
provision that the known in vivo metabolism is taken into consideration.
