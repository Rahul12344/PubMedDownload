Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is one of the most aggressive non-Hodgkin
lymphomas. It is curable but one-third of cases are refractory to therapy or
relapse after initial response highlighting the urgent need for developing novel 
therapeutic approaches. Targeting sirtuins, particularly SIRT1 by genetic
approaches or using pharmaceutical inhibitor tenovin-6, has shown promising
therapeutic potential in various hematopoietic malignancies. However, it remains 
unknown whether these approaches are effective for DLBCL. In this study, we have 
found that tenovin-6 potently inhibits the proliferation and survival of DLBCL
cells. Surprisingly, specific knockdown of SIRT1/2/3 has no effect on DLBCL.
Mechanistically, tenovin-6 increases the level of microtubule-associated protein 
1 light chain 3B (LC3B)-II in a SIRT1/2/3- and p53-independent manner in DLBCL
cell lines. Tenovin-6-mediated increase of LC3B-II is through inhibition of
classical autophagy pathway. Furthermore, inhibition of the autophagy pathway by 
using other inhibitors or by knocking down key genes in the pathway impairs cell 
proliferation and survival of DLBCL cells. These results indicate that targeting 
the autophagic pathway could be a novel therapeutic strategy for DLBCL and that
precaution should be taken to interpret data where tenovin-6 was used as an
inhibitor of sirtuins.
