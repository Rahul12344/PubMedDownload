Exohemagglutinins: new products of vibrios.

Oishi K, Yokoshima S, Tomiyama T, Aida K.

A number of vibrio strains isolated from marine water produced high units of
phytohemagglutinin-like agglutinins. Sugar specificity of the hemagglutinins was 
different from that of the sugar-binding bacterial toxins and that of the
sugar-binding pili on the bacterial cell surfaces.
