Repertaxin is a new non-competitive allosteric blocker of interleukin-8
(CXCL8/IL-8) receptors (CXCR1/R2), which by locking CXCR1/R2 in an inactive
conformation prevents receptor signaling and human polymorphonuclear leukocyte
(PMN) chemotaxis. Given the unique mode of action of repertaxin it was important 
to examine the ability of repertaxin to inhibit a wide range of biological
activities induced by CXCL8 in human leukocytes. Our results show that repertaxin
potently and selectively blocked PMN adhesion to fibrinogen and CD11b
up-regulation induced by CXCL8. Reduction of CXCL8-mediated PMN adhesion by
repertaxin was paralleled by inhibition of PMN activation including secondary and
tertiary granule release and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, whereas PMN
phagocytosis of Escherichia coli bacteria was unaffected. Repertaxin also
selectively blocked CXCL8-induced T lymphocyte and natural killer (NK) cell
migration. These data suggest that repertaxin is a potent and specific inhibitor 
of a wide range of CXCL8-mediated activities related to leukocyte recruitment and
functional activation in inflammatory sites.
