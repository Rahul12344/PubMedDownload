The specificities of the plant environment and its effects on fungal growth are
not yet fully explored. Both pH and Eh play a key role during this interaction,
but are often studied independently or at different scales. We aimed at
investigating whether the methods developed for the joint characterization of the
pH and Eh in soil could be transposed to fungi. On artificial media, the growth
of all 16 species tested significantly altered either Eh, pH or both. Measuring
Eh reveals that even the species not modifying pH can have an impact on the
surrounding environment. Reciprocally, fungi responded to pH and Eh parameters,
both quantitatively with a decrease in colony diameter and qualitatively with
colony aspect repeatedly and thoroughly modified. In infected oilseed rape plant 
stems, pH and Eh were significantly altered. The observed alcalinisation or
acidification correlates with canker length. The joint characterization of both
parameters will allow understanding the impact of fungi on their environment, and
conversely of the environment on fungal growth. The availability of methods for
measurement opens the prospect to study combinations of stresses, and get an
understanding of the involvement of pH and Eh modifications in these
interactions.
