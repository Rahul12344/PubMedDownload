Genital C. trachomatis infections typically last for many months in women. This
has been attributed to several strategies by which C. trachomatis evades immune
detection, including well-described methods by which C. trachomatis decreases the
cell surface expression of the antigen presenting molecules major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, MHC class II, and CD1d in infected
genital epithelial cells. We have harnessed new methods that allow for separate
evaluation of infected and uninfected cells within a mixed population of
chlamydia-infected endocervical epithelial cells to demonstrate that MHC class I 
downregulation in the presence of C. trachomatis is mediated by direct and
indirect (soluble) factors. Such indirect mechanisms may aid in priming
surrounding cells for more rapid immune evasion upon pathogen entry and help
promote unfettered spread of C. trachomatis genital infections.
