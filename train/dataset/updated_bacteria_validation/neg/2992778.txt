A variant F9 embryonal carcinoma cell line which undergoes incomplete
differentiation in retinoic acid.

Moore EE, Moritz EA, Mitra NS.

F9 embryonal carcinoma cells treated with 1 microM retinoic acid undergo
irreversible differentiation and simultaneously lose their tumorigenicity.
Described here are the isolation and characterization of an F9 variant clone
(5C), which undergoes partial differentiation in retinoic acid. The behavior of
5C cells indicates that retinoic acid successfully initiates the differentiation 
pathway but that complete differentiation is not achieved due to a subsequent
block in the pathway. The fact that 5C cells do not undergo complete
differentiation, or lose their tumorigenicity in response to retinoic acid,
indicates that the lesion affects an element involved in the regulation of both
these events. Therefore, further genetic and biochemical characterization of this
variant should provide information concerning the relationship between the
regulation of differentiation and tumorigenicity. Furthermore, the isolation of
this variant establishes the feasibility of genetically dissecting the various
steps of the differentiation pathway.
