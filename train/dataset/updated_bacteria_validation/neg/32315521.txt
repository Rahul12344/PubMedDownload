We show that arsenate can be readily reduced to arsenite on cell surfaces of
common bacteria (E. coli or B. subtilis) or in aqueous dissolved extracellular
polymeric substances (EPS)Â extracted from different microorganisms (E. coli, B.
subtilis, P. chrysosporium, D. gigas, and a natural biofilm) in the absence of
exogenous electron donors. The efficiency of arsenate reduction by E. coli after 
a 7-h incubation was only moderately reduced from 51.3% to 32.7% after knocking
out the arsenic resistance genes (arsB and arsC). Most (>97%) of the reduced
arsenite was present outside the bacterial cells, including for the E. coli
blocked mutant lacking arsB and arsC. Thus, extracellular processes dominated
arsenate reduction. Arsenate reduction was facilitated by removing EPS attached
to E. coli or B. subtilis, which was attributed to enhanced access to reduced
extracellular cytochromes. This highlights the role of EPS as a permeability
barrier to arsenate reduction. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) combined with
other chemical analyses implicated some low-molecular weight (<3 kDa) molecules
as electron donors (reducing saccharides) and electron transfer mediators
(quinones) in arsenate reduction by dissolved EPS alone. These results indicate
that EPS act as both reducing agent and permeability barrier for access to
reduced biomolecules in bacterial reduction of arsenate.
