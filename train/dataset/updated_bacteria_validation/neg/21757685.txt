RtcB enzymes are novel RNA ligases that join 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and 5'-OH
ends. The phylogenetic distribution of RtcB points to its candidacy as a tRNA
splicing/repair enzyme. Here we show that Escherichia coli RtcB is competent and 
sufficient for tRNA splicing in vivo by virtue of its ability to complement
growth of yeast cells that lack the endogenous "healing/sealing-type" tRNA ligase
Trl1. RtcB also protects yeast trl1Î” cells against a fungal ribotoxin that
incises the anticodon loop of cellular tRNAs. Moreover, RtcB can replace Trl1 as 
the catalyst of HAC1 mRNA splicing during the unfolded protein response. Thus,
RtcB is a bona fide RNA repair enzyme with broad physiological actions.
Biochemical analysis of RtcB highlights the uniqueness of its active site and
catalytic mechanism. Our findings draw attention to tRNA ligase as a promising
drug target.
