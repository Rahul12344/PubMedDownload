Various properties of semiconductor nanoparticles, including photoluminescence
and catalytic activity, make these materials attractive for a range of
applications. As nanoparticles readily coagulate and so lose their size-dependent
properties, shape-persistent three-dimensional stabilizers that enfold
nanoparticles have been exploited. However, such wrapping approaches also make
the nanoparticles insensitive to external stimuli, and so may limit their
application. The chaperonin proteins GroEL (from Escherichia coli) and T.th
('T.th cpn', from Thermus thermophilus HB8) encapsulate denatured proteins inside
a cylindrical cavity; after refolding, the encapsulated proteins are released by 
the action of ATP inducing a conformational change of the cavity. Here we report 
that GroEL and T.th cpn can also enfold CdS semiconductor nanoparticles, giving
them high thermal and chemical stability in aqueous media. Analogous to the
biological function of the chaperonins, the nanoparticles can be readily released
from the protein cavities by the action of ATP. We expect that integration of
such biological mechanisms into materials science will open a door to
conceptually new bioresponsive devices.
