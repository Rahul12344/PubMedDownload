Evasion of the host phagocyte response by Staphylococcus aureus is crucial to
successful infection with the pathogen. γ-haemolysin AB and CB (HlgAB, HlgCB) are
bicomponent pore-forming toxins present in almost all human S. aureus isolates.
Cellular tropism and contribution of the toxins to S. aureus pathophysiology are 
poorly understood. Here we identify the chemokine receptors CXCR1, CXCR2 and CCR2
as targets for HlgAB, and the complement receptors C5aR and C5L2 as targets for
HlgCB. The receptor expression patterns allow the toxins to efficiently and
differentially target phagocytic cells. Murine neutrophils are resistant to HlgAB
and HlgCB. CCR2 is the sole murine receptor orthologue compatible with
γ-haemolysin. In a murine peritonitis model, HlgAB contributes to S. aureus
bacteremia in a CCR2-dependent manner. HlgAB-mediated targeting of CCR2(+) cells 
highlights the involvement of inflammatory macrophages during S. aureus
infection. Functional quantification identifies HlgAB and HlgCB as major secreted
staphylococcal leukocidins.
