Peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer of the antrum and body have been
declining in the 20th century. In contrast, a new group of diseases are
increasingly rapidly in Western countries: gastroesophageal reflux disease,
Barrett's esophagus, and adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus. Recent studies
suggest this phenomenon may be related to the simultaneous fall in the prevalence
of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) colonization, especially by the virulent cagA 
+ strains. H. pylori infection with the cagA+ strain is potentially protective
against the spectrum of gastroesophageal reflux disease because it lowers
intragastric acidity as the result of a pangastritis, frequently with multifocal 
gastric atrophy and possibly increased intragastric ammonia production. Assuming 
that some types of H. pylori strains are protective, our entire approach to the
worldwide elimination of this organism, sometimes indiscriminately, will need
critical reevaluation.
