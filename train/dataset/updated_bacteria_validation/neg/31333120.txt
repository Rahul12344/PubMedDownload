BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Pseudomonas aeruginosa shows resistance to a large number
of antibiotics, including carbapenems and third generation cephalosporin.
According to the World Health Organization global report published in February
2017, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is on the priority list among resistant bacteria,
for which new antibiotics are urgently needed. Peptidoglycan serves as a good
target for the discovery of novel antimicrobial drugs.
METHODS: Biosynthesis of peptidoglycan is a multi-step process involving four mur
enzymes. Among these enzymes, UDP-N-acetylmuramate-L-alanine ligase (MurC) is
considered to be an excellent target for the design of new classes of
antimicrobial inhibitors in gram-negative bacteria.
RESULTS: In this study, a homology model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa MurC ligase
was generated and used for virtual screening of chemical compounds from the ZINC 
Database. The best screened inhibitor i.e. N,
N-dimethyl-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-1,3-benzodiazole-5-sulfonamide was then validated
experimentally through inhibition assay.
CONCLUSION: The presented results based on combined computational and in vitro
analysis open up new horizons for the development of novel antimicrobials against
this pathogen.
