Newborn mouse glomeruli are still immature with a morphological feature of an
early capillary loop stage, but infant mice do not manifest proteinuria. Little
is known about the molecular mechanism whereby infant mice are resistant to
proteinuria. Nephrin and synaptopodin are crucial for slit diaphragm and foot
process (FP) formation for avoiding proteinuria. Nephrin tyrosine phosphorylation
means a transient biological signaling required for FP repair or extension during
nephrotic disease. Using an immunohistochemical technique, we examined the
natural course of nephrin, Wilms' tumor-1 (WT1) and synaptopodin at 16.5 days of 
embryonic age (E16.5d) and E19.5d, 7 days of post-neonatal age (P7d) and P42d
during renal development of mice. As a result, nephrin and synaptopodin were
detected at E19.5d in S-shaped bodies. WT1, a transcriptional factor for nephrin,
was detected in nucleus in podocyte-like cells in all stages. Nephrin tyrosine
phosphorylation was evident in glomeruli at P7d, and this was associated with an 
early-stage of FP extension. Inversely, nephrin phosphorylation became faint at
P42d, along with maturated FP. Based on the present results, we suggest the
sequential molecular mechanism to protect growing mice from proteinuria: (i)
WT1-induced nephrin production by podocytes in S-shaped bodies at E19.5d; (ii)
Synchronized induction of synaptopodin at the same period; and (iii) FP extension
is initiated at a milk-suckling stage under a nephrin tyrosine-phosphorylated
condition, while it is arrested at an adult stage, associated with a loss of
nephrin-based signaling.
