PURPOSE: Aberrant DNA methylation could regulate the expression of tumor
suppressor gene DLEC1 and oncogene PBX3 and was related to the occurrence and
prognosis of gastric cancer (GC). In this study, the associations between DLEC1
and PBX3 promoter methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) and the risk 
and prognosis of GC were investigated.
METHODS: The methylation status of DLEC1 and PBX3 promoter in PBLs of 368 GC
cases and 382 controls was detected by the methylation-sensitive high-resolution 
melting (MS-HRM) method. Logistic and Cox regression were adopted to analyze the 
associations of DLEC1 and PBX3 methylation with GC risk and prognosis,
respectively. Confounding biases were controlled by propensity score (PS).
RESULTS: Compared with negative methylation (Nm), DLEC1-positive methylation (Pm)
was associated with increased GC risk in PS (OR 2.083, 95% CI 1.220-3.558,
P = 0.007), but PBX3 Pm was not associated with GC risk. In the elderly group
(≥ 60 years), DLEC1 Pm was associated with increased GC risk (OR 2.951, 95% CI
1.426-6.104, P = 0.004). The combined effects between DLEC1 methylation and
consumption of dairy products, fried food intake and Helicobacter pylori (H.
pylori) infection on GC risk were discovered (ORc 3.461, 95% CI 1.847-6.486,
P < 0.001, ORc 3.246, 95% CI 1.708-6.170, P < 0.001 and ORc 2.964, 95% CI
1.690-5.197, P < 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, DLEC1 and PBX3 methylation
were not associated with GC prognosis.
CONCLUSION: DLEC1 methylation in PBLs and the combined effects of
gene-environment can influence GC risk.
