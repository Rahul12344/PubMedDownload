Between 1982 and 1989 59 equine fetuses were investigated for chlamydiae using
animal experiments and embryonated eggs. Chlamydiae were isolated from 16 fetuses
(27.1%) originating from 8 studs. The macroscopical lesions of the fetal organs
were characterized by extensive haemorrhages. The histological picture shows
severe lesions of the blood vessels of different organs. In 6 studs in which
chlamydiae had been isolated, blood sera of clinically healthy and pregnant mares
were investigated for antibodies during 1989 and 1990. Antibody titres between
1:10++ and 1:40 were detected by using complement fixation test in sera of mares 
of 4 studs.
