Twenty-nine farmers with a flock prevalence of lameness >5% were visited in 2013.
They participated in a facilitated discussion on treatment of footrot, and
evidence-based new "best practice." One year later, farmers were revisited and
management and motivators for change were discussed. Farmers were asked how they 
would persuade other farmers to adopt "best practice." Initially, most
participants were resigned to having lame sheep. They believed that prototypical 
"good farmers" (including trusted family) practiced foot trimming, the
traditional "best practice" and that the new "best practice" would be expensive
and time consuming. Between 2013 and 2014 lameness prevalence reduced from 7.6 to
4.3%. The major behavioral changes were reduction in foot trimming, increased use
of antibacterials to treat footrot, and treating sheep within a week of becoming 
lame. In 2014, participants were re-interviewed. They reported that an increased 
knowledge of the evidence-base, trust in the facilitator and talking to other
trusted farmers who had already adopted the new "best practice" overcame concerns
about the prototypical "good farmer" and motivated change. Persistent change
occurred because participants observed health benefits for their sheep and that
the new "best practice" had saved time and money. Participants stated that other 
farmers would be convinced to change to the new "best practice" because it saved 
time and money, ironically, these were among the original barriers to change.
This is possibly an example of cognitive dissonance because farmers had become
positive about the benefits of saving time and money following a change in their 
own behaviors.
