BACKGROUND: Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus is an important
causative agent of infectious endocarditis, while the pathogenicity of this
species is widely unclear. To gain insight into the pathomechanisms and the
underlying genetic elements for lateral gene transfer, we sequenced the entire
genome of this pathogen.
RESULTS: We sequenced the whole genome of S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus
strain ATCC BAA-2069, consisting of a 2,356,444 bp circular DNA molecule with a
G+C-content of 37.65% and a novel 20,765 bp plasmid designated as pSGG1.
Bioinformatic analysis predicted 2,309 ORFs and the presence of 80 tRNAs and 21
rRNAs in the chromosome. Furthermore, 21 ORFs were detected on the plasmid pSGG1,
including tetracycline resistance genes telL and tet(O/W/32/O). Screening of 41
S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus isolates revealed one plasmid (pSGG2)
homologous to pSGG1. We further predicted 21 surface proteins containing the cell
wall-sorting motif LPxTG, which were shown to play a functional role in the
adhesion of bacteria to host cells. In addition, we performed a whole genome
comparison to the recently sequenced S. gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus strain
UCN34, revealing significant differences.
CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of the whole genome sequence of S. gallolyticus subsp. 
gallolyticus promotes understanding of genetic factors concerning the
pathogenesis and adhesion to ECM of this pathogen. For the first time we detected
the presence of the mobilizable pSGG1 plasmid, which may play a functional role
in lateral gene transfer and promote a selective advantage due to a tetracycline 
resistance.
