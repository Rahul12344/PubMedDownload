The dynamics of the densities of epidermal thionin-positive cells (putative mast 
cells) in the skin of brown trout fry were investigated during experimental
infections with the skin parasites Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (Ciliophora) and 
Gyrodactylus derjavini (Monogenea). It was shown that the metachromatic
thionin-stained cells were extremely sensitive to parasite exposure, as the
density of cells in the skin of trout decreased markedly after exposure to the
pathogens. As early as 7 d post infection the cell counts were significantly
reduced and almost totally depleted following 9 d infection, which suggests that 
degranulation of the cells occurs following parasite exposure. No recruitment of 
new cells was seen during the study period. Some reduction in uninfected control 
groups indicates that the putative mast cells are sensitive to stress as well. A 
notable variation in densities of thionin-stained cells between different fins
was found and the corneal surface was devoid of these cells. The possible
implications of these cells in host-parasite interactions are suggested and
discussed.
