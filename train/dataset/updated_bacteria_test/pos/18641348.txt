Type I IFNs (IFNIs) have pleiotropic functions in regulating host innate and
adaptive immune responses to pathogens. To elucidate the role of IFNIs in host
resistance to chlamydial infection in vivo, we compared IFN-alpha/beta receptor
knockout (IFNAR(-/-)) and wild-type control mice in susceptibility to Chlamydia
trachomatis mouse pneumonitis (Chlamydia muridarum) lung infection. We found that
the IFNAR(-/-) mice were significantly more resistant to C. muridarum infection
showing less bacterial burden and bodyweight loss, and milder pathological
changes. However, IFN-gamma response, which is believed to be critical in host
defense against chlamydial infection, was similar between the wild-type and
IFNAR(-/-) mice. More importantly, TUNEL analysis showed less macrophage
apoptosis in IFNAR(-/-) mice, which was consistent with lower expressions of
IFNI-induced apoptotic factors, TRAIL, Daxx, and PKR. Furthermore, depletion of
lung macrophages with dichloromethylene diphosphonate-liposome significantly
increased the susceptibility of the IFNAR(-/-) mice to C. muridarum, confirming
the importance of macrophages. Overall, the data indicate that IFNIs play a
promoting role in C. muridarum lung infection, largely through increase of local 
macrophage apoptosis.
