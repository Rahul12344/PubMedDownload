The 16S ribosomal RNA sequences of Legionella pneumophila, L. erythra, L.
hackeliae, L. spiritensis, L. longbeachae, L. bozemanii (Fluoribacter bozemanae) 
and L. micdadei (Tatlockia micdadei) were determined using reverse transcriptase.
The sequences were compared with published sequences for Gram-negative bacteria
and phylogenetic trees were constructed. The data confirm previous work which
showed that the family Legionellaceae forms a monophyletic subgroup within the
gamma subdivision of the Proteobacteria. The data show that all of the
legionellae studied are highly related (greater than 95%) on the basis of 16S
rRNA sequences and do not support the division of the family Legionellaceae into 
three genera.
