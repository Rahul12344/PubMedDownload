Infection with Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette Gu√©rin (BCG) induces high
levels of apoptosis among activated CD4+ T cells. We have investigated the
specificity of this pro-apoptotic response and its influence on CD4+ T cell
mediated autoimmunity. Apoptosis induced by BCG-infection is unrelated to
antigenic specificity, as demonstrated by the increased apoptosis of activated
TCR transgenic CD4+ T cells of unrelated specificity. Moreover, infection-induced
apoptosis promoted the deletion of CD4+ T cells activated either by peptide or
anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation. Infection-induced apoptosis required IFN-gamma
production by the infected host, and expression of the IFN-gamma receptor on
donor CD4+ T cells. We used an adoptive transfer model of experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) to assess the influence of infection-induced apoptosis on
a CD4+ T cell-mediated response. A significantly higher level of apoptosis was
seen among sorted encephalitogenic CD4+ T cells transferred to BCG-infected
versus uninfected hosts. BCG-infected mice displayed a milder course of clinical 
disease than their uninfected counterparts and a decreased recovery of donor
cells from the CNS. The data suggest that mycobacterial infection attenuates the 
severity of EAE, at least in part, by promoting the apoptotic elimination of
autoreactive CD4+ T cells.
