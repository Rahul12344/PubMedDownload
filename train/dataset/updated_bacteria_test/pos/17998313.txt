Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) plays a critical role in the early eradication of
Anaplasma phagocytophilum. However, the mechanisms that regulate IFN-gamma
production upon infection remain poorly understood. Here we show that c-Jun
NH2-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) inhibits IFN-gamma production during A.
phagocytophilum infection. jnk2-null mice were more refractory to infection with 
A. phagocytophilum and produced increased levels of IFN-gamma after challenge
with the pathogen. The resistance of jnk2-null mice to A. phagocytophilum
infection was due to elevated levels of IFN-gamma secreted by conventional and
natural killer (NK) T cells. The administration of alpha-galactosylceramide, a
strong NK T-cell agonist, increased IFN-gamma release and protected mice from A. 
phagocytophilum, further demonstrating the inhibitory effect of JNK2 on IFN-gamma
production. Collectively, these findings provide strong evidence that JNK2 is an 
important regulatory protein for IFN-gamma secretion upon challenge with A.
phagocytophilum.
