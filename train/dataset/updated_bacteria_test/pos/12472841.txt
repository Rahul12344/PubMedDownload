Porphyromonas gingivalis has been shown to attack host defense systems through
proteolytic cleavage of a wide variety of members of the systems. In this study, 
we examined the ability of P. gingivalis culture supernatant to alter the
expression of human T cell surface proteins. As judged by flow cytometric
analysis, detection of CD4 expression was completely eliminated by the
supernatant, but CD8 was less sensitive. When the culture supernatant was added
with reducing agents, proteolytic activity was enhanced, resulting in the
cleavage of CD8. Mitogenic response of T cells to phytohemagglutinin or
concanavalin A was decreased by the treatment of the cells with the culture
supernatant of P. gingivalis. The three forms of gingipains (high molecular mass 
arginine-specific gingipain, arginine-specific gingipain 2 and lysine-specific
gingipain) purified from the culture supernatant of P. gingivalis actively
cleaved CD4 and CD8 on human T cells, indicating that proteolytic activity of the
culture supernatant was due to gingipains. These results suggest that cysteine
proteinases like gingipains released from P. gingivalis cleave T cell surface
proteins and impede T cell function.
