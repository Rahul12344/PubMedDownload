Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) is a major health
care threat worldwide causing over a million deaths annually. Host-pathogen
interaction is complex, and a strong genetic contribution to disease
susceptibility has been proposed. We have investigated single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) within cGAS/STING in Indian TB patients and healthy cohorts 
from India and Germany by Lightcycler®480 genotyping technique. The cGAS/STING
pathway is an essential defense pathway within the cytosol after M.tb is
internalized and mycobacterial DNA is released inducing the production of type I 
IFNs. We found that the rs311686 SNP upstream of cGAS provides protection from
getting TB overall and is differently distributed in pulmonary TB patients
compared with extra-pulmonary and particularly relapse cases. This SNP
furthermore differs in distribution when comparing individuals with respect to
BCG vaccination status. Taken together, our results show that the presence of the
rs311686 SNP influences the course of TB significantly. However, structural
conformation changes were found only for the cGAS rs610913 SNP. These findings
underscore the importance of M.tb DNA recognition for TB pathogenesis and may
eventually help in risk stratification of individuals. This may ultimately help
in prevention of disease and aid in developing new vaccination and treatment
strategies.
