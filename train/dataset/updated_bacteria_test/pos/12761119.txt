The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is known to activate multiple
proinflammatory signaling pathways in epithelial cells. In this study, we
addressed the question of whether expression of the interleukin-8 receptors
IL-8RA (CXCR1) and IL-8RB (CXCR2) is upregulated in H. pylori-infected human
gastric biopsy samples. Biopsy samples from patients infected with H. pylori
strains harboring the cag pathogenicity island (PAI) expressed larger amounts of 
both receptors. In addition, IL-8RB expression was induced in the gastric
epithelial cell line AGS upon infection with a clinical isolate containing the
cag PAI, while a strain lacking the cag PAI did not. Our finding suggests that
gastric epithelial cells express IL-8R in response to H. pylori infection.
