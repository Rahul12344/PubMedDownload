We retrospectively reviewed 70 cases of perforated appendicitis in children to
examine the relationship between postoperative antibiotic selection and culture
results from the peritoneal cavity. Initial antibiotic therapy chosen for the
children consisted of a three-drug combination in 54 (77%) patients. Peritoneal
cultures were performed in 58 (83%) patients. Escherichia coli and Bacteriodes
fragilis were the most common bacterial isolates from the peritoneal culture.
Only 7 (10%) patients had their antibiotic regimen changed after the culture
results were available, of which 2 changes brought drug therapy into compliance
with the cultures and 5 changes were inappropriate with respect to the peritoneal
cultures. Of the remaining 51 patients with culture data available, 39 should
have had changes to bring the antibiotic therapy into compliance with the
observed culture results. These data indicate that surgeons select antibiotic
therapy for perforated appendicitis in children based on assumptions of which
organisms should be present in the infection and not on culture data. There
appears to be no clinical usefulness to the routine culturing of the peritoneal
cavity in children with perforated appendicitis.
