The agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) is an obligate intracellular
bacterium with a tropism for neutrophils; however, the mechanisms of bacterial
dissemination are not yet understood. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a chemokine that
induces neutrophil migration to sites of infection for host defense against
pathogens. We now show that HGE bacteria, and the HGE-44 protein, induce IL-8
secretion in a promyelocytic (HL-60) cell line that has been differentiated along
the neutrophil lineage with retinoic acid and in neutrophils. Infected HL-60
cells also demonstrate upregulation of CXCR2, an IL-8 receptor, but not CXCR1.
Human neutrophils migrate towards Ehrlichia sp.-infected cells in a chemotaxis
chamber assay, and this movement can be blocked with antibodies to IL-8. Finally,
immunocompetent and severe combined immunodeficient mice administered CXCR2
antisera, and CXCR2(-/-) mice that lack the human IL-8 receptor homologue, are
much less susceptible to granulocytic ehrlichiosis than are control animals.
These results demonstrate that HGE bacteria induce IL-8 production by host cells 
and, paradoxically, appear to exploit this chemokine to enhance infection.
