Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a threat to public health. This pathogen caused an
epidemic in Hong Kong during the years 2015-2018. The reproduction number during 
the initial epidemic was estimated to be 1.7 for macrolide-resistant M.
pneumoniae (MRMP) and 1.4 for macrolide-sensitive M. pneumoniae (MSMP). During
2016-2018, the reproduction number remained stable at around 1.0 for both MRMP
and MSMP. Phase-shifting and changes in the leading-status between the
transmissibilities of MSMP and MRMP were found.
