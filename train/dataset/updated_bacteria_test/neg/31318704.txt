Intra-oral halitosis (IOH) refers to an unpleasant odor from the oral cavity that
is mainly caused by the tongue coating. Although the tongue coating microbiome is
thought to play an essential role in IOH, the exact aetiology of IOH remains
unclear. Here we investigated and compared the metabolic profiles of the tongue
coating microbiomes of patients with IOH versus healthy control. The metabolic
profiles were significantly different in IOH patients than in healthy controls.
Healthy controls showed higher selenoamino acid and nicotinamide metabolism;
these metabolic pathways are mainly involved in maintaining the
oxidation-reduction potential and redox state. A total of 39 putative metabolites
were associated with IOH. Remarkably, 3 of the metabolites, branched-chain fatty 
acids (BCFA), 3-fumaryl pyruvate, and acetyl phosphate, are potential key players
in IOH. Interestingly, the predominant metabolite in IOH is BCFAs, which might
underlie tongue coat formation. In addition, the key metabolite acetyl phosphate 
has a clear association with the hydrogen sulfide- (H2S-) producing metabolic
pathway and anaerobic fermentation. These novel metabolomic findings provide
insights into the formation of the tongue coating and the production of H2S,
which causes bad breath.
