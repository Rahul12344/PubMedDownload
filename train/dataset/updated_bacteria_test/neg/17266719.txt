Cytotoxin fractions were isolated from Campylobacter jejuni 81116 and
semi-purified by size-exclusion liquid chromatography. The fraction showing the
strongest toxicity was injected into mice to produce antiserum. The antiserum was
used to screen a C. jejuni 81116 cosmid library. Nine genes were identified in
overlapping cosmid inserts that induced reactivity with the antiserum. One of
these genes showed high similarity to a periplasmic protein of unknown function
and its isogenic mutant showed decreased toxicity compared to the C. jejuni 81116
wild type. This gene contains a Gram-negative bacterial RTX toxin-activating
protein C signature, which suggests it may play a role in C. jejuni 81116
cytotoxin activation.
