CONCLUSIONS: Some primary laryngeal pathologies with specific clinical
presentation may be related to silent laryngeal reflux. An ex adjuvantibus proton
pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment may be helpful for showing evidence of such a
hidden laryngeal disorder.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the validity of PPI as an ex adjuvantibus criterion for
diagnosis and treatment of suspected reflux-associated laryngitis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty patients with clinical suspicion of
laryngo-pharyngeal reflux (LPR) were identified on the grounds of laryngeal
symptoms (dysphonia, cough, globus sensation, increased throat clearing, bad
taste, and laryngeal spasm), laryngeal features (arytenoid edema/erythema,
partial or total vocal fold erythema, and posterior glottic edema) with or
without gastro-esophageal reflux disorder (GERD). They were consequently
subdivided in three groups: type I, with LPR symptoms and features without GERD; 
type II with LPR symptoms and features with GERD; and type III with LPR features 
only. Types I and III were randomly treated with omeprazole (group A) or with
immunostimulating vaccine (group B) for 3 months. Pre- and post-treatment
laryngeal features and symptoms in all groups were evaluated by
laryngo-stroboscopy and analyzed for statistical correlation.
RESULTS: All omeprazole-treated patients showed improvement of laryngeal features
and symptoms. With PPI treatment, a more significant improvement was noticed with
respect to nonspecific immunostimulant therapy. Also, patients without LPR
symptoms showed improvement of laryngeal features.
