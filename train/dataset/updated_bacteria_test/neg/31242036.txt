Objective- Pathological neovascularization is crucial for progression and
morbidity of serious diseases such as cancer, diabetic retinopathy, and
age-related macular degeneration. While mechanisms of ongoing pathological
neovascularization have been extensively studied, the initiating pathological
vascular remodeling (PVR) events, which precede neovascularization remains poorly
understood. Here, we identify novel molecular and cellular mechanisms of
preneovascular PVR, by using the adult choriocapillaris as a model. Approach and 
Results- Using hypoxia or forced overexpression of VEGF (vascular endothelial
growth factor) in the subretinal space to induce PVR in zebrafish and rats
respectively, and by analyzing choriocapillaris membranes adjacent to choroidal
neovascular lesions from age-related macular degeneration patients, we show that 
the choriocapillaris undergo robust induction of vascular intussusception and
permeability at preneovascular stages of PVR. This PVR response included
endothelial cell proliferation, formation of endothelial luminal processes,
extensive vesiculation and thickening of the endothelium, degradation of collagen
fibers, and splitting of existing extravascular columns. RNA-sequencing
established a role for endothelial tight junction disruption, cytoskeletal
remodeling, vesicle- and cilium biogenesis in this process. Mechanistically,
using genetic gain- and loss-of-function zebrafish models and analysis of primary
human choriocapillaris endothelial cells, we determined that HIF (hypoxia-induced
factor)-1α-VEGF-A-VEGFR2 signaling was important for hypoxia-induced PVR.
Conclusions- Our findings reveal that PVR involving intussusception and splitting
of extravascular columns, endothelial proliferation, vesiculation, fenestration, 
and thickening is induced before neovascularization, suggesting that identifying 
and targeting these processes may prevent development of advanced neovascular
disease in the future. Visual Overview- An online visual overview is available
