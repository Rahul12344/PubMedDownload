BACKGROUND: The apicomplexan parasite Theileria parva causes a livestock disease 
called East coast fever (ECF), with millions of animals at risk in sub-Saharan
East and Southern Africa, the geographic distribution of T. parva. Over a million
bovines die each year of ECF, with a tremendous economic burden to pastoralists
in endemic countries. Comprehensive, accurate parasite genome annotation can
facilitate the discovery of novel chemotherapeutic targets for disease treatment,
as well as elucidate the biology of the parasite. However, genome annotation
remains a significant challenge because of limitations in the quality and
quantity of the data being used to inform the location and function of
protein-coding genes and, when RNA data are used, the underlying biological
complexity of the processes involved in gene expression. Here, we apply our
recently published RNAseq dataset derived from the schizont life-cycle stage of
T. parva to update structural and functional gene annotations across the entire
nuclear genome.
RESULTS: The re-annotation effort lead to evidence-supported updates in over half
of all protein-coding sequence (CDS) predictions, including exon changes, gene
merges and gene splitting, an increase in average CDS length of approximately 50 
base pairs, and the identification of 128 new genes. Among the new genes
identified were those involved in N-glycosylation, a process previously thought
not to exist in this organism and a potentially new chemotherapeutic target
pathway for treating ECF. Alternatively-spliced genes were identified, and
antisense and multi-gene family transcription were extensively characterized.
CONCLUSIONS: The process of re-annotation led to novel insights into the
organization and expression profiles of protein-coding sequences in this
parasite, and uncovered a minimal N-glycosylation pathway that changes our
current understanding of the evolution of this post-translational modification in
apicomplexan parasites.
