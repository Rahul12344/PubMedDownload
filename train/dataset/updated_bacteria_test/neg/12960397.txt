CD1d-restricted natural killer T (NKT) cells are a subset of regulatory T cells
that react with glycolipid antigens. Although preclinical studies have
effectively targeted NKT cells for immunotherapy, little is known regarding the
early in vivo response of these cells to antigenic stimulation. We have analyzed 
the early response of NKT cells to glycolipid antigens and bacterial infection by
using specific reagents for tracking these cells. Our results demonstrate
dramatic in vivo expansion and surface phenotype alterations after NKT cell
activation with alpha-galactosylceramide. In addition, we show significant NK1.1 
down-modulation on NKT cells in the setting of oral Salmonella infection. Our
results indicate that in vivo activation of NKT cells leads to a dynamic response
characterized by surface receptor down-modulation and expansion. These findings
alter current understanding of NKT cell biology and should aid in the rational
design of NKT cell-based immunotherapies.
