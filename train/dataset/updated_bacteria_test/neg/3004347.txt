The role of respiration during adaptation of the freshwater cyanobacterium
Synechococcus 6311 to salinity.

Fry IV, Huflejt M, Erber WW, Peschek GA, Packer L.

Growth of the freshwater cyanobacterium Synechococcus 6311 under saline
conditions stimulated respiration tenfold during the first 24 h, while growth and
photosynthesis were inhibited. The elevated respiration rate was seen under both 
light and dark conditions, was uncoupler and cyanide sensitive, and did not
decrease upon salt removal. Membrane preparations from salt-grown cells exhibited
a tenfold increase in cytochrome oxidase activity, while electron transfer rates 
from NADPH to cytochrome c only increased threefold. Cytochrome oxidase
activities were correlated with levels of EPR detectable Cu2+ in the salt and
control membranes. Sodium-driven proton (antiproter) gradients in salt-grown
cells were sensitive to cyanide but not dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, indicating the 
direct role of respiratory electron transport in maintaining low intracellular
sodium levels.
