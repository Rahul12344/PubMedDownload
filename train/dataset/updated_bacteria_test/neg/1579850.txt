The case of a sixty-two year old man with Campylobacter fetus spondylodiscitis is
reported. Despite of adequate antibiotherapy, the outcome was bad and death
occurred. Three other cases of Campylobacter fetus spondylodiscitis are reported 
in the literature. Tomodensitometry disclosed a paravertebral abscess with gas,
that make our observation original.
