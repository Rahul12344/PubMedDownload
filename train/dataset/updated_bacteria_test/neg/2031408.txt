Campylobacter was found only in raw sewage sludge samples of the high-rate
municipal sewage treatment plant studied. Campylobacters were isolated from 28.6%
of the sewage sludge samples of grit tank and primary settling tank. 40% of the
settled activated sludge samples contained Campylobacter. Campylobacter was never
found in digested sludge of a mean sludge age of more than 90 days. The survival 
times of Campylobacter in sewage sludge samples ranged between some hours and 10 
days. Therefore a low risk of the spread of Campylobacter in the environment due 
to agricultural application of digested sewage sludge is assumed.
