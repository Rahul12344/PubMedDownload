BACKGROUND: During weeks 32-33, 2013, 24 cases of cryptosporidiosis were notified
in the city of Halle (annual mean 2008-2012: 9 cases). We investigated the
outbreak to identify the source and recommend control measures, considering that 
between weeks 23-25 the river Saale which flows through the city centre
overflowed the floodplain, parts of the city centre and damaged sewage systems.
METHODS: We defined a case as a resident of Halle with gastroenteritis,
Cryptosporidium-positive stool and disease onset weeks 27 through 47. In a
case-control study among kindergarten children, we compared cases and controls
regarding environmental exposure, use of swimming pools, zoo visits and tap water
consumption 14 days pre-onset or a corresponding 14-days-period (controls) and
adjusted for residence. Stool specimens were tested by microscopy and PCR, and
Cryptosporidium DNA was sequenced. Samples from public water system, swimming
pools and river Saale were examined for Cryptosporidium oocysts (microscopy and
PCR).
RESULTS: Overall, 167 cases were detected, 40/167 (24%) were classified as
secondary cases. First disease onsets occurred during week 29, numbers peaked in 
week 34 and started to decrease in week 36. Median age was 8 years (range: 0-77).
Compared to controls (n = 61), cases (n = 20) were more likely to report visits
to previously flooded areas (OR: 4.9; 95%-CI: 1.4-18) and the zoo (OR: 2.6;
95%-CI: 0.9-7.6). In multivariable analysis visits to the floodplain remained the
sole risk factor (OR: 5.5; 95%-CI: 1.4-22). Only C.hominis of a single genotype
(IbA9G2) was detected in stools. Oocysts were detected in samples from the river,
two local lakes and three public swimming pools by microscopy, but not in the
public water supply.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that activities in the dried out floodplain led to
infection among children. Secondary transmissions may be involved. Consequently, 
authorities recommended to avoid playing, swimming and having picnics in the
flood-affected area. Health authorities should consider the potential health
risks of long-term surviving parasites persisting on flooded grounds and in open 
waters even several weeks after the flooding and of bathing places close to
sewage spill-overs. Preventive measures comprise water sampling (involving
parasites), information of the public and prolonged closures of potentially
contaminated sites.
