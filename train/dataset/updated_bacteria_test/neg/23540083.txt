BACKGROUND: The British Medical Research Council (BMRC) staging has been
extensively used to evaluate the disease severity and establish the approximate
prognosis of tuberculous meningitis.
AIMS: This study aimed at analyzing the predictive accuracy for mortality and
neurological sequelae of a set of clinical features, laboratory tests and
imaging.
METHODS: We compared the British Medical Research Council (BMRC) staging with a
new scoring proposal to predict the prognosis of patients with Central Nervous
System Tuberculosis. Data from Ecuador was collected. A score was built using a
Spiegelhalter and Knill-Jones method and compared with BMRC staging with a ROC
curve.
RESULTS: A total of 213/310 patients (68.7%) were in BMRC stage II or III.
Fifty-seven patients died (18.3%) and 101 (32.5%) survived with sequelae. The
associated predictors were consciousness impairment (p = 0.010), motor deficit (p
= 0.003), cisternal effacement (p = 0.006) and infarcts (p = 0.015). The new
score based on these predictors yielded a larger area under the curve of 0.76
(95% CI: 0.70-0.82), but not significantly different from the BMRC (0.72: 95% CI:
0.65-0.77).
CONCLUSIONS: This modern score is easy to apply and could be a sound predictor of
poor prognosis. However, the availability of modern tests did not improve the
ability to predict a bad outcome.
