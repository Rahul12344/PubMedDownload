From 1983 to 1989 14,361 head of cattle from the middle Thuringia region were
investigated by means of microagglutination test for the presence of Leptospira
serovars hardjo, saxkoebing and sejroe. 4,484 samples from cattle with abortion
(1983-1985) and a random sample of 5,284 cattle sera (1985) were investigated
giving priority to L. hardjo. Furthermore 3,293 samples from cattle with abortion
(1986/87) and a random samples test of 1,300 cattle sera (1989) were tested
giving priority to L. saxkoebing. 2.5 percent of the cows having aborted and 10.3
percent of cattle tested out of the whole livestock showed antibodies against L. 
hardjo. The test for presence of L. saxkoebing demonstrated in cattle with
abortion a seroprevalence of 14 percent and in the random samples tests a portion
of reagents of 11.3 percent. The degree of infection differed regionally, the
highest degree was found in livestocks of the northern part of the Thuringia
forest. The prevalence of L. saxkoebing in cattle with abortion from large dairy 
farms was 18.6 percent, which is higher than the average in the region examined. 
Antibodies against hardjo and sejroe were interpreted as caused by cross
reactivity.
