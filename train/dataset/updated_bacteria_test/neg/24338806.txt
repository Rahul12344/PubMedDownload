Recent metagenomic and mechanistic studies are consistent with a new model of
periodontal pathogenesis. This model proposes that periodontal disease is
initiated by a synergistic and dysbiotic microbial community rather than by a
select few bacteria traditionally known as "periopathogens." Low-abundance
bacteria with community-wide effects that are critical for the development of
dysbiosis are now known as keystone pathogens, the best-documented example of
which is Porphyromonas gingivalis. Here, we review established mechanisms by
which P. gingivalis interferes with host immunity and enables the emergence of
dysbiotic communities. We integrate the role of P. gingivalis with that of other 
bacteria acting upstream and downstream in pathogenesis. Accessory pathogens act 
upstream to facilitate P. gingivalis colonization and co-ordinate metabolic
activities, whereas commensals-turned pathobionts act downstream and contribute
to destructive inflammation. The recent concepts of keystone pathogens, along
with polymicrobial synergy and dysbiosis, have profound implications for the
development of therapeutic options for periodontal disease.
