We have cloned the zebrafish ortholog of the mammalian cyp26b1 gene. The
predicted zebrafish cyp26b1 protein shares greater than 73% identity with
mammalian homologues. cDNA transfection assays showed that like human cyp26b1,
zebrafish cyp26b1 is involved in limiting the activity of retinoic acid. Reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of embryonic RNAs
suggested that no maternal cyp26b1 message is detectable. Zygotic cyp26b1 message
could be detected at 75% epiboly by RT-PCR and localized to presumptive
rhombomere 3 and rhombomere 4 at the early two-somite (2S) stage (10.5 hpf: hour 
post fertilization) by whole mount in situ hybridization. As development proceeds
expression expands anteriorly to include rhombomere 2 at the 10S stage (14hpf).
By 14S (16hpf) expression in the hindbrain has also expanded posteriorly and
encompasses rhombomere 2 through rhombomere 6. At later stages, 24 through 48
hpf, additional expression was found in the eyes, diencephalon,
midbrain-hindbrain boundary, cerebellum, pectoral fin and the pharyngeal arch
primordia.
