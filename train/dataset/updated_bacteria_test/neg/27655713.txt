Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) receptor overexpression, KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A and
SMAD4 mutations characterize pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. This mutational
landscape might influence cancer cells response to EGF, Transforming Growth
Factor β1 (TGFβ1) and stromal inflammatory calcium binding proteins S100A8/A9. We
investigated whether chronic exposure to EGF modifies in a SMAD4-dependent manner
pancreatic cancer cell signalling, proliferation and invasion in response to EGF,
TGFβ1 and S100A8/A9. BxPC3, homozigously deleted (HD) for SMAD4, and BxPC3-SMAD4+
cells were or not stimulated with EGF (100 ng/mL) for three days. EGF pre-treated
and non pretreated cells were stimulated with a single dose of EGF (100 ng/mL),
TGFβ1 (0,02 ng/mL), S100A8/A9 (10 nM). Signalling pathways (Reverse Phase Protein
Array and western blot), cell migration (Matrigel) and cell proliferation (XTT)
were evaluated. SMAD4 HD constitutively activated ERK and Wnt/β-catenin, while
inhibiting PI3K/AKT pathways. These effects were antagonized by chronic EGF,
which increased p-BAD (anti-apoptotic) in response to combined TGFβ1 and
S100A8/A9 stimulation. SMAD4 HD underlied the inhibition of NF-κB and PI3K/AKT in
response to TGFβ1 and S100A8/A9, which also induced cell migration. Chronic EGF
exposure enhanced cell migration of both BxPC3 and BxPC3-SMAD4+, rendering the
cells less sensitive to the other inflammatory stimuli. In conclusion, SMAD4 HD
is associated with the constitutive activation of the ERK and Wnt/β-catenin
signalling pathways, and favors the EGF-induced activation of multiple signalling
pathways critical to cancer proliferation and invasion. TGFβ1 and S100A8/A9
mainly inhibit NF-κB and PI3K/AKT pathways and, when combined, sinergize with EGF
in enhancing anti-apoptotic p-BAD in a SMAD4-dependent manner.
