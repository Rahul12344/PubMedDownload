Despite advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology, granulomatous
diseases remain a diagnostic challenge for the clinician as well as for the
pathologist. However, establishing the correct diagnosis of these diseases is
a crucial prerequisite of targeted therapy. It is particularly essential to
distinguish between an infectious and a non-infectious cause, since
anti-infectious and anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive approaches are
opposing. Failure to establish the correct diagnosis can lead to adverse
consequences for the patient. An interdisciplinary approach and a critical
assessment of clinical, laboratory-chemical, microbiological, imaging, and
anatomical-pathological findings are crucial for the evaluation of granulomatous 
disorders. This overview summarizes important landmarks and their value in the
interplay of arriving at the correct diagnosis.
