Invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT cells) rapidly produce effector cytokines.
In this study, we report the first crystal structures of the iNKT cell T cell
receptor (TCR) bound to two natural, microbial glycolipids presented by CD1d.
Binding of the TCR induced CDR3-α-dependent structural changes in the F' roof of 
CD1d; these changes resemble those occurring in the absence of TCR engagement
when the highly potent synthetic antigen α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) binds
CD1d. Furthermore, in the Borrelia burgdorferi α-galactosyl diacylglycerol-CD1d
complex, TCR binding caused a marked repositioning of the galactose sugar into an
orientation that closely resembles α-GalCer. The TCR-dependent reorientation of
the sugar, together with the induced CD1d fit, may explain the weaker potency of 
the microbial antigens compared with α-GalCer. We propose that the TCR of iNKT
cells binds with a conserved footprint onto CD1d, regardless of the bound
glycolipid antigen, and that for microbial antigens this unique binding mode
requires TCR-initiated conformational changes.
