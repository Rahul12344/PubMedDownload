Two parallel, stable operating biogas reactors were fed with increasing amounts
of maize silage to monitor microbial community changes caused by overloading.
Changes of microorganisms diversity revealed by SSCP (single strand conformation 
polymorphism) indicating an acidification before and during the pH-value
decrease. The earliest indicator was the appearance of a Methanosarcina
thermophila-related species. Diversity of dominant fermenting bacteria within
Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and other Bacteria decreased upon overloading. Some
species became dominant directly before and during acidification and thus could
be suitable as possible indicator organisms for detection of futurity
acidification. Those bacteria were related to Prolixibacter bellariivorans and
Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius. An early detection of community
shifts will allow better feeding management for optimal biogas production.
