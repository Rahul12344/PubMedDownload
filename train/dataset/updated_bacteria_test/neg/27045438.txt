Periodontal diseases as a source of halitosis: a review of the evidence and
treatment approaches for dentists and dental hygienists.

De Geest S, Laleman I, Teughels W, Dekeyser C, Quirynen M.

Bad breath (halitosis) is an important social complaint. In most cases (≥90%),
the cause of halitosis can be found within the oral cavity. Under this
circumstance, the term oral malodor applies. It affects both healthy and
periodontally diseased individuals. Oral malodor is mainly caused by a microbial 
degradation of both sulfur-containing and nonsulfur-containing amino acids into
volatile, bad-smelling gases. Anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the same species 
that have been linked to periodontal diseases, are especially involved in this
process, explaining why clinicians often associate oral malodor with
periodontitis. Some volatile organic compounds render patients more susceptible
to periodontitis and this supports the malodor-periodontitis link. This review
investigates the interaction between oral malodor and periodontal diseases. Pro
and con arguments regarding the mechanisms of halitosis and clinical implications
will be presented. In general, however, the impact of tongue coatings has been
found to be the dominant factor, besides gingivitis and periodontitis. The last
part of this review discusses the treatment of bad breath, with different
options.
