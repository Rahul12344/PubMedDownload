Microbiological spoilage of a foodstuff leads to organoleptically detectable
flaws in the odor, taste, appearance or consistency of the foodstuff. Intrinsic
factors of the foodstuff as well as extrinsic factors affecting the foodstuff's
storage and packaging conditions will have an effect on the rate of development
of the population of spoilage bacteria. Specific spoilage organisms will become
selected to respective foodstuffs, giving rise to the sensory off-aromas through 
their metabolic reactions. The genera and species of microbial spoilage
populations of foodstuffs of different type exhibit great variation.
