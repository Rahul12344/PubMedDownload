Insertional mutants of the fungal maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus were
screened for altered virulence. One mutant had 60% reduction in lesion size
relative to WT but no other detectable change in phenotype. Analysis of sequence 
at the insertion site revealed a gene (CPS1) encoding a protein with two
AMP-binding domains. CPS1 orthologs were detected in all Cochliobolus spp.
examined, in several other classes of ascomycete fungi, and in animals but not in
basidiomycete fungi, bacteria, or plants. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that
CPS1 represents a previously undescribed subset of adenylate-forming enzymes that
have diverged from certain acyl-CoA ligases, which in bacteria are involved in
biosynthesis of nonribosomal peptides or polyketidepeptide hybrids. Disruption of
CPS1 caused reduced virulence of both race T and race O of C. heterostrophus on
maize, of Cochliobolus victoriae on oats, and of Gibberella zeae on wheat. These 
results suggest that CPS1 functions as a general fungal virulence factor in plant
pathogenic ascomycetes.
