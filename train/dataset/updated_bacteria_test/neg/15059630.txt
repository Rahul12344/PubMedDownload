The sequence of a 4.6-kb region of DNA from Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13869
lying upstream from the ftsQ-ftsZ region has been determined. The region contains
four genes with high similarity to the murD, ftsW, murG, and murC genes from
different microorganisms. The products of these mur genes probably catalyse
several steps in the formation of the precursors for peptidoglycan synthesis in
C. glutamicum, whereas ftsW might play also a role in the stabilisation of the
FtsZ ring during cell division. The murC gene product was purified to near
homogeneity and its UDP-N-acetylmuramate: L-alanine adding activity was
demonstrated. Northern analysis indicated that ftsW, murG and ftsQ are poorly
expressed in C. glutamicum whereas murC and ftsZ are expressed at higher levels
at the beginning of the exponential phase. Dicistronic (ftsQ-ftsZ) and
monocistronic (murC and ftsZ) transcripts can be detected using specific probes
and are in agreement with the lack of transcriptional terminators in the
partially analysed dcw cluster. Disruption experiments performed in C. glutamicum
using internal fragments of the ftsW, murG and murC genes allowed us to conclude 
that FtsW, MurG, and MurC are essential gene products in C. glutamicum.
