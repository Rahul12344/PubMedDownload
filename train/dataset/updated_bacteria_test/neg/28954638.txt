BACKGROUND: An odontogenic cause of a lung abscess can easily be overlooked.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 61-year-old man presented at the emergency department with a 
productive cough and dyspnoea. He was admitted to the pulmonary ward with a
suspected odontogenic lung abscess. A thorax CT scan confirmed the diagnosis
'lung abscess', following which the dental surgeon confirmed that the lung
abscess probably had an odontogenic cause. The patient made a full recovery
following a 6-week course of antibiotics, and he received extensive dental
treatment.
CONCLUSION: Poor oral hygiene can be a cause of a lung abscess. A patient with a 
lung abscess can be treated successfully with a 6-week course of antibiotics;
however, if the odontogenic cause is not recognised the abscess can recur.
