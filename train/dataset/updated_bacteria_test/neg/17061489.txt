Treatment options for bacterial vaginosis are numerous, however for urinary tract
infection (UTI) by Gardnerella vaginalis have been not reported. Our purpose was 
to compare the efficacy and treatment complications of oral metronidazole versus 
oral ampicillin for treatment of this condition in a prospective randomized,
nonblinded study. Fifty-seven women who had symptoms of UTI and a positive
culture for G. vaginalis were enrolled in the study. Only forty-five subjects
were considered valuable: 25 treated with oral metronidazole 500 mg twice daily
for 7 days, and 20 with oral ampicillin 2 g for 10 days. Positive culture was
defined as the presence of 10(4) or 10(5) UFC/ml of G. vaginalis in pure culture 
in HBT media. The clinical and bacteriological cure rates were 92% and 96%
respectively for metronidazole and 90% in both for ampicillin. Chi-squared
analysis reveals no statistical significance between two treatments. Adverse
events were common in-patients treated with metronidazole whereas relatively few 
side effects were experienced in-patients treated with ampicillin. Ampicillin is 
effective, safe and well-tolerated therapy for UTI by G. vaginalis. In contrast
oral metronidazole is effective but no safe and bad-tolerated therapy for the
same condition.
