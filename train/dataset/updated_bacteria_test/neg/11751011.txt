Trout fry were experimentally infected with endoparasites (Anisakis sp.) and/or
ectoparasites (Gyrodactylus derjavini). During the following 3 weeks the
infection level of G. derjavini was significantly lowered in fish infected with
live anisakids compared to fish injected with physiological saline, a
corresponding amount of Anisakis protein sonicate or to untreated fish.
Subsequent scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of recovered nematodes from the
trout showed an extensive colonization of the worms with host macrophages. It is 
indicated that the activation of the fish immune system by infection with live
anisakids influences the skin response of the host with a subsequent negative
effect on the ectoparasites G. derjavini.
