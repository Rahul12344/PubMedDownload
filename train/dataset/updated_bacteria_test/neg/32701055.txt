Chronic ethanol consumption is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with
higher risks to develop pulmonary infections, including Aspergillus infections.
Mechanisms underlying increased susceptibility to infections are poorly
understood. Chronic ethanol consumption induced increased mortality rates, higher
Aspergillus fumigatus burden and reduced neutrophil recruitment into the airways.
Intravital microscopy showed decrease in leukocyte adhesion and rolling after
ethanol consumption. Moreover, downregulated neutrophil activation and increased 
levels of serum CXCL1 in ethanol-fed mice induced internalization of CXCR2
receptor in circulating neutrophils. Bone marrow-derived neutrophils from
ethanol-fed mice showed lower fungal clearance and defective reactive oxygen
species production. Taken together, results showed that ethanol affects
activation, recruitment, phagocytosis and killing functions of neutrophils,
causing susceptibility to pulmonary A. fumigatus infection. This study
establishes a new paradigm in innate immune response in chronic ethanol
consumers.

plain-language-summary: Alcoholism is a chronic disease that has many damaging
effects on the body. Over long periods, excessive alcohol intake weakens the
immune system, putting consumers at increased risk of getting lung infections
such as pneumonia. Some forms of pneumonia can be caused by the fungus
Aspergillus fumigatus. This microbe does not tend to be a problem for healthy
individuals, but it can be fatal for those with impaired immune systems. Here,
Malacco et al. wanted to find out why excessive alcohol consumers are more prone 
to pneumonia. To test this, the researchers used two groups of mice that were
either fed plain water or water containing ethanol. After 12 weeks, both groups
were infected with Aspergillus fumigatus. The results showed that alcohol-fed
mice were more susceptible to the infection caused by strong inflammation of the 
lungs. Normally, the immune system confronts a lung infection by activating a
group of defense cells called neutrophils, which travel through the blood system 
to the infection site. Once in the right spot, neutrophils get to work by
releasing toxins that kill the fungus. Malacco et al. discovered that after
chronic alcohol consumption, neutrophils were less reactive to inflammatory
signals and less likely to reach the lungs. They were also less effective in
dealing with the infection. Neutrophil released fewer toxins and were thus less
able to kill the microbial cells. These findings demonstrate for the first time
how alcohol can affect immune cells during infection and pave the way for new
possibilities to prevent fatal lung infections in excessive alcohol consumers. A 
next step would be to identify how alcohol acts on other processes in the body
and to find a way to modulate or even revert the changes it causes.
