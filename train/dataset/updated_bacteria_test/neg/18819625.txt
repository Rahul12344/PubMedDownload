The ctxB gene, the causative agent of cholera epidemic was successfully cloned
from V. cholerae in E. coli. The insertion of the gene was confirmed by PCR as
well as restriction digestion analyses. The sequencing results for the gene
confirmed that the insert was in the correct orientation and in-frame with the
P(BAD) promoter and it showed that the gene was 99% homologous to the published
ctxB sequence. The CTB protein was successfully expressed in E. coli using the
pBAD/His vector system. The expected protein of approximately 14 kDa was detected
by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The use of pBAD/His vector to express the cholera
toxin gene in E. coli would facilitate future study of toxin gene products.
