Venomous snakes are important subjects of study in evolution, ecology, and
biomedicine. Many venomous snakes have alpha-neurotoxins (α-neurotoxins) in their
venom. These toxins bind the alpha-1 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) at 
the neuromuscular junction, causing paralysis and asphyxia. Several venomous
snakes and their predators have evolved resistance to α-neurotoxins. The
resistance is conferred by steric hindrance from N-glycosylated asparagines at
amino acids 187 or 189, by an arginine at position 187 that has been hypothesized
to either electrostatically repulse positively charged neurotoxins or sterically 
interfere with α-neurotoxin binding, or proline replacements at positions 194 or 
197 of the nAChR ligand-binding domain to inhibit α-neurotoxin binding through
structural changes in the receptor. Here, we analyzed this domain in 148
vertebrate species, and assessed its amino acid sequences for
resistance-associated mutations. Of these sequences, 89 were sequenced de novo.
We find widespread convergent evolution of the N-glycosylation form of resistance
in several taxa including venomous snakes and their lizard prey, but not in the
snake-eating birds studied. We also document new lineages with the arginine form 
of inhibition. Using an in vivo assay in four species, we provide further
evidence that N-glycosylation mutations reduce the toxicity of cobra venom. The
nAChR is of crucial importance for normal neuromuscular function and is highly
conserved throughout the vertebrates as a result. Our research shows that the
evolution of α-neurotoxins in snakes may well have prompted arms races and
mutations to this ancient receptor across a wide range of sympatric vertebrates. 
These findings underscore the inter-connectedness of the biosphere and the ripple
effects that one adaption can have across global ecosystems.
