Both short-term and long-term biofiltration experiments were undertaken with a
biofilter inoculated with a defined microbial consortium and treating an
alkylbenzene mixture. The results obtained with such a biofilter in short-term
experiments were very similar to those obtained with a biofilter inoculated with 
a non-defined mixed culture, in terms of maximum elimination capacities (70-72 g 
m(-3) h(-1)) and the corresponding removal efficiencies (>95%). However, in
long-term experiments, a better performance was reached, with a maximum
elimination capacity of 120 g m(-3) h(-1), corresponding to a removal efficiency 
>99% after 2 years of operation. Inoculation proved to be useful for shortening
the start-up period. In the long term, it appeared that biomass distribution was 
not homogenous along the biofilter, which in some cases resulted in a bad fit
between simple model equations and experimental data.
