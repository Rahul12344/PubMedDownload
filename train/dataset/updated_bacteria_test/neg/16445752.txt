sucAB and sucCD of Escherichia coli encode enzymes that generate succinyl-CoA
from 2-oxoglutarate and succinate, respectively. Their mutual essentiality was
studied. sucAB and sucCD could be deleted individually, but not simultaneously.
The mutual essentiality of sucAB and sucCD was further confirmed by the
conditional expression of sucABCD, sucAB, and sucCD under the control of a P(BAD)
in E. coli MG1655, E. coli MG1655 (DeltasucCD), and E. coli MG1655 (DeltasucAB), 
respectively. These strains grew well in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1%
arabinose, but not in the absence of arabinose unless the medium was supplemented
with succinyl-CoA. Our results indicate that either sucAB or sucCD is enough to
produce succinyl-CoA that is essential for cell viability.
