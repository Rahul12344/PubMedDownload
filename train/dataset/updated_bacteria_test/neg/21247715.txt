The Streptococcus bovis/equinus complex is a heterogeneous group within the group
D streptococci with important clinical relevance regarding infective
endocarditis, sepsis and colon carcinoma. The taxonomic identification of species
and sub-species of this complex, by the standard methods remains difficult. In
the present study, we compared the cluster analysis of 88 strains of species of
the S. bovis/equinus complex by sequence analysis of the manganese-dependent
superoxide dismutase gene (sodA) and by Matrix Assisted Laser
Desorption/Ionization-Time Of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). We
observed a high congruence of strain grouping by MALDI-TOF MS in comparison with 
sodA sequence analyses, demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of MALDI-TOF
MS in comparison to DNA sequence-based method. By generating mass spectra for
each species and sub-species, we were able to discriminate all members of the S. 
bovis/equinus complex. Furthermore, we demonstrated reliable identifications to
the species level by MALDI-TOF MS, independently of cultivation conditions.
