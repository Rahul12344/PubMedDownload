This study was designed to investigate the prostate cancer-specific tumoricidal
effect of the suicide gene, Escherichia coli uracil phosphoribosyltransferase
(UPRT), driven by the human prostate-specific membrane antigen promoter/enhancer 
(PSMA(E/P)) in vitro. When transfected with PSMA(E/P)-EGFP (enhanced green
fluorescence protein) (a plasmid construct with the green fluorescence protein
gene driven by the PSMA(E/P)), only the androgen-responsive and PSMA-positive
prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, expressed GFP, indicating the specificity of
the PSMA(E/P) activity in androgen-sensitive and PSMA-positive prostate cancer
cells. Taking advantage of this prostate cancer-specific property of PSMA(E/P),
we successfully introduced bacterial UPRT into LNCaP cells where the tumoricidal 
effect of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was significantly increased when compared with
the cells without the exogenous UPRT. We conclude that the efficacy of 5-FU-based
chemotherapy in prostate cancers can be significantly improved by targeted
expression of the suicide gene UPRT under the control of PSMA(E/P).
