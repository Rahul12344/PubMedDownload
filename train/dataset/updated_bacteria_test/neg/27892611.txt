Axillary malodour is a frustrating condition for many people. It can lead to
significant discomforts and various psychological effects. The underarm
microbiome plays a major role in axillary malodour formation. Not only the
bacteria on the epidermis, but also and especially those living in the sweat
glands, sweat pores and hair follicles play a pivotal role in malodour
development. To treat underarm malodour, this viewpoint article envisions a
bacterial treatment. Replacing the autochthonous malodour-causing microbiome with
a non-odour-causing microbiome, through an armpit bacterial transplantation or
direct application of probiotics/non-odour-causing bacteria, could resolve the
condition. Selective steering of the microbiome with prebiotics, biochemicals or 
plant extracts can likewise greatly help in improving the underarm odour.
Elimination/inhibition of the "bad bugs" and application/stimulation of the "good
bugs" will be part of the future treatment for axillary body odour.
