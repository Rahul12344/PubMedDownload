Urosepsis is not uncommon and sometimes causes a critical condition including
death. We retrospectivelyanaly zed the risk factors for mortalityin urosepsis. We
treated 80 patients as urosepsis from 2010 to 2014 in our hospital. Five patients
(6%) died within 30 days of hospitalization. The median age of the patients who
died of urosepsis was 92 years (range, 83-95 years). The main causes of urosepsis
were complicated pyelonephritis in 4 patients and emphysematous pyelonephritis in
one. In the subgroup analysis of elderly patients over 75 years old, bad
performance status and lower serum albumin were significantlyrelated to
mortality(p Ôºù0.033, 0.046). The elderlypatients, especiallywith bad performance
status and lower serum albumin, are more likelyto die.
