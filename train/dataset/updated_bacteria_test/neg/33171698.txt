Equine piroplasmosis (EP), caused by the hemoparasites Theileria equi, Theileria 
haneyi, and Babesia caballi, is an important tick-borne disease of equines that
is prevalent in most parts of the world. Infection may affect animal welfare and 
has economic impacts related to limitations in horse transport between endemic
and non-endemic regions, reduced performance of sport horses and treatment costs.
Here, we analyzed the epidemiological, serological, and molecular diagnostic data
published in the last 20 years, and all DNA sequences submitted to GenBank
database, to describe the current global prevalence of these parasites. We
demonstrate that EP is endemic in most parts of the world, and that it is
spreading into more temperate climates. We emphasize the importance of using DNA 
sequencing and genotyping to monitor the spread of parasites, and point to the
necessity of further studies to improve genotypic characterization of newly
recognized parasite species and strains, and their linkage to virulence.
