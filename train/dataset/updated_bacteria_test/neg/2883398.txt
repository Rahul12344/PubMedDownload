Haemorrhagic colitis and Vero-cytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli in England and
Wales.

Smith HR, Rowe B, Gross RJ, Fry NK, Scotland SM.

Vero-cytotoxin-producing strains of Escherichia coli (VTEC) were identified by
the use of DNA probes in 39% of faecal samples from patients with haemorrhagic
colitis in England and Wales. The patients with VTEC were distributed widely and 
their ages ranged from 2.5 to 86 years (mean 41). 3 patients died, including a
child of 2.5 years. 30 of the 32 VTEC strains belonged to serogroup O157. Plating
on sorbitol agar for non-fermenters followed by agglutination with a specific
O157 antiserum was a useful screening method for O157 VT+ strains. However, it
was not as sensitive as the DNA probe technique and did not detect VTEC of other 
serogroups.
