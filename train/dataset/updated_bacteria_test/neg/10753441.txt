When batch and continuous Bacillus subtilis cultures are provided with a small
amount of citrate, acid production ceases, carbon yield increases by more than
2-fold, and the productivity of recombinant protein increases. It has been
hypothesized that pyruvate kinase activity is attenuated, which in turn lowers
glucose flux and minimizes the acid overflow prompted by low Krebs cycle
capacity. To complement existing enzyme activity, linear programming, and
metabolite pool studies, (13)C NMR studies were performed. Atom mapping and
isotopomer mapping matrix methods were used to select the best glucose label.
"Best" was defined such that the NMR spectra of glutamate associated with
metabolizing labeled glucose via the different candidate metabolic trafficking
scenarios would differ considerably in fine structure (e.g., relative singlet
intensities). When experiments were performed with 1-(13)C glucose, the observed 
NMR spectra corresponded well to the one predicted to arise when the metabolic
trafficking occurs according to a pyruvate kinase attenuation scenario. This
evidence further fortifies the prospects for successfully basing a metabolic
engineering strategy on reducing pyruvate kinase activity to better match
glycolytic and Krebs cycle capacities.
