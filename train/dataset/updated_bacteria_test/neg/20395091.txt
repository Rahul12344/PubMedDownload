OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the good use organization and
fluoroquinolone prescription habits in cases of bone and joint, urinary,
pulmonary, and digestive infections.
DESIGN: A declarative survey was made (questionnaire for the hospital and for the
prescriber).
RESULTS: Thirty percent (44/145) of hospitals participated with 274 prescribers. 
Eighty percent had prescription protocols, 71 % of clinicians had access to
epidemiologic data. A percentage of 30.7 (853/2,771) of prescriptions included a 
fluoroquinolone, 44.5 % (380/853) among these had not been recommended. The
excessive prescription reached 24.4 % (116/474) in case of bone and joint
infection, 14.6 % (107/731), and 20 % (157/779) in cases of digestive and
respiratory infection respectively. Prescriptions for urinary infection were
adequate in 47.6 % (375/787) of cases. Inadequate prescriptions were made because
of bad knowledge of bacteria resistance epidemiology and pharmacology
(insufficient dose, monotherapy at risk of selection), and non-application of
good practice recommendations.
CONCLUSION: This study justifies the rationalization of antibiotic prescription.
