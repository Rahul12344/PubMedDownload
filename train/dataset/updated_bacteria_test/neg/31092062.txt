Introduction: Currently, basic understanding of heterogeneity and complexity of
tumors is depicted at molecular, cellular, genetic, epigenetic and metabolic
adaptations levels. Areas covered: There are appreciable numbers of views to
pinpoint signaling axis that support metabolic adaptations of cancer cells in
response to environmental pressures including nutritional factors and drug
treatments. Specifically, nutritional deprivation and autophagy in certain types 
of cancer are linked to the abilities of cancer cells to use arginine in an
auxotrophic or prototrophic manner. Expert opinion: Hence, this paper highlights 
the current scope of arginine- and autophagy-centered metabolic adaptations
across tumor types and possible avenues to bring tumors towards cytotoxic or
cytostatic death.
