AIM: To compare the prevalence of antibiotic resistance found in nasopharyngeal
Streptococcus pneumoniae between villages treated with topical tetracycline or
systemic azithromycin as part of a trachoma control programme.
METHODS: All children aged 1-10 years were offered either single dose oral
azithromycin treatment (20 mg/kg) or a course of topical 1% tetracycline
ointment, depending on the area. Treatment was given annually for 3 years. Six
months after the third annual treatment in each village, children were surveyed
for nasopharyngeal carriage of S pneumoniae and resistance was determined using
broth dilution MIC technique. Children in two additional villages, which had not 
yet been treated, were also surveyed.
RESULTS: Nasopharyngeal carriage of S pneumoniae was similar in the tetracycline 
treated, azithromycin treated, and untreated areas (p=0.57). However, resistance 
to tetracycline and azithromycin was distributed differently between the three
areas (p=0.004). The village treated with topical tetracycline had a higher
prevalence of tetracycline resistance than the other villages (p=0.010), while
the oral azithromycin treated village had a higher prevalence of macrolide
resistance than the other villages (p=0.014).
CONCLUSIONS: Annual mass treatment with oral azithromycin may alter the
prevalence of drug resistant S pneumoniae in a community. Surprisingly, topical
tetracycline may also increase nasopharyngeal pneumococcal resistance. Topical
antibiotics may have an effect on extraocular bacterial resistance.
