Currently, the first therapeutic attempt to eradicate Helicobacter pylori fails
in one case out of six in intention to treat analysis. The main causes of failure
are bad compliance, partly because of side effects that are severe in 1 to 4% of 
cases, absence of local validation of the treatment scheme, since some
differences do exist between regions and countries, primary and secondary
resistance of the strain (stable for Imidazole-derivates, but increasing for
Macrolides), and, to a lesser extent, smoking and pre-treatment with proton pump 
inhibitors. Moreover, in routine medicine, inappropriate treatment cocktails are 
still prescribed, even by gastroenterologists. Obviously, there is a need for
careful medical education and information both as far as concerns doctors and
patients, for well-designed prescription, based on local experience and the
precise previous history of every patient, as well as for continuous monitoring
of the bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Culture of the strain is recommended 
after eradication failure with the classic one-week triple therapy, but if
reliable culture and resistance testing are not available, the quadruple therapy 
as a second-line treatment is, so far, the best choice.
