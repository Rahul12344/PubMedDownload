BACKGROUND: The genus Bordetella consists of nine species that include important 
respiratory pathogens such as the 'classical' species B. bronchiseptica, B.
pertussis and B. parapertussis and six more distantly related and less
extensively studied species. Here we analyze sequence diversity and gene content 
of 128 genome sequences from all nine species with focus on the evolution of
virulence-associated factors.
RESULTS: Both genome-wide sequence-based and gene content-based phylogenetic
trees divide the genus into three species clades. The phylogenies are congruent
between species suggesting genus-wide co-evolution of sequence diversity and gene
content, but less correlated within species, mainly because of strain-specific
presence of many different prophages. We compared the genomes with focus on
virulence-associated genes and identified multiple clade-specific,
species-specific and strain-specific events of gene acquisition and gene loss,
including genes encoding O-antigens, protein secretion systems and bacterial
toxins. Gene loss was more frequent than gene gain throughout the evolution, and 
loss of hundreds of genes was associated with the origin of several species,
including the recently evolved human-restricted B. pertussis and B. holmesii, B. 
parapertussis and the avian pathogen B. avium.
CONCLUSIONS: Acquisition and loss of multiple genes drive the evolution and
speciation in the genus Bordetella, including large scale gene loss associated
with the origin of several species. Recent loss and functional inactivation of
genes, including those encoding pertussis vaccine components and bacterial
toxins, in individual strains emphasize ongoing evolution.
