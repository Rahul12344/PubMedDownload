Background: Professional and paramedical students have a key role in oral health 
promotion. The aim of this study was to assess oral health-related Knowledge,
Attitude, and Practice (KAP) among the nursing students in Rajasthan.
Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was carried
out among 409 nursing students from five different institutes who were selected
by simple random sampling. A 27-item questionnaire was used to assess KAP. The
resulting data were analyzed using frequency distribution.
Results: Over 50% of the students used toothbrush and toothpaste twice a day to
maintain their oral hygiene. Besides, 41% recognized the importance of dental
visit in case of gingival bleeding and knew that poor oral hygiene is responsible
for bad breath.
Conclusions: Oral health-related behavior among the nursing students needs
improvement. More educational and preventive programs should be organized to
achieve better results.
