Osteomyelitis at the base of an ulcer the foot of diabetic patient is a serious
complication usually produced because of the patient's neglect, and entailing
difficulties in diagnosis and treatment. Several factors (neurological and
vascular ...) favor the onset of the initial ulcer and its evolution, the ulcer
subsequently converting into the main door for soft tissue infection with
extension to the contiguous bone, with a bad prognosis. Cefotaxime is a 3rd
generation cephalosporin, active against coccus gram positive and the majority of
aerobic gram negative bacillus. This antibiotic was used in 25 diabetic patients 
with osteomyelitis at a dosage of 2 gr. IV a/d, during at least 30 days, adding
metronidazole when anaerobic bacteria were isolated. The number of patients cured
were 21 (84%), one improvement (4%), one resistant (4%) and two relapses (8%).
There were no secondary effects.
