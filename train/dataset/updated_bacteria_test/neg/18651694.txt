The Mur ligases have an essential role in the intracellular biosynthesis of
bacterial peptidoglycan, and they represent attractive targets for the design of 
novel antibacterials. A series of compounds with an N-acylhydrazone scaffold were
synthesized and screened for inhibition of the MurC and MurD enzymes from
Escherichia coli. Compounds with micromolar inhibitory activities against both
MurC and MurD were identified, and some of them also showed antibacterial
activity.
