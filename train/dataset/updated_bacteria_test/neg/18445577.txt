These evidence-based guidelines have been produced after a systematic literature 
review of a range of issues involving prevention, diagnosis and treatment of
hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Prevention is structured into sections
addressing general issues, equipment, patient procedures and the environment,
whereas in treatment, the structure addresses the use of antimicrobials in
prevention and treatment, adjunctive therapies and the application of clinical
protocols. The sections dealing with diagnosis are presented against the
clinical, radiological and microbiological diagnosis of HAP. Recommendations are 
also made upon the role of invasive sampling and quantitative microbiology of
respiratory secretions in directing antibiotic therapy in
HAP/ventilator-associated pneumonia.
