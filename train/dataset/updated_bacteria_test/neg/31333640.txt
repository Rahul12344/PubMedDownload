Pertussis is an acute respiratory disease caused by Bordetella pertussis. Due to 
its frequency and severity, prevention of pertussis has been considered an
important public health issue for many years. The development of the whole-cell
pertussis vaccine (wPV) and its introduction into the pediatric immunization
schedule was associated with a marked reduction in pertussis cases in the
vaccinated cohort. However, due to the frequency of local and systemic adverse
events after immunization with wPV, work on a less reactive vaccine was
undertaken based on isolated B. pertussis components that induced protective
immune responses with fewer local and systemic reactions. These component
vaccines were termed acellular vaccines and contained one or more pertussis
antigens, including pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA),
pertactin (PRN), and fimbrial proteins 2 (FIM2) and 3 (FIM3). Preparations
containing up to five components were developed, and several efficacy trials
clearly demonstrated that the aPVs were able to confer comparable short-term
protection than the most effective wPVs with fewer local and systemic reactions. 
There has been a resurgence of pertussis observed in recent years. This paper
reports the results of a Consensus Conference organized by the World Association 
for Infectious Disease and Immunological Disorders (WAidid) on June 22, 2018, in 
Perugia, Italy, with the goal of evaluating the most important reasons for the
pertussis resurgence and the role of different aPVs in this resurgence.
