Most bacteria produce adhesion molecules to facilitate the interaction with host 
cells and establish successful infections. An important group of bacterial
adhesins belong to the autotransporter (AT) superfamily, the largest group of
secreted and outer membrane proteins in Gram-negative bacteria. AT adhesins
possess diverse functions that facilitate bacterial colonisation, survival and
persistence, and as such are often associated with increased bacterial fitness
and pathogenic potential. In this review, we will describe AIDA-I type AT
adhesins, which comprise the biggest and most diverse group in the AT family. We 
will focus on Escherichia coli proteins and define general aspects of their
biogenesis, distribution, structural properties and key roles in infection.
