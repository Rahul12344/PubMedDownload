The Hox-1.3 gene is located on mouse chromosome 6 and has been previously shown
to be expressed in mouse embryos and adults. In this study, we have examined the 
steady-state levels of the Hox-1.3 transcripts in undifferentiated and
differentiated F9 embryonal carcinoma cells. We find that there is a rapid
increase of Hox-1.3 transcripts after differentiation induction of F9 cells. The 
level of the major 1.85-kilobase (kb) transcript peaks at 16-24 hr after
differentiation induction of F9 cells. By using primer extension techniques the
5' ends of the major 1.85-kb transcript have been mapped to two sites in induced 
F9 cells. Cellular fractionation of RNA and transfer blot gel analysis has
localized one minor transcript to the nucleus, whereas the major transcript and
two additional minor transcripts appear in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of
induced F9 cells. The results of nuclear run-off experiments with uninduced and
induced F9 cell nuclei indicate that there is a substantial increase in the rate 
of Hox-1.3 transcription upon induction of F9 cells with retinoic acid.
