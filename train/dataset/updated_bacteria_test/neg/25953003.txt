Numerous isolates of Flavobacterium columnare were previously recovered from red 
tilapia, Oreochromis sp., exhibiting columnaris-like disease in Thai farms, and
the phenotypic and genetic characteristics were described. The objective of this 
study was to determine the virulence of two morphotypes (rhizoid and non-rhizoid 
colonies) of F. columnare and to determine their ability to adhere to and persist
in red tilapia fry. The results showed that the typical rhizoid isolate
(CUVET1214) was a highly virulent isolate and caused 100% mortality within 24 h
following bath challenge of red tilapia with three different doses. The
non-rhizoid isolate (CUVET1201) was avirulent to red tilapia fry. Both
morphotypes adhered to and persisted in tilapia similarly at 0.5 and 6 h
post-challenge as determined by whole fish bacterial loads. At 24 and 48 h
post-challenge, fry challenged with the rhizoid morphotype exhibited
significantly higher bacterial loads than the non-rhizoid morphotype. The results
suggested that an inability of the non-rhizoid morphotype to persist in tilapia
fry may explain lack of virulence.
