Microcystins are a family of cyclic heptapeptide toxins naturally produced by
freshwater cyanobacteria. Microcystin-LR (MCLR) is believed to be the most toxic 
and common one with various pathological effects on human and mammals. However,
the effects of MCLR on endothelial cells and vascular homeostasis have been
largely unknown. We explored the mRNA and protein expression changes of several
pro-inflammatory mediators in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and
C57BC/6 mice exposed to MCLR. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 
beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), especially interleukin-8 (IL-8) were
remarkably upregulated both in endothelial cells and in serum. Increased
endothelial permeability in vitro and chronic microvascular permeability in
animals were also observed. Silencing the IL-8 gene with siRNA or blocking its
cognate receptor, CXC-chemokine receptor type 2 (CXCR2), by a specific inhibitor 
efficiently prevented the MCLR induced leakage. These observations indicate a
novel insight of inflammation triggered property of MCLR via IL-8/CXCR2
signaling, suggesting CXCR2 as a target molecule in protective strategy against
the wide range pollution of microcystin.
