This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence, multidrug-resistance traits,
PCR-detection of virulence, and antibiotic-resistance genes of E. coli isolated
from secondary infections following FMD-outbreak in cattle. A total of 160 random
samples were gathered from private dairy farms in Damietta Province, Egypt. The
specimens were subjected to bacteriological examination, serotyping, congo-red
binding assay, antibiogram-testing, and PCR-monitoring of virulence-determinant
genes (tsh, phoA, hly, eaeA, sta, and lt) as well as the antibiotic-resistance
genes (blaTEM, blaKPC, and blaCTX). The prevalence of E. coli was 30% (n = 48)
distributed in 8 serogroups (40/48, 83.3%), while 8 isolates (8/48, 16.6%) were
untypable. Besides, 83.3% of the examined isolates were positive for CR-binding. 
The tested strains harbored the virulence genes phoA, hly, tsh, eaeA, sta, and lt
with a prevalence of 100% and 50%, 45.8%, 25%, 8.4%, and 6.2%, respectively.
Furthermore, 50% of the recovered strains were multidrug-resistant (MDR) to
penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems, and are harboring the blaTEM,
blaCTX, and blaKPC genes. Moreover, 25% of the examined strains are resistant to 
penicillins, and cephalosporins, and are harboring the blaTEM and blaCTX genes.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report concerning the E. coli
secondary bacterial infections following the FMD-outbreak. The emergence of MDR
strains is considered a public health threat and indicates complicated treatment 
and bad prognosis of infections caused by such strains. Colistin sulfate and
levofloxacin have a promising in vitro activity against MDR-E. coli.
