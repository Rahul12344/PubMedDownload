Invasive infectionsÂ caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, such as pneumonia,
meningitis, and bacteremia, are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in young
children and older adults worldwide. The introduction of pneumococcal conjugate
vaccines into national childhood immunization programs has led to large and
sustained reductions in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease across all
age groups. Here we describe the epidemiology and biostatistics of pneumococcal
disease as well as the impact of vaccination on the burden of pneumococcal
disease globally.
