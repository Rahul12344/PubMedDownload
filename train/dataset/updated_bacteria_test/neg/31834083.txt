PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Ureteral stents are necessary in the routine practice of an
urologist. Choosing the correct stent and being aware of the options available
will allow urologists to provide the best possible care for patients and value to
the healthcare system. This review seeks to educate urologists regarding
improvements in stent technology currently available or in development.
RECENT FINDINGS: Research from around the world is underway to discover an ideal 
stent - one that is comfortable for patients, resists infection and encrustation 
and is affordable for hospital systems. Stent design alterations and stent
coatings are revealing reductions in encrustation and bacterial colonization.
Biodegradable stents and magnetic stents are being tested to prevent the
discomfort of cystoscopic removal. Intraureteral stents are proving efficacious
while eliminating an irritating coil from the bladder and the symptoms associated
with it.
SUMMARY: The studies highlighted in this review provide encouraging results in
the pursuit of the ideal stent while opening discussion around new concepts and
further areas of research.
