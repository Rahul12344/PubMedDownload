The ars operon of the conjugative R-factor R773 confers resistance to arsenicals 
by coding for an anion pump for extrusion of arsenicals from cells of Escherichia
coli. Extrusion of arsenite requires only two polypeptides, the ArsA and ArsB
proteins. Purified ArsA protein exhibits oxyanion-stimulated ATPase activity and 
has been shown to bind ATP by photoaffinity labeling with [alpha-32P]ATP. From
sequence analysis the ArsA protein is predicted to have two nucleotide binding
folds, one in the N-terminal half and one in the C-terminal half of the protein. 
Purified ArsA protein bound a fluorescent ATP analogue,
2',3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenylcyclohexadienylidene)adenosine- 5'-triphosphate,
with an apparent stoichiometry of 2 mol of nucleotide per mole of ArsA. Strains
expressing plasmids with mutations in the N-terminal consensus nucleotide
sequence bound only 1 mol of nucleotide per mole of protein.
