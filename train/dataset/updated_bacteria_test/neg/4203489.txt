Cerebroside antibody inhibits sulfatide synthesis and myelination and
demyelinates in cord tissue cultures.

Fry JM, Weissbarth S, Lehrer GM, Bornstein MB.

Antiserum to cerebroside was prepared in rabbits by injection of cerebroside
together with bovine serum albumin in complete Freund's adjuvant. When applied to
cultures of embryo mouse spinal cord at explantation, this antiserum inhibited
sulfatide synthesis and myelination; when applied to myelinated cultures it
inhibited sulfatide synthesis and produced demyelination. Complement fixation
assays also show antibody to cerebroside in serums from rabbits with experimental
allergic encephalomyelitis induced by injection of whole white matter. Absorption
of such serum with cerebroside abolishes the inhibiting and demyelinating
activities.
