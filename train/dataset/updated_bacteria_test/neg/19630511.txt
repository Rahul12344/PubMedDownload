Using robotic automation, a microarray printing protocol for whole bacterial
cells was developed for subsequent label-free and nondestructive infrared
microspectroscopic detection. Using this contact microspotting system, 24
microorganisms were printed on zinc selenide slides; these were 6 species of
Listeria, 10 species of Vibrio, 2 strains of Photobacterium damselae, Yersinia
enterocolitica 289, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14529, Staphylococcus aureus, ATCC 19075
(serotype 104 B), Shigella sonnei 20143, Klebsiella pneumoniae KP73, Enterobacter
cloacae, Citrobacter freundii 200, and Escherichia coli. Microarrays consisting
of separate spots of bacterial deposits gave consistent and reproducible infrared
spectra, which were differentiated by unsupervised pattern recognition
algorithms. Two multivariate analysis algorithms, principal component analysis
and hierarchical cluster analysis, successfully separated most, but not all, the 
bacteria investigated down to the species level.
