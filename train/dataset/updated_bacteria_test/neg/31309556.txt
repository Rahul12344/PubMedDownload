Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) occurs as a malignancy of the oral cavity.
RANK ligand (RANKL) is essential for osteoclast formation/bone resorption.
Recently, we showed autoregulation of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB
ligand (RANKL) stimulates OSCC cell proliferation. OSCC cells show resistance to 
tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) treatment.
Therefore, we hypothesize that RANKL promotes resistance for TRAIL induction of
OSCC apoptotic cell death. In this study, SCC14A and SCC74A cells cultured with
TRAIL revealed high-level expression of RANKL which increased resistance to TRAIL
inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. RANKL stimulation inhibited terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling positive staining in
TRAIL-treated cells. CRISPR/Cas-9 knockout of RANKL (RANKL-KO) increased
caspase-9, caspase-3 activity and cytochrome c release in OSCC cells. RANKL
inhibited proapoptotic proteins BAD and BAX expression. TRAIL treatment
suppressed the SQSTM1/p62 and RANKL restored the expression. Interestingly, RANKL
alone significantly increased proteasome activity. RANKL-KO in OSCC cells
inhibited autophagic activity as evidenced by decreased light chain 3B-II and
beclin-1 expression. Thus, RANKL stimulation of OSCC tumor cells triggered
resistance for TRAIL-induced OSCC cell death. Taken together, blockade of RANKL
may inhibit OSCC tumor progression and enhance the potential of TRAIL induced
OSCC tumor cell apoptosis.
