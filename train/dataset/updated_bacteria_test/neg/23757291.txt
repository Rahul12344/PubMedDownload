Carbohydrates as T cell-activating antigens have been generating significant
interest. For many years, carbohydrates were thought of as T-independent
antigens, however, more recent research had demonstrated that mono- or
oligosaccharides glycosidically linked to peptides can be recognized by T cells. 
T cell recognition of these glycopeptides depends on the structure of both
peptide and glycan portions of the antigen. Subsequently, it was discovered that 
natural killer T cells recognized glycolipids when presented by the antigen
presenting molecule CD1d. A transformative insight into glycan-recognition by T
cells occurred when zwitterionic polysaccharides were discovered to bind to and
be presented by MHCII to CD4+ T cells. Based on this latter observation, the role
that carbohydrate epitopes generated from glycoconjugate vaccines had in
activating helper T cells was explored and it was found that these epitopes are
presented to specific carbohydrate recognizing T cells through a unique
mechanism. Here we review the key interactions between carbohydrate antigens and 
the adaptive immune system at the molecular, cellular and systems levels
exploring the significant biological implications in health and disease.
