We describe the properties of a 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase (EC 
3.1.4.16), found in Fusarium culmorum, which hydrolyzes nucleoside 2',3'-cyclic
monophosphates to nucleoside 3'-phosphates. In contrast with a similar enzyme
found in bacteria, the Fusarium enzyme does not exhibit nucleotidase activity and
does not show a requirement for metal ions, but is inhibited by micromolar
concentrations of Cu++ and Zn++, and is very stable to heat. This cyclic
phosphodiesterase hydrolyzes the four major nucleoside 2',3'-cyclic
monophosphates and has greater affinity for purine (Kms for Ado-2',3'-P = 0.3 mM 
and for Guo-2',3'-P = 0.1 mM) than for pyrimidine nucleotides (Kms for
Cyd-2',3'-P = 0.6 mM and for Urd-2',3'-P = 2 mM). The respective Vmax for
Urd-2',3'-P; Cyd-2',3'-P; Ado-2',3'-P; and Guo-2',3' are 100:45:16:5. The
efficacy of the phosphodiesterase to hydrolyze the four major 2',3' cyclic
nucleotides (based on the relative values of Vmax/Km) is not significantly
different. The Fusarium enzyme differs from a previously described 2',3' cyclic
phosphodiesterase from Neurospora, in that it is inactive on 3',5'-nucleoside
monophosphates and nucleoside 2' or 3' phosphates.
