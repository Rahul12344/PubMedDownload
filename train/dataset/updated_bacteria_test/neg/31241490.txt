OBJECTIVE: Infections with Borrelia burgdorferi can cause Lyme disease with
multiorganic involvement such as (myo)carditis or joint manifestations.
Musculoskeletal complaints possibly mimicking some of these symptoms are common
among elite athletes. This study aimed to determine seroprevalence and incidence 
of B. burgdorferi antibodies in professional football players.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
SETTING: Healthy professional football players.
PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred thirty-five men in the first and second German league.
INTERVENTIONS: Two screening assays were used to examine immunoglobulin M (IgM)
and immunoglobulin G (IgG) against B. burgdorferi: an enzyme immunoassay (EIA)
and a chemiluminescence assay (CLIA). In case of a positive or equivocal result, 
an immunoblot including in vivo antigens was performed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Course of IgM and IgG against B. burgdorferi in overall
1529 blood samples.
RESULTS: A total of 96.4% of all results were concordant between EIA and CLIA.
Considering only samples with identical results in both assays, prevalence was
1.6%. A positive IgM was detected in 2.3%. No player showed any symptoms of Lyme 
disease. A seroconversion to IgG was not found. Three players developed a
positive IgM corresponding to an incidence of 1032/100 000 person-years.
Depending on the assay, 49% to 75% of positive or equivocal screening results
could not be confirmed by immunoblot.
CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence and incidence of B. burgdorferi among healthy male
professional football players are low. Therefore, infections with B. burgdorferi 
have to be regarded a rare differential diagnosis in professional football in
Central Europe. The low confirmation rate of positive screening assays points to 
an unspecific immune activation.
