The ELR(+) CXC chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2 are up-regulated in the central nervous
system (CNS) during multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, their functional significance and
the pathways regulating their expression are largely unknown. We show that
transfer of encephalitogenic CD4(+) Th17 cells is sufficient to induce CXCL1 and 
CXCL2 transcription in the spinal cords of naive, syngeneic recipients. Blockade 
or genetic silencing of CXCR2, a major receptor for these chemokines in mice,
abrogates blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, CNS infiltration by leukocytes,
and the development of clinical deficits during the presentation as well as
relapses of EAE. Depletion of circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) had 
a similar therapeutic effect. Furthermore, injection of CXCR2(+) PMN into
CXCR2(-/-) mice was sufficient to restore susceptibility to EAE. Our findings
reveal that a Th17-ELR(+) CXC chemokine pathway is critical for granulocyte
mobilization, BBB compromise, and the clinical manifestation of autoimmune
demyelination in myelin peptide-sensitized mice, and suggest new therapeutic
targets for diseases such as MS.
