BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a novel
subset of innate-like T-cells that are enriched in mucosal tissues. Their
presence in human skin has only recently been recognised. We describe the
expression of skin-tropic molecules on human skin MAIT cells at steady state and 
investigate their contribution to various dermatoses with known T-cell
involvement.
METHODS: To examine the expression of skin-tropic molecules by MAIT cells at
steady state, we performed a flow cytometric analysis of blood and skin samples
from healthy donors. To investigate any potential wider contribution of MAIT
cells to skin disease, we examined psoriasis, alopecia areata and dermatitis
herpetiformis biopsies using immunofluorescent staining to identify the
proportion of T-cells expressing MAIT cell surface markers.
RESULTS: We found that MAIT cells constituted a small population of T-cells in
normal human skin, similar to the percentage found in peripheral blood. Like
other skin T-cells, skin MAIT cells expressed high levels of the skin-associated 
markers, cutaneous lymphocyte antigen and CD103. In psoriasis and alopecia areata
the proportion of MAIT cells was similar to that found in normal skin, but in
dermatitis herpetiformis it was significantly elevated.
CONCLUSIONS: The expression of skin-tropic molecules by skin MAIT cells is
consistent with their resident status in normal human skin. Our results suggest
that MAIT cells may play a role in the pathogenesis of dermatitis herpetiformis.
