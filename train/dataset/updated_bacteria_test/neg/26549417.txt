This study aimed to investigate the effects of harmine hydrochloride (HMH) on
digestive tumor cells in vitro and its molecular mechanism. MTT assays showed
that HMH inhibited the proliferation of some human cancer cell lines and had no
obvious inhibitory effects on human LO2 cells. Flow cytometry assays showed that 
HMH trigged G2 phase arrest in MGC-803 cells and SMMC-7721 cells, while the
expression of cyclin A, cyclin B, p21, Myt1, and p-cdc2 (Tyr15) was upregulated. 
Flow cytometry assays also showed that the percentages of apoptotic cells were
increased, the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) decreased, and the
cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3, and poly (Adenosine diphosphate ribose)
polymerase (PARP) were observed, the expression of Bad increased, phospho-Bad
(S112) decreased, pro-caspase-8 was cleaved, and Bid (22 kDa) was cleaved. The
expression of p-ERK decreased in both cells. In conclusion, these results
demonstrated that HMH upregulates the expression of p21, activates Myt1 and
inhibits cdc2 by phospho-cdc2 (Y15), and triggers G2 phase arrest in both MGC-803
cells and SMMC-7721 cells. It can also activate the mitochondria-related cell
apoptosis pathway through the caspase-8/Bid pathway, inhibiting the ERK/Bad
pathway and promoting apoptosis in both of these two cell types.
