Since cytochromes P450 are external monooxygenases, available surrogate redox
partners have been used to reconstitute the P450 activity. However, the effect of
various ratios of P450s and the redox proteins have not been extensively studied 
so far, although different combinations of the redox partners have shown
variations in substrate conversion. To address this issue, CYP260A1 was
reconstituted with various ratios of adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase to
convert 11-deoxycorticosterone, and the products were characterized by NMR. We
show the effect of the available redox protein ratios not only on the P450
catalytic activity but also on the product pattern.
