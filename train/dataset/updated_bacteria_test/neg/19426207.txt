In Escherichia coli, the largest class of small regulatory RNAs binds to the RNA 
chaperone Hfq and regulates the stability and/or translation of specific mRNAs.
While recent studies have shown that some mRNAs could be subject to
post-transcriptional regulation by sRNAs (e.g. mRNAs found by
co-immunoprecipitation with Hfq), no method has yet been described to identify
small RNAs that regulate them. We developed a method to easily make translational
fusions of genes of interest to the lacZ reporter gene, under the control of a
P(BAD)-inducible promoter. A multicopy plasmid library of the E. coli genome can 
then be used to screen for small RNAs that affect the activity of the fusion.
This screening method was first applied to the dpiB gene from the dpiBA operon,
which encodes a two-component signal transduction system involved in the SOS
response to beta-lactams. One small RNA, RybC, was found to negatively regulate
the expression of dpiB. Using mutants in the dpiB-lacZ fusion and compensatory
mutations in the RybC sRNA, we demonstrate that RybC directly base pairs with the
dpiBA mRNA.
