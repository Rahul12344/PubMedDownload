AIM: To evaluate the caries prevalence and related variables in Type 1 diabetic
and non-diabetic children and among the diabetic children according to their
metabolic status.
METHODS: Sixty-eight diabetic and 136 non-diabetic children, matching by gender
and age (4-14 years) were enrolled. The diabetic children were divided: a) 20
children in good metabolic control (Hb1ac≤7.5) and b) 48 children in bad
metabolic control (Hb1ac>7.5). Dietary and oral hygiene habits were investigated.
Caries status was registered using the International Caries Detection and
Assessment System. Oral microflora was analysed using the checkerboard DNA-DNA
hybridisation method. Plaque acidogenicity was recorded after a sucrose rinse.
RESULTS: Sugared beverage and snack intake was higher in diabetic group compared 
to non-diabetic group (p = 0.03 and p = 0.04, respectively) and in subjects in
bad metabolic control (p = 0.03 and p<0.01, respectively). Oral hygiene habits
were similar, except for the use of fluoridated adjuvants, higher in non-diabetic
children (p = 0.04). No statistically significant differences were observed
regarding caries figures, but a higher number of caries free subjects was found
in diabetic subjects in good metabolic control (p<0.01). Significant difference
for the main cariogenic bacteria was found between diabetic and non-diabetic
subjects (p<0.05). The pH values showed statistically significant differences
between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects and between diabetic subjects in good 
and bad metabolic control (p<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic children in good metabolic control might even be considered
at low caries risk, while those in bad metabolic control showed an oral
environment prone to a high caries risk.
