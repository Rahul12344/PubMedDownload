AIMS: This study was focused on the identification of associated outer membrane
proteins which may play a role in the specific interactions between
Flavobacterium psychrophilum (the aetiological agent of cold-water disease and
rainbow trout fry syndrome in salmonid fish worldwide) and the fish tissues.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The surface protein interactions with the outer membrane
being mainly ionic, different methods were used for the detachment of proteins
from the cell surface of Fl. psychrophilum involving detergent-free buffers or
solutions known to perturb the ionic interactions. Such treatments led to the
isolation of a surface protein, named P18 in accordance with its relative
molecular mass. The expression of P18 was not related to the growth conditions
(liquid or solid medium, temperature and aeration) or the strains of Fl.
psychrophilum tested here.
CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary characterization indicated that P18 is a surface antigen
which is not sugar-modified and might be a subunit of a surface layer (i.e.
S-layer), one of the most common surface structures on bacteria.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Data reported here should be used as the
basis for further works involving the purification and characterization of P18 to
identify the specific roles of such a surface protein, especially the interaction
between this protein and the host surface.
