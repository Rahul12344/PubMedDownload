Unbalanced phospholipid composition due to depletion of the major phospholipid of
Escherichia coli, phosphatidylethanolamine, was shown previously to significantly
decrease the secretion and transcriptional expression of periplasmic alkaline
phosphatase of this bacterium. The current work studies the effect of this
unbalance on posttranslocational proteolytic modification of the enzyme,
proceeding in the periplasm with the formation of its isoforms. It has been
revealed that under phosphatidylethanolamine depletion the content of
incompletely modified (intermediate) isoforms I and II increases. This increase
does not depend on the level of enzyme synthesis and the mechanism of its
regulation (expression of the chromosomal gene or the gene cloned in plasmid
under the control of the endogenous promoter P(PHO) or exogenous promoter
P(BAD)). Depression of posttranslocational modification of alkaline phosphatase
in phosphatidylethanolamine-depleted cells is supposed to be a result of the
lower efficiency of secretion of modifying proteinase (product of the iap gene)
localized, like alkaline phosphatase, in the periplasm of Escherichia coli.
