Expression of recombinant proteins across a range of different host organisms is 
often necessary in metabolic engineering applications. Doing so can be
facilitated by the use of vectors having origins of replication with a
broad-host-range, the option for antibiotic resistance cassettes that are
compatible with a particular host, in addition to sequences allowing for the
effective transcription and translation of target proteins. We have created a
modular set of broad-host-range expression vectors for protein expression in Gram
negative bacteria. These vectors use the broad-host-range pBBR1 replicon as well 
as the arabinose-inducible P(BAD) promoter and are available with six different
antibiotic resistance cassettes. We have demonstrated the use of these vectors in
Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Burkholderia cepacia.
