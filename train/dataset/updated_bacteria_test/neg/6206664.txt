[Relation between the O:K:H serotype and the fimbria antigen in E. coli of
urinary tract infections].

[Article in German]

Nimmich W, Zingler G.

Following introductory remarks on the typing antigens of E. coli and the relation
between O:K:H serotypes and urinary tract infections (UTI), the importance of
fimbriae as adhesive factors for the pathogenesis of UTI is pointed out. Our own 
results on the haemagglutination (HA) patterns and the establishing of fimbrial
(F) antigens in E. coli strains from patients with UTI are presented. 42 O1:K2
strains were examined for the presence of F-antigens using crossed
immunoelectrophoresis. In 31 strains with mannose-resistant HA from human and
monkey erythrocytes this characteristically correlated with the presence of
F-antigen. A close relation between O:K:H serotypes and F-antigen was found. In
twelve O1:K1:H7 strains and five immobile variants of this serotype we succeeded 
in identifying the F11 antigen. 14 strains of the serotype O1:K1:H- had the F9
antigen. It is assumed that O1:K1:H7:F11 (incl. O1:K1:H-:F11-) strains and
O:1:K1:H-:F9 isolates are derived from different clones.
