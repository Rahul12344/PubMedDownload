The mortality of acute bacterial meningitis (BM) has remained stable in the last 
decades in spite of the use of new antibiotics, probably due to vascular
complications. We report a 68-year-old woman with BM who had a malignant
infarction of left middle cerebral artery territory 72 hours after admission to
the hospital. The patient experienced a bad evolution and died four days after
admission. The arterial involvement in patients with BM is explained by vasospasm
of large arteries and vasculitis of small arteries. The medical treatment of a
malignant middle cerebral artery infarct has a high mortality.
