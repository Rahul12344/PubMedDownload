Outbreaks of infections by Mycobacterium abscessus, particularly subspecies
massiliense, are increasingly reported worldwide. Several multilocus sequence
typing (MLST) protocols for grouping international outbreak strains have been
developed but not yet directly compared. Using the three-gene (hsp65, rpoB, and
secA1), seven-gene (argH, cya, glpK, gnd, murC, pta, and purH) and thirteen-gene 
(all of the preceding genes plus gdhA, pgm, and pknA) MLST schemes, we identified
22, 38, and 40 unique sequence types (STs), respectively, among a total of 139
nonduplicated M. abscessus isolates. Among subspecies massiliense, three-gene
MLST not only clustered all outbreak strains together (in 100% agreement with the
seven-gene and thirteen-gene schemes), but it also distinguished between two new 
STs that would have been grouped together by the seven-gene MLST but were
distinct by the thirteen-gene MLST owing to differences in hsp65, rpoB, and pknA 
Here, we show that an abbreviated MLST may be useful for simultaneous
identification of M. abscessus the subspecies level and screening M. abscessus
subsp. massiliense isolates with outbreak potential.
