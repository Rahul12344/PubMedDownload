Salivary diagnostics is now entering the surgery of the modern dentist, although 
no test yet available is so specific and sensitive that caries can be diagnosed
from saliva samples only. The present tests are useful for estimating the caries 
activity due to bad dietary habits (salivary lactobacilli), establishing the
presence of infection (salivary mutans streptococci), and identification of
salivary yeasts for the determination of the medical condition of the patient.
Buffer capacity reveals the most important host response factor acting against
caries, while measures of flow rate form the diagnostic basis for treatment
planning. These tests, alone or in combination, are now so easy to perform that
they should be used in every dental practice.
