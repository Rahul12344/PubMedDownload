Adenosylcobalamin (Ado-B12) is both the cofactor and inducer of ethanolamine
ammonia lyase (EA-lyase), a catabolic enzyme for ethanolamine. De novo synthesis 
of Ado-B12 by Salmonella enterica occurs only under anaerobic conditions.
Therefore, aerobic growth on ethanolamine requires import of Ado-B12 or a
precursor (CN-B12 or OH-B12) that can be adenosylated internally. Several known
enzymes adenosylate corrinoids. The CobA enzyme transfers adenosine from ATP to a
biosynthetic intermediate in de novo B12 synthesis and to imported CN-B12,
OH-B12, or Cbi (a B12 precursor). The PduO adenosyl transferase is encoded in an 
operon (pdu) for cobalamin-dependent propanediol degradation and is induced by
propanediol. Evidence is presented here that a third transferase (EutT) is
encoded within the operon for ethanolamine utilization (eut). Surprisingly, these
three transferases share no apparent sequence similarity. CobA produces
sufficient Ado-B12 to initiate eut operon induction and to serve as a cofactor
for EA-lyase when B12 levels are high. Once the eut operon is induced, the EutT
transferase supplies more Ado-B12 during the period of high demand. Another
protein encoded in the operon (EutA) protects EA-lyase from inhibition by CN-B12 
but does so without adenosylation of this corrinoid.
