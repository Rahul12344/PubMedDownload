pC101, a novel shuttle vector between Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus 
carrying the lux genes encoding luciferase from Vibrio harveyi, selectable
ampicillin and chloramphenicol markers and origins of replication for
Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria has been constructed. The inducibility
of the arsenic and cadmium operon from S. aureus plasmid pI258 to different ions 
has been tested in E. coli and in S. aureus with two fusions in pC101: an
arsB-luxAB and a cadA-luxAB transcriptional gene fusion. Patterns of induction
are influenced by the host strain and are slightly different from previous
reports using the blaZ gene as reporter gene.
