Actinomycete-like organisms in cervicovaginal smears.

Fry R, Linder AM, Bull MM.

The prevalence of organisms resembling actinomycetes in cervicovaginal smears in 
women wearing an intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) was analysed
prospectively in a screened private patient population with regard to the type of
device used. The overall prevalence was 1,69%, with the greatest prevalence of
11,76% observed in Dalkon shield wearers. The significance of finding
actinomycete-like organisms in smears is discussed in relation to the recent
reports implicating the genus Actinomyces as a pathogen in some cases of pelvic
infection in IUCD users.
