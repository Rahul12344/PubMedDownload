The role of neutrophils in severe sepsis.

Alves-Filho JC, de Freitas A, Spiller F, Souto FO, Cunha FQ.

Neutrophils are key effectors of the innate immune response. Reduction of
neutrophil migration to infection sites is associated with a poor outcome in
sepsis. We have demonstrated a failure of neutrophil migration in lethal sepsis. 
Together with this failure, we observed more bacteria in both peritoneal exudates
and blood, followed by a reduction in survival rate. Furthermore, neutrophils
obtained from severe septic patients displayed a marked reduction in chemotactic 
response compared with neutrophils from healthy subjects. The mechanisms of
neutrophil migration failure are not completely understood. However, it is known 
that they involve systemic Toll-like receptor activation by bacteria and/or their
products and result in excessive levels of circulating cytokines/chemokines.
These mediators acting together with LPS stimulate expression of iNOS that
produces high amounts of NO, which in turn mediates the failure of neutrophil
migration. NO reduced expression of CXCR2 on neutrophils and the levels of
adhesion molecules on both endothelial cells and neutrophils. These events
culminate in decreased endothelium-leukocyte interactions, diminished neutrophil 
chemotactic response, and neutrophil migration failure. Additionally, the NO
effect, at least in part, is mediated by peroxynitrite. In this review, we
summarize what is known regarding the mechanisms of neutrophil migration
impairment in severe sepsis.
