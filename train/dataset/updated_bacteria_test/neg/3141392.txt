A full-length cDNA clone for mouse N-acetylglucosamine (beta
1-4)galactosyltransferase (beta 1-4GT) [EC 2.4.1.90] and several clones diverged 
from the beta 1-4GT cDNA were isolated from a mouse F9 cDNA library and then
sequenced. The beta 1-4GT cDNA has an open reading frame consisting of 399 amino 
acids. The homology at the amino acid level is 80 and 91% as to the partial
sequences of bovine and human milk beta 1-4GT, respectively. The general enzyme
structure of the beta 1-4GT seems to be similar to that of a rat beta-galactoside
(alpha 2-6) sialyltransferase. Junctions of the common and divergent regions of
cDNA have dinucleotides, AG, suggesting that the variety of cDNA clones is
generated through alternative splicing.
