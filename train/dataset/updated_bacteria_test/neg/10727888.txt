For the efficient surface presentation and release of virulence factors
especially pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria have developed several distinct
secretion mechanisms. An increasing number of pathogens in various species
employs a mechanism denoted the 'autotransporter' pathway. This pathway is
characterised by an outer membrane translocator module representing the
C-terminal domain of the transported protein itself. An intriguing potential
application of such systems involves the transport and surface expression of
recombinant proteins or peptides, like e.g. the presentation of antigens for the 
generation of live oral vectors as vaccine carriers. Here we report on the
incorporation of heterologous (poly-) peptides in permissive sites of the
translocator module of the adhesin-involved-in-diffuse-adherence (AIDA)
autotransporter system. We demonstrate the presentation of the B subunit of the
heat labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli (LTB) as well as of functional T-cell
epitopes of Yersinia enterocolitica heat-shock protein 60 (Y-hsp60) on the
surface of E. coli.
