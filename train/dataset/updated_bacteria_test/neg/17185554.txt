In Campylobacter jejuni, an htrB homologous gene is located in the
lipo-oligosaccharide synthesis gene cluster. This study examined the effects of
htrB expression on the responsiveness of Salmonella typhimurium and C. jejuni to 
harsh environments. Complementation experiments showed that the C. jejuni htrB
gene could restore the normal morphology of the Salmonella htrB mutant, and its
ability to grow without inhibition under heat, acid and osmotic stresses, but not
bile stress. This indicated that the htrB genes in C. jejuni and S. typhimurium
exhibit similar pleiotropic effects. Moreover, quantitative real-time RT-PCR
showed that expression of the C. jejuni htrB gene was upregulated under acid,
heat, oxidative and osmotic stresses, but did not change under bile stress. This 
indicated that the C. jejuni htrB gene plays a role in regulating cell responses 
to various environmental changes. Furthermore, deletion mutation of the htrB gene
in C. jejuni was lethal, indicating that the htrB gene is essential for C. jejuni
survival. Therefore, these results showed that expression of the htrB gene is
essential for the response of S. typhimurium and C. jejuni to environmental
stresses.
