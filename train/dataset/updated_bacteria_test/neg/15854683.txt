Two toll-like receptors (TLR3 and TLR5) were identified from a catfish cDNA fry
library based on sequence similarity to other vertebrate TLR genes. Expression
(using real-time PCR) of TLR3 and TLR5 was measured for two strains of channel
catfish in previously non-exposed fish 2, 5, 8, and 21 days after experimental
Edwardsiella ictaluri challenge to determine if TLRs are associated with host
response to E. ictaluri infection. Expression of TLR5 was higher than TLR3
(P<0.0001). TLR3 expression in kidney was elevated in Norris strain (P=0.480) and
differed over time in spleen (P=0.0134). Fold induction of TLR5 compared to
non-exposed fish increased on days 5 (Norris; 154.72+/-62.12 fold induction) and 
8 (USDA103; 164.65+/-50.56) post-exposure in liver and was slightly increased on 
day 5 (Norris; 10.17+/-24.73, USDA103; 42.56+/-24.73) in kidney. Upregulation of 
TLR3 suggests a more widespread function in primitive fish. TLR5 was highly
expressed in liver tissue, which may be due to macrophage aggregation during ESC 
infection. This suggests that toll-like receptors are an important component of
the innate immune system of catfish.
