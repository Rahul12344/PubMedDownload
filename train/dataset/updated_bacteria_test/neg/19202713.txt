Aerococcus urinae is a rarely reported pathogen, possibly due to difficulties in 
the identification of the organism. Only sixteen cases of A. urinae endocarditis 
have yet been described. Generally, patients were males with predisposing
conditions and the outcomes were bad. We describe the first Belgian case of
endocarditis due to A. urinae. Which occurred to a 79-year-old female patient.
The diagnostic of A. urinae endocarditis was based on the cardiac ultrasonography
and the isolation of the bacteria in 6/7 pairs of blood culture. The patient has 
been successfully treated by a long course of intravenous antibiotics (38 days)
and surgery (aortic valve replacement by bioprothesis). We review the 14 cases
published in the English literature and discuss the best clinical management of
this type of endocarditis.
