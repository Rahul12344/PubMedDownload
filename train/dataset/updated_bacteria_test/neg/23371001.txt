OBJECTIVE: The goal of conservative treatment of fingertip defects is to restore 
a stable and bulky pulp with recovery of sensitivity and a good skin quality.
INDICATIONS: Traumatic defects of the fingertip with or without involvement of
the fingernail and/or exposed distal phalanx.
CONTRAINDICATIONS: Fractures of the distal phalanx with dislocation or joint
involvement, necessitating an osteosynthesis. Allergy to any component of the
dressing material. DRESSING TECHNIQUE: Application of a semiocclusive film
dressing (polyurethane, bacteria- and waterproof, water vapor permeable). If
necessary, debridement of necrotic tissue can precede the first film application.
Until complete epithelialization of the defect, the dressing needs to be changed 
not more than once a week. Thereby, the wound itself must be kept untouched.
FURTHER MANAGEMENT: Patients must be encouraged to move all finger joints with
the applied dressing. After healing, the new skin is initially protected during
heavy loading and shear stress, e.g., by a leather finger glove.
RESULTS: Based on the method of Mennen and Wiese [3], 200 fingertip injuries
(some having involvement of the fingernail or exposed distal phalanx) healed
within 20-30 days. The pulp was bulky remodeled with good skin quality including 
the "fingerprint", as well as nearly normal sensitivity. Using this method, Quell
et al. [5] reported on 42 fingertip injuries healed within 2-6 weeks. All fingers
could be used without limitation; these were free of pain, with remodeled
"fingerprint" and barely visible scars, regular perspiration and restored
sensitivity (two-point discrimination 2-8 mm).
