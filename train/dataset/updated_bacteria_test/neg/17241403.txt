The bacterial pathogen Flavobacterium psychrophilum was successfully identified
from formalin-fixed, wax-embedded tissue blocks of infected rainbow trout heart
and spleen tissues, using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay.
Filamentous bacteria were observed in haematoxylin and eosin and Giemsa-stained
sections but no bacteria were recovered from the diseased fish using standard
bacteriology isolation techniques. All infected fish had histopathological
evidence of myocarditis or rainbow trout fry syndrome. Immunohistochemistry was
attempted using three different anti-F. psychrophilum sera but the results were
inconclusive, and an alternative molecular approach was therefore attempted. This
paper describes the use of a PCR-based assay to help identify bacteria present in
formalin-fixed, wax-embedded tissue samples. This is the first time that this
technique has been used for the detection of fish bacteria from diagnostic
samples.
