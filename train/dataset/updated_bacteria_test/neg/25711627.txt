Hosts strongly influence parasite fitness. However, it is challenging to
disentangle host effects on genetic vs plasticity-driven traits of parasites,
since parasites can evolve quickly. It remains especially difficult to determine 
the causes and magnitude of parasite plasticity. In successive generations,
parasites may respond plastically to better infect their current type of host, or
hosts may produce generally 'good' or 'bad' quality parasites. Here, we
characterized parasite plasticity by taking advantage of a system in which the
parasite (the yeast Metschnikowia bicuspidata, which infects Daphnia) has no
detectable heritable variation, preventing rapid evolution. In experimental
infection assays, we found an effect of rearing host genotype on parasite
infectivity, where host genotypes produced overall high or low quality parasite
spores. Additionally, these plastically induced differences were gained or lost
in just a single host generation. Together, these results demonstrate phenotypic 
plasticity in infectivity driven by the within-host rearing environment. Such
plasticity is rarely investigated in parasites, but could shape epidemiologically
important traits.
