Topoisomerase I (Top1) resolves torsional stress that accumulates during
transcription, replication and chromatin remodeling by introducing a transient
single-strand break in DNA. The cleavage activity of Top1 has opposing roles,
either promoting or destabilizing genome integrity depending on the context.
Resolution of transcription-associated negative supercoils, for example, prevents
pairing of the nascent RNA with the DNA template (R-loops) as well as DNA
secondary structure formation. Reduced Top1 levels thus enhance CAG repeat
contraction, somatic hypermutation, and class switch recombination. Actively
transcribed ribosomal DNA is also destabilized in the absence of Top1, reflecting
the importance of Top1 in ensuring efficient transcription. In terms of promoting
genome instability, an aborted Top1 catalytic cycle stimulates deletions at short
tandem repeats and the enzyme's transesterification activity supports
illegitimate recombination. Finally, Top1 incision at ribonucleotides embedded in
DNA generates deletions in tandem repeats, and induces gross chromosomal
rearrangements and mitotic recombination.
