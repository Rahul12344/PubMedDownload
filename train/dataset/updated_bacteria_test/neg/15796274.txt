OBJECTIVE: We describe an effort to reduce transmission of a multidrug-resistant 
Streptococcus pneumoniae (MDRSP) in a long-term-care facility (LTCF).
DESIGN: Longitudinal cross-sectional study.
SETTING: An LTCF in New York City with ongoing disease due to an MDRSP strain
among residents with AIDS since a 1995 outbreak. The MDRSP outbreak strain was
susceptible to vancomycin but not to other antimicrobials tested, including
fluoroquinolones.
PARTICIPANTS: Residents and staff members of the LTCF during 1999 through 2001.
INTERVENTION: Implementing standard infection control measures, and developing
and implementing "enhanced standard" infection control measures, modified
respiratory droplet prevention measures to reduce inter-resident transmission.
RESULTS: Before the intervention, nasopharyngeal carriage of the MDRSP outbreak
strain was detected in residents with AIDS and residents with tracheostomies who 
were not dependent on mechanical ventilation. The prevalence of nasopharyngeal
carriage of the MDRSP outbreak strain was 7.8% among residents who had AIDS and
14.6% among residents with tracheostomies. After training sessions on standard
and enhanced standard infection control measures, the staff appeared to have good
knowledge and practice of the infection control measures. After the intervention,
new transmission among residents with tracheostomies was prevented; however,
these residents were prone to persistent tracheal carriage and needed ongoing
enhanced standard infection control measures. Ongoing transmission among
residents with AIDS, a socially active group, was documented, although fewer
cases of disease due to the outbreak strain occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: Infection control contributed to less transmission of MDRSP in the
LTCE Additional strategies are needed to reduce transmission and carriage among
certain resident populations.
