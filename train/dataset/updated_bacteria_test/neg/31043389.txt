Prenatal exposure to various stressors can influence both early and later life
childhood health. Microbial infection of the intrauterine environment,
specifically within the placenta, has been associated with deleterious birth
outcomes, such as preterm birth, as well as adverse neurological outcomes later
in life. The relationships among microorganisms in the placenta, placental
function, and fetal development are not well understood. Microorganisms have been
associated with perinatal inflammatory responses that have the potential for
disrupting fetal brain development. Microbial presence has also been associated
with epigenetic modifications in the placenta, as well other tissues. Here we
review research detailing the presence of microorganisms in the placenta and
associations among such microorganisms, placental DNA methylation, perinatal
inflammation, and neurodevelopmental outcomes.
