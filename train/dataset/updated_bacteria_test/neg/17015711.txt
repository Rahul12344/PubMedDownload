Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is mediated by Th1 immune response. NKT cells
regulate immune responses by modulating the Th1/Th2 balance. Therefore, we
postulated that NKT cells play a critical role in the development of the HP by
modulating the Th1/Th2 response. To address this issue, we explored the
functional roles of NKT cells in Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula (SR)-induced HP. 
In CD1d(-/-) mice, the HP was worse in terms of histological changes,
hydroxyproline levels, the CD4:CD8 ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and
SR-specific immune responses than in control mice. CD1d(-/-) mice showed elevated
IFN-gamma production in the lung during the HP, and this was produced mainly by
Gr-1+ neutrophils. The blockade of IFN-gamma in CD1d(-/-) mice attenuated the HP,
whereas the injection of rIFN-gamma aggravated it. Moreover, the depletion of
Gr-1+ neutrophils reduced CD8+ T cell numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
during the HP. The adoptive transfer of IL-4(-/-) mouse NKT cells did not
attenuate the HP, whereas wild-type or IFN-gamma(-/-) mouse NKT cells suppressed 
the HP. In conclusion, NKT cells producing IL-4 play a protective role in
SR-induced HP by suppressing IFN-gamma-producing neutrophils, which induce the
activation and proliferation of CD8+ T cells in the lung.
