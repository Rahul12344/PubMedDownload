Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is the major pathogen responsible for
neonatal diarrhea, postweaning diarrhea, and edema disease in pigs. Although it
can be harmless, ETEC is also present in the intestines of other animal species
and humans, causing occasional diarrhea outbreaks. The evaluation of this
pathogen's presence in food sources is becoming an increasingly important issue
in human health. In order to determine the prevalence of ETEC in nondiarrheic
pigs, 990 animals from 11 pig farms were sampled. Using end-time polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), eltA, estI genes, or both, were detected in 150 (15.2%) animals. 
From the positive samples, 40 (26.6%) ETEC strains were isolated, showing 19
antibiotic-resistance patterns; 52.5% of these strains had multiple antibiotic
resistances, and 17.5% carried the intI2 gene. The most prevalent genotypes were 
rfb(O157)/estII/aidA (32.5%) and estI/estII (25.0%). The estII gene was
identified most frequently (97.5%), followed by estI (37.5%), astA (20.0%), and
eltA (12.5%). The genes coding the fimbriae F5, F6, and F18 were detected in
three single isolates. The aidA gene was detected in 20 ETEC strains associated
with the estII gene. Among the isolated ETEC strains, stx(2e)/estI,
stx(2e)/estI/estII, and stx(2e)/estI/estII/intI2 genotypes were identified. The
ETEC belonged to 12 different serogroups; 37.5% of them belonged to serotype
O157:H19. Isolates were grouped by enterobacterial repetitive intergenic
consensus-PCR into 5 clusters with 100.0% similarity. In this study, we
demonstrated that numerous ETEC genotypes cohabit and circulate in swine
populations without clinical manifestation of neonatal diarrhea, postweaning
diarrhea, or edema disease in different production stages. The information
generated is important not only for diagnostic and epidemiological purposes, but 
also for understanding the dynamics and ecology of ETEC in pigs in different
production stages that can be potentially transmitted to humans from food
animals.
