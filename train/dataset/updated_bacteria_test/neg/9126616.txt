The gene encoding the small subunit of the arginine-specific carbamoyl phosphate 
synthetase, ARG2, of Magnaporthe grisea was characterized to examine the basic
regulation of biosynthetic genes in this plant pathogen. The transcript of the
ARG2 gene contains an upstream open reading frame (uORF) that is similar to uORFs
found in the homologous genes of Neurospora crassa (arg-2) and Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (CPA1), suggesting that the M. grisea gene is translationally
regulated by a mechanism that is conserved in these fungi. Amino acid imbalance
leads to elevated levels of ARG2 mRNA, indicating that in addition to
translational control, ARG2 is subject to cross-pathway transcriptional control. 
A DNA-binding activity that has properties similar to those of the global
transcriptional regulator mediating cross-pathway control in N. crassa was
detected in M. grisea cell extracts. Thus, it appears that both specific
regulation of ARG2 by arginine and global regulation of amino acid biosynthesis
are present in M. grisea and highly conserved among M. grisea, N. crassa, and S. 
cerevisiae.
