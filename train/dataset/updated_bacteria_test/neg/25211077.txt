Autotransporters deliver virulence factors to the bacterial surface by
translocating an effector passenger domain through a membrane-anchored barrel
structure. Although passenger domains are diverse, those found in enteric
bacteria autotransporters, including AIDA-I in diffusely adhering Escherichia
coli (DAEC) and TibA in enterotoxigenic E. coli, are commonly glycosylated. We
show that AIDA-I is heptosylated within the bacterial cytoplasm by
autotransporter adhesin heptosyltransferase (AAH) and its paralogue AAH2. AIDA-I 
heptosylation determines DAEC adhesion to host cells. AAH/AAH2 define a bacterial
autotransporter heptosyltransferase (BAHT) family that contains ferric ion and
adopts a dodecamer assembly. Structural analyses of the heptosylated TibA
passenger domain reveal 35 heptose conjugates forming patterned and solenoid-like
arrays on the surface of a β helix. Additionally, CARC, the AIDA-like
autotransporter from Citrobacter rodentium, is essential for colonization in mice
and requires heptosylation by its cognate BAHT. Our study establishes a bacterial
glycosylation system that regulates virulence and is essential for pathogenesis.
