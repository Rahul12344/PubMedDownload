Biochar-based compound fertilizers (BCF) and amendments have proven to enhance
crop yields and modify soil properties (pH, nutrients, organic matter, structure 
etc.) and are now in commercial production in China. While there is a good
understanding of the changes in soil properties following biochar addition, the
interactions within the rhizosphere remain largely unstudied, with benefits to
yield observed beyond the changes in soil properties alone. We investigated the
rhizosphere interactions following the addition of an activated wheat straw BCF
at an application rates of 0.25% (g·g-1 soil), which could potentially explain
the increase of plant biomass (by 67%), herbage N (by 40%) and P (by 46%) uptake 
in the rice plants grown in the BCF-treated soil, compared to the rice plants
grown in the soil with conventional fertilizer alone. Examination of the roots
revealed that micron and submicron-sized biochar were embedded in the plaque
layer. BCF increased soil Eh by 85 mV and increased the potential difference
between the rhizosphere soil and the root membrane by 65 mV. This increased
potential difference lowered the free energy required for root nutrient
accumulation, potentially explaining greater plant nutrient content and biomass. 
We also demonstrate an increased abundance of plant-growth promoting bacteria and
fungi in the rhizosphere. We suggest that the redox properties of the biochar
cause major changes in electron status of rhizosphere soils that drive the
observed agronomic benefits.
