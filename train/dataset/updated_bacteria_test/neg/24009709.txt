CD1d molecules are structurally similar to MHC class I, but present lipid
antigens as opposed to peptides. Here, we show that MHC class I molecules
physically associate with (and regulate the functional expression of) mouse CD1d 
on the surface of cells. Low pH (3.0) acid stripping of MHC class I molecules
resulted in increased surface expression of murine CD1d on antigen presenting
cells as well as augmented CD1d-mediated antigen presentation to NKT cells.
Consistent with the above results, TAP1-/- mice were found to have a higher
percentage of type I NKT cells as compared to wild type mice. Moreover, bone
marrow-derived dendritic cells from TAP1-/- mice showed increased antigen
presentation by CD1d compared to wild type mice. Together, these results suggest 
that MHC class I molecules can regulate NKT cell function, in part, by masking
CD1d.
