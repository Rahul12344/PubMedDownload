[Localization of antigens in common (cross-reacting) with Neisseria perflava and 
Klebsiella pneumoniae in the tissues of the human bronchopulmonary tract].

[Article in Russian]

Ado AD, Fedoseeva VN.

An attempt was made of detecting antigenic similarity beyween the fraction of
microsomes of the tissues of human broncho-pulmonary apparatus and the cells of
microbes of human respiratory tract. Cross reactions of antimocrosomal sera were 
studied in the complement fixation test with Neisseria perflava and Klebsiella
pneumoniae. Fixation of antibacterial antibodies and antibodies against the
microsomal fraction of the lung tissues was studied on the sections of the lung
tissues ahd human bronchi. The presence in the microsomal fraction of tissues of 
human bronchopulmonary apparatus of the antigens cross reacting with
antimicrobial sera was demonstrated.
