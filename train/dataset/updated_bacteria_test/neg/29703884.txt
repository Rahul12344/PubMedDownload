To cause disease in maize, the biotrophic fungus Ustilago maydis secretes a large
arsenal of effector proteins. Here, we functionally characterize the repetitive
effector Rsp3 (repetitive secreted protein 3), which shows length polymorphisms
in field isolates and is highly expressed during biotrophic stages. Rsp3 is
required for virulence and anthocyanin accumulation. During biotrophic growth,
Rsp3 decorates the hyphal surface and interacts with at least two secreted maize 
DUF26-domain family proteins (designated AFP1 and AFP2). AFP1 binds mannose and
displays antifungal activity against the rsp3 mutant but not against a strain
constitutively expressing rsp3. Maize plants silenced for AFP1 and AFP2 partially
rescue the virulence defect of rsp3 mutants, suggesting that blocking the
antifungal activity of AFP1 and AFP2 by the Rsp3 effector is an important
virulence function. Rsp3 orthologs are present in all sequenced smut fungi, and
the ortholog from Sporisorium reilianum can complement the rsp3 mutant of U.
maydis, suggesting a novel widespread fungal protection mechanism.
