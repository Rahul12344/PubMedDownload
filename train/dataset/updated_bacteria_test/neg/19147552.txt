Crucial steps in tumor growth and metastasis are proliferation, survival, and
neovascularization. Previously, we have shown that receptors for CXCL-8, CXCR1,
and CXCR2 are expressed on endothelial cells and CXCR2 has been shown to be a
putative receptor for angiogenic chemokines. In this report, we examined whether 
tumor angiogenesis and growth of CXCL-8-expressing human melanoma cells are
regulated in vivo by a host CXCR2-dependent mechanism. We generated mCXCR2(-/-), 
mCXCR2(+/-), and wild-type nude mice following crosses between BALB/c mice
heterozygous for nude(+/-) and heterozygous for mCXCR2(+/-). We observed a
significant inhibition of human melanoma tumor growth and experimental lung
metastasis in mCXCR2(-/-) mice as compared with wild-type nude mice. Inhibition
in tumor growth and metastasis was associated with a decrease in melanoma cell
proliferation, survival, inflammatory response, and angiogenesis. Together, these
studies show the importance of host CXCR2-dependent CXCL-8-mediated angiogenesis 
in the regulation of melanoma growth and metastasis.
