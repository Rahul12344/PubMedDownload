An experimental model for immersion challenge of rainbow trout fry (Oncorhynchus 
mykiss) with Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the causative agent of rainbow trout
fry syndrome and bacterial cold water disease was established in the present
study. Although injection-based infection models are reliable and produce high
levels of mortality attempts to establish a reproducible immersion model have
been less successful. Various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) were
evaluated before being used as a pre-treatment stressor prior to immersion
exposure to F. psychrophilum. H₂O₂ accelerated the onset of mortality and
increased mortality approximately two-fold; from 9.1% to 19.2% and from 14.7% to 
30.3% in two separate experiments. Clinical signs observed in the infected fish
corresponded to symptoms characteristically seen during natural outbreaks. These 
findings indicate that pre-treatment with H₂O₂ can increase the level of
mortality in rainbow trout fry after exposure to F. psychrophilum.
