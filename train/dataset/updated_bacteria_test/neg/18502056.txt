We examined the potential of inactivated Salmonella strains to induce protective 
antibodies against two adhesins of pathogenic Escherichia coli. The
receptor-binding domains of the F17a-G adhesin of F17a fimbriae and of the FimH
adhesin of type 1 fimbriae were fused to the translocator domain of the
autotransporter AIDA-I. An IgG response against F17a-G or FimH was induced after 
immunization of mice with acetone-inactivated Salmonella displaying the
corresponding fimbrial receptor-binding domain. These sera inhibit in vitro
agglutination of erythrocytes by E. coli carrying these fimbriae. Our results
demonstrate that induced and subsequently acetone-inactivated Salmonella are
useful delivery vehicles for the stimulation of an IgG antibody response against 
heterologous antigens.
