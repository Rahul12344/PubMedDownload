β-Thalassemia is associated with several abnormalities of the innate immune
system. Neutrophils in particular are defective, predisposing patients to
life-threatening bacterial infections. The molecular and cellular mechanisms
involved in impaired neutrophil function remain incompletely defined. We used the
Hbbth3/+ β-thalassemia mouse and hemoglobin E (HbE)/β-thalassemia patients to
investigate dysregulated neutrophil activity. Mature neutrophils from Hbbth3/+
mice displayed a significant reduction in chemotaxis, opsonophagocytosis, and
production of reactive oxygen species, closely mimicking the defective immune
functions observed in β-thalassemia patients. In Hbbth3/+ mice, the expression of
neutrophil CXCR2, CD11b, and reduced NAD phosphate oxidase components (p22phox,
p67phox, and gp91phox) were significantly reduced. Morphological analysis of
Hbbth3/+ neutrophils showed that a large percentage of mature phenotype
neutrophils (Ly6GhiLy6Clow) appeared as band form cells, and a striking expansion
of immature (Ly6GlowLy6Clow) hyposegmented neutrophils, consisting mainly of
myelocytes and metamyelocytes, was noted. Intriguingly, expression of an
essential mediator of neutrophil terminal differentiation, the ets transcription 
factor PU.1, was significantly decreased in Hbbth3/+ neutrophils. In addition, in
vivo infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae failed to induce PU.1 expression or 
upregulate neutrophil effector functions in Hbbth3/+ mice. Similar changes to
neutrophil morphology and PU.1 expression were observed in splenectomized and
nonsplenectomized HbE/β-thalassemia patients. This study provides a mechanistic
insight into defective neutrophil maturation in β-thalassemia patients, which
contributes to deficiencies in neutrophil effector functions.
