The present study investigates the effects of different levels of dietary
xylooligosaccharide (XOS) on skin mucus bactericidal activity and protein
content, intestinal microbiota and morphology as well as growth performance of
Caspian white fish (Rutilus frisii kutum) fry. The specimens (1.54 ± 0.03 g) were
fed experimental diets supplemented with different levels of XOS [0% (control),
1%, 2% and 3%] for 8 weeks. The results revealed that feeding on XOS
significantly increased skin mucus antibacterial activity and protein levels (P <
0.05) and the highest levels were observed in 3% XOS treatment. The total
autochthonous intestinal heterotrophic bacteria significantly increased following
XOS administration in diet (P < 0.05). Administration of 2 or 3% XOS in fry diet 
significantly elevated the autochthonous lactic acid bacteria (P < 0.05).
However, dietary XOS had no significant effect on intestinal morphology, growth
performance and diet utilisation of Caspian white fish fry (P > 0.05). These
results demonstrate beneficial effects of dietary XOS on different parameters of 
mucosal immunity (both skin mucus and intestinal microbiota) and encourage
further studies regards various aspect of XOS administration in early life stages
of fish.
