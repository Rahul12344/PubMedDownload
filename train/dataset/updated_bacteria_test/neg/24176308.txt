Stevioside (13-O-β-sophorosyl-19-O-β-d-glucosyl-steviol) is a non-cariogenic and 
low-calorigenic diterpenoid glycoside. It has a slightly bitter taste and bad
aftertaste. Enzymatic modification by alternansucrase from Leuconostoc citreum
SK24.002 was utilised in the biotransformation of stevioside to fully or
partially remove the bitter taste of the stevioside. The effect of the reaction
conditions including, time (1-24h), temperature (20-40°C), pH (4-7), donor
concentration (10-100mg/ml) and enzyme concentration (0.5-2.5U/ml) were
investigated in order to maximise the transglucosylation yield. The highest
transglucosylation yield of approximately 43.7% was achieved at 20°C, pH 5.4 for 
24h using sucrose at 10mg/ml and alternansucrase at 1U/ml. LC/MS analysis
confirmed that the product was composed of mono-di- and tri- glucosylated
stevioside and their isomers.
