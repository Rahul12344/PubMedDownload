AIMS: Proton motive force (PMF) inhibition enhances the intracellular
accumulation of autoinducers possibly interfering with biofilm formation. We
evaluated the effect of the PMF inhibitor carbonyl
cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) on Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm
development.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Four epidemiologically unrelated P. aeruginosa isolates were
studied. A MexAB-oprM overproducing strain was used as control. Expression of
gene mexB was examined and biofilm formation after incubation with 0, 125 and 25 
micromol l(-1) of CCCP was investigated. Mean values of optical density were
analysed with one-way analysis of variance and t-test. Two isolates subexpressed 
mexB gene and only 25 micromol l(-1) of CCCP affected biofilm formation. Biofilms
of the other two isolates and control strain PA140 exhibited significantly lower 
absorbance (P ranging from < 001 to < 0.05) with either 12.5 or 25 micromol l(-1)
of CCCP.
CONCLUSIONS: The PMF inhibitor CCCP effect was correlated with the expression of 
MexAB-OprM efflux system and found to compromise biofilm formation in P.
aeruginosa.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These data suggest that inhibition of
PMF-dependent trasporters might decrease biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa.
