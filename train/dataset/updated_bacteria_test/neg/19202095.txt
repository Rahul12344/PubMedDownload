Surface exposure of antigens on bacterial cells can be critical for eliciting an 
effective antibody response. Therefore, we investigated the cellular localization
of the fimbrial F17a-G receptor-binding domain, fused to the translocator domain 
of the AIDA-I autotransporter. Synthesis of the fusion protein, under the control
of the L-arabinose-inducible PBAD promoter, was shown to permeabilize Escherichia
coli K-12 and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium cells. The presence of
permeable cells interfered with several methods that are typically used to
determine surface exposure of proteins, such as protease treatment and whole-cell
ELISA. Double immunofluorescence microscopy, using a second antibody directed
against beta-galactosidase, a bacterial protein expressed in the cytoplasm,
allowed the simultaneous detection of antigen expression and permeability in
individual cells.
