This is the first report on the occurrence of streptothricin resistance (MIC >
400 micrograms/ml) in Campylobacter spp. The majority of resistant strains has
been typed as C. coli by biotyping and SDS disc electrophoresis of bacterial
whole cell proteins. The resistance to streptothricin was strongly connected with
resistance to kanamycin (100%) and tetracycline (80%). As an important source of 
streptothricin-resistant Campylobacter strains we localized slurry of swine
previously fed with feed containing streptothricins. Additionally, such strains
could also be isolated from river water.
