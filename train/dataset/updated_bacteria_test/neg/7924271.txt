A run length code compression scheme of extreme simplicity, used for image
storage in an automated bacterial morphometry system, is compared with more
common compression schemes, such as are used in the tag image file format. These 
schemes are Lempel-Ziv and Welch (LZW), Macintosh Packbits, and CCITT Group 3
Facsimile 1-dimensional modified Huffman run length code. In a set of 25 images
consisting of full microscopic fields of view of bacterial slides, the method
gave a 10.3-fold compression: 1.074 times better than LZW. In a second set of
images of single areas of interest within each field of view, compression ratios 
of over 600 were obtained, 12.8 times that of LZW. The drawback of the system is 
its bad worst case performance. The method could be used in any application
requiring storage of binary images of relatively small objects with fairly large 
spaces in between.
