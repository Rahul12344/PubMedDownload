Blockade of undesired neutrophil migration to sites of inflammation remains an
area of substantial pharmaceutical interest. To effect this blockade, a validated
therapeutic target is antagonism of the chemokine receptor CXCR2. Herein we
report the discovery of 6-(2-boronic
acid-5-trifluoromethoxy-benzylsulfanyl)-N-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-nicotinamide 6, an
antagonist with activity at both CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors (IC50 values 31 and 21
nM, respectively). Compound 6 exhibited potent inhibition of neutrophil influx in
a rat model of pulmonary inflammation, and is hypothesized to interact with a
unique intracellular binding site on CXCR2. Compound 6 (SX-576) is undergoing
further investigation as a potential therapy for pulmonary inflammation.
