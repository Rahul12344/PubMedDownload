Chi3l1 is induced by a variety of cancers where it portends a poor prognosis and 
plays a key role in the generation of metastasis. However, the mechanisms that
Chi3l1 uses to mediate these responses and the pathways that control
Chi3l1-induced tumor responses are poorly understood. We characterized the
mechanisms that Chi3l1 uses to foster tumor progression and the ability of the
RIG-like helicase (RLH) innate immune response to control Chi3l1 elaboration and 
pulmonary metastasis. Here we demonstrate that RLH activation inhibits tumor
induction of Chi3l1 and the expression of receptor IL-13Rα2 and pulmonary
metastasis while restoring NK cell accumulation and activation, augmenting the
expression of IFN-α/β, chemerin and its receptor ChemR23, p-cofilin, LIMK2 and
PTEN and inhibiting BRAF and NLRX1 in a MAVS-dependent manner. These studies
demonstrate that Chi3l1 is a multifaceted immune stimulator of tumor progression 
and metastasis whose elaboration and tissue effects are abrogated by RLH innate
immune responses.
