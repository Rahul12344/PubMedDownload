BACKGROUND: Exposure to mould or dampness at home has been associated with
adverse respiratory effects in all age groups. This exposure has also been
related to insomnia in adults. We aimed to investigate the association between
exposure to visible mould or dampness at home and sleep problems in children.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 1719 10-year-old children from the
German population-based birth cohort LISAplus with available data on current
mould or dampness at home and sleep problems. The presence of visible mould or
dampness at home was assessed by questionnaire. Parent-reported sleep problems of
their child were analysed by four binary variables: presence of any sleep
problems, problems to fall asleep, problems sleeping through the night and a 24h 
sleep time of less than 9h. Logistic regression models adjusted for study centre,
sex, age and level of parental education were applied to examine the association 
between visible mould or dampness at home and sleep problems. Sensitivity
analyses included a further adjustment for bedroom sharing and subgroup analyses 
in children without current allergic diseases.
RESULTS: Thirteen percent of parents reported visible mould or dampness at home. 
We observed increased risks for all four sleep problem variables for children
exposed to visible mould or dampness at home. Results were significant for any
sleep problems (odds ratio (OR)=1.77 (95%-confidence interval (CI): 1.21-2.60),
problems sleeping through the night (OR=2.52(1.27-5.00) and a short sleep time
(OR=1.68(1.09-2.61)). While a further adjustment for bedroom sharing and the
exclusion of children with asthma or eczema led to similar results, only the
association with a short sleep time was still present in children without
allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that visible mould or dampness at home might
negatively influence sleep in children. The influence of allergic
rhinoconjunctivitis on this association needs to be investigated in future
studies.
