Selenophosphate synthetase (SPS) was initially detected in bacteria and was shown
to synthesize selenophosphate, the active selenium donor. However, mammals have
two SPS paralogues, which are designated SPS1 and SPS2. Although it is known that
SPS2 catalyses the synthesis of selenophosphate, the function of SPS1 remains
largely unclear. To examine the role of SPS1 in mammals, we generated a
Sps1-knockout mouse and found that systemic SPS1 deficiency led to embryos that
were clearly underdeveloped by embryonic day (E)8.5 and virtually resorbed by
E14.5. The knockout of Sps1 in the liver preserved viability, but significantly
affected the expression of a large number of mRNAs involved in cancer, embryonic 
development and the glutathione system. Particularly notable was the extreme
deficiency of glutaredoxin 1 (GLRX1) and glutathione transferase Omega 1 (GSTO1).
To assess these phenotypes at the cellular level, we targeted the removal of SPS1
in F9 cells, a mouse embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell line, which affected the
glutathione system proteins and accordingly led to the accumulation of hydrogen
peroxide in the cell. Furthermore, we found that several malignant
characteristics of SPS1-deficient F9 cells were reversed, suggesting that SPS1
played a role in supporting and/or sustaining cancer. In addition, the
overexpression of mouse or human GLRX1 led to a reversal of observed increases in
reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the F9 SPS1/GLRX1-deficient cells and resulted
in levels that were similar to those in F9 SPS1-sufficient cells. The results
suggested that SPS1 is an essential mammalian enzyme with roles in regulating
redox homoeostasis and controlling cell growth.
