The possibility of the accidental or deliberate release of genetically engineered
microorganisms into the environment has accentuated the need to study their
survival in, and effect on, natural habitats. In this study, Pseudomonas putida
UWC1 harboring a non-self-transmissible plasmid, pD10, encoding the breakdown of 
3-chlorobenzoate was shown to survive in a fully functioning laboratory-scale
activated-sludge unit (ASU) for more than 8 weeks. The ASU maintained a healthy, 
diverse protozoal population throughout the experiment, and the introduced strain
did not adversely affect the functioning of the unit. Although plasmid pD10 was
stably maintained in the host bacterium, the introduced strain did not enhance
the degradation of 3-chlorobenzoate in the ASU. When reisolated from the ASU,
derivatives of strain UWC1 (pD10) were identified which were able to transfer
plasmid pD10 to a recipient strain, P. putida PaW340, indicating the in situ
transfer of mobilizing plasmids from the indigenous population to the introduced 
strain. Results from plate filter matings showed that bacteria present in the
activated-sludge population could act as recipients for plasmid pD10 and actively
expressed genes carried on the plasmid. Some of these activated-sludge
transconjugants gave higher rates of 3-chlorobenzoate breakdown than did strain
UWC1(pD10) in batch culture.
