IL-22 has been suggested to play an important role in immune response against
Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. However, the exact role of IL-22 in human
tuberculosis (TB) infection remains unclear and the regulatory mechanism of IL-22
response in human TB is unknown. In this study, we observed that successful
anti-tuberculosis treatment induced an enhanced and sustained M. tuberculosis
antigen-specific IL-22 response, correlated with the decrease of the frequencies 
of CD19(+)CD5(+)CD1d(+) regulatory B cells. We also found that depletion of
CD19(+) B cells significantly enhanced M. tuberculosis antigen-specific IL-22
production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. More importantly, we observed
that purified CD19(+) B cells, and more efficiently, CD19(+)CD5(+)CD1d(+)
regulatory B cells, suppressed IL-22 production. In summary, we showed here for
the first time that effective anti-tuberculosis treatment restores
M. tuberculosis antigen-specific IL-22 response through a novel mechanism by
reducing the frequencies of CD19(+)CD5(+)CD1d(+) regulatory B cells in human TB.
