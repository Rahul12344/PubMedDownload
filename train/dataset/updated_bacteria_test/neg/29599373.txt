BACKGROUND/AIM: Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B), an
autophagy marker, has been used as a promising marker in various cancer types.
However, the expression of LC3B in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and its 
prognostic significance have not been investigated. Recent studies pointed to the
involvement of ESRRA in regulating autophagy via both transcriptional and
post-translational control. In the current study, prognostic importance of LC3B
and ESRRA in MIBC was investigated.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We immunohistochemically studied the expression of LC3B and
ESRRA in 56 MIBC samples.
RESULTS: LC3B was stained high in 16 patients (28.6%) and low or negative in 40
patients (71.4%). ESRRA expression was high for 20 patients (35.7%) and low for
36 patients (64.3%). Both LC3B (p=0.003) and ESRRA (p=0.026) expression
correlated significantly with disease-free survival rates. Double-positive LC3B
and ESRRA correlated with poor overall survival (p=0.007) and disease-free
survival (p=0.001) in MIBC patients.
CONCLUSION: LC3B and ESRRA might be a useful prognostic factor in patients with
MIBC. The co-expression of LC3B and ESRRA might be a prognostic and therapeutic
target for patients with bladder cancer.
