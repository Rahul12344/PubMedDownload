Surgical suite reconstruction. Infection control.

Adams RH, Fry DE.

Careful literature review revealed little information on the safety of using an
operating room during major renovation. This study sought to determine if an
operating room under renovation increases infectious morbidity in the surgical
wound. The observations of this study indicate that it is possible to use a
properly ventilated operating room undergoing renovation if the precautions of
controlling construction traffic, sealing off the construction area from the OR
in use, fastidious housekeeping, environmental culturing, and careful
surveillance of wound infections are used.
