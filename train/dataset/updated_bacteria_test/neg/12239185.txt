CXC chemokines play a central role in regulation of neutrophil activation and
chemotaxis. Because the chemotactic responses of neutrophils are impaired after
phagocytosis, we explored the effect of phagocytic stimuli on the expression of
interleukin-8 (IL-8) receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, in human neutrophils. After
phagocytosis of opsonized yeast, the expression of CXCR1 and CXCR2 was
substantially down-regulated and was accompanied by reduced Ca(++) responses to
corresponding ligands, IL-8 and neutrophil-activating peptide-2 (NAP-2). The
levels of CXCR1 and CXCR2 mRNA were constant during phagocytic stimulation of
neutrophils. Confocal microscopy revealed that CXCR reduction was not via
internalization. Metalloproteinase inhibitor, 1,10-phenantroline, prevented the
reduction of CXCRs induced by phagocytosis, indicating that proteolytic
degradation may be responsible for down-regulation. These observations suggest
that down-regulation of CXCR expression may substantially reduce the
responsiveness of phagocytosing neutrophils to CXC chemokines.
