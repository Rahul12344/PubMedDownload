The onset of type 1 diabetes in NOD mice is delayed by oral administration of a
bacterial extract (OM-85) and can be completely prevented by its intraperitoneal 
administration. Optimal prevention is observed when starting treatment at 3 or 6 
weeks of age, and some effect is still observed with treatment at 10 weeks of
age. Using genetically deficient mice and cytokine-neutralizing monoclonal
antibodies, we demonstrate here that the therapeutic effect does not involve
T-helper type 2 cytokines (interleukin [IL]-4 and -10) but is tightly dependent
on transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. Natural killer T-cells also participate
in the therapeutic effect because CD1d(-/-) NOD mice are partially resistant to
the protective effect of OM-85. The question remains of the specificity of the
protective effect of OM-85, which may include proinflammatory components. It will
thus be important to further characterize the molecular components that afford
protection from type 1 diabetes. Lipopolysaccharide is excluded, but other
Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists could be involved because OM-85 stimulated
dendritic cells and induced TGF-beta production by splenocytes in a TLR-2-,
TLR-4-, and MyD88-dependent fashion.
