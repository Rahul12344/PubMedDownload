Fragments of the alpha-toxin of Clostridium perfringens have been produced using 
genetic manipulation techniques. Antibody which cross-reacted with the
alpha-toxin was induced after immunization with fragments representing the N-
(Cpa1-249) and C-terminal (Cpa247-370) domains of the toxin. Smaller fragments of
the alpha-toxin did not induce cross-reacting antibody. Anti-Cpa1-249 serum
neutralized phospholipase C activity but not haemolytic activity of the toxin.
Anti-Cpa247-370 serum neutralized both the phospholipase C and haemolytic
activities. Only immunization with Cpa247-370 induced protection against the
lethal effects of the toxin. Immunization with Cpa247-370 also provided
protection in a mouse model against at least 10 LD100 doses of C. perfringens
type A. This result confirms the essential role of this toxin in the pathogenesis
of gas gangrene.
