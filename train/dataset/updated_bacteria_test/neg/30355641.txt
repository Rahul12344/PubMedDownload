BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have the potential to prevent 
pneumococcal disease through direct and indirect protection. This multicentre
European study estimated the indirect effects of 5-year childhood PCV10 and/or
PCV13 programmes on invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in older adults across 13
sites in 10 European countries, to support decision-making on pneumococcal
vaccination policies.
METHODS: For each site we calculated IPD incidence rate ratios (IRR) in people
aged ≥65 years by serotype for each PCV10/13 year (2011-2015) compared with 2009 
(pre-PCV10/13). We calculated pooled IRR and 95% CI using random-effects
meta-analysis and PCV10/13 effect as (1 - IRR)*100.
RESULTS: After five PCV10/13 years, the incidence of IPD caused by all types,
PCV7 and additional PCV13 serotypes declined 9% (95% CI -4% to 19%), 77% (95% CI 
67% to 84%) and 38% (95% CI 19% to 53%), respectively, while the incidence of
non-PCV13 serotypes increased 63% (95% CI 39% to 91%). The incidence of serotypes
included in PCV13 and not in PCV10 decreased 37% (95% CI 22% to 50%) in six PCV13
sites and increased by 50% (95% CI -8% to 146%) in the four sites using PCV10
(alone or with PCV13). In 2015, PCV13 serotypes represented 20-29% and 32-53% of 
IPD cases in PCV13 and PCV10 sites, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Overall IPD incidence in older adults decreased moderately after five
childhood PCV10/13 years in 13 European sites. Large declines in PCV10/13
serotype IPD, due to the indirect effect of childhood vaccination, were countered
by increases in non-PCV13 IPD, but these declines varied according to the
childhood vaccine used. Decision-making on pneumococcal vaccination for older
adults must consider the indirect effects of childhood PCV programmes. Sustained 
monitoring of IPD epidemiology is imperative.
