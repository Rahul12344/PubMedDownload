OBJECTIVE: To assess the knowledge, attitude and practices of HCWs regarding
needle stick injuries at the Aga Khan University Hospital.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on medical personnel. A structured
pre-tested questionnaire was administered during June-July 2003. The data was
analysed by SPSS 13.0. Percentages of the categorical variables were computed and
compared by Chi square test at a 5% level of significance. Odds ratios and their 
95% CIs were also computed.
RESULTS: Of 80 participants, 29 were doctors and 51 were registered nurses. About
45% reported having a needle stick injury in the past. Frequency of injury was
significantly higher among doctors (p < 0.001). The most common reason identified
was stress or being over burdened followed by careless attitude. More than 50% of
the injuries occurred while injecting or drawing blood samples. The risk of
getting infections was well known amongst both the groups. Two third of
participants were familiar with the prevention protocols and practices of nurses 
were generally safer than doctors (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Despite knowing the risks, frequency of needle stick injury was
generally higher especially among doctors reflecting bad practice and careless
attitude towards work. Mandatory reporting, proper follow-up and constant
reinforcement are recommended to reduce the rate of nosocomial transmission to
health care workers.
