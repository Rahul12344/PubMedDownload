Fimbriae and enterotoxins are major virulence factors associated with
enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). In this study, 3 sets of multiplex
polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) assays targeting fimbriae, enterotoxins, and
other adherence factors were developed for detecting ETEC. A total number of 188 
E. coli field isolates were examined, and percentages of E. coli strains carrying
each virulence factors were as follows: F4 (7.45%), F5 (29.79%), F6 (6.38%), F18 
(15.43%), F41 (3.72%), STa (10.11%), STb (20.74%), LT (9.57%), Stx2e (2.13%),
EAST1 (42.02%), F1 (67.55%), AIDA-I (2.66%), and pAA (7.45%). Of the 188 E. coli 
field isolates examined, 25.53% were found to be pathogenic ETEC, having both
fimbriae and enterotoxins. However, the ratio increased to 44.68% when the
presence of other adhesins was considered as criteria for virulence. Among the
adherence factors, F1 was found to be the most prevalent. AIDA-I and pAA were
also found with similar ratio as compared with other virulence factors. In
addition, virulence patterns carrying these alternate adhesive genes with
enterotoxins were detected with significant ratio. Therefore, it is desirable
that alternate adhesins be considered as markers for diagnosis of ETEC.
