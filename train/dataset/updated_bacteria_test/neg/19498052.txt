BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination is the major infectious hazard associated
with transfusion of platelet preparations (PLTs). Routine testing for bacterial
contamination in PLTs has become common, but transfusion-transmitted bacterial
sepsis has not been eliminated. Here, we describe a novel flow cytometry-based
method for point-of-issue screening of PLTs for bacterial contamination.
METHODS: We used the BactiFlow flow cytometer to detect and count bacteria based 
on esterase activity in viable cells. We compared the assay to incubation
(BacT/Alert culture system) and rapid nucleic acid-based or immunoassay (reverse 
transcription PCR, Pan Genera Detection) methods.
RESULTS: We established a protocol for bacterial screening of PLTs consisting of 
enzymatic digestion and centrifugal filtration for the elimination of viable
platelets and selective labeling of bacteria with fluorescent esterase substrate 
(ChemChrome V23). Results from the BactiFlow showed an excellent correlation (r =
0.9923 E. coli, r = 0.9736 S. epidermidis) to traditional plate count results.
The lower detection limit of the assay was determined to be 150 CFU/mL, and the
time to result was <1 h.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that BactiFlow flow cytometry is suitable for
rapid screening of PLTs for bacterial contamination and fulfils the requirements 
for a point-of-issue testing of PLTs with acceptable time to result, specificity,
sensitivity, and cost.
