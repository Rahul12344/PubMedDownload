We describe a rhinofacial entomophthoramycosis case in a sexagenarian (65 years
old) housewife. She was immunocompetent and resident of Burkina Faso. She
consulted both the service of dermatology and the service of stomatology of the
Teaching Hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso in February 2016 for a diffuse facial
tumefaction evolving over six months. This tumefaction was associated with
headaches and a left nasal obstruction. Histological examination of the lesion
showed an important and polymorphic inflammatory reaction. Also, a filamentous
fungus with wide non-septated hyphae and right-angled fungal branching,
consistent with mucormycosis was isolated. Mycological diagnosis based on fungal 
culture with Sabouraud medium without any antibiotic and cyclohexemide after
incubation at 27°C and at 30°C was negative. Furthermore, it was not possible to 
amplify the DNA extracted from biopsy. Antifungal therapy based on the
administration of fluconazole per os at 800mg/day was started allowing clinical
improvement. This is the first case of a rhinofacial entomophtharomycosis
documented in Bobo-Dioulasso. Rhinofacial entomophthoromycosis is largely
unknown, even in tropical regions such as Burkina Faso. This lack of knowledge
results in a delay in the diagnosis, and subsequently a bad prognosis. It is
therefore urgent to improve knowledge on this disease to guide diagnostic steps, 
prognosis of outcome, and antifungal therapy.
