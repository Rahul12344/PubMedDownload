Rubella is a common cause of rash and fever during childhood. However, its public
health importance relates to the teratogenic effects of primary rubella infection
occurring in pregnant women, which can lead to fetal death with spontaneous
abortion or to congenital defects in surviving infants. Most of the cases are
asymptomatic and difficult to diagnose on clinical grounds. Detection of specific
IgM antibodies by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique is a
useful method for diagnosis. The present study was conducted on 180 pregnant
women attending antenatal clinics at Government Maternity Hospital, Tirupati. All
the serum samples were tested for Rubella-specific IgM antibodies. A
seropositivity of 12.67% was observed among cases with bad obstetric history and 
6.67% in normal pregnant women. Within the test group, high sero-positivity
(13.33%) was observed in women with repeated abortions followed by in cases of
intrauterine death (12.73%). The results indicate high prevalence of rubella in
our population. All antenatal cases should be routinely screened for rubella, so 
that early diagnosis will help in proper management and fetal outcome.
