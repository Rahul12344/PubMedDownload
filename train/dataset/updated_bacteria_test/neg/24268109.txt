Dendritic cells (DCs) are potent antigen presenting cells, described as the
initiators of adaptive immune responses. Immature monocyte-derived DCs (MDDC)
showed decreased CD14 expression, increased cell surface markers DC-SIGN and CD1a
and enhanced levels of receptors for the chemokines CCL3 (CCR1/CCR5) and CXCL8
(CXCR1/CXCR2) compared with human CD14⁺ monocytes. After further MDDC maturation 
by LPS, the markers CD80 and CD83 and the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR7 were
upregulated, whereas CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5 expression was reduced. CCL3
dose-dependently synergized with CXCL8 or CXCL12 in chemotaxis of immature MDDC. 
CXCL12 augmented the CCL3-induced ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation in immature
MDDC, although the synergy between CCL3 and CXCL12 in chemotaxis of immature MDDC
was dependent on the Akt signaling pathway but not on ERK1/2 phosphorylation.
CCL2 also synergized with CXCL12 in immature MDDC migration. Moreover, two CXC
chemokines not sharing receptors (CXCL12 and CXCL8) cooperated in immature MDDC
chemotaxis, whereas two CC chemokines (CCL3 and CCL7) sharing CCR1 did not.
Further, the non-chemokine G protein-coupled receptor ligands chemerin and fMLP
synergized with respectively CCL7 and CCL3 in immature MDDC signaling and
migration. Finally, CXCL12 and CCL3 did not cooperate, but CXCL12 synergized with
CCL21 in mature MDDC chemotaxis. Thus, chemokine synergy in immature and mature
MDDC migration is dose-dependently regulated by chemokines via alterations in
their chemokine receptor expression pattern according to their role in immune
responses.
