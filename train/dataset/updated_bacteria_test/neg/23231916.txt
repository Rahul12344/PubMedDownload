A novel floatable and biodegradable carrier material was made by coating puffed
foxtail millet (PFM) with a calcium alginate (CA)-chitosan compound membrane. A
diesel oil-degrading marine bacterial strain, Acinetobacter sp. F9, was
immobilized on the carrier material. The number of viable F9 cells immobilized on
the carrier material reached approximately 5×10(9) CFU/g. This formulation could 
be stored at -20°C and 4°C for 10 weeks without a significant decrease in the
number of viable immobilized cells. SEM results showed that the coating membrane 
was porous and that F9 cells were immobilized on the walls of the pores. The
immobilized F9 cells were able to remove more than 90% of the diesel oil by the
second day, while free F9 cells did not remove 90% of the diesel oil until the
seventh day. GC-MS analysis indicated that the immobilized F9 cells could remove 
diesel oil more completely than free cells. The immobilization of the F9 cells
enhanced their ability to biodegrade diesel oil.
