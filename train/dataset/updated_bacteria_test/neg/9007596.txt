The neurologic symptoms of borreliosis can be classified to give distinct
clinical pictures. The exact clinical characterisation allows an unambiguous and 
applicable classification of the different neurologic manifestations to be made. 
Due to high background seroprevalence of anti-Borrelia antibodies this
classification is crucial for diagnosis. The most frequent neurologic
manifestation is meningopolyradiculitis. It shows a typical pattern of symptoms, 
yet for differential diagnosis the crucial symptoms are the severe pains and the 
paresis of cranial nerves. In up to 10% of these patients no specific intrathecal
antibody production was identified due to the time factor. Intrathecal antibody
production cannot therefore be considered as the exclusive criterium for
neuroborreliosis.
