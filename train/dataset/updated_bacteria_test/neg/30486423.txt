CXCL8 or interleukin (IL)-8 directs neutrophil migration and activation through
interaction with CXCR1 and CXCR2 that belong to the family of G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs). Naturally occurring posttranslational modifications of the
NH₂-terminal region of CXCL8 affect its biological activities, but the underlying
molecular mechanisms are only partially understood. Here, we studied the
implications of site-specific citrullination and truncation for the signaling
potency of CXCL8. Native CXCL8(1-77), citrullinated [Cit5]CXCL8(1-77) and the
major natural isoform CXCL8(6-77) were chemically synthesized and tested in
internalization assays using human neutrophils. Citrullinated and truncated
isoforms showed a moderately enhanced capacity to induce internalization of CXCR1
and CXCR2. Moreover, CXCL8-mediated activation of Gαi-dependent signaling through
CXCR1 and CXCR2 was increased upon modification to [Cit5]CXCL8(1-77) or
CXCL8(6-77). All CXCL8 variants promoted recruitment of β-arrestins 1 and 2 to
CXCR1 and CXCR2. Compared to CXCL8(1-77), CXCL8(6-77) showed an enhanced potency 
to recruit β-arrestin 2 to both receptors, while for [Cit5]CXCL8(1-77) only the
capacity to induce β-arrestin 2 recruitment to CXCR2 was increased. Both
modifications had no biasing effect, i.e., did not alter the preference of CXCL8 
to activate either Gαi-protein or β-arrestin-dependent signaling through its
receptors. Our results support the concept that specific chemokine activities are
fine-tuned by posttranslational modifications.
