AIM: With this manuscript we want to show a means of the clinical management in
an advanced stage of tuberculous destruction of the knee in elderly, polymorbid
patients with a high risk of undergoing surgery.
METHOD: We describe the case of a patient who suffered from a Mycobacterium bovis
infection of the left knee that led to spontaneous ankylosis in her childhood. At
the age of 87 years an acute exacerbation of the tuberculous osteoarthritis
occurred due to a drop attack with a fracture in the region of the previous knee 
ankylosis. Considering the patient's age and general poor condition, it was our
paramount goal to preserve her walking ability and to avoid that she becomes
bedridden.
RESULTS: After radical surgical debridement and resection of the ankylosis, we
achieved macroscopically clean bone and soft tissue conditions. We performed
palliative arthrodesis with a long intramedullary nail and a cement spacer.
Additionally, the patient underwent a tuberculostatic therapy for 8 months. The
acute inflammatory process could be stopped and the ability of the patient to
walk could be preserved.
CONCLUSION: Because of the increased incidence of tuberculosis in the
industrialised countries during the past 20 years, it should be considered as a
differential diagnosis in cases of unclear septic arthritis.
