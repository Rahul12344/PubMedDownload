Natural killer T (NKT) cells recognize glycosphingolipids presented by CD1d
molecules and have been linked to defense against microbial infections.
Previously defined foreign glycosphingolipids recognized by NKT cells are
uniquely found in nonpathogenic sphingomonas bacteria. Here we show that mouse
and human NKT cells also recognized glycolipids, specifically a diacylglycerol,
from Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease. The B. burgdorferi-derived,
glycolipid-induced NKT cell proliferation and cytokine production and the
antigenic potency of this glycolipid was dependent on acyl chain length and
saturation. These data indicate that NKT cells recognize categories of
glycolipids beyond those in sphingomonas and suggest that NKT cell responses
driven by T cell receptor-mediated glycolipid recognition may provide protection 
against diverse pathogens.
