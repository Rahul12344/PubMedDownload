[Periods and milestones in the history of dermatology].

[Article in Swedish]

Thyresson N.

The history of dermatology may be divided in five periods. The first period,
dominated by the humoral doctrine (humoral pathology), extends through the
Antiquity, the Middle Ages, the 1600th, 1700th and the major part of the 1800th
century. The second period (1775-1840) is characterized by the development of the
"dermatological systems" and the third period (1840-1890) by the advances in
pathology and microbiology. During the fourth period (1890-1940) dermatology
develops into a discipline of medical science. A fifth period started in the
middle of the 1940th when the chemotherapeutic and antibiotic drugs and later the
glukocorticoids revolutionized dermatological therapy. From this time the
advances in especially immunology, genetics, ultrastructural research and
molecular biology have also given us a quite new understanding of the
pathogenesis of skin diseases.
