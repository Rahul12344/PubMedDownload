We present a case of pleural empyema, occurred in a healty 7 years boy. He was
admitted to our hospital because of a lobare pneumonitis. The patient was
administered with a 2 degrees generation Cefalosporine given intramuscularly and 
with Corticosteroid (1 mg/kg/die). After an initial improvement of his clinical
conditions, he got worse so that he underwent a TC scan which showed the presence
of a left pleural empyema requiring the insertion of an intercostal tube drainage
followed by an intervention of decortication. The boy had some evidence of a
staphylococcal etiology such as the evolution in empyema itself, the augmentation
of antistafilolisinic title found during the illness, and the typical finding of 
blebs on chest radiograph. As cultures from both blood and drainage liquid
samples remained sterile, we were unable to demonstrate a clear bacterial
etiology of the empyema. It remains doubtful if corticosteroid administration
could contribute to the severity of the pneumonia evolution.
