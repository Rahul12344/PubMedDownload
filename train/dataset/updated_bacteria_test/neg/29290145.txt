Circulating neutrophils, rapidly recruited in response to microbial infection,
form the first line in host defense. Humans express ~50 chemokines, of which a
subset of seven chemokines, characterized by the conserved "Glu-Leu-Arg" motif,
mediate neutrophil recruitment. Neutrophil-activating chemokines (NACs) share
similar structures, exist as monomers and dimers, activate the CXCR2 receptor on 
neutrophils, and interact with tissue glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Considering
cellular assays have shown that NACs have similar CXCR2 activity, the question
has been and remains, why do humans express so many NACs? In this review, we make
the case that NACs are not redundant and that distinct GAG interactions determine
chemokine-specific in vivo functions. Structural studies have shown that the
GAG-binding interactions of NACs are distinctly different, and that conserved and
specific residues in the context of structure determine geometries that could not
have been predicted from sequences alone. Animal studies indicate recruitment
profiles of monomers and dimers are distinctly different, monomer-dimer
equilibrium regulates recruitment, and that recruitment profiles vary between
chemokines and between tissues, providing evidence that GAG interactions
orchestrate neutrophil recruitment. We propose in vivo GAG interactions impact
several chemokine properties including gradients and lifetime, and that these
interactions fine-tune and define the functional response of each chemokine that 
can vary between different cell and tissue types for successful resolution of
inflammation.
