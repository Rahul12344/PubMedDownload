Despite the success of treating EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients with EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), all patients eventually acquire resistance to
these therapies. Although various resistance mechanisms have been described,
there are currently no FDA-approved therapies that target alternative mechanisms 
to treat lung tumors with acquired resistance to first-line EGFR TKI agents. Here
we found that EPHA2 is overexpressed in EGFR TKI-resistant tumor cells. Loss of
EPHA2 reduced the viability of erlotinib-resistant tumor cells harboring
EGFR(T790M) mutations in vitro and inhibited tumor growth and progression in an
inducible EGFR(L858R+T790M)-mutant lung cancer model in vivo. Targeting EPHA2 in 
erlotinib-resistant cells decreased S6K1-mediated phosphorylation of cell death
agonist BAD, resulting in reduced tumor cell proliferation and increased
apoptosis. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of EPHA2 by the small-molecule
inhibitor ALW-II-41-27 decreased both survival and proliferation of
erlotinib-resistant tumor cells and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. ALW-II-41-27 
was also effective in decreasing viability of cells with acquired resistance to
the third-generation EGFR TKI AZD9291. Collectively, these data define a role for
EPHA2 in the maintenance of cell survival of TKI-resistant, EGFR-mutant lung
cancer and indicate that EPHA2 may serve as a useful therapeutic target in
TKI-resistant tumors.
