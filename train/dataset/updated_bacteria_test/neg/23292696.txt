The cell wall of mycobacterium offers well validated targets which can be
exploited for discovery of new lead compounds. MurC-MurF ligases catalyze a
series of irreversible steps in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan precursor, i.e.
MurD catalyzes the ligation of D-glutamate to the nucleotide precursor UMA. The
three dimensional structure of Mtb-MurD is not known and was predicted by us for 
the first time using comparative homology modeling technique. The accuracy and
stability of the predicted Mtb-MurD structure was validated using Procheck and
molecular dynamics simulation. Key interactions in Mtb-MurD were studied using
docking analysis of available transition state inhibitors of E.coli-MurD. The
docking analysis revealed that analogues of both L and D forms of glutamic acid
have similar interaction profiles with Mtb-MurD. Further, residues His192,
Arg382, Ser463, and Tyr470 are proposed to be important for inhibitor-(Mtb-MurD) 
interactions. We also identified few pharmacophoric features essential for
Mtb-MurD ligase inhibitory activity and which can further been utilized for the
discovery of putative antitubercular chemotherapy.
