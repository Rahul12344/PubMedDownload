Bacterial infection of the cornea is a rare, but sight-threatening, complication 
of contact lens wear that was first reported shortly after soft lenses were
introduced onto the market in the 1970s. During the past 3 decades, various
attempts to solve the problem with new lens types and lens care products have
failed to make a significant impact on its incidence. Eliminating contact
lens-related infections will likely require a better understanding of the ocular 
defense system, microbial virulence strategies, how they affect one another, and 
the effects of contact lens wear on both. Each of these topics is complex.
Although research in this area is therefore challenging and necessitates a
multidisciplinary approach, what we are learning along the way has significance
beyond contact lens-related infection and could ultimately lead to the
development of new strategies to prevent this and a range of other sight- and
life-threatening diseases.
