Counts of thermophilic campylobacters from 31 different waste water samples were 
parallel estimated with two different cultivation media. The resulting increased 
isolation sale obtained with an modified Charcoal-Cefoperazone-Deoxycholat-Medium
(MCCD-Medium), was statistically significant. An 15.8 fold increased isolation
rate, compared with the standard medium, could be estimated with the help of the 
geometric mean.
