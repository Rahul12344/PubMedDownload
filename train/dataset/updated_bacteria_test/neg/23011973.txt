A library of 4,5-disubstituted 2-aminoimidazole triazole amide (2-AITA)
conjugates has been successfully assembled. Upon biological screening, this class
of small molecules was discovered as enhanced biofilm regulators through
non-microbicidal mechanisms against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB), with active
concentrations in the low micromolar range. The library was also subjected to
synergism and resensitization studies with β-lactam antibiotics against MRSA.
Lead compounds were identified that suppress the antibiotic resistance of MRSA by
working synergistically with oxacillin, a β-lactam antibiotic resistant to
penicillinase. A further structure-activity relationship (SAR) study on the
parent 2-AITA compound delivered a 2-aminoimidazole diamide (2-AIDA) conjugate
with significantly increased synergistic activity with oxacillin against MRSA,
decreasing the MIC value of the β-lactam antibiotic by 64-fold. Increased
anti-biofilm activity did not necessarily lead to increased suppression of
antibiotic resistance, which indicates that biofilm inhibition and
resensitization are most likely occurring via distinct mechanisms.
