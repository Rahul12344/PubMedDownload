The invariant (i) natural killer (NK)T cells represent a unique subset of T
lymphocytes which express the V alpha 14 chain of the T cell receptor (TCR), that
recognizes glycolipid antigens presented by the nonpolymorphic major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like antigen presentation molecule CD1d,
and they participate in protection against some microbial pathogens. Although
iNKT cells have originally been regarded as T cells co-expressing NKR-P1B/C
(NK1.1: CD 161), they do not seem to consistently express this marker, since
NK1.1 surface expression on iNKT cells undergoes dramatic changes following
facultative intracellular bacterial infection, which is correlated with
functional changes of this cell population. Accumulating evidence suggests that
NK1.1 allows recognition of "missing-self", thus controlling
activation/inhibition of NK1.1-expressing cells. Therefore, it is tempting to
suggest that iNKT cells participate in the regulation of host immune responses
during facultative intracellular bacterial infection by controlling NK1.1 surface
expression. These findings shed light not only on the unique role of iNKT cells
in microbial infection, but also provide evidence for new aspects of the NK1.1 as
a regulatory molecule on these cells.
