The disease microsporidiosis is found worldwide and is mainly caused by
Enterocytozoon bieneusi. E. bieneusi can infect a wide range of hosts; however,
information regarding the prevalence and genotyping of E. bieneusi infection in
raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) is limited. Therefore, in 2015, we
examined 305 faecel samples from 80 farmed raccoon dogs in Jilin Province, from
54 in Hebei Province, from 72 in Liaoning Province, from 29 in Shandong Province,
and from 40 in Heilongjiang Province. The overall prevalence of E. bieneusi
infection in farmed raccoon dogs was 22.30%. Logistic regression analysis
suggests that age, gender and region of raccoon dogs were highly related to the
prevalence of E. bieneusi infection. Moreover, six E. bieneusi internal
transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequences, including four known genotypes, namely
D, CHN-DC1, NCF2, and CHN-F1, and two novel genotypes (NCR1 and NCR2), were
identified in the present study. The present study firstly indicated the
existence of E. bieneusi genotypes NCF2, NCR1, NCR2and CHN-F1 in infected raccoon
dogs in Northern China. Integrated control strategies should be implemented to
limit E. bieneusi infection in farmed raccoon dogs, and to prevent transmission
of this disease to other animals and humans.
