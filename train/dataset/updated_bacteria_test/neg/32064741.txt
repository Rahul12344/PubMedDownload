Eating disorders and substance use disorders frequently co-occur. Twin studies
reveal shared genetic variance between liabilities to eating disorders and
substance use, with the strongest associations between symptoms of bulimia
nervosa and problem alcohol use (genetic correlation [rg ], twin-based =
0.23-0.53). We estimated the genetic correlation between eating disorder and
substance use and disorder phenotypes using data from genome-wide association
studies (GWAS). Four eating disorder phenotypes (anorexia nervosa [AN], AN with
binge eating, AN without binge eating, and a bulimia nervosa factor score), and
eight substance-use-related phenotypes (drinks per week, alcohol use disorder
[AUD], smoking initiation, current smoking, cigarettes per day, nicotine
dependence, cannabis initiation, and cannabis use disorder) from eight studies
were included. Significant genetic correlations were adjusted for variants
associated with major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. Total study sample
sizes per phenotype ranged from ~2400 to ~537 000 individuals. We used linkage
disequilibrium score regression to calculate single nucleotide polymorphism-based
genetic correlations between eating disorder- and substance-use-related
phenotypes. Significant positive genetic associations emerged between AUD and AN 
(rg = 0.18; false discovery rate q = 0.0006), cannabis initiation and AN (rg =
0.23; q < 0.0001), and cannabis initiation and AN with binge eating (rg = 0.27; q
= 0.0016). Conversely, significant negative genetic correlations were observed
between three nondiagnostic smoking phenotypes (smoking initiation, current
smoking, and cigarettes per day) and AN without binge eating (rgs = -0.19 to
-0.23; qs < 0.04). The genetic correlation between AUD and AN was no longer
significant after co-varying for major depressive disorder loci. The patterns of 
association between eating disorder- and substance-use-related phenotypes
highlights the potentially complex and substance-specific relationships among
these behaviors.
