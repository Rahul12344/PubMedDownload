Quantitative and species compositions of yeast contaminating eggs, fry and
fingerlings of Salmo gairdneri Rich under artificial breeding have been studied. 
Prevalence of species of genera Candida, Rhodotorula, Cryptococcus and
Debaryomyces is noted. Yeast isolated from perished eggs and sick fry do not
possess pathogenic properties. Certain strains of yeast make stimulating effect
on the studied microorganisms.
