Infection control. A clean bill of health.

Moore A.

Lat year the Health Commission detailed findings that contributed to two
infection outbreaks at the Kent trust. C difficile rates within the trust in the 
first quarter of this year were 73 per cent lower than in 20007 Plans to set up a
200-strong patient council to give feedback to the board are underway. The trust 
is projecting a financial deficit of pound 3.8m for the current year. Staff
recruitment has been largely unaffected by the bad publicity and changes within
the organisation.
