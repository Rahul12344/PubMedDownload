The aim of this study was to evaluate reliability of identification and
determination of sensitivity to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics of some
Enterobacteriaceae strains in 49 sanitary-epidemiological stations. All
laboratories engaged in this study received 4 strains each (S. marcescens
phenotype ESBL+, K. pneumoniae phenotype ESBL+, S. Typhimurium and S. Newport)
previously identified in the Department of Bacteriology of National Institute of 
Hygiene. The laboratories included in the survey were asked to determine the
genus (serovar) of each control strain using the lowest number of biochemical
test recommended by Institute and to determine of the sensitivity of the
identified strains to antibiotics in accordance with the guidelines of the NCCLS 
and domestic recommendations. Only in 2 participating laboratories the
identification of one of studied strains (K. pneumoniae) was completely bad and
in 9 laboratories the serological identification of S. Newport was incomplete or 
serological type was not correctly recognised. In the determination of the
sensitivity of the control strains to chemotherapeutic agents abnormalities were 
found in the technique of antibiogram and test for ESBL performing and incorrect 
selection of disc for antibiograms as well as erroneous interpretation of the
results.
