OBJECTIVE: This investigation evaluated the knowledge of dental caries and
periodontal disease among removable partial denture (RPD) wearers.
METHOD: A total of 127 partially dentate patients participated in this
observational study. A structured questionnaire, which included eight questions
referring to knowledge about aetiology and prevention of dental caries and
periodontal disease, was developed in the local language (Portuguese) and used to
collect the data of all the partial denture wearers. A descriptive analysis of
data was performed by means of drafting tables.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that 68.5% of patients interviewed had
previously received information about oral health care. With regard to bacterial 
plaque, it was observed that only 34.6% reported having knowledge of this.
Whereas, in relation to caries, 76.4% of the interviewees replied that they knew 
the meaning of this. Nevertheless, 28.3% referred to caries as a whole in the
teeth, 16.5% as bad teeth and 9.4% bacteria/creatures on the teeth. Only 17.3% of
the partially edentulous patients evaluated were shown to know what disease of
the gingiva was.
CONCLUSION: By means of the methodology applied, it could be concluded that the
patients who wore RPDs presented deficient knowledge with regard to the
prevention, aetiology and development of dental caries and periodontal disease.
