Calmodulin-like protein from Bacillus subtilis.

Fry IJ, Villa L, Kuehn GD, Hageman JH.

The first example of a calmodulin-like activity in a Gram-positive bacterium,
Bacillus subtilis, is reported. A calcium ion-dependent, 3', 5' cyclic-AMP
phosphodiesterase-stimulating activity was found in the soluble fraction of
cell-free extracts of cells sporulating in a chemically-defined medium;
activation was reversed by trifluoperazine. The activity was heat stable, bound
to phenothiazine-agarose in a calcium ion-dependent manner and was eluted
therefrom with buffer containing EGTA, and displaced authentic beef brain
calmodulin from its antibody in a radioimmunoassay.
