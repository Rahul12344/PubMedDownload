This is a review of research that supports a hypothesis regarding early
restriction of gene expression in the vertebrate embryo. We hypothesize that
vertebrate retinoic acid receptors (RARs for several vertebrates but rars for
zebrafish) are part of an embryonic, epigenetic switch whose default position, at
the time of fertilization is "OFF". This is due to the assemblage of a
rar-corepressor-histone deacetylase complex on retinoic acid response elements
(RAREs) in regulatory regions of a subset of genes. In addition, selective and
precise allocation of retinoic acid during early development through the
interaction of Phase I enzymes throws the switch "ON" in a predictable,
developmental manner. We are proposing that this is a basic, early embryonic
switch that can cause the initiation of cascades of gene expression that are
responsible for at least some early, diversification of cell phenotypes.
Dehydrogenases and a subset of cytochrome p450 genes (cyp26a1, cyp26b1, and
cyp26c1) play the major role in providing the retinoic acid and limiting its
access. We also suggest that this mechanism may be playing a significant role in 
the repression of genes in undifferentiated stem cells.
