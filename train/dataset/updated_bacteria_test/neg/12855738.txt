The AIDA-I autotransporter adhesin, as a prototype of the AIDA adhesin family,
represents a tripartite antigen consisting of the functional adhesin AIDA-I
(alpha-domain), which mediates the specific attachment of bacteria to target
cells, and a two-domain translocator (AIDA(c)) organized in the beta(1)- and
beta(2)-domains. Cellular receptor moieties for the adhesin AIDA-I have not been 
identified. Here, it is demonstrated that the purified adhesin binds specifically
to a high-affinity class of receptors on HeLa cells. Additionally, the adhesin
was found to bind to a variety of mammalian cell types, indicating a broad tissue
distribution of the receptor moiety. By using complementary techniques, including
co-immunoprecipitation and one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the
AIDA-I binding protein on HeLa cells was identified as a surface glycoprotein of 
about 119 kDa (gp119). The gp119 AIDA-I cellular receptor protein was
characterized biochemically and found to be an integral N-glycosylated membrane
protein with a pI of 5.2.
