Whipple's disease (WD) is a chronic debilitating disease caused by the bacillus
Tropheryma whippleii. WD classically presents with the main clinical symptoms of 
polyarthralgias, chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Given its
systemic involvement, it is common for WD to present with a multitude of other
clinical scenarios--sometimes with predominant neurologic, cardiac, and
dermatologic manifestations. WD can occur at any age, but it generally occurs
during the fifth decade and predominantly in men. The diagnosis of WD is
established by demonstrating the organism on biopsies from the involved system,
by histology, electron microscopy, polymerase chain reaction, and more recently, 
by culture of bacteria. The histologic features include a coarse granular
cytoplasm and foamy macrophages that stain strongly with the period-acid Schiff
reagent. Current therapy includes an initial 2-week course of intravenous
cephalosporins followed by 1-year oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
