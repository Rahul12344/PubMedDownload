History revealed a chronic obstructive pulmonary condition which had been treated
with prednisolone for a long time. There was a raised temperature with further
signs of an acute inflammatory underlying disease and internal hydrocephalus.
After performing trepanation, the symptoms of raised intercerebral pressure
ceased. Candida albicans could be detected microbiologically in the cerebrospinal
fluid. There was no pneumonia at the time of admission. Despite instituting
immediate intensive care with administration of antibiotics and antimycotics, the
patient died 11 days after inpatient admission. Autopsy revealed a C. albicans
mycosis originating from the right middle ear with extensive suppurative
meningitis, which was the immediate cause of death. Confluent bronchopneumonia
had developed in both lower lung lobes at the time of death, but did not show any
signs of mycosis and had contributed indirectly to the death of the patient.
