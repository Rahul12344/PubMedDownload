CD1d-restricted natural killer T (NKT) cells are innate lymphocytes that play a
regulatory role during an immune response. The identification of
alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer), a marine sponge-derived
glycosphingolipid, as a potent stimulator of NKT cells led many laboratories to
investigate the effects of NKT cell activation on the regulation of immune
responses. These studies revealed that alpha-GalCer induces rapid and robust
cytokine production by NKT cells, secondary activation of a variety of innate and
adaptive immune cells, and modulation of Th cell responses. Further, alpha-GalCer
influences disease progression in a variety of experimental models of
autoimmunity and inflammation in mice, including models for type 1 diabetes,
multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus,
inflammatory bowel disease, and atherosclerosis. While these studies have raised 
significant enthusiasm for manipulation of NKT cells as a means of preventing
autoimmunity in the clinical setting, there are significant concerns regarding
the safety of repeated alpha-GalCer injections in human subjects.
