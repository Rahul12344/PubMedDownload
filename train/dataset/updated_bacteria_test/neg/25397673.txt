Severe pneumonia remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been shown to be more sensitive than current 
standard microbiological methods--particularly in patients with prior antibiotic 
treatment--and therefore, may improve the accuracy of microbiological diagnosis
for hospitalized patients with pneumonia. Conventional detection techniques and
multiplex PCR for 14 typical bacterial pneumonia-associated pathogens were
performed on respiratory samples collected from adult hospitalized patients
enrolled in a prospective multi-center study. Patients were enrolled from March
until September 2012. A total of 739 fresh, native samples were eligible for
analysis, of which 75 were sputa, 421 aspirates, and 234 bronchial lavages. 276
pathogens were detected by microbiology for which a valid PCR result was
generated (positive or negative detection result by Curetis prototype system).
Among these, 120 were identified by the prototype assay, 50 pathogens were not
detected. Overall performance of the prototype for pathogen identification was
70.6% sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI) lower bound: 63.3%, upper bound: 
76.9%) and 95.2% specificity (95% CI lower bound: 94.6%, upper bound: 95.7%).
Based on the study results, device cut-off settings were adjusted for future
series production. The overall performance with the settings of the CE series
production devices was 78.7% sensitivity (95% CI lower bound: 72.1%) and 96.6%
specificity (95% CI lower bound: 96.1%). Time to result was 5.2 hours (median)
for the prototype test and 43.5 h for standard-of-care. The Pneumonia Application
provides a rapid and moderately sensitive assay for the detection of
pneumonia-causing pathogens with minimal hands-on time.TRIAL REGISTRATION:
