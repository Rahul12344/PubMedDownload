A thermophilic strain (D2) identified as a Bacillus sp. was isolated from an
aerobic digestor of swine waste after several months of operation at 55 degrees
C. Aerobic thermophilic batch treatment of swine waste inoculated with strain D2 
was studied in a 4-liter fixed-bed reactor. Stabilization of the waste was
achieved in less than 30 h when the original chemical oxygen demand (COD) was
between 15 and 20 g/liter or in less than 48 h when the COD was around 35
g/liter. When the COD was higher than 30 g/liter, the pH of the waste reached 9.2
to 9.5 during the treatment, and periodic adjustment of the pH to 8.5 was
necessary to maintain the activity of the biofilm. In this reactor, ammoniacal
nitrogen was completely eliminated by desorption in less than 72 h of incubation.
The different packing materials used resulted in similar rates of degradation of 
organic matter. The thermophilic treatment was also efficient in the 75-liter
digestor, and stabilization was achieved in approximately 50 h. A bank of 22
thermophilic bacterial strains originating from different environments and
adapted to the thermophilic treatment of swine waste was established. This
thermophilic treatment allows, in one step, rapid stabilization of the waste,
elimination of the bad smell, and complete elimination of ammonia nitrogen by
stripping.
