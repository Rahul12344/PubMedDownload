The Kunitz type protease inhibitor aprotinin, containing three intramolecular
disulfide bonds, was expressed on the surface of Escherichia coli by Autodisplay.
For this purpose, the aprotinin gene was fused in-frame to the transporter domain
encoding DNA region of the AIDA-I autotransporter protein. Culture of cells
supplied with the artificial gene at reducing conditions resulted in the
translocation of aprotinin to the cell surface. Correct folding of aprotinin was 
shown by high affinity to its target enzyme HLE. No surface translocation was
detectable under non-reducing conditions, indicating the degradation of aprotinin
in the periplasm. By the use of periplasmic-protease defective E. coli strains
PW147, PW151, and PW152, under non-reducing conditions, significant amounts of
aprotinin appeared in the periplasm but not at the surface. Our results indicate 
that aprotinin molecules, reaching stable conformation before transport across
the outer membrane, are degraded in the periplasm due to proteolysis. In case
folding can be prevented, i.e., by blocking disulfide bond formation in the
periplasm, aprotinin is translocated and can adopt its active conformation at the
cell surface.
