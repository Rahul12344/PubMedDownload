Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference can understand the growth and development
of animals and plants, and reveal the mystery of biology. Many computational
approaches have been proposed to infer GRN. However, these inference approaches
have hardly met the need of modeling, and the reducing redundancy methods based
on individual information theory method have bad universality and stability. To
overcome the limitations and shortcomings, this thesis proposes a novel
algorithm, named HSCVFNT, to infer gene regulatory network with time-delayed
regulations by utilizing a hybrid scoring method and complex-valued flexible
neural network (CVFNT). The regulations of each target gene can be obtained by
iteratively performing HSCVFNT. For each target gene, the HSCVFNT algorithm
utilizes a novel scoring method based on time-delayed mutual information (TDMI), 
time-delayed maximum information coefficient (TDMIC) and time-delayed correlation
coefficient (TDCC), to reduce the redundancy of regulatory relationships and
obtain the candidate regulatory factor set. Then, the TDCC method is utilized to 
create time-delayed gene expression time-series matrix. Finally, a complex-valued
flexible neural tree model is proposed to infer the time-delayed regulations of
each target gene with the time-delayed time-series matrix. Three real time-series
expression datasets from (Save Our Soul) SOS DNA repair system in E. coli and
Saccharomyces cerevisiae are utilized to evaluate the performance of the HSCVFNT 
algorithm. As a result, HSCVFNT obtains outstanding F-scores of 0.923, 0.8 and
0.625 for SOS network and (In vivo Reverse-Engineering and Modeling Assessment)
IRMA network inference, respectively, which are 5.5%, 14.3% and 72.2% higher than
the best performance of other state-of-the-art GRN inference methods and
time-delayed methods.
