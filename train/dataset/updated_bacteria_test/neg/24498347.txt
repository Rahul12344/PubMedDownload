Soluble fibres (non-starch polysaccharides, NSP) from edible plants but
particularly plantain banana (Musa spp.), have been shown in vitro and ex vivo to
prevent various enteric pathogens from adhering to, or translocating across, the 
human intestinal epithelium, a property that we have termed contrabiotic. Here we
report that dietary plantain fibre prevents invasion of the chicken intestinal
mucosa by Salmonella. In vivo experiments were performed with chicks fed from
hatch on a pellet diet containing soluble plantain NSP (0 to 200 mg/d) and orally
infected with S.Typhimurium 4/74 at 8 d of age. Birds were sacrificed 3, 6 and 10
d post-infection. Bacteria were enumerated from liver, spleen and caecal
contents. In vitro studies were performed using chicken caecal crypts and porcine
intestinal epithelial cells infected with Salmonella enterica serovars following 
pre-treatment separately with soluble plantain NSP and acidic or neutral
polysaccharide fractions of plantain NSP, each compared with saline vehicle.
Bacterial adherence and invasion were assessed by gentamicin protection assay. In
vivo dietary supplementation with plantain NSP 50 mg/d reduced invasion by
S.Typhimurium, as reflected by viable bacterial counts from splenic tissue, by
98.9% (95% CI, 98.1-99.7; P<0.0001). In vitro studies confirmed that plantain NSP
(5-10 mg/ml) inhibited adhesion of S.Typhimurium 4/74 to a porcine epithelial
cell-line (73% mean inhibition (95% CI, 64-81); P<0.001) and to primary chick
caecal crypts (82% mean inhibition (95% CI, 75-90); P<0.001). Adherence
inhibition was shown to be mediated via an effect on the epithelial cells and
Ussing chamber experiments with ex-vivo human ileal mucosa showed that this
effect was associated with increased short circuit current but no change in
electrical resistance. The inhibitory activity of plantain NSP lay mainly within 
the acidic/pectic (homogalacturonan-rich) component. Supplementation of chick
feed with plantain NSP was well tolerated and shows promise as a simple approach 
for reducing invasive salmonellosis.
