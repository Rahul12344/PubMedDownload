The molecular nature of the defect in two mouse antigen processing-defective cell
lines was examined. Both mutants were derived from the A20 (BALB/c, H2d) B cell
line, and both were found to have defects in the H2-DMa gene. Mutant 3A5 exhibits
severely reduced amounts of H2-DMa message, and no detectable DMalpha protein.
cDNA sequence revealed a C-->T transition at nucleotide 118, introducing a
premature stop codon in exon 2 of the H2-DMa gene. In contrast, mutant 2A2
exhibits reduced but detectable levels of H2-DMa message and DMalpha protein only
after treatment with IL-4, which induces the expression of both the H2-DMa and
the H2-DMb genes in B cells. In this mutant the cDNA sequence revealed a missense
mutation in exon 3 resulting in the conversion of a conserved proline residue in 
the Ig-like domain to serine. Stable transfection with full-length H2-DMa cDNA
reconstitutes the antigen processing capacity of both mutants, as demonstrated by
the ability to present native antigen to T cell clones, and by restored class II 
SDS stability.
