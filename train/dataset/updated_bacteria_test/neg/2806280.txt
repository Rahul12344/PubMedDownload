Intracranial mycotic aneurysms (IMA) occur in 1-3% of all infective endocarditis.
Although spontaneous resolution was evidenced on serial angiograms in many
asymptomatic cases, the prognosis, if they rupture, is reported to be worse and
partly contingent on the therapeutic approach. Among 12 patients (six acute and
six subacute endocarditis) with ruptured IMA, six were treated surgically and
four were treated medically. Two patients died during rupture before any
treatment could be started. Six patients had a sudden rupture manifested by coma,
less clear consciousness seizures, hemiparesis unilateral mydriasis. CT-Scan
showed intracerebral, intraventricular and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Ten
angiograms showed 11 IMA. For patients with ruptured IMA, the decision for
surgical treatment was made in the presence of deepening coma and extensive
mass-lesion on CT-scan (one of six died in the postoperative period). Others
received medical treatment (four cases: all survived) and were followed-up with
serial angiographies. Of the nine patients who survived, five remained free of
any disability 1-4 years later. We suggest that the prognosis of ruptured IMA
(25% mortality rate) is not as bad as previously reported if surgery following
angiography is performed early in the presence of deepening coma and extensive
lesion.
