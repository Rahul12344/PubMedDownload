To complement established rational and evolutionary protein design approaches,
significant efforts are being made to utilize computational modeling and the
diversity of naturally occurring protein sequences. Here, we combine structural
biology, genomic mining, and computational modeling to identify structural
features critical to aldehyde deformylating oxygenases (ADOs), an enzyme family
that has significant implications in synthetic biology and chemoenzymatic
synthesis. Through these efforts, we discovered latent ADO-like function across
the ferritin-like superfamily in various species of Bacteria and Archaea. We
created a machine learning model that uses protein structural features to
discriminate ADO-like activity. Computational enzyme design tools were then
utilized to introduce ADO-like activity into the small subunit of Escherichia
coli class I ribonucleotide reductase. The integrated approach of genomic mining,
structural biology, molecular modeling, and machine learning has the potential to
be utilized for rapid discovery and modulation of functions across enzyme
families.
