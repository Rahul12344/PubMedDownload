AIM: To identify genes associated with gastric precancerous lesions in
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-susceptible ethnic Malays.
METHODS: Twenty-three Malay subjects with H. pylori infection and gastric
precancerous lesions identified during endoscopy were included as "cases".
Thirty-seven Malay subjects who were H. pylori negative and had no precancerous
lesions were included as "controls". Venous blood was collected for genotyping
with Affymetrix 50K Xba1 kit. Genotypes with call rates < 90% for autosomal
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were excluded. For each precancerous
lesion, associated SNPs were identified from Manhattan plots, and only SNPs with 
a χ² P value < 0.05 and Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium P value > 0.5 was considered
as significant markers.
RESULTS: Of the 23 H. pylori-positive subjects recruited, one sample was excluded
from further analysis due to a low genotyping call rate. Of the 22 H.
pylori-positive samples, atrophic gastritis only was present in 50.0%, complete
intestinal metaplasia was present in 18.25%, both incomplete intestinal
metaplasia and dysplasia was present in 22.7%, and dysplasia only was present in 
9.1%. SNPs rs9315542 (UFM1 gene), rs6878265 (THBS4 gene), rs1042194 (CYP2C19
gene) and rs10505799 (MGST1 gene) were significantly associated with atrophic
gastritis, complete intestinal metaplasia, incomplete metaplasia with foci of
dysplasia and dysplasia, respectively. Allele frequencies in "cases" vs
"controls" for rs9315542, rs6878265, rs1042194 and rs10505799 were 0.4 vs 0.06,
0.6 vs 0.01, 0.6 vs 0.01 and 0.5 vs 0.02, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Genetic variants possibly related to gastric precancerous lesions in 
ethnic Malays susceptible to H. pylori infection were identified for testing in
subsequent trials.
