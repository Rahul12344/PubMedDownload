NKT and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells express semi-invariant TCR
and restriction by nonclassical MHC class Ib molecules. Despite common features, 
the respective development of NKT and MAIT subsets is distinct. NKTs proliferate 
extensively and acquire effector properties prior to thymic export. MAIT cells
exit the thymus as naive cells and acquire an effector/memory phenotype in a
process requiring both commensal flora and B cells. During thymic development,
NKTs are selected by CD1d-expressing cortical thymocytes; however, the
hematopoietic cell type responsible for MAIT cell selection remains unresolved.
Using reaggregated thymic organ culture and bone marrow chimeras, we demonstrate 
that positive selection of mouse iVα19 transgenic and Vβ6 transgenic MAIT cell
progenitors requires MHC-related 1-expressing CD4(+)CD8(+) double positive
thymocytes, whereas thymic B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cell subsets are
dispensable. Preincubation of double positive thymocytes with exogenous bacterial
ligand increases MHC-related 1 surface expression and enhances mature MAIT cell
activation in the in vitro cocultures. The revelation of a common cell type for
the selection of both NKT and MAIT subsets raises questions about the mechanisms 
underlying acquisition of their specific features.
