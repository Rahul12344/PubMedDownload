Schistosomiasis remains one of the most prevalent parasitic diseases worldwide
and the infection is frequently found in travelers and migrants. The European
Network for Tropical Medicine and Travel Health conducted a sentinel surveillance
study on imported schistosomiasis between 1997 and 2010. This report summarizes
epidemiological and clinical data from 1,465 cases of imported schistosomiasis.
Direct pathogen detection and serology were the main diagnostic tools applied. Of
these, 486 (33%) cases were identified among European travelers, 231 (16%) among 
long-term expatriates, and 748 (51%) among non-European immigrants. Overall, only
18.6% of travelers had received pretravel advice; 95% of infections were acquired
in the African region. On species level, Schistosoma mansoni was identified in
570 (39%) and Schistosoma haematobium in 318 (22%) cases; 57.5% of patients were 
symptomatic. Acute symptoms were reported in 27% of patients leading to earlier
presentation within 3 months. Praziquantel was used in all patients to treat
schistosomiasis. Many infections were detected in asymptomatic patients. In 47.4%
of asymptomatic patients infection was detected by microscopy and in 39% by
serology or antigen testing. Schistosomiasis remains a frequent infection in
travelers and migrants to Europe. Travelers should be made aware of the risk of
schistosomiasis infection when traveling to sub-Saharan Africa. Posttravel
consultations particularly for returning expatriates are useful given the high
potential for detecting asymptomatic infections.
