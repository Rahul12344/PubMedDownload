Peptide deformylase (PDF) is essential in prokaryotes and absent in mammalian
cells, thus making it an attractive target for the discovery of novel
antibiotics. We have identified actinonin, a naturally occurring antibacterial
agent, as a potent PDF inhibitor. The dissociation constant for this compound was
0.3 x 10(-)(9) M against Ni-PDF from Escherichia coli; the PDF from
Staphylococcus aureus gave a similar value. Microbiological evaluation revealed
that actinonin is a bacteriostatic agent with activity against Gram-positive and 
fastidious Gram-negative microorganisms. The PDF gene, def, was placed under
control of P(BAD) in E. coli tolC, permitting regulation of PDF expression levels
in the cell by varying the external arabinose concentration. The susceptibility
of this strain to actinonin increases with decreased levels of PDF expression,
indicating that actinonin inhibits bacterial growth by targeting this enzyme.
Actinonin provides an excellent starting point from which to derive a more potent
PDF inhibitor that has a broader spectrum of antibacterial activity.
