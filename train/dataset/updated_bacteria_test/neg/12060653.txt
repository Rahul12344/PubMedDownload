Mcm3 is a subunit of the hexameric MCM2-7 complex required for the initiation and
elongation of DNA replication in eukaryotes. We have characterized two mutant
alleles, mcm3-1 and mcm3-10, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and showed that they are
defective at different steps of the replication initiation process. Mcm3-10
contains a P118L substitution that compromises its interaction with Mcm5 and the 
recruitment of Mcm3 and Mcm7 to a replication origin. P118 is conserved between
Mcm3, Mcm4, Mcm5, and Mcm7. An identical substitution of this conserved residue
in Mcm5 (P83L of mcm5-bob1) strengthens the interaction between Mcm3 and Mcm5 and
allows cells to enter S phase independent of Cdc7-Dbf4 kinase (Hardy, C. F.,
Dryga, O., Pahl, P. M. B., and Sclafani, R. A. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.
S. A. 94, 3151-3155). Mcm3-1 contains a G246E mutation that diminishes the
efficiency of replication initiation (Yan, H., Merchant, A. M., and Tye, B. K.
(1993) Genes Dev. 7, 2149-2160) but not its interaction with Mcm5 or recruitment 
of the MCM2-7 complex to replication origin. These observations indicate that
Mcm3-10 is defective in a step before, and Mcm3-1 is defective in a step after
the recruitment of the MCM2-7 complex to replication origins.
