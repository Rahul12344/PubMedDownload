A 50-year-old alcoholic man with a 1-year history of pyrexia of unknown origin
was admitted with symptoms of endocarditis. Large vegetations on his mitral and
aortic valve were found on echocardiography. Using the Bactec 9240 system.
Bartonella quintana could be grown from two culture sets of blood collected
before the start of antimicrobial therapy. This is the first case report of
culture-proven bartonella infection in the UK. and is noteworthy because
Bartonella quintana was detected in conventional blood culture systems after
prolonged incubation.
