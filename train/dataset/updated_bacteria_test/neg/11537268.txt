The feasibility of using photosynthetic microalgae (cyanobacteria) as a subsystem
component for the CELSS program, with particular emphasis on the manipulation of 
the biomass (protein/carbohydrate) has been addressed. Using factors which retard
growth rates, but not photosynthetic electron flux, the partitioning of
photosynthetically derived reductant may be dictated towards CO2 fixation
(carbohydrate formation) and away from N2 fixation (protein formation). Cold
shock treatment of fairly dense cultures markedly increases the glycogen content 
from 1% to 35% (dry weight), and presents a useful technique to change the
protein/carbohydrate ratio of these organisms to a more nutritionally acceptable 
form.
