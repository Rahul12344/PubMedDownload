In the early 1990s, a breakthrough toothpaste, Colgate Total, was launched with
documented long-lasting activity against plaque, gingivitis, calculus, tooth
decay, and bad breath. The technology behind this toothpaste is the combination
of triclosan, a polyvinylmethylether/maleic acid copolymer, and sodium fluoride. 
The copolymer ensures maximal oral retention and subsequent release of the
antibacterial triclosan. Effective levels of triclosan have been observed in the 
oral cavity 12 hours after brushing the teeth, allowing prolonged control of oral
bacteria that may cause the most common dental problems, including bad breath.
Similarly, the enhanced retention of triclosan to oral surfaces after using this 
revolutionary toothpaste for up to 2 years has led to significantly reduced
incremental coronal caries compared to an American Dental Association-Approved
anticavity fluoride toothpaste. Furthermore, significantly less calcium remained 
in dental plaque after brushing the teeth with the triclosan/copolymer
toothpaste, resulting in the formation of less tartar. In keeping with the
multiple oral health benefits provided by Colgate Total, consumers are now
offered a new dentifrice, Colgate Total Advanced Fresh, which provides the
numerous therapeutic and esthetic benefits that are the hallmark of Colgate
Total. The new dentifrice, which contains an impactful breath-freshening flavor, 
has been documented to provide sustained control of bad breath over 12 hours.
