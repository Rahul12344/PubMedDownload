BACKGROUND: Cutibacterium acnes (C acnes) is a mysterious member of the shoulder 
microbiome and is associated with chronic postoperative complications and
low-grade infections. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether it represents a
contaminant or whether it accounts for true infections. Because it can persist
intracellularly in macrophages at several body sites, it might in fact be an
intra-articular commensal of the shoulder joint.
METHODS: In 23 consecutive, otherwise healthy patients (17 male, 6 female; 58
years) who had no previous injections, multiple specimens were taken from the
intra-articular tissue during first-time arthroscopic and open shoulder surgery. 
The samples were investigated by cultivation, genetic phylotyping, and
immunohistochemistry using C acnes-specific antibodies and confocal laser
scanning microscopy.
RESULTS: In 10 patients (43.5%), cultures were C acnes-positive. Phylotype IA1
dominated the subcutaneous samples (71%), whereas type II dominated the deep
tissue samples (57%). Sixteen of 23 patients (69.6%) were C acnes-positive by
immunohistochemistry; in total, 25 of 40 samples were positive (62.5%). Overall, 
56.3% of glenohumeral immunohistochemical samples, 62.5% of subacromial samples, 
and 75% of acromioclavicular (AC) joint samples were positive. In 62.5% of the
tested patients, C acnes was detected immunohistochemically to reside
intracellularly within stromal cells and macrophages.
DISCUSSION: These data indicate that C acnes is a commensal of the human shoulder
joint, where it persists within macrophages and stromal cells. Compared with
culture-based methods, immunohistochemical staining can increase C acnes
detection. Phylotype II seems to be most prevalent in the deep shoulder tissue.
The high detection rate of C acnes in osteoarthritic AC joints might link its
intra-articular presence to the initiation of osteoarthritis.
