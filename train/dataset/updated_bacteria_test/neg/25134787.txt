OBJECTIVE: Helper T (Th) cell responses are critical for the pathogenesis of
Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis. Th22 cells represent a newly discovered Th
cell subset, but their relevance to H. pylori-induced gastritis is unknown.
DESIGN: Flow cytometry, real-time PCR and ELISA analyses were performed to
examine cell, protein and transcript levels in gastric samples from patients and 
mice infected with H. pylori. Gastric tissues from interleukin (IL)-22-deficient 
and wild-type (control) mice were also examined. Tissue inflammation was
determined for pro-inflammatory cell infiltration and pro-inflammatory protein
production. Gastric epithelial cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) 
were isolated, stimulated and/or cultured for Th22 cell function assays.
RESULTS: Th22 cells accumulated in gastric mucosa of both patients and mice
infected with H. pylori. Th22 cell polarisation was promoted via the production
of IL-23 by dendritic cells (DC) during H. pylori infection, and resulted in
increased inflammation within the gastric mucosa. This inflammation was
characterised by the CXCR2-dependent influx of MDSCs, whose migration was induced
via the IL-22-dependent production of CXCL2 by gastric epithelial cells. Under
the influence of IL-22, MDSCs, in turn, produced pro-inflammatory proteins, such 
as S100A8 and S100A9, and suppressed Th1 cell responses, thereby contributing to 
the development of H. pylori-associated gastritis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study, therefore, identifies a novel regulatory network
involving H. pylori, DCs, Th22 cells, gastric epithelial cells and MDSCs, which
collectively exert a pro-inflammatory effect within the gastric microenvironment.
Efforts to inhibit this Th22-dependent pathway may therefore prove a valuable
strategy in the therapy of H. pylori-associated gastritis.
