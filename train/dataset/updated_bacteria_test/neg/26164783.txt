Sedimentary microorganisms can be used as a sensitive indicator of integrated
aquatic environment quality assessment and indicate long-term water quality or
toxicity. According to the Chinese National Standards of GB 3838-2002 and GB
18918-2002, the comprehensive water quality in Haihe River Basin has been
described. Results showed that the comprehensive water quality in 6 sites, 4
sites, and 20 sites were good, bad, and medium. Furthermore, 162 dominant
bacterial species were identified in surface and subsurface sediments in the 30
sampling sites. As revealed by two initial models constructed by logistic
regression, the comprehensive water quality exhibited a pattern from good to bad 
as the ratio of the number of dominant bacterial species in surface sediments to 
that in subsurface sediments increased from 1 to 2.1. This finding possibly
bridged a traditional gap between aquatic microbe indicators and water quality
assessment or monitoring techniques.
