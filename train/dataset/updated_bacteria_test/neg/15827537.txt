Gastric cancer (GC) is the world's second leading cause of cancer-related
mortality, and carries a bad prognosis. In 1994, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) 
has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a group
I carcinogen. There are increasing indications that this infection is associated 
with both the initiation and progress of gastric carcinoma and lymphoma. Evidence
supporting a causal association has been demonstrated by epidemiological data and
in experimental animal models. Despite this, there is still lack of final
conclusion regarding the association between the infection and the malignancy due
both to marked geographic variations and heterogeneity in study designs. Given
the high rate of morbidity and mortality associated with GC, any means of
reducing the occurrence of the disease or increase its early detection is most
desirable. In this paper, the epidemiological aspects on the evidence of a causal
relationship between H. pylori and GC are discussed. Prospective cohort studies
and interventional trials focused on the effects of H. pylori eradication on
lesions predisposing to GC should be performed in order to provide further data.
