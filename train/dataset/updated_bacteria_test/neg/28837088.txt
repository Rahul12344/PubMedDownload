This study seeks to investigate the possible protective role of the methanol
extract of Piper guineense seeds against CCl₄-induced hepatotoxicity in an animal
model. Hepatotoxicity was induced by administering oral doses of CCl₄ (1.2 g/kg
bw) three times a week for three weeks. Group 1 (Control) and Group 2 (CCl₄) were
left untreated; Piper guineense (PG; 400 mg/kg bw) was administered to Group 3
(T₁) by oral gavage for 14 days prior to the administration of CCl₄ and
simultaneously with CCl₄; PG (400 mg/kg bw) was administered simultaneously with 
CCl₄ in Group 4 (T₂); and Livolin forte (20 mg/kg bw) was administered
simultaneously with CCl₄ in Group 5 (T₃), the standard drug group. The
administration of CCl₄ induces histopathological alteration in the liver, with
concomitant increased activities of serum hepatic marker enzymes associated with 
increased levels of lipid peroxidation. Similarly, there was decrease in
non-enzymatic (reduced glutathione) and enzymatic antioxidants (glutathione
S-transferase), superoxide dismutase, and catalase. An elevation in serum
triglyceride and total cholesterol levels was noticed along with decreased levels
of serum total protein. Treatment with PG 400 mg/kg bw exhibited excellent
modulatory activity with respect to the different parameters studied by reversing
all the above-mentioned biochemical changes significantly in the experimental
animals. These results suggest that PG offered protection comparable to that of
Livolin forte with better efficacy when pre-treated with 400 mg/kg bw 14 days
prior to CCl₄-exposure.
