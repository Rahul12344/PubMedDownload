The evolutionarily conserved centromeric histone H3 variant (Cse4 in budding
yeast, CENP-A in humans) is essential for faithful chromosome segregation.
Mislocalization of CENP-A to non-centromeric chromatin contributes to chromosomal
instability (CIN) in yeast, fly, and human cells and CENP-A is highly expressed
and mislocalized in cancers. Defining mechanisms that prevent mislocalization of 
CENP-A is an area of active investigation. Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of
overexpressed Cse4 (GALCSE4) by E3 ubiquitin ligases such as Psh1 prevents
mislocalization of Cse4, and psh1 Δ strains display synthetic dosage lethality
(SDL) with GALCSE4 We previously performed a genome-wide screen and identified
five alleles of CDC7 and DBF4 that encode the Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK)
complex, which regulates DNA replication initiation, among the top twelve hits
that displayed SDL with GALCSE4 We determined that cdc7 -7 strains exhibit
defects in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of Cse4 and show mislocalization of
Cse4 Mutation of MCM5 (mcm5 -bob1) bypasses the requirement of Cdc7 for
replication initiation and rescues replication defects in a cdc7 -7 strain. We
determined that mcm5 -bob1 does not rescue the SDL and defects in proteolysis of 
GALCSE4 in a cdc7 -7 strain, suggesting a DNA replication-independent role for
Cdc7 in Cse4 proteolysis. The SDL phenotype, defects in ubiquitin-mediated
proteolysis, and the mislocalization pattern of Cse4 in a cdc7 -7 psh1 Δ strain
were similar to that of cdc7 -7 and psh1 Δ strains, suggesting that Cdc7
regulates Cse4 in a pathway that overlaps with Psh1 Our results define a DNA
replication initiation-independent role of DDK as a regulator of Psh1-mediated
proteolysis of Cse4 to prevent mislocalization of Cse4.
