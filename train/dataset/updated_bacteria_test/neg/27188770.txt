BACKGROUND: Meticillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) are pathogens of increasing 
importance to human and animal health worldwide. Transmission of
meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) between animals and humans has 
been well documented. By contrast, information about transmission of other
Staphylococcus spp. is limited.
HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to screen animals and humans on 
a small farm for nasal carriage of MRS and to assess interspecies exchange.
METHODS: After detection of MRSA in a lung sample of a deceased cat, which lived 
on a small mixed farm, nasal swabs were taken within two weeks, four and
16 months from other animals of various species and humans living on the farm.
Swabs were cultured for MRS which were then characterized molecularly.
RESULTS: MRSA and meticillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (MRCoNS),
including Staphylococcus haemolyticus, S. epidermidis and S. fleurettii, were
isolated from humans and different animal species. Typing of the MRS revealed
isolates with the same characteristics in different human and animal hosts.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this 
is the first report of carriage of both MRSA and MRCoNS among humans and various 
animals within a shared environment. The detection of strains with
indistinguishable molecular characteristics strongly suggested transmission of
these MRS between the various animal species and humans.
