In a broad genomics analysis to find novel protein targets for antibiotic
discovery, MurF was identified as an essential gene product for Streptococcus
pneumonia that catalyzes a critical reaction in the biosynthesis of the
peptidoglycan in the formation of the cell wall. Lacking close relatives in
mammalian biology, MurF presents attractive characteristics as a potential drug
target. Initial screening of the Abbott small-molecule compound collection
identified several compounds for further validation as pharmaceutical leads. Here
we report the integrated efforts of NMR and X-ray crystallography, which reveal
the multidomain structure of a MurF-inhibitor complex in a compact conformation
that differs dramatically from related structures. The lead molecule is bound in 
the substrate-binding region and induces domain closure, suggestive of the domain
arrangement for the as yet unobserved transition state conformation for MurF
enzymes. The results form a basis for directed optimization of the compound lead 
by structure-based design to explore the suitability of MurF as a pharmaceutical 
target.
