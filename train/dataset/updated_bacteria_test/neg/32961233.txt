INTRODUCTION: UDP-N-acetylmuramic-alanine ligase (MurC) is an enzyme catalyzing
the addition of L-alanine to UDP-acetylmuramoyl nucleotide precursor in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). This enzyme is a prerequisite for
the biosynthesis of the peptidoglycans in M. tuberculosis.
AIM: This study aimed to identify the novel inhibitors of MurC using in silico
approach.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The three dimensional (3D) structure of MurC was
determined using comparative modeling and based on the template obtained from
Haemophilus influenza (1P31). The structural analysis of the model structure
shown that three residues (Lys126, Glu170, and Glu358) are critical for in the
catalytic activity of the enzyme, and their inhibition will block the function of
the enzyme. Ten thousand and ninety-five (10095) compounds obtained through
virtual screening against Zinc and PubChem databases based on their ability to
bind to MurC with minimum binding energies. These ligands screened for the
physicochemical properties, molecular docking, and pharmacokinetic analyses.
FINDING: Six compounds had desirable physicochemical and pharmacokinetic
properties with excellent binding energy ranged between -12.27 and
-10.09 kcal/mol. These compounds subjected to Molecular Dynamic (MD) Simulation
and Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) analyses. The
outcome of the analysis revealed that four ligands (PubChem1548994, ZINC11882115,
ZINC22241774, and ZINC12330603) formed a stable conformation in the
substrate-binding site of the protein during the 50 ns MD simulation.
CONCLUSION: Therefore, the ligands mentioned above might regard as novel
inhibitors of M. tuberculosis which requires further in vitro and in vivo
validation.
