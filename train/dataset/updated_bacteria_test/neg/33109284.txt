The introduction of treatment and systematic vaccination has significantly
reduced diphtheria mortality; however, toxigenic strains continue to circulate
worldwide. The emergence of an indigenous diphtheria case with fatal outcome in
Greece, after 30 years, raised challenges for laboratory confirmation, clinical
and public health management. Toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae was isolated 
from an incompletely vaccinated 8-year-old boy with underlying conditions. The
child passed away due to respiratory distress syndrome, before the administration
of diphtheria antitoxin (DAT). All close contacts in family, school and hospital 
settings were investigated. Pharyngeal swabs were obtained to determine
asymptomatic carriage. Chemoprophylaxis was given for 7 days to all close
contacts and a booster dose to those incompletely vaccinated. Testing revealed a 
classmate, belonging to a subpopulation group (Roma), and incompletely
vaccinated, as an asymptomatic carrier with an indistinguishable toxigenic strain
(same novel multilocus sequence type, designated ST698). This case highlights the
role of asymptomatic carriage, as the entry of toxigenic strains into susceptible
populations can put individuals and their environment at risk. Maintenance of
high-level epidemiological and microbiological surveillance, implementation of
systematic vaccination in children and adults with primary and booster doses,
availability of a DAT stockpile, and allowing timely administration are the
cornerstone to prevent similar incidents in the future.
