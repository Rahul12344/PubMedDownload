BACKGROUND: Treatment and outcome of Candida spp infectious endocarditis in
children it most be based on treatment guidelines, however there are some
controversies.
AIM: To describe our experience on treatment of pediatric candidal infective
endocarditis.
METHODS: Analytic prospective study, from January 2006 to December 2017.
Parametric analysis for quantitative variable. Proportions were compared by χ2
and exact Fisher Test CI 95%. Mortality rate.
RESULTS: 25 episodes of Candida spp infective endocarditis were treated with
standard antifungal drugs. Mortality rate was higher on patients submited to
endocardic vegetation resection (66.7%) RR= 3.16, (χ2 p = 0.029), children with
lymphohemophagocytic syndrome (LHFS) (50 %) RR= 1.18 (χ2 = N.S.), in multidrug
resistant bacterial co infection (57.14%), RR = 2, (χ2 = NS) also thrombotic
endocarditis (88.9%) RR= 4.74 (χ2 p = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: Multidrug resistant bacteria co infection with Candida sp IE, LHFS,
and/or surgical treatment of endocardic vegetation, might be considered as bad
prognostic factors.
