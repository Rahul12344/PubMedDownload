Epidemiological studies have suggested that the recent increase in the incidence 
and severity of immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated allergic disorders is inversely
correlated with Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination;
however, the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. Here, we demonstrate that
natural killer T (NKT) cells in mice and humans play a crucial role in the
BCG-induced suppression of IgE responses. BCG-activated murine Valpha14 NKT
cells, but not conventional CD4 T cells, selectively express high levels of
interleukin (IL)-21, which preferentially induces apoptosis in Bepsilon cells.
Signaling from the IL-21 receptor increases the formation of a complex between
Bcl-2 and the proapoptotic molecule Bcl-2-modifying factor, resulting in Bepsilon
cell apoptosis. Similarly, BCG vaccination induces IL-21 expression by human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a partially NKT cell-dependent
fashion. BCG-activated PBMCs significantly reduce IgE production by human B
cells. These findings provide new insight into the therapeutic effect of BCG in
allergic diseases.
