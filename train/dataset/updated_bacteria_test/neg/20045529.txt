Infective endocarditis (IE) is a serious disease which can carry a bad prognosis 
if it is not appropriately treated. Sometimes the clinical evolution is
unfavourable despite an optimal medical therapy with antibiotics. Surgery in
these cases has an important role to eliminate the source of infection or to
perform a valve replacement. The surprising evolution of patients operated in
critic circumstances take us to analyze the role of early surgery. As physicians,
we need to know these patients' risks and to establish the adequate surgical
indications.
