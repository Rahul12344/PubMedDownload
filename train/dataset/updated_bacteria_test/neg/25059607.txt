Since the first metabolic labeling experiments with stable isotopes beginning of 
the last century, several approaches were pursued to monitor protein dynamics in 
living animals. Today, almost all model organisms from bacteria to rodents can be
fully labeled with SILAC (stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture)
amino acids. The development of special media and diets containing the labeled
amino acids provides an efficient way to metabolically label prokaryotic and
eukaryotic organisms. Preferentially, the essential amino acid lysine
((13)C6-lysine) is used to label mice (Mus musculus) and after one generation the
natural isotope is fully replaced by the stable (13)C6-lysine isotope. So far,
the SILAC mouse approach has been used to analyze several transgenic and knockout
mouse models. Spike-in of labeled proteins into non-labeled samples provides an
accurate relative protein quantification method without any chemical
modification. Here we describe how to establish a SILAC mouse colony and describe
the analysis of skeletal muscle tissue with different metabolic and contractile
profiles.
