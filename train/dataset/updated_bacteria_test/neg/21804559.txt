The most potent foreign antigens for natural killer T cells (NKT cells) are
α-linked glycolipids, whereas NKT cell self-reactivity involves weaker
recognition of structurally distinct β-linked glycolipid antigens. Here we
provide the mechanism for the autoreactivity of T cell antigen receptors (TCRs)
on NKT cells to the mono- and tri-glycosylated β-linked agonists
β-galactosylceramide (β-GalCer) and isoglobotrihexosylceramide (iGb3),
respectively. In binding these disparate antigens, the NKT cell TCRs docked onto 
CD1d similarly, achieving this by flattening the conformation of the β-linked
ligands regardless of the size of the glycosyl head group. Unexpectedly, the
antigenicity of iGb3 was attributable to its terminal sugar group making
compensatory interactions with CD1d. Thus, the NKT cell TCR molds the β-linked
self ligands to resemble the conformation of foreign α-linked ligands, which
shows that induced-fit molecular mimicry can underpin the self-reactivity of NKT 
cell TCRs to β-linked antigens.
