Saccharina japonica is a family member of Phaeophyceae (brown macro-alga) and
extensively cultivated in China, Japan and Korea. Here, the potential anti-cancer
effect of n-hexane fraction of S. japonica was evaluated in SK-Hep1 human
hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The N-hexane fraction reduced cell viability and 
increased the numbers of apoptotic cells in a both dose- and time-dependent
manner. Apoptosis was activated by both caspase-dependent and independent
pathways. The caspase-dependent cell death pathway is mediated by cell surface
death receptors and activated caspase-8 amplified the apoptotic signal either
through direct activation of downstream caspase-3 or pro-apoptotic proteins (Bad,
Bax and Bak) subsequently leading to the release of cytochrome c. On the other
hand, caspase-independent apoptosis appeared mediated by disruption of
mitochondrial membrane potential and translocation of AIF to the nucleus where
they induced chromatin condensation and/or large-scale DNA fragmentation. In
addition, the n-hexane fraction induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress and
cell cycle arrest. The results suggested that potential anti-cancer effects of
n-hexane extract from S. japonica on SK-Hep1 cells.
