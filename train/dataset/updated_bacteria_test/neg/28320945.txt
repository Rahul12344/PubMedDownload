We previously reported that single cells from a human colorectal cancer (CRC)
cell line (HCA-7) formed either hollow single-layered polarized cysts or solid
spiky masses when plated in 3D in type-I collagen. To begin in-depth analyses
into whether clonal cysts and spiky masses possessed divergent properties,
individual colonies of each morphology were isolated and expanded. The lines thus
derived faithfully retained their parental cystic and spiky morphologies and were
termed CC (cystic) and SC (spiky), respectively. Although both CC and SC
expressed EGF receptor (EGFR), the EGFR-neutralizing monoclonal antibody,
cetuximab, strongly inhibited growth of CC, whereas SC was resistant to growth
inhibition, and this was coupled to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of MET and
RON. Addition of the dual MET/RON tyrosine kinase inhibitor, crizotinib, restored
cetuximab sensitivity in SC. To further characterize these two lines, we
performed comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic analysis of CC and SC in 3D.
One of the most up-regulated genes in CC was the tumor suppressor 15-PGDH/HPGD,
and the most up-regulated gene in SC was versican (VCAN) in 3D and xenografts.
Analysis of a CRC tissue microarray showed that epithelial, but not stromal, VCAN
staining strongly correlated with reduced survival, and combined epithelial VCAN 
and absent HPGD staining portended a poorer prognosis. Thus, with this 3D system,
we have identified a mode of cetuximab resistance and a potential prognostic
marker in CRC. As such, this represents a potentially powerful system to identify
additional therapeutic strategies and disease-relevant genes in CRC and possibly 
other solid tumors.
