Background & Objective: Enterococcus Species are the common cause of nosocomial
infections, which are highly resistant to different antibiotics. Therefore,
determination of their antibiotic susceptibility patterns and simultaneous
resistance to antibiotics is important for better treatment strategies.
Methods: 400 clinical Enterococcus isolates were collected from different
hospitals in Tehran, Iran. Standard phenotypic-biochemical tests and PCR were
used to identify the Enterococcus species. The antimicrobial susceptibility
patterns and simultaneous resistance to selected antibiotics were determined by
disk diffusion method according to the CLSI guidelines. All data analysis was
performed using Python packages Scipy and Stats models.
Results: According to the biochemical and PCR analyses, among 400 Enterococcus
species, 72% of samples were Enterococcus faecalis, 10.75% Enterococcus faecium, 
and 17.25% other Enterococcus species. The results determined antimicrobial
resistances of these strains against gentamicin, vancomycin, fosfomycin
trometamol, teicoplanin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin. Results confirmed a
significant correlation between resistance to vancomycin and resistance to
teicoplanin. This correlation remains significant when including only E. faecium 
or E. faecalis species. We also found a negative correlation between resistance
to teicoplanin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. Additionally,
Quinupristin/dalfopristin was the least effective antibiotic while vancomycin and
teicoplanin were the most effective ones.
Conclusion: Based on the results and association between simultaneous resistance 
to some antibiotics such as vancomycin and teicoplanin, in the case of antibiotic
resistance, the choice of a second antibiotic can be very important which can
lead to good or bad effects.
