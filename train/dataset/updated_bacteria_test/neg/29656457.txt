BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (PCs) is still a
major challenge in transfusion medicine. Different methodologic concepts and
screening strategies have been developed and investigated concerning their
usability. We evaluated the feasibility of BacT/ALERT automated culture (BacT/A, 
bioMérieux) with late sampling after 3 days at the earliest.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-four bacterial strains isolated from PCs and six
relevant strains from reference stocks were spiked into apheresis-derived PCs
(10-60 colony-forming units [CFU]/bag). Sampling was performed after 3 days, and 
bacterial detection was investigated using the two detection methods (BacT/A and 
BactiFlow [BF], bioMérieux). The maximum time-to-result of BacT/A was set to less
than 12 hours.
RESULTS: All medium- or high-pathogenic strains are capable of proliferating to
high titers, and 100% of contaminated samples were detected by BF and BacT/A (6
to ≤12 h incubation); lower detection rates of BacT/A were obtained within 6
hours of incubation (≤6 h: 76.2-93.4%). The majority of low-pathogenic isolates
are also capable of growing in PCs (89.7%), showing a detection rate of 74.3% for
BF versus 54.3% for BacT/A (6 to ≤12 h incubation). BacT/A failed to detect
bacteria within 6 hours of incubation. Certainly, a small number of strains did
not grow under PC storage conditions and were detectable by BacT/A only with
increased detection times.
CONCLUSIONS: Late sampling after 3 days at the earliest, combined with reduced
BacT/A incubation following the negative-to-date concept, offer an alternative
opportunity to extend the shelf life of PCs from 4 to 5 days in Germany. The
sensitivity of BacT/A with late sampling is nearly comparable to BF; the
time-to-result is considerably longer.
