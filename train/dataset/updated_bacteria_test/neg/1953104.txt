The charts of 480 patients with secondary bacterial peritonitis were reviewed.
The antibiotics used were compared with the culture and sensitivity data obtained
at surgery, and the outcomes of patients were evaluated. Patients treated with a 
single broad-spectrum antibiotic had a better outcome than patients treated with 
multiple drug treatment. Inadequate empiric antibiotic treatment was associated
with poorer outcome than any other type of treatment. The outcome of this
inadequate treatment group could not be improved by any antibiotic response to
culture and sensitivity information after operation. Those patients treated with 
antibiotic coverage for anticipated organisms and having no cultures taken did as
well as patients having cultures taken. Surgeons typically ignore culture data
after operation, and only 8.8% of patients in this study had an appropriate
change in antibiotic treatment after operation. A benefit from obtaining
operative cultures could not be identified.
