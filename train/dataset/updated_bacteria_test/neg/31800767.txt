We aimed to investigate spatial and temporal scales, abundance, and factors that 
structure the communities of protozoans in a tropical urban stream.METHODS:
Samples of water for analysis of biological communities (testate amoebae,
ciliates and bacteria) and limnological variables were taken in the Mandacaru
stream located in the Conservation Unit of Parque do Cinquentenário, in the city 
of Maringá, Paraná State, Brazil, in two hydrological periods (dry and rainy). We
calculated the Water Quality Index (WQI) composed by nine parameters of water
quality (dissolved oxygen, thermotolerant coliforms, pH, BOD, water temperature, 
total nitrogen, total phosphorous, turbidity, and total solids), Trophic State
Index (TSI) for phosphorous and we used a Redundancy Analysis (RDA) to verify the
influence of environmental variables in the protozoan community.
RESULTS: The WQI showed that water quality was considered good in some points and
considered bad in other points. The TSI for phosphorus classified the stream as
mesotrophic in the majority of sampled sites points (mean between 53.09 and
58.35). We identified 19 taxa of testate amoebae, belonging to six families,
being Difflugiidae, Centropyxidae, and Arcellidae those with more species and 71 
infrageneric taxa of ciliates, distributed in 12 orders being Peniculida the most
representative order, followed by Euplotida. According to RDA analysis, samples
of the dry period were characterized by higher values of bacteria density and
concentrations of chlorophyll-a, total phosphorous, and total nitrogen. Ciliates 
and testate amoebae presented higher abundance values in some of the months
characterized by higher precipitation and in conditions of higher system
productivity.
CONCLUSION: we may conclude that the Mandacaru stream, although strongly
influenced by anthropic action, still presents an acceptable water quality.
Lastly, we emphasize that protists abundance was strongly influenced by system
productivity. This was evidenced by elevated protozoan densities where there was 
higher primary and bacterial productivity. Thus, these organisms must be
considered in studies that aim at the identification of organisms that may
indicate anthropic impacts and environmental quality.
