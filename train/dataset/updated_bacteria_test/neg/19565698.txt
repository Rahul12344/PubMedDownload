We report the first isolation of Vibrio harveyi from wedge sole Dicologoglossa
cuneata. The pathogen was recovered from ulcers and internal organs of ailing
cultured fish, from 7 different outbreaks between 2004 and 2006. The 15 isolates 
found were phenotypically characterized using biochemical tests and BIOLOG GN
plates, which revealed high phenotypic diversity. Diagnosis was confirmed with
PCR using V harveyi specific primers and partial 16S and 23S rRNA gene
sequencing. A virulence evaluation of the isolates was also performed using fry
and juvenile wedge sole. Significant mortalities were recorded by intraperitoneal
injection; however, no mortalities were recorded by bath immersion.
