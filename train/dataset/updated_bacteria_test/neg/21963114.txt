Mur ligases (MurC-MurF), a group of bacterial enzymes that catalyze four
consecutive steps in the formation of cytoplasmic peptidoglycan precursor, are
becoming increasingly adopted as targets in antibacterial drug design. Based on
the crystal structure of MurD cocrystallized with thiazolidine-2,4-dione
inhibitor I, we have designed, synthesized, and evaluated a series of improved
glutamic acid containing 5-benzylidenerhodanine and
5-benzylidenethiazolidine-2,4-dione inhibitors of MurD with IC(50) values up to
28 μM. Inhibitor 37, with an IC(50) of 34 μM, displays a weak antibacterial
activity against S. aureus ATCC 29213 and E. faecalis ATCC 29212 with minimal
inhibitory concentrations of 128 μg/mL. High-resolution crystal structures of
MurD in complex with two new inhibitors (compounds 23 and 51) reveal details of
their binding modes within the active site and provide valuable information for
further structure-based optimization.
