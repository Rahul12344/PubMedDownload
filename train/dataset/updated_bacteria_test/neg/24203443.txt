Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), a heterogeneous population of myeloid
progenitors, are recognized as a key element in tumor escape and progression. The
importance of MDSCs in human malignancies has been demonstrated in recent years, 
and new approaches targeting their suppressive/tolerogenic action are currently
being tested in both preclinical model and clinical trials. However, emerging
evidence suggests that MDSCs may play a prominent role as regulator of the
physiologic, the chronic, and the pathologic immune responses. This review will
focus on the biology of MDSC in light of these new findings and the possible role
of this myeloid population not only in the progression of the tumor but also in
its initiation.
