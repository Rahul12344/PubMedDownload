Bartonella spp. are rare pathogens in humans and were recently recognized as
important causative agents of culture-negative endocarditis. Here, we describe
the 1st 2 documented cases of culture-negative endocarditis due to Bartonella
henselae and Bartonella quintana encountered in a single hospital in Germany.
Infection of the heart valve tissue was detected by broad-range polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) and further confirmed by serologic testing. In particular, acute
B. henselae infection with an impressive bacterial colonization of the infected
cardiac valve was illustrated by transmission electron microscopy. B. henselae
was further characterized by PCR assays targeting genotype-specific regions.
Disease progression was initially monitored over the entire infection episode
through inflammatory markers. In addition, a short overview of published detailed
cases of Bartonella endocarditis in Europe within the last 7 years is given.
