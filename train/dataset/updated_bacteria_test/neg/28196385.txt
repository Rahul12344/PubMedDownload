Background The management of pulmonary secretion in patients with respiratory
muscle weakness using mechanical insufflator-exsufflator systems (MIE) is an
established treatment option. There are significant differences in the efficiency
of different devices in practical use. The intention of this study was to
evaluate the peak exspiratory flow (PEF) values of different devices with and
without use of equipment. Methods PEFs of ten MIE were investigated in vitro
using different equipment. Results The efficiency of the devices showed
significant differences. The use of two bacterial filters showed a significant
reduction of 13 % compared to one filter, the use of a catheter mount revealed a 
significant reduction of 10 %, with an elbow connector additionally 15 %. With a 
commonly used equipment (1800 mm tube, one filter, catheter tube with elbow)
there was a difference of 58 % between the devices Nippy (2,86 l/s) and Pulsar
(1,2 l/s). Conclusion There are significant differences in PEF of different MIE
and use of different equipment. That could be of therapeutic relevance. Further
studies are needed to investigate the clinical relevance of these findings.
Recommendations for the use of devices and equipment are necessary to ensure the 
efficacy of the elimination of pulmonary mucus.
