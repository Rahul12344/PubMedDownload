The utility of a genotypic typing assay for Legionella pneumophila was
investigated. A multiple-locus variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) analysis 
(MLVA) scheme using PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis is proposed based on
eight minisatellite markers. Panels of well-characterized strains were examined
in a multicenter analysis to validate the assay and to compare its performance to
that of other genotyping assays. Excellent typeability, reproducibility,
stability, and epidemiological concordance were observed. The MLVA type or
profile is composed of a string of allele numbers, corresponding to the number of
repeats at each VNTR locus, separated by commas, in a predetermined order. A
database containing information from 99 L. pneumophila serogroup 1 strains and
four strains of other serogroups and their MLVA profiles, which can be queried
online, is available from http://bacterial-genotyping.igmors.u-psud.fr/.
