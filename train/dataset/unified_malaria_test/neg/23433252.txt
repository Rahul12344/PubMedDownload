background: rapid, non-invasive, inexpensive point-of-care (poc) diagnostic
for malaria followed therapeutic intervention would improve ability to
control infection endemic areas.
methods: semi-nested pcr amplification protocol described quantitative
detection plasmodium falciparum compared traditional nested pcr.
the approach uses primers target p. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase
gene.
results: study demonstrates possible perform uninterrupted,
asymmetric, semi-nested pcr assay reduced assay time detect p. falciparum
without compromising sensitivity specificity assay using saliva as
a testing matrix.
conclusions: development pcr allows nucleic acid amplification
without need transfer amplicon first pcr step second
reaction tube nested primers, thus reducing chance contamination
and time analysis to < two hours. analysis pcr amplicon yield 
adapted lateral flow detection using quantitative up-converting phosphor
(ucp) reporter technology. approach provides basis migration the
assay poc microfluidic format. addition assay successfully
evaluated oral samples. oral fluid collection provides simple non-invasive
method collect clinical samples.
