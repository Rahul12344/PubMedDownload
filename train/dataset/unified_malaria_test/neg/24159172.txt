the identity vampire bat saliva anticoagulant remained elusive almost a
century. sequencing salivary gland genes vampire bat desmodus
rotundus identified desmolaris novel 21.5-kda naturally deleted (kunitz
1-domainless) form tissue factor pathway inhibitor. recombinant desmolaris was
expressed hek293 cells characterized slow, tight, noncompetitive 
inhibitor factor (f) xia mechanism modulated heparin. desmolaris also 
inhibits fxa lower affinity, independently protein s. addition,
desmolaris binds kallikrein reduces bradykinin generation plasma activated
with kaolin. truncated mutated forms desmolaris determined arg32 in
the kunitz-1 domain critical protease inhibition. moreover, kunitz-2 and
the carboxyl-terminus domains mediate interaction desmolaris heparin 
are required optimal inhibition fxia fxa. notably, desmolaris (100
μg/kg) inhibited fecl3-induced carotid artery thrombus without impairing
hemostasis. results imply fxia primary vivo target for
desmolaris antithrombotic concentrations. desmolaris also reduces the
polyphosphate-induced increase vascular permeability collagen- and
epinephrine-mediated thromboembolism mice. desmolaris emerges novel
anticoagulant targeting fxia conditions coagulation
activation, particularly contact pathway, plays major pathological role.
