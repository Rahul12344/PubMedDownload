previous studies demonstrated plasmodium falciparum strain d10 became highly
resistant mitochondrial electron transport chain (mtetc) inhibitor
atovaquone mtetc decoupled pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway 
by expressing fumarate-dependent (ubiquinone-independent) yeast
dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (ydhodh) parasites. investigate the
requirement decoupled mtetc activity p. falciparum different genetic 
backgrounds, integrated single copy ydhodh gene genomes of
d10attb, 3d7attb, dd2attb, hb3attb strains parasite. ydhodh gene
was equally expressed transgenic lines. four ydhodh transgenic 
lines showed strong resistance atovaquone standard short-term growth
inhibition assays. longer term growth atovaquone, d10attb-ydhodh 
3d7attb-ydhodh parasites remained fully resistant, dd2attb-ydhodh and
hb3attb-ydhodh parasites lost tolerance drug 3 4 days of
exposure. differences found, however, growth responses among of
these strains plasmodium-specific dhodh inhibitor dsm1 either short- or
long-term exposures. thus, dsm1 works well selective agent parasite
lines transfected ydhodh gene, whereas atovaquone works lines. 
we found ubiquinone analog decylubiquinone substantially reversed the
atovaquone inhibition dd2attb-ydhodh hb3attb-ydhodh transgenic parasites
during extended growth. thus, conclude strain-specific
differences requirement mtetc activity among p. falciparum strains,
suggesting that, erythrocytic stages parasite, ubiquinone-dependent
dehydrogenase activities dhodh dispensable some
strains essential others.
