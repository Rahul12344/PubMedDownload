ppp protein phosphatases important enzyme family involved variety 
aspects cellular signalling metabolism. ppps ubiquitous eukaryotes,
and also present many bacteria. canonical eukaryotic ppp phosphotases 
represented five major subfamilies (pp1, pp2a, calcineurin, pp5 ppef/pp7).
we previously reported three "bacterial-like" ppp groups span the
prokaryote-eukaryote boundary, including "shewanella-like" phosphatases
(shelphs), focus study. predict possible
biological functions functional partners shelphs examining composition 
of bacterial operons expression data eukaryotes available public
databases. arabidopsis thaliana, predicted possible roles include
light-dependent regulation chloroplast functions, signalling the
nucleus chloroplast, defence responses. plasmodium falciparum,
shelphs predicted associated host cell invasion. one isoform has
been located apical complex, essential interaction host
cell. makes p. falciparum shelphs obvious potential candidates for
therapeutic targets. shelphs also present bacteria constitute a
considerable proportion symbiotic microflora humans. predicted

they may direct relationship human health. predicted biological
processes potential functional partners shelphs common between
different bacterial and/or eukaryotic lineages, suggesting evolutionary
conservation shelph regulatory modules.
