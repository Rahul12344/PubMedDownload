the critical bottleneck generation recombinant plasmodium berghei 
parasites mandatory vivo cloning step following successful genetic
manipulation. study describes new technique rapid selection of
recombinant p. berghei parasites. method based flow cytometry to
isolate isogenic parasite lines represents major advance field, 
that speed generation recombinant parasites well cut on
animal use significantly. high expression gfp blood infection, a
prerequisite robust separation transgenic lines flow cytometry, was
achieved. isogenic recombinant parasite populations isolated even the
presence 100-fold excess wild-type (wt) parasites. aquaglyceroporin (aqp)
loss-of-function mutants parasites expressing tagged aqp generated 
validate approach. aqp(-) parasites grow normally within wt phenotypic
range blood infection nmri mice. similarly, colonization insect 
vector establishment infection mosquito transmission were
unaffected, indicating aqp dispensable life cycle progression vivo
under physiological conditions, refuting use suitable drug target.
tagged aqp localized perinuclear structures parasite plasma
membrane. suggest flow-cytometric isolation isogenic parasites
overcomes major roadblock towards genome-scale repository mutant and
transgenic malaria parasite lines.
