ethiopia one african countries plasmodium vivax co-endemic
with p. falciparum. malaria transmission seasonal transmission intensity
varies mainly landscape climate. although recent emergence drug
resistant parasites presents major issue malaria control ethiopia, little
is known transmission pathways parasite species prevalence of
resistant markers. study used microsatellites determine population
diversity gene flow patterns p. falciparum (n = 226) p. vivax (n =
205), well prevalence drug resistant markers infer impact gene
flow existing malaria treatment regimes. plasmodium falciparum indicated a
higher rate polyclonal infections p. vivax. species revealed
moderate genetic diversity similar population structure. populations the
northern highlands closely related eastern rift valley, slightly 
distinct southern basin area. gene flow via human migrations the
northern eastern populations frequent mostly bidirectional.
landscape genetic analyses indicated environmental heterogeneity and
geographical distance constrain parasite gene flow. may partly
explain similar patterns resistant marker prevalence. p. falciparum, high
prevalence mutant alleles detected codons related chloroquine (pfcrt
and pfmdr1) sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (pfdhps pfdhfr) resistance. over
60% samples showed pfmdr1 duplications. nevertheless, mutation was
detected pfk13 relates artemisinin resistance. p. vivax, while
sequences pvcrt-o highly conserved less 5% samples showed
pvmdr duplications, 50% samples pvmdr1 976f mutation. remains 
to tested mutation relates chloroquine resistance. monitoring the
extent malaria spread markers drug resistance imperative inform
policy evidence-based antimalarial choice interventions. effectively
reduce malaria burden ethiopia, control efforts focus seasonal
migrant populations.
