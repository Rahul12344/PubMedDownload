fitness costs key determinants whether drug resistance alleles establish
and fast spread within populations. 125 different kelch13
alleles, containing different amino acid substitution, arisen in
southeast asian malaria parasite (plasmodium falciparum) populations under
artemisinin selection past 15 years dramatic example soft
selective event. however, one alleles (c580y) outcompeting
other alleles multiple different countries spreading toward fixation.
here examine fitness consequences c580y, relative another less
successful kelch13 mutation (r561h), try explain distinctive dynamics
of c580y. hypothesized c580y show lower fitness costs other
kelch13 substitutions absence artemisinin treatment. used
crispr/cas9 methods introduce single mutations (c580y r561h) synonymous 
control edits wild-type parasite isolated thailand-myanmar border, 
conducted replicated head-to-head competition assays, determined outcome 
of competition using deep sequencing kelch13 amplicons. contrary our
predictions, experiments reveal c580y carries higher fitness costs (s 
[selection coefficient] = 0.15 ± 0.008 [1 standard error {se}]) r561h (s =
0.084 ± 0.005). furthermore, r561h outcompetes c580y direct competition (s =
0.065 ± 0.004). conclude fitness costs c580y isolation unlikely
to explain rapid spread substitution.
