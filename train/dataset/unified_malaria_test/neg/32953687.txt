background: circumsporozoite protein (csp) one important surface
sporozoite antigens malaria, recently considered candidate for
vaccination. considering importance csp, study conducted to
investigate polymorphism genetic diversity plasmodium vivax
circumsporozoite protein (pvcsp) southeastern region iran during
2015-2016.
methods: investigate polymorphism genetic diversity, 20 blood samples were
collected patients p. vivax, dna extracted amplified using
partial sequence csp gene. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) products were
sequenced compared sequences genomic databases using blast. genetic
evaluation phylogenic analysis performed using mega7 dnasp5
software's 38 sequences include 20 sequences study 18 sequences 
gene bank.
results: eleven isolates vk210 genotype 9 isolates contained vk247. 
result variable segregation nucleotide site indicated differentiation
of sequences csp 25.67% 20 samples less 38
samples value 26.67%. comparing ratio dn/ds regions csp
gene indicates csp varies synonymously amino acid lower
variation. 38 samples, 35 unique haplotypes identified based 1042 
nucleotide sequences csp, showing variation percentage 99.4%.
conclusion: tajima analyses showed csp gene p. vivax positive
number total analyzed sequences, means p. vivax mutations
are order select positive evolution.
