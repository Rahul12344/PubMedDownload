background: mosquito saliva complex cocktail whose pharmacological
properties play essential role blood feeding counteracting host
physiological response tissue injury. moreover, vector borne pathogens are
transmitted vertebrates exposed immune system context of
mosquito saliva which, virtue immunomodulatory properties, modify
the local environment feeding site eventually affect pathogen
transmission. addition, host antibody response salivary proteins may be
used assess human exposure mosquito vectors. even though role quite 
a mosquito salivary proteins clarified last decade, still 
completely ignore physiological role many well extent of
their involvement complex interactions taking place mosquito
vectors, pathogens transmit vertebrate host. recent release 
of genomes 16 anopheles species offered opportunity get insights
into function evolution salivary protein families anopheline
mosquitoes.
results: orthologues fifty three anopheles gambiae salivary proteins were
retrieved annotated 18 additional anopheline species belonging the
three subgenera cellia, anopheles, nyssorhynchus. analysis included 824
full-length salivary proteins 24 different families allowed the
identification 79 novel salivary genes re-annotation 379 wrong
predictions. comparative, structural phylogenetic analyses yielded an
unprecedented view anopheline salivary repertoires evolution 
over 100 million years anopheline radiation shedding light mechanisms and
evolutionary forces contributed shaping anopheline sialomes.
conclusions: provide comprehensive description, classification and
evolutionary overview main anopheline salivary protein families and
identify two novel candidate markers human exposure malaria vectors
worldwide. anopheline sialome catalogue, easily accessible as
hyperlinked spreadsheet, expected useful vector biology community
and improve capacity gain deeper understanding mosquito salivary
proteins facilitating possible exploitation epidemiological and/or
pathogen-vector-host interaction studies.
