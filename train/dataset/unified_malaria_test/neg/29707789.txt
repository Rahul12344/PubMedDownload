background: recently, basigin (bsg), carries ok antigens red blood cells
(rbcs), reported receptor plasmodium falciparum
reticulocyte-binding protein homolog 5 (pfrh5). bsg-pfrh5 essential
receptor-ligand pair p. falciparum invasion known date. however,
the kind ok/bsg polymorphism involved selection pressure caused by
p. falciparum malaria determined.
study design methods: blood samples collected detect expression
of ok/bsg. coding region pfrh5 cloned expressed. enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay-based erythrocyte binding assay used measure the
recombinant pfrh5 (rpfrh5) binding rbcs different ok/bsg expressions.
sequencing bsg gene quantification bsg mrna performed 
selected samples. candidate micrornas (mirnas), might target bsg
gene, obtained mirna sequencing. dual-luciferase reporter assay and
overexpression identified mirnas performed k562 cells.
results: rpfrh5 successfully expressed verified. ok/bsg
expression levels varied among blood donors strongly associated with
rpfrh5 binding. single-nucleotide polymorphism related ok/bsg
expression. potential bsg regulator, mir-501-3p, identified mirna
sequencing dual-luciferase assay, proven regulate the
expression bsg k562 cells.
conclusion: although mechanism ok/bsg expression regulation rbcs
has fully clarified, findings suggest ok/bsg expression
levels rbcs might related p. falciparum invasion. moreover,
posttranscriptional regulation might play role controlling ok/bsg
expression.
