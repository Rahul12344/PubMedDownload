tick saliva contains complex mixture peptides non-peptides that
counteract hosts' hemostasis, immunity, tissue-repair reactions. recent
transcriptomic studies revealed one thousand different transcripts
coding secreted polypeptides single tick species. gene
products belong many expanded families, lipocalins,
metalloproteases, antigen-5, cystatins, apyrases, also families 
found exclusively ticks, evasins, isac, dap36, many others.
phylogenetic analysis deduced protein sequences indicate salivary
genes exhibit increased rate evolution due lower evolutionary
constraint and/or positive selection, allowing large diversity tick
salivary proteins. thus, new tick species salivary
transcriptome sequenced assembled, formidable task annotation these
transcripts awaits. currently, november 2019, 287 thousand
coding sequences deposited national center biotechnology information
(ncbi) derived tick salivary gland mrna. here, 287
thousand sequences identified 45,264 potential secretory proteins which
possess signal peptide transmembrane domains mature peptide. by
using psiblast tools, position-specific matrices constructed and
assembled ticksialofam (tsf) database. tsf rpsblastable
database help annotation tick sialotranscriptomes. tsa
database identified 136 tick salivary secreted protein families, well 80
families endosomal-related products, mostly protein modification
function. number sequences increases, new annotation details become
available, new releases tsf database may become available.
