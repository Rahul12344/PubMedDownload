because mutation natural selection, development drug resistance 
existing antimalarial major problem malaria treatment. problem has
created urgent need novel antimalarial drug targets well lead
compounds. important characteristic malaria shows the
phenomenon balanced polymorphisms. several traits selected in
response disease pressure. therefore factors must explored to
understand pathogenesis malaria infection human host. apicoplast, hub
of metabolism present plasmodium falciparum (causative agent falciparum 
malaria) similarities plant plastid. among several pathways in
apicoplast, dolichol metabolic pathway one important pathway and
has known play role parasite survival human host. in
p.falciparum, phosphorylated derivative dolichol participates in
biosynthesis glycoproteins. several proteins pathway play role post
translational modifications proteins involved signal transduction
pathways, regulation dna replication cell cycle. pathway used 
as antimalarial drug target. report explored progress towards study 
of proteins inhibitors dolichol metabolic pathway. comprehensive 
analysis, host genetic factors drug-protein interaction been
covered.
