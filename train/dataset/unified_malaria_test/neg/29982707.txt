background: antigametocyte-specific immune responses may regulate plasmodium
falciparum gametocyte density, providing rationale pursuing
transmission-blocking vaccines (tbvs) target gametocytes human host.
methods: identify novel antigametocyte tbv antigens, interrogated the
gametocyte proteome whole proteome differential screening method using
plasma treatment-reinfection study conducted western kenya. the
start high-transmission season, 144 males (12-35 years) enrolled 
treated quinine doxycycline, peripheral venous blood samples were
obtained, volunteers observed, weekly blood films obtained 18
weeks quantify gametocytemia. using plasma pooled individuals low
versus high gametocyte carriage, differentially screened p falciparum
gametocyte stage complementary deoxyribonucleic acid expression library.
results: identified 8 parasite genes uniquely recognized by
gametocyte-resistant gametocyte-susceptible individuals. antibodies to
one antigens, pfsegxp, predicted lower gametocytemia measured the
18-week transmission season (p = .021). analyzed dichotomously, anti-pfsegxp
responders 31% lower gametocyte density 18 weeks follow-up, compared 
with nonresponders (p = .04).
conclusions: pfsegxp one first reported gametocyte-specific target of
antibodies predict decreased gametocyte density humans supports our
novel tbv antigen discovery platform.
