this release funcoup database (http://funcoup.sbc.su.se) fourth
generation one comprehensive databases genome-wide functional 
association networks. functional associations inferred via integrating 
various data types using naive bayesian algorithm orthology based
information transfer across different species. approach provides high
coverage included genomes well high quality inferred
interactions. update funcoup introduce four new eukaryotic species:
schizosaccharomyces pombe, plasmodium falciparum, bos taurus, oryza sativa and
open database prokaryotic domain including networks escherichia
coli bacillus subtilis. latter allows us also introduce new class of
functional association genes - co-occurrence operon. also 
supplemented existing classes functional association: metabolic,
signaling, complex physical protein interaction up-to-date information. 
in release switched inparanoid v8 source orthology base 
for calculation phylogenetic profiles. populating evidence
types new data introduce new evidence type based quantitative mass
spectrometry data. finally, new javascript based network viewer provides 
user intuitive responsive platform evaluate results.
