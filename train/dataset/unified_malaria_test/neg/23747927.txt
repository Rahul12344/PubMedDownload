the population structure history cryptic malaria vector species,
anopheles punctulatus (doenitz), investigated throughout papua new guinea and
the solomon islands aim detailing genetic subdivisions the
potential movement biogeographically complex region. obtained
larval collections 80 sites utilised diverse array molecular
markers evolve different processes. individuals initially
identified species genotyped using ribosomal dna second internal
transcribed spacer. dna sequencing single copy nuclear ribosomal protein s9 
and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase loci investigated 12
nuclear microsatellite markers developed analysed. data revealed
three genetically distinct populations--one papua new guinea, second on
buka island (bougainville province, papua new guinea), third on
guadalcanal island (solomon islands). genetic differentiation within papua new
guinea much lower found studies closely related species
in region. data suggest a. punctulatus undergone a
population bottleneck followed recent population range expansion in
papua new guinea. humans regional economic growth may facilitating this
population expansion, a. punctulatus able rapidly occupy human modified 
landscapes traverse unsealed roads. therefore anticipate extensive
movement species new guinea--particularly highlands,
with potential increase malaria frequency warming climate--as well as
relatively unrestricted gene flow advantageous alleles may confound
vector control efforts.
