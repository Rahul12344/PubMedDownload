toxoplasma gondii obligate intracellular protozoan infects one-third 
of human population. due high infection prevalence, toxoplasma offers 
an ideal system study host-parasite interaction. similar other
eukaryotes, toxoplasma maintains levels localization cytoplasmic mrnas
throughout life cycle part gene regulation network meet all
cellular biochemical requirements. recently, reported the
presence cytoplasmic mrna granules could contribute parasite
pathogenesis viability. identified novel toxoplasma dead-box rna
helicase, referred toxoplasma gondiihomolog dozi (tghodi), of
its high homology (81%) plasmodium dozi. tghodi functional ortholog 
yeast dhh1, function authenticated complementation studies in
δdhh1 yeast strain. demonstrated tghodi marker cytoplasmic rna
stress granules, assemble parasites experience cellular stresses
and translational arrest.
