background: plasmodium genome encodes number 6-cys proteins that
contain module six cysteine residues forming three intramolecular disulphide
bonds. proteins well characterized transmission well as
hepatic stages parasite life cycle. present study, large complex 
of 6-cys proteins: pfs41, pfs38 pfs12 three merozoite surface
proteins: glutamate-rich protein (glurp), sera5 msp-1 identified 
plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface.
methods: recombinant 6-cys proteins i.e. pfs38, pfs12, pfs41 well pfmsp-165
were expressed purified using escherichia coli expression system and
antibodies raised proteins. antibodies used
to immunoprecipitate native proteins associated partners from
parasite lysate. elisa, far western, surface plasmon resonance glycerol
density gradient fractionation carried confirm respective
interactions. furthermore, erythrocyte binding assay 6-cys proteins were
undertaken find possible role host-parasite infection and
seropositivity assessed using indian liberian sera.
results: immunoprecipitation parasite-derived polypeptides, followed by
lc-ms/ms analysis, identified large pfs38 complex comprising 6-cys proteins:
pfs41, pfs38, pfs12 merozoite surface proteins: glurp, sera5 msp-1.
the existence complex corroborated several
protein-protein interaction tools, co-localization co-sedimentation analysis.
pfs38 protein pfs38 complex binds host red blood cells (rbcs) directly via 
glycophorin receptor. seroprevalence analysis showed six
antigens, prevalence varied 40 99%, generally highest msp-165
and glurp proteins.
conclusions: together data show presence large pfs38
protein-associated complex parasite surface involved rbc
binding. results highlight complex molecular interactions among p. 
falciparum merozoite surface proteins advocate development a
multi-sub-unit malaria vaccine based protein complexes on
merozoite surface.
