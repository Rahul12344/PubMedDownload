human babesiosis caused parasitic protozoan babesia spp. sporadic zoonotic 
vector-borne infection. course babesiosis prognosis depend type
of pathogen patient's immunological status. significance disease 
is severe, often fatal course immunocompromissed patients resembling
complicated falciparum malaria. europe date, 50 cases of
confirmed human babesiosis reported cases caused babesia
divergens. possible unrecognized cases. pathogen obligate
intraerythrocyte parasite vertebrate animals. organism transmitted from
animal man bite ixodidae tick. asexual reproduction parasite
occurs vertebrate host. pathogenesis babesiosis caused the
destruction host cells. intensive haemolysis red blood cells leads the
development haemolytic anemia, haematuria, jaundice, polyorgan failure may
develop. clinical manifestations disease nonspecific. detection of
intraerythrocyte parasites blood smears stained gimsa-romanovsky confirms 
proposed diagnosis. blood smears laboratory signs fatal cases 
analyzed reference-centre e. i. martsinovskiĭ institute. original
microphotographs b. divergens shown. main morphological forms the
parasite shown. addition well-known tetrades parasites «maltese 
cross», first time, parasites dividing 6 interconnected
trophozoites - "sextet" - found. originally, invasion babesia a
normoblast shown. unusually high multiple invasion (14 parasites) of
erythrocytes noted. patients, initially, incorrectly
diagnosed malaria, differential diagnosis babesia plasmodium 
described step-by-step. important, since treatment antimalarial
drugs ineffective. deviation laboratory signs discussed. complex
morphological characteristics allowed us speciated parasites b.
divergens. dna detected sample specific primers bab di hsp70f/bab

similarity 18s rrna gene fragment b. divergence babesia venatorum, 
respectively. molecular biological serological methods laboratory
diagnosis babesiosis considered.
