the coronavirus (cov) severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)-cov-2 (covid-19)
pandemic received rapid response research community offer
suggestions repurposing approved drugs well improve our
understanding covid-19 viral life cycle molecular mechanisms. short
period, tens thousands research preprints publications have
emerged including report lists experimentally validated drugs and
compounds potential covid-19 therapies. addition, gene sets from
interacting covid-19 virus-host proteins differentially expressed genes 
comparing infected uninfected cells published fast rate. to
organize rapidly accumulating knowledge, developed covid-19 gene 
drug set library (https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/covid19/), collection gene 
drug sets related covid-19 research multiple sources. covid-19 gene
and drug set library delivered web-based interface enables users 
view, download, analyze, visualize, contribute gene drug sets related 
covid-19 research. evaluate content library, performed several
analyses including comparing results 6 in-vitro drug screens for
covid-19 repurposing candidates. surprisingly, observe little overlap across
these initial screens. common unique hit across screen is
mefloquine, malaria drug receive attention potential
therapeutic covid-19. overall, library gene drug sets used 
to identify community consensus, make researchers clinicians aware the
development new potential therapies, well allow research community
to work together towards cure covid-19.
