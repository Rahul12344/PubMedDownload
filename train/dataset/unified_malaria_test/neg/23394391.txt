background: nat2, broad-spectrum drug-metabolizing gene, high
pharmacogenetic interest. based seven different mutations nat2 gene, an
individual either categorized slow fast acetylator.
materials & methods: order characterize acetylation profiles indians,
where data poorly available, sequenced 873 bp nat2 coding region in
250 indians, covering whole india including three tribes.
results: altogether, 35 nat2 alleles forming two acetylator phenotypes
(distributed almost equal proportion india) found; alleles
determining slow acetylators highly differentiated, fast acetylator
alleles less number highly frequent.
conclusion: interestingly, distribution two different acetylation phenotypes
correlated well historical dietary pattern india. neighbor-joining
phylogenetic tree based nat2 gene polymorphisms worldwide humans revealed
genetic affinities among populations similar acetylation phenotypes, which
also placed indians africans together single cluster.
