binding host immunoglobulin common immune evasion mechanism demonstrated 
by microbial pathogens. previous work showed malaria parasite plasmodium
falciparum binds fc-region human igm molecules, resulting coating 
igm surface infected erythrocytes. igm binding property p.
falciparum strains showing virulence-related phenotypes erythrocyte
rosetting. parasite ligands igm binding members diverse p.
falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein one (pfemp1) family. however, little is
known amino acid sequence requirements igm binding. studied
an igm binding domain rosette-mediating pfemp1 variant, dbl4ζ of
tm284var1, found minimal igm binding region mapped central
region dbl domain, comprising subdomain 2 adjoining parts of
subdomains 1 3. site-directed mutagenesis charged amino acids within
subdomain 2, predicted molecular modelling form igm binding site,
showed marked effect igm binding properties. overall, study identifies
the minimal igm binding region pfemp1 domain, indicates the
existing homology model pfemp1-igm interaction incorrect. work is
needed identify specific interaction site igm within minimal
binding region pfemp1.
