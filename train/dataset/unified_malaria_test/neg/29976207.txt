background: mutations plasmodium falciparum k13 gene associated with
artemisinin (art) resistance. however, unclear whether f446i mutation, 
the prevalent allele china-myanmar border north myanmar, is
associated art resistance. therefore, aim study to
investigate role mutation art resistance generating transgenic 
parasites expressing f446i mutant allele.
methods: transgenic parasites carrying f446i c580y mutation both
3d7 fcc1/hn isolates generated single crossing-over recombination and
verified using pcr gene sequencing. ring-stage survival assay 0-3 h
(rsa0-3 h) used evaluate art susceptibility transgenic parasites in
vitro.
results: four transgenic parasite lines named 3d7f446i mut, 3d7c580y mut,
fcc1/hnf446i mut fcc1/hnc580y mut successfully generated. parasite
lines showed changes expression level k13 compared their
parent parasite isolates. however, introduction f446i mutation k13 of
the 3d7 fcc1/hn isolates led elevated ring survival rates detected using
rsa0-3 h subjected 700 20 nm concentrations of
dihydroartemisinin. survival rates similar detected the
parasite lines c580y mutation.
conclusions: insertion f446i mutation k13 led increased ring
survival, suggesting mutation may associated art resistance and
could used molecular marker monitoring art-resistant parasites. the
results also highlights importance surveillance f446i mutants for
containing resistant parasite.
