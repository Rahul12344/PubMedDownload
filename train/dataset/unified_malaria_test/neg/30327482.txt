malaria disease diverse symptoms depending host immune status and
pathogenicity plasmodium parasites. continuous parasite growth within a
host suggests mechanisms immune evasion parasite and/or immune
inhibition response infection. identify pathways commonly inhibited
after malaria infection, infected c57bl/6 mice four plasmodium yoelii
strains causing different disease phenotypes 24 progeny genetic cross.
mrnas mouse spleens day 1 and/or day 4 post infection (p.i.) hybridized
to mouse microarray identify activated inhibited pathways, upstream
regulators, host genes playing important role malaria infection. strong
interferon responses observed infection n67 strain, whereas
initial inhibition later activation hematopoietic pathways found
after infection 17xnl parasite, showing unique responses individual
parasite strains. inhibitions pathways th1 activation, dendritic cell 
(dc) maturation, nfat immune regulation observed mice infected with
all parasite strains day 4 p.i., suggesting universally inhibited immune
pathways. proof principle, treatment n67-infected mice antibodies
against cell receptors ox40 cd28 activate inhibited pathways enhanced
host survival. controlled activation pathways may provide important
strategies better disease management developing effective vaccine.
