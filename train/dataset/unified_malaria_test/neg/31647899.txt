chloroquine, prototype anti-malaria drug, reported possess
anti-inflammatory effects. moreover, chloroquine pretreatment could improve dna
damage repair. therefore reasonable hypothesize chloroquine
pretreatment could attenuate ischemia/reperfusion injury brain.
considering fact chloroquine could also improve glucose metabolism, we
speculated potential effects chloroquine ischemia/reperfusion
injury might particularly pronounced diabetic mice. study,
chloroquine pretreatment protected neurons oxygen glucose deprivation (ogd) 
induced cytotoxicity apoptosis. vivo, ob/ob mice wildtype (wt) mice
were pretreated chloroquine 3 weeks. then, ischemic stroke induced
by 60 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (mcao). found chloroquine
pretreatment normalized blood glucose diabetic ob/ob mice, reduced
cerebral damage ischemic stroke especially diabetic mice. addition, 
chloroquine pretreatment reduced high-mobility group box 1 (hmgb1) content the
cerebrospinal fluid (csf) serum lowered myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity
and inflammatory cytokines gene expression ob/ob diabetic mice wt
mice. moreover, harmful dna damage-signaling responses, including parp activation
and p53 activation, also attenuated chloroquine pretreatment two
kinds mice. conclusion, chloroquine pretreatment could reduce cerebral
damage ischemic stroke especially diabetic mice multiple
mechanisms, include reducing neural cell dna injury, restoring euglycemia
and anti-inflammatory effects. findings may provide potential the
development chloroquine prevention treatment stroke diabetic 
high-risk patients.
