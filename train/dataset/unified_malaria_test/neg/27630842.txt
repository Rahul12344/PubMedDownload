introduction: malaria human disease causes high morbidity and
mortality. plasmodium falciparum malaria, resistance antimalarial
drugs, especially chloroquine (cq) one paramount factors contributing
to global increase morbidity mortality, due malaria. hence, there
is need detection chloroquine drug resistance genes i.e., pfcrt-o
(plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter-o) pfmdr-1
(plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance-1) p. falciparum pvcrt-o
(plasmodium vivax chloroquine resistance transporter-o) pvmdr-1 (plasmodium
vivax multidrug resistance-1) p. vivax using molecular methods prevent
mortality malarial cases.
aim: standardize chloroquine drug sensitivity testing molecular method so
as provide reports chloroquine within 6-8 hours physicians better
treatment.
materials methods: study conducted period one year from
january december 2014. total 300 blood samples collected from
malaria suspected patient attending mgm hospital, kamothe, navi mumbai, india.
out 300 blood samples, 44 malaria positive assessed thick thin 
blood smear stained, leishman's method examination light microscope. 
chloroquine drug sensitivity testing performed using iii plate method
(micro test). nested pcr done detection pfcrt-o pfmdr-1 p.
falciparum pvcrt-o, pvmdr-1 genes p. vivax.
results: total 44 samples included study, 22 samples
confirmed plasmodium falciparum 22 samples confirmed plasmodium
vivax. 22 p. falciparum 15 (68.18%) samples chloroquine resistant. p.
vivax showed chloroquine resistance 5 samples (22.73%) method similar to
who iii plate method (micro test) nested pcr.
conclusion: drug resistance testing molecular methods useful early
detection antimalarial drug resistance. pfmdr-1 along pfcrt-o used
as biomarker chloroquine drug resistance p. falciparum pvmdr-1 along
with pvcrt-o p. vivax.
