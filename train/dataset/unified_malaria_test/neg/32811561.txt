background: understanding mechanisms used anopheles mosquitoes survive 
insecticide exposure key manage existing insecticide resistance develop
more suitable insecticide-based malaria vector control interventions well as
other alternative integrated tools. regard, molecular basis of
permethrin, ddt dieldrin resistance anopheles funestus (sensu stricto) 
akaka-remo investigated.
methods: bioassays conducted 3-5-day-old adult an. funestus (s.s.)
mosquitoes permethrin, ddt dieldrin susceptibility test. molecular
mechanisms mosquito resistance insecticides investigated using
microarray reverse transcriptase pcr techniques. voltage-gated sodium
channel region mosquitoes also screened presence knockdown
resistance mutations (kdr west east) sequencing method.
results: anopheles funestus (s.s.) population resistant permethrin
(mortality rate 68%), ddt (mortality rate 10%) dieldrin (mortality rate
of 8%) insecticides. microarray rt-pcr analyses revealed overexpression
of glutathione s-transferase genes, cytochrome p450s, esterase, trypsin and
cuticle proteins resistant mosquitoes compared control. gste2 the
most upregulated detoxification gene permethrin-resistant (fc = 44.89),
ddt-resistant (fc = 57.39) dieldrin-resistant (fc = 41.10) mosquitoes
compared control population (fc = 22.34). cytochrome p450 gene, cyp6p9b
was also upregulated permethrin- ddt-resistant mosquitoes. the
digestive enzyme, trypsin (hydrolytic processes) cuticle proteins
(inducing cuticle thickening leading reduced insecticides penetration) also
showed high involvement insecticide resistance, overexpression
in resistant mosquitoes compared control. kdr east west absent in
all mosquitoes analysed, suggesting non-involvement observed
mosquito resistance.
conclusions: upregulation metabolic genes, especially gste2 and
trypsin, well cuticle proteins driving insecticide resistance an.
funestus (s.s.) population. however, additional molecular analyses, including
functional metabolic assays genes well screening possible
higher cuticular hydrocarbon lipid contents, increased procuticle
thickness resistant mosquitoes needed describe distinct
roles mosquito resistance.
