infection plasmodium falciparum lead range severe minimal
symptoms, occasionally resulting death young children nonimmune adults. 
in areas high transmission, older children adults generally suffer only
mild asymptomatic malaria infections rarely develop severe disease. the
immune features underlying apparent immunity severe disease remain
elusive. gain insight host responses associated severe mild
malaria, conducted longitudinal study five children first presented
with severe malaria and, 1 month later, mild malaria. employing peripheral
blood whole-genome profiling, identified 68 genes associated with
mild malaria compared expression severe malaria episode (paired
students test, p < 0.05). genes reflect interferon (ifn) pathway 
t cell biology include ifn-induced protein transcripts 1 3, oligoadenylate
synthetases 1 3, cell markers cathepsin w perforin. gene set
enrichment analysis identified gene ontology (go) pathways associated mild
malaria include type interferon-mediated signaling pathway (go 0060337),
t cell activation (go 0042110), go pathways representing many aspects
of immune activation. contrast, six genes associated severe
malaria, including thymidine kinase 1, recently found biomarker
of cerebral malaria susceptibility murine model, carbonic anhydrase,
reflecting blood's abnormal acid base environment severe disease.
these data may provide potential insights inform pathogenesis models the
development therapeutics reduce severe disease outcomes due p.
falciparum infection.
