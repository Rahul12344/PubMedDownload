the prevalence malaria india decreasing, remains major concern 
for public health administration. role submicroscopic malaria and
asymptomatic malaria parasitemia persistence explored. a
cross-sectional survey conducted kandhamal district odisha (india) 
during may-june 2017. blood samples collected 1897 individuals for
screening asymptomatic parasitemia. samples screened using rapid
diagnostic tests (rdts) examined microscopically plasmodium species.
approximately 30% randomly selected samples (n = 586) analyzed using
real-time pcr (qpcr), genetic diversity plasmodium falciparum was
analyzed. prevalence plasmodium species among asymptomatic individuals
detected using qpcr 18%, significantly higher detected by
microscopy examination (5.5%) rdt (7.3%). these, 37% submicroscopic
malaria. species-specific prevalence among asymptomatic malaria-positive
cases p. falciparum, plasmodium vivax, mixed infection (p. falciparum and
p. vivax) qpcr 57%, 29%, 14%, respectively. multiplicity of
infection 1.6 1.2 merozoite surface protein-1 gene (msp1) and
(msp2), respectively. expected heterozygosity 0.64 0.47 msp1 and
msp2, respectively. significant proportion study population, 105/586
(18%), found reservoir malaria infection, identification of
this group help development elimination strategies.
