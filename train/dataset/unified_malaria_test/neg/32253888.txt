cov-19/sars-cov-2 highly pathogenic virus causes coronavirus-19 disease
(covid-19) acute respiratory distress syndrome provokes serious problems
for global health. studies suggest many differences men
and women immune response cov-19 infection inflammatory diseases.
women, compared men, less susceptible viral infections based a
different innate immunity, steroid hormones factors related sex
chromosomes. presence two x chromosomes women emphasize immune
system even one inactive. immune regulatory genes encoded x
chromosome female gender causes lower viral load levels, less inflammation
than man, cd4+ cells higher better immune response. in
addition, women generally produce higher levels antibodies remain the
circulation longer. levels activation immune cells higher in
women men, correlated trigger tlr7 the
production ifn. tlr7 higher women men biallelic
expression leads higher immune responses increases resistance viral
infections. tlr7 expressed innate immune cells recognizes single
strand rna virus promoting production antibodies virus 
the generation pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-6 il-1 family
members. moreover, women production inflammatory il-6 viral
infection lower males often correlated better longevity.
in addition, x chromosome loci code genes involved 
in regulation immune cells foxp3, transcription factor for
treg involved virus pathogenesis. x chromosome influences immune
system acting many proteins, including tlr8, cd40l cxcr3 which
can over-expressed women, influence response viral infections
and vaccinations. however, biallelic expression x-linked genes can
promote harmful autoimmune inflammatory responses. cardiovascular diseases
are frequent males subjects without cardiovascular dysfunctions
infected cov-19 better prognosis, effects still under
study. hoped certain drugs, cov-19 receptor blockers,
anti-inflammatories (against rheumatic diseases), monoclonal antibodies,
anti-il-1 anti-il-6, remdesevir drug (analogue adenosine, effective
against ebola), hydroxychloroquine (for treatment malaria) vaccines,
will open new strategies new therapeutic ways combat terrible
virus.
