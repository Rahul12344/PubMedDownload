traditional genetic association studies difficult bacteria, the
generally limited recombination leads large linked haplotype blocks,
confounding identification causative variants. beta-lactam antibiotic
resistance streptococcus pneumoniae arises readily bacteria quickly
incorporate dna fragments encompassing variants make transformed strains
resistant. however, causative mutations embedded within larger
recombined blocks, previous studies analysed limited number of
isolates, leading description "mosaic genes" responsible for
resistance. comparing large number genomes beta-lactam susceptible and
non-susceptible strains, high frequency recombination break up
these haplotype blocks allow use genetic association approaches to
identify individual causative variants. here, performed genome-wide
association study identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) indels
that could confer beta-lactam non-susceptibility using 3,085 thai 616 usa
pneumococcal isolates independent datasets variant discovery. the
large sample sizes allowed us narrow source beta-lactam
non-susceptibility long recombinant fragments much smaller loci
comprised discrete linked snps. loci appear universal
resistance determinants, contributing equally non-susceptibility least 
two classes beta-lactam antibiotics, play larger role resistance 
particular antibiotics. identified loci highly non-uniform
distribution populations. enriched vaccine-targeted, 
but also non-vaccine-targeted lineages, may raise clinical concerns.
identification single nucleotide polymorphisms underlying resistance be
essential future use genome sequencing predict antibiotic sensitivity
in clinical microbiology.
