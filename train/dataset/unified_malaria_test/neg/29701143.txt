parasites plasmodium genus responsible causing malaria humans.
resistant strains available antimalarials found several
locations around globe, including parasites resistant latest
generation combination drugs, piperaquine + artemisinin. plasmodium
develops two completely different hosts vertebrate one 
mosquito vector, thus ability adapt extreme different
environments. complex life cycle hosts, plasmodium invades and
replicates totally different cells thus making study biology the
parasite identification targets drug development affecting all
stages difficult. shown host molecules, melatonin and
derivatives, role progression regulation parasite cell
cycle; fact, parasite exposed melatonin increase in
transcription levels genes encoding proteins related ubiquitin
proteasome (ups) system. system essential survival the
parasite, drugs bortezomib, mln-273, zl3b, epoxomicins and
salinosporamides capable eliminating parasite inhibiting the
degradation proteins via proteasome system. addition, plasmodium
ups shows low similarity ubiquitin proteasome system humans; the
identification unique targets used therapeutic molecules development
increases importance ups studies malaria challenging. drugs cause 
oxidative stress, artemisinin, show strong synergistic effect with
proteasome inhibitors, increasing possibilities combined therapies, 
are effective lower concentration drugs. thus, study the
mechanism action ups identification potential targets for
new drugs development promising alternative strategies fight the
drug-resistance problem malaria parasites.
