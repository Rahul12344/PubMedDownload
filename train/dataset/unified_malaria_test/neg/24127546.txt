we compare frequency resistant genes malaria parasites treatment
and first malaria incidence treatment. data come clinical
trial two health facilities tanzania concerns single nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps) three positions believed related resistance to
malaria treatment. problem mixed infections common, both
obscures underlying frequency alleles locus well the
associations loci samples alleles mixed. use
combinatorics quite involved probability methods handle multiple
infections multiple haplotypes. infection different haplotypes
seemed independent other. showed two three
studied snps, proportion resistant genes increased treatment
with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine alone treated combination with
artesunate, effect noticed. first recurrences malaria associated more
with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine alone treatment combination with
artesunate. also found recruited children two different ongoing
malaria infections parasites different gene types.
