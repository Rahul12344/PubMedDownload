ookinete invasion anopheles midgut critical step malaria
transmission; parasite numbers drop drastically practically reach a
minimum parasite's whole life cycle. stage, parasite as
well vector undergoes immense oxidative stress. thereafter, vector
undergoes oxidative stress different time points parasite invades its
tissues parasite development. present study undertaken to
reconstruct network differentially expressed genes involved oxidative
stress anopheles stephensi plasmodium development maturation the
midgut. using high throughput next generation sequencing methods, generated
the transcriptome an. stephensi midgut plasmodium vinckei petteri
oocyst invasion midgut epithelium. further, utilized large datasets
available public domain anopheles plasmodium ookinete invasion and
drosophila datasets arrived upon clusters genes may play role in
oxidative stress. finally, used support vector machines functional
prediction un-annotated genes an. stephensi. integrating results
from different data analyses, identified total 516 genes that
were involved oxidative stress an. stephensi plasmodium development.
the significantly regulated genes extracted gene cluster
and used infer oxidative stress network an. stephensi. using system
biology approaches, able ascertain role several putative
genes an. stephensi respect oxidative stress. experimental
validations genes underway.
