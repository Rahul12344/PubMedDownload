in sub-saharan africa, invasive nontyphoid salmonella (nts) infection common
and often fatal complication plasmodium falciparum infection. induction of
heme oxygenase-1 (ho-1) mediates tolerance cytotoxic effects heme
during malarial hemolysis might impair resistance nts limiting
production bactericidal reactive oxygen species. show co-infection 
mice plasmodium yoelii 17xnl (py17xnl) salmonella enterica serovar
typhimurium 12023 (salmonella typhimurium) causes acute, fatal bacteremia with
high bacterial load, features reproduced phenylhydrazine-induced hemolysis 
hemin administration. s. typhimurium localized predominantly granulocytes.
py17xnl, phenylhydrazine hemin caused premature mobilization granulocytes 
from bone marrow quantitative defect oxidative burst. inhibition of
ho tin protoporphyrin abrogated impairment resistance s. typhimurium
by hemolysis. thus, mechanism tolerance one infection, malaria, impairs
resistance another, nts. furthermore, ho inhibitors may useful adjunctive
therapy nts infection context hemolysis.
