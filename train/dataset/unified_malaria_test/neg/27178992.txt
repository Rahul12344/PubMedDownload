the era genome-wide association studies (gwas) led discovery of
numerous genetic variants associated disease. better understanding of
whether variants interact leading differential risk compared
with individual marker effects increase understanding genetic
architecture disease, may investigated using family-based study
design. present m-tdt (the multi-locus transmission disequilibrium test), a
tool detecting family-based multi-locus multi-allelic effects qualitative
or quantitative traits, extended original transmission disequilibrium
test (tdt). tests handle comparison additive epistatic models,
lack independence markers multiple offspring described.
performance m-tdt compared multifactor dimensionality reduction
(mdr) approach designed investigating families hypothesis-free
genome-wide setting (the multifactor dimensionality reduction pedigree
disequilibrium test, mdr-pdt). methods derived tdt mdr to
investigate genetic interaction family-based design also discussed.
the case three independent biallelic loci illustrated using simulations for
one- three-locus alternative hypotheses. m-tdt identified joint-locus effects 
and distinguished effectively additive epistatic models. showed 
practical example m-tdt based three genes already known implicated in
malaria susceptibility. findings demonstrate value m-tdt a
hypothesis-driven context test multi-way epistasis underlying common
disease etiology, whereas mdr-pdt-based methods appropriate a
hypothesis-free genome-wide setting.
