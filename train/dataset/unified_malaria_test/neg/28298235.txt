background: one major challenges control elimination malaria is
ongoing spread emergence drug resistance. epidemiology and
surveillance drug resistance falciparum malaria explored
globally, studies drug resistance vivax malaria.
methods: assess spread drug-resistant vivax malaria myanmar, a
multisite, prospective, longitudinal study retrospective analysis of
previous therapeutic efficacy studies, conducted. total 906 nine
study sites included retrospective analysis 208 three study
sites prospective study. uncomplicated vivax mono-infected patients were
recruited monitored longitudinal follow-up day 28 treatment 
with chloroquine. amplification sequence analysis molecular markers, 
as mutations pvcrt-o, pvmdr1, pvdhps pvdhfr, done day-0 samples in
prospective study.
results: clinical failure cases found kawthaung, southern myanmar
and western myanmar sites within 2009-2016. chloroquine resistance markers,
pvcrt-o 'aag' insertion pvmdr1 mutation (y976f) showed higher mutant rate 
southern central myanmar western site: 66.7, 72.7 vs 48.3% 26.7,
17.0 vs 1.7%, respectively. similar pattern significantly higher mutant rate
of antifolate resistance markers, pvdhps (s382a, k512m, a553g) pvdhfr
(f57l/i, s58r, t61m, s117t/n) noted.
conclusions: although clinical failure rate low, widespread distribution of
chloroquine antifolate resistance molecular makers alert emergence and
spread drug resistance vivax malaria myanmar. proper strategy action
plan eliminate contain resistant strain strengthened together with
clinical molecular surveillance drug resistance vivax recommended.
