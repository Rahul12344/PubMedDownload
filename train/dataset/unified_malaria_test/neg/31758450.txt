the phylum apicomplexa groups numerous pathogenic protozoan parasites including
plasmodium, causative agent malaria, cryptosporidium cause
severe gastrointestinal infections, well babesia, eimeria, theileria
that account considerable economic burdens poultry cattle industry.
toxoplasma gondii ubiquitous opportunistic member phylum 
able infect warm-blooded animals responsible severe disease in
immunocompromised individuals unborn fetuses.due ease cultivation
and genetic tractability t. gondii served recipient transfer and
adaptation multiple genetic tools developed control gene expression. in
these parasites, collection tight conditional systems exists control gene
expression levels transcription, rna degradation protein stability. 
the recent implementation crispr/cas9 technology considerably reduces time
and effort generate transgenic parasites time increases 
ultimate level precision editing parasite genome. here, provide 
a step-by-step protocol crispr/cas9-mediated generation tetracycline
repressor-based inducible knockdown t. gondii.
