locally varying selection pathogens may due differences drug
pressure, host immunity, transmission opportunities hosts, the
intensity between-genotype competition within hosts. highly recombining
populations human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum throughout west
africa closely related, gene flow relatively unrestricted this
endemic region, markedly varying ecology transmission intensity should
cause distinct local selective pressures. genome-wide analysis sequence
variation undertaken sample 100 p. falciparum clinical isolates 
a highly endemic region republic guinea transmission occurs for
most year compared data 52 clinical isolates a
previously sampled population gambia, relatively limited 
seasonal malaria transmission. paired-end short-read sequences mapped
against 3d7 p. falciparum reference genome sequence, data 136,144
single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) obtained. within-population analyses 
identifying loci showing evidence recent positive directional selection and
balancing selection confirm antimalarial drugs host immunity been
major selective agents. many signatures recent directional selection
reflected standardized integrated haplotype scores population specific,
including differences drug resistance loci due historically different
antimalarial use countries. contrast, populations showed a
similar set loci likely balancing selection indicated very
high tajima's values, including significant overrepresentation genes
expressed merozoite stage invades erythrocytes several previously
validated targets acquired immunity. between-population fst analysis
identified exceptional differentiation allele frequencies small number of
loci, markedly five snps covering 15-kb region within flanking the
gdv1 gene regulates early stages gametocyte development, is
likely related extreme differences mosquito vector abundance and
seasonality determine transmission opportunities sexual stage of
the parasite.
