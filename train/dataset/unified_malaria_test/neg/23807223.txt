the anti-malaria drug chloroquine well known autophagy inhibitor.
chloroquine also used anti-inflammatory drugs treat inflammatory
diseases. hypothesized chloroquine could dual effect liver
ischemia/reperfusion (i/r) injury: chloroquine one hand could protect 
liver i/r injury via inhibition inflammatory response, the
other hand could aggravate liver i/r injury inhibition autophagy. rats
(n=6 per group) pre-treated chloroquine (60 mg/kg, i.p.) 1 h before
warm ischemia, continuously subjected daily chloroquine
injection 2 days. rats killed 0.5, 6, 24 48 h after
reperfusion. early phase (i.e., 0-6 h reperfusion), chloroquine
treatment ameliorated liver i/r injury, indicated lower serum
aminotransferase levels, lower hepatic inflammatory cytokines fewer
histopathologic changes. contrast, chloroquine worsened liver injury the
late phase reperfusion (i.e., 24-48 h reperfusion). mechanism of
protective action chloroquine appeared involve ability modulate
mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, reduce high-mobility group box 1
release inflammatory cytokines production, whereas chloroquine worsened liver
injury via inhibition autophagy induction hepatic apoptosis late
phase. conclusion, chloroquine prevents ischemic liver damage early
phase, aggravates liver damage late phase liver i/r injury. this
dual role chloroquine considered using chloroquine an
inhibitor inflammation autophagy i/r injury.
