background: non-synonymous mutations dhfr dhps genes plasmodium vivax
are associated sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) resistance. present study 
aimed assess prevalence point mutations p. vivax dhfr (pvdhfr) and
p. vivax dhps (pvdhps) genes three countries: lao pdr, india colombia.
methods: samples 203 microscopically diagnosed vivax malaria collected 
from three countries. five codons positions 13, 57, 58, 61, 117 of
pvdhfr two codons positions 383 553 pvdhps examined by
polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methodology.
results: largest number 58r/117 n double mutations pvdhfr observed 
in colombia (94.3 %), corresponding wild-type amino acids found at
high frequencies lao pdr 2001-2004 (57.8 %). size polymorphism analysis
of tandem repeats within pvdhfr revealed 74.3 % isolates
carried type b variant. eighty-nine per cent isolates examined
carried wild-type pvdhps a383 a553.
conclusions: although sp generally used treat p. vivax infections,
mutations dhfr dhps confer antifolate resistance p. vivax are
common. data strongly suggest that, used primarily treat falciparum
malaria, sp exert substantial selective pressure p. vivax populations,
and lead point mutations dhfr dhps. accurate data the
global geographic distribution dhfr dhps genotypes help inform
anti-malarial drug-use policies.
