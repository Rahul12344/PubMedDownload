background: zoonotic malaria parasite plasmodium knowlesi become an
emerging threat south east asian countries particular malaysia. recent
study sarawak (malaysian borneo) discovered two distinct normocyte binding
protein xa (pknbpxa) types p. knowlesi. present study, pknbpxa of
clinical isolates peninsular malaysia sabah (malaysian borneo) were
investigated presence pknbpxa types natural selection force acting
on gene.
method: blood samples collected 47 clinical samples peninsular
malaysia (n = 35) sabah (malaysian borneo, n = 12) used study.
the pknbpxa gene successfully amplified directly sequenced 38 the
samples (n = 31, peninsular malaysia n = 7, sabah, malaysian borneo). the
pknbpxa sequences p. knowlesi isolates sarawak (malaysian borneo) were
retrieved genbank included analysis. polymorphism, genetic
diversity natural selection pknbpxa sequences analysed using dnasp v 
5.10, mega5. phylogentics pknbpxa sequences analysed using mrbayes v3.2
and splits tree v4.13.1. pairwise f st indices used determine the
genetic differentiation pknbpxa types calculated using
arlequin 3.5.1.3.
results: analyses sequences revealed pknbpxa dimorphism throughout
malaysia indicating co-existence two types (type-1 type-2) pknbpxa.
more importantly, third type (type 3) closely related type 2 pknbpxa was
also detected. third type found isolates originating from
peninsular malaysia. negative natural selection observed, suggesting
functional constrains within pknbpxa types.
conclusions: study revealed existence three pknbpxa types in
malaysia. types 1 2 found malaysian borneo (sarawak and
sabah) also peninsular malaysia. third type specific to
samples originating peninsular malaysia discovered. genetic
studies larger sample size necessary determine whether natural 
selection driving genetic differentiation geographical separation.
