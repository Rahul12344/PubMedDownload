it well known human innate immune adaptive immune response play
important role tuberculosis (tb) infection progress. emerging evidence
shows foxo3 plays important role human immune system. recent
research shown foxo3 genetic variants associated malaria
infection. study, 268 confirmed tb patients, 321 patients latent
tuberculosis infection (ltbi), 475 tb-free controls recruited; the
single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) rs12212067: > g foxo3 genotyped
using predesigned taqman® allelic discrimination assays. results showed 
the g allele rs12212067 foxo3 common health control the
latent tb group compared active tb group (p = 0.048, odds ratio (or) 95 
% confidence intervals (ci) = 1.37 (1.00-1.89); p = 0.042, 95 % ci = 1.42
(1.01-1.99), respectively); furthermore, within active tb patients, g allele 
of rs12212067 foxo3 frequent extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (eptb)
group compared pulmonary tuberculosis (ptb) group (p = 0.035, 95 %
ci = 0.57 (0.33-0.97). conclusion, study found rs12212067 foxo3
was associated increased risk active tb. minor g allele might a
protection factor found common latent tb patients healthy
controls active tb patients.
