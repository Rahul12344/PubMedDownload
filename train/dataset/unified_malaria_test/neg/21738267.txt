the use sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (sp) treatment vivax malaria is
uncommon malarious areas, plasmodium vivax isolates exposed sp
because mixed infections plasmodium species. p. vivax the
most prevalent species human malaria parasites iran, monitoring of
resistance parasite drug necessary. present study,
50 blood samples symptomatic patients collected 4 separated
geographical regions south-east iran. point mutations residues 57, 58, 61, 
and 117 detected pcr-rflp method. polymorphism positions 58r,
117n, 117t p. vivax dihydrofolate reductase (pvdhfr) gene found
in 12%, 34%, 2% isolates, respectively. mutation residues f57 t61
was detected. five distinct haplotypes pvdhfr gene demonstrated. 
the 2 prevalent haplotypes f57s58t61s117 (62%) f57s58t61n117 (24%).
haplotypes 3 4 point mutations found. present study
suggested p. vivax iran pressure sp sensitivity

development malaria control programs.
