background: genetic diversity plasmodium falciparum extensively
studied various countries. however, limited data available ethiopia. 
this study conducted evaluate extent genetic diversity p.
falciparum kolla-shele, southwest ethiopia.
methods: total 88 isolates patients uncomplicated p. falciparum
attending kolla-shele health centre collected september december,
2008. extraction dna chelex method, samples genotyped by
using nested-pcr msp1 (block 2) msp2 (block 3) including allelic
families: k1, mad20, ro33 fc27, 3d7/ic1, respectively.
results: allelic variation msp1 msp2 identified 88 blood 
samples. msp1 67% (59/88) msp2 44% (39/88) observed. k1 the
predominant msp1 allelic family observed 33.9% (20/59) samples followed
by ro33 mad20. msp2 allelic family 3d7/ic1 showed higher frequency
(21.5%) compared fc27 (10.3%). total twenty-three alleles detected; 
of which, eleven msp2 twelve msp2 genes. fifty-nine percent of
isolates multiple genotypes overall mean multiplicity infection
was 1.8 (95% ci: 1.48-2.04). heterozygosity index 0.79 0.54for msp1
and msp2, respectively. statically significant difference the
multiplicity infection either age parasite density (p > 0.05).
conclusion: genetic diversity study showed presence five allelic
types study area, dominance k1 msp1 family 3d7/ic1 
msp2 family. multiple infections observed nearly 60% samples.
