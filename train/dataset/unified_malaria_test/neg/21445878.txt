artemisinin derivatives well known antimalaria drugs, particularly
useful treatment infection plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites 
resistant traditional antimalarial pharmaceuticals. artemisinin inhibitory
effects cancer cell growth anti-angiogenetic activity, including many
drug- radiation-resistant cancer cell lines. moloney murine leukemia virus
insertion site 1 (bmi-1) shown regulate proliferation inhibiting
p16(ink4a) transcription. well known bmi-1 over-expression found
in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines correlated advanced invasive
stage tumor progression poor prognosis. present investigation, 
we analyzed inhibitory effects artemisinin proliferation of
nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines (cne-1 cne-2, well-differentiated cells, 
and poorly differentiated cells). demonstrated artemisinin induced g1
cell cycle arrest cne-1 cne-2 cells. artemisinin inhibited bmi-1 in
protein transcript levels. bmi-1 knockdown made cells sensitive to
artemisinin increase g1 phase, over-expression bmi-1 partially 
reversed artemisinin-induced g1 cell cycle arrest. depletion bmi-1 was
able intensifying increment p16 reduction cdk4 induced by
artemisinin. addition, over-expression bmi-1 capable attenuating the
increasing p16 decreasing cdk4 cells treated artemisinin. taking
together, bmi1-p16/cdk4 axis involved artemisinin-driven g1 arrest
in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, results indicated potential
treatment combination artemisinin bmi-1 downregulation could
enhance growth inhibitory affects nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.
