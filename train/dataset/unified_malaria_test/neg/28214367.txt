to determine whether major human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum
exhibits fragmented population structure local adaptation northern
limit african distribution dry sahel zone meets sahara,
samples collected diverse locations within mauritania range of
~1000 km. microsatellite genotypes obtained 203 clinical infection
samples eight locations, illumina paired-end sequences obtained 
yield high coverage genomewide single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) data 65
clinical infection samples four locations. infections contained single 
parasite genotypes, reflecting low rates transmission superinfection
locally, contrast situation seen population samples countries
further south. minority infections shared related identical genotypes
locally, indicating repeated transmission parasite clones without
recombination. caused multilocus linkage disequilibrium local
divergence, aside effect repeated genotypes minimal
differentiation locations. several chromosomal regions elevated
integrated haplotype scores (|ihs|) indicating recent selection, including 
containing drug resistance genes. genomewide fst scan comparison previous 
sequence data area west africa higher infection endemicity
indicates regional gene flow prevents genetic isolation, revealed allele
frequency differentiation three drug resistance loci erythrocyte
invasion ligand gene. contrast extended haplotype signatures revealed none 
be unique mauritania. discrete foci infection edge sahara are
genetically highly connected wider continental parasite population, and
local elimination would difficult achieve without substantial
reduction malaria throughout region.
