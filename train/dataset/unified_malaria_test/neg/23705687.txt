background: control vector-borne diseases, malaria, dengue fever, 
and typhus fever often achieved use insecticides. unfortunately,
insecticide resistance becoming common among different vector species. there
are currently chemical alternatives insecticides new
human-safe classes molecules yet brought vector-control
market. identification novel targets offer opportunities rational
design new chemistries control vector populations. one target family, g
protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs), remained relatively explored in
terms insecticide development.
methods: novel classifier, ensemble*, vector gpcrs developed. ensemble*
was validated compared existing classifiers using set known gpcrs
from aedes aegypti, anopheles gambiae, apis mellifera, drosophila melanogaster,
homo sapiens, pediculus humanus. predictions unidentified sequences 
ae. aegypti, an. gambiae, pe. humanus validated. quantitative rt-pcr
expression analysis performed previously-known newly discovered ae.
aegypti gpcr genes.
results: present new analysis gpcrs genomes ae, aegypti, a
vector dengue fever, an. gambiae, primary vector plasmodium falciparum
that causes malaria, pe. humanus, vector epidemic typhus fever, using 
novel gpcr classifier, ensemble*, designed insect vector species. we
identified 30 additional putative gpcrs, 19 validated. expression 
the newly discovered ae. aegypti gpcr genes confirmed via quantitative
rt-pcr.
conclusion: novel gpcr classifier insect vectors, ensemble*, developed 
and gpcr predictions validated. ensemble* validation pipeline were
applied genomes three insect vectors (ae. aegypti, an. gambiae, pe.
humanus), resulting identification 52 gpcrs previously identified, 
of 11 predicted gpcrs, 19 predicted confirmed gpcrs.
