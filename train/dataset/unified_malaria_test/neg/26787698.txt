the discovery new antimalarial drugs able target asexual and
gametocyte stages ofplasmodium falciparumis critical success the
malaria eradication campaign. developed validated robust, rapid,
and cost-effective high-throughput reporter gene assay identify compounds
active late-stage (stage iv v) gametocytes. assay, is
suitable testing compound activity incubation times 72 h,
demonstrates excellent quality reproducibility, averagez' values 0.85
± 0.01. used assay screen 10,000 compounds three
chemically diverse libraries. screening outcomes highlighted opportunity 
to use collections compounds known activity asexual stages of
the parasites starting point gametocytocidal activity detection order
to maximize chances identifying gametocytocidal compounds. assay
extends capabilities previously reported luciferase assay, which
tested compounds early-stage gametocytes, opens possibilities to
profile activities gametocytocidal compounds entire course of
gametocytogenesis.
