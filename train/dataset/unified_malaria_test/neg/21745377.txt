background: 2005, ghana replaced chloroquine artemisinin-based
combination therapy first-line treatment uncomplicated malaria. the
aim work determine first time, polymorphisms the
putative pfatpase6 pftctp, pfmdr1, pfcrt genes ghanaian isolates,
particularly time report artemisinin resistance in
malaria parasites ghana. sensitivity parasite isolates to
anti-malaria drugs also evaluated possible association with
polymorphisms genes.
methods: prevalence point mutations plasmodium falciparum
genes assessed filter-paper blood blot samples dna sequencing. in
vitro drug sensitivity test carried blood samples from
volunteers visiting hospitals/clinics southern ghana using modified version 
of standard mark iii micro-test.
results: successfully tested parasite isolates sensitive artesunate; 
while 19.4%, 29.0% 51.6% resistant quinine, amodiaquine and
chloroquine respectively. geometric mean ic50 value artesunate was
0.73 nm (95% ci, 0.38-1.08), amodiaquine 30.69 nm (95% ci, 14.18-47.20) and
chloroquine 58.73 nm (95% ci, 38.08-79.38). twenty point mutations observed 
in pfatpase6 gene, l263e s769n. mutations found low in
frequency, except d639g observed half isolates 
not associated artesunate response (p = 0.42). pftctp gene highly
conserved mutation observed, cviet chloroquine-resistant
genotype codon 72-76 pfcrt gene identified half the
isolates; consistent chloroquine ic50 values (p = 0.001). mutations
were present pfmdr1 gene associated artemisinin response (p 
= 1.00).
conclusion: pfatpase6 gene highly polymorphic d639g appearing be
fixed ghanaian isolates. may spontaneous mutations all
parasite isolates tested displayed satisfactory vitro response to
artesunate. however, improvement susceptibility parasites
to chloroquine five years proscription.
