ruvb, member aaa+ (atpases associated diverse cellular activities)
superfamily proteins, essential, highly conserved multifunctional in
nature involved dna damage repair, mitotic assembly, switching of
histone variants assembly telomerase core complex. ruvb family widely
studied various systems escherichia coli, yeast, human, drosophila,
plasmodium falciparum mouse, well studied plants. studied 
the transcript level rice homologue ruvb gene (osruvbl1a) various
abiotic stress conditions, results suggest upregulated under
salinity, cold heat stress. therefore, osruvbl1a protein was
characterized using silico biochemical approaches. silico study
confirmed presence four characteristic motifs aaa+
superfamily-walker a, walker b, sensor sensor ii. structurally, osruvbl1a
is similar ruvb1 chaetomium thermophilum. purified recombinant
osruvbl1a protein shows unique dna-independent atpase activity. using
site-directed mutagenesis, importance two conserved motifs (walker b and
sensor i) atpase activity also reported mutants d302n n332h.
the osruvbl1a protein unwinds duplex dna 3' 5' direction. the
presence unique dna-independent atpase dna unwinding activities of
osruvbl1a protein upregulation transcript abiotic stress
conditions suggest involvement multiple cellular pathways. first
detailed characterization plant ruvbl1a study may provide important
contribution exploiting role ruvb developing stress tolerant
plants agricultural importance.
