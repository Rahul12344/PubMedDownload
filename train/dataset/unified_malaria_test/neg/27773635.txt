aquaporins (aqps) family membrane-bound proteins, originally described
as water-channels, broadly exist prokaryotic eukaryotic cells.
however, aqps transport small molecules (e.g. urea, glycerol) along with
or preferentially water. previous work mosquitoes aedes aegypti and
anopheles gambiae characterized molecular expression one aqp 
genes shown involved water homeostasis blood feeding, 
tolerance dehydration heat stresses, development plasmodium
falciparum mosquito. however, molecular expression aqps the
northern house mosquito culex pipiens, primary vector west nile virus, 
presently unknown. characterize relative mrna expression six aqp
genes c. pipiens. used quantitative rt-pcr (qpcr) compare aqp mrna
levels 1) among different life stages sexes, 2) blood fed and
non-blood fed adult females, 3) adult females injected with
phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) non-injected females, 4) adult
females exposed low vs. high relative humidity. found that: 1) four aqp
mrnas (drip, bib, eglp1, aqp12l) differentially expressed larval and
adult life stages, sexes; 2) blood meal, expression
of two aqp mrnas (drip aqp12l) down-regulated one aqp mrna (eglp2)
was up-regulated; 3) expression two aqp mrnas (drip prip) were
down-regulated one aqp mrna (eglp1) regulated injecting the
hemolymph mosquitoes pbs; 4) expression prip eglp2 mrnas
were down-regulated response low relative humidity. study the
first characterize molecular expression patterns aqps c. pipiens,
thus providing foundation future research elucidating physiological and
functional roles aqps important disease vector.
