purpose: successful pregnancy relies interplay various biological
systems. deviations norm within system intersystemic interactions
may result pregnancy-associated complications adverse pregnancy outcomes. 
systems biology approaches provide avenue unbiased, in-depth phenotyping in
health disease. molecular signature pregnancy (msp) cohort was
established characterise longitudinal, cross-omic trajectories pregnant
women resource constrained setting. downstream analysis focus on
characterising physiological perturbations uneventful pregnancies,
pregnancy-associated complications adverse outcomes.
participants: first trimester pregnant women karen burman ethnicity were
followed prospectively throughout pregnancy, delivery 3 months post 
partum. serial high-frequency sampling assess whole blood transcriptomics 
microbiome composition gut, vagina oral cavity, conjunction with
assessment gene expression microbial colonisation gestational tissue,
was done cohort participants.
findings date: 381 women live born singletons averaged 16 (iqr 15-18)
antenatal visits (13 094 biological samples collected). 5% (19/381) the
preterm birth rate low. adverse events maternal febrile illness
7.1% (27/381), gestational diabetes 13.1% (50/381), maternal anaemia 16.3%
(62/381), maternal underweight 19.2% (73/381) neonate born small for
gestational age 20.2% (77/381) often observed preterm birth.
future plans: results msp cohort enable in-depth characterisation
of cross-omic molecular trajectories pregnancies population a
resource-constrained setting. moreover, pregnancy-associated complications and
unfavourable pregnancy outcomes investigated granular level, 
with particular focus population relevant needs effect tropical
infections pregnancy. detailed knowledge multiomic perturbations 
ideally result development diagnostic tools ultimately lead to
targeted interventions may disproportionally benefit pregnant women from
this resource-limited population.
