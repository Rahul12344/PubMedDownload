plasmodium knowlesi newly described zoonosis causes malaria the
human population severe fatal. study p. knowlesi parasites
from human clinical isolates relatively new and, order obtain maximum
information patient sample collections, explored possibility of
generating p. knowlesi genome sequences archived clinical isolates. our
patient sample collection consisted frozen whole blood samples contained 
excessive human dna contamination and, form, suitable for
parasite genome sequencing. developed method reduce amount human
dna thawed blood samples preparation high throughput parasite
genome sequencing using illumina hiseq miseq sequencing platforms. seven of
fifteen samples processed sufficiently pure p. knowlesi dna whole genome 
sequencing. reads mapped p. knowlesi h strain reference genome
and average mapping 90% obtained. genes low coverage removed 
leaving 4623 genes subsequent analyses. previously identified dna
sequence dimorphism small fragment p. knowlesi normocyte binding
protein xa gene chromosome 14. used genome data assemble full-length
pknbpxa sequences discovered dimorphism extended along gene. 
in-house algorithm developed detect snp sites co-associating the
dimorphism. half p. knowlesi genome dimorphic, involving
genes chromosomes suggesting two distinct types p. knowlesi
infect human population sarawak, malaysian borneo. use p. knowlesi
clinical samples demonstrate plasmodium dna archived patient samples
can produce high quality genome data. show analyses, even small
numbers difficult clinical malaria isolates, generate comprehensive
genomic information improve understanding malaria parasite
diversity pathobiology.
