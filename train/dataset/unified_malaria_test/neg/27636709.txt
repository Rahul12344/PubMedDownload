most plasmodium falciparum-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) target
histidine-rich protein 2 (pfhrp2). however, p. falciparum isolates deletion 
of pfhrp2 gene homolog gene, pfhrp3, detected. carried
out extensive investigation 365 p. falciparum dried blood samples collected
from seven p. falciparum endemic sites colombia 2003 2012 to
genetically characterise geographically map pfhrp2- and/or pfhrp3-negative p.
falciparum parasites country. found high proportion of
pfhrp2-negative parasites amazonas (15/39; 38.5%), parasites
were also pfhrp3-negative. parasites collected 2008 2009
in amazonas, pfhrp3-negative parasites (157/365, 43%) found the
sites sample collection years evaluated (2003 2012). we
also found pfhrp2- and/or pfhrp3-negative parasites also negative
for one flanking genes. six sub-population clusters established with
93.3% (14/15) pfhrp2-negative parasites grouped cluster and
sharing haplotype. haplotype corresponded genetic lineage 
bv1, multidrug resistant strain caused two outbreaks reported peru
between 2010 2013. found bv1 lineage colombian amazon early
as 2006. two new clonal lineages identified parasites from
colombia: genetic lineages ev1 f. pfhrp2 sequence analysis revealed high 
genetic diversity amino acid level, 17 unique sequences identified
among 53 pfhrp2 sequences analysed. use pfhrp2-based rdts not
recommended amazonas high proportion parasites pfhrp2
deletion (38.5%), implementation new strategies malaria diagnosis 
control amazonas must prioritised. moreover, studies monitor and
genetically characterise pfhrp2-negative p. falciparum parasites americas 
are warranted, given extensive human migration occurring region.
