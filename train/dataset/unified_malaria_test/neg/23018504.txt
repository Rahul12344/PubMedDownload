the involvement interleukin-18 (il-18) effects modulating its
release course malaria infection investigated using plasmodium
berghei anka infection icr mice model. results demonstrated plasma
il-18 concentrations malarial mice significantly elevated positively 
correlated percentage parasitaemia development. significant expressions 
of il-18 also observed brain, spleen liver tissues. slower
development parasitaemia observed significantly upon inhibition and
neutralization il-18, whereas faster development parasitaemia recorded 
when circulating levels il-18 augmented infection.
inhibition neutralization il-18 production also resulted significant 
decrease plasma concentrations pro-inflammatory cytokines (tnfα, ifnγ,
il-1α il-6), whereas anti-inflammatory cytokine, il-10, significantly
increased. augmenting release il- 18 infection other
hand resulted opposite. early mortality malarial mice also observed
when circulating levels il-18 augmented. results proved the
important role il-18 immune response malaria suggest il-8 
is pro-inflammatory nature may involve mediating severity the
infection pathway elevating pro-inflammatory cytokine and
limiting release anti-inflammatory cytokine.
