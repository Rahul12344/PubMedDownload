in animal models experimental cerebral malaria (ecm), the
glycosylphosphatidylinositols (gpis) gpi anchors major factors that
induce nuclear factor kappa b (nf-κb) activation proinflammatory responses,
which contribute malaria pathogenesis. gpis gpi anchors transported to
the cell surface via process called gpi transamidation, involves gpi 
transamidase (gpi-t) complex. study, showed gpi16, one the
gpi-t subunits, highly conserved among plasmodium species. genetic knockout of
pbgpi16 (δpbgpi16) rodent malaria parasite plasmodium berghei strain anka 
led significant reduction amounts gpis membranes of
merozoites, well surface display several gpi-anchored merozoite surface 
proteins. compared wild-type parasites, δpbgpi16 parasites c57bl/6
mice caused much less nf-κb activation elicited substantially attenuated 
helper type 1 response. result, δpbgpi16 mutant-infected mice displayed much
less severe brain pathology, considerably fewer δpbgpi16 mutant-infected mice
died ecm. study corroborated gpi toxin significant inducer 
ecm suggested vaccines parasite gpis may promising 
strategy limit severity malaria.
