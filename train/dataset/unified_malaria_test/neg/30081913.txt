background: although use induced blood stage malaria infection proven 
to valuable tool testing efficacy vaccines drugs against
plasmodium falciparum, limiting factor availability good
manufacturing practice (gmp)-compliant defined p. falciparum strains vivo 
use. aim study develop cost-effective method the
large-scale production p. falciparum cell banks suitable use clinical
trials.
methods: genetically-attenuated parasites (gap) produced targeted
deletion gene encoding knob associated histidine rich protein (kahrp) 
from p. falciparum strain 3d7. gap master cell bank (mcb) manufactured by
culturing parasites fda approved single use, closed system sterile plastic 
bioreactor. components used manufacture mcb screened comply
with standards appropriate vivo use. cryopreserved mcb subjected
to extensive testing ensure gmp compliance phase 1 investigational
product.
results: two hundred vials gap mcb successfully manufactured. at
harvest, gap mcb parasitaemia 6.3%, 96% parasites ring
stage. testing confirmed release criteria met (sterility, absence
of viral contaminants endotoxins, parasite viability following
cryopreservation, identity anti-malarial drug sensitivity parasites).
conclusion: large-scale vitro culture p. falciparum parasites using wave 
bioreactor achieved gmp-compliant conditions. provides a
cost-effective methodology production malaria parasites suitable for
administration clinical trials.
