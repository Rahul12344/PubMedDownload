plasmodium vivax infects hundred million people annually endangers 40% of
the world's population. unlike plasmodium falciparum, p. vivax parasites can
persist dormant stage liver, known hypnozoite, these
dormant forms cause malaria relapses months years initial
mosquito bite. analyze whole genome sequencing data parasites the
blood patient experienced consecutive p. vivax relapses 33 months
in non-endemic country. analyzing patterns identity, read coverage, and
the presence absence minor alleles initial polyclonal subsequent
monoclonal infections, show parasites three infections are
likely meiotic siblings. infer siblings descended single
tetrad-like form developed infecting mosquito midgut shortly after
fertilization. natural cross find recombination rate p. vivax 
to 10 kb per centimorgan observe areas disequilibrium
surrounding major drug resistance genes. data provide new strategies for
studying multiclonal infections, common types infectious
diseases, distinguishing p. vivax relapses reinfections malaria
endemic regions. work provides theoretical foundation studies aim
to determine new existing drugs provide radical cure p. vivax
malaria.
