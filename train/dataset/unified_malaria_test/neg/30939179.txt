background: vietnam, rapid decline p. falciparum malaria cases been
documented past years, number plasmodium falciparum malaria cases
has rapidly decreased passing 19.638 2012 4.073 cases 2016.
concomitantly, spread artemisinin resistance markers raising concern on
the future efficacy acts. evaluation clinical impact the
artemisinin resistance markers therefore interest.
methods: clinical effectiveness dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine therapy
(dha-ppq) evaluated three districts characterized different rates 
of art resistance markers: k13(c580y) mutation delayed parasite clearance 
day 3 (dpc3). patients stratified 3 groups a) markers, b) one marker
(suspected resistance), c) co-presence markers (confirmed resistance). in
the studied areas, clinical effectiveness dha-ppq estimated as
malaria recrudescence within 60 days.
results: rate k13(c580y) ranged 75.8% krong pa 1.2% huong
hoa district. dpc3 prevalence higher krong pa huong hoa (86.2% vs 
39.3%). two districts, prevalence confirmed resistance found in
69.0% 1.2% patients, respectively. thuan bac district, found
intermediate prevalence confirmed resistance. treatment failure not
evidenced district. ppq resistance evidenced. confirmed resistance
was associated persistence parasites day 28 3.4-fold higher
parasite density diagnosis. effectiveness malaria control strategies
was high studied districts.
conclusion: treatment failure observed presence high prevalence
of art resistance absence ppq resistance. k13(c580y) strongly
associated higher parasitemia admission, days 3 28. slower parasite 
clearance also observed younger patients.
