epigenetic mechanisms emerging one major factors dynamics of
gene expression human malaria parasite, plasmodium falciparum. to
elucidate role chromatin remodeling transcriptional regulation
associated progression p. falciparum intraerythrocytic
development cycle (idc), mapped temporal pattern chromosomal
association histone h3 h4 modifications using chip-on-chip. here, we
have generated broad integrative epigenomic map twelve histone modifications
during p. falciparum idc including h4k5ac, h4k8ac, h4k12ac, h4k16ac, h3k9ac, 
h3k14ac, h3k56ac, h4k20me1, h4k20me3, h3k4me3, h3k79me3 h4r3me2. some
modifications found associated vast majority genome
and occupancy constant, others showed specific highly dynamic 
distribution. importantly, eight modifications displaying tight correlations with
transcript levels showed differential affinity distinct genomic regions with
h4k8ac occupying predominantly promoter regions others occurred 5'
ends coding sequences. promoter occupancy h4k8ac remained unchanged
when ectopically inserted different locus, indicating presence of
specific dna elements recruit histone modifying enzymes regardless 
broad chromatin environment. addition, showed presence multivalent
domains genome carrying one histone mark, highlighting the
importance combinatorial effects transcription. overall, work portrays 
a substantial association chromosomal locations various epigenetic
markers, transcriptional activity global stage-specific transitions the
epigenome.
