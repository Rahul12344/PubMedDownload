protein export considered essential feature malaria parasite blood stage
development. here, examined five components candidate plasmodium
translocon exported proteins (ptex), complex thought mediate protein
export across parasitophorous vacuole membrane host cell. using 
murine malaria model parasite plasmodium berghei, succeeded generating
parasite lines lacking ptex88 thioredoxin 2 (trx2). repeated attempts to
delete remaining three translocon components failed, suggesting essential
functions exp2, ptex150, heat shock protein 101 (hsp101) blood
stage development. analyze blood infections null-mutants, we
established flow cytometry-assisted intravital competition assay using three
novel high fluorescent lines (bergreen, beryellow, berred). although blood
stage development parasites lacking trx2 affected, deficit much
more striking ptex88 null-mutants. multiplication rate ptex88-deficient
parasites strongly reduced resulting out-competition wild-type
parasites. endogenous tagging revealed trx2::tag resides distinct
punctate organelles unknown identity. ptex88::tag shows diffuse
intraparasitic pattern blood stage parasites. trophozoites, ptex88::tag
also localized previously unrecognized extensions reaching parasite
surface erythrocyte cytoplasm. together, results indicate auxiliary 
roles trx2 ptex88 central roles exp2, ptex150, hsp101 
p. berghei blood infection.
