background & objectives: interest insect glutathione s-transferases (gsts) has
primarily focused role insecticide resistance. play an
important role biotransformation detoxification many different
xenobiotic endogenous substances including insecticides. gst activity
among 10 laboratory selected insecticide resistant susceptible/control
strains anopheles stephensi compared using substrates
1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (cdnb). difference gst activities of
different life stages diverse insecticide resistant strains compared and
presented.
methods: 100 larvae, pupae, adult males, adult females eggs (100 Î¼g 
total weight) collected used experiment. extracts were
prepared insecticide-resistant strains control. protein
contents enzyme homogenate gst activities determined.
results: deltamethrin cyfluthrin-resistant strains an. stephensi showed
significantly higher gst activity. larvae pupae ddt-resistant strain
showed peak gst activity followed propoxur-resistant strain. contrary, 
the gst activity found reduced quantity alphamethrin, bifenthrin,
carbofuran chloropyrifos resistant strains. adults either sexes showed
higher gst activity mosquito strain resistant organophosphate group of
insecticides namely, temephos chloropyrifos.
interpretation & conclusion: gst activity closely associated almost 
all insecticides used study, strengthening fact one the
mechanisms associated resistance includes increase gst activity. 
comparative data gst activity an. stephensi useful database to
identify possible underlying mechanisms governing insecticide-resistance gsts.
