in prokaryotes, horizontal gene transfer (hgt) regarded important 
evolutionary drive acquire retain beneficial genes survival in
diverse ecologies. however, eukaryotes, functional role hgts remains
questionable, although current genomic tools providing increased evidence 
acquisition novel traits within non-mating metazoan species. here, provide 
another transcriptomic evidence acquisition massive plant genes the
mosquito, anopheles culicifacies. multiple experimental validations including
genomic pcr, rt-pcr, real-time pcr, immuno-blotting immuno-florescence
microscopy, confirmed plant like transcripts (plts) mosquito origin
and may encode functional proteins. comprehensive molecular analysis the
plts ongoing metagenomic analysis salivary microbiome provide initial
clues mosquitoes may survival benefits acquisition of
nuclear well chloroplast encoded plant genes. findings plts 
support similar questionable observation hgts higher organisms,
which still controversial debatable issue community of
evolutionists. believe future understanding underlying mechanism the
feeding associated molecular responses may shed new insights functional
role plts mosquito.
