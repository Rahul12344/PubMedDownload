background: emergence spread insecticide resistance major
african malaria vectors anopheles gambiae (s.s.) an. arabiensis may
compromise current vector control interventions threatens global
malaria control elimination efforts.
methods: insecticide resistance monitored several study sites ethiopia 
from 2013 2015 using papers impregnated discriminating concentrations 
ddt, deltamethrin, bendiocarb, propoxur, malathion, fenitrothion and
pirimiphos-methyl, following insecticide susceptibility test procedure.
mosquitoes sampled different localities bioassay were
morphologically identified an. gambiae (s.l.) using standard taxonomic keys.
samples identified species using species-specific polymerase chain
reaction (pcr) screened presence target site mutations l1014f,
l1014s n1575y voltage gated sodium channel (vgsc) gene g119s in
the acethylcholinesterase (ache) gene using allele-specific pcr. biochemical
assays performed assess elevated levels acetylcholinesterases,
carboxylcholinesterases, glutathione-s-transferases (gsts) cytochrome p450s
monooxygenases wild populations an. arabiensis, compared fully
susceptible sekoru an. arabiensis laboratory strain.
results: populations an. arabiensis resistant ddt deltamethrin but
were susceptible fenitrothion study sites. reduced susceptibility
to malathion, pirimiphos-methyl, propoxur bendiocarb observed 
the study sites. knockdown resistance (kdr l1014f) detected mosquito
populations allele frequency ranging 42 91%. elevated levels of
glutathione-s-transferases (gsts) detected mosquito
populations. however, elevated levels monooxygenases esterases were
detected populations assessed.
conclusions: anopheles arabiensis populations surveyed sites ethiopia
exhibited resistance ddt pyrethroids. moreover, mosquito
populations exhibited resistance propoxur possible resistance to
bendiocarb. target site mutation kdr l1014f detected mosquito
populations elevated levels glutathione-s-transferases (gsts) was
detected mosquito populations. reduced susceptibility an.
arabiensis propoxur bendiocarb, currently used indoor
residual spraying (irs) ethiopia, calls continuous resistance monitoring, 
in order plan implement evidence based insecticide resistance management.
