2018 marks 100-year anniversary 1918 influenza pandemic, killed 
~50 million people worldwide. severity pandemic resulted a
complex interplay viral, host, societal factors. here, review 
viral, genetic immune factors contributed severity 1918
pandemic discuss implications modern pandemic preparedness. we
address unresolved questions 1918 influenza h1n1 virus more
virulent influenza pandemics people survived 1918
pandemic others succumbed infection. current studies suggest
that viral factors haemagglutinin polymerase gene segments most
likely contributed potent, dysregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine storm in
victims pandemic, shift case-fatality 1918 pandemic toward
young adults likely associated host's immune status. lack of
pre-existing virus-specific and/or cross-reactive antibodies cellular
immunity children young adults likely contributed high attack rate 
and rapid spread 1918 h1n1 virus. contrast, lower mortality rate 
the older (>30 years) adult population points toward beneficial effects of
pre-existing cross-reactive immunity. addition role humoral and
cellular immunity, growing body evidence suggest individual
genetic differences, especially involving single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps),
contribute differences severity influenza virus infections.
co-infections bacterial pathogens, possibly measles malaria,
co-morbidities, malnutrition obesity also known affect severity 
influenza disease, likely influenced 1918 h1n1 disease severity outcomes.
additionally, also discuss new challenges, changing population
demographics, antibiotic resistance climate change, face the
context future influenza virus pandemic. last decade been
a dramatic increase number severe influenza virus strains entering 
human population animal reservoirs (including highly pathogenic h7n9 and
h5n1 viruses). understanding past influenza virus pandemics lessons
that learnt therefore never pertinent.
