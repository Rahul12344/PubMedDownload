the protozoan parasites cause malaria infect wide variety vertebrate
hosts, including birds, reptiles, mammals, evolutionary pressures
inherent host-parasite relationship profoundly shaped genomes 
both host parasite. here, report selective pressures have
resulted unexpected alterations one basic aspects eukaryotic
biology, maintenance genome integrity dna repair. malaria
parasites infect humans continuously generate genetic diversity within their
antigen-encoding gene families frequent ectopic recombination between
gene family members, process crucial feature persistence of
malaria globally. continuous generation antigen diversity ensures that
different parasite isolates antigenically distinct, thus preventing extensive
cross-reactive immunity enabling parasites maintain stable transmission
within human populations. however, molecular basis recombination
between gene family members well understood. computational
analyses antigen-encoding, multicopy gene families different plasmodium
species, report unexpected observation malaria parasites infect 
rodents display degree antigen diversity observed in
plasmodium falciparum appear undergo significantly less ectopic
recombination. using comparative genomics, also identify key molecular
components diversification process, thus shedding new light malaria
parasites balance maintenance genome integrity requirement for
continuous genetic diversification.importance malaria remains one most
prevalent deadly infectious diseases developing world, causing
approximately 228 million clinical cases nearly half million deaths
annually. disease caused protozoan parasites genus plasmodium,
and five species capable infecting humans, infections p.
falciparum severe. addition parasites infect people, 
there hundreds additional species infect birds, reptiles, other
mammals, exquisitely evolved meet specific challenges inherent to
survival within respective hosts. comparing unique strategies that
each species evolved, key insights host-parasite interactions be
gained, including discoveries regarding pathogenesis human disease. here, 
we describe surprising observation closely related parasites with
different hosts evolved remarkably different methods repairing their
genomes. observation important implications ability parasites
to maintain chronic infections development host immunity.
