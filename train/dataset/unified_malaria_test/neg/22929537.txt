background: rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) revolutionized diagnosis of
malaria. among various factors affecting rdts sensitivity genetic
variation antigen used. genetic variation pfhrp2 pfhrp3
proteins studied among indian plasmodium falciparum isolates.
methods: one hundred forty isolates p. falciparum collected six 
geographical regions india. target genes encoding pfhrp2 pfhrp3 antigens
were sequenced study genetic polymorphism. minimum detection limit giving a
positive rapid diagnostic test also determined.
results: extensive variations observed amino acid repeat types pfhrp2 
and pfhrp3. pfhrp2 exhibited polymorphism pfhrp3. significant relation 
was observed type 2 type 7 repeats rdt detection rate higher
number repeats showed better sensitivity rdts.
conclusion: results provide insights genetic diversity pfhrp2 and
pfhrp3 genes among indian p. falciparum population relation rdt
sensitivity.
