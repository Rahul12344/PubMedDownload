resistance plasmodium falciparum artemisinin combination therapy (act) in
southeast asia devastating impact chemotherapy control
measures. study, evolution artemisinin-resistant p. falciparum 
thailand assessed exploring mutations k13 locus believed confer 
drug resistance phenotype. p. falciparum-infected blood samples obtained
from patients eight provinces thailand two decades (1991-2014; n =
904). analysis k13 gene performed either sequencing complete
coding region (n = 259) mutation-specific pcr-restriction fragment length
polymorphism method (n = 645). k13 mutations related artesunate resistance
were detected isolates trat province bordering cambodia 1991, 4 
years preceding widespread deployment act thailand increased in
frequency time. nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity exceeded synonymous
nucleotide diversity propeller region k13 gene, supporting the
hypothesis diversity driven natural selection. single mutant 
appeared favoured every population, propeller-region mutants were
rarely observed linkage haplotype. other
hand, highly significant association occurrence a
propeller mutant insertion two three asparagines residue 139 
of k13. whether insertion plays compensatory role deleterious effects 
of propeller mutants function k13 protein requires further
investigation. however, modification duration act 2-day 3-day
regimens 2008 throughout country halt increase frequency
of mutants conferring artemisinin resistance phenotype.
