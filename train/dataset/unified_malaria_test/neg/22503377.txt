in regions high plasmodium falciparum malaria endemicity, certain erythrocyte 
polymorphisms confer resistance severe disease. study, evaluate the
role sickle cell trait (hbs) abo blood groups clinical
manifestations childhood malaria southwest nigeria. subjects comprised 
3100 children (53% males, median age 39 months), including 1400 children with
uncomplicated malaria, 1000 children asymptomatic malaria 700 with
severe malaria. haemoglobin (hb) types determined using electrophoresis 
serum agglutination techniques used determine abo blood groups. blood
group commonest abo blood group (47.7%) study population, the
others (22.5%), b (25.2%) ab (4.6%). frequencies hbas and
hbac 14.4% 5.8%, respectively. regression models adjusting age,
gender, parasite density blood group, hbas associated reduced risk
of severe malaria or=0.46 (ci(95%): 0.273-0.773). among severe malaria subjects, 
hbas associated significantly lower parasite densities. protective
effect blood group demonstrated decreased risk severe malaria 
or=0.743 (ci(95%): 0.566-0.976) adjusting age, gender parasite
density hb genotype. blood group b associated increased risk of
severe malaria or=1.638 (ci(95%): 1.128-2.380) adjusting age, gender,
packed cell volume, parasite density hb genotype. confirmed this
large study nigerian children major protective effective sickle
cell heterozygous state cerebral malaria severe malarial
anaemia. also show b blood group associated increased risk
of severe malaria. conclusion, sickle cell haemoglobin type abo groups
modulate risk severe malaria nigerian children.
