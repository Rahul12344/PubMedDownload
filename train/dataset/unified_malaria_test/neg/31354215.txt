objective: tumor microenvironment, especially host immune system, plays a
pivotal role tumor initiation progression. profiling immune signature
within tumor might uncover biomarkers targeted therapies clinical
outcomes. however, systematic analysis immune-related genes gastric cancer 
(gc) reported.
methods: expressions total 718 immune-related genes generated 372
stomach adenocarcinoma (stad) patients cancer genome atlas (tcga)
database using rna-sequencing data. integrated bioinformatics analyses were
performed identify prognostic factors well.
results: survival analyses revealed 73 genes, significantly associated
with patient's overall survival (os). taken together clinicopathological
parameters, established predictive model, containing 10 immune-related
genes, nrp1, c6, cxcr4, lbp, pnma1, tlr5, itga6, micb, pbk and
tnfrsf18, powerful efficiency distinguishing satisfactory poor
survival stad patients. moreover, top 3 ranked prognostic genes, nrp1,
tgfÎ²2 mfge8, also significantly associated patient's os an
independent validation achieved kaplan-meier plotter database.
conclusions: profiled prognostic immune signature established prognostic
predictive model gc, could reflect immune disorders within tumor
microenvironment, also may provide novel predictive therapeutic targets
for gc patients near future.
