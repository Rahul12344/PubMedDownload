the pivotal role spleen cd4(+) cells development malaria
pathogenesis protective immunity makes necessary profound comprehension 
the mechanisms involved activation regulation plasmodium
infection. herein, examined detail behaviour non-conventional and
conventional splenic cd4(+) cells p. chabaudi malaria. took advantage
of fact great proportion cd4(+) cells generated cd1d(-/-) mice
are i-a(b)-restricted (conventional cells), counterparts i-a(b-/-)
mice restricted cd1d class ib major histocompatibility complex
(mhc) molecules (non-conventional cells). found conventional cd4(+) t
cells main protagonists immune response infection, which
develops two consecutive phases concomitant acute chronic
parasitaemias. early phase conventional cd4(+) cell response is
intense short lasting, rapidly providing large amounts proinflammatory
cytokines helping follicular marginal zone b cells secrete polyclonal 
immunoglobulin. tnf-α ifn-γ production depend mostly conventional
cd4(+) cells. ifn-γ produced simultaneously non-conventional and
conventional cd4(+) cells. early phase response finishes a
week infection, elimination large proportion cd4(+) cells, 
which gives opportunity development acquired immunity.
unexpectedly, major contribution cd1d-restricted cd4(+) cells occurs 
the beginning second phase response, earlier, helping 
ifn-γ parasite-specific antibody production. concluded conventional
cd4(+) cells central role onset p. chabaudi malaria, acting 
in parallel non-conventional cd4(+) cells link innate and
acquired immunity. study contributes understanding malaria
immunology opens perspective future studies designed decipher the
molecular mechanisms behind immune responses plasmodium infection.
