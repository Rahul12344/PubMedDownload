algorithmic mapping characterization drug-induced phenotypic-response 
space parasites causing schistosomiasis.

neglected tropical diseases, especially caused helminths, constitute
some common infections world's poorest people. amongst these, 
schistosomiasis (bilharzia 'snail fever'), caused blood flukes genus
schistosoma, ranks second malaria terms human impact: two hundred
million people infected close 800 million risk infection.
drug screening helminths poses unique challenges: parasite cannot 
cloned difficult target using gene knockouts rnai. consequently,
both lead identification validation involve phenotypic screening, where
parasites exposed compounds whose effects determined the
analysis ensuing phenotypic responses. efficacy leads thus
identified derives one even unknown molecular mechanisms of
action. two immediate significant challenges confront the
state-of-the-art area are: development automated quantitative

approach, first, bio-image analysis algorithms used quantify the
