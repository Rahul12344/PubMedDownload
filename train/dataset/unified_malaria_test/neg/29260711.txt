population. here, present quantitative tools make inferences about
epistatic gene interactions fitness landscape incompletely
determined due imprecise measurements missing observations. demonstrate 
that genetic interactions often inferred fitness rank orders, where
all genotypes ordered according fitness, even partial fitness
orders. provide complete characterization rank orders imply higher
order epistasis. theory applies common types gene interactions

analyzed various genetic systems comprising hiv-1, malaria-causing parasite
plasmodium vivax, fungus aspergillus niger, tem-family Î²-lactamase
associated antibiotic resistance. systems, approach revealed
higher order interactions among mutations.
