artemisinin-based combination therapies (acts) first-line treatments for
uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria. act resistance spreading asia 
but yet africa. reduced effects act partner drugs reported
but little information regarding widely used artesunate/amodiaquine (asaq). 
we studied efficacy zanzibar 14 years first-line treatment
directly vivo, single-armed trial indirectly prevalences of
different genotypes p. falciparum chloroquine-resistance transporter,
multidrug-resistance 1, kelch 13 propeller domain genes. vivo efficacy was
higher 2017 (100%; 95% ci 97.4%-100%) 2002-2005 (94.7%; 95% ci
91.9%-96.7%) (p = 0.003). molecular findings showed artemisinin
resistance-associated genotypes major increases genotypes associated 
high sensitivity/efficacy amodiaquine asaq introduced. thus, 
the efficacy asaq maintained appears increased long-term
use contrast observed acts used africa.
