background: previous study, novel liver-targeting fusion interferon
(ifn-csp) combining ifn α2b plasmodium region peptide successfully
constructed. ifn-csp significant inhibition effects hbv-dna replication in
hepg2.2.15 cells. aim present investigation focused to
produce high levels recombinant ifn-csp vivo anti-hepatitis b virus
(hbv) activity.
methods: modified dna fragment encoding ifn-csp synthesized according to
escherichia coli (e. coli) preferred codon usage transformed e. coli
bl21 (de3) protein expression. induction conditions systematically
examined combining one-factor experiments orthogonal test
(l(9)(3)(4)). antigenicity purified protein characterized by
western blot analysis. vivo tissue distribution assayed compared 
with native ifn α2b. hbv-transgenic mice used vivo model evaluate
the anti-hbv effect recombinant ifn-csp.
results: results showed e. coli expression system efficient
to produce target protein.
conclusion: current research demonstrates first time ifn-csp
gene expressed high levels e. coli codon expression
conditions optimization. purified recombinant ifn-csp showed liver-targeting 
potentiality anti-hbv activity vivo. present study supported
the application ifn-csp liver-targeting anti-hbv medicines.
