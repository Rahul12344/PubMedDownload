the mechanism chloroquine (cq) resistance plasmodium falciparum not
clearly understood. however, cq resistance shown associated with
point mutations pfcrt pfmdr1. genes encode digestive vacuole
transmembrane proteins pfcrt pgh1, respectively. present study was
carried analyze association pfcrt-k76t pfmdr1-n86y mutations
with cq resistance northeast indian p. falciparum isolates. 115 p. falciparum 
isolates subjected vitro cq sensitivity testing pcr-rflp analysis 
for pfmdr1-n86y pfcrt-k76t mutations. 100 isolates p. falciparum 
found resistant cq vitro susceptibility test (geometric mean
ec50 2.21 µm/l blood) 15 found cq sensitive (geometric mean ec50
0.32 µm/l blood). cq resistant isolates showed presence pfmdr1 and
pfcrt mutations. cq sensitive isolates negative mutations. strong 
linkage disequilibrium observed alleles two loci
(pfmdr1-n86y pfcrt-k76t). results indicate pfmdr1-n86y and
pfcrt-k76t mutations used molecular markers identify cq resistance
in p. falciparum. result necessitates evaluation cq vivo
therapeutic efficacy endemic areas effective malaria control
strategies.
