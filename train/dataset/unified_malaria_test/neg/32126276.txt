ammonia one principal kairomones originating human other
animal emanations context, plays essential role the
host-seeking behaviors malaria vector mosquito anopheles gambiae.
nevertheless, despite importance directing host-seeking, mechanisms
underlying ammonia detection mosquito olfactory system remains largely
unknown. addition ongoing efforts identify characterize the
molecular receptors underlie ammonia sensitivity, previous studies have
revealed prominent role ammonium transporters (amt) modulating antennal 
and behavioral responses drosophila melanogaster an. gambiae. the
former, localization dmamt antennal sensilla auxiliary cells surrounding
the ammonia sensory neurons led hypothesis role clear

heterologous expression used examine expression functional

advanced transgenic tools comprehensively examine agamt spatial localization
across peripheral chemosensory appendages larvae adult female an.
gambiae. larval antennae, agamt appears localized neuronal and
auxiliary cells. contrast d. melanogaster, adult antennae,
agamt-derived signals observed non-neuronal auxiliary cells in
sensory neurons ammonia-responsive basiconic coeloconic sensilla. the
maxillary palps, labella, tarsi, agamt appears restricted sensory neurons.
we also characterized responses ammonia adult antennal coeloconic 
sensilla maxillary palp capitate pegs revealing correlation between
sensillar agamt expression ammonia sensitivity. taken together, data
suggest agamt may play heterogeneous roles adult larval
chemosensory apparatus potentially broad utility supra-receptor target
in mosquito control.
