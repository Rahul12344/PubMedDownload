we designed pre-erythrocytic vaccine candidate based plasmodium
vivax circumsporozoite (csv) protein, includes n- c-terminal parts 
and truncated region containing repeat sequences vk210 the
vk247 p. vivax subtypes. two versions vaccine candidate made: a
soluble recombinant protein expressed escherichia coli, designated vmp001 
a particulate antigen expressed saccharomyces cerevisiae, designated csv-s,s. 
the latter composed csv-s, fusion protein vmp001 hepatitis b 
surface antigen (hbsag), free hbsag co-expressed yeast self-assembling
into mixed particles. antigen versions, adjuvanted as01, shown 
be immunogenic rhesus monkeys. csv-s,s/as01 induced higher levels of
vmp001-specific antibodies vmp001/as01. antibody responses the
n- c-terminal regions csv vk210 repeat motif similar
magnitude following immunization either soluble particulate
antigen. however, antibodies agdr region, potentially protective b 
cell epitope, detected immunization csv-s,s. analysis the
induced cd4(+) cells highlighted different cytokine profiles depending the
antigen form. results warrant clinical evaluation two
vaccine candidates assess added value particulate versus soluble form
of csv, terms immunogenicity protective efficacy.
