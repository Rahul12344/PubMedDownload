phagocytosis invading microorganisms professional phagocytic cells a
central role innate immunity. however, several microorganisms developed
strategies subvert process. previously, reported bacteria and
protozoa modulate differently expression rab gtpases. moreover, our
results suggested modulation contribute avoid phagocytosis.
here, investigated mechanism malaria parasite plasmodium
berghei bacterium escherichia coli subvert phagocytosis the
modulation rab14 rab9a expression, respectively. first confirmed that
the scavenger receptor cd36 toll-like receptor (tlr) 4 required for
the phagocytosis p. berghei e. coli, respectively. interestingly, we
observed rab14 silencing leads increase surface expression of
cd36 macrophages, explain increase phagocytosis p.
berghei reported previously. similar results obtained rab9a tlr4,
i.e. rab9a silencing causes upregulation tlr4 surface expression in
macrophages. furthermore, found decrease internalization of
cd36 tlr4, upon rab14 rab9a silencing, respectively, explain the
increase surface levels receptors. thus, studies provide
evidence modulation phagocytosis caused changes rab expression 
is operated, least partly changes surface levels phagocytic 
receptors.
