background: anopheles mosquitoes efficient vectors human malaria, it
is unknown transmit viruses well aedes culex
mosquitoes. arbovirus known consistently transmitted anopheles 
mosquitoes o'nyong nyong virus (onnv, genus alphavirus, family togaviridae).
the interaction anopheles mosquitoes rna viruses relatively
unexamined.
results: transcriptionally profiled african malaria vector, anopheles
coluzzii, infected onnv. mosquitoes fed infectious bloodmeal 
were analyzed illumina rnaseq 3 days post-bloodmeal primary
virus infection midgut epithelium, systemic dissemination. virus
infection triggers transcriptional regulation 30 host candidate genes.
most regulated candidate genes novel, without known function. the
known genes, significant cluster includes candidates predicted involvement
in carbohydrate metabolism. two candidate genes encoding leucine-rich repeat
immune (lrim) factors point possible involvement immune protein complexes
in mosquito antiviral response. primary onnv infection bloodmeal
shares little transcriptional response common onnv infection by
intrathoracic injection, midgut infection malaria parasites,
plasmodium falciparum p. berghei. profiling a. coluzzii microrna (mirna)
identified 118 known mirnas 182 potential novel mirna candidates, just
one mirna regulated onnv infection. mirna regulated other
previously reported treatments, may virus specific. coexpression analysis 
of mirna abundance messenger rna expression revealed discrete clusters of
genes regulated imd jak/stat, immune signaling pathways are
protective onnv primary infection.
conclusions: onnv infection a. coluzzii midgut triggers remarkably
limited gene regulation program mostly novel candidate genes, likely
includes host genes deployed antiviral defense, well genes manipulated 
by virus facilitate infection. functional dissection onnv-response 
candidate genes expected generate novel insight mechanisms of
virus-vector interaction.
