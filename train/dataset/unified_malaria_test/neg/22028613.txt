a protein complex high-molecular-mass proteins (pfrhoph) human malaria 
parasite plasmodium falciparum induces host protective immunity therefore 
a candidate vaccine development. clarification level polymorphism
and evolutionary processes important vaccine design a
better understanding evolution cell invasion parasite. a
previous study 5 genes encoding rhoph1/clag proteins, positive diversifying
selection detected clag8 clag9 paralogous clag2,
clag3.1 clag3.2. study, extend analysis clag polymorphism, 
we obtained sequences surrounding polymorphic regions clag2, clag8,
and clag9 parasites collected thailand. using sequence data obtained
newly study reported previously, classified clag2 sequences 5
groups based similarity deduced amino acid sequences number 
insertions/deletions. sliding window method, excess nonsynonymous
substitutions synonymous substitutions detected group 1 group
2 clag2 clag8 sequences. population-based analyses also detected a
significant departure neutral expectation group 1 clag2 clag8.
thus, two independent approaches suggest clag2 subject positive
diversifying selection. previously suggested positive selection clag8 
also supported population-based analyses. however, positive selection on
clag9, detected comparing 5 sequences, detected using
the additional 34 sequences obtained study.
