background: plasmodium vivax merozoites specifically invade reticulocytes. 
recently, two reticulocyte-binding proteins (pvrbp1 pvrbp2) expressed 
apical pole p. vivax merozoite considered involved in
reticulocyte recognition. genome sequence recently obtained salvador 
i (sal-i) strain p. vivax revealed additional genes family, in
particular pvrbp2a, pvrbp2b (pvrbp2 renamed pvrbp2c) two
pseudogenes pvrbp2d pvrbp3. previously found pvrbp2c is
substantially polymorphic pvrbp1. primary goal study to
ascertain level polymorphism new genes.
methodology/principal findings: sequence pvrbp2a, pvrbp2b, pvrbp2d and
pvrbp3 genes obtained amplification/cloning using dna purified four 
isolates collected patients acquired infection four cardinal
regions thailand (west, north, south east). additional seven isolates
from western thailand analyzed gene copy number variation. were
significant polymorphisms exhibited genes (compared reference
sal-i strain) ratio mutations leading non-synonymous or
synonymous amino acid change close 3∶1 pvrbp2a pvrbp2b. although the
degree polymorphism exhibited two genes higher of
pvrbp1, reach exceptional diversity noted pvrbp2c. was
interesting note variations copy number pvrbp2a pvrbp2b
occurred isolates.
conclusions/significance: evolution different members pvrbp2 family
and relatively high degree polymorphism suggests proteins
encoded genes important parasite survival immune
selection. data also shows highly conserved regions rbp2a
and rbp2b, might provide suitable targets future vaccine development
against blood stage p. vivax.
