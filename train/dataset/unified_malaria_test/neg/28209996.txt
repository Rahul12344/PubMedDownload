the hallmark vaccines ability prevent spread infectious
pathogens thereby serve invaluable public health tool. despite their
medical relevance, gap understanding physiological
factors mediate innate adaptive immune response vaccines. the
endocannabinoid (ecb) system critical modulator homeostasis in
vertebrates. results indicate macrophages dendritic cells produce
the endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (2-ag) upon antigen activation.
we also established 2-ag levels upregulated serum the
lymph node mice vaccination. hypothesized intrinsic release
of ecbs immune cells activation pathogenic antigens mitigate
inflammation, also suppress overall innate adaptive immune response. here
we demonstrate, first time, transient administration the
cannabinoid receptor 2 antagonist am630 (10 mg/kg) inverse agonist jte907
(3 mg/kg) immunization heightens intensity breadth of
antigen-specific immune responses young aged mice upregulation
of immunomodulatory genes secondary lymphoid tissues.
