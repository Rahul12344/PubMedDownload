mutations kelch domain k13 gene (pf3d7_1343700) previously
associated artemisinin resistance plasmodium falciparum. study
followed dynamics k13 polymorphisms p. falciparum parasites from
the china-myanmar border area obtained 2007-2016, vitro
sensitivities artesunate (as) dihydroartemisinin (dha). 50% effective 
concentration (ec5072h) values 133 culture-adapted field isolates and
dha, measured conventional 72 h sybr green i-based assay, varied
significantly among parasites different years; significantly
higher reference strain 3d7. compared parasites 2007
to 2008, ring survival rates almost doubled parasites obtained later years.
sequencing full-length k13 genes identified 11 point mutations present 85 
(63.9%) parasite isolates. f446i predominant (55/133) variant, its
frequency increased 17.6% (3/17) 2007 55.9% (19/34) 2014-2016. 
no wild-type (wt) kelch domain sequences found 34 samples obtained
from 2014 2016. 2014-2016 samples, new mutation (g533s) appeared 
reached 44.1% (15/34). collectively, parasites kelch domain mutations
(after amino acid 440) significantly higher ring survival rates wt
parasites. individually, f446i, g533s a676d showed significantly higher ring 
survival rates wt. although drug sensitivity phenotypes measured 
the rsa6h ec5072h assays may intrinsically linked vivo clinical 
efficacy data, values determined two assays significantly
correlated. study identified trend k13 mutations parasite
populations china-myanmar border area, confirmed overall correlation 
of kelch domain mutations elevated ring-stage survival rates, emphasized
the importance monitoring evolution spread parasites reduced
artemisinin sensitivity along malaria elimination course.
