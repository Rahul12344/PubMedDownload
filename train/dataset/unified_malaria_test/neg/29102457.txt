malaria infection poses great threaten public health even nowadays. the
conventional diagnosis tools malaria parasites vectors require systematic 
training observers accompanied low throughput. study, a
new detection system, i.e., multiplex microfluidic loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (mμlamp) array, developed provide convenient, rapid and
economical detection system malaria diagnosis. microfluidic-based detection
chip designed developed, targeting conserved gene four anopheles
and two plasmodium species responsible malaria cases occurred 
china. dna preparation anopheles plasmodium samples realized by
using newly-developed dna extraction method. mμlamp array system, 
detection limit determined 1pg targeting dna high sensitivity
(>95%) specificity (100%). further, accuracy mμlamp analysis 
evaluated analysis 48 anopheles mosquito samples, 30 were
termed target anopheles, displaying high consistency by
morphological analysis. conclusion, mμlamp detection system proved 
be visible, sensitive, specific high-throughput diagnostic tool.
considering portable manipulation detection system, studies shed 
light potential application malaria surveillance spot.
