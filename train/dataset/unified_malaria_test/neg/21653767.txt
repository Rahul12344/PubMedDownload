a highly sensitive genus-specific quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time
pcr (qrt-pcr) assay detection plasmodium developed. assay
amplifies total nucleic acids (rna dna) 18s rrna genes limit of
detection 0.002 parasite/μl using cultured synchronized ring stage 3d7
parasites. parasite densities low 0.000362 parasite/μl detected when
analyzing clinical samples. analysis clinical samples showed detection of
18s rrna genes total nucleic acids increased analytical sensitivity of
the assay 1 log unit compared dna only. clinical samples
with parasites present microscopy analyzed qrt-pcr, 90% (117 of
130) positive presence plasmodium nucleic acids. quantification
of clinical samples qrt-pcr using total nucleic acid versus dna compared
to microscopy. significantly greater correlation parasite density 
to microscopy dna alone used total nucleic acid. conclude
that analysis total nucleic acids qrt-pcr suitable assay detection
of low parasite levels patients early-stage malaria and/or submicroscopic
infections could greatly benefit malaria diagnosis, intervention trials, 
malaria control elimination efforts.
