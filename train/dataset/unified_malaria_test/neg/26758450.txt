insecticide resistance one important evolutionary phenomena for
researchers. overuse chemicals induced resistance insect pests that
ultimately led collapse disease control programs many countries.
the erroneous inappropriate management insect vectors resulted in
dissemination many vector-borne diseases like dengue, malaria, diarrhea,
leishmaniasis, many others. cases, emergence new diseases 
the revival old ones related ecological changes favored 
rapid growth vector densities. understanding molecular mechanisms resistant
strains assist development management programs control the
development spread resistant insect populations. dominant, recessive, 
and co-dominant forms genes encoding resistance investigated, and
furthermore, resistance development addressed either release of
susceptible strains timely insecticide rotation. present review discusses 
the resistance level important insect vectors human diseases; the
molecular basis evolvement resistance also discussed.
