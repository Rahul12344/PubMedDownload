background: study within-host selection resistant parasites, important
factor development resistance anti-malarial drugs, mouse model 
repeated interrupted malaria treatment (rit) developed. the
characteristics within host selection resistance atovaquone and
pyrimethamine plasmodium yoelii examined model.
methods: treatment p. yoelii infected mice, atovaquone pyrimethamine, 
was started parasitaemia level 3-5%, interrupted reduced less 
0.4%, restarted following parasitaemia recovery initial level.
treatment cycles repeated stable phenotype resistance observed.
results: plasmodium yoelii rapidly developed resistance atovaquone
(2.75 ± 1.06 cycles) pyrimethamine (5.4 ± 0.89 cycles) rit. dose
dependent phenomenon selection atovaquone resistance mutations was
observed. mutations underlie resistance therapeutic doses of
0.3-1.44 mg kg-1 bw found qo2 domain cytochrome b gene
(i258m, f267i/l/s, l271v, k272r, l271v k272r). associated lower
doses 0.01-0.03 mg kg-1 bw qo1 domain (m133i t139s). the
resistance mutations occurred four 16 atovaquone putative drug binding 
sites suggested p. falciparum.
conclusions: rit p. yoelii infected mice led rapid development of
resistance atovaquone pyrimethamine. dose dependent selection of
resistance mutants atovaquone observed rit might reflect outcome of
two different causes malaria treatment failure human, repeated incomplete
treatment therapeutic dose repeated inadequate treatment associated with
sub-therapeutic dose, need systematically investigated.
