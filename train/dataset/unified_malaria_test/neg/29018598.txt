background: current first line drugs treating uncomplicated malaria are
artemisinin (art) combination therapies. however, plasmodium falciparum parasites
resistant art partner drugs spreading, threatens malaria control
efforts. rodent malaria species useful models understanding antimalarial 
resistance, particular genetic variants responsible cross resistance to
different compounds.
methods: plasmodium berghei rc strain (pbrc) described resistant to
different antimalarials, including chloroquine (cq) art. attempt to
identify genetic basis antimalarial resistance trait pbrc, its
genome sequenced compared five previously sequenced p. berghei
strains.
results: found pbrc eight-fold less sensitive art derivative
artesunate reference strain pbanka. genome pbrc markedly
different strains, 6,974 single nucleotide variants private to
pbrc identified. among pbrc private variants, non-synonymous changes
were identified genes known modulate antimalarial sensitivity rodent
malaria species, including notably ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 1
gene. however, variants found genes strong evidence of
association art resistance p. falciparum k13 propeller protein.
discussion: variants identified pbrc provide insight p. berghei
genome diversity genetic factors could modulate cq art resistance in
plasmodium spp.
