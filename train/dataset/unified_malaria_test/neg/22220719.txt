the relevance innate immune responses plasmodium falciparum infection, in
particular central role natural killer (nk) cell-derived interferon gamma 
(ifn-γ), becoming increasingly recognised. recently, shown that
ifn-γ production response p. falciparum antigens part regulated by
killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (kir) genes, study from
malaria-exposed melanesians suggested association kir genotypes and
susceptibility infection. prompted us determine compare the
frequencies 15 kir genes gambian children presenting either severe
malaria (n = 133) uncomplicated malaria (n = 188) cord-blood population
control samples (n = 314) collected area. significant
differences observed severe uncomplicated cases, proportions 
individuals kir2ds2+c1 kir2dl2+c1 significantly higher among
malaria cases overall population control samples. exploratory
analysis, activating kir genes kir2ds2, kir3ds1 kir2ds5 slightly higher 
in children disease subgroups associated highest mortality. in
addition, data suggest homozygosity kir genotype might be
associated different malaria outcomes including protection infection
and higher blood parasitaemia levels get infected. these
findings consistent probable role kir genes determining
susceptibility malaria, studies warranted different
populations.
