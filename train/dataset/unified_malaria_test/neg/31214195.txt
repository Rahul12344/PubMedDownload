the malaria genome encodes 5,000 proteins many also been
proposed potential vaccine candidates, although been
tested clinically. rh5 one leading blood-stage plasmodium falciparum
malaria vaccine antigens phase i/ii clinical trials vaccines containing
this antigen currently underway. likely mechanism action elicit 
antibodies neutralize merozoites blocking invasion red blood

s-antigen cyrpa robustly elicited antibodies neutralizing properties.
anti-cyrpa igg generally showed additive gia anti-rh5 igg, although high
levels anti-cyrpa-specific rabbit polyclonal igg required achieve 50% 
gia. data suggest vaccine antigen screening efforts required
to identify second merozoite target similar antibody-susceptibility to
rh5.
