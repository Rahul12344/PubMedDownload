the number cancer patients increasing diarrhea common
clinical symptom treatment cancers. understand prevalences and
genotypes/subtypes e. bieneusi blastocystis cancer patients china,
to track infection sources, explore relationships e.
bieneusi blastocystis infections diarrhea, 381 fecal specimens were
collected cancer patients. analyzed presence e. 
bieneusi blastocystis pcr amplifying sequencing region 
rrna gene barcode region ssu rrna gene, respectively. 1.3 7.1%
of cancer patients positive e. bieneusi blastocystis, respectively. 
no statistical differences observed infection rates the

relationship blastocystis diarrhea found chemotherapy group. two e. 
bieneusi genotypes (d novel one named hlj-cp1) two blastocystis
subtypes (st1 st3) identified three novel st1 sequences. is
the first report occurrence molecular characterizations e. bieneusi and
blastocystis cancer patients china. e. bieneusi genotype blastocystis
st1 st3 identified humans animals one novel e.
bieneusi genotype falling zoonotic group 1, implying potential zoonotic
transmission.
