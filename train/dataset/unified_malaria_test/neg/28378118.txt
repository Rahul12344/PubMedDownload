micrornas (mirnas) major regulators cell responses, particularly in
stressed cell states host immune responses. mirnas role in
pathogen defense, including regulation immune responses plasmodium parasite
infection. using nonlethal mouse model blood stage malaria infection, we
have found mir-451-/- mice infected plasmodium yoelii xnl cleared
infection faster rate wild-type (wt) mice. mir-451-/- mice an
increased leukocyte response infection, protective phenotype
primarily driven cd4+ cells. wt mir-451-/- cd4+ cells similar
activation responses, mir-451-/- cd4+ cells significantly increased
proliferation, vitro vivo. myc mir-451 target central 
role cell cycle progression cell proliferation. cd4+ cells from
mir-451-/- mice increased postactivation myc expression. rna-seq analysis 
cd4+ cells demonstrated 5000 differentially expressed genes mir-451-/-
mice postinfection, many directly indirectly myc regulated. 
study demonstrates mir-451 regulates cell proliferative responses part 
via myc-dependent mechanism.
