background: rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) currently used malaria
diagnosis cannot distinguish various plasmodium infections. development
of plasmodium vivax specific rdts high sensitivity sufficiently
differentiate two common plasmodium infections would crucial for
disease treatment control.
method: plasmodium vivax aldolase gene (pvaldo) amplified extracted 
genomic dna constructed pet30a vector. plasmodium vivax aldolase protein
was successfully expressed escherichia coli soluble form overall
purity 95% one-step affinity chromatography purification. the
purified products used immunization mice rabbits. rabbit
polyclonal antibodies generated deployed develop novel antibody-capture
elisa hybridoma screening.
results: three pvaldo specific mabs (14c7, 15f1 5h7) high affinities
were selected used immunochromatographic test strips. clinical blood
samples (n=190) collected yunnan (china) used evaluation the
rdt's sensitivity p. vivax 98.33% (95% confidence interval (ci): 91.03%
to 99.72%) compared microscopic examination. specificity 99.23%
(95% ci: 95.77% 99.87%) p. vivax. one plasmodium falciparum sample
was detected among p. falciparum samples (n=20). plasmodium malariae
samples (n=2) well healthy uninfected samples (n=108) negative.
overall performance rdt excellent positive predictive value
(ppv) negative predictive value (npv) 98.33% 99.23%, respectively, 
95% ci good correlation microscopic observations (kappa value,
k=0.9757). test strips show high sensitivity even 6.25 ng/ml recombinant p.
vivax aldolase (rpvaldo).
conclusion: study elucidates possibility developing
aldolase-specific rdts differentiate different plasmodium
infections improve accurate diagnosis malaria. rdt could adequately
differentiate p. vivax p. falciparum infections. novel mab
screening method developed could find application screening highly
specific antibodies antigens.
