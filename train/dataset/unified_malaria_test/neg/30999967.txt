background: primaquine, 8-aminoquinoline anti-hypnozoite activity against
plasmodium vivax, metabolized human cytochrome p450 2d6 (cyp2d6) its
active metabolite. human cyp2d6 activities may influence metabolism of
primaquine risk experiencing plasmodium relapses following primaquine 
anti-relapse therapies (part). study, cyp2d6 profile its
relationship outcomes part australian defence force (adf) personnel is
retrospectively investigated.
methods: genomic dna isolated stored de-identified serum blood
samples adf personnel deployed peacekeeping duties papua new guinea
(png) (1999) east timor (1999-2000) received part returning to
australia experiencing relapses. cyp2d6 allelic type determined 
pcr sanger sequencing. cyp2d6 allele frequency, predicted phenotypes and
activity scores compared among personnel experience p. vivax
(adf-nr, n = 48) experience least one (adf-r, n = 109) relapse, 
as well experienced 1 (n = 79), 2 (n = 21) 3-5 (n = 9)
relapses within adf-r group.
results: 16 cyp2d6 alleles observed 157 adf personnel. alleles *1, *4, *2
and *41 major alleles (> 5%). cyp2d6 allele frequency profile the
adf-nr group matched european population. increased
proportion non-functional cyp2d6 alleles adf-r group compared the
european population adf-nr group. however, frequencies predicted cyp2d6
phenotype activity score different adf-r adf-nr
groups, among sub-groups experiencing multiple relapses within adf-r
group.
conclusions: cyp2d6 phenotype activity score based allele
classification major contributor p. vivax relapse adf
cohort. factors adherence and/or parasite tolerance primaquine
are likely contributing factors p. vivax relapses cohort.
