background: recent years, well documented gut flora 
influence mosquito physiology, also significantly alter vector competency.
although, salivary gland gut constitute key partners digestive system,
it still believed salivary glands may harbor less flora gut (parasit
vectors 6: 146, 2013).
methods: using metagenomic approach, identified first time 
diverse microbial community associated two physiologically different
tissues digestive system mosquito anopheles culicifacies.
results: total 17 different phyla could assigned whole metagenomic
dataset, predominated phylum proteobacteria, firmicutes, bacteriodetes,
tenericutes actinomycetes. common bacteria included members of
enhydrobacter, agromonas, serratia, ralsonia, lactobacillus, pseudomonas,
streptococcus, rubrobacter, anaerococcus, methylobacterium, turicibacter,
elizabethkingia etc. tissues representing 'core microbiota' the
mosquito digestive system. salivary associated unique bacterial community
included members chloriflexi, chlorobi, cyanobacteria, nitrospira, tm7,
armatimonadetes, planctomycetes, fibrobacteres etc.
conclusion: find salivary gland microbial community structure more
diverse gut mosquito, probably due differential feeding associated
engagements food acquisition, ingestion digestion processes.
