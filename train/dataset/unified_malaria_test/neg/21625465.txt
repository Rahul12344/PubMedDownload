invasion erythrocyte merozoites malaria parasite a
complex process involving range receptor-ligand interactions. two protein
families termed erythrocyte binding like (ebl) proteins reticulocyte binding 
protein homologues (rh) play important role host cell recognition the
merozoite. rodent malaria parasite, plasmodium yoelii, 235 kda rhoptry
proteins (py235) coded multigene family members rh.
in p. yoelii py235 well single member ebl shown key
mediators virulence enabling parasite invade wider range host
erythrocytes. one member py235, py01365 abundantly transcribed in
parasite populations protein specifically binds erythrocytes is
recognized protective monoclonal antibody 25.77, suggesting key role 
this particular member virulence. recent studies indicated overall
levels py235 expression essential parasite virulence. show
that disruption py01365 virulent ym line directly impacts parasite
virulence. furthermore disruption py01365 leads reduction the
number schizonts express members py235 react specifically with
the mcab 25.77. erythrocyte binding assays show reduced binding py235 red
blood cells py01365 knockout parasite compared ym. results
identify py01365 mediator parasite virulence, also confirm that
other members py235 able substitute py01365.
