hepatocystis genus single-celled parasites infecting, amongst other
hosts, monkeys, bats squirrels. although thought descended from
malaria parasites (plasmodium spp.), hepatocystis spp. thought undergo
replication blood-the part plasmodium life cycle causes the
symptoms malaria. furthermore, hepatocystis transmitted biting midges,
not mosquitoes. comparative genomics hepatocystis plasmodium species
therefore presents opportunity better understand important
aspects malaria parasite biology. able generate draft genome 
hepatocystis sp. using dna sequencing reads blood naturally
infected red colobus monkey. provide robust phylogenetic support for
hepatocystis sp. sister group plasmodium parasites infecting rodents. 
show transcriptomic support lack replication blood genomic
support complete loss family genes involved red blood cell
invasion. analyses highlight rapid evolution genes involved in
parasite vector stages, revealing genes may critical interactions
between malaria parasites mosquitoes.
