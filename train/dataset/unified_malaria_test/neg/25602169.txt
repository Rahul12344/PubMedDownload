equilibrative transporters potential drug targets; however, functional
assays involve radioactive substrate uptake unsuitable for
high-throughput screens (hts). developed robust yeast-based growth assay
that potentially applicable many equilibrative transporters. proof of
principle, applied approach equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 of
the malarial parasite plasmodium falciparum (pfent1). pfent1 inhibitors might
serve novel antimalarial drugs since pfent1-mediated purine import is
essential parasite proliferation. identify pfent1 inhibitors, screened 
64 560 compounds identified 171 ability rescue growth of
pfent1-expressing fui1δ yeast presence cytotoxic pfent1 substrate,
5-fluorouridine (5-furd). secondary assays, nine highest activity
compounds inhibited pfent1-dependent growth purine auxotrophic yeast strain 
with adenosine sole purine source (ic50 0.2-2 μm). nine compounds
completely blocked [(3)h]adenosine uptake pfent1-expressing yeast and
erythrocyte-free trophozoite-stage parasites (ic50 5-50 nm), inhibited
chloroquine-sensitive -resistant parasite proliferation (ic50 5-50 μm).
wild-type (wt) parasite ic50 values 4-fold lower compared to
pfent1-knockout (pfent1δ) parasites. pfent1δ parasite killing showed a
delayed-death phenotype observed wt. infer that, parasites, the
compounds inhibit pfent1 secondary target similar efficacy. the
secondary target identity unknown, existence may reduce likelihood
of parasites developing resistance pfent1 inhibitors. data support the
hypothesis blocking purine transport pfent1 may novel and
compelling approach antimalarial drug development.
