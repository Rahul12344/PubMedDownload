plasmodium sporozoites infect liver develop exoerythrocytic
merozoites initiate blood-stage disease. hepatocyte molecular pathways
that permit abrogate parasite replication merozoite formation not
been thoroughly explored, deeper understanding may identify therapeutic
strategies mitigate malaria. cellular inhibitor apoptosis (ciap) proteins
regulate cell survival co-opted intracellular pathogens support
development. here, show ciap1 levels upregulated plasmodium
liver infection genetic pharmacological targeting ciaps using
clinical-stage antagonists preferentially kills infected hepatocytes promotes
immunity. using gene-targeted mice, mechanism defined as
tnf-tnfr1-mediated apoptosis via caspases 3 8 clear parasites. study 
reveals importance ciaps plasmodium infection demonstrates that
host-directed antimalarial drugs eliminate liver parasites induce
immunity likely providing high barrier resistance parasite.
