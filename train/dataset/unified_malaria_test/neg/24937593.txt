clonally variant protein expression malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum
generates phenotypic variability allows isogenic populations adapt to
environmental changes encountered blood stage infection. underlying
regulatory mechanisms best studied major virulence factor p.
falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1). pfemp1 encoded the
multicopy var gene family single variant expressed individual
parasites, concept known mutual exclusion singular gene choice. var gene 
activation occurs situ achieved escape one locus from
epigenetic silencing. singular gene choice controlled level of
transcription initiation var 5' upstream (ups) sequences harbour regulatory
information essential mutually exclusive transcription well the
trans-generational inheritance var activity profile. additional level
of control recently identified var2csa gene, mrna
element 5' untranslated region (5' utr) involved reversible
inhibition translation var2csa transcripts. here, extend knowledge
on post-transcriptional var gene regulation common upsc type. we
identified 5' utr sequence inhibits translation upsc-derived mrnas.
importantly, 5' utr element efficiently inhibits translation even the
context heterologous upstream region. further, found var 5' utrs be
significantly enriched uaugs known impair efficiency of
protein translation eukaryotes. findings suggest regulation
