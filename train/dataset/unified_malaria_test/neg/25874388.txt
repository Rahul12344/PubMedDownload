little known stage-specific gene regulation plasmodium parasites, 
particular liver stage development. previously described the
plasmodium berghei rodent model, liver stage-specific (lisp2) gene promoter
region, vitro. using dual luminescence system, confirm stage
specificity promoter region also vivo. furthermore, substitution
and deletion analyses extended vitro characterization important
elements within promoter region. importantly, dual luminescence system
allows analyzing promoter constructs avoiding mouse-consuming cloning procedures 
of transgenic parasites. makes extensive mutation deletion studies a
reasonable approach also malaria mouse model. stage-specific expression
constructs parasite lines extremely valuable tools research on
plasmodium liver stage biology. reporter lines offer promising opportunity
for assessment liver stage drugs, characterization genetically attenuated
parasites liver stage-specific vaccines vivo vitro, may be
key generation inducible systems.
