selective autophagy related mechanisms act variable defense mechanisms
against pathogens therefore considered intracellular immune
responses. hepatocytes, plasmodium parasites reside parasitophorous 
vacuole (pv) pv membrane (pvm) main contact site host cell
and parasite. early infection, pvm directly labeled host cell
autophagy proteins lc3b p62 (nucleoporin 62). investigated recruitment
of different selective autophagy receptors could show mainly p62 and
nbr1 (neighbour brca1 gene 1) lesser extent ndp52 (nuclear dot
protein 52) associate pvm. investigate recruitment these
receptors pvm plasmodium-infected cells, generated lc3b knock out
hela cells. cell lines, autophagosome formation autophagic flux 
not different wt cells. unexpectedly, p62 nbr1 recruitment the
pvm strongly impaired lc3b-negative host cells, suggesting lc3b
recruits receptors pvm plasmodium parasites. also noticed 
lc3b recruited ubiquitin pvm. indicates that, comparison to
classical selective autophagy, p. berghei-infected cells order membrane
labeling autophagy proteins appears inverted canonical
ubiquitin-receptor-lc3b recruitment lc3b-receptor possibly ubiquitin.
