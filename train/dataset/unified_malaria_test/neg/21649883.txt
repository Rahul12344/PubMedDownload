background: mosquito, anopheles gambiae, primary vector human
malaria, disease responsible millions deaths year. improve
strategies controlling transmission causative parasite, plasmodium
falciparum, require thorough understanding developmental mechanisms, 
physiological processes evolutionary pressures affecting life-history traits 
in mosquito. identifying genes expressed particular tissues involved in
specific biological processes essential part process.
results: study, present transcription profiles ~82% annotated
anopheles genes dissected adult male female tissues. sensitivity
afforded examining dissected tissues found gene activity additional 20% 
of genome undetected using whole-animal samples. somatic and
reproductive tissues examined displayed patterns sexually dimorphic
and tissue-specific expression. comparing expression profiles drosophila 
melanogaster also assessed genes well conserved within diptera
versus recently evolved.
conclusions: expression atlas associated publicly available database, the
mozatlas (http://www.tissue-atlas.org), provides information relative
strength specificity gene expression several somatic reproductive
tissues, isolated single strain grown uniform conditions. data
will serve reference mosquito researchers providing simple
method identifying genes expressed adult, however, in
addition resource also provide insights evolutionary diversity 
associated gene expression levels among species.
