background: anopheles hyrcanus group includes 25 species, widely
distributed oriental palaearctic regions. several species within 
group vectors malaria, lymphatic filariasis japanese encephalitis. 
is difficult impossible identify cryptic species based their
morphological characteristics, closely related species hyrcanus 
group similar adult morphological characteristics. thus, molecular
identification important complementary method traditional
morphological taxonomy.
methods: used 461 ribosomal dna (rdna) internal transcribed spacer 2 (its2)
sequences relating 19 species reconstruct molecular phylogeny of
theÂ hyrcanus group across range. addition, compared performance 
rdna its2 mitochondrial dna (mtdna) cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1
gene (cox1) assess genetic divergence hyrcanus group sibling species.
results: based kimura's 2-parameter (k2p) distance model, average
conspecific its2 divergence 0.003, whereas sequence divergence between
species averaged 0.480. average its2 sequence divergences almost 160 times
higher among hyrcanus group members within species. two sets of
sibling species, an. lesteri baisas & hu, 1936 an. paraliae sandosham, 1959; 
and an. sinensis wiedemann, 1828, an. belenrae rueda, 2005, an. kleini rueda,
2005, resolved its2. species represented an
independent lineage phylogenetic tree. results suggest an.
pseudopictus grassi, 1899 an. hyrcanus (pallas, 1771) likely a
single species. uncovered two new its2 lineages require study
before resolving true taxonomic status, designed diagnostic
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay distinguish five morphologically similar
species.
conclusions: nuclear mitochondrial genes generally provided consistent
results subgroup division. compared cox1, its2 reliable tool for
studying phylogenetic relationships among closely related mosquito taxa. based on
species-specific differences its2 sequences, multiplex pcr assay developed
here used improve efficiency vector identification. thus, this
research promote progress malaria vector surveillance both
epidemic non-epidemic areas south east asia.
