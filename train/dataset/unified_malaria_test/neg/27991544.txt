cerebral malaria pathology involving inflammation brain. are
many immune cell types activated process, little
information response microglia, severe complication. we
examined microglia genome wide transcriptomic analysis model of
experimental cerebral malaria (ecm), c57bl/6 mice infected with
plasmodium berghei anka. thousands transcripts differentially expressed
in microglia two different time points infection. proliferation of
microglia dominant feature onset ecm, supporting this, we
observed increase numbers cells brain. cerebral
malaria symptoms manifest, genes involved immune responses chemokine 
production upregulated, possibly driven type interferon.
consistent hypothesis, vitro culture microglial cell line 
interferon-β, infected red blood cells, resulted production several
of chemokines shown upregulated gene expression analysis. it
appears responses associated ecm, microglia mice
infected mutant p. berghei parasite (δdpap3), cause ecm,
did show level activation proliferation.
