background: transmission malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum from
the human mosquito mediated dormant sexual precursor cells, the
gametocytes, become activated mosquito midgut. gametocytes
are parasite stages able establish infection mosquito, they
play crucial role spreading tropical disease. human-to-mosquito
transmission triggers important molecular changes gametocytes, which
initiate gametogenesis prepare parasite life-cycle progression the
insect vector.
results: better understand gene regulations initial phase of
malaria parasite transmission, focused transcriptome changes occur
within first half hour parasite development mosquito. comparison of
mrna levels p. falciparum gametocytes 30 min following activation
using suppression subtractive hybridization (ssh) identified 126 genes, which
changed expression gametogenesis. among these, 17.5% putative
functions signaling, 14.3% assigned cell cycle gene expression,
8.7% linked cytoskeleton inner membrane complex, 7.9% were
involved proteostasis 6.4% metabolism, 12.7% cell
surface-associated proteins, 11.9% assigned functions, 20.6%
represented genes unknown function. 40% identified genes 
as yet protein evidence.for subset 27 genes, transcript changes
during gametogenesis studied detail real-time rt-pcr. these, 22
genes expressed gametocytes, 15 genes transcript expression in
gametocytes increased compared asexual blood stage parasites. transcript
levels seven genes particularly high activated gametocytes, pointing
at functions downstream gametocyte transmission mosquito. selected 
genes, regulated expression gametogenesis confirmed protein
level, using quantitative confocal microscopy.
conclusions: obtained transcriptome data demonstrate regulations gene 
expression immediately following malaria parasite transmission mosquito.
our findings support identification proteins important sexual
reproduction development mosquito midgut stages provide
insights genetic basis rapid adaption plasmodium insect
vector.
