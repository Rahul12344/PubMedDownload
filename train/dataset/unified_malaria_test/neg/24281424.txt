association mapping widely applied method elucidating genetic basis 
of phenotypic traits. however, factors linkage disequilibrium levels 
of genetic diversity influence power resolution approach.
moreover, presence population subdivision among samples result in
spurious associations accounted for. such, useful a
detailed understanding factors conducting association mapping
experiments. conducted whole-genome sequencing 24 specimens the
malaria mosquito vector, anopheles arabiensis, understanding of
patterns genetic diversity, population subdivision linkage disequilibrium 
in species. found high levels genetic diversity within an.
arabiensis genome, ~800,000 high-confidence, single- nucleotide
polymorphisms detected. however, levels nucleotide diversity varied
significantly within chromosomes. observed lower diversity on
the x chromosome, within inversions, near centromeres. population
structure absent local scale (kilombero valley, tanzania) detected
between distant populations (cameroon vs. tanzania) differentiation was
largely restricted certain autosomal chromosomal inversions 2rb.
overall, linkage disequilibrium within an. arabiensis decayed rapidly
(within 200 bp) across chromosomes. however, elevated linkage disequilibrium 
was observed within inversions, suggesting recombination reduced 
those regions. overall low levels linkage disequilibrium suggests that
association studies taxon challenging variants
of large effect, require large sample sizes.
