background: genes encoding dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) dihydropteroate
synthase (dhps) targets sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) present in
artemisinin based combination therapy (act; artesunate + sulfadoxine
pyrimethamine) plasmodium falciparum. although sp generally used to
treat vivax infection, mutations dhfr dhps confer antifolate
resistance plasmodium vivax common; may attributed its
sympatric existence p. falciparum. current study aimed determine 
pattern mutations dhfr dhps p. vivax isolates mangaluru region.
methods: total 140 blood samples collected p. vivax-infected
people attending wenlock hospital mangaluru july 2014 january 2016. out
of 140 isolates, 25 (18%) 50 (36%) isolates selected randomly for
sequence analysis pvdhfr pvdhps genes respectively. fragment pvdhps and
full length pvdhfr amplified, sequenced analysed single nucleotide
polymorphisms. dhps analysed pcr-rflp also, detect two specific
mutations (a383g a553g).
results: analysis pvdhps sequences 50 isolates revealed single double
mutants 38 46% respectively. three non-synonymous mutations (k55r, s58r
and s117n) identified pvdhfr. among these, k55r detected the
first time.
conclusions: current study indicates p. vivax dhps dhfr mutant
alleles prevalent area, suggesting significant sp pressure.
