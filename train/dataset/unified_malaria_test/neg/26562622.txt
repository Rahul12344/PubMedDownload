we recently demonstrated brain endothelial cells cross-present parasite
antigen mouse experimental cerebral malaria (ecm). describe 2-d 
protocol detect cross-presentation isolating brain microvessels and
incubating reporter cell line expresses lacz upon detection of
the relevant peptide-major histocompatibility complex. x-gal staining, a
typical positive result consists hundreds blue spots, compared fewer
than 20 spots naive brain. assay generalizable disease
contexts using reporter cells express appropriate specific cell
receptors. also described protocol culturing endothelial cells from
brain microvessels isolated naive mice. 7-10 d, vitro
cross-presentation assay performed adding interferon-γ, antigen (e.g., 
plasmodium berghei-infected red blood cells) reporter cells sequence 
3 d. useful comparing different antigen forms probing the
effects various interventions.
