objective: emergence geographically expanding antimalarial resistance
worldwide, molecular markers essential tool surveillance resistant
plasmodium parasites. recently, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) the
pf3d7_1343700 kelch propeller (k13-propeller) domain shown associated
with artemisinin (art) resistance vivo vitro. study aims to
investigate art resistance-associated polymorphisms k13-propeller and
pfatpase6 genes plasmodium falciparum isolates bioko island, equatorial
guinea (eg).
methods: total 172 samples collected falciparum malaria patients
on bioko island 2013 2014. polymorphisms k13-propeller and
pfatpase6 genes analyzed nest-pcr sequencing.
results: sequences k13-propeller pfatpase6 obtained 90.74%
(98/108) 91.45% (139/152) samples, respectively. 2.04% (2/98) cases had
non-synonymous k13-propeller a578s mutation found mutations associated
with art resistance southeast asia. pfatpase6, mutations found at
positions n569k a630s mutation prevalence 7.91% (11/139) and
1.44% (2/139), respectively. addition, sample mixed type at
position i723v discovered (0.72%, 1/139).
conclusions: study initially offers insight k13-propeller and
pfatpase6 polymorphisms bioko island, eg. suggests widespread art
resistance tolerance region, might helpful developing and
updating guidance use art-based combination therapies (acts).
