plasmodium sporozoites make remarkable journey mosquito midgut 
mammalian liver. sporozoite's major surface protein, circumsporozoite protein
(csp), multifunctional protein required sporozoite development and
likely mediates several steps journey. study, show csp
has two conformational states, adhesive conformation c-terminal
cell-adhesive domain exposed nonadhesive conformation n
terminus masks domain. demonstrate cell-adhesive domain
functions sporozoite development hepatocyte invasion. two
events, sporozoite must travel mosquito midgut mammalian
liver, n-terminal masking cell-adhesive domain maintains the
sporozoite migratory state. mammalian host, proteolytic cleavage of
csp regulates switch adhesive conformation, highly conserved
region plays critical role process. csp domain architecture is
altered cell-adhesive domain constitutively exposed, the
majority sporozoites reach target organs, mammalian
host, initiate blood stage infection directly inoculation site.
these data provide structure-function information relevant malaria vaccine
development.
