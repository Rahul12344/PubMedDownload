the deadly malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum contains nonphotosynthetic
plastid, known apicoplast, functions produce essential
metabolites, drugs target apicoplast clinically effective.
several prokaryotic caseinolytic protease (clp) genes identified the
plasmodium genome. using phylogenetic analysis, focused clp members
that may form regulated proteolytic complex apicoplast. genetically
targeted members complex generated conditional mutants the
apicoplast-localized pfclpc chaperone pfclpp protease. conditional inhibition
of pfclpc chaperone resulted growth arrest apicoplast loss was
rescued addition essential apicoplast-derived metabolite ipp. using a
double-conditional mutant parasite line, discovered chaperone
activity required stabilize mature protease, revealing functional
interactions. data demonstrate essential function pfclpc in
maintaining apicoplast integrity role regulating proteolytic
activity clp complex.
