danger dying malaria, firmly established number of
clinical field studies different parts africa. addition, experimental 
work consistent plausibile mechanism: namely, heterozygotes 
p falciparum-infected red cells sickle preferentially removed by
macrophages. hand, patients homozygous sickle gene
and therefore suffer sickle cell anaemia (sca) highly susceptible the
