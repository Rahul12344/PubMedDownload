the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum related organisms possess relict
plastid known apicoplast. apicoplast protein synthesis validated drug
target malaria antibiotics inhibit translation prokaryotes
also inhibit apicoplast protein synthesis sometimes used malaria
prophylaxis treatment. identified components indirect aminoacylation 
pathway gln-trna(gln) biosynthesis plasmodium hypothesized would
be essential apicoplast protein synthesis. here, report our
characterization first enzyme pathway, apicoplast
glutamyl-trna synthetase (glurs). expressed recombinant p. falciparum
enzyme escherichia coli, showed nondiscriminating it
glutamylates apicoplast trna(glu) trna(gln), determined kinetic
parameters, demonstrated inhibition known bacterial glurs inhibitor.
we also localized plasmodium berghei ortholog apicoplast blood
stage parasites could delete pbglurs gene. data show that
gln-trna(gln) biosynthesis plasmodium apicoplast proceeds via essential
indirect aminoacylation pathway reminiscent bacteria plastids.
