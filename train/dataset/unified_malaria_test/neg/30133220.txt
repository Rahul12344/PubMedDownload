objective: analyze sequence plasmodium vivax merozoite surface
protein-1(pvmsp-1) allele polymorphism imported local vivax malaria
parasites yunnan province.
methods: blood samples filter paper collected imported local
vivax malaria cases yunnan province august 2012 september 2015 
information epidemiological history recorded. plasmodium dna extracted
by dna extraction kit, block 5 region pvmsp-1 gene amplified 
pcr. pcr products sequenced blasted reference sequences m75674,
aan86237, m60807, abj53045, aan86238 baa18977. sequence polymorphism in
block 5 region pvmsp-1 analyzed mega 5.04 arlequin3.5.1
softwares. conserved sites, genetic distances among sequences and
shannon-wiener index among alleles calculated. clustering tree drawn
according genetic distances amino-acid sequences.
results: total 847 blood samples collected malaria cases,
comprising 61 samples local cases, 66 imported cases africa,
and 720 myanmar. block 5 region pvmsp-1 successfully amplified in
278 samples, sequencing successfully made 206 them. peptide
coded block 5 region length 193 222 aa. amino acid
sequence alignment showed 206 samples proportion genotypes of
sal-1, belem recombine 59.2%(122/206),23.3%(48/206) 17.5%(36/206),
respectively. proportion sal-1 genotype imported cases myanmar and
africa local cases 58.8%(104/177),73.3%(11/15) 50%(7/14),
respectively. genotypes sal-1, belem recombine 51, 9 6 different 
alleles. 66 alleles shannon wiener index (hâ€™) 0.955 expected 
heterozygosis (he) 0.567. 206 dna sequences 665-bp homologous locus,
comprising 75 conserved sites (11.3%,75/665) 590 variable sites (88.7%,
590/665). genetic distances sequences less 0.4. the
clustering analysis showed 206 sequences clustered two
categories three branches. homology recombine belem genotype was
91%-92%, higher sal-1 genotype (82%-83%).
conclusion: block 5 region pvmsp-1 gene local imported plasmodium
vivax yunnan province varied forms alleles, sal-1 genotype is
predominant among three genotypes.
