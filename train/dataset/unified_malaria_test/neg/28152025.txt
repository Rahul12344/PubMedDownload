glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) enzyme deficiency known offer
protection malaria increased selection mutant genes malaria 
endemic regions expected. however, anti-malarial drugs primaquine 
cause haemolytic anaemia persons g6pd deficiency. studied extent
of g6pd deficiency selected persons attending teaching hospitals of
anuradhapura kurunegala, two previously high malaria endemic districts sri
lanka. total 2059 filter-paper blood spots collected november 2013
and june 2014 analysed phenotypic g6pd deficiency using modified
wst-8/1-methoxy pms method. assay conducted set controls and
the colour development assessed visually well microplate reader at
od450-630nm. overall, 142/1018 (13.95%) 83/1041 (7.97%) g6pd deficient
in anuradhapura kurunegala districts respectively. g6pd prevalence was
significantly greater anuradhapura compared kurunegala (p<0.0001).
surprisingly, females equally affected males district: 35/313
(11.18%) males 107/705 (15.18%) females affected anuradhapura (p =
0.089); 25/313 (7.99%) males 58/728 (7.97%) females affected in
kurunegala (p = 0.991). prevalence greater among females anuradhapura than
in kurunegala (p<0.05), difference observed males
(p>0.05). severe deficiency (<10% normal) seen among 28/1018 (2.75%) in
anuradhapura (7 males; 21 females) 17/1041 (1.63%) kurunegala (7 males; 10
females). enzyme activity 10-30% observed among 114/1018 (11.20%; 28 
males; 86 females) anuradhapura 66/1041 (6.34%; 18 males; 48
females) kurunegala. screening educational programmes g6pd deficiency 
are warranted high risk areas irrespective gender prevention 
of disease states related condition.
