anopheles fluviatilis, major vector malaria india described a
complex three sibling species members, named s, u, based on
variations chromosomal inversions. also, ribosomal dna markers (repetitive
internal transcribed spacer 2 (its2) 28s d3 region) described to
differentiate three sibling species members. however, controversies prevail
on genetic isolation status cryptic species. hence, evaluated
this taxonomic incongruence employing dna barcoding, well established
methodology species identification, using 60 an. fluviatilis sensu lato
specimens, collected two malaria endemic eastern states india. these
specimens also subjected sibling species characterization its2 d3 
dna markers. former marker identified 31 specimens among an.

fragments specific t. d3 marker characterized 39 specimens
belonging species 21 species t. neither marker identified species u. 
neighbor joining analysis mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase gene 1 sequences 
(the dna barcode) categorized 60 specimens single operational
taxonomic unit, kimura 2 parameter (k2p) genetic variability only
0.8%. genetic differentiation (fst ) gene flow (nm ) estimates were
0.00799 62.07, respectively, indicating two 'species' (s & t) as
genetically con-specific intermixing populations negligible genetic
differentiation. earlier investigations refuted existence species u. 
also, study demonstrated an. fluviatilis closely related an.

(k2p = 5.0%).
