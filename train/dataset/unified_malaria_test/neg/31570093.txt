background: malaria caused plasmodium falciparum parasite still known be
one significant public health problems sub-saharan africa. genetic
diversity sudanese p. falciparum based diversity the
circumsporozoite surface protein (pfcsp) previously studied.
therefore, study aimed investigate genetic diversity the
n-terminal region pfcsp gene.
methods: cross-sectional molecular study conducted; 50 blood samples have
been analysed different regions sudan. patients recruited the
health facilities khartoum, new halfa, red sea, white nile, al qadarif,
gezira, river nile, ad damazin malaria transmission seasons between
june october december february 2017-2018. microscopic nested pcr
was performed detection p. falciparum. merozoite surface protein-1 was
performed differentiate single multiple clonal infections. n-terminal 
of pfcsp gene sequenced using pcr-sanger dideoxy method analysed
to sequences polymorphism including numbers haplotypes (h), segregating
sites (s), haplotypes diversity (hd) average number nucleotide
differences two sequences (pi) obtained using software dnasp
v5.10. well neutrality testing, tajima's test, fu li's f
statistics.
results: pcr amplification resulted 1200 bp pfcsp gene. 21 pcr
products successfully sequenced 29 presenting multiple clonal p. 
falciparum parasite sequenced. analysis n-terminal region 
the pfcsp amino acids sequence compared reference strains showed five
different haplotypes. h1 consisted 3d7, nf54, hb3 13 isolates the
sudanese pfcsp. h2 comprised 7g8, dd2, mad20, ro33, wellcome strain, 5
isolates sudanese pfcsp. h3, h4, h5 found 3 distinct isolates.
hd 0.594 ± 0.065, 12. common polymorphic site a98g;
other sites d82y, n83h, n83m, k85l, l86f, r87l, r87f, a98s. fu li's 
d* test value - 2.70818, fu li's f* test value - 2.83907, indicating 
a role negative balancing selection pfcsp n-terminal region. analysis
with global pfcsp n-terminal regions showed presence 13 haplotypes.
haplotypes frequencies 79.4%, 17.0%, 1.6% 1.0% h1, h2, h3 h4,
respectively. remaining haplotypes frequency 0.1% each. hd was
0.340 ± 0.017 pi 0.00485, 18 sites, pi 0.00030. amino
acid polymorphisms identified n-terminal region global pfcsp were
present eight positions (d82y, n83h/m, k85l/t/n, l86f, r87l/f, a98g/v/s, d99g,
and g100d).
conclusions: sudanese pfcsp n-terminal region well-conserved 
polymorphic sites. geographical distribution genetic diversity showed high
similarity african isolates, help contribute the
deployment rts,s, pfcsp-based vaccine, sudan.
