background: vivax malaria leading public health concern worldwide. due to
the high prevalence duffy-negative blood group population, plasmodium vivax in
africa historically less attributable remains neglected disease. the
interaction duffy binding protein cognate receptor, duffy antigen
receptor chemokine plays key role invasion red blood cells and
serves novel vaccine candidate p. vivax. however, polymorphic
nature p. vivax duffy binding protein (dbp), particularly n-terminal
cysteine-rich region (pvdbpii), represents major obstacle successful
design dbp-based vaccine enable global protection. study, the
level pvdbpii sequence variations, duffy blood group genotypes, number of
haplotypes circulating, natural selection pvdbpii sudan isolates
were analysed implication terms dbp-based vaccine design was
discussed.
methods: forty-two p. vivax-infected blood samples collected patients
from different areas sudan 2014-2016. duffy blood group genotyping,
the fragment indicates gata-1 transcription factor binding site fy
gene (- 33t > c) amplified pcr sequenced direct sequencing. the
region ii flanking pvdbpii pcr amplified sequenced direct sequencing. 
the genetic diversity natural selection pvdbpii done using dnasp ver 
5.0 mega ver 5.0 programs. based predominant, non-synonymous, single
nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), prevalence sudanese haplotypes assessed
in global isolates.
results: twenty snps (14 non-synonymous 6 synonymous) identified in
pvdbpii among 42 sudan p. vivax isolates. sequence analysis revealed 11 
different pvdbp haplotypes exist sudan p. vivax isolates region has
evolved positive selection. among identified pvdbp haplotypes five
pvdbp haplotypes shared among duffy-negative well duffy-positive
individuals. high selective pressure mainly found known b cell
epitopes (h3) pvdbpii. comparison sudanese haplotypes, based 10
predominant non-synonymous snps 10 malaria-endemic countries, demonstrated
that sudanese haplotypes prevalent endemic countries.
conclusion: first pvdbp genetic diversity study african
country. sudanese isolates display high haplotype diversity gene under
selective pressure. haplotype analysis indicated sudanese haplotypes a
representative sample global population. however, studies large
number samples needed. findings would valuable the
development pvdbp-based malaria vaccine.
