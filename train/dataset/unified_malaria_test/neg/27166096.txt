toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain containing adapter protein (tirap) plays a
crucial role tlr2 tlr4 signaling pathways. glycosylphospatidylinositol
(gpi), considered toxin molecule plasmodium falciparum, interacts tlr2 
and 4 induce immune inflammatory response. single nucleotide polymorphism
at coding region tirap (s180l) reported influence tlrs signaling. 
in present study, investigated association tirap (s180l)
polymorphism susceptibility/resistance severe p. falciparum malaria 
cohort adult patients india. tirap s180l polymorphism typed 347
cases severe malaria (sm), 232 uncomplicated malaria 150 healthy controls.
plasma levels tnf-α quantified elisa. heterozygous mutation (s/l)
conferred significant protection mod (multi organ dysfunction), ncsm
(non-cerebral severe malaria) well mortality. interestingly, homozygous
mutants (l/l) 16 fold higher susceptibility death. tirap mutants (s/l 
l/l) associated significantly higher plasma tnf-α levels compared to
wild type (s/s). results present study demonstrate tirap s180l
heterozygous mutation may protect patients severe malaria mortality.
