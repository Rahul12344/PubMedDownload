exocytosis essential lytic cycle apicomplexan parasites required
for pathogenesis toxoplasmosis malaria. doc2 proteins recruit the
membrane fusion machinery required exocytosis ca(2+)-dependent fashion. 
here, phenotype toxoplasma gondii conditional mutant impaired host
cell invasion egress pinpointed defect secretion the
micronemes, apicomplexan-specific organelle contains adhesion proteins.
whole-genome sequencing identified etiological point mutation tgdoc2.1. 
conditional allele orthologous gene engineered plasmodium falciparum 
was also defective microneme secretion. however, major effect on
invasion, suggesting microneme secretion dispensable plasmodium
egress.
