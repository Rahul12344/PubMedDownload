ongoing speciation important african malaria vectors gives rise to
cryptic populations, differ remarkably behavior, ecology, and
capacity vector malaria parasites. understanding population structure 
the drivers genetic differentiation among mosquitoes crucial effective 
disease control heterogeneity within vector species contributes to
variability malaria cases allow fractions populations escape control
efforts. examine population structure potential impacts recent
large-scale control interventions, investigated genomic patterns of
differentiation mosquitoes belonging anopheles nili group-a large
taxonomic group diverged ~3 myr ago. using 4,343 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps), detected strong population structure characterized by
high-fst values multiple divergent populations adapted different
habitats within central african rainforest. delineating cryptic species
within anopheles nili group challenging due incongruence between
morphology, ribosomal dna, snp markers consistent incomplete lineage
sorting and/or interspecific gene flow. high proportion loci fixed 
(fst = 1) within genome putative species, suggests ecological
and/or reproductive barriers maintained strong selection substantial 
number genes.
