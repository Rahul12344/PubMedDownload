the analysis prevalence distribution pvdhfr pvdhps mutations were
performed 169 samples collected patients plasmodium vivax infection 
who attended malaria clinics provinces along three international
borders thailand (thai-myanmar, thai-cambodian, thai-malaysian borders).
snp-haplotypes pvdhfr amino acid positions 13, 33, 57, 58, 61, 117, and
173 pvdhps positions 383 553 examined nested pcr-rflp. 
significant differences prevalence distribution pvdhfr pvdhps
combination alleles observed p. vivax isolates collected the
three border areas. prevalent combination alleles triple mutant
pvdhfr 57l/58r/117t alleles/double wild-type pvdhps alleles (n=18), double mutant
pvdhfr 58r/117n alleles/double wild-type pvdhps alleles (n=10), triple mutant
pvdhfr 58r/61m/117n alleles/double wild-type pvdhps alleles (n=52) single
mutant pvdhps 383g allele (n=28), respectively. information prevalence
and patterns pvdhfr pvdhps polymorphisms obtained present study
suggest presence sp pressure p. vivax isolates thailand could 
be linked introduction malaria neighboring countries. results 
not support application sp p. vivax control program thailand as
well neighboring countries.
