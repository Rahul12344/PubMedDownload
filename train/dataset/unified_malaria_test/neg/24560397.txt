detecting signals selection genome malaria parasites key to
identify targets drug vaccine development. malaria parasites a
unique life cycle alternating vector host organism population 
bottleneck transition. recurrent bottlenecks could influence the
patterns genetic diversity power existing population genetic tools 
to identify sites positive selection. therefore simulated the
site-frequency spectrum beneficial mutant allele time the
malaria life cycle. investigated power current population genetic
methods detect positive selection based site-frequency spectrum well
as temporal changes allele frequency. found within-host selective
advantage difficult detect using methods. although between-host
transmission advantage could detected, power decreased compared
with classical wright-fisher (wf) population model. using adjusted null
site-frequency spectrum takes malaria life cycle account, power
of tests based site-frequency spectrum detect positive selection is
greatly improved. study demonstrates importance considering life
cycle genetic analysis, especially parasites complex life cycles.
