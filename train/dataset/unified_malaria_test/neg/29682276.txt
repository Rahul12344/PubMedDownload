background: micrornas (mirnas) one kind small non-coding rnas widely
distributed insects. many studies shown mirnas play critical roles
in development, differentiation, apoptosis, innate immunity. however, there
are reports describing mirnas anopheles sinensis, common, and
one dominant malaria mosquito china. here, investigated global
mirna expression profile across four different developmental stages including
embryo, larval, pupal, adult stages using illumina hiseq 2500 sequencing.
results: total, 164 mirnas obtained 107.46 million raw sequencing 
reads. 99 identified known mirnas, remaining 65 mirnas were
considered novel. analyzing read counts mirnas developmental 
stages, 95 mirnas showed stage-specific expression (q < 0.01 |log2 (fold
change)| > 1) consecutive stages, indicating mirnas may involved
in critical physiological activity development. sixteen mirnas were
identified commonly dysregulated throughout four developmental stages. many
mirnas showed stage-specific expression, asi-mir-2943 exclusively
expressed embryo stage, asi-mir-1891 could detected larval
stage. expression six selected differentially expressed mirnas identified 
by qrt-pcr consistent sequencing results. furthermore, 5296 and
1902 target genes identified dysregulated 68 known 27 novel
mirnas respectively combining miranda rnahybrid prediction. go annotation 
and kegg pathway analysis predicted genes dysregulated mirnas revealed
that might involved broad range biological processes related with
the development, membrane, organic substance transport several key
pathways including protein processing endoplasmic reticulum, propanoate
metabolism folate biosynthesis. thirty-two key mirnas identified by
microrna-gene network analysis.
conclusion: present study represents first global characterization an.
sinensis mirnas four developmental stages. presence differential
expression an. sinensis mirnas imply mirnas may play critical roles 
in an. sinensis life cycle. better understanding functions these
mirnas great implication effective control vector population
and therefore interrupting malaria transmission.
