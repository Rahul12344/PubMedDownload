using segregation analyses, control malaria parasites previously been
linked major gene within chromosomal region 5q31-33, also complex
genetic factors effects substantial age-dependent influence.
however, responsible gene variants yet identified this
chromosomal region. order perform association analyses 5q31-33 locus
candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), 1015 children recruited at
the age 3 months followed monthly age 2 years area
holoendemic plasmodium falciparum malaria ghana. quantitative (incidence
rates malaria episodes) qualitative phenotypes (i.e. 'more one
malaria episode' 'not one malaria episode') used population-
and family-based analyses. strongest signal observed interleukin 
3 gene (il3) snp rs40401 (p = 3.4 × 10(-7), p(c)= 1.4 × 10(-4)). il3
genotypes rs40401(ct) rs40401(tt) found exert protective effect 
25% [incidence rate ratio (irr) 0.75, p = 4.1 × 10(-5)] 33% (irr 0.67, p =
3.2 × 10(-8)), respectively, malaria attacks. association was
confirmed transmission disequilibrium tests (tdt, qtdt). results could
argue role il3 pathophysiology falciparum malaria.
