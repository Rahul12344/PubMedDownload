it known people susceptible bacterial infections as
nontyphoid salmonella malaria infection, mice, malarial
hemolysis impairs resistance nontyphoid salmonella impairing neutrophil
oxidative burst. acquired neutrophil dysfunction consequence of
induction cytoprotective, heme-degrading enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (ho-1) in
neutrophil progenitors bone marrow. study, assessed whether
neutrophil dysfunction occurs humans malaria relates to
hemolysis. evaluated neutrophil function 58 gambian children with
plasmodium falciparum malaria [55 (95%) uncomplicated disease] examined 
associations erythrocyte count, haptoglobin, hemopexin, plasma heme,
expression receptors heme uptake, ho-1 induction. malaria caused the
appearance dominant population neutrophils reduced oxidative burst
activity, gradually normalized 8 wk follow-up. degree of
neutrophil impairment correlated significantly markers hemolysis ho-1
induction. ho-1 expression increased blood acute malaria, 
cellular level ho-1 expression modulated changes surface expression 
the haptoglobin receptor (cd163). findings demonstrate neutrophil
dysfunction occurs p. falciparum malaria support relevance the
mechanistic studies mice. furthermore, suggest presence a
regulatory pathway limit ho-1 induction hemolysis context of
infection indicate new targets therapeutic intervention abrogate the
susceptibility bacterial infection context hemolysis humans.
