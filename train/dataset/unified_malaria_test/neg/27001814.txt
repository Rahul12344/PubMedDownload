the emergence spread artemisinin-resistant plasmodium falciparum of
huge concern global effort toward malaria control elimination.
artemisinin resistance, defined delayed time parasite clearance following
administration artemisinin, associated mutations pfkelch13 gene
of resistant parasites. date, many 60 nonsynonymous mutations 
identified gene, whether mutations selected by
artemisinin usage merely reflect natural polymorphism independent selection
is currently unknown. clarify this, sequenced pfkelch13 propeller
domain 581 isolates collected (420 isolates) (161 isolates)
the implementation artemisinin combination therapies (acts), various
regions endemicity worldwide. nonsynonymous mutations observed 1% of
parasites isolated prior introduction acts. frequencies mutant
isolates, nucleotide diversity, haplotype diversity significantly higher
in parasites isolated populations exposed artemisinin those
from populations exposed drug. the
artemisinin-exposed population, significant excess dn compared ds was
observed, suggesting presence positive selection. contrast, pairwise
comparison dn ds mcdonald kreitman test indicate that
purifying selection acts pfkelch13 propeller domain populations not
exposed acts. population genetic analyses reveal low baseline of
pfkelch13 polymorphism, probably due purifying selection absence of
artemisinin selection. contrast, various pfkelch13 mutations been
selected artemisinin pressure.
