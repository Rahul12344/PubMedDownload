accumulating evidence displays abnormal deposition amyloid
beta-peptide (aβ) primary cause pathogenesis alzheimer's disease
(ad). therefore elimination aβ regarded important strategy
for ad treatment. discovery drug candidates using culture neuronal cells
against aβ peptide toxicity believed effective approach develop
drug treatment ad patients. previously showed that
artemisinin, fda-approved anti-malaria drug, neuroprotective effects
recently. present study, aimed investigate effects potential
mechanism artemisinin protecting neuronal pc12 cells toxicity β
amyloid peptide. studies revealed artemisinin, clinical relevant
concentration, protected rescued pc12 cells aβ25-35-induced cell death. 
further study showed artemisinin significantly ameliorated cell death due to
aβ25-35 insult restoring abnormal changes nuclear morphology, lactate
dehydrogenase, intracellular ros, mitochondrial membrane potential activity
of apoptotic caspase. western blotting analysis demonstrated artemisinin
activated extracellular regulated kinase erk1/2 akt survival signaling.
consistent role erk1/2, preincubation cells erk1/2 pathway
inhibitor pd98059 blocked effect artemisinin pi3k inhibitor ly294002
has effect. moreover, aβ1-42 also caused cells death pc12 cells while
artemisinin suppressed aβ1-42 cytotoxicity pc12 cells. taken together, these
results, first time, suggest artemisinin potential protectant
against β amyloid insult activation erk1/2 pathway. finding
provides potential application artemisinin prevention treatment of
ad.
