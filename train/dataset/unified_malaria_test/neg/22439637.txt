background: understanding origin spread mutations associated drug
resistance, especially context combination therapy, help guide
strategies halt prevent emergence resistance. unfortunately,
studies assessed complex processes resistance already highly
prevalent. even further, information evolutionary dynamics leading to
multidrug-resistant parasites scattered limited areas low or
seasonal malaria transmission. study describes dynamics strong
selection mutations conferring resistance sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine 
(sp), combination therapy, western kenya 1992 1999, 
sp became first-line therapy (1999). importantly, study based on
longitudinal data, allows comprehensive analysis contrasts 
previous cross-sectional studies carried endemic regions.
methods: study used 236 blood samples collected 1992 1999 the
asembo bay area kenya. pyrosequencing used determine alleles of
dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) dihydropterote synthase (dhps) genes.
microsatellite alleles spanning 138 kb around dhfr dhps, well as, neutral 
markers spanning approximately 100 kb chromosomes 2 3 characterized.
results: 1992, south-asian dhfr triple mutant already spreading,
albeit low frequency, holoendemic kenyan population, prior use 
of sp first-line therapy. additionally, dhfr triple mutant alleles that
originated independently predominant southeast asian lineage were
present sample set. likewise, dhps double mutants already present 
early 1992. evidence soft selective sweeps two dhfr mutant
alleles possible emergence selective sweep double mutant dhps
alleles 1992 1997. longitudinal structure dataset allowed 
estimation selection pressures various dhfr dhps mutants relative to
each based theoretical model tailored p. falciparum. data
indicate drug selection acted differently resistant alleles dhfr
and dhps, evidenced fitness differences. thus combination drug therapy
such sp, itself, appear select "multidrug"-resistant
parasites areas high recombination rate.
conclusions: complexity observations emphasizes importance of
population-based studies evaluate effects strong drug selection on
plasmodium falciparum populations.
