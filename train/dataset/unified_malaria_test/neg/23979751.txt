cerebral malaria (cm) associated low nitric oxide (no) bioavailability,
cerebrovascular constriction, occlusion, hypoperfusion. administration of
exogenous partially prevents neurological syndrome associated vascular
pathology experimental cm (ecm) mouse model. study, evaluated
the effects transdermal glyceryl trinitrate preventing ecm and, in
combination artemether, rescuing late-stage ecm mice mortality. the
glyceryl trinitrate and/or artemether effect survival clinical recovery
was evaluated c57bl/6 mice infected p. berghei anka. synthase (nos)
expression mouse brain determined western blots. mean arterial pressure
(map) pial arteriolar diameter monitored using tail-cuff blood
pressure system cranial window preparation, respectively. preventative
administration glyceryl trinitrate 0.025 mg/h decreased ecm mortality 
67 11% downregulated inducible nos expression brain. when
administered adjunctive rescue therapy artemether, glyceryl trinitrate
increased survival 47 79%. adjunctive therapy caused sustained
reversal pial arteriolar vasoconstriction ecm mice, effect observed 
with artemether alone. glyceryl trinitrate induced 13% decrease map in
uninfected mice affect map hypotensive ecm mice. glyceryl 
trinitrate, combined artemether, effective adjunctive rescue
treatment ecm. treatment ameliorated pial arteriolar vasospasm did
not significantly affect map. results indicate transdermal glyceryl
trinitrate potential considered candidate adjunctive therapy
for cm.
