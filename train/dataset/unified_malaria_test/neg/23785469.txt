mechanosensitive channels play important roles physiology many
organisms, dysfunction affect cell survival. suggests that
they might therapeutic targets pathogenic organisms. pathogenic protozoa
lead diseases malaria, dysentery, leishmaniasis trypanosomiasis
that responsible millions deaths year worldwide. analyzed 
genomes pathogenic protozoa show existence within genes
encoding putative homologues mechanosensitive channels. entamoeba histolytica,
leishmania spp., trypanosoma cruzi trichomonas vaginalis genes encoding 
homologues piezo channels, pathogenic protozoa genes encoding 
homologues mechanosensitive small-conductance (mscs) k(+)-dependent (msck)
channels. contrast, parasites examined lack genes encoding
mechanosensitive large-conductance (mscl), mini-conductance (mscm) and
degenerin/epithelial na(+) (deg/enac) channels. multiple sequence alignments of
evolutionarily distant protozoan, amoeban, plant, insect vertebrate piezo
channel subunits define absolutely conserved motif may involved in
channel conductance gating. mscs channels present humans, the
sequences protozoan human homologues piezo channels differ
substantially. suggests possibility specific targeting of
mechanosensitive channels pathogens therapeutic drugs.
