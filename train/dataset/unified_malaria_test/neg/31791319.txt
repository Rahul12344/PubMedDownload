background: asymptomatic falciparum non-falciparum malaria infections are
major challenges malaria control interventions, remain source of
continual infection community. becomes even important the
debate moves towards elimination eradication. study sought quantify
the burden plasmodium malaria infection seven communities eastern
region ghana.
methods: cross-sectional study recruited 729 participants aged 85 years old
and 7 closely linked communities. finger pricked blood used to
prepare thick thin blood smears well spot filter paper histidine
rich protein 2 (hrp2) rapid diagnostic test kit (rdt). genomic dna extracted 
from filter paper dry blood spot (dbs) used pcr amplify the
plasmodium 18s rrna gene using species specific pcr.
results: 96.6% participants identified afebrile, axillary
temperatures 37.5 °c. pcr identified 66% participants harbor
malaria parasites, 9 p. malariae 7 p. ovale mono-infections accounting
for 2.2% p. falciparum combined either 36 p. malariae 25 p. ovale
infections, accounting 13.3%. parasite prevalence microscopy (32%) was
similar rdt positivity rate (33%). false positive rdt results ranged 
64.6% children aged 5 9 years 10% adults aged 20 years and
above. significant differences observed falciparum non-falciparum 
parasite carriage community level, however young adults aged 15
and 19 years highest prevalence (34.8% (16/46)) p. falciparum p.
malariae parasite carriage whilst children aged 5 9 years the
highest level (11.4% (14/123)) p. ovale carriage.
conclusion: high rate misidentification non-falciparum parasites and
the total absence detection p. ovale microscopy suggests more
sensitive malaria diagnostic tools including molecular assays required to
accurately determine prevalence carriers non-falciparum parasites and
low density p. falciparum infections, especially national surveillance
exercises. additionally, malaria control interventions targeting the
non-falciparum species p. malariae p. ovale parasites needed.
