malaria parasites alter mosquito feeding behaviour way enhances
parasite transmission. widely considered prime example manipulation 
of host behaviour increase onward transmission, transient immune challenge
in absence parasites induce behavioural phenotype. here, we
show alterations feeding behaviour depend timing dose of

functionally linked changes insulin signalling mosquito gut. these
results suggest altered phenotypes derive insulin signalling-dependent 
host resource allocation among immunity, blood feeding, reproduction a
manner specific malaria parasite infection. measured large
