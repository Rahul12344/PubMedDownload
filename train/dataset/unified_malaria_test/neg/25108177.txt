plasmodium vivax duffy binding protein ii (dbpii) plays important role in
reticulocyte invasion potential vaccine candidate vivax malaria.
however, polymorphisms dbpii challenge successful design a
broadly protective vaccine. study, genetic diversity dbpii among
thai isolates analyzed plasmodium vivax-infected blood samples and
polymorphism characters defined mega4 program. sequence analysis
identified 12 variant residues common among thai dbpii haplotypes with
variant residues l333f, l424i, w437r i503k highest frequency.
variant residue d384k occurs combination either e385k k386n/q.
additionally, variant residue l424i occurs conjunction w437r thai
dbpii alleles variants frequently occur combination i503k
variant. polymorphic patterns thai isolates defined 9 haplotypes
(thai dbl-1, -2, -3, etc.…). thai dbl-2, -5, -6 haplotypes common
dbpii variants thai residents. study association thai dbpii
polymorphisms antigenic character, functional inhibition anti-dbpii
monoclonal antibodies panel thai dbl variants characterized by
an vitro erythrocyte binding inhibition assay. functional inhibition of
anti-dbpii monoclonal antibodies 3c9, 2d10 2c6 thai variants was
significantly different, suggesting polymorphisms thai dbpii variants
alter antigenic character target epitopes. contrast, anti-dbpii
monoclonal antibody 2h2 inhibited thai dbpii variants equally well. our
results suggest immune efficacy dbpii vaccine depend the
specificity anti-dbpii antibodies induced preferable to
optimize responses conserved epitopes broadly neutralizing protection
against p. vivax.
