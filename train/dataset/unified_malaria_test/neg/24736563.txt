background: malaria elimination/eradication campaigns emphasize interruption of
parasite transmission priority strategy. screening new drugs and
vaccines gametocytes therefore urgently needed. however, current
methods sexual stage drug assays, usually performed counting via
fluorescent markers either laborious restricted certain stage. here
we describe use transgenic parasite line assaying drug sensitivity
in gametocyte stages.
methods: transgenic parasite line expressing green fluorescence protein (gfp)
under control gametocyte-specific gene α-tubulin ii promoter was
generated. parasite line expresses gfp gametocyte stages. using 
transgenic line, developed flow cytometry-based assay determine drug
sensitivity gametocyte stages, tested gametocytocidal activities
of four antimalarial drugs.
findings: assay proved suitable determining drug sensitivity of
all sexual stages automated. z' factor 0.79 ± 0.02 indicated that
this assay could optimized high-throughput screening. daily
sensitivity gametocytes three antimalarial drugs (chloroquine,
dihydroartemisinin pyronaridine) showed drastic decrease stage iii on,
whereas remained relatively steady primaquine.
conclusions: drug assay developed use single transgenic parasite line 
for determining drug susceptibility gametocyte stages. assay may be
further automated high-throughput platform screening compound
libraries p. falciparum gametocytes.
