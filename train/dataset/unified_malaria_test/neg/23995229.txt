extracellular hemoglobin (hb) recognized disease trigger in
hemolytic conditions sickle cell disease, malaria, blood transfusion.
in vivo, many adverse effects free hb attenuated hb
scavenger acute-phase protein haptoglobin (hp). primary physiologic
disturbances caused free hb found within cardiovascular
system hb-triggered oxidative toxicity toward endothelium been

we systematically investigated structural, biochemical, cell biologic
nature hb toxicity endothelial cell system peroxidative stress. we
identified two principal mechanisms oxidative hb toxicity mediated by
globin degradation products modified lipoprotein species, respectively.
the two damage pathways trigger diverse discriminative inflammatory and
cytotoxic responses. hp provides structural stabilization hb shields hb's

pseudo-peroxidative reaction potential anti-oxidative function during
peroxidative stress.
