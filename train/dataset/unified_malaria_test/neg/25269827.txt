background: malaria incidence worldwide steadily declined past
decades. consequently, increasingly countries proceed control to
elimination. malaria distribution low incidence settings appears patchy,
and local transmission hotspots continuous source infection. this
study, species-specific clusters associated risk factors identified
based malaria prevalence data collected north-east cambodia. in
addition, plasmodium falciparum genetic diversity, population structure gene 
flows studied.
method: 2012, blood samples 5793 randomly selected individuals living 
117 villages collected ratanakiri province, cambodia. malariometric
data participant simultaneously accumulated using standard
questionnaire. two-step pcr allowed species-specific detection malaria
parasites, snp-genotyping p. falciparum performed. satscan used to
determine species-specific areas elevated risk infection, univariate
and multivariate risk analyses carried out.
result: pcr diagnosis found 368 positive individuals (6.4%) malaria
parasites, 22% contained mixed species infections. occurrence of
these co-infections frequent expected. specific areas elevated
risk infection detected plasmodium species. clusters for
falciparum, vivax ovale malaria appeared north province along
the main river, cluster malariae malaria situated elsewhere.
the relative risk malaria parasite carrier within clusters along the
river twice outside area. main risk factor associated three
out four malaria species overnight stay plot hut, human behaviour
associated indigenous farming. haplotypes show clear geographical
population structure, pairwise fst value comparison indicated higher parasite
flow along river.
discussion: spatial aggregation malaria parasite carriers, the
identification malaria species-specific risk factors provide key insights in
malaria epidemiology low transmission settings, guide targeted
supplementary interventions. consequently, future malaria programmes the
province implement additional specific policies targeting households
staying overnight farms outside village, addition migrants and
forest workers.
