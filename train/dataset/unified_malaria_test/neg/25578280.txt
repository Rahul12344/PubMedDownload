artemisinin sesquiterpenoid especially synthesized chinese herbal
plant, artemisia annua, widely used treatment malaria.
artemisinin accumulation enhanced exogenous abscisic acid (aba)
treatment. however, known aba signaling regulates artemisinin
biosynthesis. global expression profile phylogenetic analysis well as
the dual-luc screening revealed basic leucine zipper family transcription 
factor a. annua (namely aabzip1) involved aba signaling regulate
artemisinin biosynthesis. aabzip1 higher expression level the
inflorescences tissues; aba treatment, drought, salt stress
strongly induced expression aabzip1. yeast one-hybrid assay and
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa) showed aabzip1 bound the
aba-responsive elements (abre) promoter regions amorpha-4,11-diene 
synthase (ads) gene cyp71av1, two key structural genes the
artemisinin biosynthetic pathway. mutagenesis assay showed c1 domain
in n-terminus aabzip1 important transactivation activity.
furthermore, activation ads cyp71av1 promoters aabzip1 enhanced
by aba treatment transient dual-luc analysis. aabzip1 variant c1
domain deletion lost ability activate ads cyp71av1 promoters
regardless aba treatment. notably, overexpression aabzip1 a. annua
resulted significantly increased accumulation artemisinin. results
indicate aba promotes artemisinin biosynthesis, likely 1 activation 
of ads cyp71av1 expression aabzip a. annua. meanwhile, findings
reveal potential value aabzip1 genetic engineering artemisinin
production.
