background: malaria reduction future elimination china made more
difficult importation cases neighboring endemic countries,
particularly myanmar, laos, vietnam, increased travel africa by
chinese nationals. increasing prevalence artemisinin resistant parasites
across southeast asia highlights importance monitoring parasite
importation china. artemisinin resistance mekong region associated
with variants genes encoding k13 kelch domain protein (pf13k), found in
specific genetic backgrounds, including certain alleles genes encoding the
chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) multidrug resistance transporter
pgh1 (pfmdr1).
methods: study investigated prevalence drug resistance markers 
in 72 p. falciparum samples uncomplicated malaria infections tengchong
and yingjiang, counties yunnan-myanmar border. variants pf13k, pfcrt
and pfmdr1 described.
results: almost parasites harboured chloroquine-resistant alleles pfcrt,
whereas pfmdr1 diverse. major mutations k13 propeller domain
associated artemisinin resistance mekong region (c580y, r539t and
y493h) absent, f446i two previously undescribed mutations (v603e and
v454i) identified. protein structural modelling carried silico on
each k13 variants, based recently published crystal structures for
the k13 propeller domain. whereas f446i predicted elicit moderate
destabilisation propeller structure, v603e substitution likely to
lead relatively high protein instability. plotted stability
estimates, previously described variants, published
values vivo parasitaemia half-life, found quadratic regression
generates useful predictive algorithm.
conclusion: study provides baseline p. falciparum resistance-associated
mutations prevalent china-myanmar border. also show protein
modelling used generate testable predictions impact pfk13 
mutations vivo (and potentially vitro) artemisinin susceptibility.
