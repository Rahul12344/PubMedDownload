background: transgenic constructs intended stably established high
frequencies wild populations demonstrated "drive" low
frequencies experimental insect populations. linking population
transformation constructs genes render unable transmit pathogens
could eventually used stop spread vector-borne diseases like malaria
and dengue.
results: generally, population transformation constructs single
transgenic drive mechanism envisioned. using theoretical modelling
approach describe predicted properties construct combining autosomal 
medea underdominant population transformation systems. show when
combined exhibit synergistic properties broad circumstances
surpass single systems.
conclusion: combined systems, intentional population transformation 
reversal achieved readily. combined constructs also enhance capacity
to geographically restrict transgenic constructs targeted populations. is
anticipated properties likely particular value in
attracting regulatory approval public acceptance novel technology.
