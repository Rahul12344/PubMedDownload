bangladesh considered high-risk country emerging infectious diseases 
because high population density, poverty, unhygienic conditions.
although control efforts primarily focused major infectious diseases
such diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis, malaria, hiv infection, the
prevalence impact many local minor infectious diseases still
unclarified country. review, present recent experience and
outcomes collaborative research puerperal infection (pi), poorly
defined infectious disease bangladesh. pi common complication
during perinatal period developing countries. investigated the
incidence individual species aerobic bacteria causing pis drug
resistance, genetic traits isolates two-year period
(2010-2012). common species isolates patients pis were
escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, proteus
mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae. remarkable finding
was high rates resistance cephalosporins among gram-negative bacteria
harboring extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes, associated with
carbapenem resistance isolates. study defined importance of
control antimicrobial resistance bangladesh, provided suggestions for
the future direction collaborative research infectious diseases in
bangladesh.
