recurrent parasitaemia follow clinical trials antimalarial drug
efficacy results either recrudescence parasites surviving treatment or
from parasites newly emerging hepatic stage infection. nested pcr 
used distinguish two possibilities technique difficult to
standardise. risk false positive false negative results,
leading misclassification errors. high-resolution melt (hrm) assay was
developed pairs conserved primers targeting blocks merozoite surface
protein 1 2 (msp1 msp2) genes, polymorphisms compared using
sequence-confirmed plasmodium falciparum dna samples laboratory isolates. in
this study, hrm dissociation profiles msp1 msp2 amplicons were
determined validated parasite isolates malaria patients. the
msp1 msp2 profiles laboratory clinical isolates reproducibly
differentiated hrm. rapid assays performed closed-tube system, 
and avoid cross-contamination increasing throughput, two major
advantages. hrm assays offer significant gains simplicity, speed and
interpretation results, reduced analysis cost, studies require
discrimination parasite clones. assay performance large-scale studies
utilizing dna samples derived filter-paper bloodspots be
evaluated.
