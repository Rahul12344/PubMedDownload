a sequence computational methods used predicting novel drug targets
against drug resistant malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum. comparative
genomics, orthologous protein analysis among malaria parasites and
protein-protein interaction study provide us new insights determining the
essential genes novel therapeutic candidates. among predicted list 21 
essential proteins unique pathways, 11 proteins prioritized as
anti-malarial drug targets. case study, built homology models two
uncharacterized proteins using modeller v9.13 software possible templates.
functional annotation proteins done interpro databases and
from probis server comparison predicted binding site residues. model
has subjected silico docking study screened potent lead compounds
from zinc database dock blaster software using autodock 4. results from
this study facilitate selection proteins putative inhibitors entry
into drug design production pipelines.
