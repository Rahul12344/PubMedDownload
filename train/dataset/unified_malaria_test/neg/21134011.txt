3134 mosquitoes representing 27 species screened. mosquitoes belonging to
four genera (aedes, coquillettidia, culex mansonia) infected with
twenty-two parasite lineages (18 plasmodium spp. 4 haemoproteus spp.).

these lineages previously detected avian host species the

avian plasmodium spp. vector breadth always accompany vertebrate-host

mosquito-parasite interactions avian plasmodium species likely 
not tightly coevolved vector species.
