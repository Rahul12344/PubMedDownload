the phosphobase methylation pathway catalyzed phosphoethanolamine
methyltransferase plasmodium falciparum (pfpmt), malaria parasite, offers 
an attractive target anti-parasitic drug development. pfpmt methylates
phosphoethanolamine (pea) phosphocholine use membrane biogenesis.
quantum mechanics molecular mechanics (qm/mm) calculations tested the
proposed reaction mechanism methylation pea involving previously
identified tyr-19-his-132 dyad, indicated energetically unfavorable
mechanism. instead, qm/mm calculations suggested alternative mechanism
involving asp-128. reaction coordinate involves stepwise transfer a
proton asp-128 via bridging water molecule followed typical sn2-type
methyl transfer s-adenosylmethionine pea. functional analysis the
d128a, d128e, d128q, d128n pfpmt mutants shows loss activity pea
but final substrate methylation pathway. x-ray crystal
structures pfpmt-d128a mutant complex s-adenosylhomocysteine and
either pea phosphocholine reveal mutation asp-128 disrupts hydrogen
bond network active site. combined qm/mm, biochemical, structural 
studies identify key role asp-128 initial step phosphobase
methylation pathway plasmodium provide molecular insight evolution 
of multiple activities active site pmt.
