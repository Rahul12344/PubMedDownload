background: parasite cytoadherence within microvasculature tissues and
organs infected individuals implicated pathogenesis several
malaria syndromes. multiple host receptors may mediate sequestration. the
identity host receptor(s), parasite ligand(s) responsible for
sequestration plasmodium species plasmodium falciparum largely
unknown. rodent malaria parasites may useful model interactions of
parasite species, lack var genes respective hosts, 
multigene families shared species. role endothelial
receptors icam-1 cd36 cytoadherence development pathology
was investigated plasmodium chabaudi infection c57bl/6 mice lacking these
receptors. schizont membrane-associated cytoadherence (smac) protein of
plasmodium berghei shown exhibit reduced cd36-associated
cytoadherence p. berghei anka-infected mice.
methods: parasite tissue sequestration development acute stage
pathology p. chabaudi infections mice lacking cd36 icam-1, their
respective wild type controls, infections mutant p. chabaudi
parasites lacking smac gene compared. peripheral blood parasitaemia, red
blood cell numbers weight change monitored throughout courses of
infection. imaging bioluminescent parasites isolated tissues (spleen,
lungs, liver, kidney gut) used measure tissue parasite load.
results: study shows neither lack cd36 deletion the
smac gene p. chabaudi significantly impacted acute-stage pathology or
parasite sequestration. contrast, absence icam-1, infected animals
experience less anaemia weight loss, reduced parasite accumulation both
spleen liver higher peripheral blood parasitaemia acute stage
malaria. reduction parasite tissue sequestration infections icam-1
null mice maintained mosquito transmission.
conclusions: results indicate icam-1-mediated cytoadherence is
important p. chabaudi model malaria suggest rodent
malarias, p. falciparum, may multiple host parasite molecules
involved sequestration.
