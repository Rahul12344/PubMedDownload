host cell infection apicomplexan parasites plays essential role in
lifecycle progression obligate intracellular pathogens. most
species, including etiological agents malaria toxoplasmosis, infection
requires active host-cell invasion dependent formation tight junction -
the organising interface parasite host cell entry. formation
of structure not, however, shared across apicomplexa indeed all
parasite lifecycle stages. here, using silico integrative genomic search
and endogenous gene-tagging strategy, sought characterise proteins that
function specifically junction-dependent invasion, class proteins 
term invasins distinguish adhesins function species specific
host-cell recognition. high-definition imaging tagged plasmodium falciparum
invasins localised proteins multiple cellular compartments blood stage 
merozoite. includes several localise distinct subcompartments within
the rhoptries. originating organelle, however, 
different dynamics invasion. apical sushi protein rhoptry neck protein
2 release early, following junction, whilst novel rhoptry protein pff0645c 
releases invasion complete. supports idea that
organisation proteins within secretory organelle determines order and
destination protein secretion provides localisation-based classification
