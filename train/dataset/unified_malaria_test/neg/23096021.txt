background: plasmodium vivax reticulocyte binding protein-2 (pvrbp-2) a
promising candidate development vaccine parasite. dna sequence
polymorphism pvrbp-2 may hamper vaccine development program been
identified laboratory strains. therefore, unraveling genetic polymorphism in
pvrbp-2 field isolates prerequisite success vaccine development.
this study designed primary aim uncover genetic polymorphism in
pvrbp-2 among p. vivax field isolates.
results: using virtual restriction mapping pvrbp-2 sequences, two restriction 
enzymes (alui apoi) selected development pvrbp-2 a
pcr-rflp marker. restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis
revealed high degree genetic polymorphism pvrbp-2 gene among field
isolates p. vivax. apoi-rflp found efficient identifying the
extent genetic polymorphism pvrbp-2 compared alui-rflp. combined
genotyping/haplotyping rflp pattern revealed total 36 distinct rflp
patterns among 83 p. vivax isolates analyzed. dna sequence analysis also supports
high degree genetic polymorphism among field isolates p. vivax. pvrbp-2
pcr-rflp method able distinguish multiple infection 16.86% it
revealed low level shared genetic pool two populations.
conclusion: study suggests pvrbp-2 highly polymorphic genetic marker 
which used population genetic analyses. rflp analysis suggests
presence nearly similar proportion sal-1 belem alleles indian p.
vivax populations. larger extent genetic polymorphism identified from
limited samples advocates screen genetic polymorphism pvrbp-2 malaria 
endemic geographical regions countries designing pvrbp-2 based
anti-malarial control measures.
