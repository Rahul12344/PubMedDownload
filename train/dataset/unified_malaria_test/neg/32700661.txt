chikungunya fever viral mosquito-borne, acute febrile illness associated
with rash, joint pain, occasionally prolonged polyarthritis. chikungunya
outbreaks reported worldwide including many provinces thailand.
although chikungunya virus (chikv) occurs thailand, details its
epidemiology lacking compared dengue, common mosquito-borne disease in
the country. therefore, study chikv epidemiology humans and
mosquitoes required better understand importance clinically and
dynamics community settings. prospective examination virus circulation
in human mosquito populations northeastern thailand using serological 
molecular methods, including genetic characterization virus, was
undertaken. study conducted among febrile patients eight district
hospitals northeastern thailand june 2016 october 2017. using
real-time pcr conserved region nonstructural protein 1 gene, chikv 
detected eight (4.9%) 161 plasma samples. one strain yielded a
sequence sufficient size allowing phylogenetic analysis. addition,
anti-chikv igm igg detected six (3.7%) 17 (10.6%) patient plasma 
samples. single sequenced sample belonged east/central/south africa
(ecsa) genotype phylogenetically similar indian ocean sub-lineage.
adult aedes mosquitoes collected indoors within 100-m radius 
index case house four neighboring houses. chikv detected two 70
(2.9%) female aedes aegypti mosquito pools. study clearly demonstrated the
presence local transmission ecsa genotype chikv northeastern
region thailand.
