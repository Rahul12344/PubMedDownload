a major challenge success malaria control program saudi arabia is
the high influx expatriates holy visitors malaria endemic countries. 
in present study examined whether drug resistant parasite genotypes
reported jazan region, southwest saudi arabia imported developed
locally. examined 178 plasmodium falciparum isolates alleles of
dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr), associated
with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) resistance, three microsatellites
flanking gene. addition, examined neutral polymorphic gene (pfg377).
we compared dhfr dhps haplotypes jazan, using network analysis, 
existing similar data set 94 p. falciparum isolates eastern sudan. in
jazan, double mutant dhfr allele (51i, 108n) occurred prevalence 33%.
the vast majority (99%) dhps wild-type alleles. mean expected
heterozygosity (h(e)) microsatellites around mutant dhfr alleles (h(e)=0.312; 
n=60) lower (p ≤ 0.05) around wild-type allele (h(e)=0.834;
n=116). also, mutant dhfr isolates showed high h(e) dhps (h(e)=0.80) 
the non-drug resistance locus pfg377 (h(e)=0.63) indicative selection for
mutant dhfr only. predominant double mutant dhfr haplotype jazan (73%),
was prevalent among p. falciparum east africa. network analysis suggests the
mutant haplotype dhfr gene possibly introduced jazan east
africa. absence mutations dhps well triple mutant dhfr haplotype 
associated sp failure support current use sp partner with
artesunate first line therapy saudi arabia. however, close
relationship major mutant dhfr haplotype sudan saudi arabia,
favour hypothesis recent migration source major resistant dhfr
lineage. thus, regular monitoring dhfr dhps haplotypes high
priority guard possible importation high level sp resistant lineages.
