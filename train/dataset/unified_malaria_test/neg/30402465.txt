evolution spread malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum capable evading
antimalarials prime concern malaria control. currently effective
drug, artemisinin (art), threat due detection art-resistant p.
falciparum parasites southeast asian countries. shown that
amino acid (aa) mutations p. falciparum kelch13 (pfk13) gene provide
resistance art. nigeria, part sub-saharan africa, highly endemic
to malaria, contributing quite significantly malaria, resistance to
chloroquine (cq) sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) combination drugs already
been reported. since artemisinin combined therapy (act) first-line drug
for treatment uncomplicated malaria nigeria five amino acid mutations
have validated pfk13 gene alongside candidate mutations art 
resistance, performed molecular surveillance mutations (following pcr 
dna sequence analyses) gene two southwestern states nigeria.
statistical analyses dna sequences also performed following different
evolutionary models. none different validated candidate aa mutations
of pfk13 gene conferring resistance art could detected p. falciparum
sampled two southwestern states nigeria. addition, dna sequencing
and sequence analyses indicated neither evolutionary selection pressure the
pfk13 gene association mutations pfk13 gene mutations other
three genes conferring resistance cq sp. therefore, based the
monomorphism pfk13 gene nonassociation mutations gene 
mutations three drug-resistant genes malaria parasite p. falciparum, 
it proposed malaria public health immediate threat in
southwestern nigeria concerning art resistance.
