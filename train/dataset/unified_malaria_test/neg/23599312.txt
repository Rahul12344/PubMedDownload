background: mechanism action artemisinins malaria unclear,
despite widespread use combination therapies emergence of
resistance.
results: here, report expression pfatp6 (a serca pump) yeast and
demonstrate inhibition artemisinins. mutations pfatp6 identified in
field isolates (such s769n) laboratory clones (such l263e) decrease 
susceptibility artemisinins, whereas increase susceptibility unrelated
inhibitors cyclopiazonic acid. predicted yeast model,
plasmodium falciparum l263e mutation also susceptible to
cyclopiazonic acid. inability knockout parasite serca pumps provides
genetic evidence essential asexual stages development.
thaperoxides new class potent antimalarial designed act inhibiting
pfatp6. results yeast confirm inhibition.
conclusions: identification inhibitors effective mutated pfatp6
suggests ways artemisinin resistance may overcome.
