haemosporidian blood parasites transmitted wide range avian hosts via
blood-sucking dipteran vectors. microscopy revealed impressive diversity
of avian haemosporidia 250 species described. moreover, pcr and
subsequent sequence analyses suggested much greater diversity of
haemosporidia morphological analyses alone. given importance these
parasites, studies focused charismatic hummingbirds. to
date, three haemoproteus species (haemoproteus archilochus, haemoproteus
trochili, haemoproteus witti) one leucocytozoon species (leucocytozoon
quynzae) described blood samples taken hummingbirds
(trochilidae). unconfirmed plasmodium lineages also detected in
hummingbirds. here, report detection h. archilochus two hummingbird 
species (calypte anna archilochus alexandri) sampled northern california
and perform phylogenetic analysis mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) gene
lineages. total 261 hummingbirds (157 c. anna, 104 a. alexandri) were
sampled screened blood parasites using pcr microscopy techniques.
combining methods, 4 (2.55%) haemosporidian infections detected c.
anna 18 (17.31%) haemosporidian infections detected a. alexandri.
molecular analyses revealed four distinct h. archilocus cyt b lineages, which
clustered monophyletic clade. species plasmodium leucocytozoon were
detected study, raising possibility specific vector associations
with hummingbirds. results provide resources future studies of
haemosporidian prevalence, diversity, pathogenicity california hummingbird
populations.
