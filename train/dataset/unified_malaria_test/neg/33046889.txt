the dynamics cd4+ cell memory development remain examined genome
scale. malaria-endemic regions, antimalarial chemoprevention protects long
after cessation associates effects cd4+ cells. applied
single-cell rna sequencing computational modelling track memory
development plasmodium infection treatment. absence central 
memory precursors, two trajectories developed helper 1 (th1) follicular 
helper (tfh) transcriptomes contracted partially coalesced three
weeks. progeny single clones populated th1 tfh trajectories, and
fate-mapping suggested minimal lineage plasticity. relationships
between tfh central memory revealed, antimalarials modulating these
responses boosting th1 recall. finally, single-cell epigenomics confirmed
that heterogeneity among effectors partially reset memory. thus, the
effector-to-memory transition cd4+ cells gradual malaria is
modulated antiparasitic drugs. graphical user interfaces presented for
examining gene-expression dynamics gene-gene correlations (
