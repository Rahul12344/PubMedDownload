despite decades intensive research efforts currently vaccine 
provides sustained sterile immunity malaria. context, large
number targets different stages plasmodium falciparum life
cycle evaluated vaccine candidates. none candidates has
fulfilled expectations, long lack single target induces
strain-transcending protective immune responses, combining key antigens from
different life cycle stages seems promising route toward the
development efficacious malaria vaccines. identification of
potential targets using approaches omics-based technology reverse
immunology, rapid expression, purification, characterization these
proteins, well generation analysis fusion constructs combining
different promising antigens antigen domains committing expensive
and time consuming clinical development, represents one bottlenecks the
vaccine development pipeline. production recombinant proteins transient
gene expression plants robust versatile alternative cell-based
microbial eukaryotic production platforms. transfection plant tissues 
and/or whole plants using agrobacterium tumefaciens offers low technical entry 
barrier, low costs, high degree flexibility embedded within rapid 
scalable workflow. recombinant proteins easily targeted different
subcellular compartments according physicochemical requirements,
including post-translational modifications, ensure optimal yields high
quality product, support simple economical downstream processing.
here, demonstrate use plant transient expression platform based on
transfection a. tumefaciens essential component malaria vaccine
development workflow involving screens expression, solubility, stability 
using fluorescent fusion proteins. results implemented the
evidence-based iterative design expression vaccine candidates combining
suitable p. falciparum antigen domains. antigens also produced,
purified, characterized studies taking advantage the
scalability platform.
