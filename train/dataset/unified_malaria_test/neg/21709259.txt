combination regimens include artemisinin derivatives recommended as
first line antimalarials countries malaria endemic. however, the
mechanism action artemisinin fully understood usefulness 
this drug class threatened reports decreased parasite sensitivity. we
treated plasmodium falciparum periods hours mimic clinical
exposure short half-life artemisinins. found drug treatment
retards parasite growth inhibits uptake hemoglobin, even sublethal
concentrations. show potent artemisinin activity dependent on
hemoglobin digestion parasite. inhibition hemoglobinase activity with
cysteine protease inhibitors, knockout cysteine protease falcipain-2 by
gene deletion, direct deprivation host cell lysate, significantly decreases
artemisinin sensitivity. hemoglobin digestion also required for
artemisinin-induced exacerbation oxidative stress parasite cytoplasm.
arrest hemoglobin digestion early stage parasites provides mechanism 
surviving short-term artemisinin exposure. insights help design
of new drugs new treatment strategies circumvent drug resistance.
