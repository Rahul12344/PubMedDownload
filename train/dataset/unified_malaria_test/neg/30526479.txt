background: malaria parasites genetically polymorphic phenotypically
plastic. studying transcriptome variation among parasites different
infections, challenging overcome potentially confounding technical and
biological variation samples. investigate variation major human
parasite plasmodium falciparum, generating rna-seq data multiple independent
replicate sample preparations merozoite-containing intra-erythrocytic
schizonts panel clinical isolates long-term laboratory-adapted
clones, goal robustly identifying differentially expressed genes.
results: analysis biological sample replicates shows increased numbers
improve true discovery rate differentially expressed genes, six
independent replicates parasite line allowed identification most
differences could detected larger numbers. highly expressed
genes, focusing top quartile schizont stages, power to
detect differences. comparing cultured clinical isolates laboratory-adapted
clones, genes highly expressed laboratory-adapted clones include
those encoding ap2 transcription factor (pf3d7_0420300), ubiquitin-binding
protein two putative methyl transferases. contrast, higher expression in
clinical isolates seen merozoite surface protein gene dblmsp2,
proposed marker schizonts forming merozoites committed sexual
differentiation. variable expression extremely strongly, exclusively,
associated genes known targeted heterochromatin protein 1. clinical
isolates show variable expression several known merozoite invasion ligands, as
well genes new rt-qpcr assays validate quantitation and
allow characterisation samples limited material. expression levels
of genes vary among schizont preparations different clinical isolates in
the first ex vivo cycle patient erythrocytes, mean levels similar to
those continuously cultured clinical isolates.
conclusions: analysis multiple biological sample replicates greatly improves
identification genes variably expressed different cultured parasite
lines. clinical isolates recently established culture show differences from
long-term adapted clones transcript levels particular genes, are
suitable analyses requiring biological replicates understand parasite
phenotypes variable expression likely relevant nature.
