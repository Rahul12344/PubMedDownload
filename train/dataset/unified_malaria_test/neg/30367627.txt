background: building declining trend malaria ethiopia, federal
ministry health aims eliminate malaria 2030. plasmodium falciparum
and plasmodium vivax co-endemic ethiopia, use primaquine is
indicated transmission interruption radical cure, respectively.
however, limited knowledge local prevalence glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency associated variants hindered use 
of primaquine.
methods: 11,138 dried blood spot (dbs) samples collected 2011 as
part national, household malaria indicator survey, multi-stage nationally 
representative survey malaria-endemic areas ethiopia. randomly
selected sub-set 1414 dbs samples successfully genotyped polymerase
chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) technique.
considering geographical position ethnic mix country, three common
variants: g6pd*a (a376g), g6pd*a- (g202a) mediterranean (c563t) were
investigated.
results: 1998 randomly selected individuals, 1429 (71.5%) dbs samples were
genotyped merged database, 53.5% females. g6pd*a
(a376g) genotype detected. sample positive either g6pd*a-
(g202a) mediterranean (c563t) variants. prevalence g6pd*a (a376g) was
8.9% [95% confidence interval (ci) 6.7-11.2] ranging 12.2% southern
nations, nationalities peoples' (95% ci 5.7-18.7) none dire dawa/harari
region.
conclusion: common g6pd*a- (g202a) mediterranean (c563t) variants not
observed nationwide study. observed g6pd*a (a376g) mutation has
little clinical significance. findings supported adoption of
primaquine p. falciparum transmission interruption radical cure p.
vivax ethiopia. presence clinically important, less common
variants cannot ruled out, implementation radical cure be
accompanied active haematological adverse events monitoring ethiopia.
