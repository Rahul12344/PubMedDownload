background: hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) one leading causes of
cancer-related death china. lack effective treatment this
disease results high recurrence rate patients undergo radical tumor
resection, 5-year survival rate patients remains low. our
previous studies demonstrated plasmodium infection provides potent
antitumor effect inducing innate adaptive immunity murine lewis lung 
carcinoma (llc) model.
methods: study aimed investigate inhibitory effect plasmodium
infection hepatocellular carcinoma mice, various techniques gene
expression analysis used identify possible signal regulation mechanisms.
results: found plasmodium infection efficiently inhibited tumor
progression prolonged survival tumor-bearing mice, served a
murine implanted hepatoma model. inhibition tumor progression by
plasmodium infection related suppression tumor angiogenesis within 
tumor tissue decreased infiltration tumor-associated macrophages (tams).
further study demonstrated matrix metalloprotease 9 (mmp-9) produced tams
contributed tumor angiogenesis inÂ the tumor tissue the
parasite-induced reduction mmp-9 expression tams resulted the
suppression tumor angiogenesis. mechanistic study revealed the
plasmodium-derived hemozoin (hz) accumulated tams inhibited igf-1
signaling pi3-k mapk signaling pathways thereby decreased the
expression mmp-9 tams.
conclusions: study suggests novel approach inhibiting tumor
angiogenesis plasmodium infection high importance development of
new therapies cancer patients. video abstract.
