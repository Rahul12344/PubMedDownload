malaria parasites survive repairing plethora dna double-stranded
breaks (dsbs) experienced asexual growth. plasmodium rad51
mediated homologous recombination (hr) mechanism homology-independent
alternative end-joining mechanism identified. address whether
loss hr activity compensated dsb repair mechanisms. creating a
transgenic plasmodium line defective hr function, demonstrate hr is
the important dsb repair pathway malarial parasite. using mouse malaria
model characterized dominant negative effect pfrad51(k143r) mutant
on plasmodium dsb repair host-parasite interaction. work illustrates that
plasmodium berghei harbouring mutant protein (pfrad51(k143r)) failed to
repair dsbs evidenced hypersensitivity dna-damaging agent. mice infected
with mutant parasites lived significantly longer markedly reduced parasite
burden. better understand effect mutant pfrad51(k143r) hr, used
yeast surrogate model established presence pfrad51(k143r)
completely inhibited dna repair, gene conversion gene targeting. biochemical 
experiment confirmed low level mutant protein sufficient for
complete disruption wild-type pfrad51 activity. hence work provides
evidence hr pathway plasmodium could efficiently targeted curb
malaria.
