one powerful approaches understanding gene function involves
turning genes measuring impact cellular or
organismal level. particularly applies cohort essential genes
where traditional gene knockouts inviable. plasmodium falciparum,
conditional control gene expression achieved using multicomponent 
systems individual modules interact regulate dna
recombination, transcription, posttranscriptional processes. recently
devised tetr-dozi aptamer system relies ligand-regulatable interaction 
a protein module synthetic rna aptamers control translation a
target gene. technique successfully employed study essential
genes p. falciparum involves insertion several aptamer copies 
the 3' untranslated regions (utrs), provide control mrna fate.
however, aptamer repeats prone recombination one copies be

we rectified issue redesigning aptamer array minimize
recombination preserving control elements. proof concept, we
compared original modified arrays ability knock the
levels putative essential apicoplast protein (pf3d7_0815700) and
demonstrated modified array highly stable efficient. this

conditional knockdown knockout approaches dissect function. one 
approach tetr-dozi system employs multiple synthetic aptamers 
untranslated regions target genes control expression a
tetracycline-dependent manner. maintaining modified parasites intact aptamer
copies challenging since repeats lost recombination. 
interspacing aptamers unique sequences, created stable genetic
system remains effective controlling target gene expression.
