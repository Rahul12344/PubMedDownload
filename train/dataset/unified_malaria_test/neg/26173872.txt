background: genome wide sequence analyses malaria parasites widely
separated areas world identified contrasting population structures
and signatures selection. compare relatively closely situated but
ecologically contrasting regions within endemic african country, population
samples plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates collected ghana from
kintampo central forest-savannah area, navrongo drier savannah
area ~350 km north seasonally-restricted transmission. parasite 
dna sequenced paired-end reads mapped p. falciparum reference
genome.
results: high coverage genome wide sequence data 85 different clinical
isolates enabled analysis 121,712 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps). 
local populations similar proportions mixed genotype infections, similar
snp allele frequency distributions, eleven chromosomal regions elevated
integrated haplotype scores (|ihs|) both. between-population rsb metric
comparing extended haplotype homozygosity indicated stronger signal within
kintampo one regions (on chromosome 14) navrongo two of
these regions (on chromosomes 10 13). least one gene these
identified regions potential target locally varying selection. the
candidates include genes involved parasite development mosquitoes, members 
of variant-expressed multigene families, leading vaccine-candidate target
of immunity.
conclusions: background similar population structure and
selection signatures p. falciparum populations ghana, three narrow
genomic regions showed evidence indicating local differences historical timing
or intensity selection. sampling closely situated populations across
heterogeneous environments potential refine mapping important loci 
under temporally spatially varying selection.
