the plasmodium falciparum var multigene family encodes cytoadhesive, variant 
antigen pfemp1. p. falciparum antigenic variation cytoadhesion specificity
are controlled epigenetic switching single, few, simultaneously
expressed var genes. var genes maintained perinuclear clusters of
heterochromatic telomeres. active var gene(s) occupy single, perinuclear
var expression site. unresolved whether var expression site forms in
situ telomeric cluster whether extant compartment which
single chromosomes travel, thus controlling var switching. show that
transcription var gene require decreased colocalisation with
clusters telomeres, supporting var expression site formation situ. however 
following recombination within adjacent subtelomeric sequences, var gene
was persistently activated colocalise less telomeric clusters. thus,
participation stable, heterochromatic, telomere clusters var switching are
independent affected subtelomeric sequences. var expression
site colocalised euchromatic mark h3k27ac greater extent it
did heterochromatic h3k9me3. h3k27ac enriched within active var gene
promoter even var gene transiently repressed mature parasites and
thus h3k27ac may contribute var gene epigenetic memory.
