apolipophorin iii (apolp-iii) well-known hemolymph protein a
functional role lipid transport immune responses insects. we
report molecular functional characterization anopheles stephensi
apolipophorin-iii (asapolp-iii) gene. gene consists 679 nucleotides
arranged two exons 45 540 bp give orf encoding 194 amino acid
residues. excluding putative signal peptide first 19 amino acid
residues, 175-residues mature asapolp-iii protein calculated
molecular mass 22 kda. phylogenetic analysis revealed divergence of
mosquitoes (order diptera) apolp-iii counterparts moths (order:
lepidoptera). also, revealed close relatedness asapolp-iii apolp-iii
of an. gambiae. asapolp-iii mrna expression strongly induced plasmodium
berghei infected mosquito midguts suggesting crucial role parasite
development. asapolp-iii silencing decreased p. berghei oocysts numbers 7.7
fold controls. effects might due interruption of
asapolp-iii mediated lipid delivery developing oocysts. addition,
nitric oxide synthase (nos), antiplasmodial gene, also highly induced in
asapolp-iii silenced midguts suggesting gene acts like agonist and
protects plasmodium mosquito immunity.
