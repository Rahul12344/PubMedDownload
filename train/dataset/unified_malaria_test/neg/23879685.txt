acanthamoeba spp. free-living amoebae ubiquitous natural
environments. cause cutaneous, nasopharyngeal, disseminated
infection, leading granulomatous amebic encephalitis (gae) in
immunocompromised individuals. addition, cause amoebic keratitis in
contact lens wearers. acanthamoeba gae almost always fatal of
difficulty delay diagnosis lack optimal antimicrobial therapy.
here, report description unusual strain isolated skin brain
of gae patient. amoebae displayed large trophozoites star-shaped cysts,
characteristics acanthamoebas belonging morphology group 1. however, its
unique morphology growth characteristics differentiated new strain 
other group 1 species. dna sequence analysis, secondary structure prediction, and
phylogenetic analysis 18s rrna gene confirmed new strain
belonged group 1, distinct sequence types
within group. thus, hereby propose establishment new species,
acanthamoeba byersi n. sp. well new sequence type, t18, new
strain. knowledge, first report group 1 acanthamoeba that
is indisputably pathogenic humans.
