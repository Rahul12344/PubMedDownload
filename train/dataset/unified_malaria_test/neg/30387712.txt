a subset atypical memory b cells accumulates malaria several
infections, autoimmune disorders aging humans mice. been
suggested cells exhausted long-lived memory b cells, their
accumulation may contribute poor acquisition long-lasting immunity to
certain chronic infections, malaria hiv. here, generated an
immunoglobulin heavy chain knock-in mouse bcr recognizes msp1 
rodent malaria parasite, plasmodium chabaudi. combination a
mosquito-initiated p. chabaudi infection, show plasmodium-specific
atypical memory b cells short-lived disappear upon natural resolution 
chronic infection. cells show features activation, proliferation, dna
replication, plasmablasts. data demonstrate plasmodium-specific
atypical memory b cells subset long-lived memory b cells, rather
short-lived activated cells, part physiologic ongoing b-cell response.
