insecticide resistance mosquito populations threatens recent successes in
malaria prevention. elucidating patterns genetic structure malaria vectors 
to predict speed direction spread resistance essential to
get ahead 'resistance curve' avert public health catastrophe.
here, applying combination microsatellite analysis, whole genome sequencing 
and targeted sequencing resistance locus, elucidated continent-wide
population structure major african malaria vector, anopheles funestus. we
identified major selective sweep genomic region controlling cytochrome
p450-based metabolic resistance conferring high resistance pyrethroids. this
selective sweep occurred since 2002, likely direct consequence scaled 
vector control revealed whole genome fine-scale sequencing pre- 
post-intervention populations. fine-scaled analysis pyrethroid resistance 
locus revealed resistance-associated allele cytochrome p450
monooxygenase cyp6p9a swept southern africa near fixation, in
contrast high polymorphism levels interventions, conferring high levels
of pyrethroid resistance linked control failure. population structure analysis
revealed barrier gene flow southern africa areas, which
may prevent slow spread southern mechanism pyrethroid resistance
to regions. identifying genetic signature pyrethroid-based
interventions, demonstrated intense selective pressure control
interventions exert mosquito populations. level selection and
spread resistance continues unabated, ability control malaria with
current interventions compromised.
