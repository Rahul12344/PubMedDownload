the ability introduce genetic constructs choice genome of
anopheles mosquitoes provides valuable tool study molecular interactions
between plasmodium parasite insect host. long term, this
technology could potentially offer new ways control vector-borne diseases
through suppression target mosquito populations the
introgression traits preclude pathogen transmission. here, describe in
detail protocols generation transgenic anopheles gambiae mosquitoes
based germ-line transformation using either modified transposable elements 
the site-specific phic31 recombinase.
