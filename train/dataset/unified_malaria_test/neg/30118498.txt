objective: assessed association mutant allele frequencies nitric
oxide synthase 2 (nos2) gene two snps (-954 -1173) malaria disease
severity children malaria endemic area southern ghana.
method: using children recruited hospital, assigned clinical
subgroups uncomplicated severe malaria matching "healthy
control" counterparts, designed case control study. genomic dna was
extracted genotyping using restriction fragment polymorphism done.
result: total 123 malaria cases (91 uncomplicated, 32 severe) 100
controls sampled. corresponding mean hbs 9.6, 9.3 11.2g/dl
and geometric mean parasite densities 32097, 193252 0 parasites/ml
respectively. variant allele frequencies varied 0.09 0.03 0.12
for g-954c 0.06 0.03 0.07 c-1173t uncomplicated, severe
and healthy control groups respectively. strong linkage
disequilibrium two alleles (p<0.001). -954 position, odds
of developing severe malaria found 2.5 times lower carriage of
a c allele compared without severe malaria (Ï‡2; p< 0.05) though this
isn't case -1173.
conclusion: carriage mutant allele -954 nos2 gene may a
protective effect malaria among southern ghanaian children.
