aedes aegypti major vector number arboviruses cause disease
in humans. without vaccines pharmaceuticals, pyrethroid insecticides remain
the major tool public health protection. pyrethroid resistance now
widespread. replacement substitutions voltage-gated sodium channel (vgsc) 
that reduce stability pyrethroid binding account the
resistance, metabolic mechanisms also inactivate pyrethroids. high-throughput
sequencing a. aegypti l5 annotated physical map allowed interrogation
of exome genes single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with
pyrethroid resistance. exposed females a. aegypti mexico a
deltamethrin discriminating dose designate resistant (active after
1 h) susceptible (knocked recovery 4 h). vgsc on
chromosome 3 highest association, followed genes proximal vgsc. 
identified potential detoxification genes located singly (eg hpx8c) within
clusters chromosome 2 [three esterase clusters, two cytochrome p450
monooxygenases (cyp)] chromosome 3 (one cluster 16 cyp325 seven cyp9
genes). deltamethrin resistance a. aegypti associated mutations the
vgsc gene large assortment genes.
