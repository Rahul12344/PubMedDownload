plasmodium falciparum, one deadliest parasites earth causes human
malaria resulting one million deaths annually. central parasite
pathogenicity morbidity switching parasite virulence (var) gene
expression causing host immune evasion. regulation plasmodium var gene
expression poorly understood. complex life cycle plasmodium and
mutually exclusive expression pattern var genes make disease difficult to
control. recent studies demonstrated pivotal role epigenetic
mechanism control coordinated expression var genes, important for
various clinical manifestations malaria. review, discuss about
different plasmodium histones various modifications important gene 
expression gene repression.contribution epigenetic mechanism understand
the var gene expression also highlighted. also describe details p.
falciparum nuclear architecture including heterochromatin, euchromatin and
telomeric regions importance subtelomeric centrally located var 
gene expression. finally, explore possibility using histone acetyl
transferase (hat) histone deacetylase (hdac)inhibitors multi-drug
resistance malaria parasites provide another line treatment malaria.
