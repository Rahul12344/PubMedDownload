apicomplexan parasites express various calcium-dependent protein kinases (cdpks),
and play essential roles invasion egress. five six
cdpks conserved apicomplexa studied molecular and
cellular levels plasmodium species and/or toxoplasma gondii parasites, 
the function cdpk7 far uncharacterized. t. gondii, during
intracellular replication, two parasites formed within mother cell 
a unique process called endodyogeny. demonstrate knock-down of
cdpk7 protein t. gondii results pronounced defects parasite division and
a major growth deficiency, dispensable motility, egress and
microneme exocytosis. cdpk7-depleted parasites, overall dna content was
not impaired, polarity daughter cells budding fate several 
subcellular structures proteins involved cell division affected, 
as centrosomes kinetochore. overall, data suggest cdpk7 is
crucial proper maintenance centrosome integrity required the
initiation endodyogeny. findings provide first insight probable
role calcium-dependent signalling parasite multiplication, addition to
its widely explored role invasion egress.
