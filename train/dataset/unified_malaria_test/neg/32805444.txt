atractylodin β-eudesmol major active ingredients atractylodes
lancea (thunb) dc. (al). compounds exhibit various pharmacological
activities, including anticancer activity cholangiocarcinoma. despite the
widespread use plant traditional medicine china, japan, korea, 
thailand, studies toxicological profiles limited. present study 
aimed evaluate embryotoxicity atractylodin β-eudesmol using the
zebrafish model. zebrafish embryos exposed series concentrations
(6.3, 12.5, 25, 50, 100 μm) compound 72 h post-fertilization
(hpf). results showed atractylodin β-eudesmol induced mortality of
zebrafish embryos 50% lethal concentration (lc50) 36.8 53.0 μm,
respectively. compounds also caused embryonic deformities, including
pericardial edema, malformed head, yolk sac edema, truncated body. only
β-eudesmol decreased hatching rates, atractylodin reduced heart
rates zebrafish embryos. additionally, compounds increased reactive
oxygen species (ros) production altered transcriptional expression levels
of superoxide dismutase 1 (sod1), catalase (cat), glutathione s-transferase
pi 2 (gstp2) genes. conclusion, atractylodin β-eudesmol induce mortality, 
developmental toxicity, oxidative stress zebrafish embryos. findings
may imply similar toxicity compounds humans.
