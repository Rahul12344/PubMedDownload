osteolysis osteolytic lesion featured enhanced osteoclast formation 
potent bone erosion. lacking effective regimen treatment the
pathological process highlights importance identifying agents can
suppress differentiation function osteoclast. artemether natural 
compound derived artemisia annua l. popularized treatment 
of malaria. present study, demonstrated artemether could suppress
rankl-induced osteoclastogenesis expression osteoclast marker genes such
as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, cathepsin k, matrix metalloproteinase 9, 
nuclear factor activated t-cell cytoplasmic 1, dendritic cell-specific
transmembrane protein. inhibited osteoclastic bone resorption a
dose-dependent manner vitro. furthermore, artemether attenuated rankl-induced 
mapks (erk, jnk, p-38) activity. addition, showed artemether 
able mitigate bone erosion aÂ murine model lps-induced inflammatory bone 
loss. taken together, findings suggest artemether reduces inflammatory
bone loss via inhibition mapks activation osteoclast differentiation,
and might potential candidate treatment osteoclast-related
disorders.
