introduction: self-amplifying mrna vaccines developed platform
technology potential used broad range targets. synthetic 
production methods manufacture, combined modern tools of
bioinformatics synthetic biology, enable vaccines produced
rapidly electronic gene sequence. preclinical proof concept far
been achieved influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rabies, ebola,
cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus malaria.
areas covered: editorial highlights key milestones discovery 
development self-amplifying mrna vaccines, reviews might used 
as rapid response platform. paper points future improvements rna
vector design non-viral delivery may lead decreases effective dose 
increases production capacity.
expert opinion: prospects non-viral delivery self-amplifying mrna
vaccines promising. like types nucleic acid vaccines, these
vaccines potential draw positive attributes live-attenuated
vaccines obviating many potential safety limitations. hence, approach 
could enable concept vaccines demand rapid response real
threat rather deployment strategic stockpiles based on
epidemiological predictions possible threats.
