background: planning evaluating malaria control strategies relies accurate
definition parasite prevalence population. large proportion of
asymptomatic parasite infections identified surveillance with
molecular methods, yet infections also contribute onward transmission to
mosquitoes. sensitivity molecular detection pcr limited the
abundance target sequence dna sample; thus, detection becomes
imperfect low densities. aimed increase pcr diagnostic sensitivity by
targeting multi-copy genomic sequences reliable detection low-density
infections, investigated impact pcr assays community
prevalence data.
methods findings: two quantitative pcr (qpcr) assays developed for
ultra-sensitive detection plasmodium falciparum, targeting high-copy
telomere-associated repetitive element 2 (tare-2, ∼250 copies/genome) var
gene acidic terminal sequence (varats, 59 copies/genome). assays reached a
limit detection 0.03 0.15 parasites/μl blood 10× sensitive
than standard 18s rrna qpcr. population cross-sectional study tanzania,
295/498 samples tested positive using ultra-sensitive assays. light microscopy
missed 169 infections (57%). 18s rrna qpcr failed identify 48 infections
(16%), 40% carried gametocytes detected pfs25 quantitative
reverse-transcription pcr. judge suitability tare-2 varats
assays high-throughput screens, performance tested sample pools.
both ultra-sensitive assays correctly detected pools containing one
low-density p. falciparum-positive sample, went undetected 18s rrna
qpcr, among nine negatives. tare-2 varats qpcrs improve estimates of
prevalence rates, yet infections might still remain undetected absent 
in limited blood volume sampled.
conclusions: measured malaria prevalence communities largely determined 
the sensitivity diagnostic tool used. even applying standard
molecular diagnostics, prevalence study population underestimated by
8% compared new assays. findings highlight need highly
sensitive tools tare-2 varats qpcr community surveillance 
monitoring interventions better describe malaria epidemiology inform
malaria elimination efforts.
