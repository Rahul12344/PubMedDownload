malaria infection induces, alongside endothelial damage obstruction hypoxia, 
a potent inflammatory response similar observed systemic
diseases caused bacteria viruses. accordingly, increasingly
recognised cerebral malaria (cm), severe life threatening
complication plasmodium falciparum infection, bears number similarities
with sepsis, often fatal condition associated misregulated inflammatory
response triggered systemic microbial infections. using plasmodium berghei
anka mouse model, histology, immunohistochemistry gene expression analysis,
we showed lipopolysaccharide (lps), doses normally induce
inflammation tolerance, protects p. berghei infected mice experimental cm
(ecm). vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) preserved blood vessel
integrity, combination lps resulted strong synergistic effect. 
treated mice develop ecm, showed prolonged survival failed to
develop significant inflammatory response splenomegaly spite normal
parasite loads. protective role vegf confirmed the
observation treatment p. berghei infected c57bl/6 balb/c mice
with vegf receptor inhibitor axitinib exacerbates cerebral pathology and
aggravates course infection. infected mice treated vegf lps
showed induction anti-inflammatory genes nrf2 ho-1 a
suppression basal levels genes ifn-γ tnf-α. results provide
the rationale developing new therapeutic approaches cm shed new
light inflammatory process modulated presence of
systemic infectious diseases.
