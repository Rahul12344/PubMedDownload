identification genomic regions identical descent (ibd) proven 
useful human genetic studies analyses led discovery of
familial relatedness fine-mapping disease critical regions. unfortunately 
however, ibd analyses underutilized analysis organisms,
including human pathogens. part due lack statistical
methodologies non-diploid genomes addition added complexity of
multiclonal infections. such, developed ibd methodology, called
isorelate, analysis haploid recombining microorganisms presence 
multiclonal infections. using inferred ibd status genomic locations, we
have also developed novel statistic identifying loci positive
selection propose relatedness networks means exploring shared
haplotypes within populations. evaluate performance methodologies
for detecting ibd selection, including comparisons existing tools, 
perform exploratory analysis whole genome sequencing data global
plasmodium falciparum dataset 2500 genomes. analysis identifies
southeast asia many highly related isolates, possibly result of
both reduced transmission intensified control efforts population
bottlenecks following emergence antimalarial drug resistance. many signals
of selection also identified, overlap genes known to
be associated drug resistance, addition two novel signals observed 
multiple countries yet explored detail. additionally, we
investigate relatedness networks selected loci determine one of
these sweeps spread continents arisen
independently different countries. ibd analysis microorganisms using
isorelate used exploring population structure, positive selection 
haplotype distributions, valuable tool monitoring disease
control elimination efforts many diseases.
