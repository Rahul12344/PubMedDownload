anopheles (cellia) stephensi liston 1901 known asian malaria vector.
three biological forms, namely "mysorensis", "intermediate", "type" been
earlier reported species. nevertheless, present morphological and
molecular information insufficient diagnose forms. this
investigation, an. stephensi biological forms morphologically identified and
sequenced odorant-binding protein 1 (obp1) gene. also, intron sequences
were used construct phylogenetic trees. despite nucleotide sequence variation 
in exon asteobp1, nearly 100% identity observed amino acid level
among three biological forms. order overcome difficulties using egg 
morphology characters, intron sequences an. stephensi obp1 opens new
molecular way identification main asian malaria vector biological
forms. however, multidisciplinary studies needed establish taxonomic
status an. stephensi.
