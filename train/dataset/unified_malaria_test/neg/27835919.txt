the camp-dependent protein kinase pka well-characterized member the
serine-threonine protein agc kinase family effector kinase camp
signaling. such, pka involved control wide variety cellular 
processes including metabolism, cell growth, gene expression apoptosis.
camp-dependent pka signaling pathways play important roles infection and
virulence various pathogens. since fluxes camp involved multiple
intracellular functions, variety different pathological infectious processes
can affected pka signaling pathways. here, highlight features of
camp-pka signaling relevant plasmodium falciparum-infection of
erythrocytes present update akap targeting pka pge2 signaling via
ep4 theileria annulata-infection leukocytes discuss camp-pka signling
in toxoplasma.
