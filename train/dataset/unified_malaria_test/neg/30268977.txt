background: antigens (or epitopes)-carrier protein combinations are
extensively utilized vaccine development strategies. chemical conjugation
methods cumbersome limited conjugation sites. computational protein
modelling methods evaluate every position carrier protein for
conjugation via epitope grafting reasonable time frame compared wet
experimental techniques. graftibility positions estimated the
presence native atomic contacts resulting chimeric antigen.
methodology: five epitopes selected, computational grafting each
position performed three templates serum albumin. protein modelling
algorithms segment matching satisfaction spatial restraints were
employed computational grafting. contact-based protein discriminatory
function used evaluate chimeric proteins native atomic
contacts.
results: evaluation approximately 1 million distinct protein modelling 
simulations, region around 450th position serum albumin observed be
suitable epitope grafting.
conclusion: computational protein modelling tools may used design a
chimeric antigen. approach may overcome limitations associated with
chemical conjugation furthermore harness potential custom gene
synthesis/recombinant protein production.
