we describe microsporidian parasite infecting non-native chinese mitten crabs
(eriochier sinensis) europe. electron microscopy revealed merogonic and
sporogonic life stages bound within plasmalemma. crab parasite develops
polar tube precursors sporont stage complete formation the
intact spore extrusion apparatus stage sporogonial plasmodium like 
enterocytozoon bienuesi representatives enterocytozoonidae. 
presence within aquatic crustacean host, distinct molecular phylogeny
based partial small subunit ribosomal rna (ssu rrna) gene sequences also place
it relatively close, though distinct to, existing genera within the
enterocytozoonidae. consideration morphological phylogenetic
characteristics hepatopancreas-infecting microsporidia crustaceans 
suggests certain ones (e.g. enterospora canceri) retained within the
clade corresponding existing family enterocytozoonidae, others,
including parasite described here, may eventually grouped sister
taxon potentially family rank. based upon morphological host similarity,
it likely parasite described endoreticulatus
eriocheir (wang chen, 2007), previously described chinese mitten crabs
in asia. however, using combined taxonomic approach based upon morphological
and phylogenetic data, propose formation new genus (hepatospora) to
replace previous generic classification asian parasite as
endoreticulatus. microsporidian hepatopancreas e. sinensis is
named hepatospora eriocheir (wang chen, 2007) gen. et comb. nov. is
assumed parasite introduced initial invasions crab to
europe early 20th century.
