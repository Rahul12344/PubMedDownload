increasing evidence critically implicates mirnas pathogenesis diseases,
but little known context infectious diseases. study investigates 
as whether testosterone-induced persistent susceptibility blood-stage
malaria plasmodium chabaudi coincides changes mirna expression 
anti-malaria effectors sites spleen liver. female c57bl/6 mice treated
with vehicle testosterone (t) 3 weeks. then, treatment discontinued 
for 12 weeks challenge 10(6) p. chabaudi-parasitized erythrocytes.
the mirna expression examined 12 weeks withdrawal during
infections peak parasitemia day 8 p.i. using mirxploreâ„¢ microarray
technology. p. chabaudi infections induce organ-specific response mirna
expression. identify 25 mirna species downregulated than
2-fold spleen 169 mirna species liver. among 194 mirna
species, 12 common mirna species downregulated by
0.48-0.14-fold spleen liver, mir-194, mir-192, mir-193a-3p,
mir-145, mir-16, mir-99a, mir-99b, mir-15a, mir-152, let-7g, let-7b, and
mir-455-3p. liver, upregulation mir-142-5p by
2.5-fold mir-342-3p 5.1-fold. 12 weeks withdrawal, spleen
exhibits mir-200a upregulated 2.7-fold. liver,
mir-376b, mir-493*, mir-188-3p upregulated 2.4-fold, 2.2-fold, and
2.1-fold, respectively, mir-347, mir-200a, mir-200b downregulated 
approximately 0.4-fold. upon infection, however, changes sustained,
i.e., mirna expressions spleen liver t-pretreated mice exhibit
the response p. chabaudi malaria vehicle-treated control mice.
our data suggest (1) p. chabaudi-induced downregulation mirna
expression spleen liver required allow upregulation their
numerous target genes response infection, (2) t-induced
persistent susceptibility p. chabaudi affect responsiveness of
mirna expression spleen liver blood-stage malaria.
