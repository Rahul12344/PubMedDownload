background: inherited red blood cell disorders prevalent populations
living malaria endemic areas; g6pd deficiency associated with
oxidant-induced haemolysis abnormal haemoglobin variants may cause chronic
anaemia. pregnant women, microcytic anaemia caused haemoglobinopathies
mimics iron deficiency, complicating diagnosis treatment. anaemia during
pregnancy associated morbidity mortality. aim study was
to characterise prevalence g6pd deficiency haemoglobinopathies Â among 
the pregnant population living along thailand-myanmar border. pregnant women 
attending antenatal clinics area belong several distinct ethnic
groups. methods: data available 13,520 women attending antenatal care
between july 2012 september 2016. screening g6pd deficiency done by
fluorescent spot test routinely. g6pd genotyping quantitative phenotyping 
spectrophotometry analysed subsample women. haemoglobin variants
were diagnosed hplc capillary electrophoresis molecular methods. the
prevalence distribution inherited red blood cell disorders analysed
with respect ethnicity. results: g6pd deficiency common, especially the
sgaw karen ethnic group, g6pd mahidol variant allele frequency was
20.7%. quantitative g6pd phenotyping showed 60.5% heterozygous women 
an intermediate enzymatic activity 30% 70% population median. 
hbe, beta-thalassaemia trait hb constant spring found overall 15.6%
of women. 45.2% women low percentage hba 2 carriers of
mutations alpha globin genes. conclusions: distribution g6pd and
haemoglobin variants varied among different ethnic groups, prevalence
was generally high throughout cohort. findings encourage the
implementation extended program information genetic counselling to
women reproductive age help inform future studies current
clinical management anaemia pregnant population region.
