objective: construct recombinant plasmid psppcgt contains signal peptide
peptidase gene plasmodium falciparum (pjspp) gfp, transfect p.
falciparum (3d7 strain) obtain mutant parasites express pjspp-gfp.
methods: plasmodium falciparum(3d7 strain) genomic dna extracted from
cultured malaria parasites. c-terminal region pjspp, 883 bp gene
fragment amplified pcr, cloned ppm2gt vector get
recombinant vector psppcgt. recombinant vectors identified pcr,
double restriction enzyme digestion dna sequencing. psppcgt vector was
transfected malaria parasites. positive clones selected adding
inhibitor plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase wr99210 culture
medium. pspp-gfp-transfected parasites fixed methanol, stained with
dapi, observed immunofluorescence microscope. pjspp-gfp expression 
in p. falciparum identified sds-page western blotting.
results: c-terminal region pjspp amplified p.falciparum (3d7
strain) genomic dna pcr length 883 bp. constructed recombinant
vectors identified pcr screening, double restriction enzyme digestion and
dna sequencing. psppcgt vector transfected p. falciparum the
positive clones selected wr99210. gfp fluorescence observed in
transfected parasites immunofluorescence microscopy, mainly located the
cytoplasm. pjspp-gfp expression malaria parasites confirmed western
blotting relative molecular mass mr 64,000.
conclusion: recombinant vector pjspp-gfp constructed transfected p.
falciparum obtain p. falciparum mutant clone express pfspp-gfp.
