genetic manipulation plasmodium falciparum culture transfection has
provided numerous insights molecular cell biology parasite. 
the procedure rather cumbersome, limited number of
drug-resistant markers used selecting transfected parasites. here
we report new selectable marker could allow multiple transfections. we
have taken advantage finding critical function mitochondrial
electron transport chain (mtetc) erythrocytic stages p. falciparum is
the regeneration ubiquinone co-substrate dihydroorotate dehydrogenase
(dhodh), transgenic p. falciparum expressing ubiquinone-independent
dhodh yeast (ydhodh) resistant mtetc inhibitors. assessed 
possibility using ydhodh positive selectable marker transfections 
p. falciparum, including use gene disruption strategies. constructed 
transfection vector designed gene disruption, termed puf-1, containing the
ydhodh gene positive selection marker combination previously
described fused yeast cytosine deaminase-uracil phosphoribosyl transferase gene
as negative selection marker. transfection d10 strain followed by
selection atovaquone yielded positively selected parasites containing the
plasmid, demonstrating ydhodh used selective marker. atovaquone,
however, could used selection dd2 strain p.
falciparum. hand, demonstrated ydhodh transgenic parasites
could selected strains plasmodium dhodh-specific
triazolopyrimidine-based inhibitors. thus, selection dhodh inhibitors was
superior successfully selected transgenic dd2 parasites, well as
yielded transgenic parasites shorter period selection. proof of
concept, successfully disrupted type ii vacuolar proton-pumping
pyrophosphatase gene (pfvp2) p. falciparum double crossover recombination, 
showing gene essential survival blood stage
parasites.
