in erythrocytes, actively multiplying plasmodium falciparum parasites exhibit a
unique signature virulence associated histone modifications, thereby
epigenetically regulating expression majority genes. histone
acetylation one modification, effectuated maintained dynamic
interplay two functionally antagonist enzymes, histone acetyltransferases
(hats) histone deacetylases (hdacs). inhibition leads to
hypo/hyperacetylation known deleterious p. falciparum, hence
they become attractive molecular targets design novel antimalarials. many
compounds, including four food drug administration (fda) approved drugs, have
been developed far inhibit hdac activity suitable treat
malaria lack selectivity cause cytotoxicity mammalian cells. in
this study, used comparative modeling molecular docking establish
different binding modes nonselective selective compounds pfhdac-1
(a class hdac protein p. falciparum) active site identified the
involvement active site nonidentical residues binding selective
compounds. further, applied virtual screening precise selection
criteria molecular dynamics simulation identify novel potential inhibitors
against pfhdac-1. report 20 compounds (10 chembl 10 analogues
compound library) bearing seven scaffolds better affinity toward pfhdac-1.
sixteen compounds known antimalarials 14 activity the
nanomolar range various drug resistant sensitive strains p.
falciparum. cytotoxicity compounds various human cell lines 
are reported relatively higher concentration hence used as
potential pfhdac-1 inhibitors p. falciparum. findings indeed show great 
potential using molecules prospective antimalarials.
