platelet factor 4 (pf4) anti-plasmodium component platelets. is
expressed megakaryocytes released platelets following infection 
plasmodium innate immunity crucial host anti-plasmodium response, in
which type interferon plays important role. whether cross-talk
between innate immune signaling production anti-plasmodium defense
peptides unknown. demonstrate e74, like ets transcription factor 
4 (elf4), type interferon activator, help protect host from
plasmodium yoelii infection. mechanically, elf4 binds promoter genes of
two c-x-c chemokines, pf4 pro-platelet basic protein (ppbp), initiating the
transcription two genes, thereby enhancing pf4-mediated killing of
parasites infected erythrocytes. elf4 -/- mice much susceptible 
plasmodium infection wt littermates. expression level pf4 ppbp in
megakaryocytes elf4 -/- mice much lower control
animals, resulting increased parasitemia. conclusion, study uncovered a
distinct role elf4, innate immune molecule, host defense against
malaria.
