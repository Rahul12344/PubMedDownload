background: anopheles sacharovi dominant malaria vector species south
europe middle east highly plastic behaviour adult and
larval stages. plasticity prevented species eradication by
several anti-vector campaigns. development new genome-based strategies for
vector control benefit genome sequencing physical chromosome
mapping mosquito. although cytogenetic photomap chromosomes from
salivary glands an. sacharovi developed, cytogenetic map suitable 
for physical genome mapping available.
methods: mosquitoes study collected adult stage animal
shelters armenia. polytene chromosome preparations prepared ovarian 
nurse cells. fluorescent situ hybridization (fish) performed using pcr
amplified probes.
results: study constructed high-quality standard photomap polytene
chromosomes ovarian nurse cells an. sacharovi. following previous
nomenclature, chromosomes sub-divided 39 numbered 119 lettered
sub-divisions. chromosomal landmarks chromosome recognition were
described. using fish, 4 pcr-amplified genic probes mapped the
chromosomes. positions probes demonstrated gene order reshuffling
between an. sacharovi anopheles atroparvus seen
cytologically. addition, study described specific chromosomal landmarks
that used cytotaxonomic diagnostics an. sacharovi based 
banding pattern polytene chromosomes.
conclusions: study constructed high-quality standard photomap ovarian 
nurse cell chromosomes an. sacharovi validated utility physical
genome mapping. based map, cytotaxonomic features identification of
an. sacharovi described. cytogenetic map constructed study 
will assist creating chromosome-based genome assembly mosquito 
in developing cytotaxonomic tools identification species the
maculipennis group.
