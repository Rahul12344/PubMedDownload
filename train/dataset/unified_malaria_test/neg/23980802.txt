plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites export protein pfemp1 surface 
of infected erythrocytes, enabling adhere receptors the
microvasculature thereby avoid clearance spleen. gene var2csa
encodes form pfemp1 binds specifically within placenta, causing
pregnancy-associated malaria, appears expressed absence a
placenta. previously described upstream open reading frame (uorf) is
responsible repression translation downstream orf (dorf) that
encodes var2csa, thus keeping gene silent parasites infect non-pregnant 
individuals. elucidate molecular mechanism repression is
overcome pregnancy, stably transformed parasites reporter gene
constructs designed detect switches efficiency dorf translation. 
found proper regulation switching relies two separate components, (i) 
active translation uorf (ii) sequence-specific characteristics 
surrounding transcript, together control ability ribosome
complex reinitiate second round translation thus express var2csa.
these results provide first details molecular switch allows
parasites take advantage unique niche provided placenta.
