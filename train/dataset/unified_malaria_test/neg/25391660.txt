the plasmodium falciparum protein translation enzymes aminoacyl-trna synthetases 
(aarss) emergent family drug targets. aars ensemble catalyses
transfer amino acids cognate trnas, thus providing charged trnas for
ribosomal consumption. p. falciparum proteome expression relies total 36 
aarss three translationally independent compartments cytoplasm,
apicoplast mitochondria. present study, show that, set of
36, single genomic copy mitochondrial phenylalanyl-trna synthetase (mfrs) is
targeted parasite mitochondria, mfrs gene exclusive to
malaria parasites within apicomplexan phyla. protein cellular
localization studies based immunofluorescence data show that, along mfrs,
p. falciparum harbours two phenylalanyl-trna synthetase (frs) assemblies
that localized apicoplast cytoplasm. 'extra' mfrs found 
mitochondria asexual blood stage parasites competent in
aminoacylation. show parasite mitochondria import trnas 
the cytoplasmic trna pool. hence drug targeting frss presents unique
opportunity potentially stall protein production three parasite
translational compartments.
