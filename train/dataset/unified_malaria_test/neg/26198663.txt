the malarial parasite plasmodium falciparum exposed substantial redox
challenges complex life cycle. intraerythrocytic parasites,
haemoglobin breakdown major source reactive oxygen species. deficiencies 
in human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, initial enzyme pentose
phosphate pathway (ppp), lead disturbed redox equilibrium infected
erythrocytes partial protection severe malaria. p. falciparum, the
first two reactions ppp catalysed bifunctional enzyme
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconolactonase (pfglupho). this
enzyme differs structurally human counterparts represents a
potential target drugs. present study used epitope tagging of
endogenous pfglupho verify enzyme localises parasite cytosol. 
furthermore, attempted double crossover disruption pfglupho gene indicates
that enzyme essential growth blood stage parasites. a
further step towards targeting pfglupho pharmacologically, ellagic acid was
characterised potent pfglupho inhibitor ic50 76 nm.
interestingly, pro-oxidative drugs treatment parasites h2o2 only
slightly altered pfglupho expression activity conditions tested.
furthermore, metabolic profiling suggested pro-oxidative drugs not
significantly perturb abundance ppp intermediates. data indicate
that pfglupho essential asexual parasites, oxidative arm of
the ppp strongly regulated response oxidative challenge.
