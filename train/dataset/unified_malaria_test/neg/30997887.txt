background & objectives: plasmodium parasite harbours unique methylerythritol
phosphate (mep) pathway obligatory biosynthesis isoprenoids. 
in malaria parasites, isoprenoids indispensable hepatic,
erythrocytic gametocytic stages. owing criticality mep pathway 
the potential enzymes act antimalarial drug target, study
comprehensively investigated genetic diversity structural composition 
4-diphosphocytidyl-2c-methyl-d-erythritol kinase (ispe), fourth enzyme mep
pathway indian plasmodium falciparum (pfispe).
methods: study employed sequencing, modeling bioinformatics approaches to
examine genetic diversity associated structural polymorphism the
pfispe gene amplified clinical blood samples collected seven
malaria endemic geographical regions india.
results: sequence analysis showed pfispe gene highly conserved with
100% sequence identity among p. falciparum indian isolates well as
with pfispe gene reference strain 3d7. phylogenetic analysis suggested
that pfispe highly evolved differ sufficiently human orthologue
mevalonate kinase gene. structural modeling studies revealed pfispe has
conserved atp cdpme-binding domains. active site observed be
relatively rigid architecture >60% Î²-pleated sheets.
interpretation & conclusion: results genetic, phylogeny modeling
studies strengthen potential pfispe enzyme promising antimalarial
drug target.
