plasmodium vivax resistance chloroquine (cq) first reported 60 years 
ago. analyzed sequence variations multidrug resistance 1 gene
(pvmdr1), putative molecular marker p. vivax cq resistance, field
isolates collected three sites thailand 2013-2016. several single 
nucleotide polymorphisms previously implicated reduced cq sensitivity were
found. genetic variations encode amino acids two nucleotide-binding 
domains well transmembrane domains protein. high level of
genetic diversity pvmdr1 provides insights evolutionary history of
this gene. specifically, little evidence positive selection amino
acid f1076l global isolates promoted possible marker cq
resistance. population genetic analysis clearly divided parasites into
eastern western populations, consistent geographical
separation central malaria-free area thailand. cq-primaquine
remaining frontline treatment vivax malaria regions of
thailand, population subdivision could shaped affected the
current drugs p. falciparum since mixed p. falciparum/p. vivax infections
often occur region.
