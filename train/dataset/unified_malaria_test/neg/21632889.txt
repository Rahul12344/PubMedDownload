recombinant plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 3 (pfmsp3f) a
24-kda fragment n terminus (msp3n) includes essential conserved
domain, elicits maximum antibody (ab)-dependent cellular inhibition
(adci), expressed soluble proteins escherichia coli. proteins
were found stable soluble lyophilized forms. immunization 
msp3f msp3n formulated separately two human-compatible adjuvants,
aluminum hydroxide (alhydrogel) montanide isa 720, produced significant
antibody responses mice rabbits. polyclonal abs antigens
recognized native msp3 parasite lysate. two abs also recognized two 
synthetic peptides, previously characterized possess b cell epitopes 
n-terminal region. antibody depletion assay showed igg response 
is directed toward n-terminal region full protein. anti-msp3f and
anti-msp3n rabbit antibodies inhibit merozoite invasion or
intraerythrocytic development significantly reduced parasitemia the
presence human monocytes. adci demonstrated anti-msp3n antibodies was
comparable exhibited anti-msp3f antibodies (both generated rabbit).
these results suggest n-terminal fragment msp3 considered a
vaccine candidate form part multigenic vaccine malaria.
