the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum modifies erythrocyte it
infects exporting variant proteins host cell surface. var gene
family codes large, variant adhesive surface protein called p.
falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1) plays particular role in
this process, linked pathogenesis immune evasion. single member
of gene family highly transcribed 59 members remain
silenced. importantly, var gene transcription occurs spatially restricted,
but yet undefined, perinuclear site distinct repressed var gene
clusters. advance understanding monoallelic expression, investigated
whether nuclear pores associate var gene expression site. end,
we studied nuclear pore organization asexual blood stage using a
specific antibody directed subunit nuclear pore, p. falciparum
nup116 (pfnup116). ring schizont stage parasites showed highly polarized
nuclear pore foci, whereas trophozoite stage nuclear pores redistributed 
the entire nuclear surface. colocalization studies var transcripts and
anti-pfnup116 antibodies showed clear dissociation nuclear pores 
var gene expression site ring stage. similar results obtained another
differentially transcribed perinuclear gene family, ribosomal dna units.
furthermore, show poised state, var gene locus not
physically linked nuclear pores. results indicate p. falciparum 
form compartments high transcriptional activity nuclear periphery which
are, unlike case yeast, devoid nuclear pores.
