in cases human malaria, children suffer high rates morbidity and
mortality. analyse mechanisms involved age-dependent protection against
malaria, investigated characterization immune responses plasmodium
yoelii 17xnl (p.y 17xnl) young (3 weeks) middle-aged (8 months) c57bl/6
mice. study, found 100% young mice succumbed p.y 17xnl
infection higher parasitemia, middle-aged mice able clear
blood parasites mortality observed. observations suggested 
the young c57bl/6 mice susceptible p.y 17xnl infection, whereas the
middle-aged mice resistant. cellular analysis revealed numbers
of splenic myeloid dendritic cells (mdcs) well expression dc
maturation markers higher middle-aged mice young mice. 
numbers igg1- igg2a-secreting b cells increased markedly middle-aged
mice infection p.y 17xnl. dynamic change number of
cd4+cd25+foxp3+ regulatory cells (tregs) mice infected p.y 17xnl was
also different two groups. addition, levels ifn-gamma and
no increased groups early parasite infection, also
an obvious increase il-4 production infected middle-aged mice. the
