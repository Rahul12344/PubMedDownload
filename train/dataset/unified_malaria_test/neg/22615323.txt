background: dendritic cells (dcs) highly specialized antigen-presenting cells
that crucial initiation immune responses. naturally acquired
malaria, dc number function reduced.
methods: timing of, parasitemia threshold of, contribution apoptosis
to dc loss prospectively evaluated 10 men experimental challenge
with approximately 1800 plasmodium falciparum-parasitized red blood cells (prbcs)
and drug cure initiated parasite level â‰¥ 1000 parasites/ml.
results: nadir levels total, myeloid, plasmacytoid dcs occurred 8 days
after infection. dc loss partially attributable apoptosis, first
detected day 5 (median parasite level, 238 parasites/ml) maximal day 7.
remaining dcs exhibited reduced ability uptake particulate antigen. dc
numbers recovered approximately 60 hours antimalarial drug administration. 
there loss dc number function drug cure 5 men
inoculated <180 prbcs treated day 6, parasite level was
approximately 200 parasites/ml.
conclusions: plasmodium causes dc loss vivo, least partially
explained apoptosis response blood-stage parasites. primary
infection, loss dc number function occurs early prepatent
period onset clinical symptoms. findings may explain 
in part inadequate development immunity blood-stage malaria infection.
