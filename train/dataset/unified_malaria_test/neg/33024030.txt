merozoites formed asexual division malaria parasite invade host 
red blood cells (rbcs), critical initiating malaria infection. the
process invasion involves specialized organelles like micronemes rhoptries
that discharge key proteins involved interaction host rbc receptors.
rhoph complex comprises least three proteins, include rhoph3. rhoph3 
critical process red blood cell (rbc) invasion well as
intraerythrocytic development human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum 
is phosphorylated serine 804 (s804) parasite; however, unclear if
phosphorylation regulates function. address this, crispr-cas9-based
approach used mutate s804 alanine (a) p. falciparum using this
phosphomutant (r3_s804a) rhoph3, demonstrate phosphorylation of
s804 critical host rbc invasion parasite its
intraerythrocytic development. importantly, phosphorylation rhoph3
regulates localization rhoptries discharge parasite,
which critical rbc invasion. also identified p. falciparum cdpk1
(pfcdpk1) possible candidate kinase rhoph3-s804 phosphorylation and
found regulates rhoph3 secretion parasite. findings
provide novel insights role phosphorylation rhoptry release and
invasion, poorly understood.importance host cell invasion malaria
parasite critical establishing infection human host dependent on
discharge key ligands organelles like rhoptry microneme, these
ligands interact host rbc receptors. present study, demonstrate
that phosphorylation key rhoptry protein, rhoph3, critical host
invasion. phosphorylation regulates localization rhoptries discharge
from parasite.
