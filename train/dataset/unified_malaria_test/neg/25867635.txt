vector mosquitoes inflict human suffering organism-and kill
more one million people year. mosquito genome projects facilitated 
research new facets mosquito biology, including functional genetic studies 
in primary african malaria vector anopheles gambiae dengue yellow
fever vector aedes aegypti. rna interference- (rnai-) mediated gene silencing has
been used target genes interest disease vector mosquito
species. here, describe procedure preparation chitosan/interfering
rna nanoparticles combined food ingested larvae. this
technically straightforward, high-throughput, relatively inexpensive
methodology, compatible long double stranded rna (dsrna) small
interfering rna (sirna) molecules, used successful knockdown 
a number different genes a. gambiae a. aegypti larvae. following larval
feedings, knockdown, verified qrt-pcr situ hybridization, 
can persist least late pupal stage. methodology may be
applicable wide variety mosquito insect species, including
agricultural pests, well non-model organisms. addition its
utility research laboratory, future, chitosan, inexpensive,
non-toxic biodegradable polymer, could potentially utilized field.
