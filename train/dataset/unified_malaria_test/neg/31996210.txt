background: molecular detection low-density plasmodium falciparum infections
is essential surveillance studies conducted inform malaria control
strategies close-to-elimination settings. molecular monitoring residual
malaria infections usually requires large study size, therefore sampling and
diagnostic processes need economical optimized high-throughput. a
method comparison undertaken identify efficient diagnostic
procedure processing large collections community samples optimal test
sensitivity, simplicity, minimal costs.
methods: reactive case detection study conducted zanzibar, parasitaemia
of 4590 individuals ages investigated highly sensitive
quantitative (q) pcr targets multiple var gene copies per parasite genome.
to reduce cost, first round positivity screening performed pools of
dried blood spots five individuals. ten cycles pre-pcr performed
directly filter paper punches, followed qpcr. second round,
samples positive pools individually analysed pre-pcr qpcr.
results: prevalence household members neighbors index cases 1.7%
(78/4590) geometric mean parasite density 58 parasites/µl blood. using 
qpcr gold standard, diagnostic sensitivity rapid diagnostic tests (rdts)
was 37% (29/78). infections positive qpcr negative rdt mean
densities 15 parasites/µl blood.
conclusion: approach pre-screening reactive case detection samples in
pools five ideal low prevalence setting zanzibar.
performing direct pcr filter paper punches saves substantial time and
justifies higher cost polymerase suitable amplifying dna directly
from whole blood. molecular monitoring community samples provided more
accurate picture infection prevalence, identified potential reservoir 
of infection largely missed rdt. developed qpcr-based methodology
for screening large sample sets represents primarily research tool 
inform design malaria elimination strategies. may also prove beneficial
for diagnostic tasks surveillance-response activities.
