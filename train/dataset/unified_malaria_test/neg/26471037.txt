background: ivermectin proposed novel malaria transmission control 
tool based insecticidal properties unique route acquisition through
human blood. maximize ivermectin's effect identify potential
resistance/tolerance mechanisms, important understand effect on
mosquito physiology potential shift mosquito population age-structure. 
therefore investigated ivermectin susceptibility gene expression changes in
several age groups female anopheles gambiae mosquitoes.
methods: effect aging ivermectin susceptibility analyzed three
age groups (2, 6, 14-days) colonized female anopheles gambiaemosquitoes
using standard survivorship assays. gene expression patterns analyzed
by transcriptome sequencing illumina hiseq 2500 platform. rt-qpcr used 
to validate transcriptional changes also examine expression a
different, colonized strain wild mosquitoes, blood fed
naturally ivermectin-treated person.
results: mosquitoes different ages blood meal history died different
frequencies ingesting ivermectin. mortality lowest 2-day old
mosquitoes exposed first blood meal highest 6-day old mosquitoes 
exposed second blood meal. twenty-four hours following ivermectin
ingestion, 101 187 genes differentially-expressed relative control
blood-fed, 2 6-day groups, respectively. transcription patterns select 
genes similar membrane-fed, colonized, naturally-fed wild vectors.
transcripts several unexpected functional classes highly up-regulated, 
including niemann-pick type c (npc) genes, peritrophic matrix-associated genes,
and immune-response genes, exhibited different transcription patterns
between age groups, may explain observed susceptibility differences.
niemann-pick type 2 genes highly up-regulated transcripts after
ivermectin ingestion (up 160 fold) comparing phylogeny transcriptional 
patterns revealed npcs rapidly evolved separate members respond 
either blood meals ivermectin.
conclusion: present evidence increased ivermectin susceptibility older
an. gambiae mosquitoes previously bloodfed. differential expression
analysis suggests complex midgut interactions resulting ivermectin ingestion
that likely involve blood meal digestion physiological responses, midgut
microflora, innate immune responses. thus, transcription certain gene 
families consistently affected ivermectin ingestion, may provide
important clues ivermectin's broad effects malaria vectors. findings 
contribute growing understanding ivermectin's potential a
transmission control tool.
