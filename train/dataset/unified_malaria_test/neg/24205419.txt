background: plasmodium vivax apical membrane antigen 1 (pvama1) a
promising malaria vaccine candidate, however remains unclear regions are
naturally targeted host immunity whether high genetic diversity will
preclude coverage monovalent vaccine. assess feasibility vaccine
candidate, investigated global population structure pvama1.
methodology principal findings: new sequences papua new guinea (png,
n = 102) analysed together published sequences thailand (n = 158),
india (n = 8), sri lanka (n = 23), venezuela (n = 74) collection of
isolates disparate geographic locations (n = 8). total 92 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) identified including 22 synonymous snps 
70 non-synonymous (ns) snps. polymorphisms signatures balancing (positive 
tajima's low fst values) selection predominantly clustered domain
i, suggesting dominant target protective immune responses. estimate
global antigenic diversity, haplotypes comprised (i) non-singleton (n = 40)
and (ii) common (≥10% minor allele frequency, n = 23) polymorphic amino acid
sites analysed revealing total 219 210 distinct haplotypes,
respectively. although highly diverse, 210 haplotypes comprised only
common polymorphisms grouped eleven clusters, however substantial
geographic differentiation observed, may implications the
efficacy pvama1 vaccines different malaria-endemic areas. png
haplotypes form distinct group clusters found geographic
region. vaccine haplotypes rare geographically restricted, suggesting
potentially poor efficacy candidate pvama1 vaccines.
conclusions: may possible cover existing global pvama1 diversity 
selection diverse alleles based analyses however important
to first define relationships genetic antigenic diversity 
this molecule.
