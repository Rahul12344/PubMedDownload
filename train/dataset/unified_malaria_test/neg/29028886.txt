infection disease progression outcome protein interactions 
pathogen host. pathogen, role player infection, becoming severe
threat life adaptability toward drugs evolutionary
dynamism nature. identifying protein targets analyzing protein interactions
between host pathogen key point. proteins higher degree and
possessing topologically significant graph theoretical measures found to
be drug targets. hand, exceptional nodes may involved in
infection mechanism pathway process biologically unknown
factors. article, attempt investigate characteristics of
host-pathogen protein interactions presenting comprehensive review of
computational approaches applied different infectious diseases. an
illustration, analyzed case study infectious disease malaria, with
its causative agent plasmodium falciparum acting 'bait' host, homo
sapiens/human acting 'prey'. pathogen-host interaction network based
on interconnectivity centrality properties, proteins viewed as
central, peripheral, hub non-hub nodes significance infection
process. besides, observed sparseness pathogen and
host interaction network, may topologically unimportant but
biologically significant proteins, also act bait/prey. so,
functional similarity gene ontology mapping help us case to
identify proteins.
