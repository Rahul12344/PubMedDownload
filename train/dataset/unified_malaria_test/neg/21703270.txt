insulin-like peptides (ilps) regulate multitude biological processes,
including metabolism immunity infection, share similar structural
motifs across widely divergent taxa. insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling
(iis) pathway elements similarly conserved. shown iis regulates 
reproduction, innate immunity, lifespan female anopheles stephensi, a
major mosquito vector human malaria. explore iis regulation of
these processes, identified genes encoding five ilps species and
characterized expression tissues. antisera ilp homologs anopheles 
gambiae used identify cellular sources an. stephensi females by
immunocytochemistry. analyzed tissue-specific ilp transcript expression in
young older females, response different feeding regimens, in
response infection plasmodiumfalciparum quantitative reverse
transcriptase-pcr assays. ilp transcript changes evident older
females response blood feeding, significant changes particularly
notable response hormonal concentrations ingested human insulin to
p. falciparum infection. changes suggest ilp secretion action may 
be similarly responsive plasmodium-infected females potentially alter
metabolism innate immunity.
