background: merozoite proteins malaria parasites involved invasion 
of red blood cells selected host immunity diversity greatly
influenced changes malaria epidemiology. greater mekong subregion
(gms), malaria transmission concentrated along international borders and
there major changes malaria epidemiology plasmodium vivax
becoming dominant species many regions. here, aimed evaluate the
genetic diversity p. vivax duffy-binding protein gene domain ii (pvdbp-ii) 
isolates eastern western borders myanmar, compared with
that global p. vivax populations.
methods: pvdbp-ii sequences obtained 85 82 clinical p. vivax
isolates eastern western myanmar borders, respectively. addition,
504 pvdbp-ii sequences nine p. vivax populations world retrieved
from genbank used comparative analysis genetic diversity,
recombination population structure parasite population.
results: nucleotide diversity pvdbp-ii sequences myanmar
border parasite isolates uniform, highest diversity located
between nucleotides 1078 1332. western myanmar isolates unique r391c
mutation. evidence positive natural selection detected pvdbp-ii gene in
p. vivax isolates eastern myanmar area. p. vivax parasite populations in
the gms, including eastern, western, central myanmar well
as thailand showed low-level genetic differentiation (fst, 0.000-0.099).
population genetic structure analysis pvdbp-ii sequences showed division
of gms populations four genetic clusters. total 60 pvdbp-ii
haplotypes identified 210 sequences gms populations. among the
epitopes pvdbp-ii, high genetic diversity found epitopes 45
(379-sifgt(d/g)(e/k)(k/n)aqq(r/h)(r/c)kq-393, π = 0.029) ia
(416-g(n/k)f(i/m)wick(l/i)-424], ib [482-ksyd(q/e)witr-490, π = 0.028) p.
vivax populations eastern western borders myanmar.
conclusions: pvdbp-ii gene genetically diverse eastern western 
myanmar border p. vivax populations. positive natural selection recombination
occurred pvdbp-ii gene. low-level genetic differentiation identified,
suggesting extensive gene flow p. vivax populations gms. these
results help understand evolution p. vivax populations the
course regional malaria elimination guide design pvdbp-ii-based
vaccine.
