background: malaria major public health problem cameroon. study of
the genetic diversity within parasite population essential understanding
the mechanism underlying malaria pathology determine parasite clones
profile infection, proper malaria control strategies. objective 
this study perform molecular characterization highly polymorphic
genetic markers plasmodium falciparum, determine allelic distribution
with influencing factors valuable investigate malaria transmission
dynamics cameroon.
methods: total 350 p. falciparum clinical isolates characterized by
genotyping block 2 msp-1, block 3 msp-2, region ii glurp gene using 
nested pcr dna sequencing 2012 2013.
results: total 5 different genotypes fragment sizes ranging 597 to
817 bp recorded glurp. overall, 16 msp-1 genotypes, including k1, mad20 
and ro33 identified, ranging 153 335 bp. peculiarity this
study ro33 monomorphic pattern revealed among pfmsp-1 allelic type.
again, study identified 27 different pfmsp-2 genotypes, ranging 140 
568 bp size, including 15 belonging 3d7-type 12 fc27 allelic
families. analysis msp-1 msp-2 peptides indicates region 
of alignment corresponding k1 polymorphism highest similarity 
msp1and msp2 clade followed mad20 93% 100% homology. therefore,
population structure p. falciparum isolates identical other
areas africa, suggesting vaccine developed k1 mad20 pfmsp1
allelic variant could protective africa children findings
requires genetic immunological investigations. multiplicity of
infection (moi) significantly higher (p < 0.05) pfmsp-2 loci (3.82), as
compare pfmsp-1 (2.51) heterozygotes ranged 0.55 pfmsp-1 to
0.96 pfmsp-2.
conclusion: high genetic diversity allelic frequencies p. falciparum
isolates indicate persisting high level transmission. study advocate
for intensification malaria control strategies cameroon. trial
registration study approved cameroon national ethics committee. is
a randomized controlled trial retrospectively registered nih u.s. national
