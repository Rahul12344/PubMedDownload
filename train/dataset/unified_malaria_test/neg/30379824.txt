immune priming insects involves initial challenge non-pathogenic
microbe exposure low dose pathogenic microorganisms, provides 
certain degree protection subsequent pathogenic infection. the
protective effect insect immune priming linked activation of
humoral cellular features innate immune response preliminary
challenge, effects might last long enough promote survival of
the infected animal. fruit fly drosophila melanogaster superb model to
dissect immune priming processes insects due availability molecular 
and genetic tools, comprehensive understanding innate immune
response organism. previous investigations indicated d.
melanogaster immune system primed efficiently. extended these
studies examining result immune priming two potent
entomopathogenic bacteria, photorhabdus luminescens p. asymbiotica. have
found rearing d. melanogaster diet containing non-pathogenic strain 
escherichia coli alone combination micrococcus luteus upregulates 
antibacterial peptide immune response young adult flies, not
prolong fly life span. also, subsequent intrathoracic injection p.
luminescens p. asymbiotica triggers immune deficiency toll signaling
pathways flies previously exposed live heat-killed mix the
non-pathogenic bacteria, immune activation fails promote fly survival 
against pathogens. findings suggest immune priming d.
melanogaster, probably insects, determined type of
microbes involved well mode microbial exposure, possibly
requires comprehensive precise alteration immune signaling function 
to provide efficient protection pathogenic infection.
