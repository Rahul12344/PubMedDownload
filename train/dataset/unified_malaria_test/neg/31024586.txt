artemisinin, important compound produced artemisia annua, active
ingredient treatment malaria. jasmonic acid, one phytohormones, 
is important elicitor artemisinin biosynthesis enhancing transcription
levels transcription factors. spl transcription factors plant-specific
transcription factors plant growth, development, secondary metabolism
regulation. however, date, spl transcription factors regulate
artemisinin biosynthesis currently unclear. here, show spl
transcription factor positively regulate artemisinin biosynthesis binding 
to promoter artemisinin biosynthetic pathway genes. screened aaspl2 
gene expression profiles analysis 14 spl transcription factors. we
demonstrated aaspl2 activate promoter dbr2 dual-luc assy.
moreover, aaspl2 overexpression plants, artemisinin content was
increased 33-86%, aaspl2 -rnai transgenic plants, artemisinin
content decreased 33-65%. data suggest aaspl2 dbr2 interact
with "gtac" cis-element dbr2 promoter, mediating transcriptional
activation dbr2 response ja resulting improvement on
artemisinin content.
