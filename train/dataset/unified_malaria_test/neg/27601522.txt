understanding genetic structure transmission dynamics plasmodium
falciparum parasites malaria-endemic regions crucial the
implementation interventions. located high-transmission region western
kenya p. falciparum predominant species, lake victoria islands
are ideal feasibility malaria elimination studies. analyzed genetic
variation eight microsatellite loci examine parasite population structure
and gene flow patterns across five sites. high levels genetic diversity were
measured throughout region (mean heterozygosity index = 0.84). overall
fixation index value sites 0.044, indicating approximately
5% overall allelic variation due differences the
populations. based results, concluded parasite population
structure studied islands shaped human migration patterns that
maintain extensive parasite gene flow sites. consequently, any
malaria elimination interventions strategies study area to
be carried broadly four islands adjoining mainland region.
