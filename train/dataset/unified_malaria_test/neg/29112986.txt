gene expression dna microarrays vital characterizing whole-genome
transcriptional profiles. nevertheless, effectiveness relies heavily the
accuracy genome sequences, annotation gene structures, the
sequence-dependent performance individual probes. currently available gene
expression arrays malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum rely an
average 2 probes per gene, usually positioned near 3' end genes;
consequently, existing designs prone measurement bias cannot capture
complexities occurrence transcript isoforms arising from
alternative splicing alternative start/ stop sites. here, describe two
novel gene expression arrays exon-focused probes designed average of
12 20 probes spanning gene. high probe density minimizes signal
noise inherent probe-to-probe sequence-dependent hybridization intensity. we
demonstrate exon arrays accurately profile genome-wide expression,
comparing favorably currently available arrays rna-seq profiling, 
detect alternatively spliced transcript isoforms well non-coding rnas
(ncrnas). 964 candidate alternate splicing events published rna-seq
studies, 162 confirmed using exon array. furthermore, exon array
predicted 330 previously unidentified alternate splicing events. gene expression 
microarrays continue offer cost-effective alternative rna-seq the
simultaneous monitoring gene expression alternative splicing events.
microarrays may even preferred cases due affordability and
the rapid turn-around results hundreds samples required for
fine-scale systems biology investigations, including monitoring the
networks gene co-expression emergence drug resistance.
