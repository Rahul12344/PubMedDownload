eimeria common genus apicomplexan parasites infect diverse
vertebrates, notably poultry, causing serious disease economic loss.
like apicomplexans, eimerians complex life cycle characterized by
asexual divisions amplify parasite population preparation sexual 
reproduction. divided three events: gametocytogenesis, producing
gametocytes merozoites; gametogenesis, producing microgametes and
macrogametes gametocytes; fertilization macrogametes microgametes,
producing diploid zygotes ensuing meiosis completing sexual phase.
sexual development eimeria depends differential expression of
stage-specific genes, rather presence absence sex chromosomes. thus,
it involves generation specific structures and, implicitly, storage of
proteins regulation protein expression macrogametes, preparation for
fertilization. eimeria, formation unique, resilient structure, the
oocyst wall, essential completion sexual phase parasite
transmission. review, piece together molecular events that
underpin sexual reproduction eimeria use additional details analogous
events plasmodium fill current knowledge gaps. mechanisms governing
sexual stage formation subsequent fertilization may represent targets for
counteracting parasite transmission.
