unlike countries, chloroquine resistant marker pfcrt t76 mutant has
remained fairly stable ghana several years official disuse of
chloroquine. certain mutations pfmdr1 may potentiate pfcrt t76, offering a
possible explanation observation. understand phenomenon, the
co-existence mutations pfmdr1 pfcrt t76 ghanaian plasmodium
falciparum isolates studied. reported presence parasites reduced 
sensitivity amodiaquine quinine country also studied. blood
samples collected confirmed malaria patients presenting health facilities
in two distinct ecological zones analyzed. prevalence pfcrt k76t 
the five point mutations pfmdr1 determined using nested pcr followed by
rflp analysis. association genes determined chi square
analysis, synergism two genes ascertained using the
jonckheere-terptra (j-t) test followed monte carlo simulation (mcs). nearly
fifty-four percent (53.7%) p. falciparum isolates examined pfcrt
t76 gene, 18.3% k76 t76 alleles. mutations codon 86,
184, 1034, 1042 1246 pfmdr1 gene detected 36.0%, 87.9%, 71.0%,
91.6% 8.4% isolates, respectively. haplotypes pfmdr1 present
were nfcdd (43.46%), yfcdd (27.57%), nfsdd (7.48%), nysny (5.14%) yfsdd
(4.67%). pfcrt t76 significantly associated double mutation codon
86 184 pfmdr1 (yf; χ2=18.045, p=0.006). associations observed between
pfcrt k76t pfmdr1 triple mutation codons 86, 184 1034 (nfc; χ2=13.770,
p=0.032 yfc; χ2=16.489, p=0.011). j-t test showed significant synergism
between pfcrt 76 pfmdr1 polymorphisms (p<0.0001), confirmed mcs 
at 99% ci. synergism pfcrt pfmdr1 mutant genes could account 
slow recovery chloroquine sensitive p. falciparum ghana. same
phenomenon could explain resistance amodiaquine quinine. outcomes of
this study also indicated possible emergence artemether-lumefantrine
resistance ghana.
