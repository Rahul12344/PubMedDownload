in study, developed human immune system (his) mice possess
functional human cd4+ cells b cells, named his-cd4/b mice. his-cd4/b mice
were generated first introducing hla class ii genes, including dr1 dr4,
along genes encoding various human cytokines human b cell activation
factor (baff) nsg mice adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (aav9) vectors,
followed engrafting human hematopoietic stem cells (hscs). his-cd4/b mice, 
which reconstitution human cd4+ b cells resembles humans,
produced significant level human igg plasmodium falciparum
circumsporozoite (pfcs) protein upon immunization. cd4+ cells his-cd4/b
mice, possess central effector memory phenotypes like humans, 
are functional, since pfcs protein-specific human cd4+ cells secreting ifn-γ
and il-2 detected immunized his-cd4/b mice. lastly, pfcs
protein-immunized his-cd4/b mice protected vivo challenge with
transgenic p. berghei sporozoites expressing pfcs protein. immune sera
collected protected his-cd4/b mice reacted transgenic p. berghei
sporozoites expressing pfcs protein also inhibited parasite invasion 
into hepatocytes vitro. taken together, studies show his-cd4/b 
mice could mount protective human anti-malaria immunity, consisting human igg 
and human cd4+ cell responses specific human malaria antigen.
