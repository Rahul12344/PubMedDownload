background: gene copy number variants (cnvs), consist deletions and
amplifications single sets contiguous genes, contribute great
diversity plasmodium falciparum genome. vitro studies laboratory
have revealed important role parasite fitness phenotypes red
cell invasion, transmissibility cytoadherence. studies natural parasite
populations indicate cnvs also common field thus may
facilitate adaptation parasite local environment.
results: survey 183 fresh field isolates three populations in
eastern africa different malaria transmission intensities, identified 94 
cnv loci using microarrays. cnvs low population frequencies (minor allele
frequency < 5%) parasite isolate carried average 8 cnvs. nine cnvs
showed high levels population differentiation (fst > 0.3) nine exhibited
significant clines population frequency across gradient transmission
intensity. clearest example large deletion chromosome 9
previously reported laboratory-adapted isolates. deletion was
present 33% isolates population low highly seasonal malaria
transmission, < 9% isolates populations higher transmission. 
subsets cnvs strongly correlated population frequencies,
implying co-selection.
conclusions: results support hypothesis cnvs target of
selection natural populations p. falciparum. environment-specific
patterns observed imply important role conferring
adaptability parasite thus enabling persist highly diverse
ecological environment.
