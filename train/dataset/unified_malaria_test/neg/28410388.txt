background: within last century, increases human movement and
globalization trade facilitated establishment several highly
invasive mosquito species new geographic locations concurrent major
environmental, economic health consequences. asian tiger mosquito, aedes 
albopictus, extremely invasive aggressive daytime-biting mosquito 
is major public health threat throughout expanding range.
methodology/principal findings: used 13 nuclear microsatellite loci (on 911
individuals) mitochondrial coi sequences gain better understanding of
the historical contemporary movements ae. albopictus indo-pacific
region characterize population structure. approximate bayesian
computation (abc) employed test competing historical routes invasion of
ae. albopictus within southeast (se) asian/australasian region. abc
results show ae. albopictus likely introduced new guinea via
mainland southeast asia, colonizing solomon islands via either papua
new guinea se asia. analysis also supported recent incursion into
northern australia's torres strait islands seeded chiefly indonesia. for
the first time documented invasive species, provide evidence a
recently colonized population (the torres strait islands) undergone
rapid temporal changes genetic makeup, could result of
genetic drift represent secondary invasion unknown source.
conclusions/significance: appears high spatial genetic structure 
high gene flow geographically distant populations. species'
genetic structure region tends favour dispersal pattern driven mostly
by human movements. importantly, study provides widespread sampling
distribution species' native range, revealing spatial population
structure previously shown. additionally, present probable
invasion history species australasian region using abc analysis.
