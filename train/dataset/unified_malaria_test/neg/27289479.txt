archaeogenetics study exploration ancient dna (adna) than
70 years old. important part wider studies many different
areas past, including animal, plant pathogen evolution and
domestication events. hereby, address specifically impact research in
archaeogenetics broader field evolutionary medicine. studies ancient
hominid genomes help understand even modern health patterns. human genetic
microevolution, e.g. related abilities post-weaning milk consumption, and
specifically genetic adaptation disease susceptibility, e.g. towards malaria
and infectious diseases, upmost importance contributions of
archeogenetics evolutionary understanding human health disease.
with increase understanding modern medical genetics the
ability deep sequence ancient genetic information, field archaeogenetic
evolutionary medicine blossoming.
