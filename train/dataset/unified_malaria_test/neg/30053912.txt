background: malaria remains one leading causes morbidity mortality 
in low- middle-income countries. chloroquine previously cheap and
effective antimalarial agent whose loss resistance resulted than
doubling malaria-related mortality malaria-endemic countries. recently,
chloroquine sensitivity re-emerging among plasmodium falciparum parasites
which gives hope malaria control treatment efforts globally. aim of
the current review establish prevalence chloroquine resistance
alleles among p. falciparum parasites malaria-endemic areas change in
malaria treatment policy.
methods/design: articles obtained search medline via pubmed, 
scopus, embase data bases. mesh terms used article search.
boolean operators ("and," "or") used article search. article
search done independently two librarians. prisma-p statement 
be used guide conduct reporting systematic review. strega
guideline used developing data abstraction form review. data
abstraction done two independent reviewers, kappa statistic be
calculated, discrepancies resolved discussion. data analysis be
done using stata ver 13.0. level heterogeneity articles be
established using i2-statistic. publication bias assessed using
funnel plot. random effects analysis used.
discussion: review seeks establish extent chloroquine resistance
reversal malaria-endemic countries. evidence generated review
will help guide policy makers potential re-emerging role chloroquine in
malaria treatment.
systematic review registration: systematic review protocol been
registered prospero registration number crd42018083957.
