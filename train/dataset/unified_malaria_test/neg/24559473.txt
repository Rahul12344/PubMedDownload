background: advances high-throughput sequencing led discovery of
widespread transcription natural antisense transcripts (nats) large
number organisms, transcripts shown play important
roles regulation gene expression. likewise, existence nats has
been observed plasmodium understanding towards genome-wide
distribution remains incomplete due limited depth uncertainties the
level strand specificity previous datasets.
results: gain insights genome-wide distribution nats p.
falciparum, performed rna-ligation based strand-specific rna sequencing at
unprecedented depth. data indicate 78.3% genome transcribed
during blood-stage development. moreover, analysis reveals significant levels
of antisense transcription least 24% protein-coding genes that
while expression levels nats change intraerythrocytic developmental
cycle (idc), correlate corresponding mrna levels.
interestingly, antisense transcription evenly distributed across coding
regions (cdss) strongly clustered towards 3'-end cdss. furthermore,
for significant subset nats, transcript levels correlate mrna levels of
neighboring genes.finally, able identify polyadenylation sites
(pass) subset nats, demonstrating least nats are
polyadenylated. also mapped pass 3443 coding genes, yielding average
3' untranslated region length 523 bp.
conclusions: strand-specific analysis p. falciparum transcriptome
expands strengthens existing body evidence antisense
transcription substantial phenomenon p. falciparum. subset of
neighboring genes find sense antisense transcript levels are
intricately linked nats appear regulated independently mrna 
transcription. deep strand-specific dataset provide valuable resource 
for precise determination expression levels separates sense from
antisense transcript levels, find often significantly differ. in
addition, extensive novel data 3' utr length allow others perform 
searches regulatory motifs utrs help understand post-translational
regulation p. falciparum.
