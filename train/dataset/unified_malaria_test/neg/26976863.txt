intracellular schizonts apicomplexans theileria annulata theileria
parva immortalize bovine leukocytes thereby cause fatal diseases. the
hydroxynaphthoquinone buparvaquone currently option treatment
of theileriosis, resistance development reported. therefore
tempting investigate repurposing compounds effective related
apicomplexan parasites, plasmodium here, present results a
screen 400 compounds included open-access medicines malaria venture
(mmv) malaria box tac12 cells, macrophage-derived cell line immortalized 
t. annulata schizonts. using combination classical alamarblue vitality
assay recently developed quantitative reverse transcriptase real-time pcr
method based theileria tasp gene, identified 5 compounds,
characterized effects ultrastructure tac12 cells, and
investigated whether easily induce resistance formation. two compounds, 
quinolinols mmv666022 mmv666054, 50% inhibitory concentrations (ic50s)
of 0.5 0.2 μm tac12 cells 5.3 5.2 μm bomac cells, respectively.
thus, therapeutic indexes 11 18, represent promising leads for
further development antitheilerial chemotherapeutics.
