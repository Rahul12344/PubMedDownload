there great increase plasmodium vivax incidences republic of
korea genetic diversity parasite became complex the
rapid dissemination newly introduced genotypes. surveillance imported
malaria important, good way determine imported vs.
internal cases. study, characterized imported vivax cases, analyzed
the genetic sequence three imported vivax malaria cases merozoite
surface protein-1 (msp-1) circumsporozoite protein (csp) genes, clearly
discriminated imported vivax case misdiagnosed indigenous by
genetic analysis. pcr reaction merozoite surface protein-1 (msp-1) and
circumsporozoite protein (csp) genes three imported vivax cases were
amplified sequenced. genetic variations compared previously
constructed database south korean isolates. imported vivax cases showed
various patterns incubation period onset. cases other
parts asia. msp-1 gene sequence analysis three imported cases showed
that imported cases completely different sequences subtypes from
korean isolates. case-1 case-2 exact match indian isolate, case-3
had great similarity isolates countries neighboring indonesia. csp gene
analysis based repeat patterns showed similar results sequences
from imported cases well matched patient's traveled countries and
completely discriminated indigenous cases. ama-1 gene analysis also
supported results. able clearly distinguish three imported vivax
cases indigenous using genetic database korean isolates were
able suspect origin genotyping. study demonstrated usefulness 
of genetic survey imported malaria cases.
