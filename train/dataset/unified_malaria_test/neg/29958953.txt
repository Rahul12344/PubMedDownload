biosynthesis isoprenoids (mep pathway) apicoplast important role
during erythrocytic stages plasmodium, sole pathway to
provide major isoprene units required metabolic precursor various
housekeeping activities. intensifying need identify novel
therapeutic drug target plasmodium, mep pathway components
are considered potential therapeutic targets, due difference the
isoprenoid synthesis route (mva) functional host cells. major
components already studied pathway potential a
drug target, ispd (2-c-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate cytidyltransferase)
enzyme, enzyme catalyzing third step pathway tested 
against synthetic compound malaria box called mmv008138, also has
not shown adequate inhibitory activity p. vivax ispd. present
study, validate potential pvispd drug target, various
antimicrobial agents screened inhibition possibilities, using
in-vitro high throughput screening (hts) technique. shortlisted antimicrobial
drug molecules like cefepime, tunicamycin rifampicin validated
by in-vitro biochemical enzyme inhibition assays showed activity at
nanomolar concentrations suggesting derivatives prospective
future antimalarials. study also confirmed in-vivo expression pvispd 
protein asexual stages sub-cellular localization apicoplast and
explores importance ispd enzyme development new
therapeutics.
