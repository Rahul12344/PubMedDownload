during intraerythrocytic development, malaria parasite plasmodium
falciparum exposes variant surface antigens (vsas) infected erythrocytes to
establish maintain infection. one family small vsas polymorphic 
stevor proteins, marked export host cell surface through
their pexel signal peptide. interestingly, stevors also reported
to localize parasite plasma membrane apical organelles, pointing
toward putative function host cell egress invasion. using deep rna
sequencing analysis, characterized p. falciparum stevor gene expression across
the intraerythrocytic development cycle, including free merozoites, detail and
used resulting stevor expression profiles hierarchical clustering. we
found stevor genes show biphasic expression oscillation, maximum
expression trophozoite stages second peak late schizonts. we
selected four stevor variants, confirmed expected export proteins to
the host cell membrane, tracked secondary location, either the
parasite plasma membrane secretory organelles merozoites late
schizont stages. investigated function particular stevor showed 
rhoptry localization demonstrated role parasite-host interface
during host cell invasion specific antisera targeted gene disruption.
experimentally determined membrane topology stevor revealed single
transmembrane domain exposing semiconserved well variable protein
regions cell surface.importance malaria claims half million lives 
each year. plasmodium falciparum, causative agent severe form 
the disease, uses proteins translocated surface infected
erythrocytes immune evasion. circumvent detection gene
products immune system, parasite evolved complex strategy that
includes gene duplications elaborate sequence polymorphism. stevors one
family variant surface antigens encoded 40 genes. using
deep rna sequencing blood-stage parasites, including free merozoites, first
established stevor expression cultured isolate compared with
published transcriptomes. reveal biphasic expression stevor genes
and confirm individual stevors protein level. membrane
topology rhoptry-associated variant experimentally elucidated linked
to host cell invasion, underlining importance multifunctional protein
family parasite proliferation.
