the global emergence spread malaria parasites resistant antimalarial
drugs major problem malaria control. genetic basis the
parasite's resistance antimalarial drug chloroquine (cq) is
well-documented, allowing analysis field isolates malaria parasites
to address evolutionary questions concerning origin spread of
cq-resistance. here, present dna sequence analyses second exon 
the plasmodium falciparum cq-resistance transporter (pfcrt) gene 5' end
of p. falciparum multidrug-resistance 1 (pfmdr-1) gene 40 p. falciparum
field isolates collected eight different localities odisha, india. first,
we genotyped samples pfcrt k76t pfmdr-1 n86y mutations these
two genes, mutations primarily implicated cq-resistance. we
further analyzed amino acid changes codons 72-76 pfcrt haplotypes.
interestingly, k76t n86y mutations found co-exist 32 
of total 40 isolates, either cviet svmnt haplotype,
while remaining eight isolates cvmnk haplotype. total, eight
nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) observed, six the
pfcrt gene two pfmdr-1 gene. one poorly studied snp pfcrt gene 
(a97t) found high frequency many p. falciparum samples. using
population genetics analyze two gene fragments, revealed
comparatively higher nucleotide diversity pfcrt gene pfmdr-1
gene. furthermore, linkage disequilibrium found tight closely
spaced snps pfcrt gene. finally, pfcrt pfmdr-1 genes were
found evolve standard neutral model molecular evolution.
