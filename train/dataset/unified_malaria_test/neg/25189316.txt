background: due effect midgut bacteria proliferation parasites
and potential paratransgenesis tools, identification malaria
vector mosquitoes important. anopheles culicifacies s.l. one main
malaria vectors asia; however, midgut microbiota remains un-studied. 
work primarily designed isolate potential candidates use a
paratransgenesis approach, also give picture midgut microbiota of
wild-caught an. culicifacies larvae adults southeast corner iran,
which highest malaria endemicity country.
methods: total 68 larvae 34 adult females (newly eclosed older) from
three different biotopes iran analyzed midgut microflora. the
mosquitoes midgut bacterial contents plated three different culture 
media (brain heart agar, nutrient agar blood agar) yielding 57 bacterial
isolates. 16s rrna genes isolates sequence analyzed species
designation, confirmed biochemical analysis.
results: total twelve bacterial genera identified: acinetobacter,
aeromonas, bacillus, chryseobacterium, delftia, exiguobacterium, kurthia,
microbacterium, pseudomonas, staphylococcus, thorsellia variovorax. older 
females, gram-negative bacteria found, whereas larvae newly-eclosed
adults also harbored gram-positive bacteria. diversity isolates also
varied sampling sites mosquito stages, largest number of
genera found anguri district larvae, respectively. pseudomonas 
the common genus retrieved sampling sites, larvae and
adults, suggesting potential transstadial passage bacteria.
interestingly, identical 16s sequences pseudomonas found mosquitoes
originating different habitats least 45 km apart, could suggest
that bacteria adapted mosquitoes.
conclusions: study vector mosquito microbiota recently gathered
increased interest potential influence vector competence. by
adding data hitherto uncharacterized malaria mosquito, better picture of
gut flora vector mosquitoes obtained. furthermore, species the
predominant genus pseudomonas evaluated selection a
paratransgenesis candidate.
