background: informing evaluating malaria control efforts relies knowledge 
of local transmission dynamics. serological molecular tools demonstrated
great sensitivity quantify transmission intensity low endemic settings
where sensitivity traditional methods limited. filter paper blood spots
are commonly used source dna antibodies. enhance operational
practicability malaria surveys, method presented combined dna
extraction antibody elution.
methods: filter paper blood spots collected part large
cross-sectional survey kenyan highlands. dna extracted using a
saponin/chelex method. eluate first wash dna extraction
process used antibody detection compared previously validated
antibody elution procedures. antibody elution efficiency assessed total
igg elisa malaria antigens apical membrane antigen-1 (ama-1) and
merozoite-surface protein-1 (msp-142). sensitivity nested 18s rrna and
cytochrome b pcr assays impact doubling filter paper material pcr 
sensitivity determined. distribution cell material antibodies
throughout filter paper blood spots examined using luminescent and
fluorescent reporter assays.
results: antibody levels measured combined antibody/dna extraction
technique strongly correlated measured standard antibody
elution (p < 0.0001). antibody levels ama-1 msp-142 generally
slightly lower (11.3-21.4%) age-seroprevalence patterns were
indistinguishable. proportion parasite positive samples ranged 12.9% 
to 19.2% different pcr assays. despite strong agreement outcomes
of different pcr assays, none assays detected parasite-positive
individuals. assays doubling filter paper material dna extraction
increased sensitivity. concentration cell antibody material not
homogenously distributed throughout blood spots.
conclusion: combined dna extraction antibody elution operationally
attractive approach high throughput assessment cumulative malaria exposure
and current infection prevalence endemic settings. estimates antibody
prevalence unaffected combined extraction elution procedure. the
choice target gene amount source filter paper material dna 
extraction marked impact pcr sensitivity.
