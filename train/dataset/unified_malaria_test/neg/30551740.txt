background: congenital malaria usually defined detection asexual
forms plasmodium spp. blood sample neonate perinatal age if
there possibility postpartum infection mosquito bite. incidence
of congenital malaria highly variable seems related several factors,
such different diagnostic methods plasmodium spp. detection, area in
which epidemiologic analyses performed. non-endemic countries, cases
of congenital malaria rare. hereby, case congenital malaria hiv 
exposed child reported.
case presentation: 2-month-old male child admitted bambino gesù
children's hospital due anaemia exposure hiv. born prematurely
in italy cesarean section 34 weeks' gestation bicorial, biamniotic 
pregnancy migrant woman nigeria. first non-identical
twins. combined anaemia, spleen liver enlargement noted, malaria was
hypothesized. malaria laboratory panel performed newborn, mother and
other twin blood samples, follows: (i) malaria rapid diagnostic test (rdt);
(ii) giemsa-stained thick thin blood smears plasmodium spp.
identification parasitaemia titration; (iii) molecular screening typing
of plasmodium spp. multiplex qualitative pcr assay based 18s rrna gene.
genotyping plasmodium falciparum isolates mother child performed 
by neutral microsatellite highly polymorphic marker amplification.
conclusions: maternal rdt sample negative, infant rdt was
positive; cases microscopy blood smears pcr showed infection 
p. falciparum. two genotypic molecular markers displayed different allelic
variants two samples. difference could imply infection
multiplicity mother pregnancy, possibly harbouring than
one isolate, one transmitted newborn other
persisting mother's blood. increasing number pregnant
women coming endemic areas malaria, accurate anamnesis infant's
mother, inclusion plasmodium spp. research torch screenings for
mother-infant pair birth, aiming reducing morbidity mortality
associated disease might suitable.
