background: following fertilization, early proteomes metazoans defined
by translation stored repressed transcripts; embryonic
development relies de novo transcription zygotic genome. sexual 
development plasmodium berghei, rodent model human malaria species
including p. falciparum, stability repressed mrnas requires the
translational repressors dozi cith. repressors absent,
plasmodium zygote development transmission mosquito vector halted, 
as hundreds transcripts become destabilized. however, mrnas direct
targets rna binding proteins, thus subject translational
repression, unknown.
results: identify maternal mrna contribution post-fertilization
development p. berghei using rna immunoprecipitation microarray analysis. 
we find 731 mrnas, approximately 50% transcriptome, associated
with dozi cith, allowing zygote development proceed absence rna 
polymerase ii transcription. using gfp-tagging, validate repression
phenotype selected genes identify mrnas relying 5' untranslated
region translational control. gene deletion reveals novel protein located
in ookinete crystalloid essential function sporozoite
development.
conclusions: study details first time p. berghei maternal
repressome. mrna population provides developing ookinete coding
potential key molecules required life-cycle progression, are
likely critical transmission malaria parasite the
rodent human host mosquito vector.
