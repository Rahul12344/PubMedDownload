malaria blood stage parasites develop within red blood cells are
contained vacuolar compartment known parasitophorous vacuole (pv).
this compartment holds key role interaction parasite its
host cell. however, proteome compartment far been
comprehensively analysed. used bioid asexual blood stages 
virulent human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum identify new proteins of
the pv. resulting proteome contained many already known pv proteins
and validation gfp-knock-in 10 previously p. falciparum uncharacterised 
hits revealed 5 new pv proteins two partial pv localisation. this
included proteins peripherally attached inner face pv membrane as
well proteins anchored parasite plasma membrane protrude 
pv. using selectable targeted gene disruption generated mutants 2 the
10 candidates. contrast could select parasites disruptions for
another 3 candidates, strongly suggesting important parasite
growth. interestingly, one included orthologue uis2, protein
previously proposed regulate protein translation parasite cytoplasm but
here shown essential pv protein. work extends number known
pv proteins provides starting point functional analyses this
compartment.
