insecticides remain main tool control arthropod vectors. urgency
to prevent insurgence insecticide resistance perspective find
new target sites, development novel molecules, fuelling study 
of molecular mechanisms involved insect defence xenobiotic
compounds. study, investigated atp-binding cassette (abc)
transporters, major component defensome machinery, involved in
defence insecticide permethrin, susceptible larvae malaria 
vector anopheles gambiae sensu stricto. bioassays performed permethrin 
alone, combination abc transporter inhibitor. have
investigated expression profiles five abc transporter genes different
time points following permethrin exposure, assess expression patterns
across time. inhibition abc transporters increased larval mortality by
about 15-fold. likewise, three genes up-regulated exposure to
permethrin, showing different patterns expression across 48 h. results
provide first evidences abc transporters involvement defence 
toxic larvae an. gambiae s.s. show gene expression response is
modulated across time, continuous, stronger earliest latest 
times exposure.
