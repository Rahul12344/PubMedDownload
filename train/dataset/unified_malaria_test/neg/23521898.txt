in holoendemic plasmodium falciparum transmission areas western kenya,
severe malarial anemia [sma, hemoglobin (hb) < 6.0 g/dl, density
parasitemia] common clinical manifestation severe malaria
resulting high rates pediatric morbidity mortality regions.
previous studies associated interleukin (il)-13 pathogenesis different
infectious diseases, including p. falciparum malaria. however, functional
roles polymorphic variants within il-13 promoter conditioning
susceptibility sma remain largely unexplored. such, association between
the il-13 variants -7402 t/g (rs7719175) -4729g/a (rs3091307) and
susceptibility sma determined children (n = 387) presenting with
clinical symptoms falciparum malaria resident holoendemic
transmission region western kenya. results indicated difference 
proportions individual genotypes among children presenting non-sma (n =
222) versus sma (n = 165). similarly, associations the
individual genotypes (-7402 t/g -4729g/a) sma. additional analyses,
however, revealed proportions individuals -7402 t/-4729a (ta)
haplotype significantly higher children presenting sma non-sma
group (p = 0.043). multivariate logistic regression analyses,
controlling confounding factors, demonstrated carriage ta
haplotype associated increased susceptibility sma (or; 1.564, 95% ci;
1.023-2.389, p = 0.039). addition, circulating levels il-13 comparable
between clinical groups well across genotypes haplotypes.
collectively, findings presented suggest haplotypes within il-13
promoter -7402 t/g -4729g/a may modulate sma pathogenesis, not
affect circulating il-13 levels.
