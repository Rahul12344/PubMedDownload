plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pdc) activators innate adaptive immune
responses express hla-dr, toll-like receptor (tlr) 7, tlr9 produce type 
i interferons. role human pdc malaria remains poorly characterised. pdc
activation cytokine production assessed 59 malaria-naive volunteers
during experimental infection 150 1,800 p. falciparum-parasitized red
blood cells. using rna sequencing, longitudinal changes pdc gene expression
were examined five adults peak-infection. pdc responsiveness 
tlr7 tlr9 stimulation assessed in-vitro. circulating pdc remained
transcriptionally stable gene expression altered 8 genes (fdr < 0.07).
there upregulation co-stimulatory molecules cd86, cd80, cd40, and
reduced surface expression hla-dr cd123 (il-3r-α). pdc loss the
circulation associated active caspase-3, suggesting pdc apoptosis during
primary infection. pdc remained responsive tlr stimulation, producing ifn-α
and upregulating hla-dr, cd86, cd123 peak-infection. clinical malaria, pdc 
retained hla-dr reduced cd123 expression compared convalescence. these
data demonstrate pdc retain function first blood-stage p. falciparum
exposure despite sub-microscopic parasitaemia downregulating hla-dr. lack 
evident pdc activation early infection malaria suggests little
response circulating pdc infection.
