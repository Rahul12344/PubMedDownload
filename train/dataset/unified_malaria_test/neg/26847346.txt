background: plasmodium rhoptry-associated protein 1 (rap-1) plays role in
the formation parasitophorous vacuole following parasite's invasion of
red blood cells. although evidence protein recognized
by host's immune system, study plasmodium falciparum rap-1 (pfrap-1)
suggests immune pressure. previous study five old
(1953-1962) p. knowlesi strains suggested rap-1 limited genetic
polymorphism might negative selection. present study, 30
recent p. knowlesi isolates studied obtain better insight the
polymorphism natural selection pkrap-1.
methods: blood samples 30 knowlesi malaria patients used. samples
were collected 2010 2014. pkrap-1 gene, contains two exons,
was amplified pcr, cloned escherichia coli sequenced. genetic
diversity phylogenetic analyses performed using mega6 dnasp ver.
5.10.00 programs.
results: thirty pkrap-1 sequences obtained. nucleotide diversity (Ï€) 
exons 1, 2 total coding region (0.00915, 0.01353 0.01298,
respectively) higher old strains. analysis
revealed lower rate non-synonymous (dn) synonymous (ds) mutations,
suggesting negative (purifying) selection pkrap-1. tajima's test fu 
li's test values significant. amino acid level, 22 haplotypes
were established haplotype h7 highest frequency (7/34, 20.5 %).
in phylogenetic analysis, two distinct haplotype groups observed. the
first group contained majority haplotypes, whereas second had
fewer haplotypes.
conclusions: present study found higher genetic polymorphism pkrap-1
gene polymorphism level reported previous study. observation
may stem difference sample size present (n = 30) 
previous (n = 5) study. synonymous non-synonymous mutation analysis indicated
purifying (negative) selection gene. separation pkrap-1haplotypes
into two groups provides evidence postulation two distinct p.
knowlesi types lineages.
