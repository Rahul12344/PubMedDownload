background: plasmodium vivax malaria accounts 80% malaria cases in
delhi, india. gene merozoite surface protein 3 alpha (msp3α) highly
polymorphic used marker many p. vivax population studies.
methods: msp3α used assess genetic diversity p. vivax samples 
from delhi (india) one malaria episode (s) i.e. clinically
identified relapse cases using pcr-rflp sequencing.
results: three major genotypes 2.0 kb (a), 1.4 kb (b) 1.2 kb (c) were
amplified 72 isolates frequencies 72.2%, 19.44% 9.72%
respectively. one sample 72 showed mixed infection b
type genotypes. 82.05% patients showed genotype 17.94% patients
showed different genotypes subsequent malaria episodes. 18 different
genotypes alu 35 hha identified among 72 samples analyzed 
by restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp). 18 pvmsp3α nucleotide
sequences analyzed reveal distinct intragenic differences
within sequences type, however, allelic diversity among three
types (π = 0.029703) observed. phylogenetic analysis showed allelic family
types a, b c clustered distributed different branches. the
results indicate p. vivax parasite population highly diverse in
delhi, india. large number amino acid substitutions found locus 
of isolates compared belem strain (π  = 0.030528). the
substantial sequence diversity largely restricted certain domains of
encoded protein. analysis synonymous nonsynonymous substitutions suggested
that different selection forces operating different regions the
protein molecule.
conclusion: propose genotyping pvmsp-3α gene one the
molecular tools differentiating relapse new infection epidemiological
settings. analyses sequence polymorphism pvmsp-3α gene enable as
potential candidate inclusion p.vivax vaccine research.
