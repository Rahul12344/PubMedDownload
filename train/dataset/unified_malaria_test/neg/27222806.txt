background: due widespread resistance plasmodium falciparum to
chloroquine drug, artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) been
recommended first-line treatment. study aims evaluate extent
of chloroquine resistance p. falciparum infection introduction of
act. study carried based mutation analysis p. falciparum
chloroquine resistant transporter (pfcrt) p. falciparum multidrug resistance 
1 (pfmdr1) genes. identification molecular markers plays significant
role monitoring assessment drug resistance well designing an
effective antimalarial drug policy india.
methods: sixty blood samples collected patients infected p.
falciparum jipmer, puducherry mkcg medical college, odisha. polymerase
chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism performed, targeting 
the point mutation k76t pfcrt n86y pfmdr1 gene. pcr products
were sequenced, genotyped analysed amino acid changes these
codons.
results: frequency pfcrt mutation 76th position dominant mutant
t allele 56.7% wild type k, 43.3%. majority pfmdr1 86 allele were
wild type, n (90%) mutant, (10%). additionally, found three
haplotypes cq resistance, svmnt, cviet cvikt association the
pfcrt gene. however, poorly studied snp pfmdr1 gene (y184f) associated 
cq resistance showed high frequency (70%) p. falciparum isolates.
conclusions: point mutation k76t pfcrt high p. falciparum suggesting
a sustained high cq resistance even five years introduction acts 
for antimalarial therapy. present study suggests strong association cq
resistance pfcrt t76, pfmdr1 y86 mutation. however,
sequence analysis showed y184f mutation pfmdr1 gene found be
associated high resistance. also, new pfcrt haplotype 'cvikt' associated
with cq resistance found present indian strains p. falciparum.
the data obtained study helps continuous monitoring drug
resistance malaria also suggests need careful usage cq in
plasmodium vivax malarial treatment.
