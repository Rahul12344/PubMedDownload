trichomonas vaginalis, common nonviral sexually transmitted parasite,
causes ∼283 million trichomoniasis infections annually associated with
pregnancy complications increased risk hiv-1 acquisition. the
antimicrobial drug metronidazole used treatment, fraction of
clinical cases, parasites become resistant drug. undertook
sequencing multiple clinical isolates lab derived lines identify
genetic markers mechanisms metronidazole resistance. reduced
representation genome sequencing ∼100 t. vaginalis clinical isolates
identified 3,923 snp markers presence bipartite population structure.
linkage disequilibrium found decay rapidly, suggesting genome-wide
recombination feasibility genetic association studies parasite.
we identified 72 snps associated metronidazole resistance, comparison 
of snps within several lab-derived resistant lines revealed overlap the
clinically resistant isolates. identified snps genes function 
has yet assigned, well functionally-characterized genes relevant to
drug resistance (e.g., pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase). transcription
profiles resistant strains showed common changes genes involved drug
activation (e.g., flavin reductase), accumulation (e.g., multidrug resistance
pump), detoxification (e.g., nitroreductase). finally, identified
convergent genetic changes lab-derived resistant lines tritrichomonas
foetus, distantly related species causes venereal disease cattle.
shared genetic changes within t. vaginalis tr. foetus parasites
suggest conservation pathways adaptation occurred. these
findings extend knowledge drug resistance parasite, providing a
panel markers used diagnostic tool.
