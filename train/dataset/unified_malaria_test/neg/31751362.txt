human infections due monkey malaria parasite plasmodium knowlesi are
increasingly reported malaysia. parasite causes high parasitaemia,
severe fatal malaria humans thus need urgent measures for
its control. msp4 potential vaccine candidate, well studied 
plasmodium falciparum plasmodium vivax; however, study conducted 
in orthologous gene p. knowlesi. study, investigated level 
of polymorphisms, haplotypes, natural selection population structure of
full-length pkmsp4 32 clinical samples malaysian borneo along 4
lab-adapted strains. found low levels polymorphism across gene with
exon showing higher diversity exon ii. c- terminal epidermal
growth factor (egf) domains gpi-anchored region within exon ii mostly
conserved 2 non-synonymous substitutions. although 21 amino acid
haplotypes found, frequency mutation majority the
polymorphic positions low. found evidence negative selection the
exon ii gene indicating existence functional constraints. phylogenetic 
haplotype network analysis identified shared haplotypes indicated
geographical clustering samples originating peninsular malaysia and
malaysian borneo. high population differentiation values observed within
parasite populations originating malaysian borneo (kapit, sarikei and
betong) laboratory-adapted strains obtained peninsular malaysia and
philippines indicating distinct population structure. first study 
genetically characterize full-length msp4 gene clinical isolates p.
knowlesi malaysia thus would useful future rational vaccine 
studies. studies higher number samples functional
characterization protein necessary.
