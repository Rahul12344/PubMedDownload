background: i164l mutation dhfr gene confers high level resistance 
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) rare africa except cluster of
reports prevalence >10% highland areas southwest uganda eastern
rwanda. occurrence dhfr i164l mutation investigated community
surveys area examined relationship migration.
methods: cross-sectional prevalence survey undertaken among villages
within catchment areas two health facilities highland site (kabale)
and highland fringe site (rukungiri) 2007. sociodemographic details,
including recent migration, collected person included study.
a total 206 plasmodium falciparum positive subjects detected rapid
diagnostic test; 203 rukungiri 3 kabale. bloodspot samples taken
and screened dhfr i164l.
results: sequence analysis confirmed presence i164l mutations in
twelve p. falciparum positive samples giving estimated prevalence 8.6% in
rukungiri. three parasite positive samples kabale, none i164l
mutations. among twelve i164l positives three male, ages ranged 5
to 90 years age. none i164l mutation travelled the
8 weeks prior survey, although three households at
least one household member travelled period. haplotypes were
determined non-mixed infections showed dhfr i164l mutation occurs in
both n51i + s108n + i164l haplotype (n = 2) n51i + c59r + s108n + i164l 
haplotype (n = 5). genotyping flanking microsatellite markers showed 
i164l occurred independently triple mutant (n51i, c59r + s108n) double
mutant (n51i + s108n) background.
conclusions: sustained local transmission parasites dhfr
i164l mutation rukungiri evidence indicate occurrence is
associated recent travel highly resistant neighbouring areas. the
emergence regional cluster i164l sw uganda rwanda indicates that
transmission i164l facilitated strong drug pressure low transmission 
areas potentially catalysed areas travel importation of
parasites relatively higher transmission settings.
