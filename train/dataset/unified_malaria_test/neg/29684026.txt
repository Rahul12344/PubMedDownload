alternative methods mosquito control needed tackle rising burden of
mosquito-borne diseases minimizing use synthetic insecticides, which
are threatened rapid increase insecticide resistance mosquito
populations. fungal biopesticides show great promise potential alternatives
because ecofriendly nature ability infect mosquitoes contact. 
here describe temporospatial interactions mosquito aedes
aegypti several entomopathogenic fungi. fungal infection assays followed by
the molecular assessment infection-responsive genes revealed intricate
interaction mosquito immune system entomopathogenic fungi. we
observed contrasting tissue time-specific differences activation of
immune signaling pathways antimicrobial peptide expression. addition,
these antifungal responses appear vary according fungal entomopathogen 
used infection. enzyme activity-based assays coupled gene expression 
analysis prophenoloxidase genes revealed reduction phenoloxidase (po)
activity mosquitoes infected virulent fungal strains 3 6d
post-fungal infection. moreover, fungal infection led increase midgut
microbiota appear attributed part reduced midgut reactive oxygen
species (ros) activity. indicates fungal infection far reaching
effects microbes naturally associated mosquitoes. study also
revealed despite fungal recognition immune elicitation mosquito, 
it unable successfully eliminate entomopathogenic fungal infection. our
study provides new insights intricate multipartite interaction and
contributes better understanding mosquito antifungal immunity.
