cd81 participates variety important cellular processes membrane
organization, protein trafficking, cellular fusion cell-cell interactions. in
the immune system, cd81 regulates immune synapse, receptor clustering and
signaling; also mediates adaptive innate immune suppression. cd81 a
gateway hepatocytes pathogens hepatitis c virus plasmodium; it
also confers susceptibility listeria infection. diverse biological roles
are due tendency cd81 associate tetraspanins with
cell-specific partner proteins, provide cells signaling
platform. cd81 also shown regulate cell migration invasion, and
has therefore implicated cancer progression. indeed, recently
shown cd81 contributes tumor growth metastasis. cd81 expressed 
most types cancer, including breast, lung, prostate, melanoma, brain cancer
and lymphoma, overexpression down-regulation molecule been
correlated either good bad prognosis. here, discuss role cd81
in cancer potential therapeutic use tumor target.
