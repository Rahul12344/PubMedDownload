malaria one leading parasitic diseases humans caused plasmodium
falciparum. imperative discover novel targets development of
antimalarial drugs. 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase 
(ispd) 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway considered a
second vivo off-target antimalarial drugs discovery essentiality in
malarial parasites devoid mammals. study intended reveal the
molecular basis functional parts inferring diversity, origin and
evolution across important malarial parasites. phylogenetic analyses revealed its
conservation probability sequence homology among bacterial ispd homologs. 
also indicated plasmodium ispd homologs distantly related other
and functional counterparts originated different progenitor genes.
nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferase fold conserved domain might
have evolved green sulphur bacteria, whereas coiled-coil region and
apicoplast targeting signal derived protozoal origins. homologs
contained prospectively definable motifs subject neutral nearly neutral
evolution scale diverged radically subsequently converged in
making spatial structural arrangements. genetic diversity analysis shown 
a constructive signal identifying evolutionary constraints, has
imposed functional divergence malarial parasites. thus, study
provides novel insight understanding molecular basis the
origin evolution history ispd homologs across apicomplexa.
