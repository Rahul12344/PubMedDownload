background: vector control main intervention malaria control and
elimination strategies. however, development insecticide resistance one
of major challenges controlling malaria vectors. anopheles arabiensis
populations ethiopia showed resistance ddt pyrethroid
deltamethrin. although l1014f target-site resistance mutation present in
the voltage gated sodium channel investigated populations, levels of
resistance indicated presence additional resistance mechanisms. this
study, used genome-wide transcriptome profiling rnaseq assess
differentially expressed genes three deltamethrin ddt resistant an.
arabiensis field populations - asendabo, chewaka tolay - and two susceptible 
strains - sekoru mozambique.
results: rnaseq analysis rt-qpcr showed a
glutathione-s-transferase, gstd3, cytochrome p450 monooxygenase, cyp6p4,
were significantly overexpressed group resistant populations compared
to susceptible strains, suggesting enzymes encode play key
role metabolic resistance deltamethrin ddt. furthermore, gene
ontology enrichment analysis showed expression changes cuticle related
genes strongly associated insecticide resistance. although not
translate increased thickness procuticle, higher cuticular
hydrocarbon content observed resistant population.
conclusion: transcriptome sequencing deltamethrin ddt resistant an.
arabiensis populations ethiopia suggests non-target site resistance
mechanisms paves way investigation role cuticle
