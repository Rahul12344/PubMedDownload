extra-chromosomal (ec) dnas genetic elements exist separately the
genome. since ecdna carry beneficial genes, powerful adaptive
mechanism cancers many pathogens. first time, report ecdna
contributing antimalarial resistance plasmodium falciparum, most
virulent human malaria parasite. using pulse field gel electrophoresis combined
with pcr-based copy number analysis, detected two ecdna elements differ
in migration structure. entrapment electrophoresis well low
susceptibility exonucleases revealed biologically relevant ecdna
element large complex structure. using deep sequencing, show that
ecdna originates chromosome expansion ecdna-specific sequence 
may improve segregation expression. speculate ecdna maintained 
using established mechanisms due shared characteristics mitochondrial
genome. implications ecdna discovery organism wide-reaching due to
the potential new strategies target resistance development.
