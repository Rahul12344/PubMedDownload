transmission malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum human 
mosquito initiated specialized sexual cells, gametocytes. human,
gametocytes formed response stress signals following uptake a
blood-feeding anopheles mosquito initiate sexual reproduction. gametocytes need
to fine-tune gene expression order develop inside mosquito to
continue life-cycle progression. previously, showed post-translational
histone acetylation controls gene expression gametocyte development and
transmission. however, role histone methylation remains poorly understood.
we use histone g9a methyltransferase inhibitor bix-01294 investigate 
the role histone methylation regulating gene expression gametocytes. 
vitro assays demonstrated bix-01294 inhibits intraerythrocytic replication
with half maximal inhibitory concentration (ic50) 13.0 nm. furthermore,
bix-01294 significantly impairs gametocyte maturation reduces formation
of gametes zygotes. comparative transcriptomics bix-01294-treated and
untreated immature, mature activated gametocytes demonstrated greater than
1.5-fold deregulation approximately 359 genes. majority genes are
transcriptionally downregulated activated gametocytes could be
assigned transcription, translation, signaling, indicating contribution 
of histone methylations mediating gametogenesis. combined data show that
inhibitors histone methylation may serve multi-stage antimalarial.
