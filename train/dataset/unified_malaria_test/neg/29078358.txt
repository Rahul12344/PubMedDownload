during malaria blood-stage infections, plasmodium parasites interact rbc
surface enable invasion followed intracellular proliferation. critical
factors involved invasion identified using biochemical genetic
approaches including specific knockdowns genes interest primary cd34+ 
hematopoietic stem cells (crbcs). report development robust in
vitro culture system produce rbcs allow generation gene knockouts 
via crispr/cas9 using immortal jk-1 erythroleukemia line. jk-1 cells
spontaneously differentiate, generating cells different stages of
erythropoiesis, including terminally differentiated nucleated rbcs term
"jkrbcs." screen small-molecule epigenetic regulators identified several
bromodomain-specific inhibitors promote differentiation enable
production synchronous populations jkrbcs. global surface proteomic
profiling revealed jkrbcs express known pfalciparum host receptors 
similar fashion crbcs multiple pfalciparum strains invade jkrbcs at
comparable levels crbcs rbcs. using crispr/cas9, deleted two host
factors, basigin (bsg) cd44, natural nulls exist. bsg interacts 
with parasite ligand rh5, prominent vaccine candidate. bsg knockout was
completely refractory parasite invasion strain-transcendent manner,
confirming essential role bsg invasion. cd44 recently
identified rnai screen blood group genes host factor invasion, 
and show cd44 knockout results strain-transcendent reduction in
invasion. furthermore, demonstrate functional interaction two 
determinants mediating pfalciparum erythrocyte invasion.
