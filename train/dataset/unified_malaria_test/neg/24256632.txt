objective: evaluate systemic murine malarial infection enhances hiv
susceptibility parasite-induced mucosal immune alterations sites of
hiv sexual exposure.
background: malaria hiv high degree geographical overlap and
interact substantially within coinfected individuals. used murine model to
test hypothesis malaria might also enhance hiv susceptibility mucosal
sites hiv sexual exposure.
methods: female c57/bl6 mice infected plasmodium chabaudi malaria using
a standardized protocol. blood, gastrointestinal tissues, upper lower genital
tract tissues, iliac lymph nodes sampled 10 days postinfection, 
expression putative hiv susceptibility immune activation markers t
cells assessed flow cytometry.
results: p. chabaudi malaria increased expression mucosal homing integrin α4β7
on blood cd4 cd8 cells, α4β7 cells significantly increased 
co-expression ccr5 cd38. addition, malaria increased expression of
the hiv co-receptor ccr5 cd4 cells genital tract gut mucosa 
well mucosal t-cell expression immune activation markers cd38, major
histocompatibility complex -ii (mhc-ii) cd69.
conclusions: systemic murine malarial infection induced substantial upregulation 
of mucosal homing integrin α4β7 blood well gut genital mucosal
t-cell immune activation hiv co-receptor expression. human studies are
required confirm murine findings examine whether malarial
infection enhances sexual acquisition hiv.
