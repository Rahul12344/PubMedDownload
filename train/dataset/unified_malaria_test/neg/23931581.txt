the biggest threat war malaria continued evolution drug
resistance parasite. resistance almost currently available
antimalarials exists plasmodium falciparum causes suffering
among human malaria parasites. monitoring antimalarial efficacy the
development subsequent spread resistance become important part in
the treatment control malaria. recent reports reduced efficacy 
artemisinin, current recommended treatment uncomplicated malaria, there
is urgent need better methods recognize monitor drug resistance for
effective treatment. molecular markers become welcome addition to
complement laborious costly vitro vivo methods have
traditionally used monitor drug resistance. however, currently 
no molecular markers resistance antimalarials. review highlights
the role various genetic genomic approaches used in
identifying molecular markers underlie drug resistance p. falciparum.
these approaches include; candidate genes, genetic linkage genome-wide
association studies. discuss requirements limitations approach
and use various examples illustrate contributions identifying genomic
regions parasite associated antimalarial drug responses.
