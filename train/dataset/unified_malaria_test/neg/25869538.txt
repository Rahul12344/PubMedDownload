objectives: pfs48/45 pfs230 plasmodium falciparum sexual stage proteins
and promising malaria transmission-blocking vaccine candidates. antibody
responses proteins may naturally acquired target antigens
may selective pressure. consequences future evaluation 
of vaccine immunogenicity efficacy populations naturally exposed to
malaria.
methods: determined naturally acquired antibody responses recombinant
proteins pfs48/45-10c pfs230-230cmb children three malaria endemic
settings ghana, tanzania burkina faso. also examined genetic
polymorphisms p. falciparum gene pfs48/45.
results: antibody prevalence 1.1-18.2% 10c 6.7-18.9% 230cmb. in
burkina faso observed evidence age-dependent acquisition pattern for
both 10c (p < 0.001) 230cmb (p = 0.031). membrane feeding assays a
separate dataset demonstrated association functional transmission
reducing activity antibody prevalence 10c (p = 0.017) 230cmb
(p = 0.049). 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms found pfs48/45 (from 126 
samples), 5 non-synonymous snps pfs48/45 10c region.
conclusions: conclude naturally acquired antibody responses 
vaccine candidates functional relevance reducing the
transmissibility infected individuals. identified genetic polymorphisms, in
pfs48/45 exhibited geographical specificity.
