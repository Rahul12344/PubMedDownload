background: multicellular organisms, alternative splicing central tissue
differentiation identity. unicellular protists lack multicellular tissue 
differentiate variable cell types life cycles. role of
alternative splicing transitions cell types establishing cellular 
identity currently unknown unicellular organism.
results: test whether alternative splicing unicellular protists plays a
role cellular differentiation, conduct rna-seq compare splicing in
female male sexual stages asexual intraerythrocytic stages rodent
malaria parasite plasmodium berghei. find extensive changes alternative
splicing stages role alternative splicing sexual
differentiation. previously, general gametocyte differentiation shown be
modulated specific transcription factors. here, show alternative
splicing establishes subsequent layer regulation, controlling genes relating
to consequent sex-specific differentiation gametocytes.
conclusions: demonstrate alternative splicing reprogrammed during
cellular differentiation unicellular protist. disruption alternative
splicing factor, pbsr-mg, perturbs sex-specific alternative splicing and
decreases ability parasites differentiate male gametes and
oocysts, thereby reducing transmission vertebrate insect hosts. our
results reveal alternative splicing integral, stage-specific phenomenon 
these protists regulator cellular differentiation arose early in
eukaryotic evolution.
