to able robustly propagate p. falciparum optimal conditions vitro 
of fundamental importance genotypic phenotypic studies both
established fresh clinical isolates. cryo-preserved p. falciparum isolates
from ugandan children severe uncomplicated malaria investigated 
parasite phenotypes different vitro growth conditions studied
directly peripheral blood. parasite cultures showed minimal loss
of parasite-mass preserved percentage multiple infected prbcs in
peripheral blood, maintained adhesive phenotypes good outgrowth and
multiplication rates grown suspension supplemented gas. in
contrast, abnormal greatly fluctuating levels multiple infections were
observed static growth conditions outgrowth multiplication rates
were inferior. serum, compared albumax, found necessary optimal
presentation pfemp1 prbc surface and/or binding serum proteins
(immunoglobulins). optimal vitro growth conditions p. falciparum therefore 
include orbital shaking (50 rev/min), human serum (10%) fixed gas
composition (5% o2, 5% co2, 90% n2). subsequently established 100% 76
frozen patient isolates found rosetting schizont prbcs every isolate 
(>26% schizont rosetting rate). rosetting schizogony often followed by
invasion bound rbc seen regular time-lapse microscopy well as
transmission electron microscopy. peripheral parasitemia, level of
rosetting rate multiplication correlated positively one another for
individual isolates. rosetting also frequent trophozoite and
schizont prbcs children severe versus uncomplicated malaria (p<0.002;
p<0.004). associations suggest rosetting enhances ability the
parasite multiply within human host.
