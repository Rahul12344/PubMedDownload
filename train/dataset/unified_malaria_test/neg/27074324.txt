only small percentage individuals living endemic areas develop severe
malaria suggesting host genetic factors may play key role. study 
determined frequency single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) pro
and anti-inflammatory cytokine gene sequences: il6 (-174; rs1800795), il12p40
(+1188; rs3212227), il4 (+33; rs2070874), il10 (-3575; rs1800890) tgfb1
(+869; rs1800470), means pcr-rflp. blood samples collected 104
symptomatic 37 asymptomatic subjects. laboratory diagnosis assessed by
the thick blood smear test nested-pcr. association found il6
(-174), il12p40 (+1188), il4 (+33), il10 (- 3575), tgfb1 (+869) snps malaria 
symptoms. however, regarding il10 -3575 t/a snp, significantly
more aa subjects, carrying polymorphic allele a, symptomatic
group (c2 = 4.54, p = 0.01, = 0.40 [95% ci - 0.17- 0.94]). analysis
was performed allele, frequency polymorphic allele also
significantly higher symptomatic group (c2 = 4.50, p = 0.01, = 0.45
[95% ci - 0.21-0.95]). conclusion, study suggested possibility
that il10 - 3575 t/a snp might associated presence and
maintenance malaria symptoms individuals living endemic areas. taking
into account polymorphism related decreased il10 production, a
possible role snp pathophysiology malaria also suggested,
but replication studies higher number patients evaluation il10
levels needed confirmation.
