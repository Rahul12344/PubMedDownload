resistance pathogens drugs growing concern regarding many diseases.
parasites like leishmania, plasmodium entamoeba histolytica; neoplastic
cells, present multidrug-resistant phenotype rendering chemotherapy
ineffective. acquired resistance leishmania antimony generated
intense research mechanisms involved question yet been
resolved. test hypothesis drug efflux leishmania, measured by
flow cytometry using fluorescent dye rhodamine-123, largely dependent on
the number efflux pumps isolate express, amount pgp 170
molecules assessed ten field isolates (5 "resistant" 5 "susceptible") 
using: western blotting, confocal transmission electron microscopy, and
proteomics. survival exposure three antileishmanial drugs, in
vitro, evaluated clinical data compared vitro results. all
isolates resistant glucantime susceptible miltefosine, whilst
amphotericin b effective "susceptible" isolates. mdr gene,
expressing transmembrane efflux pump pgp 170, appears play key role in
the phenomenon drug resistance. "susceptible" versus "resistant"
parasites compared, shown higher number pgp 170
molecules higher rhodamine-123 efflux parasite body and, when
exposed drug, number efflux pumps increased. however, rate of
this increase linear possible maximum number of
pgp 170 molecules isolate express. nevertheless, phenomenon a
complex one factors proteins involved hsp-70 group
proteins, detected "resistant" isolates, may play significant role.
