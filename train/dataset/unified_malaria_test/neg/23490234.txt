rhomboid-like proteases cleave membrane-anchored proteins within their
transmembrane domains. apicomplexan parasites substrates include molecules
that function parasite motility host cell invasion. two plasmodium
rhomboids, rom1 rom4, examined, roles remaining six
rhomboids malaria parasite's life cycle unknown. present
systematic gene deletion analyses eight plasmodium rhomboid-like proteins 
as means discover stage-specific phenotypes potential functions the
rodent malaria model, p. berghei. four rhomboids (rom4, 6, 7 8) are
refractory gene deletion, suggesting essential role asexual blood
stage development. contrast rom1, 3, 9 10 dispensable blood stage
development exhibited no, subtle severe defects mosquito liver
development. parasites lacking rom9 rom10 showed major phenotypic defects.
parasites lacking rom1 presented delay blood stage patency following liver
infection, contrast previous study blood stage parasites similar 
growth virulence characteristics wild type parasites. parasites lacking
rom3 mosquitoes readily established oocysts failed produce sporozoites.
rom3 first apicomplexan rhomboid identified play vital role in
sporogony.
