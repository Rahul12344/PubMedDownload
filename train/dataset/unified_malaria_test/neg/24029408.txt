background: immunization genetically engineered, attenuated malaria
parasites (gap) arrest liver infection confers sterile protection 
mouse malaria models. first generation plasmodium falciparum gap (pf
p52(-)/p36(-) gap) previously generated deletion two pre-erythrocytic
stage-expressed genes (p52 p36) nf54 strain.
methods: first-in-human, proof-of-concept, safety immunogenicity clinical
trial six human volunteers conducted. exposure consisted delivery pf
p52(-)/p36(-) gap sporozoites via infected anopheles mosquito bite a
five-bite/volunteer exposure followed approximately 200-bite
exposure/volunteer one month later.
results: exposures well tolerated mild moderate local and
systemic reactions. volunteers remained blood stage negative low dose
exposure. five volunteers remained blood stage negative high dose exposure.
one volunteer developed peripheral parasitemia twelve days high dose
exposure. together findings indicate pf p52(-)/p36(-) gap severely
but completely attenuated. six volunteers developed antibodies csp.
furthermore, ifn-γ responses whole sporozoites multiple antigens were
elicited 5 6 volunteers, cd4 cd8 cell cytokine production
detected.
conclusion: severe attenuation favorable immune responses following
administration first generation pf p52(-)/p36(-) gap suggests further
development live-attenuated strains using genetic engineering be
pursued.
