mosquitoes transmit many deadly infectious diseases also need keep
fighting many microbial infections. constitutive expression multiple
antimicrobial peptides (amps) almost body tissues believed to
facilitate effective management local infections. infection
breaches local barrier, amps induced rapidly non-target tissues such
as hemocytes (hcs) establish co-ordination systemic immune
effectors clear body infection. interorgan immune
communication managed local systemic infections remain largely
unknown. understand interorgan molecular relationship, identified,
extensively profiled compared expression amps three important
mosquito tissues viz. midgut, fat body (fb), hcs. dsrna-mediated amps
silencing suggests mosquito tissues able manage optimal expression
of amps physiological level. also examined possible contribution of
two important immune regulator genes relish (rel) nitric oxide synthase,
controlling amps expression tissues local systemic infections.
we show tissue unique ability respond local/systemic
challenges, hcs specialized recognize discriminate-specific
antigens gut fb. investigation also revealed rel no

flow signals. knowledge, first large-scale study examining 
the interorgan immune relationship mosquito.
