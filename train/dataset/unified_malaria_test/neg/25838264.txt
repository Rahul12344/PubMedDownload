background: plasmodium falciparum invades human erythrocytes using array of
ligands interact several receptors, including sialic acid (sa),
complement receptor 1 (cr1), basigin. hypothesized malaria-endemic
areas, parasites vary invasion pathways immune pressure. therefore,
invasion mechanisms clinical isolates collected 3 zones ghana with
different levels endemicity (from lowest highest, accra, navrongo, and
kintampo) compared using standardized methods.
methods: blood samples collected children aged 2-14 years whom
malaria diagnosed, erythrocyte invasion phenotypes determined using 
the enzymes neuraminidase, chymotrypsin, trypsin, differentially cleave
receptors erythrocyte surface. addition, antibodies cr1 and
basigin used determine contributions receptors invasion. 
gene expression levels p. falciparum invasion ligands also examined.
results: parasites generally expressed sa-independent invasion phenotypes
across malaria-endemic areas, parasites kintampo showing the
highest invasion rates neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes. cr1 major
mediator sa-independent invasion, basigin essential both
sa-dependent sa-independent invasion mechanisms. furthermore, expression of
the basigin ligand pfrh5 best predictor donor parasitemia.
conclusions: erythrocyte invasion phenotypes expressed p. falciparum are
influenced endemicity levels, pfrh5-basigin pathway potential
vaccine target.
