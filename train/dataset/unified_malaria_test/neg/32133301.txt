ticks hematophagous arthropods transmit number pathogens while
feeding. among tick-borne encephalitis virus (tbev), flavivirus
transmitted ixodes ricinus ticks temperate zone europe. the
infection results febrile illness progressing encephalitis meningitis
with possibility fatality long-term neurological sequelae. the
composition tick saliva plays essential role initial virus
transmission tick feeding. ticks secrete diverse range salivary
proteins modulate host response, lipocalins control itch
and inflammatory response, proteases protease inhibitors prevent 
blood coagulation. here, effect viral infection adult females ixodes
ricinus studied goal determining virus alters tick
sialome modulate host tissue response site infection. uninfected
ticks infected tbev fed mice removed dissected one-
and 3-h post-attachment. rna salivary glands ticks, well 
from unfed ticks, extracted subjected next-generation sequencing to
determine expression key secreted proteins timepoint. genes
showing statistically significant up- down-regulation infected and
control ticks selected compared published literature ascertain
their function. this, effect tick viral infection modulation
of tick-host interface determined. infected ticks found to
differentially express number uncategorized genes, proteases, kunitz-type
serine protease inhibitors, cytotoxins, lipocalins different timepoints.
these virus-induced changes tick sialome may play significant role in
facilitating virus transmission early stages tick feeding.
