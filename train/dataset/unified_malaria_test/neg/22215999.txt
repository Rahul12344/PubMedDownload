genes underlying important phenotypic differences plasmodium species, the
causative agents malaria, frequently found subset species and
cluster dynamically evolving subtelomeric regions chromosomes. we
hypothesized chromosome-internal regions plasmodium genomes harbour
additional species subset-specific genes underlie differences human
pathogenicity, human-to-human transmissibility, human virulence. combined 
sequence similarity searches synteny block analyses identify species
subset-specific genes chromosome-internal regions six published plasmodium 
genomes, including plasmodium falciparum, plasmodium vivax, plasmodium knowlesi, 
plasmodium yoelii, plasmodium berghei, plasmodium chabaudi. improve
comparative analysis, first revised incorrectly annotated gene models using
homology-based gene finders examined putative subset-specific genes within
syntenic contexts. confirmed subset-specific genes analyzed their
role biological pathways examined molecular functions using publicly
available databases. identified 16 genes well conserved three 
primate parasites found rodent parasites, including three key enzymes 
of thiamine (vitamin b1) biosynthesis pathway. thirteen genes found to
be present human parasites absent monkey parasite p. knowlesi,
including genes specifically upregulated sporozoites gametocytes could
be linked parasite transmission success humans. furthermore, we
propose 15 chromosome-internal p. falciparum-specific genes new candidate
genes underlying increased human virulence detected currently
uncharacterized cluster p. vivax-specific genes chromosome 6 likely
involved erythrocyte invasion. conclusion, plasmodium species harbour many 
chromosome-internal differences form protein-coding genes, of
which potentially linked human disease thus promising leads future
laboratory research.
