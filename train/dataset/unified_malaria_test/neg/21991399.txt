background: exacting nutritional requirements complicated life cycles 
parasites mean always amenable high-throughput drug
screening using automated procedures. therefore, engineered yeast
saccharomyces cerevisiae act surrogate expressing anti-parasitic
targets range biomedically important pathogens, facilitate rapid
identification new therapeutic agents.
methodology/principal findings: using pyrimethamine/dihydrofolate reductase
(dhfr) model parasite drug/drug target system, explore potential of
engineered yeast strains (expressing dhfr enzymes plasmodium falciparum, p. 
vivax, homo sapiens, schistosoma mansoni, leishmania major, trypanosoma brucei
and t. cruzi) exhibit appropriate differential sensitivity pyrimethamine.
here, demonstrate yeast strains (lacking major drug efflux pump,
pdr5p) expressing yeast ((sc)dfr1), human ((hs)dhfr), schistosoma ((sm)dhfr), and
trypanosoma ((tb)dhfr (tc)dhfr) dhfrs insensitive pyrimethamine
treatment, whereas yeast strains producing plasmodium ((pf)dhfr (pv)dhfr)
dhfrs hypersensitive. reassuringly, yeast strains expressing field-verified, 
drug-resistant mutants p. falciparum dhfr ((pf)dhfr(51i,59r,108n)) are
completely insensitive pyrimethamine, validating approach drug 
screening. show versatility approach replacing yeast
essential genes potential drug targets, namely phosphoglycerate
kinases (pgks) n-myristoyl transferases (nmts).
conclusions/significance: generated number yeast strains be
successfully harnessed rapid selective identification urgently
needed anti-parasitic agents.
