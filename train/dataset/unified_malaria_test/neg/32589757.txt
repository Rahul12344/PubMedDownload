glandular secretory trichomes (gsts) regarded biofactories for
synthesizing, storing, secreting artemisinin. necessary figure out
the initiation development regulatory mechanism gsts cultivate
high-yielding artemisia annua. here, identified myb transcription factor,
aatar2, bioinformatics analysis a. annua genome database and
arabidopsis trichome development-related genes. aatar2 mainly expressed in
young leaves located nucleus. repression overexpression aatar2 
resulted decrease increase, respectively, gsts numbers, leaf
biomass, artemisinin content transgenic plants. furthermore, the
morphological characteristics changed obviously trichomes, suggesting aatar2
plays key role trichome formation. addition, expression flavonoid 
biosynthesis genes total flavonoid content increased dramatically in
aatar2-overexpressing transgenic plants. owing flavonoids possibly
counteracting emerging resistance artemisinin plasmodium species, aatar2 is
a potential target improve effect artemisinin clinical therapy.
taken together, aatar2 positively regulates trichome development artemisinin 
and flavonoid biosynthesis. better understanding 'multiple functions'
transcription factor may enable enhanced artemisinin flavonoids yield. aatar2
is potential breeding target cultivating high-quality a. annua.
