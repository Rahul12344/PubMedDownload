avian haemosporidians common vector-borne blood parasites been
reported birds world. investigations avian haemosporidian
parasites conducted mainly passerine birds. however, studies focus on
non-passerine avian hosts important understanding true
diversity, host specificity genetic variability among widespread
parasites. present study, blood samples total 22 raptor birds
belonging two orders, two families six species central anatolia
region turkey investigated three genera avian haemosporidians
(plasmodium marchiafava et celli, 1885, haemoproteus kruse, 1890 and
leucocytozoon sambon, 1908) using combination microscopic examination of
blood films nested pcr targeting parasite mitochondrial cytochrome b gene
(cyt-b). total, six individual raptor birds identified positive species of
plasmodium leucocytozoon one individual found co-infected all
three haemosporidian genera. identified five parasite cyt-b haplotypes, three 
of reported first time. among these, one plasmodium haplotype 
is linked corresponding morphospecies (p-turdus1, plasmodium circumflexum
kikuth, 1931). haplotypes clearly distinguishable phylogenetic
analyses. one first studies investigate blood parasites from
non-passerine birds central anatolia region turkey, study provides
important new information phylogenetic relationships genetic diversity
of avian haemosporidian parasites raptor birds. discuss findings in
the context avian haemosporidian host-parasite relationships draw
attention need microscopy detect parasite sexual development stages
in surveys avian haemosporidians.
