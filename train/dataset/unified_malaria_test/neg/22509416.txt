background: order control malaria, important understand the
genetic structure parasites endemic area. plasmodium vivax is
widely distributed tropical temperate regions asia south
america, effective strategies elimination yet designed. in
south korea, example, indigenous vivax malaria eliminated late
1970s, re-emerged 1993. estimated population structure and
temporal dynamics transmission p. vivax south korea using microsatellite
dna markers.
methodology/principal findings: analyzed 255 south korean p. vivax isolates
collected 1994 2008, based 10 highly polymorphic microsatellite dna
loci p. vivax genome. allelic data obtained 87 isolates and
their microsatellite haplotypes determined based combination allelic
data loci. total, 40 haplotypes observed. two
predominant haplotypes: h16 h25. h16 observed 9 isolates (10%) from
1996 2005, h25 27 (31%) 1995 2003. results suggested that
the recombination rate p. vivax south korea, temperate country, lower
than tropical areas identical haplotypes rarely seen the
following year. next, estimated relationships among 40 haplotypes by
eburst analysis. two major groups found: one composed 36 isolates (41%)
including h25; 20 isolates (23%) including h16. despite low
recombination rate, new haplotypes genetically distinct 2
groups also observed since 1997 (h27).
conclusions/significance: results suggested continual introduction p. 
vivax population sources, probably north korea. molecular epidemiology
using microsatellite dna p. vivax population effective assessing
the population structure transmission dynamics parasites--information 
that assist elimination vivax malaria endemic areas.
