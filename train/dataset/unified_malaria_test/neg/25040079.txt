the anopheles gambiae complex mosquitoes includes malaria vectors different
stages speciation, whose study enables better understanding how
adaptation divergent environmental conditions leads evolution of
reproductive isolation. investigated population genetic structure of
closely related sympatric taxa recently proposed separate
species (an. coluzzii an. gambiae), sampled diverse habitats along the
gambia river west africa. characterized putatively neutral microsatellite
loci well chromosomal inversion polymorphisms known associated with
ecological adaptation. results revealed strong ecologically associated
population subdivisions within species. microsatellite loci chromosome-3l
revealed clear differentiation coastal inland populations, in
an. coluzzii reinforced unusual inversion polymorphism pattern,
supporting hypothesis genetic divergence driven adaptation the
coastal habitat. strong reduction gene flow observed an. gambiae
populations west east extensively rice-cultivated region apparently
colonized exclusively an. coluzzii. notably, 'intraspecific'
differentiation higher observed two species involves
also centromeric region chromosome-x previously considered 
a marker speciation within complex, possibly suggesting two
populations may advanced stage differentiation triggered by
human-made habitat fragmentation. results confirm ongoing ecological
speciation within important afro-tropical malaria vectors raise
new questions possible effect process malaria transmission.
