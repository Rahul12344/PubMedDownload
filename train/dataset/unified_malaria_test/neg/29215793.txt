from biogeographic perspective, africa subdivided distinct horizontal
belts. human populations living along sahel/savannah belt south sahara
desert often overshadowed extensive studies focusing other
african populations hunter-gatherers bantu particular. however, the
sahel together savannah bordering south challenging
region people still cope harsh climatic conditions and
show resilient behaviours. besides exponentially growing urban populations,
several local groups leading various lifestyles speaking languages belonging 
to three main linguistic families still live rural localities across that
region today. thanks several years consistent population sampling
throughout area, genetic history african sahelian populations has
been largely reconstructed deeper knowledge acquired regarding
their adaptation peculiar environments and/or subsistence modes. distinct
exposures pathogens-in particular, malaria-likely contributed genetic
differentiation hla genes. addition, although food-producing strategies
spread within sahel/savannah belt relatively recently, last five
millennia according recent archaeological archaeobotanical studies,
remarkable amounts genetic differences also observed sedentary
farmers mobile pastoralists multiple neutral selected loci,
reflecting demographic effects genetic adaptations distinct cultural 
traits, dietary habits.
