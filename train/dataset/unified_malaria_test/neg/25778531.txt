plasmodium falciparum invasion human red blood cells (rbcs) intricate
process requiring number distinct ligand-receptor interactions the
merozoite-erythrocyte interface. merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1), highly
abundant ligand coating merozoite surface species malaria
parasites, essential rbc invasion considered leading candidate for
inclusion multiple-subunit vaccine malaria. previous studies
identified interaction carboxyl-terminus msp1 rbc band 3.
here, employing phage display technology, report novel interaction
between amino-terminus msp1 rbc glycophorin (gpa). mapping the
binding domains established direct interaction malaria msp1 human
gpa within region msp1 known potently inhibit p falciparum invasion of
human rbcs. furthermore, genetically modified mouse model lacking gpa- band
3 complex rbcs completely resistant malaria infection vivo. these
findings suggest essential role msp1-gpa-band 3 complex the
initial adhesion phase malaria parasite invasion rbcs.
