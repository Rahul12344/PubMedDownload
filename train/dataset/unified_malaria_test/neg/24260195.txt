background: fmp2.1/as02a candidate malaria vaccine tested phase 2
study mali. based results first eight months follow-up, the
vaccine appeared well-tolerated immunogenic. significant efficacy
based primary endpoint, clinical malaria, marginal efficacy against
clinical malaria secondary analyses, high allele-specific efficacy.
extended follow-up conducted evaluate extended safety, immunogenicity 
efficacy.
methods: randomized, double-blinded trial safety, immunogenicity and
efficacy candidate plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (ama1) 
vaccine fmp2.1/as02a conducted bandiagara, mali. children aged 1-6 years
were randomized 1∶1 ratio receive fmp2.1/as02a control rabies vaccine 
on days 0, 30 60. using active passive surveillance, clinical malaria and
adverse events well antibodies p. falciparum ama1 monitored
for 24 months first vaccination, spanning two malaria seasons.
findings: 400 children enrolled. serious adverse events occurred nine
participants fmp2.1/as02a group three control group; none was
considered related study vaccination. two years, anti-ama1 immune
responses remained significantly higher fmp2.1/as02a group the
control group. entire 24-month follow-up period, vaccine efficacy was
7.6% (p = 0.51) first clinical malaria episodes 9.9% (p = 0.19)
against malaria episodes. final 16-month follow-up period, vaccine
efficacy 0.9% (p = 0.98) malaria episodes. allele-specific
efficacy seen first malaria season extend second season
of follow-up.
interpretation: allele-specific vaccine efficacy sustained second 
malaria season, despite continued high levels anti-ama1 antibodies. study
presents opportunity evaluate correlates partial protection against
clinical malaria waned second malaria season.
