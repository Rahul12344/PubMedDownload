the innate immune system governed toll-like receptors (tlrs) provides the
first line defense pathogens. surface-localized tlr1 tlr6 are
known detect parasite components. tlr encoding genes shown display
signatures recent positive selection europeans might involved in
local adaptation immune-related genes. verify influence brazilian
population admixture distribution polymorphisms tlrs, analyzed
the genotype frequencies 24 polymorphisms distributed across five tlr genes in
a southeastern brazilian population autochthonous cases malaria occur in
small foci transmission. estimation ancestry showed mainly european
ancestry (63%) followed african ancestry (22%). mean proportions european
ancestry differed significantly genotypes tlr1 (i602s) gene
and tlr6 (p249s) gene. chance g allele tlr1 gene
increases european ancestry increases well chance t
allele tlr6 gene. 602s allele related ''hypo-responsiveness'' 
possibly explaining high prevalence asymptomatic malaria cases areas of
southeastern brazil. results underline necessity include informative
ancestry markers genetic association studies order avoid biased results.
