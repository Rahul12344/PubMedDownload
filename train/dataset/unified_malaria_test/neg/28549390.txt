the spread p. falciparum resistant strain led significant resurgence 
of malaria morbidity mortality. current cornerstone malaria treatment 
in india artemisinin based combination
(artesunate + sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine) therapy (act) treatment of
uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria since 2010. present study assessed 
the therapeutic efficacy act molecular monitoring antimalarial
resistance. therapeutic efficacy determined vivo method using 28 days
follow-up. molecular genotyping dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr),
dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) kelch13 genes analyzed. msp-1 msp-2 
genotyping used differentiate recrudescence. therapeutic efficacy act 
was determined 237 patients three year period. patients
showed adequate clinical parasitological response (99.6%). molecular study
revealed 72% parasites mutant genotype (27.2% single mutants, 43.5% 
double mutants 1.3% triple mutants) pfdhfr pfdhps showed 78.2% wild
type alleles 21.8% mutants (18.1% single mutants 3.7% double mutants).
analysis total 135 samples revealed mutation k13 gene along with
non-synonymous single mutation codon m579t (1.5%) double mutations at
codon m579t & n657h 37%. act remains effective treatment of
uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria madhya pradesh, central india. however,
increasing mutation pfdhfr (particularly triple mutations) pfdhps may
reduce susceptibility partner drug sp mutation k13 propeller gene,
highlighting need continuous monitoring efficacy act.
