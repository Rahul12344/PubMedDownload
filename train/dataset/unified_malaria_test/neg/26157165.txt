proteins actin-depolymerizing factor (adf)/cofilin family shown 
to crucial motility survival apicomplexan parasites. however,
the mechanisms adf proteins fulfill function remain poorly
understood. study, investigate comparative activities adf
proteins toxoplasma gondii plasmodium falciparum, human malaria
parasite, using conditional t. gondii adf-knockout line complemented adf
variants either species. show p. falciparum adf1 fully restore
native tgadf activity, demonstrating functional conservation parasites.
strikingly, mutation key basic residue (lys-72), previously implicated in
disassembly pfadf1, detectable phenotypic effect parasite growth,
motility, development. contrast, organelle segregation severely
impaired complementing tgadf mutant lacking corresponding residue
(lys-68). biochemical analyses adf protein confirmed reduced ability 
of lysine mutants mediate actin depolymerization via filament disassembly
although severing, contrast previous reports. data suggest that
actin filament disassembly essential apicomplexan parasite development but
not motility, well pointing genus-specific coevolution adf
proteins native actin.
