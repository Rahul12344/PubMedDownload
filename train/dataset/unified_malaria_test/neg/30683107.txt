background: development malaria transmission-blocking strategies including
the generation malaria refractory mosquitoes replace wild populations
through means gene drives hold great promise. standard membrane feeding
assay (smfa) involves mosquito feeding parasitized blood an
artificial membrane system vital tool evaluating efficacy of
transmission-blocking interventions. however, despite availability several
published protocols, smfa remains highly variable broadly insensitive.
methods: smfa protocol optimized coordinated culturing of
anopheles coluzzii mosquitoes plasmodium falciparum parasite coupled with
placing mosquitoes strict dark regime before, during, the
gametocyte feed.
results: detailed description essential steps provided toward
synchronized generation highly fit an. coluzzii mosquitoes p. falciparum
gametocytes preparation smfa. dark-infection regime emulates the
natural vector-parasite interaction system described, results a
significant increase infection intensity prevalence. using this
optimal smfa pipeline, series putative transmission-blocking antimicrobial
peptides (amps) screened, confirming melittin magainin can
interfere p. falciparum development vector.
conclusion: robust smfa protocol enhances evaluation interventions 
targeting human malaria transmission laboratory setting reported. melittin 
and magainin identified highly potent antiparasitic amps used 
for generation refractory anopheles gambiae mosquitoes.
