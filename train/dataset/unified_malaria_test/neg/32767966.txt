background: asian tiger mosquito, aedes albopictus, highly dangerous
invasive vector numerous medically important arboviruses including dengue,
chikungunya zika. four decades spread tropical southeast asia 
to many parts world tropical temperate climes. rapid
invasion process mosquito supported high ecological genetic
plasticity across different life history traits. aim investigate
whether wild populations, native adventive, also display transcriptional
genetic variability functions may impact biology, behaviour and
ability transmit arboviruses, sensory perception.
results: antennal transcriptome data derived mosquitoes native
population ban rai, thailand three adventive mediterranean
populations: athens, greece arco trento italy. clear
inter-population differential transcriptional activity observed different 
gene categories related sound perception, olfaction viral infection. the
greatest differences detected native thai mediterranean 
populations. two italian populations similar. nearly one
million quality filtered snp loci identified.
conclusion: ability express great inter-population transcriptional
variability highlights, functional level, remarkable genetic
flexibility mosquito species. hypothesize differential
expression genes, including involved sensory perception, different
populations may enable ae. albopictus exploit different environments and
hosts, thus contributing status global vector arboviruses of
public health importance. large number snp loci present these
transcripts represents useful addition arsenal high-resolution
molecular markers resource used detect selective pressure
and adaptive changes may occurred colonization process.
