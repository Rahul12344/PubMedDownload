successful infection insect body entomopathogenic fungi result
of complex molecular interactions host invading pathogenic
fungi. mosquito antifungal response multifaceted regulated part 
by toll jak-stat pathways. here, assessed role imd pathway 
in mosquito ae. aegypti antifungal immune response challenged one
of two entomopathogenic fungi, beauveria bassiana isaria javanica. imd
pathway components mosquito immune system elicited response to
infection entomopathogenic fungi, primarily fat body of
mosquitoes. furthermore, observed induction antimicrobial peptides 
turn appear tissue fungal strain-specific. imd pathway impairment by
rnai gene silencing resulted higher fungal proliferation reduction in
survival fungi-infected mosquitoes. collectively, data indicates that
the imd pathway plays significant role antifungal immune response
than previously recognized.
