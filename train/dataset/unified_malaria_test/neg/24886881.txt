artemisinin used treat malaria centuries context of
traditional chinese medicine. present study, effects artemisinin on
pregnane x receptor (pxr)-mediated cyp3a expression therapeutic role in
inflammatory bowel disease investigated. ls174t cells exposed artemisinin
at various concentrations different periods time examined with
respect specific induction cyp3a4 pxr mrna expression. transient
transfection experiments showed transcriptional activation cyp3a4 gene
through artemisinin pxr-dependent. electrophoretic-mobility shift assay 
(emsa) showed artemisinin activates dna-binding capacity pxr 
the cyp3a4 element. results indicate induction cyp3a4 by
artemisinin mediated activation pxr. using animal models, it
was demonstrated artemisinin abrogates dextran sulfate sodium (dds)-induced 
intestinal inflammation. preadministration artemisinin ameliorated the
clinical hallmarks colitis dss-treated mice determined body weight
loss assessment diarrhea, rectal bleeding, colon length, histology.
artemisinin found prevent reduce severity colonic inflammation
by inducing cyp3a expression activation pxr.
