until recently, malaria vaccine development efforts focused almost
exclusively handful well characterized plasmodium falciparum antigens.
despite dedicated work many researchers different continents spanning 
than half century, successful malaria vaccine remains elusive. sequencing 
the p. falciparum genome revealed five thousand genes, providing
the foundation systematic approaches discover candidate vaccine antigens. 
we taking advantage wealth information discover new antigens
that may effective vaccine targets. herein, describe different
approaches large-scale screening p. falciparum genome identify
targets either antibody responses cell responses using human specimens
collected controlled human malaria infections (chmi) conditions of
natural exposure field. genome, proteome transcriptome based
approaches offer enormous potential development efficacious malaria
vaccine.
