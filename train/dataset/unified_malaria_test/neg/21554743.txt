background: prevalence drug resistance amongst human malaria
plasmodium species commonly associated genomic mutation within
the parasites. phenomenon necessitates evolutionary predictive studies of
possible resistance mutations, may occur new drug introduced.
therefore, identification possible new plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate
reductase (pfdhfr) mutants confer resistance antifolate drugs is
essential process antifolate anti-malarial drug development.
methods: system identify mutations pfdhfr gene confer antifolate
drug resistance using animal plasmodium parasite model developed. using
error-prone pcr plasmodium transfection technologies, libraries pfdhfr
mutant generated episomally transfected plasmodium berghei
parasites, pyrimethamine-resistant pfdhfr mutants selected.
results: principal mutation found experiment s108n, coincident 
with first pyrimethamine-resistance mutation isolated field. a
transgenic p. berghei, endogenous pbdhfr allele replaced the
mutant pfdhfrs108n, generated confirmed normal growth rate
comparing parental non-transgenic parasite also confer resistance to
pyrimethamine.
conclusion: study demonstrated power transgenic p. berghei system
to predict drug-resistant pfdhfr mutations vivo parasite/host setting.
the system could utilized identification possible novel drug-resistant 
mutants could arise new antifolate compounds prediction 
evolution resistance mutations.
