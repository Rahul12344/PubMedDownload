calcium relevant several vital functions apicomplexan parasites,
including host cell invasion, parasite motility differentiation. er
(endoplasmic reticulum) calcium-rich acidocalcisomes identified 
major calcium stores. potential calcium-storage organelles include the
golgi, mitochondrion, apicoplast recently described plant-like
vacuole toxoplasma gondii. compared eukaryotic systems, apicomplexan
parasites contain reduced number calcium-related genes, vast majority of
which remain uncharacterized. several ca²⁺-atpases described in
apicomplexans, several annotated different genomes. 
experimental evidence ip3 (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate)-dependent calcium
response plasmodium spp. t. gondii, although ip3 ryanodine receptors
have identified. genes encoding potential calcium channels present t.
gondi, plasmodium spp. cryptosporidium spp. effector
calcium-binding proteins including calmodulins cdpk (calcium-dependent
protein kinase) genes mainly found plants also described. the
characterized cdpks found play important roles protein secretion, host
cell invasion parasite differentiation. taken together, available
information calcium storage function apicomplexans, although
fragmented, suggest existence unique calcium-mediated pathways these
parasites. in-depth functional characterization apicomplexan
calcium-related genes could lead identification novel therapeutic
targets, improve understanding role calcium parasite
development virulence.
