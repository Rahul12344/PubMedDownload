ca(2+) contributes myriad important cellular processes organisms, 
including apicomplexans, plasmodium toxoplasma. due varied and
essential roles, free ca(2+) tightly regulated complex mechanisms. these
mechanisms therefore interest putative drug targets. one pathway in
ca(2+) homeostatic control apicomplexans uses ca(2+)/h(+) exchanger (a
member cation exchanger family, cax). p. falciparum cax (pfcax) has
recently characterised asexual blood stage parasites. determine the
physiological importance apicomplexan caxs, tagging knock-out strategies
were undertaken genetically tractable t. gondii p. berghei parasites. 
in addition, yeast heterologous expression system used study the
function apicomplexan caxs. tagging t. gondii p. berghei caxs (tgcax
and pbcax) control endogenous promoters could demonstrate
measureable expression either cax tachyzoites asexual blood stages,
respectively. results consistent ability parasites to

development female gametocytes/gametes, zygotes ookinetes, was
dispersed membranous networks within cytosol (with minimal mitochondrial
localisation). furthermore, genetically disrupted parasites failed develop
further "round" form zygotes, suggesting pbcax essential for
ookinete development differentiation. impeded phenotype could rescued
by removal extracellular ca(2+). therefore, pbcax provides mechanism for
free living parasites multiply within ionic microenvironment the

plasmodial caxs may targeted approaches designed block parasite
