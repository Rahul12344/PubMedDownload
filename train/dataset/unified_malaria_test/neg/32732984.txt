the cattle tick, rhipicephalus microplus, monoxenous tick co-evolved
with indicine cattle indian subcontinent. causes massive damage to
livestock worldwide. cattle breeds present heritable, contrasting phenotypes of
tick loads, taurine breeds carrying higher loads parasite indicine
breeds. thus, useful model available analyze mechanisms determine
outcomes parasitism. sought gain insights mechanisms used
rna sequencing multidimensional protein identification technology (mudpit) to
generate transcriptome whole larvae salivary glands nymphs, males
and females feeding genetically susceptible resistant bovine hosts and
their corresponding proteomes. 931,698 reads annotated 11,676 coding
sequences (cds), manually curated 116 different protein families.
male ticks presented diverse armamentarium mediators parasitism.
in addition, levels expression many genes encoding mediators parasitism 
were significantly associated level stage host immunity and/or
were temporally restricted developmental stages tick. insights
should assist developing novel, sustainable technologies tick control.
