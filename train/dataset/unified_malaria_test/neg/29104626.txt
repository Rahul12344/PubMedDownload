artemether (art), derivative well-known anti-malaria drug artemisinin,
demonstrates potent anti-cancer activity various cancer cells, however its
effects lymphoma remain unknown. present study demonstrated art
significantly inhibited proliferation diffuse large b cell lymphoma (dlbcl) in
vivo vitro, led g0/g1 phase arrest. mechanistic studies
demonstrated art suppressed expression cell cycle proteins cyclin
dependent kinase (cdk) 2, 4, cyclin d1, specifically repressed the
proto-oncogene c-myc, rather regulating extracellular signal-regulated
kinase protein kinase b signaling pathways (two key pathways involved in
regulating cell proliferation). addition, high-concentration art treatment
significantly induced apoptosis dlbcl cells promoting cleavage of
caspase-3 poly (adp-ribose) polymerase (parp) 1. overall, data indicated 
that art exhibited anti-cancer activity inhibiting expression cell
cycle genes c-myc, promoting caspase-3 parp1 cleavage, which
suggested art may serve dual pharmaceutical treatment dlbcl.
