background: vivax malaria prevalent malarious areas iran, which
makes vaccine research high priority. serine repeat antigens (sera) have
essential role parasite life cycle high expression profiles pvsera5
make suitable vaccine candidates. study aimed evaluate genetic
diversity c-terminal region pvsera5 iranian isolates plasmodium vivax
in sistan baluchistan.
methods: totally, 49 blood samples taken symptomatic malaria patients
in sistan baluchistan province 2016. mono-infection p. vivax was
confirmed 18srrna-nested-pcr. genomic dna extracted c-terminal region 
of pvsera5 amplified specific primers. pcr-products sequenced
and analysis done using bioinformatics software, mainly dnasp & mega5.
results: genetic diversity calculated 14.8% c-terminal region pvsera5
in iranian isolates, 19 different sequences 4 haplotypes existed. amount 
of tajima's (0.3805) ratio non-synonymous synonymous mutation (1.82) 
showed c-terminal region pvsera5 positive natural selection;
also intragenic recombination could interfere.
conclusion: results could helpful research, regarding antigen as
vaccine candidate iran worldwide.
