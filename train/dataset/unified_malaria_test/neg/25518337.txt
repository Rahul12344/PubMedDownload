artemisnin novel sesquiterpene lactone internal peroxide bridge
structure, extracted traditional chinese herb artemisia annua l.
(qinghao). recommended world health organization, artemisinin the
first-line drug treatment encephalic chloroquine-resistant malaria.
in present study, transgenic a. annua plants developed overexpressing
the key enzymes involved biosynthetic pathway artemisinin. based on
agrobacterium-mediated transformation methods, transgenic plants a. annua with
overexpression hdr ads obtained hygromycin screening.
the genomic pcr analysis confirmed six transgenic lines hdr ads
were integrated genome. gene expression analysis given real-time
quantitative pcr showed transgenic lines higher expression
levels hdr ads non-transgenic control (except ah3 the
expression level ads showed significant difference compared control); 
and hplc analysis artemisinin demonstrated transgenic a. annua plants
produced artemisinin significantly higher level non-transgenic plants.
especially, highest content artemisinin found transgenic line ah70,
in artemisinin content 3.48 times compared in
non-transgenic lines. summary, overexpression hdr ads facilitated
artemisinin biosynthesis method could applied develop transgenic
plants a. annua higher yield artemisinin.
