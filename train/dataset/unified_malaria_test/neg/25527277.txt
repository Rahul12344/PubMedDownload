background: toxoplasmosis caused intracellular parasite toxoplasma gondii 
(t. gondii) global epidemic parasitic disease. dna vaccines play an
important role preventing spread toxoplasmosis. sag family genes
encoding particular surface proteins t. gondii best candidates dna 
vaccine. member sag family genes, sag5 gene proved have
better antigenic sag1. addition, alpha-galactosylceramide (α-galcer) 
used adjuvant malaria vaccine received positive results. 
study, effect dna vaccine enhanced α-galcer evaluated by
immunizing balb/c mice.
methods: present study, sag5d gene t. gondii cloned, sequenced, and
biologically characterized. balb/c mice randomly divided five groups,
including three experimental groups (pegfp-c1-sag5d, α-galcer and
α-galcer/pegfp-c1-sag5d) two control groups (pbs pegfp-c1), were
immunized intramuscularly three times. levels igg antibodies cytokine 
productions mouse sera determined enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(elisa). two weeks last immunization, mice challenged
intraperitoneally 1 × 10(4) tachyzoites t. gondii survival time
of mice recorded.
results: significant level increase igg response soluble
tachyzoite antigens (stag) detected elisa experimental group. it
revealed relatively high level ifn-γ production spleen cells. there
were higher productions interleukin-4 (il-4) α-galcer treated groups
compared control groups. challenge experiment showed longer survival period 
(11 days compared 5 days control) sag5d dna vaccinated mice found 
after lethal challenge t. gondii rh strain.
conclusions: present study suggested t. gondii sag5d novel and
positive dna vaccine candidate toxoplasmosis. addition, adjuvant
(α-galcer) enhanced body's cellular immune response prolonged the
survival time mice challenge.
