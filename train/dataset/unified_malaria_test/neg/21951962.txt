background: recently, plasmodium falciparum parasites bearing pfdhfr i164l single
mutation found madagascar. new mutants may challenge use of
antifolates intermittent preventive treatment malaria pregnancy
(iptp). assays transgenic bacteria suggested i164l parasites a
wild-type phenotype pyrimethamine confirmed testing the
parasites themselves.
methods: thirty plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates collected 2008 in
the south-east madagascar. part pfdhfr gene encompassing codons 6 206 
was amplified pcr determination presence single nucleotide
polymorphisms performed dna sequencing. multiplicity infection 
estimated using allelic family-specific nested pcr. isolates appeared 
monoclonal submitted culture adaptation. determination ic(50s) to
pyrimethamine performed adapted isolates.
results: four different pfdhfr alleles found: 164l single mutant-type (n
= 13), wild-type (n = 7), triple mutant-type 51i/59r/108n (n = 9) the
double mutant-type 108n/164l (n = 1). eleven 30 (36.7%) p. falciparum
isolates considered monoclonal infection. among them, five isolates 
successfully adapted culture tested pyrimethamine vitro
susceptibility. wild-type allele susceptible 50%
inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) < 10 nm. geometric mean ic(50) the
three i164l mutant isolates 6-fold higher wild-type 61.3 nm (sd
= 3.2 nm, ci95%: 53.9-69.7 nm). values remained largely ic(50) of
the triple mutant parasite (13,804 nm).
conclusion: ic(50)s i164l mutant isolates significantly higher
than wild-type (6-fold higher) close usually reported
for simple mutants s108n (roughly10-fold higher wild type). given the
observed values, determination ic(50)s directly parasites not
confirm found transgenic bacteria. prevalence increase of
the pfdhfr i164l single mutant parasite since 2006 could explained the
selective advantage allele sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine pressure. the
emergence highly resistant alleles considered future, in
particular unexpected double mutant-type allele s108n/i164l been
already detected.
