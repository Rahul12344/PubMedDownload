the increasing prevalence infections involving intracellular apicomplexan
parasites plasmodium, toxoplasma, cryptosporidium (the causative
agents malaria, toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidiosis, respectively) represent 
a significant global healthcare burden. despite significance, few
treatments available; situation likely deteriorate the
emergence new resistant strains parasites. lay foundation for
programs drug discovery vaccine development, genome sequences many 
these organisms generated, together large-scale expression and
proteomic datasets. comparative analyses datasets beginning to
identify molecular innovations supporting conserved processes mediating 
fundamental roles parasite survival persistence, well as
lineage-specific adaptations associated divergent life-cycle strategies. the
challenge best exploit data derive insights parasite
virulence identify genes representing amenable targets. in
this review, outline genomic datasets currently available apicomplexans
and discuss biological insights emerged consequence their
analysis. particular interest systems-based resources, focusing areas
of metabolism host invasion opening opportunities discovering
new therapeutic targets.
