hemoparasites apicomplexan family plasmodiidae include etiological
agents malaria, well suite non-human primate parasites which
the human malaria agents evolved. despite significance parasites for
global health, little information available ecology multi-host 
communities. primates investigated kibale national park, uganda, where
ecological relationships among host species well characterized. blood samples
were examined parasites genera plasmodium hepatocystis using
microscopy pcr targeting parasite mitochondrial cytochrome b gene,
followed sanger sequencing. assess co-infection, "deep sequencing" a
variable region within cytochrome b performed. nine black-and-white
colobus (colobus guereza), one blue guenon (cercopithecus mitis), five
grey-cheeked mangabeys (lophocebus albigena), 23 olive baboons (papio anubis), 52
red colobus (procolobus rufomitratus) 12 red-tailed guenons (cercopithecus
ascanius), 79 infections (77.5%) found, hepatocystis spp. 
sanger sequencing revealed 25 different parasite haplotypes sorted
phylogenetically six species-specific morphologically similar lineages. 
"deep sequencing" revealed mixed-lineage co-infections baboons red colobus
(41.7% 64.7% individuals, respectively) host species. one
lineage infecting red colobus also infected baboons, always minor
variant, suggesting directional cross-species transmission. hepatocystis
parasites primate community diverse assemblage cryptic lineages,
some co-infect hosts least one cross primate species
barriers.
