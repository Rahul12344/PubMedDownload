although spleen broadly accepted major lymphoid organ involved in
generating immune responses erythrocytic stages malaria parasite,
plasmodium, human splenic tissue readily available cases. a
result, studies malaria humans rely peripheral blood assess
cellular immune responses malaria. suitability peripheral blood a
proxy splenic immune responses however unknown. here, have
simultaneously analysed transcriptomes whole blood spleen 12 days
of erythrocytic stage plasmodium chabaudi infection c57bl/6 mice. using both
unsupervised directed approaches, compared gene expression blood
and spleen course infection. taking advantage publicly available
datasets, used machine learning approaches infer cell proportions and
cell-specific gene expression signatures whole tissue transcriptome
data. findings demonstrate spleen blood quite dissimilar,
sharing small amount transcriptional information them, with
transcriptional differences cellular composition transcriptional
activity. results suggest blood transcriptome data may useful
in defining surrogate markers protection pathology, be
used predict specific immune responses occurring lymphoid organs.
