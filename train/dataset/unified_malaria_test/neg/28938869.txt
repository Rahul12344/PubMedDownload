background: anopheles (an.) coluzzii, one africa's primary malaria vectors, is
highly anthropophilic. human host preference contributes greatly its
ability transmit malaria. contrast, closely related an. quadriannulatus
prefers feed bovids thought contribute malaria
transmission. diverged preference host odor profiles these
sibling species likely reflected chemosensory gene expression levels the
olfactory organs. therefore, compared transcriptomes antennae and
maxillary palps an. coluzzii an. quadriannulatus, focusing the
major chemosensory gene families.
results: chemosensory gene expression strongly correlated the
two species, various chemosensory genes show significantly enhanced expression in
one species. antennae an. coluzzii expression six
olfactory receptors (ors) seven ionotropic receptors (irs) considerably
enhanced, whereas 11 ors 3 irs upregulated an. quadriannulatus. the
maxillary palps, leaving aside irs low level expression, one ir is
strongly enhanced species. addition, find divergence odorant
binding protein (obp) gene expression, several highly expressed obps being
enhanced antennae palps an. coluzzii. finally, expression of
several gustatory receptors (grs) palps appears species-specific,
including homolog sugar-sensing drosophila gr.
conclusions: considerable number ors irs differentially expressed
between two closely related species diverging host preference. these
chemosensory genes could play role human host preference malaria 
vector an. coluzzii. additionally, divergence obp expression two
species suggests possible role odor carrier proteins determining
host preference. finally, divergence chemosensory expression palps may 
point towards possible role maxillary palps host differentiation.
