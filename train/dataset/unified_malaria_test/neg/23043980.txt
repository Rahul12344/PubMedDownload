plasmodium vivax predominant species human malaria parasite present
in indian subcontinent. recent reports chloroquine (cq)
resistance severe manifestations shown p. vivax different regions 
the world including india. study focuses bikaner, india 
last years continuous reports severe manifestations by
both plasmodium falciparum p. vivax. region widespread use of
chloroquine sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment malaria, the
resistance profiles drugs available. report profile 
of mutations marker genes associated chloroquine antifolate drug
resistance among p. vivax parasites obtained patients severe (n=30)
and non-severe (n=48) manifestations region. isolates showed the
wild type alleles chloroquine antifolate resistance markers
(p<0.0005). except one isolate showing y976f mutation pvmdr-1 gene, no
reported mutation observed pvmdr-1 pvcrt gene. in
accordance fact till date chloroquine resistance been
reported region. however, single isolate mutation pvmdr-1
may suggest beginning trend towards decreased susceptibility to
chloroquine. frequency pvdhfr-pvdhps two locus mutations higher among 
the patients showing severe manifestations patient group non-severe
(uncomplicated) malaria (p<0.003). none parasites patients with
uncomplicated p. vivax malaria showed mutant pvdhps genotype. novel mutations
in pvdhfr (s117h) pvdhps (f365l, d459a m601i) observed the
parasite population obtained patients exhibiting severe complications.
preliminary homology modeling molecular docking studies predicted 
mutations apparently effect binding drug molecule
to enzyme. however, presence novel mutations pvdhps gene
indicate degree polymorphism molecule contrast to
available published information.
