background: current world health organization guidelines conducting
anti-malarial drug efficacy clinical trials recommend genotyping plasmodium
falciparum genes msp1 msp2 distinguish recrudescence reinfection. a
more recently developed potential alternative method molecular
genotyping assay based panel 24 single nucleotide polymorphism (snp)
markers.
methods: performance parameters two genotyping methods compared
using data two recently completed drug efficacy trials. blood samples from
two anti-malarial therapeutic trials analysed msp genotyping the
24 snp assay. additionally, conserve time resources, statistical
program r used select informative snps set unrelated
malawian samples develop truncated snp-based assay region
surrounding blantyre, malawi. ability truncated assay distinguish 
reinfection recrudescence compared full 24 snp assay then
analysed using data therapeutic trials.
results: total 360 samples analysed; 66 concordance msp snp 
barcoding methodologies, 294 assessing informative 24 snp
markers. snp genotyping performed comparably msp genotyping, one
case disagreement among 50 interpretable results, snp assay
identified sample reinfection msp typing recrudescence.
furthermore, snp typing robust; 6% samples uninterpretable 
by snp typing, compared 19.7% msp genotyping used. discriminating
reinfection recrudescence, truncated 6 snp assay found perform at
95.1% accuracy full 24 snp bar code.
conclusions: use snp analysis similar sensitivity standard msp 
genotyping determining recrudescence reinfection. although more
expensive, snp typing faster less work intensive. limiting assay to
those snps informative geographical region interest may further
decrease workload cost, making technique feasible and
affordable alternative drug efficacy trials.
