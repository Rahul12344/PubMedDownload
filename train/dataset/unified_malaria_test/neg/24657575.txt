mechanisms regulating gene expression malaria parasites well
understood. little known parasite regulates gene expression 
during transition one developmental stage another response to
various environmental conditions. parasites diseased host face environments 
which differ static, well adapted vitro conditions. parasites thus
need adapt quickly effectively conditions establishing
transcriptional states best suited better survival. the
discovery natural antisense transcripts (nats) parasite and
considering various proposed mechanisms nats might regulate gene
expression, speculated might playing critical role in
gene regulation. report diversity nats parasite, using
isolates taken directly patients differing clinical symptoms caused 
malaria infection. using custom designed strand specific whole genome
microarray, total 797 nats targeted annotated loci been
detected. these, 545 nats unique study. majority nats
were positively correlated expression pattern sense transcript.
however, 96 genes showed change sense/antisense ratio comparison 
uncomplicated complicated disease conditions. antisense transcripts map
to broad range biochemical/metabolic pathways, especially pathways
pertaining central carbon metabolism stress related pathways. data
strongly suggests large group nats detected unannotated
transcription units antisense annotated gene models. results reveal a
previously unknown set nats prevails parasite, differential
regulation disease conditions mapping functionally well annotated
genes. results detailed call studies deduce possible
mechanism action nats, would help understanding in
vivo pathological adaptations parasites.
