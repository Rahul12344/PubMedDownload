malaria major cause morbidity mortality humans. artemisinins
remain first-line treatment plasmodium falciparum (p. falciparum)
malaria although drug resistance already emerged spread southeast
asia. thus, fight disease, urgent need develop new
antimalarial drugs malaria chemotherapy. unlike human host cells,
p. falciparum cannot salvage preformed pyrimidine bases nucleosides the
extracellular environment relies solely nucleotides synthesized through
the de novo biosynthetic pathway. review presents significant progress on
understanding de novo pyrimidine pathway functional enzymes the
human parasite p. falciparum. current knowledge genomics metabolomics 
described, particularly focusing parasite purine pyrimidine nucleotide
metabolism. include gene annotation, characterization molecular
mechanism enzymes different human host pathway. recent
elucidation three-dimensional crystal structures catalytic
reactions three enzymes: dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, orotate
phosphoribosyltransferase, orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase, well 
as inhibitors reviewed context therapeutic potential
against malaria.
