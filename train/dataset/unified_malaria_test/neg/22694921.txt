background: result widespread resistance chloroquine and
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, artemisinin-based combination therapy (act)
(including artemether-lumefantrine artesunate-amodiaquine) been
recommended first-line anti-malarial regimen senegal since 2006.
intermittent preventive treatments anti-malarial drugs based on
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine also given children pregnant women per 
month transmission season. since 2006, few
reports susceptibility plasmodium falciparum anti-malarial drugs. to
estimate prevalence resistance several anti-malarial drugs since the
introduction widespread use act, presence molecular markers
associated resistance chloroquine sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine was
assessed local isolates military hospital dakar.
methods: prevalence genetic polymorphisms genes associated with
anti-malarial drug resistance, i.e., pfcrt, pfdhfr, pfdhps pfmdr1, the
copy number pfmdr1 evaluated panel 174 isolates collected from
patients recruited military hospital dakar 14 october 2009 19
january 2010.
results: pfcrt 76t mutation identified 37.2% samples. the
pfmdr1 86y 184f mutations found 16.6% 67.6% tested
samples, respectively. twenty-eight 29 isolates 86y mutation were
also mutated codon 184. one isolate (0.6%) two copies pfmdr1. 
pfdhfr 108n/t, 51i 59r mutations identified 82.4%, 83.5% 74.1% of
the samples, respectively. double mutant (108n 51i) detected 83.5%
of isolates, triple mutant (108n, 51i 59r) detected 75.3%.
the pfdhps 437g, 436f/a 613s mutations found 40.2%, 35.1% 1.8% of
the samples, respectively. double mutant (437g 540e) no
quintuple mutant (pfdhfr 108n, 51i 59r pfdhps 437g 540e). the
prevalence quadruple mutant (pfdhfr 108n, 51i 59r pfdhps 437g) was
36.5%.
conclusions: since 2004, prevalence chloroquine resistance decreased. 
the prevalence isolates high-level pyrimethamine resistance 83.5%. the
prevalence isolates resistant sulphadoxine 40.2%. however, quintuple 
mutant (pfdhfr 108n, 51i 59r pfdhps 437g 540e), associated
with high level sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance, identified
to date. resistance amodiaquine remains moderate.
