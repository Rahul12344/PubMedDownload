co-chaperones well-known regulators heat shock protein 90 (hsp90). hsp90
is molecular chaperone essential eukaryotes folding 
activation numerous proteins involved important cellular processes 
signal transduction, growth developmental regulation. co-chaperones assist
hsp90 protein folding process modulating conformational changes to
promote client protein interaction functional maturation. the
recognition plasmodium falciparum hsp90 (pfhsp90) potential antimalarial 
drug target, obvious interest study co-chaperones their
partnership regulating cellular processes malaria parasite. previous
studies pfhsp90 identified 10 co-chaperones p. falciparum
genome. however, many remained annotated putative proteins their
functionality validated experimentally. far, five
co-chaperones, pfhop, pfp23, pfaha1, pfpp5 pffkbp35 characterized
and shown interact pfhsp90. review summarize current knowledge 
on co-chaperones p. falciparum discuss regulatory roles on
pfhsp90. certain eukaryotic co-chaperones also implicated in
altering affinity hsp90 inhibitor, review also examine
plasmodial co-chaperones' potential influence approaches towards designing
antimalarials targeting pfhsp90.
