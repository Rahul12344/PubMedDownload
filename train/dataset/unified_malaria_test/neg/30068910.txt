the plasmodium life cycle within mosquito involves gamete, zygote, motile
ookinete, oocyst stage supports sporogony sporozoite formation. 
we mapped p. falciparum transcriptome parasite progresses 
oocyst stage development days 2, 4, 6, 8 post-p. falciparum infectious 
blood meal. genomic studies, identified 212 novel transmission
stage biomarkers including genes developmentally expressed single
time point genes pan-developmentally expressed four time
points p. falciparum oocysts. validation small subset genes the
transcriptional translational level resulted identification signature
of genes/proteins detect parasites within mosquito early day 2
post-infectious blood meal used distinguish early versus late stage
p. falciparum oocyst development mosquito. currently, circumsporozoite
protein (csp), detectable day 7 post-infection, only
marker used detection p. falciparum infection mosquitoes. results
open prospect develop non-csp based detection assay assessment p.
falciparum infection mosquitoes evaluate effect intervention
measures malaria transmission endemic setting.
