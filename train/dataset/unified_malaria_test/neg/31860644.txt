plasmodium vivax leading cause malaria outside africa represents 
significant health economic burden affected countries. major obstacle
for p. vivax eradication dormant hypnozoite liver stage causes
relapse infections limited antimalarial drugs clear stage.
advances studying hypnozoite unique biological aspects this
parasite hampered lack continuous vitro laboratory culture
system poor availability molecular tools genetic manipulation. this
study, aim develop molecular tools used genetic
manipulation p. vivax. putative p. vivax centromere sequence (pvcen) was
cloned episomal centromere based plasmids expressing gfp marker were
constructed. centromere activity evaluated using rodent malaria parasite
plasmodium yoelii. plasmid carrying pvcen stably maintained in
asexual-stage parasites absence drug pressure, approximately 45% of
the parasites retained plasmid four weeks later. retention rate 
observed parasites possessing native p. yoelii centromere (pycen)-based
control plasmid. segregation efficiency plasmid per nuclear division
was > 99% pvcen parasites, compared ~90% control parasite harboring 
plasmid without centromere. addition, observed clear gfp signal both
oocysts salivary gland sporozoites isolated mosquitoes. blood-stage
parasites liver stage development, gfp positivity pvcen parasites was
comparable control pycen parasites. thus, pvcen plasmids maintained
throughout parasite life cycle. also validated several p. vivax promoter
activities showed hsp70 promoter (~1 kb) active throughout the
parasite life cycle. first data functional characterization
of p. vivax centromere used future p. vivax biological research.
