background: 175-kda erythrocyte binding antigen (eba-175) plasmodium
falciparum plays crucial role merozoite invasion human erythrocytes.
eba-175 believed diversifying selection; however, there
have studies investigating effect dispersal humans of
africa genetic variation eba-175 p. falciparum.
methods: pcr-direct sequencing performed part eba-175 gene
(regions ii iii) using dna samples obtained thai patients infected 
p. falciparum. divergence times p. falciparum eba-175 alleles were
estimated assuming p. falciparum/plasmodium reichenowi divergence occurred 6
million years ago (mya). examine possibility diversifying selection,
nonsynonymous synonymous substitution rates plasmodium species also 
estimated.
results: total 32 eba-175 alleles identified 131 thai p.
falciparum isolates. estimated divergence time 0.13-0.14 mya, before
the exodus humans africa. phylogenetic tree large sequence
dataset p. falciparum eba-175 alleles across world showed the
presence basal asian-specific cluster p. falciparum sequences. a
markedly nonsynonymous substitutions synonymous substitutions region
ii p. falciparum also detected, within plasmodium species
parasitizing african apes, suggesting diversifying selection acted
specifically p. falciparum eba-175.
conclusions: plasmodium falciparum eba-175 genetic diversity appeared increase
following exodus asian ancestors africa. diversifying selection may
have played important role diversification eba-175 allelic lineages.
the present results suggest dispersals humans africa
influenced significantly molecular evolution p. falciparum eba-175.
