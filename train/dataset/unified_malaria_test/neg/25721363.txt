in sudan, plasmodium vivax accounts approximately 5-10% malaria cases.
this study carried determine genetic diversity p. vivax
population sudan analyzing polymorphism p. vivax csp (pvcsp) and
pvmsp-3α genes. blood samples (n=76) taken suspected malaria cases from
2012-2013 three health centers eastern central sudan. parasite
detection performed microscopy molecular techniques, genotyping of
both genes performed pcr-rflp followed dna sequence pvcsp gene
(n=30). based microscopy analysis, 76 (%100) patients infected p.
vivax, whereas nested-pcr results showed 86.8% (n=66), 3.9% (n=3), 3.9% 
(n=3) tested samples p. vivax well plasmodium falciparum mono- and
mixed infections, respectively. four 76 samples results in
molecular diagnosis. sequenced samples found vk210 (100%)
genotype six distinct amino acid haplotypes, 210a (66.7%) most
prevalent haplotype. sudanese isolates displayed variations peptide
repeat motifs (prms) ranging 17 19 gdradgqpa (prm1), gdraagqpa
(prm2) ddraagqpa (prm3). also, 54 polymorphic sites 56 mutations were
found repeat post-repeat regions pvcsp overall nucleotide
diversity (π) 0.02149±0.00539. negative value dn-ds (-0.0344) found 
that suggested significant purifying selection sudanese pvcsp, (z test,
p<0.05). regarding pvmsp-3α, three types detected: types (94.6%, 52/55),
type c (3.6%, 2/55), type b (1.8%, 1/55). multiclonal infections were
detected, rflp analysis identified 13 (hha i, a1-a11, b1, c1) 16 (alu
i, a1-a14, b1, c1) distinct allelic forms. conclusion, genetic
investigation among sudanese p. vivax isolates indicated antigen showed
limited antigenic diversity.
