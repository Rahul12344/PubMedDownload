among various innovative products obtainable hemp (cannabis sativa l.)
waste biomass originating different industrial processes, essential oil 
(eo) deserves special attention order understand possible application
in different fields, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, botanical
insecticides. purpose, present work, studied chemical
composition eos obtained different hemp varieties, namely felina 32 and
carmagnola selezionata (cs) using monoecious, male, female inflorescences,
and evaluated mosquitocidal activities larvae pupae two main

the safe use hemp eos operators, potential pro- anti-inflammatory

insecticidal anti-inflammatory studies, preliminary evaluation eos
encapsulation nanoemulsions (nes) performed aim develop
a formulation able improve poor physicochemical stability. felina 32 and
cs inflorescences provided eos interesting chemical profile, with
monoterpene sesquiterpene hydrocarbons major components. study
