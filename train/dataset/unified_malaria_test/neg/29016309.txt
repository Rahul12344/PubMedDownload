controlling malaria high transmission areas, much sub-saharan
africa, require concerted efforts slow spread drug resistance 
to impede malaria transmission. understanding fitness costs associated with
the development drug resistance, particularly within context of
transmission, help guide policy decisions accomplish goals, as
fitness constraints might lead decreased transmission drug-resistant
strains. determine plasmodium falciparum resistance-mediating polymorphisms
impact development different parasite stages, compared genotypes 
parasites infecting humans mosquitoes households uganda. genotypes at
14 polymorphic loci genes encoding putative transporters (pfcrt pfmdr1)
and folate pathway enzymes (pfdhfr pfdhps) characterized using ligase
detection reaction-fluorescent microsphere assays. paired analysis using the
wilcoxon signed-rank test, prevalences mutations 12 loci differ

76t (p = 0.0412) mutant alleles. results suggest modest directional selection
