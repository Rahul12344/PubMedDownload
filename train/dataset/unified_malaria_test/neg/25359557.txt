background: rodent malaria parasites (rmp) used extensively models of
human malaria. draft rmp genomes published plasmodium yoelii, p.
berghei anka (pba) p. chabaudi (pcas). although availability these
genomes made significant impact recent malaria research, genomes 
highly fragmented annotated little manual curation. fragmented 
nature genomes hampered genome wide analysis plasmodium gene
regulation function.
results: greatly improved genome assemblies pba pcas, newly
sequenced virulent parasite p. yoelii ym genome, sequenced additional rmp
isolates/lines characterized genotypic diversity within rmp species. 
have produced rna-seq data utilised improve gene-model prediction and
to provide quantitative, genome-wide, data gene expression. comparison 
rmp genomes genome human malaria parasite p. falciparum and
rna-seq mapping permitted gene annotation base-pair resolution. full-length
chromosomal annotation permitted comprehensive classification all
subtelomeric multigene families including 'plasmodium interspersed repeat
genes' (pir). phylogenetic classification pir family, combined pir
expression patterns, indicates functional diversification within family.
conclusions: complete rmp genomes, rna-seq genotypic diversity data are
excellent important resources gene-function post-genomic analyses and
to better interrogate plasmodium biology. genotypic diversity p. chabaudi
isolates makes species excellent parasite study genotype-phenotype
relationships. improved classification multigene families enhance
studies role (variant) exported proteins virulence immune
evasion/modulation.
