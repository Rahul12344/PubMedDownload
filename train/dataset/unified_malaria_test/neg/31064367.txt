background: anopheles sinensis one major malaria vectors china and
other southeast asian countries, including vietnam, cambodia, thailand. vector
control considered critical measure malaria control, the
increasing prevalence insecticide resistance caused long-term use of
insecticides, especially pyrethroids, threatening successful control of
an. sinensis. order understand underlying resistance mechanisms
involved molecular basis, principal malaria vector, an. sinensis from
jiangsu anhui provinces, southeast china, investigated.
methods: adult anopheles mosquitoes sampled multiple sites across
jiangsu anhui provinces, sufficient mosquitoes collected eleven
sites insecticide susceptibility bioassays. diis4-diis6 region the
para-type sodium channel gene amplified sequenced, multiple pcr 
taqman assays used assess frequencies kdr mutations target 
gene.
results: present study, adult an. sinensis populations were
pyrethroids resistant, indicated presence kdr resistance mutations
in para-type sodium channel gene. sequence analyses demonstrated kdr
mutation existed codon 1014 jiangsu anhui provinces. adult an.
sinensis, three mutant types (ttt l1014f, ttc l1014f, tgt l1014c) kdr
alleles detected, wild type (ttg l1014) observed. ttc
l1014f mutation first reported anhui province.
conclusions: highly polymorphic kdr alleles observed adult
an. sinensis populations, suggested in-depth studies required 
carrying insecticide resistance monitoring specific resistance mechanisms 
studying establish effective long-term malaria vector control program in
eastern china.
