plasmodium falciparum sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2+ atpase (pfserca) is
sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane bound transporter regulate cytosol ca2+ ions. 
ca2+ act secondary messenger play important role differentiation of
parasite life cycle. present study epidemiological surveillance 
pfserca (pf3d7_0106300) gene fragment harboring 263, 402, 431 codon look for
its single nucleotide polymorphism well documented associated with
artemisinin tolerance. filter paper finger pricked blood samples for
plasmodium falciparum infected uncomplicated malaria patients obtained for
region diverse longitude east west india i.e. mizoram, 
tripura, meghalaya, jharkhand, odhisa. observed mutation codon 263
at study sites. mizoram showed highest pfserca diversity well known snps
of l402 v, e431 k, a438 v novel mutations well i.e. a338 v, s357y, s379y. 
tripura reported highest proportion plasmodium isolates (18.5%) e431 k
single nucleotide polymorphism. moving towards west i.e. meghalaya,
jharkhand, odhisa showed occurrence prevalent pfserca 431, 402
polymorphism worldwide novel mutations haplotypes. present
study, significantly increased proportion novel pfserca polymorphism among
children suggests susceptibility plasmodium falciparum strains to
acquired immunity. mizoram, sharing open international border south east
asia, demonstrated highest pfserca diversity. spatial pfserca diversity far 
north east india moving towards west implies association antimalarial
susceptibility.
