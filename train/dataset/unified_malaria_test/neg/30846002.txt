background: efficacy artemisinin (art) agents, critical element current
malaria control efforts threatened emergence spread resistance.
mutations pfkelch13 gene associated art-resistance evolved southeast
asia (sea). k13 mutations whose role art-resistance remains unknown, have
subsequently emerged independently across malaria-affected regions. aim
of systematic review determine prevalence identify risk
factors plasmodium falciparum k13 mutations malaria-endemic countries.
methods: electronic search studies 2014 date done medline
via pubmed, scopus, embase lilacs/vhl databases. mesh terms boolean
operators (and, or) used. two librarians independently conducted search
(rs ak). articles screened inclusion using priori criteria set
following prisma-p strega guidelines. three independent reviewers (nl, bb,
and om) extracted data. data analysis performed open meta analyst
software. random effects analysis (dl) used heterogeneity established
using i2-statistic.
results: total 482 articles retrieved pubmed = 302,
lilacs/vhl = 50, embase = 80, scopus = 37; bibliography/other searches = 13, 
of 374 meet inclusion criteria. aggregate prevalence of
single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) pfkelch13 gene 27.6% (3694/14,827) 
(95% ci 22.9%, 32.3%). sub-group analysis showed aggregate prevalence of
non-synonymous snps pfkelch13 gene higher, 45.4% (95% ci 35.4%, 55.3%) 
southeast asia opposed 7.6% (95% ci 5.6%, 9.5%) african region. a
total 165 independent k13 mutations identified across malaria-affected
regions globally. total 16 non-validated k13 mutations associated 
increased art parasite clearance half-life (t1/2 > 5 h). majority, 45.5%
(75/165), mutations reported single p. falciparum parasite
infections. 165 k13-mutations, half reported new alleles.
twenty (20) non-propeller mutations pfkelch13 gene identified.
conclusion: review identified emergence potential art-resistance
mediating k13 mutations african region. diversity mutations in
pfkelch13 gene highest african region compared sea. mutations outside
the pfkelch13 propeller region associated increased art parasite clearance
half-life occur malaria-affected regions.
