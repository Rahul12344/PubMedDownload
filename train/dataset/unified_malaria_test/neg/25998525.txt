main conclusion: uv-b-caused dna hypomethylation uv-b-mediated epigenetic
activation additional wrky-binding site(s) dbr2 promoter may contribute
to overexpression dbr2 gene artemisia annua. dna methylation one
of key mechanisms behind stress-induced transcriptional switch off/on. here, 
we evaluate dna methylation level response uv-b radiation artemisia 
annua produces artemisinin, sesquiterpene recommended by
who frontline treatment malaria. however, drug facing serious
shortage due low concentration plants. uv-b treatment (3 h) enhanced
artemisinin concentration 1.91-fold compared control. key
regulatory gene artemisinin biosynthesis, dbr2 upregulated uv-b.
this study presents observations regarding contributions dna methylation to
the gene regulation using dbr2 example. restriction digestion genomic
dna isoschizomers (mspi hpaii) suggested uv-b involvement dna
hypomethylation a. annua. global level dna methylation (r) 3.4 
5.9% uv-b treated control plants, respectively, attesting hypomethylation
of dna response uv-b. bisulfite sequencing pcr showed demethylation
at two chg sites 18s rrna gene. similarly, bisulfite sequencing promoter
region dbr2 demonstrated demethylation 4 cg-, 4 chh- 2 chg-sites.
in silico analysis revealed uv-b-mediated demethylation seven putative
transcription factor binding sites including wrky, positive regulators 
of artemisinin biosynthesis. uv-b treatment resulted activation of
additional wrky-binding site uv-b-treated plants compared single active
wrky-binding site control could probable reason for
overexpression dbr2. suggested dna demethylation important
epigenetic response uv-b radiation a. annua surely provide new
horizons elucidate mechanistic evidence plant's responses to
uv-b radiation.
