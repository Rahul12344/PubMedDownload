introduction: africa harbors disproportionate burden disease taking
into account triple challenge caused hiv/aids, tuberculosis (tb) and
malaria, backdrop increasing burden noncommunicable diseases. 
more 80% therapeutic drugs used management these
diseases/conditions metabolized cyp enzymes exhibit genetic
polymorphisms.
areas covered: variability expression activities cyps
resulting interindividual differences response standard doses of
therapeutic drugs, due genetic polymorphisms, exhibit quantitative 
and qualitative differences racial ethnic groups. review 
aims evaluate implications genetic variation cyps public 
health africans. cyps reviewed metabolize commonly used
therapeutic drugs include cyp1a2, 2a6, 2b6, 2c8, 2c9, 2c19, 2d6, 3a4 3a5.
allele frequencies compared african ethnic groups among
populations african, asian european origin. data obtained own
studies literature.
expert opinion: variability pattern genetic variation between
populations translates differences drug response. understanding cyp
variability improves rational drug use public health significance.
