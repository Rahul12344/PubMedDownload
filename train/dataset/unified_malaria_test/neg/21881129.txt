background: binding chondroitin sulfate var2csa, parasite protein
expressed infected erythrocytes, allows placental sequestration plasmodium 
falciparum-infected erythrocytes. leads severe consequences as
maternal anemia, stillbirths, intrauterine growth retardation. latter has
been clearly associated increased morbidity mortality infants.
acquired anti-var2csa antibodies associated improved pregnancy
outcomes, suggesting vaccine could prevent syndrome. however, identifying
functionally important regions large var2csa protein difficult.
methods: using genetic immunization, raised polyclonal antisera against
overlapping segments var2csa mice rabbits. adhesion-inhibition
capacities induced antisera specific antibodies purified plasma of
malaria-exposed pregnant women assessed laboratory-adapted parasite lines
and field isolates expressing var2csa. competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (elisa) employed analyze functional resemblance antibodies
induced animals naturally acquired immune multigravidae.
results: antibodies targeting n-terminal sequence (nts) dbl2x
(nts-dbl2x) efficiently blocked parasite adhesion chondroitin sulfate a
manner similar antibodies raised entire var2csa
extracellular domain. interestingly, naturally acquired antibodies those
induced vaccination nts-dbl2x target overlapping strain-transcendent
anti-adhesion epitopes.
conclusions: study highlights important step achieved toward development 
of protective vaccine placental malaria.
