perkinsus olseni, causative agent perkinsosis, drastically affect 
survival target marine mollusks, dramatic economic consequences for
aquaculture. p. olseni member alveolata group, also comprises
parasites highly relevant medical veterinary sciences as
plasmodium falciparum toxoplasma. p. olseni shares several unique metabolic
pathways pathological parasites toxic humans. this
work, six antimalarially active peroxides, derived natural product
artemisinin synthetic trioxolanes, synthesized tested p. olseni
proliferation survival. peroxides tested revealed inhibitory effect on
p. olseni proliferation micromolar concentrations. relevance the
peroxide functionality toxicity effect fe(ii)-intracellular
concentration activity also evaluated. results demonstrated the
peroxide functionality toxofore intracellular iron concentration also 
proved crucial co-factor activation peroxides p. olseni.
these data points mechanism bioactivation p. olseni sharing
similarities one proposed p. falciparum parasites. preliminary
studies bioaccumulation conducted using fluorescent-labeled peroxides.
results show synthetic trioxolanes tend accumulate vacuole the
labeled artemisinin accumulates cytoplasm. preliminary experiments on
differential genes expression associated fe(ii) transport protein (nramp) 
calcium transport protein (atp6/serca) also conducted qpcr. results point
to fourfold increase expression genes upon exposure trioxolanes
and approximately twofold upon exposure artemisinin derivatives. data obtained
in investigation relevant better understanding biology of
perkinsus may also important development new strategies for
perkinsosis prevention control.
