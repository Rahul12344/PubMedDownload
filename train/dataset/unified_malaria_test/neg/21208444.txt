background: phosphoinositide lipid kinases (piks) generate specific
phosphorylated variants phosatidylinositols (ptdins) critical for
second messenger signaling cellular membrane remodeling. mammals 19 pik 
isoforms spread across three major families: ptins 3-kinases (pi3ks), ptdins 
4-kinases (pi4ks), ptdins-p (pip) kinases (pipks). eukaryotes have
fewer yet varying pik complements. piks also important, emerging class 
drug targets many therapeutic areas including cancer, inflammatory and
metabolic diseases host-pathogen interactions. here, report genomic
occurrences evolutionary relationships phylogenomics three pik
families across major eukaryotic groups suggest potential ramifications for
drug discovery.
results: analyses reveal four core eukaryotic piks type iii pik4a
and pik4b, least one homolog pi3k (possibly pik3c3 the
ancestor) pip5k families. also applied evolutionary analyses pik
disease ontology drug discovery. mutated pik3ca known oncogenic and
several inhibitors anti-cancer clinical trials. found conservation of
activating mutations pik3ca paralogous isoforms suggesting specific
functional constraints residues. mapping published compound
inhibition data (ic50s) onto phylogeny pi3ks, type ii pi4ks distantly
related, mtor, atm, atr prkdc kinases, also show compound
polypharmacology corresponds kinase evolutionary relationships. finally, we
extended rationale drugs targeting piks malarial plasmodium
falciparum, parasites, leishmania sp. trypanosoma sp. identifying 
those piks highly divergent human homologs.
conclusion: phylogenomic analysis piks provides new insights the
evolution second messenger signaling. postulate two waves pik
diversification, first metazoans subsequent expansion in
cold-blooded vertebrates post-emergence deutrostomia\chordata but
prior appearance mammals. reconstruction evolutionary
relationships among lipid kinases also adds understanding their
roles various diseases assists development potential drug
targets.
