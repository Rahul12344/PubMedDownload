monitoring genetic structure pathogen populations may economical and
sensitive approach quantify impact control transmission dynamics,
highlighting need better understanding changes population genetic
parameters transmission declines. describe first population
genetic analysis two major human malaria parasites, plasmodium falciparum (pf)
and plasmodium vivax (pv), following nationwide distribution long-lasting
insecticide-treated nets (llins) papua new guinea (png). parasite isolates
from pre- (2005-2006) post-llin (2010-2014) genotyped using
microsatellite markers. despite parasite prevalence declining substantially (east
sepik province: pf = 54.9%-8.5%, pv = 35.7%-5.6%, madang province:
pf = 38.0%-9.0%, pv: 31.8%-19.7%), genetically diverse intermixing parasite
populations remained. pf diversity declined modestly post-llin relative to
pre-llin (east sepik: rs  = 7.1-6.4,  = 0.77-0.71; madang: rs  = 8.2-6.1, he
 = 0.79-0.71). unexpectedly, population structure present pre-llin populations
was lost post-llin, suggesting frequent human movement between
provinces may contributed higher gene flow. pv prevalence initially
declined increased one province, yet diversity remained high
throughout study period (east sepik: rs  = 11.4-9.3,  = 0.83-0.80; madang:
rs  = 12.2-14.5,  = 0.85-0.88). although genetic differentiation values
increased provinces time, significant population structure was
observed time point. species, decline multiple infections
and increasing clonal transmission significant multilocus linkage
disequilibrium post-llin positive indicators impact parasite
population using microsatellite markers. parameters may useful adjuncts 
to traditional epidemiological tools early stages transmission
