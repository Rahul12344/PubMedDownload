background: anopheles anthropophagus one major vectors malaria in
asia. micrornas (mirnas) play important roles cell development and
differentiation well cellular response stress infection. a
former study, investigated global mirna profiles relation sex
in an. anthropophagus. however, mirnas contributing blood-feeding 
infection plasmodium still unknown.
methods: high-throughput sequencing performed identify mirna profiles of
an. anthropophagus midguts blood-feeding plasmodium infection. the
expression patterns mirna different midgut libraries compared based on
transcripts per million reads (tpm), confirmed northern blots.
target prediction pathway analysis carried investigate role
of regulated mirnas blood-feeding plasmodium infection.
results: identified 67 known 21 novel mirnas three libraries
(sugar-feeding, blood-feeding plasmodium infection) an. anthropophagus
midguts. comparing sugar-feeding, experssion nine (6 known 3 
novel) ten (9 known 1 novel) mirnas significantly upregulated and
downregulated respectively blood-feeding (p < 0.05, fold change ≥ 2 and
tpm ≥ 10). plasmodium infection induced expression thirteen (9 known 4
novel) eleven (9 known 2 novel) mirnas significantly upregulated and
downregulated, respectively, compared blood-feeding. representative
upregulated mir-92a blood-feeding downregulated mir-275 plasmodium
infection confirmed northern blot. putative targets these
regulated mirnas investigated classified pathways.
conclusions: study suggests mirnas involved blood-feeding
and plasmodium infection an. anthropophagus midgut. studies the
function differential expressed mirnas facilitate better
understanding mosquito biology anti-parasite immunity.
