the purpose review provide up-to-date information the
resistance plasmodium falciparum main antimalarials used madagascar 
and assist implementation malaria control elimination program. in
2006, failure rate chloroquine treatment 44% (n = 300) was
comparable rate observed continental africa. treatment failures
occurred first week follow-up. p. falciparum resistance to
chloroquine appeared special madagascar 3.2% isolates
showing vitro resistance (n = 372, 7 sentinel sites) less 1%
harbouring mutant parasites within pfcrt gene. conversely, pfmdr1 n86y
point mutation found 64.3% (n = 174) isolates 2006 51.7% (n =
343) 2007. failure combined sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine therapy, i.e., the
recommended intermittent preventive treatment malaria pregnancy, and
in vitro resistance pyrimethamine rare. however, pfdhfr 51i/59r/108n 
allele showed consistently high prevalence levels reaching 33.3% 2008.
moreover, single pfdhfr 164l mutant allele, haplotype unique madagascar,
was discovered 2006 showed prevalence rates 30% locations
(southeast) 2008. now, quadruple mutant allele pfdhfr
51i/59r/108n/164l observed. susceptibility other
antimalarials tested appeared excellent number isolates showing in
vitro susceptibility artemisinin derivatives fallen recent years
and decline may herald decrease efficacy drugs.
