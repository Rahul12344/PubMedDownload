gene expression plasmodium falciparum tightly regulated ensure
successful propagation parasite throughout complex life cycle. the
earliest transcriptomics studies p. falciparum suggested cascade of
transcriptional activity course 48-hour intraerythrocytic
developmental cycle (idc); however, just-in-time transcriptional model has
recently challenged findings show importance of
post-transcriptional regulation. explore role transcriptional
regulation, performed first genome-wide nascent rna profiling p.
falciparum. findings indicate majority genes transcribed
simultaneously trophozoite stage idc small
subset genes subject differential transcriptional timing. rna polymerase
ii engaged promoter regions prior transcriptional burst,
suggesting pol ii pausing plays dominant role gene regulation. in
addition, found overall transcriptional program gametocyte
differentiation surprisingly similar idc, exception of
relatively small subsets genes. results study suggest further
characterization molecular players regulate stage-specific gene
expression pol ii pausing contribute continuous search novel 
antimalarial drug targets.
