cgmp-dependent protein kinases (pkg) exhibit diverse physiological functions in
the mammalian system e.g., vascular gastrointestinal smooth muscles, in
platelets, kidney, bone growth, nociception central nervous
system. furthermore, pkg found insects malaria parasite
plasmodium falciparum. two different genes pkg exist: a) pkg-i gene that
is expressed cytosolic pkg-iα pkg-iβ isoform, b) pkg-ii gene, which
expresses membrane associated pkg-ii protein. enzyme kinetics, the
localization substrates pkg enzymes differ utilizing different
physiological functions. various inhibitors pkg developed directed
against diverse functional regions kinase. inhibitors pkg have
been used analyse specific functions enzymes. review article 
will summarize different inhibitors regarding specificity their
present applications vitro vivo. furthermore, discussed that
the distinct inhibition pkg enzymes could used valuable
pharmacological target e.g., treatment cardiovascular diseases,
diarrhea, cancer malaria.
