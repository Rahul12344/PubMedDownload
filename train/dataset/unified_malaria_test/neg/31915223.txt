protein kinases important mediators signal transduction cellular
pathways, calcium-dependent protein kinases (cdpks) compose unique class of
calcium-dependent kinases present plants apicomplexans, including
plasmodium parasites, causative agents malaria. asexual stage
of infection, human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum grows inside red
blood cells, p. falciparum calcium-dependent protein kinase 5 (pfcdpk5) is
required egress host cell. paper, characterize the
late-schizont-stage p. falciparum phosphoproteome performing large-scale
phosphoproteomic profiling tightly synchronized parasites prior to
egress, identifying 2,704 phosphorylation sites 919 proteins. using a
conditional knockdown pfcdpk5, identify 58 phosphorylation sites 50
proteins significant reduction levels pfcdpk5-deficient parasites.
furthermore, gene ontology analysis identified proteins reveals enrichment
in transmembrane- membrane-associated proteins proteins associated
with transport activity. among identified proteins pfnpt1, member the
apicomplexan-specific novel putative transporter (npt) family proteins. we
show pfnpt1 potential substrate pfcdpk5 pfnpt1 localizes to
the parasite plasma membrane. importantly, p. falciparum egress relies many
proteins unique apicomplexa therefore attractive targets for
antimalarial therapeutics.importance malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum
is major cause morbidity mortality globally. p. falciparum parasite 
proliferates inside red blood cells blood stage infection, and
egress red blood cell critical parasite survival. p. falciparum
calcium-dependent protein kinase 5 (pfcdpk5) essential egress; parasites
deficient pfcdpk5 remain trapped inside host cells. used a
label-free quantitative mass spectrometry approach identify the
phosphoproteome schizont-stage parasites prior egress identify 50 
proteins display significant reduction phosphorylation in
pfcdpk5-deficient parasites. show member apicomplexan-specific
transport protein family, pfnpt1 potential substrate pfcdpk5 is
localized parasite plasma membrane. p. falciparum egress requires several 
proteins present human cells, thus making pathway ideal target for
new therapeutics.
