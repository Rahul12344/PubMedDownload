genetic cross powerful tool studying malaria genes contributing drug 
resistance, parasite development, pathogenesis. cloning identification of
recombinant progeny (rp) laborious expensive, especially large
proportion progeny derived self-fertilization present uncloned
progeny genetic cross. since frequency cross-fertilization affects
the number recombinant progeny genetic cross, important optimize
the procedure genetic cross maximize cross-fertilization. we
investigated factors might influence chances obtaining rp 
genetic cross showed different plasmodium yoelii
strains/subspecies/clones unique abilities producing oocysts mosquito
midgut. genetic cross performed two parents producing different
numbers functional gametocytes, ratio parental parasites must be
adjusted improve chance obtaining rp. optimized parental ratio could
be established based oocyst counts single infection parent before
crossing experiments, may reflect efficiency gametocyte production
and/or fertilization. timing progeny cloning also important; cloning of
genetic cross progeny mice directly infected sporozoites (vs. frozen
blood needle passage) time parasitemia low (usually <1%) could
improve chance obtaining rp. study provides optimized protocol for
efficiently cloning rps genetic cross malaria parasites.
