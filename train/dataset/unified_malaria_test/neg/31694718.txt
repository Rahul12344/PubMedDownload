background: malaria rapid diagnostic tests based histidine-rich protein-2 have
played vital role improving malaria case management surveillance
particularly africa, plasmodium falciparum predominant. however,
their usefulness threatened emergence gene deletion p.
falciparum histidine rich protein 2 (pfhrp2) p. falciparum histidine rich
protein 3 (pfhrp3). use standard recommended methods key accurate
investigation, confirmation reporting pfhrp2 pfhrp3 gene deletion.
methods: systematic review conducted assess status, methods and
approaches used investigation, confirmation reporting of
pfhrp2 pfhrp3 gene deletion africa. online search done using pubmed
and medline google scholar articles published english pfhrp2/3 gene
deletion africa. relevant articles met inclusion criteria were
summarized assessed based protocol recommended world health
organization confirmation reporting pfhrp2/3 gene deletion.
results: search identified total 18 articles 14 (77.7%)
fulfilled criteria inclusion retained review. articles
were distributed across 12 countries pfhrp2 pfhrp3 gene deletion
studies conducted reported. level pfhrp2/3 gene deletion across
selected studies africa ranged highest 62% lowest 0.4%. 
was wide variation methods approaches including study designs, size and
sampling whether pfhrp2 pfhrp3 double deletions pfhrp2 single
deletion investigated, wide variation laboratory methods.
conclusion: based review, evidence presence pfhrp2/3
gene-deleted p. falciparum parasites africa. approaches methods used
for investigation, confirmation reporting pfhrp2/3 deleted parasites 
varied studies across countries. countries considering plans
to investigate, confirm report pfhrp2/3 deletion use recommended
standard harmonized methods prevent unnecessary recommendations costly
switch rdts africa.
