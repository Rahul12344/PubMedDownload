introduction: complexity immunity malaria well known, clear
correlates protection malaria established. better
understanding immune markers induced candidate malaria vaccines would
greatly enhance vaccine development, immunogenicity monitoring estimation 
vaccine efficacy field. previously reported complete partial
efficacy experimental sporozoite challenge several vaccine regimens in
healthy malaria-naïve subjects oxford. include prime-boost regimen
with rts,s/as02a modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) expressing csp
antigen, dna-prime, mva-boost regimen expressing trap antigens.
using samples trials performed transcriptional profiling, allowing 
a global assessment responses vaccination.
methods: used human refseq8 bead chips illumina examine gene
expression using pbmc (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) 16 human
volunteers. focus antigen-specific changes, comparisons made between
pbmc stimulated csp trap peptide pools unstimulated pbmc post
vaccination. correlated gene expression protection malaria
in human plasmodium falciparum malaria challenge model.
results: differentially expressed genes induced vaccine regimens were
predominantly ifn-γ pathway. gene set enrichment analysis revealed
antigen-specific effects genes associated ifn induction proteasome
modules vaccination. genes associated ifn induction antigen
presentation modules positively enriched subjects complete
protection malaria challenge, genes associated haemopoietic stem 
cells, regulatory monocytes myeloid lineage modules negatively
enriched protected subjects.
conclusions: results represent novel insights immune repertoires
involved malaria vaccination.
