in effort control eventually eliminate malaria, development of
transmission-blocking vaccines long sought. however, antigens have
been evaluated clinical trials, often due limitations expression and
purification antigen sufficient yield quality. pfs230, surface
antigen gametocytes, recently advanced clinical evaluation a
conjugate vaccine using pseudomonas aeruginosa exoprotein carrier protein. 
here continue build upon prior work developing pfs230 candidate the
baculovirus system, pfs230c1 (aa 443-731), systematic process development
efforts improve yield purity. various insect cells including high five,
sf9 super sf9 first evaluated quality quantity antigen, along
with three insect cell media. selection sf9 cells, intact pfs230c1
was expressed harvested 48 h downstream development. downstream
process, utilizing immobilized metal affinity column (imac), followed ion
exchange (iex) membranes (mustang s) finally iex chromatography (deae)
yielded pure pfs230c1 protein. complete process repeated three times at
the 20 l scale. support eventual chemistry manufacturing controls
(cmc) pfs230c1, analytical tools, including monoclonal antibodies, were
developed characterize identity, integrity, purity pfs230c1. 
analytical tools, taken combination optimized process, were
implemented current good manufacturing practices (cgmp) mind the
ultimate objective phase clinical trials.
