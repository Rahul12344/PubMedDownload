background: haemoglobinopathies constitute commonest recessive monogenic
disorders worldwide, treatment affected individuals presents a
substantial global disease burden. β-thalassaemia characterised reduced
synthesis (β+) absence (βo) β-globin chains hba molecule,
resulting accumulation excess unbound α-globin chains precipitate in
erythroid precursors bone marrow mature erythrocytes, leading
to ineffective erythropoiesis peripheral haemolysis. approximately 1.5% of
the global population heterozygotes (carriers) β-thalassemias; there
is high incidence populations mediterranean basin, throughout the
middle east, indian subcontinent, southeast asia, melanesia the
pacific islands.
aim: principal aim paper review, historical standpoint, 
our knowledge ancient disease, β-thalassemias, particular,
when, way β-thalassemia spread worldwide reach high
incidences certain populations.
results: mutations involving β-globin gene common cause of
genetic disorders humans. date, 350 β-thalassaemia mutations have
been reported. considering current distribution β- thalassemia, wide
diversity mutations small number specific mutations individual
populations, seems unlikely β-thalassemia originated single place
and time.
conclusions: various processes known determine frequency genetic
disease human populations. however, almost impossible decide 
extent process responsible presence particular genetic
disease. wide spectrum β-thalassemia mutations could well explained 
looking geographical distribution, history malaria, wars,
invasions, mass migrations, consanguinity, settlements. analysis the
distribution molecular spectrum haemoglobinopathies allows the
development improvement diagnostic tests management these
disorders.
