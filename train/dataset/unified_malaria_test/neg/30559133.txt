the potential spread antimalarial drug resistance africa, particular for
artemisinins key partner drugs, major concern. surveyed plasmodium
falciparum genetic markers associated drug sensitivity 3 occasions at
∼6-month intervals 2016 2017 10 sites representing range of
epidemiological settings uganda. putative drug transporters, found
continued evolution toward wild-type sequences associated increased
sensitivity chloroquine. pfcrt k76t, 2017 prevalence wild
type >60% sites >90% 6 sites. pfmdr1 n86y d1246y
alleles, wild type prevalence ranged 80 100%. found low prevalence 
k13 propeller domain mutations, associated artemisinin resistance 
in asia, one mutation previously identified northern uganda, 675v, was
seen 2.0% samples, including 5.5% 3 northernmost sites.
amplification pfmdr1 plasmepsin2 genes, associated elsewhere with
decreased sensitivity lumefantrine piperaquine, respectively, seen 
<1% samples. antifolate targets pfdhfr pfdhps, 5 mutations
previously associated resistance common, pfdhfr 164l and
pfdhps 581g mutations associated higher-level resistance seen at
multiple sites, although prevalence clearly increase time. overall, 
changes consistent selective pressure national treatment
regimen, artemether-lumefantrine, increased sensitivity chloroquine, 
with poor efficacy antifolates. strong evidence resistance artemisinins
was seen. continued surveillance markers predict antimalarial drug
sensitivity warranted.
