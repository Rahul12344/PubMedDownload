background: genetic diversity plasmodium falciparum poses major threat to
malaria control elimination interventions. characterization genetic
diversity p. falciparum strains used assess intensity parasite
transmission identify potential deficiencies malaria control programmes,
which provides vital information evaluating malaria elimination efforts. 
study investigated p. falciparum genetic diversity genotype multiplicity 
of infection parasite isolates cases uncomplicated p. falciparum
malaria southwest ethiopia.
methods: total 80 p. falciparum microscopy qpcr positive blood samples
were collected study participants aged 6 months 60 years, visited the
health facilities study evaluating efficacy artemether-lumefantrine
from september-december, 2017. polymorphic regions msp-1 msp-2 were
genotyped nested polymerase chain reactions (npcr) followed gel
electrophoresis fragment analysis.
results: 80 qpcr-positive samples analysed polymorphisms msp-1 and
msp-2 genes, efficiency msp-1 msp-2 gene amplification reactions 
family-specific primers 95% 98.8%, respectively. allelic variation of
90% (72/80) msp-1 86.2% (69/80) msp-2 observed. k1 the
predominant msp-1 allelic family detected 20.8% (15/72) samples
followed mad20 ro33. within msp-2, allelic family fc27 showed higher
frequency (26.1%) compared ic/3d7 (15.9%). ten different alleles observed
in msp-1 6 alleles k1, 3 alleles mad20 1 allele ro33. in
msp-2, 19 individual alleles detected 10 alleles fc27 9 alleles
for 3d7. eighty percent (80%) isolates multiple genotypes overall 
mean multiplicity infection 3.2 (95% ci 2.87-3.46). heterozygosity
indices 0.43 0.85 msp-1 msp-2, respectively. no
significant association multiplicity infection age parasite
density.
conclusions: study revealed high levels genetic diversity mixed-strain
infections p. falciparum populations chewaka district, ethiopia, suggesting
that endemicity level malaria transmission remain high that
strengthened control efforts needed ethiopia.
