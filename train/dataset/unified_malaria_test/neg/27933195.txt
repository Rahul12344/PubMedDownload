background: complement receptor 1 (cr1) plays important role immune complex
clearance opsonisation possibly protects subjects development of
autoantibodies. lower cr1 expression associated susceptibility to
systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). contrast, subjects displaying lower cr1
expression protected severe manifestations falciparum malaria.
this study first kind investigate association cr1
variants development sle p. falciparum endemic population from
odisha, india.
methods: cr1 polymorphisms (intron 27 (a>t), exon 22 (a>g) exon 33 (g>c))
were typed pcr restriction length polymorphism 297 cases female
patients sle 300 age-matched sex-matched healthy controls from
malaria endemic areas odisha, india. cr1 expression monocytes was
quantified flow cytometry.
results: homozygous mutants cr1 exon 22 (gg) exon 33 (gg) their
minor alleles associated susceptibility sle. furthermore, patients
with sle harboured gg genotype exon 33 polymorphism a
3.12-fold higher chance developing lupus nephritis. cr1 exon (22 33)
variants associated lowered cr1 expression monocytes patients
with sle healthy controls. patients lupus nephritis showed
significantly diminished cr1 expression without renal involvement
(p=0.01).
conclusions: results present study demonstrate common cr1 exon
variants associated diminished cr1 expression monocytes increased
susceptibility development sle lupus nephritis malaria endemic
area.
