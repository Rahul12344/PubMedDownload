a collaborative validation study performed evaluate performance a
new u.s. food drug administration method developed detection the
protozoan parasite, cyclospora cayetanensis, cilantro raspberries. the
method includes sample preparation step oocysts recovered from
produce using enhanced produce washing solution containing 0.1% alconox 
commercially available method disrupt c. cayetanensis oocysts extract 
dna. real-time pcr assay targeting c. cayetanensis 18s rdna gene an
internal amplification control monitor pcr inhibition provides
species-specific identification. five laboratories blindly analyzed total of
319 samples consisting 25 g cilantro 50 g raspberries were
either uninoculated artificially contaminated c. cayetanensis oocysts.
detection rates cilantro inoculated 200, 10, 5 oocysts, 100%,
80%, 31%, respectively. raspberries, detection rates samples
inoculated 200, 10, 5 oocysts 100%, 90% 50%, respectively. 
uninoculated samples, dna blank extracts, no-template pcr controls were
negative. reproducibility laboratories analysts high the
method shown effective analytical tool detection of
c. cayetanensis produce.
