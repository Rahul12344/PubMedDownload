malaria causes worldwide morbidity mortality, chemotherapy remains 
an excellent means malaria control, drug-resistant parasites necessitate the
discovery new antimalarials. peptidases promising class drug targets 
and perform several important roles plasmodium falciparum erythrocytic
life cycle. herein, report multidisciplinary effort combining activity-based
protein profiling, biochemical, peptidomic approaches functionally analyze
two genetically essential p. falciparum metallo-aminopeptidases (maps), pfa-m1
and pf-lap. synthesis suite activity-based probes (abps)
based general map inhibitor scaffold, bestatin, generated specific abps
for two enzymes. specific inhibition pfa-m1 caused swelling the
parasite digestive vacuole prevented proteolysis hemoglobin (hb)-derived
oligopeptides, likely starving parasite resulting death. contrast,
inhibition pf-lap lethal parasites early life cycle, prior to
the onset hb degradation suggesting pf-lap essential role outside 
of hb digestion.
