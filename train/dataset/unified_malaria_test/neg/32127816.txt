introduction: despite significant decline senegal, malaria remains burden 
in various parts country. assessment multiplicity plasmodium
falciparum infection genetic diversity parasites population could help 
monitoring malaria control.
objective: assess genetic diversity multiplicity infection p.
falciparum isolates three areas senegal different malaria
transmissions.
methods: 136 blood samples collected patients uncomplicated p.
falciparum malaria pikine, kedougou thies. polymorphic loci msp1 2 
(merozoite surface protein-1 2) genes amplified nested pcr.
results: msp1gene, k1 allelic family predominant frequency 71%.
concerning msp2 gene, ic3d7 allelic family represented with
frequency 83%. multiclonal isolates found 36% 31% msp1et msp2
genes respectively. moi found areas 2.56 statistically
different areas (p=0.024). low intermediate genetic diversity were
found heterozygosity range (he=0,394-0,637) low genetic differentiation 
(fst msp1= 0.011; fst msp2=0.017) observed p. falciparum population 
within country.
conclusion: low moderate genetic diversity p.falciparum strains moi
disparities found senegal.
