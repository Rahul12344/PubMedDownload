x-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) a- deficiency prevalent in
sub-saharan africa populations, associated protection from
severe malaria. whether females and/or males protected g6pd deficiency 
uncertain, due part g6pd malaria phenotypic complexity and
misclassification. almost large association studies genotyped limited 
number g6pd snps (e.g. g6pd202 / g6pd376), approach too
blunt capture complete epidemiological picture. identified 68
g6pd polymorphisms analysed 29 (i.e. minor allele
frequency greater 1%) 983 severe malaria cases controls tanzania. 
we establish, across number snps including g6pd376, female
heterozygotes protected severe malaria. haplotype analysis reveals the
g6pd locus balancing selection, suggesting mechanism protection 
relying alleles modest frequency avoiding fixation, protection
provided g6pd deficiency severe malaria offset increased risk of
life-threatening complications. study also demonstrates much-needed 
large-scale studies severe malaria g6pd enzymatic function across african 
populations require identification analysis full repertoire of
g6pd genetic markers.
