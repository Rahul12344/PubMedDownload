background: malaria yemen mainly caused plasmodium falciparum 25% of
the population high risk. sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) used as
monotherapy p. falciparum. emergence chloroquine resistance led the
shift anti-malarial treatment policy yemen artemisinin-based combination
therapy, artesunate (as) plus sp first-line therapy uncomplicated 
malaria artemether-lumefantrine second-line treatment. study aimed to
screen mutations dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) dihydropteroate
synthetase (dhps) genes associated sp resistance among p. falciparum
population hadhramout governorate, yemen.
methods: genomic dna extracted dried blood spots 137 p. falciparum
isolates collected community-based study. dna amplified using nested
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) subsequently sequenced pfdhfr pfdhps 
genes. sequences analysed mutations pfdhfr gene codons 51, 59, 108,
and 164 pfdhps gene codons 436, 437, 540.
results: total 128 114 p. falciparum isolates successfully
sequenced pfdhfr pfdhps genes, respectively. pfdhfr mutant allele
(i51 n108) p. falciparum population frequency 84%. pfdhfr r59
mutant allele detected one isolate. mutation codon 437 (g437) the
pfdhps gene detected 44.7% falciparum malaria isolates. frequencies 
pfdhfr double mutant genotype (i51c59n108i164) pfdhfr/pfdhps triple mutant
genotype (i51c59n108i164-s436g437k540) 82.8 39.3%, respectively. one
isolate harboured pfdhfr triple mutant genotype (i51, r59, n108, i164) and
pfdhfr/pfdhps quadruple mutant genotype (i51r59n108i164-s436g437k540).
conclusion: high frequencies pfdhfr pfdhps mutant alleles genotypes in
p. falciparum population hadhramout, yemen, highlight risk developing
resistance sp, partner drug as, subsequently expose the
parasite monotherapy increasing potential emergence as
resistance. study findings necessitate continuous monitoring efficacy 
of national anti-malarial drugs policy yemen. addition, monitoring sp
efficacy using molecular markers shown practical informative
method monitoring partner drug as.
