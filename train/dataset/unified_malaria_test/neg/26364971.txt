the apicomplexan order haemosporida clade unicellular blood parasites
that infect variety reptilian, avian mammalian hosts. among the
agents human malaria, parasites genus plasmodium, pose major
threat human health. illuminating evolutionary history haemosporida may
help us understanding enormous biological diversity, well tracing 
the multiple host switches associated acquisitions novel life-history
traits. however, deep-level phylogenetic relationships among major
haemosporidian clades remained enigmatic datasets employed in
phylogenetic analyses severely limited either gene coverage taxon
sampling. using pcr-based approach employs novel set primers, we
sequenced fragments 21 nuclear genes seven haemosporidian parasites of
the genera leucocytozoon, haemoproteus, parahaemoproteus, polychromophilus and
plasmodium. addition genomic data 25 apicomplexan species, the
unreduced alignment comprised 20,580 bp 32 species. phylogenetic analyses
were performed based nucleotide, codon amino acid data employing bayesian 
inference, maximum likelihood maximum parsimony. analyses resulted in
highly congruent topologies. found consistent support basal position 
leucocytozoon within haemosporida. contrast previous studies, we
recovered sister group relationship genera polychromophilus and
plasmodium. within plasmodium, sauropsid mammal-infecting lineages were
recovered sister clades. support relationships high nearly
all trees, revealing novel phylogeny haemosporida, robust the
choice outgroup method tree inference.
