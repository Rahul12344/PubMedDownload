insects express chemical receptors within sensory neurons activated by
specific cues environment, thereby influencing acquisition critical
resources. significant gap current understanding insect chemical
ecology defining molecular mechanisms underlie sensitivity to
plant-emitted volatiles. linalool commonly-occurring monoterpene has
various effects insect behavior, either acting attractant a
repellent, existing nature one two possible stereoisomers,
(r)-(-)-linalool (s)-(+)-linalool. study, used cell-based
functional assay identify linalool structurally-related compounds as
ligands odorant receptor 29, labellum-expressed receptor malaria
vector mosquito, anopheles gambiae (agamor29). (r)-(-)-linalool activates
agamor29, mixture (r) (s) stereoisomers activates receptor 
higher potency, implying enantiomeric selectivity. orthologs or29 present 
in genomes anophelines within cellia subgenus. conservation of
this receptor across anopheline lineages suggests ecologically
important compound might serve attraction cue nectar-seeking
mosquitoes. moreover, characterization mosquito terpene receptor could
serve foundation future ligand-receptor studies plant volatiles and
for discovery compounds integrated push-pull vector
control strategies.
