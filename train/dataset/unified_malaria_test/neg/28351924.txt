the target rapamycin complex 1 (torc1) pathway highly conserved signaling
pathway across eukaryotes integrates nutrient stress signals regulate
the cellular growth rate transition maintenance dormancy. the
majority pathway's components, including central tor kinase, been
lost apicomplexan lineage, unknown organisms detect
and respond nutrient starvation absence. plasmodium falciparum encodes 
a putative ortholog rna polymerase (pol) iii repressor maf1, has
been demonstrated modulate pol iii transcription tor-dependent manner 
a number organisms. here, investigate role p. falciparum maf1
(pfmaf1) regulating rna pol iii expression conditions nutrient
starvation stresses. using transposon insertion mutant an
altered maf1 expression profile, demonstrated proper maf1 expression is
necessary survival dormancy-like state induced prolonged amino acid
starvation needed full recovery stresses slow stall
the parasite cell cycle. maf1 mutant defective downregulation of
pre-trna synthesis nutrient-limiting conditions, indicating the
function maf1 stress-responsive regulator structural rna transcription
is conserved p. falciparum recent work demonstrated parasites
carrying artemisinin-resistant k13 alleles display enhanced ability recover
from drug-induced growth retardation. show one artemisinin-resistant
line displays greater regulation pre-trna expression higher survival upon 
prolonged amino acid starvation, suggesting overlapping, pfmaf1-associated
pathways may regulate growth recovery artemisinin treatment amino
acid starvation.importance eukaryote organisms sense changes environment
and integrate information signaling pathways activate response
programs ensure survival. tor pathway well-studied signaling pathway 
found throughout eukaryotes known integrate variety signals to
regulate organismal growth response starvation stresses. the
human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum appears lost tor pathway
over course evolution, unclear parasite modulates its
growth response starvation drug treatment. here, show maf1, a
protein regulated tor eukaryotes, plays important role in
maintaining parasite's viability face starvation forms of
stress. suggests pfmaf1 component yet-to-be-described
nutrient stress response pathway.
