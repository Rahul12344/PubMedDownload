the evolution antibiotic resistance among bacteria threatens continued
ability treat infectious diseases. need sustainable strategies cure
bacterial infections never greater. far, attempts restore
susceptibility resistance arisen unsuccessful, including
restrictions prescribing [1] antibiotic cycling [2], [3]. part the
problem may efforts implemented different classes unrelated
antibiotics, relied removal resistance random loss resistance
genes bacterial populations (drift). here, show alternating
structurally similar antibiotics restore susceptibility antibiotics 
resistance evolved. found resistance phenotypes conferred by
variant alleles resistance gene encoding tem β-lactamase (bla(tem))
varied greatly among 15 different β-lactam antibiotics. captured those
differences characterizing complete adaptive landscapes resistance
alleles bla(tem-50) bla(tem-85), differs ancestor
bla(tem-1) four mutations. identified pathways landscapes
where selection increased resistance moved repeating cycle among a
limited set alleles antibiotics alternated. results showed that
susceptibility antibiotics sustainably renewed cycling structurally 
similar antibiotics. anticipate results may provide conceptual
framework managing antibiotic resistance. approach may also guide
sustainable cycling drugs used treat malaria hiv.
