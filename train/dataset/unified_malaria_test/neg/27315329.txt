genome editing crispr (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats)/cas9 (crispr-associated gene 9) system transformative in
biology. originally discovered adaptive prokaryotic immune system,
crispr/cas9 repurposed genome editing broad range model
organisms, yeast mammalian cells. protist parasites unicellular
organisms producing important human diseases affect millions people
around world. many diseases, malaria, chagas disease,
leishmaniasis cryptosporidiosis, effective treatments or
vaccines available. recent adaptation crispr/cas9 technology to
several protist models playing key role functional study of
their proteins, characterization metabolic pathways, the
understanding biology, facilitate search new
chemotherapeutic targets. work review recent studies the
crispr/cas9 system adapted protist parasites, particularly to
apicomplexans trypanosomatids, emphasizing different molecular strategies
used genome editing organism, well advantages. also
discuss potential usefulness technology green alga
chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
