malaria remains one world's common infectious diseases, being
responsible deaths communicable disease except
tuberculosis. strong evidence tumour necrosis factor α and
interleukin-1β important contributors systemic disease caused the
infection plasmodium falciparum. circulating levels tnfα increased
after infection, consequence stimulation monocyte-macrophages by
infected red blood cells parasite products, shown vitro malaria 
pigment haemozoin. tnfα turn enhances synthesis metalloproteinase-9 
monocytes macrophages. metalloproteinase-9 acts extracellular matrix
but also non-traditional substrates, including precursors inflammatory
cytokines, proteolytically activated contribute the
amplification inflammatory response. aim present work to
establish whether artemisinin derivatives artemisone, artesunate and
dihydroartemisinin possess immuno-modulatory properties. particular, is
necessary evaluate effects mrna levels secretion mmp-9 
human monocytic cell line (thp-1 cells) stimulated hemozoin tnfα. 5μm of
each derivative, although artemisinin itself, induced significantly inhibited
tnfα production. artesunate, artemisone dha antagonized haemozoin-induced
mmp-9 secretion 25%, 24% 50%, respectively. mrna levels also
depressed 14%, 20% 27%, respectively, thus reflecting part effect
observed protein production. derivatives significantly inhibited both
tnfα-induced mmp-9 secretion mrna levels greater extent haemozoin
itself. haemozoin tnfα increased nf-κb driven transcription 11 and
7.7 fold, respectively. artesunate, artemisone dha inhibited
haemozoin-induced nf-κb driven transcription 28%, 34%, 49%, respectively. 
similarly derivatives, artemisinin, prevented tnfα-induced nf-κb
driven transcription 47-51%. study indicates artemisinins may
attenuate inflammatory potential monocytes vivo. thus, addition to
direct anti-parasitic activities, beneficial clinical effects artemisinins
for treatment malaria include apparent ability attenuate the
inflammatory response, thus limiting risk progression severe
form disease, including onset cerebral malaria.
