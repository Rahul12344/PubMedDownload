molecular surveillance drug resistance genes parasite used for
monitoring/surveillance drug resistance endemic malaria areas. we
report prevalence single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) dihydrofolate 
reductase (dhfr) gene nucleotide sequence plasmodium falciparum from
different regions india. found markedly prevalent mutants evident p.
falciparum infections n51i, c59r, 108n i164l. results indicate p.
falciparum populations regions show increase prevalence of
polymorphisms, likely reflecting different selective pressures found in
humans mosquitoes. molecular surveillance serve useful tool to
monitor prevalence/emergence resistant genotypes within endemic
populations serve determining efficacy antimalarial drugs.
