information population age structure mosquitoes natural conditions is
fundamental understanding vectorial capacity crucial assessing 
the impact vector control measures malaria transmission. transcriptional
profiling proposed method predicting mosquito age aedes and
anopheles mosquitoes, however, whether new method adequate natural
conditions unknown. study tests applicability transcriptional
profiling age-grading anopheles gambiae, important malaria vector
in africa. transcript abundance two an. gambiae genes, agap009551 and
agap011615, measured aging laboratory field conditions in
three mosquito strains. age-dependent monotonic changes transcript levels were
observed strains evaluated. genes validated age-grading
biomarkers using mark, release recapture (mrr) method. mrr method
determined good correspondence actual predicted age, thus
demonstrated value age classifications derived transcriptional
profiling two genes. technique used establish age
structure mosquito populations two malaria-endemic areas western
kenya. population age structure determined transcriptional profiling
method consistent based mosquito parity. study demonstrates
that transcription profiling method based two genes valuable age
determination natural mosquitoes, providing new approach determining a
key life history trait malaria vectors.
