background: temotu province, solomon islands progressing toward malaria
elimination. baseline survey conducted 2008 showed plasmodium
infections province low parasite density asymptomatic
infections. better understand mechanisms underlying malaria transmission
characteristics genetic diversity relationships among plasmodium falciparum
and plasmodium vivax populations province examined.
methods: forty-five p. falciparum 67 p. vivax samples collected 2008
baseline survey successfully genotyped using eight p. falciparum seven
p. vivax microsatellite markers. genetic diversity, relationships and
distribution p. falciparum p. vivax populations analysed.
results: plasmodium falciparum population exhibited low diversity 19
haplotypes identified closely related clusters indicating clonal
expansion. interestingly, dominant haplotype significantly associated 
fever high parasite density. contrast, p. vivax population highly 
diverse 58 haplotypes identified closely related. parasite
populations different islands province showed low genetic
differentiation.
conclusion: low diversity clonal population p. falciparum population
may partially account clinical immunity developed illness. however,
it possible importation new p. falciparum strain major cause
of illness. high diversity p. vivax population low relatedness between
strains suggested clinical immunity p. vivax may maintained different
mechanisms. genetic diversity, population structure distribution of
strains indicate transmission p. falciparum low, p. vivax
was still high 2008. data useful assessing changes in
malaria transmission resulting interventions.
