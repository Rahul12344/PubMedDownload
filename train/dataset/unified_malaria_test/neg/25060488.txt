background: areas morphologically indistinguishable malaria
mosquitoes anopheles gambiae giles an. arabiensis patton sympatric,
hybrids detected occasionally via species-diagnostic molecular assays. an.
gambiae an. arabiensis exhibit pre- post-reproductive mating
barriers, swarms largely species-specific male f1 (first-generation)
hybrids sterile. consequently advanced-stage hybrids (back-crosses parental
species), would represent route potentially-adaptive introgression,
are expected rare natural populations. yet use one two
physically linked single-locus diagnostic assays renders indistinguishable
from f1 hybrids levels interspecific gene flow unknown.
methods: used data 350 polymorphic autosomal snps investigate
post f1 gene flow via patterns genomic admixture an. gambiae an.
arabiensis eastern uganda. simulations used investigate the
statistical power detect hybrids different levels crossing to
identify hybrid category significantly admixed genotypes could represent.
results: range admixture proportions detected 11 field-collected
hybrids identified via single-locus species-diagnostic pcrs. comparison of
admixture data simulations indicated least seven hybrids
were advanced generation crosses, backcrosses species identified. in
addition, 36 individuals typing an. gambiae an. arabiensis that
exhibited outlying admixture proportions, ten identified significantly
mixed backcrosses, least four second third generation
crosses.
conclusions: results show hybrids detected using standard diagnostics
will often hybrid generations beyond f1, study area around 5% 
(95% confidence intervals 3%-9%) apparently 'pure' species samples may also be
backcrosses. likely underestimate rapidly-declining
detection power beyond first two backcross generations. post-f1 gene flow
occurs far inconsequential rate an. gambiae an. arabiensis,
and, especially traits strong selection, could readily lead adaptive
introgression genetic variants relevant vector control.
