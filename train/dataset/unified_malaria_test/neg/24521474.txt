background: 19-kda c-terminal region merozoite surface protein-1 of
the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum (pfmsp-119) constitutes the
major component surface merozoites considered one the
leading candidates asexual blood stage vaccines. protein exhibits
a level sequence variation may compromise effectiveness vaccine,
the global sequence diversity pfmsp-119 subjected extensive
research, especially malaria endemic areas. thailand, pfmsp-119 sequences
have derived single parasite population tak province, located
along thailand-myanmar border, since 1995. however, extent sequence
variation spatiotemporal patterns msp-119 haplotypes along the
thai borders laos cambodia unknown.
methods: sixty-three isolates p. falciparum five geographically isolated 
populations along thai borders myanmar, laos cambodia three
transmission seasons 2002 2008 collected culture-adapted.
the msp-1 gene block 17 sequenced analysed allelic diversity,
frequency distribution patterns pfmsp-119 haplotypes individual
populations. pfmsp-119 haplotype patterns compared parasite
populations infer population structure genetic differentiation 
malaria parasite.
results: five conserved polymorphic positions, accounted five distinct 
haplotypes, pfmsp-119 identified. differences prevalence of
pfmsp-119 haplotypes detected different geographical regions, the
highest levels genetic diversity found kanchanaburi ranong
provinces along thailand-myanmar border trat province located the
thailand-cambodia border. despite variability, distribution patterns 
individual pfmsp-119 haplotypes seemed similar across country 
over three malarial transmission seasons, suggesting gene flow may
operate parasite populations circulating thailand three
neighboring countries.
conclusion: major msp-119 haplotypes p. falciparum populations all
endemic populations three transmission seasons thailand were
identified, providing basic information common haplotypes msp-119 
is use malaria vaccine development inferring population structure 
of p. falciparum populations thailand.
