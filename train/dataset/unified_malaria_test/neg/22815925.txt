background: mitochondria perform multiple roles cell biology, acting the
site aerobic energy-transducing pathways important source of
reactive oxygen species (ros) modulate redox metabolism.
methodology/principal findings: demonstrate novel member the
mitochondrial transporter protein family, anopheles gambiae mitochondrial carrier
1 (agmc1), required maintain mitochondrial membrane potential mosquito
midgut cells modulates epithelial responses plasmodium infection. agmc1
silencing reduces mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting increased
proton-leak uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. metabolic changes 
reduce midgut ros generation increase a. gambiae susceptibility plasmodium
infection.
conclusion: provide direct experimental evidence indicating ros derived
from mitochondria modulate mosquito epithelial responses plasmodium
infection.
