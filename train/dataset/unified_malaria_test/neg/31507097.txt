metatranscriptomics powerful method studying composition and
function complex microbial communities. application metatranscriptomics
to multispecies parasite infections particular interest, research on
parasite evolution diversification hampered technical challenges 
to genome-scale dna sequencing. particular, blood parasites vertebrates are
abundant diverse although often occur low infection intensities and
exist multispecies infections, rendering isolation genomic sequence
data challenging. here, use birds diverse haemosporidian parasites
to illustrate potential metatranscriptome sequencing generate large
quantities genome-wide sequence data multiple blood parasite species
simultaneously. used rna-sequencing 24 blood samples songbirds in
north america show metatranscriptomes yield large proportions of
haemosporidian protein-coding gene repertoires even infections low
intensity (<0.1% red blood cells infected) consist multiple parasite taxa.
by bioinformatically separating host parasite transcripts assigning 
to haemosporidian genus origin, found transcriptomes detected ~23%
more total parasite infections across samples identified using
microscopy dna barcoding. single-species infections, obtained data for
>1,300 loci samples low 0.03% parasitaemia, number of
loci increasing infection intensity. total, provide data 1,502
single-copy orthologous loci phylogenetically diverse set 33
haemosporidian mitochondrial lineages. metatranscriptomic approach described 
here potential accelerate ecological evolutionary research on
haemosporidians diverse parasites.
