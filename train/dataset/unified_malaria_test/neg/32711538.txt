background: high rates dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (dha-ppq) treatment
failures documented uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum in
cambodia. genetic markers plasmepsin 2 (pfpm2), exonuclease (pfexo) and
chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) genes associated ppq
resistance used monitoring prevalence drug resistance and
guiding malaria drug treatment policy.
methods: examine relative contribution marker ppq resistance,
in vitro culture ppq survival assay performed seventeen p.
falciparum isolates northern cambodia, presence e415g-exo and
pfcrt mutations (t93s, h97y, f145i, i218f, m343l, c350r, g353v) well as
pfpm2 copy number polymorphisms determined. parasites cloned by
limiting dilution cloned parasites tested drug susceptibility.
isobolographic analysis several drug combinations standard clones and
newly cloned p. falciparum cambodian isolates also determined.
results: characterization culture-adapted isolates revealed the
presence novel pfcrt mutations (t93s, h97y, f145i, i218f) e415g-exo
mutation confer ppq-resistance, absence pfpm2 amplification. in
vitro testing ppq resistant parasites demonstrated bimodal dose-response,
the existence swollen digestive vacuole phenotype, increased
susceptibility quinine, chloroquine, mefloquine lumefantrine. further
characterize drug sensitivity, parental parasites cloned clonal
line, 14-b5, identified sensitive artemisinin piperaquine, but
resistant chloroquine. assessment clone panel drug
combinations revealed antagonistic activity six different drug combinations. 
however, mefloquine-proguanil atovaquone-proguanil combinations revealed
synergistic antimalarial activity.
conclusions: surveillance ppq resistance regions relying dha-ppq the
first-line treatment dependent monitoring molecular markers drug 
resistance. p. falciparum harbouring novel pfcrt mutations e415g-exo
mutations displayed ppq resistant phenotype. presence pfpm2 amplification 
was required render parasites ppq resistant suggesting increase
in pfpm2 copy number alone sole modulator ppq resistance. genetic
background circulating field isolates appear play role drug
susceptibility biological responses induced drug combinations. use 
latest field isolates may necessary assessment relevant drug
combinations p. falciparum strains down-selecting novel drug
candidates.
