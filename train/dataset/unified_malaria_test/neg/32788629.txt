micro rnas (mirnas) play crucial regulatory roles multiple biological
processes. recently garnered attention strong influence
on secondary metabolite production plants. role regulation of
artemisinin (art) biosynthesis is, however, fully elucidated. art potent
anti-malarial compound recommended treatment drug-resistant
malaria. produced by artemisia annua (a. annua). the lower in
planta content art necessitates deep understanding regulatory mechanisms 
involved biosynthesis metabolite. study, using modern high
throughput small rna-sequencing illumina nextseq 500 platform for
identification stem-loop rt pcr validation, mirnas identified the
leaf sample of a. annua plant. here, report total 121 mirnas a.
annua target several important genes transcription factors involved in
the biosynthesis art. study revealed presence important
conserved mirna families, mir396, mir319, mir399, mir858, mir5083 mir6111 not
identified far in a. annua. expression patterns correlation between
mirnas corresponding targets different developmental stages the
plant using real-time pcr indicate may influence art accumulation.
these findings thus, open new possibilities rational engineering the
secondary metabolite pathways general art biosynthesis particular.
