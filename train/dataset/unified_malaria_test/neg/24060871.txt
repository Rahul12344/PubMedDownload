the design new antimalarial combinations treat plasmodium falciparum
infections requires drugs that, addition resolving disease symptoms caused 
by asexual blood stage parasites, also interrupt transmission mosquito
vector. gametocytes, essential transmission, develop sexual
blood stage parasites human host 8 12 days most
accessible developmental stage transmission-blocking drugs. considerable
effort currently devoted identifying compounds active mature 
gametocytes. however, investigations drug sensitivity developing
gametocytes, well screening methods identifying inhibitors early
gametocytogenesis, remain scarce. developed luciferase-based
high-throughput screening (hts) assay using tightly synchronous stage iii
gametocytes recombinant p. falciparum line expressing green fluorescent
protein (gfp)-luciferase. assay used evaluate early-stage
gametocytocidal activity mmv malaria box, collection 400 compounds
with known antimalarial (asexual blood stage) activity. screening collection
against early-stage (i iii) gametocytes yielded 64 gametocytocidal compounds
with 50% inhibitory concentrations (ic50s) 2.5 μm. assay is
reproducible suitable screening large compound libraries, 
average percent coefficient variance (%cv) ≤5%, average signal-to-noise 
ratio (s:n) >30, z' ∼0.8. findings highlight need for
screening efforts directed specifically early gametocytogenesis and
indicate importance experimental verification early-stage
gametocytocidal activity development new antimalarial candidates for
combination therapy.
