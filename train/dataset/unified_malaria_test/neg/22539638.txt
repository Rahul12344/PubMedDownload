calcium-dependent protein kinases (cdpks) major effectors calcium
signaling apicomplexan parasites like toxoplasma plasmodium control
important processes parasite life cycle. despite recently reported crystal
structures toxoplasma gondii (tg)cdpks, several important questions about
their regulation remain unanswered. plasmodium falciparum (pf)cdpk1 emerged
as key player life cycle malaria parasite, may involved 
in invasion host cells. molecular modeling site-directed
mutagenesis studies pfcdpk1 suggested several residues regulatory 
domain play dual role, seem contribute stabilization 
the active inactive kinase. mass spectrometry revealed pfcdpk1 was
autophosphorylated several sites; placed strategic
locations therefore found critical kinase activation. the
n-terminal extension pfcdpk1 found important pfcdpk1 activation.
unexpectedly, atp binding site nte pfcdpk1 identified. our
studies highlight several novel features pfcdpk1 regulation, may be
shared members cdpk family. findings may also aid design of
inhibitors important targets, absent host.
