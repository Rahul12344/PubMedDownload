human infections due monkey malaria parasite plasmodium knowlesi is
increasingly reported southeast asian countries specifically
malaysia. parasite causes severe fatal malaria thus need for
urgent measures control. study, level polymorphisms,
haplotypes natural selection full-length pkmsp8 37 clinical samples
from malaysian borneo along 6 lab-adapted strains investigated. low
levels polymorphism observed across full-length gene, double
epidermal growth factor (egf) domains mostly conserved, non-synonymous
substitutions absent. evidence strong negative selection pressure 
non-egf regions found indicating functional constrains acting different
domains. phylogenetic haplotype network analysis identified shared haplotypes and
indicated geographical clustering samples originating peninsular malaysia
and malaysian borneo. first study genetically characterize the
full-length msp8 gene clinical isolates p. knowlesi malaysia;
however, functional characterization would useful future rational 
vaccine design.
