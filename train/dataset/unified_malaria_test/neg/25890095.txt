background: plasmodium knowlesi one monkey malaria parasites can
cause human malaria. duffy binding protein p. knowlesi (pkdbpαii) is
essential parasite's invasion human monkey erythrocytes. a
previous study p. knowlesi clinical isolates peninsular malaysia reported
high level genetic diversity pkdbpαii. furthermore, 36 amino acid
haplotypes identified haplotypes could separated allele
group allele group ii. present study, pkdbpαii clinical
isolates malaysian states sarawak sabah north borneo was
investigated, compared pkdbpαii peninsular malaysia isolates.
methods: blood samples 28 knowlesi malaria patients used. samples
were collected 2011 2013 hospitals north borneo. pkdbpαii
region isolates amplified pcr, cloned escherichia coli, and
sequenced. genetic diversity, natural selection phylogenetics pkdbpαii
haplotypes analysed using mega5 dnasp ver. 5.10.00 programmes.
results: forty-nine pkdbpαii sequences obtained. comparison the
nucleotide level p. knowlesi strain h reference sequence revealed 58
synonymous 102 non-synonymous mutations. analysis mutations showed
that pkdbpαii purifying (negative) selection. amino acid level, 
38 different pkdbpαii haplotypes identified. twelve 28 blood samples 
had mixed haplotype infections. phylogenetic analysis revealed the
haplotypes allele group i, formed sub-group distinct 
from peninsular malaysia. wright's fst fixation index indicated high
genetic differentiation north borneo peninsular malaysia
haplotypes.
conclusions: study first report genetic diversity natural 
selection pkdbpαii p. knowlesi borneo island. pkdbpαii haplotypes 
found study distinct peninsular malaysia. this
difference may attributed geographical separation genetic
markers studied thus far p. knowlesi circumsporozoite protein gene
and small subunit ribosomal rna display differentiation. immune
evasion may possibly reason differentiation.
