there approximately 20 known species genus cryptosporidium, among 
these, 8 infect immunocompetent immunocompromised humans. c. hominis c.
parvum commonly infect humans. differentiating important for
evaluating potential sources infection. report development a
simple accurate real-time pcr-based restriction fragment length polymorphism 
(rflp) method distinguish c. parvum c. hominis. using cp2 gene
as target, found cryptosporidium species yielded 224 bp
products. subsequent rflp method using taqi, 2 bands (99 125 bp)
specific c. hominis detected. using method, detected c. hominis
infection 1 21 patients diarrhea, suggesting method could
facilitate detection c. hominis infections.
