burkitt's lymphoma (bl) common childhood cancer equatorial africa,
and endemic areas people chronically co-infected with
epstein-barr virus (ebv) malaria pathogen plasmodium falciparum. the
contribution pathogens oncogenic process remains poorly
understood. showed earlier activation toll-like receptor (tlr) 9
by hemozoin, disposal product formed digestion blood p.
falciparum, suppresses lytic reactivation ebv bl cells. ebv lytic
reactivation regulated expression transcription factor zta (zebra), 
encoded ebv gene bzlf1. here, explore bl cell line akata, the
mechanism involved repression tlr9 expression bzlf1. show that
bzlf1 repression mediated upon tlr9 engagement mechanism largely 
independent de novo protein synthesis. crispr/cas9-induced inactivation 
tlr9, myd88, irak4 irak1 confirm bzlf1 repression dependent on
functional tlr9 myd88 signaling, identify irak4 essential element
for tlr9-induced repression bzlf1 expression upon bcr cross-linking. our
results unprecedentedly show tlr9-mediated inhibition lytic ebv is
largely independent new protein synthesis demonstrate central roles of
myd88 irak4 process contributing ebv's persistence host's
b-cell pool.
