the peptidyl nucleoside arginomycin active gram-positive bacteria 
fungi displays much lower toxicity mice analog blasticidin s. 
features rare amino acid, β-methylarginine, attached the
deoxyhexose moiety via 4'-aminoacyl bond. report cloning the
complete biosynthetic gene cluster arginomycin streptomyces arginensis
nrrl 15941. among 14 putative essential open reading frames, argm, encoding
an aspartate aminotransferase (aat), adjacent argn, encoding s-adenosyl
methionine (sam)-dependent methyltransferase, coupled catalyze arginine
and yield β-methylarginine escherichia coli. purified argm transfer the
α-amino group l-arginine α-ketoglutaric acid give glutamate thereby 
converts l-arginine 5-guanidino-2-oxopentanoic acid, methylated at
the c-3 position argn form 5-guanidino-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid.
iteratively, argm specifically catalyzes transamination donor
l-aspartate resulting 5-guanidino-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid, generating
β-methylarginine. complete concise biosynthetic pathway rare 
bioactive amino acid revealed study may pave way production
of β-methylarginine either enzymatic conversion engineered living cells.
