pathogens balance transmission persistence. plasmodium
falciparum, widespread virulent malaria parasite, persistence within
its human host requires continuous asexual replication within red blood cells,
while mosquito-borne transmission depends intra-erythrocytic
differentiation non-replicating sexual stages called gametocytes. commitment
to either fate determined preceding cell cycle begins with
invasion single, asexually committed merozoite ends, 48 hours later,
with schizont releasing newly formed merozoites, committed either
continued asexual replication differentiation gametocytes. sexual
commitment requires transcriptional activation ap2-g (pf3d7_1222600), 
master regulator sexual development, epigenetically silenced state
during asexual replication. ap2-g expression 'commitment cycle'
prepares gene expression nascent merozoites initiate sexual development
through hitherto unknown mechanism. maintain persistent infection, the
expression ap2-g limited sub-population parasites (1-30%, depending
on genetic background growth conditions). sexually committed schizonts
comprise sub-population morphologically indistinguishable from
their asexually committed counterparts, defining characteristic gene
expression difficult using traditional, bulk transcriptome profiling.
here use highly parallel, single-cell rna sequencing malaria cultures
