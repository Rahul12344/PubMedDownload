background: sterile insect technique transgenic equivalents are
considered promising tools controlling vector-borne disease age of
increasing insecticide drug-resistance. combining vector interventions with
artemisinin-based therapies may achieve twin goals suppressing malaria
endemicity managing artemisinin resistance. cost-effectiveness of
these controls investigated independently, combined usage 
been dynamically optimized response ecological epidemiological
processes.
results: optimal control framework based coupled models mosquito
population dynamics malaria epidemiology used investigate the
cost-effectiveness combining vector control drug therapies homogeneous
environments without vector migration. costs endemic malaria 
weighed costs administering artemisinin therapies releasing
modified mosquitoes using various cost structures. larval density dependence is
shown reduce cost-effectiveness conventional sterile insect releases
compared transgenic mosquitoes late-acting lethal gene. using drug
treatments reduce critical vector control release ratio necessary to
cause disease fadeout.
conclusions: combining vector control drug therapies effective
and efficient use resources, using optimized implementation strategies can
substantially reduce costs.
