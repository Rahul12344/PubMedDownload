cambodia's first-line artemisinin combination therapy,
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (dha-ppq), longer sufficiently curative
against multidrug-resistant plasmodium falciparum malaria thai-cambodian 
border regions. report recent (2008 2013) drug resistance trends 753
isolates northern, western, southern cambodia surveying ex vivo
drug susceptibility molecular drug resistance markers guide selection 
of effective alternative dha-ppq. last 3 study years, ppq
susceptibility declined dramatically (geomean 50% inhibitory concentration [ic50]
increased 12.8 29.6 nm), mefloquine (mq) sensitivity doubled (67.1 
to 26 nm) northern cambodia. changes drug susceptibility were
significantly associated decreased prevalence p. falciparum multidrug
resistance 1 gene (pfmdr1) multiple copy isolates coincided timing
of replacing artesunate-mefloquine (as-mq) dha-ppq first-line
therapy. widespread chloroquine resistance suggested isolates of
the p. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter gene cviet haplotype. nearly
all isolates collected recent years p. falciparum kelch13
mutations, indicative artemisinin resistance. ex vivo bioassay measurements of
antimalarial activity plasma indicated 20% patients recently took
antimalarials, plasma activity (median 49.8 nm dha equivalents) 
suggestive substantial vivo drug pressure. overall, findings suggest
dha-ppq failures associated emerging ppq resistance background of
artemisinin resistance. observed connection drug policy changes and
significant reduction ppq susceptibility mitigation mq resistance
supports reintroduction as-mq, conjunction monitoring p.
