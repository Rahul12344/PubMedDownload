transcriptomic, proteomic genomic studies significantly improved our
understanding complexity blood feeding insect saliva providing
unparalleled evolutionary insights. salivary genes appeared strong
selective pressure gene duplication functional diversification a
powerful driver evolution novel salivary genes/functions. first
insect salivary proteins responsible complement inhibition identified
and widespread mechanism action shared unrelated salivary protein
families recognized named kratagonism. micrornas first time 
described saliva blood feeding arthropods raising intriguing
questions possible contribution vertebrate host manipulation and
pathogen transmission emphasizing much still learn 
blood feeding insect saliva.
