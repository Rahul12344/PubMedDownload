the apicomplexan babesia microti primary causative agent human
babesiosis, one broadly distributed tick-borne diseases worldwide. b.
microti undergoes complex lifecycle within mammalian host tick
vector, employs several different specific molecular mechanisms enter host
cells. enolase, key glycolytic enzyme intracellular glucose metabolism,
can also expressed parasite's outer surface, binds human
plasminogen, coordinates apicomplexan parasite invasion host cells,
however, lacks sorting sequences lipoprotein anchor sites. present
study, isolated coding gene b. microti enolase (bmeno), expressed it
within e. coli purified recombinant bmeno protein (rbmeno). consequently,
we confirmed cytoplasmic surface localization bmeno via
immunofluorescence, demonstrated rbmeno catalyzes dehydration of
2-phospho-d-glycerate phosphoenolpyruvate. moreover, results showed that
rbmeno binds human plasminogen, lysine analog Îµ-aminocaproic acid
significantly inhibited binding. furthermore plasminogen bound rbmeno
converts active plasmin. additionally, actively immunizing mice rbmeno
could evoke partial protective immunity b. microti infection following 
challenge. conclusion, b. microti enolase multifunctional cytoplasmic
protein also expressed parasitic outer surface, facilitates
binding host plasminogen, could partially protect hosts parasite
infection.
