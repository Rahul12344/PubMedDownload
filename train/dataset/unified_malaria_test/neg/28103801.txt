background: contaminations various exogenous sources common problem in
next-generation sequencing. another possible source contaminating dna are
endogenous parasites. one hand, undiscovered contaminations animal
sequence assemblies may lead erroneous interpretation data; other
hand, identified, parasite-derived sequences may provide valuable source
of information.
results: show sequences deriving apicomplexan parasites 
found many animal genome transcriptome projects, cases
derived infection sequenced host specimen. apicomplexan
sequences extracted sequence assemblies using newly developed
bioinformatic pipeline (contamfinder) tentatively assigned distinct taxa
employing phylogenetic methods. analysed 920 assemblies found 20,907
contigs apicomplexan origin 51 datasets. contaminating species
were identified members apicomplexan taxa gregarinasina, coccidia,
piroplasmida, haemosporida. example, platypus genome assembly, 
found high number contigs derived piroplasmid parasite (presumably
theileria ornithorhynchi). infecting parasite species, no
molecular data available previously, datasets contain
sequences representing large amounts parasite's gene repertoire.
conclusion: study suggests parasite-derived contaminations represent a
valuable source information help discover identify new
parasites, provide information previously unknown host-parasite
interactions. we, therefore, argue uncurated assembly data routinely 
be made available addition final assemblies.
