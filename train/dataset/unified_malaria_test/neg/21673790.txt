malaria vector-borne infectious disease caused unicellular, obligate
intracellular parasites genus plasmodium. host switch malaria
parasite employs specialized latent stages colonize new host
environment. previous work established gametocytes, sexually
differentiated stages taken mosquito vector, control
expression genes required mosquito colonization translational
repression. sexual parasite development controlled dead-box rna helicase 
of ddx6 family, termed dozi. latency sporozoites, transmission stage
injected infectious blood meal, controlled eif2alpha kinase
ik2, general inhibitor protein synthesis. whether rna-binding proteins
participate translational regulation sporozoites remains studied.
here, investigated roles two rna-binding proteins puf-family,
plasmodium puf1 puf2, sporozoite stage conversion. data reveal
that, rodent malaria parasite p. berghei, puf2 participates the
regulation ik2 inhibits premature sporozoite transformation. inside
mosquito salivary glands puf2⁻ sporozoites transform time round forms
resembling early intra-hepatic stages. result, mutant parasites display
strong defects initiating malaria infection. contrast, puf1 is
dispensable vivo throughout entire plasmodium life cycle. findings
support notion central role puf2 parasite latency switch
between insect mammalian hosts.
