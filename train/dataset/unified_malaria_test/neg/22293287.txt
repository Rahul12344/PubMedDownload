background: protein kinase ck2 pleiotropic serine/threonine protein kinase
with hundreds reported substrates, plays important role number 
cellular processes. cellular functions plasmodium falciparum ck2 (pfck2)
are unknown. parasite's genome encodes one catalytic subunit, pfck2α, which
we previously shown essential completion asexual
erythrocytic cycle, two putative regulatory subunits, pfck2β1 pfck2β2.
results: show genes encoding regulatory pfck2 subunits
(pfck2β1 pfck2β2) cannot disrupted. using immunofluorescence electron 
microscopy, examined intra-erythrocytic stages transgenic parasite
lines expressing hemagglutinin (ha)-tagged catalytic regulatory subunits
(ha-ck2α, ha-pfck2β1 ha-pfck2β2), localized three subunits both
cytoplasmic nuclear compartments parasite. transgenic
parasite lines used purify pfck2β1- pfck2β2-containing complexes,
which analyzed mass spectrometry. recovered proteins unevenly
distributed various pathways, large proportion components of
the chromatin assembly pathway present pfck2β1 pfck2β2
precipitates, implicating pfck2 chromatin dynamics. also found that
chromatin-related substrates nucleosome assembly proteins (naps),
histones, two members alba family phosphorylated pfck2α in
vitro.
conclusions: reverse-genetics data show two regulatory pfck2
subunits required completion asexual erythrocytic cycle. our
interactome study points implication pfck2 many cellular pathways,
with chromatin dynamics identified major process regulated pfck2.
this study paves way kinome-wide interactomics-based approach to
elucidate protein kinase function malaria parasites.
