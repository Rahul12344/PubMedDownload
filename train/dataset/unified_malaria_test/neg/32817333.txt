cd4+ cell functional inhibition (exhaustion) hallmark malaria and
correlates impaired parasite control infection chronicity. however, 
mechanisms cd4+ cell exhaustion still poorly understood. study, 
we show ag-experienced (ag-exp) cd4+ cell exhaustion plasmodium
yoelii nonlethal infection occurs alongside reduction mammalian target 
rapamycin (mtor) activity restriction cd4+ cell glycolytic capacity. 
demonstrate loss glycolytic metabolism mtor activity within the
exhausted ag-expcd4+ cell population infection coincides reduction 
in t-bet expression. t-bet found directly bind control the
transcription various mtor metabolism-related genes within effector cd4+ t
cells. consistent this, ag-expth1 cells exhibited significantly higher and
sustained mtor activity effector t-bet- (non-th1) ag-expt cells throughout
the course malaria. identified mtor redundant sustaining t-bet
expression activated th1 cells, whereas mtor necessary sufficient 
for maintaining ifn-γ production th1 cells. immunotherapy targeting pd-1,
ctla-4, il-27 blocked cd4+ cell exhaustion malaria infection was
associated elevated t-bet expression concomitant increased cd4+ cell
glycolytic metabolism. collectively, data suggest mtor activity is
linked t-bet ag-expcd4+ cells reduction mtor activity may not
directly underpin ag-expth1 cell loss exhaustion malaria infection.
these data implications therapeutic reactivation exhausted cd4+ t
cells malaria infection chronic conditions.
