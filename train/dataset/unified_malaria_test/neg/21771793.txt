the plasmodium mitochondrial electron transport chain received considerable
attention potential target new antimalarial drugs. atovaquone, potent 
inhibitor plasmodium cytochrome bc(1), combination proguanil is
recommended chemoprophylaxis treatment malaria. type ii
nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ndh2) considered attractive drug target, as
its inhibition thought lead arrest mitochondrial electron
transport chain and, consequence, pyrimidine biosynthesis, essential
pathway parasite. using rodent malaria parasite plasmodium berghei as
an vivo infection model, studied role ndh2 plasmodium life
cycle progression. ndh2 deleted targeted gene disruption and, thus, 
dispensable pathogenic asexual blood stages, disproving candidacy for
an anti-malarial drug target. transmission insect vector,
ndh2-deficient ookinetes display intact mitochondrial membrane potential.
however, ndh2(-) parasites fail develop mature oocysts mosquito
midgut. propose plasmodium blood stage parasites rely glycolysis as
the main atp generating process, whereas invertebrate vector, a
glucose-deprived environment, malaria parasite dependent intact
mitochondrial respiratory chain.
