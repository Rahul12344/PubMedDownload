background: bangladesh malaria hypo-endemic country sharing borders with
india myanmar. artemisinin combination therapy (act) remains successful in
bangladesh. increase artemisinin-resistant malaria parasites the
thai-cambodia thai-myanmar borders worrisome. k13 propeller gene
(pf3d7_1343700 pf13_0238) mutations linked vitro
artemisinin resistance vivo slow parasite clearance rates. group
undertook evaluate mutations seen cambodia emerged bangladesh
where act use standard decade.
methods: samples obtained plasmodium falciparum-infected malaria
patients upazila health complexes (uhc) 2009 2013 seven
endemic districts bangladesh. districts included khagrachari (matiranga 
uhc), rangamati (rajasthali uhc), cox's bazar (ramu ukhia uhc), bandarban
(lama uhc), mymensingh (haluaghat uhc), netrokona (durgapur kalmakanda uhc), 
and moulvibazar (sreemangal kamalganj uhc).
results: 296 microscopically positive p. falciparum samples, 271 (91.6%)
were confirmed mono-infections real-time pcr nested pcr. k13
propeller gene 253 (93.4%) samples sequenced bi-directionally. one
non-synonymous mutation (a578s) found bangladeshi clinical isolates. the
a578s mutation confirmed lies adjacent c580y mutation, major
mutation causing delayed parasite clearance cambodia. based computational
modeling a578s significant effect tertiary structure the
protein.
conclusion: data suggest p. falciparum bangladesh remains free the
c580y mutation linked delayed parasite clearance. however, mutation a578s 
is present based structural analysis could affect k13 gene function.
further vivo clinical studies required validate effect this
mutation.
