purpose: antimalarial drug resistance one major challenges global
efforts to control eliminate malaria. 2006, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp)
replaced artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) bioko island,
equatorial guinea, response increasing sp resistance, associated
with mutations dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) dihydropteroate
synthase (pfdhps) genes.
patients methods: evaluate trend molecular markers associated 
sp resistance bioko island 2011 2017, 179 samples collected during
active case detection analysed pcr dna sequencing.
results: pfdhfr pfdhps gene sequences obtained 90.5% (162/179) and
77.1% (138/179) samples, respectively. pfdhfr, 97.5% (158/162), 95.7% 
(155/162) 98.1% (159/162) samples contained n51i, c59r s108n
mutant alleles, respectively. pfdhps s436a, a437g, k540e, a581g, a613s
mutations observed 25.4% (35/138), 88.4% (122/138), 5.1% (7/138), 1.4%
(2/138), 7.2% (10/138) samples, respectively. two classes of
previously described pfdhfr-pfdhps haplotypes associated sp resistance and
their frequencies identified: partial (irni-sgkaa, 59.4%) full
(irni-sgeaa, 5.5%) resistance. although significant difference observed in
different time periods (p>0.05), study confirmed slowly increasing trend of
the frequencies sp-resistance markers bioko parasites 7
years investigated.
conclusion: findings reveal general existence sp-resistance markers on
bioko island even replacement sp first-line treatment for
uncomplicated malaria. continuous molecular monitoring additional control
efforts region urgently needed.
