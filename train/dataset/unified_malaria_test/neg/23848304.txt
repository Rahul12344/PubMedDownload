mosquitoes anopheles maculipennis meigen (diptera: culicidae) group of
public health concern: five 11 morphologically indistinct species have
been historically considered vectors malaria europe. three members of
the an. maculipennis group reported u.k.: anopheles atroparvus
van thiel; anopheles messeae falleroni, anopheles daciae linton, nicolescu & 
harbach. study distribution three u.k. species, particularly that
of an. daciae, developed polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment
length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) assay using nuclear ribosomal internal
transcribed spacer 2 (its-2) gene. anopheles daciae found widespread,
occurring four five counties surveyed southern england the
welsh island anglesey, often sympatry closely related species
an. messeae. host preferences 237 blood-fed females determined using 
either direct sequencing pcr-based fragment analysis mitochondrial
cytochrome oxidase b gene dna females' abdomens. three species were
found opportunistic, fed least three different hosts.
seventeen individuals contained multiple bloodmeals, including two an. daciae
that fed humans birds. results show an. daciae widespread 
in england wales, occurs sympatry members the
an. maculipennis group, feeds humans, suggests potential
vector disease u.k.
