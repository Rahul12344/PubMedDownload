falcipain-2, major cysteine hemoglobinase human malaria parasite
plasmodium falciparum, critical parasite development considered a
promising chemotherapeutic target. order facilitate high-throughput
screening falcipain-2 inhibitors natural sources, developed an
economic highly-productive overexpression system escherichia coli using 
codon-optimized profalcipain-2 construct. high expression levels (35-55% 
total host proteins) observed profalcaipain-2 expression induced
with 1mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (iptg) several e. coli
strains, highest level observed bl21(de3). lower expression (~40% 
of total host proteins) observed bl21(de3) grown zym-5052
auto-induction medium, containing 0.2% lactose inducer. however, culture
grew notably higher cellular density, increasing ~1.5 times overall yield 
of system compared conventional iptg-induction. although several
conditions modified achieve expression soluble active
falcipain-2, enzyme mainly obtained form insoluble aggregates. 
after purification refolding, ~50 mg active enzyme obtained per liter
of culture low cost using regular incubator shaker, recombinant
falcipain-2 exhibited structural functional characteristics similar to
the natural counterpart. due versatility simplicity, strategy can
be straightforwardly adapted proteins plasmodium species any
other organism at-rich genome.
