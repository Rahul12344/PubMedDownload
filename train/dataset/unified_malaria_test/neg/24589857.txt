macroautophagy initially considered nonselective process bulk
breakdown cytosolic material. however, recent evidence points toward a
selective mode autophagy mediated so-called selective autophagy
receptors (sars). sars act recognizing sorting diverse cargo substrates
(e.g., proteins, organelles, pathogens) autophagic machinery. known sars
are characterized short linear sequence motif (lir-, lrs-, aim-motif)
responsible interaction sars proteins atg8 family.
interestingly, many lir-containing proteins (lircps) also involved in
autophagosome formation maturation regulating signaling 
pathways. despite recent research efforts experimentally identify lircps, only
a dozen class of-often unrelated-proteins characterized 
far using tedious cell biological, biochemical, crystallographic approaches. 
the availability ever-increasing number complete eukaryotic genomes
provides grand challenge characterizing novel lircps throughout the
eukaryotes. along lines, developed ilir, freely available web
resource, provides silico tools assisting identification of
novel lircps. given amino acid sequence input, ilir searches instances 
of short sequences compliant refined sensitive regular expression pattern 
of extended lir motif (xlir-motif) retrieves characterized protein
domains smart database query. additionally, ilir scores xlirs
against custom position-specific scoring matrix (pssm) identifies
potentially disordered subsequences protein interaction potential
overlapping detected xlir-motifs. demonstrate proteins
satisfying criteria make good lircp candidates experimental
verification. domain architecture displayed informative graphic, and
detailed results also available tabular form. anticipate ilir will
assist elucidating full complement lircps eukaryotes.
