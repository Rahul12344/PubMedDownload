plasmodium vivax usually considered morbidity endemic areas asia,
central south america, part africa. thailand, previous studies
indicated genetic diversity p. vivax malaria-endemic regions as
the western part thailand bordering myanmar. objective study
is investigate genetic diversity p. vivax circulating southern
thailand using 3 antigenic markers 8 microsatellite markers. dried blood
spots collected chumphon, phang nga, ranong and, surat thani provinces 
of thailand. pcr, 3 distinct sizes pvmsp3α, 2 sizes pvmsp3β 2 sizes 
of pvmsp1 f2 detected based length pcr products, respectively.
pcr/rflp analyses antigen genes revealed high levels genetic
diversity. genotyping 8 microsatellite loci showed high genetic diversity 
as indicated high alleles per locus high expected heterozygosity (he). the
genotyping markers also showed multiple-clones infection. mixed genotypes were
detected 4.8% pvmsp3α, 29.1% pvmsp3β 55.3% microsatellite
markers. results showed high genetic diversity p. vivax
isolated southern thailand, indicating genetic diversity p.
vivax region comparable observed areas thailand.
