plasmodium (p.) vivax prevalent malarial species accounting 70% of
malaria cases pakistan. however, baseline epidemiological data p. vivax
population structure drug resistance lacking pakistan. for
population structure studies, molecular genetic markers, circumsporozoite protein
(csp) merozoite surface protein-1 (msp-1) considered useful play
an important role p. vivax survival immune environmental pressure.
furthermore, genes also identified suitable candidates for
vaccine development. efforts effective vaccine underway,
anti-malarial agents remain mainstay control. evidence resistance
against commonly used anti-malarial agents, particularly
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) threatening make form control
defunct. therefore, studies drug resistance necessary that
anti-malarial treatment strategies structured implemented accordingly 
by malaria control program, pakistan. review aims provide information
on genetic markers p. vivax population structure drug resistance and
comment usefulness molecular surveillance control.
