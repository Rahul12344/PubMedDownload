egress crucial phase toxoplasma gondii intracellular lytic cycle.
this process drives inflammation strongly associated the
pathogenesis observed toxoplasmosis. despite link process
and virulence, little known egress mechanistic descriptive
level. previously published work suggested phospholipase,
lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (lcat), secreted parasite's dense
granules contributes parasite growth, virulence, egress. present
evidence several independent mutant parasite lines confirming role for
lcat efficient egress, although defects growth virulence were
apparent. also show via genetic complementation catalytic activity of
lcat required role parasite egress. work solidifies the
contribution lcat egress t.Â gondii tachyzoites. importancetoxoplasma
gondii one successful human pathogens, infecting estimated 2.5 
billion people across globe. pathogenesis seen acute reactivated
toxoplasmosis closely tied parasite's intracellular lytic life
cycle, culminates event called egress results release 
freshly replicated parasites infected host cell. despite highly
destructive, cytolytic nature event downstream consequences, very
little known parasite accomplishes step. previous work 
suggested role secreted phospholipase, lcat, toxoplasma egress and
roles cell traversal egress plasmodium species orthologue. we
confirm lcat-deficient tachyzoites unable efficiently egress
from infected monolayers, provide evidence lcat catalytic activity is
required role egress.
