hard ticks feed several days weeks hosts. blood feeding is
assisted tick saliva, injected host skin regularly,
alternating blood ingestion. tick saliva contains hundreds thousands of
different peptides bioactive compounds assist feeding by
inhibiting hosts' blood clotting, platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction,
as well pain itching. immunomodulatory antimicrobial peptides also
found tick saliva. molecular characterization tick salivary compounds, or
its sialome (from greek sialos = saliva), helps identification possible
antigens might confer anti-tick immunity, well identifying novel
pharmacologically active compounds. amblyomma americanum major nuisance tick
in eastern southern us, vector theileria ehrlichia bacteria to
animals humans. presently report rnaseq study concerning salivary
glands adult female a. americanum ticks, involved sequencing four
libraries collected different times feeding. total 5,792 coding
sequences deduced transcriptome assembly, 3,139 were
publicly deposited, expanding previously available 146 salivary
sequences found genbank. remarkable time-dependent transcript expression was
found, mostly related secretory products, supporting idea ticks may
have several "sialomes" expressed different times feeding. the
molecular nature sialome switching remains unknown. hyperlinked
spreadsheet containing deduced coding sequences found at
