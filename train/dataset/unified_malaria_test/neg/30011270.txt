cell motility essential protozoan metazoan organisms typically
relies dynamic turnover actin filaments. metazoans, monomeric actin 
polymerises usually long stable filaments, protozoans form
only short highly dynamic actin filaments. different dynamics are
partly due different sets actin regulatory proteins partly due to
the sequence actin itself. probe interactions actin subunits
within divergent actin filaments using comparative dynamic molecular model 
explore functions using plasmodium, protozoan causing malaria, and
mouse melanoma derived b16-f1 cells model systems. parasite actin tagged 
fluorescent protein (fp) incorporate mammalian actin filaments, 
rabbit actin-fp incorporate parasite actin filaments. however,
exchanging divergent region actin subdomain 3 allowed reciprocal
incorporation. exchange single amino acid residue subdomain 2 (n41h) 
of plasmodium actin markedly improved incorporation mammalian filaments. 
the parasite, modification subunit-subunit interaction sites lethal, 
whereas changes actin subdomains 1 4 reduced efficient parasite motility
and hence mosquito organ penetration. strong penetration defects could be
rescued overexpression actin filament regulator coronin. 
comparative approaches identified essential common contributor,
subdomain 3, drives differential dynamic behaviour two highly
