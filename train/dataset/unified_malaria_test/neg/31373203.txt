emerging resistance current antimalarial medicines underscores importance 
of identifying new drug targets novel compounds. malaria parasites purine
auxotrophic import purines via plasmodium falciparum equilibrative
nucleoside transporter type 1 (pfent1). previously showed pfent1
inhibitors block parasite proliferation culture. goal identify
additional, possibly optimal chemical starting points drug discovery
campaign. performed high throughput screen (hts) glaxosmithkline's 1.8
million compound library yeast-based assay identify pfent1 inhibitors. 
we used parallel progression strategy hit validation expansion, an
emphasis chemical properties addition potency. one arm, most
active hits tested human cell toxicity; 201 minimal toxicity. the
second arm, hit expansion, used scaffold-based substructure search hts
hits templates identify 2000 compounds; 123 compounds activity. of
these 324 compounds, 175 compounds inhibited proliferation p. falciparum
parasite strain 3d7 ic50 values 0.8 ∼180 μm. one hundred
forty-two compounds inhibited pfent1 knockout (pfent1δ) parasite growth,
indicating also hit secondary targets. thirty-two hits inhibited growth of
3d7 pfent1δ parasites. thus, pfent1 inhibition sufficient block
parasite proliferation. therefore, pfent1 may viable target antimalarial
drug development. six compounds novel chemical scaffolds extensively
characterized yeast-, parasite-, human-erythrocyte-based assays. the
inhibitors showed similar potencies drug sensitive resistant p.
falciparum strains. represent attractive starting points development 
novel antimalarial drugs.
