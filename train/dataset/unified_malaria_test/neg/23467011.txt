plasmodium vivax apical membrane antigen-1 (pvama-1) major candidate antigen
for human malaria vaccine. present study, polymorphism pvama-1 among
iranian isolates investigated generate useful information vaccine 
candidate antigen, required rational design vaccine against
p. vivax. blood samples collected p. vivax-infected iranian patients
during 2009-2010. 99 collected isolates, 37 analyzed almost the
entire pvama-1 gene using sequencing. overall nucleotide diversity (π) was
0.00826 ± 0.0004 majority polymorphic sites identified domain 
i (di) pvama-1 gene. neutrality analysis using tajima's d, fu li's d* 
and f* mcdonald kreitman tests showed significant positive departure from
neutral substitution patterns, indicating possible balancing selection across
the entire ectodomain di sequences pvama-1 gene. however, evidence 
found balancing selection dii diii regions iranian pvama-1.
also, 29 haplotypes different frequencies identified overall
haplotype diversity 0.982 ± 0.012. epitope mapping prediction pvama-1
showed potential b-cell epitopes across di-diii overlap e145k, p210s,
r249h, g253e, k352e, r438h n445d mutations; however, mutation been
found intrinsically unstructured/disordered regions. fixation index (fst) 
estimation iran closest geographical sites india (0.0707)
showed slight geographical genetic differentiation; however, fst estimation
between iran thailand (0.1253) suggested moderate geographical isolation.
in summary, genetic investigation pvama-1 among iranian p. vivax isolates
indicates antigen showed limited antigenic diversity the
detected mutations located outside b-cell epitopes. therefore, present
results significant implications understanding nature p. vivax
population circulating iran well providing useful information for
malaria vaccine development based antigen.
