although validity coccidian species, eimeria mivati, been
questioned many researchers long time molecular
analysis would help resolve issue. report discovery of
the two types small ribosomal subunit (18s) gene within eimeria mitis
genome correspond known 18s sequences e. mitis e. mivati, 
this conflict existence e. mivati independent species. we
have carried five single oocyst isolations obtain five
single-oocyst-derived strains e. mitis analyzed the
sequencing 18s mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit genes. two
types 18s gene found present strain roughly equal
ratios. indicates strains carrying one 18s
type exist, likely cross-breed still represent single species.
however, probable explanation strains e. mitis contain
two types 18s gene occasional detection one 
type sequencing might caused insufficient sampling. also the
first report two types 18s gene eimeria, already been
described apicomplexan species, notably plasmodium. also
found two types ribosomal rna differ significantly their
secondary structure. biological significance two 18s gene variants 
e. mitis known, however, hypothesize variants might used 
in different stages parasite's life-cycle apicomplexan
species investigated far.
