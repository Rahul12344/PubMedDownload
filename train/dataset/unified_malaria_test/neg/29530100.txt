background: plasmodium falciparum delayed clearance use of
artemisinin-based combination therapy (acts) reported african
countries. single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) two genes, p. falciparum
adaptor protein complex 2 mu subunit (pfap2mu) ubiquitin specific protease 1 
(pfubp1), linked delayed clearance act use kenya and
recurrent imported malaria britain. 12 years act use ghana,
this study investigated prevalence snps pfap2mu pfubp1 in
ghanaian clinical p. falciparum isolates provide baseline data for
antimalarial drug resistance surveillance country.
methods: filter paper blood blots collected 2015-2016 children aged below
9 years presenting uncomplicated malaria hospitals three sentinel
sites begoro, cape coast navrongo used. parasite dna extracted 
120 samples followed nested polymerase chain reaction (npcr). sanger
sequencing performed detect identify snps pfap2mu pfubp1 genes.
results: all, 11.1% (9/81) isolates carried wildtype genotypes 
both genes. total 164 pfap2mu mutations detected 67 isolates whilst 
271 pfubp1 mutations observed 72 isolates. majority mutations 
were non-synonymous (ns): 78% (128/164) pfap2mu 92.3% (250/271) for
pfubp1. five unique samples total 215 pfap2mu snps, ranging 15
and 63 snps per sample. genotypes reportedly associated art resistance
detected study included pfap2mu s160n (7.4%, 6/81) pfubp1 e1528d
(7.4%, 6/81) well d1525e (4.9%, 4/81). significant difference 
in prevalence snps three ecologically distinct study sites
(pfap2mu: χ2 = 6.905, df = 2, p = 0.546; pfubp1: χ2 = 4.883, df = 2, p = 0.769).
conclusions: detection pfap2mu pfubp1 genotypes associated act
delayed parasite clearance evidence gradual nascent emergence resistance
in ghana. results serve baseline data surveillance the
selection genotypes drug pressure time. pfap2mu s160n,
pfubp1 e1528d d1525e must monitored ghanaian isolates act
susceptibility studies, especially cure rates acts, particularly al, is
less 100%.
