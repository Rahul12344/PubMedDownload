monitoring plasmodium falciparum sensitivity antimalarial drugs africa
is vital malaria elimination. however, commonly used ex-vivo/in-vitro
ic50 test inconsistent several antimalarials, alternative
ring-stage survival assay (rsa) artemisinin derivatives widely
adopted. applied alternative two-colour flow-cytometry based parasite 
survival rate assay (psra) detect ex-vivo antimalarial tolerance p.
falciparum isolates gambia.psra infers parasite viability from
quantifying re-invasion uninfected cells following 3 consecutive days drug 
exposure (10-fold ic50 drug concentration field isolates). drug
survival rate isolate obtained slope growth/death
curve. obtained psra 41 isolates dha lum, 51 infections
tested rsa dha. also determined genotypes known drug
resistance genetic loci pfdhfr, pfdhps, pfmdr, pfcrt pfk13 genes.the psra 
for 41 gambian isolates showed faster killing lower variance dha compared 
to lum, despite strong correlation drugs. four three isolates 
were respectively tolerant dha lum, continuous growth drug
exposure. isolates pfmdr1-y184f mutant variant increased lum
survival though statistically significant.
sulphodoxine/pyrimethamine (sp) resistance markers fixed, other
antimalarial variants prevalent 50% population.the psra 
detected ex-vivo antimalarial tolerance gambian p. falciparum. calls 
its wider application increased vigilance resistance acts 
population.
