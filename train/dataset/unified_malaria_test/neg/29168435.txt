aminoacyl-trna synthetases (aarss) catalyze aminoacylation trnas to
produce aminoacyl-trnas (aa-trnas) required ribosomes translation of
the genetic message proteins. ensure accuracy trna aminoacylation,
and consequently fidelity protein synthesis, aarss exhibit a
proofreading (editing) site, distinct aa-trna synthetic site. aars
editing site hydrolyzes misacylated products formed non-cognate amino acid
is used trna charging. aarss play central role protein
biosynthesis cellular life, proteins represent longstanding targets for
therapeutic drug development combat infectious diseases. existing aars
inhibitors target synthetic site, recently drugs
targeting proofreading site considered. present study, we
developed robust assay high-throughput screening libraries of
inhibitors targeting synthetic proofreading sites four 
aarss simultaneously. thus, assay allows screening eight distinct
enzyme active sites single experiment. aarss several prominent human
pathogens (i.e., mycobacterium tuberculosis, plasmodium falciparum, and
escherichia coli) used development assay.
