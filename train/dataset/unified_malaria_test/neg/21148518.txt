background: factors involved development resistance to
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) plasmodium falciparum, particularly the
context intermittent preventive treatment pregnancy (iptp), not
well known. aimed determine impact iptp human immunodeficiency
virus (hiv) infection molecular markers sp resistance clinical
relevance resistant infections.
methods: sp resistance alleles determined peripheral (n = 125) and
placental (n = 145) p. falciparum isolates obtained pregnant women enrolled 
in randomized, placebo-controlled trial iptp manhiça, mozambique.
results: prevalence quintuple mutant infections 12% (23 185 isolates)
in pregnant women received placebo 24% (20 85 isolates) who
received sp (p = .031). last iptp dose administered late
pregnancy, mutant infections delivery prevalent placental samples
(7 [23%] 30, samples) peripheral blood samples (2 [7%] 30 samples; 
p = .025), prevalent women received iptp-sp who
received placebo (odds ratio [or], 8.13; 95% confidence interval [ci],
1.69-39.08), prevalent hiv-positive women hiv-negative women 
(or, 5.17; 95% ci, 1.23-21.66). association found mutant
infections increased parasite density malaria-related morbidity mothers
and children.
conclusions: iptp sp increases prevalence resistance markers the
placenta hiv-infected women delivery, suggests host immunity
is key clearance drug-resistant infections. however, effect of
iptp limited period blood levels sp likely be
significant translate more-severe infections adverse
clinical outcomes.
