malaria one three deadly diseases world. artemisinin the
first line effective drug treating malaria, extracted
from artemisia annua. therefore, great significance cultivate new
varieties a. annua high artemisinin content. based germplasm bank 
and whole genome, transcriptome genetic map, authors explore
high-quality genes, stress-resistant genes genetic markers been
used rapid breeding superior varieties a. annua. methods of
molecular breeding become main breeding direction a. annua the
future. breeding times new varieties a. annua shortened with
molecular breeding technology. based genetic background current
situation molecular breeding a. annua, strategy technical route 
molecular breeding discussed worked paper, provided 
guidance scientific reference molecular breeding a. annua the
future.
