background: blackwater fever (bwf), one severe life-threatening
forms falciparum malaria, characterized acute massive intravascular
haemolysis, often leading acute renal failure. thus far, genetics the
underlying susceptibility develop bwf fully elucidated. deficiency in
the mbl protein, important component innate immune system, has
previously suggested susceptibility factor development of
severe malaria. study aimed evaluate association mbl2 gene
polymorphisms, known affect mbl protein level/activity, occurrence
of bwf among congolese children.
methods: case-control study. cases patients bwf, whereas
controls, matched gender age, uncomplicated malaria (um). dried blood
spot collected genotyping.
results: total 129 children screened, including 43 bwf 86 um. the
common allele bwf um a, frequency 76.7 61.0%,
respectively (or: 2.67 (0.87-829) p = 0.079). frequency c allele
was 18.6 29.1% bwf um groups, respectively, p = 0.858. a
single allele encountered. genotype aa higher risk bwf whereas
genotypes a0 (ab ac) over-represented um group (or: 0.21 (0.06-0.78))
with p = 0.019. nine haplotypes observed study: 3 high mbl
expression haplotypes 6 low mbl expression haplotype. one new haplotype hypc 
was observed study. none haplotypes significantly associated
with bwf.
conclusion: pilot study preliminary research mbl2 gene and
infectious diseases drc. study results show higher risk bwf aa.
this suggests future studies bwf investigate the
contribution strong immune response occurrence bwf.
