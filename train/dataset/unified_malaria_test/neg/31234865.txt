background: reduce onward falciparum malaria transmission, world health
organization recommends adding single low-dose (sld) primaquine to
artemisinin-based combination treatment low transmission areas. however,
uptake recommendation relatively slow given concerns about
whether individual risks justify potential community benefit. study was
undertaken generate comprehensive local data risk-benefit profile of
sld primaquine deployment pre-elimination area south africa.
methods: randomized, controlled open-label trial investigated adding a
single low primaquine dose day 3 standard artemether-lumefantrine treatment
for uncomplicated falciparum malaria. efficacy, safety tolerability of
artemether-lumefantrine primaquine treatment assessed days 3, 7, 14, 
28 42. lumefantrine concentrations assayed dried blood spot samples
collected day 7.
results: 217 patients screened, 166 enrolled 140 randomized day
3, 70 study arm (primaquine primaquine). gametocytes were
detected either microscopy pcr follow-up samples collected
after randomization on day 3, precluding assessment primaquine efficacy.
prevalence cyp2d6*4, cyp2d6*10 cyp2d6*17 mutant alleles low with
allelic frequencies 0.02, 0.11 0.16, respectively; none the
cyp2d6*4/*4 variant associated null activity. among 172 rdt-positive
patients g6pd-genotyped, 24 (14%) carried g6pd deficient (a-) variant. median
haemoglobin concentrations similar treatment arms throughout
follow-up. third participants haemoglobin drop > 2 g/dl; 
associated primaquine treatment may associated g6pd genotype
[52.9% (9/17) a- genotype vs. 31% (36/116) genotypes
(p = 0.075)]. day 7 lumefantrine concentrations number nature of
adverse events similar study arms; one serious adverse event
occurred (renal impairment primaquine arm). artemether-lumefantrine
pcr-corrected adequate clinical parasitological response rate 100%, 
only one re-infection found among 128 patients who completed 42-day
follow-up.
conclusions: safety, tolerability, cyp2d6 g6pd variant data study
support deployment who-recommended sld primaquine without g6pd testing
to advance malaria elimination south african districts low-intensity
