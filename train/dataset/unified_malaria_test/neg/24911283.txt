mutations plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance (pfmdr1) gene are
known provide compensatory fitness benefits chloroquine (cq)-resistant 
malaria parasites often associated specific mutations p.
falciparum cq resistant transporter (pfcrt) gene. prevalence specific
mutations two genes across different malaria endemic regions mostly 
studies. however, reports mutations pfmdr1 gene genetic
associations mutations pfcrt gene indian p. falciparum field
isolates scarce. sequenced 560 bp region pfmdr1 coding sequence 
in 64 p. falciparum isolates collected different malaria endemic populations
in india. twenty 64 isolates laboratory cultured known 
vitro cq sensitiveness (10 sensitive 10 resistant). three low frequency
mutations (two non-synonymous one synonymous) pfmdr1 gene were
segregating indian isolates addition predominant y₈₆ y₁₈₄ ones, 
with high haplotype nucleotide diversity field isolates comparison 
to cultured ones. statistically significant genetic association between
the mutations pfmdr1 pfcrt gene could detected; almost observed
associations intragenic nature. results genetic diversity of
the pfmdr1 gene discussed term evolutionary perspectives indian p. 
falciparum, possible future potential gaining insights this
