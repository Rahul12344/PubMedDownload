background: artemisinin resistance major threat current efforts to
eliminate plasmodium falciparum malaria rely heavily continuing
efficacy artemisinin combination therapy (act). suggested act
should used mass drug administration (mda) areas where
artemisinin-resistant p. falciparum prevalent, atovaquone-proguanil
(a-p) might preferable alternative. however, single point mutation 
cytochrome b gene confers high level resistance atovaquone, mutant
parasites arise frequently treatment making a-p vulnerable tool for
elimination.
methods: deterministic, population level, mathematical model developed
based data cambodia explore possible effects large-scale use of
a-p compared dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine act mass drug administration
and/or treatment p. falciparum malaria, without adjunctive primaquine
(pq) long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (llin). aim local
elimination.
results: model showed initial efficacy act a-p mda be
similar. however, round a-p mda resulted rapid acquisition spread 
of atovaquone resistance. even single round mda could compromise efficacy
sufficient preclude use treatment prophylaxis. switch a-p 
treatment symptomatic episodes resulted complete loss efficacy 
population within four five years introduction. impact mda was
temporary combination maintained high coverage act treatment for
symptomatic individuals llin necessary elimination.
conclusion: malaria elimination, a-p mda treatment symptomatic
cases avoided. combined strategy high coverage act for
treatment symptomatic episodes, llin act + p mda would preferable.
