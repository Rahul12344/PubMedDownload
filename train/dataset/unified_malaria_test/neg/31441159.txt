the anti-malaria drug artesunate chemical analogs artemisinin have
demonstrated cytostatic cytotoxic effects bacterial cancer cells.
artemisinin-derived compounds also demonstrated attenuate fibrosis
in preclinical animal models, mechanisms inhibition occurs 
are well-understood. investigated effects artesunate the
emergence myofibroblast, causally implicated pro-fibrotic
pathologies. crl-2097 human dermal fibroblasts analyzed protein and
transcript expression treatment artesunate analyze fibroblast
activation. proliferation apoptosis also evaluated following treatment
with artesunate cell line. treatment human dermal fibroblasts with
artesunate antagonized fibroblast activation pro-fibrotic extracellular
matrix (ecm) deposition, basal culture conditions cultured in
the presence exogenous transforming growth factor-β1 (tgf-β1), major
pro-fibrotic cytokine. artesunate-treated fibroblasts also demonstrated decreased
proliferation increased apoptosis. transcript analysis quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction demonstrated artesunate downregulated
expression pro-fibrotic genes including canonical myofibroblast markers, ecm
genes, several tgf-β receptors ligands, upregulated expression of
cell cycle inhibitors matrix-metalloproteinases. together, data
demonstrate artesunate antagonizes fibroblast activation decreases
expression pro-fibrotic genes, also promoting myofibroblast apoptosis,
suggesting mechanisms may responsible part anti-fibrotic
effects artesunate described previously.
