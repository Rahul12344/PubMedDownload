background: plasmodium falciparum infection, microrna expression alters in
brain tissue mice cerebral malaria compared noninfected controls.
microrna regulates gene expression post-transcriptionally influence biological
processes. cerebral malaria pathology caused mainly immunological
disorder. hypothesize single-nucleotide polymorphism microrna
influences microrna biogenesis target gene recognition altering
susceptibility cerebral malaria.
methods: performed literature search based immunological mechanism and
applied microrna-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms database examine
candidate microrna snps possibly responsible cerebral malaria. microrna-27a
and microrna-146a supposed involve cerebral malaria pathology. to
assess relationship microrna snp cerebral malaria outcome, performed
taqman genotyping assays 110 cerebral malaria 207 uncomplicated malaria
cases three candidate microrna snps (rs895819 microrna-27a, rs57095329 and
rs2910164 microrna-146a).
results: study detected significant difference genotype allele
frequency individual microrna snps well haplotypes microrna-146a
between two groups malaria patients thailand. hardy-weinberg
disequilibrium rs57095329 cerebral malaria group showed heterozygous 
excess might due natural selection.
conclusion: data supported candidate microrna snps major
role develop cerebral malaria.
