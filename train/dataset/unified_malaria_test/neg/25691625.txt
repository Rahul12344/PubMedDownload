the emergence drug-resistant parasites serious threat faced malaria
control programs. understanding genetic basis resistance critical to
the success treatment intervention strategies. novel locus associated
with antimalarial resistance, ap2-mu (encoding mu chain adaptor
protein 2 [ap2] complex), recently identified studies rodent
malaria parasite plasmodium chabaudi (pcap2-mu). furthermore, analysis kenyan 
malaria patients polymorphisms plasmodium falciparum ap2-mu homologue, 
pfap2-mu, found evidence differences amino acid encoded codon 160 
are associated enhanced parasite survival vivo following combination
treatments included artemisinin derivatives. here, characterize role
of pfap2-mu mediating vitro antimalarial drug response p. falciparum
by generating transgenic parasites constitutively expressing codon 160 encoding
either wild-type ser (ser160) asn mutant (160asn) form pfap2-mu.
transgenic parasites carrying pfap2-mu 160asn allele significantly less 
sensitive dihydroartemisinin using standard 48-h vitro test, providing
direct evidence altered parasite response artemisinin. data also
provide evidence pfap2-mu variants modulate parasite sensitivity to
quinine. evidence found pfap2-mu variants contribute the
slow-clearance phenotype exhibited p. falciparum cambodian patients treated
with artesunate monotherapy. findings provide compelling evidence that
pfap2-mu modulate p. falciparum responses multiple drugs. propose 
this gene evaluated potential molecular marker of
antimalarial resistance.
