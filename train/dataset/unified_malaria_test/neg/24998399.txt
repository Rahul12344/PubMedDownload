mosquitoes possess innate immune system capable limiting infection 
by variety pathogens, including plasmodium spp. parasites responsible
for human malaria. anopheles immune deficiency (imd) innate immune signaling 
pathway confers resistance plasmodium falciparum. previously
identified anopheles anti-plasmodium effectors regulated signaling by
rel2, transcription factor imd pathway, many components this
defense system remain uncharacterized. begin better understand the
regulation immune effector proteins imd pathway, used
oligonucleotide microarrays itraq analyze differences mrna protein 
expression, respectively, transgenic anopheles stephensi mosquitoes
exhibiting blood meal-inducible overexpression active recombinant rel2 
their wild-type conspecifics. numerous genes differentially regulated at
both mrna protein levels following induction rel2. multiple
immune genes up-regulated, majority differentially expressed genes 
have known immune function mosquitoes. selected up-regulated genes from
multiple functional categories tested anti-plasmodium and
anti-bacterial action using rna interference (rnai). based experimental
findings, conclude increased expression imd immune
pathway-controlled transcription factor rel2 affects expression numerous
genes diverse functions, suggesting broader physiological impact immune
activation possible functional versatility rel2. study also
identified multiple novel genes implicated anti-plasmodium defense.
