ruvb protein belongs aaa+ family enzymes involved diverse cellular
activities. addition annotated two ruvb proteins plasmodium
falciparum database, report third ruvb protein also present. the
amino acid sequence analysis revealed p. falciparum ruvb3 (pfruvb3)
possesses walker motif a, walker motif b, sensor sensor ii conserved motifs
similar yeast human ruvb like proteins. phylogenetic analysis revealed
that pfruvb3 closely related yeast ruvb like proteins essential
for survival yeast. biochemical characterization recombinant
pfruvb3 confirms ssdna dependent atpase activity. using truncated
derivatives show walker motif essential enzymatic activity
of pfruvb3. using immunodepletion assays show atpase
activity attributable pfruvb3 protein. endogenous p. falciparum ruvb3
contains characteristic atpase dna helicase activities. confocal
microscopy analysis showed protein mainly expressed during
intraerythrocytic schizont stages parasite localized nuclear
region. merozoite comes schizont, pfruvb3 protein distinctly
relocalized subnuclear region. co-localization studies a
nucleolar marker pfnop1 suggest p. falciparum ruvb3 localizes
into discrete nuclear compartment. basis studies be
speculated p. falciparum ruvb3 likely required intraerythrocytic
schizogony.
