a thorough understanding malaria vector species composition bionomic
characteristics crucial devise effective efficient vector control
interventions reduce malaria transmission. well documented in
africa malaria interventions past decade resulted major
changes species composition endophilic anopheles gambiae exophilic an.
arabiensis. however, role cryptic rare mosquito species malaria
transmission well known. study examined species composition and
distribution, particular focus malaria transmission potential novel,
uncharacterized anopheles cryptic species western kenya. phylogenetic analysis
based its2 cox1 genes revealed 21 anopheles mosquito species, including
two previously unreported novel species. unusually high rates plasmodium
sporozoite infections detected an. funestus, an. gambiae eight
cryptic rare species. plasmodium falciparum, p. malariae p. ovale sporozoite 
infections identified large proportion mixed species infections in
these vectors. study, first time, reports extensive new anopheles
cryptic species involved malaria transmission western kenya. these
findings underscore importance non-common anopheles species malaria
transmission need target routine vector control and
surveillance efforts.
