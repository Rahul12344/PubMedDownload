background: aim study identify prevalence different
species plasmodium haplotypes pfcrt plasmodium falciparum the
selected area.
methods: overall, 10,372 blood films suspected malarial patients examined
microscopically rural health center sinawan, district muzaffargarh, pakistan
from november 2008 november 2010. p. falciparum positive samples (both whole
blood fta blood spotted cards) used dna extraction. nested pcr was
used amplify pfcrt (codon 72-76) gene fragment. sequencing carried out
to find haplotypes amplified fragment pfcrt gene.
result: slide positivity rate (spr), p. vivax p. falciparum
positivity rate 21.40 %, 19.37 % 2.03% respectively. fta blood spotted
cards equally efficient blood storage pcr sequencing.
analysis sequencing results pfcrt showed one type haplotype
sagtvmnt (agtgtaatgaataca) codon 72-76 samples.
conclusion: results show high prevalence cq resistance aq resistant
genes. aq recommended used partner drug act this
locality, ward future catastrophes.
