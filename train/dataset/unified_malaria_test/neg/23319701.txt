antibodies protect plasmodium falciparum (pf) infection clinical
malaria disease. however, absence constant reexposure, serum
immunoglobulin (ig) levels rapidly decline full protection clinical
symptoms lost, suggesting b cell memory functionally impaired. show
at single cell level natural pf infection induces development of
classical memory b cells (cm) atypical memory b cells (atm) produce
broadly neutralizing antibodies blood stage pf parasites. cm atm
contribute anti-pf serum igg production, atm show signs active
antibody secretion. atm cm also different igg gene repertoire, 
suggesting develop different precursors. findings provide
direct evidence natural pf infection leads development protective 
memory b cell antibody responses suggest constant immune activation
rather impaired memory function leads accumulation atm malaria.
understanding memory b cell response natural pf infection may key to
the development malaria vaccine induces long-lived protection.
