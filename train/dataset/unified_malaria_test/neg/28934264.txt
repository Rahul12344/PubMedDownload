malaria continues devastating disease, largely caused plasmodium
falciparum infection. investigated effects opioid cannabinoid
receptor antagonists growth intraerythrocytic p. falciparum. delta 
opioid receptor antagonist 7-benzylidenenaltrexone (bntx) cannabinoid
receptor antagonists rimonaband sr144528 caused growth arrest the
parasite. notably bntx established antimalarial drug dihydroartemisinin
induced prominent pyknosis parasite cells short period incubation. 
we compared genome-wide transcriptome profiles p. falciparum different
degrees pyknosis response drug treatment, identified 11 transcripts 
potentially associated evoking pyknosis, three, including
glutathione reductase (pfgr), triose phosphate transporter (pfotpt), a
conserved plasmodium membrane protein, showed markedly different gene expression 
levels accordance degree pyknosis. furthermore, use of
specific inhibitors confirmed pfgr pfotpt possible factor
contributing development pyknosis. reduction total glutathione
levels also detected association increased pyknosis. results
further understanding mechanisms responsible p. falciparum
development antimalarial activity dihydroartemisinin, provide
useful information development novel antimalarial agents.
