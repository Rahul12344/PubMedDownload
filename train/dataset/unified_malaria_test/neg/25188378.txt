cyclin-dependent kinase-like kinases (clks) dual specificity protein kinases 
that phosphorylate serine/arginine-rich (sr) proteins involved pre-mrna
processing. four clks, termed pfclk-1-4, identified human malaria
parasite plasmodium falciparum, show homology yeast sr protein
kinase sky1p. four pfclks present nucleus cytoplasm the
asexual blood stages gametocytes, sexual precursor cells crucial for
malaria parasite transmission humans mosquitoes. identified three
plasmodial sr proteins, pfsrsf12, pfsfrs4 pfsf-1, predominantly
present nucleus blood stage trophozoites, pfsrsf12 pfsf-1 are
further detectable nucleus gametocytes. found recombinantly
expressed sr proteins comprising arginine/serine (rs)-rich domains were
phosphorylated four pfclks vitro kinase assays, recombinant 
pfsf-1 peptide lacking rs-rich domain phosphorylated. since was
hitherto possible knock-out pfclk genes conventional gene
disruption, aimed chemical knock-outs phenotype analysis. identified
five human clk inhibitors, belonging oxo-β-carbolines and
aminopyrimidines, well antiseptic chlorhexidine pfclk-targeting
compounds. six inhibitors block p. falciparum blood stage replication 
low micromolar nanomolar range preventing trophozoite-to-schizont
transformation. addition, inhibitors impair gametocyte maturation and
gametogenesis vitro assays. combined data show four pfclks are
involved phosphorylation sr proteins essential functions blood
and sexual stages malaria parasite, thus pointing kinases as
promising targets antimalarial transmission blocking drugs.
