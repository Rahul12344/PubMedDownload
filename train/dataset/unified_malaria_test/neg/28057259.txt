safety tested modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) licensed as
third-generation vaccine smallpox serves potent vector system
for development new candidate vaccines infectious diseases cancer.
historically, mva developed serial tissue culture passage primary
chicken cells vaccinia virus strain ankara, clinically used avoid the
undesirable side effects conventional smallpox vaccination. adapted growth 
in avian cells mva lost ability replicate mammalian hosts lacks
many genes orthopoxviruses use conquer host (cell) environment.
as biologically well-characterized mutant virus, mva facilitates fundamental
research elucidate functions poxvirus host-interaction factors. as
extremely safe viral vectors mva vaccines found immunogenic and
protective various preclinical infection models. multiple recombinant mva
currently undergo clinical testing vaccination human immunodeficiency
viruses, mycobacterium tuberculosis plasmodium falciparum. versatility 
the mva vector vaccine platform readily demonstrated swift development 
of experimental vaccines immunization emerging infections the
middle east respiratory syndrome. recent advances include promising results 
the clinical testing recombinant mva-producing antigens highly pathogenic
avian influenza virus h5n1 ebola virus. review summarizes current
knowledge mva unique strain vaccinia virus, discusses the
prospects exploiting virus research tool poxvirus biology as
safe viral vector vaccine challenge existing future bottlenecks in
vaccinology.
