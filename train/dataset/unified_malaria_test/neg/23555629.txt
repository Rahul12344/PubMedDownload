the recent detection clinical artemisinin (art) resistance manifested as
delayed parasite clearance cambodia-thailand border area raises serious 
concern. mechanism art resistance clear; p. falciparum
sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ca(2+)-atpase (pfserca pfatp6) speculated
to target arts thus potential marker art resistance. 
amplified sequenced pfatp6 gene (~3.6 kb) 213 samples collected 2005
from greater mekong subregion, art drugs used extensively 
the past. total 24 single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), including 8 newly
found study 13 nonsynonymous, identified. however, these
mutations either uncommon also present geographical regions with
limited art use. none mutations suggestive directional selection
by arts. analyzed pfatp6 worldwide collection 862 p.
falciparum isolates 19 populations asia, africa, south america and
oceania, include samples regions prior deployments art
drugs. total 71 snps identified, resulting 106 nucleotide
haplotypes. similarly, many mutations continent-specific present 
at frequencies 5%. predominant perhaps ancestral haplotype
occurred 441 samples present 16 populations asia, africa, 
oceania. 3d7 haplotype found 54 samples second common
haplotype present nine populations four continents. assessment of
the selection strength pfatp6 19 parasite populations found pfatp6
in populations purifying selection average
d(n)/d(s) ratio 0.333. molecular evolution analyses detect significant
departures neutrality pfatp6 populations, challenging the
suitability gene marker monitoring art resistance.
