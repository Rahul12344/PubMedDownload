development effective vaccine critically needed prevention of
malaria. one key antigens malaria vaccines apical membrane
antigen 1 (ama-1) human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum, the
surface protein erythrocyte invasion parasite. gene encoding ama-1
has sequenced populations p. falciparum worldwide, haplotype
diversity gene p. falciparum populations greater mekong
subregion (gms), including thailand, remains characterized. present 
study, ama-1 gene pcr amplified sequenced genomic dna 65 
p. falciparum isolates 5 endemic areas thailand. nearly full-length
1,848 nucleotide sequence ama-1 subjected molecular analyses, including
nucleotide sequence diversity, haplotype diversity deduced amino acid
sequence diversity neutrality tests. phylogenetic analysis pairwise
population differentiation (fst indices) performed infer population
structure. analyses identified 60 single nucleotide polymorphic loci,
predominately located domain ama-1. total 31 unique ama-1 haplotypes
were identified, included 11 novel ones. phylogenetic tree ama-1
haplotypes revealed multiple clades ama-1, contained parasites
of multiple geographical origins, consistent fst indices indicating
genetic homogeneity gene flow among geographically distinct populations p. 
falciparum thailand's borders myanmar, laos cambodia. summary, the
study revealed novel haplotypes population structure needed further
advancement ama-1-based malaria vaccines gms.
