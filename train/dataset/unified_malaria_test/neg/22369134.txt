background: fourier transforms associated power spectra used for
detecting periodicities protein-coding genes generally regarded a
well established technique. many periodicities found 
this method quite well understood periodicity 3 nt is
associated codon usage. origin peculiar frequency
multiples k/21 reported tiny section chromosome 2 p.
falciparum? present chromosomes perhaps related
organisms? interpret fractional periodicities genomes?
results: applied binary indicator power spectrum chromosomes p. 
falciparum, found frequency overtones k/21 present in
non-coding sections. find frequency overtones other
related genomes. furthermore, frequency overtones identified as
artifacts way genome encoded numerical sequence, is,
they frequency aliases. choosing different way encode sequence
the overtones appear. view results, revisited early
applications technique proteins frequency overtones were
reported.
conclusions: authors hinted recently possibility mapping artifacts
and frequency aliases power spectra. however, case p. falciparum the
frequency aliases particularly strong mask 1/3 frequency is
used gene detecting. shows albeit well known technique,
with long history application proteins, researchers seem aware 
of problems represented frequency aliases.
