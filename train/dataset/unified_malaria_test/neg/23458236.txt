one main host genetic factors involved inflammation, immune responses
and pathogenesis malaria fcγriia (cd32) gene. single point mutation at
position 131 replace arginine (r) histidine (h) affect the
affinity receptor human igg subclasses. investigation was
designed explore polymorphisms fcγriia gene association both
anti-malarial total igg antibody igg subclass profiles c-terminal region
of plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 (pfmsp-1(19)). this
study, 166 infected patients p. falciparum living malaria
endemic area iran studied using pcr-rflp elisa methods. results
showed frequency fcγriia-r/r131, -r/h131 -h/h131 genotypes was
9.6%, 42.8% 47.6%, respectively. level total igg recombinant
pfmsp-1(19) antigen showed difference among fcγriia-r/r131,
-r/h131 -h/h131 groups. regards igg subclasses, anti-malarial
igg1 antibodies predominated. also, significant difference between
the frequency positive responders anti-pfmsp-1(19) igg igg1 antibodies
in p. falciparum-infected individuals fcγriia-r/r131, -r/h131 -h/h131
genotypes (p<0.05, x(2) test). regarding igg2-pfmsp-1(19) antibody, 27.27%
(fcγriia-r/r131), 25.71% (fcγriia-r/h131) 22.2% (fcγriia-h/h131) igg
responders showed positive antibody response. taken together, study the
first report exhibits high frequency fcγriia-h131h genotypes and
h131 allele baluchi ethnic group, similar fulani ethnic
group. present results provide additional data understand role of
fcγriia-131 genotypes pathogenesis malaria.
