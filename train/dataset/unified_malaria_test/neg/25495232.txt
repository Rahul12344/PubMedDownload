background: malaria mosquito anopheles gambiae high preference for
human hosts, characteristic contributes greatly capacity for
transmitting human malaria. sibling species, an. quadriannulatus, quite
different host preference feeds mostly bovids. reason not
contribute human malaria transmission. host seeking mosquitoes modulated
by olfactory system, primarily housed antennae maxillary 
palps. therefore, detection differing host odors sibling species may be
reflected expression level olfactory genes involved. accordingly,
we compared transcriptomes antennae maxillary palps an. gambiae
and an. quadriannulatus.
results: identified seven relatively abundant olfactory receptors, nine
ionotropic receptors three odorant binding proteins substantially
up-regulated an. gambiae antennae. interestingly, find maxillary
palps an. gambiae contain species-specific olfactory receptor, or52, and
five an. gambiae-specific gustatory receptors (aggr48-52) relatively
abundant. five gustatory receptors also expressed an. gambiae
antennae, although lower level, indicating likely role olfaction, rather 
than gustation. also document approximately three-fold higher overall
expression olfaction genes maxillary palps an. quadriannulatus,
indicating important role organ olfaction system this
species. finally, expression co2 receptor genes five six-fold
higher zoophilic an. quadriannulatus, implying much higher sensitivity
for detecting co2.
conclusions: results identify potential human host preference genes 
malaria vector an. gambiae. interestingly, species-specific expression several
gustatory receptors olfactory organs indicate role olfaction rather
than gustation. additionally, expansive role maxillary palps in
olfaction implicated previously thought, albeit zoophilic 
an. quadriannulatus.
