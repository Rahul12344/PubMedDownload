babesia microti babesia duncani main causative agents human
babesiosis united states. significant knowledge b. microti has
been gained past years, nothing known b. duncani biology,
pathogenesis, mode transmission sensitivity currently recommended
therapies. studies immunocompetent wild type mice hamsters shown that
unlike b. microti, infection b. duncani results severe pathology and
ultimately death. parasite factors involved b. duncani virulence remain
unknown. report first known completed sequence annotation 
apicoplast mitochondrial genomes b. duncani. found apicoplast 
genome parasite consists 34 kb monocistronic circular molecule
encoding functions important apicoplast gene transcription well
as translation maturation organelle's proteins. mitochondrial
genome b. duncani consists 5.9 kb monocistronic linear molecule two 
inverted repeats 48 bp ends. using conserved cytochrome b (cytb)
and cytochrome c oxidase subunit (coxi) proteins encoded mitochondrial
genome, phylogenetic analysis revealed b. duncani defines new lineage
among apicomplexan parasites distinct b. microti, babesia bovis, theileria
spp. plasmodium spp. annotation apicoplast mitochondrial genomes
of b. duncani identified targets development effective therapies. our
studies set stage evaluation efficacy drugs alone in
combination b. duncani culture well animal models.
