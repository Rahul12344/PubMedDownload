background: hainan province one severe endemic regions high
transmission plasmodium falciparum plasmodium vivax china. however, the
incidence p. falciparum p. vivax dropped dramatically since 2007 a
national elimination malaria programme (nemp) launched 2010. better 
understand genetic information p. vivax population elimination of
malaria hainan province, extent genetic diversity p. vivax isolates 
in hainan province investigated using four polymorphic genetic markers,
including p. vivax merozoite surface proteins 1, 3α, 3β (pvmsp-1, pvmsp-3α,
and pvmsp-3β) circumsporozoite protein (pvcsp).
methods: isolates p. vivax (n = 27) hainan province collected from
2009 2010 pvmsp-1 pvcsp analysed dna sequencing, respectively.
using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism were
analysed pvmsp-3α, pvmsp-3β.
results: dna sequencing analysis pvmsp1 revealed three
allele types: salvador-1 (sal-1), belem recombinant (r) types. among them,
sal-1 type dominant strain eight variant subtypes (88.9%), whereas r- 
(3.7%) belem-type strains (7.4%) one variant subtypes, respectively. 
the isolates carried pvcsp vk210 type accounting 85.2% (23/27 isolates) 
and vk247 type accounting 14.8% (4/27). type type b alleles were
successfully amplified pvmsp-3α gene, high level polymorphism was
observed pvmsp-3α. considering pvmsp-3β gene, type predominant type 
in 17 isolates (63%), whereas type b dominant ten isolates (37%).
conclusion: present data indicate high degree genetic
diversity among p. vivax population hainan province china the
pre-elimination stage malaria, 26 unique haplotypes observed among 27
samples.
