background: plasmodium knowlesi simian malaria parasite widespread
in humans malaysian borneo. however, little known incidence and
distribution parasite sandakan division, malaysian borneo.
therefore, aim present epidemiological study investigate the
incidence distribution p. knowlesi well plasmodium species 
this division based recent developed hexaplex pcr system (plasmonex™).
methods: total 189 whole blood samples collected telupid health
clinic, sabah, malaysia, 2008 2011. patients participated 
study microscopically malaria positive recruitment. complete
demographic details haematological profiles obtained 85 patients
(13 females 72 males). identification plasmodium species conducted
using plasmonex™ targeting 18s ssu rrna gene.
results: total 178 samples positive plasmodium species using
plasmonex™. plasmodium falciparum identified 68 samples (38.2%) followed
by 64 cases (36.0%) plasmodium vivax, 42 (23.6%) cases p. knowlesi, two
(1.1%) cases plasmodium malariae two (1.1%) mixed-species infections (i e,
p. vivax/p. falciparum). thirty-five plasmonex™ positive p. knowlesi samples were
misdiagnosed p. malariae microscopy. plasmodium knowlesi detected in
all four districts sandakan division highest incidence the
kinabatangan district. thrombocytopaenia anaemia showed most
frequent malaria-associated haematological complications study.
conclusions: discovery p. knowlesi sandakan division showed that
prospective studies epidemiological risk factors transmission dynamics
of p. knowlesi areas crucial order develop strategies for
effective malaria control. availability advanced diagnostic tool
plasmonex™ enhanced accuracy accelerated speed diagnosis of
malaria.
