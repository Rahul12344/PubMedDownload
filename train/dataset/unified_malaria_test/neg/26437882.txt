inhibiting plasmodium development mosquitoes block malaria transmission. 
fibrinogen-related protein 1 (frep1) critical parasite infection in
anopheles gambiae facilitates plasmodium invasion mosquitoes through
interacting gametocytes ookinetes. test hypothesis small
molecules disrupt interaction prevent parasites infecting
mosquitoes, developed elisa-based method screen fungal extract
library. obtained candidate fungal extract aspergillus niger that
inhibited interaction frep1 p. falciparum infected cells about
92%. inhibition specificity confirmed immunofluorescence assays.
notably, feeding mosquitoes candidate fungal extract significantly
inhibited p. falciparum infection midgut without cytotoxicity or
inhibition development p. falciparum gametocytes ookinetes. a
bioactive natural product prevents frep1 binding gametocytes or
ookinetes isolated identified p-orlandin. importantly, nontoxic
orlandin significantly reduced p. falciparum infection intensity mosquitoes.
therefore, disruption interaction frep1 parasites effectively 
reduces plasmodium infection mosquitoes. targeting frep1 small molecules 
is thus effective novel approach block malaria transmission.
