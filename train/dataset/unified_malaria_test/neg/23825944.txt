during blood stage infection, plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes (ie)
bind host blood vessels. virulence determinant enables parasites evade
spleen-dependent killing mechanisms, paradoxically cases may reduce
parasite fitness killing host. adhesion infected erythrocytes is
mediated p. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1), family of
polymorphic adhesion proteins encoded var genes. whereas cerebral binding 
severe malaria associated parasites expressing dc8 dc13 var genes,
relatively little known non-brain endothelial selection severe
malaria adhesive types. study, selected p. falciparum-ies diverse
endothelial cell types demonstrate dc8 dc13 var genes were
consistently among major var transcripts selected non-brain endothelial
cells (lung, heart, bone marrow). investigate molecular basis this
avid endothelial binding activity, recombinant proteins expressed the
predominant upregulated dc8 transcript, it4var19. in-depth binding comparisons
revealed multiple extracellular domains protein bound brain and
non-brain endothelial cells, individual domains largely discriminate 
between different endothelial cell types. additionally, found recombinant
dc8 dc13 cidr1 domains exhibited widespread endothelial binding activity
and could compete dc8-ie binding brain endothelial cells, suggesting 
may bind host receptor. findings provide new insights the
interaction severe malaria adhesive types host blood vessels support
the hypothesis parasites causing severe malaria express pfemp1 variants with
a superior ability adhere diverse endothelial cell types, may therefore
endow parasites growth transmission advantage.
