the host immune response parasitic infections plays important role in
controlling multiplication parasite reducing clinical symptoms and
life-threatening complications. nitric oxide (no), important innate immune
factor classic th1 immune effector, may play role inhibiting plasmodium 
infection. study, used two different approaches (l-arginine [precursor
of no] noc5 [short-time donor]) prove roles malaria
infection. used 6-8 week-old female balb/c mice infected rodent
malaria plasmodium yoelii landau, michel et adam, 1968 - strain 17xl (p.y17xl) as
a model. l-arg treatment, mice administered oral dose 1.5
mg/g l-arg daily seven consecutive days prior infection py17xl. l-arg
pretreatment resulted decrease mrna level apical membrane
antigen 1 (ama1) gene, encodes protein involved host invasion. for
noc5 treatment, noc5 injected intraperitoneally p.y17xl infected
mice day 5 post-infection incubated vitro purified py17xl
schizonts. vivo vitro treatments noc5 led down-regulation 
of transcript protein levels invasion-related molecules (ama1,
merozoites surface protein 1 py235). results confirmed protective
role asexual blood stage parasitic infection, may be
partially due reduced expression parasite invasion molecules.
