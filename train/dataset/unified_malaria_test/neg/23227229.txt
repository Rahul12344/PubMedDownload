apical membrane antigen 1 (ama1) leading malaria vaccine candidate a
target naturally-acquired human immunity. plasmodium falciparum ama1 is
polymorphic vaccine trials induces strain-specific protection. this
antigenic diversity major roadblock development ama1 malaria
vaccine understanding overcome essential. assess ama1
antigenic diversity limits cross-strain growth inhibition, assembled panel
of 18 different p. falciparum isolates broadly representative global
ama1 sequence diversity. antibodies raised four well studied ama1 alleles
(w2mef, 3d7, hb3 fvo) tested growth inhibition 18 different
p. falciparum isolates growth inhibition assays (gia). antibodies
demonstrated substantial cross-inhibitory activity different isolates and
a mixture four different ama1 antibodies inhibited 18 isolates tested,
suggesting significant antigenic overlap ama1 alleles limited
antigenic diversity ama1. cross-strain inhibition antibodies only
moderately inconsistently correlated level sequence diversity
between ama1 alleles, suggesting sequence differences strong
predictor antigenic differences cross-inhibitory activity of
anti-allele antibodies. importance highly polymorphic c1-l region 
inhibitory antibodies potential vaccine escape assessed generating
novel transgenic p. falciparum lines testing gia. polymorphic
c1-l epitope identified significant target growth-inhibitory
antibodies, antibodies constituted minor proportion total
inhibitory antibody repertoire, suggesting antigenic diversity of
inhibitory epitopes limited. findings support concept a
multi-allele ama1 vaccine would give broad coverage diversity ama1
alleles establish new tools define polymorphisms important vaccine
