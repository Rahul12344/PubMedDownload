while efforts control malaria available tools stagnated, and
arbovirus outbreaks persist around globe, advent clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeat (crispr)-based gene editing provided
exciting new opportunities genetics-based strategies control these
diseases. one strategy, called "population replacement", mosquitoes, 
other disease vectors engineered effector genes render unable 
to transmit pathogens. effector genes linked "gene drive" systems
that bias inheritance favor, providing novel opportunities to
replace disease-susceptible vector populations disease-refractory ones 
the course several generations. promising control of
vector-borne diseases wide scale, sets evolutionary tug-of-war
between introduced effector genes pathogen. here, review the
disease-refractory genes designed date target plasmodium falciparum malaria
transmitted anopheles gambiae, arboviruses transmitted aedes aegypti,
including dengue serotypes 2 3, chikungunya, zika viruses. discuss
resistance concerns effector genes, genetic approaches prevent
parasite viral escape variants. one general approach increase the
evolutionary hurdle required pathogen evolve resistance attacking
it multiple sites genome and/or multiple stages development. another
is reduce size pathogen population means, with
vector control antimalarial drugs. discuss lessons learned the
evolution resistance antimalarial antiviral drugs implications 
the management resistance emergence. finally, discuss target 
product profile population replacement strategies vector-borne disease
control. differs early phase field trials wide-scale disease
control. latter case, demands effector gene efficacy great;
however, new possibilities ushered crispr-based gene editing, when
combined surveillance, monitoring, rapid management pathogen
resistance, odds increasingly favoring effector genes upcoming
evolutionary tug-of-war.
