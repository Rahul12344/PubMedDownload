latent epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection contributes b-cell and
epithelial-cell malignancies. however, whether lytic ebv infection also
contributes tumors unclear, although association malaria
infection burkitt lymphomas (bls) may involve excessive lytic ebv
replication. particular variant viral promoter (zp) controls lytic 
ebv reactivation over-represented, relative frequency non-malignant 
tissue, ebv-positive nasopharyngeal carcinomas aids-related lymphomas. 
date, functional differences prototype zp (zp-p) the
cancer-associated variant (zp-v3) identified. show a
single nucleotide difference zp-v3 zp-p promoters creates a
binding site cellular transcription factor, nfatc1, zp-v3 (but not
zp-p) variant, greatly enhances zp activity lytic viral reactivation in
response nfatc1-inducing stimuli b-cell receptor activation and
ionomycin. furthermore, demonstrate restoring nfatc1-motif the
zp-p variant context intact ebv b95.8 strain genome greatly
enhances lytic viral reactivation response nfatc1-activating agent,
ionomycin, effect blocked nfat inhibitory agent, cyclosporine,
as well nfatc1 sirna. also show zp-v3 variant over-represented 
in ebv-positive bls gastric cancers, ebv-transformed b-cell lines
derived ebv-infected breast milk kenyan mothers malaria during
pregnancy. results demonstrate zp-v3 enhances ebv lytic
reactivation physiologically-relevant stimuli, suggest increased
lytic infection may contribute increased prevalence variant in
ebv-associated malignancies.
