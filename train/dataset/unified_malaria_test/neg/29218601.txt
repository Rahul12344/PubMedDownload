hematopoiesis hierarchically orchestrated small population of
hematopoietic stem cells (hscs) reside bone-marrow niche are
tightly regulated maintain homeostatic blood production. hscs are
predominantly quiescent, enter cell cycle response to
inflammatory signals evoked severe systemic infection injury. thus,
hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (hspcs) activated pathogen
recognition receptors proinflammatory cytokines induce emergency
myelopoiesis infection. emergency myelopoiesis counterbalances the
loss cells generates lineage-restricted hematopoietic progenitors,
eventually replenishing mature myeloid cells control infection. controlled
generation signals effectively augments host defense, dysregulated
stimulation signals harmful hspcs. hematopoietic failure
often results blood disorders including chronic inflammatory diseases and
hematological malignancies. recently, found interleukin (il)-27, one of
the il-6/il-12 family cytokines, unique ability directly act hscs and
promote expansion differentiation myeloid progenitors. this
process resulted enhanced production neutrophils emergency myelopoiesis 
during blood-stage mouse malaria infection. review, summarize
recent advances regulation myelopoiesis proinflammatory cytokines
including type ii interferons, il-6, il-27, granulocyte colony-stimulating 
factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, il-1 infectious diseases.
