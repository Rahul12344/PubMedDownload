background: protective malaria vaccine likely need elicit both
cell-mediated antibody responses. adenovirus vaccine vectors induce both
these responses humans, phase 1/2a clinical trial conducted evaluate 
the efficacy adenovirus serotype 5-vectored malaria vaccine against
sporozoite challenge.
methodology/principal findings: nmrc-mv-ad-pfc adenovirus vector encoding
the plasmodium falciparum 3d7 circumsporozoite protein (csp). one component
of two-component vaccine nmrc-m3v-ad-pfca consisting one adenovector
encoding csp one encoding apical membrane antigen-1 (ama1) evaluated
for safety immunogenicity earlier study (see companion paper, sedegah
et al). fourteen ad5 seropositive negative adults received two doses of
nmrc-mv-ad-pfc sixteen weeks apart, 1 x 1010 particle units per dose. the
vaccine safe well tolerated. volunteers developed positive elispot
responses 28 days first immunization (geometric mean 272 spot
forming cells/million[sfc/m]) declined following 16 weeks and
increased second dose levels cases less the
initial peak (geometric mean 119 sfc/m). cd8+ predominated cd4+ responses,
as first clinical trial. antibody responses poor like elispot
responses increased second immunization exceed initial 
peak. pre-existing neutralizing antibodies (nab) ad5 affect the
immunogenicity first dose, fold increase nab induced the
first dose significantly associated poorer antibody responses 
second dose, elispot responses remained unaffected. challenged 
bite p. falciparum-infected mosquitoes, two 11 volunteers showed delay in
the time patency compared infectivity controls, volunteers were
sterilely protected.
significance: nmrc-mv-ad-pfc vaccine expressing csp safe well
tolerated given two doses, provide sterile protection.
