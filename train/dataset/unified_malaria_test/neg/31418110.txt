plasmodium falciparum (pf) refurbishes infected erythrocytes exporting a
myriad parasite proteins host cell. novel exported protein family
'plasmodium helical interspersed subtelomeric' (phist) gained attention for
its significant roles parasite biology. here, collected analysed
available information phist members enhance understanding their
functions, varied localization structure-function correlation. functional
diversity phist proteins highlighted involvement pfemp1 (pf
erythrocyte membrane protein 1) expression, trafficking switching. this
family also contributes cytoadherence, gametocytogenesis, host cell
modification generation extracellular vesicles. phist domain
forms hallmark family, existence functions additional domains 
(lymp, tigr01639) mec motif underscores diversity further. since
specific phist proteins seem form pairs pfemp1 members, used in
silico tools predict potential partners pf. information our
analysis structural data phist member provide important insights into
their functioning. review overall enables readers view phist family
comprehensively, highlighting key knowledge gaps field.
