background: cytoadherence plasmodium falciparum thought mediated 
by variant surface antigens (vsa), encoded var, rif, stevor pfmc-2tm
genes. last three families rarely studied context of
cytoadherence. vsa genes unique, variability among sequences 
impeded functional study vsa across different p. falciparum strains.
however, many p. falciparum genomes recently sequenced, allowing the
development specific microarray probes vsa gene.
methods: vsa sequences hb3, dd2 it/fcr3 genomes extracted
using hmmer software. oligonucleotide probes designed oligorankpick and
added 3d7-based microarray chip. proof concept, it/r29 parasites
were selected rosette formation transcriptomes of
isogenic rosetting non-rosetting parasites compared microarray.
results: parasite strain 50-56 var genes, 125-132 rif genes, 26-33
stevor genes 3-8 pfmc-2tm genes identified. bioinformatic analysis of
the new vsa sequences showed 13 rif genes five stevor genes were
well-conserved across least three strains (83-100% amino acid identity). the
ability vsa-supplemented microarray chip detect cytoadherence-related
genes assessed using p. falciparum clone it/r29, rosetting known 
to mediated pfemp1 encoded itvar9. whole transcriptome analysis showed
that highly up-regulated gene rosetting parasites itvar9 (19 to
429-fold up-regulated six time points). one rif gene (it4rifa_042) 
up-regulated four fold (five fold 12 hours post-invasion), no
stevor pfmc-2tm genes up-regulated two fold. 377 non-vsa
genes differentially expressed three fold rosetting parasites,
although none markedly consistently up-regulated itvar9.
conclusions: probes vsa newly sequenced p. falciparum strains be
added 3d7-based microarray chip, allowing analysis entire
transcriptome multiple strains. rosetting clone it/r29, striking
transcriptional upregulation itvar9 confirmed, data not
support involvement vsa families rosette formation.
