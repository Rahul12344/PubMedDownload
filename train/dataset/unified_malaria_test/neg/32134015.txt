background & objectives: india, spotted fever group rickettsiae (sfgr) 
underdiagnosed cause acute febrile illness (afi). non-specific weil-felix 
test first diagnostic modality diagnosis sfgr many
laboratories due lack advanced diagnostic facilities developing
countries. aim study detect sfgr using molecular methods in
the patients, presenting afi tertiary care centre north india.
methods: consecutive patients (>14 yr age) afi enrolled six
month period. standard investigations common pathogens causing afi india
(malaria, dengue, scrub typhus, leptospirosis enteric fever) carried
out. patients negative investigations, blood was
subjected polymerase chain reaction (pcr) targeting outer membrane protein a
(ompa) gene rickettsia.
results: 51 patients undiagnosed aetiology, three positive by
ompa pcr. two pcr products produced good sequences blast
identification confirmed rickettsia conorii. sequences r. conorii 
reported south india clustered two previously reported novel
rickettsial genotypes. study sequences clustered group different from
that rickettsia spp. south indian sequences reported earlier.
interpretation & conclusions: study showed existence r. conorii in
north india. testing sfgr may included diagnostic workup afi for
better disease management.
