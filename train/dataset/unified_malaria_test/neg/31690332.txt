background: insecticides formulated products target anopheles mosquitos
have immense impact reducing malaria cases africa. however,
resistance currently used insecticides spreading rapidly an
urgent need alternative public health insecticides. potential new
insecticides must screened range characterized mosquito strains
to identify potential resistance liabilities. liverpool school tropical
medicine maintains three susceptible four resistant anopheles strains that
are widely used screening new insecticides. properties these
strains described paper.
methods: tube susceptibility bioassays used colony selection 
screen resistance major classes public health insecticides. topical
and tarsal contact bioassays used produce dose response curves assess 
resistance intensity. bioassays synergist piperonyl butoxide also
performed. taqman™ assays used screen known target site resistance
alleles (kdr ace-1). rt-qpcr used quantify expression genes
associated pyrethroid resistance.
results: pyrethroid selection pressure maintained resistance class in
all four resistant strains. carbamate organophosphate resistance has
been lost lack exposure insecticide classes. anopheles
gambiae (sensu lato) strains, vk7 2014, banfora tiassalé 13 higher
levels pyrethroid resistance an. funestus fumoz-r strain. elevated
expression p450s found four strains 1014f kdr mutation is
present three an. gambiae strains varying frequencies. tarsal contact
data overexpression cyp4g16 sap2 suggest penetration barriers and/or
sequestration also confer resistance banfora m.
conclusions: continual selection deltamethrin maintained stable
pyrethroid-resistant phenotype many generations. conjunction a
standardized rearing regime, ensures quality control strains time
allowing robust product comparison selection optimal products for
further development. identification multiple mechanisms underpinning
insecticide resistance highlights importance screening new compounds
against range mosquito strains.
