second-generation sequencing technologies made large-scale sequencing
projects commonplace. however, making use datasets often requires gene
function ascribed genome wide. although tool development kept pace with
the changes sequence production, tasks mapping, de novo assembly
or visualization, genome annotation remains challenge. developed a
method rapidly provide accurate annotation new genomes using previously
annotated genomes reference. method, implemented tool called ratt
(rapid annotation transfer tool), transfers annotations high-quality
reference new genome basis conserved synteny. demonstrate 
a mycobacterium tuberculosis genome single 2.5 mb chromosome malaria 
parasite annotated less five minutes modest
computational resources. ratt available http://ratt.sourceforge.net.
