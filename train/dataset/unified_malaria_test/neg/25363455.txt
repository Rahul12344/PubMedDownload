primaquine generally available anti-malarial prevents relapse in
vivax ovale malaria, potent gametocytocide falciparum
malaria. primaquine becomes increasingly important malaria-endemic countries
move towards elimination, although widely recommended, commonly
not given malaria patients haemolytic toxicity subjects 
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficient (gene frequency typically
3-30% malaria endemic areas; >180 different genetic variants). six decades 
of primaquine use approximately 200 million people, 14 deaths been
reported. confining estimate reports known denominators gives an
estimated mortality one 621,428 (upper 95% ci: one 407,807). one
death followed multiple dosing prevent vivax malaria relapse. review of
dose-response relationships clinical trials primaquine g6pd deficiency 
suggests currently recommended single low dose (0.25Â mg base/kg) 
block falciparum malaria transmission confers low risk haemolytic
toxicity.
