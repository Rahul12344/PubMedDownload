the overexpression atp-binding cassette (abc) transporters confers multidrug
resistance (mdr) tumor cells. abcg2 member abc superfamily. the
present study aimed investigate correlation abcg2 expression and
the mdr esophageal cancer estimate therapeutic benefit of
downregulating abcg2 expression reversing chemoresistance esophageal cells
using artesunate (art). eca109/abcg2 cell line established by
transfecting abcg2 gene eca109 cells. eca109/abcg2 esophageal cancer
cells abcg2 gene overexpression resistant adriamycin (adm),
daunorubicin (dnr) mitoxantrone (mit), indicated abcg2 may be
associated drug resistance esophageal cancer. art noteworthy
antimalarial agent, particularly severe drug-resistant cancer cases, as
art able reverse drug resistance. present study, art also exerted
profound anticancer activity. mechanism reversal multidrug
resistance art esophageal carcinoma analyzed using cellular
experiments, still remains largely unknown.
