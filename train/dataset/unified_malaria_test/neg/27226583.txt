diversity pathogen genetic loci driven host adaptive immune
selection pressure may reveal proteins important parasite biology.
population-based genome sequencing plasmodium falciparum, parasite
responsible severe form malaria, highlighted two related
polymorphic genes called dblmsp dblmsp2, encode duffy binding-like
(dbl) domain-containing proteins located merozoite surface whose
function remains unknown. using recombinant proteins transgenic parasites, we
show dblmsp dblmsp2 directly avidly bind human igm via dbl
domains. used whole genome sequence data 400 african asian p.
falciparum isolates show dblmsp dblmsp2 exhibit extreme protein
polymorphism dbl domain, multiple variants two major allelic
classes present every population tested. despite variability, igm
binding function retained across diverse sequence representatives. although
this interaction seem effect ability parasite to
invade red blood cells, binding dblmsp dblmsp2 igm inhibited the
overall immunoreactivity proteins igg patients been
exposed parasite. suggests igm binding might mask proteins
from host humoral immune system.
