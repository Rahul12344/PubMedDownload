background: humoral immune responses proteins asexual blood-stage
malaria parasites associated clinical immunity. however,
variations antibody-driven responses may associated genetic
component human host. objective present study evaluate
the influence co-stimulatory molecule gene polymorphisms immune system 
on magnitude humoral immune response plasmodium vivax
vaccine candidate antigen.
methods: polymorphisms cd28, ctla4, icos, cd40, cd86 blys genes 178
subjects infected p. vivax endemic area brazilian amazon were
genotyped polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism
(pcr-rflp). levels igm, total igg igg subclasses specific icb2-5, 
i.e., n-terminal portion p. vivax merozoite surface protein 1 (pvmsp-1),
were determined enzyme-linked immuno assay. associations the
polymorphisms antibody response assessed means logistic
regression models.
results: correcting multiple testing, igg1 levels were
significantly higher individuals recessive single nucleotide
polymorphism rs3116496 cd28 (p = 0.00004). furthermore, interaction
between cd28 rs35593994 blys rs9514828 influence igm levels
(p = 0.0009).
conclusions: results present study support hypothesis that
polymorphisms genes co-stimulatory components immune system 
contribute natural antibody-driven response p. vivax antigens.
