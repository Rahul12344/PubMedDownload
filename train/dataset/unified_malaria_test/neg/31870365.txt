background: clear understanding mosquito biology fundamental the
control efforts mosquito-borne diseases malaria. mosquito
mark-release-recapture (mmrr) experiments popular method measuring the
survival dispersal disease vectors; however, examples african malaria
vectors limited. ethical technical difficulties involved carrying 
mmrr studies may held back research area and, therefore, device
that marks mosquitoes emerge breeding sites developed and
evaluated overcome problems mmrr.
methods: modified self-marking unit marks mosquitoes fluorescent
pigment emerge breeding site developed based previous
design culex mosquitoes. self-marking unit first evaluated under
semi-field conditions laboratory-reared anopheles arabiensis determine
the marking success impact mosquito survival. subsequently, field
evaluation mmrr conducted yombo village, tanzania, examine the
feasibility system.
results: semi-field evaluation self-marking units successfully
marked 86% emerging mosquitoes effect fluorescent marker
on mosquito survival. unit successfully marked wild male female anopheles
gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) sufficiently large numbers justify use in
mmrr studies. estimated daily survival probability an. gambiae s.l. was
0.87 (95% ci 0.69-1.10) mean dispersal distance 579 m (95% ci 521-636 m).
conclusions: study demonstrates successful use self-marking device 
in mmrr study african malaria vectors. method may useful in
investigating population structure dispersal mosquitoes deployment and
evaluation future vector control tools, gene drive, better
parameterize mathematical models.
