background: plasmodium falciparum, resistance chloroquine (cq) conferred
by k mutation amino acid position 76 (k76t) p. falciparum cq
transporter (pfcrt). date, least 15 pfcrt genotypes, represented 
by combinations five amino acids positions 72-76, described in
field isolates various endemic regions. identify novel mutant pfcrt
genotypes reveal genetic relatedness pfcrt genotypes, large-scale
survey wide geographic area performed.
methods: sequences exon 2 pfcrt, including known polymorphic sites at
amino acid positions 72, 74, 75 76, obtained 256 p. falciparum
isolates collected eight endemic countries asia (bangladesh, cambodia,
lao p.d.r., philippines thailand), melanesia (papua new guinea and
vanuatu) africa (ghana). haplotype network constructed based six
microsatellite markers located -29 kb 24 kb pfcrt order examine the
genetic relatedness among mutant pfcrt genotypes.
results: addition wild type (cvmnk positions 72-76), four mutant pfcrt
were identified; cviet, cvidt, svmnt cvmnt (mutated amino acids underlined). 
haplotype network revealed three mutant pfcrt lineages,
originating indochina, philippines melanesia. importantly, indochina
lineage contained two mutant pfcrt genotypes, cviet (n = 95) cvidt (n = 14), 
indicating cvidt shares common origin cviet. similarly, one major
haplotype melanesian lineage contained two pfcrt genotypes; svmnt (n = 71)
and cvmnt (n = 3). africa, mutant pfcrt genotypes cviet the
indochina lineage, probably resulting intercontinental migration cq
resistance southeast asia.
conclusions: number cq-mutant lineages observed study was
identical found previous studies. supports hypothesis that
the emergence novel cq resistance rare. however, mutant pfcrt
genotypes, amino acid changes positions 72, 74 75 appear recently 
been generated least several times, producing distinct pfcrt mutant genotypes.
the occurrence new mutations flanking k76t may yield stronger resistance cq
and/or higher fitness original pfcrt mutant.
