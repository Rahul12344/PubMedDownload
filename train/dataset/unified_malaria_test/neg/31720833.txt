avian malaria mosquito-borne disease caused plasmodium spp. protozoa, and
penguins considered particularly susceptible disease, developing
rapid outbreaks potentially high mortality. report outbreak of
avian malaria magellanic penguins (spheniscus magellanicus) a
rehabilitation center espírito santo, southeast brazil. august and
september 2015, total 89 magellanic penguins (87 juveniles 2 adults)
received care institute research rehabilitation marine animals. over
a period 2 weeks, plasmodium infections identified eight individuals
(9.0%), four died (mortality = 4.5%, lethality = 50%). blood smears 
sequencing mitochondrial cytochrome b gene revealed presence of
plasmodium lutzi spmag06, plasmodium elongatum grw06, plasmodium sp. phpat01,
plasmodium sp. spmag10, plasmodium cathemerium (sequencing successful).
two unusual morphological features observed individuals infected with
lineage spmag06: (a) lack clumping pigment granules (b) presence of
circulating exoerythrocytic meronts. hematological results (packed cell volume,
plasma total solids, complete blood cell counts) positive individuals showed
differences negative individuals depending lineages, but
there overarching pattern consistently observed plasmodium spp.
