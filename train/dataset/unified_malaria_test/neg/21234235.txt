a family calcium-dependent protein kinases (cdpks) unique enzyme which
plays crucial roles intracellular calcium signaling plants, algae, and
protozoa. cdpks malaria parasites known key regulators for
stage-specific cellular responses calcium, widespread secondary messenger
that controls progression parasite. study, identified gene
encoding plasmodium vivax cdpk4 (pvcdpk4) characterized molecular
property cellular localization. pvcdpk4 typical cdpk had
well-conserved n-terminal kinase domain c-terminal calmodulin-like structure 
with 4 ef hand motifs calcium-binding. recombinant protein ef hand
domain pvcdpk4 expressed e. coli 34 kda product obtained.
immunofluorescence assay confocal laser microscopy revealed protein
was expressed mature schizont p. vivax. expression pvcdpk4-ef in
schizont suggests may participate proliferation egress process 
in life cycle parasite.
