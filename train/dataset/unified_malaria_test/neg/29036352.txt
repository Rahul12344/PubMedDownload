intersexual genetic correlations expected constrain evolution of
sexual dimorphic traits, including degree sex-biased gene expression.
consistent expectation, studies fruit flies birds reported 
that genes whose expression strong intersexual genetic correlation (rmf)
show lower level sex-biased expression (sbe). however, known both
rmf sbe affected environment. therefore unclear whether
there consistent relationship 2 quantities across multiple
environments. paper, study relationship african malaria
mosquito anopheles gambiae. show rmf sbe change between
environments. change sbe across environments significantly correlated
with dn/ds: greater changes sbe associated higher values dn/ds.
furthermore, relationship rmf sbe sensitive the
environment. conclude relationship sufficiently plastic that
environmental effects considered future studies.
