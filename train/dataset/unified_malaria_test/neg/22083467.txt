emergence artemisinin resistance cambodia highlights importance of
characterizing resistance class drugs. previously, intermediate levels
of resistance plasmodium falciparum generated vitro artelinic acid
(al) artemisinin (qhs). expanded earlier selection efforts to
produce levels clinically relevant concentrations, resulting lines
were characterized genotypically phenotypically. recrudescence assays
determined ability resistant parent lines recover following
exposure clinically relevant levels drugs. interestingly, parent clone 
(d6) tolerated 1,500 ng/ml qhs, resistant parasite, d6.qhs340Ã—3,
recovered following exposure 2,400 ng/ml qhs. resistant d6, w2, tm91c235
parasites exhibited elevated 50% inhibitory concentrations (ic(50)s) to
multiple artemisinin drugs, >3-fold resistance qhs al; however, the
degree resistance obtained standard methods remarkably less than
expected parasite lines recovered 2,400-ng/ml drug pressure. a
novel assay format radiolabeled hypoxanthine demonstrated greater degree
of resistance vitro standard sybr green method. analysis merozoite
number resistant parasites found d6 tm91c235 resistant progeny had
significantly fewer merozoites parent strains, whereas w2 resistant progeny 
had significantly more. amplification pfmdr1 increased proportionately 
increased drug levels tolerated w2 tm91c235, resistant d6. in
summary, define artemisinin resistance phenotype decrease in
susceptibility artemisinins along ability recover from
drug-induced dormancy following supraclinical concentrations drug.
