background: molecular tools detecting malaria-infected mosquitoes with
improved practicality, sensitivity specificity, high-throughput are
required. common pcr technique used detect mosquitoes infected with
plasmodium spp. nested pcr assay based 18s-rrna gene. however, this
technique several technical limitations, laborious time consuming.
methods: study, pcr-based plasmodium cytochrome oxidase i
(cox-i) gene compared 18s-rrna nested pcr using serial dilutions
(330-0.0012 pg) dna plasmodium vivax, plasmodium falciparum and
plasmodium knowlesi dna 48 positive negative kenyan mosquitoes 
(previously detected using elisa pcr). assay plasmodium spp.
dna detection using fast cox-i pcr assay performed individually on
2122 field collected mosquitoes (from solomon islands) dna was
extracted head thorax.
results: fast cox-i pcr assay took 1 h run consistently detected as
low 0.043 pg parasite dna (equivalent two parasites) single pcr,
while analyses 18s-rrna nested pcr required 4 h complete a
consistent detection threshold 1.5 pg dna. assays produced concordant 
results applied 48 kenyan control samples known plasmodium spp. 
infection status. fast cox-i pcr identified 23/2122 plasmodium-infected
mosquitoes solomon islands.
conclusions: new cox-i pcr adapted single pcr reaction faster,
simpler, cheaper, sensitive technique amenable high-throughput analyses
for plasmodium dna detection mosquitoes comparable 18s-rrna
nested pcr. improved sensitivity seen fast cox-i pcr improve
the accuracy mosquito infection rate determination.
