background: renewed malaria eradication efforts require understanding of
the seasonal patterns frequency polymorphic variants order focus
limited funds productively. although cross-sectional studies holoendemic areas
spanning single year could useful describing parasite genotype status 
a given point, information inadequate describing temporal trends in
genotype polymorphisms. plasmodium falciparum isolates kisumu district
hospital, plasmodium falciparum chloroquine-resistance transporter gene
(pfcrt-k76t) p. falciparum multidrug resistance gene 1 (pfmdr1-n86y), were
analyzed polymorphisms parasitemia changes 53 months march
2008 august 2012. observations compared prevailing climatic factors,
including humidity, rainfall, temperature.
methods: parasitemia (the percentage infected red blood cells per total red
blood cells) established microscopy p. falciparum malaria-positive
samples. p. falciparum dna extracted whole blood using qiagen dna
blood mini kit. single nucleotide polymorphism identification positions
pfcrt-k76t pfmdr1-n86y performed using real-time polymerase chain
reaction and/or sequencing. data climatic variables obtained from
http://www.tutiempo.net/en/.
results: total 895 field isolates 2008 (n=169), 2009 (n=161), 2010
(n=216), 2011 (n=223), 2012 (n=126) showed large variations monthly
frequency pfmdr1-n86y pfcrt-k76t mutant genotypes decreased from
68.4%±15% 38.1%±13% 29.8%±18% 13.3%±9%, respectively. mean
percentage parasitemia 2.61%±1.01% (coefficient variation 115.86%;
n=895). correlation genotype parasitemia climatic
factors.
conclusion: study shows variability frequency pfcrt-k76t and
pfmdr1-n86y polymorphisms study period, bringing focus role
of cross-sectional studies describing temporal genotype trends. lack of
correlation genotypes climatic changes, especially precipitation,
emphasizes cost investment genotype change.
