background: primaquine (pq) recommended addition standard malaria
treatments pre-elimination settings due pronounced activity against
mature plasmodium falciparum gametocytes, parasite stage responsible for
onward transmission mosquitoes. however, pq may trigger haemolysis in
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd)-deficient individuals. additional human 
genetic factors, including polymorphisms human cytochrome p450 2d6
(cyp2d6) complex, may negatively influence efficacy pq. study
assessed prevalence g6pd deficiency two important cyp2d6 variants in
representative pre-elimination settings south africa, inform malaria
elimination strategies.
methods: volunteers (n = 248) attending six primary health care facilities a
malaria-endemic region south africa enrolled october november
2015. g6pd status determined phenotypically, using carestart™ g6pd rapid
diagnostic test (rdt), genotypically two common african g6pd variants,
namely a+ (a376g) a- (g202a, a542t, g680t & t968c) pcr, restriction
fragment length polymorphisms (rflp) dna sequencing. cyp2d6*4 cyp2d6*17
variants determined pcr rflp.
results: prevalence 13% (33/248) g6pd deficiency observed cohort 
by g6pd rdt whilst genotypic assessment, 32% (79/248) a+ 3.2% were
a-, respectively. among male participants, 11% (6/55) g6pd a-
hemizygous; among females 1% (2/193) g6pd a- homozygous 16% (32/193)
g6pd a- heterozygous. strength agreement phenotyping and
genotyping result fair (cohens kappa κ = 0.310). negative predictive
value g6pd rdt detecting hemizygous, homozygous heterozygous
individuals 0.88 (95% ci 0.85-0.91), compared sensitive
genotyping. cyp2d6*4 allele frequencies cyp2d6*4 (inferred poor
metabolizer phenotype) cyp2d6*17 (inferred intermediate metabolizer
phenotype) 3.2 19.5%, respectively.
conclusions: phenotypic genotypic analyses detected low prevalence of
g6pd deficiency cyp2d6*4 variants. findings, combined with
increasing data confirming safety single low-dose pq individuals with
african variants g6pd deficiency, supports deployment single low-dose
pq gametocytocidal drug. pq would pose minimal risks study
populations could useful elimination strategy study area.
