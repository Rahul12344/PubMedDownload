as filarial nematodes. here, show insulin receptor knockdown blood fed
c. quinquefasciatus, major vector wb india, completely blocks the
development filarial nematode parasite infective l3 stage, results 
in decreased ecdysteroid production trypsin activity leading fewer

therefore, insulin signaling may represent new target development of
vector control parasite blocking strategies.
