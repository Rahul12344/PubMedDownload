plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1), encoded var
gene family, plays crucial role disease virulence involvement in
binding various host cellular receptors infection. growing evidence
suggests differential expression various var subgroups may be
involved parasite virulence. explore issue, collected 
isolates symptomatic patients south china-myanmar border, and
characterized sequence diversity transcription profiles time of
var gene family, cytoadherence properties time initial
collection extending two month period adaptation culture.
initially, established highly diverse, dblα (4 cysteines) subtype-enriched, 
but unique local repertoire var-dbl1α sequences cdna cloning and
sequencing. next observed rapid transcriptional decline upsa- and
upsb-subtype var genes ring stage qrt-pcr assays, switching
event initial icam-i binding cd36-binding activity first
week adaptive cultivation vitro. moreover, predominant transcription of
upsa var genes observed correlated isolates showed a
higher parasitemia time collection icam-1-binding phenotype 
culture. taken together, data indicate initial stage adaptive
process vitro significantly influences transcription virulence-related 
var subtypes expression pfemp1 variants. further, specific
upregulation upsa var genes likely linked rapid propagation of
the parasite natural infection due a-type pfemp1 variant-mediated
growth advantages.
