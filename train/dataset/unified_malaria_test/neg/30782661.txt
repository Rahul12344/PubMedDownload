alternative splicing widespread, essential, complex component gene
regulation. apicomplexan parasites long recognized produce
alternatively spliced transcripts genes produce multiple protein
products essential parasite growth. recent approaches now
providing wide-ranging surveys extent alternative splicing; some
indicate alternative splicing less widespread model
eukaryotes, whereas others suggest levels comparable previously
studied groups. many cases, apicomplexan alternative splicing events appear
not generate multiple alternative proteins instead produce aberrant or
noncoding transcripts. nonetheless, appropriate regulation alternative
splicing clearly essential plasmodium toxoplasma parasites, suggesting 
a biological role least alternative splicing observed. several
studies disrupted conserved regulators alternative splicing and
demonstrated lethal effects apicomplexans. minireview discusses methods
to accurately determine extent alternative splicing apicomplexa and
discuss potential biological roles conserved process phylum of
parasites compact genomes.
