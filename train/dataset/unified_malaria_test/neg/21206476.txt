plasmodium parasites, causative agent malaria, transmitted the
bites infected anopheles mosquitoes resulting 250 million new
infections year. despite decades research, still vaccine
against malaria, highlighting need novel control strategies. one
innovative approach use genetically modified mosquitoes effectively 
control malaria parasite transmission. deliberate alterations cell signaling
pathways mosquito, via targeted mutagenesis, found regulate
parasite development (1). studies, begin identify potential 
gene targets transformation. targeted mutagenesis traditionally relied
upon homologous recombination target gene large dna molecule.
however, construction use complex dna molecules generation of
stably transformed cell lines costly, time consuming often inefficient.
therefore, strategy using locked nucleic acid-modified oligonucleotides
(lna-ons) provides useful alternative introducing artificial single
nucleotide substitutions episomal chromosomal dna gene targets (reviewed
in (2)). lna-on-mediated targeted mutagenesis used introduce point
mutations genes interest cultured cells yeast mice (3,4). 
we show lna-ons used introduce single nucleotide change 
a transfected episomal target results switch blue fluorescent
protein (bfp) expression green fluorescent protein (gfp) expression both
anopheles gambiae anopheles stephensi cells. conversion demonstrates for
the first time effective mutagenesis target genes mosquito cells can
be mediated lna-ons suggests technique may applicable to
mutagenesis chromosomal targets vitro vivo.
