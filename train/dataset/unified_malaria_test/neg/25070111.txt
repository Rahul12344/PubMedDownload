malaria major public health problem tropical subtropical countries,
including india. study elucidates cause chloroquine treatment failure
(for plasmodium falciparum infection) introduction artemisinin
combination therapy. one hundred twenty-six patients randomized to
chloroquine treatment, therapeutic efficacy monitored days 1 
28. vitro susceptibility test performed isolates. parasitic
dna isolated, followed pcr restriction digestion different codons
of pfcrt gene (codons 72 76) pfmdr1 gene (n86y, y184f, s1034c,
n1042d, d1246y). finally, sequencing done confirm mutations.
forty-three (34.13%) early treatment failure cases 16 (12.69%) late treatment
failure cases observed chloroquine treatment. vitro chloroquine
resistance found 103 isolates (81.75%). twenty-six (60.47%) early
treatment failure cases 6 (37.5%) late treatment failure cases were
associated cvmnk-yysny allele (the underlined amino acids that
were mutated). moreover, cviek-yysny allele found 8 early treatment
failure (18.60%) 2 late treatment failure (12.5%) cases. presence 
wild-type pfcrt (cvmnk) pfmdr1 (yysny) double mutant allele in
chloroquine-nonresponsive cases quite uncommon. vivo chloroquine treatment
failure vitro chloroquine resistance strongly correlated the
cvmnk-yysny cviek-yysny haplotypes (p < 0.01).
