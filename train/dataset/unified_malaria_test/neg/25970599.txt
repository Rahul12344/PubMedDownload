background: ixodes ricinus main tick vector microbes cause
lyme disease tick-borne encephalitis europe. pathogens transmitted by
ticks overcome innate immunity barriers present tick tissues,
including midgut, salivary glands epithelia hemocoel. molecularly,
invertebrate immunity initiated pathogen recognition molecules trigger
serum cellular signalling cascades leading production of
antimicrobials, pathogen opsonization phagocytosis. presently aimed at
identifying hemocyte transcripts semi-engorged female i. ricinus ticks by
mass sequencing hemocyte cdna library annotating immune-related transcripts
based hemocyte abundance well ubiquitous distribution.
methodology/principal findings: de novo assembly 926,596 pyrosequence reads
plus 49,328,982 illumina reads (148 nt length) hemocyte library, together 
with 189 million illumina reads salivary gland midgut libraries,
generated 15,716 extracted coding sequences (cds); displayed an
annotated hyperlinked spreadsheet format. read mapping allowed identification
and annotation tissue-enriched transcripts. total 327 transcripts were
found significantly expressed hemocyte libraries, including those
coding scavenger receptors, antimicrobial peptides, pathogen recognition
proteins, proteases protease inhibitors. vitellogenin lipid metabolism
transcription enrichment suggests fat body components. additionally annotated 
ubiquitously distributed transcripts associated immune function, including
immune-associated signal transduction proteins transcription factors,
including stat transcription factor.
conclusions/significance: first systems biology approach describe 
the genes expressed haemocytes neglected disease vector. total
of 2,860 coding sequences deposited genbank, increasing 27,547 the
number far deposited previous transcriptome studies serves a
discovery platform studies i. ricinus biochemistry physiology.
