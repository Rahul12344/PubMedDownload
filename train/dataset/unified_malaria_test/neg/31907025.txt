background: malaria remains one deadliest infectious diseases and
imposes substantial financial social costs world. mosquitoes rely on
the immune system control parasite infection. peptidoglycan recognition
proteins (pgrps), family pattern-recognition receptors (prr), are
responsible initiating regulating immune signaling pathways. pgrp-la is
involved regulation immune defense plasmodium parasite,
however, underlying mechanism needs elucidated.
methods: spatial temporal expression patterns pgrp-la anopheles
stephensi analyzed qpcr. function pgrp-la examined using a
dsrna-based rna interference strategy. western blot periodic acid schiff
(pas) staining used assess structural integrity peritrophic matrix
(pm).
results: expression pgrp-la an. stephensi induced midgut 
response rapid proliferating gut microbiota post-blood meal. knocking down
of pgrp-la led downregulation immune effectors control gut
microbiota growth. decreased expression immune genes also
facilitated p. berghei infection. however, dsla treatment influence 
the structural integrity pm. gut microbiota removed antibiotic
treatment, regulation pgrp-la immune effectors abolished the
knock pgrp-la failed increase susceptibility mosquitoes parasite
infection.
conclusions: pgrp-la regulates immune responses sensing dynamics of
gut microbiota. mutual interaction gut microbiota pgrp-la
contributes immune defense plasmodium parasites an. stephensi.
