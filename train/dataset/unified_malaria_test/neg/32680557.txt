background: accurate quantification infection intensity essential to
estimate infection patterns avian haemosporidian parasites order to
understand evolution host-parasite associations. traditional microscopy is
cost-effective requires high-quality blood smears considerable
experience, widely used semi-quantitative qpcr methods mostly
employed ideal, laboratory-based golden samples standard curves, which
may limit comparison parasitemia different laboratories.
methods: present digital droplet pcr (ddpcr) protocol absolute
quantification avian haemosporidians raptors. novel primers designed
that target conserved fragment rrna region mitochondrial genome 
the parasites. sensitivity repeatability evaluated compared qpcr 
other assays.
results: ddpcr assay enables accurate quantification haemosporidian
parasites belonging plasmodium, haemoproteus leucocytozoon minimum
infection quantities 10-5 (i.e. one parasite copy 105 host genomes) without
the use standard curves. quantities assessed ddpcr accurate 
qpcr using primers reduction non-specific amplification in
low-intensity samples. ddpcr technique consistent among technical
duplicates reactions, especially infection intensities low, and
this technique demonstrated equal sensitivity high correspondence
(r2 = 0.97) compared widely used qpcr assay. ddpcr qpcr
identified positive samples standard nested pcr protocol the
cytb gene used barcoding avian haemosporidians.
conclusions: developed novel ddpcr assay enabling accurate quantification of
avian haemosporidians without golden samples standard curves. assay can
be used robust method investigating infection patterns different
host-parasite assemblages facilitate comparison results from
different laboratories.
