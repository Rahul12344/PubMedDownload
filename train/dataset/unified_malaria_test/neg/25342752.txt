the plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1) family proteins
mediate adherence infected erythrocytes microvascular endothelia of
various organs, including placenta, thereby contributing cerebral,
placental, severe malaria pathogenesis. several parasite proteins,
including kahrp pfemp3, play important roles cytoadherence by
mediating clustering pfemp1 rigid knoblike structures infected
erythrocyte surface. lack subtelomeric region chromosome 2 that
contains kahrp pfemp3 causes reduced cytoadherence. study, microarray
transcriptome analysis showed absence gene cluster, comprising
kahrp, pfemp3, four genes, results loss parasitized
erythrocytes adhering chondroitin 4-sulfate (c4s). role one these
genes, pf3d7_0201600/pfb0080c, encodes phistb (plasmodium helical
interspersed subtelomeric b) domain-containing resa-like protein 1 expressed on
the infected erythrocyte surface, investigated. disruption pfb0080c
resulted increased var2csa transcription var2csa surface expression,
leading higher c4s-binding capacity infected erythrocytes. further,
pfb0080c-knock-out parasites stably maintained c4s adherence many
generations growth. although majority pfb0080c-knock-out parasites
bound c4s even culturing 6 months, minor population bound 
c4s cd36. results strongly suggest loss pfb0080c markedly
compromises var gene switching process, leading marked reduction 
switching rate additional pfemp1 expression minor population of
parasites. pfb0080c interacts var2csa modulates knob-associated hsp40
expression. thus, pfb0080c may regulate var2csa expression these
processes. overall, conclude pfb0080c regulates pfemp1 expression the
parasite's cytoadherence.
