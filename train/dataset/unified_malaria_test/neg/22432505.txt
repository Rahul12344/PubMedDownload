erythrocytes infected malaria parasites increased permeability to
diverse organic inorganic solutes. permeability changes been
known decades, molecular basis transport unknown intensively
debated. clag3, parasite protein previously thought function in
cytoadherence, recently implicated formation plasmodial
surface anion channel (psac), unusual small conductance ion channel that
mediates uptake solutes. consistent transport studies, clag
genes conserved plasmodia absent genera. the
encoded protein integral host membrane, also predicted by
electrophysiology. important question whether functional channels are
formed clag3 alone interactions proteins. either
case, gene identification advance understanding parasite biology
and may lead new therapeutics.
