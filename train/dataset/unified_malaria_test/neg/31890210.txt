it known positive natural selection hemoglobin c
in humans despite negative health effects, due role malaria resistance.
however, well understood, natural selection for
hemoglobin e (hbe), common variant southeast asia. therefore, we
reviewed previous studies discussed potential role natural selection
in prevalence hbe. review shows vitro studies, evolutionary
genetics studies epidemiologic studies largely support involvement of
natural selection evolution hbe protective role hbe against
malaria infection. however, evidence inconsistent, provided different
regions, insufficient perform aggregated analysis a
meta-analysis. addition, candidate gene, genome-wide association or
epistasis studies, made possible use big data 
post-genomic era, investigated hbe. biological pathways linking hbe 
malaria infection yet fully elucidated. therefore, research
is necessary concluded positive natural selection
for hbe due protection malaria. lay summary: review shows that
evidence largely supports involvement natural selection evolution of
hbe protective role hbe malaria. however, evidence not
consistent. research necessary concluded.
