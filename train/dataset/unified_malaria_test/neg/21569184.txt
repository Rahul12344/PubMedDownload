the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum infects humans first targets the
liver liver-stage parasites undergo pre-erythrocytic replication.
liver-stage antigen-1 (lsa-1) currently identified p. falciparum
protein expression restricted liver stages. yet, importance
of lsa-1 liver-stage parasite development remains unknown. deleted
lsa-1 nf54 strain p. falciparum analysed lsa-1(-) parasites
throughout life cycle. lsa-1(-) sporozoites normal gliding motility and
invasion hepatocytes. six days infection hepatocytic cell line,
lsa-1(-) parasites exhibited moderate phenotype ~50% reduction late 
liver-stage forms compared wild type. strikingly, lsa-1(-) parasites
growing scid/alb-upa mice humanized livers showed severe defect late
liver-stage differentiation exo-erythrocytic merozoite formation 7 days after
infection, time point wild-type parasites develop mature merozoites. 
the lsa-1(-) parasites also showed aberrant liver-stage expression key
parasite proteins apical membrane antigen-1 circumsporozoite protein. our
data show lsa-1 plays critical role late liver-stage schizogony and
is thus important parasite transition liver blood. lsa-1 is
the first p. falciparum protein identified required transitional
stage parasite life cycle.
