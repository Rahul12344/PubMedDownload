background: glutamate dehydrogenase malaria parasites (pgdh) widely used in
rapid diagnostic tests malaria. variation pgdh gene among korean
isolates plasmodium vivax analysed, recombinant pgdh protein was
evaluated use antigens serodiagnosis vivax malaria.
methods: genomic dna purified blood samples 20 patients pgdh 
gene p. vivax sequenced. recombinant protein prepared determine the
antigenicity pgdh enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa).
results: partial sequence analysis p. vivax pgdh gene 20 korean
isolates showed open reading frame (orf) 1410 nucleotides encoded a
deduced protein 470 amino acids. amino acid nucleotide sequences 
conserved among korean isolates. orf showed 100% homology p.
vivax strain sal-i (genbank accession no. xp_001616617.1). full orf (amino
acids 39-503), excluding region intron, cloned isolate p.
vivax bucheon 3 (kj726751) subcloned expression vector pet28b for
transformation escherichia coli bl21(de3)plyss. expressed recombinant
protein molecular mass approximately 55 kda showed 84.8% sensitivity
(39/46 cases) 97.2% specificity (35/36 cases) elisa. efficacy of
recombinant pgdh protein seroepidemiological studies also evaluated by
elisa using serum samples collected 876 inhabitants gyodong-myeon,
ganghwa county, incheon metropolitan city. samples, 91 (10.39%) showed a
positive reaction recombinant pgdh protein. among antibody-positive
individuals, 13 (14.29%) experienced malaria infection last
10 years.
conclusion: pgdh genes p. vivax isolates representative
epidemic-prone areas south korea highly conserved. therefore, pgdh is
expected useful antigen seroepidemiological studies. difficult 
to identify foci malaria transmission gyodong-myeon based the
patient distribution low parasitaemia korean vivax
malaria. however, seroepidemiology recombinant pgdh protein easily
identified regions highest incidence malaria within study area.
therefore, recombinant pgdh protein may useful role serodiagnosis.
