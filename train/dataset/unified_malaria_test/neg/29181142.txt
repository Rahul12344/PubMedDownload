background: transfusion-transmitted malaria undoubtedly potential health
hazard blood recipients. egypt still prevention reintroduction
phase malaria control program. fayoum governorate considered one the
high-risk foci egypt due geology. however, studies been
reported evaluate current status subclinical plasmodium infection based
on sensitive molecular techniques. moreover, screening malaria listed
within screening protocols blood-borne pathogens fayoum blood banks.
objective: assess current prevalence subclinical plasmodium infection
among blood donors fayoum inhabitants transfusion biosafety. predict
any possibility reemergence malaria governorate the
effectiveness malaria control measures.
methods: cross-sectional survey conducted 400 apparently healthy
blood-donors blood transfusion center fayoum university hospital jun
2012 jan 2013. conventional pcr used detect 18 ssrrna plasmodium 
gene.
results: fayoum inhabitants' blood donors' samples negative for
plasmodium infection.
conclusions: current applied control, preventive measures valid the
context blood transfusion biosafety fayoum blood banks and, therefore, 
implementation routine malaria screening test fayoum blood banks not
