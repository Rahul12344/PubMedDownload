background: transmission-blocking vaccine (tbv) promising strategy for
interrupting malaria transmission cycle. current tbv candidates include 
pre- post-fertilization antigens expressed sexual development the
malaria parasites.
methods: tested whether tbv design combining two sexual-stage antigens has
better transmission-blocking activity. using rodent malaria model plasmodium 
yoelii, pursued dna vaccination strategy genes encoding gametocyte 
antigen pys48/45 major ookinete surface protein pys25.
results: immunization mice dna constructs expression either pys48/45 or
pys25 elicited strong antibody responses, specifically recognized ~45 and
~25Â kda protein gametocyte ookinete lysates, respectively. immune sera
from mice immunized dna constructs expressing pys48/45 pys25
individually combination displayed evident transmission-blocking activity 
in vitro ookinete culture direct mosquito feeding experiments. both
assays, pys25 sera higher transmission-blocking activity the
pys48/45 sera. intriguingly, compared immunization individual
dna vaccines, immunization dna constructs produced lower antibody
responses individual antigens. resultant immune sera the
composite vaccination significantly lower transmission-blocking activity than
those pys25 dna immunization group, albeit activity substantially
higher pys48 dna vaccination group.
conclusions: result suggested vaccination two dna constructs
did achieve synergistic effect, rather caused interference inducing 
antigen-specific antibody responses. result important implications for
future design composite vaccines targeting different sexual antigens.
