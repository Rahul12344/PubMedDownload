two vaccines based plasmodium falciparum protein var2csa currently in
clinical evaluation prevent placental malaria (pm), deeper understanding
of var2csa variability could impact vaccine design. identified atypical
extended truncated var2csa extracellular structures confirmed one extended
structure malian maternal isolate, using novel protein fragment assembly
method rna-seq dna-seq data. extended structures included one two
additional dbl domains downstream conventional nts-dbl1x-6ɛ domain
structure, closest similarity dblɛ var2csa non-var2csa genes.
overall, 4/82 isolates displayed atypical var2csa structures. maternal
isolate expressing extended var2csa bound csa, recombinant var2csa 
bound less well csa var2csanf54 showed lower reactivity naturally 
acquired parity-dependent antibody. protein fragment sequence assembly
approach revealed atypical var2csa domain architectures impact antigen
reactivity function, inform design var2csa-based vaccines.
