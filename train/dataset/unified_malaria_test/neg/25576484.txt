human-infecting microbial pathogens face serious problem elimination 
the host immune response. antigenic variation effective immune evasion
mechanism pathogen regularly switches major surface antigen. in
many cases, major surface antigen encoded genes gene
family, expression strictly monoallelic. among pathogens undergo 
antigenic variation, trypanosoma brucei (a kinetoplastid), causes human
african trypanosomiasis, plasmodium falciparum (an apicomplexan), causes
malaria, pneumocystis jirovecii (a fungus), causes pneumonia, borrelia 
burgdorferi (a bacterium), causes lyme disease, also express major
surface antigens loci next telomere. except plasmodium, dna
recombination-mediated gene conversion major pathway surface antigen
switching pathogens. last decade, sophisticated molecular
and genetic tools developed t. brucei, knowledge of
functions dna recombination antigenic variation greatly advanced. 
vsg major surface antigen t. brucei. subtelomeric vsg expression
sites (ess), vsg genes invariably flanked long stretch upstream 70-bp
repeats. recent studies shown dna double-strand breaks (dsbs),
particularly 70-bp repeats active es, natural potent
trigger antigenic variation t. brucei. addition, telomere proteins 
influence vsg switching reducing dsb amount subtelomeric regions. these
findings summarized implications discussed this
review.
