the rotary nanomotor atp synthase central player bioenergetics of
most organisms. yet role atp synthase malaria parasites remained
unclear, blood stages plasmodium falciparum appear derive atp largely
through glycolysis. also, genes essential subunits f(o) sector 
complex could detected parasite genomes. here, used
molecular genetic immunological tools investigate localization,
complex formation, functional significance predicted atp synthase subunits
in p. falciparum. generated transgenic p. falciparum lines expressing seven
epitope-tagged canonical atp synthase subunits, revealing localization but
one subunits mitochondrion. blue native gel electrophoresis p.
falciparum mitochondrial membranes suggested molecular mass atp
synthase complex greater 1 million daltons. size consistent
with complex assembled dimer manner similar complexes 
observed eukaryotic organisms. observation also suggests the
presence previously unknown subunits addition canonical subunits 
p. falciparum atp synthase complex. attempts disrupt genes encoding β 
γ subunits unsuccessful, suggesting essential role played atp
synthase complex blood stages p. falciparum. studies suggest that,
despite unconventional features minimal contribution atp
synthesis, p. falciparum atp synthase localized parasite mitochondrion,
assembled large dimeric complex, likely essential parasite
survival.
