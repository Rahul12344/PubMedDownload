extracellular vesicles (evs) released cells contain complex mixture 
of proteins, genetic information lipids. evs mediate cell:cell communication 
by transferring molecular cargo cells. evs, initially discovered in
mammalian systems, demonstrated play critical role immunology and
cancer biology. recently, evs identified broad range 
unicellular multicellular parasites. review focus emerging 
roles evs parasitic infections. parasite-derived evs transfer
virulence factors drug-resistance markers, modify host cell gene expression
and promote parasite adherence host cell proliferation. evs also suppress
or stimulate host immune responses. thus, evs likely important determining
the outcome parasitic infections.
