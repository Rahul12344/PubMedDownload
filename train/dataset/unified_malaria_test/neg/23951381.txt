background: wolbachia infections confer protection insect hosts against
a range pathogens including bacteria, viruses, nematodes malaria
parasite. single mechanism might explain broad-based pathogen
protection immune priming, presence symbiont upregulates
the basal immune response, preparing insect defend subsequent
pathogen infection. study compared natural wolbachia infections in
drosophila melanogaster mosquito vector aedes aegypti artificially
transinfected strains suggested innate immune priming may 
only occur recent host-wolbachia associations. study also revealed
that immune priming may play role viral protection cannot explain
the entirety effect.
methodology/findings: assess whether level innate immune priming
induced different wolbachia strains a. aegypti correlated the
degree protection conferred bacterial pathogens. show that
wolbachia strains wmel wmelpop, currently tested field release 
dengue biocontrol, differ protective abilities. wmelpop strain
provides stronger, broad-based protection wmel, likely
explained higher induction immune gene expression the
strain-specific activation particular genes. also show wolbachia
densities decline pathogen infection, likely result the
immune induction.
conclusions/significance: work shows correlation innate immune
priming bacterial protection phenotypes. ability toll pathway,
melanisation antimicrobial peptides enhance viral protection provide
the basis malaria protection explored context this
two-strain comparison. work raises questions whether wolbachia may
improve ability wild mosquitoes survive pathogen infection alter the
natural composition gut flora, thus broader consequences host
fitness.
