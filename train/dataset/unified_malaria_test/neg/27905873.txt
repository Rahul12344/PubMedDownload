background: entomopathogenic fungi beauveria bassiana promising
biological agents control malaria mosquitoes. indeed, infection b.
bassiana reduces lifespan mosquitoes laboratory field.
natural isolates b. bassiana show 10-fold differences virulence
between least virulent isolate. study, sequenced 
genomes five isolates representing extremes low/high virulence and
three rna libraries, applied genome comparison approach uncover genetic 
mechanisms underpinning virulence.
results: high-quality, near-complete genome assembly achieved the
highly virulent isolate bb8028, compared assemblies four 
other isolates. whole genome analysis showed high level genetic diversity
between five isolates (2.85-16.8 snps/kb), grouped two distinct
phylogenetic clusters. mating type gene analysis revealed presence either 
the mat1-1-1 mat1-2-1 gene. moreover, putative new mat gene (mat1-2-8)
was detected mat1-2 locus. comparative genome analysis revealed that
bb8028 contains 163 genes exclusive isolate. unique genes a
tendency cluster genome often located near telomeres.
among genes unique bb8028 non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (nrps)
secondary metabolite gene cluster, polyketide synthase (pks) gene, five
genes homology bacterial toxins. survey candidate virulence genes
for b. bassiana presented.
conclusions: results indicate several genes molecular processes may 
underpin virulence towards mosquitoes. thus, genome sequences five
isolates b. bassiana provide better understanding natural variation
in virulence offer major resource future research this
important biological control agent.
