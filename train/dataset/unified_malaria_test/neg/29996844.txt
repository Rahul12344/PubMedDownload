background: artemisinin resistance plasmodium falciparum emerged and
spread southeast asia. areas resistance established longer courses
of artemisinin-based combination therapy improved cure rates.
methods: standard 3-day course artemether-lumefantrine (al) compared
with extended 5-day regimen treatment uncomplicated falciparum
malaria kayin state south-east myanmar, area emerging artemisinin
resistance. late parasite clearance dynamics described microscopy and
quantitative ultra-sensitive pcr. patients followed 42 days.
results: 154 patients recruited (105 adults 49 children < 14 years) 78
were randomized 3 days 76 5 days al. mutations p. falciparum
kelch13 propeller gene (k13) found 46% (70/152) infections, f446i
the prevalent propeller mutation (29%; 20/70). regimens were
well-tolerated. parasite clearance profiles biphasic slower
submicroscopic phase similar k13 wild-type mutant infections.
the cure rates 100% (70/70) 97% (68/70) 3- 5-day arms
respectively. genotyping two recurrences unsuccessful.
conclusion: despite high prevalence k13 mutations, current first-line
treatment, al, still highly effective area south-east myanmar. the
extended 5 day regimen well tolerated, would option prolong
the useful therapeutic life al. trial registration nct02020330. registered 24
