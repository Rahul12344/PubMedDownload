objective: clone gametocyte specific protein pfgdv1 plasmodium
falciparum, express identify recombinant pfgdvl protein vitro.
methods: pcr performed amplify pfgdv1 p. falciparum dna got
from patient infected p. falciparum, pcr product was
inserted pet28a (+) vector. pet28a-pfgdv1 recombinant plasmid was
constructed transformed e. coli host bl21 (de3+). iptg used to
induce recombinant pfgdv1 protein fused tag, protein was
purified his-nta affinity chromatography. recombinant protein was
identified sds-page western blotting.
results: pcr product pfgdv1 gene 1.65 kb, meeting the
expectation predicted fragment size. recombinant protein 67 kda,
which could recognized his-tag monoclonal antibody.
conclusion: pfgdv1 gene p. falciparum successfully cloned, the
recombinant pfgdv1 protein expressed, thereby providing opportunity for
further study transmission blocking vaccine.
