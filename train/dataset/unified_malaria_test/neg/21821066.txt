polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (pnkp) bifunctional enzyme can
phosphorylate 5'-oh termini dephosphorylate 3'-phosphate termini of
dna. dna repair enzyme involved processing strand break
termini, permits subsequent repair proteins replace missing nucleotides 
and rejoin broken strands. little known dna repair plasmodium
falciparum, including roles pnkp repairing parasite dna. identified 
a p. falciparum gene encoding protein 24% homology human pnkp thus 
suggestive putative pnkp. study, pnkp gene p. falciparum
strain k1 (pfpnkp) successfully cloned expressed e. coli a
gst-pfpnkp recombinant protein. maldi-tof/tof analysis protein confirmed
the identity pfpnkp. assays enzymatic activity carried a
variety single- double-stranded substrates. although 3'-phosphatase
activity detected, pfpnkp observed dephosphorylate single-stranded
substrates double-stranded substrates short 3'-single-stranded
overhang, double-stranded substrates mimicked single-strand breaks. 
we hypothesize unlike human pnkp, pfpnkp may involved in
single-strand break repair, since alternative terminal processing mechanisms 
substitute pfpnkp, pfpnkp dna repair actions may confined to
overhanging termini double-strand breaks.
