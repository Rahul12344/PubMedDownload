a interesting exception within parasitic apicomplexa nephromyces, 
extracellular, probably mutualistic, endosymbiont found living inside molgulid
ascidian tunicates (i.e., sea squirts). even though nephromyces known to
be apicomplexan, many questions nature remain unanswered. to
gain insights biology evolutionary history unusual
apicomplexan, aimed 1) find precise phylogenetic position of
nephromyces within apicomplexa, 2) search apicoplast genome of
nephromyces, 3) infer major metabolic pathways apicoplast of
nephromyces. this, sequenced metagenome metatranscriptome from
the molgulid renal sac, specialized habitat nephromyces thrives. our
phylogenetic analyses conserved nucleus-encoded genes robustly suggest that
nephromyces novel lineage sister hematozoa, comprises 
haemosporidia (e.g., plasmodium) piroplasmida (e.g., babesia and
theileria). furthermore, survey renal sac metagenome revealed 13 small
contigs closely resemble genomes nonphotosynthetic reduced
plastids, apicoplasts, apicomplexans. show apicoplast
genomes correspond diverse set closely related genetically
divergent nephromyces lineages co-inhabit single tunicate host. in
addition, apicoplast nephromyces appears retained biosynthetic
pathways inferred ancestral parasitic apicomplexans. results 
shed light evolutionary history probably mutualistic
apicomplexan known, nephromyces, provide context better understanding
of life style intricate symbiosis.
