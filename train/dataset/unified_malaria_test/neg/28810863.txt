background: phylum apicomplexa includes intracellular parasites causing
immense global disease burden, deadliest human malaria
parasite plasmodium falciparum, invades replicates within erythrocytes.
the cytoskeletal protein actin well conserved within apicomplexans but
divergent mammalian actins, primarily reported function during
host cell invasion. however, novel invasion mechanisms described for
several apicomplexans, specific functions acto-myosin system being
reinvestigated. two actin genes p. falciparum, actin-1 (pfact1) is
ubiquitously expressed life-cycle stages thought required for
erythrocyte invasion, although functions parasite development are
unknown, definitive vivo characterisation invasion lacking.
results: used conditional cre-lox system investigate the
functions pfact1 p. falciparum blood-stage development host cell
invasion. demonstrate pfact1 crucially required segregation the
plastid-like organelle, apicoplast, efficient daughter cell
separation final stages cytokinesis. surprisingly, observe 
egress host cell actin-dependent process. finally, show
that parasites lacking pfact1 capable microneme secretion, attachment 
formation junction erythrocyte, incapable host cell
invasion.
conclusions: study provides important mechanistic insights the
definitive essential functions pfact1 p. falciparum, 
biological interest, owing functional divergence mammalian actins,
could also form basis development novel therapeutics against
apicomplexans.
