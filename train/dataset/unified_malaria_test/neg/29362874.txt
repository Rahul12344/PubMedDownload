the human mn blood group antigens isoforms glycophorin (gpa) encoded 
the gene, gypa, abundant erythrocyte sialoglycoproteins. the
distribution mn antigens widely studied human populations yet 
evolutionary and/or demographic factors affecting population variation remain
elusive. primary function gpa yet discovered, serves 
the major binding site 175-kd erythrocyte-binding antigen (eb-175) the
malarial parasite, plasmodium falciparum, major selective pressure recent
human history. specifically, exon two gypa encodes receptor-binding
ligand p. falciparum binds. accordingly, keen interest in
understanding impact, any, natural selection distribution 
of variation gypa exon two particular. end, resequenced gypa
in individuals sampled p. falciparum endemic (sub-saharan africa and
south india) non-endemic (europe east asia) regions world.
observed patterns variation suggest gypa subject balancing
selection populations living malaria endemic areas europeans, no
such evidence found samples east asia, oceania, americas.
these results consistent malaria acting selective pressure gypa,
but also suggest another selective force resulted similar pattern
of variation europeans. accordingly, gypa perhaps complex
evolutionary history, wherein global scale, spatially varying selective
pressures governed natural history.
