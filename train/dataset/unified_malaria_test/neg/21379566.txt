plasmodium yoelii ym asexual blood stage parasites express multiple members of
the py235 gene family, part super-family genes including coding
for plasmodium vivax reticulocyte binding proteins plasmodium falciparum rh
proteins. previously identified py235 erythrocyte binding protein
(py235ebp-1, encoded py01365 gene) recognized protective mab
25.77. proteins recognized second protective mab 25.37 identified 
by mass spectrometry encoded two genes, py01185 py05995/py03534.
we deleted py01365 gene examined phenotype. expression the
members py235 family wt gene deletion parasites was
measured quantitative rt-pcr rna-seq. py235ebp-1 expression was
undetectable knockout parasite, transcription members 
family essentially unaffected. knockout parasites continued react with
mab 25.77; 25.77-binding proteins parasites py01185 and
py05995/py03534 products. py01185 product also identified erythrocyte 
binding. clear change erythrocyte invasion profile suggesting
that py01185 gene product (designated py235ebp-2) able fulfill role
of ebp-1 serving invasion ligand although molecular details its
interaction erythrocytes examined. py01365, py01185, and
py05995/py03534 genes part distinct subset py235 family. p.
falciparum, rh protein genes epigenetic control expression
correlates binding distinct erythrocyte receptors specific invasion
pathways, whereas p. yoelii ym genes expressed deletion one
does result upregulation another. propose simultaneous
expression multiple py235 ligands enables invasion wide range host
erythrocytes even presence antibodies one proteins
and functional redundancy protein level gives parasite
phenotypic plasticity absence differences gene expression.
