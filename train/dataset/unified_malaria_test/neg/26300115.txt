the simultaneous typing five-hla loci high resolution availability 
of pedigree data allowed us characterize extended five-locus phased haplotypes
in 124 nigerian families compare observed frequencies those
expected expectation-maximization algorithm unphased data. despite 
occurrence frequent alleles locus (e.g. b*53:01, assumed
to protect plasmodium falciparum), many 82% sampled
individuals carry two unique five-locus haplotypes three extended
haplotypes frequency 1% exhibit significant linkage disequilibrium.
although preliminary, results reveal extreme level hla diversity in
the nigerian population, reflects multi-ethnic composition the
very ancient demographic history african populations.
