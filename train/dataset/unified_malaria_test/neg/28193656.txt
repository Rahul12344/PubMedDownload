the evolutionary selection malaria parasites within individual host plays a
critical role emergence drug resistance. compared selection
of atovaquone resistance mutants mouse models reflecting two different causes 
of failure malaria treatment, inadequate subtherapeutic dose an
incomplete therapeutic dose. two models based cycles insufficient
treatment plasmodium berghei-infected mice: repeated inadequate treatment
associated subtherapeutic dose (riat) (0.1 mg kg-1 body weight) and
repeated incomplete treatment therapeutic dose (rict) (14.4 mg kg-1 of
body weight). number treatment cycles development stable
resistance phenotype riat 2.00 ± 0.00 cycles (n = 9), not
statistically different rict (2.57 ± 0.85 cycles; combined n =
14; p = 0.0591). mutations underlying atovaquone resistance selected riat 
(m133i, t142n, l144s) found qo1 (quinone binding 1) domain 
of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, contrast selected rict
(y268n/c, l271v, k272r, v284f) qo2 domain neighboring sixth
transmembrane region. exposure mixed populations resistant parasites from
riat higher therapeutic dose rict revealed insights the
dynamics within-host selection resistance antimalarial drugs. these
results suggest inadequate subtherapeutic doses incomplete
therapeutic doses malaria treatment pose similar threats emergence of
drug resistance. rict riat could developed useful tools predict 
potential emergence resistance newly introduced less-understood
antimalarials.
