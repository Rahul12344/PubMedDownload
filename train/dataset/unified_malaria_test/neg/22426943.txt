the global spread drug-resistant parasites serious problem the
treatment malaria. although identifying drug-resistance genes crucial for
the efforts resistant parasites, effective approach yet been
developed. here, report robust method identifying resistance genes 
parasites using plasmodium artificial chromosome (pac). large genomic dna
fragments (10-50 kb) drug-resistant rodent malaria parasite plasmodium
berghei ligated pac directly introduced drug-sensitive
(i.e., wild-type) parasite electroporation, resulting pac library that
encompassed whole genomic sequence parasite. subsequently, the
transformed parasites acquired resistance selected screening with
the drug, resistance gene pac successfully identified.
furthermore, drug-resistance gene identified pac library 
made pyrimethamine-resistant parasite plasmodium chabaudi, further
demonstrating utility method. method promote the
identification resistance genes contribute global fight against
drug-resistant parasites.
