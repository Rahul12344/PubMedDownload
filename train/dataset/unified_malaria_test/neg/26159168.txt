background: plasmodium vivax second prevalent human malaria parasite 
in bangladesh; however, data genetic diversity. several
molecular markers available pvcsp, pvmsp 1 pvmsp 3α most
commonly used p. vivax genotyping studies. aim study to
investigate population structure p. vivax bangladesh.
methods: total 102 p. vivax-positive blood samples collected from
different malaria-endemic areas bangladesh subsequently analysed those
three genotyping markers. nested pcr performed diagnosis genotyping
analysis followed pcr-rflp detect genetic diversity using pvcsp, pvmsp 1
and pvmsp 3α markers.
results: analysis pvcsp showed vk210 repeat type highly prevalent
(64.7%, 66/102) compared vk247 (35.3%, 36/102), although prevalence of
vk247 higher southeast asian countries. analysis three
genes revealed diverse, circulating population p. vivax total of
ten, 56 35 distinct genotypes detected pvcsp, pvmsp 1 pvmsp 3α, 
respectively.
conclusion: genotyping observation p. vivax first report from
bangladesh provide valuable information establishing genotyping 
methods circulating genetic variants three markers available in
bangladesh.
