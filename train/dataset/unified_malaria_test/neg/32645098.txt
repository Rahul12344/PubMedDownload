plasmodium vivax widespread difficult treat cause human
malaria. development vaccines blood stages p. vivax remains
a key objective control elimination vivax malaria. erythrocyte
binding-like (ebl) protein family members duffy binding protein (pvdbp)
are critical importance erythrocyte invasion major target
for vivax malaria vaccine development. study, focus another member 
of ebl protein family, p. vivax erythrocyte binding protein (pvebp). pvebp was
first identified cambodian (c127) field isolates subsequently been
showed preferences binding reticulocytes directly inhibited by
antibodies. analysed pvebp sequence 316 vivax clinical isolates from
eight countries including china (n = 4), ethiopia (n = 24), malaysia (n = 53),
myanmar (n = 10), papua new guinea (n = 16), republic korea (n = 10), thailand
(n = 174), vietnam (n = 25). pvebp gene exhibited four different phenotypic
clusters based insertion/deletion (indels) variation. pvebp-rii (179-479
aa.) showed highest polymorphism similar ebl family proteins various 
plasmodium species. whereas even though pvebp-riii-v (480-690 aa.) most
conserved domain, showed strong neutral selection pressure gene
purifying significant population expansion. antigenicity of
pvebp-rii (16.1%) pvebp-riii-v (21.5%) domains comparatively lower 
other p. vivax antigen expected antigens associated merozoite
invasion. total igg recognition level pvebp-rii stronger pvebp-riii-v
domain, whereas total igg inducing level stronger pvebp-riii-v domain.
these results suggest pvebp-rii mainly recognized natural igg for
innate protection, whereas pvebp-riii-v stimulates igg production activity by
b-cell acquired immunity. overall, low antigenicity regions in
patients vivax malaria likely reflects genetic polymorphism strong
positive selection pvebp-rii purifying selection pvebp-riii-v domain.
these observations pose challenging questions selection ebp point
out importance immune pressure polymorphism required inclusion 
pvebp vaccine candidate.
