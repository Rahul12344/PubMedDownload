can predict rise spread resistance multi-drug therapy 
predictable manner? raise question analyzing 500 plasmodium
vivax isolates collected different, geographically isolated regions china
for sequence variation around dhfr dhps genes. find: that
resistance lineages arisen least region; appears 
to little movement parasite populations areas; and
that highly resistant parasites contain dhfr dhps alleles linkage
disequilibrium. show direct relationship linkage disequilibrium
and parasite's fitness absence drug pressure. fitness would
increase spread drug resistant phenotypes thus selectable trait. 
these conclusions raise questions appropriate use drug
combinations prevent treat infection.
