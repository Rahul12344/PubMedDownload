plasmodium sporozoites infective forms parasite mammalian
hepatocytes. sporozoite surface secreted proteins likely play important
role recognition, invasion successful establishment hepatocyte
infection. approaches reverse genetics, report functional analysis
of two plasmodium berghei (pb) sporozoite specific genes- pbs10 pbs23/ssp3
that encode proteins putative signal peptide. expression both
genes high oocyst salivary gland sporozoite stages compared to
other life cycle stages pbs23/ssp3 protein detected salivary gland
sporozoites. mutants indistinguishable wild-type parasites with
regard asexual growth rbc, ability complete sexual reproduction form
sporozoites vector host. sporozoite stage mutants able 
to glide invade hepatocytes normally vitro vivo, pbs10 mutants
suffered growth attenuation early stage pbs23/ssp3 mutants manifested
defect late exo-erythrocytic form maturation. interestingly, mutants 
gave rare breakthrough infections, suggesting critical for
liver stage development, depletion completely abrogate blood stage 
infection. findings important implications weakening sporozoites
by multiple gene attenuation towards generation safe whole organism
vaccine.
