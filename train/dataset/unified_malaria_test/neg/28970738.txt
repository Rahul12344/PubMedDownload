cd14 multifunctional receptor expressed many cell types been
shown mediate immune response resulting activation inflammatory
cascade, polymorphism promoter (rs2569190) found associated
with susceptibility several diseases. malaria infection, cd14 gene
demonstrated pathogenic profile regulating experimental cerebral malaria,
with reports elevated levels soluble cd14 serum patients no
definitive conclusion. present detailed analysis genetic diversity of
cd14 promoter gene (snp -159 c/t; rs2519190) polymorphism a
malaria-infected group uninfected controls association clinical 
parameters disease. genomic dna samples obtained 106 plasmodium
falciparum malaria-infected patients 277 uninfected controls elucidated 
with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) 
assay. results show significant diversity (p = 3.32e-06) genotypic
frequency (3.8% versus 22.4%) rs2569190 mutant variant the
malaria-infected group controls, respectively. mutant allele the
lowest frequency among malaria-infected group demonstrating necessity for
infection. mean parasitemia (parasites/μl blood) significantly regulated
based cd14 polymorphic profile (19 855 versus 37 041 versus 49 396 for
homozygote mutants, heterozygotes, homozygote wild type, respectively).
interestingly, found association cd14 genetic variants fever, 
age patients, anemia. affects disease severity subregional
and continental groups deserves clarification, including extending 
studies larger group among severe asymptomatic patients with
malaria.
