background: malaria important mosquito-borne disease considered one of
the public health concerns across many countries. anopheles mosquitoes the
main vectors plasmodium parasites, cause malaria. vectors 
such anopheles maculipennis s.l. anopheles sacharovi considered as
complex sibling species distributed north iran.
methods: study conducted north northwest iran including east
azerbaijan, west azerbaijan, ardabil, golestan north khorasan provinces 
emphasis northern borders country 2015-2016. adult specimens
were collected subjected morphological identification well molecular
analysis.
results: overall, 10405 mosquitoes collected comprising 21 species. culex
pipiens cx. theileri found frequent species whole study
area. morphological identification showed 1455 female anopheles
specimens, 77% belonged an. maculipennis group. identified species,
its2 region coi gene sequences 8 an. maculipennis s.s. 31 an.
sacharovi representing provinces obtained submitted genbank. 
coi sequences an. sacharovi revealed presence 9 haplotypes with
similarity 98.17-100%.
conclusion: investigations reported an. martinius member of
sibling species an. sacharovi among iranian anopheles genus; based on
our study, evidence presence species north and
northwest iran.
