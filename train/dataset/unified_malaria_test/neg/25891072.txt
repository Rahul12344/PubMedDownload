malaria parasite resides within host red blood cells, degrades vast 
amount haemoglobin. haemoglobin degradation, toxic free heme is
liberated subsequently gets converted hemozoin. process is
facilitated action various proteins viz. heme detoxification protein (hdp),
and histidine rich proteins ii iii (hrp ii & iii). these, hdp the
most potent hemozoin formation plays indispensible role parasite
survival. despite this, detailed study hdp rodent simian parasite
has performed till date. here, cloned sequenced hdp gene
from different malaria parasites plasmodium vinckei, plasmodium yoelii,
plasmodium knowlesi, plasmodium cynomolgi. furthermore, hdp p. vinckei
(pvhdp) over-expressed purified detailed characterization. pvhdp 
is cytosolic, expressed throughout intra erythrocytic stages its
expression higher late trophozoite schizont stages parasite. the
pvhdp interacts free heme (kd=89 nm) efficiently converts heme into
hemozoin time concentration dependent manner. moreover, pvhdp showed
activity acidic ph broad range temperature. histidine
modification pvhdp using depc showed reduction heme binding hemozoin
formation, thus emphasizing importance histidine residues heme binding 
and subsequent hemozoin production. furthermore, applicability pvhdp screen
anti-plasmodial agents (targeting heme hemozoin conversion) also
determined using chloroquine, mefloquine reference antimalarials. results 
showed drugs inhibit heme polymerization effectively a
concentration dependent manner. conclusion, study identified and
biochemically characterized hdp rodent malaria parasite p. vinckei 
will help develop high throughput assay evaluate new antimalarials
targeting hemozoin pathway.
