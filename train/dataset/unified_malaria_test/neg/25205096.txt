erythrocyte invasion essential step pathogenesis malaria. the
erythrocyte binding-like (ebl) family plasmodium falciparum proteins
recognizes glycophorins (gp) erythrocytes plays critical role in
attachment invasion. however, molecular basis specific receptor
recognition parasite ligand remained elusive, case the
ligand/receptor pair p. falciparum eba-175 (pfeba-175)/gpa. due largely
to difficulties producing properly glycosylated functional receptors.
here, developed expression system produce recombinant glycosylated and
functional gpa, well mutations truncations. identified essential
binding region determinants pfeba-175 engagement, demonstrated these
determinants required inhibition parasite growth, identified
the glycans important mediating pfeba-175-gpa interaction. results
suggest pfeba-175 engages multiple glycans gpa encoded exon 3 that
the presentation glycans likely required high-avidity binding. the
absence exon 3 gpb gpe due splice site mutation confers specific
recognition gpa pfeba-175. speculate gpb gpe may arisen
due selective pressure lose pfeba-175 binding site gpa. the
expression system described wider application examining ebl
members important parasite invasion, well additional pathogens that
recognize glycophorins. ability define critical binding determinants in
receptor-ligand interactions, well system genetically manipulate
glycosylated receptors, opens new avenues design interventions that
disrupt parasite invasion.importance: plasmodium falciparum uses distinct ligands
that bind host cell receptors invasion red blood cells (rbcs) during
malaria infection. key entry pathway involves p. falciparum eba-175 (pfeba-175)
recognizing glycophorin (gpa) rbcs. despite knowledge this
protein-protein interaction, complete mechanism specific receptor
engagement known. pfeba-175 recognizes gpa unable engage the
related rbc receptor gpb gpe. understanding necessary elements enable
pfeba-175 specifically recognize gpa critical developing specific and
potent inhibitors pfeba-175 disrupt host cell invasion aid malaria
control. here, describe novel system produce manipulate host
receptor gpa. using system, probed elements gpa necessary for
engagement thus host cell invasion. studies important
implications understanding ligands receptors interact the
future development malaria interventions.
