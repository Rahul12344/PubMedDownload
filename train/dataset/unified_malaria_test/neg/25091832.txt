plasmodium parasite utilizes superoxide dismutase family proteins limit the
toxicity reactive oxygen species, produced hemoglobin
degradation. proteins play important role parasite survival during
intra-erythrocytic phase. identified, biochemically characterized a
putative iron dependent superoxide dismutase rodent malaria parasite
plasmodium vinckei (pvsod1). recombinant pvsod1 protein purified to
homogeneity combination affinity gel filtration chromatography. 
crosslinking, native-page fplc gel filtration analyses documented pvsod1
exists dimer solution, common feature shared fe-sods. pvsod1
is cytosolic localization expression comparatively higher during
trophozoite compared ring schizont stages. enzymatic activity
of recombinant pvsod1 validated using conventional zymogram analyses and
xanthine-xanthine oxidase system. optimal conditions, pvsod1 highly
active catalyzed dismutation superoxide radicals. furthermore, pvsod1 
showed activity broad range ph temperature. inhibition studies
suggested pvsod1 inactivated hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite,
but cyanide azide. since, pvsod1 plays central role oxidative
defense mechanism, therefore, characterization pvsod1 exploited the
screening new superoxide dismutase inhibitors antimalarial activity.
