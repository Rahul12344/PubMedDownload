background: plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (ies) adhere host cell
receptors, allowing parasites sequester deep vascular beds various
organs. defining phenomenon malaria pathogenesis key severe
clinical complications associated cerebral placental malaria. the
principal ligand associated binding chondroitin sulfate (csa) 
allows placental sequestration ies p. falciparum erythrocyte membrane
protein 1 (pfemp1) family member encoded var2csa gene.
methods: here, investigated transcription pattern var genes by
real-time polymerase chain reaction, expression var2csa, protein flow
cytometry, csa-binding ability ies collected different stages of
pregnancy using static-based petri dish assay.
results: comparison profiles isolates nonpregnant hosts,
we report several lines evidence showing parasites infecting women during
pregnancy preferentially express var2csa protein, selection the
capacity adhere csa via var2csa expression occurs early pregnancy.
conclusions: data suggest placental tropism p. falciparum is
already established first trimester pregnancy, consequent
implications development pathology associated placental
malaria.
