background: widely used approach next-generation sequencing projects 
alignment reads reference genome. despite methodological hardware
improvements enhanced efficiency accuracy alignments, a
significant percentage reads frequently remain unmapped. usually, unmapped
reads discarded analysis process, significant biological
information insights uncovered data. explored the
unmapped dna (normal bisulfite treated) rna sequence reads great
tit (parus major) reference genome individual. unmapped reads we
generated de novo assemblies, generated sequence contigs were
aligned ncbi non-redundant nucleotide database using blast, identifying
the closest known matching sequence.
results: many aligned contigs showed sequence similarity different bird
species genes absent great tit reference assembly.
furthermore, also contigs represented known p. major pathogenic
species. interesting several species blood parasites as
plasmodium trypanosoma.
conclusions: analyses revealed meaningful biological information 
found exploring unmapped reads. instance, possible to
discover sequences either absent misassembled reference
genome, sequences indicate infection sample contamination. this
study also propose strategies aid capture interpretation this
information unmapped reads.
