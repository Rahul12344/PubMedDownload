background: host identification essential step studies the
transmission dynamics vector-borne disease. nowadays, molecular tools allow
the identification vertebrate hosts species level. however, the
proportion successful identifications variable may affected the
quality samples laboratory protocols. here, effect two of
these factors, namely digestion status mosquito blood meal dna
extraction procedure, success host identification amplification 
sequencing fragment cytochrome oxidase 1 gene tested.
methods: mosquitoes collected outdoors indoors 2012 southern
spain identified species level blood meal digestion status
recorded using sella score, visual estimation digestion status of
mosquito blood meals. mosquito assigned randomly one two dna
extraction procedures: quick cheap hotshot procedure qiagen dneasy
blood tissue(®) kit hosts identified molecular method.
results: three hundred forty-seven blood-fed mosquitoes belonging to
anopheles atroparvus (n=171), culex perexiguus (n=84), culex pipiens (n=43),
culex theileri (n=39), culex modestus (n=5), ochlerotatus caspius (n=4), culiseta
sp. (n=1) included study. overall, hosts identified 234
blood meals compromising least 25 species including mammals, birds a
single reptile. success host identification lower mosquitoes with
an advanced stage blood meal digestion blood meals extracted using the
hotshot procedure.
conclusions: success host identification decreases advanced stage
of mosquito blood meal digestion, 84.5% recent blood meals 25.0% 
more digested ones. using qiagen kit, identification success improved 
17.6%, larger increases advanced stages blood meal digestion.
availability blood-fed females used limited studies vector
ecology, results may help increase efficiency blood meal
analyses. addition, results obtained study clearly support the
potential malaria vector an. atroparvus feeds animals located outdoors use
human-made shelters resting feeding.
