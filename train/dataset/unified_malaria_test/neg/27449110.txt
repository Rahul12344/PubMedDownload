background: anti-malarial drugs major focus prevention and
treatment malaria. artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) who
recommended first-line treatment plasmodium falciparum malaria across the
endemic world. also act increasingly relied upon treating plasmodium vivax 
malaria chloroquine failing. emergence artemisinin drug-resistant
parasites serious threat faced global malaria control programmes.
therefore, success treatment intervention strategies highly pegged 
on understanding genetic basis resistance.
methods: here, resistance p. falciparum generated vitro artemisinin
to produce levels clinically relevant concentrations vivo, the
molecular haplotypes investigated. genomic dna extracted using qiaamp
mini dna kit. dna sequences pfk13, pfcrt pfmdr1 genes amplified by
pcr amplicons successfully sequenced. single nucleotide
polymorphisms traced standard bidirectional sequencing reading the
transcripts wild-type sequences codon code aligner version 5.1 and
ncbi blast.
results: exposure parasite strains d6 w2 artemisinin resulted a
decrease parasite susceptibility artemisinin (w2 d6) lumefantrine
(d6 only). parasites exhibited elevated ic50s multiple artemisinins, 
>twofold resistance artemisinin; however, resistance index obtained with
standard methods noticeably less expected parasite lines recovered
from 50 µg/ml 48 h drug pressure. change parasite susceptibility was
associated pfmdr-185k mutation, mutation never reported before. the
pfcrt-cvmnk genotype (pfcrt codons 72-76) retained notably, study did
not detect polymorphisms reported reduce p. falciparum susceptibility in
vivo coding sequences pfk13 gene.
discussion: data demonstrate p. falciparum capacity develop 
resistance artemisinin derivatives vitro phenotype is
achieved mutations pfmdr1, genetic changes also underpinning
lumefantrine resistance. finding practical importance, because
artemisinin drugs kenya used combination lumefantrine the
treatment malaria.
conclusion: artemisinin resistance phenotype shown work, a
decrease parasites susceptibility artemisinin derivatives together the
parasite's ability recover drug-induced dormancy exposure drug
dosage vivo clinical concentrations. study surmises pfmdr1 
may play role anti-malarial activity artemisinin.
