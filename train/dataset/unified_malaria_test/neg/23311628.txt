background: plasmodium vivax prevalent malarial species accounting 70%
of malaria burden pakistan; however, baseline data the
circulating genotypes. studies shown polymorphic loci gene encoding 
antigens pvcsp pvmsp1 used reliably conducting molecular
epidemiological studies. therefore, study aimed bridge existing
knowledge gap population structure p. vivax pakistan using two
polymorphic genes.
methods: period january 2008 may 2009, total 250 blood samples
were collected patients tested slide positive p. vivax, aga khan 
university hospital, karachi, collection units located baluchistan 
sindh province. nested pcr/rflp performed, using pvcsp pvmsp1 markers 
detect extent genetic diversity clinical isolates p. vivax from
southern pakistan.
results: total 227/250 (91%) isolates included analysis while
the remainder excluded due negative pcr outcome p.vivax. pvcsp
analysis showed vk 210 (85.5%, 194/227) vk 247 type (14.5%, 33/227)
were found circulating p. vivax isolates southern pakistan. total
of sixteen eighty-seven genotypes pvcsp pvmsp-1 detected
respectively.
conclusion: first report southern pakistan characterization
of p. vivax isolates confirming extensively diverse pvcsp pvmsp1
variants present within region. results study provide valuable
data genetic diversity p. vivax helpful further
epidemiological studies.
