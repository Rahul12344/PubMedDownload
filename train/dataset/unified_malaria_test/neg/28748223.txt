two decades first plasmodium transfection, attempts made to
disrupt 3,151 genes malaria parasites, across five plasmodium
species. results rodent malaria transfections curated and
systematised, empowering large-scale analysis, phenotypic data human malaria
parasite transfections currently exists individual reports scattered across 
the literature. facilitate systematic analysis published experimental
genetic data across plasmodium species, built phenoplasm (
http://www.phenoplasm.org), database phenotypes generated transfection
experiments plasmodium parasites. site provides simple interface
linking citation-backed plasmodium reverse-genetic phenotypes gene ids. the
database populated phenotypic data 367 p. falciparum genes,
curated 176 individual publications, well existing data rodent
plasmodium species rmgmdb plasmogem. first time all
available data p. falciparum transfection experiments brought
together single place. data presented using ortholog mapping to
allow researcher interested gene one species see results across
other plasmodium species. collaborative nature database enables any
researcher add new phenotypes discovered. example of
database utility, use currently available datasets identify rap
(rna-binding domain abundant apicomplexa)-domain containing proteins as
crucial parasite survival.
