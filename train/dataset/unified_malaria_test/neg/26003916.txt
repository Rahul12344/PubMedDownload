renal function essential maintain homeostasis. particularly
significant insects undergo complete metamorphosis; larval mosquitoes
must survive freshwater habitat whereas adults terrestrial, mature
females must maintain ion fluid homeostasis blood feeding. to
investigate physiological adaptations required successful development 
adulthood, studied malpighian tubule transcriptome anopheles gambiae
using affymetrix arrays. assessed transcription several conditions; as
third instar larvae, adult males fed sugar, adult females fed sugar, 
and adult females blood meal. addition providing detailed 
transcriptomic data date anopheles malpighian tubules, data provide
unique information renal adaptations required switch from
freshwater terrestrial habitats, gender differences, contrast
between nectar-feeding haematophagy. found clear differences associated
with ontogenetic change lifestyle, gender diet, particularly the
neuropeptide receptors control fluid secretion, water ion
transporters impact volume composition. data also combined
with transcriptomics drosophila melanogaster tubule, allowing
meta-analysis genes underpin tubule function across diptera. to
further investigate renal conservation across species selected four d.
melanogaster genes orthologues highly enriched anopheles tubules, and
generated rnai knockdown flies. three genes proved essential, showing
conservation critical functions across 150 million years phylogenetic
separation. extensive data-set available online resource,
moztubules.org, could potentially mined novel insecticide targets that
can impact critical organ pest species.
