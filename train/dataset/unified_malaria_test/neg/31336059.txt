transmission-blocking vaccines (tbvs) target sexual stages malarial
parasites interrupt reduce transmission cycle one of
approaches control malaria. pvs25 pvs28 leading candidate antigens
of tbvs vivax malaria. study, genetic diversity natural
selection two tbv candidate genes plasmodium vivax myanmar isolates
were analyzed. 62 myanmar p. vivax isolates showed 9 19 different
haplotypes pvs25 pvs28, respectively. nucleotide diversity pvs28
was slightly higher pvs25, significant. amino acid
substitutions observed myanmar pvs25 pvs28 concentrated egf-2 
and egf-3 like domains. major amino acid changes found myanmar pvs25 pvs28
were similar reported global population, novel amino acid
substitutions also identified. negative selection predicted myanmar
pvs25, whereas pvs28 positive selection. comparative analysis global
pvs25 pvs28 suggests substantial geographical difference asian 
and american/african pvs25 pvs28. geographical genetic differentiation
and evidence natural selection global pvs25 pvs28 suggest the
functional consequences observed polymorphism need considered for
the development effective tbvs based antigens.
