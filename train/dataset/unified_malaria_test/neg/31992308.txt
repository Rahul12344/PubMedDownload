background: molecular genotyping plasmodium serves many aims including
providing tools studying parasite population genetics distinguishing
recrudescence reinfection. microsatellite typing, insertion-deletion (indel)
and single nucleotide polymorphisms used genotyping, limited
information available plasmodium malariae, important human malaria
species. study aimed provide set genetic markers facilitate the
study p. malariae population genetics.
methods: markers microsatellite genotyping pmmsp1 gene polymorphisms were
developed validated symptomatic p. malariae field isolates myanmar
(n = 37). fragment analysis used determine allele sizes locus to
calculate multiplicity infections (moi), linkage disequilibrium,
heterozygosity construct dendrograms. nucleotide diversity (π), number of
haplotypes, genetic diversity (hd) assessed phylogenetic tree 
constructed. genome-wide microsatellite maps annotated regions newly
identified markers constructed.
results: six microsatellite markers developed tested 37 p. malariae
isolates showed sufficient heterozygosity (0.530-0.922), absence of
linkage disequilibrium (ias=0.03, p value > 0.05) (n = 37). addition, tandem
repeat (vntr)-based pmmsp1 indel polymorphisms marker developed assessed 
in 27 p. malariae isolates showing nucleotide diversity 0.0976, haplotype
gene diversity 0.698 identified 14 unique variants. size vntr
consensus repeat unit adopted allele 27 base pairs. markers pm12_426
and pmmsp1 showed greatest diversity heterozygosity scores 0.920 and
0.835, respectively. using six microsatellites markers, likelihood any
two parasite strains would microsatellite genotypes 8.46 × 10-4
and reduced 1.66 × 10-4 pmmsp1 polymorphisms included.
conclusions: six novel microsatellites genotyping markers set pmmsp1
vntr-based indel polymorphisms markers p. malariae developed and
validated. marker could independently combination employed to
access genotyping parasite. newly developed markers may serve a
useful tool investigating parasite diversity, population genetics, molecular 
epidemiology distinguishing recrudescence reinfection drug
efficacy studies.
