vector-borne diseases, dengue, zika malaria, major cause of
morbidity mortality worldwide. diseases proven difficult to
control currently available management tools insufficient eliminate
them many regions. gene drives potential revolutionize
vector-borne disease control. suite technologies advanced rapidly 
recent years result availability new, efficient gene editing 
technologies. gene drives favorably bias inheritance linked
disease-refractory gene, could possibly exploited (i) generate a
vector population incapable transmitting disease (ii) disrupt an
essential gene viability fertility, could eventually eliminate a
population. importantly, gene drives vary characteristics their
transmission efficiency, confinability reversibility, potential 
develop resistance drive mechanism. here, discuss recent advancements
in gene drive field, contrast benefits limitations variety
of technologies, well approaches overcome limitations. also
discuss current state gene drive technology technical
considerations need addressed pathway field implementation. 
while still many obstacles overcome, recent progress brought us 
closer ever genetic-based vector modification tool support
vector-borne disease elimination efforts worldwide.
