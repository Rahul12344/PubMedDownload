mosquitoes vectors pathogens malaria, lymphatic filariasis, dengue,
chikungunya, yellow fever japanese encephalitis. culex quinquefasciatus say, 
1823 (diptera: culicidae) known vector lymphatic filariasis. control 
in brazil managed using organophosphate temephos. studies examining 
the proteins cx. quinquefasciatus differentially expressed in
response temephos understanding modes action the
insecticide may potentially identify resistance factors mosquito. in
the present study, comparative proteomic analysis, using 2-dimensional
electrophoresis coupled matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (maldi) 
time flight (tof)/tof mass spectrometry, bioinformatics analyses were
performed identify midgut proteins cx. quinquefasciatus larvae were
differentially expressed response exposure temephos relative in
untreated controls. total 91 protein spots differentially expressed; 40
were upregulated 51 downregulated temephos. total 22 proteins,
predominantly upregulated, identified known play role immune 
response, whereas downregulated proteins involved energy protein 
catabolism. first proteome study midgut cx.
quinquefasciatus provides insights molecular mechanisms of
insecticide-induced responses mosquito.
