background: successful control programs impeded local malaria transmission
in almost gulf cooperation council (gcc) countries: qatar, bahrain, kuwait,
oman, united arab emirates (uae) saudi arabia. nevertheless, prodigious
influx imported malaria via migrant workers sustains threat local
transmission. examine origin imported malaria qatar, assess
genetic diversity prevalence drug resistance genes imported
plasmodium falciparum, finally, address potential reintroduction 
of local transmission.
methods: study examined imported malaria cases reported qatar, between
2013 2016. focused p. falciparum infections estimated total
parasite gametocyte density, using qpcr qrt-pcr, respectively. also
examined ten neutral microsatellites four genes associated drug
resistance, pfmrp1, pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfkelch13, assess genetic diversity
of imported p. falciparum strains, potential propagating drug
resistance genotypes respectively.
results: majority imported malaria cases p. vivax, p.
falciparum mixed species infections (p. falciparum / p. vivax) less
frequent. primary origin p. vivax infection indian subcontinent,
while p. falciparum mostly presented african expatriates. imported p.
falciparum strains highly diverse, carrying multiple genotypes, and
infections also presented early- late-stage gametocytes. observed a
high prevalence mutations implicated drug resistance among strains,
including novel snps pfkelch13.
conclusions: influx genetically diverse p. falciparum, multiple drug 
resistance markers high capacity gametocyte production, represents a
threat reestablishment drug-resistant malaria gcc countries. this
scenario highlights impact mass international migration the
reintroduction malaria areas absent limited local transmission.
