heat shock proteins (hsps), amongst them, hsp70 hsp90 families, serve mainly 
as facilitators protein folding (molecular chaperones) cell. hsp70 
family proteins represents one important molecular chaperones in
the cell. plasmodium falciparum, main agent malaria, expresses six hsp70
isoforms. two (pfhsp70-1 pfhsp70-z) localize parasite
cytosol. phsp70-1 known occur functional complex another
chaperone, pfhsp90 via co-chaperone, p. falciparum hsp70-hsp90 organising
protein (pfhop). (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (egcg) green tea constituent
that thought possess antiplasmodial activity. however, mechanism by
which egcg exhibits antiplasmodial activity fully understood. previous
study proposed egcg binds n-terminal atpase domain hsp70. the
current study, overexpressed purified recombinant forms two p.
falciparum cytosol localized hsp70s (pfhsp70-1 pfhsp70-z), pfhop, a
co-chaperone pfhsp70-1. using surface plasmon resonance approach, we
demonstrated egcg directly binds two hsp70s. observed that
binding egcg two proteins resulted secondary tertiary
conformational changes. addition, egcg inhibited atpase chaperone
function two proteins. furthermore, egcg abrogated association two 
hsp70s functional partners. using parasites cultured vitro the
blood stages, observed 2.9 Âµm egcg suppressed 50% p. falciparum parasite 
growth (ic50). findings demonstrate egcg directly binds pfhsp70-1 and
pfhsp70-z inhibit atpase chaperone functions proteins. our
study constitutes first direct evidence suggesting antiplasmodial
activity egcg least part accounted inhibition hsp70
function.
