chloroquine (cq) highly effective p. vivax, due rapid spread of
cq resistance p. falciparum parasites; longer drug choice
against p. falciparum. study elucidates scenario chloroquine efficacy
at times coincided new drug policy especially assessed the
chloroquine resistant molecular markers withdrawal chloroquine in
kolkata purulia, two malaria endemic zones west bengal, india. in vitro cq
susceptibility tested 781 patients p. falciparum mono infections
between 2008 2013, 338 patients received cq 2008-2009.
genotyping pfcrt pfmdr1 gene carried isolates.
early treatment failure detected 114 patients {43 (31·39%) kolkata
and 71 (35·32%) purulia} recrudescence identified 13 (9.49%)
and 17 (8.46%) patients kolkata purulia respectively. in vivo
chloroquine resistance strongly associated cvmnt-yysny (p < 0.01) and
svmnt-yysny (p < 0.05) allele kolkata. purulia chloroquine resistance was
associated cvmnk-yysny (p < 0.005), svmnt-yysny (p < 0.01) allele. the
proportion in vitro chloroquine resistance increased subsequent years to
87.23% 93·10% 2013, kolkata purulia, respectively. isolates with
svmnt-yfsnd, svmnt-yfsny, cviet-yfsnd cviet-yysny haplotypes increased
gradually (p < 0.05) 2010 2013, leading rise ic50 (p < 0.05) of
chloroquine. increase in vitro chloroquine resistance candidate gene
mutations even five years chloroquine withdrawal p. falciparum
calls synchronized research surveillance proper containment strategies.
