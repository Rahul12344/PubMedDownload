hybrid drugs multi-target chimeric chemicals combining two drugs or
pharmacophores covalently linked single molecule. field of
anti-infective agents, proposed possible solution drug
resistance issues, presumably broader spectrum activity less
probability eliciting high level resistance linked single gene product.
although less frequently explored, could also useful treatment 
frequently occurring co-infections. here, overview recent advances the
field hybrid antimicrobials. furthermore, discuss cutting-edge
approaches face development designed multi-target agents era 
omics big data, namely analysis gene signatures multitask qsar models.
