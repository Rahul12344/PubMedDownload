glutathione plays central role maintaining cellular redox homeostasis, and
modulations status may affect malaria parasite sensitivity certain
types antimalarials. study, demonstrate inhibition of
glutathione biosynthesis plasmodium berghei anka strain disruption
of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-gcs) gene, encodes first and
rate-limiting enzyme glutathione biosynthetic pathway, significantly
sensitizes parasites vivo pyrimethamine sulfadoxine, to
chloroquine, artesunate, primaquine, compared control parasites
containing pyrimethamine-resistant marker cassette. treatment mice
infected antifolate-resistant p. berghei control line γ-gcs
inhibitor, buthionine sulfoximine, could partially abrogate pyrimethamine and
sulfadoxine resistance. role glutathione modulating malaria
parasite's response antifolates suggests development specific
inhibitors plasmodium γ-gcs may offer new approach counter
plasmodium antifolate resistance.
