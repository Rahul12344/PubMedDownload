hemocytes, immune cells mosquitoes, participate immune defenses against
pathogens including malaria parasites. mosquito hemocytes also infected by
arthropod-borne viruses pro- anti-viral nature interaction 
unknown. although progress hemocyte characterization during
pathogen infection mosquitoes, specific contribution hemocytes to
immune responses hemocyte-specific functions immune genes pathways
remain unresolved due lack genetic tools manipulate gene expression 
in cells specifically. here, used gal4-uas system characterize
the activity drosophila hemocyte-specific hemolectin promoter the
adults anopheles gambiae, malaria mosquito. established hml-gal4
driver line crossed fluorescent uas responder line, and
examined expression pattern adult progeny driven hml promoter. 
we show hml regulatory region drives hemocyte-specific transgene
expression subset hemocytes, transgene expression triggered
after blood meal. hml promoter drives transgene expression in
differentiating prohemocytes well differentiated granulocytes. analysis 
of different immune markers hemocytes hml promoter drives
transgene expression revealed regulatory region could used study 
phagocytosis well melanization. finally, hml promoter drives transgene 
expression hemocytes o'nyong-nyong virus replicates. altogether, 
drosophila hml promoter constitutes good tool drive transgene expression 
hemocyte analyze function cells genes they
express pathogen infection anopheles gambiae.
