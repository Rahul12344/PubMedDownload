flavonoids found synergize anti-malaria anti-cancer compounds in
artemisia annua, important economic crop china. order discover
the regulation mechanism flavonoids artemisia annua, full length cdna
of flavanone 3-hydroxylase (f3h) isolated artemisia annua first
time using race (rapid amplification cdna ends). completed open read
frame aaf3h 1095 bp encoded 364-amino acid protein a
predicted molecular mass 41.18 kda pi 5.67. recombinant protein
of aaf3h expressed e. coli bl21(de3) his-tagged protein, purified by
ni-nta agrose affinity chromatography, functionally characterized in vitro.
the results showed his-tagged protein (aaf3h) catalyzed naringenin to
dihydrokaempferol present fe(2+). km naringenin 218.03 μm. 
the optimum ph aaf3h reaction determined ph 8.5, optimum
temperature determined 35 °c. aaf3h transcripts found be
accumulated cultivar higher level flavonoids lower 
level flavonoids, implied aaf3h potential target for
regulation flavonoids biosynthesis artemisia annua metabolic
engineering.
