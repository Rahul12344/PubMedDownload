the insect-vectored disease malaria major world health problem. new control 
strategies needed supplement current use insecticides and
medications. genetic approach used inhibit development malaria
parasites (plasmodium spp.) mosquito host. hypothesized pantoea
agglomerans, bacterial symbiont anopheles mosquitoes, could engineered to
express secrete anti-plasmodium effector proteins, strategy termed
paratransgenesis. end, plasmids include pelb hlya secretion
signals genes related species (pectate lyase erwinia carotovora 
and hemolysin escherichia coli, respectively) created tested 
their efficacy secreting known anti-plasmodium effector proteins (sm1,
anti-pbs21, pla2) p. agglomerans e. coli. p. agglomerans successfully 
secreted hlya fusions anti-pbs21 pla2, strains under
evaluation anti-plasmodium activity infected mosquitoes. varied expression
and/or secretion effector proteins observed, suggesting the
individual characteristics particular effector may require empirical testing
of several secretion signals. importantly, strains secreted
efficiently grew well wild-type strains laboratory conditions and,
thus, may expected competitive native microbiota the
environment mosquito midgut.
