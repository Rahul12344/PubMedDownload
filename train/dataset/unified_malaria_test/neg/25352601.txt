heme essential cofactor aerobic organisms. redox chemistry is
central variety biological functions mediated hemoproteins. blood
stages, malaria parasites consume hemoglobin inside infected
erythrocytes, forming nontoxic hemozoin crystals large quantities heme
released digestion. time, parasites possess heme de novo
biosynthetic pathway. pathway human malaria parasite plasmodium
falciparum considered essential proposed potential drug
target. however, successfully disrupted first last genes the
pathway, individually combination. knock-out parasite lines, lacking
5-aminolevulinic acid synthase and/or ferrochelatase (fc), grew normally in
blood-stage culture exhibited changes sensitivity heme-related
antimalarial drugs. developed sensitive lc-ms/ms assay monitor stable
isotope incorporation heme precursor 5-[(13)c4]aminolevulinic acid,
and assay confirmed de novo heme synthesis ablated fc knock-out 
parasites. disrupting fc gene also caused defects gametocyte generation
or maturation resulted greater 70% reduction male gamete
formation completely prevented oocyst formation female anopheles stephensi
mosquitoes. data demonstrate heme biosynthesis pathway not
essential asexual blood-stage growth p. falciparum parasites is
required mosquito transmission. drug inhibition pathway activity is
therefore unlikely provide successful antimalarial therapy. data also
suggest existence parasite mechanism scavenging host heme meet
metabolic needs.
