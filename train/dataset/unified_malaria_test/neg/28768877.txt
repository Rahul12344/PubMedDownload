adenovirus (ad)-based immunization popular approach vaccine development, 
and ad-based vectors renowned potential induce strong cd8+ t
cell responses encoded transgene. surprisingly, previously found the
mouse friend retrovirus (fv) model ad-based immunization induce cd8+
t cell responses fv leader-gag-derived immunodominant epitope gagl85-93 we
show induction gagl85-93-specific cd8+ cells highly effective
when leader-gag delivered plasmid dna immunization, implying role for
ad-derived epitopes mediating unresponsiveness. immunizing dna
constructs encoding strings gagl85-93 two ad-derived epitopes
dna-binding protein418-426 (dbp418-426) hexon486-494, confirmed ad
epitopes prevent induction gagl85-93-specific cd8+ cells. interestingly,
while dbp418-426 interfere gagl85-93-specific cd8+ cell induction,
the h-2dd-restricted hexon486-494 suppressed cd8+ cell response the
h-2db-restricted gagl85-93 strongly h-2b/d mice h-2b/b mice. this
finding indicates competition occurs level responding cd8+ t
cells, could indeed demonstrate coimmunization interleukin 2 
(il-2)-encoding plasmid restored gagl85-93-specific cd8+ cell responses to
epitope strings presence hexon486-494 il-2 codelivery restore
gagl85-93 responsiveness ad-based immunization, however, likely due the
presence epitopes ad vector. findings show seemingly
immunodominant transgene epitopes dominated ad-derived epitopes. 
findings underline importance thorough characterization vaccine
vectors, modifications vectors immunogens may required prevent
impaired transgene-specific immune responses.importance ad-based vectors are
widely used experimental preclinical clinical immunization studies against
numerous infectious agents, human immunodeficiency virus, ebola virus,
plasmodium falciparum, mycobacterium tuberculosis preexisting immunity to
ad-based vectors widely recognized hindrance widespread use of
ad-based vectors immunizations humans; however, data show an
immune response ad-derived cell epitopes also result loss or
impairment transgene-specific immune responses prenaive vaccinees due to
immune competition. results highlight seemingly immunodominant epitopes 
may affected dominance vector-derived epitopes, modifications the
vector design immunogens employed immunization may lead more
effective vaccines.
