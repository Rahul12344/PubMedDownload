the deadliest form human malaria caused protozoan parasite
plasmodium falciparum. complex life cycle parasite associated with
tight transcriptional regulation gene expression. nuclear positioning and
chromatin dynamics may play important role regulating p. falciparum
virulence genes. applied emerging technique electron microscopy 
construct 3d model parasite nucleus distinct stages development
within infected red blood cell. followed distribution nuclear 
pores chromatin throughout intra-erythrocytic cycle, found a
striking coupling distributions nuclear pores chromatin
organization. pore dynamics involve clustering, biogenesis, division among
daughter cells, chromatin undergoes stage-dependent changes packaging.
dramatic changes heterochromatin distribution coincide previously
identified transition gene expression nucleosome positioning the
mid-to-late schizont phase. also found correlation euchromatin
positioning nuclear envelope local distribution nuclear pores, 
as well dynamic nuclear polarity schizogony. results suggest
that cyclic patterns gene expression parasite development correlate
with gross changes cellular nuclear architecture.
