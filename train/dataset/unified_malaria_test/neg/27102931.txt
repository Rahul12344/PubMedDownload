in iran, prevalence plasmodium falciparum plasmodium vivax dropped
after national malaria elimination program launched. estimate the
likelihood success measure outcome malaria intervention tools
during elimination programs (2008-2012), population genetic surveys of
iranian p. vivax isolates (n=60) carried using csp genetic marker.
the results compared similar work carried a
control phase (2000-2003) study areas. based pcr-rflp analysis, 49
(81.67%) 60 studied samples vk210 11 (18.33%) vk247 no
mixed genotypes. however, 10.97% p. vivax isolates control phase harbored
the mixed genotypes. sequencing analysis 50 pvcsp gene showed 14 distinct
haplotypes, 11 3 vk210 vk247 types, respectively. however, 
during control phase, 19 distinct subtypes (11 vk210 8 vk247) were
reported. also, 7 11 vk210 vk247f subtypes new, 3 7

the lower nucleotide diversity per site (π=0.02017±0.00436 π=0.04525±0.00255)
and haplotype diversity (hd=0.513±0.093 hd=0.691±0.128) well lower
in/del haplotype [hd(i)=0.243 0] nucleotide diversity [π(i)=0.00078 and
0] recorded vk210 vk247of elimination samples, respectively. 
conclusion, comparison prms rats crr along polymorphism
analysis sequence lengths, snps, in/del polymorphisms analyzed 
samples showed lower genetic diversity pvcsp elimination samples.
also, although turnover p. vivax parasite genotypes study
areas, reduction genetic diversity transmission detected due to
scaling-up intervention tools elimination program iran. 
notable challenge elimination program must taken account and
controlled active surveillance limiting reintroductions new
allelic forms well spread drug-resistant parasite prevent any
disease outbreaks.
