background: new classes anti-malarial drugs needed control alarming
plasmodium falciparum resistance toward current anti-malarial therapy. the
ethnopharmacological approach allows discovery original chemical
structures vegetable biodiversity. previous studies led selection
of bisbenzylisoquinoline, called cepharanthine isolated cambodian
plant: stephania rotunda. cepharanthine could exert mechanism action
different commonly used drugs. potential plasmodial targets reported
here.
methods: study mechanism action cepharanthine, combined approach
using phenotypic transcriptomic techniques undertaken.
results: cepharanthine blocked p. falciparum development ring stage. a
culture synchronized ring stage, comparisons expression profiles showed
that samples treated 5 μm cepharanthine (ic90) significantly
closer initial controls final ones. two-way anova
(p-value < 0.05) microarray results, 1,141 probes among 9,722 presented 
significant differential expression.a gene ontology analysis showed the
maurer's clefts seem particularly down-regulated cepharanthine. analysis
of metabolic pathways showed impact cell-cell interactions (cytoadherence
and rosetting), glycolysis isoprenoid pathways. organellar functions, more
particularly constituted apicoplast mitochondrion, targeted too.
conclusion: blockage ring stage cepharanthine described 
first time. transcriptomic approach confirmed cepharanthine might a
potential innovative antiplasmodial mechanism action. thus, cepharanthine
might play ongoing role progress anti-malarial drug discovery
efforts.
