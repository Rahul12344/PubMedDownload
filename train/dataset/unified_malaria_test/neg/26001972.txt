malaria still major public health problem yemen. 95% the
malaria cases due plasmodium ‎falciparum‎. recently yemen, the
antimalarial treatment policy changed chloroquine (cq) artemisinin
combination therapy (acts). however, cq still available prescribed 
yemeni market. persistence cq resistance prolonged shift to
act simultaneous withdrawal cq rigorously implemented. aim
of current survey detect chloroquine-resistant mutations p.
falciparum chloroquine-resistance transporter (pfcrt) p. falciparum
multi-drug resistance-1 (pfmdr1) genes. data important future
monitoring assessment antimalarial drug policy yemen. blood specimens
were collected 735 individuals different districts hadhramout
province, yemen house-to-house visit. mutation-specific nested polymerase
chain reaction (pcr) restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp)
methods used investigate mutations pfmdr1(codons 86 1246) 
and pfcrt (codons 76, 271, 326, 356 371) genes. overall prevalence of
pfcrt mutations codons 76, 271, 326 371 50.4%, 58.7%, 54.3% and
44.9%, respectively. isolates wild-type pfcrt 356 allele. majority of
pfmdr1 86 alleles (83.3%) pfmdr1 1246 alleles wild type. was
no association pfcrt mutations symptomatology, gender age groups.
in conclusion, point mutations codons 76, 271, 326 371 pfcrt p.
falciparum high suggesting sustained high cq resistance even 4 years 
of shifting acts. findings warrant complete withdrawal cq use from
the yemeni market p. falciparum careful usage cq treating
plasmodium vivax.
