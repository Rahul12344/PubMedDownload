background: bioko one islands exist around africa, most
genetically diverse continent planet. native bantu-speaking
inhabitants bioko, bubi, believed colonized island about
2000 years ago. here, sequenced genome thirteen bubi individuals at
high coverage analysed sequences comparison mainland populations 
from gulf guinea.
results: found that, genetically, closest mainland population bubi 
are bantu-speaking groups angola instead geographically closer groups
from cameroon. bubi possess lower proportion rainforest hunter-gatherer 
(rhg) ancestry bantu-speaking groups. however, rhg
component likely came source could reached by
gene flow mainland island settlement. studying identity by
descent (ibd) genomic blocks runs homozygosity (rohs), found evidence
for significant level genetic isolation among bubi, isolation can
be attributed island effect. additionally, population known 
have one highest malaria incidence rates world analysed their
genome malaria-resistant alleles. however, unable detect any
specific selective sweeps related disease.
conclusions: describing dispersal atlantic islands, genomic
characterization bubi contributes understanding margins of
the massive bantu migration shaped sub-saharan african populations.
