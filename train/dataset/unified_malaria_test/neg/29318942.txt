this study assesses prevalence asymptomatic plasmodium falciparum
parasitemia positivity p. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr)
mutations parasite isolates among pregnant women southwest nigeria.
plasmodium falciparum parasitemia confirmed microscopy nested pcr in
200 pregnant women attending antenatal care. prevalence pfdhfr
polymorphisms determined direct sequencing gene fragments
containing c50r, n51i, c59r, s108n, i164l mutations. information the
use antimalarial drugs methods applied prevent malaria obtained by
a questionnaire. prevalence asymptomatic p. falciparum infection 30%
(60/200). frequency pfdhfr triple-mutant alleles (n51i, c59r, and
s108n) 63% (38/60); none isolates carried i164l mutation. among
the investigated pregnant women, 40% used un-prescribed antimalarials as
dihydroartemisinin (18%), chloroquine (14%) pyrimethamine (9%), only
20.5% used sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine prevention 39.5% use any
drug. prevalence p. falciparum parasitemia (37%) higher among pregnant
women taken antimalarial drugs. significant difference the
prevalence pfdhfr triple-mutant alleles observed among women who
took sp (90%) compared take drug (82%) women who
took dihydroartemisinin (67%) p = 0.007). poor adherence world health
organisation (who) strategies malaria prevention among pregnant women was
observed in addition high prevalence pfdhfr mutations. findings
underline need improve control malaria among pregnant women the
study area.
