the extent populations experiencing shared selective pressures adapt
through shared genetic response relevant many questions evolutionary
biology. article, explore standing genetic variation contributes
to convergent genetic responses geographically spread population.
geographically limited dispersal slows spread selected allele, hence 
allowing alleles spread one comes dominate population.
when selectively equivalent alleles meet, progress substantially slowed,
dividing species range random tessellation, well
understood analogy poisson process model crystallization. this
framework, derive geographic scale allele dominates 
proportion adaptive alleles arise standing variation. finally, we
explore negative pleiotropic effects alleles bias subset of
alleles contribute species' adaptive response. apply results
to malaria-resistance glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficiency alleles,
where large mutational target size makes likely candidate adaptation
from deleterious standing variation. results suggest convergent
adaptation may common. therefore, caution must exercised arguing 
strongly geographically restricted alleles outcome local adaptation.
we close discussing implications results ideas species
