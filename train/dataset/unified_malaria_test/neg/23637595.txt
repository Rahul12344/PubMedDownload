translational control gene expression plays essential role development. 
in malaria parasites, translational regulation critical development
of specialized transition stages vertebrate host mosquito vector.
here show pumilio/fbf (puf) family rna-binding protein, pfpuf2, is
required translation repression number transcripts gametocytes
including two genes encoding transmission-blocking vaccine candidates pfs25
and pfs28. whereas studies date support paradigm puf-mediated translation
regulation 3' untranslated regions (utrs) target mrnas, study,
for first time, identifies functional puf-binding element (pbe) the
5'utr pfs25. provide vitro vivo evidence demonstrate that
pfpuf2 binds pbes pfs25 pfs28 mediate translation repression.
this finding provides renewed view pufs versatile translation regulators 
and sheds light functions development lower branches of
eukaryotes.
