as resistance artemisinins (current frontline drugs malaria treatment)
emerges southeast asia, urgent need identify genetic
determinants understand molecular mechanisms underpinning such
resistance. insights could lead prospective interventions contain
resistance prevent eventual spread regions malaria is
endemic. reduced susceptibility artemisinin southeast asia been
primarily linked mutations plasmodium falciparum kelch-13 gene, which
is currently widely recognized molecular marker artemisinin resistance.
however, two mutations ubiquitin hydrolase, ubp-1, previously
associated reduced artemisinin susceptibility rodent model malaria, 
and cases ubp-1 mutation variants associated artemisinin treatment
failure reported africa sea. study, employed
crispr-cas9 genome editing preemptive drug pressures test these
artemisinin susceptibility-associated mutations ubp-1 plasmodium berghei
sensitive lines vivo using approaches, show v2721f ubp-1
mutation results reduced artemisinin susceptibility, v2752f mutation
results resistance chloroquine (cq) moderately impacts tolerance to
artemisinins. genetic reversal v2752f mutation restored chloroquine
sensitivity mutant lines, whereas simultaneous introduction both
mutations could achieved appears lethal. interestingly, these
mutations carry detrimental growth defect, would possibly explain their
lack expansion natural infection settings. work provides independent
experimental evidence role ubp-1 modulating parasite responses to
artemisinin chloroquine vivo conditions.
