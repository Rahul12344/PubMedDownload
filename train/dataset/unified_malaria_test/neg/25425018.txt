background: eukaryotic cellular machineries intricately regulated several 
molecular mechanisms involving transcriptional control, post-translational
control post-translational modifications proteins (ptms). reversible
protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation process, involves kinases well
as phosphatases, represents important regulatory mechanism diverse
pathways systems organisms including human malaria parasite,
plasmodium falciparum. earlier analysis p. falciparum protein-phosphatome
revealed presence 34 phosphatases plasmodium genome. recently, we
re-analysed p. falciparum phosphatome aimed identifying parasite specific
phosphatases.
results: plasmodium database (plasmodb 9.2) search, combined pfam cdd
searches, revealed 67 candidate phosphatases p. falciparum. number 
is far less number phosphatases present homo sapiens, almost
the plasmodium species. plasmodium phosphatase proteins
were classified 13 super families based ncbi cdd search. analysis of
proteins expression profiles 67 phosphatases revealed 44 phosphatases
are expressed schizont well gametocytes stages. fourteen
phosphatases common schizont, ring trophozoite stages, four
phosphatases restricted gametocytes, whereas another three restricted to
schizont stage. phylogenetic trees known phosphatase super
families reveal considerable phylogenetic closeness amongst apicomplexan
organisms considerable phylogenetic distance eukaryotic model
organisms included study. go assignments predicted interaction
partners parasite phosphatases indicate important role diverse
cellular processes.
conclusion: study presented here, reviewed p. falciparum
phosphatome show presence 67 candidate phosphatases p. falciparum
genomes/proteomes. intriguingly, amongst phosphatases, could identify
six plasmodium specific phosphatases 33 putative phosphatases not
have human orthologs, thereby suggesting phosphatases the
potential explored novel antimalarial drug targets.
