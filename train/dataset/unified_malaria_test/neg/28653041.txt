background: published studies plasmodium falciparum genotypes in
peripheral, placental umbilical cord blood areas characterised unstable
malaria transmission.
method: cross-sectional study conducted investigate p. falciparum
genotypes matched peripheral, placental umbilical cord blood eastern
sudan. thick blood smears p. falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1)
and 2 (msp2) genes polymorphic markers polymerase chain reactions were
investigated 3 kinds samples 153 pregnant women delivery.
results: significant difference prevalence blood
film-detected p. falciparum 5 (3.3%), 7 (4.6%) 3 (2.0%) (p = 0.437) 
of 153 samples determined p. falciparum-positive microscopy for
maternal peripheral, placental cord blood samples, respectively. these
145 samples, 24 (16.6%), 39 (26.9%) 24 (16.6%) (p = 0.039) peripheral,
placental cord samples, respectively, submicroscopic parasitaemia (blood 
films negative). association submicroscopic
parasitaemia age parity. ro33 k1 (msp1 alleles) detected 21/29
(72.4%), 42/46 (85.7%), 26/27 (92.2%) 6/29 (20.6), 16/46 (32.6) 0(0) (p <
0.001) maternal, placental cord samples, respectively. mad20 not
detected samples. 3d7/ic1 allele detected 12
(41.3%), 30 (65.2%) 4 (14.8%) (p < 0.001) peripheral, placental and
cord samples, respectively, fc (msp2) allele detected 6
(20.6) placental samples. multi-clonal infection detected 10 (34.4), 27
(58.6) 3 (11.1) (p < 0.001) maternal placental cord samples,
respectively.
conclusion: compared peripheral cord samples, placental samples 
a higher prevalence submicroscopic parasitaemia. msp1 alleles predominant
in cord, msp2 alleles predominant placental samples, 
had significant higher multiplicity infection.
