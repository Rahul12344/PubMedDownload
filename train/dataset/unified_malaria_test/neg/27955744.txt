objective: apply lectin affinity chromatography glycoproteomics-based
lc-ms/ms preliminarily investigate possible potential plasma biomarkers of
opisthorchis viverrini (ov)-associated cca ov/dimethylnitrosamine
(dmn)-induced cca hamster model.
methods: nine syrian hamsters divided 3 groups follows (n = 3 each):
normal (healthy control group); ov group; ov/dmn group (cca group). pooled
plasma samples collected animals group 6th month
post-infection ov metacercarae subjected glycoproteomics analysis.
glycoproteins pooled sample group initially isolated by
concanavalin (cona)-based affinity chromatography. expression of
glycoproteins isolated enrichment methods determined using lc-ms/ms.
results: among 24 cona-binding glycoproteins isolated, two proteins, n-myc
downstream regulated gene 1 (ndrg1) fetuin-b (fetub) found up-regulated 
only samples ov control groups, ov/dmn (cca)
groups. hand, one protein, i.e., nsfl1 cofactor p47 isoform ×3
(nsfl1c) found samples ov/dmn (cca) control groups, 
not ov group. remaining 21 proteins upregulated samples
from groups.
conclusions: ndrg1, fetub nsfl1c glycoproteins isolated cona-based
affinity chromatography could potential biomarkers cca. plasma samples
with negative ndrg1 fetub proteins positive nsfl1c likely 
be ov-associated cca. nevertheless, conclusion remains confirmed
whether battery test discriminate ov-associated cca risk
factors.
