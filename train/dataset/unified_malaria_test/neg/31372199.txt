introduction: beta-thalassemia one prevalent inherited blood
diseases among iranians. aim study elucidate chromosomal
background beta-thalassemia mutations esfahan province, iran. materials and
methods: study, investigated three frequent mutations (c.315+1g>a,
c.93-21g>a c.92+5g>c β-globin gene, frequency rflp haplotypes, 
ld markers β-globin gene cluster) 150 beta-thalassemia patients and
50 healthy individuals. molecular population genetic investigations 
performed rflp markers hindiii c.315+1g>a gγ (hindiiig) aγ
(hindiiia) genes, avaii c.315+1g>a β-globin gene bamhi 3' the
β-globin gene. statistical analyses performed using power marker
software sisa server. results: fifty percent beta-thalasemia patients were
associated mutations. haplotype prevalent haplotype
among beta-thalassemia patients (39.33%) normal individuals (46%). the
commonest c.315+1g>a mutation population tightly linked haplotype
iii (43.75%) haplotype (31.25%). second prevalent mutation, c.92+5g>c, 
was 90%, 6.66%, 3.33% linkage disequilibrium haplotypes i, vii, and
iii, respectively. c.93-21g>a mutation indicated strong association with
haplotype (80%). conclusion: study participants like beta-thalassemia
patients kermanshah province found possess similar haplotype
background common mutations. emergence prevalent mutations on
chromosomes different haplotypes explained gene conversion and
recombination. high linkage mutation specific haplotype consistent
with hypothesis chromosomes carrying beta-thalassemia mutations
experienced positive selection pressure, probably protection
against malaria experienced beta-thalassemia carriers.
