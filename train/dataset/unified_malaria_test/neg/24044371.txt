background: plasmodium falciparum shares recent common ancestor with
parasites found african apes; species constitute so-called laverania
clade. investigation, evolutionary history plasmodium lineages
found chimpanzees (pan troglodytes) explored.
methods: here, remainders 74 blood samples collected part the
chimpanzees' routine health examinations studied. positive samples
with parasite lineages belonging laverania clade, complete
mitochondrial genome (mtdna), gene encoding dihydrofolate
reductase-thymidylate synthase (dhfr-ts), chloroquine resistance transporter 
(pfcrt), circumsporozoite protein (csp), merozoite surface protein 2 (msp2), 
and dbl-1 domain var2csa amplified, cloned, sequenced. other
plasmodium species included mtdna, dhfr-ts, csp analyses.
phylogenetic evolutionary genetic analyses performed, including
molecular clock analyses mtdna.
results/conclusions: nine chimpanzees malaria positive (12.2%); four of
those infections identified p. falciparum, two plasmodium
reichenowi-like parasite plasmodium sp., one plasmodium gaboni, two 
plasmodium malariae. p. falciparum isolates resistant chloroquine
indicating chimpanzees acquired infections humans recent
times. findings, however, sufficient implicating chimpanzees 
an animal reservoir p. falciparum.timing estimates support laverania
clade co-existed hominids long-period time. proposed
species p. gaboni, plasmodium billbrayi, plasmodium billcollinsi are
monophyletic groups supporting indeed different species.an expanded
csp phylogeny presented, including laverania species other
malarial parasites. contrasting plasmodium, laverania csp exhibits
great conservation central tandem repeat region. msp2 var2csa,
however, show extended recent polymorphism p. falciparum likely
originated p. reichenowi-p. falciparum split. accumulation 
diversity may indicate adaptation human host. examples support the
notion comparative approaches among p. falciparum related species
will great value understanding evolution proteins are
important parasite invasion human red blood cell, well those
involved malaria pathogenesis.
