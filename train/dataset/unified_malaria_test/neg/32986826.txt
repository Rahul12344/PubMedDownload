guenons (tribe cercopithecini) widely distributed non-human primate 
in tropical forest belt africa show considerable phenotypic,
taxonomic, ecological diversity. however, genomic information most
species within group still lacking. here, present high-quality de
novo genome (total 2.90 gb, contig n50 equal 22.7 mb) mona monkey
(cercopithecus mona), together genome resequencing data 13 individuals
sampled across nigeria. results showed differentiation populations
from east west niger river ∼84 thousands years ago potential
ancient introgression east population mona group species. the
ptprk, fras1, bnc2, edn3 genes related pigmentation displayed signals of
introgression east population. genomic scans suggest immunity genes
such akt3 il13 (possibly involved simian immunodeficiency virus
defense), g6pd, gene involved malaria resistance, positive
natural selection. study gives insights differentiation, natural
selection introgression guenons.
