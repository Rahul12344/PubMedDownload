patatin-like phospholipases (pnplas) highly conserved enzymes prokaryotic 
and eukaryotic organisms major roles lipid homeostasis. genome the
malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum encodes four putative pnplas with
predicted functions phospholipid degradation. investigated the
role one plasmodial pnplas, putative pla2 termed pnpla1, blood
stage replication gametocyte development. pnpla1 present asexual
and sexual blood stages localizes cytoplasm. pnpla1-deficiency
due gene disruption conditional gene-knockdown effect on
intraerythrocytic growth, gametocyte development gametogenesis. however,
parasites lacking pnpla1 impaired gametocyte induction, pnpla1
overexpression promotes gametocyte formation. loss pnpla1 leads to
transcriptional down-regulation genes related gametocytogenesis, including 
the gene encoding sexual commitment regulator ap2-g. additionally, lipidomics
of pnpla1-deficient asexual blood stage parasites revealed overall increased
levels major phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine (pc), a
substrate pla2 . pc synthesis known pivotal erythrocytic
replication, reduced availability pc precursors drives parasite 
into gametocytogenesis; thus hypothesize higher pc levels due to
pnpla1-deficiency prevent blood stage parasites entering sexual
pathway.
