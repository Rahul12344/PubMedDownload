the cytochrome p450 monooxygenase (p450) enzyme system major mechanism of
xenobiotic biotransformation. nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
(nadph)-cytochrome p450 reductase (cpr) required transfer electrons
from nadph p450. one cpr gene identified genome the
malaria-transmitting mosquito anopheles stephensi liston (diptera: culicidae).
the gene encodes polypeptide containing highly conserved flavin
mononucleotide-, flavin adenine dinucleotide-, nadph-binding domains, a
unique characteristic reductase. phylogenetic analysis revealed the
a. stephensi known mosquito cprs belong monophyletic group
distinctly separated insects order, diptera. amino acid
residues cprs involved binding p450 cytochrome c conserved
between a. stephensi norway rat rattus norvegicus berkenhout (rodentia:
muridae). however, gene structure particularly within coding region is
evidently different two organisms. difference might arise during
the evolution process also seen difference p450 families and
isoforms found organisms. cpr mosquito a. stephensi expected
to active serve essential component p450 system.
