background: agricultural pesticides may play profound role selection of
resistance field populations mosquito vectors. objective study 
is investigate possible links agricultural pesticide use and
development resistance insecticides major malaria vector anopheles
arabiensis northern sudan.
methodology/principal findings: entomological surveys conducted two
agricultural seasons six urban peri-urban sites khartoum state.
agro-sociological data collected 240 farmers subjected to
semi-structured questionnaires based knowledge attitude practice (kap)
surveys. susceptibility status an. arabiensis (n=6000) assessed all
sites season using bioassay tests ddt, deltamethrin,
permethrin, malathion bendiocarb. kap analysis revealed pesticide
application common practice among urban peri-urban farmers, with
organophosphates carbamates commonly used. selection resistance is
likely greater peri-urban sites farmers apply pesticide more
frequently less likely dispose surpluses correctly. though variable
among insecticides seasons, broad-spectrum mortality slightly, but
significantly higher urban peri-urban sites marked for
bendiocarb, susceptibility lowest. anopheles arabiensis all
sites showed evidence resistance suspected resistance, especially
pyrethroids. however, low-moderate frequencies l1014f kdr allele all
sites, strongly associated ddt, permethrin deltamethrin
survivorship (or=6.14-14.67) suggests resistance could increase rapidly.
conclusions: ubiquitous multiple-resistance coupled presence clear
mechanism ddt pyrethroids (kdr l1014f) populations an. arabiensis
from khartoum-sudan suggests careful insecticide management essential to
prolong efficacy. findings consistent agricultural insecticide use
as source selection resistance argue coordination the
integrated vector control program ministry agriculture permit
successful implementation rational resistance management strategies.
