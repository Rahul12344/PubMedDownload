background: known decade plasmodium falciparum
proteins enriched non-globular domains unknown function. potential 
for regions protein sequence undergo high levels genetic drift
provides fundamental challenge attempts identify molecular basis of
adaptive change malaria parasites.
results: evolutionary comparisons undertaken using set forty p.
falciparum metabolic enzyme genes, within hominid malaria clade (p.
reichenowi) across genus (p. chabaudi). genes contained coding
elements highly conserved across genus, also large number of
regions weakly non-aligning coding sequence. displayed remarkable
levels non-synonymous fixed differences within hominid malaria clade
indicating near complete release purifying selection (dn/ds ratio at
residues non-aligning across genus: 0.64, dn/ds ratio residues identical
across genus: 0.03). regions low conservation also possessed high levels of
hydrophilicity, marker non-globularity. propensity regions to
act potent sources non-synonymous genetic drift within extant p. falciparum
isolates confirmed chromosomal regions containing genes known mediate
drug resistance field isolates, 150 153 amino acid variants were
located poorly conserved regions. contrast, 22 amino acid variants
associated drug resistance restricted highly conserved regions.
additional mutations associated laboratory-selected drug resistance, as
those pfatpase4 selected spiroindolone, similarly restricted while
mutations another calcium atpase (pfserca, gene proposed mediate
artemisinin resistance) reach significant frequencies field isolates were
located exclusively poorly conserved regions consistent genetic drift.
conclusion: coding sequences malaria parasites contain prospectively definable
domains subject neutral nearly neutral evolution scale appears
unrivalled biology. distinct evolutionary landscape potential to
confound analytical methods developed genera. tide of
genetic drift, polymorphisms mediating functional change stand an
extent evolutionary context provides useful signal identifying the
molecular basis drug resistance malaria parasites, finding of
relevance genome-wide candidate gene studies genus.
