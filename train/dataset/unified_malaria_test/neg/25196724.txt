background: streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) world's foremost
microbial pathogen, killing people year hiv, tb malaria. the
capacity penetrate deeper host tissues contributes substantially the
ability organism cause disease. investigated, first
time, functional genomics modulation 3 pneumococcal strains (serotype 2 [d39],
serotype 4 [wch43] serotype 6a [wch16]) transition the
nasopharynx lungs blood brain mice promoter domain
activation levels.
results: found 7 highly activated transcription factors (tfs) [argr, cody,
hup, rpod, rr02, scrr smrc] capable binding large number of
up-regulated genes, potentially constituting regulatory backbone of
pneumococcal pathogenesis. strain d39 showed distinct profile employing a
large number tfs blood infection. interestingly, highly
activated tfs used d39 blood also used wch16 wch43 brain 
infection. indicates different pneumococcal strains might activate a
similar set tfs regulatory elements depending final site of
infection. hierarchical clustering analysis showed highly activated 
tfs, except rpod, clustered together high level similarity 3
strains, might suggest redundancy regulatory roles tfs
during infection. discriminant function analysis tfs various niches
highlights differential regulatory backgrounds 3 strains, pathogenesis
data confirms cody significant predictor discriminating these
strains various niches, particularly blood. moreover, predicted tf 
and domain activation profiles 3 strains correspond distinct
pathogenicity characteristics.
conclusions: findings suggest pneumococcus changes short binding
sites promoter regions genes niche-specific manner enhance 
ability disseminate one host niche another. study provides a
framework improved understanding dynamics pneumococcal
pathogenesis, opens new avenue similar investigations other
pathogenic bacteria.
