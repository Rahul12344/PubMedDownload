in present study, 100 samples different sizes common sea bream fish
pagrus pagrus collected egyptian water along gulf suez, red 
sea examined prevalence myxosporidian parasites general and
kudoa spp. particular. fish samples thoroughly externally examined. after
dissection, internal organs removed examined. total 60 
of 100 fish specimens found infected kudoa stages. parasitic
infection restricted heart muscles examined fish. none the
other organs found infected. macroscopic cysts (plasmodia) heavily
infested different parts heart muscles. plasmodium measured
1.2-2.5 (1.53 ± 0.2) mm × 0.63-0.80 (0.65 ± 0.2) mm. mature spores quadratic 
in shape apical view showing four equal valves four symmetrical polar 
capsules. fresh spores 5.0-7.1 (5.7 ± 0.2) μm long × 5.4-8.5 (6.1 ± 0.3) μm 
wide. basis spore morphology, present species identified as
kudoa pagrusi. morphometric characterization revealed relatively small
size kudoa species distinctive feature separates all
previously described species. molecular analysis based small subunit ribosomal
dna (ssu rdna) sequences revealed highest percentage identity was
observed k. scomberomori followed k. shiomitsui, k.
hypoepicarclialis, k. amamiensis, k. kenti. kudoid spores showed
morphometric variations extents essentially identical nucleotide 
sequences ssu rdna gene sequences closest k. scomberomori 
k. shiomitsui recorded elasmobranchs indo-pacific ocean. present 
findings support identification ancestral marine origin present 
kudoa species.
