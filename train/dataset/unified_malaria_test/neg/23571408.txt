a critical stage malaria transmission occurs anopheles mosquito midgut,
when malaria parasite, plasmodium, ingested blood, first makes contact
with gut epithelial surface. understand response mechanisms within the
midgut environment, including influenced resident microbiota against
plasmodium, focus midgut bacteria species' intra-specific variation 
confers diversity mosquito's competency malaria transmission. serratia
marcescens isolated either laboratory-reared mosquitoes wild populations 
in burkina faso shows great phenotypic variation cellular structural
features. importantly, variation directly correlated ability 
inhibit plasmodium development within mosquito midgut. furthermore, this
anti-plasmodium function conferred serratia marcescens requires increased
expression flagellum biosynthetic pathway modulated the
motility master regulatory operon, flhdc. findings point new strategies 
for controlling malaria genetic manipulation midgut bacteria within
the mosquito.
