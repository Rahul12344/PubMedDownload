proliferative cell nuclear antigen (pcna) processivity factor various 
dna polymerases functions response dna damage eukaryotic system. 
plasmodium falciparum contains two pcnas, pcna1 attributed dna 
replication, role pcna2 assigned dna damage response in
erythrocytic developmental stages. although recent transposon mediated knockout
strategy qualified pcna2 nonessential gene plasmodium berghei, a
conventional homologous recombination-based knockout strategy been
employed gene yet. moreover, cellular dynamics pcna2 in
extraerythrocytic stages still remain elusive plasmodium. attempted
multiple times knock pbpcna2 parasite genome using homologous
recombination strategy without much success. however, able generate
pbpcna2-gfp tagged transgenic parasites confirming pcna2 locus is
amenable genetic manipulation. gfp-tagged parasites showed similar growth 
phenotype, compared wild-type parasites, erythrocytic sporogonic
cycle, suggesting tagging effect parasite physiology. pbpcna2
expression also observed sporogonic cycle midgut oocyst and
salivary gland sporozoites. pbpcna2 expression upregulated the
presence dna damaging agents like hydroxyurea methyl methanesulphonate.
our inability knock pcna2 suggested essentiality parasite
development elevated expression dna damaging condition hint a
critical role protein parasite physiology. © 2019 iubmb life,
