background: plasmodium vivax prevalent malaria species pakistan,
with distribution coincides plasmodium falciparum many parts of
the country. species likely exposed drug pressure number of
anti-malarials including chloroquine, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp), and
artemisinin combination therapy, yet little known regarding effects of
drug pressure parasite genes associated drug resistance. aims this
study determine prevalence polymorphisms sp
resistance-associated genes pvdhfr, pvdhps chloroquine resistance-associated 
gene pvmdr1 p. vivax isolates collected across country.
methods: 2011, 801 microscopically confirmed malaria-parasite positive filter 
paper blood samples collected 14 sites representing four provinces and
the capital city islamabad. species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr)
was used identify human plasmodium species infection. pcr-positive p. vivax
isolates subjected sequencing pvdhfr, pvdhps pvmdr1 to
real-time pcr analysis assess pvmdr1 copy number variation.
results: 801 samples, 536 determined p. vivax, 128 p.
falciparum, 43 mixed vivax/falciparum infections 94 pcr-negative
for plasmodium infection. pcr-positive p. vivax samples, 372 selected for
sequence analysis. seventy-six isolates (23%) double mutant at
positions s58r s117n pvdhfr. additionally, two mutations positions n50i
and s93h observed 55 (15%) 24 (7%) samples, respectively. three 18
base pair insertion-deletions (indels) observed pvdhfr, two
insertions different nucleotide positions 36 isolates deletions 10. 
ninety-two percent samples contained pvdhps (s382/a383g/k512/a553/v585)
sakav wild type haplotype. pvmdr1, isolates wild type position
y976f 335 (98%) carried mutation codon f1076l. isolates harboured 
single copies pvmdr1 gene.
conclusions: prevalence mutations associated sp resistance p.
vivax low pakistan. high prevalence p. vivax mutant pvmdr1 codon
f1076l indicates efficacy chloroquine plus primaquine could danger 
of compromised, studies required assess clinical
relevance observation. findings serve baseline for
further monitoring drug-resistant p. vivax malaria pakistan.
