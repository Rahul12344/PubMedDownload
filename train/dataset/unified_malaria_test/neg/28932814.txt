endosymbiotic wolbachia bacteria gut microbiome independently been
shown affect several aspects insect biology, including reproduction,
development, life span, stem cell activity, resistance human pathogens, in
insect vectors. work shows wolbachia bacteria, reside mainly in
the fly germline, affect microbial species present fly gut a
lab-reared strain. drosophila melanogaster hosts two main genera commensal
bacteria-acetobacter lactobacillus. wolbachia-infected flies have
significantly reduced titers acetobacter. sampling microbiome axenic
flies fed equal proportions bacteria shows presence of
wolbachia bacteria significant determinant composition the
microbiome throughout fly development. however, effect host genotype

wolbachia bacteria imd reactive oxygen species pathways, main
regulators immune response fly gut, measured. presence of
wolbachia bacteria induce significant changes expression the
genes effector molecules either pathway. furthermore, microbiome
modulation due direct interaction wolbachia bacteria gut
microbes. confocal analysis shows wolbachia bacteria absent gut

bacterial interaction effect wolbachia bacteria fly immunity. the
findings reported highlight importance considering composition of
the gut microbiome host genetic background wolbachia-induced

the microbiome large fraction insects parasitic nematodes. can
block mosquitos' ability transmit several infectious disease-causing
pathogens, including zika, dengue, chikungunya, west nile viruses malaria
parasites. certain extracellular bacteria present gut lumen these
insects also block pathogen transmission. however, understanding of

interactions bacterial species key factor determining overall
composition microbiome thus reveal new paradigms consider the
development disease control strategies.
