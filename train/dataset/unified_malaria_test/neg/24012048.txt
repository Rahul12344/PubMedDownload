background: plasmodium falciparum infections, proinflammatory cytokine
response implicated control parasite multiplication well in
disease pathogenesis. however, regulation proinflammatory and
anti-inflammatory cytokine balance relation disease severity remains
poorly understood.
methods: examined cytokines gene expression quantitative real time-pcr
technique case control study comprising p. falciparum infected (n=58) and
non infected (n=30) groups. p. falciparum infected stratified as
complicated uncomplicated per criterion parasitaemia levels.
results: higher expression il-2, il-12α tgf-β decreased levels of
il-10 seen p. falciparum positivity. complicated malaria associated
with enhanced expression ifn-γ tgf-β lower il-2 il-12α in
comparison uncomplicated malaria. modeling data suggested higher expression
of il-12α predictive uncomplicated malaria [odds ratio=3.074, 95% ci
(1.254-7.536)] negatively associated complicated malaria outcome
(p=0.014). interestingly, probability complicated malaria males with
elevated tnf-α expression three times higher [p=0.05; odds ratio=3.412, 95%
ci (0.98-11.848)]. age also seen factor higher il-8 diseased 
young (p=0.012).
conclusion: data suggested induction balanced cytokine response in
uncomplicated malaria cytokine dysregulation role tgf-β was
indicated complicated malaria. th cells appear source of
increased ifn-γ expression associated malaria severity.
