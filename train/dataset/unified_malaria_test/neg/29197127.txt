it estimated fungal infections, caused commonly candida albicans,
aspergillus fumigatus cryptococcus neoformans, result deaths annually
than malaria tuberculosis. long hypothesized fungal metabolism
plays critical role virulence though specific nutrient sources utilized by
human pathogenic fungi vivo remained enigmatic. however, metabolic
utilisation preferred carbon nitrogen sources, encountered host
niche-dependent manner, known carbon catabolite nitrogen catabolite
repression (ccr, ncr), shown important virulence. several 
sensory uptake systems exist, including carbon nitrogen source-specific
sensors transporters, allow scavenging preferred nutrient sources.
subsequent metabolic utilisation governed transcription factors, whose
functions essentiality differ fungal species. furthermore, additional
factors exist contribute implementation ccr ncr. role of
the ccr ncr-related factors virulence varies greatly fungal
species substantial gap knowledge exists regarding specific pathways.
further elucidation carbon nitrogen metabolism mechanisms therefore
required fungal species- animal model-specific manner order screen
for targets potential candidates anti-fungal drug development.
