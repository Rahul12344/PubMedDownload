malaria one debilitating mosquito-borne diseases high global 
health burdens. much research malaria mosquito-borne diseases
is focused africa, southeast asia accounts sizable portion global
burden malaria. moreover, 50% asian malaria incidence deaths 
have india. promising development context the
completion genome sequence anopheles stephensi, major malaria vector in
asia, offers new opportunities global health innovation, including the
progress deciphering vectorial ability mosquito species a
molecular level. moving forward, tissue-based expression profiling would the
next obvious step understanding gene functions an. stephensi. report 
this article, best knowledge, first in-depth study on
tissue-based transcriptomic profile four important organs (midgut, malpighian 
tubules, fat body, ovary) adult female an. stephensi mosquitoes. all,
we identified 20,000 transcripts corresponding 12,000 gene loci
from four tissues. present discuss tissue-based expression
profiles majority annotated transcripts an. stephensi genome, the
dynamics alternative splicing tissues, study. the
domain-based gene ontology analysis differentially expressed transcripts
in mosquito tissue indicated enrichment transcripts with
proteolytic activity midgut; transporter activity malpighian tubules; cell 
cycle, dna replication, repair activities ovaries; oxidoreductase
activities fat body. tissue-based study transcript expression gene
functions markedly enhances understanding important malaria vector,
and turn, offers rationales studies vectorial ability and
identification novel molecular targets intercept malaria transmission.
