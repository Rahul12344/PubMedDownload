background: establishing extent, geographical distribution mechanisms 
insecticide resistance malaria vectors prerequisite resistance
management. here, report widespread distribution insecticide resistance
in major malaria vector an. funestus across uganda western kenya under
the control metabolic resistance mechanisms.
methodology/principal findings: female an. funestus collected throughout uganda
and western kenya exhibited plasmodium infection rate 4.2 10.4%.
widespread resistance type (permethrin) ii (deltamethrin)
pyrethroids ddt observed across uganda western kenya. populations
remain highly susceptible carbamate, organophosphate dieldrin
insecticides. knockdown resistance plays role pyrethroid ddt
resistance kdr mutation associated resistance detected despite the
presence f1021c replacement. additionally, signature selection was
observed sodium channel gene. synergist assays qrt-pcr indicated 
metabolic resistance plays major role notably elevated expression of
cytochrome p450s. ddt resistance mechanisms differ west africa the
l119f-gste2 mutation explains small proportion genetic variance 
ddt resistance.
conclusion: extensive distribution pyrethroid ddt resistance east
african an. funestus populations represents challenge control this
vector. however, observed carbamate organophosphate susceptibility offers
alternative solutions resistance management.
