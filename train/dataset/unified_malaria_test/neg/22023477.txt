dna vaccines induce humoral cellular immune responses animals.
some dna vaccines already licensed infectious diseases west nile 
virus encephalitis horses. used humans, however, dna vaccines suffer
from lower immunogenicity profiles. although reasons poorly
understood, various hypotheses proposed. review aims provide
better understanding molecular immunological mechanisms dna
vaccines work knowledge used bring improvements in
their efficacy. recent studies provided evidence 'adjuvant effect' 
of plasmid dna mediated double-stranded structure. structure
activates stimulator interferon genes/tank-binding kinase 1 (sting/tbk1)-
dependent innate immune signaling pathways absence toll-like receptors.
indeed, type-i interferons (ifns), induced vivo via sting/tbk1 pathway,
were found crucial direct- indirect-antigen presentation via
distinct cell types (i.e. dendritic cells (dc) muscle cells, respectively).
importantly, incorporation tbk1 dna vaccine found enhance the
antigen-specific humoral immune responses targeting plasmodium falciparum
serine repeat antigen (sera), candidate vaccine antigen expressed the
blood-stages human malaria parasites. thus, results studies may
offer new ways develop dna vaccines, well delivering novel vaccine
adjuvants infectious diseases.
