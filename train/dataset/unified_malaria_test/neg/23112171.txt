the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum auxotrophic amino
acids. amino acid needs met largely degradation host
erythrocyte hemoglobin; however parasite must acquire isoleucine exogenously,
because amino acid present adult human hemoglobin. report 
when isoleucine withdrawn culture medium intraerythrocytic p.
falciparum, parasite slows metabolism progresses its
developmental cycle reduced rate. isoleucine-starved parasites remain viable
for 72 h resume rapid growth upon resupplementation. protein degradation
during starvation important maintenance hibernatory state.
microarray analysis starved parasites revealed 60% decrease rate of
progression normal transcriptional program apparent
stress response. plasmodium parasites possess tor nutrient-sensing
pathway rudimentary amino acid starvation-sensing eukaryotic
initiation factor 2α (eif2α) stress response. isoleucine deprivation results in
gcn2-mediated phosphorylation eif2α, kinase-knockout clones still able
to hibernate recover, indicating pathway directly promote 
survival isoleucine starvation. conclude p. falciparum, the
absence canonical eukaryotic nutrient stress-response pathways, cope 
an inconsistent bloodstream amino acid supply hibernating waiting more
nutrient provided.
