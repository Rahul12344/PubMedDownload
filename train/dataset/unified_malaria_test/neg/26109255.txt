malaria still one common infectious diseases leads various 
public health problems worldwide. medicinal plants promising sources for
identifying novel agents potential antimalarial activity. study aimed
to investigate antimalarial antioxidant activities indigofera
oblongifolia plasmodium chabaudi-induced spleen tissue injury mice. mice
were divided five groups. first group served vehicle control; the
second, third, fourth, fifth groups infected 1 × 10(6) p.
chabaudi-parasitized erythrocytes. mice last three groups gavaged
with 100 μl i. oblongifolia leave extract (iole) dose 100, 200, and
300 mg iole/kg, respectively, daily 7 days. iole significantly able 
to lower percentage parasitemia. effective dose 100 mg
iole/kg, could reduce parasitemia 38 12 %. infection 
induced spleen injury. evidenced disorganization spleen white 
red pulps, appearance hemozoin granules parasitized erythrocytes. these
changes spleen led increased histological score. also, infection
increased spleen oxidative damage levels nitrite/nitrate,
malondialdehyde, catalase significantly altered. these
infection-induced parameters significantly improved iole treatment.
in addition, mrna expression inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta,
interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha upregulated infection
with p. chabaudi, whereas iole significantly reduced expression these
genes. results indicate i. oblongifolia leaves extract exhibits a
significant antimalarial antioxidant effects, protects host spleen tissue
from injuries induced p. chabaudi.
