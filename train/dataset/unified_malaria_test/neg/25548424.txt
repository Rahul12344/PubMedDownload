the purpose study conduct survey dirofilaria immitis
infection among stray cats korea using nested pcr. included 235 stray cats 
(121 females 114 males) evaluated presence feline
heartworm infection. blood samples collected 135 cats daejeon, 50
cats seoul, 50 cats gyeonggi-do (province). 235 dna samples,
14 (6.0%) positive d. immitis. prevalence infection male cats 
(8/114, 7.0%) tended higher female cats (6/121, 5.0%), the
difference statistically significant. location, 8, 2, 4 cats 
were positive infection, respectively, based dna testing. significant
differences prevalence observed among geographic regions,
although rate infection higher gyeonggi-do (8.0%) daejeon
(5.9%) seoul (4.0%). submitted 7 14 d. immitis dna-positive samples
for sequencing analysis. samples corresponded partial d. immitis
cytochrome c oxidase subunit gene sequences 99% homology d. immitis
sequence deposited genbank (accession no. fn391553). best our
knowledge, first survey using nested pcr analyze prevalence of
d. immitis stray cats korea.
