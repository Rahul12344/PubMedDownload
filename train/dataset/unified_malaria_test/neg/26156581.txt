background: ms-based proteomics applied analysis medicinal
plant artemisia annua, exploiting recently published contig sequence database
(graham et al. (2010) science 327, 328-331) genomic proteomic
sequence databases comparison. a. annua predominant natural source 
artemisinin, precursor artemisinin-based combination therapies (acts),
which who-recommended treatment p. falciparum malaria.
results: comparison various databases containing a. annua sequences
(ncbinr/viridiplantae, uniprot/viridiplantae, uniprot/a. annua, a. annua
trichome trinity contig database, contig database another a. annua 
est database) revealed significant differences respect suitability
for proteomic analysis, showing organism-specific database has
undergone extensive curation, leading longer contig sequences, greatly
increase number true positive protein identifications, reducing 
number false positives. compared previously published data an
order-of-magnitude proteins identified trichome-enriched a.
annua samples, including proteins known involved the
biosynthesis artemisinin, well highly abundant proteins, which
suggest additional enzymatic processes occurring within trichomes are
important biosynthesis artemisinin.
conclusions: newly gained information allows possibility an
enzymatic pathway, utilizing peroxidases, less well understood final
stages artemisinin's biosynthesis, alternative known
non-enzymatic vitro conversion dihydroartemisinic acid artemisinin. data
are available via proteomexchange identifier pxd000703.
