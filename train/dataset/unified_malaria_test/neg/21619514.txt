the increasing demand novel anti-parasitic drugs due resistance formation 
to well-established chemotherapeutically important compounds increased the
demands better understanding mechanism(s) action existing
drugs drugs development. different approaches developed
to identify targets thus mode action anti-parasitic compounds, it
has become clear many drugs act one, possibly several
parasite molecules even pathways. ideally, targets present in
any cells host. case apicomplexan parasites, unique
apicoplast, provides suitable target compounds binding dna ribosomal 
rna prokaryotic origin. case intracellular pathogens, given drug
might affect pathogen directly acting parasite-associated
targets, also indirectly, altering host cell physiology. turn 
could affect parasite development lead parasite death. review,
we provide overview strategies target identification, present
examples selected drug targets, ranging proteins nucleic acids to
intermediary metabolism.
