background: plasmodium vivax malaria characterized relapses arising from
the hypnozoite stages liver. currently registered drug for
radical treatment prevent relapse primaquine. primaquine, prodrug,
requires metabolism liver cytochrome cyp2d6 isoenzyme active
metabolite. mutations cyp2d6 gene may thus affect primaquine efficacy. a
snps genotyping technique developed characterize cyp2d6 genetic
variants tested patients plasmodium vivax infection
collected karen population thailand-myanmar border, p. vivax
malaria endemic.
methods: direct sequencing pcr-reamplified products (dsp) used uncover 
exonic cyp2d6 sequence variations. subsequently, allele-specific
oligonucleotide probe real-time snps genotyping (aso) assay developed for
rapid detection four clinically relevant cyp2d6 variants occurring this
population. two in-house developed assays used genotype cyp2d6
mutations blood samples obtained 70 karen adults.
results: results showed high degree concordance dsp aso
methods. six cyp2d6 point mutations identified within karen population: 
c100t, c1039t, g1661c, g1846a, c2850t g4180c, frequencies 0.43, 0.43,
0.76, 0.02, 0.32 0.76, respectively. cyp2d6*2, *4, *5, *10 *36
allelic frequencies 0.33, 0.02, 0.03, 0.40 0.01, respectively. alleles
conferring intermediate cyp2d6 metabolizer phenotype comprised 46% the
total number alleles.
conclusion: newly developed aso assay reliable rapid tool for
large-scale cyp2d6 genotyping. high frequency cyp2d6*10 allele 
karen population warrants assessment association radical 
curative efficacy primaquine.
