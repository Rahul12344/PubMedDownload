background: artemisinin-resistant plasmodium falciparum reported
throughout greater mekong subregion threatens disrupt current malaria 
control efforts worldwide. polymorphisms kelch13 associated with
clinical vitro resistance phenotypes; however, several studies suggest
that genetic determinants resistance may involve multiple genes. current
proposed mechanisms resistance conferred polymorphisms kelch13 hint a
connection autophagy-like pathway p. falciparum.
results: snp autophagy-related gene 18 (atg18) associated long
parasite clearance half-life patients following artemisinin-based combination 
therapy. gene encodes pfatg18, shown similar the
mammalian/yeast homologue wipi/atg18 terms structure, binding abilities,
and ability form puncta response stress. investigate contribution
of polymorphism, atg18 gene edited using crispr/cas9 introduce 
t38i mutation k13-edited dd2 parasite. presence snp confers 
fitness advantage enabling parasites grow faster nutrient-limited
settings. mutant parent parasites screened drug libraries of
6349 unique compounds. snp modulate parasite's
susceptibility anti-malarial compounds using 72-h drug pulse, 
did alter parasite's susceptibility 227 compounds.
conclusions: results suggest atg18 t38i polymorphism may provide
additional resistance artemisinin derivatives, partner drugs,
even absence kelch13 mutations, may also important parasite
survival nutrient deprivation.
