background: regular monitoring levels anti-malarial resistance of
plasmodium falciparum essential policy adapt therapy improve malaria
control. monitoring facilitated using molecular tools, are
easier implement classical determination resistance phenotype.
in cameroon, chloroquine (cq), previously first-line therapy for
uncomplicated malaria officially withdrawn 2002 replaced initially 
amodiaquine (aq) monotherapy. then, artemisinin-based combination therapy (act), 
notably artesunate-amodiaquine (as-aq) artemether-lumefantrine (al), was
gradually introduced 2004. situation raised question evolution
of p. falciparum resistance molecular markers yaoundé, highly urbanized
cameroonian city.
methods: genotype pfcrt 72 76 pfmdr1 86 alleles pfmdr1 copy
number determined using real-time pcr 447 p. falciparum samples collected
between 2005 2009.
results: study showed high prevalence parasites mutant pfcrt 76
(83%) pfmdr1 86 (93%) codons. contrary, mutations pfcrt 72
codon samples duplication pfmdr1 gene observed.
conclusion: high prevalence mutant pfcrt 76t pfmdr1 86y alleles might 
be due choice alternative drugs (aq as-aq) known select such
genotypes. mutant pfcrt 72 codon detected despite prolonged use aq
either monotherapy combined artesunate. absence pfmdr1
multicopies suggests al would still remain efficient. limited use of
mefloquine predominance mutant pfmdr1 86y codon could explain lack 
of pfmdr1 amplification. indeed, mutant codon rarely associated with
duplication pfmdr1 gene. cameroon, changes therapeutic strategies
and simultaneous use several formulations act anti-malarials
that officially recommended result complex selective pressure,
rendering prediction evolution p. falciparum resistance difficult. 
this public health problem lead increased vigilance regular
monitoring.
