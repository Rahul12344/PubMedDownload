background: atovaquone-proguanil (ap) commonly used treatment for
uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria united states. apparent ap
treatment failures reported 7 months apart 2 american travelers who
stayed compound foreign workers rivers state, nigeria.
methods: analyzed pretreatment (day 0) day failure samples both
travelers mutations p falciparum cytochrome b (pfcytb) and
dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) genes associated resistance atovaquone
and cycloguanil, active metabolite proguanil, respectively. genotyped
the parasites sequenced mitochondrial genomes.
results: day 0, travelers proguanil-resistant genotypes but
atovaquone-sensitive cytb sequences. day failure samples exhibited mutations
in cytb travelers. one traveler common y268s mutation, whereas
the traveler previously unreported mutation, i258m. travelers had
unrelated parasite genotypes different mitochondrial genomes.
conclusions: despite infections likely contracted same
site, evidence cases related. mutations likely
arose independently acute infection treatment. results
highlight importance genotyping parasites sequencing full cytb and
dhfr genes ap failures rule transmission ap-resistant strains and
identify novel mechanisms ap resistance.
