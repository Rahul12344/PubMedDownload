background: artemisinin-based combination therapies, including
artemether-lumefantrine (al) dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (dp), are
recommended treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria. sensitivities to
components al dp impacted polymorphisms pfmdr1 pfcrt. we
monitored changes prevalences polymorphisms tororo, uganda, 2008 to
2012.
methods: polymorphic loci pfmdr1 pfcrt characterized samples 
312 children randomized al dp episode uncomplicated malaria (50
samples per arm 3-month interval) utilizing fluorescent microsphere
assay. treatment outcomes impacts prior therapies also characterized.
results: prevalence increased significantly time pfmdr1 n86 (al: odds
ratio [or], 2.08 [95% confidence interval {ci}, 1.83-2.38]; dp: 1.41 [95% ci,
1.25-1.57]), pfmdr1 d1246 (al: 1.46 [95% ci, 1.29-1.64]; dp: 1.36 [95% ci,
1.23-1.50]), pfcrt k76 (al: 3.37 [95% ci, 1.85-6.16]; dp: 5.84 [95% ci,
1.94-17.53], decreased pfmdr1 y184 (al: 0.78 [95% ci, .70-.86]; dp: 0.84 
[95% ci, .76-1.50]); changes consistently greater al arm. recent al
treatment selected pfmdr1 n86, d1246, 184f subsequent episodes; dp
selected opposite alleles.
conclusions: genotypes decreased sensitivity al components increased over
time. increase greater children receiving al, suggesting the
choice treatment regimen profoundly influence parasite genetics drug
sensitivity.
