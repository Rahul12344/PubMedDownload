the genome sequence available different plasmodium species valuable
resource understanding malaria parasite biology. however, comparative
genomics cannot fully explain species-specific differences
which suggests genomic aspects regulation gene expression
play important role defining species-specific characteristics. here, we
developed comprehensive approach measure transcriptional changes the
evolutionary conserved syntenic orthologs intraerythrocytic
developmental cycle across six plasmodium species. show significant
transcriptional constraint mid-developmental stage plasmodium species
while earliest stages parasite development display greatest
transcriptional variation associated critical functional processes. modeling
of evolutionary relationship based changes transcriptional profile
reveal phylogeny pattern plasmodium species strictly follows its
mammalian hosts. addition, work shows transcriptional conserved
orthologs represent potential future targets anti-malaria intervention as
they would expected carry key essential functions within parasites.
this work provides integrated analysis orthologous transcriptome, which
aims provide insights plasmodium evolution thereby establishing a
framework explore complex pathways drug discovery plasmodium species
with broad host range.
