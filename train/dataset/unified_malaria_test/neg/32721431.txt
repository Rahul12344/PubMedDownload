dihydroartemisinin (dha) artemisinin derivative commonly used malaria
therapy, growing number studies focused potent anticancer
activity dha. however, reproductive toxicity anticancer drugs a
major concern young female cancer patients. previous studies suggested
that dha cause embryonic damage affect oocyte maturation. here, we
explored side effects dha exposure ovarian somatic cells. exposed
porcine granulosa cells 5 μm 40 μm dha 24 h 48 h vitro. dha
inhibited granulosa cell viability dose-dependent manner and, 48 h
treatment group, dha enhanced apoptotic rate. observed levels 
intracellular calcium, mitochondrial calcium, atp concentration elevated
with dha treatment. granulosa cells exposed dha, mrna levels of
endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes grp78 atf4 increased.
furthermore, analysis unfolded protein response signaling pathway showed
that protein levels p-perk, p-eif2α, atf4 upregulated dha
exposure. results demonstrate granulosa cells, dha exposure induces
endoplasmic reticulum stress activates perk/eif2α/atf4 signaling
pathway, thus providing insight mechanism underlying dha-induced
reproductive toxicity, giving reference dha use females.
