background: transcriptional profiling human immune response malaria has
been used identify diagnostic markers, understand pathogenicity severe 
disease dissect mechanisms naturally acquired immunity (nai). however,
interpreting body work difficult given considerable variation study
design, definition disease, patient selection methodology employed. this
work details comprehensive review gene expression profiling (gep) the
human immune response malaria determine technology been
applied date, instances advanced understanding nai the
extent variability methodology studies allow informed comparison
of data interpretation results.
methods: datasets gene expression omnibus (geo) including search
terms; 'plasmodium' 'malaria' 'sporozoite' 'merozoite' 'gametocyte'
and 'homo sapiens' identified publications analysed. datasets gene
expression changes relation malaria vaccines excluded.
results: twenty-three geo datasets 25 related publications included in
the final review. datasets related plasmodium falciparum infection, except
two related plasmodium vivax infection. majority datasets included
samples individuals infected malaria 'naturally' field (n = 13, 
57%), however related controlled human malaria infection (chmi) studies
(n = 6, 26%), cells stimulated plasmodium vitro (n = 6, 26%). the
majority studies examined gene expression changes relating blood stage 
of parasite. significant heterogeneity datasets identified in
terms study design, sample type, platform used method analysis. seven
datasets specifically investigated transcriptional changes associated nai to
malaria, evidence supporting suppression innate pro-inflammatory
response important mechanism majority studies.
however, interpretation body work limited heterogeneity
between studies small sample sizes.
conclusions: gep malaria potentially powerful tool, date studies
have hypothesis generating small sample sizes widely varying
methodology. chmi studies increasingly performed endemic settings,
there growing opportunity use gep understand detailed time-course
changes host response understand greater detail mechanisms nai.
