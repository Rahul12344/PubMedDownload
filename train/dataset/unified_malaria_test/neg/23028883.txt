background: acquired antibodies important human immunity malaria, but
key targets remain largely unknown. plasmodium falciparum
reticulocyte-binding-homologue-4 (pfrh4) important invasion human
erythrocytes may therefore target protective immunity.
methods: igg igg subclass-specific responses different regions of
pfrh4 determined longitudinal cohort 206 children papua new
guinea (png). human pfrh4 antibodies tested functional
invasion-inhibitory activity, expression pfrh4 p. falciparum isolates
and sequence polymorphisms determined.
results: antibodies pfrh4 acquired children exposed p. falciparum
malaria, predominantly comprised igg1 igg3 subclasses, were
associated increasing age active parasitemia. high levels antibodies,
particularly igg3, strongly predictive protection clinical
malaria high-density parasitemia. human affinity-purified antibodies the
binding region pfrh4 effectively inhibited erythrocyte invasion p.
falciparum merozoites antibody levels protected children at
functionally-active concentrations. although expression pfrh4 vary, pfrh4 
protein expressed isolates derived cohort showed limited
sequence polymorphism.
conclusions: evidence suggests pfrh4 target antibodies that
contribute protective immunity malaria inhibiting erythrocyte invasion
and preventing high density parasitemia. findings advance understanding
of targets mechanisms human immunity evaluating potential of
pfrh4 component candidate malaria vaccines.
