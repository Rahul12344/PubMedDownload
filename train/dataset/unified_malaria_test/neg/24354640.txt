background: emergence parasite drug resistance, especially plasmodium
falciparum, persists major obstacle malaria control elimination. 
develop effective public health containment strategies, clear understanding 
factors govern emergence spread resistant parasites field 
is important. current study documents selection chloroquine-sensitive
malaria parasites wild anopheles arabiensis southern zambia.
methods: 2,000-sq km region, mosquitoes collected human sleeping
rooms using pyrethrum spray catches 2006 malaria transmission season. 
after morphological examination molecular confirmation, vector mosquitoes
were dissected separate head thorax abdominal section, followed
by pcr screening p. falciparum infection. human residents ages were
tested p. falciparum parasitaemia microscopy pcr. plasmodium
falciparum infections genotyped chloroquine resistance-conferring
amino acid codon 76 pfcrt gene, using pcr restriction enzyme
digestion.
results: human population nearly 90% prevalence the
chloroquine-resistant pfcrt k76t mutant, significant differences in
polymorphism among smear-positive smear-negative (submicroscopic) infections 
(p = 0.323, n = 128). however, infections abdominal salivary gland
phases an. arabiensis vector exhibited wild type k76-bearing parasites
with 9x higher odds (or (95% ci): 9 (3.7-20.2), p < 0.0005, n = 125),
despite acquired humans within weeks.
conclusions: anopheles arabiensis selects wild-type k76-bearing p. falciparum
during abdominal salivary gland phases parasite development. the
rapid vectorial selection, also recently seen antifolate resistance, is
evidence parasite fitness cost mosquito, may underpin regional
heterogeneity emergence, spread waning drug resistance.
understanding nature direction vector selection could instrumental 
for rational curtailment spread drug resistance integrated malaria
control elimination programmes.
