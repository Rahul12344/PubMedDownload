malaria serious condition non-immune traveller, prognosis depends
on timely diagnosis. although microscopy remains cornerstone diagnosis,
malaria rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) increasingly used non-endemic
settings. easy use, provide results rapidly require specific
training equipment. reported sensitivities vary different rdt
products generally good plasmodium falciparum, rdts detecting
the p. falciparum antigen histidine-rich protein-2 (pfhrp2) scoring slightly
better p. falciparum-lactate dehydrogenase (pf-pldh)-detecting rdts.
sensitivity lower plasmodium vivax (66.0 - 88.0%) poor plasmodium 
ovale (5.5 - 86.7%) plasmodium malariae (21.4 - 45.2%). rapid diagnostic
tests several limitations, including persistence pfhrp2
antigen, cross-reactions p. falciparum non-falciparum test line and
vice versa (rare) false-positive reactions due infectious agents 
immunological factors. false-negative results occur case low parasite
densities, prozone effect pfhrp2 gene deletions. addition, errors in
interpretation occur, partly due inadequacies instructions use.
finally, rdts give information parasite density. diagnostic
laboratory, rdts valuable adjunct (but replacement for) microscopy
for diagnosis malaria returned traveller.in malaria endemic
settings, special groups travellers (those travelling long periods,
expatriates short-stay frequent travellers) remote qualified
medical services may benefit self-diagnosis rdts, provided use
correctly stored rdt products proven accuracy, comprehensive instructions
for use appropriate hands-on training.
