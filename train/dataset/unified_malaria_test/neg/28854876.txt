background: malaria control africa dependent upon use insecticides 
intensive use limited number chemicals led resistance mosquito 
populations. increased production enzymes detoxify insecticides one of
the potent resistance mechanisms. several metabolic enzymes been
implicated insecticide resistance processes controlling their
expression remained largely elusive.
results: here, show transcription factor maf-s regulates expression
of multiple detoxification genes, including key insecticide metabolisers
cyp6m2 gstd1 african malaria vector anopheles gambiae. attenuation 
this transcription factor rnai induced knockdown reduced transcript
levels effectors significantly increased mortality exposure to
the pyrethroid insecticides ddt (permethrin: 9.2% 19.2% (p = 0.015),
deltamethrin: 3.9% 21.6% (p = 0.036) ddt: 1% 11.7% (p = <0.01), whilst 
dramatically decreasing mortality induced organophosphate malathion (79.6%
to 8.0% (p = <0.01)). additional genes regulated maf-s also identified
providing new insight role transcription factor insects.
conclusion: maf-s key regulator detoxification genes anopheles
mosquitoes. disrupting transcription factor opposing effects the
mosquito's response different insecticide classes providing mechanistic
explanation negative cross resistance reported between
pyrethroids organophosphates.
