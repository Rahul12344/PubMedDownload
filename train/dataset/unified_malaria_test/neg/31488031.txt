artemisinin analogues (arts) currently effective
anti-malarial drugs, precise mechanism action still highly
controversial. effects arts plasmodium genes expression studied 
lab. overexpression interesting amidotransferase, nadh-dependent
glutamate synthase (nadh-glts) found treated dihydroartemisinin (dha). 
the increased expression occurred global transcriptomics analysis
on human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum (p. falciparum) 3d7 gene 
expression screening iron-sulphur cluster proteins p.f. 3d7
in vitro also plasmodium berghei (p. berghei) anka mice. influence of

dose-dependent manner effective doses. l-glutamine (gln) and
l-glutamate (glu) substrate product nadh-glts respectively.
azaserine (aza) specific inhibitor nadh-glts. experimental data showed
that glu levels significantly decreasing dha dose increasing but
nadh-glts enzyme activities still remained higher levels parasites,
and appropriate amount exogenous glu could significantly reduce anti-malarial 
action dha excessive amount lost effect. aza alone could inhibit
proliferation p. falciparum additive effect combination with
dha. results could suggest that: glutamate depletion one the
anti-malarial actions dha; overexpression nadh-glts would feedback
pattern parasite due glutamate depletion, direct action of
dha; "feedback pattern" one protective strategies plasmodium to
interfere anti-malarial actions dha; specific inhibitor for
nadh-glts new type anti-malarial agents new partner act might
provide potential.
