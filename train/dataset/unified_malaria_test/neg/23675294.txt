cd8⁺ cells mediate immunity plasmodium liver stages. however, the
paucity parasite-specific epitopes cd8⁺ cells limited current
understanding mechanisms influencing generation, maintenance and
efficiency responses. identify antigenic epitopes stringent
murine malaria immunisation model, performed systematic profiling of
h(2b)-restricted peptides predicted genome-wide analysis. describe the
identification plasmodium berghei (pb) sporozoite-specific gene 20 (s20)- 
thrombospondin-related adhesive protein (trap)-derived peptides, termed pbs20₃₁₈ 
and pbtrap₁₃₀ respectively, targets cd8⁺ cells c57bl/6 mice
vaccinated whole parasite strategies known protect sporozoite
challenge. pbs20₃₁₈ pbtrap₁₃₀ elicit effector effector memory 
phenotypes spleens livers immunised mice, only
pbtrap₁₃₀-specific cd8⁺ cells exhibit vivo cytotoxicity. moreover,
pbtrap₁₃₀-specific, pbs20₃₁₈-specific, cd8⁺ cells significantly
contribute inhibition parasite development. prime/boost vaccination with
pbtrap demonstrates cd8⁺ cell-dependent efficacy sporozoite challenge. 
we conclude pbtrap immunodominant antigen liver-stage
infection. together, results underscore presence cd8⁺ cells with
divergent potencies distinct plasmodium liver-stage epitopes. our
identification antigen-specific cd8⁺ cells allow interrogation the
development immune responses malaria liver stages.
