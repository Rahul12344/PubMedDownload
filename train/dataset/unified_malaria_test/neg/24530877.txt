alteration adhesive mechanical properties red blood cells caused by
infection malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum underpin its
survival extreme pathogenicity. unique family parasite putative exported
kinases, collectively called fikk (phenylalanine (f) - isoleucine (i) - lysine
(k) - lysine (k)), recently implicated pathophysiological
processes, however, precise function p. falciparum-infected red blood
cells likely role malaria pathogenesis remain unknown. here, 
first time, demonstrate one member fikk family, fikk4.2, can
function active kinase localised novel distinct compartment
of parasite-infected red blood cell called k-dots. notably,
targeted disruption gene encoding fikk4.2 (fikk4.2) dramatically alters
the parasite's ability modify remodel red blood cells it
multiplies. specifically, red blood cells infected fikk4.2 knockout
parasites significantly less rigid less adhesive compared red 
blood cells infected normal parasites transgenic clones had
been derived, despite expressing similar levels major cytoadhesion ligand,
pfemp1, red blood cell surface. notably, changes accompanied by
dramatically altered knob-structures infected red blood cells play key 
role cytoadhesion responsible much pathogenesis associated
with falciparum malaria. taken together, data identifies fikk4.2 an
important kinase pathogenesis p. falciparum malaria strengthens the
attractiveness fikk kinases targets development novel
next-generation anti-malaria drugs.
