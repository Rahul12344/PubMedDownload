low complexity regions (lcrs) common feature shared many genomes, but
their evolutionary functional significance remains mostly unknown. the
core uncertainty poor understanding mechanisms regulate
their retention genomes, whether driven natural selection neutral
evolution. applying comparative approach lcrs multiple strains and
species powerful approach identify patterns conservation these
regions. using method, investigate evolutionary history lcrs in
the genus plasmodium based orthologous protein coding genes shared 11
species strains primate rodent-infecting pathogens. find multiple
lines evidence support natural selection major evolutionary force
shaping composition conservation lcrs time signatures that
their evolutionary paths species specific. findings add comparative
analysis perspective debate evolution lcrs harness power
of sequence comparisons identify potential functionally important lcr
candidates.
