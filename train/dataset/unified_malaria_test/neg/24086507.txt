control parasite replication exerted mhc class restricted cd8+ t-cells in
the liver critical vaccination-induced protection malaria. while
many intracellular pathogens subvert mhc class presentation machinery, 
functionality course malaria replication hepatocytes been
characterized. using experimental systems based specific identification,
isolation analysis human hepatocytes infected p. berghei anka gfp 
p. falciparum 3d7 gfp sporozoites demonstrated molecular components of
the mhc class pathway exhibit largely unaltered expression malaria-infected 
hepatocytes late stages parasite development. furthermore, infected
cells showed obvious defects capacity upregulate expression of
different molecular components mhc class machinery response to
pro-inflammatory lymphokines trigger direct activation allo-specific or
peptide-specific human cd8+ t-cells. demonstrate ectopic
expression circumsporozoite protein alter expression critical
genes mhc class pathway response pro-inflammatory cytokines. 
in addition, identified supra-cellular structures, arose late stages 
of parasite replication, possessed characteristic morphology merosomes and
exhibited nearly complete loss surface mhc class expression. data have
multiple implications understanding natural t-cell immunity against
malaria may promote development novel, efficient anti-malaria vaccines
