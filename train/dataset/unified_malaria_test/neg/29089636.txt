ly6chi inflammatory monocytes (imo) critical host defense against
toxoplasmosis malaria role leishmaniasis unclear. this
study, report detrimental role ly6chi imos visceral leishmaniasis (vl)
caused leishmania donovani. demonstrate ly6chi imos continuously
recruited spleen liver l. donovani infection are
preferential targets parasite. using microarray-based gene expression
profiling, show ly6chi imos isolated infected liver spleen
have distinct phenotypic activation profiles. furthermore, demonstrate
that blocking recruitment ly6chi imos liver spleen l. 
donovani infection using ccr2 antagonist reduces frequency the
pathogenic ifn-Î³/il10 dual producer cd4+ cells spleen leads a
significant reduction parasite loads liver spleen. using stat1-/-
mice show stat1 critical mediating recruitment ly6chi imos 
into organs l. donovani infection, adaptive transfer wild type
ly6chi imos stat1-/- recipients renders susceptible disease. our
findings reveal unexpected pathogenic role ly6chi imos promoting
parasite survival vl open possibility targeting population for
host-directed therapy vl.
