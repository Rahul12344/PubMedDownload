there published reports mutations dihydropteroate synthetase (dhps)
and dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) genes p. falciparum populations nigeria,
but one previous study recorded novel dhps mutation codon 431 among
infections imported united kingdom nigeria. assess widespread 
this mutation among parasites different parts country and
consequently fill gap sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) resistance data in
nigeria, retrospectively analysed 1000 filter paper blood spots collected in
surveys pregnant women children uncomplicated falciparum malaria
between 2003 2015 four sites south north. genomic dna was
extracted filter paper blood spots placental impressions. point
mutations codons 16, 50, 51, 59, 108, 140 164 dhfr gene codons 
431, 436, 437, 540, 581 613 dhps gene evaluated nested pcr
amplification followed direct sequencing. distribution dhps-431v
mutation widespread throughout nigeria highest prevalence enugu
(46%). ibadan sequential sampling, prevalence increased 
0% 6.5% 2003 2008. although various combinations of
dhps mutations 431v, combination 431v + 436a + 437g+581g+613s the
most common. observations support view dhps-431v the
increase. addition, p. falciparum dhps crystal structure modelling shows 
the change isoleucine valine (dhps-431v) could alter effects 
s436a/f a437g, closely follow 2nd β-strand. consequently, now
a research priority assess implications dhps-vagkgs mutant haplotype on
continuing use sp seasonal malaria chemoprevention (smc) intermittent
preventive treatment pregnancy (iptp). data also provides surveillance
data sp resistance markers nigeria 2003 2015.
