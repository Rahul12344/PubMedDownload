background: malaria (plasmodium spp) remains top cause travel-associated
morbidity among european residents. here, describe recent trends imported
malaria belgium characterize first cases p.falciparum failure to
artemisinin-based combination therapy (act).
methods: national surveillance data registers national reference
laboratory used investigate malaria cases act failures past 20
years. recurrent infections confirmed pfmsp genotyping polymorphisms 
in drug resistance-associated genes pfk13, pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfpm2, pfap2mu and
pfubp1 determined sequencing quantitative pcr.
results: annual malaria cases steadily increased last decade, reaching 428
in 2017 (all species). estimated 15% p.falciparum cases severe.
between 2014 2017, 727 p.falciparum cases reported six non-immune
travellers presented late recurrence. five hyperparasitaemia and/or signs 
severe malaria initial consultation. mutations act drug resistance
markers detected, although pfcrt-pfmdr1 haplotypes associated with
lumefantrine tolerance common.
conclusions: upward trend imported malaria, substantial proportion 
severe cases emergence act failures sources concern, although
late failures infrequent. genetic analysis support parasitological
resistance act, suggesting prospective pharmacokinetic studies assess
adequacy partner drug dosage duration treatment non-immune
populations.
