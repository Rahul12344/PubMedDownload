artemisinin sesquiterpene lactone produced chinese traditional herb
artemisia annua used treatment malaria. known that
salicylic acid (sa) enhance artemisinin content mechanism it
does known. study, systematically investigated basic
leucine zipper family transcription factor, aatga6, involved sa signaling to
regulate artemisinin biosynthesis. found specific vivo vitro binding
of aatga6 protein 'tgacg' element aaerf1 promoter. moreover, we
demonstrated aanpr1 interact aatga6 enhance dna-binding
activity cognate promoter element 'tgacg' promoter aaerf1, thus 
enhancing artemisinin biosynthesis. artemisinin contents in
aatga6-overexpressing rnai transgenic plants increased 90-120% and
decreased 20-60%, respectively, indicating aatga6 plays positive role
in artemisinin biosynthesis. importantly, heterodimerization aatga3
significantly inhibits dna-binding activity aatga6 plays negative
role target gene activation. conclusion, demonstrate binding of
aatga6 promoter artemisinin-regulatory gene aaerf1 enhanced by
aanpr1 inhibited aatga3. based findings, aatga6 potential
value genetic engineering artemisinin production.
