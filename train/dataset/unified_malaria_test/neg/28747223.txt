background: chloroquine (cq) cornerstone anti-malarial treatment in
africa almost 50Â years, widely withdrawn due emergence
and spread resistance. recent reports suggested cq-susceptibility
may return following cessation cq usage. here, monitor cq sensitivity
and determine prevalence genetic polymorphisms cq resistance
transporter gene (pfcrt) plasmodium falciparum isolates recently imported from
africa china.
methods: blood samples collected falciparum malaria patients returning 
to china various countries africa. isolates tested their
sensitivity cq using sybr green test ex vivo, subset of
samples, vitro following culture adaptation. mutations positions 72-76 
codon 220 pfcrt gene analyzed sequencing confirmed by
pcr-rflp. correlations drug sensitivity pfcrt polymorphisms were
investigated.
results: 32 culture adapted isolates assayed, 17 (53.1%), 6 (18.8%) 9
(28.1%) classified sensitive, moderately resistant, highly resistant,
respectively. vitro cq susceptibility related point mutations the
pfcrt gene, results indicating strong association pfcrt genotype
and drug sensitivity. total 292 isolates typed pfcrt locus, 
the prevalence wild type (cq sensitive) haplotype cvmnk isolates from
east, south, north, west central africa 91.4%, 80.0%, 73.3%, 53.3% and
51.7%, respectively. mutant haplotype observed cviet, was
almost always linked additional mutation a220s.
conclusions: results suggest reduction drug pressure following
withdrawal cq first-line drug may lead resurgence cq sensitive
parasites. prevalence wild-type pfcrt cq sensitive parasites east,
south north africa higher west central areas, 
varied greatly countries. surveillance required assess
whether prevalence cq resistant parasites continue decrease the
absence widespread cq usage.
