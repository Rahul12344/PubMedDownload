we identified two novel proteins colocalize subpellicular
microtubules protozoan parasite toxoplasma gondii named proteins
spm1 spm2. proteins basic isoelectric points have
homologs apicomplexan parasites. spm1 contains six tandem copies a
32-amino-acid repeat, whereas spm2 lacks defined protein signatures. alignment of
toxoplasma spm2 apparent plasmodium spm2 homologs indicates the
greatest degree conservation lies carboxy-terminal half protein.
analysis plasmodium homologs spm1 indicates central
32-amino-acid repeats expanded different degrees (7, 8, 9, 12, 13
repeats), amino- carboxy-terminal regions remain conserved. contrast, 
although cryptosporidium spm1 homolog conserved carboxy tail, five 
repeats considerably diverged, smaller amino-terminal domain.
spm1 localized along full length subpellicular microtubules but
does associate conoid spindle microtubules. spm2 restricted
localization along middle region subpellicular microtubules. domain
deletion analysis indicates four copies spm1 repeat are
required localization microtubules, amino-terminal 63 residues 
spm2 required localization subpellicular microtubules. gene
deletion studies indicate neither spm1 spm2 essential tachyzoite 
viability. however, loss spm1 decreases overall parasite fitness and
eliminates stability subpellicular microtubules detergent extraction.
