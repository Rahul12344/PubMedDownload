apoptosis types regulated cell death defined as
fundamental processes plant animal development, occurrence of, and
possible roles for, regulated cell death parasitic protozoa remain
controversial. key problem difficulty reconciling presence 
of apparent morphological markers apoptosis notable absence of
the key executioners functioning higher eukaryotes. here, review the
evidence regulated cell death pathways selected parasitic protozoa and
propose cell death organisms classified two primary
types: necrosis incidental death. opinion dedicated molecular 
machinery required initiation execution regulated cell death has
yet convincingly identified.
