background: increasing antimalarial drug resistance significant
hindrance malaria control elimination programs. last six decades, 
chloroquine (cq) plus pyrimethamine remains first-line treatment p. vivax
malaria. regions p. falciparum p. vivax co-exist, p. vivax is
exposed antifolate drugs due either misdiagnosis improper treatment that
causes selective drug pressure evolve. therefore, present study aims to
estimate antimalarial drug resistance among complicated uncomplicated p. 
vivax patients.
methods: total 143 p. vivax malaria positive patients enrolled 
study, dna isolated blood samples. pvcrt-o, pvmdr-1, pvdhps,
and pvdhfr genes pcrs amplified, drug resistance-associated gene
mutations analyzed. statistical analysis drug resistance genes and
population diversity performed using mega vs. 7.0.21 dnasp v software.
results: among cq resistance marker gene pvcrt-o, prevalence k10
insertion 17.5% (7/40) 9.5% (7/73) complicated uncomplicated p
vivax group isolates respectively. pvmdr-1, double mutant haplotype
(m958/l1076) found 99% clinical isolates. among pyrimethamine
resistance-associated gene pvdhfr, double mutant haplotype
i13p33f57r58t61n117i173 detected 23% (11/48) complicated 20%
(17/85) uncomplicated group isolates. sulphadoxine
resistance-associated pvdhps gene, limited polymorphism observed the
presence single mutant (d459a) among 16 5% clinical isolates in
the complicated uncomplicated group respectively.
conclusion: study presents situations polymorphism antimalarial
drug resistance-associated genes emphasizes need regular
surveillance. imperative development suitable antimalarial drug 
policy india.
