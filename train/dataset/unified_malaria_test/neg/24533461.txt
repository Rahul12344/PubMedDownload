background: plasmodium vivax one five species causing malaria human 
beings, affecting around 391 million people annually. development an
anti-malarial vaccine proposed alternative controlling this
disease. however, development hampered allele-specific responses 
produced high genetic diversity shown parasite antigens.
evaluating antigens' genetic diversity thus essential designing a
completely effective vaccine.
methods: gene sequences plasmodium vivax p12 (pv12) p38 (pv38),
obtained field isolates colombia, used evaluating haplotype
polymorphism distribution population genetics analysis. evolutionary
forces generating variation pattern observed also determined.
results: pv12 pv38 shown low genetic diversity. neutral
model pv12 could discarded, whilst polymorphism pv38 maintained
by balanced selection restricted gene's 5' region. encoded proteins
seemed functional/structural constraints due presence s48/45
domains, seen highly conserved.
conclusions: due role malaria parasite p12 p38 proteins seem to
play invasion plasmodium species, added pv12 pv38 antigenic 
characteristics low genetic diversity observed, proteins might be
good candidates evaluated design multistage/multi-antigen
vaccine.
