of novel drug targets. here, report functional analysis plasmodium 
ancient bacterial shewanella-like protein phosphatase (shlp1) found in
bacteria, fungi, protists, plants. shlp1 abundant asexual blood stages 
and expressed stages parasite life cycle. shlp1 deletion results in
a reduction ookinete (zygote) development, microneme formation, complete
ablation oocyst formation, thereby blocking parasite transmission. defect

emphasizes varied functions shlp1 plasmodium ookinete biology and
suggests could novel drug target blocking parasite transmission.
