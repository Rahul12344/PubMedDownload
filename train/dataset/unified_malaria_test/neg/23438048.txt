malaria rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) instrument-free tests provide
results within 20 min used community health workers. rdts detect
antigens produced plasmodium parasite plasmodium falciparum
histidine-rich protein-2 (pfhpr2) plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pldh).
the accuracy rdts diagnosis uncomplicated p. falciparum infection
is equal superior routine microscopy (but inferior expert microscopy).
sensitivity plasmodium vivax 75-100%; plasmodium ovale plasmodium 
malariae, diagnostic performance poor. design limitations rdts include poor
sensitivity low parasite densities, susceptibility prozone effect
(pfhrp2-detecting rdts), false-negative results due pfhrp2 deficiency the
case pfhrp2 gene deletions (pfhrp2-detecting rdts), cross-reactions between
plasmodium antigens detection antibodies, false-positive results other
infections susceptibility heat humidity. end-user's errors relate to
safety, procedure (delayed reading, incorrect sample buffer volumes) and
interpretation (not recognizing invalid test results, disregarding faint test
lines). withholding antimalarial treatment case negative rdt results
tends infrequent tendencies towards over-prescription antibiotics
have noted. numerous shortcomings rdt kits' labelling, instructions for
use (correctness readability) contents observed. world
health organization partners actively address quality assurance rdts by
comparative testing rdts, inspections manufacturing sites, lot testing 
training tools formal external quality assessment programme end-user
performance exists. elimination malaria requires rdts lower detection
limits, nucleic acid amplification tests development.
