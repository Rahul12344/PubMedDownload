malaria parasites (genus plasmodium) diverse group found many species of
vertebrate hosts. parasites invade red blood cells complex process
comprising several proteins, many encoded multigene families, one 
merozoite surface protein 7 (msp7). case plasmodium vivax, most
geographically widespread human-infecting species, differences number of
paralogs within multigene families previously explained, least in
part, potential adaptations human host. explore msp7, we
studied orthologs closely related nonhuman primate parasites;
investigating paralog evolutionary history genetic polymorphism. the
emerging patterns compared human parasite plasmodium
falciparum. found evolution msp7 family consistent a
birth-and-death model, duplications, pseudogenizations, gene loss
events common. however, paralogs p. vivax p. falciparum had
orthologs closely related species non-human primates indicating 
the ancestors paralogs precede events leading origins as
human parasites. thus, number paralogs cannot explained an
adaptation human hosts. although functional information msp7
in p. vivax, found evidence purifying selection genetic
polymorphism paralogs well orthologs closely
related non-human primate parasites. also found evidence indicating few
of p. vivax's paralogs may diverged orthologs non-human
primates episodic positive selection. hence, may selection
when lineage leading p. vivax diverged asian non-human primates
and switched homininae. lines evidence suggest msp7 is
functionally important p. vivax.
