malaria parasites must respond stresses environmental signals to
perpetuate efficiently multistage development diverse
environments. gain insights parasite's stress response mechanisms, we
investigated conserved plasmodium protein, named plasmodj1 the
basis presence putative cysteine protease motif dj-1/pfpi
superfamily, activities, potential respond stresses role in
parasite development. plasmodj1 expressed intraerythrocytic stages 
ookinetes. expression increased 7-9-fold upon heat shock oxidative
stress due h2o2 artemisinin; expression stress-sensitive
escherichia coli mutant conferred tolerance oxidative stress, indicating 
that plasmodj1 potential sense and/or protect stresses.
recombinant plasmodj1 efficiently neutralized h2o2, facilitated renaturation of
denatured citrate synthase showed protease activity, indicating that
plasmodj1 multi-activity protein. mutation catalytic cysteine
residue, residues, reduced h2o2-neutralization activity ~90% and
significantly decreased chaperone protease activities, indicating 
activities intrinsic plasmodj1. plasmodj1 gene knockout plasmodium 
berghei anka attenuated virulence reduced oocyst production, suggesting a
major role plasmodj1 parasite development, probably depends its
multiple activities.
