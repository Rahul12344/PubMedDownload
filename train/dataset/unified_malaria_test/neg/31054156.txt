immunopolymorphism considered important aspect behind resistance 
susceptibility host infectious disease. years, researchers 
have explored many genetic factors role immune surveillance 
infectious diseases. polymorphic characters gene encoding toll-like
receptors (tlrs) play profound roles inducing differential immune responses by
the host parasitic infections. protein(s) encoded tlr gene(s) are
immensely important due ability recognizing different types of
pathogen associated molecular patterns (pamps). study reviews the
polymorphic residues present nucleotide amino acid sequence of
tlrs influence alteration inflammatory signalling pathways
promoting either susceptibility resistance major infectious diseases,
including tuberculosis, leishmaniasis, malaria filariasis. population-based
studies exploring tlr polymorphisms humans primarily emphasized discuss
the association polymorphic residues occurrence epidemiology 
of mentioned infectious diseases. principal polymorphic residues tlrs
influencing immunity infection mostly single nucleotide polymorphisms
(snps). i602s (tlr1), r677w (tlr2), p554s (tlr3), d299g (tlr4), f616l (tlr5),
s249p (tlr6), q11l (tlr7), m1v (tlr8), g1174a (tlr9) g1031t (tlr10) are
presented major influential snps shaping immunity pathogenic
infections. contribution snps structure-function relationship
of tlrs yet clear. therefore, molecular studies polymorphisms 
improve understanding genetic basis immune response pave
the way therapeutic intervention feasible way.
