background: introduction artemisinin-based combination therapy (act) 
in 2005, monitoring anti-malarial drug efficacy, includes use of
molecular tools detect known genetic markers parasite resistance, is
important first-hand information changes parasite susceptibility to
drugs ghana. study investigated plasmodium falciparum multidrug
resistance gene (pfmdr1) copy number, mutations chloroquine resistance
transporter gene (pfcrt) mutations ghanaian isolates collected seven years 
to detect trends prevalence mutations.
methods: archived filter paper blood blots collected children aged below
five years uncomplicated malaria 2003-2010 sentinel sites used.
using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr), 756 samples
were assessed pfmdr1 gene copy number. pcr restriction fragment length
polymorphism (rflp) used detect alleles pfmdr1 86 1,102 samples,
pfmdr1 184, 1034, 1042 1246 832 samples pfcrt 76 1,063 samples.
merozoite surface protein 2 (msp2) genotyping done select monoclonal
infections copy number analysis.
results: percentage isolates increased pfmdr1 copy number 4, 27,
9, 18% 2003-04, 2005-06, 2007-08 2010, respectively. significant
increasing trends prevalence pfmdr1 n86 (×(2) = 96.31, p <0.001) pfcrt
k76 (×(2) = 64.50, p <0.001) decreasing trends pfmdr1 y86 (x(2) = 38.52, p
<0.001) pfcrt t76 (x(2) = 43.49, p <0.001) observed 2003-2010. 
pfmdr1 f184 y184 prevalence showed increasing decreasing trends
respectively significant (×(2) = 7.39,p=0.060; ×(2) = 7.49, p =
0.057 respectively). pfmdr1 n86-f184-d1246 haplotype, alleged 
selected artemether-lumefantrine showed significant increasing trend (×(2) =
20.75, p < 0.001).
conclusion: increased pfmdr1 gene copy number observed isolates
analysed finding implications use act country
although resistance reported. decreasing trend prevalence 
of chloroquine resistance markers change treatment policy presents the
possibility future introduction chloroquine prophylaxis malaria
risk groups children pregnant women ghana.
