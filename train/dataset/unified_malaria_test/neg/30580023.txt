artemisinin derivatives partner drugs artemisinin combination
therapies (acts) played pivotal role global malaria mortality reduction
during last two decades. loss artemisinin efficacy due evolving
drug-resistant parasites could become serious global health threat.
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine well tolerated generally highly effective
act. implementation partner drug acts critical control of
emerging artemisinin resistance. even though artemisinin highly effective in
parasite clearance, labile human body. partner drug necessary
for killing remaining parasites pulses artemisinin ceased. a
population plasmodium falciparum parasites cambodia adjacent countries 
has become resistant piperaquine. increased copy number genes encoding 
the haemoglobinases plasmepsin ii plasmepsin iii linked with
piperaquine resistance genome-wide association studies clinical trials,
leading use increased plasmepsin ii/plasmepsin iii copy number a
molecular marker piperaquine resistance. demonstrate that
overexpression plasmepsin ii plasmepsin iii 3d7 genetic background 
failed change susceptibility p. falciparum artemisinin, chloroquine 
and piperaquine standard dose-response analysis piperaquine
survival assay. whilst plasmepsin copy number polymorphism currently
implemented molecular surveillance resistance marker, studies to
discover molecular basis piperaquine resistance potential epistatic
interactions needed.
