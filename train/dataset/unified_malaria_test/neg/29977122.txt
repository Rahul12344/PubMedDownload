background: sampling saliva diagnosing plasmodium falciparum infections is
a safe, non-invasive alternative sampling blood. however, use saliva
presents challenge lower concentrations parasite dna present 
saliva compared peripheral blood. therefore, sensitive method needed 
detection parasite dna saliva. study utilized two recently reported
"ultra-sensitive" pcr assays based detection p. falciparum
mitochondrial cox3 gene multi-copy nuclear varats gene. the
ultra-sensitive assays advantage standard 18s rrna gene-based pcr
assay target genes higher copy numbers per parasite genome. stored
saliva dna samples 60 cameroonian individuals infections previously
confirmed 18s rrna gene pcr peripheral blood tested assays
targeting cox3 varats genes.
results: overall, standard 18s rrna gene-based pcr assay detected p.
falciparum dna 62% stored saliva dna samples, whereas 77 68% the
samples positive assays target cox3 varats genes,
respectively. interestingly, ultra-sensitive assays detected p.
falciparum infections stored saliva samples originally detected by
thick-film microscopy (41/60 = 68%). stratified number parasites in
the blood, cox3 assay successfully detected 90% infections using
saliva individuals > 1000 parasites/μl peripheral blood, but
sensitivity reduced submicroscopic parasitemia levels. bands on
electrophoresis gels distinct cox3 assay, whereas faint or
non-specific bands sometimes observed varats 18s rrna made
interpretation results difficult. assays could completed 3.5 3 h for
the cox3 varats assays, respectively, whereas 18s rrna gene assays
required least 7 h.
conclusions: study demonstrates pcr assay targeting cox3 gene
detected p. falciparum dna saliva samples primers 18s rrna
gene. non-invasive collection saliva combination proposed cox3
primer-based pcr assay could potentially enhance routine testing p. falciparum
during disease surveillance, monitoring, evaluation interventions for
malaria elimination.
