translocation various proteins subcellular organelles essential
mechanism regulate metabolic pathways often vacuolar protein sorting
(vps) proteins involved transportation. plasmodium falciparum vps29
(pfvps29) predicted functional component assembly the
retromer complex; however, far detailed characterization pfvps29 its
native form yet done. report successful expression purification
of tag-free recombinant pfvps29 yield 5.6 mg 1 l escherichia
coli culture. pfvps29 purified combined anion-exchange size exclusion 
chromatography. protein showed single band sds-page exhibited
molecular mass 21.7 kda measured maldi-tof mass spectrometry. secondary 
structure elucidated circular dichroism spectroscopy. found a
monomeric protein solution evident dynamic light scattering studies,
chemical cross-linking experiments size exclusion chromatography.
subsequently, polyclonal anti-pfvps29 antibody generated used for
evaluating protein expression western blot following subcellular
localization p. falciparum confocal immunofluoroscence microscopy. pfvps29 
was found located cytoplasm expressed early trophozoite to
schizont stages maximum expression trophozoite stage. study provides
purification, biophysical characterization subcellular localization of
pfvps29 different asexual stages p. falciparum.
