background: mosquito-borne viral diseases cause significant burden much the
developing world. although host-virus interactions studied extensively 
in vertebrate host, little known mosquito responses viral
infection. contrast mosquitoes aedes culex genera, anopheles
gambiae, principal vector human malaria, naturally transmits few
arboviruses, important o'nyong-nyong virus (onnv). we
have investigated a. gambiae immune response systemic onnv infection using
forward reverse genetic approaches.
methodology/principal findings: used dna microarrays profile the
transcriptional response a. gambiae inoculated onnv investigate the
antiviral function candidate genes rnai gene silencing assays. our
results demonstrate a. gambiae responses systemic viral infection involve
genes covering aspects innate immunity including pathogen recognition,
modulation immune signalling, complement-mediated lysis/opsonisation other
immune effector mechanisms. patterns transcriptional regulation and
co-infections a. gambiae onnv rodent malaria parasite plasmodium 
berghei suggest hemolymph immune responses viral infection diverted
away melanisation. show four viral responsive genes encoding two
putative recognition receptors, galectin md2-like receptor, two
effector lysozymes, function limiting viral load.
conclusions/significance: study first step elucidating the
antiviral mechanisms a. gambiae mosquitoes, revealed interesting
differences a. gambiae invertebrates. data suggest that
mechanisms employed a. gambiae distinct described invertebrate
antiviral immunity date, involve complement-like branch humoral
immune response, supressing melanisation response prominent in
anti-parasitic immunity. antiviral immune response a. gambiae thus
composed key conserved mechanisms target viral infection rnai 
but includes diverse possibly species-specific mechanisms.
