background: impact sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) used intermittent
preventive treatment pregnancy (iptp-sp) mutant parasite selection 
been poorly documented burkina faso. study sought first explore the
relationship iptp-sp presence mutant parasites. second, to
assess relationship mutant parasites adverse pregnancy
outcomes.
methods: september december 2010, dried blood spots (dbs) collected 
during antenatal care visits delivery 109 pregnant women with
microscopically confirmed falciparum malaria infection. dbs analysed by
pcr-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) polymorphisms 
codons 51, 59, 108, 164 pfdhfr gene codons 437 540 the
pfdhps gene.
results: pfdhfr pfdhps genes successfully genotyped 92.7%
(101/109) samples. prevalence pfdhfr mutations n51i, c59r s108n
was 71.3, 42.6 64.4%, respectively. overall, 80.2% (81/101) samples
carried pfdhps a437g mutation. none samples pfdhfr i164l and
the pfdhps k540e mutations. prevalence triple mutation
n51i + c59r + s108n 25.7% (26/101). use iptp-sp associated 
threefold increased odds pfdhfr c59r mutation [crude 3.29; 95% ci
(1.44-7.50)]. pregnant women recent uptake iptp-sp higher odds of
both pfdhfr c59r mutation [adjusted 4.26; 95% ci (1.64-11.07)] the
pfdhfr intermediate-to-high resistance, i.e., ≥ 2 pfdhfr mutations [adjusted or
3.45; 95% ci (1.18-10.07)]. statistically significant association
between presence pfdhfr intermediate-to-high resistance parasite
densities maternal haemoglobin level anaemia.
conclusion: data indicate despite possibility iptp-sp
contributes selection resistant parasites, potentiate
pregnancy-associated malaria morbidity, suggesting continuation sp use 
iptp burkina faso.
