despite recommendation use merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1),
merozoite surface protein 2 (msp2), glutamate-rich protein (glurp) genes as
markers drug efficacy studies world health organization limited
use bangladesh, circulating plasmodium falciparum population genetic
structure yet assessed bangladesh. study presents a
comprehensive report circulating p. falciparum population structure based 
on msp1, msp2, glurp polymorphic gene markers bangladesh. among 130
pretreatment (day 0) p. falciparum samples seven malaria-endemic districts, 
14 distinct genotypes observed msp1, 20 msp2, 13 glurp
polyclonal infection reported 94.6% (n = 123) samples. multiplicity
of infection (moi) msp1 highest (1.5) among mois markers. 
the heterozygosity msp1, msp2, glurp 0.89, 0.93, 0.83,
respectively. data according different malaria-endemic areas also
presented discussed. bangladesh considered malaria-hypoendemic
country. however, prevalence polyclonal infection genetic
diversity p. falciparum represent hypoendemicity.
