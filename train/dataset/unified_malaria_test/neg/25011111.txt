reversible protein phosphorylation regulated kinases phosphatases controls
many cellular processes. although essential functions malaria parasite
kinome reported, roles protein phosphatases (pps) during
plasmodium development unknown. report functional analysis the
plasmodium berghei protein phosphatome, exhibits high conservation the
p. falciparum phosphatome comprises 30 predicted pps differential and
distinct expression patterns various stages life cycle. gene
disruption analysis p. berghei pps reveals half genes likely
essential asexual blood stage development, whereas six required for
sexual development/sporogony mosquitoes. phenotypic screening coupled with
transcriptome sequencing unveiled morphological changes altered gene
expression deletion mutants two n-myristoylated pps. findings provide
systematic functional analyses pps plasmodium, identify phosphatases
regulate parasite development differentiation, inform the
identification drug targets malaria.
