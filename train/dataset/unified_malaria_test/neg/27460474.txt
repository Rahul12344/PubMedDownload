background: genotyping malaria parasites assess diversity different
geographic settings become necessary selection antigenic epitopes
for vaccine development antimalarial drug efficacy resistance
investigations. study describes genetic diversity plasmodium
falciparum isolates uncomplicated malaria cases ten year period
(2003-2013) ghana using polymorphic antigenic marker, merozoite surface
protein 2 (msp2).
methods: archived filter paper blood blots children aged nine years and
below uncomplicated malaria collected nine sites ghana typed
for presence markers. total 880 samples genotyped msp2
for two major allelic families, fc27 3d7, using nested polymerase chain
reaction (pcr). allele frequencies multiplicity infection were
determined nine sites five time points period ten years,
2003-2004, 2005-2006, 2007-2008, 2010 2012-2013 malaria transmission seasons.
results: number different alleles detected msp2 gene resolving 
pcr products agarose gels 14. major allelic families, 3d7 
fc27 common population samples. highest multiplicity infection
(moi) observed isolates begoro (forest zone, rural site): 3.31 for
the time point 2007-2008. significant variation observed among sites in
the mois detected per infection (fisher's exact test, p < 0.001) 2007
isolates also three sites data three different years,
hohoe, p = 0.03; navrongo, p < 0.001; cape coast, p < 0.001. overall, was
no significant difference mois three ecological zones the
years (p = 0.37) time points data sites pooled
(p = 0.40).
conclusions: diversity variation isolates detected using msp2
gene ghanaian isolates observed profound; however, was
homogeneity throughout three ecological zones studied. indicative 
gene flow parasite populations across country probably due to
human population movements (hpm).
