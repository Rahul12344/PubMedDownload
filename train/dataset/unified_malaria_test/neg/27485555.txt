many members apicomplexa contain remnant chloroplast, known an
apicoplast. apicoplast encodes numerous genes, loss organelle is
lethal. here, present summary known apicoplast
transcription. unlike plant chloroplasts, single rna polymerase, and
initial transcription polycistronic. rna cleaved trna, mrna and
rrna molecules. significant levels antisense transcription reported,
together single case rna editing. polycistronic transcription also
observed related algae chromera vitrella, retain a
photosynthetic chloroplast. surprisingly, polyu tail added chromera and
vitrella transcripts encode proteins involved photosynthesis. such
tail added plasmodium transcripts. transcription apicomplexa is
remarkably similar seen chloroplast related peridinin
dinoflagellate algae, reflecting common evolutionary origins the
organelle.
