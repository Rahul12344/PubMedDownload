the protozoan parasite plasmodium evolved survive different hosts and
environments. diverse strategies adaptation different niches involve
differential gene expression mechanisms mediated chromatin plasticity are
poorly characterized plasmodium. parasite employs wide variety of
regulatory mechanisms complete life cycle survive inside hosts.
among them, epigenetic-mediated mechanisms implicated controlling
chromatin organization, gene regulation, morphological differentiation, and
antigenic variation. differential gene expression parasite largely
dependent nature chromatin structure. histone core methylation 
marks methyl mark readers contribute chromatin dynamics. here, review
the recent developments various epigenetic marks enzymes the
plasmodium falciparum, marks play key role regulation of
transcriptional activity variable genes coordinate differential gene
expression. also discuss possible roles epigenetic marks in
chromatin structure regulation plasticity various stages its
development.
