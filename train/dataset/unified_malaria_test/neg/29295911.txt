plasmodium parasites related pathogens contain essential nonphotosynthetic
plastid organelle, apicoplast, derived secondary endosymbiosis.
intriguingly, highly conserved eukaryotic protein, autophagy-related protein 8 
(atg8), autophagy-independent function apicoplast. little known 
about novel apicoplast function atg8 importance blood-stage
plasmodium falciparum using p. falciparum strain atg8 expression was
conditionally regulated, showed p. falciparum atg8 (pfatg8) essential 
for parasite replication. significantly, growth inhibition caused loss 
pfatg8 reversed addition isopentenyl pyrophosphate (ipp), was
previously shown rescue apicoplast defects p. falciparum parasites
deficient pfatg8, whose growth rescued ipp, lost their
apicoplast. designed suite functional assays, including new
fluorescence situ hybridization (fish) method detection the
low-copy-number apicoplast genome, interrogate specific steps apicoplast
biogenesis detect apicoplast defects preceded block parasite
replication. though protein import membrane expansion apicoplast 
unaffected, apicoplast inherited daughter parasites. findings 
demonstrate that, though multiple autophagy-dependent independent functions
have proposed pfatg8, role apicoplast biogenesis is
essential blood-stage parasites. propose pfatg8 required for
fission segregation apicoplast parasite

evolutionarily distant traditional model organisms possess unique
