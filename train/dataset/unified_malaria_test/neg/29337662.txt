novel approaches area-wide control vector species offer promise as
additional tools fight vectored diseases. evaluation transgenic
insect strains aimed field population control disease-endemic countries may
involve international partnerships done stepwise approach,
starting studies containment facilities. preparations both
new-build renovated facilities described, including working local
and national regulations regarding land use, construction, biosafety
requirements, well international guidance fill gaps regulation.
the examples given containment categorization arthropod containment
level 2 initial facility design, classification wastes, precautions
during shipping. specific lessons derived preparations evaluate
transgenic (non-gene drive) mosquitoes west east african countries.
documented procedures use non-transgenic training strain trial
shipments culturing used develop competence confidence among 
african facility staff, along chain custody transport. this
practical description offered support research consortia or
institutions preparing containment facilities operating procedures in
conditions research transgenic insects early stage.
