with relatively known specific transcription factors control abundance
of specific mrnas, plasmodium parasites may rely regulation of
transcript stability turnover provide sufficient gene regulation.
plasmodium transmission stages impose translational repression specific
transcripts part accomplish this. however, proteins known to
participate process, characterized primarily affect
female gametocytes. identified characterized plasmodium yoelii (py)
ccr4-1, putative deadenylase, plays role development and
activation male gametocytes, regulates abundance specific mrnas in
gametocytes, ultimately increases efficiency host-to-vector
transmission. find pyccr4-1 deleted protein made
catalytically inactive, loss initial coordination male
gametocyte maturation reduction parasite infectivity mosquito.
expression n-terminal caf1 domain essential caf1 deadenylase
leads similar phenotype. comparative rna-seq revealed pyccr4-1 affects 
transcripts important transmission-related functions associated with
male female gametocytes, directly associate the
immunoprecipitated complex. finally, circular rt-pcr one bound,
dysregulated transcripts showed deletion pyccr4-1 gene not

two putative deadenylases caf1/ccr4/not complex play critical and
intertwined roles gametocyte maturation transmission.
