malaria dangerous disease spread across several countries. recent studies
have focused medicinal plants discover alternative agents currently 
used drugs malaria treatment. here, investigated potential role of
indigofera oblongifolia leaf extract (ie) hepatic inflammation mice with
plasmodium chabaudi-infected erythrocytes. female c57bl/6 mice divided 
three groups. first group served control noninfected group, the
second third groups intraperitoneally injected 106 erythrocytes
parasitized p. chabaudi. mice third group treated daily a
dose 100 mg/kg ie 7 days. ie significantly reduced number of
leukocytes apoptotic cells. numbers cd68-positive cells decreased in
the livers mice treatment group. moreover, ie raised hepatic
antioxidant levels (glutathione catalase) reduced levels hepatic
oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, reactive oxygen
species). ie regulated functions genes related immune responses,
including apoptotic genes (b-cell lymphoma-2, bax, caspase-3) cytokine
genes (interleukin-1β (il-1β), il-6, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α). 
therefore, ie exerts significant effects malaria protects liver
from injury caused p. chabaudi via antioxidant anti-inflammatory ways.
