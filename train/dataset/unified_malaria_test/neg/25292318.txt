constant extensive use chemical insecticides created selection
pressure favored resistance development many insect species worldwide. one
of important pyrethroid resistance mechanisms classified target
site insensitivity, due conformational changes target site impair 
a proper binding insecticide molecule. voltage-gated sodium channel
(nav) target pyrethroids ddt insecticides, used control insects 
of medical, agricultural veterinary importance, anophelines. has
been reported presence non-silent point mutations nav
gene associated pyrethroid resistance, termed 'kdr' (knockdown
resistance) preventing knockdown effect insecticides. the
presence mutations, well effects, thoroughly
studied anopheles mosquitoes. far, kdr mutations already detected
in least 13 species (anopheles gambiae, anopheles arabiensis, anopheles
sinensis, anopheles stephensi, anopheles subpictus, anopheles sacharovi,
anopheles culicifacies, anopheles sundaicus, anopheles aconitus, anopheles vagus,
anopheles paraliae, anopheles peditaeniatus anopheles albimanus) from
populations african, asian and, recently, american continents. seven
mutational variants (l1014f, l1014s, l1014c, l1014w, n1013s, n1575y v1010l)
were described, highest prevalence l1014f, occurs 1014

mutations clearly shows importance mechanism process of
pyrethroid resistance. sense, several species-specific highly
sensitive methods designed order genotype individual mosquitoes
for kdr large scale, may serve important tolls monitoring the

investigations concerning course plasmodium infection kdr individuals. 
considering limitation insecticides available employment public

malaria parasites, use pyrethroids likely remain main
strategy mosquitoes either indoor residual spraying (ir) and
insecticide treated nets (itn). therefore, monitoring insecticide resistance
programs crucial need malaria endemic countries.
