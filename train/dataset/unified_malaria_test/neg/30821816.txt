background: here, created automated pipeline de novoassembly of
genomes pacific biosciences long-read illumina short-read data using
common workflow language (cwl). evaluate performance pipeline, 
assembled nuclear genomes eukaryotes caenorhabditis elegans (∼100 mb),
drosophila melanogaster (∼138 mb), plasmodium falciparum (∼23 mb) directly
from publicly accessible nucleotide sequence datasets assessed quality of
the assemblies curated reference genomes.
findings: showed dependency accuracy assembly sequencing
technology gc content repeatedly achieved assemblies meet high
standards set national human genome research institute, applicable
to gene prediction subsequent genomic analyses.
conclusions: cwl pipeline overcomes current challenges achieving
repeatability reproducibility assembly results offers platform for
the re-use workflow integration diverse datasets. workflow
is publicly available via github (https://github.com/vetscience/assemblosis) 
is currently applicable assembly haploid diploid genomes of
eukaryotes.
