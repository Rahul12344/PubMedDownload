autophagy, lysosome-mediated self-degradation process, implicated in
survival starvation yeast, dictyostelium animals. these
eukaryotic taxa (collectively called unikonts), autophagy induced primarily
through atg1/ulk1 complex response nutrient depletion. autophagy has
also well-studied non-unikont parasites, trypanosoma and
plasmodium, found important life-cycle transitions. however, how
autophagy induced non-unikonts remains largely unrevealed. using a
bioinformatics approach, examined presence atg1 complex in
the genomes 40 non-unikonts. found genomes encode typical
atg1 proteins: blast hmmer queries matched kinase domain of
atg1, segments responsible regulation protein-binding were
missing. non-unikonts also lacked components atg1-inducing complex. 
orthologs alternative autophagy inducer, atg6 found half
of species, indicating half may possess inducing
mechanisms. key autophagy genes differential expression patterns during
life-cycle, raise possibility autophagy protists induced 
mainly post-transcriptional level. understanding atg1-independent
autophagy induction mechanisms parasites may lead novel
pharmacological interventions, affecting human atg1-dependent autophagy.
