the immune response malaria patients main factor influencing clinical
severity malaria. tight regulation cd4+ cell response the
induction tolerance proposed contribute protection severe
or clinical disease. therefore compared cd4+ cell phenotypes ghanaian
children complicated malaria, uncomplicated malaria, asymptomatic plasmodium
falciparum (pf) infection infection. using flow cytometric analysis and
automated multivariate clustering, characterized expression the
co-inhibitory molecules ctla-4, pd-1, tim-3, lag-3 molecules
implicated regulatory function cd4+ cells. children complicated
malaria higher frequencies ctla-4+ pd-1+ cd4+ cells children
with uncomplicated malaria. conversely, children uncomplicated malaria
showed higher proportion cd4+ cells expressing cd39 granzyme b,
compared children complicated malaria. contrast, asymptomatically
infected children expressed low levels co-inhibitory molecules. thus,
different cd4+ cell phenotypes associated complicated versus
uncomplicated malaria, suggesting two-sided role cd4+ cells malaria
pathogenesis protection. deciphering signals shape cd4+ cell
phenotype malaria important new treatment immunization
strategies.
