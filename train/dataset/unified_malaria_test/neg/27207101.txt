background: search vaccine malaria caused plasmodium
falciparum lasted 100 years, considerable progress 
identification number vaccine candidates. post-genomic era offers new
opportunities expedited search using rational vaccine design and
prioritization key b-cell epitopes involved natural acquired immunity.
methods: malaria vaccine candidate genes reached clinical trial were
searched evolutionary relationship tree, determine level of
lineage-specificity. ten genes similar protein features level of
lineage specificity vaccine candidates randomly selected, and
computationally evaluated presence b-cell epitopes. protein
fragment maximum probability putative epitopes synthesized used 
in elisa experiment determine presence antibodies peptides,
in serum malaria patients healthy malaria uninfected inhabitants 
a malaria endemic region (bolifamba), alongside vaccine candidate eba-175.
results: two peptide fragments 25 30 amino acid length pf3d7_1233400 
and pf3d7_1437500 respectively, coded pf4-123 pf4-143 shown to
contain b-cell epitope(s). total igg antibodies peptides not
significantly different sick healthy participants, cytophilic
antibodies peptides significantly higher healthy participants
(p < 0.03). total igg vaccine candidate eba-175 significantly higher
in sick participants healthy participants, likewise cytophilic antibodies
(p < 0.04). antibodies peptides pf4-123 pf4-143 correlated negatively 
(p = 0.025 0.008 r = -0.291 -0.345, respectively) parasite load.
total igg antibodies eba-175 showed negative correlation parasite load
(r = -0.144), significant (p = 0.276). duration stay in
bolifamba also negatively correlated parasite load (p = 0.026, r = -0.419)
and total igg pf4-143 significantly associated prolonged duration 
stay locality bolifamba, cameroon (p = 0.006, r = 0.361).
conclusions: present study identified two genes pf3d7_1233400 and
pf3d7_1437500 containing peptide fragment (pf4-123 pf4-143) b-cell
epitopes correlated naturally acquired immunity malaria. a
pipeline developed rapid identification b-cell epitopes
involved naturally acquired immunity.
