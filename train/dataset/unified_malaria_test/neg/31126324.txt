background: elimination malaria depends mastering transmission and
understanding biological basis plasmodium infection vector. the
first mosquito organ interact parasite midgut its
transcriptomic characterization infection reveal effective
antiplasmodial responses able limit survival parasite. vector
response plasmodium vivax fully characterized, specificities
when compared malaria parasites fundamental interest for
specific control measures.
methods: experimental infections performed using membrane-feeding device. 
three groups used: p. vivax-blood-fed, blood-fed inactivated gametocytes,
and unfed mosquitoes. twenty-four hours feeding, mosquitoes were
dissected midgut collected transcriptomic analysis using rnaseq. nine
cdna libraries generated sequenced illumina hiseq2500. readings
were checked quality control analysed using trinity platform de
novo transcriptome assembly. transcript quantification performed the
transcriptome functionally annotated. differential expression gene analysis
was carried out. role identified mechanisms explored using
functional approaches.
results: forty-nine genes identified differentially expressed 
p. vivax infection: 34 upregulated 15 downregulated. half p.
vivax-related differentially expressed genes could related autophagy;
therefore, effect known inhibitor (wortmannin) activator
(spermidine) tested infection outcome. autophagic activation
significantly reduced intensity prevalence infection. was
associated transcription alterations autophagy regulating genes
beclin, dram apg8.
conclusions: data indicate p. vivax invasion an. aquasalis midgut
epithelium triggers autophagic response activation reduces infection. 
this suggests novel mechanism mosquitoes use fight plasmodium
infection.
