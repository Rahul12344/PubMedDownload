the development highly efficacious durable vaccine malaria remains a
top priority global health researchers. despite huge rise recognition 
of malaria global health problem concurrent rise funding the
past 10-15 years, malaria continues remain widespread burden. evidence
of increasing resistance anti-malarial drugs insecticides growing
concern. hence, efficacious durable preventative vaccine malaria is
urgently needed. vaccines one cost-effective tools have
successfully used prevention control many diseases, however,
the development vaccine plasmodium parasite proved difficult.
given early success whole sporozoite mosquito-bite delivered vaccination
strategies, know vaccine malaria achievable goal, with
sub-unit vaccines holding great promise simple cheap both
manufacture deploy. however major difficulty development sub-unit
vaccines lies within choosing appropriate antigenic target 5000 or
so genes expressed parasite. given liver-stage malaria represents a
bottle-neck parasite's life cycle, widespread agreement a
multi-component sub-unit malaria vaccine preferably contain liver-stage 
target. article review progress identifying screening
plasmodium falciparum liver-stage targets use malaria vaccine.
