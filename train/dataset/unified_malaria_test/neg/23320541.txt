histone variants key components epigenetic code evolved perform
specific functions transcriptional regulation, dna repair, chromosome
segregation fundamental processes. although variants histone h2a
and h3 found throughout eukaryotic kingdom, variants histone h2b and
h4 rarely encountered. h2b.z one rare h2b variants is
apicomplexan-specific. show plasmodium falciparum h2b.z localizes
to euchromatic intergenic regions throughout intraerythrocytic development and
together h2a.z forms double-variant nucleosome subtype. nucleosomes 
are enriched promoters 3' intergenic regions occupancy
generally correlates strength promoter, temporal
activity. remarkably, h2b.z occupancy levels exhibit clear correlation the
base-composition underlying dna, raising intriguing possibility that
the extreme content intergenic regions within plasmodium genome
might instructive histone variant deposition. summary, data show
that h2a.z/h2b.z double-variant nucleosome demarcates putative regulatory
regions p. falciparum epigenome likely provides scaffold dynamic
regulation gene expression deadly human pathogen.
