apicoplast, nonphotosynthetic plastid derived secondary symbiotic origin, 
is essential survival malaria parasites genus plasmodium.
elucidation evolution apicoplast genome plasmodium species is
important better understand functions organelle. however, the
complete apicoplast genome available virulent human malaria 
parasite, plasmodium falciparum. here, obtained near-complete apicoplast
genome sequences eight plasmodium species infect wide variety of
vertebrate hosts performed structural phylogenetic analyses. found
that gene repertoire, gene arrangement, structural attributes were
highly conserved. phylogenetic reconstruction using 30 protein-coding genes of
the apicoplast genome inferred, first time, close relationship 
p. ovale rodent parasites. close relatedness robustly supported
using multiple evolutionary assumptions models. finding suggests 
ancestral host switch occurred rodent human plasmodium parasites.
