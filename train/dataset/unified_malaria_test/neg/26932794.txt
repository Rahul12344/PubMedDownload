background: republic yemen highest incidence malaria the
arabian peninsula, yet little known vectors transmission dynamics.
methods: 24-month study vectors related epidemiological aspects of
malaria transmission conducted two villages taiz region in
2004-2005.
results: cross-sectional blood film surveys recorded overall malaria infection
rate 15.3 % (250/1638), highest rates exceeding 30 % one village in
may december 2005. one exception, plasmodium malariae, infections
were p. falciparum. seven anopheles species identified among 3407
anophelines collected indoors using light traps (lt) pyrethrum knockdown
catches (pkd): anopheles arabiensis (86.9 %), an. sergentii (9 %), an. azaniae,
an. dthali, an. pretoriensis, an. coustani an. algeriensis. sequences the
standard barcode region mitochondrial coi gene confirmed presence of
two morphological forms an. azaniae, typical form previously
unrecognized form immediately identifiable an. azaniae. elisa detected
plasmodium sporozoites 0.9 % 2921 an. arabiensis (23 p. falciparum, two p. 
vivax) confirming species primary malaria vector yemen. plasmodium
falciparum sporozoites detected an. sergentii (2/295) single female
of an. algeriensis, incriminating species malaria vectors first
time yemen. vector wet dry seasons, an. arabiensis was
predominantly anthropophilic (human blood index = 0.86) entomological
inoculation rate 1.58 infective bites/person/year. anopheles sergentii fed 
cattle (67.3 %) humans (48.3; 20.7 % mixed species), 14.7 %
were found pkds, indicating predominantly exophilic behaviour. gis analysis 
of geographic socio-economic parameters revealed an. arabiensis were
significantly higher (p < 0.001) houses televisions, likely due to
the popular evening habit viewing television collectively houses open 
doors windows.
conclusions: predominantly indoor human biting vectors recorded study
could targeted effectively llins, indoor residual spraying and/or
insecticide-treated window/door curtains reinforced education instil a
perception effective affordable malaria prevention achievable.
