the mode action many antimalarial drugs unknown. chemogenomic profiling 
is powerful method address issue. experimental approach entails
disruption gene function phenotypic screening changes sensitivity
to bioactive compounds. here, describe application reverse genetics for
chemogenomic profiling plasmodium. plasmodium falciparum parasites harbouring 
a transgenic insertion glms ribozyme downstream dihydrofolate
reductase-thymidylate synthase (dhfr-ts) gene used chemogenomic
profiling antimalarial compounds identify target dhfr-ts.
dhfr-ts expression attenuated exposing parasites glucosamine.
parasites attenuated dhfr-ts expression significantly sensitive to
antifolate drugs known target dhfr-ts. contrast, change sensitivity
to antimalarial drugs different modes action observed.
chemogenomic profiling performed using medicines malaria venture
(switzerland) malaria box compound library, two compounds identified 
novel dhfr-ts inhibitors. also tested glms ribozyme plasmodium berghei,
a rodent malaria parasite. expression reporter genes downstream glms 
ribozyme could attenuated transgenic parasites comparable that
obtained p. falciparum. chemogenomic profiling method applied p. 
berghei line expressing pyrimethamine-resistant toxoplasma gondii dhfr-ts
reporter gene glms ribozyme control. parasites attenuated expression
of gene significantly sensitised antifolates targeting dhfr-ts, 
not drugs different modes action. conclusion, data show
that glms ribozyme reverse genetic tool applied identifying
primary targets antimalarial compounds human rodent malaria parasites.
