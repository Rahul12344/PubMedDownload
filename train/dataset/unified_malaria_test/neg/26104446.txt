the severe form human malaria caused protozoan parasite
plasmodium falciparum. parasites invade replicate within the
circulating red blood cells infected individuals leading numerous disease
manifestations, including severe anemia, altered circulation, tissue
inflammation. malaria parasites also known ability maintain a
chronic infection antigenic variation, ability systematically
alter antigens displayed surface infected cells thereby avoid
clearance host's antibody response. genome p. falciparum includes
several large, multicopy gene families encode highly variable forms the
surface proteins targets host immunity. alterations expression
of genes within families responsible antigenic variation. this
process requires continuous generation new antigenic variants within these
gene families, studies shown new variants arise extensive
recombination gene conversion events family members. malaria
parasites possess unusual complement dna repair pathways, thus study of
recombination variant antigen encoding genes provides unique view 
the evolution mobile dna organism distantly related closely 
studied model eukaryotes.
