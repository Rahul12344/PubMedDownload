in study, samples 2013-2016 west african ebola virus outbreak 
patients guinea ebola virus disease (evd) analyzed discover and
classify pathogens present. throat swabs taken deceased
evd patients, peripheral blood samples analyzed taken from
patients presented treatment center acute illness.
high-throughput rna sequencing (rna-seq) bioinformatics used identify
the potential microorganisms. approach confirmed ebola virus (ebov) all
samples patients diagnosed acute positive virus quantitative
reverse transcription-pcr deployed field laboratories. nucleic acid mapping to
plasmodium also used patient samples, confirming results obtained with
an antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (rdt) conducted field laboratories.
the data suggested high plasmodium load, determined sequence read
depth, associated mortality influenced host response, whereas 
lower parasite load appear affect outcome. identifications of
selected bacteria throat swabs via rna-seq confirmed culture. the
data indicated potential pathogens identified blood samples 
associated translocation gut, suggesting presence of
bacteremia, transcriptome data suggested may induce aggravate the
acute-phase response observed evd. transcripts mapping different
viruses also identified, including indicative lytic infections. the
development high-resolution analysis samples patients evd will
help inform care pathways appropriate general antimicrobial therapy 
to used resource-poor setting. importance results highlight the
identification array pathogens blood patients ebola virus
disease (evd). done before, data important
implications treatment patients evd, particularly considering
antibiotic stewardship. show evd patients also infected with
plasmodium, particularly higher loads, adverse outcomes patients
with lower levels plasmodium. however, presence plasmodium not
influence innate immune response, likely presence ebov 
dominated response. several viruses ebov identified, and
bacteria associated sepsis also identified. findings were
indicative bacterial translocation across gut acute phase of
evd.
