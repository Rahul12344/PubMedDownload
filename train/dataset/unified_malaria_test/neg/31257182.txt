plasmodium parasites undergo obligatory asymptomatic developmental stage
within liver infecting red blood cells cause malaria. hijacked 
host pathways critical parasite infection hepatic phase remain
poorly understood. here, implemented forward genetic screen identify over
100 host factors within human druggable genome critical to
p. berghei infection hepatoma cells. notably, found knockdown genes
involved protein trafficking pathways detrimental parasite infection.
the disruption protein trafficking modulators, including copb2 gga1,
decreases p. berghei parasite size, immunofluorescence study suggests that
these proteins recruited plasmodium parasitophorous vacuole in
infected hepatocytes. findings reveal various host intracellular
protein trafficking pathways subverted plasmodium parasites the
liver stage provide new insights manipulation growth and
development.
