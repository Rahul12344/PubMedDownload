background: although well known drug pressure selects for
drug-resistant parasites, role transmission reduction by
insecticide-treated bed nets (itns) drug resistance remains unclear. this
study, drug resistance profile current previous first-line
anti-malarials kenya assessed within context drug policy change and
scale-up itns. national first-line treatment changed chloroquine (cq) 
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) 1998 artemether-lumefantrine (al) in
2004. itn use scaled-up asembo, gem karemo areas western kenya 
in 1997, 1999 2006, respectively.
methods: smear-positive samples (n = 253) collected 2007 cross-sectional
survey among children asembo, gem karemo genotyped mutations in
pfcrt pfmdr1 (cq), dhfr dhps (sp), pfmdr-n86 gene copy
number pfmdr1 (lumefantrine). results compared among three geographic
areas 2007 retrospective molecular data children asembo in
2001.
results: 2007, 69 85% samples harboured pfmdr1-86y mutation and
dhfr/dhps quintuple mutant, respectively, significant differences by
study area. however, prevalence pfcrt-76t mutation differed
significantly among areas (p <0.02), 76 94%, highest
prevalence asembo. several 2007 samples carried mutations dhfr-164l,
dhps-436a, dhps-613t. 2001 2007, significant increases in
the pfcrt-76t mutation 82 94% (p <0.03), dhfr/dhps quintuple mutant 
62 82% (p <0.03), increase septuple cq sp combined mutant
haplotype, k 76 86 51 r 59 n 108 g 437 e 540 , 28 39%. prevalence
of pfmdr1-86y mutation remained unchanged. samples single copy for
pfmdr1.
conclusions: molecular markers associated lumefantrine resistance not
detected 2007. recent samples needed detect selective
effects al. prevalence cq sp resistance markers increased 2001
to 2007 absence changes transmission intensity. 2007, the
prevalence pfcrt-76t mutation differed among study areas varying
transmission intensity. resistant parasites likely selected by
sustained drug pressure continued use cq, sp, mechanistically
similar drugs, amodiaquine cotrimoxazole. clear evidence
that differences transmission intensity, result itn scale-up,
influenced prevalence drug resistance molecular markers.
