background: malaria devastating disease plasmodium falciparum the
most lethal parasite infecting humans. understanding biology parasite
is vital identifying potential novel drug targets. every 48-hour
intra-erythrocytic asexual replication cycle, single parasite produce to
32 progeny. extensive proliferation implies parasites require
substantial amounts lipid precursors membrane biogenesis. glycerol kinase 
is highly conserved enzyme functions interface lipid synthesis
and carbohydrate metabolism. p. falciparum glycerol kinase catalyzes the
atp-dependent phosphorylation glycerol glycerol-3-phosphate, major
phospholipid precursor.
methods: p. falciparum glycerol kinase gene disrupted using double
crossover homologous dna recombination generate knockout parasite line.
southern hybridization mrna analysis used verify gene disruption.
parasite growth rates monitored flow cytometry. radiolabelling studies
were used assess incorporation glycerol parasite phospholipids.
results: disruption p. falciparum glycerol kinase gene produced viable
parasites, growth significantly reduced 56.5±1.8% compared 
to wild type parasites. (14)c-glycerol incorporation major phospholipids
of parasite membrane, phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine, was
48.4±10.8% 53.1±5.7% relative equivalent number wild type parasites.
conclusions: p. falciparum glycerol kinase required optimal
intra-erythrocytic asexual parasite development. exogenous glycerol may used
as alternative carbon source p. falciparum phospholipid biogenesis,
despite lack glycerol kinase generate glycerol-3-phosphate.
general significance: studies provide new insight glycerolipid
metabolism p. falciparum.
