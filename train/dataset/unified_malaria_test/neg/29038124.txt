immunity plasmodium falciparum malaria slow develop, often
asserted malaria suppresses host immunity, although poorly
understood molecular basis activity remains unknown. p.
falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1) virulence factor that
plays key role parasite-host interactions. investigated the
immunosuppressive effect pfemp1 monocytes/macrophages, central to
the antiparasitic innate response. raw macrophages human primary monocytes
were stimulated wild-type 3d7 cs2 parasites transgenic pfemp1-null
parasites. study immunomodulatory effect pfemp1, transcription factor
activation cytokine chemokine responses measured. level of
activation nf-κb significantly lower macrophages stimulated with
parasites express pfemp1 red blood cell surface membrane in
macrophages stimulated pfemp1-null parasites. modulation additional
transcription factors, including creb, also occurred, resulting reduced immune
gene expression decreased tumor necrosis factor (tnf) interleukin-10
(il-10) release. similarly, human monocytes released less il-1β, il-6, il-10,
monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (mcp-1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1α
(mip-1α), mip-1β, tnf specifically response var2csa pfemp1-containing
parasites response pfemp1-null parasites, suggesting immune 
regulation pfemp1 important naturally occurring infections. these
results indicate pfemp1 immunomodulatory molecule affects the
activation range transcription factors, dampening cytokine chemokine 
responses. therefore, findings describe potential molecular basis for
immune suppression p. falciparum.
