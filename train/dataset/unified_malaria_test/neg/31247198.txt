the malaria parasite sporozoite sequentially invades mosquito salivary glands and
mammalian hepatocytes; plasmodium lifecycle infective form mediating
parasite transmission mosquito vector. identification several
sporozoite-specific secretory proteins involved invasion revealed that
sporozoite motility specific recognition target cells crucial for
transmission. also demonstrated components invasion 
machinery conserved erythrocytic asexual transmission stage
parasites. application sporozoite stage-specific gene knockdown system
in rodent malaria parasite, plasmodium berghei, enables us investigate the
roles proteins previously intractable study due essentiality 
for asexual intraerythrocytic stage development, stage transgenic
parasites derived. here, focused rhoptry neck protein 11 (ron11)
that contains multiple transmembrane domains putative calcium-binding ef-hand
domains. pbron11 localised rhoptry organelles merozoites and
sporozoites. repress pbron11 expression exclusively sporozoites, we
produced transgenic parasites using promoter-swapping strategy.
pbron11-repressed sporozoites showed significant reduction attachment and
motility vitro, consequently failed efficiently invade salivary glands.
pbron11 also determined essential sporozoite infection the
liver, first step transmission vertebrate host. ron11 is
demonstrated crucial sporozoite invasion target host cells -
mosquito salivary glands mammalian hepatocytes - via involvement in
sporozoite motility.
