histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibitors intensively pursued potential 
new drugs range diseases, including malaria. hdac inhibitors also
important tools study epigenetic mechanisms, transcriptional control, 
and important cellular processes. study effects three
structurally related antimalarial hdac inhibitors p. falciparum malaria
parasite gene expression compared. three hydroxamate-based compounds,
trichostatin (tsa), suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (saha; vorinostatÂ®) a
2-aminosuberic acid derivative (2-asa-9), caused profound transcriptional
effects, ~2-21% genes >2-fold altered expression following 2 h
exposure compounds. two genes, alpha tubulin ii hydrolase, were
up-regulated three compounds 2 h exposure biological
replicates examined. transcriptional changes observed 2 h exposure to
hdac inhibitors found largely transitory, 1-5% genes
being regulated removing compounds culturing 2 h.
despite structural similarity, three inhibitors caused quite diverse
transcriptional effects, possibly reflecting subtle differences mode action
or cellular distribution. dataset represents important contribution to
our understanding hdac inhibitors act malaria parasites identifies 
alpha tubulin ii potential transcriptional marker hdac inhibition in
malaria parasites may able exploited future development hdac
inhibitors new antimalarial agents.
