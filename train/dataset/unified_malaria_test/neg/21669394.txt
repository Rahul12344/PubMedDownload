while subunit vaccines shown partial efficacy clinical trials,
radiation-attenuated sporozoites (ras) remain "gold standard" sterilizing
protection plasmodium infection human vaccinees. variability in
immunogenicity replication introduced extensive, random dna damage
necessary generate ras could overcome genetically attenuated parasites
(gap) designed via gene deletion arrest defined points liver-stage
development. here, demonstrate principle late liver stage-arresting
gap induce larger broader cd8 cell responses provide superior
protection inbred outbred mice compared ras early-arresting gap
immunizations. late liver stage-arresting gap also engender high levels of
cross-stage cross-species protection complete protection when
administered translationally relevant intradermal subcutaneous routes.
collectively, results underscore potential utility late liver
stage-arresting gap broadly protective next-generation live-attenuated malaria
vaccines support potential powerful model identifying antigens
to generate cross-stage protection.
