the alveolates comprise three well-studied protist lineages significant
environmental, medical, economical importance: apicomplexans (e.g.,
plasmodium), dinoflagellates (e.g., symbiodinium), ciliates (e.g.,
tetrahymena). major lineages evolved distinct unusual
characteristics, origins proved difficult evolutionary
puzzles. mitochondrial genomes prime example: three groups depart 
canonical form content, different ways. reconstructing ancient
transitions difficult without deep-branching lineages retain ancestral
characteristics. describe two lineages illuminate the
ancestral state alveolate mitochondrial genomes. established five clonal
cultures colponemids, predatory alveolates without cultured representatives
and molecular data. colponemids represent least two independent lineages at
the phylum level multilocus phylogenetic analysis; one sister apicomplexans
and dinoflagellates, deeper position. genome survey one
strain showed ancestral state mitochondrial genomes three
major alveolate lineages consisted of an unusual linear chromosome telomeres
and substantially larger gene set known alveolates. colponemid sequences
also identified several environmental lineages colponemids, altogether
suggesting untapped potential understanding origin evolution of
apicomplexans, dinoflagellates, ciliates.
