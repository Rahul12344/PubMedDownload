background: gene expression controlled multiple levels, including
transcription, stability, translation, degradation. years, has
become apparent plasmodium falciparum exerts limited transcriptional control
of gene expression, least part plasmodium's genome controlled by
post-transcriptional mechanisms. generate insights mechanisms that
regulate gene expression post-transcriptional level, undertook
complementary computational, comparative genomics, experimental approaches to
identify characterize mrna-binding proteins (mrbps) p. falciparum.
results: close 1000 rna-binding proteins identified hidden markov model
searches, mrbps encompass relatively large proportion parasite 
proteome compared eukaryotes. several abundant mrna-binding domains
are enriched apicomplexan parasites, strong depletion mrna-binding
domains involved rna degradation observed. next, experimentally capture 
199 proteins interact mrna blood stages, 64 with
high confidence. captured mrbps show significant overlap in
silico identified candidate rbps (p < 0.0001). among experimentally validated
mrbps many known translational regulators active stages the
parasite's life cycle, dozi, cith, pfcelf2, musashi, pfalba1-4.
finally, also detect several proteins rna-binding domain abundant in
apicomplexans (rap domain) almost exclusively found apicomplexan
parasites.
conclusions: collectively, results provide complete comparative
genomics experimental analysis mrbps p. falciparum. better
understanding regulatory proteins give insight the
intricate parasite life cycle may also provide targets novel therapeutic 
strategies.
