background: past several years, thousands micrornas (mirnas) have
been identified genomes various insects cloning sequencing 
or even computational prediction. however, number mirnas identified 
anopheline species low little known role. mosquito
anopheles funestus one dominant malaria vectors africa, which
infects kills millions people every year. therefore, small rna molecules
isolated four life stages (eggs, larvae, pupae unfed adult females) 
of an. funestus sequenced using next generation sequencing technology.
results: high throughput sequencing four replicates combination with
computational analysis identified 107 mature mirna sequences expressed an.
funestus mosquito. include 20 novel mirnas without sequence identity any
organism eight mirnas previously reported anopheles genus 
known non-anopheles mosquitoes. finally, changes expression of
mirnas mosquito development determined analysis showed
that many mirnas stage-specific expression, co-transcribed and
co-regulated development.
conclusions: study presents first direct experimental evidence mirnas
in an. funestus first profiling study mirna associated the
maturation mosquito. overall, results indicate mirnas play
important roles growth development. silencing molecules 
specific life stage could decrease vector population therefore interrupt 
malaria transmission.
