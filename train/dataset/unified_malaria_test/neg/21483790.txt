upon invading host erythrocyte, human malaria parasite p. falciparum
lives replicates within membrane bound compartment referred the
parasitophorous vacuole. recently, interest compartment protein
content grown, due important roles play parasite egress and
protein traffic host cell. surprisingly, function many proteins
within compartment experimentally addressed. here, study the
importance one proteins, termed pfpv1, intra-erythrocytic
parasite survival. despite numerous attempts inactivate gene encoding
pfpv1, unable recover deletion mutants. control experiments verified
that pv1 gene locus per se open gene targeting experiments, allowing 
us exclude technical limitations experimental strategy. data
provide strong genetic evidence pfpv1 essential survival blood
stage p. falciparum, highlight importance parasitophorous
vacuole proteins part parasite's life cycle.
