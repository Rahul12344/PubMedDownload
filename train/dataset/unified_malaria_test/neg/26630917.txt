background: plasmodium falciparum, causative agent severe human malaria,
is early-diverging protozoan whose lifecycle many unusual features,
including modes replication. research plasmodium cell cycle, 
occurs primarily via schizogony instead canonical binary fission, been
hampered lack tools markers transferred cell cycle
studies model organisms. common tool used study dna replication the
cell cycle human cells labelling newly-replicated dna the
modified nucleotide bromodeoxyuridine (brdu), followed immunofluorescent
detection. plasmodium parasites, however, incorporate brdu they
rely de novo synthesis pyrimidines salvage thymidine
analogues like brdu conversion nucleotides.
methods: analysis biochemical pathways plasmodium indicated the
absence enzyme thymidine kinase (tk) may impediment brdu
incorporation organism. tk gene herpes simplex was, therefore,
introduced plasmodium falciparum 3d7 strain effect brdu
labelling assessed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and
immunofluorescence microscopy.
results: introduction tk gene produces parasites indeed incorporate
brdu. forms sensitive indicator dna replication, detected 
by quantitative qualitative assays either population level a
single-cell level. plasmodium falciparum, expressing tk, becomes unusually
sensitive brdu toxicity.
conclusions: brdu labelling represents significant new tool investigating
dna replication cell cycle plasmodium.
