background: examining essential biochemical pathways plasmodium falciparum
presents serious challenges, standard molecular techniques sirna
cannot employed organism, generating gene knock-outs essential 
proteins requires specialized conditional approaches. study protein
kinases, pharmacological inhibition presents feasible alternative option.
however, mammalian systems, inhibitors often lack desired selectivity. 
described chemical genetic approach selectively inhibit pfnek-2 in
p. falciparum, member nima-related kinase family essential for
completion sexual development parasite.
results: introduction valine cysteine mutation position 24 the
glycine rich loop pfnek-2 affect kinase activity confers
sensitivity protein kinase inhibitor 4-(6-ethynyl-9h-purin-2-ylamino)
benzene sulfonamide (ncl-00016066). using combination vitro kinase assays
and mass spectrometry, (including phosphoproteomics) study shows this
compound acts irreversible inhibitor mutant pfnek2 likely 
covalent link introduced cysteine residue. particular, shown
by analysis total protein mass using mass spectrometry showed shift in
molecular weight mutant kinase presence inhibitor be
precisely equivalent molecular weight ncl-00016066. similar molecular
weight shift observed wild type kinase. importantly, this
inhibitor little activity towards wild type pfnek-2 and, therefore, has
all properties effective chemical genetic tool could employed
to determine cellular targets pfnek-2.
conclusions: allelic replacement wild-type pfnek-2 mutated kinase
will allow targeted inhibition pfnek-2 ncl-00016066 hence pave
the way comparative studies aimed understanding biological role and
transmission-blocking potential pfnek-2.
