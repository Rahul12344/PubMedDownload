by attaching infected erythrocytes vascular lining, plasmodium falciparum 
parasites leave blood circulation avoid splenic clearance. sequestration
is central pathogenesis. severe malaria associated parasites
expressing antigenically distinct p. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1
(pfemp1) subset mediating binding endothelial receptors. previous studies
indicate pfemp1 adhesins so-called cidrα1 domains capable binding
endothelial protein c receptor (epcr) constitute pfemp1 subset associated
with severe pediatric malaria. analyze relative importance different
subtypes cidrα1 domains, compared pfemp1 transcript levels children with
severe malaria (including 9 fatal 114 surviving cases), children hospitalized
with uncomplicated malaria (n = 42), children mild malaria requiring
hospitalization (n = 10), children parasitemia ongoing fever (n =
12). high levels transcripts encoding epcr-binding pfemp1 found in
patients symptomatic infections, abundance transcripts
increased disease severity. compositions cidrα1 subtype transcripts
varied markedly patients, none subtypes dominant.
transcript-level analyses targeting domain types indicated subtypes of
dblβ dblζ domains might mediate binding phenomena that, conjunction with
epcr binding, could contribute pathogenesis. observations strengthen the
rationale targeting pfemp1-epcr interaction vaccines adjunctive
therapies. interventions target epcr binding cidrα1 subtypes.
