background: dengue major public health problem mexico, use of
chemical insecticides control principal dengue vector, aedes aegypti, is
widespread. resistance insecticides reported multiple sites, and
the frequency kdr mutations associated pyrethroid resistance has
increased rapidly recent years. present study, characterized
patterns insecticide resistance ae. aegypti populations five small towns
surrounding city merida, mexico.
methods: cross-sectional, entomological survey performed june and
august 2013 250 houses five towns. indoor resting adult
mosquitoes collected houses four ovitraps placed each
study block. cdc bottle bioassays conducted using f0-f2 individuals reared
from ovitraps kdr allele (ile1016 cys1534) frequencies were
determined.
results: high, varying, levels resistance chorpyrifos-ethyl was
detected study towns, complete susceptibility bendiocarb except 
one town, variations resistance deltamethrin towns, ranging
from 63-88% mortality. significant associations detected between
deltamethrin resistance presence kdr alleles. phenotypic
resistance highly predictive presence alleles, however, not
all mosquitoes containing mutant allele phenotypically resistant. an
analysis genotypic differentiation (exact g test) five towns based
on adult female ae. aegypti collected inside houses showed highly
significant differences (p < 0.0001) genotypes loci. this
was analyzed look fine scale differences block level within
towns, genotypic differentiation significant loci san lorenzo
(ile1016, p = 0.018 cys1534, p = 0.007) ile1016 acanceh
(p = 0.013) conkal (p = 0.031).
conclusions: results study suggest 3 years switching
chemical groups, deltamethrin resistance high frequency kdr alleles
persisted ae. aegypti populations. spatial variation detected 
both resistance phenotypes genotypes practical implications, for
vector control operations well insecticide resistance management
strategies.
