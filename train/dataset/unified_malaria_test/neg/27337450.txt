for five decades, southeast asia (sea) fertile ground 
emergence drug-resistant plasmodium falciparum malaria. generating
parasites resistant chloroquine, sulfadoxine, pyrimethamine, quinine, and
mefloquine, region spawned parasites resistant artemisinins, 
world's potent antimalarial drugs. areas artemisinin resistance 
prevalent, artemisinin combination therapies (acts)-the first-line treatments for
malaria-are failing fast. worrisome development threatens make malaria
practically untreatable sea, threatens compromise global endeavors to
eliminate disease. recent series clinical, vitro, genomics, and
transcriptomics studies sea defined vivo vitro phenotypes of
artemisinin resistance, identified causal genetic determinant, explored its
molecular mechanism, assessed clinical impact. specifically, these
studies established artemisinin resistance manifests slow parasite
clearance patients increased survival early-ring-stage parasites in
vitro; caused single nucleotide polymorphisms parasite's k13 gene,
is associated upregulated "unfolded protein response" pathway may
antagonize pro-oxidant activity artemisinins, selects partner drug
resistance rapidly leads act failures. sea, clinical studies are
urgently needed monitor act efficacy k13 mutations prevalent, test
whether new combinations currently available drugs cure act failures, and
advance new antimalarial compounds preclinical pipelines into
clinical trials. intensifying efforts help forestall spread
of artemisinin partner drug resistance sea sub-saharan africa, 
the world's malaria transmission, morbidity, mortality rates highest.
