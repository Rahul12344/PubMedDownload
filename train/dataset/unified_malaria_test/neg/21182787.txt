the loss chloroquine due selection spread drug resistant plasmodium 
falciparum parasites greatly impacted malaria control, especially highly
endemic areas africa. since chloroquine removal decade ago, guidelines
to treat falciparum malaria suggest combination therapies, preferentially an
artemisinin derivative. one recommended partner drugs amodiaquine, a
pro-drug relies active metabolite monodesethylamodiaquine, is
still effective areas africa, regions south america. genetic 
studies p. falciparum parasites shown different pfcrt mutant
haplotypes linked distinct levels chloroquine amodiaquine
responses. pfcrt haplotype svmnt (termed amino acids codon
positions 72-76) stably present several areas amodiaquine was
introduced widely used. parasites haplotype highly resistant to
monodesethylamodiaquine also resistant chloroquine. presence this
haplotype africa found first time 2004 tanzania role
for amodiaquine selection haplotype suggested. commentary
discusses finding second site africa high incidence this
haplotype. >50% svmnt haplotype prevalence angola represents threat to
the rise spread amodiaquine resistance. paramount monitor pfcrt
haplotypes every country currently using amodiaquine re-evaluate
current combination therapies areas svmnt type parasites prevalent.
