background: artemisinin resistance plasmodium falciparum emerged a
major threat malaria control elimination worldwide. mutations the
kelch propeller domain pfk13 known molecular markers for
artemisinin resistance parasite. 100 non-synonymous mutations have
been identified pfk13 various malaria endemic regions. study aimed
to investigate genetic diversity pvk12, plasmodium vivax ortholog of
pfk13, parasite populations southeast asia, artemisinin resistance 
in p. falciparum emerged.
methods: pvk12 sequences 120 p. vivax isolates collected thailand
(22), myanmar (32) china (66) 2004 2008 obtained 353
pvk12 sequences worldwide populations retrieved analysis.
results: pvk12 sequences revealed low level genetic diversity
(π = 0.00003) three single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps). these
three snps, g581r nonsynonymous. synonymous mutation s88s present 
in 3% (1/32) myanmar samples, g704g g581r present 1.5%
(1/66) 3% (2/66) samples china, respectively. none the
mutations observed p. vivax samples associated artemisinin
resistance p. falciparum. furthermore, analysis 473 pvk12 sequences from
twelve worldwide p. vivax populations confirmed limited polymorphism 
this gene detected five distinct haplotypes.
conclusions: pvk12 sequences global p. vivax populations displayed 
limited genetic diversity indicating low levels baseline polymorphisms of
pvk12 areas.
