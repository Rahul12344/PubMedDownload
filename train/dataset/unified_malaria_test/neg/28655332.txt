background: lipoic acid cofactor α-keto acid dehydrogenase system that
is involved central energy metabolism. apicomplexan parasite,
plasmodium, lipoic acid protein ligase 1 (lpla1) lpla2 catalyse ligation 
of acquired lipoic acid dehydrogenase complexes mitochondrion. 
enzymes lipb lipa mediate lipoic acid synthesis ligation enzymes
in apicoplast. enzymes lipoic acid metabolism machinery have
been shown play important roles biology plasmodium parasites, but
the relationship enzymes fully elucidated.
methods: used anhydrotetracycline (atc)-inducible transcription system to
generate transgenic p. berghei parasites lpla1 gene was
conditionally knocked (lpla1-cko). phenotypic changes lpla1 lpla2
gene expression profiles cloned lpla1-cko parasites analysed.
results: lpla1-cko parasites showed severely impaired growth vivo first
8 days infection, retarded blood-stage development vitro, the
absence atc. however, parasites resumed viability late stage of
infection mounted high levels parasitemia leading death the
hosts. although lpla1 mrna expression regulated tightly atc the
whole course infection, lpla2 mrna expression significantly increased in
the late stage infection lpla1-cko parasites exposed
to atc.
conclusions: lpla2 gene activated alternative pathway to
compensate loss lpla1 activity maintain lipoic acid metabolism.
