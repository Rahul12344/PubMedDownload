malaria's ability rapidly adapt new drugs allowed remain one of
the devastating infectious diseases humans. understanding tracking
the genetic basis adaptations critical success treatment
and intervention strategies. novel antimalarial resistance locus pf10_0355
(pfmspdbl2) previously associated parasite response halofantrine,
and functional validation confirmed overexpression gene lowered
parasite sensitivity halofantrine structurally related
antimalarials mefloquine lumefantrine, predominantly copy number
variation. characterize role pfmspdbl2 mediating the
antimalarial drug response plasmodium falciparum. knockout pfmspdbl2
increased parasite sensitivity halofantrine, mefloquine, lumefantrine 
not unrelated antimalarials, suggesting gene mediates the
parasite response specific class antimalarial drugs. single nucleotide 
polymorphism encoding c591s mutation within pfmspdbl2 strongest
association halofantrine sensitivity showed high derived allele
frequency among senegalese parasites. transgenic parasites expressing the
ancestral pfmspdbl2 allele sensitive halofantrine structurally
related antimalarials parasites expressing derived allele,
revealing allele-specific effect drug sensitivity absence copy
number effects. finally, growth competition experiments showed drug
pressure, parasites expressing derived allele pfmspdbl2 outcompeted
parasites expressing ancestral allele within generations. together,
these experiments demonstrate modulation pfmspdbl2 affects malaria
parasite responses antimalarial drugs.
