the iron ion essential cofactor several vital enzymatic reactions, 
as dna replication, oxygen transport, respiratory photosynthetic electron
transfer chains, excess accumulation induces oxidative stress cells.
vacuolar iron transporter 1 (vit1) important iron homeostasis plants,
by transporting cytoplasmic ferrous ions vacuoles. modification vit1 
gene leads increased iron content crops, could used the
treatment human iron deficiency diseases. furthermore, vit1 the
malaria-causing parasite plasmodium considered potential drug target 
malaria. report crystal structure vit1 rose gum eucalyptus
grandis, probably functions h+-dependent antiporter fe2+ other
transition metal ions. vit1 adopts novel protein fold forming dimer five
membrane-spanning domains, ion-translocating pathway constituted the
conserved methionine carboxylate residues dimer interface. second 
transmembrane helix protrudes lipid membrane 40 å connects 
to three-helical bundle, triangular cytoplasmic domain, binds the
substrate metal ions stabilizes soluble form, thus playing essential
role transport. mechanistic insights provide useful
information design genetically modified crops the
development anti-malaria drugs.
