in temperate sub-tropical regions asia latin america, complicated
malaria manifested hepatic dysfunction renal dysfunction seen age
groups. concerted focus understanding patho-physiological
and molecular basis complicated malaria children, much less known 
it adults. report here, analysis data custom, cross strain
microarray (agilent platform) using material adult patient samples, showing 
hepatic dysfunction renal failure. common manifestations
seen adults along cerebral malaria. data analyzed with
reference variant surface antigens, encoded var, rifin stevor gene 
families. differential regulation profiles key genes (comparison between
plasmodium falciparum complicated uncomplicated isolates) observed.
the exportome analyzed using similar parameters. gene ontology term
based functional enrichment differentially regulated genes identified,
up-regulated genes statistically enriched (p<0.05) critical biological
processes like generation precursor metabolite energy, chromosome
organization electron transport chain. systems network based functional
enrichment overall differentially regulated genes yielded similar result. we
are reporting here, up-regulation var group b c genes whose proteins are
predicted interact cd36 receptor host, up-regulation domain
cassette 13 (dc13) containing var group a, also up-regulation group a
rifins many stevors. contrary reports from
pediatric patients, cerebral malaria up-regulation mostly var a
group genes seen. protein-protein interaction based network 
created analysis performed. co-expression text mining based network 
has shown overall connectivity variant surface antigens (vsa) the
exportome. up-regulation var group b c genes encoding pfemp1 with
different domain architecture would important deciding strategies for
disease prevention.
