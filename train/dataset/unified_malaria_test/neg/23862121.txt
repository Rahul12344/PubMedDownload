objective: different studies shown association tlr4 polymorphisms with
susceptibility/resistance malaria disease. current immunogenetic study,
we assessed tlr4 genotypes formed two common single nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps) (asp299gly thr399ile) co-segregate state in
baluchi plasmodium falciparum infected healthy populations malaria
hypoendemic areas iran. study performed evaluate distribution
and correlation tlr4 co-segregating genotypes patients mild malaria.
moreover, frequency genotypes compared reported results
from populations similar contrasting malaria settings around the
world.
materials methods: case control study, presence 2 snps 
tlr4 gene (asp299gly thr399ile) analyzed 350 baluchi patients with
mild malaria 350 unrelated healthy controls using polymerase chain
reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr/rflp) techniques followed 
by sequencing analysis. differences tlr4 co-segregate genotype frequencies
among studied group determined fisher's exact test.
results: although distribution two commonly co-segregating tlr4
genotypes presented diverse distinct pattern baluchi population, 
significant difference detected cases controls (p>0.05). a
lower frequency tlr4 asp299gly/thr399thr observed baluchis mild
malaria compared african populations (p< 0.05).
conclusion: differences co-segregation patterns tlr4
asp299gly/thr399ile genotypes baluchi population compared malaria
endemic populations may suggest different local evolutionary pressure tlr4
polymorphisms malaria region. higher frequency of
asp299gly/thr399ile genotypes among baluchi population compared the
african population (p< 0.05) suffers larger number severe cases
might suggest genotype role protecting severe malaria.
these findings useful understanding pathogenesis severe
malaria.
