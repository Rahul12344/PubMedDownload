merozoite surface protein 7 (msp-7) multigene family expressed during
malaria blood-stage infection. msp-7 forms complex msp-1 prior merozoite 
egress erythrocytes, could affect merozoite invasion erythrocytes. to
characterize sequence variation orthologue p. vivax (pvmsp-7), gene
member encoding pvmsp-7e analyzed among 92 thai isolates collected 3
major endemic areas thailand (northwest: tak, northeast: ubon ratchathani, and
south: yala narathiwat provinces). total, 52 distinct haplotypes were
found circulate areas. although population structure based this
locus observed endemic area, genetic differentiation occurred
between populations collected different periods endemic area,
suggesting spatial temporal genetic variation. sequence
microheterogeneity n- c- terminal regions predicted display 4 
and 6 α-helical domains, respectively. signals purifying selection were
observed α-helices ii-x, suggesting structural functional constraint in
these domains. contrast, α-helix-i spanning putative signal peptide was
under positive selection, amino acid substitutions could alter predicted
cd4+ helper cell epitopes. central region pvmsp-7e comprised the
5'-trimorphic 3'-dimorphic subregions. positive selection identified 
in 3' dimorphic subregion central domain. consensus intrinsically
unstructured disordered protein predicted encompass entire central 
domain contained number putative b cell epitopes putative protein
binding regions. evidences intragenic recombination common the
central region remainders gene. results suggest the
extent sequence variation, recombination events selective pressures the
pvmsp-7e locus seem differentially affected protein secondary structure.
