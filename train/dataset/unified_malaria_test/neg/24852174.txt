malaria, dengue fever, filariasis three common mosquito-borne
diseases worldwide. malaria lymphatic filariasis occur concomitant
human infections also sharing common mosquito vectors. overall
prevalence health significance malaria filariasis made top
priorities global elimination control programmes. pyrethroid resistance
in anopheline mosquito vectors represents highly significant problem malaria
control worldwide. several methods proposed mitigate insecticide
resistance, including rotational use insecticides different modes of
action. anopheles sinensis, important malaria filariasis vector in
southeast asia, represents interesting mosquito species examining the
consequences long-term insecticide rotation use resistance. examined
insecticide resistance two an. sinensis populations central southern 
china pyrethroids, organochlorines, organophosphates, carbamates,
which major classes insecticides recommended indoor residual
spray. found mosquito populations highly resistant four
classes insecticides. high frequency kdr mutation revealed the
central population, whereas kdr mutation detected southern
population. frequency g119s mutation ace-1 gene moderate in
both populations. classification regression trees (cart) statistical
analysis found metabolic detoxification important resistance
mechanism, whereas target site insensitivity l1014 kdr mutation played less 
important role. results indicate metabolic detoxification the
dominant mechanism resistance compared target site insensitivity, and
suggests long-term rotational use various insecticides led an.
sinensis evolve high insecticide resistance. study highlights the
complex network mechanisms conferring multiple resistances chemical
insecticides mosquito vectors important implication designing
and implementing vector resistance management strategies.
