immunity controls parasitemia inflammation plasmodium falciparum 
(pf) malaria acquired repeated infections. limited understanding of
this complex immune response impedes development vaccines adjunctive
therapies. conducted prospective systems biology study children who
differed ability control parasitemia fever following pf
infection. integrating whole-blood transcriptomics, flow-cytometric analysis, 
and plasma cytokine antibody profiles, demonstrate pre-infection
signature b cell enrichment, upregulation helper type 1 (th1) th2
cell-associated pathways, including interferon responses, p53 activation
associated control malarial fever coordinated pf-specific
immunoglobulin g (igg) fc receptor activation control parasitemia. our
hypothesis-generating approach identified host molecules may contribute to
differential clinical outcomes pf infection. proof concept, we
have shown enhanced p53 expression monocytes attenuated
plasmodium-induced inflammation predicted protection fever.
