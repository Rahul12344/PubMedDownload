the clag multigene family strictly conserved malaria parasites, absent 
from neighboring genera protozoan parasites. early research pointed roles
in merozoite invasion infected cell cytoadherence, recent studies
have implicated channel-mediated uptake ions nutrients host plasma.
here, review current understanding gene family, appears to
be central host-parasite interactions important therapeutic target.
