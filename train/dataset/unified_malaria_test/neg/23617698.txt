background: chromosomes responsible initiation male development,
male fertility, male-related functions diverse species. however, y
genes rarely characterized outside model species due arduous
nature studying repeat-rich y.
results: chromosome quotient (cq) novel approach systematically
discover chromosome genes. cq method, genomic dna males females
is sequenced independently aligned candidate reference sequences. the
female male ratio number alignments reference sequence, a
parameter called chromosome quotient (cq), used determine whether the
sequence y-linked. using cq method, successfully identified known y
sequences homo sapiens drosophila melanogaster. cq method
facilitated discovery chromosome sequences malaria mosquitoes
anopheles stephensi an. gambiae. comparisons transcriptome sequence data
with blastn led discovery six anopheles genes, three each
species. six genes expressed early embryo. two three an.
stephensi genes recently acquired autosomes x. although
an. stephensi an. gambiae belong subgenus, found evidence
of genes shared species.
conclusions: cq method reliably identify chromosome sequences using the
ratio alignments male female sequence data. cq method widely
applicable species fragmented genome assemblies produced from
next-generation sequencing data. analysis six genes characterized in
this study indicates rapid chromosome evolution an. stephensi an.
gambiae. anopheles genes discovered cq method provide unique markers
for population phylogenetic analysis, opportunities novel mosquito
control measures manipulation sexual dimorphism fertility.
