hemoglobin e (hbe) one common hemoglobin variants caused a
mutation Î²-globin gene, found high frequencies various southeast
asian groups. surveyed hbe prevalence among 8 ethnic groups residing 5
villages selected high period malaria endemicity, 5 low
endemicity northern thailand, order uncover factors may affect
genetic persistence hbe groups. found overall hbe prevalence
6.7%, differing frequencies 0% pwo karen, lawa, skaw
karen 24% mon. hbe genes heterozygous (ae). differences hbe
prevalence among studied ethnic groups indirectly documents ancestries
and evolutionary forces, drift admixture, important factors
in persistence hbe distribution northern thailand. furthermore, the
presence hbe groups northern thailand effect vitro
infectivity proliferation plasmodium falciparum, production of
hemozoin, heme crystal produced malaria parasites, compared normal
red-blood-cell controls. data may contribute better understanding the
persistence hbe among ethnic groups association malaria.
