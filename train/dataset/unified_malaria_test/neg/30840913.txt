the liver plays central role metabolism; however, xenobiotic metabolism
variations human hepatocytes model organisms create
challenges establishing functional test beds detect potential drug
toxicity efficacy candidate small molecules. emerging areas rna 
interference, viral gene therapy, genome editing, robust, long-lasting, 
and predictive human liver models may accelerate progress. here, apply new
modality previously established, functionally stable, multi-well
bioengineered microliver-fabricated primary human hepatocytes supportive
stromal cells-in order advance small molecule nucleic acid
therapeutic pipelines. specifically, achieve robust durable gene silencing
in vitro tune human metabolism small molecules, demonstrate its
capacity query potential efficacy and/or toxicity candidate
therapeutics. additionally, apply engineered platform test sirnas
designed target hepatocytes impact human liver genetic infectious
diseases.
