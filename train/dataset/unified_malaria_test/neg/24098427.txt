background: genetically modified mosquitoes proposed alternative 
strategy reduce heavy burden malaria. recent years, several
proof-of-principle experiments performed validate idea that
mosquitoes genetically modified become refractory malaria parasite
development.
results: created two transgenic lines anophelesstephensi, natural
vector plasmodium falciparum, constitutively secrete catalytically
inactive phospholipase a2 (mpla2) midgut lumen interfere with
plasmodium ookinete invasion. experiments show transgenic lines
expressing mpla2 significantly impair development rodent malaria
parasites, one line impairs development human malaria parasites. 
in addition, fed malaria-infected blood, mosquitoes transgenic 
lines fecund non-transgenic mosquitoes. consistent these
observations, cage experiments mixed populations transgenic and
non-transgenic mosquitoes show percentage transgenic mosquitoes
increases maintained plasmodium-infected blood.
conclusions: results suggest expression anti-plasmodium
effector gene gives transgenic mosquitoes fitness advantage fed
malaria-infected blood. findings important implications future
applications transgenic mosquito technology malaria control.
