modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva) replication-deficient poxvirus,
attenuated chick embryo fibroblast primary cells. utilised a
viral vector develop many vaccines cancer infectious diseases such
as malaria, hiv/aids, influenza, tuberculosis, mers-cov, ebola virus
infection. accumulating data many preclinical clinical studies 
that highlights excellent safety immunogenicity mva. however, due to
the complex nature many pathogens pathogenicity, mva vectored
vaccine candidates need optimised improve immunogenicity. one of
the main approaches improve mva immunogenicity focuses optimising poxviral 
promoters drive recombinant vaccine antigens, encoded within recombinant mva
vector genome. number promoters described optimised improve the
development mva based vaccines p7.5, pf11, mh5 promoters. this
review focuses poxviral promoters, optimisation, genetic stability, 
clinical use.
