the aim study develop recombinase polymerase amplification (rpa)
combined lateral flow (lf) strip method specific diagnosis of
plasmodium knowlesi. incubation 37°c, 18s rrna gene p. knowlesi
was successfully amplified within 12 minutes. adding specifically designed
probe reaction solution, amplified rpa product visualized 
lf strip. rpa assay exhibited high sensitivity limits detection 
to 10 parasites/μl p. knowlesi. nonetheless, demonstrated p.
knowlesi (n = 41) plasmodium sp. (n = 25) positive negative 
samples (n = 8) negative. therefore, combination rpa lf strip
detection highly promising approach potential suitable for
use resource-limited settings.
