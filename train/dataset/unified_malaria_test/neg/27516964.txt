the biological function post-translational modification hypusine the
eukaryotic initiation factor 5a (eif-5a) eukaryotes still understood.
hypusine formed two sequential enzymatic steps specific lysine residue
in precursor protein eif-5a. one important biological function eif-5a
which recently identified translation polyproline-rich mrna,
suggesting biological relevance variety biological processes.
hypusinated eif-5a controls proliferation cancer cells inflammatory
processes malaria. shown pharmacological inhibition enzymes
involved pathway, deoxyhypusine synthase (dhs) deoxyhypusine
hydroxylase (dohh), arrested growth malaria parasites. down-regulation 
both malarial eif-5a dhs genes vitro vivo silencing led to
decreased transcript levels protein expression and, turn, low
parasitemia, confirming critical role hypusination eif-5a for
proliferation plasmodium. investigate whether eif-5a the
activating enzyme dhs essential plasmodium erythrocytic stages, targeted 
gene disruption performed rodent malaria parasite plasmodium berghei. 
full disruption genes successful; instead parasites harboring the
episome eif-5a dhs genes obtained, suggesting genes may
perform vital functions pathogenic blood cell stage. next, knock-in 
strategy pursued endogenous genes eif-5a dhs p. berghei.
the latter resulted viable recombinant parasites, strengthening the
observation might essential proliferation asexual
development malaria parasite.
