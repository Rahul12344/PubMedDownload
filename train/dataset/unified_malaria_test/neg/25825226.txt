apicomplexa parasitic protozoa cause important human diseases including 
malaria, cryptosporidiosis toxoplasmosis. replication parasites 
within target host cell dependent salvage well de novo
synthesis fatty acids. toxoplasma gondii, fatty acid synthesis via the
apicoplast-localized fasii essential pathogenesis, role two
other fatty acid biosynthetic complexes remains unclear. here, demonstrate
that er-localized fatty acid elongation (elo) complexes essential for
parasite growth. conditional knockdown nonredundant hydroxyacyl-coa
dehydratase enoyl-coa reductase enzymes elo pathway severely repressed
intracellular parasite growth. (13) c-glucose (13) c-acetate labeling and
comprehensive lipidomic analyses mutants showed selective defect in
synthesis unsaturated long long-chain fatty acids (lcfas vlcfas) 
and depletion phosphatidylinositol phosphatidylethanolamine species
containing unsaturated lcfas vlcfas. requirement elo pathway was
bypassed supplementing media specific fatty acids, indicating active 
but inefficient import host fatty acids. experiments highlight gap
between fatty acid needs parasite availability specific fatty
acids host cell parasite close using dedicated synthesis
and modification pathway.
