the discovery life-threatening zoonotic infection plasmodium knowlesi 
added challenges prompt accurate malaria diagnosis and
surveillance. study aceh province, indonesia, malaria elimination 
setting p. knowlesi endemicity previously known, report the
laboratory investigation difficulties encountered using molecular
detection methods quality assurance microscopically identified clinical
cases. 2014 2015, 20 (49%) p. falciparum, 16 (39%) p. vivax, 3 (7%) p.
malariae, 2 (5%) indeterminate species identified microscopy from
four sentinel health facilities. provincial-level reference laboratory,
loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp), field-friendly molecular method,
was performed confirmed plasmodium samples though further
species-identification limited unavailability non-falciparum
species-specific testing platform used. national reference
laboratory, several molecular methods including nested pcr (npcr) targeting the
18 small sub-unit (18s) ribosomal rna, npcr targeting cytochrome-b (cytb)
gene, p. knowlesi-specific npcr, finally sequencing, necessary to
ultimately classify samples as: 19 (46%) p. knowlesi, 8 (20%) p. falciparum, 
14 (34%) p. vivax. microscopy unable identify mis-classified 56% 
of confirmed cases, including cases p. knowlesi. npcr methods
targeting four human-only species, p. knowlesi missed (18s rrna method)
or showed cross-reactivity p. vivax (cytb method). facilitate diagnosis
and management potentially fatal p. knowlesi infection surveillance for
elimination human-only malaria indonesia affected settings, new
detection methods needed testing point-of-care local
reference laboratories.
