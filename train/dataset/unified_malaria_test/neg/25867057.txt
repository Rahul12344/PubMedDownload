the anopheles gambiae species complex includes major malaria transmitting
mosquitoes africa. species medical importance,
several traits typically characterized using molecular assays aid in
epidemiological studies. traits include species identification, insecticide
resistance, parasite infection status, host preference. since populations 
the anopheles gambiae complex morphologically indistinguishable, polymerase
chain reaction (pcr) traditionally used identify species. species 
is known, several downstream assays routinely performed elucidate 
characteristics. instance, mutations known kdr para gene confer
resistance ddt pyrethroid insecticides. additionally, enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays (elisas) plasmodium parasite dna detection pcr assays are
used detect parasites present mosquito tissues. lastly, combination of
pcr restriction enzyme digests used elucidate host preference
(e.g., human vs. animal blood) screening mosquito bloodmeal for
host-specific dna. developed multi-detection assay (mda) combines 
all aforementioned assays single multiplex reaction genotyping
33snps 96 384 samples time. mda includes multiple markers
for species, plasmodium detection, host blood identification, likelihood 
of generating false positives negatives greatly reduced previous
assays include one marker per trait. robust simple assay can
detect key mosquito traits cost-effectively fraction time
of existing assays.
