evidences reappearance chloroquine sensitive plasmodium falciparum
haplotypes cessation chloroquine many countries provide rationale
for search chloroquine sensitive haplotypes p. falciparum isolates in
nepal use chloroquine falciparum malaria treatment been
ceased since 1988. p. falciparum chloroquine resistant transporter gene (pfcrt)
haplotypes determined factors associated pfcrt haplotypes in
the eastern central regions nepal identified. blood samples 106 
microscopy-positive falciparum malaria patients (62 eastern 44 
the central region) collected filter paper. pfcrt region covering codons 
72-76 amplified pcr sequenced. svmnt haplotype predominant 
central region, whereas cviet haplotype significantly common eastern 
region. multivariable analysis factors associated cviet haplotype, the
eastern region parasite isolates patients visiting india within one
month significant 5% level significance. findings suggest that
antimalarial pressure different eastern central regions nepal
and need effective malaria control program border areas
between india nepal.
