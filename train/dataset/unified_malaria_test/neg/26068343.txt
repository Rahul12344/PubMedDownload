plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite developed resistance almost the
currently used antimalarial drugs. purpose study come across
the genetic distances p. falciparum dhps gene sequences circulating assam. 
a partial fragment p. falciparum dhps gene containing major single nucleotide 
polymorphisms associated sulphadoxine resistance amplified and
sequenced. thereafter specific bioinformatics tools like bioedit v7.0.9, clustalw
in mega 5, dnasp version v.5.10.01 etc used analysis. total 100
p. falciparum positive cases different malaria endemic areas assam were
included study. based upon mutation analysis, total seven
different p. falciparum dhps genotypes observed five variable sites.
maximum five haplotypes found p. falciparum isolates jorhat
district assam. four polymorphic sites observed p. falciparum dhps
gene sequences karbi anglong, nc hills, chirang jorhat whereas the
isolates study areas three polymorphic sites. statistically
significant positive value tajima's observed among p. falciparum
field isolates assam indicating excess intermediate
frequency alleles result population bottlenecks, structure and/or
balancing selection. extensive gene flow took place among p. falciparum
population jorhat sivasagar, chirang sivasagar chirang with
karbi anglong. however, large genetic differentiation observed among p.
falciparum isolates nc hills lakhimpur, tinsukia, dibrugarh golaghat 
and also parasite population karbi anglong lakhimpur tinsukia
signifying little gene flow among population. finding shown that
mutant pfdhps gene associated sulphadoxine resistance circulating in
assam. believed that, parasite population may undergone high level
of breeding.
