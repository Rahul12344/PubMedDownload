background: tumour necrosis factor (tnf) interferon gamma (ifn-γ), encoded by
tnf-836 c/a (rs 1800630) ifn-γ -1616 c/t (rs2069705) genes, key
immunological mediators believed play protective and
pathological roles malaria. aim study investigate the
relationship tnf-836 c/a ifn-γ-1616 c/t polymorphism and
susceptibility severe malaria pregnant women.
methods: prospective cohort (cross-sectional) study conducted pregnant
women attending out-patient clinic king fahad specialist hospital jazan
(kfshj), clinical diagnosis malaria. total one hundred eighty 
six pregnant women genotyped single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) for
tnf ifn-γ using taqman® mgb probes. serum cytokine concentrations were
measured sandwich elisa method.
results: hospital case-control study severe malaria saudi population
identified strong associations individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms in
the tnf ifn-γ genes, defined tnf-836 c ifn-γ-1616 genotypes and
alleles statistically significantly associated severe malaria
infection. furthermore, tnf-836 cc ifn-γ-1616 tt genotypes associated
with higher serum concentration tnf ifn-γ, respectively, with
susceptibility severe malaria.
conclusions: data provides starting point functional genetic
analysis tnf ifn-γ genomic region malaria infection affecting saudi
populations.
