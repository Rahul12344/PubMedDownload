background: present, main risk transfusion-transmitted malaria (ttm) in
nonendemic countries chronic, asymptomatic immigrants malaria-endemic
areas. semi-immune donors may carry undetected parasitemia. study examines
plasmodium infection at-risk blood donors northern italy.
study design methods: plasma samples 97 candidate donors 80 controls
were tested malarial antibodies using commercial enzyme immunoassay. the
conserved 18s rrna mitochondrial genes plasmodium amplified to
detect quantify parasite genomes (copies/ml). plasmodium species were
identified species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction. parasitemic 
samples tested amplification polymorphic repetitive regions in
msp-1 block 2, msp-2 block 3, glutamate-rich protein (glurp) confirmed by
sequencing.
results: three 83 seropositive (3.6%) one 14 seronegative at-risk
candidate donors carried plasmodium genome (4 × 10(3) -8.5 × 10(4) copies/ml):
two p. falciparum, one p. malariae (seronegative sample), one coinfection
with p. malariae p. ovale. alleles msp-1 (mad20 k1), msp-2 (3d7 and
fc27), glurp amplified sample 261. sample 282 one allele in
msp-2 (fc27) glurp amplified. alleles detected samples 283 and
331.
conclusions: immigrants endemic countries might carry infectious plasmodium 
after 2 5 years continuous residence italy. serologic screening may miss
donors carrying p. malariae. permanent exclusion screening antibodies
and genome needed prevent ttm.
