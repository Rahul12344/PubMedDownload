malaria life-threatening blood disease caused protozoan plasmodium.
infection may lead several different patterns symptoms host:
asymptomatic state, uncomplicated disease severe disease. severe malaria
occurs mostly young children major cause death. disease thought
to result sequestration parasites small blood vessels the
brain deregulation key immune system elements. cellular and
molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying pathogenesis disease are
however fully understood. known genetic determinants
of host play important role severity disease outcome
of infection. review convincing results obtained genetic
epidemiology studies concerning genetic control malaria human caused by
plasmodium falciparum infection. identification genes conferring
susceptibility resistance malaria might improve diagnosis treatment.
