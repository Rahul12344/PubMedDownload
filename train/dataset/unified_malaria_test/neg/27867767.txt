anopheles gambiae densovirus (agdnv) potential microbial agent for
paratransgenesis gene transduction an. gambiae, major vector human 
malaria sub-saharan africa. understanding interaction agdnv and
an. gambiae critical using agdnv basic applied manner for
anopheles gene manipulation. here, tested effects mosquito age, sex,
blood feeding status, potential horizontal transmission using enhanced
green fluorescent protein (egfp) reporter agdnv system. neither mosquito age at
infection feeding regime affected viral titers. female mosquitoes more
permissive viral infection males. despite low viral titers, infected
males able venereally transmit virus females mating, 
virus localized transferred sperm spermathecae. these
findings useful designing agdnv-based strategies manipulate
anopheles gambiae.
