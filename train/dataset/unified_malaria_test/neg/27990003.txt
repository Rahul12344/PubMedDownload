mosquitoes pose major threat human health spread many deadly
diseases like malaria, dengue, chikungunya, filariasis, japanese encephalitis and
zika. identification use novel molecular tools essential combat the
spread vector borne diseases. genome editing tools used the
precise alterations gene interest producing desirable trait 
mosquitoes. deletion functional genes insertion toxic genes vector
mosquitoes produce either knock-out knock-in mutants check 
spread vector-borne diseases. presently, three types genome editing tools
viz., zinc finger nuclease (zfn), transcription activator-like effector nucleases
(talen) clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)
and crispr associated protein 9 (cas9) widely used editing the
genomes diverse organisms. tools also applied vector mosquitoes
to control spread vector-borne diseases. studies carried
out genome editing control diseases spread vector mosquitoes and
more studies need performed utilization recently invented 
tools like crispr/cas9 combat spread deadly diseases vector
mosquitoes. high specificity flexibility crispr/cas9 system may offer 
possibilities novel genome editing control important diseases
spread vector mosquitoes. review, present current status of
genome editing research vector mosquitoes also discuss future
applications vector mosquito genome editing control spread of
vectorborne diseases.
