background: endemic burkitt lymphoma (ebl) aggressive b-cell lymphoma,
which common childhood cancer areas intense transmission of
plasmodium falciparum parasites. early accurate diagnosis prerequisite
for successful therapy, optimally involves advanced laboratory
investigations. technologically demanding, expensive, often
difficult implement settings ebl prevalent. diagnosis thus
generally based clinical assessment morphological examination tumour
biopsies fine-needle aspirates (fnas).
methods: purpose present study assess accuracy ebl
diagnosis two tertiary hospitals ghana. end, studied fnas from
29 ebl patients 21 non-ebl lymphoma patients originally diagnosed 2018. in
addition, examined 111 archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe)
biopsies ghanaian patients originally diagnosed ebl (n = 55) non-ebl
(n = 56) 2010 2017. availability-based subsets samples were
subjected haematoxylin-eosin giemsa staining, c-myc immunohistochemistry,
and fluorescence situ hybridisation (fish) analysis c-myc rearrangements.
results: found good correlation original diagnosis subsequent
retrospective assessment, particularly fna samples. however, evidence of
intact c-myc genes normal c-myc expression samples patients
originally diagnosed ebl indicates morphological assessment alone can
lead ebl over-diagnosis study area. addition, several ffpe samples
could assessed retrospectively, due poor sample quality. therefore, the
simpler fna method obtaining tumour material preferable, particularly 
careful processing biopsy specimens cannot guaranteed.
conclusion: conclude accuracy ebl diagnostic tools available in
ghana generally adequate, could improved implementation of
additional pathology laboratory investigations. improved attention adequate
preservation archival samples recommended.
