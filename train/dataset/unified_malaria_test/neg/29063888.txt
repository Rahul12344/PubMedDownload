two millilitres peripheral blood collected 323 patients different 
age groups rapid diagnosis (rdt test) performed. parasite genomic dna was
extracted whole blood msp-2 gene-based diversity polymorphism was
determined followed restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using
taq 1 vsp 1 digestion polymerase chain reaction product analyse
msp-2 genotypes. twenty-six sequences p. falciparum msp-2 gene retrieved 
from current genbank database represent strains various geographical 
locations analysed taq 1 vsp 1 enzyme restriction sites
using silico restriction digestion sequence manipulation suite, version 2.
