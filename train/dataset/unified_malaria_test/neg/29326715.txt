human challenge models, volunteers experimentally infected a
pathogen interest, provide opportunity directly identify natural
and vaccine-induced correlates protection. review, highlight how
the application transcriptomics human challenge studies allows the
identification novel correlates gives insight immunological
pathways required develop functional immunity. malaria challenge trials for
example, innate immune pathways appear play previously underappreciated role
in conferring protective immunity. transcriptomic analyses samples obtained in
human challenge studies also deepen understanding immune responses
preceding symptom onset, allowing characterization innate immunity early
gene signatures, may influence disease outcome. influenza challenge studies
demonstrate gene signatures diagnostic potential context
of pandemics, presymptomatic diagnosis at-risk individuals could
allow early initiation antiviral treatment help limit transmission.
furthermore, gene expression analysis facilitates identification host
factors contributing disease susceptibility, c4bpa expression in
enterotoxigenic escherichia coli infection. overall, studies highlight 
exceptional value transcriptional data generated human challenge trials and
illustrate broad impact molecular data analysis may global health
through rational vaccine design biomarker discovery.
