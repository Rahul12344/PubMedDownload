background: emerging evidence mosquito anti-plasmodium immunity 
multimodal distinct mechanisms killing malaria parasites either the
ookinete oocyst stages. early-phase responses targeting ookinete require
complement-like components circulating mosquito hemolymph result in
tep1-mediated lysis melanization. additional responses mediated ll3 and
stat pathways limit oocyst survival unknown mechanisms require
mosquito hemocyte function. previous experiments argue these
mechanisms parasite killing independent, transient nature of
gene-silencing rendered experiments inconclusive. address this
issue, outline experiments using talen-derived tep1 mutant line examine
the role tep1 anopheles gambiae late-phase immune response.
results: despite higher early oocyst numbers tep1 mutant line, no
differences oocyst survival observed compared control mosquitoes,
suggesting tep1 function independent late-phase immune response.
to validate phenotype tep1 mutant, oocyst survival was
evaluated tep1 mutant background silencing either ll3 stat-a.
surprisingly, stat-a silenced mosquitoes able reconstitute the
late-phase immune phenotype increasing oocyst survival tep1 mutant line.
additional experiments highlight significant differences ll3 expression the
m/s hybrid genetic background tep1 mutant line compared the
keele strain (m form) an. gambiae, demonstrate ll3 required
for granulocyte differentiation m/s hybrid g3 genetic background in
response malaria parasite infection.
conclusions: combination genetic experiments utilizing genetic
mutants reverse genetic approaches, new information emerged regarding the
mechanisms mosquito late-phase immunity. combined previously
published experiments, body evidence argues plasmodium oocyst
survival tep1 independent, thus establishing mechanisms early- and
late-phase immunity distinct. moreover, identify known components
that mediate oocyst survival susceptible strain-specific differences
depending genetic background provide evidence the
signals promote hemocyte differentiation required limit oocyst
survival. together, study provides new insights mechanisms of
oocyst killing importance genetics shaping mosquito vector
competence.
