background: plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (pfcsp) one 
most extensively studied malaria vaccine candidates, genetic polymorphism
of pfcsp within among global p. falciparum population raises concerns
regarding efficacy pfcsp-based vaccine efficacy. study, genetic 
diversity natural selection pfcsp myanmar well global p.
falciparum comprehensively analysed.
methods: blood samples collected 51 p. falciparum infected myanmar
patients. fifty-one full-length pfcsp genes amplified blood samples
through nested polymerase chain reaction, cloned ta cloning vector, 
then sequenced. polymorphic characteristics natural selection myanmar
pfcsp analysed using dnastar, mega6, dnasp programs. polymorphic
diversity natural selection publicly available global pfcsp also
analysed.
results: n-terminal c-terminal non-repeat regions myanmar pfcsp showed
limited genetic variations. comparative analysis two regions global
pfcsp displayed similar patterns low genetic diversity global population,
but substantial geographic differentiation also observed. notable
polymorphisms identified n-terminal region global pfcsp a98g and
19-amino acid length insertion global population different frequencies.
major polymorphic characters c-terminal region myanmar global pfcsp
were found th2r th3r regions, natural selection and
recombination occurred. central repeat region myanmar pfcsp highly
polymorphic, differing numbers repetitive repeat sequences nanp nvdp.
the numbers nanp repeats varied among global pfcsp, highest
number repeats seen asian oceanian pfcsp. haplotype network analysis of
global pfcsp revealed global pfcsp clustered 103 different haplotypes
with geographically-separated populations.
conclusion: myanmar global pfcsp displayed genetic diversity. n-terminal 
c-terminal non-repeat regions relatively conserved, central repeat
region displayed high levels genetic polymorphism myanmar global pfcsp.
the observed geographic pattern genetic differentiation points of
evidence natural selection recombination suggest functional
consequences polymorphism considered developing vaccine
based pfcsp.
