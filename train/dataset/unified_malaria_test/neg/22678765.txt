the blocking nf-κb activation promising strategy treatment of
colorectal cancer. circumsporozoite protein (csp), key component the
sporozoite stage malaria parasite, recently reported block nf-κb
activation hepatocytes. thus, investigated effect csp the
growth human colon cancer cell line, sw480. demonstrated that
transfection recombinant plasmid expressing csp inhibited the
proliferation sw480 dose-dependent manner induced apoptosis of
sw480. nf-κb gene reporter assay showed csp nuclear
localization signal (nls) motif could equally suppress activation nf-κb
following stimulation human recombinant tnf-α sw480. furthermore,
western blot analysis indicated nls affect phosphorylation and
degradation iκb, could sharply inhibit nuclear translocation nf-κb 
in tnf-α stimulated sw480. hence, data suggest csp might explored
as new nf-κb inhibitor treatment colorectal cancer.
