background: naturally fluorescent compound quinine long used to
treat malaria infections. although evidence suggests quinine acts in
the parasite food vacuole, mechanism action quinine yet been
resolved. plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance (pfmdr1) gene encodes 
food vacuolar membrane transporter linked parasite resistance
to quinine. effect multiple pfmdr1 copies subcellular localization 
of quinine explored.
methods: fluorescence microscopy used evaluate subcellular
localization quinine parasites containing different pfmdr1 copy numbers 
determine copy number gene affects drug localization. acidotropic
dye lysotracker red used label parasite food vacuole. time-lapse
images taken determine quinine localization time following quinine
exposure.
results: regardless pfmdr1 copy number, quinine overlapped haemozoin 
did colocalize lysotracker red, labeled acidic parasite food
vacuole.
conclusions: quinine localizes non-acidic compartment within food
vacuole possibly haemozoin. pfmdr1 copy number affect quinine
subcellular localization.
