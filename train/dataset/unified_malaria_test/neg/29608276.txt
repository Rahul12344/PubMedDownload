replacement wild insect populations transgene-bearing individuals unable 
to transmit disease survive specific environmental conditions using gene
drive provides self-perpetuating method disease prevention. mechanisms 
require gene drive element linked cargo exceed high threshold
frequency order spread occur attractive offer several 
points control: bring local, global population replacement;
and transgenes eliminated reintroducing wildtypes population
so drive frequency transgenes threshold frequency required
for drive. reciprocal chromosome translocations proposed tool for
bringing high threshold population replacement 1940 1968. however,
translocations able achieve goal reported once, the
spider mite tetranychus urticae, haplo-diploid species strong
selection haploid males fit homozygotes. report creation of
engineered translocation-bearing strains drosophila melanogaster, generated
through targeted chromosomal breakage homologous recombination. strains
drive high threshold population replacement laboratory populations. it
remains shown engineered translocations bring population
replacement wild populations, observations suggest further
exploration engineered translocations tool controlled population
replacement warranted.
