peroxiredoxins (prxs) ubiquitary proteins able play multiple physiological
roles, include thiol-dependent peroxidase, chaperone holdase, sensor of
h2o2, regulator h2o2-dependent signal cascades, modulator immune
response. prxs found great number human pathogens, both
eukaryotes prokaryotes. gene knock-out studies demonstrated prxs are
essential survival virulence least pathogens
tested, making proteins potential drug targets. however, multiplicity
of roles played prxs constitutes unexpected obstacle drug development.
indeed, selective inhibitors functions prxs known (namely
of peroxidase holdase functions) reported. however, is
often unclear function relevant pathogen, hence which
one desirable inhibit. indeed evidences main
physiological role prxs may different parasites. here
review functions prxs demonstrated relevant different
human parasites, finding peroxidase chaperone activities figure
prominently, whereas known functions prxs rarely, ever, been
observed parasites, largely escaped detection thus far.
