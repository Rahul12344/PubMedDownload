complement receptor 1 (cr1) levels associated malarial
susceptibility and/or severity disease different population groups, and
cr1 receptor plasmodium falciparum. study, multiple cr1
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) showed strong evidence population
differentiation sardinian european ethnic groups. cross
population algorithms comparing haplotype structure differences haplotype 
and allele frequency distribution provided additional support natural
selection cr1 sardinia. predominant sardinian cr1 haplotype included
snps associated decreased cr1 levels europeans other
population groups. previous studies shown snps within dominant 
sardinian haplotype significantly higher frequency malaria endemic
compared non-endemic regions india. together historical evidence
of prevalence malaria sardinia, data support role malaria 
leading positive selection cr1 haplotype sardinia.
