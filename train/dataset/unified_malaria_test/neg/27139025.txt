rhodococcus equi preferentially infects macrophages causing pyogranulomatous
pneumonia young foals. vapa rhbc genes up-regulated an
iron (fe)-deprived environment, found within macrophages.
chloroquine (cq) drug widely used malaria suppresses the
intracellular availability fe eukaryotic cells. main objective 
study evaluate ability cq inhibit replication virulent r.
equi within murine (j774a.1) foal alveolar macrophages (ams) verify
whether mechanism inhibition could fe-deprivation-dependent. cq effect 
on r. equi extracellular survival toxicity j774a.1 evaluated. r. equi
survival within j774a.1 foal ams evaluated cq (10 20μm), bovine
saturated transferrin (bhtf), bovine unsaturated transferrin (batf) exposure.
to explore action mechanism cq, superoxide anion production, the
lysozyme activity, well relative mrna expression vapa rhbc 
examined. cq at≤20μm effect r. equi extracellular multiplication and
j774a.1 viability. exposure cq significantly markedly reduced survival 
r. equi within j774a.1 foal ams. treatment bhtf reverse cq
effect r. equi. exposure cq affected superoxide anion production or
lysozyme activity, however vapa rhbc expression significantly increased. 
our results reinforce hypothesis intracellular availability fe is
required r. equi survival, initial hypothesis cq limit
replication r. equi j774a.1 foal ams, likely fe starvation.
