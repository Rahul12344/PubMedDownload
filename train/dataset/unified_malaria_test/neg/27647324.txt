cerebral malaria claims life millions people year, particularly
those children, major global public health problem. thus, the
identification novel malaria biomarkers could utilized diagnostic
or therapeutic targets becoming increasingly important. using proteomic
approach, previously identified unique biomarkers sera of
malaria-infected individuals, including apolipoprotein e (apoe). apoe the
dominant apolipoprotein brain implicated several
neurological disorders; therefore, interested potential role of
apoe cerebral malaria. report first demonstration cerebral
malaria markedly attenuated apoe(-/-) mice. protection provided 
absence apoe associated decreased sequestration parasites t
cells within brain, determined independent involvement
of apoe receptors altered lipid metabolism associated the
knock-out mice. importantly, demonstrated treatment mice apoe
antagonist heparin octasaccharide significantly decreased incidence of
cerebral malaria. overall, study indicates reduction apoe could
be utilized development therapeutic treatments aimed mitigating 
neuropathology cerebral malaria.
