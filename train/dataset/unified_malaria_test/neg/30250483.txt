the rbsa protein encoded gene described plasmodium species having
tropism reticulocytes. since protein antigenic natural infections 
and bind target cells, proposed potential candidate for
an anti-plasmodium vivax vaccine. however, genetic diversity (a challenge which
must overcome ensuring fully effective vaccine design) been
described locus. likewise, minimum regions mediating specific
parasite-host interaction determined. rbsa gene's
evolutionary history described, well p. vivax rbsa
(pvrbsa) genetic diversity specific regions mediating parasite adhesion
to reticulocytes. unlike previously reported, rbsa also present
in several parasite species belonging monkey-malaria clade; paralogs 
also found plasmodium parasites invading reticulocytes. pvrbsa locus had
less diversity merozoite surface proteins natural selection 
recombination main evolutionary forces involved causing observed 
polymorphism. n-terminal end (pvrbsa-a) conserved functional
constraint; consequently, expressed recombinant protein binding
assays. protein fragment bound reticulocytes whilst c-terminus,
included recombinant pvrbsa-b (which functional constraint), did
not. interestingly, two pvrbsa-a-derived peptides able inhibit protein
binding reticulocytes. specific conserved functionally important peptides 
within pvrbsa-a could thus considered designing fully-effective vaccine
against p. vivax.
