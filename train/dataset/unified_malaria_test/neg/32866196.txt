invasion hepatocytes plasmodium sporozoites initiates pre-erythrocytic 
step malaria infection. subsequent development parasite within
hepatocytes exit essential starting disease-causing
erythrocytic cycle. identification signaling pathways operate in
pre-erythrocytic stages provides insight critical step infection and
potential targets chemoprotection malaria. demonstrate p.
berghei homologs calcium dependent protein kinase 1 (cdpk1), cdpk4 cdpk5
play overlapping distinct roles sporozoite invasion parasite egress
from hepatocytes. three kinases expressed sporozoites. three are
required optimal motility sporozoites consequently invasion of
hepatocytes. increased cgmp compensate functional loss cdpk1 and
cdpk5 sporozoite invasion cannot overcome loss cdpk4. cdpk1 and
cdpk5 expression downregulated sporozoite invasion. cdpk5 reappears a
subset late stage liver stages present merosomes. chemical
inhibition cdpk4 depletion cdpk5 liver stages implicate these
kinases formation and/or release merosomes mature liver stages.
furthermore, depletion cdpk5 merosomes significantly delays initiation of
the erythrocytic cycle without affecting infectivity hepatic merozoites. these
data suggest cdpk5 may required rupture merosomes. work
provides evidence sporozoite invasion requires cdpk1 cdpk5, suggests
that cdpk5 participates release hepatic merozoites.
