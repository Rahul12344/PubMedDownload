schistosomiasis remains one world's significant neglected tropical
diseases, second malaria terms socioeconomic impact. 2014, china
proposed goal schistosomiasis japonicum elimination 2025. however, one 
major challenge widely distributed, certain cases potentially
increasing, habitats oncomelania hupensis, snail intermediate hosts s. 
japonicum. therefore, understanding population genetics o. hupensis in
new re-emerged habitats, together established habitats with
snail persistence, would valuable controlling predicting future
transmission dynamics schistosomiasis china. using nine microsatellite
loci, conducted population genetic analyses snails sampled one habitat
where snails detected first time, one (previously eliminated)
habitat re-emerged snails, one habitat established snail
persistence. results showed lower diversities, terms number observed
alleles per locus (na), number effective alleles per locus (nea), observed
(ho) expected heterozygosity (he), snails new re-emerged snail
habitats habitat snail persistence. smallest effective
population size inferred re-emerged snail habitat, largest was
in new habitat rather habitat snail persistence. no
bottleneck effects detected new re-merged habitats. low
sub-structure inferred new persistent snail habitats. snails 
three sites clearly separated low gene flow estimated sites.
we propose snails new habitat may introduced through
immigration, whereas snails re-emerged habitat may consequence of
those snails remaining subsequently expanding reproduction. we
discuss results terms theoretical applied implications.
