despite clinically proven advantages intermittent preventive treatment 
malaria pregnancy (iptp) sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp), utilisation 
been low many african countries. increase uptake achieve desired
effect, world health organization revised policy monthly
administration. assessing coverage impact revised policy on
pregnancy neonatal outcomes is, therefore, necessity. 2-parallel
cross-sectional hospital-based study carried among pregnant women
attending first antenatal care (anc) delivery. maternal cord blood
samples assayed malaria parasites quantitative pcr targeting the
18s rdna acidic terminal segment plasmodium falciparum var genes, 
plasma sp levels measured liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass
spectrometry. parasite prevalence similar two study sites but
decreased significantly first anc (9% 43%) delivery (4% or
11%) based qpcr target. delivery, 64.5% women received ≥3 iptp-sp
dose, 15.5% received 2 doses 6% 1 dose. taking ≥3 iptp-sp doses was
associated average birth weight increase 0.165 kg. iptp-sp
uptake associated plasma sp level delivery (or = 32.3, p ≤ 0.005, 95%
ci (13.3;78.4) reported ≥3 iptp-sp doses) trend 
improved birth weight observed high plasma sp levels. new iptp
policy well implemented well utilised women sites considered 
this study translates improved birth weight observed. study
confirms interest clinical benefit expected policy change.
