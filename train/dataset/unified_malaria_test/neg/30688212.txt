case fatality rates severe falciparum malaria depend pattern degree
of vital organ dysfunction. recent large-scale case-control analyses pooled
severe malaria data reported glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency
(g6pdd) protective cerebral malaria increased risk severe 
malarial anaemia. novel formulation balancing selection hypothesis was
proposed explanation findings, whereby selective advantage is
driven competing risks death cerebral malaria death from
severe malarial anaemia. re-analysed claims using causal diagrams and
showed subject collider bias. simulation based sensitivity
analysis, varying strength known effect g6pdd anaemia, showed
that bias sufficient explain observed association. future
genetic epidemiology studies severe malaria would benefit use of
causal reasoning.
