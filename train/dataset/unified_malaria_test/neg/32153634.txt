background: cerebral malaria (cm) characterized sequestration of
plasmodium-infected erythrocytes (prbcs) host brain microvasculature beds via 
p. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (pfemp1). normal conditions,
activated protein c (apc) bound endothelial protein c receptor (epcr) has
cytoprotective properties via activation protease-activated receptor 1
(par1). malaria infection, prbcs transports pfemp1 membranes to
bind epcr region apc. result, apc less capable inducing
cytoprotective effects via par1. two studies involving adult malaria patients
revealed epcr rs867186-gg allele associated protection against
severe malaria, three studies involving child malaria patients could 
not show association epcr rs867186-gg genotype severe malaria or
increased mortality among children cm.
methods: examined association epcr rs867186-gg genotype and
the protection cerebral malaria. peripheral blood samples collected 
from 47 malaria patients 34 healthy individuals study conducted from
2004 2007 nscb medical college hospital india. cm and
malaria-associated complications defined based criteria. genomic dna 
was isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. primer sequences were
designed contain rs867186 procr gene (nm 006404) used to
amplify 660 bp product described before. pcr products purified, dna
sequences determined sanger sequencing (genewiz, nj). nonparametric tests
were used compare groups. analyze differences allele frequencies, we
used chi-squared fisher's exact tests categorical variables the
expected values less 5. p-value <0.05 considered statistically
significant.
results: results showed significantly higher rates ag gg genotypes 
cm patients compared mild malaria (p = 0.0034).
conclusion: results indicate rs867186-gg rs867186-ag genotypes are
not associated protection hcm.
