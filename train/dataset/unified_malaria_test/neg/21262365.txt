molecular chaperones used improved expression target
proteins within heterologous systems; however, chaperone target protein
have seldom matched terms origin. developed heterologous
co-expression system allows independent expression plasmodial
chaperone, pfhsp70, plasmodial target protein. study, target
was plasmodium falciparum gtp cyclohydrolase (pfgchi), first enzyme 
plasmodial folate pathway. sequential expression molecular chaperone
followed target protein increased expression soluble functional
pfgchi. his-tagged pfgchi successfully purified using nickel affinity
chromatography, specific activity determined high performance
liquid chromatography spectrofluorometeric detection 5.93nmol/h/mg.
this first report heterologous co-expression system a
plasmodial chaperone harnessed improved production purification of
a plasmodial target protein.
