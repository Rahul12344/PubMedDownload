recent developments dna vaccine research provide new momentum this
rather young potentially disruptive technology. gene-based vaccines are
capable eliciting protective immunity humans persistent intracellular
pathogens, hiv, malaria, tuberculosis, conventional
vaccine technologies failed far. recent identification and
characterization genes coding tumor antigens stimulated the
development dna-based antigen-specific cancer vaccines. although academic
researchers consider production reasonable amounts plasmid dna (pdna)
for immunological studies relatively easy solve, problems often arise during
this first phase production. chapter review current state of
the art pdna production small (shake flasks) mid-scales (lab-scale
bioreactor fermentations) address new trends vector design strain
engineering. guide reader different stages process
design starting choosing appropriate plasmid backbone, choosing the
right escherichia coli (e. coli) strain production, cultivation media and
scale-up issues. addition, address points concerning safety
and potency produced plasmids, special focus producing antibiotic 
resistance-free plasmids. main goal chapter make immunologists 
aware fact production pdna vaccine performed as
much attention care rest research.
