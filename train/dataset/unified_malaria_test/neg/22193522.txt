malaria important parasitic disease, leading annual death about
one million people, plasmodium falciparum develops resistance to
well-established antimalarial drugs. newest antiplasmodial drug marine
microorganism helps addressing problem. present study, haliclona
grant collected subjected enumeration isolation associated
bacteria. count bacterial isolates maximum november 2007
(18 × 10(4) colony-forming units (cfu) g(-1), average count maximum
during monsoon season (117 × 10(3) cfu g(-1)). thirty-three morphologically
different bacterial isolates isolated haliclona grant, the
extracellular ethyl acetate extracts screened antiplasmodial activity
against p. falciparum. antiplasmodial activity bacterium rjauthb 14 (11.98
μg[symbol: see text]ml(-1)) highly comparable positive control
chloroquine (ic(50) 19.59 μg[symbol: see text]ml(-1)), 21 bacterial
extracts showed ic(50) value 100 μg[symbol: see text]ml(-1).
statistical analysis reveals significant vitro antiplasmodial activity
(p < 0.05) observed concentrations time exposure. the
chemical injury erythrocytes showed morphological changes erythrocytes
by ethyl acetate extract bacterial isolates 48 h incubation. 
in vitro antiplasmodial activity might due presence reducing sugars 
and alkaloids ethyl acetate extracts bacterium rjauthb 14. 16s rrna
gene partial sequence bacterium rjauthb 14 deposited ncbi (genbank
accession no. gu269569). concluded present study ethyl
acetate extracts bacterium rjauthb 14 possess lead compounds the
development antiplasmodial drugs.
