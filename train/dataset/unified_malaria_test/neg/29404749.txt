current knowledge liver responses blood-stage malaria their
modulation vaccination still unclear. study investigated effects of
protective vaccination liver gene lincrna expression balb/c mice at
early prepatency plasmodium chabaudi blood-stage malaria. blood-stage
vaccine used induce > 80% survival otherwise lethal malaria,
significant differences (p < 0.01) detectable global liver gene
expression vaccination-protected (potentially surviving) and
non-protected non-vaccinated mice day 1 p.i.. livers protected mice,
gene expression microarrays identified 224 419 genes, whose expression was
up- downregulated > 3-fold, respectively. 24 genes upregulated 
by > 10-fold, including 10 ifn-inducible genes encompassing gtpases irgm1, 2, and
3, guanylate-binding protein gbp11, il-1 decoy receptors il1f9 and
il1ra1, il6 gene, gene facilitated glucose transportation.
moreover, il-18 decoy receptor gene il18bp, gzmb, genes lif osmr
encoding proteins il-6 family, taurine transporter gene slc6a6
were expressed > 3-fold vaccinated mice. genes gbp10, 6, 4 expressed 
by > 50% vaccination-protected non-vaccinated mice. addition, 43
lincrna species up- 36 downregulated. data suggested novel
regulatory elements potential anti-malaria activity activated protective
vaccination liver, evidenced response early prepatent infections 
vaccination-protected mice otherwise lethal blood-stage malaria p.
