background: c-terminal 42 kda domain plasmodium knowlesi merozoite surface
protein 1 (pkmsp1) potential asexual blood-stage vaccine candidate, however,
only limited number clinical isolates analysed malaysia and
no inter-country comparative diversity study conducted. present
study, nucleotide diversity, haplotypes natural selection levels pkmsp1 in
clinical samples geographically distinct regions malaysia thailand
were investigated. overall population structure parasite the
region determined.
methods: eleven full-length pkmsp1 sequences obtained from clinical isolates of
malaysia along h-strain downloaded database domain
wise characterization pkmsp1 gene. additionally, 76 pkmsp-142 sequences from
thailand malaysia downloaded database intra and
inter-population analysis. dnasp 5.10 mega 5.0 software used to
determine genetic diversity, polymorphism, haplotypes natural selection.
genealogical relationships determined using haplotype network tree in
network software v5.0. population genetic differentiation index (fst) of
parasites analysed using arlequin v3.5.
results: sequence analysis 11 full-length pkmsp1 sequences along the
h-strain identified 477 (8.4%) polymorphic sites, 107 singleton
sites. overall diversity observed full-length genes high in
comparison ortholog pvmsp1 4 variable domains showed extensive
size variations. nucleotide diversity low towards pkmsp1-42 compared 
to conserved domains. 19 kda domain less diverse completely
conserved among isolates malaysian borneo. nucleotide diversity of
isolates peninsular malaysia thailand higher malaysian borneo.
network analysis pkmsp1-42 haplotypes showed geographical clustering the
isolates malaysian borneo grouping isolates peninsular malaysia 
and thailand. population differentiation analysis indicated high fst values
between parasite populations originating malaysian borneo, peninsular
malaysia thailand attributing geographical distance. moderate genetic
differentiation observed parasite populations thailand and
peninsular malaysia. evidence population expansion purifying selection
were observed conserved domains strongest selection within the
pkmsp1-42 domain.
conclusions: study first report inter country genetic diversity
and population structure p. knowlesi based msp1. strong evidence of
negative selection observed 42 kda domain, indicating functional
constrains. geographical clustering p. knowlesi moderate high genetic
differentiation values populations identified study highlights
the importance evaluation using larger number clinical samples from
southeast asian countries.
