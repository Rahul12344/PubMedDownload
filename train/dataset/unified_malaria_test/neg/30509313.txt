objective: rapid diagnostic tests tremendous help malaria control
in endemic areas, helping diagnosis treatment malaria cases. is
heavily relied upon many endemic areas microscopy cannot obtained.
however, caution taken interpretation result clinical 
setting due limitations inherent weakness. paper seeks present
the varying malaria rdt test results, possible interpretations and
explanation results common endemic regions. published works on
malaria rdt studies identified using following search terms "malaria rdt
in endemic areas", "plasmodium falciparum bacterial coinfection" "plasmodium 
falciparum rdt test results children endemic areas" google scholar and
pubmed.
results: review results show rdt positive results febrile patients
can either true false positive. true positive, representing either a
possible single infection plasmodium co-infection bacteria p.
falciparum. false rdt negative results seen febrile patient p.
falciparum infection prozone effect, histidine rich protein 2 (hrp2) gene
deletion faulty rdt kits. hence, scale laboratory facilities
especially expert microscopy diagnostic tools imperative.
