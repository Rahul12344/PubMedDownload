background: despite recent progress establishing patterns of
insecticide resistance major malaria vector anopheles funestus, central
african populations species remain largely uncharacterised. bridge
this important gap facilitate implementation suitable control
strategies vector, characterised resistance patterns an.
funestus population northern cameroon.
methods findings: collection indoor-resting female mosquitoes gounougou
(northern cameroon) 2012 2015 revealed predominance an. funestus
during dry season. bioassays performed using f1 an. funestus revealed that
the population multiple resistant several insecticide classes including
pyrethroids (permethrin, deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin etofenprox),
carbamates (bendiocarb) organochlorines (ddt dieldrin). however, full
susceptibility observed organophosphate malathion. bioassays
performed 2015 collection revealed resistance pyrethroids and
ddt increasing. pbo synergist assays revealed significant recovery of
susceptibility pyrethroids less ddt. analysis polymorphism
of portion voltage-gated sodium channel gene (vgsc) revealed absence
of l1014f/s kdr mutation identified 3 novel amino acid changes i877l,
v881l a1007s. however, association established vgsc
polymorphism pyrethroid/ddt resistance. ddt resistant 119f-gste2 allele
(52%) dieldrin resistant 296s-rdl allele (45%) detected in
gounougou. temporal analysis 2006, 2012 2015 collections revealed
that 119f-gste2 allele relatively stable whereas significant decrease
is observed 296s-rdl allele.
conclusion: multiple resistance coupled temporal increased in
resistance intensity highlights need take urgent measures prolong the
efficacy current insecticide-based interventions an. funestus 
african region.
