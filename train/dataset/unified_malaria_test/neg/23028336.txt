protein phosphorylation dephosphorylation (catalysed kinases and
phosphatases, respectively) post-translational modifications play key
roles many eukaryotic signalling pathways, often deregulated a
number pathological conditions humans. malaria parasite plasmodium, 
functional insights kinome recently achieved, over
half essential blood stage development another 14 kinases being
essential sexual development mosquito transmission. however, functions
for plasmodial protein phosphatases unknown. here, use reverse 
genetics rodent malaria model, plasmodium berghei, examine role 
a unique protein phosphatase containing kelch-like domains (termed ppkl) a
family related arabidopsis bsu1. phylogenetic analysis confirmed the
family bsu1-like proteins including ppkl encoded genomes land
plants, green algae alveolates, eukaryotic lineages.
furthermore, ppkl observed distinct family, separate most
closely-related phosphatase family, pp1. genetic approach, c-terminal gfp 
fusion ppkl showed active protein phosphatase preferentially expressed in
female gametocytes ookinetes. deletion endogenous ppkl gene caused
abnormal ookinete development differentiation, dissociated apical
microtubules inner-membrane complex, generating immotile phenotype
and failure invade mosquito mid-gut epithelium. observations were
substantiated changes localisation cytoskeletal tubulin actin, and
the micronemal protein ctrp knockout mutant assessed indirect
immunofluorescence. finally, increased mrna expression dozi, rna helicase

post-fertilisation indicating major changes first hours zygote
development. work demonstrates stage-specific essentiality unique
ppkl enzyme, modulates parasite differentiation, motility transmission.
