background: primary target human immune response malaria
parasite plasmodium falciparum, p. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1
(pfemp1), encoded members hyper-diverse var gene family. the
parasite exhibits antigenic variation via mutually exclusive expression
(switching) ~60 var genes within genome. thought different 
variants exhibit different host endothelial binding preferences turn
result different manifestations disease.
results: var sequences comprise ancient sequence fragments, termed homology
blocks (hbs), recombine exceedingly high rates. use hbs define
distinct var types within local population. reanalyze dataset that
contains clinical var expression data investigate whether hbs allow
for description sequence diversity corresponding biological function,
such improves ability predict disease phenotype parasite
genetics. find even generic set hbs, defined small
number non-local parasites: capture majority local sequence diversity; 
improve ability predict disease severity parasite genetics; and
reveal previously hypothesized yet previously unobserved parasite genetic basis
for two forms severe disease. find expression rates hbs
correlate strongly severe disease phenotypes expression rates 
of classic var dblÎ± tag types, principal components hb expression rate
profiles improve genotype-phenotype models. specifically, within the
large kenyan dataset focus study, observe hb
expression differs significantly severe versus mild disease, for
rosetting versus impaired consciousness associated severe disease. analysis
of second much smaller dataset mali suggests hb-phenotype
associations consistent across geographically distant populations, since we
find evidence suggesting hb-phenotype associations characterize
this population well.
conclusions: distinction rosetting versus impaired consciousness
associated var genes described previously, could have
important implications monitoring, intervention diagnosis. moreover, 
results potential illuminate molecular mechanisms underlying 
complex spectrum severe disease phenotypes associated malaria--an
important objective given 1% p. falciparum infections result
in severe disease.
