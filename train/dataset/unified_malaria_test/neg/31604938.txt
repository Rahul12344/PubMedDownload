elucidating genetic basis metabolic resistance insecticides malaria 
vectors crucial prolonging effectiveness insecticide-based control
tools including long lasting insecticidal nets (llins). here, show that
cis-regulatory variants cytochrome p450 gene, cyp6p9b, associated with
pyrethroid resistance african malaria vector anopheles funestus. a
dna-based assay designed track resistance occurs near fixation in
southern africa west/central africa. applying assay we
demonstrate, using semi-field experimental huts, cyp6p9b-mediated resistance
associates reduced effectiveness llins. furthermore, establish that
cyp6p9b combines another p450, cyp6p9a, additively exacerbate reduced
efficacy insecticide-treated nets. double homozygote resistant mosquitoes
(rr/rr) significantly survive exposure insecticide-treated nets and
successfully blood feed genotypes. study provides tools to
track assess impact multi-gene driven metabolic resistance to
pyrethroids, helping improve resistance management.
