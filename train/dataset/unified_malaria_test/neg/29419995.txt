chemotherapy mainstay malaria control management. time,
chloroquine (cq) drug choice treatment malaria. was
effective forms malaria, cheap readily available. the
increased resistance malaria parasites cq led widespread abandonment 
the drug african asian countries prompting world health
organization. currently, artemisinin-based combination therapy gold
standard treatment malaria. study investigates presence of
the plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) mutant gene,
a molecular marker responsible cq resistance malaria parasites. total of
369 pregnant women microscopically screened malaria infection using thin
and thick blood films stained giemsa. subsequently, malaria parasite dna was
extracted blood malaria positive participants. pfcrt gene was
amplified using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). restriction fragment length
polymorphism analysis gene performed confirm mutant forms. the
results showed 251 (68.0%) participants plasmodium falciparum 
their blood. molecular examination revealed presence pfcrt mutant genes in
28% study population. notwithstanding decline prevalence of
pfcrt t76 mutation since antimalarial policy change nigeria, 28%
prevalence recorded study considered high ten years the
withdrawal cq treatment uncomplicated malaria.
