the regulation variant gene expression plasmodium falciparum still 
partially understood. regulation var genes, studied gene family
involved antigenic variation, orchestrated dynamic pattern of
inherited chromatin states. although recent evidence pointed epigenetic
regulation transcribed repressed rif loci, little known specific 
on/off associated histone modifications individual rif genes. investigate
the chromatin marks transcribed repressed rif loci, cultivated
parasites evaluated transcriptional status chosen rif targets by
qrt-pcr performed chip assays using h3k9ac h3k9me3 antibodies. then
monitored changes epigenetic patterns parasites several
reinvasions also evaluated "poised" mark trophozoites schizonts of
the erythrocytic cycle chip using h3k4me2 specific antibodies. our
results show h3k9 acetylated transcribed rif loci trimethylated or
even unmodified repressed rif loci. transcriptional epigenetic
states inherited several reinvasions. poised modification h3k4me2
showed tendency present loci trophozoites upon
progression schizonts strongly transcribe respective locus. however, 
effect consistently observed monitored loci. data show 
important similarities var transcription-associated chromatin modifications,
the observed swiftly occurring modifications rif loci absence h3k9 
modification point different dynamic recruitment chromatin modifying
enzymes.
