the phylogenetic relationships among hemosporidian parasites, including the
origin plasmodium falciparum, virulent malaria parasite humans,
have heavily debated decades. studies based multiple-gene sequences
have helped settle many controversial phylogenetic issues. however,
denser taxon sampling genome-wide analyses needed confidently resolve 
the evolutionay relationships among hemosporidian parasites. genome sequences 
several plasmodium parasites available species infecting
primates rodents. root phylogenetic tree plasmodium, genomic data
from related parasites birds reptiles required. here, use novel
approach isolate parasite dna microgametes describe first genome 
of bird parasite sister genus plasmodium, haemoproteus tartakovskyi
similar plasmodium parasites, h. tartakovskyi small genome (23.2 mb,
5,990 genes) gc content (25.4%) closer p. falciparum (19.3%) to
plasmodium vivax (42.3%). combined novel transcriptome sequences bird
parasite plasmodium ashfordi, phylogenomic analyses 1,302 orthologous
genes demonstrate mammalian-infecting malaria parasites monophyletic,
thus rejecting repeatedly proposed hypothesis ancestor laverania 
parasites originated secondary host shift birds humans. genes 
genomic features previously found shared p. falciparum bird
malaria parasites, absent mammal malaria parasites, therefore
signatures maintained ancestral states. foresee genome h.
tartakovskyi open new directions comparative evolutionary analyses of
malarial adaptive traits.
