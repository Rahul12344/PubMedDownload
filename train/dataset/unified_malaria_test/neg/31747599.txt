despite key role antibodies play protection, cellular processes
mediating acquisition humoral immunity malaria fully
understood. using infection model severe malaria, find germinal
center (gc) b cells upregulate transcription factor t-bet infection.
molecular cellular analyses reveal t-bet b cells required only
for igg2c switching also favors commitment b cells dark zone of
the gc. t-bet found regulate expression rgs13 cxcr3, of
which contribute to the impaired gc polarization observed absence of
t-bet, resulting reduced ighv gene mutations lower antibody avidity. these
results demonstrate t-bet modulates gc dynamics, thereby promoting the
differentiation b cells increased affinity antigen.
