inferring origin dispersal chloroquine-resistant (cqr) malaria
parasite, plasmodium falciparum, academic public health importance. the
pfcrt gene p. falciparum widely known cqr gene two major
haplotypes gene (cviet svmnt) occur widely across cqr-endemic regions
of globe. india, studies date pfcrt gene indicated the
widespread prevalence svmnt haplotype (prevalent south america 
papua new guinea), whereas cviet haplotype, primarily found southeast
asia, detected high frequency india. distribution pattern of
the two common cqr-pfcrt haplotypes india quite surprising. thus, in
order understand probable evolutionary migration patterns cqr-pfcrt
haplotypes india, generated new sequence data exon 2 pfcrt gene
and collected published information cqr-pfcrt haplotype data india,
papua new guinea, southeast asia south america, performed several
population evolutionary genetic analyses. among several interesting findings,
statistically significant longitudinal clines cviet svmnt haplotypes 
(in opposite directions) india, clustering india papua new
guinea svmnt-specific clade phylogenetic tree, two 
remarkable aspects data. also appears svmnt cviet
haplotypes india migrated southeast asia. particular, whereas the
indian cviet haplotype southeast asian origin, svmnt haplotype,
prevalent india, seems originated papua new guinea entered
india southeast asia.
