gene expression plasmodia integrates post-transcriptional regulation with
epigenetic marking active genomic regions histone post-translational
modifications (ptms). generate insights importance histone ptms to
the entire asexual sexual developmental cycles parasite, used
complementary comparative quantitative chromatin proteomics identify and
functionally characterise histone ptms 8 distinct life cycle stages p.
falciparum parasites. ~500 individual histone ptms identified 106
could stringently validated. 46 individual histone ptms 30 co-existing
ptms fully quantified high confidence. importantly, 15 histone
ptms novel plasmodia (e.g. h3k122ac, h3k27me3, h3k56me3). comparative
nature data revealed highly dynamic histone ptm landscape life
cycle development, set histone ptms (h3k4ac, h3k9me1 h3k36me2)
displaying unique conserved abundance profile exclusively during
gametocytogenesis (p < 0.001). euchromatic histone ptms abundant during
schizogony late gametocytes; heterochromatic ptms mark early gametocytes.
collectively, data provides accurate, complete comparative
chromatin proteomic analyses entire life cycle development malaria
parasites. substantial association histone ptms stage-specific
transition provides insights intricacies characterising plasmodial
developmental biology.
