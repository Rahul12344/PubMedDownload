background: epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection crucial risk factor for
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (npc), mechanism elevated activation
level npc endemic areas remains unclear. study aims identify ebv
natural variations contributed different reactivation potential between
npc endemic non-endemic areas.
methods: 1030 subjects recruited china, including 303 healthy individuals
from two npc non-endemic areas, 483 healthy people three endemic areas and
244 npc patients. among which, saliva dna samples 244 participants were
sequenced ebv immediate early (ie) genes brlf1 bzlf1, their
promoters included; rest 786 subjects used validation of
significant variations among three different populations. haplotype and
population structure analysis conducted. dual-luciferase assay used to
detect promoter activity.
results: total 246 distinct variations detected, 29 showed significant 
difference frequencies healthy people npc endemic area and
non-endemic area. population structure analysis clustered ebv strains 9
subgroups mostly accordance geographical origin samples.
interestingly, two ebv genotypes, rp-v1 rp-v2, identified according to
the linkage relationship variations brlf1 promoter (rp). rp-v1 has
higher frequency npc endemic areas non-endemic areas (52.38% vs
18.15%, p = 2.07 × 10-14), associated higher oral ebv dna levels
(adjusted or = 1.64, 95% ci = 1.21-2.24, p = .002), suggesting powerful
activation ability rp-v1 prototype rp-of ebv strain; on
the contrary, rp-v2 higher frequency npc non-endemic areas endemic
areas (18.48% vs 0.38%, p = 1.17 × 10-7), might represent reduced activation
potential ebv. dual-luciferase assay showed rp-v1 higher promoter 
activity compared rp-v2 (p < .0001). notably, rp-v1 impaired the
transcription repression effect yy1 rp-v2 strengthened transcription
repression effect ebf1 rp. addition, significant differences rta
393-407 ctl epitope may influence recognition rta cd8+ cells
were detected healthy people npc endemic area non-endemic area.
conclusions: study identified natural variations cis-acting elements (yy1
and ebf1) ebv rp altering rp transcription activities, may contribute to
the elevated ebv activation level npc endemic areas non-endemic areas.
