a geographical causal connection long recognized malaria,
epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection burkitt's lymphoma (bl), the
underlying mechanisms remain obscure. potential clues malaria
parasite plasmodium falciparum selectively absorbs vitamin host and
depends biological activities; secondly, alterations vitamin a
(retinoid) metabolism implicated many forms cancer, including bl.
the first author proposed merozoite-stage malaria parasite, emerging
from liver, uses absorbed vitamin cell membrane destabilizer to
invade red blood cells, causing anemia signs symptoms the
disease manifestations endogenous form hypervitaminosis (mawson ar,
path global health 2013;107(3):122-9). repeated episodes malaria would
therefore expected expose tissues affected individuals to
potentially toxic doses vitamin a. proposed episodes activate 
latent ebv infection, turn activates retinoid-responsive genes.
expression genes enhances viral replication induces germinal center 
(gc) b cell expansion, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (aid) expression,
and c-myc translocation, turn predisposes bl. thus, endogenous
form retinoid toxicity related malaria infection may common factor
linking frequent malaria, ebv infection bl, whereby prolonged exposure of
lymphatic tissues high concentrations retinoids may combine induce
b-cell translocation increase risk burkitt's lymphoma.
