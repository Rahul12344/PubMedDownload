parasites biologic medical importance. linkage mapping led to
successful identification genes loci underlying various traits malaria
parasites rodents humans. malaria parasite plasmodium yoelii one of
many malaria species isolated wild african rodents adapted to
grow laboratories. species reproduces many biologic
characteristics human malaria parasites; genetic markers as
microsatellite amplified fragment length polymorphism (aflp) markers have
also developed parasite. thus, genetic studies rodent malaria
parasites performed complement research plasmodium falciparum. here,
we demonstrate techniques producing genetic cross p. yoelii that
were first pioneered drs. david walliker, richard carter, colleagues at
the university edinburgh. genetic crosses p. yoelii rodent
malaria parasites conducted infecting mice mus musculus inoculum
containing gametocytes two genetically distinct clones differ in
phenotypes interest allowing mosquitoes feed infected mice 4 
days infection. presence male female gametocytes mouse
blood microscopically confirmed feeding. within 48 hrs feeding,
in midgut mosquito, haploid gametocytes differentiate male
and female gametes, fertilize, form diploid zygote (fig. 1). during
development zygote ookinete, meiosis appears occur. zygote
is derived cross-fertilization gametes two genetically
distinct parasites, genetic exchanges (chromosomal reassortment cross-overs
between non-sister chromatids pair homologous chromosomes; fig. 2)
may occur, resulting recombination genetic material homologous loci.
each zygote undergoes two successive nuclear divisions, leading four haploid
nuclei. ookinete develops oocyst. oocyst matures,
thousands sporozoites (the progeny cross) formed released 
mosquito hemoceal. sporozoites harvested salivary glands and
injected new murine host, pre-erythrocytic erythrocytic stage
development takes place. erythrocytic forms cloned classified regard
to characters distinguishing parental lines prior genetic linkage
mapping. control infections individual parental clones performed the
same way production genetic cross.
