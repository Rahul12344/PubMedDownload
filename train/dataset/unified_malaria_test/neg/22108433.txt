in order maximise compliance, future antimalarial treatment ideally
require single-dose administration. this, turn, demands new fast-acting
effective drugs. currently, methods measure vitro killing rate of
antimalarials based parasite growth. developed validated a
method determine classify antimalarial agents based cidal or
static activity following quantitative real time pcr (rt-pcr) analysis. the
method described fast, reliable user-friendly technique a
medium throughput. metabolic activity parasite followed measuring
mrna expression levels several genes 5 parasite life cycles. mrna 
the parasite culture retrotranscribed cdna quantified rt-pcr.
this new method provides rapid reproducible way accurately measure the
antimalarial activity new compounds vitro plasmodium falciparum.
