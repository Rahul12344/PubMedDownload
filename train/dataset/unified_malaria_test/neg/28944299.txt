sequenom platform genotype 111 genome-wide distributed single nucleotide
polymorphic (snp) positions 2486 isolates collected children 95
primary schools western kenya. analysed parasite genotypes for

evidence population structure little evidence spatial autocorrelation
of parasite genotypes (correlation coefficients <0.03 among parasite pairs in
distance classes 1km, 2km 5km; p value<0.01). analysis the
geographical distribution allele frequencies showed weak evidence variation
in distribution alleles, clusters representing higher expected

be currently effective sub-national scale western kenya, due the
high parasite movement likely lead re-introduction infection
from surrounding regions. however repeated targeted interventions may reduce
transmission surrounding regions.
