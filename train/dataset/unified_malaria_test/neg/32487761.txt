the heterochromatin environment plays central role silencing genes
associated malaria parasite's development, survival host, and
transmission mosquito vector. however, underlying mechanism regulating
the dynamic chromatin structure understood yet. here, uncovered
that plasmodium falciparum rrp6, orthologue eukaryotic rna
exosome-associated rnase, controls silencing heterochromatic genes. pfrrp6
knockdown disrupted singular expression gc-rich ncrna ruf6 family, a
known critical regulator virulence gene expression, stabilization 
of nascent transcripts. mechanistic investigation showed the
accumulation multiple ruf6 ncrnas triggered local chromatin remodeling 
situ, activated adjacent var genes. strikingly, chromatin isolation
by rna purification analysis (chirp-seq) revealed remarkable ruf6 ncrna
had interacted distal heterochromatin regions directly stimulated a
global derepression effect heterochromatic genes, including variant gene
families sexual commitment-associated regulator ap2-g gene. collectively,
rrp6 appears conduct epigenetic surveillance heterochromatic gene
expression controlling ruf6 levels, thereby securing antigenic variation 
and sexual commitment malaria parasites infection the
host.importance malaria remains major public health economic burden. the
heterochromatin environment controls silencing genes associated the
fate malaria parasites. previous studies demonstrated group of
gc-rich ncrnas (ruf6) associated mutually exclusive expression var
genes, underlying mechanisms remain elusive. here, series of
genetic manipulation genome-wide multiomics analysis, identified 
plasmodial orthologue rna exosome-associated rrp6 upstream regulator 
ruf6 expression revealed dysregulation ruf6 upon rrp6 knockdown
triggered local chromatin alteration, thereby activating heterochromatic
genes via direct interaction ruf6 distal gene loci. finding 
uncovered in-depth mechanism ruf6-mediated regulation heterochromatic
genes also identified rrp6 novel regulator gene expression human
malaria parasites, provides new target developing intervention
