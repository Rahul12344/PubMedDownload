tissue-resident memory cd8+ (trm) cells liver critical long-term
protection pre-erythrocytic plasmodium infection. protection can
usually induced three five doses i.v. administered
radiation-attenuated sporozoites (ras). simplify accelerate vaccination,
we tested dna vaccine designed induce potent cell responses the
syvpsaeqi epitope plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite protein. a
heterologous "prime-and-trap" regimen, priming using gene gun-administered dna
and boosting one dose ras attracted expanding ag-specific cd8+ cell
populations liver, became trm cells. vaccinated manner,
balb/c mice completely protected challenge, outcome reliably 
achieved following one dose ras following dna-only vaccination. study 
demonstrates combination cd8+ cell priming dna boosting with
liver-homing ras enhances formation completely protective liver trm cell
response suggests novel approaches enhancing cell-based
pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccines.
