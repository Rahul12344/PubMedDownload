natural killer (nk) cells play essential role antiviral anti-tumoral
immune responses. peripheral blood, nk cells commonly classified two 
major subsets: cd56brightcd16neg cd56dimcd16pos despite characterization 
of cd56negcd16pos subset 25 years ago. since then, several studies have
described prevalence cd56negcd16pos nk cell subset viral
non-controllers basis nk cell dysfunction. however, the
mechanistic basis cytotoxic impairment unclear. recently, using a
strict flow cytometry gating strategy exclude monocytes, reported an
accumulation cd56negcd16pos nk cells plasmodium falciparum malaria-exposed 
children pediatric cancer patients diagnosed endemic burkitt lymphoma
(ebl). here, use live-sorted cells, histological staining, bulk rna-sequencing
and flow cytometry confirm cd56negcd16pos nk cell subset the
same morphological features nk cell subsets similar
transcriptional profile compared cd56dimcd16pos nk cells 120 genes
differentially expressed (fold change 1.5, p < 0.01 fdr<0.05) 9235 
transcripts. cd56negcd16pos nk cells distinct profile significantly
higher expression mpeg1 (perforin 2), fcgr3b (cd16b), fcgr2a, fcgr2b
(cd32a b) well cd6, cd84, hla-dr, lilrb1/2, pdcd1 (pd-1), whereas
interleukin 18 (il18) receptor genes (il18rap il18r1), cytotoxic genes such
as klrf1 (nkp80) ncr1 (nkp46), inhibitory havcr2 (tim-3) are
significantly down-regulated compared cd56dimcd16pos nk cells. together, these
data confirm cd56negcd16pos cells legitimate nk cells, yet their
transcriptional protein expression profiles suggest cytotoxic potential
is mediated pathways reliant antibodies antibody-dependent cell
cytotoxicity (adcc), antibody-dependent respiratory burst (adrb), enhanced by
complement receptor 3 (cr3) fas/fasl interaction. findings support the
premise chronic diseases induce nk cell modifications circumvent
proinflammatory mediators involved direct cytotoxicity. therefore, individuals
with altered nk cell profiles may respond differently nk-mediated
immunotherapies, infections vaccines depending cytotoxic mechanisms
are engaged.
