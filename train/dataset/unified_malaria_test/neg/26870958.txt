introduction: plasmodium vivax malaria wide geographic distribution and
poses challenges malaria elimination likely greater 
of p. falciparum. diagnostic tools p. vivax infection non-reference
laboratory settings limited microscopy rapid diagnostic tests but
these unreliable low parasitemia. development validation a
high-throughput sensitive assay p. vivax priority.
methods: high-throughput lamp assay targeting p. vivax mitochondrial gene and
deploying colorimetric detection 96-well plate format developed and
evaluated laboratory. diagnostic accuracy compared microscopy,
antigen detection tests pcr validated samples malaria patients
and community controls district hospital setting sabah, malaysia.
results: high throughput lamp-p. vivax assay (htlamp-pv) performed an
estimated limit detection 1.4 parasites/ Î¼l. assay primers demonstrated
cross-reactivity p. knowlesi plasmodium spp. field
testing htlamp-pv conducted using 149 samples symptomatic malaria
patients (64 p. vivax, 17 p. falciparum, 56 p. knowlesi, 7 p. malariae, 1 mixed
p. knowlesi/p. vivax, 4 excluded). compared multiplex pcr,
htlamp-pv demonstrated sensitivity p. vivax 95% (95% ci 87-99%); 61/64),
and specificity 100% (95% ci 86-100%); 25/25) p. knowlesi samples were
excluded. htlamp-pv testing 112 samples asymptomatic community controls, 
7 submicroscopic p. vivax infections pcr, showed sensitivity of
71% (95% ci 29-96%; 5/7) specificity 93% (95% ci87-97%; 98/105).
conclusion: novel htlamp-p. vivax assay potential useful
field applicable molecular diagnostic test p. vivax infection elimination 
settings.
