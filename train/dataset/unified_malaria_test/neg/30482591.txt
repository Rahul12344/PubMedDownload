children age five years old face significant mortality risks around 
the world. public health innovations, particularly gene-editing technologies such
as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr) could help 
to reduce risk death children age five years old. for
example, crispr-based strategies could reduce infectious disease morbidity by
gene editing mosquitoes prevent transmission malaria. crispr gene editing
technology could also help screen influenza virus prevent from
replicating; influenza particularly difficult treat severe virus
causing many deaths children. lack liver, kidney, heart donations
for children organ donation waiting list could also benefit crispr.
gene editing pigs reduce rejection rates associated risks porcine
endogenous retroviruses could allow utilization pig organs for
transplant. review proposed applications gene-editing technology in
public health discuss potential reduce child mortality morbidity
globally.
