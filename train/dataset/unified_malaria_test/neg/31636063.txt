management uncomplicated malaria worldwide threatened emergence in
asia plasmodium falciparum carrying variants pfk13 locus exhibiting
reduced susceptibility artemisinin. mutations two genes, ubp1 and
ap2μ, associated artemisinin resistance rodent malaria with
clinical failure combination therapy african malaria patients. transgenic
p. falciparum clones, carrying orthologues mutations pfap2μ pfubp1
associated artemisinin resistance plasmodium chabaudi, derived by
cas9 gene editing. susceptibility artemisinin antimalarial drugs was
determined. following exposure 700 nm dihydroartemisinin ring-stage
survival assay, found strong evidence transgenic parasites expressing the
i592t variant (11% survival), s160n variant (1% survival), the
ap2μ adaptin subunit significantly less susceptible parental
wild-type parasite population. v3275f variant ubp1, v3306f
variant, also displayed reduced susceptibility dihydroartemisinin (8.5%
survival versus 0.5% survival). ap2μ ubp1 variants elicit reduced
susceptibility 48 h exposure artemisinin antimalarial drugs.
therefore, variants ap2 adaptor complex μ-subunit ubiquitin
hydrolase ubp1 reduce vitro artemisinin susceptibility early ring stage
in p. falciparum findings confirm existence multiple pathways to
perturbation either mode action artemisinin, parasite's adaptive
mechanisms resistance, both. cellular role ubp1 ap2μ in
plasmodium parasites elucidated.
