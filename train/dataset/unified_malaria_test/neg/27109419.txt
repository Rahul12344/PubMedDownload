background: 2007 2013, intensive control measures reduced malaria burden 
by 90 % along china-myanmar border. however, despite measures p.
falciparum malaria outbreak reported special region ii myanmar
in june 2014.
methods: epidemiological, parasitological entomological investigations were
performed. dihydroartemisinin piperaquine (dapq) immediately administered 
treat parasite positive individuals. long lasting insecticidal nets (llin),
indoor residual spraying (irs) insecticides behavior change
communication (bcc) also provided outbreak control. embedded efficacy
study conducted evaluating dp. molecular genotyping via polymerase chain
reaction (pcr) performed kelch gene chromosome 13.
results: infections identified plasmodium falciparum rdt and
microscopy. two fatalities resulted outbreak. attack rate 72.8 %
(67/92) incidence density rate 14.2 per 100 person-weeks. the
positive rate rapid diagnostic test (rdt) 72.2 % (65/90) and
microscopically-determine parasite rate 42.2 % (38/90). adjusted odds ratio (or) 
of multivariate logistic regression analysis aged <15 years, 15-45 years,
inappropriate treatment private healer lack bed nets 13.51 (95
% confidence interval, 2.21-105.89), 7.75 (1.48-44.97), 3.78 (1.30-46.18) and
3.21(1.21-15.19) respectively. six surrounding communities outbreak
site, positive rdt rate 1.2 % (4/328) microscopically-determine parasite 
rate 0.6 % (2/328). two light traps collected total 110 anopheline
mosquitoes including local vectors, an. minimus, an. sinensis an. maculates. 
after intensive control, detection malaria attacks, parasites antigen 
were reduced zero july 1 december 1, 2014. cure rate p.
falciparum patients day 42 94.3 % (95 % ci, 80.8-99.3 %). pcr 
detect k13-propeller mutations.
conclusion: imported p. falciparum caused outbreak. age, seeking
inappropriate treatment lack bed nets risk factors infection
during outbreak. p. falciparum sensitive treatment dapq. the
integrated measures controlled outbreak prevented spread p.
falciparum effectively. results study indicate malaria control
on china-myanmar border, especially among special populations, needs 
collaboration china, myanmar international societies.
