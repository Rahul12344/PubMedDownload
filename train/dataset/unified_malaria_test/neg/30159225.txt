objectives: cyp2b6 one polymorphic cyp genes humans that
has potential modify pharmacological toxicological responses to
clinically important drugs antimalarial artemisinin derivatives. 
the aim study determine frequency cyp2b6 polymorphisms in
timor malaria endemic area, east nusa tenggara, indonesia artemisin-based
combination therapy (act) used treat uncomplicated malaria.
methods: total 109 healthy subjects participated study.
cyp2b6*4, *6 *9 polymorphisms analyzed using pcr-rflp confirm the
snps prevalence 516g>t 785a>g exon 4 5.
results: 96 subjects included analysis. exon 4 cyp2b6
516g>t, frequency mutation 37.5% (39/96), wildtype 27.1%
(26/96). exon 5, cyp2b6 785a>g mutant detected 29.2% (28/96) of
individuals, wildtype allele 35.4% (34/96). frequency cyp2b6*9 
(516g>t), cyp2b6*4 (785a>g) cyp2b6*6 (516g>t 785a>g) 40.6%, 29.2%
and 22.9%, respectively. prevalence cyp2b6 gene polymorphisms in
timorian ethnic higher malay, han chinese, indian, egyptian
populations.
conclusion: prevalence cyp2b6 516g>t 785a>g polymorphisms in
timorian ethnic higher populations. polymorphisms may
affect metabolism artemisinin derivatives.
