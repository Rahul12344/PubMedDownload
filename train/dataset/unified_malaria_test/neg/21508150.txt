a cytochrome b (cytb) gene quantitative pcr (qpcr) assay developed to
diagnose malaria travelers. first, manual automated dna extractions were
compared automated dna extraction 400 μl blood found more
efficient. sensitivity estimated using international standard for
plasmodium falciparum dna compared previously published qpcr
targeting 18s rrna coding gene (18s qpcr). limit detection cytb
qpcr assay 20 dna copies (i.e., 1 parasite equivalent) per 400 μl of
extracted whole blood comparable two qpcr assays. qpcr
assays used blood samples 265 consecutive patients seen for
suspicion malaria. microscopy-positive qpcr-negative
samples. positive cytb qpcr results observed 51 samples, 1
were also 18s qpcr positive. eight (16%) 51 samples negative by
microscopic examination. 8 cytb qpcr-positive microscopy-negative samples
were african patients, 3 received antimalarial drugs. three
non-p. falciparum infections correctly identified using additional qpcr
assay. absence pcr inhibitors tested use internal
control mouse dna allow reliable quantification circulating dna. the
high analytical sensitivity qpcr assays combined automated dna
extraction supports use laboratory tool diagnosis parasitemia
determination emergencies. whether treat qpcr-positive and
microscopy-negative patients remains determined.
