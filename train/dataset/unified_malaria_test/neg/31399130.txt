background: final phase china's national programme eliminate malaria
by 2020, vitally important monitor resistance malaria vectors for
developing effective vector control strategies. 2017 shanghai declared it
had eliminated malaria; however, insecticide resistance status primary
malaria vector anopheles sinensis remains unknown.
methods: examined pyrethroid organophosphate resistance an.
sinensis via bioassay two populations chongming district of
shanghai. voltage-gated sodium channel (vgsc) acetylcholinesterase 1
(ace-1) genes partially sequenced examine association between
resistance phenotype target site genotype. addition, geographical
distribution, polymorphism genotype frequencies insecticide resistance
genes examined using samples collected routine mosquito surveillance 
in 2016 2017 chongming, songjiang, jiading qingpu districts.
results: chongming district, an. sinensis population near dongtan national
nature reserve showed resistance pyrethroids, sensitivity organophosphate, 
no knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations vgsc gene, low frequency
(1.71%) ace-1 119s allele. an. sinensis population near chongming
central area (cm-xinhe population) showed high resistance pyrethroids and
organophosphates high frequencies kdr 1014f 1014c (80.73%) ace-1
119s (85.98%) alleles. significant association detected the
homozygous kdr mutation 1014f/1014f pyrethroid resistance cm-xinhe
population, indicating kdr mutation probably recessive. eight kdr
genotypes 1014f 1014c substitutions detected four surveyed
districts shanghai. ttt ggc/agc dominant kdr allele ace-1
genotype, respectively, prevalent shanghai an. sinensis
populations.
conclusions: basis assessment insecticide resistance gene
mutations shanghai, identified kdr mutation-free population chongming 
dongtan. however, high frequencies target-site mutations insecticide
resistance genes observed areas shanghai. bioassays an.
sinensis populations central chongming district indicated high
insecticide resistance status an. sinensis populations shanghai. we
accordingly recommend restriction insecticide usage development of
effective integrated pest/vector management interventions support disease
control efforts.
