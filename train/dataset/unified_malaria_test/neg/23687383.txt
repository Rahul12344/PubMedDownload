in plasmodium falciparum, deadliest form human malaria, nuclear
periphery drawn much attention due role sub-nuclear compartment
involved virulence gene expression. recent data implicated components 
the nuclear envelope regulating gene expression several eukaryotes. special
attention given nucleoporins compose nuclear pore complex
(npc). however, little known components nuclear envelope 
plasmodium parasites. characterize pfsec13, unusual nucleoporin p. 
falciparum, shows unique structural similarities suggesting a
fusion sec13 nup145c yeast. using super resolution fluorescence
microscopy (3d-sim) vivo imaging, show dynamic localization of
pfsec13 parasites' intra-erythrocytic development corresponds of
the npcs dynamics associated microtubules rather than
with f-actin. addition, pfsec13 co-localize heterochormatin 
markers hp1 h3k9me3, suggesting euchromatic location npcs. the
proteins associated pfsec13 indicate unusual nup involved in
several cellular processes. indeed, ultrastructural chromatin
immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that, addition npcs, pfsec13 is
found nucleoplasm associated chromatin. finally, used 
peptide nucleic acids (pna) downregulate pfsec13 show essential
for parasite proliferation human erythrocytes.
