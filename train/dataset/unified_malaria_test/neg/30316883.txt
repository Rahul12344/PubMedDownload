malaria age-old disease human kind living tropical and
sub-tropical regions globe, africa contributing highest incidence
of morbidity mortality. among many hurdles, evolution spread of
drug-resistant plasmodium falciparum parasites constitute major challenges to
malaria control elimination. information molecular epidemiology and
pattern evolution genes conferring resistance different antimalarials
are needed track route spread resistant parasites also to
inform drug-resistant genes adapted population following the
darwinian model evolution. present study, followed molecular
methods detect known emerging mutations three genes (pfcrt,
pfdhfr pfdhps) p. falciparum conferring resistance chloroquine and
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine two different states (edo: meso-endemic lagos:
hypo-endemic) southwestern nigeria. high diversities haplotypes and
nucleotides genes responsible chloroquine (pfcrt) sulfadoxine (pfdhps)
resistance recorded. 96% pfdhfr pfdhps gene meso-
and hypo- endemic areas mutant type, followed 61% pfcrt gene. many
unique haplotypes pfdhps pfcrt found segregated two
populations. one particular mutant haplotype pfdhfr (airni) found in
very high frequency lagos edo. net haplotype diversity 
highest pfdhps (0.81 lagos, 0.87 edo), followed pfcrt (0.69 lagos,
0.65 edo); highest number haplotype found pfdhps 13 distinct
haplotypes, followed seven pfcrt four pfdhfr gene. moreover,
detection strong linkage among mutations pfcrt pfdhfr feeble
evidence balancing selection pfdhps indicative evolutionary
potential mutation genes responsible drug resistance nigerian
populations p. falciparum.
