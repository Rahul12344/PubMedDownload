female mosquitoes species generalists blood-feed a
variety vertebrate hosts, whereas others display marked host preference.
anopheles gambiae aedes aegypti evolved strong preference humans, 
making dangerously efficient vectors malaria dengue haemorrhagic
fever. specific host odours probably drive strong preference other
attractive cues, including body heat exhaled carbon dioxide (co2), common
to warm-blooded hosts. insects sense odours via several chemosensory receptor
families, including odorant receptors (ors), membrane proteins form
heteromeric odour-gated ion channels comprising variable ligand-selective
subunit obligate co-receptor called orco (ref. 6). use zinc-finger
nucleases generate targeted mutations orco gene a. aegypti to
examine contribution orco odorant receptor pathway mosquito
host selection sensitivity insect repellent deet
(n,n-diethyl-meta-toluamide). orco mutant olfactory sensory neurons greatly 
reduced spontaneous activity lack odour-evoked responses. behaviourally, orco
mutant mosquitoes severely reduced attraction honey, odour cue related
to floral nectar, respond human scent absence co2.
however, presence co2, female orco mutant mosquitoes retain strong
attraction human animal hosts, longer strongly prefer humans. 
orco mutant females attracted human hosts even presence deet,
but repelled upon contact, indicating olfactory- contact-mediated
effects deet mechanistically distinct. conclude odorant
receptor pathway crucial anthropophilic vector mosquito discriminate
human non-human hosts effectively repelled volatile deet.
