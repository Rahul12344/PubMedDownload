background: plasmodium falciparum genetic polymorphisms mediate altered drug
sensitivity may impact upon virulence. cross-sectional study, ugandan
children infections mutant pfcrt k76t, pfmdr1 n86y, pfmdr1 d1246y 
about one-fourth odds symptomatic malaria compared with
infections wild type (wt) sequences. however, results may been
confounded greater likelihood symptomatic disease higher
density mixed infections and/or recent prior treatment selected wt
alleles.
methods: polymorphisms samples paired episodes asymptomatic and
symptomatic parasitaemia 114 subjects aged 4-11 years followed
longitudinally tororo district, uganda. paired episodes occurred within
3-12 months treatment malaria prior 60 days. 
the prevalence wt, mixed, mutant alleles determined using multiplex
ligase detection reaction-fluorescent microsphere assays.
results: considering paired episodes subject, odds symptomatic
malaria lower infections mutant compared wt mixed sequence at
n86y (or 0.26, 95% ci 0.09-0.79, p = 0.018), k76t d1246y. however,
symptomatic episodes (which higher densities) likely than
asymptomatic mixed (for n86y 2.0, 95% ci 1.04-4.0, p = 0.036). excluding
mixed infections, odds symptomatic malaria lower infections 
mutant compared wt sequence n86y (or 0.33, 95% ci 0.11-0.98, p = 0.046),
but alleles. however, mixed genotypes grouped mutants 
in analysis assuming mixed infections consisted 50% wt 50%
mutant genotypes, odds symptomatic infection differ between
infections mutant wt studied alleles.
conclusions: although infections mutant pfmdr1 86y genotype were
associated symptomatic infection, association could primarily be
explained greater parasite densities therefore greater prevalence mixed
infections symptomatic children. results indicate limited association
between tested polymorphisms risk symptomatic disease highlight
the value longitudinal studies assessing associations parasite
factors clinical outcomes.
