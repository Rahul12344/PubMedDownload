artemisinin preferred medicine treatment malaria. study,
aacmk, key gene involved upstream pathway artemisinin biosynthesis,
was cloned characterized artemisia annua first time. the
full-length cdna aacmk 1 462 bp contained orf 1 197 bp that
encoded 399-anomo-acid polypeptide. tissue expression pattern analysis showed
that aacmk expressed leaves, flowers, roots stems, higher
expression level glandular secretory trichomes. addition, expression of
aacmk markedly increased meja treatment. subcellular localization
showed protein encoded aacmk localized chloroplast.
overexpression aacmk arabidopsis increased contents chlorophyll a,
chlorophyll b carotenoids. results suggest aacmk plays an
important role biosynthesis terpenoids a. annua research
provids candidate gene could used engineering artemisinin
biosynthesis.
