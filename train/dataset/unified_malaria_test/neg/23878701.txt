detection plasmodium species microscopy gold standard for
diagnosis malaria century. despite fact a
significant decline number positive cases reported microscopy,
antimalarial drugs prescriptions continuous increase patients present
with symptoms malaria. makes difficult establish accuracy,
sensitivity specificity light microscopy diagnosis malaria in
epidemic areas. study designed compare microscopy polymerase
chain reaction diagnostic methods malaria three epidemic areas in
kenya. total 356 patients presenting malaria symptoms diagnosed by
microscopy dried blood filter paper spots collected patient in
kisii, west pokot narok districts. plasmodium falciparum dna extracted
from dried blood filter samples. primers specific plasmodium species 
were designed used two step amplification pfmdr gene. pcr
products analyzed ethidium bromide stained 1.5% agarose gel. found
that 72 350 specimens diagnosed negative positive p.
falciparum nested pcr, 6 microscopy positive confirmed
so nested pcr. study demonstrates high level of
misdiagnosis may either lead denial deserved treatment undeserved
treatment. nested pcr detection malaria parasites useful complement 
to microscopy although expensive takes long time. additionally, smear
negative patients suspected malaria subjected pcr diagnosis 
to improve rational drug use. economic burden misdiagnosis and
mistreatment malaria outweighs pcr diagnosis, hence diagnostic
mode could tenable long run even rural areas.
