erythrocyte invasion merozoites obligatory stage plasmodium infection
and essential disease progression. proteins apical organelles of
merozoites mediate invasion erythrocytes potential malaria vaccine
candidates. rhoptry-associated, leucine zipper-like protein 1 (ralp1) of
plasmodium falciparum previously found specifically expressed in
schizont stages localized rhoptries merozoites by
immunofluorescence assay (ifa). also, ralp1 refractory gene knockout 
attempts, suggesting essential blood-stage parasite survival.
these characteristics suggest ralp1 potential blood-stage vaccine
candidate antigen, assessed potential regard. antibodies 
were raised recombinant ralp1 proteins synthesized using wheat
germ cell-free system. immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated first time 
that ralp1 rhoptry neck protein merozoites. moreover, ifa data showed
that ralp1 translocates rhoptry neck moving junction during
merozoite invasion. growth invasion inhibition assays revealed that
anti-ralp1 antibodies inhibit invasion erythrocytes merozoites. the
findings ralp1 possesses erythrocyte-binding epitope c-terminal
region anti-ralp1 antibodies disrupt tight-junction formation, are
evidence ralp1 plays important role merozoite invasion of
erythrocytes. addition, human sera collected areas thailand mali
where malaria endemic recognized protein. overall, findings indicate 
that ralp1 rhoptry neck erythrocyte-binding protein qualifies as
a potential blood-stage vaccine candidate.
