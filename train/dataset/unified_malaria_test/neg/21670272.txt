toxoplasma gondii member phylum apicomplexa includes several
important human pathogens, cryptosporidium plasmodium falciparum, the
causative agent human malaria. obligate intracellular parasite that
can cause severe disease congenitally infected neonates immunocompromised 
individuals. despite importance attachment invasion success 
the parasite, little known underlying mechanisms drive these
processes. describe screen identify small molecules block the
process host cell invasion t. gondii parasite. identified small
molecule specifically irreversibly blocks parasite attachment and
subsequent invasion host cells. using tandem orthogonal
proteolysis-activity-based protein profiling, determined compound
covalently modifies single cysteine residue poorly characterized protein
homologous human protein dj-1. mutation key cysteine residue in
the native gene sequence resulted parasites resistant inhibition 
of host cell attachment invasion compound. analysis the
invasion phenotype confirmed modification cys127 tgdj-1 resulted 
block microneme secretion motility, even presence direct
stimulators calcium release. together, results suggest tgdj-1 plays
an important role likely downstream calcium flux required for
microneme secretion, parasite motility, subsequent invasion host cells.
