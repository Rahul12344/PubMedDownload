objective: identity plasmodium ovale infection 18s rrna gene nested pcr.
methods: whole blood filter paper blood samples malaria patients in
shandong province collected 2012-2013. parasites observed
under microscope giemsa staining. genome dna blood samples were
extracted pcr templates. genus- species-specific primers designed
according plasmodium 18s rrna gene sequences. plasmodium ovale-positive
specimens identified nested pcr well verified sequencing.
results: 7 imported cases p. ovale infection province during
2012-2013. nested pcr results showed p. ovale specific band (800 bp) was
amplified 7 specimens. blast results indicated pcr products
were consistent plasmodium ovale reference sequence genbank.
conclusion: seven imported cases ovale malaria shandong province in
2012-2013 confirmed nested pcr.
