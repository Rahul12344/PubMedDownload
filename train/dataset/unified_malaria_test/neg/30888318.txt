plasmodium parasites possess protein homology niemann-pick type c1
proteins (niemann-pick type c1-related protein, ncr1). isolated parasites with
resistance-conferring mutations plasmodium falciparum ncr1 (pfncr1) during
selections three diverse small-molecule antimalarial compounds show that
the mutations causative compound resistance. pfncr1 protein knockdown
results severely attenuated growth confers hypersensitivity the
compounds. compound treatment protein knockdown leads increased sensitivity
of parasite plasma membrane (ppm) amphipathic glycoside saponin and
engenders digestive vacuoles (dvs) small malformed. immuno-electron 
microscopy split-gfp experiments localize pfncr1 ppm. experiments 
show pfncr1 activity critically important composition ppm 
and required dv biogenesis, suggesting pfncr1 novel antimalarial drug
target.editorial note: article editorial process in
