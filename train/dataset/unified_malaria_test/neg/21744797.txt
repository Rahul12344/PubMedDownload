previous work laboratory optimized meoh-inducible expression p.
falciparum malarial parasite transporter pfcrt p. pastoris yeast. these
strains useful many experiments allow inducible protein
expression ambient growth conditions. therefore optimized
galactose-inducible expression pfcrt s. cerevisiae yeast. find that
expression pfcrt confers cq hypersensitivity growing yeast is
due plasma membrane localization transporter. use quantitative
analyses growth rates compare hypersensitivity yeast expressing various
pfcrt isoforms. also report successful high level inducible expression 
p. vivax orthologue, pvcrt, compare cq hypersensitivity pvcrt vs pfcrt
expressing yeast. test hypothesis hypersensitivity due to
increased transport cq yeast expressing transporters via direct
(3)h-cq transport experiments analyze effect membrane potential 
on transport. data suggest important new tools rapid functional screening
of pfcrt pvcrt isoforms provide evidence model wherein
membrane potential promotes charged cq transport pfcrt. data also support 
previous conclusion wild type pfcrt capable cq transport provide a
basis understanding lack correspondence pvcrt mutations and
resistance cq important malarial parasite p. vivax.
