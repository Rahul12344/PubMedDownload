antigenic variation fool immune system one molecular tricks
plasmodium uses maintain infection human host. exclusive expression
of surface-exposed pfemp1 molecules, encoded var genes, best
example this. central questions regarding dynamics antigenic
variation, namely rate switching regulation var gene expression
in plasmodium falciparum, yet unanswered. elucidate vivo situation,
we studied var gene switching analysing var transcripts parasites
isolated 20 non-immune malaria patients well subsequent in
vitro generations. parasites found highly co-ordinated whole
population isolated individual patients usually expressed one dominant 
- preferentially group -var gene. isolates low switching
rates, others switched var gene expression every generation. however,
during extended cultivation co-ordinated expression switching lost
resulting random expression var gene groups. switching observed on
the rna level also supported protein level using pfemp1-specific
antibodies. results suggest var genes switch ordered, hierarchical
manner much higher rates previously described.
