recently shown rodent malaria models immunisation with
genetically attenuated plasmodium parasites confer sterile protection against
challenge virulent parasites. mass production live attenuated
plasmodium parasites vaccination, safety prerequisite. knockout a
single gene sufficient strategy since parasite likely
compensate genetic modification single surviving parasite is
sufficient kill immunised individual. parasites must therefore least 
double-attenuated generating safe vaccine strain. genetic
double-attenuation achieved knocking two essential genes by
combining single gene knockout expression protein toxic the
parasite. generated double-attenuated plasmodium berghei strain is
deficient fatty acid synthesis knockout pdh-e1α gene,
introducing second attenuation liver stage-specific expression the
pore-forming bacterial toxin perfringolysin o. double genetically
attenuated parasite strain, superior attenuation indeed achieved compared
with single-attenuated strains either deficient pyruvate
dehydrogenase (pdh)-e1 expressed perfringolysin o. vivo, both
single-attenuated strains resulted breakthrough infections even low to
moderate doses sporozoites (2,000-5,000) administered. contrast, the
double genetically attenuated parasite strain, given moderate doses 5,000
sporozoites, result blood stage infection even administered
at 5- 20-fold higher doses, single delayed breakthrough infections
were observed. prime booster immunisation double genetically attenuated 
parasite strain completely protected susceptible mouse strain malaria
