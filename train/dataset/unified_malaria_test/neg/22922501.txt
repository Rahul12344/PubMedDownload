malaria afflicts 200 million people worldwide, lethal etiologic
agent, plasmodium falciparum, evolving resist even latest-generation
therapeutics. efficient tools genome-directed investigations p.
falciparum-induced pathogenesis, including drug-resistance mechanisms, are
clearly required. report rapid targeted genetic engineering this
parasite using zinc-finger nucleases (zfns) produce double-strand break in
a user-defined locus trigger homology-directed repair. targeting an
integrated egfp locus, obtained gene-deletion parasites unprecedented
speed (2 weeks), without direct selection. zfns engineered 
the parasite gene pfcrt, responsible escape chloroquine treatment,
rapidly produced parasites carried either allelic replacement panel 
of specified point mutations. method enable diverse array of
genome-editing approaches interrogate human pathogen.
