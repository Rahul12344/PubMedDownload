cyclic nucleotide signalling major regulator malaria parasite
differentiation. phosphodiesterase (pde) enzymes known control cyclic gmp 
(cgmp) levels parasite, mechanisms cyclic amp (camp) is
regulated remain enigmatic. here, demonstrate plasmodium falciparum
phosphodiesterase β (pdeβ) hydrolyses camp cgmp essential for
blood stage viability. conditional gene disruption causes profound reduction in
invasion erythrocytes rapid death merozoites invade. show
that dual phenotype results elevated camp levels hyperactivation of
the camp-dependent protein kinase (pka). phosphoproteomic analysis pdeβ-null
parasites reveals >2-fold increase phosphorylation 200 phosphosites,
more half conform pka substrate consensus sequence. we
conclude pdeβ plays critical role governing correct temporal activation
of pka required erythrocyte invasion, whilst suppressing untimely pka
activation early intra-erythrocytic development.
