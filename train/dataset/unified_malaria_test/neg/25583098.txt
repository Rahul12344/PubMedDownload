a chromosome inversion spread captures locally adapted alleles or
when introduced species hybridization adapted alleles that
were previously absent. present model shows processes can
cause species range expand. introgression inversion carries
novel, locally adapted alleles particularly powerful mechanism range
expansion. model supports earlier proposal introgression an
inversion triggered large range expansion malaria mosquito. results 
suggest role inversions cassettes genes accelerate
adaptation crossing species boundaries, rather protecting genomes from
introgression.
