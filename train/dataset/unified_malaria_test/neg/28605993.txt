the malaria infection interplay several complex factors, among which
drug resistance gametocyte biology crucial ones. measurements 
drug sensitivity assays prevalence gametocyte genes play major role in
malaria eradication programmes. purpose study assess the
current drug sensitivity profile field isolates type pfg377 gene. 
in vitro drug sensitivity assay used assess susceptibility of
plasmodium falciparum field isolates collected mewat (haryana), located in
northern region india four anti-malarial drugs. inhibitory
concentrations (ic50) four drugs viz chloroquine (cq), artesunate (as),
sulphadoxine (sd) pyrimethamine (pyr) range 10.11-113.2,
2.26-4.08, 13.31-43.91 0.76-4.91 nm respectively evaluated 25 field
isolates. pfg377 allele typing 26 field isolates revealed different
types haplotypes (a, b, c d) varying size number repeats and
deletions. pfg377 allelic types cryopreserved adapted isolates 
p. falciparum compared determine parasite lines them. allele
types presence different clones sample could correlated 
significantly resistance four drugs tested study. our
study revealed different drug sensitivity profiles field isolates mewat
region allele typing pfg377 gene revealed different haplotypes field
isolates circulating parasite population.
