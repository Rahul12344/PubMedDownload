background: resistance mosquitoes insecticides growing concern in
africa. since insecticides used public health limited
development new molecules expected next decade, maintaining the
efficacy control programmes mostly relies resistance management strategies.
developing strategies requires deep understanding factors influencing
resistance together characterizing mechanisms involved. among factors
likely influence insecticide resistance mosquitoes, agriculture and
urbanization implicated rarely studied detail. present study
aimed comparing insecticide resistance levels associated mechanisms across
multiple anopheles gambiae sensu lato populations different environments.
methods: nine populations sampled three areas tanzania showing
contrasting agriculture activity, urbanization usage insecticides for
vector control. insecticide resistance levels measured larvae adults 
through bioassays deltamethrin, ddt bendiocarb. distribution an. 
gambiae sub-species pyrethroid target-site mutations (kdr) investigated 
using molecular assays. microarray approach used identifying
transcription level variations associated different environments and
insecticide resistance.
results: elevated resistance levels deltamethrin ddt identified in
agriculture urban areas compared susceptible strain kisumu. a
significant correlation found adult deltamethrin resistance and
agriculture activity. subspecies anopheles arabiensis predominant with
only an. gambiae sensu stricto identified urban area dar es salaam.
the l1014s kdr mutation detected elevated frequency gambiae s.s. 
the urban area remains sporadic an. arabiensis specimens. microarrays
identified 416 transcripts differentially expressed area versus the
susceptible reference strain supported impact agriculture on
resistance mechanisms multiple genes encoding pesticide targets,
detoxification enzymes proteins linked neurotransmitter activity affected.
in contrast, resistance mechanisms found urban area appeared specific
and related use insecticides vector control.
conclusions: overall, study confirmed role environment shaping
insecticide resistance mosquitoes major impact agriculture
activities. results discussed relation resistance mechanisms the
optimization resistance management strategies.
