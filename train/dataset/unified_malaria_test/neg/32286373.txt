the malaria parasite replicates asexually red blood cells its
vertebrate host employing epigenetic mechanisms regulate gene expression in
response changes environment. used chromatin immunoprecipitation
followed sequencing conjunction rna sequencing create epigenomic
and transcriptomic map developmental transition asexual blood stages 
to male female gametocytes ookinetes rodent malaria parasite
plasmodium berghei. across developmental stages examined, heterochromatin
protein 1 associates variantly expressed gene families localised at
subtelomeric regions variant gene expression based heterochromatic
silencing observed genes. conversely, euchromatin mark
histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (h3k9ac) abundant non-heterochromatic
regions across developmental stages. h3k9ac presents distinct pattern of
enrichment around start codon ribosomal protein genes stages but
male gametocytes. additionally, h3k9ac occupancy positively correlates with
transcript abundance stages female gametocytes suggesting that
transcription stage independent h3k9ac levels. finding
together known mrna repression female gametocytes suggests multilayered
mechanism operating female gametocytes preparation fertilization and
zygote development, coinciding parasite transition host vector.
