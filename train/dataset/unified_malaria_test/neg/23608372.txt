objective: evaluate microscopy, optimal(®) multiplex pcr the
identification plasmodium falciparumm (p. falciparum) plasmodium vivax (p.
vivax) field isolates bikaner, rajasthan (northwest india).
methods: study, multiplex pcr (p. falciparum p. vivax) 
developed incorporation plasmodium malariae (p. malariae) specific
primer also positive control. performance microscopy, plasmodium
lactate dehydrogenase (pldh) based malaria rapid diagnostic test optimal(®) and
18s rrna gene based multiplex pcr diagnosis p. falciparum p. vivax
was compared.
results: three species multiplex pcr (p. falciparum, p. vivax p.
malariae) inbuilt positive control developed evaluated. in
comparison multiplex pcr, showed sensitivity specificity of
99.36% (95%ci, 98.11%-100.00%) 100.00% (95%ci, 100.00%-100.00%), the
sensitivity specificity microscopy 90.44% (95%ci, 88.84%-95.04%) and
99.22% (95%ci, 97.71%-100.00%), optimal(®) 93.58% (95%ci, 89.75%-97.42%) 
and 97.69% (95%ci, 95.10%-100.00%). efficiencies 99.65%, 95.10% and
95.45% multiplex pcr, microscopy optimal(®), respectively.
conclusions: results raise concerns overall sensitivities of
microscopy optimal(®), compared multiplex pcr thus stress the
need new molecular interventions accurate detection malarial
parasites. highlights fact developments needed 
to improve performance rapid diagnostic tests field level.
