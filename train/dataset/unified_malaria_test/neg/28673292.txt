background: pregnancy considerable effects pharmacokinetic properties 
of drugs used treat uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum malaria. role of
pharmacogenetic variation anti-malarial drug disposition efficacy during
pregnancy well investigated. study aimed examine effect of
pharmacogenetics lumefantrine (lf) pharmacokinetics treatment outcome in
pregnant women.
methods: pregnant women uncomplicated falciparum malaria enrolled and
treated artemether-lumefantrine (alu) mkuranga kisarawe district
hospitals coast region tanzania. day-7 lf plasma concentration and
genotyping forcyp2b6 (c.516g>t, c.983t>c), cyp3a4*1b, cyp3a5 (*3, *6, *7) and
abcb1 c.4036a4g determined. blood smear parasite quantification by
microscopy, dried blood spot parasite screening genotyping using qpcr
and nested pcr collected enrolment day 28 differentiate 
reinfection recrudescence. treatment response recorded following who
protocol.
results: total, 92 pregnant women second third trimester were
included study 424 samples screened presence p.
falciparum. parasites detected follow period 11 (12%) women
between day 7 28 treatment pcr genotyping confirmed recrudescent
infection 7 (63.3%) women. remaining four (36.4%) pregnant women had
reinfection: one day 14 three day 28. overall pcr-corrected
treatment failure rate 9.0% (95% ci 4.4-17.4). day 7 lf concentration not
significantly influenced cyp2b6, cyp3a4*1b abcb1 c.4036a>g genotypes.
significant associations cyp3a5 genotype day 7 plasma lf
concentrations found, higher carriers cyp3a5 defective variant
alleles cyp3a5*1/*1 genotype. significant influence cyp2b6, cyp3a5 and
abcb1 c.4036a>genotypes malaria treatment outcome observed. however,
cyp3a4*1b affect malaria treatment outcome pregnant women followed 
28 days (p = 0.018).
conclusions: genetic variations cyp3a4 cyp3a5may influence lf
pharmacokinetics treatment outcome pregnant women.
