background: decline efficacy artemisinin-based combination
treatment (act) endemic regions threatens progress towards global
elimination malaria. molecular surveillance drug resistance in
malaria-endemic regions vital detect emergence spread mutant
strains.
methods: observed 89 malaria patients efficacy of
artemether-lumefantrine treatment uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum 
infections lagos, nigeria determined prevalence drug resistant
strains population. parasite clearance rates determined microscopy
and highly sensitive var gene acidic terminal sequence (varats) polymerase
chain reaction 65 patients samples days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 28
after commencement treatment. genomic finger print parasite dna from
pre- post-treatment samples determined using 24 nuclear single
nucleotide polymorphisms (snp) barcode p. falciparum. drug resistance
associated alleles chloroquine resistance transporter gene (crt-76), multidrug
resistance genes (mdr1-86 mdr1-184), dihydropteroate synthase (dhps-540),
dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr-108) kelch domain (k-13580) genotyped by
high resolution melt analysis polymerase chain reaction (pcr) fragments.
results: varats qpcr, 12 (18.5%) participants detectable parasite
dna blood three days treatment, eight (12.3%) individuals
presented genotypable day 28 parasitaemia. complexity infection (coi) was
1.30 day 0 1.34 day 28, mean expected heterozygosity (he) values
across barcodes 0.50 ± 0.05 0.56 ± 0.05 days 0 28
respectively. barcode (π) pairwise comparisons showed high genetic relatedness of
day 0 day 28 parasite isolates three (37.5%) eight individuals 
presented re-appearing infections. crt-76 mutant allele present 38
(58.5%) isolates. mdr1-86 mutant allele found 56 (86.2%) isolates. 
mutation k-13580 observed.
conclusions: persistence dna-detectable parasitaemia 18% cases
after treatment indications genetic relatedness pre- and
post-treatment infections warrants investigation larger population
for signs reduced act efficacy nigeria.
