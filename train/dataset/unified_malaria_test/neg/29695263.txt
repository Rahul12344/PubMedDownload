background: vectors mosquito-borne diseases sri lanka, except malaria, 
belong subfamily culicinae, includes nearly 84% mosquito
fauna country. hence, accurate precise species identification of
culicine mosquitoes crucial factor implementing effective vector control 
strategies. present study, combined effort using morphology dna 
barcoding made characterize mosquitoes subfamily culicinae 
first time nine districts sri lanka. cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1
(cox1) gene mitochondrial genome internal transcribed spacer 2
(its2) region nuclear ribosomal dna used molecular
characterization.
results: according morphological identification, field collected adult
mosquitoes belonged 5 genera 14 species, i.e. aedes aegypti, ae.
albopictus, ae. pallidostriatus, aedes sp. 1, armigeres sp. 1, culex
bitaeniorhynchus, cx. fuscocephala, cx. gelidus, cx. pseudovishnui, cx.
quinquefasciatus, cx. tritaeniorhynchus, cx. whitmorei, mansonia uniformis and
mimomyia chamberlaini. molecular analyses 62 cox1 36 its2 sequences were
exclusively comparable morphological identifications species 
except ae. pallidostriatus aedes sp. 1. although species
identification armigeres sp. 1 specimens using morphological features 
possible study, dna barcodes specimens matched 100% the
publicly available ar. subalbatus sequences, giving species status.
analysis cox1 sequences (14 clades supported strong bootstrap value
in neighbor-joining tree interspecific distances > 3%) showed the
presence 14 different species. first available dna sequence the
genbank records morphologically identified ae. pallidostriatus. aedes sp. 1
could identified morphologically publicly available sequences. aedes
aegypti, ae. albopictus culex species reported current study
are vectors human diseases. vector species showed comparatively high
diversity.
conclusions: current study reflects significance integrated systematic
approach use cox1 genetic markers mosquito taxonomy. results of
dna barcoding comparable morphological identifications and, more
importantly, dna barcoding could accurately identify species instances
where traditional morphological identification failed due to
indistinguishable characters damaged specimens presence subspecies.
