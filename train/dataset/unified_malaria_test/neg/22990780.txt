the application dna microarray technologies malaria genomics been
widely used limited sample availability technical
variability. address issues, present microarray hybridization
protocol optimized use two new agilent technologies dna
microarrays plasmodium falciparum p. berghei. using recent
genome sequences available species, designed ∼14,000
oligonucleotide probes representing ∼5,600 transcripts species. included
in array design numerous probes allow identification of
parasite developmental stages, common plasmodium molecular markers used in
genetic manipulation, manufacturer probes control array consistency 
and quality. overall, agilent plasmodium spp. array designs hybridization
methodology provides sensitive, easy-to-use, high-quality, cost-effective
alternative currently available microarray platforms.
