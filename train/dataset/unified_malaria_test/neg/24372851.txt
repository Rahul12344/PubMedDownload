drug resistance plasmodium falciparum remains challenge malaria
eradication programmes around world. emergence artemisinin
resistance, efficacy partner drugs artemisinin combination
therapies (act) include quinoline-based drugs becoming critical. far
only resistance markers identified two
transmembrane transporters namely pfmdr1 (an atp-binding cassette transporter)
and pfcrt (a drug-metabolite transporter) experimentally verified.
another p. falciparum transporter, atp-binding cassette containing multidrug 
resistance-associated protein (pfmrp2) represents additional possible factor
of drug resistance p. falciparum. study, identified parasite
clone derived 3d7 p. falciparum strain shows increased
resistance chloroquine, mefloquine quinine trophozoite and
schizont stages. demonstrate resistance phenotype caused 4.1 
kb deletion 5' upstream region pfmrp2 gene leads an
alteration pfmrp2 transcription thus increased level pfmrp2
protein. results also suggest importance putative promoter elements 
in regulation gene expression p. falciparum intra-erythrocytic
developmental cycle potential genetic polymorphisms within these
regions underlie drug resistance.
