cell-cycle progression governed series essential regulatory proteins. 
two major regulators cell-division cycle protein 20 (cdc20) its
homologue, cdc20 homologue 1 (cdh1), activate anaphase-promoting
complex/cyclosome (apc/c) mitosis, facilitate degradation mitotic apc/c
substrates. malaria parasite, plasmodium, haploid organism which, during
its life-cycle undergoes two stages mitosis; one associated asexual
multiplication male gametogenesis. cell-cycle regulation and
dna replication plasmodium recently shown dependent activity 
of number protein kinases. however, function cell division cycle
proteins also involved process, cdc20 cdh1 is
totally unknown. examine role putative cdc20/cdh1 rodent 
malaria plasmodium berghei (pb) using reverse genetics. phylogenetic analysis
identified single putative plasmodium cdc20/cdh1 homologue (termed cdc20 for
simplicity) suggesting plasmodium apc/c one regulator. our
genetic approach delete endogenous cdc20 gene p. berghei, we
demonstrate pbcdc20 plays vital role male gametogenesis, not
essential mitosis asexual blood stage. furthermore, qrt-pcr analysis
in parasite lines deletions two kinase genes involved male sexual
development (map2 cdpk4), showed significant increase cdc20
transcription activated gametocytes. dna replication ultra structural
analyses cdc20 map2 mutants showed similar blockage nuclear division at
the nuclear spindle/kinetochore stage. cdc20 phosphorylated asexual and
sexual stages, level modification higher activated gametocytes 
and ookinetes. changes global protein phosphorylation patterns δcdc20
mutant parasites largely different observed δmap2 mutant. 
this suggests cdc20 map2 likely play independent vital
roles male gametogenesis.
