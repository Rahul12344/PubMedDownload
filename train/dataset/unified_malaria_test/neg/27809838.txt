background: malaria one serious widespread parasitic diseases 
affecting humans. spread resistance parasites the
mosquito vectors anti-malarial drugs insecticides, controlling spread 
of malaria becoming difficult. thus, identifying new drug targets urgently 
needed. helicases play key roles wide range cellular activities involving
dna rna transactions, making attractive anti-malarial drug targets.
methods: atp-dependent dna helicase gene (pfruvb3) plasmodium falciparum
strain k1, chloroquine pyrimethamine-resistant strain, inserted into
pqe-trisystem his-strep 2 vector, heterologously expressed affinity purified.
identity recombinant pfruvb3 confirmed western blotting coupled with
tandem mass spectrometry. helicase atpase activities characterized as
well co-factors required optimal function.
results: recombinant pfruvb3 molecular size 59 kda, showing dna
helicase atpase activities. helicase activity dependent divalent
cations (cu2+, mg2+, ni+2 zn+2) atp datp inhibited high nacl 
concentration (>100 mm). pfpuvb3 unable act blunt-ended duplex dna, 
manifests atpase activity presence either single- double-stranded
dna. pfruvb3.is inhibited doxorubicin, daunorubicin netropsin, known dna
helicase inhibitors.
conclusions: purified recombinant pfruvb3 contains dna helicase atpase
activities. differences properties ruvb malaria parasite
obtained study human host provide avenue leading the
development novel drugs targeting specifically malaria form ruvb family
of dna helicases.
