anaemia children living sub-saharan africa common, causes are
diverse. 545 children 5 years age rural southern rwanda, we
assessed role iron deficiency (id) tmprss6 736(v) (rs855791)
allele, known reduce iron status haemoglobin (hb) levels, anaemia and
hb concentrations. anaemia (hb <11 g/dl) present 34.4% children and
id (ferritin <12 ng/ml) 17.6%. tmprss6 736(v) allele uncommon (allele 
frequency, 0.096) associated id. multivariate analysis, id was
positively associated anaemia (adjusted odds ratio, 1.67) extent
comparable α(+) -thalassaemia, breastfeeding, inflammation low household
income, odds substantially higher plasmodium falciparum infection
(adjusted odds ratio, 10.3). findings verified multivariate
analysis hb concentrations. tmprss6 736(v) allele tended be
associated low hb levels. tmprss6 736(v) comparatively rare among rwandan
children may slightly contribute low hb concentrations. preventable
causes anaemia, notably id p. falciparum infection, largely outweigh its
impact need addressed improve haematological status children 
in study area.
