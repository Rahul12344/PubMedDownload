background: malaria parasites products activate specific immune
response stimulating cytokine production host's immune cells.
transcription nuclear factor kappa b (nf-κb) important regulator the
control many pro-inflammatory genes, interleukin-1 (il-1) tumor
necrosis factor (tnf). activation expression nf-κb p65 peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) malaria patients investigated and
correlated levels il-10 tnf study nature nf-κb p65 
its linkage inflammatory cytokines.
methods: sample group comprised 33 patients admitted malaria caused by
plasmodium vivax (n = 11), uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum (n = 11), and
complicated plasmodium falciparum (n = 11). peripheral blood collected at
admission day 7 pbmc isolation. healthy subjects used a
control group. expressions nf-κb p65 pbmcs malaria patients
and plasma levels il-10 tnf measured using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (elisa). immunofluorescence technique used to
determine nf-κb nuclear translocation.
results: admission, patients p. vivax uncomplicated p. falciparum had
significantly elevated phospho-nf-κb p65 levels pbmcs compared 
of healthy controls. however, patients complicated p. falciparum malaria had
decreased levels phospho-nf-κb p65. day 7 post-treatment, significantly
increased phospho-nf-κb p65 found pbmcs patients complicated
p. falciparum, compared healthy controls. plasma level il-10 was
elevated day 0 patients complicated p. falciparum malaria was
found negatively correlated phospho-nf-κb p65 level (rs = -0.630,
p = 0.038). however, correlation phospho-nf-κb p65
expression tnf level patients complicated p. falciparum malaria.
conclusions: first report demonstrating alterations nf-κb p65
activity pbmcs malaria patients. altered lower features nf-κb
p65 pbmcs patients complicated p. falciparum admission could be
due suppressive effect high il-10 associated complicated p.
falciparum malaria.
