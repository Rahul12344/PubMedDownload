conventional autophagy lysosome-dependent degradation process has
crucial homeostatic regulatory functions eukaryotic organisms. malaria 
parasites must dispose number self host cellular contents, we
investigated autophagy malaria parasites similar conventional
autophagy. genome wide analysis revealed partial autophagy repertoire in
plasmodium, homologs 15 33 yeast autophagy proteins could be
identified, including autophagy marker atg8. gain insights autophagy 
in malaria parasites, investigated plasmodium falciparum atg8 (pfatg8)
employing techniques conditions routinely used study autophagy.
atg8 similarly expressed showed punctate localization throughout the
parasite asexual sexual stages; exclusively found the
pellet fraction integral membrane protein, contrast the
yeast mammalian atg8 distributed among cytosolic membrane
fractions, suggests constitutive autophagy. starvation, best known 
autophagy inducer, decreased pfatg8 level almost 3-fold compared the
normally growing parasites. neither atg8-associated puncta atg8
expression level significantly altered treatment parasites with
routinely used autophagy inhibitors (cysteine (e64) aspartic (pepstatin)
protease inhibitors, kinase inhibitor 3-methyladenine, lysosomotropic
agent chloroquine), indicating atypical feature autophagy. furthermore,
prolonged inhibition major food vacuole protease activity e64 and
pepstatin cause accumulation atg8-associated puncta food
vacuole, suggesting autophagy primarily meant degradative
function malaria parasites. atg8 showed partial colocalization the
apicoplast; doxycycline treatment, disrupts apicoplast, affect atg8
localization, suggesting role, exclusive, apicoplast biogenesis.
collectively, results reveal several atypical features autophagy in
malaria parasites, may largely associated non-degradative
processes.
