malaria drug resistance contributes million annual deaths. judicious
deployment new antimalarials vaccines could benefit understanding 
of early molecular events promote evolution parasites. continuous 
vitro challenge plasmodium falciparum parasites novel dihydroorotate
dehydrogenase (dhodh) inhibitor reproducibly selected resistant parasites.
genome-wide analysis independently-derived resistant clones revealed a
two-step strategy evolutionary success. haploid blood-stage parasites
first survive antimalarial pressure fortuitous dna duplications that
always included dhodh gene. independently-selected parasites different
sized amplification units always flanked distant a/t tracks.
higher level amplification resistance attained using second, more
efficient accurate, mechanism head-to-tail expansion founder 
unit. second homology-based process could faithfully tune dna copy numbers
in either direction, always retaining unique dna amplification sequence 
the original a/t-mediated duplication parasite line. pseudo-polyploidy
at relevant genomic loci sets stage gaining additional mutations the
locus interest. overall, reveal population-based genomic strategy for
mutagenesis operates human stages p. falciparum efficiently yield
resistance-causing genetic changes correct locus successful parasite.
importantly, founding events arise precision; new
amplifications seen resistant haploid blood stage parasite. this
minimizes need meiotic genetic cleansing occur sexual
stage development parasite mosquitoes.
