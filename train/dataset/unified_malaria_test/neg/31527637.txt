the spread resistance insecticides disease-carrying mosquitoes poses a
threat effectiveness control programmes, rely largely on
insecticide-based interventions. monitoring mosquito populations essential,
but obtaining phenotypic measurements resistance laborious error-prone.
high-throughput genotyping offers prospect quick repeatable estimates 
of resistance, also allowing resistance markers tracked studied. 
to demonstrate potential highly-mulitplexed genotypic screening for
measuring resistance-association mutations tracking spread, we
developed panel 28 known putative resistance markers major malaria
vector anopheles gambiae, used screen mosquitoes wide swathe
of sub-saharan africa (burkina faso, ghana, democratic republic congo (drc)
and kenya). found resistance association four markers, including novel
mutation detoxification gene gste2 (gste2-119v). also identified a
duplication gste2 combining resistance-associated mutation its
wild-type counterpart, potentially alleviating costs resistance. finally, 
we describe distribution multiple origins kdr resistance, finding
unprecedented diversity drc. panel represents first step towards 
a quantitative genotypic model insecticide resistance used to
predict resistance status an. gambiae.
