background: toll-like receptors (tlrs) human immune mechanism play
important role detection invading pathogens. tlrs specifically
recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps) pathogens and
start effective response. single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) tlrs 
can mediate functions. present study evaluated importance rs4986790 
polymorphism tlr4 gene susceptibility towards malaria, clinical outcomes of
the disease responsible species malaria.
methods: blood samples 228 malaria patients 226 healthy volunteers were
selected study. sample collection completed sep 2013 sep
2015 different hospitals punjab, pakistan. patient's samples divided
into p. vivax group p. falciparum group basis causative species 
plasmodium. malaria samples also divided mild severe malaria group 
based clinical outcomes disease according criteria. healthy
individuals placed control group. whole blood used the
isolation dna. genomic dna isolated amplification targeted snp 
performed using allele-specific pcr.
results: results indicate protective role aa genotype the
susceptibility p. vivax infection, or: 0.5, 95%ci: 0.285-0.876, p=0.038.
conclusion: rs4986790 polymorphism tlr4 gene modulates susceptibility
towards p. vivax infection. aa genotype found protective the
development p. vivax infection local population pakistan.
