the present study analyzed relationship genetic diversity of
plasmodium falciparum parasitologic/entomologic indices mount cameroon
region using merozoite surface protein 1 genetic marker. blood samples
were collected asymptomatic children three altitude zones (high,
intermediate, low). parasitologic entomologic indices determined 
microscopy landing catch mosquito collection/circumsporozoite
protein-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. total 142 randomly 
selected p. falciparum-positive blood samples genotyped using nested
polymerase chain reaction-based technique. k-1 polymerase chain reaction products
were also sequenced. opposed high altitude, highest malaria prevalence 
(70.65%) entomologic inoculation rate (2.43 infective/bites/night) were
recorded low altitude site. seven (18.91%), 22 (36.66%), 19 (42.22%)
samples high, intermediate, low altitudes, respectively, contained
multiclonal infections. new k-1 polymorphism identified. study shows a
positive non-linear association low/intermediate altitude (high malaria
transmission) increase p. falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 block 
2 polymorphisms.
