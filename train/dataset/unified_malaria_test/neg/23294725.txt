background: resistance chloroquine antifolate drugs evolved
independently south america, suggesting genotype - phenotype studies
aimed understanding genetic basis resistance drugs
should conducted continent. research conducted better
understand population structure colombian plasmodium falciparum in
preparation studies.
results: set 384 snps genotyped blood spot dna samples 447 p.
falciparum infected subjects collected ten year period four provinces
of colombian pacific coast evaluate clonality, population structure and
linkage disequilibrium (ld). infections (81%) contained single predominant
clone. clustered 136 multilocus genotypes (mlgs), 32% mlgs
recovered multiple (2 - 28) independent subjects. observed extremely low 
genotypic richness (r = 0.42) long persistence mlgs time
(median = 537 days, range = 1 - 2,997 days). high probability (>5%)
of sampling parasites mlg different subjects within 28 days,
suggesting caution needed using genotyping methods assess treatment
success clinical drug trials. panmixia rejected four well
differentiated subpopulations (fst = 0.084 - 0.279) identified. these
occurred sympatrically varied frequency within four provinces. linkage
disequilibrium (ld) decayed rapidly (r2 = 0.17 markers <10 kb apart)
than observed previously south american samples.
conclusions: conclude colombian populations several advantages for
association studies, multiple clone infections uncommon ld decays
over scale one genes. however, extensive population structure
and low genotype richness need accounted designing and
analyzing association studies.
