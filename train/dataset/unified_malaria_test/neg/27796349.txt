placental malaria (pm) complication associated malaria infection during
pregnancy often leads abortion, premature delivery, intrauterine growth
restriction low birth weight. increased levels circulating free heme, a
by-product plasmodium-damaged erythrocytes, major contributor to
inflammation, tissue damage loss blood brain barrier integrity associated 
with fatal experimental cerebral malaria. however, role heme pm remains
unknown. proliferation apoptosis trophoblasts fusion the
mononucleated state syncytial state major importance a
successful pregnancy. present study, examined effects heme on
the viability fusion trophoblast-derived cell line (bewo). results
indicate heme induces apoptosis bewo cells activation the
stat3/caspase-3/parp signaling pathway. presence forskolin, which
triggers trophoblast fusion, heme inhibits bewo cell fusion activation of
stat3. understanding effects free plasma heme pregnant women either due
to malaria, sickle cell disease hemolytic diseases, enable
identification high-risk women may lead discovery new drug targets
against associated adverse pregnancy outcome.
