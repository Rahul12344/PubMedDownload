repeated incubation plasmodium falciparum culture 0.015% saponin solution
for total 35 min destroys uninfected cells, leaving the
ring-infected erythrocytes (ries). parasites concentrated method can
subsequently complete asexual cycle infect erythrocytes. is
possible resistance saponin mediated one numerous
parasite proteins present host erythrocyte membrane. found that
schizonts susceptible uninfected erythrocytes saponin, indicating
that protective protein parasite stage specific. studies cultured
parasites shown ring-infected erythrocyte surface antigen (resa)
strengthens host erythrocyte membrane protects destruction.
therefore, hypothesize resa could involved resistance saponin.
here, carried pcr test resa gene, using three different primers.
one showed p. falciparum isolates collected directly infected
humans cultured days, all, amplicon sizes
ranging 372 510 bp. however, amplicon size changed 873 bp 
vitro growth continued one weeks. genetic transformation
precedes acquisition ability confer saponin resistance ries.
