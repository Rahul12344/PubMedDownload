north borneo home 40 native populations. natives are
believed undergone local adaptation response environmental
challenges mosquito-abundant tropical rainforest. attempted to
trace footprints natural selection genomic data north borneo
(nb) native populations using panel ∼2.2 million genome-wide single
nucleotide polymorphisms (snps). result, ∼13 kb haplotype major
histocompatibility (mhc) class ii region encompassing candidate genes tsbp1 -
btnl2 - hla-dra identified undergoing natural selection. putative 
signature positive selection shared among five nb populations is
estimated arisen ∼5.5 thousand years (∼220 generations) ago, which
coincides period austronesian expansion. owing long history of
endemic malaria nb, putative signature positive selection postulated
to driven plasmodium parasite infection. findings study imply
that despite high levels genetic differentiation, nb populations might
have experienced similar local genetic adaptation resulting stresses 
shared environment.
