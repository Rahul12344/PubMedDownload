the rapid emergence drug-resistant malaria parasites course an
infection remains major challenge providing accurate treatment guidelines. 
this particularly important cases malaria treatment failure. using a
previously well-characterized case malaria treatment failure, show the
utility using next-generation sequencing early detection rise and
selection previously reported atovaquone-proguanil (malarone) drug
resistance-associated mutation.
