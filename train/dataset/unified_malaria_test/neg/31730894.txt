objectives: epidemiology studies indicated coke-oven workers long-term 
exposure polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) often some
neurobehavioral abnormalities especially impairment cognitive function, while
the underlying mechanisms fully understood. numerous studies have
indicated antioxidant anti-apoptosis roles heat shock protein 70
(hsp70). genetic polymorphisms hsp70 genes associated multiple
diseases including neurotoxicity. however, unclear whether hsp70
polymorphisms related neurotoxicity pah. we, therefore, investigate
the possible association hsp70 polymorphisms neurobehavioral
abnormalities.
methods: 188 coke-oven workers 137 control workers recruited this
study. emotional cognitive function assessed using who/nctb. hsp70
polymorphisms (hsp70-1 g190c, hsp70-2 g1267 hsp70-hom t2437c) checked 
by pcr-rflp.
results: results indicated hsp70-1 cc genotypes coke-oven workers
were associated poor neurobehavioral performance attention
/response speed visual perception/memory, hsp70-2 aa genotypes were
associated lower short-term auditory memory.
conclusions: hsp70-1 cc hsp70-2 aa genotypes coke-oven workers may
increase risk neurobehavioral damage, especially attention, learning 
memory.
