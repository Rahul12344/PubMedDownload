background: expression clonally variant virulence factor pfemp1
mediates sequestration plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes 
host vasculature contributes chronic infection. non-cytoadherent parasites
with chromosome 9 deletion lack clag9, gene linked cytoadhesion in
previous studies. present new clag9 data challenge view and
show surface non-cytoadherence phenotype linked expression 
a non-functional pfemp1.
methodology/principal findings: loss adhesion p. falciparum d10, parasite
line large chromosome 9 deletion, investigated. surface iodination
analysis non-cytoadherent d10 parasites cos-7 surface expression the
cd36-binding pfemp1 cidr1α domain performed showed parasites 
express unusual trypsin-resistant, non-functional pfemp1 erythrocyte
surface. however, cidr1α domain var gene expressed cos-7 cells
showed strong binding cd36. atomic force microscopy showed slightly modified
d10 knob morphology compared adherent parasites. trafficking pfemp1 and
kahrp remained functional d10. link non-cytoadherence phenotype a
chromosome 9 breakage healing event resulting loss 25 subtelomeric 
genes including clag9. contrast previous studies, knockout clag9
gene 3d7 interfere parasite adhesion cd36.
conclusions/significance: data show surface expression non-functional 
pfemp1 d10 strongly indicating genes clag9 deleted from
chromosome 9 involved virulence process possibly via
post-translational modifications.
