recent reports suggested self-propagating crispr-based gene drive
systems unlikely efficiently invade wild populations due to
drive-resistant alleles prevent cutting. develop mathematical models
based existing empirical data explicitly test assumption for
population alteration drives. models show although resistance prevents
spread fixation large populations, even least effective drive systems
reported date likely highly invasive. releasing small number of
organisms often cause invasion local population, followed invasion
of additional populations connected low rates gene flow. hence,
initiating contained field trials tentatively endorsed national
academies report gene drive could potentially result unintended spread to
additional populations. mathematical results suggest self-propagating
gene drive best suited applications malaria prevention seek to
affect wild populations target species.
