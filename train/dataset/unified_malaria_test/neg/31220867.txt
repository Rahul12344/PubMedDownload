malaria parasites characterized complex life cycle accompanied
by dynamic gene expression patterns. factors mechanisms regulate
gene expression parasites searched even advent 
of next generation sequencing technologies. functional genomics approaches have
substantially boosted area research yielded significant insights
into interplay epigenetic, transcriptional post-transcriptional
mechanisms. recently, considerable progress made identifying
sequence-specific transcription factors dna-encoded regulatory elements.
here, review insights obtained efforts including the
characterization core promoters, involvement sequence-specific
transcription factors life cycle progression mapping gene
regulatory elements. furthermore, discuss recent developments field 
functional genomics might contribute characterization 
this complex gene regulatory network.
