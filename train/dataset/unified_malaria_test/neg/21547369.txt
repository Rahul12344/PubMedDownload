recent research suggests altered redox control melanoma cell survival,
proliferation, invasiveness represents chemical vulnerability be
targeted pharmacological modulation cellular oxidative stress. the
endoperoxide artemisinin semisynthetic artemisinin-derivatives including
dihydroartemisinin (dha) constitute major class antimalarials kill
plasmodium parasites induction iron-dependent oxidative stress. here, 
we demonstrate dha may serve redox chemotherapeutic selectively
induces melanoma cell apoptosis without compromising viability primary human
melanocytes. cultured human metastatic melanoma cells (a375, g361, lox) were
sensitive dha-induced apoptosis upregulation cellular oxidative
stress, phosphatidylserine externalization, activational cleavage of
procaspase 3. expression array analysis revealed dha-induced upregulation of
oxidative genotoxic stress response genes (gadd45a, gadd153, cdkn1a, pmaip1, 
hmox1, egr1) a375 cells. dha exposure caused early upregulation the
bh3-only protein noxa, proapototic member bcl2 family encoded pmaip1,
and genetic antagonism (sirna targeting pmaip1) rescued melanoma cells from
apoptosis indicating causative role noxa-upregulation dha-induced
melanoma cell death. comet analysis revealed early dha-induction genotoxic
stress accompanied p53 activational phosphorylation (ser 15). primary human
epidermal melanocytes, viability compromised dha, oxidative
stress, comet tail moment, pmaip1 (noxa) expression remained unaltered. taken
together, data demonstrate metastatic melanoma cells display a
specific vulnerability dha-induced noxa-dependent apoptosis suggest
feasibility future anti-melanoma intervention using artemisinin-derived
clinical redox antimalarials.
