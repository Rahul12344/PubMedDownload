plasmodium falciparum, causative agent deadliest form malaria, a
member laverania subgenus, includes ape-infecting parasites.
p. falciparum thought originated gorillas, although infection is
now restricted humans. laverania parasites display remarkable
host-specificity, partially mediated interaction parasite
ligands host receptors. analyse evolution bsg (basigin) gypa
(glycophorin a) primates/hominins, well plasmodium-encoded
ligands, pfrh5 pfeba175. show that, primates, positive selection
targeted two sites bsg (f27 h102), involved pfrh5 binding. a
population genetics-phylogenetics approach detected strongest selection for
the gorilla lineage: one positively selected sites (k191) major
determinant pfrh5 binding affinity. analysis rh5 genes indicated episodic
selection p. falciparum branch; positively selected w447 site known
to stabilize interaction human basigin. conversely, detect no
selection receptor-binding region eba175 p. falciparum lineage. 
its host receptor, gypa, shows evidence positive selection hominid
lineages; selected codons include glycosylation sites modulate pfeba175
binding affinity. data herein provide evolutionary explanation for
species-specific binding pfrh5-bsg ligand-receptor pair support the
hypothesis positive selection genes drove host shift leading to
the emergence p. falciparum human pathogen.
