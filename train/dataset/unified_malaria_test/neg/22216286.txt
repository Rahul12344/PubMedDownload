background: cerebral malaria (cm) severe outcome plasmodium
falciparum infection major cause death children 2 4 years 
age. hospital based study ghana showed p. falciparum induces
eosinophilia found significantly higher serum level eosinophil cationic 
protein (ecp) cm patients uncomplicated malaria (um) severe
malaria anemia (sa) patients. single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) been
described ecp encoding-gene (rnase3) c.371g>c polymorphism
(rs2073342) results arginine threonine amino acid substitution p.r124t
in polypeptide abolishes cytotoxicity ecp. present study aimed
to investigate potential association polymorphisms rnase3 cm.
methodology/principal findings: rnase3 gene flanking regions were
sequenced 206 ghanaian children enrolled hospital based malaria study. an
association study carried assess significance five snps cm
(n=45) sa (n=56) cases, respectively. two severe case groups (cm sa) 
were compared non-severe control group comprising children suffering
from um (n=105). 371g allele significantly associated cm (p=0.00945,
or=2.29, 95% ci=1.22-4.32) sa. linkage disequilibrium analysis
demonstrated significant linkage three snps haplotype combination
371g/*16g/*94a strongly associated susceptibility cm (p=0.000913,
or=4.14, 95% ci=1.79-9.56), thus, defining risk haplotype. rnase3 371gg
genotype found frequency-dependent selection.
conclusions/significance: 371g allele rnase3 associated with
susceptibility cm forms part risk associated haplotype gga defined by
the markers: rs2073342 (g-allele), rs2233860 (g-allele) rs8019343 (a-allele) 
respectively. collectively, results suggest hitherto unrecognized role
for eosinophils cm pathogenesis.
