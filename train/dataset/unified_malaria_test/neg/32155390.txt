mosquitoes containing gene drive systems developed complementary
tools prevent transmission malaria mosquito-borne diseases. as
with new tool, decision makers stakeholders need balance
risks (safety) benefits (efficacy) considering rationale testing
and deploying gene drive-modified mosquito products. developers benefit from
standards judging whether investigational gene drive product meets
acceptability criteria advancing field trials. standards may be
formalized preferred product characteristics target product profiles,
which describe desired attributes product category particular
product, respectively. report summarizes discussions two scientific
workshops aimed identifying efficacy safety characteristics must be
minimally met investigational gene drive-modified mosquito product be
deemed viable move contained testing field release data that
will needed support application first field release.
