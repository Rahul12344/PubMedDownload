malaria parasites invade replicate within red blood cells (rbcs), extensively
modifying structure gaining access extracellular environment 
placing plasmodial surface anion channel (psac) rbc membrane.
expression members cytoadherence linked antigen gene 3 (clag3) family
is required psac activity, process regulated epigenetically. psac
is well-established route uptake large, hydrophilic antimalarial
compounds, parasites acquire resistance silencing clag3 gene
expression, thereby reducing drug uptake. found exposure sub-ic50
concentrations histone methyltransferase inhibitor chaetocin caused
substantial changes clag3 gene expression rbc permeability, and
reversed acquired resistance antimalarial compound blasticidin is
transported psacs. chaetocin treatment also altered progression of
parasites replicative cycle, presumably changing ability
to modify chromatin appropriately enable dna replication. results
indicate targeting histone modifiers could represent novel tool for
reversing epigenetically acquired drug resistance p. falciparum.
