gene drive technology offers promise high-impact, cost-effective, and
durable method control malaria transmission would make significant
contribution elimination. gene drive systems, based clustered
regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)/crispr associated
protein, potential spread beneficial traits interbreeding
populations malaria mosquitoes. however, characteristics this
technology raised concerns necessitate careful consideration the
product development pathway. multidisciplinary working group considered the
implications low-threshold gene drive systems development pathway
described world health organization guidance framework testing
genetically modified (gm) mosquitoes, focusing reduction malaria
transmission anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes africa case study. 
group developed recommendations safe ethical testing gene drive
mosquitoes, drawing prior experience vector control tools, gm
organisms, biocontrol agents. recommendations organized according
to testing plan seeks maximize safety incrementally increasing the
degree human environmental exposure investigational product. as
with biocontrol agents, emphasis placed safety evaluation end of
physically confined laboratory testing major decision point whether to
enter field testing. progression testing pathway based on
fulfillment safety efficacy criteria, subject regulatory and
ethical approvals, well social acceptance. working group identified
several resources considered important support responsible field
testing gene drive mosquitoes.
