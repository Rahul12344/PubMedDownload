prior senescence, erythrocytes may experience injury, compromises 
integrity thus triggers suicidal erythrocyte death eryptosis. this
mechanism characterised cell shrinkage, cell membrane blebbing, cell
membrane phospholipid scrambling phosphatidylserine exposure cell
surface identified macrophages, engulf degrade eryptotic
cells. term eryptosis also includes typical mechanisms, contribute to
the triggering process, oxidative stress, ca2+ entry an
increase cytosolic ca2+ activity ([ca ]i) activation p38 kinase,
which kinase expressed human erythrocytes activated after
hyperosmotic shock. enhanced eryptosis observed several clinical
conditions diabetes, renal insufficiency, haemolytic uremic syndrome,
sepsis, mycoplasma infection, malaria, iron deficiency, sickle cell anaemia,
beta-thalassemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-(g6pd) deficiency, hereditary
spherocytosis, paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, wilson's disease,
myelodysplastic syndrome, phosphate depletion. therefore, eryptosis may be
considered useful mechanism removal defective erythrocytes prevent 
haemolysis. moreover, clearance infected erythrocytes diseases 
malaria may counteract parasitemia. indeed known sickle-cell trait,
beta-thalassemia trait, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd)- deficiency 
iron deficiency confer protection severe course malaria.
importantly, strategies control plasmodium infection inducing eryptosis are
not expected generate resistance pathogen, proteins involved 
suicidal death host cell encoded pathogen thus cannot
be modified mutations genes. however, excessive eryptosis could
compromise microcirculation lead anemia.
