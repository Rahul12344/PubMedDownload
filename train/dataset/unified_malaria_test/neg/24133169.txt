the mechanism protective immunity plasmodium lost absence
of continued exposure parasite yet fully elucidated. has
been recently shown ifn-γ produced human murine acute malaria
primes immune response tlr agonists. study, investigated
whether ifn-γ-induced priming important maintain long-term protective
immunity plasmodium chabaudi malaria. day 60 postinfection, c57bl/6
mice still chronic parasitemia efficiently controlled homologous and
heterologous (aj strain) challenge. spleens chronic mice showed augmented 
numbers effector/effector memory (tem) cd4(+) cells, associated 
increased levels ifn-γ-induced priming (i.e., high expression ifn-inducible
genes tlr hyperresponsiveness). parasite elimination, ifn-γ-induced
priming longer detected protective immunity heterologous challenge 
was mostly lost >70% mortality. spontaneously cured mice high serum
levels parasite-specific igg, effector t/tem cell numbers, parasite-driven
cd4(+) cell proliferation, ifn-γ production similar noninfected
controls. remarkably, priming cured mice low doses ifn-γ rescued
tlr hyperresponsiveness capacity control heterologous challenge,
increasing tem cell population restoring cd4(+) cell responses to
parasites. contribution tlr signaling cd4(+) cell responses in
chronic mice supported data obtained mice lacking myd88 adaptor.
these results indicate ifn-γ-induced priming required maintain
protective immunity p. chabaudi aid establishing molecular
basis strain-transcending immunity human malaria.
