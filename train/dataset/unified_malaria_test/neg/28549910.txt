a key tool control, elimination, eradication plasmodium vivax is
the development effective vaccine. thrombospondin-related adhesion
protein (trap) one major sporozoite antigens plays important
role invasion mosquito salivary glands hepatocytes sporozoites. 
the main goal study evaluate naturally acquired antibodies 
the p. vivax trap (pvtrap) patients malaria-endemic areas iran
(n=116), afghanistan (n=50), pakistan (n=50). pvtrap gene expressed
in escherichia coli rosetta (de3)-pet23a used antigen enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (elisa). profile immunoglobulin g (igg) isotype and
the avidity igg, igg1, igg3 pvtrap, well association 
anti-pvtrap isotype responses host age evaluated. 42.24% of
iranian, 38% afghani, 44% pakistani patients infected p. vivax had
positive anti-pvtrap igg, prevalence responders three countries
did differ significantly (p>0.05). moreover, prevalence igg1 igg3 
antibody responses pvtrap showed significant correlation age (p>0.05).
individuals exposed vivax malaria unstable malaria transmission areas
are able produce antibodies trap antigen ages response p. 
vivax infections. finally, presence mature igg1 igg3 antibodies with
high intermediate avidity pvtrap antigen (>60%) provide more
information understand interactions host p. vivax
parasite. summary, present study provides data support rational
development effective pre-erythrocytic stage vaccine based pvtrap
antigen.
