the indoleamine compound melatonin extensively studied regulation
of circadian rhythm nearly vertebrates. effects melatonin 
also studied protozoan parasites, especially synchronization of
the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum via complex downstream
signalling pathway. melatonin activates protein kinase (pfpka) requires the
activation protein kinase 7 (pfpk7), plc-ip3, subset genes the
ubiquitin-proteasome system. parasites, trypanosoma cruzi and
toxoplasma gondii, melatonin increases inflammatory components, thus amplifying
the protective response host's immune system affecting parasite load. 
the development melatonin-related indole compounds exhibiting antiparasitic
properties clearly suggests new effective approach alternative
treatment. therefore, critical understand melatonin confers
stimulatory functions host-parasite biology.
