background: despite extensive endeavours, developing effective malaria
vaccine remains great challenge. apical membrane antigen 1 (ama-1) located
on merozoite surface parasites belonging genus plasmodium is
involved red blood cell invasion.
methods: influenza virus-like particle (vlp) vaccines containing codon-optimized 
or native (non-codon optimized) ama-1 plasmodium berghei generated.
vlp-induced protective immunity evaluated mouse model.
results: mice immunized vlp vaccine containing codon-optimized ama-1
elicited higher levels p. berghei-specific igg igg2a antibody responses
compared vlps containing non-codon optimized ama-1 challenge 
infection. codon-optimized ama-1 vlp vaccination induced higher levels cd4+ 
cells, cd8+ cells, b cells, germinal centre cell responses compared to
non-codon optimized ama-1 vlps. importantly, codon-optimized ama-1 vlp
vaccination showed lower body weight loss, longer survival significant
decrease parasitaemia compared non-codon optimized vlp vaccination.
conclusion: overall, vlp vaccine expressing codon-optimized ama-1 induced better 
protective efficacy vlps expressing non-codon optimized ama-1. current
findings highlight importance codon-optimization vaccine use its
potential involvement future malaria vaccine design strategies.
