human sapovirus shown one important etiologies in
pediatric patients acute diarrhea. however, limited data available 
about causative roles epidemiology sapovirus community settings. 
nested matched case-control study within birth cohort study acute diarrhea
in peri-urban community peru 2007 2010 conducted investigate 
the attributable fraction (af) genetic diversity sapovirus. by
quantitative reverse transcription-real-time pcr (qpcr) sapovirus detected in
12.4% (37/299) diarrheal 5.7% (17/300) nondiarrheal stools (p = 0.004).
the sapovirus af (7.1%) higher second year (13.2%) first
year (1.4%) life children. ten known genotypes one novel cluster (n =
5) within four genogroups (gi, gii, giv, gv) identified phylogenetic 
analysis partial vp1 gene. sequence analysis full vp1 gene
revealed possible novel genotype, tentatively named gii.8. notably, symptomatic
reinfections different genotypes within (n = 3) different (n =
5) genogroups observed eight children. sapovirus exhibited high
attributable burden acute gastroenteritis, especially second year of
life, children peruvian community. large-scale studies needed
to understand better global burden, genetic diversity, repeated
infections sapovirus.
