transmission malaria parasites humans mosquito vectors requires that
some asexual parasites differentiate sexual forms termed gametocytes. the
balance proliferation host conversion transmission
forms altered conditions environment. ability to
accurately measure rate sexual conversion different conditions is
essential research addressing mechanisms underlying sexual conversion,
and assess impact environmental factors. describe new
plasmodium falciparum transgenic lines genome-integrated constructs which
a fluorescent reporter expressed control promoter the
gexp02 gene. using parasite lines, developed sexual conversion assay
that shortens considerably time needed accurate determination of
sexual conversion rates, dispenses need add chemicals inhibit
parasite replication. furthermore, demonstrate gexp02 expressed
specifically sexual parasites, expression starting early sexual
ring stage, makes candidate marker circulating sexual rings in
epidemiological studies.
