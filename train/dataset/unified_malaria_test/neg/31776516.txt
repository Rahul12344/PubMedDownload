the emergence spread drug-resistant plasmodium falciparum impedes global
efforts control eliminate malaria. decades, treatment malaria has
relied chloroquine (cq), safe affordable 4-aminoquinoline was
highly effective intra-erythrocytic asexual blood-stage parasites, 
resistance arose southeast asia south america spread worldwide1.
clinical resistance chemically related current first-line combination drug
piperaquine (ppq) emerged regionally, reducing efficacy2. resistance 
to cq ppq associated distinct sets point mutations p.
falciparum cq-resistance transporter pfcrt, 49-kda member the
drug/metabolite transporter superfamily traverses membrane acidic
digestive vacuole parasite3-9. present structure, 3.2 å
resolution, pfcrt isoform cq-resistant, ppq-sensitive south american
7g8 parasites, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy antigen-binding
fragment technology. mutations contribute cq ppq resistance localize 
primarily moderately conserved sites distinct helices line central
negatively charged cavity, indicating cavity principal site of
interaction positively charged cq ppq. binding transport studies
reveal 7g8 isoform binds drugs comparable affinities, that
these drugs mutually competitive. 7g8 isoform transports cq a
membrane potential- ph-dependent manner, consistent active efflux
mechanism drives cq resistance5, transport ppq. functional
studies newly emerging pfcrt f145i c350r mutations, associated with
decreased ppq susceptibility asia south america, respectively6,9, reveal
their ability mediate ppq transport 7g8 variant proteins confer
resistance gene-edited parasites. structural, functional silico
analyses suggest distinct mechanistic features mediate resistance cq 
and ppq pfcrt variants. data provide atomic-level insights the
molecular mechanism key mediator antimalarial treatment failures.
