malaria parasites complex life cycle, undergo
significant biological changes adapt different hosts changing
environments. plasmodium falciparum, species responsible deadliest
form human malaria, maintains complex life cycle relatively small 
number genes. alternative splicing (as) important post-transcriptional
mechanisms enables eukaryotic organisms expand protein repertoire
out relatively small number genes. sr proteins major regulators as
in higher eukaryotes. nevertheless, regulation splicing well 
machinery plasmodium spp. still elusive. here, show pfsr1, a
putative p. falciparum sr protein, mediate rna splicing vitro. in
addition, show pfsr1 functions factor mini-gene vivo
systems similar mammalian sr protein srsf1. expression pfsr1-myc p. 
falciparum shows distinct patterns cellular localization intra
erythrocytic development. furthermore, determine predicted rs domain 
of pfsr1 essential localization nucleus. finally, we
demonstrate proper regulation pfsr1 required parasite
proliferation human rbcs over-expression pfsr1 influences activity
of p. falciparum genes vivo.
