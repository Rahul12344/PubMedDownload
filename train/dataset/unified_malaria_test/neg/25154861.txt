gametocytes sole plasmodium parasite stages infect mosquitoes;
therefore development functional gametes required malaria transmission.
flagellum assembly plasmodium male gamete differs 
eukaryotes intracytoplasmic retains key conserved feature:
axonemes assemble basal bodies. centriole/basal body protein sas-6
normally regulates assembly duplication organelles depletion
causes severe flagellar/ciliary abnormalities diverse array eukaryotes.
since basal body flagellum assembly intimately coupled male gamete
development plasmodium, hypothesized sas-6 disruption may cause
gametogenesis defects perturb transmission. show plasmodium berghei
sas6 knockouts display severely abnormal male gametogenesis presenting reduced
basal body numbers, axonemal assembly defects abnormal nuclear allocation.
the defects gametogenesis reduce fertilization render pbsas6 knockouts
less infectious mosquitoes. additionally, show lack pbsas6 blocks
transmission mosquito vertebrate host, revealing additional yet
undefined role ookinete sporulating oocysts transition. findings
underscore vulnerability basal body/sas-6 malaria transmission
blocking interventions.
