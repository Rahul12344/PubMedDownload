sri lanka known high diversity phlebotomine sand flies prevalence
of cutaneous visceral leishmaniasis; disease vectored sand flies. the
taxonomy phlebotomine sand flies complicated often diversity is
over/underrated. current study aims use cytochrome c oxidase gene
subunit 1 (coi) sequence formulate barcode sand fly species sri 
lanka. total 70 samples comprising seven species morphologically identified 
and collected dry zone districts hambantota, anuradhapura, vavuniya,
trincomalee jaffna processed. neighbour-joining (nj) tree created using 
the sequences revealed species identity compatible current
morphology based identification. analysis delineated morphologically 
identified se. bailyi, se babu babu se babu insularis genetically
distinct groups.
