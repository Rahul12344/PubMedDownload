toll like receptors (tlrs) play pivotal role recognizing invading
malaria parasite plasmodium, thus genetic makeup exposed population be
of utmost importance predisposition malaria. study 264 malaria
patients seven different eco epidemiological regions india genotyped
for tlr2 tlr4 polymorphisms using dna sequencing methods. variation was
observed residue positions 677 753 tlr2 whereas residue positions 299
and 399 tlr4 highly polymorphic. gc haplotype (asp299gly/thr399thr)
was observed highest frequency populations east singhbhum,
vizianagaram north goa absent kolkata, dakshin kannada nicobar
district. polymorphisms hardy weinberg equilibrium. populations of
kolkata, nicobar district, sundergarh dakshin kannada observed be
closely related. tlr2 polymorphism absent indian population an
overall heterogeneous pattern tlr4 polymorphism attributed genetic
drift. however inferred gc haplotype process of
natural selection indian population one factors contributing to
its selection could predominance plasmodium falciparum regions.
