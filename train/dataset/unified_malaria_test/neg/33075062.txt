background: mass drug administration (mda) rapidly reduce burden of
plasmodium falciparum (pf). however, concerns remain contribution to
select antimalarial drug resistance.
methods: used sanger sequencing real-time pcr determine proportion 
of molecular markers associated antimalarial resistance (k13, pfpm2, pfmdr1 
and pfcrt) pf isolates collected (n = 99) (n = 112) the
implementation two monthly mda rounds dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
(dhap) two consecutive years magude district southern mozambique.
results: none k13 polymorphisms associated artemisinin resistance
were observed pf isolates analyzed. proportion pf isolates with
multiple copies pfpm2, amplification associated piperaquine
resistance, similar pre- (4.9%) post-mda groups (3.4%; p = 1.000). 
statistically significant differences observed pre- post-mda
groups proportion pf isolates neither mutations pfcrt and
pfmdr1 genes, carriage pfmdr1 multiple copies (p>0.05).
conclusions: study show evidence increased frequency of
molecular makers antimalarial resistance mda dhap southern
mozambique markers antimalarial resistance absent low the
beginning intervention.
