background: immune evasion drug resistance malaria linked to
chromosomal recombination gene copy number variation (cnv). events 
ideally studied using comparative genomic analyses; however malaria these
analyses common thorough infectious diseases, partly
due difficulty sequencing assembling complete genome drafts.
recently, whole genome optical mapping gained wide use support genomic 
sequence assembly comparison. here, rapid technique producing whole
genome optical maps plasmodium falciparum described results of
mapping four genomes presented.
methods: four laboratory strains p. falciparum analysed using argus™ 
optical mapping system produce ordered restriction fragment maps 14
chromosomes genome. plasmodium falciparum dna isolated directly 
blood culture, visualized using argus™ system assembled manner
analogous next generation sequence assembly maps (assemblyviewer™, opgen 
inc.®). full coverage maps generated p. falciparum strains 3d7, fvo, d6 
and c235. reference p. falciparum silico map created digestion of
the genomic sequence p. falciparum restriction enzyme aflii, for
comparisons genomic optical maps. maps compared using mapsolver™
software.
results: genomic variation observed among mapped strains, well as
between map reference strain map derived putative
sequence strain. duplications, deletions, insertions, inversions and
misassemblies sizes ranging 3,500 base pairs 78,000 base pairs were
observed. many genomic events occurred areas known repetitive sequence or
high copy number genes, including var gene clusters rifin complexes.
conclusions: technique optical mapping multiple malaria genomes
allows whole genome comparison multiple strains assist in
identifying genetic variation sequence contig assembly. new protocols and
technology allowed us produce high quality contigs spanning four p. falciparum
genomes six weeks less $1,000.00 per genome. relatively low cost
and quick turnaround makes technique valuable compared genomic
sequencing technologies studying genetic variation malaria.
