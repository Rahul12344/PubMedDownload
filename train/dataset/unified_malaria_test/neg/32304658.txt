plants regulate synthesis specialized compounds actions of
individual transcription factors (tfs) sets tfs. one compound,
artemisinin artemisia annua, widely used pharmacological product 
the first-line treatment malaria. however, emergence resistance to
artemisinin plasmodium species, well low production rates, have
required innovative treatments exploiting synergistic effects of
flavonoids artemisinin. overview current knowledge flavonoid and
artemisinin transcriptional regulation a. annua, review dual action of
tfs structural genes regulate pathways simultaneously.
understanding concerted action tfs associated structural
genes guide development strategies improve flavonoid and
artemisinin production.
