glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pd) deficiency x-linked erythrocyte
enzyme disorder relevance malaria treatment policy. treatment the
antimalarial primaquine result hemolytic anemia g6pd-deficient
patients. increased interest primaquine use, important identify 
g6pd variants ethiopia inform malaria treatment policy. present
study, mutations g6pd gene identified sample patients with
malaria jimma town southwest ethiopia. plasmodium species infection were
confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) gel electrophoresis. pcr 
sanger sequencing performed observe portion g6pd gene 
common g6pd mutations (a376g, g202a, c563t) found. molecular analysis
revealed samples single plasmodium vivax infections
(83.7%). g6pd genotyping, a376g detected 23.26% individuals,
whereas g202a c563t absent. three uncommon mutations were
identified: rs782669677 (535g→a), rs370658483, (485 + 37 g→t), new mutation
at chrx:154535443(c→t). bioinformatic analysis mutations' potential
functional impact suggests minimal effect protein function. discovery of
both common uncommon g6pd mutations contributes discussion g6pd
deficiency appropriate primaquine treatment ethiopia.
