background: malaria still global health problem vector control the
cornerstone disease control strategies using indoor residual insecticide
spraying (irs) insecticide-treated nets. situation becoming acute with
widespread resistance limited arsenal available insecticide classes.
therefore, new innovative tools reduce plasmodium transmission need
and situation raised considerable interest using sterile insect technique
(sit) human pest insects, particularly anopheles malaria vectors. when
considering mosquito release programme, one first issues addressed
is eliminate/separate hematophagous vector females. paper, 
report development evaluation anopheles arabiensis
temperature-sensitive lethal (tsl) strain towards potential use the
development genetic sexing strain (gss). anopheles arabiensis male
mosquitoes originated north cameroon treated 0.05% ethyl
methanesulfonate (ems). mutagen added 10% sucrose solution and
mosquitoes fed ad-libitum 24h 48h cotton wool soaked with
sucrose-mutagen solution placed top cup. treated males then
allowed mate wild virgin females progenies screened for
heat sensitivity f3 f8, isolation establishment tsl
strain characterized assessing productivity (fecundity
and fertility), larval development, adult longevity well nature and
inheritance pattern tsl.
results: observations showed number eggs laid hatch rate
were similar females mated mutagenized males the
control suggesting mutagenesis affect an. arabiensis male fecundity
and fertility. f3, fourteen isofemale families 88 tested, showed 
mortalities ranged 50 80 %, selected lines potentially
containing tsl mutation. f4 f8, tsl strain isolated and
established screening l1 larvae 41°c 3 hours. strain showed
similar life history traits compared wild type strain terms of
fertility, larval development time adult's emergence. crossing experiments to
further assess nature inheritance pattern tsl phenotype showed
that due recessive allele located autosome.
conclusion: successful establishment an. arabiensis tsl strain a
valuable tool towards development gss sit applications

wild-type allele chromosome manner males wild-type
(temperature resistant) females mutant (temperature sensitive).
