background: complex life cycle malaria parasites requires
well-orchestrated stage specific gene expression. vertebrate host the
parasites grow multiply schizogony two different environments: within
erythrocytes within hepatocytes. whereas erythrocytic parasites are
well-studied respect, relatively little known the
exo-erythrocytic stages.
methods: attempt fill gap, genome wide rna-seq analyses various 
exo-erythrocytic stages plasmodium berghei including sporozoites, samples from
a time-course liver stage development detached cells performed. these
latter contain infectious merozoites represent final step in
exo-erythrocytic development.
results: analysis represents complete transcriptome entire life
cycle p. berghei parasites temporal detailed analysis liver stage 
allowing comparison gene expression across progression life cycle. 
these rna-seq data different developmental stages used cluster genes
with similar expression profiles, order infer functions. comparison
with published data parasite stages confirmed stage-specific gene
expression revealed numerous genes expressed differentially blood
and exo-erythrocytic stages. one exo-erythrocytic stage-specific
genes pbanka_1003900, previously annotated "gametocyte
specific protein". promoter gene drove high gfp expression in
exo-erythrocytic stages, confirming expression profile seen rna-seq.
conclusions: comparative analysis genome wide mrna expression profiles
of erythrocytic different exo-erythrocytic stages could used improve
the understanding gene regulation plasmodium parasites used to
model exo-erythrocytic stage metabolic networks toward identification of
differences metabolic processes schizogony erythrocytes and
hepatocytes.
