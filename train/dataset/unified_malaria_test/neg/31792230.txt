hiv-exposed uninfected (heu) infants disproportionately higher risk of
morbidity mortality, compared hiv-unexposed uninfected (huu) infants.
here, used transcriptional profiling peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
determine immunological signatures utero hiv exposure. identified 262
differentially expressed genes (degs) heu compared huu infants. weighted
gene co-expression network analysis (wgcna) identified six modules had
significant associations clinical traits. functional enrichment analysis 
both degs six significantly associated modules revealed enrichment 
g-protein coupled receptors immune system, specifically affecting
neutrophil function antibacterial responses. additionally, malaria
pathogenicity genes (thrombospondin 1-(thbs 1), interleukin 6 (il6), arginine
decarboxylase 2 (adc2)) down-regulated. interest, down-regulated
immunity genes positively correlated expression epigenetic factors
of histone family high-mobility group protein b2 (hmgb2), suggesting
their role dysregulation heu transcriptional landscape. overall, we
show genes primarily associated neutrophil mediated immunity were
repressed heu infants. results suggest could a
contributing factor increased susceptibility bacterial infections
associated higher morbidity mortality commonly reported heu infants.
