despite decades eradication efforts, malaria remains global burden. recent
renewed interest regional elimination global eradication been
accompanied increased genomic information plasmodium parasite species
responsible malaria, including characteristics geographical populations as
well variations associated reduced susceptibility anti-malarial drugs.
one common genetic variation, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps), offers
attractive targets parasite genotyping. markers useful for
tracking drug resistance markers also tracking parasite populations using
markers drug selective pressures. snp genotyping methods offer
the ability track drug resistance well fingerprint individual
parasites population surveillance, particularly response malaria
control efforts regions nearing elimination status. informative snps
have identified agnostic specific genotyping technologies,
high-resolution melting (hrm) analysis particularly suited field-based
studies. compared standard fluorescent-probe based methods require
individual snps single labeled probe offer best 10% sensitivity to
detect snps samples contain multiple genomes (polygenomic), hrm offers
2-5% sensitivity. modifications hrm, blocked probes asymmetric
primer concentrations well optimization amplification annealing
temperatures bias pcr towards amplification minor allele, further
increase sensitivity hrm. sensitivity improvement depends the
specific assay, increased detection sensitivities less 1% 
minor allele. regions approaching malaria eradication, early detection of
emerging imported drug resistance essential prompt response. similarly,
the ability detect polygenomic infections differentiate imported parasite 
types cryptic local reservoirs inform control programs. manuscript 
describes modifications high resolution melting technology further
increase sensitivity identify polygenomic infections patient samples.
