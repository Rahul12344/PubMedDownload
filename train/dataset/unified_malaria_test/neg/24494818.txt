plasmodium falciparum heat shock proteins proteases known their
indispensable roles parasite virulence survival host cell. they
neutralize various host-derived stress responses deleterious for
parasite growth invasion. report identification functional
characterization first degp apicomplexan (p. falciparum). to
determine molecular identity functions parasite-encoded degp, we
complemented escherichia coli degp null mutant putative pfdegp gene,
and results showed pfdegp complements growth defect the
temperature sensitive degp-deficient mutant imparts resistance to
non-permissive temperatures oxidative stress. molecular interaction studies
showed pfdegp exists complex parasite-encoded heat shock protein
70, iron superoxide dismutase enolase. degp expression significantly
induced parasite culture upon heat shock/oxidative stress. data suggest
that pfdegp protein may play role growth development p.
falciparum ability confer protection thermal/oxidative
stress. antibody degp showed anti-plasmodial activity blood-stage
parasites vitro, suggesting pfdegp associated complex may a
potential focus new anti-malarial therapies.structured digital abstract:
