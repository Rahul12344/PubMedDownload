plasmodium sporozoites develop within oocysts mosquito midgut wall and
then migrate salivary glands. transmission, embark complex
journey mammalian liver, infect hepatocytes. proteins the
sporozoite surface likely mediate multiple steps journey, yet 
sporozoite surface proteins described. here, characterize novel,
conserved sporozoite surface protein (ssp3) rodent malaria parasite
plasmodium yoelii. ssp3 putative type transmembrane protein unique to
plasmodium. using epitope tagging ssp3-specific antibodies conjunction 
with immunofluorescence microscopy, showed ssp3 expressed mosquito 
midgut oocyst sporozoites, exhibiting intracellular localization. in
sporozoites derived mosquito salivary glands, however, ssp3 localized
predominantly sporozoite surface determined immunoelectron
microscopy. however, ectodomain ssp3 appeared inaccessible to
antibodies nonpermeabilized salivary gland sporozoites. antibody-induced
shedding major surface protein circumsporozoite protein (csp) exposed 
ssp3 ectodomain antibodies sporozoites. targeted deletion ssp3
adversely affected vitro sporozoite gliding motility, which, surprisingly,
impacted neither cell traversal capacity, host cell invasion vitro, 
infectivity vivo. together, data reveal previously unappreciated
complexity plasmodium sporozoite surface proteome roles surface
proteins distinct biological activities sporozoites.
