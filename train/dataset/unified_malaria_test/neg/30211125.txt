sand fly salivary proteins produce specific antibody response humans
and animal reservoirs shown promising biomarkers sand fly
exposure. furthermore, immunity sand fly salivary proteins shown to
protect rodents non-human primates leishmania infection. are
missing critical information regarding divergence amongst sand fly salivary
proteins different sand fly vectors, knowledge support the
search broad specific salivary biomarkers vector exposure 
vaccines components leishmaniasis. here, compare molecular
evolution salivary protein families new world old world sand flies 
from 14 different sand fly vectors. found protein families unique 
ow sand flies conserved unique nw sand flies regarding
both sequence polymorphisms copy number variation. addition, protein
families unique ow sand flies display many conserved cysteine
residues one unique nw group (28.5% ow vs. 62.5% nw).
moreover, expression specific protein families restricted the
salivary glands unique sand fly taxon. instance, parsp15 family is
unique larroussius subgenus whereas phospholipase a2 expressed 
member larroussius adlerius subgenera. sp2.5-like family only
expressed members phlebotomus paraphlebotomus subgenera. the
sequences shared ow nw sand flies diverged similar rates
(38.7 45.3% amino acid divergence, respectively), yet differences gene
copy number evident across protein families sand fly species. overall,
this comparative analysis sheds light different modes sand fly salivary
protein family divergence. also, informs protein families unique and
conserved within taxon choice taxon-specific biomarkers vector
exposure, well families conserved across taxa used as
pan-specific vaccines leishmaniasis.
