during asexual replication within anopheles mosquito vertebrate
host, plasmodium parasites depend generation massive amount new
plasma membrane produce thousands daughter parasites. parasite
plasma membrane (ppm) formed mostly studied electron microscopy,
which allow insight dynamics process. generated a
plasmodium berghei reporter parasite line gfp-tagging non-essential
ppm-localized protein, followed plasma membrane development living
parasites entire plasmodium life cycle. generating
double-fluorescent parasites ppm visualized combination with
the parasite endoplasmic reticulum, show membrane contact sites are
formed membrane systems oocyst liver stage development
that might used deliver lipids dramatically expanding ppm. in
conclusion, established powerful tool follow ppm development in
living parasites, promises greatly expand knowledge membrane
biology plasmodium parasite.
