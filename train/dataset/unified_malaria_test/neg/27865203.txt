cerebral malaria (cm) neurological complication arising due plasmodium
falciparum plasmodium vivax infection. minocycline, semi-synthetic
tetracycline, earlier reported neuroprotective role several
neurodegenerative diseases. study, investigated effect of
minocycline treatment survivability mice experimental cerebral
malaria (ecm). currently accepted mouse model, c57bl/6 mice infected with
plasmodium berghei anka, used study. infected mice treated 
an intra-peritoneal dose minocycline hydrochloride, 45mg/kg daily ten days
that led parasite clearance blood, brain, liver spleen 7th day
post-infection; mice survived experiment ended (90days) without
parasite recrudescence. evans blue extravasation assay showed blood-brain
barrier integrity maintained minocycline. tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
protein level caspase activity, related cm pathogenesis, was
significantly reduced minocycline-treated group. fluoro-jade® c and
hematoxylin-eosin staining brains minocycline group revealed decrease
in degenerating neurons absence hemorrhages respectively. minocycline
treatment led decrease gene expressions inflammatory mediators like
interferon-gamma, cxcl10, ccl5, ccl2; receptors cxcr3 ccr2; hence
decrease t-cell-mediated cerebral inflammation. also proved this
reduction gene expressions irrespective anti-parasitic property of
minocycline. distinct ability minocycline modulate gene expressions 
cxcl10 cxcr3 makes effective doxycycline, tetracycline used as
chemoprophylaxis. study shows minocycline highly effective in
conferring neuroprotection ecm.
