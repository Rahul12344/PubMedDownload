plasmodium vivax complex protozoan parasite 6,500 genes and
stage-specific differential expression. much unique biology this
pathogen remains unknown, including modifies restructures host
reticulocyte. using recently published p. vivax reference genome, report the
proteome two biological replicates infected saimiri boliviensis host
reticulocytes undergoing transition late trophozoite early schizont
stages. using five database search engines, identified total 2000 p.
vivax 3487 s. boliviensis proteins, making comprehensive p.
vivax proteome date. plasmodb go-term enrichment analysis proteins
identified least twice search engine highlighted core metabolic processes
and molecular functions glycolysis, translation protein folding, cell
components ribosomes, proteasomes golgi apparatus, number
of vesicle trafficking related clusters. database annotation,
visualization integrated discovery (david) v6.8 enriched functional
annotation clusters s. boliviensis proteins highlighted vesicle and
trafficking-related clusters, elements cytoskeleton, oxidative processes
and response oxidative stress, macromolecular complexes proteasome
and ribosome, metabolism, translation, cell death. host parasite proteins
potentially involved cell adhesion also identified. 25% p.
vivax proteins functional annotation; group includes 45 vir members 
of large pir family. number host pathogen proteins contained highly 
oxidized nitrated residues, extending prior trophozoite-enriched stage
observations s. boliviensis infections, supporting possibility of
oxidative stress relation disease. proteome significantly expands 
the size complexity known p. vivax saimiri host irbc proteomes,
and provides in-depth data valuable ongoing research this
parasite's biology pathogenesis.
