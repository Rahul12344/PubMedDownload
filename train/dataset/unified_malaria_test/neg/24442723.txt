trypanosoma plasmodium species unicellular, eukaryotic pathogens that
have evolved capacity survive proliferate within human host, causing
sleeping sickness malaria, respectively. different survival
strategies. african trypanosomes divide blood extracellular spaces,
whereas plasmodium species invade proliferate within host cells. interaction 
with host macromolecules central establishment maintenance an
infection parasites. proteins mediate interactions under
selection pressure bind host ligands without compromising immune avoidance
strategies. parasites, expansion genes encoding small number 
protein folds established large protein families. permitted both
diversification form novel ligand binding sites variation sequence that
contributes avoidance immune recognition. review consider two
such parasite surface protein families, one species. case,
known structures demonstrate extensive sequence variation around conserved 
molecular architecture provides adaptable protein scaffold parasites 
can mobilise mediate interactions hosts.
