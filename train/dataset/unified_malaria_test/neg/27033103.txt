dna malaria parasites, plasmodium falciparum, subjected extraordinary
high levels genotoxic insults complex life cycle within the
mosquito human host. accordingly, components dna repair
machinery conserved parasite genome. here, investigated the
genome-wide responses p. falciparum dna damaging agents provided
transcriptional evidence existence double strand break excision
repair system. also showed acetylation h3k9, h4k8, h3k56 play a
role direct indirect response dna damage induced alkylating
agent, methyl methanesulphonate (mms). artemisinin, first line antimalarial
chemotherapeutics elicits similar response compared mms suggests its
activity dna damaging agent. moreover, contrast wild-type p.
falciparum, two strains (dd2 w2) previously shown exhibit mutator
phenotype, fail induce dna repair upon mms-induced dna damage. genome
sequencing two mutator strains identified point mutations 18 dna repair
genes may contribute phenomenon.
