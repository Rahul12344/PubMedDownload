malaria control hindered evolution spread resistance to
antimalarials, necessitating multiple changes drug policies time. a
comprehensive antimalarial drug resistance surveillance program vital for
detecting potential emergence resistance antimalarials, including
current artemisinin-based combination therapies. antimalarial drug resistance 
surveillance study involving 203 plasmodium falciparum malaria-positive children 
was conducted western kenya 2010 2013. specimens enrolled
children analyzed vitro sensitivity chloroquine (cq), amodiaquine 
(aq), mefloquine (mq), lumefantrine, artemisinin derivatives (artesunate 
dihydroartemisinin) drug resistance allele polymorphisms p. falciparum
crt (pfcrt), pfmdr-1, k13 propeller domain (k13). observed a
significant increase proportion samples pfcrt wild-type
(cvmnk) genotype, 61.2% 2010 93.0% 2013 (p < 0.0001), higher
proportions parasites elevated sensitivity cq vitro. majority
of isolates harbored wild-type n allele pfmdr-1 codon 86 (93.5%), with
only 7 (3.50%) samples n86y mutant allele (the mutant nucleotide is
underlined). likewise, isolates harbored wild-type pfmdr-1 d1246 allele 
(79.8%), 12 (6.38%) specimens d1246y mutant allele 26
(13.8%) mixed alleles. samples single copy pfmdr-1 gene
(mean 0.907 ± 0.141 copies). none sequenced parasites mutations 
k13. results suggest artemisinin likely remain highly efficacious 
and cq sensitivity appears rise western kenya.
