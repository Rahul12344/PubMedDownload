to identify genetic effects modulating blood stage replication the
malarial parasite, phenotyped group 25 inbred mouse strains for
susceptibility plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi infection (peak parasitemia,
survival). broad spectrum responses observed, strains as
c57bl/6j resistant (low parasitemia, 100% survival) strains
such nzw/lacj c3heb/fej extremely susceptible (very high parasitemia
and uniform lethality). number strains showed intermediate phenotypes and
gender-specific effects, suggestive rich genetic diversity response to
malaria inbred strains. f2 progeny generated sm/j (susceptible)
and c57bl/6j (resistant) parental strains, phenotyped susceptibility 
to p. chabaudi chabaudi as. whole-genome scan animals identified the
char1 locus (lod=7.40) chromosome 9 key regulator parasite density and
pointed conserved 0.4-mb haplotype char1 segregates with
susceptibility/resistance infection. addition, second locus detected 
in [sm/j Ã— c57bl/6j] f2 mice x chromosome (lod=4.26), given 
temporary designation char11. studies identify conserved role char1 in
regulating response malaria inbred mouse strains, provide prioritized
0.4-mb interval search positional candidates.
