background: many health facilities malaria endemic countries dependent 
rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) diagnosis national health service
(nhs) hospitals without expert microscopists rely diagnosis of
hours. emergence p. falciparum lacking gene encoding histidine-rich
protein 2 3 (hrp2 hrp3) escaping rdt detection threatens progress 
malaria control elimination. currently, confirmation rdt negative due to
the deletion pfhrp2 pfhrp3, encodes cross-reactive protein
isoform, requires series pcr assays. tests different limits of
detection many laboratories reported difficulty confirming the
absence deletions certainty.
methods: developed validated novel rapid multiplex real time
quantitative (qpcr) assay detect pfhrp2, pfhrp3, confirmatory parasite and
human reference genes simultaneously. also applied assay detect pfhrp2 
and pfhrp3 deletion 462 field samples different endemic countries uk 
travellers.
results: qpcr assay demonstrated diagnostic sensitivity 100% (n = 19, 95% 
ci= (82.3%; 100%)) diagnostic specificity 100% (n = 31; 95% ci= (88.8%;
100%)) detecting pfhrp2 pfhrp3 deletions. addition, assay estimates
p. falciparum parasite density accurately detects pfhrp2 pfhrp3 deletions
masked polyclonal infections. report pfhrp2 pfhrp3 deletions in
parasite isolates kenya, tanzania uk travellers.
interpretation: new qpcr easily scalable routine surveillance studies
in countries p. falciparum parasites lacking pfhrp2 pfhrp3 threat
to malaria control.
