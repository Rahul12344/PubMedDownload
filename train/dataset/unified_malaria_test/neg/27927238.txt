background: recent reports surge resistance insecticides
in pocketed areas ghana necessitating need information local
vector populations resistance insecticides approved world
health organization (who). therefore studied population malaria vectors
from kumasi ashanti region ghana resistance currently used
insecticides. conducted susceptibility tests four major classes of
insecticides collecting larvae anopheline mosquitoes several
communities region. surviving adults larvae subjected
to who-approved susceptibility tests characterization knockdown
resistance acetylcholinesterase mutant genes.
results: 619 anopheles specimens sampled, 537 (87%) identified as
anopheles gambiae (sensu stricto), also species lowest
knockdown resistance mutant gene, 61% (p = 0.017). knockdown resistance mutant
gene high 91% an. coluzzii. mosquitoes collected showed
susceptibility ranging 98-100% organophosphates, 38-56% carbamates and
15-47% 38-46% pyrethroids organochlorides, respectively. knockdown
resistance mutation frequency anopheles gambiae (sensu lato) mosquitoes that
were exposed pyrethroids organochlorides 404 (65%).
acetylcholinesterase mutant gene found population vectors.
conclusion: study shows pyrethroids highest level resistance
in population mosquito vectors studied probably due frequent use,
especially impregnation insecticide-treated nets insecticides used
to control pests irrigated vegetable farms. recommend studies monitor
trends use insecticides pyrethroids particular.
