aminopyrazoles new class antimalarial compounds identified cellular
antiparasitic screen potent activity plasmodium falciparum asexual
and sexual stage parasites. investigate unknown mechanism action 
thus identify target, cultured parasites presence a
representative member aminopyrazole series, gnf-pf4492, select for
resistance. whole genome sequencing three resistant lines showed had
acquired independent mutations p-type cation-transporter atpase, pfatp4
(pf3d7_1211900), protein implicated novel plasmodium spp. target of
another, structurally unrelated, class antimalarials called spiroindolones
and characterized important sodium transporter cell. similarly to
the spiroindolones, gnf-pf4492 blocks parasite transmission mosquitoes and
disrupts intracellular sodium homeostasis. data demonstrate pfatp4 plays
a critical role cellular processes, inhibited two distinct
antimalarial pharmacophores, supports recent observations pfatp4 
a critical antimalarial target.
