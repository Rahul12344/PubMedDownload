the enzyme ctp:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (cct) essential the
lipid biosynthesis plasmodia (haemosporida), presenting promising
antimalarial target. here, identified two independent gene duplication events 
of cct within apicomplexa characterized truncated construct plasmodium
falciparum cct forms dimer resembling molecular architecture cct
enzymes sources. based biophysical enzyme kinetics methods, our
data show cdp-choline product cct enzymatic reaction binds the
enzyme considerably stronger either substrate (ctp choline phosphate).
interestingly, presence mg²⁺ , considered cofactor the
enzyme, binding ctp substrate attenuated factor 5. the
weaker binding ctp:mg²⁺ , similarly related enzyme family aminoacyl 
trna synthetases, suggests that, lack mg²⁺ , positively charged side
chain(s) cct may contribute ctp accommodation. thermodynamic investigations
by isothermal titration calorimetry fluorescent spectroscopy studies indicate
that accommodation choline phosphate moiety cct active site is
different appears one substrates is
linked cdp-choline product. tryptophan residue within active site is
identified useful internal fluorescence sensor enzyme-ligand binding.
results indicate catalytic mechanism plasmodium falciparum cct may
involve conformational changes affecting choline subsite enzyme.
