the mosquito genome projects facilitated research new facets mosquito
biology, including functional genetic studies dengue zika virus vector
aedes aegypti primary african malaria vector anopheles gambiae. rna
interference (rnai) facilitated gene silencing experiments these
disease vector mosquito species could one day applied new method of
vector control. here, describe procedure genetic engineering of
saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) express short hairpin rna (shrna)
corresponding mosquito target genes interest. following cultivation, 
facilitates inexpensive propagation shrna, yeast inactivated and
prepared ready-to-use dry tablet formulation fed mosquito larvae.
ingestion yeast tablets results effective larval target gene silencing.
this technically straightforward affordable technique may applicable 
wide variety mosquito species potentially arthropods feed on
yeast.
