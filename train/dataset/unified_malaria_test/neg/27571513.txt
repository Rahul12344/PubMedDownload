leucocytozoon parasites infect many species avian hosts, including domestic
chicken, inflict heavy economic loss poultry industry. two major
species leucocytozoon parasites reported china, l. sabrazesi 
l. caulleryi, although l. sabrazesi appears widespread l.
caulleryi southern china. traditional method detecting leucocytozoon
infection microscopic examination blood smears presence mature
gametocytes circulation, may miss infections low parasitemia
(gametocytemia) immature gametocytes. developed pcr-based method 
monitor l. sabrazesi infections seven sites four provinces china after
testing two pcr primer pairs based parasite mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) 
and cytochrome c oxidase iii (coxiii) genes. compared results pcr
detection microscopic observation. expected, pcr assays were
more sensitive microscope examination detecting l. sabrazesi infection
and able detect parasite dna gametocytes disappeared blood
stream. using methods, investigated monthly dynamics l. sabrazesi 
chickens free-range farm xiamen, fujian province china, one
year. results showed chickens infected l. sabrazesi year-round
in southern china. finally, tested several compounds potential treatment
of leucocytozoon infections, including primaquine, ketotifen, clomipramine
hydrochloride, desipramine hydrochloride, sulfaquinoxaline, pyrimethamine.
only primaquine activity l. sabrazesi gametocytes. results
provide important information controlling parasite transmission southern
china disease management.
