malaria transmission requires production male female gametocytes in
the human host followed fertilization sporogonic development the
mosquito midgut. although essential spread malaria the
population, little known initiation gametocytogenesis vitro or
in vivo. using gametocyte-defective parasite line genetic complementation, 
we show plasmodium falciparumgametocyte development 1 gene (pfgdv1),
encoding peri-nuclear protein, critical early sexual differentiation.
transcriptional analysis pfgdv1 negative positive parasite lines
identified set gametocytogenesis early genes (pfge) significantly 
down-regulated (>10 fold) absence pfgdv1 expression restored
after pfgdv1 complementation. progressive accumulation pfge transcripts during
successive rounds asexual replication synchronized cultures suggests that
gametocytes induced continuously asexual growth. comparison pfge
gene transcriptional profiles patient samples divided genes two
groups differing expression mature circulating gametocytes and
providing candidates evaluate gametocyte induction maturation separately
in vivo. expression profile one early gametocyte specific genes,
pfge1, correlated significantly asexual parasitemia, consistent
with ongoing induction gametocytogenesis asexual growth observed in
vitro reinforces need sustained transmission-blocking strategies to
eliminate malaria.
