two members 6-cysteine (6-cys) protein family, p48/45 p230, important 
for gamete fertility rodent human malaria parasites leading
transmission blocking vaccine antigens. rodent human parasites encode a
paralog p230, called p230p. p230 expressed male female
parasites, p230p expressed male gametocytes gametes. rodent
malaria parasites protein dispensable throughout complete life-cycle;
however, function p. falciparum unknown. using crispr/cas9 methodology 
we disrupted gene encoding pfp230p resulting p. falciparum mutants
(pfδp230p) lacking p230p expression. pfδp230p mutants produced normal numbers
of male female gametocytes, retained expression p48/45 p230.
upon activation male pfδp230p gametocytes undergo exflagellation form male
gametes. however, male gametes unable attach red blood cells resulting 
in absence characteristic exflagellation centres vitro. absence 
of p230p, zygote formation well oocyst sporozoite development were
strongly reduced (>98%) mosquitoes. observations demonstrate p230p,
like p230 p48/45, vital role p. falciparum male fertility zygote
formation warrants investigation potential transmission blocking
vaccine candidate.
