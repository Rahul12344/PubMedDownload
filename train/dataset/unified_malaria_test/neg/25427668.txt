framework genomics human traits disease.

peprah e, xu h, tekola-ayele f, royal cd.

genomic research one tools elucidating pathogenesis diseases
of global health relevance paving research dimension clinical and
public health translation. recent advances genomic research technologies
have increased understanding human diseases, genes associated these
disorders, relevant mechanisms. genome-wide association studies (gwas)
have proliferated since first studies published several years ago and
have become important tool helping researchers comprehend human variation
and role genetic variants play disease. however, need expand the
diversity populations gwas become increasingly apparent new
knowledge gained genetic variation. inclusion diverse populations 
genomic studies critical complete understanding human variation
and elucidation underpinnings complex diseases. review, we
summarize available data gwas recent african ancestry populations
within western hemisphere (i.e. african americans peoples the
caribbean) continental african populations. furthermore, highlight ways in
which genomic studies populations recent african ancestry led to
advances areas malaria, hiv, prostate cancer, diseases.
finally, discuss advantages conducting gwas recent african ancestry 
populations context addressing existing emerging global health
conditions.
