plasmodium falciparum origin recognition complex subunit 1 (pforc1) been
implicated dna replication var gene regulation. c-terminus is
involved dna replication, specific role n-terminus suggested
in var gene regulation sir2-dependent manner. pforc1 localized the
nuclear periphery, clustering chromosomal ends early stage of
parasite development may crucial regulation subtelomeric var gene
expression. upon disassembly telomeric clusters later stages parasite
development, orc1 distributed nucleus parasite cytoplasm it
may required cellular functions including dna replication. the
level orc1 decreases dramatically late schizont stage. mechanisms
that mediate regulation pforc1 function largely unknown. show, 
the use recombinant proteins transgenic parasites expressing wild type 
or mutant forms orc1, phosphorylation pforc1-n terminal domain 
the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) pfpk5 abolishes dna-binding activity leads 
to changes subcellular localization proteasome-mediated degradation the
protein schizonts. results reveal pforc1 phosphorylation cdk
is central regulation important biological functions like dna
replication var gene silencing.
