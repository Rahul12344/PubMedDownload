background: north-east region india consistent role spread multi
drug resistant plasmodium (p.) falciparum parts southeast asia. after
rapid clinical treatment failure artemisinin based combination
therapy-sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (act-sp) chemoprophylaxis,
artemether-lumefantrine (act-al) combination therapy introduced year
2012 region treatment uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria. 
a dna sequencing based polymorphism analysis, seven codons p. falciparum
dihydropteroate synthetase (pfdhps) gene screened total 127 p.
falciparum isolates collected assam, arunachal pradesh tripura of
north-east india year 2014 2015 document current sulfadoxine
resistant haplotypes.
materials methods: sequences analyzed rearrange nucleotide and
protein haplotypes. molecular diversity indices analyzed dna sequence
polymorphism software (dnasp) basis pfdhps gene sequences.
disappearance selective neutrality assessed based ratio of
non-synonomous synonomous nucleotide substitutions [dn/ds ratio]. moreover,
two-tailed z test performed search significance probability 
rejecting null hypothesis strict neutrality [dn = ds]. presence mutant p.
falciparum multidrug resistance protein1 (pfmdr1) also checked those
isolates present new pfdhps haplotypes. phylogenetic relationship 
based pfdhps gene reconstructed molecular evolutionary genetics
analysis (mega).
results: among eight different sulfadoxine resistant haplotypes found, gng a
haplotype documented total five isolates tripura with
association new mutant m538 r allele. sequence analysis pfmdr1 gene in
these five isolates came notice one isolate mutant
at codon 86 (n86 ; ysnd) multidrug resistance protein. molecular
diversity based pfdhps haplotypes revealed p. falciparum populations in
assam tripura balancing selection sulfadoxine resistant
haplotypes population arunachal pradesh positive selection
with comparatively high haplotype diversity (h = 0.870). reconstructed
phylogenetic analysis, isolates gng haplotype grouped two
separate sub-clusters isolates based genetic distances
and diversities.
conclusion: study suggests sulfadoxine resistant isolates still
migrating epicenter parts southeast asia hence
control elimination drug resistant isolates become impedimental. 
moreover, p. falciparum populations different areas may undergo selection of
particular sulfadoxine resistant haplotypes either presence drug or
after removal maintain plasticity.
