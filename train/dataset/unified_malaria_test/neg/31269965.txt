background: aedes aegypti ae. albopictus important vectors infectious 
diseases, especially caused arboviruses dengue, chikungunya 
zika. aedes aegypti well adapted urban environments, whereas ae.
albopictus inhabits rural settings. pyrethroid resistance widespread in
these vectors, limited data exist southwest pacific region,
especially melanesia. aedes vector ecology well documented in
australia, incursion ae. albopictus pyrethroid resistance so
far prevented, almost nothing known aedes populations in
neighbouring papua new guinea (png). pyrethroid resistance documented in
parts indonesia australia, important determine the
distribution susceptible resistant aedes populations region.
methods: present study aimed assessing aedes populations for
insecticide resistance madang port moresby, located north south
coasts png, respectively. mosquitoes collected using ovitraps reared 
in insectary. standard bioassays using insecticide-treated filter papers
were conducted total 253 ae. aegypti 768 ae. albopictus adult
mosquitoes. subsets samples species (55 ae. aegypti 48 ae.
albopictus) screened knockdown resistance mutations the
voltage-sensitive sodium channel (vssc) gene, target site pyrethroid
insecticides.
results: high levels resistance pyrethroids identified ae.
aegypti madang port moresby. aedes albopictus exhibited susceptibility
to pyrethroids, moderate levels resistance ddt. mutations associated
with pyrethroid resistance detected ae. aegypti samples screened.
some genotypes found present study observed previously in
indonesia. vssc mutations associated pyrethroid resistance found 
the ae. albopictus samples.
conclusions: knowledge, first report pyrethroid resistance 
in ae. aegypti mosquitoes png. interestingly, usage insecticides png 
low, apart long-lasting insecticidal nets distributed malaria control.
further investigations resistant ae. aegypti mosquito populations
arose png sustained warranted.
