conditional genome engineering human malaria pathogen plasmodium
falciparum remains highly challenging. describe strategy facile and
rapid functional analysis genes using approach based cre/lox system 
and tailored organisms short introns. method allows the
conditional, site-specific removal genomic sequences essential and
non-essential genes placing loxp sites short synthetic intron to
produce module (loxpint) placed anywhere open reading frames without 
compromising protein expression. duplicated, loxpint module serves an
intragenic recombineering point used fusion gene elements 
to reporters conditional introduction point mutations. demonstrate
the robustness versatility system targeting p. falciparum
merozoite surface protein 1 gene (msp1), previously proven refractory
to genetic interrogation, parasite exported kinase fikk10.1.
