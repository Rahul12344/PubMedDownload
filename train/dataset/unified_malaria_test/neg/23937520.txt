apicomplexan parasites invade host cells conserved mechanism: parasite
proteins secreted apical organelles, anchored host cell plasma
membrane, interact integral membrane proteins zoite surface 
to form moving junction (mj). junction moves anterior the
posterior parasite resulting parasite internalization host
cell within parasitophorous vacuole (pv). conserved well coccidia-unique 
rhoptry neck proteins (rons) described, associate with
the mj. report novel ron, call ron12. ron12 found in
plasmodium highly conserved across genus. ron12 lacks membrane
anchor major soluble component nascent pv. bulk ron12
secretion happens late invasion (after parasite internalization) allowing 
accumulation fully formed pv small proportion ron12 also
apparent occasionally structures resembling mj. ron12, unlike other
rons essential, deletion gene affect parasite
proliferation. data suggest although overall mechanism invasion
by apicomplexan parasites conserved, additional components depending the
parasite-host cell combination required.
