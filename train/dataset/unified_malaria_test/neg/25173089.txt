dengue virus (denv) transmitted saliva mosquito vector aedes
aegypti blood meal acquisition. saliva composed numerous
proteins capacity disrupt hemostasis modulate vertebrate
immune response. one protein, termed "aegyptin," allergen and
inhibitor clot formation, found decreased abundance the
saliva denv-infected mosquitoes. examine influence aegyptin denv 
infection vertebrate, inoculated irf-3/7(-/- -/-) mice denv
serotype 2 strain 1232 without co-inoculation aegyptin. mice that
received aegyptin exhibited decreased denv titers inoculation sites in
circulation, well increased concentrations gm-csf, ifn-γ, il-5, and
il-6, 48 h post-inoculation compared mice received inoculation of
denv alone. data suggest aegyptin impacts denv perpetuation 
via elevated induction immune response.
