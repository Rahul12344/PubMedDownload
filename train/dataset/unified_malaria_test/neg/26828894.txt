the prevalence vector-borne parasitic diseases widely influenced by
biological ecological factors. environmental conditions temperature
and precipitation marked effect haemosporidian parasites
(plasmodium spp.) cause malaria cause malaria-like
diseases birds. however, long-term studies monitoring
haemosporidian infections birds northern latitudes, weather
conditions highly variable effects climate change becoming 
more pronounced. used molecular methods screen 2,000 blood
samples collected black-capped chickadees (poecile atricapillus), resident
passerine bird. samples collected 10 year period, mostly the
non-breeding season, seven sites alaska, usa. tested associations
between plasmodium prevalence local environmental conditions including
temperature, precipitation, site, year season. also evaluated the
relationship parasite prevalence individual host factors age, sex 
and presence absence avian keratin disorder. disease, causes
accelerated keratin growth beak, provided natural study system 
to test interaction disease state malaria prevalence. prevalence 
of plasmodium infection varied year, site, age individual disease status
but support effect sex seasonal period. significantly, 
birds avian keratin disorder 2.6 times likely infected by
plasmodium birds without disorder. interannual variation the
prevalence plasmodium infection different sites positively correlated
with summer temperatures local statewide scale. sequence analysis 
of parasite cytochrome b gene revealed single plasmodium spp. lineage, p43.
our results demonstrate associations prevalence avian malaria a
variety biological ecological factors. results also provide
important baseline data informative predicting future changes in
plasmodium prevalence subarctic.
