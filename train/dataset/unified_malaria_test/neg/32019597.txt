background: various transcription factors involved process mutually
exclusive expression clonal variation plasmodium multigene (var)
family. recent studies revealed p. falciparum swi/snf-related
matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator chromatin (pfswib) might trigger
stage-specific programmed cell death (pcd), crucial the
survival development parasite, also profound effects the
parasite interacting unknown proteins. however, remains unclear 
whether pfsiwb involved transcriptional regulation virulence gene
and functional properties.
methods: conditional knockdown system "pfswib-fkbp-lid" introduced the
parasite clone 3d7, integrated parasite line "pfswib-ha-fkbp-lid" was
obtained drug cycling clone screening. growth curve analysis (gca) was
performed investigate growth development different parasite lines
during 96 h vitro culturing, assessing parasitemia. finally, performed
qpcr assays detect var gene expression profiling various comparison groups,
as well mutually exclusive expression pattern var genes within a
single 48 h life-cycle p. falciparum different parasite lines. addition,
rna-seq applied analyze var gene expression different lines.
results: gca revealed conditional knockdown pfswib could interfere with
the growth development p. falciparum. parasitemia pfswib∆ showed 
significant decline 96 h vitro culture compared pfswib 
3d7 lines (p < 0.0001). qpcr rna-seq analysis confirmed depletion of
pfswib silences upsa, upsc partial upsb var genes, well as
removes silencing partial upsb var genes ring stage pfswib∆
line, also leads aberrant expression upsa partial upsb/upsc var
genes mature stage p. falciparum, single 48-h life-cycle.
conclusions: demonstrated pfswib involved process clonal
variation var gene expression, crucial survival development of
plasmodium parasite. findings could provide better understanding the
mechanism function pfswib contributing pathogenesis malaria
parasites.
