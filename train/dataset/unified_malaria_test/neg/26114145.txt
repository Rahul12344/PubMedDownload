background: anopheles stephensi sub-tropical species considered
as one important vector human malaria throughout middle east
and south asian region including malarious areas southern iran. current
reports confirmed an. stephensi resistance temephos oman india.
however, comprehensive research mechanisms temephos resistance 
in an. stephensi literature. study designed order clarify
the enzymatic molecular mechanisms temephos resistance species.
methods: profile activities α- ß-esterases, mixed function oxidase (mfo), 
glutathione-s-transferase (gst), insensitive acetylcholinesterase, and
para-nitrophenyl acetate (pnpa)-esterase enzymes tested an. stephensi
strain resistance ratio 15.82 temephos comparison susceptible 
strain.
results: results showed mean activity α-est, gst ache enzymes
were classified altered indicating metabolic mechanisms considerable role
in resistance an. stephensi temephos. molecular study using pcr-rflp method
to trace g119s mutation ace-1 gene showed lack mutation responsible
for organophosphate insecticide resistance temephos-selected strain an.
stephensi.
conclusion: study showed altered enzymes targets site
insensitivity ace-1 responsible temephos resistance an. stephensi
in south iran.
