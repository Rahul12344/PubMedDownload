antigenic polymorphism displayed malaria parasites skewed schema to
escape host immune system. prevailing genetic diversity domain ii of
the plasmodium vivax apical membrane antigen-1 (pvama-1dii) characterized 
64 single clone p. vivax isolates sri lanka, unstable malaria prevails
with low intensity. sri lanka, pvama-1dii gene showed meager meiotic
recombination enclosure single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps).
eleven amino acid (a.a.) variant positions defined 21 a.a. haplotypes 9
unique island, predominant haplotype, h1, identical the
reference salvador strain. 376 globally dispersed isolates defined 38
a.a. haplotypes (h22-h59), 4 26 haplotypes exclusive india and
thailand, respectively. phylogenetic tree revealed clustering, 
isolates recent common origin. polymorphism detected pvama-1dii
b cell epitopes evidenced immune evasion mechanism exploited the
parasite. majority sri lankan patients developed antibody responses both
conformational linear b cell epitopes. ensuing strain-specific immunity
due extensive antigenic polymorphism evaluated aligning a.a. sequences 
of pvama-1dii homologous total (igm+igg) antibody responses assayed by
in-house established indirect elisas 7 pvama-1dii overlapping synthetic
peptides, p01-p07. antibody responses p01-p03, p06, p07 harbouring
p. vivax clinical isolates polymorphic a.a. haplotype sal clearly
strain-transcending (cross-reactive), individuals isolates identical 
sal strain observed varying antibody prevalence seven pvama-1dii
sal-i synthetic peptides, highest prevalence detected p04.
synthetic peptide p04, spanning a.a. positions 302-324 pvama-1dii the
sal strain included epitope recognized invasion inhibitory 4g2 
monoclonal antibody pfama-1, highly conserved 440 local global 
p. vivax isolates examined. functional role region reinforced by
the highly immunogenic nature p04, could point towards presumably
"protective" anti-p04 antibody response elicited isotype switch igm 
to igg, increasing exposure malaria exclusively endemic residents.
thus conserved seemingly "protective" nature domain ii loop of
pvama-1 makes putative contender included cocktail vaccine
against p. vivax asexual erythrocytic stages sri lanka.
