background: major concerns sustaining efficacy current
malaria vector control interventions given rapid spread resistance,
particularly pyrethroids. study assessed bioefficacy five
who-recommended long-lasting insecticidal nets (llins) against
pyrethroid-resistant anopheles gambiae field populations uganda.
methods: adult an. gambiae lira, tororo, wakiso kanungu districts were
exposed permethrin (0.75%) deltamethrin (0.05%) standard who
susceptibility tests. cone bioassays used measure bioefficacy four
mono-treated llins (olyset®, interceptor®, netprotect® permanet® 2.0) one
combination llin (permanet® 3.0) four mosquito populations. wireball 
assays similarly conducted determine knockdown rates. species composition
and kdr mutation frequency determined sample mosquitoes each
population. chemical assays confirmed test nets fell within target dose
ranges.
results: anopheles gambiae s.s. predominated four sites (86-99% of
anopheles spp.) moderate kdr l1014s allelic frequency (0.34-0.37). confirmed
or possible resistance permethrin deltamethrin identified all
four test populations. reduced susceptibility standard llins observed 
all four populations, mortality rates low 45.8% even though nets
were unused. combination llin permanet®3.0 showed highest overall
bioefficacy four an. gambiae s.l. populations (98.5-100% mortality). 
wireball assays provided sensitive indicator comparative bioefficacy,
and permanet 3.0 associated highest bioefficacy all
four populations (76.5-91.7% mortality 30 mins).
conclusions: bioefficacy mono-treated llins pyrethroid-resistant
field populations an. gambiae varied llin type mosquito population,
indicating certain llins may suitable others particular
sites. contrast, combination llin permanet 3.0 performed optimally against
the four an. gambiae populations tested. observed reduced susceptibility of
malaria vectors mono-treated llins particular concern, especially
considering nets unused. ongoing scale-up insecticidal tools 
the advent increasing resistance, essential interventions
with proven enhanced efficacy given preference particularly areas with
high resistance.
