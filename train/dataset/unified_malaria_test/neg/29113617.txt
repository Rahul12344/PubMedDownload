cyclospora cayetanensis coccidian parasite associated diarrheal
illness. usa, foodborne outbreaks cyclosporiasis documented
almost every year since mid-1990s. typical approach used identify this
parasite human stools examination acid-fast-stained smears under
bright-field microscopy. uv fluorescence microscopy wet mounts more
sensitive specific acid-fast staining requires fluorescence
microscope special filter commonly available diagnostic
laboratories. study, evaluated new dna extraction method based on
the universal nucleic acid extraction (unex) buffer compared performances
of four published real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays the
specific detection c. cayetanensis stool. unex-based method an
improved capability recover dna oocysts compared fastdna stool
extraction method. best-performing real-time pcr assay c.
cayetanensis-specific taqman pcr targets 18s ribosomal rna gene. this
new testing algorithm useful detection c. cayetanensis human 
stool samples.
