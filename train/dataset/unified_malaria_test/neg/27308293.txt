background: wolbachia common intracellular bacteria infect different
groups arthropods including mosquitoes. bacteria modify host biology and
may induce feminization, parthenogenesis, male killing cytoplasmic
incompatibility (ci). recently wolbachia nominated bio-agent and
paratransgenic candidate control mosquito borne diseases.
methods: report results survey presence, frequency, and
phylogenetic congruence endosymbiont bacteria culex pipiens
populations northern, central, southern parts iran using nested-pcr
amplification wsp gene.
results: wolbachia dna found 227 (87.3%) 260 wild-caught
mosquitoes. rate infection adult females ranged 61.5% 100%,
while males 80% 100%. blast search phylogenetic analysis 
of wsp gene sequence revealed wolbachia strain iranian cx.
pipiens identical wolbachia strains supergroup b previously
reported members cx. pipiens complex. also identical sequence 
homology wolbachia strains group distinct arthropods including
lepidopteran, wasps, flies, damselfly, thrips, mites remote geographical
areas world.
conclusion: suggested wolbachia strains horizontally transfer 
unrelated host organisms evolutionary time. also results study
indicates wolbachia infections highly prevalent infecting cx.
pipiens populations throughout country, however study needs define
wolbachia inter-population reproductive incompatibility pattern its
usefulness bio-agent control measure.
