populations sub-saharan africa historically exposed intense
selection chronic infection falciparum malaria. interestingly,
populations highest malaria intensity identified increased
occurrence endemic burkitt lymphoma (ebl), pediatric cancer affects
populations intense malaria exposure, called "ebl belt" in
sub-saharan africa. however, effects intense malaria exposure and
sub-saharan populations' genetic histories remain poorly explored. determine
if historical migrations intense malaria exposure shaped genetic
composition ebl belt populations, genotyped ~4.3 million snps 1,708 
individuals ghana northern uganda, located opposite sides ebl belt
and ≥ 7 months/year intense malaria exposure published evidence of
high incidence bl. among 35 ghanaian tribes, showed predominantly
west-central african ancestry genomic footprints gene flow gambian
and east african populations. uganda, north west population showed a
predominantly nilotic ancestry, north central population mixture of
nilotic southern bantu ancestry, southwest ugandan population
showed predominant southern bantu ancestry. results support hypothesis 
of diverse ancestral origins ugandan, kenyan tanzanian great lakes
african populations, reflecting confluence nilotic, cushitic bantu
migrations last 3000 years. natural selection analyses suggest, the
first time, strong positive selection signal atp2b4 gene (rs10900588) in
northern ugandan populations. findings provide important baseline genomic
data facilitate disease association studies, including ebl, ebl belt
populations.
