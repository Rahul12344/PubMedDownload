over past years only, next-generation sequencing technologies became
accessible many applications rapidly derived, development of
rna-seq, technique uses deep sequencing profile whole transcriptomes.
rna-seq power discover new transcripts splicing variants,
single-nucleotide variations, fusion genes, mrna level-based expression
profiles. preparing rna-seq libraries delicate usually obligates
buying expensive kits require large amounts stating materials. method
presented flexible cost-effective. using method, prepared
high-quality strand-specific rna-seq libraries rna extracted human 
malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum. libraries compatible with
illumina(Â®)'s sequencers genome analyzer hi-seq. method can, however, 
easily adapted platforms.
