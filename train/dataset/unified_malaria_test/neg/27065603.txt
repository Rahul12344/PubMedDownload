parasitological methods diagnosis visceral leishmaniasis (vl) require 
invasive sampling procedures. aim study detect leishmania
infantum (l. infantum) dna real time-pcr method peripheral blood of
symptomatic vl patient compared performance nested pcr, an
established molecular method high diagnostic indices. 47
parasitologically confirmed vl patients diagnosed direct agglutination test
(dat > 3200), bone marrow aspiration presented characteristic clinical
features (fever, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia) 40 controls (non-endemic
healthy control-30, malaria-2, toxoplasma gondii-2, mycobacterium tuberculosis-2,
hbv-1, hcv-1, hsv-1 cmv-1) enrolled study. sybr-green based real
time-pcr nested pcr performed amplify kinetoplast dna minicircle
gene using dna extracted buffy coat. among 47 patients, 45 (95.7 %)
were positive nested-pcr real time-pcr. results indicate that
real time-pcr sensitive nested-pcr assay detection of
leishmania kdna clinical sample, also rapid. advantage real
time-pcr based methods nested-pcr simple perform, faster which
nested-pcr requires post-pcr processing reducing contamination risk.
