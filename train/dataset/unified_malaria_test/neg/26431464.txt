antimalarial drug resistance one major challenges global efforts 
malaria control elimination. 1998, chloroquine abandoned replaced 
with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, turn replaced with
artemether/lumefantrine treatment uncomplicated falciparum malaria 
2004. sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine resistance associated mutations in
dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps) genes. the
prevalence mutation pfdhfr pfdhps genes evaluated compared for
a total 159 isolates collected two different time points, 2005 2007/08,
from pawe hospital, north western ethiopia. frequency triple pfdhfr
mutation decreased significantly 50.8% (32/63) 15.9% (10/63) (p<0.001),
while pfdhps double mutation remained high changed marginally 69.2%
(45/65) 55.4% (40/65) (p = 0.08). combined pfdhfr/pfdhps quintuple
mutation, strongly associated sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine resistance,
was significantly decreased 40.7% (24/59) 13.6% (8/59) (p<0.0001). the
whole, significant decline mutant alleles re-emergence wild type
alleles observed. change frequency explained reduction 
of residual drug-resistant parasites caused strong drug pressure imposed
when sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine first-line drug, followed lower fitness
of resistant parasites absence drug pressure. despite the
decrease frequency mutant alleles, higher percentages mutation
remain prevalent study area 2007/08 pfdhfr pfdhps genes.
therefore, multi-centered studies different parts country 
be required assess re-emergence sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine sensitive
parasites monitor prevent establishment multi drug resistant
parasites region.
