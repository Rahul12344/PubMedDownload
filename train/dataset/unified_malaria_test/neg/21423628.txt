sera gene sequences newly determined 11 primate plasmodium species
including two human parasites, p. ovale p. malariae, evolutionary
history sera genes analyzed together 7 known species. one
each group iii cysteine-type sera genes varying number group iv
serine-type sera genes tandem cluster. notably, group iv sera genes were
ascertained mammalian parasite lineages; two primate parasite
lineages gene events duplication, truncation, fragmentation gene loss
occurred high frequency manner mimics birth-and-death evolution 
model. transcription profile individual sera genes varied greatly among rodent
and monkey parasites. results support lineage-specific evolution the
plasmodium sera gene family. findings provide impetus studies
that could clarify/provide proof-of-concept duplications sera genes
