the class hematozoa encompasses several clinically important genera, including
plasmodium, whose members cause major life-threating disease malaria. hence, 
a good understanding interrelationships organisms class and
reliable means distinguishing much importance. study reports
comprehensive phylogenetic comparative analyses protein sequences the
genomes 28 hematozoa species understand interrelationships. in
addition phylogenetic trees based two large datasets protein sequences, 
detailed comparative analyses carried genomes hematozoa
species identify novel molecular synapomorphies consisting conserved
signature indels (csis) protein sequences. studies identified 79
csis exclusively present specific groups hematozoa/plasmodium
species, also supported phylogenetic analysis, providing reliable means for
the identification species groups understanding their
interrelationships. csis, six csis specifically shared all
hematozoa species, two csis serve distinguish members order
piroplasmida, five csis uniquely found piroplasmida species except b. 
microti two csis specific genus theileria. additionally, also 
describe 23 csis exclusively present genome-sequenced plasmodium 
species two, nine, ten eight csis specific members the
plasmodium subgenera haemamoeba, laverania, vinckeia plasmodium (excluding p.
ovale p. malariae), respectively. additionally, work identified
several csis support species relationships evident from
phylogenetic analysis. csis, one csi supports ancestral nature of
the avian-plasmodium species comparison mammalian-infecting groups of
plasmodium species, four csis strongly support specific relationship species
between subgenera plasmodium vinckeia three csis reliably
group p. malariae members subgenus plasmodium p. ovale within the
subgenus vinckeia, respectively. results provide reliable framework for
understanding evolutionary relationships among plasmodium/piroplasmida
species. further, view exclusivity described molecular markers
for indicated groups hematozoa species, particularly large numbers of
unique characteristics specific plasmodium species, provide
important molecular tools biochemical/genetic studies developing
novel diagnostics therapeutics organisms.
