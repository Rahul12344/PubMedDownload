precise mosquito species identification essential step proper
management control malaria vectors. misidentification members the
anopheles dirus complex, primary malaria vectors thailand and
mainland southeast asia, remains problematic indistinguishable or
overlapping morphological characters sibling species. moreover, 
a need alternative methods, since existing molecular techniques the
literature entirely satisfactory differentiating members the
an. dirus complex. nucleotide polymorphisms mitochondrial cytochrome c
oxidase subunit (coi) sequences developed identify 4 species within
the an. dirus complex using allele-specific (as) multiplex polymerase chain
reaction (pcr). identified primers amplified clearly differentiated 4
members complex found thailand, anopheles dirus, an. cracens, an.
scanloni, an. baimaii pcr products 428/104, 236, 625, 428 bp,
respectively. results demonstrate as-pcr based coi region
can accurately identify 4 members an. dirus complex would useful 
alternative pcr-based method accurate species identification.
