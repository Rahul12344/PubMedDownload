background: malaria significant public health concern haiti where
approximately 30,000 cases reported annually cdc estimates high as
200,000. malaria infections haiti caused almost exclusively plasmodium 
falciparum, small number plasmodium malariae even smaller
number putative plasmodium vivax infections reported. lack of
confirmed p. vivax infections haiti could due genetic background 
native haitians. descended west african populations, many haitians
could duffy negative due single nucleotide polymorphism thymine to
cytosine gata box promoter region duffy antigen receptor for
chemokines (darc) gene. mutation, encoded fyes allele, eliminates the
expression duffy antigen erythrocytes, reduces invasion p.
vivax. study investigated frequency fyes allele p. vivax
infections malaria patients goal uncovering factors lack
of p. vivax infections reported haiti.
methods: dna extracted dried blood spots collected malaria patients
at four clinic locations haiti. samples analysed polymerase chain 
reaction (pcr) presence p. vivax small subunit ribosomal rna gene.
pcr, sequencing, restriction enzyme digestion used detect the
presence fyes allele. matched samples examined presence of
p. vivax fyes allele.
results: cases p. vivax detected samples (0/136). all
samples tested fyes allele, 99.4% fyes allele (163/164). the
matched samples, 99% fyes allele (98/99).
conclusions: preliminary study, cases p. vivax confirmed by
pcr 99% malaria patients tested carried fyes allele. high
frequency fyes allele silences erythroid expression duffy
antigen offers biologically plausible explanation lack p. vivax
infections observed. results provide insights host susceptibility
for p. vivax infections never investigated haiti.
