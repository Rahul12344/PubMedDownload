background: complex interactions human host plasmodium
falciparum parasite factors influencing severity disease still not
fully understood. human single nucleotide polymorphisms snps associated with
knops blood group system; carried complement receptor 1 may associated with
the pathology p. falciparum malaria, susceptibility disease.
methods: objective study determine genotype haplotype 
frequencies snps defining knops blood group antigens; kna/b, mccoya/b,
swain-langley1/2 kcam+/- ghanaian patients malaria determine
possible associations polymorphisms severity the
disease. study participants patients (n = 267) admitted emergency
room department child health, korle-bu teaching hospital, accra, ghana 
during malaria season june august 1995, 1996 1997, classified 
as uncomplicated malaria (n = 89), severe anaemia (n = 57) cerebral malaria
(n = 121) controls detectable plasmodium infection were
symptomless carriers parasite (n = 275). frequencies determined
using post-pcr ligation detection reaction-fluorescent microsphere assay,
developed detect snps defining antigens. chi-square/fisher's exact
test logistic regression models used analyse data.
results: expected, high frequencies alleles kna, mccb, sl2 kcam-
were found ghanaian population. apart small significant differences
between groups sl locus, significant allelic genotypic
differences found controls disease groups the
disease groups. polymorphisms define eight different haplotypes h1(2.4%),
h2(9.4%), h3(59.8%), h4(0%), h5(25.2%), h6(0.33%), h7(2.8%) h8(0%).
investigating haplotypes, significant differences the
groups found.
conclusion: results confirm earlier findings high frequencies certain
cr1 alleles africa; shed light earlier conflicting findings; the
alleles mccb, sl2, knb kcam- combined haplotypes seem confer any
protective advantage malaria infection resulting disease severity.
based findings, well-characterized population, malaria does
not seem selective force alleles.
