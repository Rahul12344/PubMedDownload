catabolism glycerophospholipids rapid growth asexual
intraerythrocytic malaria parasite may contribute membrane recycling the
acquisition lipid biosynthetic precursors host. better understand 
the scope lipid catabolism plasmodium falciparum, characterized a
malarial homolog bacterial glycerophosphodiesterases. enzymes catalyze
the hydrolysis glycerophosphodiesterases generated by
phospholipase-catalyzed removal two acyl groups glycerophospholipids.
the p. falciparum glycerophosphodiesterase (pfgdpd) exhibits unusual
tripartite distribution asexual blood stage pools enzyme in
the parasitophorous vacuole, food vacuole cytosol. efforts disrupt the
chromosomal pfgdpd coding sequence unsuccessful, implies the
enzyme important efficient parasite growth. tagging endogenous pool
of pfgdpd conditional aggregation domain partially perturbed the
distribution enzyme parasitophorous vacuole discernable 
effect growth culture. kinetic characterization hydrolysis of
glycerophosphocholine recombinant pfgdpd, mg(2+)-dependent enzyme, yielded 
steady-state parameters comparable homologous bacterial
glycerophosphodiesterase. together, results suggest physiological role
for pfgdpd glycerophospholipid catabolism multiple subcellular
compartments. possibilities role might discussed.
