superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (spions) used therapeutic
and diagnostic agents due unique magnetic characteristics, provided that
they stable physiological conditions. here, assembly different
magnetic vector configurations comprising spions, polyethylenimine (pei), and
hyaluronic acid (ha), acting carriers malaria dna vaccine encoding
plasmodium yoelii merozoite surface protein msp1-19 (vr1020-pymsp1-19), their
stability different cell media investigated. order assembly
affected vector size, surface charge, stability, ability bind release 
dna. generally, vectors showed relatively small size less 200 nm in
water, whereas higher degree aggregation observed immediately after
transferring high-ionic strength media 150 mm nacl buffer rpmi
1640 culture media (roswell park memorial institute medium). however, the
pre-addition ha dna effectively reduced extent aggregation in
serum-free rpmi 1640 sizes almost complexes remaining 90 nm,
particularly ha:pei charge ratio 100%. presence fetal bovine serum
(fbs) rpmi 1640 culture media converted surface charge vectors 
from positive negative, decreasing size smaller 50 nm. partial
disassembly vectors observed water, rpmi, rpmi
supplemented 10% fbs incubation 1h, nacl buffer,
indicating incubation complexes nacl buffer prior transfection may 
limit intracellular release plasmid dna. dnase sensitivity assay showed
that plasmid dna vaccine encoding pymsp1-19 configurations preserved
their structural integrity without damage, even dnase treatment 30
min. study demonstrated structurally well-defined magnetic gene
carriers could designed improve malaria dna vaccine delivery systems,
particularly vivo applications.
