the highly sensitive specific detection pfg377 gene plasmodium
falciparum gametocyte using magnetic nanoparticles pcr enzyme-linked gene assay
(melga) successfully developed. melga included amplification the
pfg377 gene polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using magnetic nanoparticles
(mnps)-conjugated forward primer biotinylated reverse primer, followed by
post-analytical process using horseradish peroxidase (hrp)-conjugated
streptavidin (sa). complexes melga product incubated the
peroxidase substrate hydrogen peroxide produce signal colorimetric
measurement. altogether, melga technique provided highly sensitive and
specific detection 1 p. falciparum gametocyte/µl, efficient
than microscopic examination rapid diagnostic tests (rdts).
additionally, melga could detect target gene femtogram level, was
greater sensitive conventional pcr, nested pcr loop-mediated
isothermal amplification (lamp). melga technique could become novel and
practical method overcome limitation traditional gametocyte detection.
