background: plasmodium knowlesi monkey malaria species becoming a
serious public health concern infecting hundreds perhaps thousands humans 
in southeast asia. invasion erythrocytes merozoites entails cascade of
molecular interactions. one step involves adhesion plasmodium reticulocyte
binding-like (rbl) proteins. plasmodium knowlesi merozoites express two rbl 
invasion ligands, known normocyte binding proteins (pknbpxa pknbpxb).
methods: overlapping n-terminal regions pknbpxa pknbpxb expressed 
cos7 cells tested surface expression adhesion rhesus monkey
erythrocytes. subsequent tests study specific receptor ligand interactions
included adhesion panel human non-human primate erythrocytes,
enzymatic treatment, site directed mutagenesis.
results: n-terminal cysteine-rich region pknbpxb (pknbpxb-ii) exhibited
specific adhesion rhesus monkey erythrocytes. mutation four five
cysteines pknbpxb-ii interfered surface expression cos7 cells,
suggesting disulphide bond conformation critical intracellular
trafficking. binding pknbpxb-ii abolished rhesus erythrocytes were
pre-treated chymotrypsin, trypsin neuraminidase. pknbpxb-ii also 
bound old world monkey species gibbon erythrocytes. however,
erythrocytes primate species including humans bind to
pknbpxb-ii native pknbpxb. importantly, unlike pknbpxb, pknbpxa bound human
erythrocytes, binding independent duffy blood group
determinant.
conclusions: data reported begins clarify functional domains of
the p. knowlesi rbls. binding domain identified characterized in
pknbpxb. notably, study demonstrates unlike pknbpxb, pknbpxa bind
to human erythrocytes, suggesting pknbpxa may function ligand enable
the invasion p. knowlesi merozoites human cells.
