malaria present since ancient time remains major global health
problem developing countries. plasmodium falciparum belongs phylum
apicomplexan, largely contain disease-causing parasites characterized 
presence apicoplast. essential organelle p. falciparum
responsible synthesis key molecules required growth the
parasite. indispensable nature apicoplast makes potential drug target.
calcium signaling important establishment malaria parasite inside
the host. involved invasion egress merozoites the
asexual life cycle parasite. calcium signaling also regulates apicoplast
metabolism. therefore, review, focus role apicoplast in
malaria biology metabolic regulation ca++ signaling.
