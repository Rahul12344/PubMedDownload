pfemp1 variant parasite antigens inserted surface of
plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes (ie). interactions with
various host molecules, pfemp1 mediate ie sequestration tissues play key
role pathology severe malaria. pfemp1 encoded diverse
multi-gene family called var. previous studies shown expression of
specific subsets var genes associated low levels host immunity and
severe malaria. however, clinical studies date, full-length var gene
sequences unavailable various approaches used make
comparisons var gene expression profiles different parasite isolates
using limited information. several studies relied classification a
300 - 500 base-pair "dblα tag" region dblα domain located 5' end of
most var genes. assessed relationship various dblα tag
classification methods, sequence features fully assessable
through full-length var gene sequences. compared different sequence
features full-length var gene six fully sequenced laboratory isolates.
these comparisons show despite long history recombination,  dblα
sequence tag classification provide functional information important
features full-length var genes. notably, specific subset dblα tags
previously defined "group a-like" associated cidrα1 domains proposed
to bind endothelial protein c receptor. analysis helps bring together 
different sources data used assess var gene expression in
clinical parasite isolates.
