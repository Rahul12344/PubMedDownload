ookinetes, one motile invasive forms malaria parasite, rely 
gliding motility order establish infection mosquito host. we
characterize protein pbanka_0407300 conserved plasmodium
genus lacks significant similarity proteins eukaryotes. is
expressed gametocytes throughout invasive mosquito stages p.
berghei, absent asexual blood stages. mutants lacking protein
developed morphologically normal ookinetes devoid productive
motility although stretching movement could detected. therefore named 
the protein ookinete motility deficient (omd). several key factors known be
involved motility however normally expressed localized mutant.
importantly, mutant failed establish infection mosquito which
resulted total malaria transmission blockade.
