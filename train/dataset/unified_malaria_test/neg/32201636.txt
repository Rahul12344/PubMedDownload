malaria drug resistance global public health concern. though parasite
mutations associated resistance, factors could influence the
resistance. robust surveillance system required monitor help contain 
the resistance. study established role travel gender in
dispersion chloroquine resistant genotypes malaria epidemic zones kenya.
a total 1,776 individuals presenting uncomplicated malaria hospitals
selected four malaria transmission zones kenya 2008 2014 were
enrolled prospective surveillance study assessing epidemiology of
malaria drug resistance patterns. demographic clinical information per
individual obtained using structured questionnaire. further, 2 ml blood 
was collected malaria diagnosis, parasitemia quantification molecular
analysis. dna extracted dried blood spots collected the
individuals genotyped polymorphisms plasmodium falciparum chloroquine 
transporter gene (pfcrt 76), plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistant gene 1
(pfmdr1 86 pfmdr1 184) regions putative drug resistance genes using 
both conventional polymerase chain reaction (pcr) real-time pcr. the
molecular demographic data analyzed using stata version 13 (college
station, tx: statacorp lp) mapping cases selected geographic
zones done qgis version 2.18. chloroquine resistant (cqr) genotypes across
gender revealed association chloroquine resistance univariate
model (p = 0.027) multivariate model (p = 0.025), female reference
group models. prior treatment antimalarial drugs within last 6
weeks enrollment associated carriage cqr genotype by
multivariate model (p = 0.034). further, significant relationship observed 
between travel cqr carriage univariate model (p = 0.001) and
multivariate model (p = 0.002). findings suggest gender travel are
significantly associated chloroquine resistance. gender perspective, 
males likely harbor resistant strains females hence involved 
strain dispersion. hand, travel underscores role transport
network introducing spread resistant genotypes, bringing focus the
need monitor gene flow establish strategies minimize introduction
of resistance strains controlling malaria among frequent transporters.
