the endosymbiont wolbachia walbb induces refractoriness plasmodium falciparum 
in anopheles stephensi, primary mosquito vector human malaria the
middle east south asia. however, remains unknown whether such
refractoriness extended malaria species. particular, was
reported specific conditions, walbb enhance plasmodium
infection hosts. here, measured impact walbb rodent
malaria parasite plasmodium berghei a. stephensi comparing load of
oocysts sporozoites midguts salivary glands, respectively, between
walbb-infected -uninfected mosquitoes. investigate whether walbb modulated
mosquito immune defense parasites, compared expression the
immune genes, previously reported involve antimalarial response,
in midguts remaining carcass tissues mosquitoes. stable
association walbb a. stephensi resulted reduction parasites more
than half oocyst stage, 91.8% sporzoite stage. the
anti-plasmodium immune genes, including tep1, lrim1, toll pathway gene rel1 and
the effector defensin 1, induced walbb different mosquito body
tissues. findings suggest immune priming potential cause of
walbb-mediated antimalarial response a. stephensi. importantly, no
evidence found enhancement plasmodium infection a. stephensi
stably infected walbb. discuss findings possible
implementations wolbachia malaria control disease endemic areas.
