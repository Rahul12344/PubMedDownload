cd8(+) cells play pathogenic role development murine experimental
cerebral malaria (ecm) induced plasmodium berghei anka (pba) infection in
c57bl/6 mice. limited number cd8(+) epitopes described. here,
we report identification new epitope bergheilysin protein
recognized pba-specific cd8(+) cells. induction functionality these
specific cd8(+) cells investigated parallel previously reported
epitopes, using new tools tetramers reporter cell lines were
developed study. demonstrate cd8(+) cells diverse
specificities induced pba infection share many characteristics. they
express cytolytic markers (gamma interferon [ifn-γ], granzyme b) chemokine
receptors (cxcr3, ccr5) damage blood-brain barrier vivo. earlier
finding brain microvessels mice infected pba, with
non-ecm-causing strains, cross-presented shared epitope generalizable to
these additional epitopes. suppressing induction specific cd8(+) cells
through tolerization high-dose peptide injection unable confer
protection ecm, suggesting cd8(+) cells specificities
participate process. tools developed used further
investigate heterogeneity cd8(+) cell responses involved in
ecm.
