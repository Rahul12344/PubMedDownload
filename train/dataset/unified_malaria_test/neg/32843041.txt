background: histidine-rich protein-2 (hrp2)-based rapid diagnostic tests (rdts)
are rdts recommended malaria diagnosis uganda. however, the
emergence plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein 2 3 (pfhrp2 and
pfhrp3) gene deletions threatens usefulness malaria diagnostic and
surveillance tools. pfhrp2 pfhrp3 gene deletions surveillance was
conducted p. falciparum parasite populations uganda.
methods: three-hundred (n = 300) p. falciparum isolates collected from
cross-sectional malaria surveys symptomatic individuals 48 districts of
eastern western uganda analysed presence pfhrp2 pfhrp3
genes. presence parasite dna confirmed pcr amplification 18s
rrna gene, msp1 msp2 single copy genes. presence absence deletions 
confirmed amplification exon1 exon2 pfhrp2 pfhrp3 using gene
specific pcr.
results: overall, pfhrp2 pfhrp3 gene deletions detected 29/300 (9.7%,
95% ci 6.6-13.6%) parasite isolates. pfhrp2 gene deleted 10/300 (3.3%,
95% ci 1.6-6.0%) isolates, pfhrp3 9/300 (3.0%, 95% ci 1.4-5.6%) both
pfhrp2 pfhrp3 deleted 10/300 (3.3%, 95% ci 1.6-6.0%) parasite
isolates. proportion pfhrp2/3 deletions higher eastern 14.7% (95%
ci 9.7-20.0%) compared western region 3.1% (95% ci 0.8-7.7%), p = 0.001.
geographical location associated gene deletions aor 6.25 (2.02-23.55),
p = 0.003.
conclusions: first large-scale survey reporting presence of
pfhrp2/3 gene deletions p. falciparum isolates uganda. roll rdts for
malaria diagnosis take consideration existence pfhrp2/3 gene
deletions particularly areas detected. periodic pfhrp2/3
surveys recommended inform future decisions deployment alternative 
rdts.
