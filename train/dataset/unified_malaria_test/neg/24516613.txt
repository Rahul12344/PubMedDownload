in present study, novel adeno-associated virus (aav) vector-mediated gene
delivery approach taken improve reconstitution functional cd8(+) 
cells humanized mice, thereby mimicking human immune system (his). human
genes encoding hla-a2 selected human cytokines (a2/hucytokines) were
introduced immune-deficient mouse model [nod/scid/il2rÎ³(null) (nsg) mice]
using aav serotype 9 (aav9) vectors, followed transplantation human
hematopoietic stem cells. nsg mice transduced aav9 encoding a2/hucytokines
resulted higher levels reconstitution human cd45(+) cells compared to
nsg mice transduced aav9 encoding hla-a2 alone hla-a2-transgenic nsg
mice. furthermore, group mice also mounted highest level of
antigen-specific a2-restricted human cd8(+) t-cell response upon vaccination with
recombinant adenoviruses expressing human malaria hiv antigens. finally, 
human cd8(+) t-cell response induced human malaria vaccine-immunized mice 
was shown functional displaying cytotoxic activity hepatocytes
that express human malaria antigen context a2 molecules. taken
together, data show aav vector-mediated gene delivery simple and
efficient method transfer multiple human genes immune-deficient mice, thus 
facilitating successful reconstitution mice. mice generated 
this study ultimately allow us swiftly evaluate t-cell
immunogenicity various human vaccine candidates pre-clinical setting.
