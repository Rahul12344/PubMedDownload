testosterone (t) known induce persistent susceptibility plasmodium
chabaudi malaria. pathogens recognizing toll-like receptors (tlrs), though
potentially important malaria, yet examined their
t-sensitivity. here, investigate effects p. chabaudi mrna
expression promoter dna methylation tlr1-9 genes liver female
c57bl/6 mice. treated vehicle 3 weeks, treatment
is discontinued 12 weeks, challenging p. chabaudi 8 days. our
data reveal induces 9.1-fold downregulation tlr6 mrna 6.3-fold
upregulation tlr8 mrna. blood-stage infections induce significant increases in
mrna expression tlr1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 varying 2.5-fold 21-fold
in control mice. t-pretreated mice, tlr genes also significantly
responsive infections. however, malaria-induced upregulations the
relative mrna expressions tlr6 tlr8 5.6-fold higher 6.5-fold lower
in t-pretreated mice control mice. infections induce massive dna
down-methylation tlr6 gene promoter control mice, still more
pronounced t-pretreated mice, significant changes detectable for
the dna methylation status tlr8 promoter. data support view that
hepatic expression tlr6, tlr8 epigenetically controlled,
and dysregulations tlr6 tlr8 critically contribute t-induced
persistent susceptibility p. chabaudi malaria, possibly dys-balancing
responses tlr6-mediated pathogen recognition tlr8-mediated generation of
anti-malaria "protective" autoimmunity.
