the plasmodium falciparum malarial parasite genome appears encode one only
one phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (pi3k), sequence analysis suggests that
the enzyme "class iii"- "vps34"-type pi3k. pfvps34 generated
excitement possible druggable target potentially key target of
artemisinin-based antimalarials. study, optimize pfvps34 gene 
heterologous expression yeast, purify protein homogeneity, use a
recently validated quantitative assay phosphatidylinositol 3'-phosphate
production phosphatidylinositol ( hassett et al., companion paper; doi
10.1021/acs.biochem.7b00416 ) quantify activity drug inhibition that
activity, investigate importance key residues enzyme's
catalytic "n-lobe" domains. data suggest pfvps34 indeed inhibited 
artemisinin related drugs conditions cleave drugs'
endoperoxide bridge generate reactive alkylating agents.
