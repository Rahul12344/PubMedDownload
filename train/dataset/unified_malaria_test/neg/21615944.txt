background: plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte binding antigen-175 (eba-175)
is antigen considered one leading malaria vaccine candidates.
eba-175 mediates sialic acid-dependent binding glycophorin the
erythrocytes playing crucial role invasion p. falciparum the
host cell. dimorphic allele segments, termed c-fragment f-fragment, been
found high endemicity malaria areas associations dimorphism
and severe malaria described. study, genetic dimorphism 
eba-175 evaluated p. falciparum field isolates brazilian malaria
endemic area.
methods: study carried rural villages situated near porto velho,
rondonia state brazilian amazon three time points 1993 and
2008. allelic dimorphism eba-175 analysed nested pcr.
results: classical allelic dimorphism eba-175 identified the
studied area. overall, c-fragment amplified higher frequency than
f-fragment. observed three time points c-fragment was
observed higher frequency f-fragment. single infections (one fragment
amplified) frequent mixed infection (two fragments amplified).
conclusions: findings confirm dimorphism eba175, since two 
types fragments amplified, c-fragment f-fragment. also, results
show remarkable predominance camp allele studied area. the
comparative analysis three time points indicates allelic dimorphism
of eba-175 stable time.
