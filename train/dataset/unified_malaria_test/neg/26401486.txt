the intraerythrocytic malaria parasite, plasmodium falciparum, maintains low
cytosolic na(+) concentration plasma membrane p-type cation translocating
atpase 'pfatp4' implicated playing key role process. pfatp4
has subject significant attention recent years mutations in
this protein confer resistance growing number new antimalarial compounds,
including spiroindolones, pyrazoles, dihydroisoquinolones, a
number antimalarial agents medicines malaria venture's 'malaria
box'. exposure parasites compounds rapid disruption 
cytosolic na(+). whether, how, chemically distinct compounds
interact pfatp4, interactions lead parasite death, not
yet clear. fact multiple different chemical classes converged upon 
pfatp4 highlights significance potential target new generation
antimalarial agents. spiroindolone (kae609, known cipargamin) has
progressed phase iia clinical trials favourable results. in
this review consider physiological role pfatp4, summarise current
repertoire antimalarial compounds pfatp4 implicated their
mechanism action, provide outlook translation target
identification laboratory patient treatment field.
