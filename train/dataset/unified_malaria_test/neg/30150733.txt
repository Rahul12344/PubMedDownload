intraerythrocytic malaria parasites reside within parasitophorous vacuolar
membrane (pvm) generated host cell invasion1. erythrocyte remodelling 
parasite metabolism require export effector proteins transport of
small molecules across barrier parasite surface host cell
cytosol2,3. protein export across pvm accomplished plasmodium
translocon exported proteins (ptex) consisting three core proteins, the
aaa+ atpase hsp101 two additional proteins known ptex150 exp24.
inactivation hsp101 ptex150 arrests protein export across pvm5,6, 
the contribution exp2 parasite biology well understood7. nutrient 
permeable channel pvm also characterized electrophysiologically, 
but molecular identity unknown8,9. here, using regulated gene expression, 
mutagenesis cell-attached patch-clamp measurements, show exp2, the
putative membrane-spanning channel ptex4,10-14, serves dual roles a
protein-conducting channel context ptex channel able to
facilitate nutrient passage across pvm independent hsp101. data
suggest dual functionality channel operating endogenous context.
