the malaria parasite hijacks host erythrocytes shield immune
system proliferate. red blood cell abnormalities provide protection 
malaria impeding parasite invasion growth within cell by
compromising ability parasites avoid host clearance. here, describe 
2 n-ethyl-n-nitrosourea-induced mouse lines, sptbmri26194 sptbmri53426 ,
containing single-point mutations erythrocyte membrane skeleton gene, β
spectrin (sptb), exhibit microcytosis retain relatively normal ratio 
of erythrocyte surface area volume highly resistant rodent malaria.
we propose major factor responsible malaria protection specific
clearance mutant erythrocytes, although enhanced clearance uninfected
mutant erythrocytes also observed (ie, bystander effect). using in
vivo erythrocyte tracking assay, established phenomenon occurs
irrespective host environment, precluding involvement nonerythrocytic
cells resistance mechanism. furthermore, recapitulated phenotype
by disrupting interaction ankyrin-1 β spectrin vivo using
crispr/cas9 genome editing technology, thereby genetically validating potential
antimalarial target. study sheds new light role β spectrin 
plasmodium infection highlights changes erythrocyte cytoskeleton
can substantially influence malaria susceptibility minimal adverse
consequences host.
