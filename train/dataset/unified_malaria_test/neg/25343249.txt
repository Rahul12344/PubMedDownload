chloroquine cheap, extremely effective drug plasmodium falciparum
until resistance arose. one approach reversing resistance inhibition of
chloroquine efflux site action, parasite digestive vacuole.
chloroquine accumulation studies traditionally relied radiolabelled
chloroquine, poses several challenges. need development a
safe biologically relevant substitute. report a
commercially-available green fluorescent chloroquine-bodipy conjugate,
lynxtag-cqgreen, proxy chloroquine accumulation. compound localized
to digestive vacuole parasite observed confocal microscopy,
and inhibited growth chloroquine-sensitive strain 3d7 extensively in
the resistant strains 7g8 k1. microplate reader measurements indicated
suppression lynxtag-cqgreen efflux pretreatment parasites known 
reversal agents. microsomes carrying either sensitive- resistant-type pfcrt
were assayed uptake; resistant-type pfcrt exhibited increased accumulation of
lynxtag-cqgreen, suppressed pretreatment known
chemosensitizers. eight laboratory strains twelve clinical isolates were
sequenced pfcrt pgh1 haplotypes previously reported contribute drug
resistance, pfmdr1 copy number chloroquine ic50s determined. these
data compared lynxtag-cqgreen uptake/fluorescence multiple linear
regression identify genetic correlates uptake. uptake compound
correlated logic50 chloroquine and, weakly, mutation pgh1, 
f1226y.
