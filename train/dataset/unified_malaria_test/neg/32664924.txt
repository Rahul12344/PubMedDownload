background: plasmodium vivax predominant plasmodium species in
afghanistan. national guidelines recommend combination chloroquine and
primaquine (cq-pq) radical treatment p. vivax malaria. artesunate in
combination antifolates sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) been
first-line treatment uncomplicated falciparum malaria 2016. although sp
has recommended treatment falciparum vivax malaria, exposure
of p. vivax parasite population sp might still quite extensive
because community based management malaria. change p. vivax
antifolate resistance markers 2007 2017 investigated.
methods: dried blood spots collected (n = 185) confirmed p. vivax
patients five malaria-endemic areas afghanistan bordering tajikistan,
turkmenistan pakistan, including takhar, faryab, laghman, nangarhar, and
kunar, 2007, 2010 2017. semi-nested pcr, rflp nucleotide sequencing
were used assess pyrimethamine resistant related mutations p. vivax
dihydrofolate reductase (pvdhfr i13l, p33l, n50i, f57l, s58r, t61i, s93h, s117n, 
i173l) sulfonamide resistance related mutations p. vivax
dihydropteroate synthase (pvdhps a383g, a553g).
results: 185 samples genotyped pvdhfr pvdhps mutations, 11
distinct haplotypes observed, evolved time. 2007, wild type
pvdhfr pvdhps frequent haplotype study sites (81%,
80/99). however, 2017, frequency wild-type reduced 36%,
(21/58; p value ≤ 0.001), increase frequency double mutant
pvdhfr pvdhps haplotype s58rs117n (21%, 12/58), single pvdhfr mutant 
haplotype s117n (14%, 8/58). triple quadruple mutations found. in
addition, pvdhfr mutations position n50i (7%, 13/185) novel mutation
s93h (6%, 11/185) observed. based silico protein modelling and
molecular docking, pvdhfr n50i mutation expected affect moderately
pyrimethamine binding, whereas s93h mutation not.
conclusions: course ten years, strong increase 
frequency pyrimethamine resistance related mutations pvdhfr p. vivax
population afghanistan, although triple quadruple mutations conferring
high grade resistance observed. suggests relatively low drug
pressure sp p. vivax parasite population study areas. the
impact two newly identified mutations pvdhfr gene pyrimethamine
resistance needs investigation.
