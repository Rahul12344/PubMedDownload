increased numbers regulatory cells (tregs), key mediators immune
homeostasis, reported human murine malaria current opinion 
that cells play role balancing protective immunity pathogenesis
during infection. however, mechanisms governing expansion during
malaria infection completely defined. article show that
soluble extracts plasmodium falciparum (pfses), equivalent preparation
of uninfected erythrocytes, induce differentiation polyclonally activated 
cd4(+) cells tregs endowed strong suppressive activity. pfses activate
latent tgfβ bound membrane treg cells, thus allowing cytokine
interaction tgfβ receptor, inducing foxp3 gene expression tgfβ
production. activation membrane-bound latent tgfβ pfses is
significantly reduced broad-spectrum metalloproteinases inhibitor with
zn(++) -chelating activity, completely inhibited combined action of
such inhibitor antibodies p. falciparum thrombospondin-related adhesive 
protein (pftrap). conclude pf-zn(++) -dependent proteinases and, a
lesser extent, pftrap molecules involved activation latent tgfβ
bound membrane activated treg cells suggest that, malaria
infection, mechanism could contribute expansion tregs with
different antigen specificity.
