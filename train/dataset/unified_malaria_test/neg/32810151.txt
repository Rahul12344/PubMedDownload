presently, principal tools combat malaria restricted killing the
parasite infected people killing mosquito vector thwart
transmission. successful, approaches losing effectiveness view
of parasite resistance drugs mosquito resistance insecticides. clearly,
new approaches fight deadly disease need developed. recently, one
such approach-engineering mosquito resident bacteria secrete anti-parasite
compounds-has proven laboratory highly effective. however,
implementation strategy requires approval regulators involves 
introduction recombinant bacteria field. frequent argument by
regulators something unexpectedly goes wrong release, must
be recall mechanism. report addresses concern. previously have
shown serratia bacterium isolated mosquito ovary able spread 
through mosquito populations amenable engineered secrete
anti-plasmodial compounds. introduced plasmid bacterium 
carries fluorescent protein gene show cultured laboratory,
the plasmid completely lost 130 bacterial generations. importantly,
when bacteria introduced mosquitoes, bacteria were
transmitted one generation next, plasmid lost three
mosquito generations, rendering bacteria non-recombinant (wild type).
furthermore, evidence obtained horizontal transfer plasmid to
other bacteria either culture mosquito. prior release, is
imperative demonstrate genes thwart parasite development 
mosquito safe environment. report describes methodology to
safely achieve goal, utilizing transient expression plasmid is
gradually lost, returning bacterium wild type status.
