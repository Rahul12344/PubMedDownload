background: malaria parasites actively proliferate body their
vertebrate insect hosts, subjected toxic effects reactive
oxygen species. antioxidant defenses malaria parasites considered to
play essential roles survival thus considered promising targets 
for intervention. sought identify cellular function thioredoxin
peroxidase-2 (tpx-2), expressed mitochondria, disrupting the
tpx-2 gene (pbtpx-2) rodent malaria parasite plasmodium berghei.
findings: three independent experiments, two disruptant populations (tpx-2 ko)
and three wild-type parasite populations pyrimethamine resistance
(dhfr-ts/mt dhfr-ts locus) intact pbtpx-2 (tpx-2 wt) obtained and
cloned. null expression tpx-2 ko population confirmed rt-pcr and
western blot analyses. tpx-2 ko parasite developed normally mouse
erythrocytes multiplied rate similar tpx-2 wt parasite
during experimental period. peak period gametocytemia delayed 1
day tpx-2 ko compared tpx-2 wt parent parasite,
however, highest gametocyte number comparable. number midgut
oocysts tpx-2 ko 14 days post feeding comparable the
tpx-2 wt.
conclusions: present finding suggests mitochondrial prx tpx-2 not
essential asexual insect stage development malaria parasite.
