development subunit vaccine targeting liver-stage plasmodium parasites
requires identification antigens capable inducing protective cell
responses. however, traditional methods antigen identification incapable
of evaluating cell responses large numbers proteins expressed by
these parasites. bottleneck limited development subunit vaccines
against plasmodium complex intracellular pathogens. address this
bottleneck, developing synthetic minigene technology multi-antigen
dna vaccines. initial test approach, pools long (150 bp)
antigen-encoding oligonucleotides synthesized recombined vectors by
ligation-independent cloning produce two dna minigene library vaccines. each
vaccine encoded peptides derived 36 (vaccine 1) 53 (vaccine 2) secreted 
or transmembrane pre-erythrocytic p. yoelii proteins. balb/cj mice were
vaccinated three times single vaccine biolistic particle delivery (gene
gun) screened interferon-γ-producing cell responses elispot. library
vaccination induced responses four novel antigens. naïve mice exposed 
radiation-attenuated sporozoites mounted response one four 
novel targets (pymdh, malate dehydrogenase). response pymdh could be
recalled additional homologous sporozoite immunizations could partially
recalled heterologous cross-species sporozoite exposure. vaccination against
the dominant pymdh epitope dna priming recombinant listeria boosting did
not protect sporozoite challenge. improvements library design and
delivery, combined methods promoting increase screening sensitivity,
may enable complex minigene screening serve high-throughput system for
discovery novel cell antigens.
