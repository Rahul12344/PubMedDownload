background: studies east african coast shown recent dramatic
decline malaria vector density change composition sibling species of
the anopheles gambiae complex, paralleled major decline malaria
incidence. order better understand ongoing changes vector-parasite
dynamics area, allow appropriate adjustment control
activities, present study examined composition, malaria lymphatic
filarial infection, sibling species anopheles funestus group. similar
to an. gambiae complex, an. funestus group contains important vectors 
both malaria lymphatic filariasis.
methods: archived (from 2005-2012) newly collected (from 2014) specimens of
the an. funestus group collected indoors using cdc light traps villages in
northeastern tanzania analysed. identified sibling species by
pcr based amplification species-specific nucleotide sequence its2
region rdna genes. specimens furthermore examined infection 
plasmodium falciparum wuchereria bancrofti pcr.
results: identified sibling species an. funestus s.s., anopheles
parensis, anopheles rivulorum, anopheles leesoni, first far
the common (overall 94.4%). comparing archived specimens 2005-2007
to 2008-2012, small statistically significant decrease in
proportion an. funestus s.s. noted, otherwise observed temporal
changes sibling species composition minor. p. falciparum detected 
in archived specimens, 8.3% newly collected an. funestus s.s. were
positive parasite. overall w. bancrofti infection rate decreased
from 14.8% 2005-2007 archived specimens 0.5% newly
collected specimens, overall 93.3% infections an. funestus
s.s.
conclusion: study indicated composition an. funestus group
had remained rather stable study period, an. funestus s.s. 
the predominant. study also showed increasing p. falciparum infection
and decreasing w. bancrofti infection an. funestus s.s. study period,
most likely reflecting infection levels parasites human
population area.
