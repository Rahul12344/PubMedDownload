in rwanda, frequent mutations pfdhfr pfdhps genes plasmodium
falciparum suggested intense sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance. however, 
data pfmdr1 available might important context the
first-line treatment artemether-lumefantrine. survey among 749
children five years age southern highland rwanda, 104 p. falciparum
isolates obtained. parasite polymorphisms associated drug sensitivity
were typed including genes pfdhfr, pfdhps, pfmdr1, pfcrt. plasma
concentrations chloroquine pyrimethamine measured elisa. treatment
with artemether-lumefantrine within preceding two weeks stated 12.5%
of respondents; chloroquine plasma detected 17.6%, pyrimethamine in
none. isolates pfdhfr triple pfdhps double/triple mutations occurred 
75% 93%, respectively; 69% isolates comprised pfdhfr/pfdhps quintuple 
or sextuple mutations associated high-grade sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
resistance. pfdhfr l164 absent. pfmdr1 pattern revealed 50% 
the f184 polymorphism almost 40% n86-f184-d1246 allele combination
known selected infections reappearing following artemether-lumefantrine 
treatment. molecular markers demonstrate intense antifolate drug resistance p.
falciparum southern rwanda. present, first-time data pfmdr1 alleles
from rwanda reveal pattern might reflect predominance wild types for
some alleles or, alternatively, substantial artemether-lumefantrine pressure on
the local parasite population.
