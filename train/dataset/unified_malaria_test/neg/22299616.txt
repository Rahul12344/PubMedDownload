background: establishing antibody correlates protection malaria in
human field studies clinical trials requires, amongst others, accurate
estimation antibody levels. polymorphic antigens apical membrane
antigen 1 (ama1), may confounded occurrence large number of
allelic variants nature.
methods: test hypothesis, plasma antibody levels age-stratified
cohort naturally exposed children malaria-endemic area southern
ghana determined indirect elisa. titres four single pfama1
alleles compared three different allele mixtures presumed
to wider repertoire epitope specificities. associations antibody
levels incidence clinical malaria well previous exposure
to parasites also examined.
results: antibody titres pfama1 alleles generally increased with
age/exposure antibody specificity pfama1 variants decreased, implying
that younger children (â‰¤ 5 years) elicit strain-specific antibody response
compared older children. antibody titre measurements fvo 3d7
ama1 alleles gave best titre estimates varied least pair-wise
comparisons titres pfama1 allele mixtures. no
association antibody levels capture antigen either
clinical malaria incidence parasite density.
conclusions: current data shows levels naturally acquired
antigen-specific antibodies, especially infants young children, are
dependent antigenic allele used measurement. may relevant to
the interpretation antibody titre data measurements single pfama1
alleles, especially studies involving infants young children have
experienced fewer infections.
