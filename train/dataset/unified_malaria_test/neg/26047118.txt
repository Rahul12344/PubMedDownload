4,4'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (ddt) re-recommended world
health organization malaria mosquito control. previous ddt use resulted
in resistance, continued use resistance increase terms level 
and extent. drosophila melanogaster model dipteran many available
genetic tools, numerous studies done insecticide resistance mechanisms, is
related malaria mosquitoes allowing extrapolation. 91-r strain of
d. melanogaster highly resistant ddt (>1500-fold), however, no
mechanistic scheme accounts level resistance. recently, reduced 
penetration, increased detoxification, direct excretion identified 
as resistance mechanisms 91-r strain. interactions, however, remain 
unclear. use uas-rnai transgenic lines d. melanogaster allowed the
targeted knockdown genes putatively involved ddt resistance has
validated role several cuticular proteins (cyp4g1 lcp1), cytochrome
p450 monooxygenases (cyp6g1 cyp12d1), atp binding cassette transporters
(mdr50, mdr65, mrp1) involved ddt resistance. further, increased
sensitivity ddt 91-r strain intra-abdominal dsrna injection for
mdr50, mdr65, mrp1 determined ddt contact bioassay, directly
implicating genes ddt efflux resistance.
