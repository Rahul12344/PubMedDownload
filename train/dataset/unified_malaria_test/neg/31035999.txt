background: high proportion human cases due simian malaria parasite
plasmodium knowlesi malaysia cause concern, severe 
even fatal. merozoite surface protein 7 (msp7) multigene family forms 
a non-covalent complex msp-1 prior receptor-ligand recognition in
plasmodium falciparum thus important antigen vaccine development.
however, study done ortholog family members p.
knowlesi clinical samples. study investigates level of
polymorphism, haplotypes, natural selection acting pkmsp-7d gene in
clinical samples malaysia.
methods: thirty-six full-length pkmsp7d gene sequences (along reference 
h-strain: pknh_1266000) obtained from clinical isolates malaysia, which were
orthologous pvmsp7h (pvx_082680) downloaded from public databases.
population genetic, evolutionary phylogenetic analyses performed to
determine level genetic diversity, polymorphism, recombination natural
selection.
results: analysis 36 full-length pkmsp7d sequences identified 147 snps (91
non-synonymous 56 synonymous substitutions). nucleotide diversity across 
full-length gene higher ortholog plasmodium vivax (msp7h).
region-wise analysis gene indicated nucleotide diversity the
central region high (π = 0.14) compared 5' 3' regions. most
hyper-variable snps detected central domain. multiple test for
natural selection indicated central region strong positive natural 
selection however, 5' 3' regions negative/purifying selection.
evidence intragenic recombination detected central region the
gene. phylogenetic analysis using full-length msp7d genes indicated 
geographical clustering parasite population.
conclusions: high genetic diversity hyper-variable snps strong evidence 
of positive natural selection central region msp7d indicated exposure
of region host immune pressure. negative selection 5' 3'
regions msp7d might functional constraints unexposed
regions merozoite invasion process p. knowlesi. evidence of
geographical clustering among clinical isolates malaysia indicated
uniform selection pressure populations. findings highlight the
further evaluation regions functional characterization protein 
as potential blood stage vaccine candidate p. knowlesi.
