cystic echinococcosis (ce) caused larval stage echinococcus granulosus 
sensu lato (s.l.) one important zoonotic parasitic diseases
worldwide 10 genotypes (g1-g10) reported. china, almost 
epidemiological genotyping studies e. granulosus s.l. west
and northwest pasturing areas. however, heilongjiang province northeastern 
china, molecular information available e. granulosus s.l. understand 
and speculate possible transmission patterns e. granulosus s.l., we
molecularly identified genotyped 10 hydatid cysts hepatic ce patients in
heilongjiang province based mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit i
(cox1), cytochrome b (cytb) nadh dehydrogenase subunit 1 (nad1) genes. two
genotypes identified, g1 genotype (n = 6) g7 genotype (n = 4). the
six g1 genotype isolates identical cox1 locus; three
and two different sequences obtained cytb nad1 loci,
respectively, two cytb gene sequences described previously. g7
genotype isolates identical cox1, cytb nad1 loci;
however, cytb gene sequence described previously. first
report g7 genotype humans china. three new cytb gene sequences g1
and g7 genotypes might reflect endemic genetic characterizations. pigs might be
the main intermediate hosts g7 genotype investigated area homology
analysis. results aid making effective control strategies for
the prevention transmission e. granulosus s.l.
