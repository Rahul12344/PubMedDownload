background: micrornas (mirnas) highly abundant class small noncoding
regulatory rnas post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression in
multicellular organisms. mirnas involved wide range biological and
physiological processes, including regulation host immune responses to
microbial infections. small-scale studies mirna expression malaria
mosquito anopheles gambiae reported, however comprehensive analysis 
of mirnas performed far.
results: using small rna sequencing, characterized de novo a. gambiae mirna
repertoire expressed adult sugar- blood-fed females. provided
transcriptional evidences 123 mirnas, including 58 newly identified mirnas.
out newly described mirnas, 19 mirnas homologs known mirnas in
other insect species 17 mirnas share sequence similarity restricted the
seed sequence. remaining 21 novel mirnas displayed obvious sequence
homology known mirnas. detailed bioinformatics analysis mature mirnas
revealed sequence variation occurring 5'-end leading functional
seed shifting 5% mirnas. also detected significant sequence
heterogeneity 3'-ends mature mirnas, mostly due imprecise
processing post-transcriptional modifications. comparative analysis of
arm-switching events revealed existence species-specific production of
dominant mature mirnas induced blood feeding mosquitoes. also identified
new conserved fragmented mirna clusters a. gambiae-specific mirna gene
duplication. using mirna expression profiling, identified differentially
expressed mirnas early time point regular blood feeding after
infection rodent malaria parasite plasmodium berghei. significant
changes detected expression levels 4 mirnas blood-fed
mosquitoes, whereas 6 mirnas significantly upregulated p. berghei
infection.
conclusions: current study, performed first systematic analysis 
mirnas a. gambiae. provided new insights mature mirna sequence diversity
and functional shifts mosquito mirna evolution. identified set the
differentially expressed mirnas respond normal infectious blood
meals. extended set anopheles mirnas isoforms provides basis
for experimental studies mirna expression patterns biological
functions a. gambiae.
