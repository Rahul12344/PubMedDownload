malaria widespread life-threatening disease tropical subtropical 
regions. patients typical clinical symptoms, malaria considered a
preliminary diagnosis travel history malaria-endemic areas. 
basis laboratory diagnosis malaria microscopic examination of
giemsa stained smears. hand, diagnosis differentiation of
plasmodium species microscopic examination may difficulties. in
the first case, adifferent appearance classical plasmodium vivax
erythrocytic forms infected erythrocytes detected 1% all
erythrocytes thin smear blood preparations 26-year-old male with
complaints fever chills story travel nigeria. observed 
that parasitic nuclei prominent, located cytoplasm
irregularly chromatin dye particles, nucleus fragments similar to
schüffner's granules form scattered granular spots present 
some erythrocytes, cytoplasm plasmodium erythrocytic forms were
irregular nuclei seen. schüffner's granules 
the infected erythrocytes. p.vivax detected rapid diagnostic test
(optimal, diamed gmbh, switzerland), searches antigens of
plasmodium species, peripheral blood sample patients. p.vivax
18s rrna gene also detected multiplex real-time polymerase chain
reaction. antibodies plasmodium species searched using pan
malaria antibody celisa (cellabs pty ltd, brookvale, australia) kit the
patient's serum sample optical density (od) value patient sample
was measured five times od value positive control. second case,
adifferent appearance classical p.falciparum erythrocytic forms in
infected erythrocytes detected 12% erythrocytes thin smear
blood preparations 31-year-old male suffering persistent
fever, severe headache, pain eyes known working nigeria. 
it observed plasmodium trophozoites 1/3 size of
erythrocytes p.vivax non-granular cytoplasm, erythrocytic
forms round nucleus cytoplasm hardly distinguished, of
them seen crescent close nucleus cytoplasm some
erythrocytic forms characteristically single nucleus scattered
cytoplasm, similar mature trophozoites p.vivax. although plasmodium
young trophozoites similar p.vivax means magnitude, forms in
which nuclei adhered erythrocyte wall common. no
p.falciparum gametocyte forms. p.falciparum like young trophozoite was
observedonly one four smears. p.falciparum detected the
commercial rapid diagnostic test p.falciparum 18s rrna gene also detected
by multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. antibody formation 
plasmodium species detected elisa test. case reports, the
importance support rapid diagnostic tests, serological molecular
methods microscopic diagnosis species determination two imported
malaria cases demonstrated.
