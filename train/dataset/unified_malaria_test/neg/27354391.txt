most severe plasmodium falciparum infections experienced young children.
severe symptoms precipitated vascular sequestration parasites
expressing particular subset polymorphic p. falciparum erythrocyte
membrane protein 1 (pfemp1) adhesion molecules. parasites binding human
endothelial protein c receptor (epcr) cidrα1 domain certain pfemp1
were recently associated severe malaria children. however, has
remained unclear extend epcr-binding cidrα1 domains epitomize pfemp1
expressed severe malaria. here, characterized near full-length
transcripts dominating var transcriptome children severe malaria 
found common feature encoded pfemp1 cidrα1 domains. such
genes highly dominantly expressed children severe malarial 
anaemia cerebral malaria. observations support hypothesis 
cidrα1-epcr interaction key pathogenesis severe malaria and
strengthen rationale pursuing vaccine adjunctive treatment aiming at
inhibiting reducing damaging effects interaction.
