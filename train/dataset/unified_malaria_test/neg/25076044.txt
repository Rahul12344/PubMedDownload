there growing concern inside outside scientific community 
the lack reproducibility experiments. depth detail reported
methods critical reproducibility findings, also making it
possible compare integrate data different studies. study, 
evaluated detail methods reporting comprehensive set of
trypanosomiasis experiments enable valid reproduction, integration
and comparison research findings. evaluated subset parasitic
(leishmania, toxoplasma, plasmodium, trichuris schistosoma) non-parasitic
(mycobacterium) experimental infections order compare quality method
reporting generally. systematic review using pubmed (2000-2012) all
publications describing gene expression cells animals infected with
trypanosoma spp undertaken based prisma guidelines; 23 papers were
identified included. defined checklist essential parameters that
should reported scored number parameters are
reported publication. bibliometric parameters (impact factor, citations 
and h-index) used look association journal author status 
and quality method reporting. trichuriasis experiments achieved the
highest scores included paper score 100% criteria. the
mean scores achieved trypanosoma articles checklist 65.5%
(range 32-90%). bibliometric parameters correlated quality of
method reporting (spearman's rank correlation coefficient <-0.5; p>0.05). our
results indicate quality methods reporting experimental
parasitology cause concern improved time, despite
there evidence assessed parameters influence the
results. propose set parameters used guidelines improve
the quality reporting experimental infection models pre-requisite 
for integrating comparing sets data.
