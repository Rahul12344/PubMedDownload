integrative omics analysis. study based plasmodium falciparum mrna and
protein data.

tomescu oa, mattanovich d, thallinger gg.

background: technological improvements shifted focus data
generation data analysis. availability large amounts data from
transcriptomics, protemics metabolomics experiments raise new questions
concerning suitable integrative analysis methods. compare three integrative
analysis techniques (co-inertia analysis, generalized singular value
decomposition integrative biclustering) applying gene protein 
abundance data six life cycle stages plasmodium falciparum.
co-inertia analysis analysis method used visualize explore gene 
protein data. generalized singular value decomposition shown its
potential analysis two transcriptome data sets. integrative
biclustering applies biclustering gene protein data.
results: using cia, visualize six life cycle stages plasmodium
falciparum, well go terms 2d plane interpret spatial
configuration. gsvd, decompose transcriptomic proteomic data sets
into matrices biologically meaningful interpretations explore the
processes captured data sets. ibc identifies groups genes, proteins, go
terms life cycle stages plasmodium falciparum. show method-specific
results well network view life cycle stages based results
common three methods. additionally, combining results three 
methods, create three-fold validated network life cycle stage specific go
terms: sporozoites associated transcription transport; merozoites
with entry host cell well biosynthetic metabolic processes; rings 
with oxidation-reduction processes; trophozoites glycolysis energy
production; schizonts antigenic variation immune response; gametocyctes 
with dna packaging mitochondrial transport. furthermore, network
connectivity underlines separation intraerythrocytic cycle the
gametocyte sporozoite stages.
conclusion: using integrative analysis techniques, integrate knowledge
from different levels obtain wider view system study. the
overlap method-specific common results considerable, even the
basic mathematical assumptions different. three-fold validated
network life cycle stage characteristics plasmodium falciparum could
identify large amount known associations literature one
study.
