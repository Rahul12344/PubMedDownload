background: eukaryotic organisms, packaging dna nucleosomes controls
gene expression regulating access promoter transcription factors.
the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum encodes relatively few
transcription factors, extensive nucleosome remodeling occurs its
replicative cycle red blood cells. observations point towards an
important role nucleosome landscape regulating gene expression.
however, relation nucleosome positioning transcriptional activity
has thus far explored detail parasite.
results: here, analyzed nucleosome positioning asexual sexual
stages parasite's erythrocytic cycle using chromatin immunoprecipitation
of mnase-digested chromatin, followed next-generation sequencing. observed 
a relatively open chromatin structure trophozoite gametocyte stages,
consistent high levels transcriptional activity stages.
nucleosome occupancy genes promoter regions subsequently compared 
steady-state mrna expression levels. transcript abundance showed strong inverse
correlation nucleosome occupancy levels promoter regions. addition,
at-repeat sequences strongly unfavorable nucleosome binding p.
falciparum, overrepresented promoters highly expressed genes.
conclusions: connection chromatin structure gene expression p.
falciparum shares similarities eukaryotes. however, remarkable
nucleosome dynamics erythrocytic stages absence large
variety transcription factors may indicate nucleosome binding and
remodeling critical regulators transcript levels. moreover, strong
dependency chromatin structure dna sequence suggests p.
falciparum genome may shaped nucleosome binding preferences.
nucleosome remodeling mechanisms deadly parasite could thus provide
potent novel anti-malarial targets.
