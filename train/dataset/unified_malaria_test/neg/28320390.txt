background: rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) histidine rich protein 2 (hrp2) are
often used determine whether persons fever treated with
anti-malarials. however, plasmodium falciparum parasites deletion the
hrp2 gene yield false-negative rdts concerns sensitivity of
hrp2-based rdts may fall intensity transmission decreases.
methods: observational study enrolled 9226 patients three health centres 
in rwanda april 2014 april 2015. compared sensitivity rdts
based hrp2 plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pldh) microscopy
(thick smears) diagnosis malaria. pcr used determine whether
deletions histidine-rich central repeat region hrp2 gene (exon 2)
were associated false-negative hrp2-based rdts.
results: comparison microscopy, sensitivity specificity hrp2-
and pldh-based rdts 89.5 86.2% 80.2 94.3%, respectively. when
the results rdts combined, sensitivity rose 91.8% and
specificity 85.7%. additionally, smear positivity fell 46 3%,
the sensitivity hrp2-based rdt fell 88 67%. 370 samples with
false-negative hrp2 rdt results pcr performed, 140 (38%) were
identified p. falciparum pcr. isolates identified p. falciparum
by pcr, 32 (23%) negative hrp2 gene based pcr. 32 p.
falciparum isolates negative hrp2 pcr, 17 (53%) positive based the
pldh rdt.
conclusion: prospective study rdt performance coincided decline in
the intensity malaria transmission kibirizi (fall slide positivity 
46 3%). decline associated decrease hrp2 rdt sensitivity
(from 88 67%). p. falciparum isolates without hrp2 gene an
important cause false-negative hrp2-based rdts, identified the
pldh-based rdt. although recommend use combined hrp2/pldh
testing sub-saharan africa, results suggest combination
hrp2/pldh-based rdts could reduce impact false-negative hrp2-based rdts
for detection symptomatic p. falciparum malaria.
