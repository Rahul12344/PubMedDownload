insects fight infection using variety signaling pathways immune effector
proteins. drosophila melanogaster, three members nimrod gene family
(draper, nimc1 eater) bind bacteria, binding leads phagocytosis
by hemocytes. nimrod gene family since identified insects, 
but function non-drosophilids remains unknown. purpose study
was identify members nimrod gene family malaria mosquito,
anopheles gambiae, assess role immunity. identified and
sequenced three members gene family, herein named draper, nimrod and
eater, orthologs d. melanogaster draper, nimb2 eater,
respectively. three genes preferentially expressed hemocytes their
peak developmental expression pupae young adults. infection induces the
transcriptional upregulation three genes, magnitude this
upregulation becomes attenuated mosquitoes become older. rnai-based
knockdown eater, draper nimrod, decreased mosquito's ability to
kill escherichia coli hemocoel. knockdown draper, eater, any
combination nimrod family genes rendered mosquitoes likely die from
staphylococcus epidermidis. finally, knockdown nimrod family genes not
impact mrna levels antimicrobial peptides defensin (def1), cecropin (ceca)
or gambicin (gam1), eater knockdown led decrease mrna levels of
nitric oxide synthase. together, data show members a. gambiae
nimrod gene family positive regulators mosquito antibacterial
response.
