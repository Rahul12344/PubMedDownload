the mortality caused plasmodium falciparum reduced artemisinin (art)
and art combination therapy (act). however, artemisinin resistance (art-r) emerge
during 2008 cambodia spread greater mekong subregion (gms). art-r was
confirmed spread india, gateway whole africa. whole genome
sequencing approach p. falciparum assumed k13 gene encoded kelch protein
was discovered associated art-r. single nucleotide
polymorphisms (snps) k13 gene, c580y mutant commonly dominant cambodia,
myanmar, thailand, laos vietnam assumed one strong molecular
markers art-r p. falciparum isolates gms. literatures published between
2017 2018 reviewed work. f446i observed doubtful
molecular marker art-r marker. transgenic experiment showed parasite with
f446i mutation displayed prolonged clearance respond art c580y was
applied positive control mutant. furthermore, study c580y allele four
countries cambodia, thailand, laos resulted single origin whereas parasite
with allele showed multi-origin three provinces vietnam. as
artemisinin short acting drug, role long acting partner drug was
studied using transgenic c580y mutant c580 leave recrudescent p.
falciparum. recently, treatment failure act countries in
gms. review, importance c580y mutation study art-r was
discussed.
