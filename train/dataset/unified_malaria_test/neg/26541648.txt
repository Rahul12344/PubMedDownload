the spread plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance highlights urgency
to discover new targets chemical scaffolds. unfortunately, lack of
experimentally validated functional information p. falciparum genes
remains strategic hurdle. chemogenomic profiling established tool for
classification drugs similar mechanisms action comparing drug
fitness profiles collection mutants. inferences drug mechanisms of
action targets obtained associations shifts drug fitness
and specific genetic changes mutants. screen, p. falciparum,
piggybac single insertion mutants profiled altered responses to
antimalarial drugs metabolic inhibitors create chemogenomic profiles.
drugs targeting pathway shared similar response profiles multiple
pairwise correlations chemogenomic profiles revealed novel insights into
drugs' mechanisms action. mutant artemisinin resistance candidate
gene - "k13-propeller" gene (pf3d7_1343700) exhibited increased susceptibility to
artemisinin drugs identified cluster 7 mutants based similar enhanced
responses drugs tested. approach chemogenomic profiling reveals
artemisinin functional activity, linked unexpected drug-gene relationships
of mutants, signal transduction cell cycle regulation pathways.
