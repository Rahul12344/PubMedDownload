background: recent times, plasmodium vivax (p. vivax) become serious
threat public health due ability cause severe infection fatal
outcomes. unique biology makes resilient control measures are
otherwise effective p. falciparum. deeper understanding p. vivax
biology pathogenesis is, therefore, essential developing right
control strategies. proteomics p. falciparum helpful studying
disease biology elucidating molecular mechanisms involved development 
of disease. however, unlike p. falciparum, proteomics data p. vivax infection
is minimal due absence continuous culture system. dependence on
clinical samples animal models drastically limited p. vivax research,
creating critical knowledge gaps understanding disease. study 
describes in-depth proteomics analysis p. vivax-infected human plasma and
parasite isolates, understand parasite biology, pathogenesis, identify 
new diagnostic targets p. vivax malaria.
methods: mass-spectrometry- (ms) based proteomics approach (q exactive) was
applied analyze human plasma parasite isolates vivax malaria patients
visiting primary health centre india. additionally, targeted proteomics
assay standardized validating unique peptides recurring parasite 
proteins.
results: thirty-eight p. vivax proteins detected human plasma high
confidence. several glycolytic enzymes found along hypothetical,
cytoskeletal, ribosomal, nuclear proteins. additionally, 103 highly abundant 
p. vivax proteins detected parasite isolates. represents highest
number parasite proteins reported clinical samples far.
interestingly, five these; three plasmodium exported proteins (pvx_003545,
pvx_003555 pvx_121935), hypothetical protein (pvx_083555) pvstp1
(subtelomeric transmembrane protein 1, pvx_094303) found plasma 
parasite isolates.
conclusions: parasite proteomics investigation essential understand
disease pathobiology design novel interventions. control strategies against
p. vivax also depend early diagnosis. work provides deeper insights 
the biology p. vivax identifying proteins expressed parasite 
its complex life-cycle within human host. study also reports antigens
that may explored diagnostic candidates.
