the antimalarial drug artemisinin natural product produced plant
artemisia annua. extracts a. annua used chinese herbal medicine
for two millennia. following re-discovery a. annua extract an
effective antimalarial, isolation structural elucidation of
artemisinin active agent, recommended first-line treatment
for uncomplicated malaria combination another effective antimalarial drug
(artemisinin combination therapy) world health organization (who) 2002.
following recommendation, availability price artemisinin
fluctuated greatly, ranging supply shortfalls years oversupply in
others. alleviate supply price issues, second source of
artemisinin sought, resulting effort produce artemisinic acid, a
late-stage chemical precursor artemisinin, yeast fermentation, followed 
chemical conversion artemisinin (i.e., semi-synthesis). engineering enable 
production artemisinic acid yeast relied discovery a. annua genes
encoding artemisinic acid biosynthetic enzymes, synthetic biology engineer
yeast metabolism. progress effort, resulted semi-synthetic
artemisinin entering commercial production 2013, reviewed emphasis 
on recent publications opportunities development. aspects both
the biology artemisinin production a. annua, yeast strain engineering
are discussed, recent developments chemical conversion of
artemisinic acid artemisinin.
