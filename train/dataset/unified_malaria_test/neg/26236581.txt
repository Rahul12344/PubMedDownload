artemether-lumefantrine (al) became first-line treatment uncomplicated
malaria kenya 2006. studies shown al selects snps pfcrt and
pfmdr1 genes recurring parasites compared baseline infections. the
genotypes associated al selection k76 pfcrt n86, 184f d1246
in pfmdr1. assess temporal change genotypes western kenya, 47 
parasite isolates collected (pre-act; 1995-2003) 745 (post-act; 
2008-2014) introduction al analyzed. addition, associations of
parasite haplotype ic50 artemether lumefantrine, clearance
rates determined. parasite genomic dna collected 1995 2014 was
analyzed sequencing pcr-based single-base extension sequenom massarray. 
ic50s determined subset samples. one hundred eighteen samples
from 2013 2014 efficacy trial 68 clearance
half-lives. data revealed significant differences pre-act 
post-act genotypes four codons (chi-square analysis; p < 0.0001). the
prevalence pfcrt k76 n86 increased 6.4% 1995-1996 93.2% 2014
and 0.0% 2002-2003 92.4% 2014 respectively. analysis parasites
carrying pure alleles k + nfd t + yyy haplotypes revealed 100.0% of
the pre-act parasites carried t + yyy 99.3% post-act parasites carried
k + nfd. significant correlation (p = 0.04) lumefantrine ic50
and polymorphism pfmdr1 codon 184. difference parasite
clearance half-lives based genetic haplotype profiles. study shows 
is significant change parasite genotype, key molecular determinants 
al selection almost reaching saturation. implications findings are
not clear since al remains highly efficacious. however, need closely 
monitor parasite genotypic, phenotypic clinical dynamics response to
continued use al western kenya.
