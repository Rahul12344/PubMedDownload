novel synthetic endoperoxides evaluated new components of
artemisinin combination therapies (acts) treat artemisinin-resistant
plasmodium falciparum malaria. conducted blinded ex vivo activity testing of
fully synthetic (oz78 oz277) semisynthetic (artemisone, artemiside,
artesunate, dihydroartemisinin) endoperoxides histidine-rich protein 2
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 200 p. falciparum isolates areas
of artemisinin-resistant malaria western northern cambodia 2009 and
2010. order potency geometric mean (gm) 50% inhibitory concentrations 
(ic50s) follows: artemisone (2.40 nm) > artesunate (8.49 nm) >
dihydroartemisinin (11.26 nm) > artemiside (15.28 nm) > oz277 (31.25 nm) > oz78
(755.27 nm). ex vivo activities test endoperoxides positively correlated 
dihydroartemisinin artesunate. isolates 2-fold less susceptible
to dihydroartemisinin artemisinin-sensitive p. falciparum w2 clone and
showed sensitivity comparable test endoperoxides artesunate,
with isolate/w2 ic50 susceptibility ratios <2.0. isolates p.
falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter mutations, negative
correlations sensitivity endoperoxides chloroquine. activities of
endoperoxides (artesunate, dihydroartemisinin, oz277, artemisone)
significantly correlated act partner drug, mefloquine. isolates 
had mutations associated clinical resistance mefloquine, 35%
prevalence p. falciparum multidrug resistance gene 1 (pfmdr1) amplification
and 84.5% occurrence pfmdr1 y184f mutation. gm ic50s mefloquine,
lumefantrine, endoperoxides (artesunate, dihydroartemisinin, oz277, oz78, and
artemisone) correlated pfmdr1 copy number. given current acts are
failing potentially reduced sensitivity artemisinins partner drugs,
newly identified mutations associated artemisinin resistance reported the
literature pfmdr1 mutations examined combined
contributions emerging act resistance.
