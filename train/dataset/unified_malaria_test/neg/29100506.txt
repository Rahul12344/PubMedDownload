background: plasmodium vivax prevalent human malaria parasite 
likely increase proportionally malaria control efforts rapidly impact 
the prevalence plasmodium falciparum. despite prominence p. vivax 
major human pathogen, vivax malaria qualifies neglected under-studied
tropical disease. significant challenges bringing p. vivax laboratory,
particularly capacity long-term propagation well-characterized
strains, limited study parasite's red blood cell (rbc) invasion 
mechanism, blood-stage development, gene expression, genetic manipulation.
methods results: patient isolates p. vivax collected and
cryopreserved rural community ampasimpotsy, located the
tsiroanomandidy health district madagascar. periodic, monthly overland
transport cryopreserved isolates country's national malaria
control programme laboratory antananarivo preceded onward sample transfer to
laboratories case western reserve university, usa. there, p. vivax
isolates cultured propagation rbcs saimiri
boliviensis. four patient isolates studied to-date, median time
interval sample collection vitro culture 454 days (range 
166-961 days). median time culture, continually documented light
microscopy, 159 days; isolate amp2014.01 continuously propagated for
233 days. studies show p. vivax parasites propagated saimiri 
rbcs retain ability invade human rbcs, cryopreserved, thawed 
and successfully returned productive vitro culture.
conclusions/significance: long-term culture p. vivax possible rbcs
of saimiri boliviensis. studies provide alternative propagation p.
vivax live animals becoming restricted. vitro culture p.
vivax saimiri rbcs provides opening stabilize patient isolates, which
would serve precious resources apply new strategies investigating the
molecular cellular biology important malaria parasite.
