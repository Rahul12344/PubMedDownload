network analysis transcriptional signature typically relies direct
interaction two highly expressed genes. however, approach misses
indirect biological relevant interactions third factor (hub). 
we determine whether hub-based network analysis select improved
signature subset correlates biological change stronger manner
than original signature. previously reported interferon-related
transcriptional signature (thp1r2mtb-induced) mycobacterium tuberculosis (m.
tb)-infected thp-1 human macrophage. selected hub-connected thp1r2mtb-induced 
genes refined network signature tmtb-inet grouped excluded genes
into excluded signature tmtb-iex. tmtb-inet retained enrichment of
binding sites interferon-related transcription factors contained
relatively interferon-related interacting genes compared to
thp1r2mtb-induced signature. tmtb-inet correlated strongly as
thp1r2mtb-induced signature public transcriptional dataset patients 
pulmonary tuberculosis (ptb). tmtb-inet correlated strongly cd4(+) and
cd8(+) cells ptb patients thp1r2mtb-induced signature tmtb-iex.
when tmtb-inet applied data clinical therapy tuberculosis, it
resulted pronounced response weakest correlation. correlation
on dataset patients aids malaria stronger tmtb-inet,
indicating involvement tmtb-inet chronic human infections.
collectively, significance work twofold: (1) disseminate a
hub-based approach generating biologically meaningful clinically useful 
signature; (2) using approach introduce new network-based signature and
demonstrate promising applications understanding host responses to
infections.
