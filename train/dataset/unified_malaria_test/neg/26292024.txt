plasmodium falciparum resistance artemisinin emerged greater mekong
subregion poses threat malaria control prevention. recent work
has identified mutations kelch propeller domain p. falciparum k13
gene associated artemisinin resistance defined delayed parasite
clearance ex vivo ring stage survival assays. species specific primers for
the two prevalent human malaria species, p. falciparum p. vivax, were
designed tested multiple parasite isolates including human, rodent, and
non- humans primate plasmodium species. new protocol described using the
species specific primers amplified respective species, p. falciparum
and p. vivax, cross react human malaria
plasmodium species. provide improved species specific pcr sequencing
protocol could effectively used areas p. falciparum p. 
vivax circulating. design improved protocol, kelch gene was
analyzed compared among different species plasmodium. kelch propeller 
domain found highly conserved across mammalian plasmodium species.
