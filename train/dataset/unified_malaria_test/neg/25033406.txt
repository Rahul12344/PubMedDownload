during experimental cerebral malaria (ecm) mice develop lethal
neuropathological syndrome associated microcirculatory dysfunction and
intravascular leukocyte sequestration. precise spatio-temporal context in
which intravascular immune response unfolds incompletely understood. we
developed 2-photon intravital microscopy (2p-ivm)-based brain-imaging model 
monitor real-time behaviour leukocytes directly within brain
vasculature ecm. ly6c(hi) monocytes, neutrophils, started to
accumulate blood vessels plasmodium berghei anka (pba)-infected
macgreen mice, myeloid cells express gfp, one two days prior the
onset neurological signs (ns). decrease rolling speed of
monocytes, measure endothelial cell activation, associated with
progressive worsening clinical symptoms. adoptive transfer experiments with
defined immune cell subsets recombinase activating gene (rag)-1-deficient mice
showed changes mediated plasmodium-specific cd8(+) t
lymphocytes. critical number cd8(+) effectors required induce
disease monocyte adherence vasculature. depletion monocytes 
onset disease symptoms resulted decreased lymphocyte accumulation,
suggesting reciprocal effects monocytes cells recruitment
within brain. together, studies define real-time kinetics of
leukocyte behaviour central nervous system ecm, reveal a
significant role plasmodium-specific cd8(+) lymphocytes regulating
vascular pathology disease.
