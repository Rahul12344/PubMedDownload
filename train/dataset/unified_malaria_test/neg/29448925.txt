background: insecticide resistance threatens effective vector control, especially
for mosquitoes malaria. manage resistance, recommended insecticide use
strategies include mixtures, sequences rotations. new insecticides 
developed opportunity develop use strategies limit the
evolution resistance short term. 2013 review modelling and
empirical studies resistance points advantages mixtures. however,
there limited recent, accessible modelling work addressing evolution of
resistance different operational strategies. opportunity to
improve level mechanistic understanding within operational community
of insecticide resistance expected evolve response different 
strategies. paper provides concise, accessible description flexible
model evolution insecticide resistance. model used develop 
mechanistic picture evolution insecticide resistance is
likely respond potential insecticide use strategies. aim reach an
audience unlikely read detailed modelling paper. model itself, as
described here, represents two independent genes coding resistance two
insecticides. allows representation use insecticides in
isolation, sequence mixtures.
results: model used demonstrate evolution resistance under
different scenarios fits intuitive reasoning selection
pressure. using insecticide mixture, relative alone, always prompts
slower evolution resistance insecticide. however, resistance to
both insecticides considered, resistance thresholds may reached later a
sequence relative mixture. increasing ability insecticides kill
susceptible mosquitoes (effectiveness), influence favouring a
mixture sequence one highly effective insecticide provides more
protection another mixture.
conclusions: model offers accessible description process of
insecticide resistance evolution likely respond insecticide
use. simple online user-interface allowing exploration also
provided. tools contribute improved discussion operational 
decisions insecticide resistance management.
