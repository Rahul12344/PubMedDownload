plasmodium knowlesi risen importance zoonotic parasite 
causing regular episodes malaria throughout south east asia. p. knowlesi
genome sequence generated 2008 highlighted confirmed many similarities and
differences plasmodium species, including global view several multigene
families, large sicavar multigene family encoding variant
antigens known schizont-infected cell agglutination proteins. however,
repetitive dna sequences bane genome project, other
plasmodium genome projects immune gaps, rearrangements and
other pitfalls created genomic features. today, long-read pacbio and
chromatin conformation technologies overcoming obstacles. here, based on
the use technologies, present highly refined de novo p. knowlesi
genome sequence pk1(a+) clone. sequence annotation, referred to
as 'mahpic pk genome sequence', includes manual annotation sicavar
gene family 136 full-length members categorized type ii. this
sequence provides framework permit better understanding the
sicavar repertoire, selective pressures acting gene family mechanisms
of antigenic variation species pathogens.
