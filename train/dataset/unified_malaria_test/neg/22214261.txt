background: massively parallel sequencing technology revolutionizing
approaches genomic genetic research. since advent, scale and
efficiency next-generation sequencing (ngs) rapidly improved. spite 
this success, sequencing genomes genomic regions extremely biased base
composition still great challenge currently available ngs platforms. 
the genomes important pathogenic organisms like plasmodium falciparum
(high content) mycobacterium tuberculosis (high gc content) display
extremes base composition. standard library preparation procedures that
employ pcr amplification shown cause uneven read coverage
particularly across gc rich regions, leading problems genome
assembly variation analyses. alternative library-preparation approaches 
omit pcr amplification require large quantities starting material hence
are suitable small amounts dna/rna clinical
isolates. developed optimized library-preparation procedures suitable
for low quantity starting material tolerant extremely high content
sequences.
results: used optimized conditions parallel standard methods 
to prepare illumina sequencing libraries non-clinical clinical
isolate (containing ~53% host contamination). analyzing comparing the
quality sequence data generated, show optimized conditions that
involve pcr additive (tmac), produces amplified libraries improved
coverage extremely at-rich regions reduced bias toward gc neutral
templates.
conclusion: developed robust optimized next-generation sequencing
library amplification method suitable extremely at-rich genomes. new
amplification conditions significantly reduce bias retain complexity of
either extremes base composition. development greatly benefit
sequencing clinical samples often require amplification due low mass of
dna starting material.
