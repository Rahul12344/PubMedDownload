at end 2016, kyrgyz republic certified world health
organization malaria-free country, decade ago disease
posed serious health threat. progress achieved kyrgyz republic provides 
a unique example tertian (plasmodium vivax) malaria elimination. success 
was based integrated approach, including measures treatment of
infected people disease prevention, vector control development 
effective national epidemiological surveillance system. lower p. vivax msp-1,
msp-3α, csp dbpii genes polymorphism revealed kyrgyz republic in
compare tajikistan. molecular characterization causative
agent found p. vivax populations kyrgyz republic comprised several
lineages, highly divergent south-western genetically homogeneous in
the northern regions kyrgyz republic, d. profile northern regions 
was compatible several recent introductions rather long-term endemic 
circulation parasite. low level genetic variability suggested that
the parasitic systems tertian malaria, adapted, which, along with
other factors, largely determined possibility malaria elimination in
northern kyrgyz republic. determinants included environmental, social, 
epidemiological factors limited spread malaria. south-western kyrgyz 
republic, region high level interstate migration, requires
considerable attention prevent spread malaria.
