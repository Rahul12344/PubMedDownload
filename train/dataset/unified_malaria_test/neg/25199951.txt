background: plasmodium vivax one widespread human malarial parasites
accounting 75% malaria epidemics. however, baseline
information status nature genetic variation plasmodium
species circulating various parts pakistan. present study aimed 
observing molecular epidemiology genetic variation plasmodium vivax by
analysing merozoite surface protein-3α (msp-3α) merozoite surface
protein-3β (msp-3β) genes, using suballele, species-specific, combined nested 
pcr/rflp detection techniques.
methods: total 230 blood samples suspected subjects tested slide
positive vivax malaria collected punjab, sindh, khyber pakhtunkhwa,
and balochistan period may 2012 december 2013. combined nested
pcr/rflp technique conducted using pvmsp-3α pvmsp-3β genetic markers to
detect extent genetic variation clinical isolates p. vivax the
studied areas pakistan.
results: pcr, p. vivax, 202/230 (87.82%), found widely distributed
in studied areas. pcr/rflp analysis showed high range allelic variations
for msp-3α msp-3β genetic markers p. vivax, i.e., 21 alleles for
msp-3α 19 msp-3β. statistically significant difference (p ≤ 0.05) was
observed genetic diversity suballelic variants msp-3α msp-3β
genes p. vivax.
conclusion: concluded p. vivax populations highly polymorphic 
diverse allelic variants pvmsp-3α pvmsp-3β present pakistan.
