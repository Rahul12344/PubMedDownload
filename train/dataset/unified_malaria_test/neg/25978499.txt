guyana suriname made important progress reducing burden of
malaria. countries use microscopy primary tool clinical
diagnosis, malaria rapid diagnostic tests (rdts) useful remote areas of
the interior laboratory support may limited unavailable. recent
reports indicate histidine-rich protein 2 (pfhrp2)-based diagnostic tests
specific detection p. falciparum may provide false negative results in
some parts south america due emergence p. falciparum parasites 
lack pfhrp2 gene, thus produce pfhrp2 antigen. pfhrp2 pfhrp3 genes
were amplified parasite isolates collected guyana suriname to
determine circulating isolates deletions genes.
pfhrp3 deletions monitored monoclonal antibodies utilized in
pfhrp2-based rdts cross-react pfhrp3 protein. found 97
isolates guyana met inclusion criteria pfhrp2- and
pfhrp3-positive. suriname (n = 78), 14% samples tested were
pfhrp2-negative 4% pfhrp3-negative. furthermore, analysis the
genomic region proximal pfhrp2 pfhrp3 revealed genomic deletions
extended flanking genes. also investigated population substructure 
of isolates collected determine parasites deletions of
pfhrp2 pfhrp3 belonged genetic subtypes. cluster analysis revealed
that predominant p. falciparum population substructure among the
isolates either country, indication genetic admixture among the
parasite populations. furthermore, pfhrp2-deleted parasites suriname did
not appear share single, unique genetic background.
