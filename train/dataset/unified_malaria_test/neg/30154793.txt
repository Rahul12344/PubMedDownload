cerebral malaria complex neurological syndrome caused infection with
plasmodium falciparum parasites exclusively attributed series of
host-parasite interactions pathological blood-stage infection. in
contrast, preceding intra-hepatic phase replication generally
considered clinically silent thereby excluded playing role the
development neurological symptoms. study, however, present an
antigen pbmals_05 presented host immune system both
pre-erythrocytic intra-erythrocytic stages contributes development
of cerebral malaria mice. although deletion endogenous pbmals_05
prevented development experimental cerebral malaria (ecm) susceptible
mice sporozoite infected red blood cell (irbc) infections, we
observed significant differences contribution host immune response
between modes inoculation. moreover, pbmals_05-specific cd8+ cells
contributed development ecm sporozoite irbc-infection,
suggesting pre-erythrocytic antigens like pbmals_05 also contribute to
the development cerebral symptoms. data thus highlight importance of
the natural route infection study ecm, potential implications
for vaccine therapeutic strategies malaria.
