although rts,s remains advanced malaria vaccine, factors influencing
differences vaccine immunogenicity efficacy individuals or
populations still poorly characterised. analyses genetic determinants 
of immunogenicity previously restricted relatively small sample
sizes individual trials. combine data six phase ii rts,s trials
and evaluate relationship hla allele groups rts,s-mediated
protection controlled human malaria infections (chmi), using multivariate
logistic linear regression. observed significant associations three
allele groups (hla-a∗01, hla-b∗08, hla-drb1∗15/∗16) protection, while
another three allele groups (hla-a∗03, hla-b∗53, hla-drb1∗07) were
significantly associated lack protection. noteworthy these
'protective' allele groups thought lower prevalence sub-saharan
african populations uk usa phase ii trials occurred.
taken together, analyses presented give indication hla genotype 
may influence rts,s-mediated protective efficacy malaria infection.
