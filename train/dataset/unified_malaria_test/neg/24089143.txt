malaria parasites replicate asexually within mammalian hosts haploid
cells subject dna damage immune response chemotherapeutic
agents significantly disrupt genomic integrity. examination the
annotated genome parasite plasmodium falciparum identified genes encoding 
core proteins required homologous recombination (hr) pathway for
repairing dna double-strand breaks (dsbs), surprisingly none the
components canonical non-homologous end joining (c-nhej) pathway were
identified. better understand malaria parasites repair dsbs maintain
genome integrity, modified yeast i-scei endonuclease system generate
inducible, site-specific dsbs within parasite's genome. analysis repaired 
genomic dna showed parasites possess typical hr pathway resulting 
gene conversion events well end joining (ej) pathway repair dsbs 
when homologous sequence available. products ej limited in
number identical products observed multiple independent experiments. 
the repair junctions frequently contained short insertions also found the
surrounding sequences, suggesting possibility templated repair process. 
we propose alternative end-joining pathway rather c-nhej, serves 
a primary method repairing dsbs malaria parasites.
