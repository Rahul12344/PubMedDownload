anemia primary clinical manifestation malarial infections is
responsible substantial rate morbidity. pathophysiology discussed 
till catalogued several causes malarial anemia among ineffective
erythropoiesis remarkable one occurs silently bone marrow. a
systematic literature search performed summarized information on
erythropoietic response upon malaria infection factors responsible for
the same. review summarizes clinical experimental studies on
patients, mouse models, vitro cell cultures reporting erythropoietic
changes upon malaria infection well factors accountable same.
inadequate erythropoietic response malaria infection may collective
effect various mediators generated host immune response well parasite
metabolites. interplay various modulators causing pathophysiology
needs explored further. globin gene expression profiling upon malaria
infection also looked abnormal production globin chains
could possible contributor ineffective erythropoiesis.
