background: haiti chloroquine (cq) widely used malaria treatment,
reports resistance scarce. however, recent identification cq resistance
genotypes one site suggestive emerging problem. additional studies
are needed evaluate genetic mutations associated cq resistance,
especially plasmodium falciparum multi-drug resistance-1 gene (pfmdr1)
while expanding already available information p. falciparum cq transporter
gene (pfcrt) haiti.
methods: blood samples collected whatman filter cards (fta) eight
clinics spread across haiti. following confirmation p. falciparum the
samples, pcr protocols used amplify regions pfmdr1and pfcrt codons 
interest, (86, 184, 1034, 1042, 1246) (72-76), respectively. sequencing
and site-specific restriction enzyme digestions used analyse dna
fragments presence single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) known to
confer resistance anti-malarial drugs.
results: p. falciparum infection confirmed in160 samples amplifying a
segment p. falciparum 18s small subunit ribosomal rna gene (pfssurrna).
the sequence pfmdr1 54 samples determined codons
86,184 codons 1034, 1042 1246. sequence differences nf54 
clone 3d7 found among 54 samples except codon 184, non-silent
mutation found samples predicted alter amino acid sequence
replacing tyrosine phenylalanine (y184f). altered sequence also
confirmed restriction enzyme digestion. sequence pfmdr1 codons 86,
184, 1034 1042 encoded nfsn haplotype. sequence pfcrt codons 72-76
from 79 samples determined found encode cvmnk, consistent cq
sensitive genotype.
conclusion: presence y184f mutation pfmdr1 p. falciparum
parasites haiti may implications resistance antimalarial drugs.
the absence mutation pfcrt codon 76 among 79 isolates tested suggests
that sensitivity cq haiti remains common. wide-spread screening the
pfmdr1 pfcrt especially among patients experiencing treatment failure may 
a useful tool early detection emergence antimalarial drug resistance
in haiti.
