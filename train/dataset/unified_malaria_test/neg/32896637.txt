malaria global socio-economic burden plasmodium vivax contributes
for 70-80 million cases annual basis worldwide 60-65% cases in
india. diversity observed highly polymorphic merozoite surface protein-3α
(msp-3α) encoded msp-3 gene family, used efficiently genotyping
of p. vivax infection. study aims correlate severity clinical
symptoms parasite load, genotype p. vivax multiplicity infection. 
based clinical symptoms classification, 31 (67.9%) 46 cases found 
to severe 15 (32.6%) non-severe correlation severity 
vivax infection parasite load observed. analysis msp3-α allele
genotype showed 31 severe cases, 19 (61.2%) single-clone
infection cases whereas 12 (38.7%) multi-clone infections. similarly, of
15 non-severe cases, 9 (60%) single clone 6 (40%) multi-clone
infections indicating absence correlation multiplicity of
infection disease severity. allele frequency observed 65.9%, 23.4%,
23.4%, 28.2% allele a, b, c d, respectively. important finding was
the greater distribution allele alleles b c, been
reported rare allele otherwise. further, 13 cases allele d, 76.9%
(10/13) cases severe. study showed absence correlation between
the severity clinical symptoms parasite load multiplicity of
infection time drives possibility severe vivax malarial
symptoms association persistence allele the
population. upon exploration lead development target in
detection severe cases malaria.
