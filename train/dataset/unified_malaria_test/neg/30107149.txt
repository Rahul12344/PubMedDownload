genomic sequencing avian haemosporidian parasites (haemosporida) been
challenging due excessive contamination host dna. study, we
developed cost-effective protocol obtain parasite sequences naturally
infected birds, based targeted sequence capture next generation
sequencing. genomic data haemoproteus tartakovskyi reference, we
successfully sequenced 1000 genes 15 selected samples
belonging nine different cytochrome b lineages, eight belong to
haemoproteus one plasmodium. targeted sequences enriched to
∼104-fold, mixed infections identified well proportions of
each mixed lineage. found total number reads proportions
of exons sequenced decreased parasite lineage became divergent from
the reference genome. samples, recovery sequences from
different exons varied function gc content exon. the
obtained sequences, detected within-lineage variation mitochondrial
and nuclear genes, may result local adaptation different host
species environmental conditions. targeted sequence capture protocol can
be applied broader range species open new door further
studies disease diagnostics comparative analysis haemosporidians
evolution.
