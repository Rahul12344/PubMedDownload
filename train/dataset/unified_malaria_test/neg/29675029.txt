artemisinin important drug malaria treatment, exclusively
produced artemisia annua. important dissect regulatory mechanism
of artemisinin biosynthesis diverse plant hormones transcription factors. 
our study shows ethylene, plant hormone accelerates flower leaf
senescence fruit ripening, suppressed expression genes encoding three 
key enzymes ads, dbr2, cyp71av1, positive regulator aaora involved in
artemisinin biosynthesis. isolated gene encoding
ethylene-insensitive3 (ein3), key transcription factor ethylene signaling
pathway, screening transcriptome genome database artemisia annua,
named aaein3. overexpressing aaein3 suppressed artemisinin biosynthesis, while
repressing expression rnai enhanced artemisinin biosynthesis in
artemisia annua, indicating aaein3 negatively regulates artemisinin biosynthesis.
further study showed downregulation artemisinin biosynthesis ethylene
required mediation aaein3. aaein3 could accelerate leaf senescence, and
leaf senescence attenuated expression ads, dbr2, cyp71av1, aaora 
are involved artemisinin biosynthesis. collectively, study demonstrated 
negative correlation ethylene signaling artemisinin biosynthesis,
which ascribed aaein3-induced senescence process leaves. work
provided novel knowledge regulatory network plant hormones for
artemisinin metabolic pathway.
