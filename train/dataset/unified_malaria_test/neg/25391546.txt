typhoid re-emerging biggest health threat third world countries. one
of major challenge false negative diagnosis using existing
immunodiagnostic methods due overlapping symptoms infections (like
brucellosis, malaria, hepatitis) mimic enteric fever (typhoid). surface
plasmon resonance (spr) based dna hybridisation biosensor fabricated 
generating self-assembled monolayer 5'-thiolated single-stranded dna (ssdna)
probe onto gold surface. highly specific dna probe selected from
conserved vi capsular antigen gene salmonella enterica serovars typhi. this
dna biosensor investigated label-free real-time monitoring of
salmonella. interestingly, 0.019 ng ml(-1) (2 fm) lowest detected
concentration pbs association (k a) dissociation (k d) rate constants
to k (m(-1) s(-1)) = 6.68 × 10(4) ± 2.3 k (s(-1)) = 5.6 × 10(-3) ±
0.01, respectively. biosensor successfully demonstrated distinguish
complementary, non-complementary one-base mismatch sequences reusability 
up 40 hybridisation cycles room temperature. successful results were
obtained hybridisation studies genomic dna isolated spiked urine
sample. performance characteristics biosensing device suggested further
scope fine-tune dna-based assays implied clinical, food and
environmental applications.
