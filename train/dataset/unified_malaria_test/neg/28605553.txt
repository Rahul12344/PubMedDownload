genetic factors associated susceptibility many infectious diseases
and may determinants clinical progression. gene copy number variation (cnv)
has shown associated phenotypes numerous diseases, including
malaria. quantified gene copy numbers pyruvate kinase, liver, red
blood cell (pklr) gene well fcγ receptor 2a fcγ receptor 2c
(fcgr2a, fcgr2c) fcγ receptor 3 (fcgr3) genes using real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (rt-qpcr) assays gabonese children severe (n = 
184) mild (n = 189) malaria healthy gabonese white individuals 
(n = 76 each). means pklr, fcgr2a, fcgr2c, fcgr3 copy numbers were
significantly higher among children severe malaria compared with
mild malaria (p < .002), indicating surplus copies genes is
significantly associated malaria severity. copy numbers fcgr2a and
fcgr2c genes significantly lower (p = .005) gabonese individuals compared
with white individuals. conclusion, cnv pklr, fcgr2a, fcgr2c, fcgr3
genes associated malaria severity, results provide evidence a
role cnv host responses malaria.
