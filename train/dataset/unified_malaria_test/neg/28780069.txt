insect serine proteases (sps) serine protease homologs (sphs) participate 
digestion, defense, development, physiological processes. in
mosquitoes, clip-domain sps sphs (i.e. clips) investigated for
possible roles antiparasitic responses. recent test aimed improving
quality gene models anopheles gambiae genome using rna-seq data, we
observed various discrepancies gene models agamp4.5 corresponding 
sequences selected modeled cufflinks, trinity bridger. 
report comparative analysis 337 sp-related proteins a. gambiae by
examining domain structures, sequence diversity, chromosomal locations, and
expression patterns. one hundred ten clips contain 1 5 clip domains in
addition protease domains (pds) non-catalytic, protease-like domains 
(plds). divided five subgroups: clipas (22) clip1-5-pld; clipbs
(29), clipcs (12) clipds (14) mainly clip-pd; clipes (33) a
domain structure pd/pld-pld-clip-pld0-1. expression clip genes in
group-1 generally low detected various tissue- stage-specific
rna-seq libraries, putative gps/gphs (i.e. single domain gut sps/sphs) in
group-2 highly expressed midgut, whole larva whole adult libraries. 
comparison, 46 sps, 26 sphs, 37 multi-domain sps/sphs (i.e. pd/pld-pld≥1) 
group-3 seem specifically expressed digestive tract. 16
sps 2 sph containing types putative regulatory domains (e.g. ldla,
cub, gd). 337 sp sph genes, 159 sorted 46 groups (2-8
members/group) based similar phylogenetic tree position, chromosomal location,
and expression profile. information analysis, including improved gene
models protein sequences, constitute solid foundation functional
analysis sp-related proteins a. gambiae.
