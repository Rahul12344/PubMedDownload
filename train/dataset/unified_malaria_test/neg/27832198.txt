southeast asia epicenter multidrug-resistant plasmodium falciparum
strains. selective pressures subcontinent recurrently produced
several allelic variants parasite drug resistance genes, including p.
falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt). despite significant
reductions deployment 4-aminoquinoline drug chloroquine (cq), which
selected mutant pfcrt alleles halted cq efficacy decades ago, the
parasite pfcrt locus continuously evolving. highlighted the
presence highly mutated allele, cam734 pfcrt, acquired the
singular ability confer parasite cq resistance without associated fitness
cost. here, used pfcrt-specific zinc-finger nucleases genetically dissect
this allele pathogenic setting asexual blood-stage infection.
comparative analysis drug resistance growth profiles recombinant
parasites express cam734 variants thereof, dd2 (the common southeast
asian variant), wild-type pfcrt, revealed previously unknown roles pfcrt
mutations modulating parasite susceptibility multiple antimalarial agents. 
these results generated gc03 strain, used multiple earlier pfcrt
studies, might differ natural isolates harboring allele. results
presented herein show cam734-mediated cq resistance dependent rare
a144f mutation observed beyond southeast asia, reveal
distinct impacts cam734-specific mutations cq resistance and
parasite growth rates. biochemical assays revealed broad impact mutant pfcrt
isoforms parasite metabolism, including nucleoside triphosphate levels,
hemoglobin catabolism disposition heme, well digestive vacuole
volume ph. results study provide new insights complex
molecular basis physiological impact pfcrt-mediated antimalarial drug
resistance, inform ongoing efforts characterize novel pfcrt alleles that
can undermine efficacy first-line antimalarial drug regimens.
