background: var genes human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum are
highly polymorphic loci coding erythrocyte membrane proteins 1 (pfemp1), 
which responsible cytoaherence p. falciparum infected red blood
cells human vasculature. cytoadhesion, coupled differential
expression var genes, contributes virulence allows parasite to
establish chronic infections evading detection host's immune system. 
although studying genetic diversity major focus recent work var
genes, little known gene family's origin evolutionary history.
results: using novel hidden markov model-based approach var sequences
assembled additional isolates species, able reveal elements of
both early evolution var genes well recent diversifying events. 
we compare sequences var gene dblα domains divergent isolates p.
falciparum (3d7 hb3), closely-related species, plasmodium reichenowi.
we find gene family equally large p. reichenowi p. falciparum 
-- minimum 51 var genes p. reichenowi genome (compared 61 
3d7 minimum 48 hb3). addition, able define large,
continuous blocks homologous sequence among p. falciparum p. reichenowi
var gene dblα domains. results reveal contemporary structure of
the var gene family present divergence p. falciparum p.
reichenowi, estimated 2.5 6 million years ago. also reveal
that recombination played important traceable role the
establishment, maintenance, diversity sequences.
conclusions: despite remarkable diversity rapid evolution found 
loci within among p. falciparum populations, basic structure these
domains gene family surprisingly old stable. revealing common
structure well conserved sequence among two species also implications
for developing new primate-parasite models studying pathology and
immunology falciparum malaria, studying population genetics var
genes associated virulence phenotypes.
