plasmodium vivax prevalent malarial species south america and
exerts substantial burden populations affects. control and
eventual elimination p. vivax global health priorities. genomic research
contributes objective improving understanding biology p.
vivax development new genetic markers used to
monitor efforts reduce malaria transmission. analyze whole-genome data
from eight field samples region cord√≥ba, colombia malaria is
endemic. find considerable genetic diversity within population, result 
that contrasts earlier studies suggesting p. vivax limited
diversity americas. also identify selective sweep around a
substitution known confer resistance sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp). 
is first observation selective sweep sp resistance species. 
these results indicate p. vivax exposed sp pressure even when
the drug use first line treatment patients afflicted this
parasite. identify multiple non-synonymous substitutions three genes 
known involved drug resistance plasmodium species. finally, we
found extensive microsatellite polymorphisms. using information developed
18 polymorphic easy score microsatellite loci used in
epidemiological investigations south america.
