background: control elimination plasmodium vivax require better
understanding transmission dynamics, application genotyping
and population genetics analyses. paper describes vivaxgen
(http://vivaxgen.menzies.edu.au), web-based platform developed to
support p. vivax short tandem repeat data sharing comparative analyses.
results: vivaxgen platform provides repository raw data generated by
capillary electrophoresis (fsa files), fragment analysis standardized
allele calling tools. query system platform enables users filter,
select differentiate samples alleles based specified criteria.
key population genetic analyses supported including measures population
differentiation (fst), expected heterozygosity (he), linkage disequilibrium
(ias), neighbor-joining analysis principal coordinate analysis. datasets 
also formatted exported application commonly used population
genetic software including genepop, arlequin structure. date, data 10
countries, including 5 publicly available data sets shared with
vivaxgen.
conclusions: vivaxgen well placed facilitate regional overviews p. vivax
transmission dynamics different endemic settings capable adapted for
similar genetic studies p. falciparum organisms.
