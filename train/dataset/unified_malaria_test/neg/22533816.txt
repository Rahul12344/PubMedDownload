background: plasmodium falciparum exports proteins remodel erythrocyte
membrane. one protein, called pf155/resa (resa1) contributes parasite
fitness, optimizing parasite survival febrile episodes. resa1 gene a
member small family comprising three highly related genes. preliminary
evidence led search clues indicating involvement resa2 protein in
the pathophysiology malaria. present study, cdna sequence resa2 gene
was obtained two different strains. proportion p. falciparum isolates
having non-stop t1526c mutation resa2 gene evaluated association
of genotype severity malaria investigated.
methods: resa2 cdnas two different strains (a patient isolate k1 culture
adapted strain) obtained rt-pcr dna sequencing performed to
confirm gene structure. proportion isolates t1526c mutation
was evaluated using pcr-rflp methodology groups severe malaria and
uncomplicated patients recruited 1991-1994 senegal 2009 benin.
results: unique orf internal translation stop found patient 
isolate (genbank access number : jn183870), k1 strain harboured the
t1526c mutation (genbank access number : jn183869) affects internal
stop codon restores full length coding sequence. 14% isolates
obtained senegal benin harboured mutant t1526c parasites. isolates 
had wild mutant resa alleles. analysis excluding mixed
isolates showed resa2 t1526c mutation found frequently in
severe malaria cases uncomplicated cases (p = 0.008). association 
the presence mutant allele parasitaemia >4% shown multivariate 
analysis (p = 0.03) group beninese children.
conclusions: t1526c mutant parasites theoretically ability give
rise full-length resa2 protein. study raises hypothesis the
resa2 protein could favour high-density infections. studies various
geographic settings probably including patients required to
replicate results answer questions raised results.
