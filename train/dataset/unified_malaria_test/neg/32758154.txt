background: familial distal renal tubular acidosis (drta) associated with
mutations solute carrier family 4 membrane -â€‰1 (slc4a1) gene could co-exist
with red cell membrane abnormality, southeast asian ovalocytosis (sao). although 
this association well described southeast asian countries, less
frequently found sri lanka.
case presentation: describe six patients drta co-existing sao.
all initially presented severe hypokalemia paralysis. they
presented within period six months teaching hospital anuradhapura,
sri lanka. metabolic acidosis indicated low serum bicarbonate. three
of underlying chronic kidney disease well. three
patients mixed high normal anion gap metabolic acidosis indicated low 
delta ratio. drta confirmed presence normal anion gap,
hyperchloraemia, high urine ph positive urine anion gap. examination blood
films revealed presence stomatocytes macro-ovalocytosis
compatible sao. relation complications drta, two patients had
medullary nephrocalcinosis. three patients biochemical evidence of
osteomalacia, two radiological evidence diffuse
osteosclerosis. one patient secondary hyperparathyroidism pathological 
fracture.
conclusions: erythrocyte sao exceptionally rigid abnormality is
said evolved protects plasmodium vivax malaria cerebral
malaria cause plasmodium falciparum. although two families sao was
described earlier, sao drta combination reported patient
from anuradhapura district. distal renal tubular acidosis, sao combination and
its related complications including nephrocalcinosis, chronic kidney disease 
metabolic bone disease described sri-lankan literature. case
series emphasize importance investigating recurrent/ chronic hypokalemia
to diagnose drta associations, early correction acidosis could
prevent development chronic kidney disease metabolic bone disease.
