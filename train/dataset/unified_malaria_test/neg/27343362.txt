since 2005, artesunate (as) plus sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (sp) combination has
been adopted first-line treatment uncomplicated malaria yemen in
response high level plasmodium falciparum resistance chloroquine
(cq). therefore, aim present study determine frequency
distribution molecular markers associated resistance cq plus sp
combination among p. falciparum isolates malaria-endemic area taiz
governorate, yemen. fifty p. falciparum isolates collected a
cross-sectional study mawza district, taiz, period october 2013 to
april 2014. isolates investigated drug resistance-associated
molecular markers five genes, including p. falciparum cq resistance
transporter (pfcrt) 76t p. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1) 86y 
markers resistance cq, mutations kelch 13 (k13) propeller domain for
resistance as, p. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) p.
falciparum dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps) genes resistance sp. nested
polymerase chain reaction used amplify target genes dna extracts the
isolates followed restriction fragment length polymorphism detecting 76t
and 86y mutations pfcrt pfmdr1, respectively, dna sequencing for
detecting mutations k13, pfdhfr pfdhps. investigated isolates from
mawza district harboring pfcrt 76t mutant pfmdr1 n86 wild-type
alleles. pfdhfr 51i/108n double mutant allele found 2.2% (1/45) the
isolates; however, mutations detected codons 436, 437, 540, 581 and
613 pfdhps. p. falciparum isolates successfully sequenced (n=47)
showed k13 y493, r539, i543 c580 wild-type alleles. conclusion, the
pfcrt 76t mutant allele fixed study area six years the
official withdrawal cq, possibly indicating over-the-counter availability 
and continued use self-medication study area. however, almost
predominant wild-type alleles genes associated resistance and
sp among p. falciparum isolates present study indicates sustained
efficacy currently adopted first-line treatment plus sp study
area.
