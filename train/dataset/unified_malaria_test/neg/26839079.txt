leishmania donovani major cause visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), now
recognized parasitic disease highest level mortality second
only malaria. human vaccine currently available. 36 kda l. donovani
nucleoside hydrolase (ldnh36) surface protein previously identified a
potential vaccine candidate antigen. present data expression of
ldnh36 pichia pastoris purification 20 l scale establish
suitability future pilot scale manufacturing. improve efficiency of
process development ensure reproducibility, 4 n-linked glycosylation sites
shown contribute heterogeneous high-mannose glycosylation mutated to
glutamine residues. mutant ldnh36 (ldnh36-dg2) expressed purified 
homogeneity. size exclusion chromatography light scattering demonstrated that
ldnh36-dg2 existed tetramer solution, similar wild-type
recombinant l. major nucleoside hydrolase. amino acid mutations affect
the tetrameric interface confirmed theoretical modeling, mutated
amino acids located outside major immunogenic domain. immunogenic
properties ldnh36-dg2 recombinant protein evaluated balb/c mice
using formulations included synthetic cpg oligodeoxynucleotide, together
with microparticle delivery platform (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)). mice
exhibited high levels igg1, igg2a, igg2b antibodies reactive 
both ldnh36-dg2 ldnh36 wild-type. point mutations affect the
hydrolase activity enzyme, igg antibodies elicited ldnh36-dg2 
shown inhibit hydrolase activity wild-type ldnh36. results
indicate ldnh36-dg2 expressed purified p. pastoris is
suitable scale-up, manufacturing, testing support future
first-in-humans phase 1 clinical trials.
