insects rely innate immune system defense pathogens, some
aspects hormonal control. provide direct experimental 
evidence showing juvenile hormone-binding protein (mjhbp) aedes
aegypti required regulation innate immune responses the
development mosquito blood cells (hemocytes). using mjhbp-deficient
mosquito line generated means crispr-cas9 gene editing technology we
uncovered mutant phenotype characterized immunosuppression humoral
and cellular levels, profoundly affected susceptibility bacterial
infection. bacteria-challenged mosquitoes exhibited significantly higher levels
of septicemia mortality relative wild type (wt) strain, delayed
expression antimicrobial peptides (amps), severe developmental dysregulation
of embryonic larval hemocytes (reduction total number hemocytes)
and increased differentiation granulocyte lineage. interestingly,
injection recombinant wild type mjhbp protein adult females three-days
before infection sufficient restore normal immune function. similarly,
injection mjhbp fourth-instar larvae fully restored normal larval/pupal
hemocyte populations emerging adults. importantly, recovery normal
immuno-activation hemocyte development requires capability mjhbp to
bind jh iii. results strongly suggest jh iii functions mosquito
immunity hemocyte development manner perhaps independent of
canonical jh signaling, given lack developmental reproductive
abnormalities. prominent role hemocytes regulators of
mosquito immunity, novel discovery may broader implications the
understanding vector endocrinology, hemocyte development, vector competence
and disease transmission.
