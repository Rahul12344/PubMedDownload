background: malaria parasites form intracellular membranes separate the
parasite internal space erythrocytes, membrane proteins 
parasites exported host via membrane. previous study,
plasmodium vivax early transcribed membrane protein (pvetramp) 11.2, an
intracellular membrane protein highly expressed blood-stage parasites,
was characterized highly immunogenic protein p. vivax malaria patients.
however, pvetramp family proteins yet investigated. in
this study, pvetramps expressed evaluated determine their
immunological profiles.
methods: protein structure amino acid alignment carried using
bioinformatics analysis software. total six pvetramp family proteins were
successfully expressed purified using wheat germ cell free protein
expression system purified proteins used protein microarray 
immunization mice. localization protein determined serum
against pvetramp4. igg subclasses assessed immunized mice.
results: silico analysis showed p. vivax exhibits nine genes encoding the
etramp family. etramp family proteins relatively small molecules with
conserved structural features. total 6 recombinant etramp proteins were
successfully expressed purified. serum positivity p. vivax malaria
patients healthy individuals evaluated using protein microarray method.
among pvetramps, etramp4 showed highest positivity rate 62%,
comparable pvetramp11.2, served positive control, a
typical export pattern pvetramp4 observed p. vivax parasite. the
assessment igg subclasses mice immunized pvetramp4 showed high levels 
of igg1 igg2b. pvetramp family proteins identified characterized 
serological markers.
conclusions: relatively high antibody responses pvetramp4 well the
specific igg subclasses observed immunized mice suggest etramp family
is immunogenic pathogens used protein marker vaccine
development.
