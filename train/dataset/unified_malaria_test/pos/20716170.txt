aims: pathological neuroprotective mechanisms brain severe malaria
may arise microvascular obstruction malaria-parasitized erythrocytes.
this study aimed investigate role hypoxia induction vascular
endothelial growth factor (vegf) pathway neuropathophysiology severe
malaria.
methods results: immunohistochemistry performed post mortem brain
tissue sections 20 cases severe malaria examined expression
of transcriptional regulators vegf [hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha
(hif-1alpha), hif-2alpha], dec-1, vegf, vegf receptors 1 2, the
activated, phosphorylated vegf receptor 2 (pkdr). hifs showed limited protein
expression and/or translocation cell nuclei severe malaria, dec-1,
which stable regulated hif-1alpha, observed. was
heterogeneous expression vegf receptors severe malaria and
non-malarial disease controls. pkdr expression vessels greater malaria 
cases controls correlate parasite sequestration. vegf
uptake malaria parasites observed.
conclusions: vegf receptor expression levels severe malaria reflect 
non-specific response severe systemic disease. potential manipulation of
events vasculature parasite requires investigation.
