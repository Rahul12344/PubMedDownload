the following bovine (bo) human (hu) cytokines--bo rtnf-a, bo rifn-g, hu
ifn-a, hu ril-1, hu ril-2--significantly inhibited vitro development of
trophozoite-infected cells three stocks theileria annulata theileria
parva (muguga). however, none cytokines inhibited proliferation of
established t. annulata t. parva macroschizont-infected cell lines. indeed, bo
rtnf-a hu ril-2 consistently enhanced proliferation of
macroschizont-infected cell lines species blastogenesis of
uninfected lymphocytes trophozoite-infected cultures. results suggest
that cytokines could help resistance challenge infections preventing the
further development trophozoite-infected cells provide evidence that
any cytokines directly help resolve primary infections by
inhibiting growth macroschizont-infected cells. findings also
suggest tnf-a il-2 could play role pathogenesis of
theileria infections promoting proliferation macroschizont-infected
cells associated lymphoid hyperplasia.
