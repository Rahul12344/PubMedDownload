high uniform fluid shear stress (fss) atheroprotective preserves the
endothelial phenotype function activation downstream mediators
such mapk7 (erk5). endothelial cells respond fss thanks to
mechanotransduction. however, resulting signaling integrated and
resolved epigenetic level remains elusive. hypothesized polycomb
methyltransferase ezh2 involved effects fss human endothelial
cells. showed fss decreases expression polycomb
methyltransferase ezh2. despite simultaneous activation mapk7, mapk7 pathway
does directly influence transcription ezh2. interestingly though, 
knockdown ezh2 activates protective mapk7 signaling endothelial cells, 
even absence fss. understand influence fss-decreased
expression ezh2 endothelial transcriptome, performed rna-seq and
differential gene expression analysis. identified candidate groups genes
dependent ezh2 fss. among those, gene ontology overrepresentation
analysis revealed highly significant enrichment cell cycle-related genes, 
suggesting changes proliferation. indeed, depletion ezh2 strongly
inhibited endothelial proliferation, indicating cell cycle arrest. the
concomitant decrease ccna expression suggests transition endothelial
cells quiescent phenotype. bioinformatical analysis suggested
txnip possible mediator ezh2 cell cycle-related gene network.
our data show ezh2 fss-responsive gene. decreased ezh2 levels enhance
the activation atheroprotective mapk7 signaling. decrease ezh2 under
fss mediates decrease expression network cell cycle-related 
genes, allows cells enter quiescence. ezh2 therefore important
for protective effects fss endothelium.
