fatal murine cerebral malaria known induce cellular degeneration by
altering cellular morphology integrity cell. morphology integrity 
of cell mainly depends cytoskeletal network cell. increased
proteolysis cytoskeletal proteins accompanied aggravated suicidal proteases
activation leads cellular degeneration. present study, investigated 
the roles apoptotic necrotic cell death proteases, caspase-3, calpain-1
and cathepsin-b proteolysis neuronal cytoskeletal proteins mouse
model fatal cerebral malaria. found increased levels calpain-1,
cathepsin-b caspase-3, extensive cross talks suicidal
proteases. increased levels proteases correlated enhanced
proteolysis several cytoskeletal proteins including neuronal cytoskeleton
proteolytic signature fragments. further, also observed increased levels 
of proteases correlated appearance neuronal death that
exhibited apo-necrotic continuum. results confirm activation multiple
suicidal proteases, cross talks breakdown cytoskeletal proteins 
increase neuronal degeneration lead exacerbation cerebral malaria
pathology.
