background: antibodies protect plasmodium falciparum (pf) malaria
are acquired years repeated infections. b cell biology that
underlies observation poorly understood. previously reported that
"atypical" memory b cells increased children adults exposed intense
pf transmission mali, similar observed individuals
infected hiv. study examined b cell subsets pf -infected
adults peru mali determine pf transmission intensity correlates with
atypical memory b cell expansion.
methodology/principal findings: cross-sectional study venous blood was
collected adults areas zero (u.s., n = 10), low (peru, n = 18) and
high (mali, n = 12) pf transmission. adults peru mali infected with
pf time blood collection. thawed lymphocytes analyzed flow
cytometry quantify b cell subsets, including atypical memory b cells, defined 
by cell surface markers cd19(+) cd20(+) cd21(-) cd27(-) cd10(-). peru, the
mean level atypical memory b cells, percent total b cells, higher 
than u.s. adults (peru mean: 5.4% [95% ci: 3.61-7.28]; u.s. mean: 1.4% [95% ci:
0.92-1.81]; p<0.0001) lower malian adults (mali mean 13.1% [95% ci:
10.68-15.57]; p = 0.0001). peru, individuals self-reporting ≥1 prior malaria
episodes higher percentage atypical memory b cells compared those
reporting prior episodes (≥1 prior episodes mean: 6.6% [95% ci: 4.09-9.11]; no
prior episodes mean: 3.1% [95% ci: 1.52-4.73]; p = 0.028).
conclusions/significance: compared pf-naive controls, atypical memory b cells 
were increased peruvian adults exposed low pf transmission, further
increased malian adults exposed intense pf transmission. understanding 
origin, function antigen specificity atypical memory b cells the
context pf infection could contribute understanding of
naturally-acquired malaria immunity.
