introduction: endemic burkitt's lymphoma (ebl) associated epstein-barr
virus repeated malaria infections. defining feature ebl the
translocation c-myc oncogene control immunoglobulin
promoter. activation-induced cytidine deaminase (aid) shown be
critical translocation. malaria infection induces aid germinal center
b cells, whether malaria infection broadly affects aid activation in
extrafollicular b cells unknown.
methods: either stimulated purified b cells aid-green fluorescence
protein (gfp) reporter mice infected aid-gfp mice plasmodium chabaudi,
aid fluorescence monitored b cell subsets flow cytometry.
results: vitro analysis b cells mice revealed cpg (a
toll-like receptor 9 ligand) potent inducer aid mature and
immature b cell subsets. infection aid-gfp mice plasmodium chabaudi
demonstrated aid expression occurs transitional marginal zone b cells
during acute malaria infection. transitional b cells also capable of
differentiating antibody secreting cells stimulated vitro cpg
when isolated p. chabaudi-infected mouse.
conclusions: data suggest p. chabaudi capable inducing aid
expression b cell subsets participate germinal center
reaction, suggesting alternative role malaria etiology ebl.
