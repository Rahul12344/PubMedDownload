ischaemic neuropathological changes associated cytauxzoon felis infection in
cats reported recently. paper describes associated glial
changes evidence apoptosis brain cats infected naturally by
c. felis. sections brain eight affected cats eight age- and
sex-matched control cats evaluated immunohistochemistry expression of
glial fibrillary acidic protein, cd18 cleaved caspase-3. vascular changes 
the leptomeninges parenchyma, number positive astrocytes and
phagocytic cells (microglia macrophages) average astrocytic
cytoplasmic area number length astrocytic processes quantified,
and mean value grey white matter groups generated.
astrocytic hyperplasia (astrogliosis) phagocytic cell hyperplasia were
detected affected cats. immunoexpression cleaved caspase-3 detected
in intravascular perivascular macrophages leptomeninges and, less
often, grey white matter affected cats. four cats with
encephalomalacia additional cytoplasmic immunolabelling phagocytic cells
around necrotic foci macrophages cell debris within areas of
necrosis. results support role extensive reaction brain
tissue hypoxia-ischaemia potential role apoptosis the
neuropathogenesis c. felis infection cats.
