the liver stage malaria, caused genus plasmodium, clinically silent,
but immunologically significant. ample evidence exists effective cd8(+) 
cell response stage well involvement gammadeltat cells and
nk1.1(int) cells immunized animal models. contrast, little
information concerning responses naive host. report several
host gene expressions liver, spleen, kidney balb/c mice altered
during liver stage plasmodium yoelii infection. really interesting new
gene 3 (ring3), semaphorin subclass 4 member g, glutamylcysteine synthetase, 
p45 nf erythroid 2 up-regulated 24 h infection p. yoelii.
semaphorin subclass 4 member g expression elevated kidney, whereas
ring3 elevated spleen kidney. expression tnf-alpha
(tnf-alpha ifn-gamma) down-regulated three tissues tested except 
in infected spleen ifn-gamma elevated. p. yoelii-related host gene
changes compared toxoplasma gondii-infected livers. ring3
expression increased 5-fold control values, whereas expression 
transcripts remained unchanged. tnf-alpha ifn-gamma expressions were
increased toxoplasma-infected livers. uniform increase ring3
expression plasmodium- toxoplasma-infected livers suggests innate 
immune response parasitic infections, whereas gene expression
changes consistent plasmodium parasite-specific responses. taken
together, changes suggest immune responses p. yoelii infection are
both parasite organ specific.
