clinical, clinico-pathological serological studies performed sheep
experimentally infected babesia ovis. acute babesiosis occurred the
lambs infested adult rhipicephalus bursa ticks one lamb infested with
the larvae. rate parasitaemia degree anaemia not
correlated. decrease packed-cell volume ranged 30 40%. parasitized
erythrocytes observed block capillaries brain, explained
the absence nervous symptoms acute babesiosis. kidneys most
severely affected organs, exhibiting acute glomerulonephritis. lesions
observed suggestive vascular alteration vascular stasis, leading to
anoxia tissues. disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic) syndrome
was recorded sheep infected babesiosis. marked increase enzymes 
of transaminase groups, mainly aspartate aminotransferase (ast), was
observed. enzymatic changes (increases ast, alanine aminotransferase (alt) and
lactic dehydrogenase (ldh) decreases sorbitol dehydrogenase (sdh),
alkaline phosphatase (alp) malic enzyme (mez)), decreases total proteins
and albumin, increases urea creatinine might reflect degree of
severity damage liver kidney tissues. lambs (85%)
that infested larvae, lambs infested adult r. bursa ticks,
reacted serologically b. ovis antigen. serological reactions following
infestation larvae occurred much later following infestation 
with adult stage. lambs infested larvae showed mild
clinical reactions challenged infected r. bursa adults, compared 
the reactions challenge naive control animals. serological
findings, addition fact one splenectomized lamb reacted larval 
infestation acute ovine babesiosis, show preimaginal stages r.
bursa transmit b. ovis, usually causing sub-clinical disease. is
suggested infections derived preimaginal ticks winter can
preimmunize sheep subsequent severe infections derived adult
ticks summer. furthermore, absence reliable vaccine b.
