background: pakistan, plasmodium vivax endemic causing approximately 70% of
the malaria cases. number haematological changes, especially
thrombocytopaenia reported p. vivax. several host factors including
cell-mediated immune cells, il-1, il-6 il-10 documented for
p. vivax-induced thrombocytopaenia. however, study correlation cytokines
and thrombocytopaenia p. vivax, particularly patients severe signs and
symptoms reported pakistan.
methods: case control study correlate tnf, il-6 il-10 healthy
controls thrombocytopaenic p. vivax-infected patients (both uncomplicated and
complicated cases) southern pakistan carried january 2009 
december 2011. one hundred eighty two patients presenting with
microscopy-confirmed asexual p. vivax mono-infection 100 healthy controls
were enrolled study aga khan university hospital, karachi.
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) performed determination tnf,
il-6 il-10 levels.
results: 182 cases, mild thrombocytopaenia (platelet count 100,000-150,000
mm3) observed ten (5.5%), moderate (50,000-100,000 mm3) 93 (51.1%), and
profound thrombocytopaenia (<50,000 mm3) detected 79 (43.4%) patients.
il-6 il-10 levels found approximately three-fold higher mild
cases compared healthy controls. two-fold increase tnf il-10 (p <
0.0001) observed profound thrombocytopaenic compared moderate
cases, il-6 found significantly elevated.
conclusion: cytokines may possible role p. vivax-induced
thrombocytopaenia pakistani population. findings study give first
insight pakistan role cytokines p.vivax-associated
thrombocytopaenia. however, studies required understand the
relevance cytokines manifestations thrombocytopaenia p. vivax
malaria.
