plasmodium falciparum malaria common infection yemen. present 
study aims investigate changes hematological hepatic function indices
of p. falciparum infected individuals. study included 67 suspected
falciparum malarial patients attended clinics rural abs hospital (tehama, 
hajjah), yemen, october 2013 april 2014. diagnosis malaria was
confirmed thick thin film giemsa staining malaria parasite.
hematological parameters serum levels aspartate transaminase (ast),
alanine transaminase (alt), alkaline phosphatase (alp), bilirubin (total 
direct) test indicators liver function studied. patients with
parasitaemia tended significantly lower hemoglobin, hematocrit, white
blood cell count, lymphocytes, platelets, compared healthy normal
subjects. neutrophils levels significantly higher cases falciparum
malaria comparison healthy normal subjects. serums ast, alt, alp, and
bilirubin (total direct) falciparum malaria patients significantly
higher (p < 0.0001) falciparum malaria free individuals.
hematological liver dysfunctions measured parameters seen associated
with moderate severe parasitaemia infection. study concludes that
hematological hepatic dysfunction parameters could indicator malaria in
endemic regions.
