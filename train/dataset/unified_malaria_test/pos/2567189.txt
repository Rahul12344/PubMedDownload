hereditary elliptocytosis north africa frequently associated alpha
i/65 spectrin variant, characterized abnormal alpha 65-kd instead 
normal alpha 80-kd peptide following limited trypsin digestion whole
spectrin. similar variant (although yielded 68-kd fragment) shown
recently, two black patients, result insertion leucyl residue
at position 148 (marchesi et al: j clin invest 80:191, 1987). order to
determine underlying molecular defect north africans and
blacks (who originate sides sahara desert), performed
analysis directly dna level. starting dna algerian alpha
i/65 heterozygote mutation associated identifiable rflps, we
cloned sequenced alpha-spectrin gene region, includes mutation.
we thus identified extra leucine codon (ttg) codons 147 149, the
coding sequence becoming cag ttg ttg ctg instead cag ttg ctg. used the
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method dot-blot hybridization the
amplified dna mutant normal allele-specific oligonucleotides screen
the dna four unrelated north african subjects sp alpha i/65
hereditary elliptocytosis. families studied, subjects were
heterozygous ttg insertion. results demonstrate sp alpha i/65 
hereditary elliptocytosis molecular basis north africans and
blacks.
