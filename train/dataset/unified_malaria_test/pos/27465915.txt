the factors determine red blood cell (rbc) lifespan rate rbc
aging fully elucidated. several genetic conditions, including
sickle cell disease, thalassemia, g6pd deficiency, erythrocyte lifespan is
significantly shortened. many diseases also associated with
protection severe malaria, suggesting role accelerated rbc senescence 
and clearance malaria resistance. here, report novel,
n-ethyl-n-nitrosourea-induced mutation causes gain function in
adenosine 5'-monophosphate deaminase (ampd3). mice carrying mutation exhibit 
rapid rbc turnover, increased erythropoiesis, dramatically shortened rbc
lifespan, signs increased rbc senescence/eryptosis, suggesting key role 
for ampd3 determining rbc half-life. mice also found resistant to
infection rodent malaria plasmodium chabaudi. propose resistance
to p. chabaudi mediated increased rbc turnover higher rates of
erythropoiesis infection.
