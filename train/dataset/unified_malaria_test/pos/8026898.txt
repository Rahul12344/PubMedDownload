ornithine decarboxylase (odc) activity markedly induced spleen mice
infected plasmodium berghei, showing maximal activity 8 days the
infection. increase spleen weight, hand, reached peak
after 14 days infection. blood p. berghei-infected mice, increase
of odc activity observed. indicated odc induced spleen
cells, parasites existed blood. polyamines
(putrescine, spermadine spermine) also elevated spleen following 
induction odc activity. hand, increases odc activity and
spleen weight observed spleen mice hemolytic anemia induced
by acetylphenylhydrazine, extent increases smaller than
those spleen mice infected p. berghei. present results suggest
that increases odc activity polyamine levels spleen p.
berghei-infected mice related hyperplasia spleen (splenomegaly)
where formation leukocytes erythrocytes (hematopoiesis) was
dramatically stimulated infection.
