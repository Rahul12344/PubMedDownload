plasmodium falciparum-derived cysteine protease falcipain-2 cleaves host
erythrocyte hemoglobin acidic ph specific components membrane
skeleton neutral ph. analysis stage-specific expression 2
proteolytic activities falcipain-2 shows hemoglobin-hydrolyzing activity 
is maximum early trophozoites declines rapidly late stages, whereas the
membrane skeletal protein hydrolyzing activity markedly increased late 
trophozoite schizont stages. among erythrocyte membrane skeletal
proteins, ankyrin protein 4.1 cleaved native recombinant
falcipain-2 near c-termini. identify precise peptide sequence the
hydrolysis site protein 4.1, used recombinant construct protein 4.1 as
substrate followed maldi-ms analysis cleaved product. show that
falcipain-2-mediated cleavage protein 4.1 occurs immediately lysine 437,
which lies within region spectrin-actin-binding domain critical for
erythrocyte membrane stability. 16-mer peptide containing cleavage site
completely inhibited enzyme activity blocked falcipain-2-induced
fragmentation erythrocyte ghosts. based results, propose that
falcipain-2 cleaves hemoglobin acidic food vacuole early
trophozoite stage, whereas cleaves specific components red cell
skeleton late trophozoite schizont stages. proteolysis of
skeletal proteins causes membrane instability, which, turn, facilitates
parasite release vivo.
