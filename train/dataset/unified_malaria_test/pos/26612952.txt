the invasion suitable host hepatocyte mosquito-transmitted plasmodium
sporozoites essential early step successful malaria parasite infection. 
yet precisely sporozoites target host cell facilitate productive
infection remains largely unknown. found hepatocyte epha2 receptor
was critical establishing permissive intracellular replication compartment,
the parasitophorous vacuole. sporozoites productively infected hepatocytes with
high epha2 expression, deletion epha2 protected mice liver
infection. lack host epha2 phenocopied lack sporozoite proteins p52
and p36. data suggest p36 engages epha2, likely key
step establishing permissive replication compartment.
