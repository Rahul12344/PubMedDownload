epigenetic reprogramming host genes via dna methylation increasingly
recognized critical outcome diverse infectious diseases, but
information malaria yet available. here, investigate effect 
blood-stage malaria plasmodium chabaudi dna methylation status host 
gene promoters genome-wide scale using methylated dna immunoprecipitation
and nimblegen microarrays containing 2,000 bp oligonucleotide features 
split -1,500 -500 bp ups promoters -500 +500 bp cor promoters,
relative transcription site, evaluation differential dna
methylation. gene expression analyzed agilent affymetrix microarray
technology. challenging female c57bl/6 mice 10(6) p. chabaudi-infected
erythrocytes resulted self-healing outcome infections peak
parasitemia day 8 p.i. infections induced organ-specific modifications
of dna methylation gene promoters. among 17,354 features nimblegen
arrays, seven gene promoters identified hypermethylated the
spleen, whereas liver exhibited 109 hyper- 67 hypomethylated promoters at
peak parasitemia comparison non-infected mice. among identified genes
with differentially methylated cor-promoters, 7 genes pigr, ncf1, klkb1,
emr1, ndufb11, tlr6 liver apol6 spleen detected to
have significantly changed expression. remarkably, cor promoter 
toll-like receptor tlr6 became hypomethylated tlr6 expression increased by
3.4-fold infection. concomitantly, ups promoter tlr1 was
hypermethylated, tlr1 expression also increased 11.3-fold. tlr6 tlr1
are known auxillary receptors form heterodimers tlr2 plasma
membranes macrophages, recognize different pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (pamps), as, e.g., intact 3-acyl sn-2-lyso-acyl
glycosylphosphatidylinositols p. falciparum, respectively. data suggest
therefore malaria-induced epigenetic fine-tuning tlr6 tlr1 through
dna methylation gene promoters liver critically important 
initial recognition pamps and, thus, final self-healing outcome of
blood-stage infections p. chabaudi malaria.
