the invasive blood-stage malaria parasite - merozoite - induces rapid
morphological changes target erythrocyte entry. however, evidence
for active molecular changes host cell accompany merozoite invasion
is lacking. here, use invasion inhibition assays, erythrocyte resealing and
high-definition imaging explore red cell responses invasion. show
that although merozoite entry involve erythrocyte actin reorganisation, 
it require atp complete process. towards dissecting atp
requirement, present depth quantitative phospho-proteomic analysis of
the erythrocyte stage invasion. specifically, demonstrate
extensive increased phosphorylation erythrocyte proteins merozoite
attachment, including modification cytoskeletal proteins beta-spectrin and
piezo1. association merozoite contact active entry demonstrates 
that parasite-dependent phosphorylation mediated host-cell kinase activity.
this provides first evidence erythrocyte stimulated respond to
early invasion events molecular changes membrane architecture.
