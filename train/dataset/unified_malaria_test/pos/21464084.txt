acute chronic plasmodium falciparum infections alter immune competence of
the host possibly changes dendritic cell (dc) functionality. dcs are
the potent activators cells, migration integral their
function. mature dcs express lymphoid chemokine receptors (ccrs), expression of
which enables migrate lymph nodes, encounter naïve t
cells. present study aimed investigate impact synthetic analog 
to malaria parasite pigment hemozoin, i.e., β-hematin, infected erythrocytes
(irbcs) activation status human monocyte-derived dcs their
expression ccrs. human monocyte-derived dcs partially matured upon incubation 
with β-hematin indicated increased expression cd80 cd83. both
β-hematin irbcs provoked release proinflammatory anti-inflammatory
cytokines, interleukin-6 (il-6), il-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha, 
but il-12, induced upregulation lymphoid chemokine receptor cxcr4,
which coupled increased migration lymphoid ligands. taken together, 
these results suggest partial transient maturation human myeloid 
dcs upon stimulation malaria parasite-derived products increased
il-10 lack il-12 secretion may lead suboptimal activation cells.
this may turn lead impaired adaptive immune responses therefore
insufficient clearance parasites.
