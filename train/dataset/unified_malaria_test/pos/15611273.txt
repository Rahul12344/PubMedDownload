chemokine production associated immunopathology related to
malaria. previous findings indicated hemozoin (hz), parasite metabolite
released schizogeny, might important source proinflammatory
mediators. study investigated molecular mechanisms underlying
hz-inducible macrophage (mphi) chemokine mrna expression. found both
plasmodium falciparum hz synthetic hz increase mrna levels various
chemokine transcripts (mip-1alpha/ccl3, mip-1beta/ccl4, mip-2/cxcl2, and
mcp-1/ccl2) murine b10r mphi. cellular response hz involved erk1/2
phosphorylation, nf-kappab activation, reactive oxygen species (ros) generation, 
and ros-dependent protein-tyrosine phosphatase down-regulation. selective
inhibition either ikappabalpha erk1/2 pathway abolished nf-kappab 
activation chemokine up-regulation. similarly, blockage hz-inducible mphi 
ros superoxide dismutase suppressed chemokine induction, strongly reduced
nf-kappab activation, restored hz-mediated mphi protein-tyrosine phosphatase 
inactivation. contrast, superoxide dismutase effect ekr1/2
phosphorylation hz. collectively, data indicate hz triggers
ros-dependent -independent signals, leading increased chemokine mrna
expression mphi. overall, findings may help better understand the
molecular mechanisms parasite components, hz, modulate 
immune response malaria infection.
