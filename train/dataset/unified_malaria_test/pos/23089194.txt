the thymus plays crucial role generation t-cells, our
laboratory interested study intrathymic events occur 
during infection diseases may cause disruption functions. previously, 
we showed thymus experimentally plasmodium berghei-infected mice
present histological alterations high levels apoptosis, changes cell
migration-related molecules, premature egress immature thymocytes to
periphery. addition, parasites found inside thymus. work we
investigated alterations expression pattern activity matrix
metalloproteinases mmp-2 -9, tissue inhibitors, timp-1 timp-2. 
our results show enhanced expression widespread distribution these
molecules thymus infected animals. also, presence active mmp-2 was
detected. data suggestive mmps timps importance earlier
observed changes extracellular matrix thymic alterations after
plasmodium infection.
