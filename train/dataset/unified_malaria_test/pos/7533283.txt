bovine macrophage-derived tumour necrosis factor-alpha/cachectin (tnf-alpha) 
synthesized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) purified adherent 
pbmc naive theileria annulata-infected cattle incubated vitro
with concanavalin (con-a) bovine recombinant interferon gamma (bo
rifn-gamma). tnf-alpha production also induced adherent pbmc were
cultured t. annulata macroschizont-infected cells. contrast, non-adherent
pbmc sublethally infected cattle produced interferon (ifn) incubated
with hu ril-2, con-a, phytohaemagglutinin (pha) t. annulata
macroschizont-infected cells growing cell lines vitro. whilst pbmc from
lethally infected cattle spontaneously produced ifn-gamma advanced stages 
of infection, sera animals contained type 1 ifn (alpha/beta). ifn was
also produced t. annulata macroschizont-infected cell lines maintained in
vitro. work suggests cytokines serve crucial links between
proliferating theileira-infected cells characteristic clinical symptoms
of tropical theileriosis.
