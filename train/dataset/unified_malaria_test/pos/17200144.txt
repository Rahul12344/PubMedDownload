il-4 distinct effects differentiation functional properties of
cd8+ cells. vivo studies shown critical development 
of protective memory responses tumors infections leishmania and
plasmodium parasites. intracellular signaling events mediated il-4/il-4
receptor (il-4r) interactions cd4+ cells studied extensively;
however, nature il-4-induced signaling cd8+ cells been
characterized. using naïve, activated, well differentiated cd8+ cells, we
show il-4 strong vivo vitro antiapoptotic effect on
activated resting cd8+ cells. demonstrate il-4 induces the
phosphorylation il-4r, followed activation least two
distinct intracellular signaling cascades: jak1/stat6 insulin
receptor substrate/pi-3k/protein kinase b pathways. also found il-4
induces jak3-mediated phosphorylation nuclear migration stat1, stat3, 
and stat5 naïve, activated, well differentiated, ifn-gamma-producing
cd8+ cells. induction broad signaling activity cd8+ cells
coincides transcriptional activity suppressors cytokine signaling
genes, decreased significantly comparison cd4+ cells. 
knowledge, report constitutes first comprehensive analysis the
signaling events shape cd8+ cell responses il-4.
