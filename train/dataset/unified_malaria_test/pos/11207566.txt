the intracellular parasite theileria parva infects transforms bovine t-cells,
inducing uncontrolled proliferation spread non-lymphoid well as
lymphoid tissues. parasite-induced transformation predominant factor 
contributing pathogenesis lymphoproliferative disease, called east

signalling pathways normally emanate t-cell antigen receptor to
induce continuous proliferation. review concentrates influence the
