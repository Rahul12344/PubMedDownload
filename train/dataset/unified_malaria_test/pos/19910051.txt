babesia bovis intraerythrocytic apicomplexan protozoa cattle causes
an acute infection parasite persistence. babesiosis limitation depends on
macrophages, essential effector cells host innate defense, generate 
inflammatory cytokines nitric oxide. herein, report quantitative
differences lipid composition merozoites two b. bovis strains with
polar behaviour: attenuated r1a virulent s2p. accordingly, observed a
distinct inflammatory response induced total lipids r1a (l(a)) s2p 
(l(v)) murine peritoneal macrophages. l(a) particularly fractions
phosphatidic acid phosphatidylserine+phosphatidylinositol (ps+pi), produced a
strong activation cells lipid body formation, cyclooxygenase-2
expression pro-inflammatory tnfalpha, il-6 kc secretion. although l(v)
did activate cells, corresponding ps+pi fraction induced tnfalpha, 
il-6 kc release. therefore, facts might suggesting presence of
an inhibitor l(v). furthermore, employment wild type toll like
receptor 2 knockout (tlr2ko) mice allowed us demonstrate macrophage
activation stimulating lipid fractions mediated tlr2.
interestingly, l(a) activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1
and 2 (erk1/2). inhibitory studies employing uo126, indicated erk
pathway required tnfalpha, il-6 kc release. conclusion, the
absence inflammatory response observed lipids s2p virulent strain 
could constitute evasion mechanism innate immune response enabling
parasite establishment host.
