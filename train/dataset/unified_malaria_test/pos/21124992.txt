theileria parasites invade transform bovine leukocytes causing either east
coast fever (t. parva), tropical theileriosis (t. annulata). susceptible
animals usually die within weeks infection, indigenous infected cattle
show markedly reduced pathology, suggesting host genetic factors may cause
disease susceptibility. attenuated live vaccines widely used control
tropical theileriosis attenuation associated reduced invasiveness 
infected macrophages vitro. disease pathogenesis therefore linked to
aggressive invasiveness, rather uncontrolled proliferation of
theileria-infected leukocytes. show invasive potential of
theileria-transformed leukocytes involves tgf-b signalling. attenuated live
vaccine lines express reduced tgf-b2 invasiveness rescued with
exogenous tgf-b. importantly, infected macrophages disease susceptible
holstein-friesian (hf) cows express tgf-b2 traverse matrigel great 
efficiency compared disease-resistant sahiwal cattle. thus, tgf-b2 
levels correlate disease susceptibility. using fluorescence time-lapse
video microscopy show theileria-infected, disease-susceptible hf
macrophages exhibit increased actin dynamics lamellipodia podosomal 
adhesion structures develop membrane blebs. tgf-b2-associated
invasiveness hf macrophages transcription-independent element that
relies cytoskeleton remodelling via activation rho kinase (rock). we
propose tgf-b autocrine loop confers amoeboid-like motility on
theileria-infected leukocytes, combines mmp-dependent motility to
drive invasiveness virulence.
