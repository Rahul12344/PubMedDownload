cerebral malaria (cm) associated excessive host proinflammatory responses
and endothelial activation. hematopoietic hormone erythropoietin (epo)
possesses neuroprotective functions animal models ischemic-hypoxic,
traumatic, inflammatory injuries. plasmodium berghei anka model of
experimental cm (ecm), recombinant human epo (rhepo) shown evident protection
against ecm. elucidate mechanism epo ecm model, investigated
the effect rhepo host cellular immune responses. demonstrated that
improved survival mice ecm rhepo treatment associated with
reduced endothelial activation improved integrity blood-brain barrier.
our results revealed rhepo downregulated inflammatory responses by
directly inhibiting levels functions splenic dendritic cells.
conversely, rhepo treatment led significant expansion regulatory cells
and increased expression receptor cytotoxic lymphocyte antigen 4
(ctla-4). data presented provide evidence direct effect rhepo 
on host cellular immunity ecm.
