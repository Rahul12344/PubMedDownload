the levels apoptosis associated proteins bcl(2), bax, cytochrome-c p53 was
investigated mice cerebral cortex cerebellum, using experimental model 
of fatal murine cerebral malaria (fmcm). owing activation events
central mitochondrial dysfunctions, monitored structural integrity of
mitochondria cerebral malaria (cm) infected brain tissue transmission em
(tem) studies. western blot analysis revealed induction bcl(2), bax,
cytochrome-c p53 cortex cerebellum. tem studies revealed
extensive vacuolation swelling mitochondria infected brain suggestive
of late stage degeneration. results underscore activation an
intrinsic cell death pathway evinced induction mitochondria
associated apoptotic proteins bcl(2), bax cytochrome-c envisages 
the induction p53 possible continuation post receptor signaling
events associated tumor necrosis factor induction following inflammatory
responses cm. findings may crucial mitochondrial dysfunctions 
underlying pathology fmcm.
