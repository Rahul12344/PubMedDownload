cerebral malaria (cm) associated excessive inflammatory responses and
endothelial activation. sphingosine 1-phosphate (s1p) signaling sphingolipid
implicated regulating vascular integrity, inflammation t-cell migration.
we hypothesized altered s1p signaling malaria contributes to
endothelial activation inflammation, show plasma s1p levels were
decreased ugandan children cm compared children uncomplicated
malaria. using plasmodium berghei anka (pba) model experimental cm (ecm), 
we demonstrate humanized s1p lyase (hs1pl)(-/-) mice reduced s1p lyase 
activity (resulting increased bio-available s1p) improved survival
compared wild-type littermates. prophylactic therapeutic treatment of
infected mice compounds modulate s1p pathway human
trials conditions (fty720 lx2931) significantly improved survival in
ecm. fty720 treatment improved vascular integrity indicated reduced levels 
of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sicam), increased angiopoietin 1
(ang1) (regulator endothelial quiescence) levels, decreased evans blue dye
leakage brain parenchyma. furthermore, treatment fty720 decreased ifnÎ³ 
levels plasma well cd4(+) cd8(+) t-cell infiltration brain.
finally, administered infection combination artesunate,
fty720 treatment resulted increased survival ecm. findings implicate 
dysregulation s1p pathway pathogenesis human murine cm and
suggest novel therapeutic strategy improve clinical outcome severe
malaria.
