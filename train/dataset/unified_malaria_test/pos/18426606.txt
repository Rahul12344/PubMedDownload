background: thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (trap) essential for
sporozoite motility liver cell invasion. trap type 1 membrane
protein possesses multiple adhesive domains extracellular region.
methods: plasmodium falciparum trap (pftrap) subdomains expressed in
a mammalian expression system, eleven different mutants generated study
interaction pftrap liver cells. binding studies hepg2 cell
extracts pftrap performed using co-immunoprecipitation protocols.
results: five different amino acid residues pftrap involved liver 
cell binding identified. pftrap mutants bound heparin like the
wild type pftrap thereby suggesting non-heparin mediated binding pftrap to
liver cells. three src family proteins -lyn, lck crkl interact with
pftrap also identified. liver cell extracts immunoprecipitated src family
kinases phosphorylated pftrap multiple sites. analysis multiple trap
sequences revealed src homology 3 domain (sh3) binding motifs.
conclusion: binding pftrap sh3-domain containing proteins like src-family
kinases ability phosphorylate pftrap suggests novel role for
pftrap cell signaling sporozoite invasion homing inside liver
cells. data shed new light trap-liver cell interactions.
