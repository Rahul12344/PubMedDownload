background: molecular mechanisms involved pathogenesis severe
plasmodium falciparum malaria (sm), yet fully understood. both
endothelin-1 (et-1) c-type natriuretic peptide (cnp) produced vascular
endothelium act locally paracrine regulators vascular tone, et-1 
a potent vasoconstrictor cnp strong vasorelaxant properties.
methods: plasma levels et-1 n-terminal fragments cnp (nt-procnp) were
studied admission 24 hours treatment, using
enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay (elisa) technique, gabonese children with
severe falciparum malaria (sm, n = 50), uncomplicated malaria (um, n = 39)
and healthy controls (hc, n = 25).
results: compared hc, malaria patients significantly higher plasma levels 
of et-1 significantly lower levels nt-procnp (p < 0.001 p < 0.024
respectively). plasma levels nt-procnp additionally decreased sm
patients compared hc (p = 0.034), whereas um significantly different
to hc. sm group found trend towards lower et-1 levels compared um 
(p = 0.085).
conclusion: present study, imbalance vasoconstricitve and
vasorelaxant endothelium-derived substances et-1 cnp plasma of
children falciparum malaria demonstrated, presumably favor of
vasoconstrictive pro-inflammatory effects. results may indicate
involvement et-1 cnp malaria pathogenesis. furthermore, results of
lower et-1 cnp levels sm may reflect endothelial cell damage.
