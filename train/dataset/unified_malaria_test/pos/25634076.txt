the indigenous populations peninsular malaysia, locally known orang asli,
continue adopt agro-subsistence nomadic lifestyle, residing primarily
within natural jungle habitats. leading hunter-gatherer lifestyle tropical
jungle environment, orang asli routinely exposed malaria. we
surveyed genetic architecture individuals four orang asli tribes with
high-density genotyping across 2.5 million polymorphisms. tribes 
reside different geographical locations peninsular malaysia belong to
three main ethno-linguistic groups, minimal interaction between
the tribes. first dissect genetic diversity admixture the
tribes neighboring urban populations. later, implementing five
metrics, investigated genome-wide signatures positive natural
selection orang asli, respectively. finally, searched evidence of
genomic adaptation pressure malaria infection. observed that
different evolutionary responses might emerged different orang asli
communities mitigate malaria infection.
