infections often complicated increase glucose production due to
stimulation secretion glucose counter-regulatory hormones and
cytokines. adiponectin, fat-derived hormone insulin-sensitizing
properties, could play regulatory role degree stimulation glucose 
production infectious agent. therefore, investigated possible
correlation glucose production plasma adiponectin levels 25
subjects: 7 patients cerebral malaria, 6 uncomplicated malaria, 12 
matched controls. glucose production significantly higher patients with
malaria compared healthy controls (p < .001). adiponectin levels not
different patients malaria control group. however,
patients cerebral malaria significantly higher values adiponectin
than patients uncomplicated malaria (p < .005). glucose production and
gluconeogenesis positively correlated plasma adiponectin patients 
(r = 0.835, p < .001 r = 0.846, p < .001, respectively), whereas these
correlations absent controls (r = -0.329, ns r = -0.028, ns,
respectively). conclusion, adiponectin levels different between
patients malaria matched controls. however, patients infected with
plasmodium falciparum higher glucose production also higher
adiponectin levels. healthy subjects correlation found. as
adiponectin known inhibit glucose production, stimulation adiponectin
secretion infection could intended restrain glucose production
stimulating properties hormones cytokines secreted infection.
