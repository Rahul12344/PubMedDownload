transforming growth factor beta-1 (tgf-beta1) pleiotropic cytokine both
pro- antiinflammatory properties, depending environment and
concentration. present study evaluated effects orally-delivered
tgf-beta1 mice parenterally-infected various protozoan parasites. we
report orally-administered tgf-beta1 seems confer partial
protection murine chronic babesiosis acute trypanosomosis, no
beneficial clinical effects observed acute babesiosis, malaria or
toxoplasmosis. taken together, preliminary data suggest systemic
effects conferred exogenous tgf-beta1 could parasite species-specific. 
variations different parasitic infections could due (i) intrinsic
differences parasite species and/or strains ability induce
production immunosuppressive molecules and/or (ii) differences mechanisms
governing host protection different parasitic infections.
