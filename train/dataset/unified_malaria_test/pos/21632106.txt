background: placental malaria associated local accumulation of
parasitized erythrocytes, deposition parasite hemoglobin metabolite,
hemozoin, accumulation mononuclear cells intervillous space. fetal 
syncytiotrophoblast cells contact maternal blood known respond
immunologically cytoadherent plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes, 
their responsiveness hemozoin, potent pro-inflammatory stimulator of
monocytes, macrophages dendritic cells, known.
methods: biochemical immunological changes induced primary
syncytiotrophoblast natural hemozoin assessed. changes in
syncytiotrophoblast mitogen-activated protein kinase activation assessed by
immunoblotting secreted cytokine chemokine proteins assayed by
elisa. chemotaxis peripheral blood mononuclear cells assessed using a
two-chamber assay system flow cytometry used assess activation 
primary monocytes hemozoin-stimulated syncytiotrophoblast conditioned medium.
results: hemozoin stimulation induced erk1/2 phosphorylation. treated cells
secreted cxcl8, ccl3, ccl4, tumor necrosis factor released soluble
intercellular adhesion molecule-1. furthermore, dependence hemozoin
responses erk1/2 stimulation confirmed inhibition chemokine release 
in syncytiotrophoblast treated erk pathway inhibitor. hemozoin-stimulated
cells elicited specific migration pbmcs, conditioned medium the
cells induced upregulation intercellular adhesion molecule-1 primary
monocytes.
conclusions: findings confirm immunostimulatory role hemozoin and
expand cell types known responsive hemozoin include fetal
syncytiotrophoblast. results provide evidence that
syncytiotrophoblast cells influence local maternal immune response to
placental malaria.
