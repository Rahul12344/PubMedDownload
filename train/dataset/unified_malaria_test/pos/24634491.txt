cell-mediated immunity plays crucial role development host resistance
to asexual blood-stage malaria infection. however, little known the
regulatory factors involved process. study, investigated the
impact mapk phosphotase 5 (mkp5) protective immunity lethal
plasmodium yoelii 17xl blood-stage infection using mkp5 knockout c57bl/6 mice.
compared wild-type control mice, mkp5 knockout mice developed significantly 
lower parasite burdens prolonged survival times. found this
phenomenon correlated rapid strong ifn-γ-dependent cellular immune
response acute phase infection. inactivation ifn-γ the
administration neutralizing ab significantly reduced protective effects 
in mkp5 knockout mice. analyzing ifn-γ production innate adaptive
lymphocyte subsets, observed mkp5 deficiency specifically enhanced the
ifn-γ response mediated cd4+ cells, attributable increased 
stimulatory capacity splenic cd11c+ dendritic cells. furthermore, following
vaccination whole blood-stage soluble plasmodial ag, mkp5 knockout mice
acquired strongly enhanced ag-specific immune responses higher level of
protection subsequent p. yoelii 17xl challenge. finally, found the
enhanced response mediated mkp5 deficiency resulted lethal consequence in
mice infected nonlethal p. yoelii 17xnl. thus, data indicate that
mkp5 potential regulator immune resistance plasmodium infection
in mice, understanding role mkp5 manipulating
anti-malaria immunity may provide valuable information development of
better control strategies human malaria.
