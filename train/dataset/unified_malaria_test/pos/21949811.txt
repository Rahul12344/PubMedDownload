the protective immunity natural killer (nk) cells malarial infections 
is thought due early production type ii interferon (ifn) possibly
direct nk cell cytotoxicity. better understand mechanism, microarray
analysis conducted nk cells healthy donors pbmcs were
co-cultured p. falciparum 3d7-infected erythrocytes. similar pattern 
of gene expression observed among donors treatment three
replicas. parasites particularly modulated genes involved ifn-α/β signaling as
well molecules involved activation interferon regulatory factors,
pathways known play role antimicrobial immune response. pattern 
of transcription entirely different shown nk cells treated 
il-12 il-18, ifn-γ- trem-1-related genes over-expressed.
these results suggest p. falciparum parasites cytokines il-12 and
il-18 diverse imprints transcriptome human primary nk cells.
ifn-α-related genes prominent molecules induced parasites nk cells 
and arise candidate biomarkers merit investigated as
potential new tools malaria control.
