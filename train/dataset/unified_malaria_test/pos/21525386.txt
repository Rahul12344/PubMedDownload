parasite burden predicts disease severity malaria risk death in
cerebral malaria patients. murine experimental cerebral malaria (ecm),
parasite burden cd8(+) cells promote disease mechanisms not
fully understood. found majority brain-recruited cd8(+) cells
expressed granzyme b (gzmb). furthermore, gzmb(-/-) mice harbored reduced
parasite numbers brain consequence enhanced antiparasitic cd4(+) t
cell responses protected ecm. showed ecm-resistant mice
that adoptively transferred, ag-specific cd8(+) cells migrated brain,
but induce ecm critical ag threshold reached. ecm induction
was exquisitely dependent ag-specific cd8(+) cell-derived perforin gzmb,
but ifn-Î³. wild-type mice, full activation brain-recruited cd8(+) t
cells also depended critical number parasites tissue, in
turn, sustained tissue-recruited cells. thus, interdependent
relationship parasite burden cd8(+) cells dictates onset of
perforin/gzmb-mediated ecm.
