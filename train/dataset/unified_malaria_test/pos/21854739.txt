cerebral malaria (cm) associated high mortality risk sequelae, and
development adjunct therapies hampered limited knowledge its
pathogenesis. assess role cerebral hypoxia, used two experimental
models cm, plasmodium berghei anka cba c57bl/6 mice, two models 
malaria without neurologic signs, p. berghei k173 cba mice p. berghei anka
in balb/c mice. hypoxia demonstrated brain sections using intravenous
pimonidazole staining hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-specific antibody.
cytopathic hypoxia studied using poly (adp-ribose) polymerase-1 (parp-1) gene
knockout mice. effect erythropoietin, oxygen-sensitive cytokine that
mediates protection cm, cerebral hypoxia studied c57bl/6 mice. 
numerous hypoxic foci neurons glial cells observed mice cm.
substantially fewer smaller foci observed mice without cm, and
hypoxia seemed confined neuronal cell somas. parp-1-deficient mice 
not protected cm, argues role cytopathic hypoxia.
erythropoietin therapy reversed development cm substantially reduced
the degree neural hypoxia. findings demonstrate cerebral hypoxia in
malaria, strongly associated cerebral dysfunction possible target 
adjunctive therapy.
