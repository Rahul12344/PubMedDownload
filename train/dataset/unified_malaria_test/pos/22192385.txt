background: mechanisms underlying pathogenesis cerebral malaria (cm)
syndrome well understood. previous studies shown strong
association inflammatory chemokines, apoptotic markers angiogenic
molecules cm associated mortality. recognizing importance of
angiopoietins (ang) pathogenesis cm, retrospective investigation 
carried hospital cohort malaria patients plasmodium infection in
central india determine factors could suitable markers cm
associated severity.
methods: patients enrolled study clinically characterized healthy 
controls (hc), mild malaria (mm), cm survivors (cms) cm non-survivors (cmns) 
based malaria status hospital treatment outcome. plasma ang-1 and
ang-2 levels assessed using sandwich elisa. receiver operating
characteristic (roc) curve analysis used calculate area curve
(auc) biomarker order assess predictive accuracy individual
biomarkers.
results: plasma levels ang-1 lower cms cmns compared to
control groups (mild malaria healthy controls) time hospital
admission. contrary, ang-2 levels positively correlated malaria
severity significantly higher cmns. ratio ang-2/ang-1 was
highest cmns compared groups. receiver operating characteristic
curves revealed compared ang-1 (auc = 0.35), ang-2 (auc = 0.95) ratio
of ang-2/ang-1 (auc = 0.90) better markers discriminate cmns mm
cases. however, less specific predicting fatal outcome amongst cm
cases time hospital admission.
conclusion: results suggest time admission plasma levels 
ang-2 ratio ang-2/ang-1 clinically informative biomarkers predict
fatal cm mm cases limited usefulness discriminating fatal
cm outcomes pool cm cases endemic settings central india.
