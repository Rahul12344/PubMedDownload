aim: (ca)n repeat located 3' utr region exon 29 nos1 gene
(encoding neuronal nitric oxide synthase) shown affect size
of mrna. nos1 mrna highly diverse, contributing changes transcript
generation, degradation, processing, subcellular targeting. present
work, analyzed allele frequencies (ca)n repeat nine populations 
the mediterranean area middle europe. aimed testing presence a
north-south positive gradient frequencies ≤17 allele repeats, compatible
with hypothesis positive selection suggested two previous works,
related past prevalence malaria infection europe.
results: results show significant negative correlations latitude with
frequencies alleles genotypes s/s s/l (p < 0.01).
conclusions: conclusion, north-south gradient alleles found the
present work would confirm previous observation nos1 gene,
reinforcing hypothesis selective action malaria infection. this
hypothesis strengthened role nitric oxide immunity system.
