infection mice plasmodium berghei anka (pba) leads thrombocytopenia,
due reduced platelet life span, eventually associated syndrome of
severe cerebral malaria (cm). thrombocytopenia associated increase
in number microparticles (mcp) plasma. >60% mcp were
of platelet origin, seen staining anti-platelet antibody. the
thrombocytopenia amount mcp decreased mice treated anti
cd40l mab, suggesting cd40l main effector thrombocytopenia.
caspase-1, -3, -6, -8, -9 activated platelets infected mice, seen
by binding labeled probes amount pro-caspase-3. treatment of
infected mice caspases inhibitor zvad-fmk decreased number mcp
and thrombocytopenia, showing platelet caspases responsible for
platelet fragmentation. addition, caspase inhibitor also caused decrease
in mortality associated cm, indicating critical role caspases in
the expression cm.
