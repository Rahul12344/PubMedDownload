theileria annulata tick-transmitted protozoan parasite cattle, which
transforms cells macrophage (mphi) b cell lineage. bone marrow cells, bone 
marrow cell-derived, monocyte-derived mphi infected t. annulata
sporozoites, resulting cell lines assessed surface marker
expression function. transformed lines expressed histocompatibility complex
(mhc) class-i ii, cd44, cd45, myeloid marker dh598-surface markers
cd14, cd11b, m-m7, th57a, lesser extent cd11a/cd18, cd11c, act(b),
were down-regulated. likewise, transformed cells failed express mphi functions
(fc-receptor-mediated phagocytosis, phorbol myristate acetate-induced oxidative
burst, lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha, nitric oxide
generation procoagulant activity up-regulation). mphi origin assured by
homogeneity starting population, cloning cells limiting dilution,
and repeated microscopic flow cytometric monitoring cell lines.
elimination parasite treatment bw720c resulted the
re-acquisition monocyte lineage properties, evidenced up-regulation of
cd14, re-acquisition capacity ingest opsonized sheep red blood
cells bacteria. thus, mphi transformed t. annulata appear undergo a
process parasite-induced dedifferentiation reassume differentiated
phenotype upon elimination parasite.
