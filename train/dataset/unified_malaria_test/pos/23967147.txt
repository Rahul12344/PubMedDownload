severe malaria trigger acute lung injury characterized pulmonary edema
resulting increased endothelial permeability. however, mechanism through
which lung fluid conductance altered malaria remains unclear. define
the role scavenger receptor cd36 may play mediating response,
c57bl/6j (wt) cd36-/- mice infected p. berghei anka monitored
for changes pulmonary endothelial barrier function employing isolated
perfused lung system. wt lungs demonstrated >10-fold increase two measures
of paracellular fluid conductance decrease albumin reflection
coefficient (σalb) compared control lungs indicating loss barrier
function. contrast, malaria-infected cd36-/- mice near normal fluid
conductance similar reduction σalb. wt mice, lung sequestered irbcs
demonstrated production reactive oxygen species (ros). determine whether
knockout cd36 could protect ros-induced endothelial barrier
dysfunction, mouse lung microvascular endothelial monolayers (mlmvec) wt and
cd36-/- mice exposed h2o2. unlike wt monolayers, showed
dose-dependent decreases transendothelial electrical resistance (ter) from
h2o2 indicating loss barrier function, cd36-/- mlmvec demonstrated
dose-dependent increases ter. differences responses wt and
cd36-/- endothelial cells correlated important differences the
intracellular compartmentalization cd36-associated fyn kinase. malaria
infection increased total lung fyn levels cd36-/- lungs compared wt, but
this increase due elevated production inactive form fyn 
suggesting dysregulation fyn-mediated signaling. importance fyn in
cd36-dependent endothelial signaling confirmed using vitro fyn knockdown
as well fyn-/- mice, also protected h2o2- malaria-induced 
lung endothelial leak, respectively. results demonstrate cd36 fyn
kinase critical mediators increased lung endothelial fluid conductance
caused malaria infection.
