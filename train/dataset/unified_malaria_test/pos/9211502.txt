theileria-infected cells induced undergo transformation is
reversible, since proliferation inhibited elimination the
schizonts theilericidal drug buparvaquone. molecular mechanisms the
transformation remain unknown. experiments described present report
deal role casein kinase (ck) ii, serine/threonine protein kinase,
in permanent proliferation parasitized cells show ck
ii-alpha subunit expressed t. annulata- t. parva-infected cells
and expression closely related presence parasites in
the host-cell cytoplasm. thus, elimination schizonts buparvaquone leads
to inhibition ck ii-alpha subunit mrna expression without affecting the
expression actin. cells treated with
5,6-dichloro-1-beta-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (drb) inhibited a
dose-dependent manner under-going dna synthesis measured by
[3h]-thymidine incorporation expressing ck ii. furthermore, a
host-cell-specific ck ii-alpha antisense inhibits dna synthesis a
dose-dependent manner. present study, 6 microm antisense reduced
[3h]-thymidine incorporation theileria-infected bovine cells 50%.
using primer derived t. parva ck ii, detected parasite-specific ck ii
mrna t. parva-infected cell lines. interestingly. drb also inhibited the
expression parasite-specific ck ii. however, date detected 
a target sequence primer t. annulata schizonts.
