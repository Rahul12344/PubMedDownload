the aim study evaluate lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and
activity enzymes indicators oxidative stress rangelia vitalii
infection dogs. animals divided two groups: negative control (n=5)
and infected r. vitalii (n=7). inoculation, parasitemia was
estimated daily microscopic examination smears. lipid peroxidation (tbars) 
and advanced oxidation protein products (aopp); delta-aminolevulinate
dehydratase (δ-ala-d), superoxide dismutase (sod) catalase (cat) activities
in blood evaluated. samples collected days 10 20
post-inoculation (pi). tbars aopp levels higher infected group in
both analyzed periods (p<0.01). δ-ala-d activity reduced blood dogs
infected r. vitalii days 10 20 pi. sod activity significantly
increased (p<0.01) blood dogs infected r. vitalii days 10 and
20 pi, cat activity significantly increased (p<0.01) day 20 pi 
when compared non-infected animals. positive correlation observed
between degree parasitemia tbars aopp levels activity of
antioxidant enzymes. δ-ala-d activity negatively correlated the
degree parasitemia. based increased levels tbars, aopp, sod cat 
activities, inhibition δ-ala-d activity, concluded dogs
experimentally infected r. vitalii develop state redox unbalance and
that changes might involved pathophysiology disease.
