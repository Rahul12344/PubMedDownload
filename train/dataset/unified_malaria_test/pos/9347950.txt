there increasing evidence inappropriate immune activation induced by
parasite products occurs malaria disease. elucidate role of
plasmodium falciparum-derived products host immune activation, studied 
expression leukocyte adhesion molecules (cd11b/cd18 lam-1) neutrophils 
and monocytes response malaria pigment using flow cytometry. exposure of
leukocytes isolated malaria pigment derived ruptured schizonts resulted
in significant up-regulation cd11b/cd18 expression down-regulation of
lam-1 neutrophils monocytes. contrast, culture supernatants
(pigment free) ruptured schizonts alter expression cd11b/cd18
and lam-1. increase cd11b/cd18 loss lam-1 expression occurred
simultaneously earliest response detected 10 min plateau
reached 60 min. effect malaria pigment leukocyte adhesion molecules 
was inhibited edta dose-dependent manner. phagocytosis malaria pigment
was also suppressed edta. observation suggests phagocytosis of
malaria pigment may prerequisite effect malaria pigment the
regulation cd11b/cd18 lam-1 expression. regulation leukocyte adhesion
molecules up-regulation cd11b/cd18 down-regulation lam-1 by
malaria pigment could promote leukocyte adherence endothelium vivo. this
increased adherence malaria pigment-activated leukocytes might induce cytokine
(tumor necrosis factor alpha interleukin-1beta)-mediated increases in
capillary permeability resulting local tissue edema, cytokine-mediated
increase adhesion molecule expression causing vascular clogging adherent
red blood cells, severe disease adherent leukocytes.
