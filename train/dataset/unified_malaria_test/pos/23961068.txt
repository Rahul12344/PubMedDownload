babesia divergens intraerythrocytic parasite capable infecting 
a wide range vertebrates causing huge economic losses. histopathological,
hematological biochemical changes b. divergens infection female
meriones ungliculatus reported. animals challenged 5 × 10(6) b.
divergens-infected erythrocytes. parasitemia maximum day 5 postinfection 
where gerbils died. infection gerbils babesia induced significant
decrease erythrocytic count well hemoglobin concentration and
hematocrit percentage leucocytes increased significantly compared
to uninfected gerbils. liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (ast) aniline
aminotransferase (alt) significantly increased albumin total
bilirubin significantly decreased day 5 postinfection b.
divergens-infected erythrocytes. histopathological scores inflammation after
infection gerbils done using ischak's activity index indicated that
the liver severely affected. conclusion, study indicated the
course infection b. divergens-induced alternations hematology,
biochemistry histopathology hepatic tissue.
