disrupted signaling lymphotoxin beta receptor (ltbetar) results severe
defects spleen even loss secondary lymphoid tissues,
making mice susceptible diverse infectious agents. surprisingly, however, we
find female ltbetar-deficient mice even resistant blood stages
of plasmodium chabaudi malaria wild-type c57bl/6 mice. higher resistance 
ltbetar-deficient mice correlates earlier onset reticulocytosis, and
the period anemia shorter. surviving fulminant parasitemias 
35%, mice develop long-lasting protective immunity homologous
rechallenge, spleen liver acting anti-malaria effectors.
testosterone suppresses resistance, i.e. mice succumb infections or
shortly peak parasitemia. peak parasitemia, testosterone not
essentially affect cellularity apoptosis spleen, aggravates liver 
pathology terms increased cell swelling, numbers apoptotic and
binucleated cells reduced serum alkaline phosphatase levels, conversely, 
reduces inflammatory lymphocytic infiltrates liver. spleen,
hybridization cdna arrays identified testosterone-induced changes
in gene expression, particular upregulation infgamma ifn-regulated
genes. contrast, much larger number testosterone-affectable genes was
observed liver, including genes involved regulation the
extracellular matrix, chemokine cytokine signaling, cell cycle
control. collectively, data suggest testosterone dysregulates the
inflammatory response spleen liver differentiation to
anti-malaria effectors malaria-resistant female ltbetar-deficient mice, thus
contributing testosterone-induced lethal outcome malaria.
