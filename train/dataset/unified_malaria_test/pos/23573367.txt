the mechanisms malaria anemia remain incompletely understood although much
effort put studies human murine systems. hematopoiesis is
regulated proliferation, differentiation maturation erythropoietic 
progenitor cells erythrocytes tightly controlled complex
communication network cytokines signal mediators. present study used
the murine p. yoelii 17xnl malaria model investigate profile cytokines 
and leukocytes throughout entire infection. moreover, malaria induced anemia 
was studied comparison anemia induced hemorrhage hemolysis. during
the p. yoelii infection, levels erythropoietic-related cytokines, 
g-csf, gmcsf, il-7, il-17, pronouncedly reduced, of
regulatory cytokines, il-10 tnf-Î±, constantly increased. this
cytokine profile corresponded well cellular composition the
infection, drastically decreased levels cd4(+) cd8(+) cells. the
cytokine profile malarial anemia showed characteristics anemia
induced hemorrhage hemolysis. study demonstrates markedly
dysregulated cytokine network occurred murine malaria model, may
open new window insight mechanisms malaria related anemia.
