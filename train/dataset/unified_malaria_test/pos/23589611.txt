ag-specific memory cell responses elicited infections vaccinations are
inextricably linked long-lasting protective immunity. studies protective
immunity among residents malaria endemic areas indicate memory responses 
to plasmodium ags adequately developed maintained, people who
survive episodes childhood malaria still vulnerable either persistent
or intermittent malaria infections. contrast, multiple exposures to
radiation-attenuated plasmodium berghei sporozoites (pb γ-spz) induce
long-lasting protective immunity experimental sporozoite challenge. we
previously demonstrated sterile protection induced pb γ-spz mhc class 
i-dependent cd8 cells key effectors. ifn-γ(+) cd8 cells that
arise pb γ-spz-immunized b6 mice found predominantly liver 
sensitive levels liver-stage ag depot express cd44(hi)cd62l(lo)
markers indicative effector/effector memory phenotype. developmentally
related central memory cd8 (tcm) cells express elevated levels cd122
(il-15rβ), suggests cd8 tcm cells depend il-15 maintenance.
using il-15-deficient mice, demonstrate study although protective
immunity inducible mice, protection short-lived, mainly owing to
the inability cd8 tcm cells survive il-15-deficient milieu. we
present hypothesis consistent model whereby intrahepatic cd8 tcm cells, 
being maintained il-15-mediated survival basal proliferation, are
conscripted cd8 effector/effector memory cell pool subsequent
