one splenectomized 6 intact coyotes (canis latrans), 2 coydogs were
experimentally inoculated recent isolate babesia gibsoni. disease
was mild intact animals, fatal splenectomized coyote, was
characterized regenerative hemolytic anemia pcv decreasing 16%
in intact animals 6% splenectomized coyote. peak parasitemia ranged
from 3% 21% erythrocytes infected inversely correlated pcv.
serum lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, globulin concentrations were
increased infected animals. three weeks inoculation, specific
antibody titers increased 1:65,536 remained elevated chronically
infected animals. splenectomized coyote progressive weakness death,
24 days inoculation. intact animals splenomegaly anorexia the
height infection. splenectomized coyote generalized edema, omental
petechiae, renal hepatic degeneration, membrano-proliferative
glomerulonephritis congestion, extramedullary hematopoiesis, lymphoid
hyperplasia, severe hemosiderosis accessory spleen. consistent
