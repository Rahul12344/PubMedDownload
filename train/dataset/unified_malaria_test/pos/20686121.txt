severe malaria anemia characterized inhibited/altered erythropoiesis and
presence hemozoin-(hz)-laden bone-marrow macrophages. hz mediates peroxidation
of unsaturated fatty acids production bioactive aldehydes as
4-hydroxynonenal (hne). hz-laden human monocytes inhibited growth cocultivated
human erythroid cells produced hne diffused adjacent cells generating
hne-protein adducts. cocultivation hz treatment low micromolar hne
inhibited growth erythroid cells interfering cell cycle without
apoptosis. hz/hne treatment, 2 critical proteins cell-cycle regulation, 
p53 p21, increased retinoblastoma protein, central regulator 
g‚ÇÅ-to-s-phase transition, consequently hypophosphorylated, gata-1,
master transcription factor erythropoiesis reduced. resultant
decreased expression cyclin d2 retarded cell-cycle progression in
erythroid cells k562 cell line. second major effect, hz hne
inhibited protein expression crucial receptors (r): transferrinr1, stem cell
factorr, interleukin-3r, erythropoietinr. reduced receptor expression and
the impaired cell-cycle activity decreased production cells expressing
glycophorin-a hemoglobin. present data confirm inhibitory role hz,
identify hne one hz-generated inhibitory molecule describe molecular
targets hne erythroid progenitors possibly involved erythropoiesis
