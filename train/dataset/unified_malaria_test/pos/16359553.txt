background: malaria afflicts 300-500 million people causing 1 million deaths
globally per year. immunopathogenesis malaria mediated partly co
mplex cellular immunomodulator interactions involving co-regulators as
cytokines adhesion molecules. however, role chemokines their
receptors malaria immunopathology remains unclear. rantes (regulated on
activation normal t-cell expressed secreted) chemokine involved the
generation inflammatory infiltrates. recent studies indicate the
degradation cell-cell junctions, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, recruitment 
of leukocytes plasmodium-infected erythrocytes occlusion of
microvessels relevant malaria pathogenesis associated rantes
expression. additionally, activated lymphocytes, platelets endothelial cells 
release large quantities rantes, thus suggesting unique role rantes in
the generation maintenance malaria-induced inflammatory response. 
hypothesis study rantes corresponding receptors (ccr1,
ccr3 ccr5) modulate malaria immunopathogenesis. murine malaria model was
utilized evaluate role chemokine receptors malaria.
methods: alterations immunomodulator gene expression brains of
plasmodium yoelii 17xl-infected mice analysed using cdna microarray
screening, followed temporal comparison mrna protein expression of
rantes corresponding receptors qrt-pcr western blot analysis,
respectively. plasma rantes levels determined elisa ultrastructural
studies brain sections infected uninfected mice conducted.
results: rantes (p < 0.002), ccr1 (p < 0.036), ccr3 (p < 0.033), ccr5 (p <
0.026) mrna significantly upregulated peak parasitaemia remained high
thereafter experimental mouse model. rantes protein brain of
infected mice upregulated (p < 0.034) compared controls. rantes plasma
levels significantly upregulated; two three fold infected mice
compared controls (p < 0.026). distal microvascular endothelium in
infected cerebellum appeared degraded, remained intact controls.
conclusion: upregulation rantes, ccr1, ccr3, ccr5 mrna, rantes
protein mediate inflammation cellular degradation cerebellum p.
