intravenous administration novel recombinant rhesus mab α4β7
gut-homing integrin (mab) rhesus macaques prior acute siv
infection resulted significant decrease plasma gastrointestinal (gi)
tissue viral load marked reduction gi tissue proviral dna load as
compared control siv-infected rhesus macaques. mab administration was
associated increases peripheral blood naive central memory cd4(+) t
cells maintenance high frequency ccr5(+)cd4(+) cells. additionally,
such mab administration inhibited mobilization nk cells plasmacytoid
dendritic cells characteristically seen control animals acute
infection accompanied inhibition synthesis mip-3α gut
tissues. data concert suggest blocking gi trafficking cd4(+) t
cells inhibiting mobilization cell lineages innate immune
system may powerful new tool protect gi tissues modulate acute
lentiviral infection.
