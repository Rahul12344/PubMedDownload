background: plasmodium parasites unable synthesize purines de novo and
have salvage host. due limitation parasite,
purine transporters area focus search anti-malarial
drugs. although uptake purines human equilibrative nucleoside 
transporter (hent1), human facilitative nucleobase transporter (hfnt1) and
the parasite-induced new permeation pathway (npp) studied, no
information appears exist relative contribution three
transporters uptake adenosine hypoxanthine. using appropriate
transporter inhibitors, role salvage pathways overall
purine transport intraerythrocytic plasmodium falciparum systematically
investigated.
methods: transport adenosine, hypoxanthine adenine uninfected and
p. falciparum-infected human erythrocytes investigated presence or
absence classical inhibitors hfnt1, hent1 npp. effective
inhibition various transporters classical inhibitors verified
using appropriate known substrates. ability high concentration of
unlabelled substrates saturate transporters also studied.
results: transport exogenous purine infected uninfected erythrocytes
occurred primarily saturable transporters rather npp.
hypoxanthine adenine appeared enter erythrocytes mainly hfnt1 
nucleobase transporter whereas adenosine entered predominantly hent1 
nucleoside transporter. rate purine uptake approximately doubled in
infected cells compared uninfected erythrocytes. addition, found
that rate adenosine uptake considerably higher rate of
hypoxanthine uptake infected human red blood cells (rbc). also
demonstrated furosemide inhibited transport purine bases through
hfnt1.
conclusion: collectively, data obtained study clearly show the
endogenous host erythrocyte transporters hent1 hfnt1, rather npp,
are major route entry purine parasitized rbc. inhibitors hent1 
and hfnt1, well npp, considered development of
anti-malarials targeted purine transport.
