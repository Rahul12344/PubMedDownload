recent technical advances broadened understanding processes that
govern mammalian cell migration health disease many molecular
and morphological alterations precede accompany movement cells - in
particular three-dimensional (3d) environments - still incompletely
understood. manuscript, using high-resolution time-lapse microscopy
imaging approaches, describe morphodynamic processes rounded/amoeboid
cell invasion molecules associated cellular invasion structures. 
used macrophages infected intracellular protozoan parasite theileria
annulata, causes tropical theileriosis susceptible ruminants as
domestic cattle. t. annulata transforms host cell that, result, acquires
many characteristics human cancer cells including markedly increased
potential migrate, disseminate expand body host animal.
hence, virulence disease associated capability infected
cells disseminate inside host. using t. annulata-transformed macrophages
as model system, described novel mode rounded/amoeboid macrophage
migration. show filopodia-like membrane extensions leading edge

that exploits actin-driven filopodia formation combination with
pressure-driven membrane blebs.
