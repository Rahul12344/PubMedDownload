the influence acute dietary protein restriction development babesia 
microti infection mouse model investigated. female mice consuming a
diet either devoid protein adequate respect protein infected
with b. microti-parasitized erythrocytes sacrificed 7 days later. absence 
dietary protein resulted delay onset infection significantly
reduced peak parasitemia. non-specific antibody responses heterologous
erythrocytes specific anti-babesial antibody titers impaired mice
consuming protein-free diets, suggesting enhanced resistance to
experimental babesiosis observed protein-malnourished mice an
antibody-mediated phenomenon. addition, protein-malnourished mice not

mice consuming diets. mechanism acute protein deprivation
protects mice lethal babesiosis remains determined.
