hospitalization followed recovery (n=56); treatment outpatient
(n=32). serum cortisol acth concentrations significantly higher the
dogs died, compared hospitalized dogs survived compared dogs 
treated outpatients. serum t4 free t4 concentrations significantly
lower dogs died, compared hospitalized dogs survived
