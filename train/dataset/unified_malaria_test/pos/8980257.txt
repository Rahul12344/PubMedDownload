different parameters fibrinolytic systems like t-pa, pai, d-dimer, and
inhibitors blood coagulation, i.e., protein c (pc), protein s(ps), and
antithrombin iii (at-iii), studied cases acute malaria due to
plasmodium falciparum plasmodium vivax infection, patients were
followed up. observed plasma pai-1 high cases p.
falciparum malaria infection compared normal controls p. vivax
infection. changes complicated cases p. falciparum remarkable as
compared uncomplicated ones. pc, ps, at-iii levels also low p.
falciparum, particularly complicated cases, normal p. vivax
infection. factor viii r:ag levels invariably high acute malaria. 
follow-up cases values came back normal the
antiparasite treatment. monocyte procoagulant activity found be
significantly higher p. falciparum infection compared p. vivax
infection. findings therefore contribute towards production a
hypercoagulable state p. falciparum infection partly explain the
complications p. falciparum infection like cerebral malaria.
