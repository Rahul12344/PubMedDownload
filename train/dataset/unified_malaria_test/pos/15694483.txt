parasitophorous vacuole formation critical step successful invasion 
of host erythrocytes malaria parasite. rhoptry proteins believed to
have essential roles vacuole formation, although biological roles are
poorly understood. understand molecular interactions parasite
rhoptry proteins erythrocyte invasion, characterized the
binding specificity high molecular mass rhoptry protein (rhoph) complex to
erythrocytes using rodent malaria parasite, plasmodium yoelii. rhoph complex 
binding erythrocytes species-specific, observed mouse rabbit 
or human erythrocytes. binding abolished following treatment erythrocytes
with trypsin chymotrypsin. host cell cholesterol-rich membrane domains
are recruited nascent parasitophorous vacuole, evaluated possible
role rhoph complex binding cholesterol-rich membrane domain-associated 
glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (gpi)-anchored protein. using chimeric mice
harboring gpi-deficient erythrocytes, rhoph complex binding gpi-deficient
mouse erythrocytes undetectable, indicating involvement gpi-anchored
protein pyrhoph complex binding. furthermore, significant reduction p.
yoelii parasite infection gpi-deficient erythrocytes observed vivo,
probably due inefficient invasion. conclude major erythrocyte
receptor pyrhoph complex protein attached erythrocyte surface via
gpi-anchor gpi-deficient erythrocytes resistant p. yoelii
invasion.
