to investigate influence plasmodium falciparum malaria plasma
antioxidants lipid peroxidation, plasma ascorbate, urate, total protein and
albumin, ceruloplasmin malondialdehyde (mda) determined two groups of
42 patients each, one mild severe falciparum malaria, and
in equal number age- sex-matched control subjects. plasma mda found
to significantly higher malaria patients, increase proportional
to severity disease. antioxidants, ascorbate albumin
decreased severity disease urate ceruloplasmin increased. 
ascorbate correlated inversely mda mild (r = -0.341, p < 0.05) and
severe malaria (r = 0.545, p < 0.01). plasma albumin correlated inversely
(r = -0.442, p < 0.01), urate ceruloplasmin correlated directly (r = 0.419, p
< 0.01 r = 0.349, p < 0.05, respectively) patients severe
malaria. antioxidants also correlated well markers disease
severity, indicating influence disease severity regulating levels
in plasma. presence significant quantities ascorbate albumin, along
with increases antioxidants mda, indicates
ineffectiveness antioxidant defense system controlling plasma lipid
peroxide content. increased amounts thiobarbituric acid-reactive material
could result spillover increased tissue peroxidation the
presence pro-oxidants malarial plasma.
