malaria important human parasitic disease cerebral malaria (cm), 
its main neurological complication, characterized neurological and
cognitive damage human animal survivors. brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (bdnf) appears involved activity-dependent
synaptic plasticity. great interest regarding role learning and
memory well acetylcholinesterase activity (ache) implicated many
cognitive functions probably plays important roles neurodegenerative
disorders. present work, evaluated bdnf protein levels ache
activity hippocampus habituation animal model cm using
c57bl/6 mice fifteen days induction. results demonstrated that
there decrease bdnf levels hippocampus c57bl/6 mice infected
with pba compared c57bl/6 non-infected mice c57bl/6 non-infected
mice received treatment chloroquine. however, difference was
observed ache activity hippocampus. habituation evaluated
there memory impairment c57bl/6 mice infected plasmodium berghei 
anka (pba). conclusion, believe decreased bdnf levels the
hippocampus may related memory impairment without alterations ache
activity.
