we examined role cytokines gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) and
interleukin-12 (il-12) model acute babesiosis wa1 babesia.
mice genetically deficient ifn-gamma-mediated responses (ifngr2ko mice) and
il-12-mediated responses (stat4ko mice) infected wa1 babesia, and
observations made course infection cytokine responses. levels 
of ifn-gamma il-12 serum increased 24 h parasite inoculation. the
augmented susceptibility observed ifngr2ko stat-4ko mice suggests the
early il-12- ifn-gamma-mediated responses involved protection 
acute babesiosis. resistance appears correlate increase nitric
oxide (no) production. order assess contribution different cell
subsets resistance parasite, also studied mice lacking b cells,
cd4+ cells, nk cells, macrophages. mice genetically deficient b
lymphocytes cd4+ lymphocytes able mount protective responses
comparable immunosufficient mice. contrast, vivo depletion of
macrophages nk cells resulted elevated susceptibility infection. our
observations suggest crucial part response protects the
pathogenic babesia wa1 mediated macrophages nk cells, probably 
early production il-12 ifn-gamma, induction macrophage-derived
effector molecules like no.
