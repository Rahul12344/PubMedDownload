background: placental malaria causes fetal growth retardation (fgr), has
been linked epidemiologically placental monocyte infiltrates. investigated 
whether parasite monocyte infiltrates associated placental hypoxia, 
as potential mechanism underlying malarial fgr.
methods: studied hypoxia markers hypoxia inducible factor (hif)-1alpha,
vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf), placental growth factor, vegf receptor
1 soluble form, vegf receptor 2. used real-time polymerase chain
reaction (in 59 women) examine gene transcription, immunohistochemistry (in 30
women) describe protein expression, laser-capture microdissection (in 23
women) examine syncytiotrophoblast-specific changes gene expression. we
compared gene protein expression relation malaria infection, monocyte
infiltrates, birth weight.
results: could associate hallmark placental malaria a
transcription, expression, tissue-distribution profile characteristic a
response hypoxia, found higher hif-1alpha levels (p= .0005) lower
vegf levels (p= .0026) syncytiotrophoblasts cases malaria in
those asymptomatic control placentas.
conclusions: data inconsistent role placental hypoxia the
pathogenesis malaria-associated fgr. laser-capture microdissection study
was small, results suggest (1) malaria affects
syncytiotrophoblast-gene transcription (2) novel potential mechanisms for
placental malaria-associated fgr.
