malaria, caused members genus plasmodia, still prevalent
parasitic disease world. attempt understand genetic factors
conferring resistance malaria, mouse models thalassemia, sickle trait, 
ankyrin spectrin deficiency studied infection species of
malaria infectious rodents. although growth p. falciparum inhibited 
in thalassemic erythrocytes culture, mice carrying beta-thalassemia mutation
were protected plasmodium chabaudi adami, supporting epidemiologic findings.
transgenic mice expressing beta hemoglobin also significantly protected
from two species rodent malaria. importantly, significant role the
spleen protection beta transgenic mice found. finally, mice
deficient spectrin ankyrin studied respect ability to
support growth malaria. found spectrin deficient mice were
almost completely refractory p. chabaudi adami p. berghei. models
will allow study host factors resistance malaria.
