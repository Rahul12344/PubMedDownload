the controlled induction haemoxygenase-1 (ho-1), enzyme catabolizes
haem, shown reduce haem, preventing pathologies associated haem 
toxicity. hemoglobin genotype hbas confers reduced susceptibility severe
complications malaria mechanism well understood. using a
longitudinal approach, investigated effect baseline concentrations of
ho-1 accumulation haem acute plasmodium falciparum malaria in
hbas hbaa genotypes. plasma concentrations haem, ho-1 cytokines were
quantified venous blood obtained children (9 months-5 years age)
during malaria infection, convalescence (baseline levels). parasitaemia
was determined malaria infection. patients hbaa genotype,
there significant elevation plasma concentration haem
(p = 0.002), consequent increased induction ho-1 (p < 0.001) during
falciparum malaria compared levels convalescence. contrary hbaa,
plasma concentration haem change hbas genotypical group
(p = 0·110), induction ho-1 reduced malaria compared with
levels convalescence (p = 0·006). higher plasma levels haem observed
in hbas compared hbaa convalescence (p = 0·010), difference 
not affect levels ho-1 within genotype (p = 0·450). relatively milder
proinflammatory responses observed hbas children malaria infection
compared hbaa children. findings suggest mechanism reduced
susceptibility severe malaria pathologies hbas genotype may involve the
control haem, leading controlled levels ho-1 milder proinflammatory 
responses acute malaria.
