plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (ama1) located the
merozoite micronemes, organelle contains receptors invasion,
suggesting ama1 may play role process. however, direct evidence
that p. falciparum ama1 binds human erythrocytes lacking. study, we
determined domain iii ama1 binds erythrocyte membrane protein, kx,
and rate invasion kx(null) erythrocytes reduced, indicating a
significant unique role ama1 kx parasite invasion of
erythrocytes. domains i/ii/iii, domains i/ii domain iii ama1 were
expressed surface cho-k1 cells, ability bind erythrocytes 
was determined. observed domains failed bind untreated
human erythrocytes. contrast, domain iii, domains ama1,
bound trypsin-treated human erythrocytes. tested binding ama1 to
trypsin-treated genetically mutant human erythrocytes, missing various
erythrocyte membrane proteins. ama1 failed bind trypsin-treated kx(null)
(mcleod) erythrocytes, lack kx protein. furthermore, treatment human
erythrocytes trypsin, followed alpha-chymotrypsin, cleaved kx and
destroyed binding ama1 human erythrocytes. lastly, rate invasion
of kx null erythrocytes p. falciparum significantly lower than
kx-expressing erythrocytes. taken together, data suggest ama1 plays an
important, exclusive, role invasion human erythrocytes a
process involves exposure modification erythrocyte surface
protein, kx, trypsin-like enzyme.
