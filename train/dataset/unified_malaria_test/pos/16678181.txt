malaria one important global health problems, potentially
affecting one third world's population. cerebral malaria (cm) is
a deadly complication plasmodium falciparum infection, yet pathogenesis
remains incompletely understood. review, discuss principal
pathogenic events described murine models disease and
relate human condition. one earliest events cm pathogenesis
appears mild increase permeability protein blood-brain
barrier. recent studies shown role cd8+t cells mediating damage 
the microvascular endothelium damage result leakage of
cytokines, malaria antigens potentially harmful molecules across the
blood-brain barrier cerebral parenchyma. suggest this, turn, 
leads activation microglia activation apoptosis of
astrocytes. role hypoxia pathogenesis cerebral malaria also
discussed, particular reference local reduction oxygen consumption
in brain consequence vascular obstruction, cytokine-driven changes
in glucose metabolism, cytopathic hypoxia. interferon-gamma, cytokine
known produced malaria infection, induces increased expression, by
microvascular endothelial cells, haem enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, 
the first enzyme kynurenine pathway tryptophan metabolism. enhanced
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expression leads increased production range
of biologically active metabolites may part tissue protective
response. damage astrocytes may result reduced production the
neuroprotectant molecule kynurenic acid, leading decrease ratio
relative neuroexcitotoxic molecule quinolinic acid, might contribute
to neurological symptoms cerebral malaria. lastly, discuss 
role haem enzymes, cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase and
haem oxygenase-1, potentially components mechanisms protect host
tissue effects cytokine- leukocyte-mediated stress induced 
malaria infection.
