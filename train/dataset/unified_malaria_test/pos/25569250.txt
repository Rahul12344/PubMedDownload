plasmodium vivax cause severe malaria, however pathogenesis poorly
understood. contrast p. falciparum, circulating vivax parasitemia low,
with minimal apparent sequestration endothelium-lined microvasculature, and
pathogenesis thought unrelated parasite biomass. however, relationships
between vivax disease-severity total parasite biomass, endothelial autocrine 
activation microvascular dysfunction unknown. measured circulating
parasitemia markers total parasite biomass (plasma parasite lactate
dehydrogenase [pldh] pvldh) adults severe (n = 9) non-severe
(n = 53) vivax malaria, examined relationships disease-severity,
endothelial activation, microvascular function. healthy controls adults
with non-severe severe falciparum malaria enrolled comparison.
median peripheral parasitemia, pvldh pldh 2.4-fold, 3.7-fold and
6.9-fold higher severe compared non-severe vivax malaria (p = 0.02,
p = 0.02 p = 0.015, respectively), suggesting that, falciparum malaria,
peripheral p. vivax parasitemia underestimates total parasite biomass,
particularly severe disease. p. vivax schizonts under-represented in
peripheral blood. severe vivax malaria associated increased
angiopoietin-2 impaired microvascular reactivity. peripheral vivax
parasitemia correlated endothelial activation (angiopoietin-2,
von-willebrand-factor [vwf], e-selectin), whereas markers total vivax biomass 
correlated systemic inflammation (il-6, il-10). activity the
vwf-cleaving-protease, adamts13, deficient proportion endothelial
activation, il-6, thrombocytopenia vivax disease-severity, associated
with impaired microvascular reactivity severe disease. impaired microvascular 
reactivity correlated lactate severe vivax malaria. findings suggest that
tissue accumulation p. vivax may occur, hidden biomass greatest in
severe disease capable mediating systemic inflammatory pathology. lack
of association total parasite biomass endothelial activation is
consistent accumulation parts circulation devoid endothelium.
endothelial activation, associated circulating parasites, systemic
inflammation may contribute pathology vivax malaria, microvascular
dysfunction likely contributing impaired tissue perfusion.
