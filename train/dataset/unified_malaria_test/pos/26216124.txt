after delivered bite infected mosquito, plasmodium
sporozoites enter blood circulation infect liver. previous evidence
suggests kupffer cells, macrophage-like component liver blood
vessel lining, traversed sporozoites initiate liver invasion. however, 
the molecular determinants sporozoite-kupffer cell interactions unknown.
understanding molecular basis specific recognition may lead novel
therapeutic strategies control malaria. using phage display library screen, 
we identified peptide, p39, strongly binds kupffer cell surface
and, importantly, inhibits sporozoite kupffer cell entry. furthermore, we
determined p39 binds cd68, putative receptor sporozoite invasion of
kupffer cells acts gateway malaria infection liver.
