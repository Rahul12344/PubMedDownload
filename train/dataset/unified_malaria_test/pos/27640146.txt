plasmodium berghei anka infection c57bl/6 mice widely used model of
experimental cerebral malaria (ecm). contrast, nonneurotropic p. berghei
nk65 (pbn) causes severe malarial disease c57bl/6 mice cause ecm.
previous studies suggest endothelin-1 (et-1) contributes pathogenesis
of ecm. study, characterize role et-1 ecm vascular
dysfunction. mice infected 106 pbn-parasitized red blood cells treated 
with either et-1 saline 2 to 8 days postinfection (dpi). plasmodium
berghei anka-infected mice served positive control. et-1-treated
pbn-infected mice exhibited neurological signs, hypothermia, behavioral
alterations characteristic ecm, dying 4 8 dpi. parasitemia affected
by et-1 treatment. saline-treated pbn-infected mice display ecm,
surviving 12 dpi. et-1-treated pbn-infected mice displayed leukocyte
adhesion vascular endothelia petechial hemorrhages throughout the
brain 6 dpi. intravital microscopic images demonstrated significant brain
arteriolar vessel constriction, decreased functional capillary density, and
increased blood-brain barrier permeability. alterations present in
either et-1-treated uninfected saline-treated pbn-infected mice. summary,
et-1 treatment pbn-infected mice induced ecm-like syndrome, causing brain
vasoconstriction, adherence activated leukocytes cerebral
microvasculature, blood-brain barrier leakage, indicating et-1 is
involved genesis brain microvascular alterations that are hallmark 
of ecm.
