babesiosis common tick borne disease dogs tropical subtropical
regions world caused different species babesia. present study
aimed examine erythrocyte lipid peroxide erythrocytic antioxidant levels
in dogs clinical babesiosis, caused babesia gibsoni, impact the
disease blood iron, zinc copper levels. study conducted 10
naturally occurring cases canine babesiosis history tick
infestation, erratic pyrexia, prolonged illness. microscopic examination of
giemsa stained peripheral blood smears confirmed b. gibsoni infection the
erythrocytes. six apparently healthy dogs different age, sex breeds,
brought either health checkup vaccination used comparison. levels
of erythrocytic antioxidant enzymes significantly (p<0.01) higher sick
dogs cytologically negative dogs (catalase: 0.192+/-0.024 units/mg 
hb vs 0.074+/-0.004 units/mg hb; superoxide dismutase: 0.014+/-0.0009 units/mg hb
vs 0.006+/-0.0008 units/mg hb lipid peroxide: 6.01+/-0.30 nmol mda/mg hb vs
1.89+/-0.10 nmol mda/mg hb). levels blood micronutrients were
significantly low dogs (iron: 89.87+/-8.12 microg/g vs 126.44+/-14.65
microg/g; zinc: 3.67+/-1.85 microg/g vs 5.62+/-1.83 microg/g copper:
0.55+/-0.63 microg/g vs 0.65+/-0.04 microg/g). study demonstrated oxidative
damage dogs naturally infected b. gibsoni. low level blood iron, zinc 
and copper seems additional role genesis anaemia and
oxidative stress.
