background: iron deficiency (id) major cause anemia, along other
nutritional, parasitic, genetic factors. accurate biomarkers needed to
estimate relative contribution id anemia. soluble transferrin receptor 
(stfr) thought unaffected inflammation.
objectives: objectives determine difference stfr plasma
ferritin (pf) concentrations among infants (6-23 mo age), school-age children 
(6-8 age), women (15-25 age) without inflammation with
and without plasmodium falciparum infection assess effect adjusting
stfr pf inflammation p. falciparum infection estimated
prevalence id.
design: data derived 14-mo prospective longitudinal survey on
anemia, conducted taabo area, south-central côte d'ivoire.
results: baseline, stfr concentration significantly higher infants 
school-age children either inflammation p. falciparum infection in
control individuals without inflammation without p. falciparum infection.
individuals inflammation significantly higher pf concentrations did
subjects without inflammation. adjustments stfr concentrations for
inflammation p. falciparum infection infants school-age children
resulted significantly lower id prevalence. adjustment pf inflammation 
and plasmodium infection resulted higher id prevalence infants women.
conclusions: ivorian infants school-age children, id prevalence was
considerably lower adjustment stfr inflammation. however, the
prevalence estimates id differed widely based stfr pf, caution is
still needed estimating id prevalence areas high prevalence of
inflammation malaria. trial registered controlled-trials.com as
