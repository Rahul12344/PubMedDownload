the present study aimed assess antioxidant status oxidative stress in
sheep naturally infected babesia ovis. red blood cell (rbc) count,
hemoglobin (hb) concentration, packed cell volume (pcv), piroplasm parasitemia
percentage, malondialdehyde (mda) concentration, erythrocyte superoxide dismutase
(sod), glutathione peroxidase (gsh-px), catalase (cat) activities total
antioxidant capacity (tac) determined 52 sheep naturally infected b.
ovis well number healthy sheep west-azerbaijan province, iran.
microscopic examination giemsa-stained peripheral blood smears revealed b.
ovis infection. parasitological diagnosis confirmed using polymerase
chain reaction (pcr) analysis amplifying partial small subunit ribosomal rna
(ssu rrna) gene sequence b. ovis 52 diseased sheep, 18 (34.61%), 11
(21.15%), 16 (30.76%) 7 (13.48%) <1%, 1-2%, 2-3% >3% parasitemia,
respectively. compared controls, activities erythrocyte gsh-px, sod,
tac cat showed significant decrease, whereas concentration mda in
erythrocytes infected sheep increased significantly. parasitemia rate was
positively correlated mda negatively correlated pcv, sod, cat,
gsh-px tac. also, mda negatively correlated pcv, sod, catalase,
gsh-px tac. study demonstrated b. ovis plays important role in
the occurrence oxidative damage rbcs anemia ovine babesiosis.
