the past 10 years generated new insights complex interaction
between cd36 (cluster differentiation 36) malaria. range the
crystallization cd36 homolog, limpii (lysosomal integral membrane protein 
ii), permitting modeling cd36 binding diverse ligands, cell
biology-based studies cd36 large population genetic studies assessing 
association cd36 polymorphisms malarial disease severity. collectively
these lines evidence indicate receptor cd36 associated
with severity. cd36 plays important role innate immunity the
phagocytic uptake multiple pathogens including malaria. cd36 polymorphisms
lack association severity, isolates cause severe disease primarily 
bind endothelial protein c receptor (epcr) rather cd36.
