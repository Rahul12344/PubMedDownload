the serum acid phosphatase (acp) activity hemoglobin (hb) levels were
measured malaria patients nonmalarial fever patients. results were
compared normal healthy control subjects. acp significantly increased
(p < 0.001) malaria patients. acp significantly higher in
plasmodium falcifarum malaria mixed malaria compared plasmodium vivax
malaria. hb levels significantly decreased malaria patients which
indicates malaria parasite uses host erythrocyte hb major nutrient
source. negative correlation(r = -0.478) acp hb malaria
patients, highly significant. results suggest measurement
of acp could used marker malaria.electronic supplementary material:
