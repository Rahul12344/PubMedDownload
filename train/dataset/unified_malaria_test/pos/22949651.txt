the host mechanisms responsible protection malaria remain poorly
understood, protective genetic effects mapped humans. here, we
characterize host-specific genome-wide signature whole-blood transcriptomes 
of plasmodium falciparum-infected west african children report a
demonstration genotype-by-infection interactions vivo. several associations
involve transcripts sensitive infection implicate complement system,
antigen processing presentation, t-cell activation (i.e., slc39a8, c3ar1,
fcgr3b, rad21, retn, lrrc25, slc3a2, tapbp), including one association that
validated genome-wide association candidate gene (sco1), implicating binding
variation within noncoding regulatory element. gene expression profiles mice
infected plasmodium chabaudi revealed validated similar responses and
highlighted specific pathways genes likely important responders in
both hosts. results suggest host variation interplay with
infection affect children's ability cope infection suggest a
polygenic model mounted transcriptional level susceptibility.
