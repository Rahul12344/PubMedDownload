infection cattle protozoan theileria parva results uncontrolled 
lymphocyte proliferation resulting lesions resembling multicentric lymphoma.
parasitized cells exhibit autocrine growth characterized persistent
translocation transcriptional regulatory factor nuclear factor kappab
(nfkappab) nucleus consequent enhanced expression interleukin 2 and
the interleukin 2 receptor. t. parva induces persistent nfkappab activation, 
required cell activation proliferation, unknown. hypothesized
that parasite induces degradation ikappab molecules normally
sequester nfkappab cytoplasm continuous degradation requires
viable parasites. using t. parva-infected cells, showed parasite
mediates continuous phosphorylation proteolysis ikappabalpha. however,
ikappabalpha reaccumulated high levels parasitized cells, indicated
that t. parva alter normal nfkappab-mediated positive feedback loop
which restores cytoplasmic ikappabalpha. contrast, t. parva mediated
continuous degradation ikappabbeta resulting persistently low cytoplasmic
ikappabbeta levels. normal ikappabbeta levels restored following t.
parva killing, indicating viable parasites required ikappabbeta
degradation. treatment t. parva-infected cells pyrrolidine
dithiocarbamate, metal chelator, blocked ikappab degradation and
consequent enhanced expression nfkappab dependent genes. however treatment
using antioxidant n-acetylcysteine effect either ikappab levels 
nfkappab activation, indicating parasite subverts normal ikappab
regulatory pathway downstream requirement reactive oxygen
intermediates. identification critical points regulated t. parva may
provide new approaches disease control well increase understanding 
of normal cell function.
