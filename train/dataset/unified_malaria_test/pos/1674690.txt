acute p. falciparum malaria associated loss vitro cell
responsiveness antigenic stimulation, high plasma levels soluble
interleukin 2 receptor (il 2r). present study peripheral cells from
acute p. falciparum malaria patients malaria-endemic area sudan were
analyzed expression cell surface antigens associated lymphocyte
adhesion, activation maturation. results compared results 
cells obtained donors either attack, during
convalescence. donors showed remarkable loss cells high
expression surface marker lfa-1 (cd11a/cd18) clinical episode, 
in addition functional changes described above. two donors not
show phenotypic changes furthermore characterized unabated
proliferative response normal plasma il 2r levels. peripheral cd3+ t
lymphocytes expressed lfa-1, clearly bimodal distribution these
cells. cell subpopulation high lfa-1 expression (lfa-1++) was
composed memory unprimed cells, according expression of
cd45ra cd45r0. analysis expression membrane-bound il 2r (cd25) and
icam-1 (cd54) reveal vivo activated cells peripheral blood of
the patients. taken together, data suggest circulating cells
recognizing parasite antigens temporarily withdrawn peripheral
circulation p. falciparum malaria.
