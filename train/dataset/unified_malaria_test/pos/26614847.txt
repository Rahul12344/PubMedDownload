the aim study investigate role s180l polymorphism in
modulation acquisition malaria caused plasmodium falciparum small
group pakistani population. total 133 individuals including 60 controls
and 73 patients malaria, caused plasmodium falciparum, genotyped using
allele-specific pcr. ninety-two samples successfully demonstrated pcr
amplification results, forty-one samples could genotyped due to
failure pcr amplification. allele frequency s180l polymorphism was
deviant hardy-weinberg equilibrium (hwe) population under
observation. association found observed polymorphism the
occurrence malaria caused plasmodium falciparum (p = 0.01). chances of
malaria caused plasmodium falciparum low cc genotype carriers in
comparison genotypes (odds ratio: 0.3016; 95% ci: 0.124-0.729). the
present findings suggest s180l polymorphism important modulating the
probability acquisition malaria caused plasmodium falciparum in
pakistani population. cc genotype plays protective role local population
against type malaria.
