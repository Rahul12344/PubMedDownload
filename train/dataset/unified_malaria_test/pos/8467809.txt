theileria parva obligate, intracellular, parasitic protozoan causes
east coast fever, acute leukemia-like disease cattle. t. parva the
related parasite, theileria annulata, unique among protozoa their
intralymphocytic stages induce transformation bovid lymphocytes. comparison of

furthermore, marked increase ckii antigen observed western blots of
