in patients uncomplicated plasmodium falciparum infection cytokine-mediated 
serum protein levels c-reactive protein (crp), coeruloplasmin (coe), beta
2-microglobulin (b2m), alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (aag), alpha 1-antitrypsin
(aat), haptoglobin (hpt), prealbumin (pre), retinol binding protein (rbp),
albumin (alb) transferrin (trf) measured endemic area the
amazonian rain forest. semi-immune (si) nonimmune (ni) patients were
investigated. patient groups serum concentrations crp, coe b2m
were elevated admission. addition aag aat concentrations increased
in ni patients compared control subjects. significantly lower serum
concentrations hpt, pre, rbp, alb trf seen patient groups
during acute phase disease, pronounced ni patients.
after 28-day follow-up, aat b2m normal si patients hpt, aat and
b2m still significantly altered ni patients.
