neisseria meningitidis commensal human nasopharynx also a
major cause septicemia meningitis. meningococcal factor h binding
protein (fhbp) binds human factor h (fh), enabling downregulation complement

meningococcal vaccines currently clinical development. characterize 12
fhbp subvariants level surface exposure ability bind fh, to
mediate serum resistance, induce bactericidal antibodies. flow cytometry
and western analysis revealed strains examined expressed fhbp their
surface different extents bound fh fhbp-dependent manner. however,
differences fh binding always correlate level fhbp
expression, indicating factor affecting amount of
fh bound. overcome issue strain variability fhbp expression, the
mc58δfhbp strain genetically engineered express different subvariants from
a constitutive heterologous promoter. recombinant strains were
characterized fh binding, data confirmed subvariant binds
different levels fh. surface plasmon resonance revealed differences the
stability fhbp-fh complexes ranged 2 orders magnitude,
indicating differences residues within variant groups can
influence fh binding. interestingly, level survival human sera of
recombinant mc58 strains expressing diverse subvariants correlate with
the level fh binding, suggesting interaction fhbp fh not
the function fhbp influences serum resistance. furthermore,
cross-reactive bactericidal activity seen within variant group, although
the degree activity varied, suggesting amino acid differences within each
variant group influence bactericidal antibody response.
