background: cerebral malaria (cm) severe complication malaria with
considerable mortality. addition acute encephalopathy, survivors frequently
suffer neurological sequelae. pathogenesis incompletely understood,
hampering development effective, adjunctive therapy, not
available present. previously, erythropoietin (epo) reported to
significantly improve survival outcome murine cm model. study
objectives assess myelin thickness ultrastructural morphology 
corpus callosum murine cm adress effects epo treatment this
context.
methods: study consisted two groups plasmodium berghei-infected mice
and two groups uninfected controls either treated epo or
placebo (n = 4 mice/group). terminal phase murine cm brains were
removed processed electron microscopy. myelin sheaths corpus
callosum analysed transmission electron microscopy stereology.
results: infection caused clinical cm, counteracted epo. the
total number myelinated axons identical four groups mice with
cm reduced mean thickness myelin sheaths. instead, cm mice
had significantly increased numbers abnormal myelin sheaths, whereas
epo-treated mice indistinguishable uninfected mice. furthermore, mice
with cm frequent severe axonal injury, pseudopodic endothelial cells,
perivascular oedemas intracerebral haemorrhages.
conclusions: epo treatment reduced clinical signs cm reduced cerebral
pathology. murine cm reduce general thickness myelin sheaths in
the corpus callosum.
