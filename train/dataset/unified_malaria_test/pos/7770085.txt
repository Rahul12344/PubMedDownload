theileria annulata infects bovine leucocytes results reversible
transformation become immortalised metastatic. present
study describes parasite-induced changes host cell gene expression 
a direct bearing transformation process. t. annulata-infected leucocytes 
produce number novel metalloproteinase activities. one these, previously 
called b1, 97-kda protein secreted large amounts been
purified protein-free, conditioned medium. antiserum enzyme was
used isolate cdna clone. predicted protein sequence b1 81%
identical human matrix metalloproteinase 9 (mmp9), demonstrating is
the bovine homologue enzyme. rnaase protection assays demonstrated that
the mmp9 activity, unique infected cells, due increased mmp9 mrna
levels. also assayed levels transcription factor ap-1 demonstrated 
that constitutively present increased amounts theileria-infected
cells. addition assayed level mrna encoding c-fos, common
component ap-1 observed indeed up-regulated infected cells.
since ap-1 implicated control cell cycle, mmp9 confer
metastatic properties, results considerable significance with
respect transformed phenotype induced theileria infection.
