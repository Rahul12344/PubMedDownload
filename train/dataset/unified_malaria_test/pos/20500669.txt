dendritic cells (dc) macrophages phagocytose pathogens degrade in
their phagosomes allow proper presentation foreign antigens other
cells immune system. plasmodium parasite, causative agent malaria, 
infects rbc phagocytosed dc macrophages course of
infection. specific conditions, functionality cells be
affected phagocytosis plasmodium-infected rbc. investigated whether
phagosomal maturation degradation plasmodium yoelii-infected rbc in
phagosomes affected dc macrophages. show recruitment the
phagolysosomal marker lamp-1 mhc-ii, well acidification of
phagosomes, achieved timely manner. using p. yoelii-infected rbc
labelled fluorescent dye transgenic green fluorescent protein
(gfp)-expressing parasites, found gradual, rapid decrease phagosome
fluorescence signal, indicating p. yoelii-infected rbc efficiently
degraded macrophages dc. also observed pre-incubation dc with
infected rbc affect phagosomal maturation newly internalized p.
yoelii-infected rbc. conclusion, phagocytosis, plasmodium-infected rbc
are degraded dc macrophages, suggesting process phagosomal
maturation effectively completed malaria.
