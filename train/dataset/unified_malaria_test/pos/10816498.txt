with aim developing appropriate vitro model sequestration 
developing plasmodium falciparum sexual-stage parasites, investigated the
cytoadherence gametocytes human bone marrow cells stromal and
endothelial origin. developing stage iii iv gametocytes, mature stage
v gametocytes, adhere bone marrow cells significantly higher densities than
do asexual-stage parasites, although adhesion densities severalfold
lower encountered classical cd36-dependent assays p. falciparum 
cytoadherence. implies developing gametocytes undergo transition from
high-avidity, cd36-mediated adhesion stages ii lower-avidity
adhesion stages iii iv. show adhesion cd36
independent, fixation sensitive, stimulated tumor necrosis factor alpha, and
dependent divalent cations serum components. data suggest that
gametocytes asexual parasites utilize distinct sets receptors adhesion
during development respective sequestered niches. identify receptors 
for gametocyte-specific adhesion infected erythrocytes bone marrow cells,
we tested large panel antibodies ability inhibit cytoadherence.
our results implicate icam-1, cd49c, cd166, cd164 candidate bone marrow
cell receptors gametocyte adhesion.
