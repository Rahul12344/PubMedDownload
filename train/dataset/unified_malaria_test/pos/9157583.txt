thrombocytopenia common finding malaria. clinical trials, recombinant 
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (m-csf) causes reversible, dose-dependent 
thrombocytopenia, high m-csf reported autoimmune
thrombocytopenias. p-selectin, secreted plasma following
platelet/endothelial activation damage, elevated certain consumptive
thrombocytopenic disorders. relationships thrombocytopenia, m-csf and
p-selectin analysed 63 patients severe (n = 13) uncomplicated (n 
= 26) p. falciparum (pf) p. vivax (pv) malaria (n = 24). admission, 69% 
pf patients 75% pv patients thrombocytopenic (platelets < 150 x
10(9)/l). m-csf elevated pf (3021 +/- 1844 pg/ml) pv (2602 +/- 1668
pg/ml) patients, compared controls (589 +/- 200 pg/ml). platelet count was
inversely correlated m-csf pf (r = -0.681), pv malaria (r =
-0.548). elevated p-selectin found severe pf malaria, pv
malaria. severe pf malaria associated marked thrombocytopenia, high
m-csf, elevated p-selectin compelling evidence disseminated intravascular 
coagulopathy (dic). platelet counts, m-csf p-selectin returned control
values 7-14 days. data suggest elevated m-csf malaria, by
enhancing macrophage activity, may result increased macrophage-mediated
platelet destruction. further, platelet/endothelial activation damage, as
measured p-selectin, dic could intensify thrombocytopenia severe pf
malaria, appear contribute thrombocytopenia uncomplicated
pf pv malaria.
