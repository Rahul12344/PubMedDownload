activation casein kinase ii (ck2) one first observations made on
how theileria parasites manipulate host cell signal transduction pathways 
argue ck2 induction may fact contribute many different
activation events described since 1993 theileria-infected
lymphocytes sustained activation transcription factors c-myc and
nf-kappab. ck2 also contributes infected lymphocyte survival inhibiting
caspase activation probably behind constitutive pi3-k activation by
phosphorylating pten. finally, also discuss ck2a may act a
kinase, also stimulatory subunit protein phosphatase pp2a, so
dampening mek/erk akt/pkb pathways reasons we
propose ck2 central player theileria-induced lymphocyte transformation.
