biochemical abnormalities observed canine babesiosis related the
severity disease. primary biochemical abnormalities found affected 
dogs are: increase serum activity transaminases alkaline
phosphatase, azotemia, hypoglycemia. purposes study were: 1) to
estimate biochemical abnormalities dogs infected large babesia warsaw 
and 2) evaluate statistically changes observed canine babesiosis in
dogs warsaw. samples serum collected dogs naturally infected
with large babesia. among 2023 positive samples, 202 randomly selected.
alanine aminotransferase (alt), aspartate aminotransferase (ast), alkaline
phosphatase (alp), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (bun), total serum protein
(tsp), albumin blood glucose concentration determined clinical
chemistry analyser. elevated activity alt, ast alp detected
accordingly in: 64.9, 92.6 31.7% dogs. elevated creatinine concentration
and bun detected accordingly 30.7 62.4% dogs. decrease tsp,
albumin, bun, hypoglycemia detected accordingly in: 19.8, 32.7, 1.5 and
18.3% dogs. common biochemical abnormalities found affected dogs
were: increase activity transaminases alp, elevated creatinine
concentration, hypoalbuminemia hypoglycemia. abnormalities resulted
from hepatopathy, renal failure fasting.
