background: shown previously possible obtain growth 
plasmodium falciparum human erythrocytes grafted mice lacking adaptive
immune responses controlling, certain extent, innate defences with
liposomes containing clodronate (clo-lip). however, reproducibility 
models limited, proportion animals supporting longstanding
parasitemia, due strong inflammation induced p. falciparum. optimisation of
the model much needed study new anti-malarial drugs, drug
combinations, candidate vaccines.
materials/methods: investigated possibility improving previous models
by employing intravenous route (iv) delivery human erythrocytes
(hurbc) p. falciparum, instead intraperitoneal route (ip), testing 
various immunosuppressive drugs might help control innate mouse defences,
and exploring potential benefits using immunodeficient mice with
additional genetic defects, il-2rγ deficiency (nsg mice).
results: demonstrate role aging, inosine il-2
receptor γ mutation controlling p. falciparum induced inflammation. iv
delivery hurbc p. falciparum clo-lip treated nsg mice led successful
infection 100% inoculated mice, rapid rise parasitemia high levels
(up 40%), long-lasting parasitemia, consistent results from
mouse-to-mouse. characteristics closer human infection previous
models, evidence synchronisation, partial sequestration, receptivity 
to various p. falciparum strains without preliminary adaptation. however, results
show major il-12p70 inflammatory response remains prevalent.
conclusion: combination nsg mouse, clodronate loaded liposomes, iv
delivery hurbc produced reliable relevant model better
meets needs malaria research.
