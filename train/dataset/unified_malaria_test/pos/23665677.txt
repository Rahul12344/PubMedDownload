complex links infection cancer suggest still learn much
about tumorigenesis studying infectious agents hijack host cell
machinery. studied effects intracellular parasite called theileria
that infects bovine leukocytes turns invasive cancer-like cells. we
investigated host cells pathways deregulated infected leukocytes 
and might link infection lymphoproliferative disease. show that
intracellular theileria parasites drive warburg-like phenotype infected host
leukocytes, characterized increased expression metabolic regulators,
increased glucose uptake elevated lactate production, lost when
the parasite eliminated. cohabitation parasites within host
cells leads disruption redox balance (as measured reduced/oxidized
glutathione ratio) elevated ros (reactive oxygen species) levels, associated 
with chronic stabilization hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (hif1α).
inhibition hif1α (pharmacologically genetically), treatment with
antioxidants, led marked reduction expression aerobic glycolytic genes
and inhibited transformed phenotype. data show stabilization of
hif1α, following increased ros production, modulates host glucose metabolism 
is critical parasite-induced transformation. study expands knowledge
about molecular strategy used parasite theileria induce the
transformed phenotypes infected cells via reprogramming glucose metabolism 
and redox signaling.
