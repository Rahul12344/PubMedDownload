the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi) anchors plasmodium falciparum been
proposed major factors contribute malaria pathogenesis 
their ability induce proinflammatory responses. study identified
the receptors p. falciparum gpi-induced cell signaling leads to
proinflammatory responses studied gpi structure-activity relationship.
the data show gpi signaling mediated mainly recognition tlr2
and lesser extent tlr4. activity sn-2-lyso-gpis comparable with
that intact gpis, whereas activity man(3)-gpis 80% of
the intact gpis. gpis three (intact gpis man(3)-gpis) two fatty 
acids (sn-2-lyso-gpis) appear differ considerably requirement the
auxiliary receptor, tlr1 tlr6, recognition tlr2. former are
preferentially recognized tlr2/tlr1, whereas latter favored by
tlr2/tlr6. however, signaling pathways initiated three gpi types are
similar, involving myd88-dependent activation extracellular
signal-regulated kinase, c-jun n-terminal kinase, p38 nf-kappab-signaling
pathways. signaling molecules pathways differentially contribute 
the production various cytokines nitric oxide (zhu, j., krishnegowda, g., 
and gowda, d. c. (2004) j. biol. chem. 280, 8617-8627). data also show that
gpis degraded macrophage surface phospholipases predominantly into
inactive species, indicating host regulate gpi activity least 
part mechanism. results imply macrophage surface
phospholipases play important roles gpi-induced innate immune responses
and malaria pathogenesis.
