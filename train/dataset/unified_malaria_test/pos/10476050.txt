patients infected malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum may develop a
diffuse reversible encephalopathy, termed cerebral malaria. unclear the
intraerythrocytic parasite, sequesters cerebral microvasculature but
does enter brain parenchyma, induces neurological syndrome. adhesion
of parasitized red blood cells brain microvasculature mediated by
specific receptors host endothelium, including intercellular adhesion
molecule (icam)-1, cd36 cd31. leucocyte binding cerebral endothelial cells
in culture induces intracellular signalling via icam-1. hypothesis that
parasitized red blood cells binding receptors cerebral endothelial cells
causes changes integrity blood-brain barrier tested.
immunohistochemistry used examine blood-brain barrier human
cerebral malaria, antibodies macrophage endothelial activation
markers, intercellular junction proteins, plasma proteins. distribution
of cell junction proteins occludin, vinculin zo-1 altered in
cerebral malaria cases compared controls. fibrinogen plasma
protein detected perivascular space, widespread perivascular
macrophage activation, suggesting cells exposed plasma
proteins. concluded functional changes blood-brain barrier
occur cerebral malaria, possibly result binding parasitized red
blood cells cerebral endothelial cells. changes require further
examination vitro.
