a complete ent examination, subjective olfactometry t&t olfactometer 
performed subjects. oerps stimulus isoamyl acetate (<1,648 x 10(-6)),
and air control obtained volunteers.
result: oerps obtained male female volunteers. p2, primary
component oerps, identified volunteers. significant difference
was found latencies components oerps male female
volunteers. n1-p2 interpeak amplitudes larger female subjects than
male subjects (p<0.05).
conclusion: p2 component oerps identified young adults, gender 
and interstimulus interval impact n1-p2 interpeak amplitudes.
