host genetic variants known confer resistance plasmodium blood stage
infection control malaria severity humans mice. work
describes genetic mapping locus resistance liver stage parasite
in mouse. first, show decreased susceptibility liver stage 
plasmodium berghei balb/c mouse strain attributable intra-hepatic
factors impacts initial phase blood stage infection. used qtl
mapping techniques identify locus controlling susceptibility phenotype 
(lod score 4.2) mouse chromosome 17 (belr1 locus). furthermore, analysis of
congenic mouse strains delimited belr1 locus boundaries distally h2
region. quantification parasites liver infected congenic mice
strongly suggested belr1 locus represents genetic factor controlling
the expansion p. berghei hepatic tissue. mapping belr1 locus
raises hypothesis host gene variation able control progression
of plasmodium liver stage infection opens possibility human
genomic region orthologue belr1 may contain genes confer resistance to
the human malaria liver stage.
