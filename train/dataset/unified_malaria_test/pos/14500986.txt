erythrocytic mechanisms involved malarial infection poorly understood. 
have found signaling via erythrocyte beta2-adrenergic receptor and
heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (galphas) regulated entry
of human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum. agonists stimulate
cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate production led increase malarial
infection could blocked specific receptor antagonists. moreover,
peptides designed inhibit galphas protein function reduced parasitemia p.
falciparum cultures vitro, beta-antagonists reduced parasitemia p.
berghei infections vivo mouse model. thus, signaling via erythrocyte
beta2-adrenergic receptor galphas may regulate malarial infection across
parasite species.
