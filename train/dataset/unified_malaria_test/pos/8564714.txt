human recombinant interleukin-10 (il-10) previously shown inhibit
accessory cell (ac)-dependent proliferation bovine parasite-specific helper 
1 (th1), th2, th0 cells il-2-reversible manner (brown, w.c., woods,
v.m., chitko-mckown, c.g., hash, s.m., rice-ficht, a.c., 1994. infect. immun.
62, 4697-4708). present study therefore designed determine whether the
effect il-10 cell proliferation corresponded downregulated
expression cytokines, receptors, important cell growth. the
effects il-10 cellular proliferation expression il-2, il-4, il-2
receptor (il-2r; p55), ifn-gamma babesia bovis- fasciola
hepatica-specific th cell clones simultaneously evaluated. shown
previously, il-10 strongly inhibited proliferation types th cell
clones, although correspond reduced expression il-2 il-4 
mrna products. contrast, expression il-2r mrna consistently
reduced il-10-treated clones. results indicate il-10 not
inhibit ac-dependent proliferation bovine th cells downregulating cell
cytokines; rather, il-10 may act downregulating il-2r p55 expression and
subsequent signal transduction leading decreased cellular proliferation.
ifn-gamma production also consistently downregulated presence of
il-10.
