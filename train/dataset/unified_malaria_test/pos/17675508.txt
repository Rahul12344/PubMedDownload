the chronic myeloid leukemia syndrome bxh-2 mouse strain (mus musculus) is
caused recessive mutation (r294c) transcriptional regulator
icsbp1/irf-8. trans activation assays using il-12p40 gene reporter
construct introduced raw 264.7 mouse macrophages, show the
icsbp1(c294) isoform behaves partial loss-of-function. icsbp1(c294)
hypomorph allele appears threshold effect il-12 production, with
pleiotropic consequences resistance different types infections vivo. 
despite presence resistance nramp1(g169) allele, bxh-2 mice
(icsbp1(c294)) show impaired control mycobacterium bovis (bacille
calmette-gu√©rin) multiplication early late infection, with
uncontrolled replication linked inability form granulomas infected liver
and spleen. studies informative (bxh-2 x balb/cj)f(2) mice show that
homozygosity icsbp1(c294) causes susceptibility salmonella enterica
serovar typhimurium level comparable seen mice lacking
functional nramp1 tlr4. finally, impaired icsbp1(c294) function associated 
with following: 1) increased replication plasmodium chabaudi as
malarial parasite first burst blood parasitemia, 2) recurring
waves high blood parasitemia late infection. results show that
icsbp1 required orchestrating early innate responses also long-term
immune protection unrelated intracellular pathogens.
