plasmodium falciparum secretes homologue translationally controlled
tumor protein (tctp) serum infected individuals, although role in
pathogenesis virulence unknown. determine effect p. falciparum
tctp b cells compared human tctp, fluorescently labeled proteins were
incubated primary cultures mouse splenic b cells analyzed flow
cytometry confocal microscopy. results indicate recombinant
proteins incorporated b cells, differ significantly rate
and percentage incorporation, significantly higher p. falciparum
tctp. furthermore, p. falciparum tctp showed lower b cell proliferative effect 
than human tctp, suggesting mechanism former could interfere 
in host's immune response.
