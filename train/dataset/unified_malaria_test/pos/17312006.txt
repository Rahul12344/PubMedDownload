mouse strains acb55 acb61 resistant malaria virtue mutation in
erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (pklr(i90n)). linkage analysis [acb55 x a/j] f2
mice detected second locus (char9; logarithm odds = 4.74) regulates the
blood-stage replication plasmodium chabaudi independently pklr. we
characterized 77 genes char9 locus tissue-specific expression,
strain-specific alterations gene expression, polymorphic variants are
possibly associated differential susceptibility. identified vnn1/vnn3 
the likely candidates responsible char9. vnn3/vnn1 map within conserved
haplotype block show expression levels strictly cis-regulated by
this haplotype. absence vnn messenger rna expression lack of
pantetheinase protein activity tissues associated susceptibility to
malaria linked complex rearrangement vnn3 promoter region.
the a/j strain also carries unique nonsense mutation leads truncated 
protein. vanin genes code pantetheinase involved production of
cysteamine, key regulator host responses inflammatory stimuli.
administration cystamine vivo partially corrects susceptibility malaria 
in a/j mice, measured reduced blood parasitemia decreased mortality.
these studies suggest pantetheinase critical host response to
malaria.
