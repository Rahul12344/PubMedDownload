theileria parva-infected lymphoblastoid cell lines b cell origin were
examined il-2 mrna expression. t. parva-infected cell lines could the
cd4-cd8-, cd4+cd8-, cd4-cd8+, cd4+cd8+ phenotype express alpha beta or
gamma delta tcr. northern blot analysis amplification polymerase
chain reaction, il-2 mrna could detected t. parva-infected cell lines
tested. il-2 mrna expression also shown dependent continuous
presence parasite host cell cytoplasm, elimination the
parasite treatment t. parva-infected cell cultures theilericidal
drug bw720c resulted disappearance detectable il-2 mrna. effect 
anti-il-2 antibodies proliferation t. parva-infected cells also
tested. inhibition experiments suggest although il-2 mrna detected in
all cell lines tested, t. parva-infected cell lines dependent il-2
for proliferation. data provide first example constitutive 
expression il-2 mrna b cells caused infection an
intracellular parasite.
