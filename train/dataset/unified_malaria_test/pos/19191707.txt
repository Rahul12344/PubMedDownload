264.7 cells exposed hne synthetic form hz, beta-hematin (bh), 
for 6 24 h. microarray analysis identified alterations gene expression

by bh hne observed malarial infection suggest bh and
hne involved inflammatory response modulation, altered nf-kappab signal
transduction, extracellular matrix (ecm) degradation, dyserythropoiesis. hne 
exposure led several significant steady-state expression changes including
repressed chemokine (c-c motif) ligand 5 (ccl5), indicative dyserythropoiesis,
and severe matrix metalloproteinase 9 (mmp9)/tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinase 1 (timp1) imbalance favor ecm proteolysis.
