this study aimed assess lipid peroxidation antioxidant enzymes goats
naturally infected babesia ovis. red blood cell count (rbc), hemoglobin (hb)
concentration, packed cell volume (pcv), malondialdehyde (mda) concentration,
erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (sod), glutathione peroxidase (gsh-px), catalase
(cat) activities total antioxidant capacity (tac) determined 15 goats
naturally infected b. ovis well number healthy goats. the
parasitological diagnosis confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr)
analysis amplifying partial 18s rrna gene sequence b. ovis. percentage of
parasitemia varied 0.01 1%. activities erythrocyte gsh-px, sod,
cat tac significantly lower (p<0.05) infected goats in
healthy ones. mda concentration erythrocytes infected goats was
significantly higher infected goats healthy ones (p<0.05). severity of
parasitemia showed positive correlation mda negative correlation
with pcv, sod, cat, gsh-px tac. also, mda negatively correlated pcv,
sod, cat, gsh-px tac. results study suggested oxidative
damage rbcs may contribute pathogenesis anemia caprine
babesiosis.
