malaria disease caused plasmodium parasites responsible high
mortality humans. disease caused four different species of
plasmodium though main source mortality plasmodium falciparum. humans
have number genetic adaptations act combat plasmodium. one
adaptation deletion slc4a1 gene leads southeast asian
ovalocytosis (sao). evidence sao erythrocytes resistant to
multiple plasmodium species. analyze slc4a1 23 primates mammals to
test differential selective pressures among different primate lineages.
because primates infected human plasmodium parasites their
relatives, analysis used test human plasmodium parasite is
the likely target sao. significantly different pattern molecular
evolution found humans african apes, species infected p.
falciparum relatives. effect restricted cytosolic domain 
of slc4a1 gene. evidence consistent different selective regime 
operating gene domain humans african apes, compared 
primates mammals. alternatively, pattern consistent relaxation
of selection weak adaptive evolution operating small number amino
acids. adaptive interpretation results consistent sao
allele slc4a1 gene interacting p. falciparum humans, rather than
other plasmodium parasites. however, additional investigation relationship
between slc4a1 variants plasmodium humans african apes required 
test whether different selective regime humans african apes due 
natural selection relaxed constraint.
