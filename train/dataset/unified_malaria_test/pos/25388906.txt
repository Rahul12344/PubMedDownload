background: post-hoc analysis, determined influence single
nucleotide polymorphisms host candidate immune genes outcome drug
resistant malaria cameroon.
methods: human dna 760 patients previous clinical trial subjected
to mass spectrometry-based single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) genotyping.
allele frequencies candidate immune genes calculated 62 snps 17
human chromosomes possible involvement clearance drug-resistant
parasites triple mutations pfcrt76t, pfmdr86y, pfmdr1246y (ty)
and pfdhfr51i, pfdhfr59r, pfdhfr108n, pfdhps437g (irng) determined
by dotblot pcr-restriction analysis. differences snp frequencies and
association analysis carried comparing chi-square odds ratios (ors)
and stratified mantel-haenzel statistics. adjusted p value (or) <0·0008 was
considered significant.
results: post-treatment drug failure rates amodiaquine (36·4%);
sulpadoxine/pyrimethamine-amodiaquine combination (15·4%); and
sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (18·1%). snps il22, il-4r1, cd36 appeared to
have associated clearance resistant parasites [p  =  0·017, (c
allele):1·44, 95% ci (or): 1·06-1·95]; [p  =  0·014,  =  1·31, 95% ci (or):
1·07-1·83]; [p  =  5·78×10(-5),  =  0·27, 95%ci (or): 0·13-0·54],
respectively, high fever (>39°c 48 hours) [il-22, p  =  0·01,  = 
1·5, 95% ci (or): 1·8-2·1] also high frequency among fulani
participants [p  =  0·006,  =  1·83, 95% ci (or): 1·11-3·08)]. cd36-1264
null allele completely absent northern population.
conclusion: independent association snps il22 il-4 clearance of
amodiaquine- sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine-resistant parasites reach
statistical significance, may suggest drug-resistant mutants are
adversely affected immune-mediated mechanisms clearance.
