ceramide lipid second messenger generated response to
stimulation number surface receptors, treatment chemotherapeutic
agents, ionising radiation. depending target cell, ceramide induces
diverse biological responses including apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest,
differentiation, also proliferation. studied effect ceramide the
degradation ikappab, cytoplasmic inhibitor transcription factor
nf-kappab. show ceramide treatment results reduced levels of
phosphorylated ikappabalpha degradation ikappabalpha ikappabbeta.
ceramide synergised okadaic acid (oa), compound interferes 
protein phosphatase 2a-controlled component nf-kappab activation pathway, 
enhancing oa-induced ikappab degradation. ceramide also synergised phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate, mimics protein kinase c activation. finally, we
show synergistic effect ceramide oa phorbol ester be
observed primary lymph node t-cells well transformed t-cells.
