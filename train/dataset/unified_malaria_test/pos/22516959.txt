effective resolution malaria infection avoiding pathogenesis requires
regulated pro- anti-inflammatory responses development protective
immunity. tlrs known critical initiating innate immune responses,
but roles regulation immune responses development of
protective immunity malaria remain poorly understood. study, using
wild-type, tlr2(-/-), tlr4(-/-), tlr9(-/-), myd88(-/-) mice infected with
plasmodium yoelii, show tlr9 myd88 regulate pro/anti-inflammatory
cytokines, th1/th2 development, cellular humoral responses. dendritic
cells tlr9(-/-) myd88(-/-) mice produced significantly lower levels of
proinflammatory cytokines higher levels anti-inflammatory cytokines than
dendritic cells wild-type mice. nk cd8(+) cells tlr9(-/-) and
myd88(-/-) mice showed markedly impaired cytotoxic activity. furthermore, mice
deficient tlr9 myd88 showed higher th2-type lower th1-type iggs.
consequently, tlr9(-/-) myd88(-/-) mice exhibited compromised ability to
control parasitemia susceptible death. data also show tlr9
and myd88 distinctively regulate immune responses malaria infection. tlr9(-/-)
but myd88(-/-) mice produced significant levels pro- and
anti-inflammatory cytokines, including il-1Î² il-18, other
tlrs/inflammasome- and/or il-1r/il-18r-mediated signaling. thus, whereas
myd88(-/-) mice completely lacked cell-mediated immunity, tlr9(-/-) mice showed
low levels cell-mediated immunity slightly resistant malaria 
infection myd88(-/-) mice. overall, findings demonstrate tlr9 and
myd88 play central roles immune regulation development protective
immunity malaria, implications understanding immune responses to
other pathogens.
