babesiosis potentially life-threatening zoonotic disease endemic 
the northeastern united states increasing prevalence worldwide.
transmitted ixodes tick responsible lyme disease, the
intraerythrocytic parasite babesia causes wide range clinical
presentations--from asymptomatic carriage fulminant course rapid
deterioration. symptoms typically present 1 6 weeks inoculation, with
the gradual onset fatigue, malaise, weakness, intermittent sustained
fever high 40.9°c. severe cases associated parasitemia greater
than 4%, alkaline phosphatase greater 125 u/l, white blood cell counts
greater 5×10(9)/l. definitive diagnosis made microscopic examination
of thin blood smears, polymerase chain reaction, indirect immunofluorescent
antibody testing. increasing frequency babesiosis paired lack of
blood-donor screening assays poses serious threat safety us blood
supply. although babesiosis responsible 3.6% transfusion-related
deaths, food drug administration yet approve mandatory screening
for parasite donated blood. historically, transfusion-transmitted
babesiosis thought isolated immunocompromised patient
population. however, recent case transfusion-transmitted babesiosis an
immunocompetent patient following total hip arthroplasty first reported in
the literature may represent growing risk far greater segment the
population previously thought. article summarizes current state 
transfusion-transmitted babesiosis detrimental impact infection
on blood transfusion safety.
