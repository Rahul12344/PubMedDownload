c57bl/6 (b6) mice resistant infection non-lethal (nl) strain of
plasmodium yoelii 17x, susceptible lethal (l)
strain. 65 000 mw heat-shock protein (hsp 65) strongly expressed in
splenic adherent cells b6 mice 10 days infection nl strain of
p. yoelii slightly mice infected l strain. mice
which survived infection nl strain resistant challenge 
the l strain hsp 65 strongly expressed splenic adherent cells these
mice. severe combined immunodeficient mice nude mice susceptible to
malaria infection even nl strain express hsp 65 after
infection, suggesting cells required expression hsp 65 as
well protective immunity. b6 mice treated intraperitoneally with
carrageenan, impairs macrophage function, became susceptible nl
strain infection, indicating macrophages play important role final
effectors protective immunity. results demonstrate hsp 65
expressed macrophages correlates closely protection p. yoelii
infection.
