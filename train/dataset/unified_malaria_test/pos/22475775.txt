rangeliosis disease affects dogs brazil, caused piroplasm
known rangelia vitalii. disease causes lot clinico-pathological
features, including coagulation disorders associated bleeding. cause
of changes yet determined. considering association of
purinergic system hemostasis study aimed evaluate activity of
enzymes hydrolyze atp, adp amp; deamination adenosine in
platelets dogs experimentally infected r. vitalii. study, 12
healthy young dogs (females) used, separated two groups. group (n=5)
were uninfected controls, group b experimentally infected r.
vitalii (n=7). inoculated r. vitalii-infected blood, animals
were monitored blood smear examinations, showed intra-erythrocytic forms
of parasite five days post-inoculation (pi). blood samples were
collected quantitate separate platelets (day 0, 12 21 pi) to
measure enzymatic activities (day 12 21 pi). activity ntpdase,
5'-nucleotidase adenosine deaminase (ada) measured platelets. a
reduction (p<0.01) number platelets observed r. vitalii-infected
blood days 12 21 pi. day 12 pi, reduction (p<0.01) hydrolysis 
of atp, adp amp, deamination adenosine observed dogs infected
with r. vitalii. day 21 pi ada activity remained decreased, unlike the
activity ntpdase increased (p<0.05). based results can
conclude atp, adp amp hydrolysis adenosine deamination altered 
in platelets r. vitalii-infected dogs. considering importance the
purinergic system hemostasis, believed changes contribute 
the coagulation disorders bleeding observed r. vitalii-infected dogs and
discussed manuscript.
