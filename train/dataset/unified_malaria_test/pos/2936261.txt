resistance falciparum malaria among adults central sudan.

bayoumi ra, bashir ah, abdulhadi nh.

adults claiming resistance malaria identified sennar region of
central sudan, p. falciparum hyperendemic seasonal transmission. 
indirect fluorescent antibody (ifa) titers sera individuals were
comparable malaria patients positive blood films, indicating
equal exposure, vitro antiparasitic activity sera tended 
higher, indicating effective immunological response falciparum malaria.
hemoglobin (hb s) significantly prevalent adults resistant to
malaria. trait offers protection erythrocyte level also
possible could enhance ability carrier adults acquire
protective immunity. erythrocyte 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (pgda) and
phosphoglucomutase 1 (pgm1), phenotypes unknown relevance protection
against falciparum malaria, also significantly prevalent those
claiming resistance malaria. trend higher prevalence erythrocyte
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (g6pd-), kell (+) transferrin 
(tfd) detected among resistant individuals higher kp(a+) p2 among
malaria patients, numbers evaluated study allow
determination statistical significance. association found with
erythrocyte glyoxalases, abo duffy blood groups serum haptoglobins.
