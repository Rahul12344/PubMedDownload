to examine human gene expression uncomplicated p. falciparum malaria, we
obtained three samples (acute illness, treatment, recovery) 10 subjects 
and utilized subject's recovery sample baseline. time of
acute illness (day 1), subjects upregulation innate immune response,
cytokine, inflammation-related genes (il-1β, il-6, tnf, ifn-γ), was
more frequent parasitemias >100,000 per μl body temperatures ≥ 39°c.
apoptosis-related genes (fas, bax, tp53) upregulated acutely for
several days thereafter (days 1-3). contrast, expression of
immune-modulatory (transcription factor 7, hlv-doa, cd6) apoptosis
inhibitory (c-myc, caspase 8, fas ligand g) genes downregulated initially
and returned normal clinical recovery (days 7-10). results indicate
that innate immune response, cytokine, apoptosis pathways upregulated
acutely uncomplicated malaria concomitant downregulation of
immune-modulatory apoptosis inhibitory genes.
