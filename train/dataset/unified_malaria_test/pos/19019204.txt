background: effects plasmodium falciparum b-cell homeostasis not
been well characterized. study investigated whether episode acute
malaria young children results changes peripheral b cell phenotype.
methods: using flow-cytofluorimetric analysis, b cell phenotypes found the
peripheral blood children aged 2-5 years characterized episode 
of acute uncomplicated clinical malaria four weeks post-recovery in
healthy age-matched controls.
results: significant decrease cd19+ b lymphocytes acute
malaria. characterization cd19+ b cell subsets peripheral blood
based expression igd cd38 revealed significant decrease the
numbers naive 1 cd38-igd+ b cells increase cd38+igd-
memory 3 b cells acute malaria. analysis peripheral b cell 
phenotype also identified expansion transitional cd10+cd19+ b cells in
children following episode acute malaria 25% total cd19+ b
cell pool residing subset.
conclusion: children experiencing episode acute uncomplicated clinical
malaria experienced profound disturbances b cell homeostasis.
