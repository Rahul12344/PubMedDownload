and efficacy oxytetracycline combination diaminazene aceturate
injection theileriosis lushai hill district mizoram; fifty five
cross bred cattle screened july, 2013 november, 2013. the
prevalence tropical theileriosis 9.09 % based blood smear examination.

erythrocytic count 2.14 ± 0.7 × 10(6)/ul, packed cell volume 18.10 ± 0.8 % and
total leukocyte count 6.95 ± 1.05 × 10(3)/ul, respectively. erythrocyte
sedimentation rate significantly increased (p < 0.01) to

cross bred cattle. clinically infected cattle theileria annulata had
significantly low levels total proteins albumin, (p < 0.05) ast,
