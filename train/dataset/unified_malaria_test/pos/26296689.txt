plasmodium falciparum infects approximately 500million individuals year. a
small significant number infections lead complications cerebral
malaria. cerebral malaria associated myelin damage neurological
deficits survivors, iron status thought impact outcome of
infection. evaluated whether mouse model experimental cerebral malaria
with plasmodium berghei anka strain altered dietary iron deficiency or
genetic iron overload (h67d hfe). found h67d mice increased survival 
over h67h (wild type) mice. moreover, specifically designed formulation diet
increased survival regardless whether diet iron deficient iron
adequate. determine potential mechanisms underlying demyelination in
experimental cerebral malaria, measured semaphorin4a (sema4a) protein levels
in brain found cytotoxic oligodendrocytes. sema4a was
increased wild type mice developed experimental cerebral malaria while
consuming standard rodent chow, consistent decrease myelin basic
protein, indicator myelin integrity. brains iron deficient h67d 
mice lower levels sema4a. myelin basic protein decreased brains 
mice fed iron deficient diet previously reported. also
examined erythropoietin, consideration treatment cerebral
malaria, il-6, known increase infection. found that
plasma erythropoietin elevated il-6 low h67d mice mice 
fed formulation diets. data reveal paradigm-shifting concept that
maintaining iron status may increase mortality associated malaria
and provide dietary strategy examination. moreover, data
provide clues exploring mechanism limit co-morbidity associated
with experimental cerebral malaria appears include decreased sema4a in
brain well elevated erythropoietin lower il-6 plasma.
