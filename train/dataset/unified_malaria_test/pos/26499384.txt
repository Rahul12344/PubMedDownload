malaria considered one prevalent diseases world.
severity disease males females important clinical
research areas. study, investigated impact sex differences in
brain response infection plasmodium berghei. male female c57bl/6 mice
were infected p. berghei-infected erythrocytes. infection induced a
significant change weight loss males (-7.2 % ± 0.5) females (-4.9
% ± 0.6). maximum parasitemia reached 15 % day 9 postinfection.
also, p. berghei infection caused histopathological changes brain mice.
these changes form inflammation, hemorrhage, structural
changes purkinje cells. addition, p. berghei able induce marked
oxidative damage mice brain. infection induced significant increase in
male brain glutathione females brain catalase level was
significantly increased infected females infected males. moreover, the
change brain neurotransmitters, dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and
serotonin, infected males infected females. molecular
level, p. berghei able induce upregulations adam23, cabp1, cacnb4,
glrb, vdac3-mrna brain mice. genes significantly
upregulated infected males infected females. general, p. berghei
could induce structural, biochemical, molecular alterations mice brain.
severity alterations different according sex mice.
