the human complement system frontline defense mechanism invading
pathogens. coexistence humans microbes throughout evolution has
produced ingenious molecular mechanisms microorganisms escape complement
attack. common evasion strategy used diverse pathogens hijacking of
soluble human complement regulators surfaces afford protection from
complement activation. one host regulator factor h (fh), acts 
negative regulator complement protect host tissues aberrant complement
activation. report, show plasmodium falciparum merozoites, the
invasive form malaria parasites, actively recruit fh alternative
spliced form fh-like protein 1 exposed human serum. mapped the
binding site fh recognizes merozoites identified pf92, member of
the six-cysteine family plasmodium surface proteins, direct interaction
partner. bound merozoites, fh retains cofactor activity, key function
that allows downregulate alternative pathway complement. p.
falciparum parasites lack pf92, observed changes pattern c3b
cleavage consistent decreased regulation complement activation. 
these results also show recruitment fh affords p. falciparum merozoites
protection complement-mediated lysis. study provides new insights on
mechanisms immune evasion malaria parasites highlights important
function surface coat proteins interplay complement regulation 
and successful infection host.
