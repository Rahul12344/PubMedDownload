the critical role complement (c3) c3b receptor facilitating 
vivo development parasitemia babesia rodhaini rats documented.
depletion serum c3 less 5% normal levels treatment rats 
the c3 inactivator isolated cobra venom markedly delays onset of
parasitemia. treatment rats trypan blue, inhibitor c3b
receptor, delays development parasitemia. conversely, treatment rats
with suramin, drug blocks c3b inactivator, markedly accelerates the
progression parasitemia and, correspondingly, mortality rate. these
observations suggest vivo production c3b interaction 
c3b receptors red cells and/or parasites critical feature babesial 
injection rats. support concept b. rodhaini organisms contain
c3b receptors, shown vitro parasites activate alternate 
complement pathway, resulting uptake radiolabeled c3, uptake 
is blocked presence trypan blue. development of
parasitemia, red cells become coombs-positive c3, igg. taken
together, data support vital role c3 activation products (presumably
c3b) c3b receptor facilitation babesial infection rat.
