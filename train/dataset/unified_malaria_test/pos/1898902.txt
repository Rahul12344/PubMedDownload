in present study, contribution cd4+ cd8+ lymphocytes acquired
immunity blood-stage infection murine malaria species plasmodium
chabaudi investigated. c57bl/6 mice, genetically resistant to
infection hemoprotozoan parasite exhibit transient course of
infection, treated intraperitoneally monoclonal antibodies t-cell
epitopes, either anti-thy-1, anti-cd4, anti-cd8. intraperitoneal
infection 10(6) parasitized erythrocytes, control c57bl/6 mice exhibited a
peak parasitemia day 9 approximately 35% parasitized erythrocytes and
eliminated infection within 4 weeks. mice depleted thy-1+ cd4+ cells 
had significantly higher parasitemias day 7 well significantly higher
peak parasitemias. mice unable control infection developed 
a persistent, high parasitemia fluctuated 40 60% the
experiment terminated day 56 postinfection. depletion cd8+ t
lymphocytes found effect early course parasitemia 
the level peak parasitemia. however, mice depleted cd8+ cells experienced
two recurrent bouts parasitemia later stage infection and
required 5 weeks eliminate parasites. peak
parasitemia, occurred control experimental animals day 9, there
was sharp drop parasitemia coinciding wave reticulocytosis.
therefore, contribution influx reticulocytes, the
preferred host cell hemoprotozoan parasite, limiting parasitemia
was also examined determining course reticulocytosis infection
in control cell-depleted animals. early infection, marked
and comparable reticulocytosis peripheral blood control t
cell-depleted mice; reticulocytosis peaked day 12 coincided the
dramatic sudden reduction parasitemia occurring groups. both
control cd8-depleted mice percentage reticulocytes decreased the
infection resolved, whereas cd4-depleted mice marked reticulocytosis
correlated high, persistent parasitemia. results thus demonstrate that
both cd4+ cd8+ cells involved acquired immunity blood-stage p.
chabaudi influx reticulocytes blood occurs 
after peak parasitemia may contribute temporarily limiting the
parasitemia.
