infection plasmodium falciparum may result severe disease affecting
various organs, including liver, spleen, brain, resulting high morbidity
and mortality. plasmodium berghei anka infection mice recapitulates many
features severe human malaria. aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr) an
intracellular receptor activated ligands important modulation the
inflammatory response. found ahr-knockout (ko) mice infected p.
berghei anka displayed increased parasitemia, earlier mortality, enhanced
leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions brain microvasculature, and
increased inflammation brain (interleukin-17 [il-17] il-6) liver
(gamma interferon [ifn-γ] tumor necrosis factor alpha [tnf-α]) compared to
infected wild-type (wt) mice. infected ahr-ko mice also displayed reduction 
cytokines required host resistance, including tnf-α, il-1β, ifn-γ, the
brain spleen. infection ahr-ko mice resulted increase t
regulatory cells transforming growth factor β, il-6, il-17 brain. 
ahr modulated basal expression socs3 spleen brain, p. berghei
anka infection resulted enhanced expression socs3 brain, was
absent infected ahr-ko mice. data suggest ahr-mediated control of
socs3 expression probably involved phenotype seen infected ahr-ko
mice. is, knowledge, first demonstration role ahr the
