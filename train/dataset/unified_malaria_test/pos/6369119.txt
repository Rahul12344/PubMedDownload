complement activation surface plasmodium falciparum infected
erythrocytes.

stanley ha, mayes jt, cooper nr, reese rt.

the surface trophozoite-stage plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes
will, presence immune human owl monkey serum, activate classical
complement pathway. demonstrated sensitive, enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay detects complex, c1s-c1 inhibitor, only
generated classical pathway activated. second enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay, well covaspheres coated affinity-purified
anti-c3, showed immune activation classical pathway infected
erythrocytes resulted accumulation significant amounts c3b the
erythrocyte surface. development parasite trophozoite
stage, erythrocyte membrane also transformed non-activator a
surface capable activating complement alternative pathway. erythrocytes
infected trophozoite-stage parasites directly activated alternative
complement pathway. activation led specific binding average 
15,000 c3b molecules per infected cell. alternative pathway activation was
augmented anti-parasite antibody. conditions mediated accumulation of
an average 36,000 c3b molecules per infected erythrocyte. amounts c3b
on infected erythrocyte surface lead cellular lysis. are,
however, likely major impact total vivo response this
parasite.
