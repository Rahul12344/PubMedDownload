several plasmodium species exhibit strong age-based preference red
blood cells (rbc) infect, turn major determinant disease
severity pathogenesis. molecular basis underlying age constraint 
the use rbc influence parasite burden poorly understood. cd47 is
a marker self cells, including rbc, which, conjunction signal 
regulatory protein alpha (expressed macrophages), prevents clearance of
cells immune system. report, investigated role cd47
on growth survival nonlethal plasmodium yoelii 17xnl (pynl) malaria in
c57bl/6 mice. using quantitative biotin-labeling procedure a
gfp-expressing parasite, demonstrate pynl parasites preferentially infect
high levels cd47 (cd47(hi))-expressing young rbc. importantly, c57bl/6
cd47(-/-) mice highly resistant pynl infection developed 9.3-fold
lower peak parasitemia wild-type (wt) counterparts. enhanced
resistance malaria observed cd47(-/-) mice associated higher
percentage splenic f4/80(+) cells, cells higher percentage 
phagocytized parasitized rbc infected wt mice acute phase of
infection, parasitemia rapidly rising. furthermore, injection of
cd47-neutralizing antibody caused significant reduction parasite burden in
wt c57bl/6 mice. together, results strongly suggest cd47(hi) young rbc
may provide shield malaria parasite clearance phagocytic
cells, may immune escape mechanism used plasmodium parasites 
preferentially infect young rbc.
