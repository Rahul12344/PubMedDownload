Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides is a West African forest tree that is used for example
against malaria and sickle cell anemia in Burkina Faso. The goal of this study
was to analyze the genetic and morphological diversity of the species within wild
populations in Burkina Faso, where it is potentially under threat due to the
uncontrolled harvesting of its roots. Seventy-two trees from three different
sites in Southwestern Burkina Faso were analyzed. Each tree was characterized by 
12 traits specifying the period of flowering and maturity as well as
morphological characteristics of the stem, leaves, and seeds. The molecular
analysis was performed using two plastid DNA regions (psbA-trnH and trnL-trnF)
and two nuclear regions (GBSSI and ITS) to identify the genetic diversity of the 
species for further development of a management plan for ex situ reproduction and
in situ conservation. We found variability in morphological traits correlating
with the geographic distance of the study sites. The molecular analysis, in
contrast, revealed hardly any genetic variability among the tested trees and no
population structure. Whether the differences in morphological traits are caused 
by different environmental conditions or by genetic variability in genes linked
to morphological traits needs further testing. The apparent lack of genetic
differentiation suggests that germplasm throughout the study region is suitable
for planting in conservation actions. Efficient conservation management should
involve local communities, especially those interested in traditional medicine.
