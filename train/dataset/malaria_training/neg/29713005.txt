We present allele frequencies involving 39 pharmacogenetic biomarkers studied in 
Brazil, and their distribution on self-reported race/color categories that: (1)
involve a mix of perceptions about ancestry, morphological traits, and
cultural/identity issues, being social constructs pervasively used in Brazilian
society and medical studies; (2) are associated with disparities in access to
health services, as well as in their representation in genetic studies, and (3), 
as we report here, explain a larger portion of the variance of pharmaco-allele
frequencies than geography. We integrated a systematic review of studies on
healthy volunteers (years 1968-2017) and the analysis of allele frequencies on
three population-based cohorts from northeast, southeast, and south, the most
populated regions of Brazil. Cross-validation of results from these both
approaches suggest that, despite methodological heterogeneity of the 120 studies 
conducted on 51,747 healthy volunteers, allele frequencies estimates from
systematic review are reliable. We report differences in allele frequencies
between color categories that persist despite the homogenizing effect of >500
years of admixture. Among clinically relevant variants: CYP2C9*2 (null), CYP3A5*3
(defective), SLCO1B1-rs4149056(C), and VKORC1-rs9923231(A) are more frequent in
Whites than in Blacks. Brazilian Native Americans show lower frequencies of
CYP2C9*2, CYP2C19*17 (increased activity), and higher of SLCO1B1-rs4149056(C)
than other Brazilian populations. We present the most current and informative
database of pharmaco-allele frequencies in Brazilian healthy volunteers.
