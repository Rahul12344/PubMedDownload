Background: The performance of Plasmodium falciparum-specific histidine-rich
protein 2-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to evaluate suspected malaria in
low-endemicity settings has not been well characterized.
Methods: Using dried blood spot samples from patients with suspected malaria at
37 health facilities from 2012 to 2014 in the low-endemicity country of
Swaziland, we investigated the diagnostic accuracy of histidine-rich protein
2-based RDTs using qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (nested PCR
targeting the cytochrome b gene) and quantitative PCR as reference standards. To 
explore reasons for false-negative and/or false-positive results, we used
pfhrp2/3-specific PCR and logistic regression analyses of potentially associated 
epidemiological factors.
Results: From 1353 patients, 93.0% of RDT-positive (n = 185) and 31.2% of
RDT-negative samples (n = 340) were available and selected for testing. Compared 
with nested PCR, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV),
and negative predictive value (NPV) of RDTs were 51.7%, 94.1%, 67.3%, and 89.1%, 
respectively. After exclusion of samples with parasite densities <100/μL, which
accounted for 75.7% of false-negative results and 33.3% of PCR-detectable
infections, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 78.8%, 93.7%, 62.3%, 
and 97.1%. Deletions of pfhrp2 were not detected. False-positivity was more
likely during the second year and was not associated with demographics, recent
malaria, health facility testing characteristics, or potential DNA degradation.
Conclusions: In the low-transmission setting of Swaziland, we demonstrated low
sensitivity of RDT for malaria diagnosis, owing to an unexpectedly high
proportion of low-density infection among symptomatic subjects. The PPV was also 
low, requiring further investigation. A more accurate point-of-care diagnostic
may be needed to support malaria elimination efforts.
