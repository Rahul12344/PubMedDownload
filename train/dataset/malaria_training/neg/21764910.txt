Protozoan parasites that profoundly affect mankind represent an exceptionally
diverse group of organisms, including Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, Entamoeba, Giardia,
trypanosomes, and Leishmania. Despite the overwhelming impact of these parasites,
there remain many aspects to be discovered about mechanisms of pathogenesis and
how these organisms survive in the host. Combined with the ever-increasing
availability of sequenced genomes, RNA interference (RNAi), discovered a mere 13 
years ago, has enormously facilitated the analysis of gene function, especially
in organisms that are not amenable to classical genetic approaches. Here we
review the current status of RNAi in studies of parasitic protozoa, with special 
emphasis on its use as a postgenomic tool.
