Larval therapy with Lucilia sericata is a promising strategy in wound healing.
Axon guidance molecules play vital roles during the development of the nervous
system and also regulate the capacity of neuronal restoration in wound healing.
Netrin-1, one of the proteins that larvae secrete, plays a useful role in cell
migration and nerve tissue regeneration. The UNC-5 receptor combines with a
netrin-1 signal and transmits the signal from one side of the membrane to the
other side, initiating a change in cell activity. In the current study, we
identified the full length of the UNC-5 receptor mRNA in L. sericata using
different sets of primers, including exon junction and specific region primers.
The coding sequence (CDS) of the UNC-5 receptor was sequenced and identified to
include 633 base-pair nucleic acids, and BLAST analysis on its nucleotide
sequence revealed 96% identity with the Lucilia cuprina netrin-1 UNC-5 receptor. 
The protein residue included 210 amino acids (aa) and coded for a protein with 24
kD weight. This gene lacked the signal peptide. Furthermore, the UPA domain is
conserved in UNC-5. It lied at the interval of 26-131 aa. We identified the CDS
of netrin-1 UNC-5 receptor in L. sericata. It could be applied to research
activities implementing a new essential component design in wound healing.
