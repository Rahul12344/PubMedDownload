UIS4 is a key protein component of the host-parasite interface in the liver stage
of the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei and required for parasite
survival after invasion. In the infectious sporozoite, UIS4 protein has variably 
been shown to be translated but also been reported to be translationally
repressed. Here we show that uis4 mRNA translation is regulated by the P. berghei
RNA binding protein Pumilio-2 (PbPuf2 or Puf2 from here on forward) in infectious
salivary gland sporozoites in the mosquito vector. Using RNA immunoprecipitation 
we show that uis4 mRNA is bound by Puf2 in salivary gland sporozoites. In the
absence of Puf2, uis4 mRNA translation is de-regulated and UIS4 protein
expression upregulated in salivary gland sporozoites. Here, using RNA
immunoprecipitation, we reveal the first Puf2-regulated mRNA in this parasite.
