Members of the Plasmodium vivax reticulocyte binding protein (PvRBP) family are
believed to mediate specific invasion of reticulocytes by P. vivax. In this
study, we performed molecular characterization of genes encoding members of this 
protein family. Through cDNA sequencing, we constructed full-length gene models
and verified genes that are protein coding and those that are pseudogenes. We
also used quantitative PCR to measure their in vivo transcript abundances in
clinical P. vivax isolates. Like genes encoding related invasion ligands of P.
falciparum, Pvrbp expression levels vary broadly across different parasite
isolates. Through antibody measurements, we found that host immune pressure may
be the driving force behind the distinctly high diversity of one of the family
members, PvRBP2c. Mild yet significant negative correlation was found between
parasitemia and the PvRBP2b antibody level, suggesting that antibodies to the
protein may interfere with invasion.
