BACKGROUND: As the prevalence of artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum
malaria increases in the Greater Mekong subregion, emerging resistance to partner
drugs in artemisinin combination therapies seriously threatens global efforts to 
treat and eliminate this disease. Molecular markers that predict failure of
artemisinin combination therapy are urgently needed to monitor the spread of
partner drug resistance, and to recommend alternative treatments in southeast
Asia and beyond.
METHODS: We did a genome-wide association study of 297 P falciparum isolates from
Cambodia to investigate the relationship of 11 630 exonic single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) and 43 copy number variations (CNVs) with in-vitro
piperaquine 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s), and tested whether these
genetic variants are markers of treatment failure with
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. We then did a survival analysis of 133 patients
to determine whether candidate molecular markers predicted parasite recrudescence
following dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment.
FINDINGS: Piperaquine IC50s increased significantly from 2011 to 2013 in three
Cambodian provinces (2011 vs 2013 median IC50s: 20·0 nmol/L [IQR 13·7-29·0] vs
39·2 nmol/L [32·8-48·1] for Ratanakiri, 19·3 nmol/L [15·1-26·2] vs 66·2 nmol/L
[49·9-83·0] for Preah Vihear, and 19·6 nmol/L [11·9-33·9] vs 81·1 nmol/L
[61·3-113·1] for Pursat; all p≤10-3; Kruskal-Wallis test). Genome-wide analysis
of SNPs identified a chromosome 13 region that associates with raised piperaquine
IC50s. A non-synonymous SNP (encoding a Glu415Gly substitution) in this region,
within a gene encoding an exonuclease, associates with parasite recrudescence
following dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment. Genome-wide analysis of CNVs 
revealed that a single copy of the mdr1 gene on chromosome 5 and a novel
amplification of the plasmepsin 2 and plasmepsin 3 genes on chromosome 14 also
associate with raised piperaquine IC50s. After adjusting for covariates, both
exo-E415G and plasmepsin 2-3 markers significantly associate (p=3·0 × 10-8 and
p=1·7 × 10-7, respectively) with decreased treatment efficacy (survival rates
0·38 [95% CI 0·25-0·51] and 0·41 [0·28-0·53], respectively).
INTERPRETATION: The exo-E415G SNP and plasmepsin 2-3 amplification are markers of
piperaquine resistance and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine failures in Cambodia,
and can help monitor the spread of these phenotypes into other countries of the
Greater Mekong subregion, and elucidate the mechanism of piperaquine resistance. 
Since plasmepsins are involved in the parasite's haemoglobin-to-haemozoin
conversion pathway, targeted by related antimalarials, plasmepsin 2-3
amplification probably mediates piperaquine resistance.
