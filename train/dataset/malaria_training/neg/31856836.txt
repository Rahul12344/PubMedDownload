BACKGROUND: The immune modulating potential of IL-35 in multiple human disorders 
has been reported. Consequent upon the recognition of inflammatory cytokine
activation and its preponderance for mediating pathology during malaria
infection, the study aimed to characterize the expression and functional
contribution(s) of IL-35 in Plasmodium berghei (strain ANKA) infected mice.
METHODS: Plasmodium berghei infection in male ICR mice was used as the rodent
model of choice. The time course of IL-35 expression in the systemic circulation 
and tissues of P. berghei infected mice as well as their healthy control
counterparts was assessed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and
immunohistochemistry respectively. The effect of modulating IL-35 by recombinant 
IL-35 protein or neutralizing anti-Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3 antibody on 
the cytokine environment during P. berghei infection was assessed by flow
cytometry. Furthermore, the influence of modulating IL-35 on histopathological
hallmarks of malaria and disease progression was evaluated.
RESULTS: Interleukin-35 was significantly up regulated in serum and tissues of P.
berghei infected mice and correlated with parasitaemia. Neutralization of IL-35
significantly enhanced the release of IFN-Î³, decreased the expression of IL-6 and
decreased parasitaemia patency. Neutralization of IL-35 was also associated with 
a tendency towards increased survival as well as the absence of pathological
features associated with malaria infection unlike recombinant IL-35 protein
administration which sustained a normal course of infection and unfavourable
malaria associated histological outcomes in P. berghei infected mice.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate the involvement of IL-35 in P. berghei induced
malaria infection. IL-35 neutralization strategies may represent viable
therapeutic modalities beneficial for the resolution of malaria infection.
