Plasmodium falciparum is the pathogenic agent of the most lethal of human
malarias. Transgenic P. falciparum parasites expressing luciferase have been
created to study drug interventions of both asexual and sexual blood stages but
luciferase-expressing mosquito stage and liver stage parasites have not been
created which has prevented the easy quantification of mosquito stage development
(e.g. for transmission blocking interventions) and liver stage development (for
interventions that prevent infection). To overcome this obstacle, we have created
a transgenic P. falciparum NF54 parasite that expresses a GFP-luciferase
transgene throughout the life cycle. Luciferase expression is robust and
measurable at all life cycle stages, including midgut oocyst, salivary gland
sporozoites and liver stages, where in vivo development is easily measurable
using humanized mouse infections in conjunction with an in vivo imaging system.
This parasite reporter strain will accelerate testing of interventions against
pre-erythrocytic life cycle stages.
