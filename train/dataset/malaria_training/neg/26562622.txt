We have recently demonstrated that brain endothelial cells cross-present parasite
antigen during mouse experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). Here we describe a 2-d 
protocol to detect cross-presentation by isolating the brain microvessels and
incubating them with a reporter cell line that expresses lacZ upon detection of
the relevant peptide-major histocompatibility complex. After X-gal staining, a
typical positive result consists of hundreds of blue spots, compared with fewer
than 20 spots from a naive brain. The assay is generalizable to other disease
contexts by using reporter cells that express appropriate specific T cell
receptors. Also described is the protocol for culturing endothelial cells from
brain microvessels isolated from naive mice. After 7-10 d, an in vitro
cross-presentation assay can be performed by adding interferon-γ, antigen (e.g., 
Plasmodium berghei-infected red blood cells) and reporter cells in sequence over 
3 d. This is useful for comparing different antigen forms or for probing the
effects of various interventions.
