BACKGROUND: Malaria is one of the important vector-borne diseases with high
fatality rates in tropical countries. The pattern of emergence and spread of
novel antigenic variants, leading to escape of vaccine-induced immunity might be 
factors responsible for severe malaria. A high level of polymorphism has been
reported among malarial antigens which are under selection pressure imposed by
host immunity. There are limited reports available on comparative stage-specific 
genetic diversity among Plasmodium vivax candidate genes in complicated vivax
malaria. The present study was planned to study genetic diversity (Pvcsp and
Pvs25) among complicated and uncomplicated P. vivax isolates.
METHODS: Pvcsp and Pvs2-specific PCRs and DNA sequencing were performed on P.
vivax PCR positive samples. Genetic diversity was analysed using appropriate
software.
RESULTS: The present study was carried out on 143 P. vivax clinical isolates,
collected from Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research,
Chandigarh. Among the classic and variant types of Pvcsp, the VK210 (99%;
115/116) was found to be predominant in both complicated and uncomplicated group 
isolates. Out of the various peptide repeat motifs (PRMs) observed, GDRADGQPA
(PRM1) and GDRAAGQPA (PRM2) was the most widely distributed among the P. vivax
isolates. Whereas among the Pvs25 isolates, 100% of double mutants (E97Q/I130T)
in both the complicated (45/45) as well as in the uncomplicated (81/81) group was
observed.
CONCLUSION: An analysis of genetic variability enables an understanding of the
role of genetic variants in severe vivax malaria.
