Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1) is a leading blood-stage malaria vaccine
candidate. Consistent with a key role in erythrocytic invasion, AMA-1-specific
antibodies have been implicated in AMA-1-induced protective immunity. AMA-1 is
also expressed in sporozoites and in mature liver schizonts where it may be a
target of protective cell-mediated immunity. Here, we demonstrate for the first
time that immunization with AMA-1 can induce sterile infection-blocking immunity 
against Plasmodium sporozoite challenge in 80% of immunized mice. Significantly
higher levels of gamma interferon (IFN-Î³)/interleukin-2 (IL-2)/tumor necrosis
factor (TNF) multifunctional T cells were noted in immunized mice than in control
mice. We also report the first identification of minimal CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell
epitopes on Plasmodium yoelii AMA-1. These data establish AMA-1 as a target of
both preerythrocytic- and erythrocytic-stage protective immune responses and
validate vaccine approaches designed to induce both cellular and humoral
immunity.
