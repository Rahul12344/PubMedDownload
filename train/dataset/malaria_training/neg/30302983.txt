Recent technological breakthroughs in ribonucleic acid (RNA) research and the
creation of synthetic gene drives using CRISPR/Cas9 have increased attention on
the ethical and legal regulation of this field. RNA is now perceived as not
merely a passive carrier of DNA information but especially through its propensity
to mutate as a computation engine of cell biology, developmental biology and
evolution. Synthetic Gene drives have been hailed as a potential strategy to
reduce climate-change-mediated biosecurity threats such as spreading malaria and 
have attracted significant investment, with the Gates Foundation pledging US$75
million and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency awarding US$65 million.
Calls for a global moratorium on RNA-mediated genetic engineering may overstate
the potential risks of the developing technology, but form a background to the
contest between "process"- and "product" -based approaches to regulation, the
former purportedly favoured by the public and regulatory agencies and the latter 
favoured by the broad scientific community and corporate investors. At stake may 
be the democratic legitimacy of and equitable access to a technology that could
be important to reduce the incidence of biosecurity threats both globally and in 
Australia.
