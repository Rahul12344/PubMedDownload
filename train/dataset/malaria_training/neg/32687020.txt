To monitor the incidence of Plasmodium knowlesi infections and determine whether 
other simian malaria parasites are being transmitted to humans, we examined 1,047
blood samples from patients with malaria at Kapit Hospital in Kapit, Malaysia,
during June 24, 2013-December 31, 2017. Using nested PCR assays, we found 845
(80.6%) patients had either P. knowlesi monoinfection (n = 815) or co-infection
with other Plasmodium species (n = 30). We noted the annual number of these
zoonotic infections increased greatly in 2017 (n = 284). We identified 6
patients, 17-65 years of age, with P. cynomolgi and P. knowlesi co-infections,
confirmed by phylogenetic analyses of the Plasmodium cytochrome c oxidase subunit
1 gene sequences. P. knowlesi continues to be a public health concern in the
Kapit Division of Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. In addition, another simian malaria 
parasite, P. cynomolgi, also is an emerging cause of malaria in humans.
