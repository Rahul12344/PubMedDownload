The nuclear proteome of Plasmodium falciparum results from the continual shuttle 
of proteins between the cell cytoplasm-nucleus and vice versa. Using shotgun
proteomics tools, we explored the nuclear proteins of mixed populations of
Plasmodium falciparum extracted from infected erythrocytes. We combined
GeLC-MS/MS and 2D-LC-MS/MS with a peptide ion exclusion procedure in order to
increase the detection of low abundant proteins such as those involved in gene
expression. We have identified 446 nuclear proteins covering all expected nuclear
protein families involved in gene regulation. All structural ribosomal (40S and
60S) proteins were identified which is consistent with the nuclear localization
of ribosomal biogenesis. Proteins involved in the translation machinery were also
found suggesting that translational events might occur in the nucleus in P.
falciparum as previously hypothesized in eukaryotes. These data were compared to 
the protein list established by PlasmoDB and submitted to Plasmobase a recently
reported Plasmodium annotation website to propose new functional putative
annotation of several unknown proteins found in the nuclear extracts.
