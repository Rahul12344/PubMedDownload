BACKGROUND: The Plasmodium genome encodes for a number of 6-Cys proteins that
contain a module of six cysteine residues forming three intramolecular disulphide
bonds. These proteins have been well characterized at transmission as well as
hepatic stages of the parasite life cycle. In the present study, a large complex 
of 6-Cys proteins: Pfs41, Pfs38 and Pfs12 and three other merozoite surface
proteins: Glutamate-rich protein (GLURP), SERA5 and MSP-1 were identified on the 
Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface.
METHODS: Recombinant 6-cys proteins i.e. Pfs38, Pfs12, Pfs41 as well as PfMSP-165
were expressed and purified using Escherichia coli expression system and
antibodies were raised against each of these proteins. These antibodies were used
to immunoprecipitate the native proteins and their associated partners from
parasite lysate. ELISA, Far western, surface plasmon resonance and glycerol
density gradient fractionation were carried out to confirm the respective
interactions. Furthermore, erythrocyte binding assay with 6-cys proteins were
undertaken to find out their possible role in host-parasite infection and
seropositivity was assessed using Indian and Liberian sera.
RESULTS: Immunoprecipitation of parasite-derived polypeptides, followed by
LC-MS/MS analysis, identified a large Pfs38 complex comprising of 6-cys proteins:
Pfs41, Pfs38, Pfs12 and other merozoite surface proteins: GLURP, SERA5 and MSP-1.
The existence of such a complex was further corroborated by several
protein-protein interaction tools, co-localization and co-sedimentation analysis.
Pfs38 protein of Pfs38 complex binds to host red blood cells (RBCs) directly via 
glycophorin A as a receptor. Seroprevalence analysis showed that of the six
antigens, prevalence varied from 40 to 99%, being generally highest for MSP-165
and GLURP proteins.
CONCLUSIONS: Together the data show the presence of a large Pfs38
protein-associated complex on the parasite surface which is involved in RBC
binding. These results highlight the complex molecular interactions among the P. 
falciparum merozoite surface proteins and advocate the development of a
multi-sub-unit malaria vaccine based on some of these protein complexes on
merozoite surface.
