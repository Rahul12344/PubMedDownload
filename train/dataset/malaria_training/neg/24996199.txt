Infection with malaria parasites has imposed a strong selective pressure on the
human genome, promoting the convergent evolution of a diverse range of genetic
adaptations, many of which are harboured by the red blood cell, which hosts the
pathogenic stage of the Plasmodium life cycle. Recent genome-wide and
multi-centre association studies of severe malaria have consistently identified
ATP2B4, encoding the major Ca(2+) pump of erythrocytes, as a novel resistance
locus. Evidence is also accumulating that interaction occurs among resistance
loci, the most recent example being negative epistasis among alpha-thalassemia
and haptoglobin type 2. Finally, studies on the effect of haemoglobin S and C on 
parasite transmission to mosquitoes have suggested that protective variants could
increase in frequency enhancing parasite fitness.
