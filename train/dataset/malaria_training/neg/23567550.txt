Plasmodium falciparum transcripts contain long untranslated regions (UTR), with
some of the longest in any eukaryote that uses monocistronic transcription. Owing
to the extreme AT nucleotide bias within the intergenic regions that encode these
UTR, attempts to characterise how they are apportioned over genes and to describe
their contribution to the absolute and temporal control of gene expression have
been limited. Here we describe a study using a typical house-keeping gene that
encodes phosphoglutamase 2 (PFD0660w), whose expression is subject to
developmentally linked control during intraerythrocytic development. We show that
deletion of a significant proportion (80%) of the predicted 5' UTR has no
apparent effect on the developmentally linked expression of a luciferase reporter
cassette. Further, serial deletions reveal that whilst the absolute level of
transcription is unaffected when up to 50% of the predicted 5' UTR is removed,
the subsequent efficiency of translation is affected. These data provide key
insights into the interplay of transcriptional and post-transcriptional
mechanisms in the control of gene expression in this important human pathogen.
