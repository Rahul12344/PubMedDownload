Understanding how immune challenges elicit different responses is critical for
diagnosing and deciphering immune regulation. Using a modular strategy to
interpret the complex transcriptional host response in mouse models of infection 
and inflammation, we show a breadth of immune responses in the lung. Lung immune 
signatures are dominated by either IFN-γ and IFN-inducible, IL-17-induced
neutrophil- or allergy-associated gene expression. Type I IFN and
IFN-γ-inducible, but not IL-17- or allergy-associated signatures, are preserved
in the blood. While IL-17-associated genes identified in lung are detected in
blood, the allergy signature is only detectable in blood CD4+ effector cells.
Type I IFN-inducible genes are abrogated in the absence of IFN-γ signaling and
decrease in the absence of IFNAR signaling, both independently contributing to
the regulation of granulocyte responses and pathology during Toxoplasma gondii
infection. Our framework provides an ideal tool for comparative analyses of
transcriptional signatures contributing to protection or pathogenesis in disease.
