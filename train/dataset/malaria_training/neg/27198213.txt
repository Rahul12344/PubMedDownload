BACKGROUND: Recent studies in experimental mice have shown that mild deficiency
of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) enzyme confers protection against 
malaria, thus providing an important basis for the hypothesis that MTHFR
polymorphism, i.e. C677T, might have been subjected to selection pressure against
malaria. The present study was undertaken in a malaria endemic region in North
East India to assess whether a similar selection advantage exists for other genes
in folate metabolism pathway.
METHODS: A total of 401 subjects including 131 symptomatic malaria, 97
asymptomatic malaria and 173 normal healthy controls were analysed for nine
polymorphisms (single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] in eight genes and
insertion/deletion in one gene): MTHFR C677T, methionine synthase reductase
(MTRR) A66G, glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) C1561T, cystathionine
beta-synthase (CBS) 844ins68, reduced folate carrier-1 (RFC-1) G80A, serine
hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) C1420T, methionine synthase (MTR) A2756G, MTHFR
G1793A (D 919G), glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) 1289 by PCR-RFLP technique.
Differences in frequencies of genotype distribution of each polymorphic marker
between these groups were evaluated.
RESULTS: MTRR A2756G, SHMT C1420T, GCPII C1561T, MTRR A2756G and GNMT C1289T and 
RFC1 G80A polymorphisms showed significantly different prevalence between
different groups analyzed. No significant differences were seen in the
distribution of other polymorphisms.
CONCLUSIONS: The study gives a clue for the possible selection of specific
polymorphisms in the genes involved in the folate metabolism pathway by malaria
parasite.
