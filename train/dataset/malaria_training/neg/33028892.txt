Plasmodium vivax gene regulation remains difficult to study due to the lack of a 
robust in vitro culture method, low parasite densities in peripheral circulation 
and asynchronous parasite development. We adapted an RNA-seq protocol "DAFT-seq" 
to sequence the transcriptome of four P. vivax field isolates that were cultured 
for a short period ex vivo before using a density gradient for schizont
enrichment. Transcription was detected from 78% of the PvP01 reference genome,
despite being schizont-enriched samples. This extensive data was used to define
thousands of 5' and 3' untranslated regions, some of which overlapped with
neighbouring transcripts, and to improve the gene models of 352 genes, including 
identifying 20 novel gene transcripts. This dataset has also significantly
increased the known amount of heterogeneity between P. vivax schizont
transcriptomes from individual patients. The majority of genes found to be
differentially expressed between the isolates lack Plasmodium falciparum homologs
and are predicted to be involved in host-parasite interactions, with an
enrichment in reticulocyte binding proteins, merozoite surface proteins and
exported proteins with unknown function. An improved understanding of the
diversity within P. vivax transcriptomes will be essential for the prioritisation
of novel vaccine targets.
