BACKGROUND: The emergence of resistance to artemisinin derivatives in western
Cambodia is threatening to revert the recent advances made toward global malaria 
control and elimination. Known resistance-mediating polymorphisms in the K13,
pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, and pfdhps genes are of greatest importance for monitoring
the spread of antimalarial drug resistance.
METHODS: Samples for the present study were collected from 244 patients with
uncomplicated malaria in health centers of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Blood
sample was collected on filter paper before the subject received any treatment.
The parasite DNA was then extracted and amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR) to evaluate the prevalence of polymorphism of pfcrtK76T, pfmdr1 (N86Y,
Y184F), and pfdhps (A437G, K540E). The K13 gene polymorphism was analyzed by
nested PCR followed by sequencing.
RESULTS: The overall results showed 2.26% (5/221) of K13 synonymous mutant
alleles (two C469C, one Y493Y, one G496G, and one V589V), 24.78%, 19.58%, 68.75%,
60.9%, 53.7%, 63.8%, and 64.28%, respectively, for mutant pfcrt 76T, pfmdr1-86Y, 
pfmdr1-184F, pfdhfr51I, pfdhfr59R, pfdhfr108N, and pfdhps 437G. We did not report
any mutation at codon 540 of pfdhps.
CONCLUSION: These results provide baseline prevalence of known drug resistance
polymorphisms and suggest that artemisinin combination therapies may retain good 
efficacy in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Burkina Faso.
