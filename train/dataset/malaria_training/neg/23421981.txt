Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) blood stages express falstatin, an inhibitor of
cysteine proteases (ICP), which is implicated in regulating proteolysis during
red blood cell infection. Recent data using the Plasmodium berghei rodent malaria
model suggested an additional role for ICP in the infection of hepatocytes by
sporozoites and during liver-stage development. Here we further characterize the 
role of ICP in vivo during infection with Plasmodium yoelii (Py) and Pf. We found
that Py-ICP was refractory to targeted gene deletion indicating an essential
function during asexual blood-stage replication, but significant downregulation
of ICP using a regulated system did not impact blood-stage growth. Py-ICP
localized to vesicles within the asexual blood-stage parasite cytoplasm, as well 
as the parasitophorous vacuole, and was exported to dynamic exomembrane
structures in the infected RBC. In sporozoites, expression was observed in
rhoptries, in addition to intracellular vesicles distinct from TRAP containing
micronemes. During liver-stage development, Py-ICP was confined to the parasite
compartment until the final phase of liver-stage development when, after
parasitophorous vacuolemembrane breakdown, it was released into the infected
hepatocyte. Finally, we identified the cysteine protease yoelipain-2 as a binding
partner of Py-ICP during blood-stage infection. These data show that ICP may be
important in regulating proteolytic processes during blood-stage development, and
is likely playing a role in liver stage-hepatocyte interactions at the time of
exoerythrocytic merozoite release.
