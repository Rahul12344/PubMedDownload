Patatin-like phospholipases (PNPLAs) are highly conserved enzymes of prokaryotic 
and eukaryotic organisms with major roles in lipid homeostasis. The genome of the
malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum encodes four putative PNPLAs with
predicted functions during phospholipid degradation. We here investigated the
role of one of the plasmodial PNPLAs, a putative PLA2 termed PNPLA1, during blood
stage replication and gametocyte development. PNPLA1 is present in the asexual
and sexual blood stages and here localizes to the cytoplasm. PNPLA1-deficiency
due to gene disruption or conditional gene-knockdown had no effect on
intraerythrocytic growth, gametocyte development and gametogenesis. However,
parasites lacking PNPLA1 were impaired in gametocyte induction, while PNPLA1
overexpression promotes gametocyte formation. The loss of PNPLA1 further leads to
transcriptional down-regulation of genes related to gametocytogenesis, including 
the gene encoding the sexual commitment regulator AP2-G. Additionally, lipidomics
of PNPLA1-deficient asexual blood stage parasites revealed overall increased
levels of major phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine (PC), which is a
substrate of PLA2 . PC synthesis is known to be pivotal for erythrocytic
replication, while the reduced availability of PC precursors drives the parasite 
into gametocytogenesis; we thus hypothesize that the higher PC levels due to
PNPLA1-deficiency prevent the blood stage parasites from entering the sexual
pathway.
