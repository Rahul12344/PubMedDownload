In this study, the interference of T-DNA insertion upon Agrobacterium-mediated
transformation on the biochemical expression of the host genome is discussed.
Plant extracts of transgenic Artemisia annua L. with or without an overexpressed 
famesyl pyrophosphate synthase gene have been investigated for their bioactivity 
and metabolic profile in comparison with wild type A. annua. The highest
antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and
Candida albicans was observed in the T253 transgenic lines. Moreover, the crude
extract from T253 showed higher antimalarial activity against the Plasmodium
faciparum K1 strain than those of the others. The terpenoid constituents and
antimicrobial properties of the plant samples were grouped by hierarchical
clustering analysis. The clustering showed that squalene is a putative compound
that might be involved in increasing the bioactivity of the transgenic line. In
addition, T253 had a triterpene content that was about twice as great as that of 
the T253-2 line, which had a higher content of sesquiterpenes. However, both
lines were transformed by the same FPS gene. These results suggested that the
different bioactive properties observed in each transgenic line may be caused by 
variations in their terpenoid composition, which is affected by T-DNA insertion
at different positions in the host plant.
