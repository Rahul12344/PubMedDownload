The histidine-rich protein 2 of Plasmodium falciparum is the most common malaria 
antigen targeted by rapid diagnostic tests for the specific diagnosis of P.
falciparum. Recently, pfhrp2 gene deletions have been documented in P. falciparum
isolates from South America and some multiple endemic countries in Africa and
Asia. Parasites with such gene deletions can produce false negative diagnostic
results using HRP2-based rapid diagnostic kits. In the present work, the
prevalence of P. falciparum parasites lacking pfhrp2, pfhrp3, which produces a
second P. falciparum antigen that is recognized by PfHRP2 -based rapid diagnostic
tests, and their flanking genes was evaluated in 135 P. falciparum isolates from 
Gash Barka region and in 9 isolates from Debub region, in Eritrea. In the
analyzed samples, 56% (81/144) of isolates were pfhrp2/pfhrp3 positive, while
9.7% (14/144) showed deletion of exon 2 of pfhrp2 gene and 43% (62/144) of
isolates lacked the pfhrp3 gene. These results suggest that the pfhrp2 and pfhrp3
deletion phenomenon is present in a considerable proportion in the study areas,
thus making the HRP2/3 based rapid diagnostic tests not completely reliable for
malaria diagnosis in Eritrea.
