Benzoxaboroles are effective against bacterial, fungal and protozoan pathogens.
We report potent activity of the benzoxaborole AN3661 against Plasmodium
falciparum laboratory-adapted strains (mean IC50 32 nM), Ugandan field isolates
(mean ex vivo IC50 64 nM), and murine P. berghei and P. falciparum infections
(day 4 ED90 0.34 and 0.57 mg kg-1, respectively). Multiple P. falciparum lines
selected in vitro for resistance to AN3661 harboured point mutations in pfcpsf3, 
which encodes a homologue of mammalian cleavage and polyadenylation specificity
factor subunit 3 (CPSF-73 or CPSF3). CRISPR-Cas9-mediated introduction of pfcpsf3
mutations into parental lines recapitulated AN3661 resistance. PfCPSF3 homology
models placed these mutations in the active site, where AN3661 is predicted to
bind. Transcripts for three trophozoite-expressed genes were lost in
AN3661-treated trophozoites, which was not observed in parasites selected or
engineered for AN3661 resistance. Our results identify the pre-mRNA processing
factor PfCPSF3 as a promising antimalarial drug target.
