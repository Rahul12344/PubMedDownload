FIKK kinases in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum are attractive
targets for new anti-malaria drugs, as they have no orthologues in humans and
have been linked to disease severity. Six FIKKs are known to be exported into red
blood cells (RBCs) where they mediate dramatic structural and functional changes 
to RBCs that are central to pathogenesis. Eleven members of this family, which
are predicted to be exported into infected RBCs (iRBCs), remain uncharacterised. 
Using a targeted gene-knockout approach, we have characterised these FIKKs and
discovered that five are essential for parasite survival. Three of these five
FIKKs (FIKK9.1, FIKK10.1, FIKK10.2) were exported from the parasite into iRBCs
and for two of these (FIKK9.1 and FIKK10.1), export was via Maurer's clefts
(parasite-derived structures involved in protein trafficking and pathognomonic of
falciparum malaria). Of the remaining two essential kinases, FIKK3 was associated
with rhoptries (specialised protein secretory organelles in the parasite) and
FIKK9.5 was localised in the parasite nucleus. The diverse localisation and
essentiality of these FIKKs demonstrate that they play different but essential
roles in the survival of P. falciparum in RBCs and therefore are attractive new
drug targets for the prevention or treatment of falciparum malaria.
