Malaria is still an important challenge for global public health because of its
extensive mortality and morbidity. Plasmodium ovale is mainly distributed in
tropical regions of Africa and Asia. it includes two distinct ovale malaria
species, which are P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri. Apical membrane
antigen-1 (AMA-1) is an asexual blood-stage protein which is essential for
Plasmodium. Thus far, no study on gene polymorphism and immunogenicity of P.
ovale AMA-1 (PoAMA-1) has been conducted. Amplified poama1 gene products from 14 
P ovale curtisi samples and 12 P ovale wallikeri samples imported from Africa to 
Jiangsu Province, China were sequenced and their polymorphisms were analyzed. We 
expressed recombinant PoAMA-1 (rPoAMA-1, 53 kDa) proteins in an E. coli
expression system and evaluated immune responses against the rPoAMA-1 in BALB/c
mice. We identified a synonymous mutation in nucleotide position 333 of the
pocama-1 gene and powama-1 did not reveal any variation. The humoral and cellular
immune responses to rPoAMA-1 were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry. rPoAMA-1-immunized mice produced specific
antibodies as verified by immunoblotting. The rPoAMA-1 induced high antibody
titers (1: 640,000), and had high avidity indexes (an average of 78.63% and
83.40%). The antibodies also recognized the native proteins, namely, crude
antigen from blood stages. Cross-reactivity between rPocAMA-1 and rPowAMA-1 was
observed. Moreover, rPoAMA-1 s induced interferon (IFN)-gamma-secreting cells in 
mice and increased lymphocyte proliferation response. Low genetic diversity was
observed in poama-1 from the Jiangsu Province imported malaria cases, and further
studies conclusively showed its strong immunogenicity. Significant
cross-reactivity was found between rPocAMA-1 and rPowAMA-1, suggesting that a
single PoAMA-1 antigen could be used to diagnose P. ovale curtisi or P. ovale
wallikeri patient simultaneously. However, further evaluation needs to be carried
out to validate the potential and limitations of PoAMA-1 as a candidate vaccine.
