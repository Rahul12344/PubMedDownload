To date, 11 studies conducted in different countries to test the association
between Plasmodium falciparum Na(+)/H(+) exchanger gene (pfnhe-1; PF13_0019)
polymorphisms and in vitro susceptibility to quinine have generated conflicting
data. In this context and to extend our knowledge of the genetic polymorphism of 
Pfnhe gene, we have sequenced the ms4760 locus from 595 isolates collected in the
Comoros (N = 250; an area with a high prevalence of chloroquine and
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance) and Madagascar (N = 345; a low
drug-resistance area). Among them, 29 different alleles were observed, including 
8 (27%) alleles not previously described. Isolates from the Comoros showed more
repeats in block II (DNNND), which some studies have found to be positively
associated with in vitro resistance to quinine, compared with isolates from
Madagascar. Additional studies are required to better define the mechanisms
underlying quinine resistance, which involve multiple gene interactions.
