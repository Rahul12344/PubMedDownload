A number of human genetic polymorphisms are prevalent in tropical populations and
appear to offer protection against symptomatic and/or severe malaria. We compared
the prevalence of four polymorphisms, the sickle hemoglobin mutation (β globin
E6V), the α-thalassemia 3.7kb deletion, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
deficiency caused by the common African variant (G6PD A-), and the CD36 T188G
mutation in 1344 individuals residing in districts in eastern (Tororo),
south-central (Jinja), and southwestern (Kanungu) Uganda. Genes of interest were 
amplified, amplicons subjected to mutation-specific restriction endonuclease
digestion (for sickle hemoglobin, G6PD A-, and CD36 T188G), reaction products
resolved by electrophoresis, and genotypes determined based on the sizes of
reaction products. Mutant genotypes were common, with many more heterozygous than
homozygous alleles identified. The prevalences (heterozygotes plus homozygotes)
of sickle hemoglobin (28% Tororo, 25% Jinja, 7% Kanungu), α-thalassemia (53%
Tororo, 45% Jinja, 18% Kanungu) and G6PD A- (29% Tororo, 18% Jinja, 8% Kanungu)
were significantly greater in Tororo and Jinja compared to Kanungu (p<0.0001 for 
all three alleles); prevalences were also significantly greater in Tororo
compared to Jinja for α-thalassemia (p=0.03) and G6PD A- (p<0.0001). For the CD36
T188G mutation, the prevalence was significantly greater in Tororo compared to
Jinja or Kanungu (27% Tororo, 17% Jinja, 18% Kanungu; p=0.0004 and 0.0017,
respectively). Considering ethnicity of study subjects, based on primary language
spoken, the prevalence of mutant genotypes was lower in Bantu compared to
non-Bantu language speakers, but in the Jinja cohort, the only study population
with a marked diversity of language groups, prevalence did not differ between
Bantu and non-Bantu speakers. These results indicate marked differences in human 
genetic features between populations in different regions of Uganda. These
differences might be explained by both ethnic variation and by varied malaria
risk in different regions of Uganda.
