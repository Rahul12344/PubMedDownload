The dominant cause of malaria in Malaysia is now Plasmodium knowlesi, a zoonotic 
parasite of cynomolgus macaque monkeys found throughout South East Asia.
Comparative genomic analysis of parasites adapted to in vitro growth in either
cynomolgus or human RBCs identified a genomic deletion that includes the gene
encoding normocyte-binding protein Xa (NBPXa) in parasites growing in cynomolgus 
RBCs but not in human RBCs. Experimental deletion of the NBPXa gene in parasites 
adapted to growth in human RBCs (which retain the ability to grow in cynomolgus
RBCs) restricted them to cynomolgus RBCs, demonstrating that this gene is
selectively required for parasite multiplication and growth in human RBCs.
NBPXa-null parasites could bind to human RBCs, but invasion of these cells was
severely impaired. Therefore, NBPXa is identified as a key mediator of P.
knowlesi human infection and may be a target for vaccine development against this
emerging pathogen.
