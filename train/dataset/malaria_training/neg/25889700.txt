BACKGROUND: Resistance to multiple classes of insecticides has been detected in
the malaria vector Anopheles albimanus in northwest Peru. Acetylcholinesterase
(AChE) insensitivity has previously been associated with resistance to
organophosphate (OP) and carbamate (CA) insecticides in arthropods. A single
point mutation on the ace-1 gene (G119S) associated with resistance to OPs and
CAs has been described previously in four anopheline species, but not in
field-collected An. albimanus. The present study aimed to characterize the role
of ace-1 in conferring resistance to both OPs and CAs in the An. albimanus
population in Tumbes, Peru.
METHODS: The frequency and intensity of resistance to OPs and CAs was quantified 
through bioassays of female An. albimanus collected between 2012 and 2014, and
the presence of insensitive AChE was confirmed using biochemical assays. A
portion of the ace-1 gene flanking codon 119 was amplified and sequenced from
individuals used in the bioassays and biochemical assays, as well as from
historical samples collected in 2008. Statistical analyses were conducted to
determine: (1) associations between genotype and AChE insensitivity; and, (2)
associations between genotype and resistance phenotype.
RESULTS: After confirming high levels of resistance to fenitrothion, malathion,
and bendiocarb through bioassays, two novel polymorphisms were identified at the 
first and second loci of codon 119, with all individuals from the 2012-2014
collections being heterozygous at the first base (G/T) and either heterozygous
(G/C) or homozygous mutants (C/C) at the second base. Based on sequence data from
historical samples, these mutations arose prior to 2008, but became fixed in the 
population between 2008 and 2012. Homozygotes at the second locus had
significantly higher levels of AChE insensitivity than heterozygotes (p <0.05).
Individuals phenotypically susceptible to OPs and CAs were more likely to be
heterozygous at the second locus (p <0.01). Cloning identified four individuals
each containing three distinct genotypes, suggesting that a duplication of the
ace-1 gene may have occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of heterozygotes at two loci and the presence of
three genotypes in four individuals suggest that balancing selection could be
maintaining OP and CA resistance in this population, while minimizing associated 
fitness costs.
