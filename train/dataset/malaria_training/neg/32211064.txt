Persistent insecticides sprayed onto house walls, and incorporated into
insecticide-treated bednets, provide long-acting, cost-effective control of
vector-borne diseases such as malaria and leishmaniasis. The high concentrations 
that occur immediately postdeployment may kill both resistant and susceptible
insects. However, insecticide concentration, and therefore killing ability,
declines in the months after deployment. As concentrations decline, resistant
insects start to survive, while susceptible insects are still killed. The period 
of time after deployment, within which the mortality of resistant individuals is 
lower than that of susceptible ones, has been termed the "window of selection" in
other contexts. It is recognized as driving resistance in bacteria and malaria
parasites, both of which are predominantly haploid. We argue that paying more
attention to these mortality differences can help understand the evolution of
insecticide resistance. Because insects are diploid, resistance encoded by single
genes generates heterozygotes. This gives the potential for a narrower "window of
dominance," within the window of selection, where heterozygote mortality is lower
than that of susceptible homozygotes. We explore the general properties of
windows of selection and dominance in driving resistance. We quantify their
likely effect using data from new laboratory experiments and published data from 
the laboratory and field. These windows can persist months or years after
insecticide deployments. Differential mortalities of resistant, susceptible and
heterozygous genotypes, after public health deployments, constitute a major
challenge to controlling resistance. Greater attention to mortality differences
by genotype would inform strategies to reduce the evolution of resistance to
existing and new insecticides.
