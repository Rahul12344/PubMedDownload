Bacillus thuringiensis is a well-known biopesticide that has been used for more
than 80 years. This spore-forming bacterium belongs to the group of Bacillus
cereus that also includes, among others, emetic and diarrheic pathotypes of B.
cereus, the animal pathogen Bacillus anthracis and the psychrotolerant Bacillus
weihenstephanensis. Bacillus thuringiensis is rather unique since it has adapted 
its lifestyle as an efficient pathogen of specific insect larvae. One of the
peculiarities of B. thuringiensis strains is the extent of their extrachromosomal
pool, with strains harbouring more than 10 distinct plasmid molecules. Among the 
numerous serovars of B. thuringiensis, 'israelensis' is certainly emblematic
since its host spectrum is apparently restricted to dipteran insects like
mosquitoes and black flies, vectors of human and animal diseases such as malaria,
yellow fever, or river blindness. In this review, the putative role of the mobile
gene pool of B. thuringiensis serovar israelensis in its pathogenicity and
dedicated lifestyle is reviewed, with specific emphasis on the nature, diversity,
and potential mobility of its constituents. Variations among the few related
strains of B. thuringiensis serovar israelensis will also be reported and
discussed in the scope of this specialised insect pathogen, whose lifestyle in
the environment remains largely unknown.
