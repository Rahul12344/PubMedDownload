System level knowledge of alterations in host is crucial to elucidate the
molecular events of viral pathogenesis and to develop strategies to block viral
establishment and amplification. Here, we applied quantitative proteomics
approach to study global proteome changes in the host; Spodoptera frugiperda upon
infection by a baculovirus, Spodoptera litura NPV at two stages i.e. 12 h and
72 h post infection. At 12 hpi, >95% of host proteins remained stable, however at
72 hpi, 52% host proteins exhibited downregulation of 2-fold or more. Functional 
analysis revealed significant upregulation of transposition and proteasomal
machinery while translation, transcription, protein export and oxidative
phosphorylation pathways were adversely affected. An assessment of perturbed
proteome after viral infection and viral miRNA expression led to the
identification of 117 genes that are potential targets of 10 viral miRNAs. Using 
miRNA mimics, we confirmed the down regulation of 9 host genes. The results
comprehensively show dynamics of host responses after viral infection.
