Malaria infection renders humans more attractive to Anopheles gambiae sensu lato 
mosquitoes than uninfected people. The mechanisms remain unknown. We found that
an isoprenoid precursor produced by Plasmodium falciparum,
(E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMBPP), affects A. gambiae s.l. 
blood meal seeking and feeding behaviors as well as susceptibility to infection. 
HMBPP acts indirectly by triggering human red blood cells to increase the release
of CO2, aldehydes, and monoterpenes, which together enhance vector attraction and
stimulate vector feeding. When offered in a blood meal, HMBPP modulates neural,
antimalarial, and oogenic gene transcription without affecting mosquito survival 
or fecundity; in a P. falciparum-infected blood meal, sporogony is increased.
