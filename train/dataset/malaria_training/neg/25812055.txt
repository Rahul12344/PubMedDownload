Malaria is a major public health problem in north-east India mainly transmitted
by Anopheles baimai and An. minimus while Anopheles nivipes plays an important
supportive role. The genetic diversity of An. nivipes in north-east India was
investigated by employing two mitochondrial DNA markers namely NADH dehydrogenase
5 (ND5) and cytochrome oxidase sub unit II (COII). High genetic diversity in An. 
nivipes was observed by the detection of 16 haplotypes among 30 sequences of ND5 
gene and 29 haplotypes among 29 COII sequences. Anopheles nivipes of north-east
India was significantly differentiated genetically with that of neighboring
South-east Asian An. nivipes as revealed by pairwise FST values of 0.127
(p < 0.01) and 0.044 (p < 0.001) for ND5 and COII genes, respectively, suggesting
geographical barriers to gene flow in this species between the two geographical
areas resulting in significant population structuring.
