Emerging evidence suggests that the DNA-sensing pathway plays a crucial role in
innate immunity against multiple diseases, especially infectious diseases. Cyclic
GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), as a DNA sensor, and stimulator of interferon (IFN)
genes (STING), as an adaptor protein, are the central components that link DNA
sensing to immunologic functions - including, but not limited to, the type I IFN 
response. Recently, a series of studies have revealed that genomic DNA from
protozoan parasites triggers the cGAS-STING pathway, and these studies identified
the positive and negative regulators that modulate the signaling in parasite
infection. Here, we summarize current understanding of the critical functions and
potential applications of the cGAS-STING axis in parasitic diseases, specifically
those caused by malaria parasites.
