BACKGROUND: The genetic complexity and the existence of several polymorphisms in 
parasites are the major hindrances for the malaria control programmes of the
country. The genetic profiling in the parasite populations in India will provide 
useful baseline data for future studies elucidating the parasite structure and
distribution of drug resistance genotypes in different regions.
METHODS: The blood samples of symptomatic patients were collected and analysed
for drug resistance genes (Pfcrt, Pfmdr-1, dhfr, dhps and k13) and gametocyte
genes (Pfs25, Pfg377); in vitro drug sensitivity assay by schizont maturation
inhibition (SMI) was also performed in adapted field isolates.
RESULTS: Of the 122 field isolates analysed; 65.5% showed Pfcrt K76T mutant
alleles, 61.4% Pfmdr-1 N86Y mutants, 59.5% dhfr mutants, 59.8% dhps mutants was
observed, but no polymorphism was seen for k13. The sequence analysis of Pfg377
gene revealed five types of populations in the field isolates. The inhibitory
concentrations (IC50) for anti-malarial drugs viz chloroquine (CQ), artesunate
(AS), were in the range of 10.11-113.2 nM and 2.26-4.08 nM, respectively, in the 
field isolates evaluate by in vitro assay. The IC50 values for CQ have shown a
remarkable reduction on comparison with the previous available data, whereas a
slight increase in the IC50 values for AS was observed in the study.
CONCLUSIONS: The increase in mutation rate in drug resistance allelic loci with
inhibitory concentration of CQ and AS drugs was observed in the field isolates
and high diversity in Pfg377 gametocyte gene indicate towards parasite
multifactorial behaviour. The knowledge of the prevalent drug resistance genes is
important for intervention measures to be successful and efforts should also be
made to prevent transmission of P. falciparum.
