Analysis of gene function in Plasmodium falciparum, the most important human
malaria parasite, is restricted by the lack of robust and simple reverse genetic 
tools. Approaches to manipulate protein levels post-translationally are powerful 
tools to study protein-off effects especially in the haploid malaria parasite
where genetic knockouts of essential genes are lethal. We investigated if the
auxin-inducible degron system is functional in P. falciparum and found that
degron-tagged yellow fluorescent protein levels were efficiently reduced upon
addition of auxin which otherwise had no effect on parasite viability. The
genetic components required in this conditional approach were co-expressed in P. 
falciparum by applying the small peptide 2A. 2A is a self-processing peptide from
Foot-And-Mouth Disease virus that allows the whole conditional system to be
accommodated on a single plasmid vector and ensures stoichiometric expression
levels.
