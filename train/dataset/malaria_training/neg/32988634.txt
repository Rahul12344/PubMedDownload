Multiple hosts and various life cycle stages prompt the human malaria parasite,
Plasmodium falciparum, to acquire sophisticated molecular mechanisms to ensure
its survival, spread, and transmission to its next host. To face these
environmental challenges, increasing evidence suggests that the parasite has
developed complex and complementary layers of regulatory mechanisms controlling
gene expression. Here, we discuss the recent developments in the discovery of
molecular components that contribute to cell replication and differentiation and 
highlight the major contributions of epigenetics, transcription factors, and
nuclear architecture in controlling gene regulation and life cycle progression in
Plasmodium spp.
