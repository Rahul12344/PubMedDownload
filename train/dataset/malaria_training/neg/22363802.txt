HIV-1 infection increases the risk and severity of malaria by poorly defined
mechanisms. We investigated the effect of HIV-1(Ba-L) infection of
monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) on phagocytosis of opsonised P. falciparum
infected erythrocytes (IE) and subsequent proinflammatory cytokine secretion.
Compared to mock-infected MDM, HIV-1 infection significantly inhibited
phagocytosis of IE (median (IQR) (10 (0-28) versus (34 (27-108); IE
internalised/100 MDM; p = 0.001) and decreased secretion of IL-6 (1,116
(352-3,387) versus 1,552 (889-6,331); pg/mL; p = 0.0078) and IL-1β (16 (7-21)
versus 33 (27-65); pg/mL; p = 0.0078). Thus inadequate phagocytosis and cytokine 
production may contribute to impaired control of malaria in HIV-1 infected
individuals.
