BACKGROUND: The efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for
Plasmodium falciparum malaria may be threatened by parasites with reduced
responsiveness to artemisinins. Among 298 ACT-treated children from Mbita, Kenya,
submicroscopic persistence of P. falciparum on day 3 posttreatment was associated
with subsequent microscopically detected parasitemia at days 28 or 42.
METHODS: DNA sequences of resistance-associated parasite loci pfcrt, pfmdr1,
pfubp1, and pfap2mu were determined in the Mbita cohort before treatment, on days
2 and 3 after initiation of treatment, and on the day of treatment failure.
RESULTS: Parasites surviving ACT on day 2 or day 3 posttreatment were
significantly more likely than the baseline population to carry the wild-type
haplotypes of pfcrt (CVMNK at codons 72-76; P < .001) and pfmdr1 (NFD at codons
86, 184, 1246; P < .001). In contrast, variant alleles of the novel candidate
resistance genes pfap2mu (S160N/T; P = .006) and pfubp-1 (E1528D; P < .001) were 
significantly more prevalent posttreatment. No genetic similarities were found to
artemisinin-tolerant parasites recently described in Cambodia.
CONCLUSIONS: Among treated children in western Kenya, certain P. falciparum
genotypes defined at pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfap2mu, and pfubp1 more often survive ACT at
the submicroscopic level, and contribute to onward transmission and subsequent
patent recrudescence.
