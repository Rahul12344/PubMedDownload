Populations exposed to Plasmodium infection develop genetic mechanisms of
protection against severe disease. The clinical manifestation of malaria results 
primarily from the lysis of infected erythrocytes and subsequent immune and
inflammatory responses. Herein, we review the genetic alterations associated with
erythrocytes or mediators of the immune system, which might influence malaria
outcome. Moreover, polymorphisms in genes related to molecules involved in
mechanisms of cytoadherence and their influence on malaria pathology are also
discussed. The results of some studies have suggested that the combinatorial
effects of a set of genetic factors in the erythrocyte-immunology pathway might
be relevant to host resistance or susceptibility against Plasmodium infection.
However, these results must be interpreted with caution because of the
differences observed in the functionality and frequency of polymorphisms within
different populations. With the recent advances in molecular biology techniques, 
more robust studies with reliable data have been reported, and the results of
these studies have identified individual genetic factors for consideration in
preventing severe disease and the individual response to treatment.
