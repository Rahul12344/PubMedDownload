[Overviews on Plasmodium ovale wallikeri and its genetic detection system].

[Article in Chinese]

Li M, Xia ZG, Tang LH.

In recent years, some microscopy-positive but nest-PCR negative (based on small
subunit ribosomal RNA gene) ovale malaria cases were reported. The detection
failure was due to the genetic variations between Plasomdoium ovale wallikeri and
P. ovale curtisi. This paper reviews the discovery and validation processes of P.
ovale wallikeri and the detection systems for identification of P. ovale.
