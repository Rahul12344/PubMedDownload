BACKGROUND: Polyclonal blood-stage infections of Plasmodium vivax are frequent
even in low transmission settings, allowing meiotic recombination between
heterologous parasites. Empirical data on meiotic products are however lacking.
This study examined microsatellites in oocysts derived by membrane feeding of
mosquitoes from blood-stage P. vivax infections at the Thai-Myanmar border.
METHODS: Blood samples from patients presenting with vivax malaria were fed to
Anopheles cracens by membrane feeding and individual oocysts from midguts were
obtained by dissection after 7 days. DNA was extracted from oocysts and parental 
blood samples and tested by microsatellite analysis.
RESULTS: A focused study of eight microsatellite markers was undertaken for nine 
blood stage infections from 2013, for which derived oocysts were studied in six
cases. One or more alleles were successfully amplified for 131 oocysts, revealing
high levels of allelic diversity in both blood and oocyst stages. Based on
standard criteria for defining minor alleles, there was evidence of clear
deviation from random mating (inbreeding) with relatively few heterozygous
oocysts compared to variance across the entire oocyst population (FIT = 0.89).
The main explanation appeared to be natural compartmentalisation at mosquito
(FSC = 0.27) and human stages (FCT = 0.68). One single human case produced a
total of 431 successfully amplified loci (across 70 oocysts) that were homozygous
and identical to parental alleles at all markers, indicating clonal infection and
transmission. Heterozygous oocyst alleles were found at 15/176 (8.5%)
successfully amplified loci in the other five cases. There was apparently reduced
oocyst heterozygosity in individual oocysts compared to diversity within
individual mosquitoes (FIS = 0.55), but this may simply reflect the difficulty of
detecting minor alleles in oocysts, given the high rate of amplification failure.
Inclusion of minor allele peaks (irrespective of height) when matching peaks were
found in related blood or oocyst samples, added 11 minor alleles for 9 oocysts,
increasing the number of heterozygous loci to 26/176 (14.8%; p = 0.096).
CONCLUSION: There was an apparently low level of heterozygous oocysts but this
can be explained by a combination of factors: relatively low complexity of
parental infection, natural compartmentalisation in humans and mosquitoes, and
the methodological challenge of detecting minor alleles.
