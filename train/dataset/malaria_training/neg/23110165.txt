It has been proposed that ovale malaria in humans is caused by two closely
related but distinct species of malaria parasites: P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale 
wallikeri. We have extended and optimized a Real-time PCR assay targeting the
parasite's small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssrRNA) gene to detect both these
species. When the assay was applied to 31 archival blood samples from patients
diagnosed with P. ovale, it was found that the infection in 20 was due to P.
ovale curtisi and in the remaining 11 to P. ovale wallikeri. Thus, this assay
provides a useful tool that can be applied to epidemiological investigations of
the two newly recognized distinct P. ovale species, that might reveal if these
species also differ in their clinical manifestation, drugs susceptibility and
relapse periodicity. The results presented confirm that P. ovale wallikeri is not
confined to Southeast Asia, since the majority of the patients analyzed in this
study had acquired their P. ovale infection in African countries, mostly situated
in West Africa.
