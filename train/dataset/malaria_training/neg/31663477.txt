BACKGROUND: It has been shown that curcumin (Cur) has anti-plasmodial activity;
however, its weak bioavailability, rapid metabolism, and limited chemical
stability have restricted its application in clinical usages. Nanostructured
lipid carriers (NLCs) are a type of Drug-Delivery Systems (DDSs) whose core
matrix is composed of both solid and liquid lipids.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to prepare and characterize
curcumin-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers (Cur-NLC) for malaria treatment.
METHODS: For producing NLC, coconut oil and cetyl palmitate were selected as a
liquid and solid lipid, respectively. In order to prepare the Cur-NLC, the
microemulsion method was applied. General toxicity assay on Artemia salina as
well as hemocompatibility was investigated. Anti-plasmodial activity was studied 
on mice infected with Plasmodium berghei.
RESULTS: The NLCs mean particle size and Polydispersity Index (PI) were 145 nm
and 0.3, respectively. Further, the zeta potential of the Cur-NLC was -25 mV. The
NLCs indicated a pseudo-spherical shape observed via transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). The loading capacity and encapsulation efficacy of the obtained
Cur-NLC were 3.1 ± 0.015% and 74 ± 3.32%, respectively. In vitro, Cur release
profiles showed a sustained-release pattern up to 5 days in the synthesized
Cur-NLC. The results of in vivo antiplasmodial activity against P. berghei
revealed that antimalarial activity of Cur-NLC was significantly higher compared 
with that of free Cur at the dose of 40 mg/kg/day.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggested that NLC would be used as a
potential nanocarrier for the treatment of malaria.
