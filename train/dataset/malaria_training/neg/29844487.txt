Here, we report the application of a portable sequencer, MinION, for genotyping
the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. In the present study, an amplicon
mixture of nine representative genes causing resistance to anti-malaria drugs is 
diagnosed. First, we developed the procedure for four laboratory strains (3D7,
Dd2, 7G8, and K1), and then applied the developed procedure to ten clinical
samples. We sequenced and re-sequenced the samples using the obsolete flow cell
R7.3 and the most recent flow cell R9.4. Although the average base-call accuracy 
of the MinION sequencer was 74.3%, performing >50 reads at a given position
improves the accuracy of the SNP call, yielding a precision and recall rate of
0.92 and 0.8, respectively, with flow cell R7.3. These numbers increased
significantly with flow cell R9.4, in which the precision and recall are 1 and
0.97, respectively. Based on the SNP information, the drug resistance status in
ten clinical samples was inferred. We also analyzed K13 gene mutations from 54
additional clinical samples as a proof of concept. We found that a novel
amino-acid changing variation is dominant in this area. In addition, we performed
a small population-based analysis using 3 and 5 cases (K13) and 10 and 5 cases
(PfCRT) from Thailand and Vietnam, respectively. We identified distinct genotypes
from the respective regions. This approach will change the standard methodology
for the sequencing diagnosis of malaria parasites, especially in developing
countries.
