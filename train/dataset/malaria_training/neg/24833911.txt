BACKGROUND: At present, malaria cases in Suriname occur predominantly in migrants
and people living and/or working in areas with gold mining operations. A
molecular survey was performed in Plasmodium falciparum isolates originating from
persons from gold mining areas to assess the extent and role of mining areas as
reservoirs of malaria resistance in Suriname.
METHODS: The status of 14 putative resistance-associated single nucleotide
polymorphisms in the pfdhfr, pfcrt, pfmdr1, and pfATP6 genes was assessed for 28 
samples from gold miners diagnosed with P. falciparum malaria using polymerase
chain reaction amplification and restriction fragment length polymorphism
analysis, and the results were compared with earlier data from nonmining
villagers.
RESULTS: Isolates from miners showed a high degree of homogeneity, with a fixed
pfdhfr Ile51/Asn108, pfmdr1 Phe184/Asp1042/Tyr1246, and pfcrt Thr76 mutant
genotype, while an exclusively wild-type genotype was observed for pfmdr1 Asn86
and pfdhfr Ala16, Cys59, and Ile164, and for the pfATP6 positions
Leu263/Ala623/Ser769. Small variations were observed for pfmdr1 S1034C. No
statistically significant difference could be detected in allele frequencies
between mining and nonmining villagers.
CONCLUSION: Despite the increased risk of malaria infection in individuals
working/living in gold mining areas, we did not detect an increase in mutation
frequency at the 14 analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms. Therefore, mining
areas in Suriname cannot yet be considered as reservoirs for malaria resistance.
