The genomic architecture of organisms, including nucleotide composition, can be
highly variable, even among closely-related species. To better understand the
causes leading to structural variation in genomes, information on distinct and
diverse genomic features is needed. Malaria parasites are known for encompassing 
a wide range of genomic GC-content and it has long been thought that Plasmodium
falciparum, the virulent malaria parasite of humans, has the most AT-biased
eukaryotic genome. Here, I perform comparative genomic analyses of the most
AT-rich eukaryotes sequenced to date, and show that the avian malaria parasites
Plasmodium gallinaceum, P. ashfordi, and P. relictum have the most extreme coding
sequences in terms of AT-bias. Their mean GC-content is 21.21, 21.22 and 21.60 %,
respectively, which is considerably lower than the transcriptome of P. falciparum
(23.79 %) and other eukaryotes. This information enables a better understanding
of genome evolution and raises the question of how certain organisms are able to 
prosper despite severe compositional constraints.
