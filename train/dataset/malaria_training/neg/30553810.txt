Parasites of the genus Plasmodium infect a wide array of hosts, causing malaria
in all major groups of terrestrial vertebrates including primates, reptiles, and 
birds. Molecular mechanisms explaining why some Plasmodium species are virulent, 
while other closely related malaria pathogens are relatively benign in the same
hosts, remain unclear. Here, we present the RNA sequencing and subsequent
transcriptome assembly of two avian Plasmodium parasites which can eventually be 
used to better understand the genetic mechanisms underlying Plasmodium species
pathogenicity in an avian host. Plasmodium homocircumflexum, a cryptic,
pathogenic species that often causes mortality and Plasmodium delichoni, a newly 
described, relatively benign malaria parasite that does not kill its hosts, were 
used to experimentally infect two Eurasian siskins (Carduelis spinus). RNA
extractions were performed and RNA sequencing was completed using high throughput
Illumina sequencing. Using established bioinformatics pipelines, the sequencing
data from both species were used to generate transcriptomes using published
Plasmodium species genomes as a scaffold. The finalized transcriptome of P.
homocircumflexum contained 21,612 total contigs while that of P. delichoni
contained 12,048 contigs. We were able to identify many genes implicated in
erythrocyte invasion actively expressed in both P. homocircumflexum and P.
delichoni, including the well described vaccine candidates Apical Membrane
Antigen-1 (AMA-1) and Merozoite Surface Protein 1 (MSP1). This work acts as a
stepping stone to increase available data on avian Plasmodium parasites, thus
enabling future research into the evolution of pathogenicity in malaria.
