BACKGROUND: The increasing spread of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors
has been well documented across sub-Saharan Africa countries. The influence of
irrigation on increasing vector resistance is poorly understood, and is critical 
to successful and ethical implementation of food security policies. This study
investigated the insecticide resistance status of An. gambiae (s.l.) mosquitoes
collected from the irrigated rice area of Okyereko, a village containing about 42
hectares of irrigated field within an irrigation project plan in the Central
Region of Ghana. Large amounts of insecticides, herbicides and fertilizers are
commonly used in the area to boost the annual production of the rice.
METHODS: Mosquito larvae were collected and adults were assayed from the F1
progeny. The resistance status, allele and genotype were characterized using WHO 
susceptibility testing and PCR methods respectively.
RESULTS: The An. gambiae (s.l.) populations from Okyereko are highly resistant to
DDT and pyrethroid insecticides, with possible involvement of metabolic
mechanisms including the elevation of P450 and GST enzyme as well as P-gp
activity. The population was mostly composed of An. coluzzii specimens (more than
96 %) with kdr and ace-1 frequencies of 0.9 and 0.2 %, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study brings additional information on insecticide resistance
and the characterization of An. gambiae (s.l.) mosquitoes from Okyereko, which
can be helpful in decision making for vector control programmes in the region.
