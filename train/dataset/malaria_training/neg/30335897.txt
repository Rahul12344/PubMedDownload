As a first line medicine for malaria treatment, artesunate (ART) also shows
antitumor potential. However, little is known about the effect of ART on the
cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this study, we found that
ART inhibited cell growth in SK-HEP1 and SM7721 hepatocellular carcinoma cell
lines. A microarray was used to identify differentially expressed protein-coding 
RNAs (pcRNA) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) between SK-HEP1 cells with and
without ART treatment. A differentially expressed lncRNA-RP11, the most related
to the EMT of liver cancer cells-RP11 was identified by abioinformatics method
Overexpressing and silencing assays were used to verify the role of RP11 in
cancer cell EMT. The levels of RP11- and EMT-related genes in liver cancer
samples from 75 patients were detected by using qualitative polymerase chain
reaction or immunohistochemistry. We identified 1334 pcRNAs and 1670 lncRNA with 
differential expression induced by ART. ART inhibits EMT, proliferation,
migration, invasion, and adhesion of liver cancer cells. RP11 depresses the
inhibitory effect of ART on cancer cell EMT. The level of RP11 is associated with
cancer cell EMT and metastasis and survival rate of the patient. These data
suggest that RP11-linking ART and cancer cell EMT are important for ART-inhibited
metastasis of liver cancer.
