This article outlines genome-scale approaches that can be used to identify
mutations in malaria (Plasmodium) parasites that underlie drug resistance and
contribute to treatment failure. These approaches include genetic mapping by
linkage or genome-wide association studies, drug selection and characterization
of resistant mutants, and the identification of genome regions under strong
recent selection. While these genomic approaches can identify candidate
resistance loci, genetic manipulation is needed to demonstrate causality. We
therefore also describe the growing arsenal of available transfection approaches 
for direct incrimination of mutations suspected to play a role in resistance. Our
intention is both to review past progress and highlight promising approaches for 
future investigations.
