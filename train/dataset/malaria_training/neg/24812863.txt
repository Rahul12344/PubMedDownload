OBJECTIVE: To identify the species of malaria parasites in 5 imported cases
previously diagnosed as vivax malaria.
METHODS: Epidemiological information and blood samples were collected from five
patients who returned from Africa and were diagnosed as vivax malaria. The
detection was conducted by microscopy, right VIEW rapid malaria test (RDTs) and
nested PCR with Plasmodium genus-specific and species-specific primers. The
amplified products were sequenced and Blast analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Three of the 5 cases had a history of malaria attack. Microscopically, 4
cases were confirmed as Plasmodium ovale infection, 1 (case 1) was co-infected
with P. vivax and P. ovale. All 5 cases showed negative RDT results. Nested PCR
detection revealed that the 5 cases had a P. ovale-specific fragment (800 bp),
while case 1 had a P. vivax-specific fragment (120 bp) concurrently. Blast
analysis showed that the amplified sequence of the 5 cases had a high sequence
homology (99%) with P. ovale gene for small subunit ribosomal RNA from GenBank,
and that of case 1 also shared 99% homology with P. vivax isolate SV5 18S
ribosomal RNA gene (GenBank accession number: JQ627157.1).
CONCLUSION: Among the five cases, four were infected by Plasmodium ovale, and one
was co-infected with both P. vivax and P. ovale.
