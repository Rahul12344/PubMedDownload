This study investigated loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) detection
of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in urine and saliva of malaria
patients. From May to November 2011, 108 febrile patients referred to health
centers in Sistan and Baluchestan Province of south-eastern Iran participated in 
the study. Saliva, urine, and blood samples were analyzed with nested PCR and
LAMP targeting the species-specific nucleotide sequence of small subunit
ribosomal RNA gene (18S rRNA) of P. falciparum and P. vivax and evaluated for
diagnostic accuracy by comparison to blood nested PCR assay. When nested PCR of
blood is used as standard, microscopy and nested PCR of saliva and urine samples 
showed sensitivity of 97.2%, 89.4% and 71% and specificity of 100%, 97.3% and
100%, respectively. LAMP sensitivity of blood, saliva, and urine was 95.8%, 47%
and 29%, respectively, whereas LAMP specificity of these samples was 100%.
Microscopy and nested PCR of saliva and LAMP of blood were comparable to nested
PCR of blood (к=0.95, 0.83, and 0.94, respectively), but agreement for nested PCR
of urine was moderate (к=0.64) and poor to fair for saliva LAMP and urine LAMP
(к=0.38 and 0.23, respectively). LAMP assay showed low sensitivity for detection 
of Plasmodium DNA in human saliva and urine compared to results with blood and to
nested PCR of blood, saliva, and urine. However, considering the advantages of
LAMP technology and of saliva and urine sampling, further research into the
method is worthwhile. LAMP protocol and precise preparation protocols need to be 
defined and optimized for template DNA of saliva and urine.
