Wolbachia are maternally transmitted intracellular bacteria that invade insect
populations by manipulating their reproduction and immunity and thus limiting the
spread of numerous human pathogens. Experimental Wolbachia infections can reduce 
Plasmodium numbers in Anopheles mosquitoes in the laboratory, however, natural
Wolbachia infections in field anophelines have never been reported. Here we show 
evidence of Wolbachia infections in Anopheles gambiae in Burkina Faso, West
Africa. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene identified Wolbachia sequences in both
female and male germlines across two seasons, and determined that these sequences
are vertically transmitted from mother to offspring. Whole-genome sequencing of
positive samples suggests that the genetic material identified in An. gambiae
belongs to a novel Wolbachia strain, related to but distinct from strains
infecting other arthropods. The evidence of Wolbachia infections in natural
Anopheles populations promotes further investigations on the possible use of
natural Wolbachia-Anopheles associations to limit malaria transmission.
