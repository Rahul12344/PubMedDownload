The occurrence of haemosporidians in biting midges of the genus Culicoides is
examined in North-East Bulgaria in order to reveal their potential role for
parasite transmission. A PCR-based technique amplifying part of the mitochondrial
cytochrome b gene of the parasite is applied on naturally infected biting midges.
Totally, 640 parous individuals of four species and 95 blood-fed individuals of
six species of Culicoides are examined for the presence of DNA of
haemosporidians. Haemosporidian genetic lineages are identified in individuals of
three insect species: Culicoides alazanicus (12 lineages, nine lineages of
Haemoproteus and three lineages of Plasmodium), Culicoides festivipennis and
Culicoides circumscriptus (with two and one lineages of Haemoproteus,
respectively). Two genetic lineages of Haemoproteus are recorded in more than one
vector species. These results demonstrate variations in the specificity of
Haemoproteus genetic lineages to their potential vectors, since some lineages are
recorded in a single vector species and others occur in two or more vector
species.
