Understanding the spatial clustering of Plasmodium falciparum populations can
assist efforts to contain drug-resistant parasites and maintain the efficacy of
future drugs. We sequenced single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the
dihydropteroate synthase gene (dhps) associated with sulfadoxine resistance and 5
microsatellite loci flanking dhps in order to investigate the genetic
backgrounds, genetic relatedness, and geographic clustering of falciparum
parasites in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Resistant haplotypes
were clustered into subpopulations: one in the northeast DRC, and the other in
the balance of the DRC. Network and clonal lineage analyses of the flanking
microsatellites indicate that geographically-distinct mutant dhps haplotypes
derive from separate lineages. The DRC is therefore a watershed for haplotypes
associated with sulfadoxine resistance. Given the importance of central Africa as
a corridor for the spread of antimalarial resistance, the identification of the
mechanisms of this transit can inform future policies to contain drug-resistant
parasite strains.
