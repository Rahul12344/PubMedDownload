BACKGROUND: PermaNet® 3.0 is an insecticide synergist-combination long-lasting
insecticidal net designed to have increased efficacy against malaria vectors with
metabolic resistance, even when combined with kdr. The current study reports on
the impact of this improved tool on entomological indices in an area with
pyrethroid-resistant malaria vectors in Nigeria.
METHODS: Baseline entomological indices across eight villages in Remo North LGA
of Ogun State provided the basis for selection of three villages (Ilara, Irolu
and Ijesa) for comparing the efficacy of PermaNet® 3.0 (PN3.0), PermaNet® 2.0
(PN2.0) and untreated polyester nets as a control (UTC). In each case, nets were 
distributed to cover all sleeping spaces and were evaluated for insecticidal
activity on a 3-monthly basis. Collection of mosquitoes was conducted monthly via
window traps and indoor resting catches. The arithmetic means of mosquito catches
per house, entomological inoculation rates before and during the intervention
were compared as well as three other outcome parameters: the mean mosquito blood 
feeding rate, mean mortality and mean parity rates.
RESULTS: Anopheles gambiae s.l. was the main malaria vector in the three
villages, accounting for >98% of the Anopheles population and found in
appreciable numbers for 6-7 months. Deltamethrin, permethrin and
lambdacyhalothrin resistance were confirmed at Ilara, Irolu and Ijesa. The kdr
mutation was the sole resistance mechanism at Ilara, whereas kdr plus P450-based 
metabolic mechanisms were detected at Irolu and Ijesa. Bioassays repeated on
domestically used PN 2.0 and PN 3.0 showed persistent optimal (100%) bio-efficacy
for both net types after the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th month following net
distribution. The use of PN 3.0 significantly reduced mosquito densities with a
'mass killing' effect inside houses. Households with PN 3.0 also showed reduced
blood feeding as well as lower mosquito parity and sporozoite rates compared to
the PN 2.0 and the UTC villages. A significant reduction in the entomological
inoculation rate was detected in both the PN 2.0 village (75%) and PN 3.0 village
(97%) post LLIN-distribution and not in the UTC village.
CONCLUSION: The study confirms the efficacy of PN 3.0 in reducing malaria
transmission compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs in the presence of malaria vectors
with P450-based metabolic- resistance mechanisms.
