SUMMARY: There is an immediate need for tools to both analyse and visualize in
real-time single-nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions and deletions, and other
structural variants from new sequence file formats. We have developed VarB
software that can be used to visualize variant call format files in real time, as
well as identify regions under balancing selection and informative markers to
differentiate user-defined groups (e.g. populations). We demonstrate its utility 
using sequence data from 50 Plasmodium falciparum isolates comprising two
different continents and confirm known signals from genomic regions that contain 
important antigenic and anti-malarial drug-resistance genes.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The C++-based software VarB and user manual are 
available from www.pathogenseq.org/varb.
