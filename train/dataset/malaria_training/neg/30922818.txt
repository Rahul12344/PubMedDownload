BACKGROUND: Resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
threatens the antimalarial effectiveness of intermittent preventive treatment
during pregnancy (IPTp) in sub-Saharan Africa. We aimed to assess the
associations between markers of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance in P
falciparum and the effectiveness of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine IPTp for
malaria-associated outcomes.
METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched databases
(from Jan 1, 1990 to March 1, 2018) for clinical studies (aggregated data) or
surveys (individual participant data) that reported data on low birthweight
(primary outcome) and malaria by sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine IPTp dose, and for
studies that reported on molecular markers of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
resistance. Studies that involved only HIV-infected women or combined
interventions were excluded. We did a random-effects meta-analysis (clinical
studies) or multivariate log-binomial regression (surveys) to obtain summarised
dose-response data (relative risk reduction [RRR]) and multivariate
meta-regression to explore the modifying effects of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
resistance (as indicated by Ala437Gly, Lys540Glu, and Ala581Gly substitutions in 
the dhps gene). This study is registered with PROSPERO, number 42016035540.
FINDINGS: Of 1097 records screened, 57 studies were included in the
aggregated-data meta-analysis (including 59 457 births). The RRR for low
birthweight declined with increasing prevalence of dhps Lys540Glu (ptrend=0·0060)
but not Ala437Gly (ptrend=0·35). The RRR was 7% (95% CI 0 to 13) in areas of high
resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (Lys540Glu ≥90% in east and southern
Africa; n=11), 21% (14 to 29) in moderate-resistance areas (Ala437Gly ≥90%
[central and west Africa], or Lys540Glu ≥30% to <90% [east and southern Africa]; 
n=16), and 27% (21 to 33) in low-resistance areas (Ala437Gly <90% [central and
west Africa], or Lys540Glu <30% [east and southern Africa]; n=30; ptrend=0·0054
[univariate], I2=69·5%). The overall RRR in all resistance strata was 21% (17 to 
25). In the analysis of individual participant data from 13 surveys (42 394
births), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine IPTp was associated with reduced prevalence of
low birthweight in areas with a Lys540Glu prevalence of more than 90% and
Ala581Gly prevalence of less than 10% (RRR 10% [7 to 12]), but not in those with 
an Ala581Gly prevalence of 10% or higher (pooled Ala581Gly prevalence 37% [range 
29 to 46]; RRR 0·5% [-16 to 14]; 2326 births).
INTERPRETATION: The effectiveness of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine IPTp is reduced in
areas with high resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine among P falciparum
parasites, but remains associated with reductions in low birthweight even in
areas where dhps Lys540Glu prevalence exceeds 90% but where the sextuple-mutant
parasite (harbouring the additional dhps Ala581Gly mutation) is uncommon.
Therapeutic alternatives to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine IPTp are needed in areas
where the prevalence of the sextuple-mutant parasite exceeds 37%.
