The saliva of hematophagous arthropods injected during blood feeding contains
potent pharmacologically active components to counteract the host hemostatic and 
inflammatory systems. In the present study, dominant salivary gland transcripts
of Panstrongylus chinai, a vector of Chagas disease, were analyzed by sequencing 
randomly selected clones of the salivary gland cDNA library. This analysis showed
that 56.5% of the isolated transcripts coded for putative secreted proteins, of
which 73.7% coded for proteins belonging to the lipocalin family. The most
abundant transcript of lipocalin family proteins was a homologue of pallidipin 2,
an inhibitor of collagen-induced platelet aggregation of Triatoma pallidipennis. 
In addition, homologues of triafestin, an inhibitor of the kallikrein-kinin
system of T. infestans, were identified as the dominant transcript. Other
salivary transcripts encoding lipocalin family proteins had homology to triplatin
(an inhibitor of platelet aggregation) and others with unknown function. Other
than lipocalin family proteins, homologues of a Kazal-type serine protease
inhibitor (putative anticoagulant), a hemolysin-like protein (unknown function), 
inositol polyphosphate 5-related protein (a regulator of membrane
phosphoinositide), antigen 5-related protein (unknown function) and apyrase
(platelet aggregation inhibitor) were identified.
