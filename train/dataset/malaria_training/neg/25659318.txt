Post-translational modifications play crucial parts in regulating protein
function and thereby control several fundamental aspects of eukaryotic biology,
including cell signalling, protein trafficking, epigenetic control of gene
expression, cell-cell interactions, and cell proliferation and differentiation.
In this Review, we discuss protein modifications that have been shown to have a
key role in malaria parasite biology and pathogenesis. We focus on
phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation and lipidation. We provide an overview 
of the biological significance of these modifications and discuss prospects and
progress in antimalarial drug discovery based on the inhibition of the enzymes
that mediate these modifications.
