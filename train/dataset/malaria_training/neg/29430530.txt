Introduction: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and sporadic amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (SALS) are both motor neuron disorders. SMA results from the deletion
of the survival motor neuron (SMN) 1 gene. High or low SMN1 copy number and the
absence of SMN2 have been reported as risk factors for the development or
severity of SALS.
Objective: To investigate the role of SMN gene copy number in the onset and
severity of SALS in Malians.
Material and Methods: We determined the SMN1 and SMN2 copy number in genomic DNA 
samples from 391 Malian adult volunteers, 120 Yoruba from Nigeria, 120 Luyha from
Kenya and 74 U.S. Caucasians using a Taqman quantitative PCR assay. We evaluated 
the SALS risk based on the estimated SMA protein level using the Veldink formula 
(SMN1 copy number + 0.2 ∗ SMN2 copy number). We also characterized the disease
natural history in 15 ALS patients at the teaching hospital of Point G, Bamako,
Mali.
Results: We found that 131 of 391 (33.5%) had an estimated SMN protein expression
of ≤ 2.2; 60 out of 391 (15.3%) had an estimated SMN protein expression < 2 and
would be at risk of ALS and the disease onset was as early as 16 years old. All
15 patients were male and some were physically handicapped within 1-2 years in
the disease course.
Conclusion: Because of the short survival time of our patients, family histories 
and sample DNA for testing were not done. However, our results show that sporadic
ALS is of earlier onset and shorter survival time as compared to patients
elsewhere. We plan to establish a network of neurologists and researchers for
early screening of ALS.
