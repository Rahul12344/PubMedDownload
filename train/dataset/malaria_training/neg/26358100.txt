Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) are a key threat for millions of people
worldwide, since they act as vectors for devastating pathogens and parasites. The
standard method of utilisation of morphological characters becomes challenging
due to various factors such as phenotypical variations. We explored the
complementary approach of CO1 gene-based identification, analysing ten species of
mosquito vectors belonging to three genera, Aedes, Culex and Anopheles from
India. Analysed nucleotide sequences were found without pseudo genes and indels; 
they match with high similarity in nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
(BLASTn) search. The partial CO1 sequence of Anopheles niligricus was the first
time record submitted to National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).
Mean intra- and interspecies divergence was found to be 1.30 and 3.83 %,
respectively. The congeneric divergence was three times higher than the
conspecifics. Deep intraspecific divergence was noted in three of the species,
and the reason could be explained more accurately in the future by improving the 
sample size across different locations. The transitional and transversional
substitutions were tested individually. Ts and Tv substitutions in all the 1st,
2nd and 3rd codons were estimated to be (0.44, 99.51), (40.35, 59.66) and (59.16,
40.84), respectively. Saturation of the sequences was resolved, since both the Ts
and Tv exhibited a linear relationship suggesting that the sequences were not
saturated. NJ and ML tree analysis showed that the individuals of the same
species clustered together based on the CO1 sequence similarity, regardless of
their collection site and geographic location. Overall, this study adds basic
knowledge to molecular evolution of mosquito vectors of medical and veterinary
importance and may be useful to improve biotechnological tools employed in
Culicidae control programmes.
