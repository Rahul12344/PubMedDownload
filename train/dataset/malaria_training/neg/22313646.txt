OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of real time polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of Malarial parasite.
STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive cross-sectional study.
PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP),
Rawalpindi, from April to June 2010.
METHODOLOGY: A total of 60 Leishman stained blood films with clinical suspicion
of malaria were studied by light microscopy for detection of malaria parasite
(MP). The samples were also subjected to real time PCR for the small subunit
(SSU) rRNA gene of MP found in all the four subspecies of Plasmodium. Real time
PCR was done by the Taqman probe method. One sample positive for MP was serially 
diluted with ABO compatible blood, and light microscopy and real time PCR were
performed on all dilutions. Results of light microscopy and real time PCR were
compared. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using PCR as the gold
standard.
RESULTS: PCR detected MP in 33 samples with sensitivity and specificity of 100%
whereas light microscopy could detect MP in 30 samples. Sensitivity and
specificity of light microscopy was 90.9% and 100% respectively. In the serially 
diluted blood sample, MP was visible at 1/16 dilution whereas the PCR showed
positive results even at 1/512 dilution.
CONCLUSION: Real time PCR is more sensitive than light microscopy for the
detection of malarial parasite.
