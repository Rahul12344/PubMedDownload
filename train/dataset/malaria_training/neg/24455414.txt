Background. In Cameroon, both Artesunate-amodiaquine (AS/AQ) and
artemether-lumefantrine (AL) are used as first-line treatment against
uncomplicated malaria in line with the WHO recommendations. We compared the
efficacy and safety of both therapeutic combinations and determined the
prevalence of drug resistance conferring mutations in three parasite genes.
Methods. One hundred and fifty acute malaria patients between six months and 14
years of age were randomized to receive standard doses of either AS/AQ (73) or AL
(77) and followedup for 28 days. Outcome of treatment was according to the
standard WHO classification. DNA samples from pretreatment parasite isolates were
used to determine the prevalence of resistant mutations in the pfcrt, pfmdr1, and
dhfr genes. Results. Both drug combinations induced rapid clearance of parasites 
and malaria symptoms. PCR-corrected cure rates were 100% and 96.4% for AL. The
combinations were well tolerated. Major haplotypes included CVIET (71%), CVMNT
(25%) for the pfcrt; SND (100%) for the pfmdr1; IRN (79, 8%), NCS (8.8%), and
mixed haplotype (11, 8%) for the dhfr. Conclusion. Both AS/AQ and AL were highly 
effective and well tolerated for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum
malaria in Ngaoundere, Cameroon. High prevalence of mutant pfcrt alleles confirms
earlier observations. Long-term monitoring of safety and efficacy and molecular
markers is highly solicited.
