Effect of choline kinase inhibitor hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide on
Plasmodium falciparum gene expression.

Razak MR, Abdullah NR, Chomel R, Muhamad R, Ismail Z.

Investigations on the fundamental of malaria parasite biology, such as invasion, 
growth cycle, metabolism and cell signalling have uncovered a number of potential
antimalarial drug targets, including choline kinase, a key enzyme involved in the
synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, an important component in parasite membrane
compartment. The effect on gene expression of Plasmodium falciparum K1 strain
following 72 hours exposure to 2 microM (IC50 concentration) of the choline
kinase inhibitor, hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTAB) was evaluated by DNA
microarray analysis. Genes important in P. falciparum intraerythrocytic life
cycle, such as invasion, cytoadherance and growth were among those affected by at
least 2-fold changes in their expression levels compared with non HDTAB-treated
control.
