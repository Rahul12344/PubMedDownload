Background: The emergence and spread of resistance in Plasmodium falciparum to
chloroquine (CQ) necessitated the change from CQ to artemisinin-based combination
therapies (ACTs) as first-line drug for the management of uncomplicated malaria
in Ghana in 2005. Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) which was the second line
antimalarial drug in Ghana, was now adopted for intermittent preventive treatment
of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp). Methods: To examine the prevalence of molecular
markers associated with CQ and antifolate drug resistance in Ghana, we employed
restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction to genotype
and compare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the P. falciparum
chloroquine resistance transporter ( pfcrt, PF3D7_0709000), multidrug resistance 
( pfmdr1, PF3D7_0523000), bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate
synthase ( pfdhfr, PF3D7_0417200) and dihydropteroate synthase ( pfdhps,
PF3D7_0810800) genes. Parasites were collected from children with malaria
reporting to hospitals in three different epidemiological areas of Ghana (Accra, 
Kintampo and Navrongo) in 2012-2013 and 2016-2017. Results: The overall
prevalence of the CQ resistance-associated pfcrt 76T allele was 8%, whereas
pfmdr1 86Y and 184F alleles were present in 10.2% and 65.1% of infections,
respectively. The majority of the isolates harboured the antifolate
resistance-associated pfdhfr alleles 51I (83.4%), 59R (85.9 %) and 108N (90.5%). 
Pfdhps 437G and 540E were detected in 90.6% and 0.7% of infections, respectively.
We observed no significant difference across the three study sites for all the
polymorphisms except for pfdhps 437G , which was more common in Accra compared to
Kintampo for the 2016-2017 isolates. Across both pfdhfr and pfdhps genes, a large
proportion (61%) of the isolates harboured the quadruple mutant combination ( I
51 R 59 N 108/ G 437). CQ resistance alleles decreased during the 12 years after 
CQ withdrawal, but an mediate SP resistance alleles increased. Conclusion:
Surveillance of the prevalence of resistance alleles is necessary in monitoring
the efficacy of antimalarial drugs.
