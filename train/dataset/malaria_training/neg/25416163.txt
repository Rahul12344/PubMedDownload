In recent years, there has been a substantial increase of imported Plasmodium
vivax incidence in Henan Province. As China is in a pre-elimination phase, the
surveillance of imported malaria is essential, but there is no good way to
distinguish imported cases from indigenous cases. This paper reports a case of a 
39-year-old man who acquired P. vivax while staying in Indonesia for one month in
2013, and relapsed in Henan, China in 2014. This was diagnosed as vivax malaria
based on rapid diagnostic test, Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smear and
Plasmodium species-specific nested PCR. The genetic sequence for the
circumsporozoite protein genes was analysed and the genetic variations were
compared with a previously constructed database of Chinese isolates. The results 
from the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) gene sequence analysis centered on the
repeat patterns showed that the imported cases had completely different sequences
from any subtypes from Chinese isolates, but well matched with the countries
travelled by the patient. The imported vivax cases were able to clearly
distinguish from the indigenous vivax cases by detecting the CSP gene and were
able to confim its origin by genotyping.
