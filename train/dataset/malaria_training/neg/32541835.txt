Malaria is one of the deadliest infectious diseases in the world. Immune
responses to Plasmodium falciparum malaria vary among individuals and between
populations. Human genetic variation in immune system genes is likely to play a
role in this heterogeneity. Natural killer (NK) cells produce inflammatory
cytokines in response to malaria infection, kill intraerythrocytic Plasmodium
falciparum parasites by cytolysis, and participate in the initiation and
development of adaptive immune responses to plasmodial infection. These functions
are modulated by interactions between killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors
(KIRs) and human leukocyte antigens (HLAs). Therefore, variations in KIR and HLA 
genes can have a direct impact on NK cell functions. Understanding the role of
KIRs and HLAs in immunity to malaria can help to better characterize antimalarial
immune responses. In this review, we summarize the different KIRs and HLAs
associated with immunity to malaria thus far.
