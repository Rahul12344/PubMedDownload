Anopheles gambiae are a major vector of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. Viruses
that naturally infect these mosquitoes may impact their physiology and ability to
transmit pathogens. We therefore used metagenomics sequencing to search for
viruses in adult Anopheles mosquitoes collected from Liberia, Senegal, and
Burkina Faso. We identified a number of virus and virus-like sequences from
mosquito midgut contents, including 14 coding-complete genome segments and 26
partial sequences. The coding-complete sequences define new viruses in the order 
Mononegavirales, and the families Flaviviridae, and Totiviridae. The
identification of a flavivirus infecting Anopheles mosquitoes broadens our
understanding of the evolution and host range of this virus family. This study
increases our understanding of virus diversity in general, begins to define the
virome of a medically important vector in its natural setting, and lays
groundwork for future studies examining the potential impact of these viruses on 
anopheles biology and disease transmission.
