BACKGROUND: Motivated by the success in malaria control that was documented over 
the last decade Ethiopia is aiming at malaria elimination by 2020 in selected
districts. It is currently unknown if asymptomatic, submicroscopic malaria
parasite carriage may form a hurdle to achieve elimination. The elimination
effort may further be complicated by possible glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD) deficiency which would hinder the use of 8-aminoquinolines in the
elimination efforts.
METHOD: In February 2014 a community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted
in Malo, southwest Ethiopia. Finger-prick blood samples (n = 555) were tested for
presence of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax with microscopy, rapid
diagnostic test (RDT), and nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR). Multiplicity 
of P. falciparum infections was determined based on genotyping the polymorphic
merozoite surface protein-2 (MSP-2) gene. Individuals were also genotyped for
mutations in the gene that produces G6PD.
RESULTS: All study participants were malaria infection negative by microscopy and
RDT. Nested PCR revealed P. falciparum mono-infection in 5.2% (29/555), P. vivax 
mono-infection in 4.3% (24/555) and mixed infection in 0.2% (1/555) of
individuals. All parasitemic individuals were afebrile (axillary temperature
<37.5Â°C). None of the study participants carried mutations for the G6PD African
A-(202GA) and Mediterranean (563CT) variants. All infections, except one, were
single-clone infection by MSP-2 genotyping.
CONCLUSION: The detection of a substantial number of subpatent malaria infections
in an apparently asymptomatic population without evidence for malaria
transmission by conventional diagnostics raises questions about the path to
malaria elimination. It is currently unknown how important these infections are
for sustaining malaria transmission in the study sites. The absence of G6PD
deficiency indicates that 8-aminoquinolines may be safely deployed to accelerate 
elimination initiatives.
