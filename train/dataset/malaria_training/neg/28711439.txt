BACKGROUND: In the fight against malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum, the
successes achieved by artemisinin were endangered by resistance of the parasites 
to the drug. Whole genome sequencing approach on artemisinin resistant parasite
line discovered k13 gene associated with drug resistance. In vitro and in vivo
studies indicated mutations in the k13 gene were linked to the artemisinin
resistance.
METHODOLOGY: The literatures published after April, 2015 up to December, 2016 on 
k13 mutant alleles for artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum and
relevant literatures were comprehensively reviewed.
RESULTS: To date, 13 non-synonymous mutations of k13 gene have been observed to
have slow parasite clearance. Worldwide mapping of k13 mutant alleles have shown 
mutants associated with artemisinin resistance were confined to southeast Asia
and China and did not invade to African countries. Although in vitro ring stage
survival assay of 0-3 h was a recently developed assay, it was useful for rapid
detection of artemisinin resistance associated k13 allelic marker in the
parasite. Recently, dissemination of k13 mutant alleles was recommended to be
investigated by identity of haplotypes. Significant characteristics of well
described alleles in the reports were mentioned in this review for the benefit of
future studies.
CONCLUSION: According to the updates in the review, it can be concluded
artemisinin resistance does not disseminate to India and African countries within
short period whereas regular tracking of these mutants is necessary.
