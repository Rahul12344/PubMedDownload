BACKGROUND: Malaria parasites that infect birds can have narrow or broad
host-tropisms. These differences in host specificity make avian malaria a useful 
model for studying the evolution and transmission of parasite assemblages across 
geographic ranges. The molecular mechanisms involved in host-specificity and the 
biology of avian malaria parasites in general are important aspects of malaria
pathogenesis that warrant further examination. Here, the transcriptome of the
malaria parasite Plasmodium gallinaceum was characterized to investigate the
biology and the conservation of genes across various malaria parasite species.
METHODS: The P. gallinaceum transcriptome was annotated and KEGG pathway mapping 
was performed. The ripr gene and orthologous genes that play critical roles in
the purine salvage pathway were identified and characterized using bioinformatics
and phylogenetic methods.
RESULTS: Analysis of the transcriptome sequence database identified essential
genes of the purine salvage pathway in P. gallinaceum that shared high sequence
similarity to Plasmodium falciparum when compared to other mammalian Plasmodium
spp. However, based on the current sequence data, there was a lack of orthologous
genes that belonged to the erythrocyte-binding-like (EBL) and
reticulocyte-binding-like homologue (RH) family in P. gallinaceum. In addition,
an orthologue of the Rh5 interacting protein (ripr) was identified.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the pathways involved in parasite red
blood cell invasion are significantly different in avian Plasmodium parasites,
but critical metabolic pathways are conserved throughout divergent Plasmodium
taxa.
