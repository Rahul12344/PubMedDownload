Signaling pathways controlled by reversible protein phosphorylation (catalyzed by
kinases and phosphatases) in the malaria parasite Plasmodium are of great
interest, for both increased understanding of parasite biology and identification
of novel drug targets. Here, we report a functional analysis in Plasmodium of an 
ancient bacterial Shewanella-like protein phosphatase (SHLP1) found only in
bacteria, fungi, protists, and plants. SHLP1 is abundant in asexual blood stages 
and expressed at all stages of the parasite life cycle. shlp1 deletion results in
a reduction in ookinete (zygote) development, microneme formation, and complete
ablation of oocyst formation, thereby blocking parasite transmission. This defect
is carried by the female gamete and can be rescued by direct injection of mutant 
ookinetes into the mosquito hemocoel, where oocysts develop. This study
emphasizes the varied functions of SHLP1 in Plasmodium ookinete biology and
suggests that it could be a novel drug target for blocking parasite transmission.
