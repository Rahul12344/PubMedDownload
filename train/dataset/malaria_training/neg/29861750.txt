The study aims to determine the association of malaria infection with ABO blood
groups and genotype and also to detect point mutations at positions 86, 184,
1034, and 1042 of the Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance gene (pfmdr1) in
blood samples collected from pregnant women attending General Hospital Minna. Out
of 250 pregnant women screened, 39 (15.60%) had malaria infection. Prevalence was
higher in women, during the third trimester (46.15%), genotype AA (64.10%), and O
blood group (53.84%) individuals when compared with others. There was significant
(p < 0.05) decrease in Packed Cell Volume (PCV), hemoglobin (HGB), Red Blood
Cells (RBC), and platelet (PLC) count in infected group when compared with
noninfected group. Although, two of the isolates showed disrupted protein
sequence at codon 1034-1042, no mutation was found in any of the P. falciparum
isolates. Structural prediction of chemical ligand led to the identification of
Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-3/β1-4Glc/GlcNAc. This compound can theoretically bind and change
the functional integrity of the pfmdr1 protein, thus providing a new window for
malaria drug target.
