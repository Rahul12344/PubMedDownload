Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite. Of the
four Plasmodium species that routinely cause human malaria, Plasmodium vivax is
the most widespread species outside Africa, causing ∼18.9 million cases in 2012. 
P. vivax cannot be cultured continuously in vitro, which severely hampers
research in nonendemic and endemic countries alike. Consequently, whole-genome
sequencing has become an effective means to interrogate the biology of the P.
vivax parasite. Our comparative genomic analysis of five P. vivax reference
genomes and several whole-genome sequences of the closely related monkey malaria 
species P. cynomolgi has revealed an extraordinary level of genetic diversity and
enabled characterization of novel multigene families and important single-copy
genes. The generation of whole-genome sequences from multiple clinical isolates
is also driving forward knowledge concerning the biology and evolution of the
species. Understanding the biology of P. vivax is crucial to develop potential
antimalarial drugs and vaccines and to achieve the goal of eliminating malaria.
