Dendritic cells (DCs) are activated by pathogens to initiate and shape immune
responses. We found that the activation of DCs by Plasmodium falciparum, the main
causative agent of human malaria, induces a highly unusual phenotype by which DCs
up-regulate costimulatory molecules and secretion of chemokines, but not of
cytokines typical of inflammatory responses (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF). Similar
results were obtained with DCs obtained from malaria-naïve US donors and
malaria-experienced donors from Mali. Contact-dependent cross-talk between the
main DC subsets, plasmacytoid and myeloid DCs (mDCs) was necessary for increased 
chemokine and IFN-α secretion in response to the parasite. Despite the absence of
inflammatory cytokine secretion, mDCs incubated with P. falciparum-infected
erythrocytes activated antigen-specific naïve CD4+ T cells to proliferate and
secrete Th1-like cytokines. This unexpected response of human mDCs to P.
falciparum exhibited a transcriptional program distinct from a classical LPS
response, pointing to unique P. falciparum-induced activation pathways that may
explain the uncharacteristic immune response to malaria.
