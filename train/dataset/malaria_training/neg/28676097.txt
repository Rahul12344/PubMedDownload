BACKGROUND: The genetic diversity of malaria parasites reflects the complexity
and size of the parasite populations. This study was designed to explore the
genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum populations collected from two
southeastern areas (Shwekyin and Myawaddy bordering Thailand) and one western
area (Kyauktaw bordering Bangladesh) of Myanmar.
METHODS: A total of 267 blood samples collected from patients with acute P.
falciparum infections during 2009 and 2010 were used for genotyping at the
merozoite surface protein 1 (Msp1), Msp2 and glutamate-rich protein (Glurp) loci.
RESULTS: One hundred and eighty four samples were successfully genotyped at three
genes. The allelic distributions of the three genes were all significantly
different among three areas. MAD20 and 3D7 were the most prevalent alleles in
three areas for Msp1 and Msp2, respectively. The Glurp allele with a bin size of 
700-750 bp was the most prevalent both in Shwekyin and Myawaddy, whereas two
alleles with bin sizes of 800-850 bp and 900-1000 bp were the most prevalent in
the western site Kyauktaw. Overall, 73.91% of samples contained multiclonal
infections, resulting in a mean multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.94.
Interestingly, the MOI level presented a rising trend with the order of Myawaddy,
Kyauktaw and Shwekyin, which also paralleled with the increasing frequencies of
Msp1 RO33 and Msp2 FC27 200-250 bp alleles. Msp1 and Msp2 genes displayed higher 
levels of diversity and higher MOI rates than Glurp. PCR revealed four samples
(two from Shwekyin and two from Myawaddy) with mixed infections of P. falciparum 
and P. vivax.
CONCLUSIONS: This study genotyped parasite clinical samples from two southeast
regions and one western state of Myanmar at the Msp1, Msp2 and Glurp loci, which 
revealed high levels of genetic diversity and mixed-strain infections of P.
falciparum populations at these sites. The results indicated that malaria
transmission intensity in these regions remained high and more strengthened
control efforts are needed. The genotypic data provided baseline information for 
monitoring the impacts of malaria elimination efforts in the region.
