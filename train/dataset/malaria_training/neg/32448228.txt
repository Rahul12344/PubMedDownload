BACKGROUND: Prevention and treatment of malaria during pregnancy is crucial in
dealing with maternal mortality and adverse fetal outcomes. The World Health
Organization recommendation to treat all pregnant women with
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) through antenatal care structures was implemented 
in Kenya in the year 1998, but concerns about its effectiveness in preventing
malaria in pregnancy has arisen due to the spread of SP resistant parasites. This
study aimed to determine the prevalence of SP resistance markers in Plasmodium
falciparum parasites isolated from pregnant women seeking antenatal care at
Msambweni County Referral Hospital, located in coastal Kenya, between the year
2013 and 2015.
METHODS: This hospital-based study included 106 malaria positive whole blood
samples for analysis of SP resistance markers within the Pfdhfr gene (codons 51, 
59 and 108) and Pfdhps gene (codons 437 and 540). The venous blood collected from
all pregnant women was tested for malaria via light microscopy, then the malaria 
positive samples were separated into plasma and red cells and stored in a - 86°
freezer for further studies. Archived red blood cells were processed for
molecular characterization of SP resistance markers within the Pfdhfr and Pfdhps 
genes using real time PCR platform and Sanger sequencing.
RESULTS: All samples had at least one mutation in the genes associated with drug 
resistance; polymorphism prevalence of Pfdhfr51I, 59R and 108N was at 88.7%,
78.3% and 93.4%, respectively, while Pfdhps polymorphism accounted for 94.3% and 
91.5% at 437G and 540E, respectively. Quintuple mutations (at all the five
codons) conferring total SP resistance had the highest prevalence of 85.8%.
Quadruple mutations were observed at a frequency of 10.4%, and 24.5% had a mixed 
outcome of both wildtype and mutant genotypes in the genes of interest.
CONCLUSION: The data suggest a high prevalence of P. falciparum genetic
variations conferring resistance to SP among pregnant women, which may explain
reduced efficacy of IPTp treatment in Kenya. There is need for extensive SP
resistance profiling in Kenya to inform IPTp drug choices for successful malaria 
prevention during pregnancy.
