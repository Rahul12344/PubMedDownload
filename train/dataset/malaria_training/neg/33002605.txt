Haemosporida are diverse vector-borne parasites associated with terrestrial
vertebrates. Driven by the interest in species causing malaria (genus
Plasmodium), the diversity of avian and mammalian haemosporidian species has been
extensively studied, relying mostly on mitochondrial genes, particularly
cytochrome b. However, parasites from reptiles have been neglected in
biodiversity surveys. Reptilian haemosporidian parasites include Haemocystidium, 
a genus that shares morphological features with Plasmodium and Haemoproteus.
Here, the first complete Haemocystidium mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes are
studied. In particular, three mtDNA genomes from Haemocystidium spp. sampled in
Africa, Oceania, and South America, are described. The Haemocystidium mtDNA
genomes showed a high A + T content and a gene organization, including an extreme
fragmentation of the rRNAs, found in other Haemosporida. These Haemocystidium
mtDNA genomes were incorporated in phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses
together with a representative sample of haemosporidian parasites from birds,
mammals, and reptiles. The recovered phylogeny supported Haemocystidium as a
monophyletic group apart from Plasmodium and other Haemosporida. Both the
phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses yielded results consistent with a
scenario in which haemosporidian parasites radiated with modern birds.
Haemocystidium, like mammalian parasite clades, seems to originate from host
switches by avian Haemosporida that allowed for the colonization of new
vertebrate hosts. This hypothesis can be tested by investigating additional
parasite species from all vertebrate hosts, particularly from reptiles. The mtDNA
genomes reported here provide baseline data that can be used to scale up studies 
in haemosporidian parasites of reptiles using barcode approaches.
