The terrestrial actinomycete strain BCC71188 was identified as Streptomyces by
its morphology (having spiral chain spore on the aerial mycelium), chemotaxonomy 
(containing LL-diaminopimelic acid in the cell wall), and 16S rRNA gene sequence 
analysis [showing high similarity values compared with Streptomyces samsunensis
M1463T (99.85 %) and Streptomyces malaysiensis NBRC 16446T (99.40 %)]. The crude 
extract exhibited antimalarial against Plasmodium falciparum (IC50 0.19 μg/ml),
anti-TB against Mycobacterial tuberculosis (MIC 6.25 μg/ml), and antibacterial
against Bacillus cereus (MIC 1.56 μg/ml) activities. Therefore, chemical
investigation was conducted by employing bioassay-guided method and led to the
isolation of 19 compounds including two cyclic peptides (1-2), five macrolides
(3-7), new naphthoquinone (8), nahuoic acid C (9), geldanamycin derivatives
(10-13), cyclooctatin (14), germicidins A (15) and C (16), actinoramide A (17),
abierixin, and 29-O-methylabierixin. These isolated compounds were evaluated for 
antimicrobial activity, such as antimalarial, anti-TB, and antibacterial
activities, and for cytotoxicity against both cancerous (MCF-7, KB, NCI-H187) and
non-cancerous (Vero) cells. Compounds 1-7, 10-14 exhibited antimalarial (IC50
0.22-7.14 μg/ml), and elaiophylin analogs (4-6) displayed anti-TB (MIC
0.78-12.00 μg/ml) and B. cereus (MIC 0.78-3.13 μg/ml) activities. Compounds 1, 2,
14, and abierixin displayed weak cytotoxicity, indicating a potential for
antimicrobial agents.
