BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax 48/45 protein is expressed on the surface of
gametocytes/gametes and plays a key role in gamete fusion during fertilization.
This protein was recently expressed in Escherichia coli host as a recombinant
product that was highly immunogenic in mice and monkeys and induced antibodies
with high transmission-blocking activity, suggesting its potential as a P. vivax 
transmission-blocking vaccine candidate. To determine sequence polymorphism of
natural parasite isolates and its potential influence on the protein structure,
all pvs48/45 sequences reported in databases from around the world as well as
those from low-transmission settings of Latin America were compared.
METHODS: Plasmodium vivax parasite isolates from malaria-endemic regions of
Colombia, Brazil and Honduras (n = 60) were used to sequence the Pvs48/45 gene,
and compared to those previously reported to GenBank and PlasmoDB (n = 222).
Pvs48/45 gene haplotypes were analysed to determine the functional significance
of genetic variation in protein structure and vaccine potential.
RESULTS: Nine non-synonymous substitutions (E35K, Y196H, H211N, K250N, D335Y,
E353Q, A376T, K390T, K418R) and three synonymous substitutions (I73, T149, C156) 
that define seven different haplotypes were found among the 282 isolates from
nine countries when compared with the Sal I reference sequence. Nucleotide
diversity (π) was 0.00173 for worldwide samples (range 0.00033-0.00216),
resulting in relatively high diversity in Myanmar and Colombia, and low diversity
in Mexico, Peru and South Korea. The two most frequent substitutions (E353Q:
41.9 %, K250N: 39.5 %) were predicted to be located in antigenic regions without 
affecting putative B cell epitopes or the tertiary protein structure.
CONCLUSIONS: There is limited sequence polymorphism in pvs48/45 with noted
geographical clustering among Asian and American isolates. The low genetic
diversity of the protein does not influence the predicted antigenicity or protein
structure and, therefore, supports its further development as
transmission-blocking vaccine candidate.
