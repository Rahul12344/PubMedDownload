BACKGROUND: Plasmodium ovale is comprised of two genetically distinct subspecies,
P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri. Although P. ovale subspecies are similar
based on morphology and geographical distribution, allelic differences indicate
that P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri are genetically divergent.
Additionally, potential clinical and latency duration differences between P.
ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri demonstrate the need for investigation into 
the contribution of this neglected malaria parasite to the global malaria burden.
METHODS: In order to detect all P. ovale subspecies simultaneously, we developed 
an inclusive P. ovale-specific real-time PCR assay based on conserved regions
between P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri in the reticulocyte binding
protein 2 (rbp2) gene. Additionally, we characterized the P. ovale subspecies
prevalence from 22 asymptomatic malaria infections using multilocus genotyping to
discriminate P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri.
RESULTS: Our P. ovale rbp2 qPCR assay validation experiments demonstrated a
linear dynamic range from 6.25 rbp2 plasmid copies/microliter to 100,000 rbp2
plasmid copies/microliter and a limit of detection of 1.5 rbp2 plasmid
copies/microliter. Specificity experiments showed the ability of the rbp2 qPCR
assay to detect low-levels of P. ovale in the presence of additional malaria
parasite species, including P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. malariae. We
identified P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri in Western Kenya by DNA
sequencing of the tryptophan-rich antigen gene, the small subunit ribosomal RNA
gene, and the rbp2 gene.
CONCLUSIONS: Our novel P. ovale rbp2 qPCR assay detects P. ovale curtisi and P.
ovale wallikeri simultaneously and can be utilized to characterize the
prevalence, distribution, and burden of P. ovale in malaria endemic regions.
Using multilocus genotyping, we also provided the first description of the
prevalence of P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri in Western Kenya, a region 
holoendemic for malaria transmission.
