BACKGROUND: Ocular toxicity was described in the late 1950s for some
anti-malarial drugs, but only limited information is available on the comparison 
of ocular toxicity of different anti-malarials.
METHODS: We conducted a follow-up study with a nested case-control analysis using
the General Practice Research Database to compare the risk of developing a
first-time diagnosis of an eye disorder during exposure of mefloquine,
chloroquine and/or proguanil or atovaquone/proguanil use to non-users. We
calculated incidence rates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and odds ratios
using multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: We included 83,148 patients and identified 652 cases with an incident
eye disorder. The incidence rates with 95% CI of all eye disorders combined in
users of mefloquine, chloroquine and/or proguanil, atovaquone/proguanil or
travellers not using anti-malarials were 5.3 (4.3-6.5), 7.1 (5.0-9.9), 6.3
(5.6-7.2) and 5.1 (4.6-5.7), per 1000 person-years, respectively. As compared to 
non-users of anti-malarials, the adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI in the nested
case-control analysis for users of mefloquine, chloroquine and/or proguanil, or
atovaquone/proguanil were 1.33 (1.01-1.75), 1.61 (1.06-2.45), and 1.25
(1.03-1.52), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence that there was an increased risk of eye 
disorders in users of all anti-malarials compared to non-users of anti-malarials.
