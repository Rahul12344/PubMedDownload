Compared with other eukaryotic cell types, malaria parasites appear to possess a 
more rudimentary Golgi apparatus being composed of dispersed, unstacked cis and
trans-cisternae. Despite playing a central role in the secretory pathway of the
parasite, few Plasmodium Golgi resident proteins have been characterised. We had 
previously identified a new Golgi resident protein of unknown function, which we 
had named Golgi Protein 1, and now show that it forms a complex with a previously
uncharacterised transmembrane protein (Golgi Protein 2, GP2). The Golgi Protein
complex localises to the cis-Golgi throughout the erythrocytic cycle and
potentially also during the mosquito stages. Analysis of parasite strains where
GP1 expression is conditionally repressed and/or the GP2 gene is inactivated
reveals that though the Golgi protein complex is not essential at any stage of
the parasite life cycle, it is important for optimal asexual development in the
blood stages.
