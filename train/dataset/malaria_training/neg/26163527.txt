Mosquito salivary glands are well known to facilitate meal acquisition, however
the fundamental question on how adult female salivary gland manages molecular
responses during sugar versus blood meal uptake remains unanswered. To
investigate these responses, we analyzed a total of 58.5 million raw reads
generated from two independent RNAseq libraries of the salivary glands collected 
from 3-4 day-old sugar and blood fed Anopheles culicifacies mosquitoes.
Comprehensive functional annotation analysis of 10,931 contigs unraveled that
salivary glands may encode diverse nature of proteins in response to distinct
physiological feeding status. Digital gene expression analysis and PCR validation
indicated that first blood meal significantly alters the molecular architecture
of the salivary glands. Comparative microscopic analysis also revealed that first
blood meal uptake not only causes an alteration of at least 12-22% of
morphological features of the salivary glands but also results in cellular
changes e.g. apoptosis, confirming together that adult female salivary glands are
specialized organs to manage meal specific responses. Unraveling the underlying
mechanism of mosquito salivary gene expression, controlling dual feeding
associated responses may provide a new opportunity to control vector borne
diseases.
