BACKGROUND: Haemosporidians (Apicomplexa, Protista) are obligate heteroxenous
parasites of vertebrates and blood-sucking dipteran insects. Avian
haemosporidians comprise more than 250 species traditionally classified into four
genera, Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon, and Fallisia. However, analyses 
of the mitochondrial CytB gene revealed a vast variety of lineages not yet linked
to morphospecies. This study aimed to analyse and discuss the data of
haemosporidian lineages isolated from birds of the family Turdidae, to visualise 
host and geographic distribution using DNA haplotype networks and to suggest
directions for taxonomy research on parasite species.
METHODS: Haemosporidian CytB sequence data from 350 thrushes were analysed for
the present study and complemented with CytB data of avian haemosporidians
gathered from Genbank and MalAvi database. Maximum Likelihood trees were
calculated to identify clades featuring lineages isolated from Turdidae species. 
For each clade, DNA haplotype networks were calculated and provided with
information on host and geographic distribution.
RESULTS: In species of the Turdidae, this study identified 82 Plasmodium, 37
Haemoproteus, and 119 Leucocytozoon lineages, 68, 28, and 112 of which are mainly
found in this host group. Most of these lineages cluster in the clades, which are
shown as DNA haplotype networks. The lineages of the Leucocytozoon clades were
almost exclusively isolated from thrushes and usually were restricted to one host
genus, whereas the Plasmodium and Haemoproteus networks featured multiple
lineages also recovered from other passeriform and non-passeriform birds.
CONCLUSION: This study represents the first attempt to summarise information on
the haemosporidian parasite lineages of a whole bird family. The analyses allowed
the identification of numerous groups of related lineages, which have not been
linked to morphologically defined species yet, and they revealed several cases in
which CytB lineages were probably assigned to the wrong morphospecies. These
taxonomic issues are addressed by comparing distributional patterns of the CytB
lineages with data from the original species descriptions and further literature.
The authors also discuss the availability of sequence data and emphasise that
MalAvi database should be considered an extremely valuable addition to GenBank,
but not a replacement.
