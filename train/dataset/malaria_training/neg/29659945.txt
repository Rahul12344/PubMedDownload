Background: Falcipain-2a ([FP2a] PF3D7_1115700) is a Plasmodium falciparum
cysteine protease and hemoglobinase. Functional FP2a is required for potent
activity of artemisinin, and in vitro selection for artemisinin resistance
selected for an FP2a nonsense mutation.
Methods: To investigate associations between FP2a polymorphisms and artemisinin
resistance and to characterize the diversity of the enzyme in parasites from the 
China-Myanmar border, we sequenced the full-length FP2a gene in 140 P falciparum 
isolates collected during 2004-2011.
Results: The isolates were grouped into 8 different haplotype groups. Haplotype
group I appeared in samples obtained after 2008, coinciding with implementation
of artemisinin-based combination therapy in this region. In functional studies,
compared with wild-type parasites, the FP2a haplotypes demonstrated increased
ring survival, and all haplotype groups exhibited significantly reduced FP2a
activity, with group I showing the slowest protease kinetics and reduced parasite
fitness.
Conclusions: These results suggest that altered hemoglobin digestion due to FP2a 
mutations may contribute to artemisinin resistance.
