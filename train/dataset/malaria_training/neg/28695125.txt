Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a severe disease in humans caused by human
immunodeficiency virus. Several human genes were characterized as host genetic
factors that impact the processes of AIDS disease. Recent studies on AIDS
patients revealed a series disease is complicating with AIDS. To resolve gene
interaction between AIDS and complicating diseases, a canonical correlation
analysis was used to identify the global correlation between AIDS and other
disease pathway genes expression. The results showed that HLA-B, HLA-A, MH9,
ZNED1, IRF1, TLR8, TSG101, NCOR2, and GML are the key AIDS-restricted genes
highly correlated with other disease pathway genes. Furthermore, pathway genes in
several diseases such as asthma, autoimmune thyroid disease, and malaria were
globally correlated with ARGs. It suggests that these diseases are a high risk in
AIDS patients as complicating diseases.
