BACKGROUND: Duffy blood group antigens serve as receptors for Plasmodium vivax
invasion into erythrocytes, and they are determined by polymorphisms of the Duffy
antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC), also known as Fy glycoprotein (FY). Duffy
negativity, i.e., absence of the antigens, protects against P. vivax infection
and is rare among non-African populations. However, data on DARC polymorphisms
and their impact on Plasmodium infection in India are scarce.
METHODS: In a case-control study among 909 malaria patients and 909 healthy
community controls in Mangaluru, southwestern India, DARC polymorphisms T-33C
(rs2814778), G125A (rs12075), C265T (rs34599082), and G298A (rs13962) were
genotyped. Associations of the polymorphisms with the odds of malaria, parasite
species and manifestation were assessed.
RESULTS: Among patients, vivax malaria (70%) predominated over falciparum malaria
(9%) and mixed species infections (21%). DARC T-33C was absent and C265T was rare
(1%). FYB carriage (deduced from DARC G125A) was not associated with the risk of 
malaria per se but it protected against severe falciparum malaria (P = 0.03), and
hospitalization (P = 0.006) due to falciparum malaria. Vice versa, carriage of
DARC 298A was associated with increased odds of malaria (aOR, 1.46 (1.07-1.99),
P = 0.015) and vivax malaria (aOR, 1.60 (1.14-2.22), P = 0.006) and with several 
reported symptoms and findings of the patients.
CONCLUSION: This report from southern India is the first to show an independent
effect of the DARC 298A polymorphism on the risk of malaria. Functional studies
are required to understand the underlying mechanism. Moreover, FYB carriage
appears to protect against severe falciparum malaria in southern India.
