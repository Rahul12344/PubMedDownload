BACKGROUND: In insects, including Anopheles mosquitoes, Dscam (Down syndrome cell
adhesion molecule) appears to be involved in phagocytosis of pathogens, and shows
pathogen-specific splice-form expression between divergent pathogen (or parasite)
types (e.g. between bacteria and Plasmodium or between Plasmodium berghei and
Plasmodium falciparum). Here, data are presented from the first study of Dscam
expression in response to genetic diversity within a parasite species.
METHODS: In independent field and laboratory studies, a measure of Dscam
splice-form diversity was compared between mosquitoes fed on blood that was free 
of P. falciparum to mosquitoes exposed to either single or mixed genotype
infections of P. falciparum.
RESULTS: Significant increases in Anopheles gambiae Dscam (AgDscam) receptor
diversity were observed in parasite-exposed mosquitoes, but only weak evidence
that AgDscam diversity rises further upon exposure to mixed genotype parasite
infections was found. Finally, a cluster of AgDscam exon 4 variants that become
especially common during Plasmodium invasion was identified.
CONCLUSIONS: While the data clearly indicate that AgDscam diversity increases
with P. falciparum exposure, they do not suggest that AgDscam diversity rises
further in response to increased parasite diversity.
