Little is known about transcription factor regulation during the Plasmodium
falciparum intraerythrocytic cycle. In order to elucidate the role of the P.
falciparum (Pf)NF-YB transcription factor we searched for target genes in the
entire genome. PfNF-YB mRNA is highly expressed in late trophozoite and schizont 
stages relative to the ring stage. In order to determine the candidate genes
bound by PfNF-YB a ChIP-on-chip assay was carried out and 297 genes were
identified. Ninety nine percent of PfNF-YB binding was to putative promoter
regions of protein coding genes of which only 16% comprise proteins of known
function. Interestingly, our data reveal that PfNF-YB binding is not exclusively 
to a canonical CCAAT box motif. PfNF-YB binds to genes coding for proteins
implicated in a range of different biological functions, such as replication
protein A large subunit (DNA replication), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase
(nucleic acid metabolism) and multidrug resistance protein 2 (intracellular
transport).
