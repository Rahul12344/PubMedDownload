Cerebral malaria is still a deleterious health problem in tropical countries. The
wide spread of malarial drug resistance and the lack of an effective vaccine are 
obstacles for disease management and prevention. Parasite and human genetic
factors play important roles in malaria susceptibility and disease severity. The 
malaria parasite exerted a potent selective signature on the human genome, which 
is apparent in the genetic polymorphism landscape of genes related to
pathogenesis. Currently, much genomic data and a novel body of knowledge,
including the identification of microRNAs, are being increasingly accumulated for
the development of laboratory testing cassettes for cerebral malaria prevention. 
Therefore, understanding of the underlying complex molecular basis of cerebral
malaria is important for the design of strategy for cerebral malaria treatment
and control.
