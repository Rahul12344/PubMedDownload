BACKGROUND: Toxoplasmosis is a widespread zoonotic parasitic disease that occurs 
in both animals and humans. Traditional molecular assays are often difficult to
perform, especially for the early diagnosis of Toxoplasma gondii infections.
Here, we established a novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification targeting the
529 bp repeat element (529 bp-LAMP) to detect T. gondii DNA in blood samples of
experimental mice infected with tachyzoites of the RH strain.
FINDINGS: The assay was performed with Bst DNA polymerase at 65Â°C for 1 h. The
detection limit of the 529 bp-LAMP assay was as low as 0.6 fg of T. gondii DNA.
The sensitivity of this assay was 100 and 1000 fold higher than that of the LAMP 
targeting B1 gene (B1-LAMP) and nested PCR targeting 529 bp repeat element (529
bp-nested PCR), respectively. The specificity of the 529 bp-LAMP assay was
determined using the DNA samples of Trypanosoma evansi, Plasmodium falciparum,
Paragonimus westermani, Schistosoma japonicum, Fasciola hepatica and
Angiostrongylus cantonensis. No cross-reactivity with the DNA of any parasites
was found. The assay was able to detect T. gondii DNA in all mouse blood samples 
at one day post infection (dpi).
CONCLUSIONS: We report the following findings: (i) The detection limit of the 529
bp-LAMP assay is 0.6 fg of T. gondii DNA; (ii) The assay does not involve any
cross-reactivity with the DNA of other parasites; (iii) This is the first report 
on the application of the LAMP assay for early diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in
blood samples from experimentally infected mice. Due to its simplicity,
sensitivity and cost-effectiveness for common use, we suggest that this assay
should be used as an early diagnostic tool for health control of toxoplasmosis.
