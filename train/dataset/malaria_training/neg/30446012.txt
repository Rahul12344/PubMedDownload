BACKGROUND: Plasmodium merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) is released into the
bloodstream during merozoite invasion, and thus represents a crucial malarial
vaccine target. Although substantial research effort has been devoted to
uncovering the genetic diversity of MSP-1 for P. falciparum and P. vivax, there
is minimal information available regarding the genetic profiles and structure of 
P. ovale. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the extent of 
genetic variation among two subspecies of P. ovale by characterizing the MSP-1
N-terminal sequence at the nucleotide and protein levels.
METHODS: N-terminal of MSP-1 gene were amplified from 126 clinical samples
collected from imported cases of malaria in migrant workers returning to Jiangsu 
Province from Africa using a conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. 
The PCR products were then sequenced and analyzed using the GeneDoc, MegAlign,
MEGA7 and DnaSP v.6 programs.
RESULTS: The average pairwise nucleotide diversities (Ï€) of P. ovale curtisi and 
P. ovale wallikeri MSP-1 genes (pomsp1) were 0.01043 and 0.01974, respectively,
and the haplotype diversity (Hd) were 0.746 and 0.598, respectively. Most of the 
nucleotide substitutions detected were non-synonymous, indicating that the
genetic variations of pomsp1 were maintained by positive diversifying selection, 
thereby suggesting their role as a potential target of a protective immune
response. Amino acid substitutions of P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri
MSP-1 could be categorized into five and three unique amino acid variants,
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Low mutational diversity was observed in pomsp1 from the Jiangsu
Province imported malaria cases; further studies will be developed such as
immunogenicity and functional analysis.
