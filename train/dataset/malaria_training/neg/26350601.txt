Microorganisms like the halophilic archaeon Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 produce
gas-filled buoyant organelles, which are easily purified as protein nanoparticles
(called gas vesicles or GVNPs). GVNPs are non-toxic, exceptionally stable,
bioengineerable, and self-adjuvanting. A large gene cluster encoding more than a 
dozen proteins has been implicated in their biogenesis. One protein, GvpC, found 
on the exterior surface of the nanoparticles, can accommodate insertions near the
C-terminal region and results in GVNPs displaying the inserted sequences on the
surface of the nanoparticles. Here, we review the current state of knowledge on
GVNP structure and biogenesis as well as available studies on immunogenicity of
pathogenic viral, bacterial, and eukaryotic proteins and peptides displayed on
the nanoparticles. Recent improvements in genetic tools for bioengineering of
GVNPs are discussed, along with future opportunities and challenges for
development of vaccines and other applications.
