Plasmodium infection in Anopheles is influenced by mosquito-derived factors. We
previously showed that a protein in saliva from infected Anopheles, mosquito
gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (mosGILT), inhibits the
ability of sporozoites to traverse cells and readily establish infection of the
vertebrate host. To determine whether mosGILT influences Plasmodium within the
mosquito, we generated Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes carrying mosaic mutations in 
the mosGILT gene using CRISPR/CRISPR associated protein 9 (Cas9). Here, we show
that female mosaic mosGILT mutant mosquitoes display defects in ovarian
development and refractoriness to Plasmodium. Following infection by either
Plasmodium berghei or Plasmodium falciparum, mutant mosquitoes have significantly
reduced oocyst numbers as a result of increased thioester-containing protein 1
(TEP1)-dependent parasite killing. Expression of vitellogenin (Vg), the major
yolk protein that can reduce the parasite-killing efficiency of TEP1, is severely
impaired in mutant mosquitoes. MosGILT is a mosquito factor that is essential for
ovarian development and indirectly protects both human and rodent Plasmodium
species from mosquito immunity.
