BACKGROUND: Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are essential tools in biological
research, diagnosis and therapy, and are conventionally produced in murine
hybridoma cell lines. Professional applications of mAbs depend on the steady
supply of material. Because hybridoma cultures can stop producing the antibody or
even die, preservation of the unique epitope specificity of mAbs by rescue of the
sequences encoding the antibody variable domains (V regions) is important. The
availability of these sequences enables not only the recombinant expression of
the original antibody for further applications, but opens the road for antibody
engineering towards innovative diagnostic or therapeutic applications. A time-
and cost-efficient production system enabling the detailed analysis of the
antibodies is an essential requirement in this context.
METHODS: Sequences were rescued from three hybridoma cell lines, subjected to
sequence analysis, subcloned into binary expression vectors and recombinantly
expressed as chimeric mAb (constant regions of human IgG1:k1) in Nicotiana
benthamiana plants. The properties of the recombinant and the murine mAbs were
compared using competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface 
plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy. The recognition of native PfMSP4 by the
recombinant mAb was analysed by immunofluorescence staining of Pf 3D7A schizonts 
and by western blot analysis of merozoite extract.
RESULTS: The rescued sequences of all three hybridoma cell lines were identical. 
The recombinant mAb was successfully expressed as IgG in plants at moderate
levels (45 mg/kg fresh leaf weight). Preservation of the original epitope was
demonstrated in a competition ELISA, using recombinant mAb and the three murine
mAbs. EGF_PfMSP4-specific affinities were determined by SPR spectroscopy to 8 nM 
and 10 nM for the murine or recombinant mAb, respectively. Binding to parasite
PfMSP4 was confirmed in an immunofluorescence assay showing a characteristic
staining pattern and by western blot analysis using merozoite extract.
CONCLUSIONS: As demonstrated by the example of an EGF_PfMSP4-specific antibody,
the described combination of a simple and efficient hybridoma antibody cloning
approach with the flexible, robust and cost-efficient transient expression system
suitable to rapidly produce mg-amounts of functional recombinant antibodies
provides an attractive method for the generation of mAbs and their derivatives as
research tool, novel therapeutics or diagnostics.
