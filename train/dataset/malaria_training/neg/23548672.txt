There are many ways to present antigens to the immune system. We have used a
repetitive antigen display technology that relies on the self-assembly of 60
protein chains into a spherical self-assembling protein nanoparticle (SAPN) to
develop a vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The protein sequence
contains selected B- and T-cell epitopes of the circumsporozoite protein of P.
falciparum (PfCSP) and, when assembled into a nanoparticle induces strong,
long-lived and protective immune responses against the PfCSP. Here we describe
the conditions needed for promoting self-assembly of a P. falciparum vaccine
nanoparticle, PfCSP-KMY-SAPN, and note pitfalls that may occur when determining
conditions for other SAPN vaccines. Attention was paid to selecting processes
that were amenable to scale up and cGMP manufacturing.
