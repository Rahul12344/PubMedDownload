BACKGROUND: Cell culture techniques have many advantages for investigation of
drug transport to target organ like liver. HepG2 and Huh-7 are two cell lines
available from hepatoma that can be used as a model for hepatic drug transport.
The present study is aimed to analyze the expression level of several drug
transporter genes in two hepatoma cell lines, HepG2 and Huh-7 and their response 
to inhibitors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is an in vitro study using HepG2 and Huh-7 cells. The
expression level of the following drug transporter genes was quantified:
P-glycoprotein/multidrug resistance protein 1, Organic Anionic Transporter
Protein 1B1 (OATP1B1) and Organic Cationic Transporter-1 (OCT1). Ribonucleic acid
was extracted from the cells using Tripure isolation reagent, then gene
expression level of the transporters is quantified using Applied Biosystems
quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Verapamil
(P-glycoprotein inhibitor), nelfinavir (OATP1B1 inhibitor), quinidine (OCT1
inhibitor) were used to differentiate the inhibitory properties of these agents
to the transporter expressions in HepG2 and Huh-7 cells.
RESULTS: Huh-7 shows a higher level of P-glycoprotein, OATP1B1 and OCT1
expressions compared with those of HepG2. Verapamil reduces the expressions of
P-glycoprotein in HepG2 and Huh-7; nelfinavir reduces the expression of OATP1B1
in HepG2 and Huh-7; while quinidine reduces the OCT1 gene expressions in HepG2,
but not in Huh-7 cells.
CONCLUSION: This study indicates that HepG2 might be a more suitable in vitro
model than Huh-7 to study drug transport in hepatocytes involving drug
transporters.
