BACKGROUND: Insecticides are still at the core of insect pest and vector control 
programmes. Several lines of evidence indicate that ABC transporters are involved
in detoxification processes against insecticides, including permethrin and other 
pyrethroids. In particular, the ABCG4 gene, a member of the G subfamily, has
consistently been shown to be up-regulated in response to insecticide treatments 
in the mosquito malaria vector Anopheles stephensi (both adults and larvae).
METHODS: To verify the actual involvement of this transmembrane protein in the
detoxification process of permethrin, bioassays on larvae of An. stephensi,
combining the insecticide with a siRNA, specifically designed for the inhibition 
of ABCG4 gene expression were performed. Administration to larvae of the same
siRNA, labeled with a fluorescent molecule, was effected to investigate the
systemic distribution of the inhibitory RNA into the larval bodies. Based on
siRNA results, similar experiments using antisense Vivo-Morpholinos (Vivo-MOs)
were effected. These molecules, compared to siRNA, are expected to guarantee a
higher stability in environmental conditions and in the insect gut, and present
thus a higher potential for future in-field applications.
RESULTS: Bioassays using two different concentrations of siRNA, associated with
permethrin, led to an increase of larval mortality, compared with results with
permethrin alone. These outcomes confirm that ABCG4 transporter plays a role in
the detoxification process against the selected insecticide. Moreover, after
fluorescent labelling, it was shown the systemic dissemination of siRNA in
different body districts of An. stephensi larvae, which suggest a potential
systemic effect of the molecule. At the same time, results of Vivo-MO experiments
were congruent with those obtained using siRNA, thus confirming the potential of 
ABCG4 inhibition as a strategy to increase permethrin susceptibility in
mosquitoes. For the first time, Vivo-MOs were administered in water to larvae,
with evidence for a biological effect.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeting ABCG4 gene for silencing through both techniques resulted 
in an increased pyrethroid efficacy. These results open the way toward the
possibility to exploit ABCG4 inhibition in the context of integrated programmes
for the control An. stephensi mosquitoes and malaria transmission.
