BACKGROUND: The invasion of red blood cells (RBCs) by malarial parasites is an
essential step in the life cycle of Plasmodium falciparum. Human-parasite surface
protein interactions play a critical role in this process. Although several
interactions between human and parasite proteins have been discovered, the
mechanism related to invasion remains poorly understood because numerous
human-parasite protein interactions have not yet been identified. High-throughput
screening experiments are not feasible for malarial parasites due to difficulty
in expressing the parasite proteins. Here, we performed computational prediction 
of the PPIs involved in malaria parasite invasion to elucidate the mechanism by
which invasion occurs.
RESULTS: In this study, an expectation maximization algorithm was used to
estimate the probabilities of domain-domain interactions (DDIs). Estimates of DDI
probabilities were then used to infer PPI probabilities. We found that our
prediction performance was better than that based on the information of D.
melanogaster alone when information related to the six species was used.
Prediction performance was assessed using protein interaction data from S.
cerevisiae, indicating that the predicted results were reliable. We then used the
estimates of DDI probabilities to infer interactions between 490 parasite and
3,787 human membrane proteins. A small-scale dataset was used to illustrate the
usability of our method in predicting interactions between human and parasite
proteins. The positive predictive value (PPV) was lower than that observed in S. 
cerevisiae. We integrated gene expression data to improve prediction accuracy and
to reduce false positives. We identified 80 membrane proteins highly expressed in
the schizont stage by fast Fourier transform method. Approximately 221
erythrocyte membrane proteins were identified using published mass spectral
datasets. A network consisting of 205 interactions was predicted. Results of
network analysis suggest that SNARE proteins of parasites and APP of humans may
function in the invasion of RBCs by parasites.
CONCLUSIONS: We predicted a small-scale PPI network that may be involved in
parasite invasion of RBCs by integrating DDI information and expression profiles.
Experimental studies should be conducted to validate the predicted interactions. 
The predicted PPIs help elucidate the mechanism of parasite invasion and provide 
directions for future experimental investigations.
