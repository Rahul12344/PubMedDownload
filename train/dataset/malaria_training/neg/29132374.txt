BACKGROUND: Although larviciding can reduce the number of outdoor biting malaria 
vector mosquitoes, which may help to prevent residual malaria transmission, the
current larvicide repertoire is faced with great challenges to sustainability.
The identification of new effective, economical, and biorational larvicides could
facilitate maintenance and expansion of the practice of larviciding in integrated
malaria vector mosquito control programmes. Interfering RNA molecules represent a
novel class of larvicides with untapped potential for sustainable mosquito
control. This investigation tested the hypothesis that short interfering RNA
molecules can be used as mosquito larvicides.
RESULTS: A small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen for larval lethal genes
identified siRNAs corresponding to the Anopheles gambiae suppressor of actin
(Sac1), leukocyte receptor complex member (lrc), and offtrack (otk) genes.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) was engineered to produce short hairpin 
RNAs (shRNAs) for silencing of these genes. Feeding larvae with the engineered
yeasts resulted in silenced target gene expression, a severe loss of neural
synapses in the larval brain, and high levels of larval mortality. The larvicidal
activities of yeast interfering RNA larvicides were retained following heat
inactivation and drying of the yeast into user-friendly tablet formulations that 
induced up to 100% larval mortality in laboratory trials.
CONCLUSIONS: Ready-to-use dried inactivated yeast interfering RNA larvicide
tablets may someday be an effective and inexpensive addition to malaria mosquito 
control programmes and a valuable, biorational tool for addressing residual
malaria transmission.
