Gene-based vaccines as typified by plasmid DNA vaccines and recombinant
viral-vectored vaccines are expected as promising solutions against infectious
diseases for which no effective prophylactic vaccines exist such as HIV, dengue
virus, Ebola virus and malaria, and for which more improved vaccines are needed
such as tuberculosis and influenza virus. Although many preclinical and clinical 
trials have been conducted to date, no DNA vaccines or recombinant viral-vectored
vaccines expressing heterologous antigens for human use have yet been licensed in
the U.S., Europe or Japan. In this research, we describe the current regulatory
context for gene-based prophylactic vaccines against infectious disease in the
U.S., Europe, and Japan. We identify the important considerations, in particular,
on the preclinical assessments that would allow these vaccines to proceed to
clinical trials, and the differences on the regulatory pathway for the marketing 
authorization in each region.
