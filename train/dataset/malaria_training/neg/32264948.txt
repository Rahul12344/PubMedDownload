BACKGROUND: Antigens expressed in sexual stages of the malaria parasites are
targets of transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs). HAP2/GCS1, a TBV candidate, is 
critical for fertilization in Plasmodium. Here, the genetic diversity of PvHAP2
was studied in Plasmodium vivax parasite populations from the Greater Mekong
Subregion (GMS).
METHODS: Plasmodium vivax clinical isolates were collected in clinics from the
China-Myanmar border region (135 samples), western Thailand (41 samples) and
western Myanmar (51 samples). Near full-length Pvhap2 (nucleotides 13-2574) was
amplified and sequenced from these isolates. Molecular evolution studies were
conducted to evaluate the genetic diversity, selection and population
differentiation.
RESULTS: Sequencing of the pvhap2 gene for a total of 227 samples from the three 
P. vivax populations revealed limited genetic diversity of this gene in the GMS
(π = 0.00036 ± 0.00003), with the highest π value observed in Myanmar (0.00053 ± 
0.00009). Y133S was the dominant mutation in the China-Myanmar border (99.26%),
Myanmar (100%) and Thailand (95.12%). Results of all neutrality tests were
negative for all the three populations, suggesting the possible action of
purifying selection. Codon-based tests identified specific codons which are under
purifying or positive selections. Wright's fixation index showed low to moderate 
genetic differentiation of P. vivax populations in the GMS, with FST ranging from
0.04077 to 0.24833, whereas high levels of genetic differentiation were detected 
between the China-Myanmar border and Iran populations (FST = 0.60266), and
between Thailand and Iran populations (FST = 0.44161). A total of 20 haplotypes
were identified, with H2 being the abundant haplotype in China-Myanmar border,
Myanmar and Thailand populations. Epitope mapping prediction of Pvhap2 antigen
showed that high-score B-cell epitopes are located in the S307-G324, L429-P453
and V623-D637 regions. The E317K and D637N mutations located within S307-G324 and
V623-D637 epitopes slightly reduced the predicted score for potential epitopes.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed a very low level of genetic diversity of
pvhap2 gene among P. vivax populations in the Greater Mekong Subregion. The
relative conservation of pvhap2 supports further evaluation of a Pvhap2-based
TBV.
