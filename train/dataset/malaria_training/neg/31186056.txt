OBJECTIVE: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) play a crucial role in the management
and control of malaria infection. The histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP-2) based
RDTs are the most commonly used RDTs for malaria diagnosis in Sudan. Deletion of 
pfhrp2 in Plasmodium falciparum genome affect the accuracy of PfHRP-2 based RDT
kits. This study aimed to identify molecular variation of pfhrp2 among suspected 
malaria patients from different clinics in Omdurman, Sudan.
RESULTS: A noticeable variation between the RDT (Alltest Biotech, China) and nPCR
results was observed, for RDT 78% (46/59) were P. falciparum positive, 6.8%
(4/59) were co-infected with both P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, 15.3%
(9/59) were negative by the RDT. However, when the nPCR was applied only 44.1%
(26/59) and 55.9% (33/59) was P. falciparum positive and negative respectively.
The pfhrp2 was further amplified form all nPCR positive samples. Only 17 DNA
samples were positive from the 26 positive P. falciparum, interestingly,
variation in band sizes was observed and further confirmed by DNA sequencing, and
sequencing analysis revealed a high-level of genetic diversity of the pfhrp2 gene
in the parasite population from the study area. However, despite extreme sequence
variation, diversity of PfHRP2 does not appear to affect RDT performance.
