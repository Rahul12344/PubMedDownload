Malarial rhythmic fevers are the consequence of the synchronous bursting of red
blood cells (RBCs) on completion of the malaria parasite asexual cell cycle.
Here, we hypothesized that an intrinsic clock in the parasite Plasmodium chabaudi
underlies the 24-hour-based rhythms of RBC bursting in mice. We show that
parasite rhythms are flexible and lengthen to match the rhythms of hosts with
long circadian periods. We also show that malaria rhythms persist even when host 
food intake is evenly spread across 24 hours, suggesting that host feeding cues
are not required for synchrony. Moreover, we find that the parasite population
remains synchronous and rhythmic even in an arrhythmic clock mutant host. Thus,
we propose that parasite rhythms are generated by the parasite, possibly to
anticipate its circadian environment.
