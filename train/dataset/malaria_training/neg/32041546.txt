BACKGROUND: Successful mating of female mosquitoes typically occurs once, with
the male sperm being stored in the female spermatheca for every subsequent
oviposition event. The female spermatheca is responsible for the maintenance,
nourishment, and protection of the male sperm against damage during storage.
Aedes aegypti is a major vector of arboviruses, including Yellow Fever, Dengue,
Chikungunya, and Zika. Vector control is difficult due to this mosquito high
reproductive capacity.
RESULTS: Following comparative RNA-seq analyses of spermathecae obtained from
virgin and inseminated females, eight transcripts were selected based on their
putative roles in sperm maintenance and survival, including energy metabolism,
chitin components, transcriptional regulation, hormonal signaling, enzymatic
activity, antimicrobial activity, and ionic homeostasis. In situ RNA
hybridization confirmed tissue-specific expression of the eight transcripts.
Following RNA interference (RNAi), observed outcomes varied between targeted
transcripts, affecting mosquito survival, egg morphology, fecundity, and sperm
motility within the spermathecae.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified spermatheca-specific transcripts associated
with sperm storage in Ae. aegypti. Using RNAi we characterized the role of eight 
spermathecal transcripts on various aspects of female fecundity and offspring
survival. RNAi-induced knockdown of transcript AeSigP-66,427, coding for a
Na+/Ca2+ protein exchanger, specifically interfered with egg production and
reduced sperm motility. Our results bring new insights into the molecular basis
of sperm storage and identify potential targets for Ae. aegypti control.
