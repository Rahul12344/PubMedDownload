BACKGROUND: Sulphadoxine and pyrimethamine are anti-folate drugs that show
synergistic anti-malarial effect. Point mutations in dihydrofolate reductase
(dhfr) and dihydropteorate synthatase (dhps) cause anti-folate drug resistance
phenotype in human malaria parasites. This study presents pattern of point
mutations in dhfr/dhps genes among Indian sub-continent.
METHODS: Microscopically diagnosed one hundred Plasmodium vivax field isolates
were collected from five widely separated geographical regions of India. Dhfr and
dhps genes were PCR amplified and sequenced. Previously published mutations data 
were collected and analyzed using Chi square test to identify geographical
cluster of mutant/wild type genotypes.
RESULTS: Sequence analysis revealed single (S58R), double (S58R/S117N) and
quadruple (F57L/S58R/T61M/S117T/) point mutations at dhfr and single (A383G) to
double (A383G/A553G) mutations at dhps in P. vivax field isolates. In addition,
three new mutations were also observed at dhfr. Both, dhfr and dhps genes
revealed tandem repeat variations in field isolates. Dhps revealed very low
mutation frequency (14.0%) compared to dhfr (50.70%). Comparative analysis
revealed a progressive increase in frequency of quadruple mutant dhfr genotype
(p<0.001) within five years in north-eastern state (Kamrup, Assam). Frequency of 
dhfr genotypes revealed three distinct geographical clusters of wild (northern
India), double mutant (southern India), and quadruple mutant (north-eastern and
island regions of India) on the Indian sub-continent.
CONCLUSION: Study suggests that SP may be susceptible to P. vivax in India,
except Andaman and north-eastern state. The distinction of geographical regions
with sensitive and resistant parasite phenotypes would be highly useful for
designing and administering national anti-malarial drug policy.
