BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax is the second most prevalent human malaria parasite 
in Bangladesh; however, there are no data of its genetic diversity. Several
molecular markers are available where Pvcsp, Pvmsp 1 and Pvmsp 3α are most
commonly used for P. vivax genotyping studies. The aim of the study was to
investigate the population structure of P. vivax in Bangladesh.
METHODS: A total of 102 P. vivax-positive blood samples were collected from
different malaria-endemic areas in Bangladesh and subsequently analysed for those
three genotyping markers. Nested PCR was performed for diagnosis and genotyping
analysis followed by PCR-RFLP to detect genetic diversity using Pvcsp, Pvmsp 1
and Pvmsp 3α markers.
RESULTS: Analysis of Pvcsp showed that the VK210 repeat type was highly prevalent
(64.7%, 66/102) compared to VK247 (35.3%, 36/102), although the prevalence of
VK247 was higher than other Southeast Asian countries. Analysis of these three
genes revealed a diverse, circulating population of P. vivax where a total of
ten, 56 and 35 distinct genotypes were detected for Pvcsp, Pvmsp 1 and Pvmsp 3α, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: This genotyping observation of P. vivax is the first report from
Bangladesh and will provide valuable information for establishing the genotyping 
methods and circulating genetic variants of these three markers available in
Bangladesh.
