Anopheles sinensis (Diptera: Culicidae) is an important vector of Plasmodium
vivax in Southeast Asia. To facilitate population genetic and genomic studies of 
An. sinensis, we developed a standard cytogenetic photomap for this species. The 
polytene chromosomes were straightened and divided into 39 numbered divisions and
116 lettered subdivisions. The chromosomal localizations of 13 DNA probes were
determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization. A comparison of the physical map
for An. sinensis with the genome map for Anopheles gambiae revealed a whole-arm
autosomal translocation between the two species. Specifically, the 2R arm of
An. gambiae corresponds to the 3R arm of An. sinensis and the pattern of
correspondence of the other chromosome arms remains regular. We mapped the
breakpoints of the polymorphic paracentric chromosomal inversion 3Ra to
subdivisions 28A and 31A. The standard cytogenetic map developed in this study
will be useful for detailed comparative genome mapping and population genetic
studies of An. sinensis.
