Artemisinin (ART) and its derivatives form the mainstay of antimalarial therapy. 
Emergence of resistance to them poses a potential threat to future malaria
control and elimination on a global level. It is important to know the mechanism 
of action of drug and development of drug resistance. We put forwards probable
correlation between the mode of action of chloroquine (CQ) and ART. Modified
trophozoite maturation inhibition assay, WHO Mark III assay and molecular marker 
study for CQ resistance at K76T codon in Plasmodium falciparum CQ-resistant
transporter gene were carried out on cultured P. falciparum. On comparing
trophozoite and schizont growth for both CQ-sensitive (MRC-2) and CQ-resistant
(RKL-9) culture isolates, it was observed that the clearance of trophozoites and 
schizonts was similar with both drugs. The experiment supports that CQ interferes
with heme detoxification pathway in food vacuoles of parasite, and this may be
correlated as one of the plausible mechanisms of ART.
