High-Complexity Plasmodium falciparum Infections, North Central Nigeria,
2015-2018.

The mass migration that occurred during 2009-2013 and after the insurgency in
northeastern Nigeria could have increased malaria incidence and Plasmodium
falciparum genetic diversity in North Central Nigeria. To determine P. falciparum
sequence diversity in this region, we screened 282 samples collected in regional 
clinics during 2015-2018 for Plasmodium spp. and, with positive samples,
determined P. falciparum infection complexity and allele diversity using PCR. Of 
34 P. falciparum-positive samples, 39 msp1, 31 msp2, and 13 glurp alleles were
detected, and 88% of infections were polyclonal. We identified trimorphic and
dimorphic allele combinations in a high percentage of samples, indicative of a
high infection complexity in the study population. High genetic diversity is a
catalyst for the evolution of drug-resistant alleles. Improved measures (e.g.,
better drug quality, diagnostics) are needed to control P. falciparum
transmission and reduce the potential for the emergence of drug resistance in
Nigeria.
