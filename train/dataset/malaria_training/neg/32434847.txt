Immunization with attenuated Plasmodium sporozoites can induce protection against
malaria infection, as shown by Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoites attenuated 
by radiation in multiple clinical trials. As alternative attenuation strategy
with a more homogeneous population of Pf sporozoites (PfSPZ), genetically
engineered Plasmodium berghei sporozoites (SPZ) lacking the genes b9 and slarp
induced sterile protection against malaria in mice. Consequently, PfSPZ-GA1
Vaccine, a Pf identical double knockout (Pf∆b9∆slarp), was generated as a
genetically attenuated malaria parasite vaccine and tested for safety,
immunogenicity, and preliminary efficacy in malaria-naïve Dutch volunteers.
Dose-escalation immunizations up to 9.0 × 105 PfSPZ of PfSPZ-GA1 Vaccine were
well tolerated without breakthrough blood-stage infection. Subsequently, groups
of volunteers were immunized three times by direct venous inoculation with
cryopreserved PfSPZ-GA1 Vaccine (9.0 × 105 or 4.5 × 105 PfSPZ, N = 13 each),
PfSPZ Vaccine (radiation-attenuated PfSPZ, 4.5 × 105 PfSPZ, N = 13), or normal
saline placebo at 8-week intervals, followed by exposure to mosquito bite
controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). After CHMI, 3 of 25 volunteers from
both PfSPZ-GA1 groups were sterilely protected, and the remaining 17 of 22 showed
a patency ≥9 days (median patency in controls, 7 days; range, 7 to 9). All
volunteers in the PfSPZ Vaccine control group developed parasitemia (median
patency, 9 days; range, 7 to 12). Immunized groups exhibited a significant,
dose-related increase in anti-Pf circumsporozoite protein (CSP) antibodies and
Pf-specific interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-producing T cells. Although no definite
conclusion can be drawn on the potential strength of protective efficacy of
PfSPZ-GA1 Vaccine, the favorable safety profile and induced immune responses by
PfSPZ-GA1 Vaccine warrant further clinical evaluation.
