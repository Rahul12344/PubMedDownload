BACKGROUND: Given the central importance of anti-malarial drugs in the treatment 
of malaria, there is a need to understand the effect of Plasmodium infection on
the broad spectrum of drug metabolizing enzymes. Previous studies have shown
reduced clearance of quinine, a treatment for Plasmodium infection, in
individuals with malaria.
METHODS: The hepatic expression of a large panel of drug metabolizing enzymes was
studied in the livers of mice infected with the AS strain of Plasmodium chabaudi 
chabaudi, a nonlethal parasite in most strains of mice with several features that
model human Plasmodium infections. C57BL/6J mice were infected with P. chabaudi
by intraperitoneal injection of infected erythrocytes and sacrificed at different
times after infection. Relative hepatic mRNA levels of various drug metabolizing 
enzymes, cytokines and acute phase proteins were measured by reverse
transcriptase-real time PCR. Relative levels of cytochrome P450 proteins were
measured by Western blotting with IR-dye labelled antibodies. Pharmacokinetics of
5 prototypic cytochrome P450 substrate drugs were measured by cassette dosing and
high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results were
analysed by MANOVA and post hoc univariate analysis of variance.
RESULTS: The great majority of enzyme mRNAs were down-regulated, with the
greatest effects occurring at the peak of parasitaemia 8Â days post infection.
Protein levels of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the Cyp 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e, 3a and 4a
subfamilies were also down-regulated. Several distinct groups differing in their 
temporal patterns of regulation were identified. The cassette dosing study
revealed that at the peak of parasitaemia, the clearances of caffeine, bupropion,
tolbutamide and midazolam were markedly reduced by 60-70%.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings in a model of uncomplicated human malaria suggest
that changes in drug clearance in this condition may be of sufficient magnitude
to cause significant alterations in exposure and response of anti-malarial drugs 
and co-medications.
