Regulatory genes are often multifunctional and constrained, which results in
evolutionary conservation. It is difficult to understand how a regulatory gene
could be lost from one species' genome when it is essential for viability in
closely related species. The gene paired is a classic Drosophila pair-rule gene, 
required for formation of alternate body segments in diverse insect species.
Surprisingly, paired was lost in mosquitoes without disrupting body patterning.
Here, we demonstrate that a paired family member, gooseberry, has acquired
paired-like expression in the malaria mosquito Anopheles stephensi.
Anopheles-gooseberry CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out mutants display pair-rule phenotypes
and alteration of target gene expression similar to what is seen in Drosophila
and beetle paired mutants. Thus, paired was functionally replaced by the related 
gene, gooseberry, in mosquitoes. Our findings document a rare example of a
functional replacement of an essential regulatory gene and provide a mechanistic 
explanation of how such loss can occur.
