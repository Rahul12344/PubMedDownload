microRNAs play important regulatory role in all intrinsic cellular functions.
Amongst lepidopteran insects, miRNAs from only Bombyx mori have been studied
extensively with a little focus on Spodoptera sp. In the present study, we
identified a total of 226 miRNAs from Spodoptera frugiperda cell line Sf21. Of
the total, 116 miRNAs were well conserved within other insects, like B. mori,
Drosophila melanogaster and Tribolium castenum while the remaining 110 miRNAs
were identified as novel based on comparative analysis with the insect miRNA data
set. Landscape distribution analysis based on Sf21 genome assembly revealed
clustering of few novel miRNAs. A total of 5 miRNA clusters were identified and
the largest one encodes 5 miRNA genes. In addition, 12 miRNAs were validated
using northern blot analysis and putative functional role assignment for 6 Sf
miRNAs was investigated by examining their relative abundance at different
developmental stages of Spodoptera litura and body parts of 6th instar larvae.
Further, we identified a total of 809 potential target genes with GO terms for
selected miRNAs, involved in different metabolic and signalling pathways of the
insect. The newly identified miRNAs greatly enrich the repertoire of insect
miRNAs and analysis of expression profiles reveal their involvement at various
steps of biochemical pathways of the army worm.
