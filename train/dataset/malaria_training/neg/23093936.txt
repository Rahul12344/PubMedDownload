The mosquito is the obligate vector for malaria transmission. To complete its
development within the mosquito, the malaria parasite Plasmodium must overcome
the protective action of the mosquito innate immune system. Here we report on the
involvement of the Anopheles gambiae orthologue of a conserved component of the
vertebrate immune system, LPS-induced TNFÎ± transcription factor (LITAF), and its 
role in mosquito anti-Plasmodium immunity. An. gambiae LITAF-like 3 (LL3)
expression is up-regulated in response to midgut invasion by both rodent and
human malaria parasites. Silencing of LL3 expression greatly increases parasite
survival, indicating that LL3 is part of an anti-Plasmodium defense mechanism.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays identified specific LL3 DNA-binding motifs 
within the promoter of SRPN6, a gene that also mediates mosquito defense against 
Plasmodium. Further experiments indicated that these motifs play a direct role in
LL3 regulation of SRPN6 expression. We conclude that LL3 is a transcription
factor capable of modulating SRPN6 expression as part of the mosquito
anti-Plasmodium immune response.
