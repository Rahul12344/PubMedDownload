Genome-wide analysis of transcription in the malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum has revealed robust variation in steady-state mRNA abundance
throughout the 48-h intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC), suggesting that 
this process is highly dynamic and tightly regulated. Here, we utilize rapid
4-thiouracil (4-TU) incorporation via pyrimidine salvage to specifically label,
capture, and quantify newly-synthesized RNA transcripts at every hour throughout 
the IDC. This high-resolution global analysis of the transcriptome captures the
timing and rate of transcription for each newly synthesized mRNA in vivo,
revealing active transcription throughout all IDC stages. Using a statistical
model to predict the mRNA dynamics contributing to the total mRNA abundance at
each timepoint, we find varying degrees of transcription and stabilization for
each mRNA corresponding to developmental transitions. Finally, our results
provide new insight into co-regulation of mRNAs throughout the IDC through
regulatory DNA sequence motifs, thereby expanding our understanding of P.
falciparum mRNA dynamics.
