In insects, ABC transporters have been shown to contribute to defence/resistance 
to insecticides by reducing toxic concentrations in cells/tissues. Despite the
extensive studies about this detoxifying mechanism, the temporal patterns of ABC 
transporter activation have been poorly investigated. Using the malaria vector
Anopheles stephensi as a study system, we investigated the expression profile of 
ABC genes belonging to different subfamilies in permethrin-treated larvae at
different time points (30 min to 48 h). Our results showed that the expression of
ABCB and ABCG subfamily genes was upregulated at 1 h after treatment, with the
highest expression observed at 6 h. Therefore, future investigations on the
temporal dynamics of ABC gene expression will allow a better implementation of
insecticide treatment regimens, including the use of specific inhibitors of ABC
efflux pumps.
