BACKGROUND: Hyperuricemia and associated cardio-metabolic disorders are more
prevalent in African Americans than in European Americans. We used genome-wide
admixture mapping and association testing to identify loci with ancestry effects 
on serum uric acid levels.
METHODS: We analyzed 1,976 African Americans from Washington, D.C, including
1,322 individuals from 328 pedigrees and 654 unrelated individuals, enrolled in
the Howard University Family Study. We performed admixture mapping and
genome-wide association testing using ~800 k autosomal single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs). We performed fine mapping by dense genotyping. We assessed 
functionality by a combination of bioinformatic annotation, reporter gene assays,
and gel shift experiments. We also analyzed 12,641 individuals enrolled in the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
RESULTS: We detected a genome-wide significant locus on chromosome 11p15.4 at
which serum uric acid levels increased with increasing African ancestry,
independent of kidney function. Fine-mapping identified two independent signals
in the β-globin locus. The ancestral allele at SNP rs2855126, located upstream of
the hemoglobin, gamma A gene HBG1, was associated with increased serum uric acid 
levels and higher expression of a reporter gene relative to the derived allele.
Hyperuricemia was associated with increased risk of hypertension in 3,767 African
Americans (Odds Ratio = 2.48, p = 2.71 × 10(-19)).
CONCLUSIONS: Given that increased expression of γ-globin leads to increased
levels of fetal hemoglobin which confers protection against malaria, we
hypothesize that evolution in Africa of protection against malaria may have
occurred at the cost of increased serum uric acid levels, contributing to the
high rates of hyperuricemia and associated cardio-metabolic disorders observed in
African Americans.
