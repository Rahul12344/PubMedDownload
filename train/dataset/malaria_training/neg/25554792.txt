Comment in
    Science. 2015 Jan 2;347(6217):27-8.

Variation in vectorial capacity for human malaria among Anopheles mosquito
species is determined by many factors, including behavior, immunity, and life
history. To investigate the genomic basis of vectorial capacity and explore new
avenues for vector control, we sequenced the genomes of 16 anopheline mosquito
species from diverse locations spanning ~100 million years of evolution.
Comparative analyses show faster rates of gene gain and loss, elevated gene
shuffling on the X chromosome, and more intron losses, relative to Drosophila.
Some determinants of vectorial capacity, such as chemosensory genes, do not show 
elevated turnover but instead diversify through protein-sequence changes. This
dynamism of anopheline genes and genomes may contribute to their flexible
capacity to take advantage of new ecological niches, including adapting to humans
as primary hosts.
