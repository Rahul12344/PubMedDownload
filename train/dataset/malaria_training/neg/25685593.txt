We aimed to determine the current prevalence of four P. falciparum candidate
artemisinin resistance biomarkers L263E, E431K, A623E, and S769N in the pfatpase6
gene in a high transmission area in Tanzania in a retrospective cross sectional
study using 154 archived samples collected from three previous malaria studies in
2010, 2011 and 2013. Mutations in pfatpase6 gene were detected in parasite DNA
isolated from Dried Blood Spots by using PCR-RFLP. We observed overall allelic
frequencies for L263E, E431K, A623E, and S769N to be 5.8% (9/154), 16.2%
(25/154), 0.0% (0/154), and 3.9% (6/154). The L263E mutation was not detected in 
2010 but occurred at 3.9% and 2.6% in 2011 and 2013 respectively. The L263E
mutation showed a significant change of frequency between 2010 and 2011, but not 
between 2011 and 2013 (P < 0.05). Frequency of E431K was highest of all without
any clear trend whereas S769N increased from 2.2% in 2010 to 3.6% in 2011 and
5.1% in 2013. A623E mutation was not detected. The worrisome detection and the
increase in the frequency of S769N and other mutations calls for urgent
assessment of temporal changes of known artemisinin biomarkers in association
with in vivo ACT efficacy.
