A better understanding of human-to-mosquito transmission is crucial to control
malaria. In order to assess factors associated with gametocyte carriage, 2083
samples were collected in a cross-sectional survey in Papua New Guinea.
Plasmodium species were detected by light microscopy and qPCR and gametocytes by 
detection of pfs25 and pvs25 mRNA transcripts by reverse-transcriptase PCR
(qRT-PCR). The parasite prevalence by PCR was 18.5% for Plasmodium falciparum and
13.0% for P. vivax. 52.5% of all infections were submicroscopic. Gametocytes were
detected in 60% of P. falciparum-positive and 51% of P. vivax-positive samples.
Each 10-fold increase in parasite density led to a 1.8-fold and 3.3-fold increase
in the odds of carrying P. falciparum and P. vivax gametocytes. Thus the
proportion of gametocyte positive and gametocyte densities was highest in young
children carrying high asexual parasite densities and in symptomatic individuals.
Dilution series of gametocytes allowed absolute quantification of gametocyte
densities by qRT-PCR and showed that pvs25 expression is 10-20 fold lower than
pfs25 expression. Between 2006 and 2010 parasite prevalence in the study site has
decreased by half. 90% of the remaining infections were asymptomatic and likely
constitute an important reservoir of transmission. However, mean gametocyte
densities were low (approx. 1-2 gametocyte/Î¼L) and it remains to be determined to
what extent low-density gametocyte positive individuals are infective to
mosquitos.
