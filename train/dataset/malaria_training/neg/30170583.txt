BACKGROUND: Bats are home to diverse haemosporidian parasites namely Plasmodium
and Plasmodium-related. While information is available at a worldwide level,
haemosporidian infection in bats from Madagascar is still scarce and recent
changes in the taxonomy of the island's bat fauna, particularly the description
of several new species, require a reassessment of previously described patterns, 
including blood parasite ecology and vectorial transmission.
METHODS: A sample representing seven of the nine known bat families and 31 of the
46 currently recognized taxa from Madagascar and collected in the western and
central portions of the island were screened by PCR for the presence of
Polychromophilus. In addition, Nycteribiidae flies parasitizing Miniopteridae and
Vespertilionidae were screened for parasites with the aim to better understand
aspects of vector transmission. Phylogenetic reconstruction using the
mitochondrial cytochrome b encoding gene was used in a Bayesian analysis to
examine the relationship between Polychromophilus recovered from Malagasy bats
and those identified elsewhere.
RESULTS: Polychromophilus infection was restricted to Miniopterus spp.
(Miniopteridae), Myotis goudoti (Vespertilionidae), and Paratriaenops furculus
(Rhinonycteridae), with an overall infection rate of 13.5%. Polychromophilus
melanipherus was found infecting Miniopterus spp. and P. furculus, whereas
Polychromophilus murinus was only recovered from M. goudoti. These two protozoan 
parasites species were also detected in bat flies species known to parasitize
Miniopterus spp. and M. goudoti, respectively. Generalized linear model analyses 
were conducted to elucidate the effect of species and sex on haemoparasites
infection in Miniopterus spp., which revealed that males have higher risk of
infection than females and prevalence differed according to the considered
Miniopterus host. Molecular screening of nycteribiid flies revealed three
positive species for Polychromophilus spp., including Penicillidia sp. (cf.
fulvida), Penicillidia leptothrinax, and Nycteribia stylidiopsis. These three fly
species are known to parasitize Miniopterus spp. and M. goudoti and should be
considered as potential vectors of Polychromophilus spp.
CONCLUSION: Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated the existence of at least four
distinct clades within the genus Polychromophilus, two of which were documented
in the present study. The screening of nycteribiid flies overlaid on the highly
diversified genus Miniopterus, provides considerable insight into parasite
transmission, with bat infection being associated with their roosting behaviour
and the occurrence of specific arthropod vectors.
