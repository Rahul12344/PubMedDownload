BACKGROUND: Immunization with genetically engineered, attenuated malaria
parasites (GAP) that arrest during liver infection confers sterile protection in 
mouse malaria models. A first generation Plasmodium falciparum GAP (Pf
p52(-)/p36(-) GAP) was previously generated by deletion of two pre-erythrocytic
stage-expressed genes (P52 and P36) in the NF54 strain.
METHODS: A first-in-human, proof-of-concept, safety and immunogenicity clinical
trial in six human volunteers was conducted. Exposure consisted of delivery of Pf
p52(-)/p36(-) GAP sporozoites via infected Anopheles mosquito bite with a
five-bite/volunteer exposure followed by an approximately 200-bite
exposure/volunteer one month later.
RESULTS: The exposures were well tolerated with mild to moderate local and
systemic reactions. All volunteers remained blood stage negative after low dose
exposure. Five volunteers remained blood stage negative after high dose exposure.
One volunteer developed peripheral parasitemia twelve days after high dose
exposure. Together the findings indicate that Pf p52(-)/p36(-) GAP was severely
but not completely attenuated. All six volunteers developed antibodies to CSP.
Furthermore, IFN-γ responses to whole sporozoites and multiple antigens were
elicited in 5 of 6 volunteers, with both CD4 and CD8 cell cytokine production
detected.
CONCLUSION: Severe attenuation and favorable immune responses following
administration of a first generation Pf p52(-)/p36(-) GAP suggests that further
development of live-attenuated strains using genetic engineering should be
pursued.
