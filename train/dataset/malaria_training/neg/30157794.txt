BACKGROUND: Genetic diversity in Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) parasites 
is a major hurdle to the control of malaria. This study monitored changes in the 
genetic diversity and the multiplicity of P. falciparum parasite infection in
asymptomatic children living in southern Ghana at 3 month intervals between April
2015 and January 2016.
METHODS: Filter paper blood spots (DBS) were collected quarterly from children
living in Obom, a community with perennial malaria transmission and Abura, a
community with seasonal malaria transmission. Genomic DNA was extracted from the 
DBS and used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based genotyping of the merozoite
surface protein 1 (msp 1) and merozoite surface protein 2 (msp 2) genes.
RESULTS: Out of a total of 787 samples that were collected from the two study
sites, 59.2% (466/787) tested positive for P. falciparum. The msp 1 and msp 2
genes were successfully amplified from 73.8% (344/466) and 82.5% (385/466) of the
P. falciparum positive samples respectively. The geometric mean MOI in Abura
ranged between 1.17 (95% CI: 1.08-1.28) and 1.48 (95% CI: 1.36-1.60) and was
significantly lower (p < 0.01, Dunn's multiple comparison test) than that
determined in Obom, where the geometric mean MOI ranged between 1.82 (95% CI:
1.58-2.08) and 2.50 (95% CI: 2.33-2.678) over the study period. Whilst the msp 1 
R033:MAD20:KI allelic family ratio was dynamic, the msp 2 3D7:FC27 allelic family
ratio remained relatively stable across the changing seasons in both sites.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that seasonal variations in parasite diversity in
these communities can be better estimated by msp 1 rather than msp 2 due to the
constantly changing relative intra allelic frequencies observed in msp 1 and the 
fact that the dominance of any msp 2 allele was dependent on the transmission
setting but not on the season as opposed to the dominance of any msp 1 allele,
which was dependent on both the season and the transmission setting.
