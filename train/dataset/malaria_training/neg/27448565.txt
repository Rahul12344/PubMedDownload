BACKGROUND: Drugs that kill or inhibit Plasmodium gametocytes in the human host
could potentially synergize the impact of other chemotherapeutic interventions by
blocking transmission. To develop such agents, reliable methods are needed to
study the in vitro activity of compounds against gametocytes. This study
describes a novel assay for characterizing the activity of anti-malarial drugs
against the later stages of Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte development using
real-time PCR (qPCR).
METHODS: Genes previously reported to be transcribed at the different sexual
stages of the gametocytogenesis were selected for study and their mRNA expression
was measured in a gametocytogenesis course by qPCR. Genes mainly expressed in the
later stages of gametocyte development were used as a surrogate measurement of
drug activity. To distinguish between cidal and static drug effects, two
different experiments were performed in parallel, one with constant drug pressure
throughout the experiment (144 h), and another in which the gametocyte cultures
were exposed to the compound for only 48 h.
RESULTS: Four P. falciparum genes coding for proteins Pf77, ROM3, Pfs25, and
Pfg377 with transcription specific for late-stage gametocyte development were
identified. The in vitro anti-malarial activity of compounds against such
gametocytes was assessed by measuring mRNA levels of these genes using qPCR. The 
assay was validated against standard anti-malarial drugs (epoxomicin,
dihydroartemisinin, chloroquine, thiostrepton, and methylene blue) and compounds 
from the GSK compound library with known anti-gametocyte activity.
CONCLUSIONS: This study describes a novel assay for characterizing the activity
of anti-malarial drugs against the later stages of P. falciparum gametocyte
development using qPCR in genetically unmodified parasites. The method described 
is a reliable and user-friendly technique with a medium throughput that could be 
easily implemented in any laboratory.
