BACKGROUND: Antigenic variation in Plasmodium falciparum involves switching among
multicopy var gene family and is responsible for immune evasion and the
maintenance of chronic infections. Current understanding of var gene expression
and switching patterns comes from experiments conducted on long
laboratory-adapted strains, with little known about their wild counterparts.
METHODS: Genome sequencing was used to obtain 50 var genes from a parasite
isolated from the China-Myanmar border. Four clones with different dominant var
genes were cultured in vitro in replicates for 50 generations. Transcription of
the individual var gene was detected by real-time PCR and then the switching
process was analysed.
RESULTS: The expression of multicopy var genes is mutually exclusive in clones of
a wild P. falciparum isolate. The activation of distinct primary dominant var
genes leads to different and favoured switching patterns in the four clones. The 
on/off rates of individual var genes are variable and the choice of subsequent
dominant var genes are random, which results in the different switching patterns 
among replicates of each clonal wild P. falciparum isolate with near identical
initial transcription profiles.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the switching patterns of var genes are
abundant, which consist of both conserved and random parts.
