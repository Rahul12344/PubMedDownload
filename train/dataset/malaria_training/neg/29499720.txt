BACKGROUND: Several studies were carried out in experimental hut station in areas
surrounding the city of Bouaké, after the crisis in Côte d'Ivoire. They reported 
increasing resistance levels to insecticide for malaria transmiting mosquitoes.
The present work aims to evaluate the current resistance level of An. gambiae
(s.l.) in rural and urban areas in the city of Bouaké.
METHODS: Larvae of Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) were collected from five different
study sites and reared to adult stages. The resistance status was assessed using 
the WHO bioassay test kits for adult mosquitoes, with eight insecticides
belonging to pyrethroids, organochlorines, carbamates and organophosphates
classes. Molecular assays were performed to identify the molecular forms of An.
gambiae (s.l.), the L1014F kdr and the ace-1R alleles in individual mosquitoes.
The synergist PBO was used to investigate the role of enzymes in resistance.
Biochemical assays were performed to detect potential increased activities in
mixed function oxidase (MFO) levels, non-specific esterases (NSE) and glutathione
S-transferases (GST).
RESULTS: High resistance levels to pyrethroids, organochlorines, and carbamates
were observed in Anopheles gambiae (s.l.) from Bouaké. Mortalities ranged between
0 and 73% for the eight tested insecticides. The pre-exposure to PBO restored
full or partial susceptibility to pyrethroids in the different sites. The same
trend was observed with the carbamates in five sites, but to a lesser extent.
With DDT, pre-exposure to PBO did not increase the mortality rate of An. gambiae 
(s.l.) from the same sites. Tolerance to organophosphates was observed. An
increased activity of NSE and higher level of MFO were found compared to the
Kisumu susceptible reference strain. Two molecular forms, S form [(An. gambiae
(s.s)] and M form (An. coluzzi) were identified. The kdr allele frequencies vary 
from 85.9 to 99.8% for An. gambiae (s.s.) and from 81.7 to 99.6% for An.
coluzzii. The ace-1R frequencies vary between 25.6 and 38.8% for An. gambiae
(s.s.) and from 28.6 to 36.7% for An. coluzzii.
CONCLUSION: Resistance to insecticides is widespread within both An. gambiae
(s.s.) and An. coluzzii. Two mechanisms of resistance, i.e. metabolic and
target-site mutation seemed to largely explain the high resistance level of
mosquitoes in Bouaké. Pyrethroid resistance was found exclusively due to the
metabolic mechanism.
