Malaria cases caused by the zoonotic parasite Plasmodium knowlesi are being
increasingly reported throughout Southeast Asia and in travelers returning from
the region. To test for evidence of signatures of selection or unusual population
structure in this parasite, we surveyed genome sequence diversity in 48 clinical 
isolates recently sampled from Malaysian Borneo and in five lines maintained in
laboratory rhesus macaques after isolation in the 1960s from Peninsular Malaysia 
and the Philippines. Overall genomewide nucleotide diversity (π = 6.03 × 10(-3)) 
was much higher than has been seen in worldwide samples of either of the major
endemic malaria parasite species Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. A
remarkable substructure is revealed within P. knowlesi, consisting of two major
sympatric clusters of the clinical isolates and a third cluster comprising the
laboratory isolates. There was deep differentiation between the two clusters of
clinical isolates [mean genomewide fixation index (FST) = 0.21, with 9,293 SNPs
having fixed differences of FST = 1.0]. This differentiation showed marked
heterogeneity across the genome, with mean FST values of different chromosomes
ranging from 0.08 to 0.34 and with further significant variation across regions
within several chromosomes. Analysis of the largest cluster (cluster 1, 38
isolates) indicated long-term population growth, with negatively skewed allele
frequency distributions (genomewide average Tajima's D = -1.35). Against this
background there was evidence of balancing selection on particular genes,
including the circumsporozoite protein (csp) gene, which had the top Tajima's D
value (1.57), and scans of haplotype homozygosity implicate several genomic
regions as being under recent positive selection.
