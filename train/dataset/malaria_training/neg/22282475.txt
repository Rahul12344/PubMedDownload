Plasmodium ookinetes traverse midgut epithelial cells before they encounter the
complement system in the mosquito hemolymph. We identified a heme peroxidase
(HPX2) and NADPH oxidase 5 (NOX5) as critical mediators of midgut epithelial
nitration and antiplasmodial immunity that enhance nitric oxide toxicity in
Anopheles gambiae. We show that the two immune mechanisms that target
ookinetes-epithelial nitration and thioester-containing protein 1 (TEP1)-mediated
lysis-work sequentially, and we propose that epithelial nitration works as an
opsonization-like system that promotes activation of the mosquito complement
cascade.
