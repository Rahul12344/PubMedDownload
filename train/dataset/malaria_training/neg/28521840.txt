BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax uses multiple ligand-receptor interactions for
preferential invasion of human reticulocytes. Several of these ligands have been 
identified by in silico approaches based on the role displayed by their orthologs
in other Plasmodium species during initial adhesion or invasion. However, the
cell adhesion role of proteins that are exclusive to species that specifically
invade reticulocytes (as P. vivax and P. cynomolgi) has not been evaluated to
date. This study aimed to characterise an antigen shared between Plasmodium
species that preferentially infect reticulocytes with a focus on assessing its
binding activity to target cells.
RESULTS: An in silico analysis was performed using P. vivax proteome data to
identify and characterise one antigen shared between P. vivax and P. cynomolgi.
This led to identification of the pvrbsa gene present in the P. vivax VCG-I
strain genome. This gene is transcribed in mature schizonts and encodes a protein
located on the parasite surface. rPvRBSA was antigenic and capable of binding to 
a population of reticulocytes with a different Duffy phenotype. Interestingly,
the molecule showed a higher percentage of binding to immature human
reticulocytes (CD71hi).
CONCLUSIONS: This study describes for the first time, a molecule involved in host
cell binding that is exclusive in reticulocyte-infecting Plasmodium species. This
suggest that PvRBSA is an antigenic adhesin that plays a role in parasite binding
to target cells.
