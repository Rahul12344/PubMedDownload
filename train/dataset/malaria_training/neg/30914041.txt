BACKGROUND: Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is recommended for intermittent
preventive treatment of malaria in Africa. However, increasing SP resistance
(SPR) affects the therapeutic efficacy of the SP. As molecular markers, Pfdhfr
(dihydrofolate reductase) and Pfdhps (dihydropteroate synthase) genes are widely 
used for SPR surveillance. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of Pfdhfr
and Pfdhps genes mutations and haplotypes in Plasmodium falciparum isolates
collected from Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea (EG).
METHODS: In total, 180 samples were collected in 2013-2014. The single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) of the Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes were identified with nested
PCR and Sanger sequencing. The genotypes and linkage disequilibrium (LD) tests
were also analysed.
RESULTS: Sequences of Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes were obtained from 92.78% (167/180)
and 87.78% (158/180) of the samples, respectively. For Pfdhfr, 97.60% (163/167), 
87.43% (146/167) and 97.01% (162/167) of the samples carried N51I, C59R and S108N
mutant alleles, respectively. The prevalence of the Pfdhps S436A, A437G, K540E,
A581G, and A613S mutations were observed in 20.25% (32/158), 90.51% (143/158),
5.06% (8/158), 0.63% (1/158), and 3.16% (5/158) of the samples, respectively. In 
total, 3 unique haplotypes at the Pfdhfr locus and 8 haplotypes at the Pfdhps
locus were identified. A triple mutation (CIRNI) in Pfdhfr was the most prevalent
haplotype (86.83%), and a single mutant haplotype (SGKAA; 62.66%) was predominant
in Pfdhps. A total of 130 isolates with 12 unique haplotypes were found in the
Pfdhfr and Pfdhps combined haplotypes, 65.38% (85/130) of them carried quadruple 
allele combinations (CIRNI-SGKAA), whereas only one isolate (0.77%, 1/130) was
found to carry the wild-type (CNCSI-SAKAA). For LD analysis, the Pfdhfr N51I was 
significantly associated with the Pfdhps A437G (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Bioko Island possesses a high prevalence of the Pfdhfr triple
mutation (CIRNI) and Pfdhps single mutation (SGKAA), which will undermine the
pharmaceutical effect of SP for malaria treatment strategies. To avoid an
increase in SPR, continuous molecular monitoring and additional control efforts
are urgently needed in Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea.
