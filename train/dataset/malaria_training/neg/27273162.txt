OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the distribution and origin of 
hemoglobin E (HbE) in seven minority groups from various geographical regions of 
the malaria-endemic Yunnan province, southwestern China, which have similar
ethnic origins and geographic relationships with HbE-prevalent populations of
Southeast Asian countries.
METHODS: By using Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length
Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods, the prevalence of HbE was examined in 1488
individuals from seven native minority groups of Yunnan, and β-globin gene
cluster haplotypes were determined on 1420 chromosomes.
RESULTS: The prevalence of HbE in the study populations ranged from 1.5 to 39.1%.
Higher HbE prevalence was correlated with the minority groups of Tibeto-Burman
origin and groups from the Dehong district. The βE -globin genes in Yunnan were
mostly associated with three haplotypes [-+++++-], [+----+-], and [-+-+++-] on
chromosomes with gene framework 2. Interestingly, the predominant βE associated
haplotype in Yunnan minorities was remarkably different from that in other
previously reported populations. This study, for the first time, reports
population-based data on the heterogeneity of HbE gene frequencies and haplotype 
distribution in native minorities from southwestern China.
CONCLUSIONS: Natural selection based on the presence of malaria, ethnic origin,
and epistatic interactions may be factors of varying importance for the
remarkable variation in HbE frequency among these minority groups. In addition,
there appears to be a common origin of the βE -globin gene in populations from
Yunnan and Southeast Asia. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 28:927-931, 2016. © 2016Wiley
