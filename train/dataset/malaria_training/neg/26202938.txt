OBJECTIVE: To assess N51I, C59R and S108N polymorphisms of dihydrofolate
reductase (dhfr) and A437G and K540E of dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) genes of 
P. falciparum isolates recovered from pregnant women with asymptomatic malaria in
a coastal setting in Nigeria.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 107 consenting and consecutively enrolled
pregnant women (mean age ± standard deviation, 26.6 ± 4.5 years) attending
antenatal care at the Iru/Victoria Island Primary Health Centre, Lagos, were
screened for peripheral malaria by microscopy, by a histidine-rich
protein-2-based rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) using finger-pricked and dot blood samples. DNA was extracted from the
blood and used for dhfr and dhps gene polymorphism analyses by PCR and
restriction fragment length polymorphism. The sociodemographic and parasite data 
obtained were analysed.
RESULTS: Of the 107 patients, 34 (31.8%), 46 (43%) and 40 (37.4%) were found to
be P. falciparum infected using microscopy, RDT and corrected RDT-PCR,
respectively (p < 0.05). The prevalence of P. falciparum isolates with mutant and
mixed genotypes of dhfr at codons 51, 59 and 108 was 70, 75 and 80%,
respectively, and the triple mutation in the homozygous form was 35%. The
prevalence of the homozygous quintuple dhfr plus dhps mutant was 5%, while that
of the P. falciparum isolates with mutant or mixed genotypes of dhps at codons
437 and 540 was 37.5 and 22.5%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed the emergence of the K540E mutation among the
parasite population in Lagos. However, it supports the implementation of the
intermittent preventive treatment of malaria during pregnancy with
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine with continuous effectiveness monitoring in the study 
area.
