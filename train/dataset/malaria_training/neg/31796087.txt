BACKGROUND: Anti-malarial resistance is, and continues to be a significant
challenge in the fight against malaria and a threat to achieving malaria
elimination. In Zambia, chloroquine (CQ), a safe, affordable and well-tolerated
drug, was removed from use in 2003 due to high levels of resistance evidenced
with treatment failure. This study sought to investigate the prevalence of
chloroquine resistance markers in Southern and Western Provinces of Zambia
14 years after the withdrawal of CQ.
METHODS: Data from a cross-sectional, all-age household survey, conducted during 
the peak malaria transmission season (April-May 2017) was analysed. During the
all-age survey, socio-demographic information and coverage of malaria
interventions were collected. Consenting individuals were tested for malaria with
a rapid diagnostic test and a spot of blood collected on filter paper to create a
dried blood spot (DBS). Photo-induced electronic transfer-polymerase chain
reaction (PET-PCR) was used to analyse the DBS for the presence of all four
malaria species. Plasmodium falciparum positive samples were analysed by high
resolution melt (HRM) PCR to detect the presence of genotypic markers of drug
resistance in the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt) and P.
falciparum multi-drug resistance (Pfmdr) genes.
RESULTS: A total of 181 P. falciparum positive samples were examined for pfcrt
K76T and MDR N86. Of the 181 samples 155 successfully amplified for Pfcrt and 145
for Pfmdr N86. The overall prevalence of CQ drug-resistant parasites was 1.9%
(3/155), with no significant difference between the two provinces. No N86Y/F
mutations in the Pfmdr gene were observed in any of the sample.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals the return of CQ sensitive parasites in Southern
and Western Provinces of Zambia 14 years after its withdrawal. Surveillance of
molecular resistant markers for anti-malarials should be included in the Malaria 
Elimination Programme so that resistance is monitored country wide.
