An unexpectedly large fraction of genes in metazoans (human, mouse, zebrafish,
worm, fruit fly) express high levels of circularized RNAs containing canonical
exons. Here we report that circular RNA isoforms are found in diverse species
whose most recent common ancestor existed more than one billion years ago: fungi 
(Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), a plant (Arabidopsis
thaliana), and protists (Plasmodium falciparum and Dictyostelium discoideum). For
all species studied to date, including those in this report, only a small
fraction of the theoretically possible circular RNA isoforms from a given gene
are actually observed. Unlike metazoans, Arabidopsis, D. discoideum, P.
falciparum, S. cerevisiae, and S. pombe have very short introns (âˆ¼ 100
nucleotides or shorter), yet they still produce circular RNAs. A minority of
genes in S. pombe and P. falciparum have documented examples of canonical
alternative splicing, making it unlikely that all circular RNAs are by-products
of alternative splicing or 'piggyback' on signals used in alternative RNA
processing. In S. pombe, the relative abundance of circular to linear transcript 
isoforms changed in a gene-specific pattern during nitrogen starvation. Circular 
RNA may be an ancient, conserved feature of eukaryotic gene expression programs.
