BACKGROUND: Nigeria carries a high burden of malaria which makes continuous
surveillance for current information on genetic diversity imperative. In this
study, the merozoite surface proteins (msp-1, msp-2) and glutamate-rich protein
(glurp) of Plasmodium falciparum collected from two communities representing
rural and urban settings in Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria were analysed.
METHODS: A total of 511 febrile children, aged 3-59 months, whose
parents/guardians provided informed consent, were recruited into the study.
Capillary blood was obtained for malaria rapid diagnostic test, thick blood
smears for parasite count and blood spots on filter paper for molecular analysis.
RESULTS: Three-hundred and nine samples were successfully genotyped for msp-1,
msp-2 and glurp genes. The allelic distribution of the three genes was not
significantly different in the rural and urban communities. R033 and 3D7 were the
most prevalent alleles in both rural and urban communities for msp-1 and msp-2,
respectively. Eleven of glurp RII region genotypes, coded I-XII, with sizes
ranging from 500 to 1100 base pairs were detected in the rural setting. Genotype 
XI (1000-1050 bp) had the highest prevalence of 41.5 and 38.5% in rural and urban
settings, respectively. Overall, 82.1 and 70.0% of samples had multiclonal
infection with msp-1 gene resulting in a mean multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 
2.8 and 2.6 for rural and urban samples, respectively. Msp-1 and msp-2 genes
displayed higher levels of diversity and higher MOI rates than the glurp gene.
CONCLUSION: Significant genetic diversity was observed between rural and urban
parasite populations in Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria. The results of this study
show that malaria transmission intensity in these regions is still high. No
significant difference was observed between rural and urban settings, except for 
a completely different msp-1 allele, compared to previous reports, thereby
confirming the changing face of malaria transmission in these communities. This
study provides important baseline information required for monitoring the impact 
of malaria elimination efforts in this region and data points useful in revising 
current protocols.
