Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein-1 (PvMSP1) gene codes for a major
malaria vaccine candidate antigen. However, its polymorphic nature represents an 
obstacle to the design of a protective vaccine. In this study, we analyzed the
genetic polymorphism and natural selection of the C-terminal 42 kDa fragment
within PvMSP1 gene (Pv MSP142) from 77 P. vivax isolates, collected from imported
cases of China-Myanmar border (CMB) areas in Yunnan province and the inland cases
from Anhui, Yunnan, and Zhejiang province in China during 2009-2012. Totally, 41 
haplotypes were identified and 30 of them were new haplotypes. The differences
between the rates of non-synonymous and synonymous mutations suggest that
PvMSP142 has evolved under natural selection, and a high selective pressure
preferentially acted on regions identified of PvMSP133. Our results also
demonstrated that PvMSP142 of P. vivax isolates collected on China-Myanmar border
areas display higher genetic polymorphisms than those collected from inland of
China. Such results have significant implications for understanding the dynamic
of the P. vivax population and may be useful information towards China malaria
elimination campaign strategies.
