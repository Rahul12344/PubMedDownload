Plasmodium parasites develop within red blood cells in a Parasitophorous Vacuole 
enclosed by a Membrane, the PVM. The protein family ETRAMP (Early Transcribed
Membrane Protein) comprises small proteins inserted in the PVM via a single
transmembrane domain. Among those, Pfs16 is specifically found in P. falciparum
gametocyte PVM. The P. berghei gene PBANKA_1003900 is syntenic with pfs16. The
encoded proteins have a similar domain structure but the overall protein
similarity is low. A transcript of the P. berghei gene is only found in
gametocytes and ookinetes and a C-terminal mCherry fusion of the protein revealed
its presence only in gametocytes. A knock-out mutant of the PBANKA_1003900 gene
was not affected in sexual development and ookinete formation was similar to WT. 
The mutation had no adverse effect on transmission through the mosquito although 
there was a reduction of the number of oocysts formed by the mutant parasites.
