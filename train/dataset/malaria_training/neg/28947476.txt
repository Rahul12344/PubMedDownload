High treatment failure rates for Plasmodium falciparum malaria have been reported
in Colombia for chloroquine, amodiaquine, and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine.
Artemisinin combination therapies were introduced in 2006 in Colombia, where
artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is currently used to treat uncomplicated P.
falciparum malaria. Artemisinin (ART) resistance was initially observed in
Southeast Asia as an increased parasite clearance time, manifesting as a positive
thick-blood smear on day 3 after treatment (D3 positivity). Recently, mutations
in the propeller domain of the P. falciparumkelch13 gene (K13 propeller) have
been associated with ART resistance. In this study, we surveyed AL effectiveness 
at D3 and molecular markers of drug resistance among 187 uncomplicated P.
falciparum cases in 4 regions of Colombia from June 2014 to July 2015. We found
that 3.2% (4/125) of patients showed D3 positivity, 100% (163/163) of isolates
carried wild-type K13 propeller alleles, 12.9% (23/178) of isolates had multiple 
copies of the multidrug resistance 1 gene (mdr1), and 75.8% (113/149) of isolates
harbored the double mutant NFSDD mdr1 haplotype (the underlining indicates mutant
alleles). These data suggest that ART resistance is not currently suspected in
Colombia but that monitoring for lumefantrine resistance and AL failures should
continue.
