BACKGROUND: Parasite cytoadherence within the microvasculature of tissues and
organs of infected individuals is implicated in the pathogenesis of several
malaria syndromes. Multiple host receptors may mediate sequestration. The
identity of the host receptor(s), or the parasite ligand(s) responsible for
sequestration of Plasmodium species other than Plasmodium falciparum is largely
unknown. The rodent malaria parasites may be useful to model interactions of
parasite species, which lack the var genes with their respective hosts, as other 
multigene families are shared between the species. The role of the endothelial
receptors ICAM-1 and CD36 in cytoadherence and in the development of pathology
was investigated in a Plasmodium chabaudi infection in C57BL/6 mice lacking these
receptors. The schizont membrane-associated cytoadherence (SMAC) protein of
Plasmodium berghei has been shown to exhibit reduced CD36-associated
cytoadherence in P. berghei ANKA-infected mice.
METHODS: Parasite tissue sequestration and the development of acute stage
pathology in P. chabaudi infections of mice lacking CD36 or ICAM-1, their
respective wild type controls, and in infections with mutant P. chabaudi
parasites lacking the smac gene were compared. Peripheral blood parasitaemia, red
blood cell numbers and weight change were monitored throughout the courses of
infection. Imaging of bioluminescent parasites in isolated tissues (spleen,
lungs, liver, kidney and gut) was used to measure tissue parasite load.
RESULTS: This study shows that neither the lack of CD36 nor the deletion of the
smac gene from P. chabaudi significantly impacted on acute-stage pathology or
parasite sequestration. By contrast, in the absence of ICAM-1, infected animals
experience less anaemia and weight loss, reduced parasite accumulation in both
spleen and liver and higher peripheral blood parasitaemia during acute stage
malaria. The reduction in parasite tissue sequestration in infections of ICAM-1
null mice is maintained after mosquito transmission.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that ICAM-1-mediated cytoadherence is
important in the P. chabaudi model of malaria and suggest that for rodent
malarias, as for P. falciparum, there may be multiple host and parasite molecules
involved in sequestration.
