Malaria is one of the three major global health threats. Drug development for
malaria, especially for its most dangerous form caused by Plasmodium falciparum, 
remains an urgent task due to the emerging drug-resistant parasites. Exploration 
of novel antimalarial drug targets identified a trifunctional enzyme, malate
quinone oxidoreductase (MQO), located in the mitochondrial inner membrane of P.
falciparum (PfMQO). PfMQO is involved in the pathways of mitochondrial electron
transport chain, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and fumarate cycle. Recent studies
have shown that MQO is essential for P. falciparum survival in asexual stage and 
for the development of experiment cerebral malaria in the murine parasite P.
berghei, providing genetic validation of MQO as a drug target. However, chemical 
validation of MQO, as a target, remains unexplored. In this study, we used active
recombinant protein rPfMQO overexpressed in bacterial membrane fractions to
screen a total of 400 compounds from the Pathogen Box, released by Medicines for 
Malaria Venture. The screening identified seven hit compounds targeting rPfMQO
with an IC50 of under 5 μM. We tested the activity of hit compounds against the
growth of 3D7 wildtype strain of P. falciparum, among which four compounds showed
an IC50 from low to sub-micromolar concentrations, suggesting that PfMQO is
indeed a potential antimalarial drug target.
