BACKGROUND: In the Greater Mekong sub-region, Plasmodium vivax has become the
predominant species and imposes a major challenge for regional malaria
elimination. This study aimed to investigate the variations in genes potentially 
related to drug resistance in P. vivax populations from the China-Myanmar border 
area. In addition, this study also wanted to determine whether divergence existed
between parasite populations associated with asymptomatic and acute infections.
METHODS: A total of 66 P. vivax isolates were obtained from patients with acute
malaria who attended clinics at the Laiza area, Kachin State, Myanmar in 2015. In
addition, 102 P. vivax isolates associated with asymptomatic infections were
identified by screening of volunteers without signs or symptoms from surrounding 
villages. Slide-positive samples were verified with nested PCR detecting the 18S 
rRNA gene. Multiclonal infections were further excluded by genotyping at msp-3α
and msp-3β genes. Parasite DNA from 60 symptomatic cases and 81 asymptomatic
infections was used to amplify and sequence genes potentially associated with
drug resistance, including pvmdr1, pvcrt-o, pvdhfr, pvdhps, and pvk12.
RESULTS: The pvmdr1 Y976F and F1076L mutations were present in 3/113 (2.7%) and
97/113 (85.5%) P. vivax isolates, respectively. The K10 insertion in pvcrt-o gene
was found in 28.2% of the parasites. Four mutations in the two antifolate
resistance genes reached relatively high levels of prevalence: pvdhfr S58R
(53.4%), S117N/T (50.8%), pvdhps A383G (75.0%), and A553G (36.3%). Haplotypes
with wild-type pvmdr1 (976Y/997K/1076F) and quadruple mutations in pvdhfr
(13I/57L/58R/61M/99H/117T/173I) were significantly more prevalent in symptomatic 
than asymptomatic infections, whereas the pvmdr1 mutant haplotype 976Y/997K/1076L
was significantly more prevalent in asymptomatic than symptomatic infections. In 
addition, quadruple mutations at codons 57, 58, 61 and 117 of pvdhfr and double
mutations at codons 383 and 553 of pvdhps were found both in asymptomatic and
symptomatic infections with similar frequencies. No mutations were found in the
pvk12 gene.
CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in pvdhfr and pvdhps were prevalent in both symptomatic
and asymptomatic P. vivax infections, suggestive of resistance to antifolate
drugs. Asymptomatic carriers may act as a silent reservoir sustaining
drug-resistant parasite transmission necessitating a rational strategy for
malaria elimination in this region.
