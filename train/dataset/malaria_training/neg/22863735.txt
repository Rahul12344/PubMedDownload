P. cynomolgi, a malaria-causing parasite of Asian Old World monkeys, is the
sister taxon of P. vivax, the most prevalent malaria-causing species in humans
outside of Africa. Because P. cynomolgi shares many phenotypic, biological and
genetic characteristics with P. vivax, we generated draft genome sequences for
three P. cynomolgi strains and performed genomic analysis comparing them with the
P. vivax genome, as well as with the genome of a third previously sequenced
simian parasite, Plasmodium knowlesi. Here, we show that genomes of the monkey
malaria clade can be characterized by copy-number variants (CNVs) in multigene
families involved in evasion of the human immune system and invasion of host
erythrocytes. We identify genome-wide SNPs, microsatellites and CNVs in the P.
cynomolgi genome, providing a map of genetic variation that can be used to map
parasite traits and study parasite populations. The sequencing of the P.
cynomolgi genome is a critical step in developing a model system for P. vivax
research and in counteracting the neglect of P. vivax.
