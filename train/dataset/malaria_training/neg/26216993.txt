Tools to reliably measure Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) exposure in individuals and 
communities are needed to guide and evaluate malaria control interventions.
Serologic assays can potentially produce precise exposure estimates at low cost; 
however, current approaches based on responses to a few characterized antigens
are not designed to estimate exposure in individuals. Pf-specific antibody
responses differ by antigen, suggesting that selection of antigens with defined
kinetic profiles will improve estimates of Pf exposure. To identify novel
serologic biomarkers of malaria exposure, we evaluated responses to 856 Pf
antigens by protein microarray in 186 Ugandan children, for whom detailed Pf
exposure data were available. Using data-adaptive statistical methods, we
identified combinations of antibody responses that maximized information on an
individual's recent exposure. Responses to three novel Pf antigens accurately
classified whether an individual had been infected within the last 30, 90, or 365
d (cross-validated area under the curve = 0.86-0.93), whereas responses to six
antigens accurately estimated an individual's malaria incidence in the prior
year. Cross-validated incidence predictions for individuals in different
communities provided accurate stratification of exposure between populations and 
suggest that precise estimates of community exposure can be obtained from
sampling a small subset of that community. In addition, serologic incidence
predictions from cross-sectional samples characterized heterogeneity within a
community similarly to 1 y of continuous passive surveillance. Development of
simple ELISA-based assays derived from the successful selection strategy outlined
here offers the potential to generate rich epidemiologic surveillance data that
will be widely accessible to malaria control programs.
