The gene fragment of PFC0460w was amplified from RNA of Plasmodium falciparum 3D7
strain with RT-PCR, and cloned into pGEM-T easy vector. The recombinant plasmid
was transformed into E. coli DH5alpha and the positive clones were selected,
which were identified by PCR and sequencing. The results showed that there were
three sequences of PFC0460w fragment, respectively with length of 618, 597 and
543 bp. The 618 bp fragment was completely consistent with the sequence published
in PlasmoDB (GenBank No. XM_001351147), and the 597 bp and 543 bp fragments were 
submitted to GenBank with Accession No. of JF799872 and JF799873, respectively.
205 amino acids were encoded by the 618 bp fragment, and five kinds of protein
structure were predicted by Robetta.
