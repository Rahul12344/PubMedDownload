Resistance to antifolates in Plasmodium falciparum is well described and has been
observed in clinical settings for decades. At the molecular level, point
mutations in the dhfr gene that lead to resistance have been identified, and the 
crystal structure of the wildtype and mutant dihydrofolate reductase enzymes have
been solved in complex with native substrate and drugs. However, we are only
beginning to understand the complexities of the evolutionary pressures that lead 
to the evolution of drug resistance in this system. Microbial systems that allow 
heterologous expression of malarial proteins provide a tractable way to
investigate patterns of evolution that can inform our eventual understanding of
the more complex factors that influence the evolution of drug resistance in
clinical settings. In this paper we will review work in Escherichia coli and
Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression systems that explore the fitness landscape of
mutations implicated in drug resistance and show that (i) a limited number of
evolutionary pathways to resistance are followed with high probability; (ii)
fitness costs associated with the maintenance of high levels of resistance are
modest; and (iii) different antifolates may exert opposing selective forces.
