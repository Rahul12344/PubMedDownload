This review considers available evidence for mechanisms of conferred adaptive
advantages in the face of specific infectious diseases. In short, we explore a
number of genetic conditions, which carry some benefits in adverse circumstances 
including exposure to infectious agents. The examples discussed are conditions
known to result in resistance to a specific infectious disease, or have been
proposed as being associated with resistance to various infectious diseases.
These infectious disease-genetic disorder pairings include malaria and
hemoglobinopathies, cholera and cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis and Tay-Sachs
disease, mycotic abortions and phenylketonuria, infection by enveloped viruses
and disorders of glycosylation, infection by filoviruses and Niemann-Pick C1
disease, as well as rabies and myasthenia gravis. We also discuss two genetic
conditions that lead to infectious disease hypersusceptibility, although we did
not cover the large number of immunologic defects leading to infectious disease
hypersusceptibilities. Four of the resistance-associated pairings
(malaria/hemogloginopathies, cholera/cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis/Tay-Sachs, and
mycotic abortions/phenylketonuria) appear to be a result of selection pressures
in geographic regions in which the specific infectious agent is endemic. The
other pairings do not appear to be based on selection pressure and instead may be
serendipitous. Nonetheless, research investigating these relationships may lead
to treatment options for the aforementioned diseases by exploiting established
mechanisms between genetically affected cells and infectious organisms. This may 
prove invaluable as a starting point for research in the case of diseases that
currently have no reliably curative treatments, e.g., HIV, rabies, and Ebola.
