Artemisinins are efficacious antimalarial drugs widely employed as first-line
treatment in endemic countries under the form of combined therapies. Different
molecular modes of action have been postulated to explain the parasiticidal
effect of these compounds; however, none has been unequivocally accepted, and
their physiological relevance is still questioned. Similarly, no definite genetic
determinant of Plasmodium sensitivity to artemisinins has been identified so far.
A better understanding of the mode of action of artemisinins and the genetic
basis of laboratory-induced or field-observed altered susceptibility is crucial
for malaria control. In this review different models of artemisinins' molecular
action are briefly presented, focusing on recent advances, and the evidence of
potential association between various gene polymorphisms and artemisinin
resistance is comprehensively reviewed.
