Antimalarial drug resistance has historically arisen through convergent de novo
mutations in Plasmodium falciparum parasite populations in Southeast Asia and
South America. For the past decade in Southeast Asia, artemisinins, the core
component of first-line antimalarial therapies, have experienced delayed parasite
clearance associated with several pfk13 mutations, primarily C580Y. We report
that mutant pfk13 has emerged independently in Guyana, with genome analysis
indicating an evolutionary origin distinct from Southeast Asia. Pfk13 C580Y
parasites were observed in 1.6% (14/854) of samples collected in Guyana in
2016-2017. Introducing pfk13 C580Y or R539T mutations by gene editing into local 
parasites conferred high levels of in vitro artemisinin resistance. In vitro
growth competition assays revealed a fitness cost associated with these pfk13
variants, potentially explaining why these resistance alleles have not increased 
in frequency more quickly in South America. These data place local malaria
control efforts at risk in the Guiana Shield.

plain-language-summary: All recommended treatments against malaria include a drug
called artemisinin or some of its derivatives. However, there are concerns that
Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes most cases of malaria, will
eventually develop widespread resistance to the drug. A strain of P. falciparum
partially resistant to artemisinin was seen in Cambodia in 2008, and it has since
spread across Southeast Asia. The resistance appears to be frequently linked to a
mutation known as pfk13 C580Y. Southeast Asia and Amazonia are considered to be
hotspots for antimalarial drug resistance, and the pfk13 C580Y mutation was
detected in the South American country of Guyana in 2010. To examine whether the 
mutation was still circulating in this part of the world, Mathieu et al.
collected and analyzed 854 samples across Guyana between 2016 and 2017. Overall, 
1.6% of the samples had the pfk13 C580Y mutation, but this number was as high as 
8.8% in one region. Further analyses revealed that the mutation in Guyana had not
spread from Southeast Asia, but that it had occurred in Amazonia independently.
To better understand the impact of the pfk13 C580Y mutation, Mathieu et al.
introduced this genetic change into non-resistant parasites from a country
neighbouring Guyana. As expected, the mutation made P. falciparum highly
resistant to artemisinin, but it also slowed the growth rate of the parasite.
This disadvantage may explain why the mutation has not spread more rapidly
through Guyana in recent years. Artemisinin and its derivatives are always
associated with other antimalarial drugs to slow the development of resistance;
there are concerns that reduced susceptibility to artemisinin leads to the
parasites becoming resistant to the partner drugs. Further research is needed to 
evaluate how the pfk13 C580Y mutation affects the parasite’s response to the
typical combination of drugs that are given to patients.
