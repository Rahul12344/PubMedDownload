Molecular interactions between a parasite and its host are key to the ability of 
the parasite to enter the host and persist. Our understanding of the genes and
proteins involved in these interactions is limited. To better understand these
processes it would be advantageous to have a range of methods to predict pairs of
genes involved in such interactions. Correlated gene expression profiles can be
used to identify molecular interactions within a species. Here we have extended
the concept to different species, showing that genes with correlated expression
are more likely to encode proteins, which directly or indirectly participate in
host-parasite interaction. We go on to examine our predictions of molecular
interactions between the malaria parasite and both its mammalian host and insect 
vector. Our approach could be applied to study any interaction between species,
for example, between a host and its parasites or pathogens, but also symbiotic
and commensal pairings.
