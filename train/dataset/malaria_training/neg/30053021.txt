Background: In 2005, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) switched to
artesunate/amodiaquine as the first-line antimalarial in response to increasing
sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine resistance and adopted intermittent preventive
treatment using sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine in pregnancy.
Objectives: To determine the prevalence of molecular markers of
sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine resistance in southwestern DRC 10 years after the new
policy was instituted.
Methods: From March 2014 to December 2015, blood samples were collected from
symptomatic patients presenting to outpatient centres in urban and rural areas. A
total of 2030 confirmed Plasmodium falciparum isolates were genotyped at codons
associated with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine resistance.
Results: The prevalence of pfdhfr-N51I, C59R and S108N and pfdhps-A437G mutations
was consistently high; the prevalence of the pfdhps-K540E mutation was low but
increased since its first report in 2008 in the same region, reaching 17.6% by
2015. The pfdhps-A581G mutation increased from ∼4.5% in 2014 to ∼14.0% in 2015 at
urban sites while in rural areas it remained low (∼4.0%). The mutations
pfdhfr-I164L and pfdhps-A613S were detected for the first time in DRC. Also, 11
(0.8%) isolates revealed the presence of the newly described pfdhps-I431V
mutation. Combining pfdhfr and pfdhps alleles, quintuple and sextuple mutations
were observed, with the emergence of septuple (IRNI/IAGEGA)- and octuple
(IRNI/VAGKGS)-mutant genotypes.
Conclusions: Intermittent preventive treatment using sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine
during pregnancy remains warranted in southwestern DRC. However, the expansion of
pfdhps-K540E mutation and emergence of mutants that cause higher levels of
sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine resistance is concerning and may present a challenge
for future preventive interventions in the country.
