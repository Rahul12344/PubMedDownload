Mosquitoes, which transmit infectious diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever,
are harmful to human health. Thus, accurate and rapid identification of vectors
is a critical step for the control of mosquito-borne diseases. However,
phenotypic variations in adults, lack of recognizable features of the immature,
and fragility of mosquitoes make identification difficult. Molecular approaches
have been widely applied to identify mosquitoes, yet these methods have been
focused only on the identification of a few species. This study used sequences of
two mitochondrial genes, COI and ND2, and a ribosomal gene, ITS2, to design
species-specific probes. Biochips thus developed were able to provide
simultaneous identification of nine important medical and veterinary species,
including the immature, from genera of Aedes, Anopheles, Armigeres, and Culex.
This chip was also applied to samples collected from the field. Despite its
inability to resolve the close affinity species of Culex quinquefasciatus and
Culex pipiens molestus, pertinent biochips are expected to be applied to a mass
screening method.
