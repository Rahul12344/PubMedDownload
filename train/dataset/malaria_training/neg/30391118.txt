Mosquitoes are widely despised for their exasperating buzzing and irritating
bites, and more poignantly because, during blood-feeding, females may transmit
pathogens that cause devastating diseases. However, the ability to transmit such 
viruses, filarial worms, or malaria parasites varies greatly amongst the ∼3500
recognised mosquito species. Applying omics technologies to sample this diversity
and explore the biology underlying these variations is bringing increasingly
greater resolution that enhances our understanding of mosquito evolution. Here we
review the current status of mosquito omics, or 'mozomics', resources and recent 
advances in their applications to characterise mosquito biology and evolution,
with a focus on the intersection of evolutionary and functional genomics to
understand the putative links between gene and genome dynamism and mosquito
diversity.
