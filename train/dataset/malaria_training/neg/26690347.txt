Suspected artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum can be explored by
examining polymorphisms in the Kelch (PfK13) propeller domain. Sequencing of
PfK13 and other gene resistance markers was performed on 98 samples from Guyana. 
Five of these samples carried the C580Y allele in the PfK13 propeller domain,
with flanking microsatellite profiles different from those observed in Southeast 
Asia. These molecular data demonstrate independent emergence of the C580Y K13
mutant allele in Guyana, where resistance alleles to previously used drugs are
fixed. Therefore, in Guyana and neighboring countries, continued molecular
surveillance and periodic assessment of the therapeutic efficacy of
artemisinin-based combination therapy are warranted.
