We screened for malaria in 594 blood samples from febrile patients who tested
negative by a Plasmodium falciparum-specific histidine-rich protein-2-based rapid
diagnostic test at 12 health facilities in Zanzibar districts North A and
Micheweni, from May to August 2010. Screening was with microscopy, polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) targeting the cytochrome b gene (cytbPCR) of the four major 
human malaria species, and quantitative PCR (qPCR). The prevalence of
cytbPCR-detectable malaria infection was 2% (12 of 594), including 8 P.
falciparum, 3 Plasmodium malariae, and 1 Plasmodium vivax infections. Microscopy 
identified 4 of 8 P. falciparum infections. Parasite density as estimated by
microscopy or qPCR was > 4,000 parasites/μL in 5 of 8 cytbPCR-detectable P.
falciparum infections. The infections that were missed by the rapid diagnostic
test represent a particular challenge in malaria elimination settings and
highlight the need for more sensitive point-of-care diagnostic tools to improve
case detection of all human malaria species in febrile patients.
