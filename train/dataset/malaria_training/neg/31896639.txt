The whole-genome shotgun sequence of a moderately halophilic bacterium, Halomonas
sp. strain SBS 10, was assembled and studied. The assembled genome size was
1.5 Mb, with a G+C content of 63.6%. The genome sequence of this Halomonas sp.
SBS 10 isolate will be valuable in understanding gene clusters and functions
involved in the adaptability of this bacterium to hypersaline conditions.
