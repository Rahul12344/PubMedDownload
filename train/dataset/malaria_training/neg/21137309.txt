By using a series of type-specific primers for Plasmodium vivax circumsporozoite 
protein (CSP) gene and nested PCR, genotyping was conducted for the specimens of 
Plasmodium vivax isolated from China-Myanmar border. In 174 isolates of P. vivax,
four genotypes, namely, tropical zone family strain, temperate zone family
strain, genotype-mixed infection and PV-II type, were identified each accounting 
for 54.6%, 35.6%, 6.9%, and 2.9%, respectively. The tropical zone family strain
was dominant in the border area. There was no significant difference on the P.v
CSP genotype constitution between Laza isolate of Myanmar and Tengchong isolate
of Yunnan, China.
