BACKGROUND: The malaria elimination plan of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) is
jeopardized by the increasing number of Plasmodium vivax infections and emergence
of parasite strains with reduced susceptibility to the frontline drug treatment
chloroquine/primaquine. This study aimed to determine the evolution of the P.
vivax multidrug resistance 1 (Pvmdr1) gene in P. vivax parasites isolated from
the China-Myanmar border area during the major phase of elimination.
METHODS: Clinical isolates were collected from 275 P. vivax patients in 2008,
2012-2013 and 2015 in the China-Myanmar border area and from 55 patients in
central China. Comparison was made with parasites from three border regions of
Thailand.
RESULTS: Overall, genetic diversity of the Pvmdr1 was relatively high in all
border regions, and over the seven years in the China-Myanmar border, though
slight temporal fluctuation was observed. Single nucleotide polymorphisms
previously implicated in reduced chloroquine sensitivity were detected. In
particular, M908L approached fixation in the China-Myanmar border area. The Y976F
mutation sharply decreased from 18.5% in 2008 to 1.5% in 2012-2013 and
disappeared in 2015, whereas F1076L steadily increased from 33.3% in 2008 to
77.8% in 2015. While neutrality tests suggested the action of purifying selection
on the pvmdr1 gene, several likelihood-based algorithms detected positive as well
as purifying selections operating on specific amino acids including M908L, T958M 
and F1076L. Fixation and selection of the nonsynonymous mutations are differently
distributed across the three border regions and central China. Comparison with
the global P. vivax populations clearly indicated clustering of haplotypes
according to geographic locations. It is noteworthy that the temperate-zone
parasites from central China were completely separated from the parasites from
other parts of the GMS.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that P. vivax populations in the China-Myanmar
border has experienced major changes in the Pvmdr1 residues proposed to be
associated with chloroquine resistance, suggesting that drug selection may play
an important role in the evolution of this gene in the parasite populations.
