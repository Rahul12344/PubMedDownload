Background: Anaemia is a major public health concern especially in African
children living in malaria-endemic regions. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) is elevated 
during malaria infection and is thought to influence erythropoiesis and iron
status. Genetic variants in the IFN-γ gene (IFNG) are associated with increased
IFN-γ production. We investigated putative functional single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes of IFNG in relation to nutritional iron
status and anaemia in Gambian children over a malaria season. Methods: We used
previously available data from Gambian family trios to determine informative SNPs
and then used the Agena Bioscience MassArray platform to type five SNPs from the 
IFNG gene in a cohort of 780 Gambian children aged 2-6 years. We also measured
haemoglobin and biomarkers of iron status and inflammation at the start and end
of a malaria season. Results: We identified five IFNG haplotype-tagging SNPs (
IFNG-1616 [rs2069705], IFNG+874 [rs2430561], IFNG+2200 [rs1861493], IFNG+3234
[rs2069718] and IFNG+5612 [rs2069728]). The IFNG+2200C [rs1861493] allele was
associated with reduced haemoglobin concentrations (adjusted β -0.44 [95% CI
-0.75, -0.12]; Bonferroni adjusted P = 0.03) and a trend towards iron deficiency 
compared to wild-type at the end of the malaria season in multivariable models
adjusted for potential confounders. A haplotype uniquely identified by IFNG+2200C
was similarly associated with reduced haemoglobin levels and trends towards iron 
deficiency, anaemia and iron deficiency anaemia at the end of the malaria season 
in models adjusted for age, sex, village, inflammation and malaria parasitaemia. 
Conclusion: We found limited statistical evidence linking IFNG polymorphisms with
a risk of developing iron deficiency and anaemia in Gambian children. More
definitive studies are needed to investigate the effects of genetically
influenced IFN-γ levels on the risk of iron deficiency and anaemia in children
living in malaria-endemic areas.
