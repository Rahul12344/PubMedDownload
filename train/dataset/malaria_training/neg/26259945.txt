Molecular epidemiology leverages genetic information to study the risk factors
that affect the frequency and distribution of malaria cases. This article
describes molecular epidemiologic investigations currently being carried out by
the International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMR) network in a
variety of malaria-endemic settings. First, we discuss various novel approaches
to understand malaria incidence and gametocytemia, focusing on Plasmodium
falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Second, we describe and compare different
parasite genotyping methods commonly used in malaria epidemiology and population 
genetics. Finally, we discuss potential applications of molecular epidemiological
tools and methods toward malaria control and elimination efforts.
