Control of gene expression is crucial for parasite survival and is the result of 
a series of processes that are regulated to permit fine-tuning of gene expression
in response to biological changes during the life-cycle of apicomplexan
parasites. Control of mRNA nuclear export is a key process in eukaryotic cells
but is poorly understood in apicomplexan parasites. Here, we review recent
knowledge regarding this process with an emphasis on T. gondii. We describe the
presence of divergent orthologs and discuss structural and functional differences
in export factors between apicomplexans and other eukaryotic lineages.
Undoubtedly, the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in high throughput screenings
associated with the discovery of mRNA nuclear export complexes by proteomic
analysis will contribute to identify these divergent factors. Ligand-based or
structure-based strategies may be applied to investigate the potential use of
these proteins as targets for new antiprotozoal agents.
