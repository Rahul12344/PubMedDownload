Circumsporozoite (CS) protein is a malaria antigen involved in sporozoite
invasion of hepatocytes, and thus considered to have good vaccine potential. We
evaluated the polymorphism of the Plasmodium vivax CS gene in 24 parasite
isolates collected from malaria-endemic areas of Colombia. We sequenced 27
alleles, most of which (25/27) corresponded to the VK247 genotype and the
remainder to the VK210 type. All VK247 alleles presented a mutation (Gly → Asn)
at position 28 in the N-terminal region, whereas the C-terminal presented three
insertions: the ANKKAGDAG, which is common in all VK247 isolates; 12 alleles
presented the insertion GAGGQAAGGNAANKKAGDAG; and 5 alleles presented the
insertion GGNAGGNA. Both repeat regions were polymorphic in gene sequence and
size. Sequences coding for B-, T-CD4(+), and T-CD8(+) cell epitopes were found to
be conserved. This study confirms the high polymorphism of the repeat domain and 
the highly conserved nature of the flanking regions.
