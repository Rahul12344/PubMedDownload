P. falciparum causes the most deadly form of malaria, resulting from the
adherence of infected red blood cells to blood vessels. During the blood stage of
infection, the parasite secretes a large number of proteins into the host
erythrocyte. The secretion of a 20-member family of protein kinases known as FIKK
kinases, after a conserved Phe-Ile-Lys-Lys sequence motif, is unique to P.
falciparum. Identification of physiological substrates of these kinases may
provide perspective on the importance of FIKK kinase activity to P. falciparum
virulence. We demonstrate, for the first time, the heterologous expression and
purification of a FIKK kinase (PfFk4.1, PFD1165w). The recombinant kinase is
active against general substrates and phosphorylates itself. Having demonstrated 
kinase activity, we incubated recombinant Fk4.1 with parasite and human
erythrocyte lysates. No parasite-derived substrates were identified. However,
treatment of erythrocyte ghosts shows that the FIKK kinase Fk4.1 phosphorylates
dematin, a cytoskeletal protein found at the red blood cell spectrin-actin
junction.
