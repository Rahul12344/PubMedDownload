Plasmodium ovale curtisi and Plasmodium ovale wallikeri are two sympatric human
malaria species prevalent in Africa, Asia and Oceania. The reported prevalence of
both P. ovale spp. was relatively low compared to other malaria species, but more
sensitive molecular detection techniques have shown that asymptomatic low-density
infections are more common than previously thought. Whole genome sequencing of
both P. ovale spp. revealed genetic dissociation between P. ovale curtisi and P. 
ovale wallikeri suggesting a species barrier. In this study we further evaluate
such a barrier by assessing polymorphisms in the genes of three vaccine candidate
surface protein: circumsporozoite protein/ thrombospondin-related
anonymous-related protein (ctrp), circumsporozoite surface protein (csp) and
merozoite surface protein 1 (msp1). The complete coding sequence of ctrp and csp,
and a partial fragment of msp1 were isolated from 25 P. ovale isolates and
compared to previously reported reference sequences. A low level of nucleotide
diversity (Pi = 0.02-0.10) was observed in all three genes. Various sizes of
tandem repeats were observed in all ctrp, csp and msp1 genes. Both tandem repeat 
unit and nucleotide polymorphism in all three genes exhibited clear dimorphism
between P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri, supporting evidence of
non-recombination between these two species.
