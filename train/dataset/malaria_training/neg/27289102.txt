Plasmodium falciparum, the major cause of malaria morbidity and mortality
worldwide, is only distantly related to other human malaria parasites and has
thus been placed in a separate subgenus, termed Laverania Parasites
morphologically similar to P. falciparum have been identified in African apes,
but only one other Laverania species, Plasmodium reichenowi from chimpanzees, has
been formally described. Although recent studies have pointed to the existence of
additional Laverania species, their precise number and host associations remain
uncertain, primarily because of limited sampling and a paucity of parasite
sequences other than from mitochondrial DNA. To address this, we used limiting
dilution polymerase chain reaction to amplify additional parasite sequences from 
a large number of chimpanzee and gorilla blood and fecal samples collected at two
sanctuaries and 30 field sites across equatorial Africa. Phylogenetic analyses of
more than 2,000 new sequences derived from the mitochondrial, nuclear, and
apicoplast genomes revealed six divergent and well-supported clades within the
Laverania parasite group. Although two of these clades exhibited deep
subdivisions in phylogenies estimated from organelle gene sequences, these
sublineages were geographically defined and not present in trees from four
unlinked nuclear loci. This greatly expanded sequence data set thus confirms six,
and not seven or more, ape Laverania species, of which P. reichenowi, Plasmodium 
gaboni, and Plasmodium billcollinsi only infect chimpanzees, whereas Plasmodium
praefalciparum, Plasmodium adleri, and Pladmodium blacklocki only infect
gorillas. The new sequence data also confirm the P. praefalciparum origin of
human P. falciparum.
