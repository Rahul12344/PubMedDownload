We review here some recent data about Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD),
the housekeeping X-linked gene encoding the first enzyme of the pentose phosphate
pathway (PPP), a NADPH-producing dehydrogenase. This enzyme has been popular
among clinicians, biochemists, geneticists and molecular biologists because it is
the most common form of red blood cell enzymopathy. G6PD deficient erythrocytes
do not generate NADPH in any other way than through the PPP and for this reason
they are more susceptible than any other cells to oxidative damage. Moreover,
this enzyme has also been of crucial importance in many significant discoveries; 
indeed, G6PD polymorphisms have been instrumental in studying X-inactivation in
the human species, as well as in establishing the clonal nature of certain
tumors. G6PD deficiency, generally considered as a mild and benign condition, is 
significantly disadvantageous in certain environmental conditions like in
presence of certain drugs. Nevertheless, G6PD deficiency has been positively
selected by malaria, and recent knowledge seems to show that it also confers an
advantage against the development of cancer, reduces the risk of coronary
diseases and has a beneficial effect in terms of longevity.
