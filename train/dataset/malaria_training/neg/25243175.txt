Malaria parasites grow within vertebrate erythrocytes and increase host cell
permeability to access nutrients from plasma. This increase is mediated by the
plasmodial surface anion channel (PSAC), an unusual ion channel linked to the
conserved clag gene family. Although PSAC recognizes and transports a broad range
of uncharged and charged solutes, it must efficiently exclude the small Na(+) ion
to maintain infected cell osmotic stability. Here, we examine possible mechanisms
for this remarkable solute selectivity. We identify guanidinium as an organic
cation with high permeability into human erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium
falciparum, but negligible uptake by uninfected cells. Transport characteristics 
and pharmacology indicate that this uptake is specifically mediated by PSAC. The 
rank order of organic and inorganic cation permeabilities suggests cation
dehydration as the rate-limiting step in transport through the channel. The high 
guanidinium permeability of infected cells also allows rapid and stringent
synchronization of parasite cultures, as required for molecular and cellular
studies of this pathogen. These studies provide important insights into how
nutrients and ions are transported via PSAC, an established target for
antimalarial drug development.
