BACKGROUND: An accurate diagnosis is essential for the rapid and appropriate
treatment of malaria. The accuracy of the histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2)-based
rapid diagnostic test (RDT) Palutop+4® was assessed here. One possible factor
contributing to the failure to detect malaria by this test is the diversity of
the parasite PfHRP2 antigens.
METHODS: PfHRP2 detection with the Palutop+4® RDT was carried out. The pfhrp2 and
pfhrp3 genes were amplified and sequenced from 136 isolates of Plasmodium
falciparum that were collected in Dakar, Senegal from 2009 to 2011. The DNA
sequences were determined and statistical analyses of the variation observed
between these two genes were conducted. The potential impact of PfHRP2 and PfHRP3
sequence variation on malaria diagnosis was examined.
RESULTS: Seven P. falciparum isolates (5.9% of the total isolates, regardless of 
the parasitaemia; 10.7% of the isolates with parasitaemia ≤0.005% or ≤250
parasites/μl) were undetected by the PfHRP2 Palutop+4® RDT. Low parasite density 
is not sufficient to explain the PfHRP2 detection failure. Three of these seven
samples showed pfhrp2 deletion (2.4%). The pfhrp3 gene was deleted in 12.8%. Of
the 122 PfHRP2 sequences, 120 unique sequences were identified. Of the 109 PfHRP3
sequences, 64 unique sequences were identified. Using the Baker's regression
model, at least 7.4% of the P. falciparum isolates in Dakar were likely to be
undetected by PfHRP2 at a parasite density of ≤250 parasites/μl (slightly lower
than the evaluated prevalence of 10.7%). This predictive prevalence increased
significantly between 2009 and 2011 (P = 0.0046).
CONCLUSION: In the present work, 10.7% of the isolates with a parasitaemia
≤0.005% (≤250 parasites/μl) were undetected by the PfHRP2 Palutop+4® RDT (7.4% by
the predictive Baker'model). In addition, all of the parasites with pfhrp2
deletion (2.4% of the total samples) and 2.1% of the parasites with parasitaemia 
>0.005% and presence of pfhrp2 were not detected by PfHRP2 RDT. PfHRP2 is highly 
polymorphic in Senegal. Efforts should be made to more accurately determine the
prevalence of non-sensitive parasites to pfHRP2.
