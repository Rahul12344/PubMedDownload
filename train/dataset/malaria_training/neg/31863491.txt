Plasmodium falciparum has a limited repertoire of autophagy-related genes (ATGs),
and the functions of various proteins of the autophagy-like pathway are not fully
established in this protozoan parasite. Studies suggest that some of the
autophagy proteins are crucial for parasite growth. PfATG18, for example, is
essential for parasite replication and has a noncanonical role in apicoplast
biogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate the conserved functions of PfATG18 in
food vacuole (FV) dynamics and autophagy. Intriguingly, the P. falciparum FV is
found to undergo fission and fusion and PfATG18 gets enriched at the interfaces
of the newly generated multilobed FV during the process. In addition, expression 
of PfATG18 is induced upon starvation, both at the mRNA and protein level
indicating its participation in the autophagy-like pathway, which is independent 
of its role in apicoplast biogenesis. The study also shows that PfATG18 is
transported to the FV via the haemoglobin trafficking pathway. Overall, this
study establishes the conserved functions of Atg18 in this important
apicomplexan.
