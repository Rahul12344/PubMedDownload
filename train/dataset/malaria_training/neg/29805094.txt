The Plasmodium cell cycle, wherein millions of parasites differentiate and
proliferate, occurs in synchrony with the vertebrate host's circadian cycle. The 
underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we addressed this question in a mouse
model of Plasmodium chabaudi infection. Inflammatory gene expression and
carbohydrate metabolism are both enhanced in interferon-γ (IFNγ)-primed
leukocytes and liver cells from P. chabaudi-infected mice. Tumor necrosis factor 
α (TNFα) expression oscillates across the host circadian cycle, and increased
TNFα correlates with hypoglycemia and a higher frequency of non-replicative ring 
forms of trophozoites. Conversely, parasites proliferate and acquire biomass
during food intake by the host. Importantly, cyclic hypoglycemia is attenuated
and synchronization of P. chabaudi stages is disrupted in IFNγ-/-, TNF
receptor-/-, or diabetic mice. Hence, the daily rhythm of systemic TNFα
production and host food intake set the pace for Plasmodium synchronization with 
the host's circadian cycle. This mechanism indicates that Plasmodium parasites
take advantage of the host's feeding habits.
