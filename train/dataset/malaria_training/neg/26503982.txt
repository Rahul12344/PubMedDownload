BACKGROUND: It is becoming increasingly apparent that certain mutations in the
Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT) alter the
parasite's susceptibility to diverse compounds. Here we investigated the
interaction of PfCRT with 3 tricyclic compounds that have been used to treat
malaria (quinacrine [QC] and methylene blue [MB]) or to study P. falciparum
(acridine orange [AO]).
METHODS: We measured the antiplasmodial activities of QC, MB, and AO against
chloroquine-resistant and chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum and determined
whether QC and AO affect the accumulation and activity of chloroquine in these
parasites. We also assessed the ability of mutant (PfCRT(Dd2)) and wild-type
(PfCRT(D10)) variants of the protein to transport QC, MB, and AO when expressed
at the surface of Xenopus laevis oocytes.
RESULTS: Chloroquine resistance-conferring isoforms of PfCRT reduced the
susceptibility of the parasite to QC, MB, and AO. In chloroquine-resistant (but
not chloroquine-sensitive) parasites, AO and QC increased the parasite's
accumulation of, and susceptibility to, chloroquine. All 3 compounds were shown
to bind to PfCRT(Dd2), and the transport of QC and MB via this protein was
saturable and inhibited by the chloroquine resistance-reverser verapamil.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that the PfCRT(Dd2)-mediated transport of
tricyclic antimalarials reduces the parasite's susceptibility to these drugs.
