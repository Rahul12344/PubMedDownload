BACKGROUND: Fulani are a widely spread African ethnic group characterized by
lower susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum, clinical malaria morbidity and
higher rate of lactase persistence compared to sympatric tribes. Lactase
non-persistence, often called lactose intolerance, is the normal condition where 
lactase activity in the intestinal wall declines after weaning. Lactase
persistence, common in Europe, and in certain African people with traditions of
raising cattle, is caused by polymorphisms in the enhancer region approximately
14 kb upstream of the lactase gene.
METHODS: To evaluate the relationship between malaria and lactase persistence
genotypes, a 400 bp region surrounding the main European C/T-13910 polymorphism
upstream of the lactase gene was sequenced. DNA samples used in the study
originated from 162 Fulani and 79 Dogon individuals from Mali.
RESULTS: Among 79 Dogon only one heterozygote of the lactase enhancer
polymorphism was detected, whereas all others were homozygous for the ancestral C
allele. Among the Fulani, the main European polymorphism at locus C/T-13910 was
by far the most common polymorphism, with an allele frequency of 37%. Three other
single-nucleotide polymorphisms were found with allele frequencies of 3.7%, 1.9% 
and 0.6% each. The novel DNA polymorphism T/C-13906 was seen in six heterozygous 
Fulani. Among the Fulani with lactase non-persistence CC genotypes at the
C/T-13910 locus, 24% had malaria parasites detectable by microscopy compared to
18% for lactase persistent genotypes (P = 0.29). Pooling the lactase enhancer
polymorphisms to a common presumptive genotype gave 28% microscopy positives for 
non-persistent and 17% for others (P = 0.11).
CONCLUSIONS: Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia in asymptomatic Fulani is more
common in individuals with lactase non-persistence genotypes, but this difference
is not statistically significant. The potential immunoprotective properties of
dietary cow milk as a reason for the partial malaria resistance of Fulani warrant
further investigation.
