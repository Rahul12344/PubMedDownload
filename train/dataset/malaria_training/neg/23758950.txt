BACKGROUND: Most rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) currently used for malaria
diagnosis cannot distinguish the various Plasmodium infections. The development
of a Plasmodium vivax specific RDTs with high sensitivity to sufficiently
differentiate the two most common Plasmodium infections would be very crucial for
disease treatment and control.
METHOD: Plasmodium vivax aldolase gene (PvALDO) was amplified from the extracted 
genomic DNA and constructed into pET30a vector. Plasmodium vivax aldolase protein
was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli in soluble form and the overall
purity was over 95% after one-step affinity chromatography purification. The
purified products were used for the immunization of mice and rabbits. Rabbit
polyclonal antibodies generated were deployed to develop a novel antibody-capture
ELISA for hybridoma screening.
RESULTS: Three PvALDO specific mAbs (14C7, 15F1 and 5H7) with high affinities
were selected and used in immunochromatographic test strips. Clinical blood
samples (n=190) collected from Yunnan (China) were used for evaluation and the
RDT's sensitivity for P. vivax was 98.33% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 91.03%
to 99.72%) compared with microscopic examination. There was specificity of 99.23%
(95% CI: 95.77% to 99.87%) for P. vivax. Only one Plasmodium falciparum sample
was detected among the P. falciparum samples (n=20). All Plasmodium malariae
samples (n=2) as well as healthy uninfected samples (n=108) were negative.
Overall performance of this RDT was excellent with positive predictive value
(PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 98.33% and 99.23%, respectively, at 
95% CI and a very good correlation with microscopic observations (kappa value,
K=0.9757). Test strips show high sensitivity even at 6.25 ng/ml of recombinant P.
vivax aldolase (rPvALDO).
CONCLUSION: This study further elucidates the possibility of developing
aldolase-specific RDTs which can differentiate the different Plasmodium
infections and improve accurate diagnosis of malaria. This RDT could adequately
differentiate between P. vivax and P. falciparum infections. The novel mAb
screening method developed here could find application in the screening of highly
specific antibodies against other antigens.
