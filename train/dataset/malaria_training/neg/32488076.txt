Malaria parasites complete their intra-erythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC) in 
multiples of 24 h suggesting a circadian basis, but the mechanism controlling
this periodicity is unknown. Combining in vivo and in vitro approaches utilizing 
rodent and human malaria parasites, we reveal that: (i) 57% of Plasmodium
chabaudi genes exhibit daily rhythms in transcription; (ii) 58% of these genes
lose transcriptional rhythmicity when the IDC is out-of-synchrony with host
rhythms; (iii) 6% of Plasmodium falciparum genes show 24 h rhythms in expression 
under free-running conditions; (iv) Serpentine receptor 10 (SR10) has a 24 h
transcriptional rhythm and disrupting it in rodent malaria parasites shortens the
IDC by 2-3 h; (v) Multiple processes including DNA replication, and the ubiquitin
and proteasome pathways, are affected by loss of coordination with host rhythms
and by disruption of SR10. Our results reveal malaria parasites are at least
partly responsible for scheduling the IDC and coordinating their development with
host daily rhythms.
