Plasmodium vivax malaria caused is a public health problem that produces very
high morbidity worldwide. During invasion of red blood cells the parasite
requires the intervention of high molecular weight complex rhoptry proteins that 
are also essential for cytoadherence. PfClag9, a member of the RhopH multigene
family, has been identified as being critical during Plasmodium falciparum
infection. This study describes identifying and characterizing the pfclag9
ortholog in P. vivax (hereinafter named pvclag7). The pvclag7 gene is transcribed
at the end of the intraerythrocytic cycle and is recognized by sera from humans
who have been infected by P. vivax. PvClag7 subcellular localization has been
also determined and, similar to what occurs with PfClag9, it co-localize with
other proteins from the Rhoptry high molecular weight complex.
