We cared for a term female newborn, who at 108 hours of age, with a total serum
bilirubin of 15.4 mg/dL, was discharged from the hospital on home phototherapy.
At a return appointment 44 hours later, her total serum bilirubin was 41.7 mg/dL 
and signs of acute kernicterus were present. Maternal/fetal blood group O/B
incompatibility was identified, with a negative direct antiglobulin test, which
was positive on retesting. She had abundant spherocytes on blood smear, and these
persisted at follow-up, but neither parent had spherocytes identified. A
heterozygous SLC4A1(E508K) mutation (gene encoding erythrocyte membrane protein
band 3) was found, and in silico predicted to result in damaged erythrocyte
cytoskeletal protein function. No mutations were identified in other red cell
cytoskeleton genes (ANK1, SPTA1, SPTB, EPB41, EPB42) and the UGT1A1 promoter
region was normal. Neurologic follow-up at 2 and 4 months showed developmental
delays consistent with mild kernicterus.
