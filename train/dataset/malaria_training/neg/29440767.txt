Metabolic resistance to pyrethroid insecticides is widespread in Anopheles
mosquitoes and is a major threat to malaria control. DNA markers would aid
predictive monitoring of resistance, but few mutations have been discovered
outside of insecticide-targeted genes. Isofemale family pools from a wild Ugandan
Anopheles gambiae population, from an area where operational pyrethroid failure
is suspected, were genotyped using a candidate-gene enriched SNP array.
Resistance-associated SNPs were detected in three genes from detoxification
superfamilies, in addition to the insecticide target site (the Voltage Gated
Sodium Channel gene, Vgsc). The putative associations were confirmed for two of
the marker SNPs, in the P450 Cyp4j5 and the esterase Coeae1d by reproducible
association with pyrethroid resistance in multiple field collections from Uganda 
and Kenya, and together with the Vgsc-1014S (kdr) mutation these SNPs explained
around 20% of variation in resistance. Moreover, the >20 Mb 2La inversion also
showed evidence of association with resistance as did environmental humidity.
Sequencing of Cyp4j5 and Coeae1d detected no resistance-linked loss of diversity,
suggesting selection from standing variation. Our study provides novel,
regionally-validated DNA assays for resistance to the most important insecticide 
class, and establishes both 2La karyotype variation and humidity as common
factors impacting the resistance phenotype.
