Plasmodium knowlesi, a malaria parasite of macaques, has emerged as an important 
parasite of humans. Despite the significance of P. knowlesi malaria in parts of
Southeast Asia, very little is known about the genetic variation in this
parasite. Our aim here was to explore sequence variation in a molecule called the
42kDa merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1), which is found on the surface of blood
stages of Plasmodium spp. and plays a key role in erythrocyte invasion. Several
studies of P. falciparum have reported that the C-terminus (a 42kDa fragment) of 
merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-142; consisting of MSP-119 and MSP-133) is a
potential candidate for a malaria vaccine. However, to date, no study has yet
investigated the sequence diversity of the gene encoding P. knowlesi MSP-142
(comprising Pk-msp-119 and Pk-msp-133) among isolates in Malaysia. The present
study explored this aspect. Twelve P. knowlesi isolates were collected from
patients from hospitals in Selangor and Sabah Borneo, Malaysia, between 2012 and 
2014. The Pk-msp-142 gene was amplified by PCR and directly sequenced. Haplotype 
diversity (Hd) and nucleotide diversity (л) were studied among the isolates.
There was relatively high genetic variation among P. knowlesi isolates; overall
Hd and л were 1±0.034 and 0.01132±0.00124, respectively. A total of nine
different haplotypes related to amino acid alterations at 13 positions, and the
Pk-MSP-119 sequence was found to be more conserved than Pk-msp-133. We have found
evidence for negative selection in Pk-msp-42 as well as the 33kDa and 19kDa
fragments by comparing the rate of non-synonymous versus synonymous
substitutions. Future investigations should study large numbers of samples from
disparate geographical locations to critically assess whether this molecule might
be a potential vaccine target for P. knowlesi.
