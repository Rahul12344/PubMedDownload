OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the expression pattern and function of
Nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group E member 1 (Nr2e1) in retinoic acid
(RA)-induced brain abnormality.
METHODS: The mouse model of brain abnormality was established by administering 28
mg/kg RA, and neural stem cells (NSCs) were isolated from the mouse embryo and
cultured in vitro. Nr2e1 expression was detected by whole mount in situ
hybridization, RT-PCR, and Western blotting. Nr2e1 function was determined by
transducing Nr2e1 shRNA into NSCs, and the effect on the sonic hedgehog (Shh)
signaling pathway was assessed in the cells. In addition, the regulation of Nr2e1
expression by RA was also determined in vitro.
RESULTS: Nr2e1 expression was significantly downregulated in the brain and NSCs
of RA-treated mouse embryos, and knockdown of Nr2e1 affected the proliferation of
NSCs in vitro. In addition, a similar expression pattern of Nr2e1 and RA receptor
(RAR) α was observed after treatment of NSCs with different concentrations of RA.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that Nr2e1 could be regulated by RA, which
would aid a better understanding of the mechanism underlying RA-induced brain
abnormality.
