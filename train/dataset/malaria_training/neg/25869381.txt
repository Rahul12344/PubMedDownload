tRNA modifications play an important role in the proper folding of tRNA and
thereby determine its functionality as an adaptor molecule. Notwithstanding the
centrality of this basic process in translation, a major gap in the genomics of
Plasmodium falciparum is unambiguous identification of enzymes catalysing the
various tRNA modifications. In this study, tRNA-modifying enzymes of P.
falciparum were annotated using homology-based approach. Based on the presence of
these identified enzymes, the modifications were compared with those of
prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Through sequence comparison and
phylogenetic analysis, we have identified P. falciparum apicoplast tRNA-guanine
34 transglycosylase (TGT, EC: 2.4.2.29), which shows evidence of its prokaryotic 
origin. The docking analysis of the modelled TGT structures revealed that binding
of quinazolinone derivatives is more favourable with P. falciparum apicoplast TGT
as compared to human TGT. Molecular dynamic simulation and molecular
mechanics/generalized Born surface area analysis of the complex confirmed the
greater binding affinity of the ligand in the binding pocket of P. falciparum TGT
protein. Further, evolutionary patterning analysis identified the amino acids of 
P. falciparum apicoplast TGT that are under purifying selection pressure and
hence can be good inhibitor-targeting sites. Based on these computational
studies, we suggest that P. falciparum apicoplast tRNA-guanine 34
transglycosylase can be a promising drug target.
