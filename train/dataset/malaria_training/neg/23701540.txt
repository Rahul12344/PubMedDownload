RNA interference (RNAi) has quickly proven to be an immensely useful tool for
studying gene function and validation of potential drug targets in almost all
organisms that possess the required set of proteins of the interference pathway. 
In protozoan parasites like Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, Entamoeba, Giardia,
Trypanosoma, and Leishmania, this set of enzymes is represented divergently.
Hitherto, no RNAi-related genes like Dicer and Argonaute have been identified in 
Plasmodium and Leishmania species, respectively. However, non-canonical
RNAi-related pathways might be present in both parasites, as it has been recently
demonstrated in Plasmodium. In this review, we discuss existing challenges and
future directions for developing RNAi as a tool for studying gene function and as
a possible clinical application against Plasmodium.
