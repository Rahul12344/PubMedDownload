BACKGROUND: Malaria remains as a major global problem, being one of the
infectious diseases that engender highest mortality across the world. Due to the 
appearance of resistance and the lack of an effective vaccine, the search of
novel anti-malarials is required. Deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate
nucleotido-hydrolase (dUTPase) is responsible for the hydrolysis of dUTP to dUMP 
within the parasite and has been proposed as an essential step in pyrimidine
metabolism by providing dUMP for thymidylate biosynthesis. In this work, efforts 
to validate dUTPase as a drug target in Plasmodium falciparum are reported.
METHODS: To investigate the role of PfdUTPase in cell survival different
strategies to generate knockout mutants were used. For validation of PfdUTPase as
the intracellular target of four inhibitors of the enzyme, mutants overexpressing
PfdUTPase and HsdUTPase were created and the IC50 for each cell line with each
compound was determined. The effect of these compounds on dUTP and dTTP levels
from P. falciparum was measured using a DNA polymerase assay. Detailed
localization studies by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and live cell
imaging were also performed using a cell line overexpressing a Pfdut-GFP fusion
protein.
RESULTS: Different attempts of disruption of the dut gene of P. falciparum were
unsuccessful while a 3' replacement construct could recombine correctly in the
locus suggesting that the enzyme is essential. The four 5'-tritylated
deoxyuridine analogues described are potent inhibitors of the P. falciparum
dUTPase and exhibit antiplasmodial activity. Overexpression of the Plasmodium and
human enzymes conferred resistance against selective compounds, providing
chemical validation of the target and confirming that indeed dUTPase inhibition
is involved in anti-malarial activity. In addition, incubation with these
inhibitors was associated with a depletion of the dTTP pool corroborating the
central role of dUTPase in dTTP synthesis. PfdUTPase is mainly localized in the
cytosol.
CONCLUSION: These results strongly confirm the pivotal and essential role of
dUTPase in pyrimidine biosynthesis of P. falciparum intraerythrocytic stages.
