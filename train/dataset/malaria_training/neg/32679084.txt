BACKGROUND: The Greater Mekong subregion is a recurrent source of antimalarial
drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum malaria. This study aimed to
characterise the extent and spread of resistance across this entire region
between 2007 and 2018.
METHODS: P falciparum isolates from Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia were
obtained from clinical trials and epidemiological studies done between Jan 1,
2007, and Dec 31, 2018, and were genotyped for molecular markers (pfkelch, pfcrt,
pfplasmepsin2, and pfmdr1) of antimalarial drug resistance. Genetic relatedness
was assessed using microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism typing of
flanking sequences around target genes.
FINDINGS: 10 632 isolates were genotyped. A single long pfkelch Cys580Tyr
haplotype (from -50 kb to +31·5 kb) conferring artemisinin resistance (PfPailin) 
now dominates across the eastern Greater Mekong subregion. Piperaquine resistance
associated with pfplasmepsin2 gene amplification and mutations in pfcrt
downstream of the Lys76Thr chloroquine resistance locus has also developed. On
the Thailand-Myanmar border a different pfkelch Cys580Tyr lineage rose to high
frequencies before it was eliminated. Elsewhere in Myanmar the Cys580Tyr allele
remains widespread at low allele frequencies. Meanwhile a single
artemisinin-resistant pfkelch Phe446Ile haplotype has spread across Myanmar.
Despite intense use of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in Kayin state, eastern
Myanmar, both in treatment and mass drug administrations, no selection of
piperaquine resistance markers was observed. pfmdr1 amplification, a marker of
resistance to mefloquine, remains at low prevalence across the entire region.
INTERPRETATION: Artemisinin resistance in P falciparum is now prevalent across
the Greater Mekong subregion. In the eastern Greater Mekong subregion a multidrug
resistant P falciparum lineage (PfPailin) dominates. In Myanmar a long pfkelch
Phe446Ile haplotype has spread widely but, by contrast with the eastern Greater
Mekong subregion, there is no indication of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT)
partner drug resistance from genotyping known markers, and no evidence of spread 
of ACT resistant P falciparum from the east to the west. There is still a window 
of opportunity to prevent global spread of ACT resistance.
