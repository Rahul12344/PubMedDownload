T-protein, an aminomethyltransferase, represents one of the four components of
glycine cleavage system (GCS) and catalyzes the transfer of methylene group from 
H-protein intermediate to tetrahydrofolate (THF) forming N(5), N(10)-methylene
THF (CH2-THF) with the release of ammonia. The malaria parasite genome encodes
T-, H- and L-proteins, but not P-protein which is a glycine decarboxylase
generating the aminomethylene group. A putative GCS has been considered to be
functional in the parasite mitochondrion despite the absence of a detectable
P-protein homologue. In the present study, the mitochondrial localization of
T-protein in the malaria parasite was confirmed by immunofluorescence and its
essentiality in the entire parasite life cycle was studied by targeting the
T-protein locus in Plasmodium berghei (Pb). PbT knock out parasites did not show 
any growth defect in asexual, sexual and liver stages indicating that the
T-protein is dispensable for parasite survival in vertebrate and invertebrate
hosts. The absence of P-protein homologue and the non-essentiality of T protein
suggest the possible redundancy of GCS activity in the malaria parasite.
Nevertheless, the H- and L-proteins of GCS could be essential for malaria
parasite because of their involvement in α-ketoacid dehydrogenase reactions.
