The recent emergence of artemisinin resistance in the Greater Mekong Subregion
poses a major threat to the global effort to control malaria. Tracking the spread
and evolution of artemisinin-resistant parasites is critical in aiding efforts to
contain the spread of resistance. A total of 417 patient samples from the year
2007, collected during malaria surveillance studies across ten provinces in
Thailand, were genotyped for the candidate Plasmodium falciparum molecular marker
of artemisinin resistance K13. Parasite genotypes were examined for K13 propeller
mutations associated with artemisinin resistance, signatures of positive
selection, and for evidence of whether artemisinin-resistant alleles arose
independently across Thailand. A total of seven K13 mutant alleles were found
(N458Y, R539T, E556D, P574L, R575K, C580Y, S621F). Notably, the R575K and S621F
mutations have previously not been reported in Thailand. The most prevalent
artemisinin resistance-associated K13 mutation, C580Y, carried two distinct
haplotype profiles that were separated based on geography, along the
Thai-Cambodia and Thai-Myanmar borders. It appears these two haplotypes may have 
independent evolutionary origins. In summary, parasites with K13 propeller
mutations associated with artemisinin resistance were widely present along the
Thai-Cambodia and Thai-Myanmar borders prior to the implementation of the
artemisinin resistance containment project in the region.
