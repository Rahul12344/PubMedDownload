BACKGROUND: Pakistan has an estimated annual burden of 1.5 million malaria cases.
The current situation calls for an effective malaria control and eradication
programme in this country. Currently, primaquine is an attractive option for
eliminating reservoirs of Plasmodium vivax hypnozoites and killing gametocytes of
Plasmodium falciparum. However, this drug causes haemolysis in individuals who
are glucose-6-phosphate (G6PD) deficient. It is important to map G6PD deficiency 
and malaria distribution in Pakistan to design an effective malaria eradication
regimen. Frequency of G6PD deficiency (G6PDd) in malaria patients has not been
reported from Pakistan in any meaningful way. The purpose of this study was to
evaluate the frequency of G6PD c.563C>T (G6PD Mediterranean) in male individuals 
with and without falciparum malaria.
METHODS: Two hundred and ten archived DNA samples from males (110 from falciparum
malaria patients and 100 from healthy individuals) were utilized in this study.
Healthy blood donors were selected based on stringent pre-defined criteria.
Patients were confirmed for malaria parasites on microscopy and or immune
chromatographic assay detecting P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2.
Parasitaemia was also computed. DNA samples were tested for G6PD c.563C>T
mutation through PCR-RFLP according to the previously defined protocol and its
allelic frequency was computed.
RESULTS: G6PD c.563C>T was observed in four of 110 patients with falciparum
malaria and in two of 100 healthy donors. Mean (± SD) haemoglobin, median (IQR)
platelet and median (IQR) parasite count in G6PD-deficient malaria-patients were 
8.9 ± 0.9 g/dL, 124 × 109/L (IQR 32, 171) and 57,920/μL of blood (IQR 12,920,
540,000) respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative allelic frequency for G6PD 563c.C>T was 0.0285 detected
in 6 of 210 X-chromosomes in Southern Pakistan. Frequency for this G6PD allele
was 0.0364 in malaria-patients and 0.0200 in healthy individuals. Large studies
including females are needed to elucidate the true burden of G6PDd in
malaria-endemic areas. The information will enable local health policy makers to 
design effective strategies for eliminating malaria form this region.
