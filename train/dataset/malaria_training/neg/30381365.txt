Cancer and malaria exemplify two maladies historically assigned to separated
research spaces. Cancer, on the one hand, ranks among the top priorities in the
research agenda of developed countries. Its rise is mostly explained by the
ageing of these populations and linked to environment and lifestyle. Malaria, on 
the other hand, represents a major health burden for developing countries in the 
Southern Hemisphere. These two diseases also belong to separate fields of
medicine: non-communicable diseases for cancer and communicable diseases for
malaria.
