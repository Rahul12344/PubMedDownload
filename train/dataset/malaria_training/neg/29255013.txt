The spread of blood-borne pathogens by mosquitoes relies on their taking a blood 
meal; if there is no bite, there is no disease transmission. Although many
species of mosquitoes never take a blood meal, identifying genes that distinguish
blood feeding from obligate nonbiting is hampered by the fact that these
different lifestyles occur in separate, genetically incompatible species. There
is, however, one unique extant species with populations that share a common
genetic background but blood feed in one region and are obligate nonbiters in the
rest of their range: Wyeomyia smithii Contemporary blood-feeding and obligate
nonbiting populations represent end points of divergence between fully
interfertile southern and northern populations. This divergence has undoubtedly
resulted in genetic changes that are unrelated to blood feeding, and the
challenge is to winnow out the unrelated genetic factors to identify those
related specifically to the evolutionary transition from blood feeding to
obligate nonbiting. Herein, we determine differential gene expression resulting
from directional selection on blood feeding within a polymorphic population to
isolate genetic differences between blood feeding and obligate nonbiting. We show
that the evolution of nonbiting has resulted in a greatly reduced metabolic
investment compared with biting populations, a greater reliance on opportunistic 
metabolic pathways, and greater reliance on visual rather than olfactory sensory 
input. W. smithii provides a unique starting point to determine if there are
universal nonbiting genes in mosquitoes that could be manipulated as a means to
control vector-borne disease.
