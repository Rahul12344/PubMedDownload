Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent agent of human malaria, shares a recent 
common ancestor with the gorilla parasite Plasmodium praefalciparum. Little is
known about the other gorilla- and chimpanzee-infecting species in the same
(Laverania) subgenus as P. falciparum, but none of them are capable of
establishing repeated infection and transmission in humans. To elucidate
underlying mechanisms and the evolutionary history of this subgenus, we have
generated multiple genomes from all known Laverania species. The completeness of 
our dataset allows us to conclude that interspecific gene transfers, as well as
convergent evolution, were important in the evolution of these species. Striking 
copy number and structural variations were observed within gene families and one,
stevor, shows a host-specific sequence pattern. The complete genome sequence of
the closest ancestor of P. falciparum enables us to estimate the timing of the
beginning of speciation to be 40,000-60,000 years ago followed by a population
bottleneck around 4,000-6,000 years ago. Our data allow us also to search in
detail for the features of P. falciparum that made it the only member of the
Laverania able to infect and spread in humans.
