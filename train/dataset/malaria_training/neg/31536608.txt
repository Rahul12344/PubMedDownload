Plasmodium relapses are attributed to the activation of dormant liver-stage
parasites and are responsible for a significant number of recurring malaria
blood-stage infections. While characteristic of human infections caused by P.
vivax and P. ovale, their relative contribution to malaria disease burden and
transmission remains poorly understood. This is largely because it is difficult
to identify 'bona fide' relapse infections due to ongoing transmission in most
endemic areas. Here, we use the P. cynomolgi-rhesus macaque model of relapsing
malaria to demonstrate that clinical immunity can form after a single
sporozoite-initiated blood-stage infection and prevent illness during relapses
and homologous reinfections. By integrating data from whole blood RNA-sequencing,
flow cytometry, P. cynomolgi-specific ELISAs, and opsonic phagocytosis assays, we
demonstrate that this immunity is associated with a rapid recall response by
memory B cells that expand and produce anti-parasite IgG1 that can mediate
parasite clearance of relapsing parasites. The reduction in parasitemia during
relapses was mirrored by a reduction in the total number of circulating
gametocytes, but importantly, the cumulative proportion of gametocytes increased 
during relapses. Overall, this study reveals that P. cynomolgi relapse infections
can be clinically silent in macaques due to rapid memory B cell responses that
help to clear asexual-stage parasites but still carry gametocytes.
