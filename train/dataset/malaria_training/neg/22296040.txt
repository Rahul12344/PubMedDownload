OBJECTIVE: To determine the expression of Pfg377 ortholog gene in Plasmodium
vivax, and examine its correlation with mosquito infection.
METHODS: Seventy clinical blood samples positive for P. vivax by microscopy, were
used for the mosquito infectivity assay. Infectivity to female Anopheles dirus
was determined from oocyst counts. The transcripts of Pfg377 ortholog gene of P. 
vivax from blood samples infective and non-infective to mosquitoes were examined 
using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR).
RESULTS: Of 70 P. vivax positive blood samples, 50 (71.4%) samples were
mosquito-infective and 20 (28.6%) were not. In infective samples, the expression 
level of Pfg377 ortholog gene was significantly higher than in the non-infective 
group (P<0.05). In infective samples, the expression level of Pfg377 ortholog
gene at ≥100 copies/ml of blood cut-off point correlated with ≥10
oocysts/mosquito cut-off point of average oocyst numbers and with ≥50% cut-off
point of per cent infected mosquitoes (Pearson's chi-square correlation, P=0.014 
and P=0.026, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The cut-off point of the expression level of Pfg377 ortholog gene
could be used to predict the infectiousness of P. vivax gametocytes leading to
mosquito infection and parasite transmission in the field.
