Cytokinins are plant hormones that are involved in regulation of cell
proliferation, cell cycle progression, and cell and plastid development. Here, we
show that the apicomplexan parasites Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium berghei, an
opportunistic human pathogen and a rodent malaria agent, respectively, produce
cytokinins via a biosynthetic pathway similar to that in plants. Cytokinins
regulate the growth and cell cycle progression of T. gondii by mediating
expression of the cyclin gene TgCYC4. A natural form of cytokinin, trans-zeatin
(t-zeatin), upregulated expression of this cyclin, while a synthetic cytokinin,
thidiazuron, downregulated its expression. Immunofluorescence microscopy and
quantitative PCR analysis showed that t-zeatin increased the genome-copy number
of apicoplast, which are non-photosynthetic plastid, in the parasite, while
thidiazuron led to their disappearance. Thidiazuron inhibited growth of T. gondii
and Plasmodium falciparum, a human malaria parasite, suggesting that thidiazuron 
has therapeutic potential as an inhibitor of apicomplexan parasites.
