Malaria parasites harbour two organelles with bacteria-like metabolic processes
that are the targets of many anti-bacterial drugs. One such drug is fusidic acid,
which inhibits the translation component elongation factor G. The response of P. 
falciparum to fusidic acid was characterised using extended SYBR-Green based drug
trials. This revealed that fusidic acid kills in vitro cultured P. falciparum
parasites by immediately blocking parasite development. Two bacterial-type
protein translation elongation factor G genes are identified as likely targets of
fusidic acid. Sequence analysis suggests that these proteins function in the
mitochondria and apicoplast and both should be sensitive to fusidic acid.
Microscopic examination of protein-reporter fusions confirm the prediction that
one elongation factor G is a component of parasite mitochondria whereas the
second is a component of the relict plastid or apicoplast. The presence of two
putative targets for a single inhibitory compound emphasizes the potential of
elongation factor G as a drug target in malaria.
