Nested PCR method was used to amplify the Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface
protein 1 (PvMSP-1) gene fragment containing the ICB5 and ICB6 region from
Plasmodium vivax in Liaoning Province. The PCR products were digested by Pvu II
restriction endonuclease and the digested fragments were observed by 1.5% agarose
gel electrophoresis, and all followed by sequencing analysis and comparison. In
11 field isolates of P. vivax, two kinds of DNA fragments with 470 and 400 bp
were produced respectively. After PvuII digestion, two Sal-1 type fragments (120 
and 350 bp) were obtained from 5 samples of 470 bp. Single band of 400 bp
appeared in 1 samples as Belem type. Two bands of 120 and 280 bp appeared from
another 1 sample as recombination type III, and other 4 bands with 120 and 240 bp
as Korean isolate. The principal types of PvMSP-1 alleles exist in malaria
endemic areas in Liaoning Province with no mixed infection of two different type 
alleles.
