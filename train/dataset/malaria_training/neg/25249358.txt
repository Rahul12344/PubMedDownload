BACKGROUND: Studies showed that chloroquine resistance may revert to sensitivity 
after its withdrawal mainly detected by a significant decrease of Plasmodium
falciparum pfcrt 76T and pfmdr1 86Y alleles. Besides, self-medication is
considered as a key factor of antimalarial drug resistance expansion. Thus, pfcrt
76T and pfmdr1 86Y allele frequency and its relationship with antimalarial drug
self-medication was analyzed in P. falciparum isolates collected in Gabon.
METHODS: Samples were collected from febrile children screened for P. falciparum 
infection in 2005 and 2008 at the regional hospital of Oyem. Self-use of
antimalarial drugs before the day of consultation was recorded. Polymorphic
codons 76 and 86 of pfcrt and pfmdr1 genes were analyzed by PCR-RFLP.
RESULTS: The frequency of pfcrt 76T mutant allele was greater than 70.0% in 2005 
and 2008. Wild type isolates were 1.7-fold more prevalent in 2008. The prevalence
of pfmdr1 86Y mutant allele was comparable between 2005 and 2008 (p=0.1); the
proportion of wild type allele reached 20.5% in 2008. The frequency of wild type 
allele pfcrt K76 or pfmdr1 N86 was higher among patients without anti-malarial
drug self-medication compared to those who used it.
CONCLUSIONS: An increase of the frequency of P. falciparum wild type allele pfcrt
76K and pfmdr1 86N was observed within a short period after chloroquine
withdrawal. The proportion of mutant genotypes is still high, mainly among
patients using self-medication with antimalarial drugs.
