BACKGROUND: Blood meal host selection by mosquito vectors is an important
component in understanding disease dynamics of pathogens that threaten endemic
fauna in isolated islands such as Galápagos. Research on the feeding behavior of 
mosquitoes can provide clues to the hosts and vectors involved in disease
transmission. This information is particularly critical for endemic wildlife
fauna in island systems that have evolved without resistance to novel diseases
such as avian malaria. The aims of this study were to determine the blood-feeding
patterns of two species of mosquitoes found in Galápagos and discuss how their
feeding behavior may influence the transmission of pathogens such as avian
malaria.
METHODS: In the summer of 2015, we sampled two mosquito species (Aedes
taeniorhynchus and Culex quinquefasciatus) across 18 different sites on Isla
Santa Cruz, which is the second largest island in Galápagos and has the largest
human population. We trapped mosquitoes using CDC light traps and CDC gravid
traps and identified sources of blood meals for engorged mosquitoes by sequencing
a portion of the vertebrate mitochondrial cytochrome b gene.
RESULTS: Out of 947 female mosquitoes captured, 320 were blood-fed, and PCR
amplifications were successful for 301 of the blood meals. Results revealed that 
both Aedes taeniorhynchus and Culex quinquefasciatus feed from a variety of
vertebrate taxa, numerically dominated by humans on Isla Santa Cruz.
CONCLUSIONS: The high proportion of mammalian blood meals could represent locally
available and abundant hosts on Santa Cruz. However, host surveys and estimates
of relative abundances of vertebrate species will need to accompany mosquito
trapping studies on non-inhabited and inhabited islands in Galápagos to further
validate this.
