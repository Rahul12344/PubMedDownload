Pathogenesis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) was a mystery for over 
half a century until the discovery of ADAMTS13. ADAMTS13 is primarily synthesized
in the liver, and its main function is to cleave von Willebrand factor (VWF)
anchored on the endothelial surface, in circulation, and at the sites of vascular
injury. Deficiency of plasma ADAMTS13 activity (<10%) resulting from mutations of
the ADAMTS13 gene or autoantibodies against ADAMTS13 causes hereditary or
acquired (idiopathic) TTP. ADAMTS13 activity is usually normal or modestly
reduced (>20%) in other forms of thrombotic microangiopathy secondary to
hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation, infection, and disseminated
malignancy or in hemolytic uremic syndrome. Plasma infusion or exchange remains
the initial treatment of choice to date, but novel therapeutics such as
recombinant ADAMTS13 and gene therapy are under development. Moreover, ADAMTS13
deficiency has been shown to be a risk factor for the development of myocardial
infarction, stroke, cerebral malaria, and preeclampsia.
