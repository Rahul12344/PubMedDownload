Malaria merozoite apical organelles; microneme and rhoptry secreted proteins play
functional roles during and following invasion of host erythrocytes. Among
numerous proteins, the rhoptries discharge high molecular weight proteins known
as RhopH complex. Recent reports suggest that the RhopH complex is essential for 
growth and survival of the malaria parasite within erythrocytes. However, an
in-depth understanding of the host-parasite molecular interactions is
indispensable. Here we utilized a comprehensive mouse erythrocyte protein library
consisting of 443 proteins produced by a wheat germ cell-free system, combined
with AlphaScreen technology to identify mouse erythrocyte calmyrin as an
interacting molecule of the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii RhopH
complex (PyRhopH). The PyRhopH interaction was dependent on the calmyrin
N-terminus and divalent cation capacity. The finding unveils a recommendable and 
invaluable usefulness of our comprehensive mouse erythrocyte protein library
together with the AlphaScreen technology in investigating a wide-range of
host-parasite molecular interactions.
