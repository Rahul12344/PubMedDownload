Developing anti-parasitic lead compounds that act on key vulnerabilities are
necessary for new anti-infectives. Malaria, leishmaniasis, toxoplasmosis,
cryptosporidiosis and coccidiosis together kill >500,000 humans annually. Their
causative parasites Plasmodium, Leishmania, Toxoplasma, Cryptosporidium and
Eimeria display high conservation in many housekeeping genes, suggesting that
these parasites can be attacked by targeting invariant essential proteins. Here, 
we describe selective and potent inhibition of prolyl-tRNA synthetases (PRSs)
from the above parasites using a series of quinazolinone-scaffold compounds.
Our PRS-drug co-crystal structures reveal remarkable active site plasticity that 
accommodates diversely substituted compounds, an enzymatic feature that can be
leveraged for refining drug-like properties of quinazolinones on a per parasite
basis. A compound we termed In-5 exhibited a unique double conformation, enhanced
drug-like properties, and cleared malaria in mice. It thus represents a new lead 
for optimization. Collectively, our data offer insights into the structure-guided
optimization of quinazolinone-based compounds for drug development against
multiple human eukaryotic pathogens.
