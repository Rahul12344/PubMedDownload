In the cytoplasm of Plasmodium falciparum, two peroxiredoxins: PfTPx-1 and
Pf1-Cys-Prx, are expressed at different time-points of the parasite cell cycle
during the intraerythrocytic stage. In the present study, to gain insight into
the functions of Prxs in the cytoplasm of P. falciparum, we investigated the heat
stress sensitivity of the previously established PfTPx-1 KO line and found that
PfTPx-1 disruption renders the parasite hypersensitive to heat stress. In
addition, we established Pf1-Cys-Prx knockout (KO) parasite lines. The phenotypes
of Pf1-Cys-Prx KO lines were different to those of the PfTPx-1 KO line and did
not show hypersensitivity to reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, 
chloroquine or heat stress. These results suggest that the function of
Pf1-Cys-Prx in the parasite cytoplasm is independent from that of PfTPx-1. The
hyperthermal protective function of the PfTPx-1 is obviously important for the
parasite physiology in the human patient body, in which it must survive repeated 
incidences of fever.
