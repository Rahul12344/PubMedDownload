Artemisinins have revolutionized the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria; 
however, resistance threatens to undermine global control efforts. To broadly
explore artemisinin susceptibility in apicomplexan parasites, we employ
genome-scale CRISPR screens recently developed for Toxoplasma gondii to discover 
sensitizing and desensitizing mutations. Using a sublethal concentration of
dihydroartemisinin (DHA), we uncover the putative transporter Tmem14c whose
disruption increases DHA susceptibility. Screens performed under high doses of
DHA provide evidence that mitochondrial metabolism can modulate resistance. We
show that disrupting a top candidate from the screens, the mitochondrial protease
DegP2, lowers porphyrin levels and decreases DHA susceptibility, without
significantly altering parasite fitness in culture. Deleting the homologous gene 
in P. falciparum, PfDegP, similarly lowers heme levels and DHA susceptibility.
These results expose the vulnerability of heme metabolism to genetic
perturbations that can lead to increased survival in the presence of DHA.
