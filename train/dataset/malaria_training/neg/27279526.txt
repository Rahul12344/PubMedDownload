BACKGROUND: Antigenic variation in Plasmodium falciparum is mediated by the
multicopy var gene family. Each parasite possesses about 60 var genes, and
switching between active var loci results in antigenic variation. In the current 
study, the effect of mosquito and host passage on in vitro var gene transcription
was investigated.
METHODS: Thirty malaria-naive individuals were inoculated by intradermal or
intravenous injection with cryopreserved, isogenic NF54 P. falciparum sporozoites
(PfSPZ) generated from 1 premosquito culture. Microscopic parasitemia developed
in 22 individuals, and 21 in vitro cultures were established. The var gene
transcript levels were determined in early and late postpatient cultures and in
the premosquito culture.
RESULTS: At the early time point, all cultures preferentially transcribed 8
subtelomeric var genes. Intradermal infections had higher var gene transcript
levels than intravenous infections and a significantly longer intrahost
replication time (P = .03). At the late time point, 9 subtelomeric and 8 central 
var genes were transcribed at the same levels in almost all cultures. Premosquito
and late postpatient cultures transcribed the same subtelomeric and central var
genes, except for var2csa
CONCLUSIONS: The duration of intrahost replication influences in vitro var gene
transcript patterns. Differences between premosquito and postpatient cultures
decrease with prolonged in vitro growth.
