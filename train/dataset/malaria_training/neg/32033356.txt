Chromosomal inversions are important drivers of genome evolution. The Eurasian
malaria vector Anopheles messeae has five polymorphic inversions. A cryptic
species, An. daciae, has been discriminated from An. messeae based on five fixed 
nucleotide substitutions in the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) of ribosomal
DNA. However, the inversion polymorphism in An. daciae and the genome divergence 
between these species remain unexplored. In this study, we sequenced the ITS2
region and analyzed the inversion frequencies of 289 Anopheles larvae specimens
collected from three locations in the Moscow region. Five individual genomes for 
each of the two species were sequenced. We determined that An. messeae and An.
daciae differ from each other by the frequency of polymorphic inversions.
Inversion X1 was fixed in An. messeae but polymorphic in An. daciae populations. 
The genome sequence comparison demonstrated genome-wide divergence between the
species, especially pronounced on the inversion-rich X chromosome (mean Fst =
0.331). The frequency of polymorphic autosomal inversions was higher in An.
messeae than in An. daciae. We conclude that the X chromosome inversions play an 
important role in the genomic differentiation between the species. Our study
determined that An. messeae and An. daciae are closely related species with
incomplete reproductive isolation.
