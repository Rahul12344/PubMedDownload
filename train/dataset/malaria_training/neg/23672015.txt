Abstract: The first-line drug artemisinin is widely used against malaria.
Commercially available artemisinin is extracted from plants. However, the lack of
sufficient raw material, artemisinin and the cost associated with the drug's
manufacture have limited the supply of ACT to most malaria sufferers in the
Developing World. As such, it is important to develop a low cost, fine to
environment and high-quality method to supply sufficient and reliable quantities 
of artemisinin in the future. The field of synthetic biology, which utilizes cell
factories to manipulate microbial metabolism to enhance the production of
artemisinin and its intermediates, has a particularly strong impact by providing 
new platforms for chemical production. After a brief introduction of the
artemisinin biosynthetic pathway, the present review focuses on the introduction 
of artemisinin biosynthetic genes, such as the genes encoding amorpha-4, 11-diene
monooxygenase, NADPH: cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase, artemisinic aldehyde delta 
11(13) reductase and aldehyde dehydrogenase. The review also addresses general
considerations for potential contributions of synthetic biology to artemisinin
production, with an emphasis on factors influencing interest compounds production
in chassis cells.
