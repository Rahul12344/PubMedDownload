Plasmodium falciparum genome has 81% A+T content. This nucleotide bias leads to
extreme codon usage bias and culminates in frequent insertion of asparagine
homorepeats in the proteome. Using recodonized GFP sequences, we show that codons
decoded via G:U wobble pairing are suboptimal codons that are negatively
associated to protein translation efficiency. Despite this, one third of all
codons in the genome are GU wobble codons, suggesting that codon usage in P.
falciparum has not been driven to maximize translation efficiency, but may have
evolved as translational regulatory mechanism. Particularly, asparagine
homorepeats are generally encoded by locally clustered GU wobble AAT codons, we
demonstrated that this GU wobble-rich codon context is the determining factor
that causes reduction of protein level. Moreover, insertion of clustered AAT
codons also causes destabilization of the transcripts. Interestingly, more
frequent asparagine homorepeats insertion is seen in single-exon genes,
suggesting transcripts of these genes may have been programmed for rapid mRNA
decay to compensate for the inefficiency of mRNA surveillance regulation on
intronless genes. To our knowledge, this is the first study that addresses P.
falciparum codon usage in vitro and provides new insights on translational
regulation and genome evolution of this parasite.
