INTRODUCTION: Emergence of chloroquine (CQ) resistance in Plasmodium falciparum
has increased the morbidity and mortality of falciparum malaria worldwide.
Artemisinin-based combination therapies are now recommended by the World Health
Organization as the first line treatment for falciparum malaria. Numerous
molecular markers have been implicated in the CQ and artemisinin resistance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 26 confirmed cases of falciparum malaria (by
giemsa stained thick and thin smear, quantitative buffy coat,
immunochromatographic test, or polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were included in 
the study. About 5 ml of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid blood sample was
collected and stored at -20Â°C till use. Plasmodium DNA was extracted using QIAamp
whole blood DNA extraction kit. PCR was done to amplify pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfserca,
and pfmrp1 genes and the amplicons obtained were sequenced by Macrogen, Inc.,
Korea. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis was done using Bio-Edit
Sequence Alignment Editor.
RESULTS: Out of the four genes targeted, we noted a SNP in the pfcrt gene alone. 
This SNP (G > T) was noted in the 658(th) position of the gene, which was seen in
13 patients. The pfmdr1 and pfserca genes were present in 9 and 14 patients
respectively. But we could not find any SNPs in these genes. This SNP in pfcrt
gene was not significantly associated with any adverse outcome and neither
altered disease progression.
CONCLUSION: Presence of a single SNP may not be associated with any adverse
clinical outcome. As the sample size was small, we may have not been able to
detect any other known or unknown polymorphisms.
