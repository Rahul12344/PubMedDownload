BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization currently recommends artemisinin (along
with a partner drug) as the global frontline treatment for Plasmodium falciparum 
malaria. Artemisinin resistant P. falciparum are now found throughout the greater
Mekong subregion of South East Asia. Several polymorphisms in the parasite's
kelch gene have been demonstrated to confer artemisinin resistance. While
genotypes within the greater Mekong subregion are thoroughly examined in the
literature, P. falciparum populations within several areas that do not (yet) have
endemic resistance are underrepresented.
RESULTS: This investigation characterised the Pfkelch13 propeller domains from
153 blood samples of 140 imported cases of P. falciparum malaria in New South
Wales from 2010 to 2016. A low level of propeller domain diversity was observed, 
including the C580Y coding mutation most strongly associated with artemisinin
resistance in South East Asia. The resistance genotype was found in a sample
originating in Papua New Guinea, where this mutation, or artemisinin treatment
failure, have not been previously reported. Sequencing a panel of geographically 
informative polymorphisms within the organellar genomes identified the C580Y
parasite as having Oceanic origins. Patient data analysis revealed that New South
Wales, Australia, P. falciparum malaria cases often originated from regions with 
limited drug resistance screening.
CONCLUSIONS: The C580Y finding from outside of the greater Mekong subregion
supports the consensus to upscale molecular surveillance of artemisinin
resistance outside of South East Asia. The genetic screening results identify a
risk of importing resistant falciparum malaria to Australia, supporting an
ongoing surveillance protocol to pre-empt treatment failure and contribute to
global data gathering.
