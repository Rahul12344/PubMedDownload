The development of artemisinin (ART)-resistant parasites in Southeast Asia (SEA) 
threatens malaria control globally. Mutations in the Kelch 13 (K13)-propeller
domain have been useful in identifying ART resistance in SEA. ART combination
therapy (ACT) remains highly efficacious in the treatment of uncomplicated
malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, it is crucial that the efficacy of 
ACT is closely monitored. Toward this effort, this study profiled the prevalence 
of K13 nonsynonymous mutations in different malaria ecological zones of Kenya and
in different time periods, before (pre) and after (post) the introduction of ACT 
as the first-line treatment of malaria. Nineteen nonsynonymous mutations were
present in the pre-ACT samples (N = 64) compared with 22 in the post-ACT samples 
(N = 251). Eight of these mutations were present in both pre- and post-ACT
parasites. Interestingly, seven of the shared single-nucleotide polymorphisms
were at higher frequencies in the pre-ACT than the post-ACT parasites. The A578S 
mutation reported in SSA and the V568G mutation reported in SEA were found in
both pre- and post-ACT parasites, with their frequencies declining post-ACT.
D584Y and R539K mutations were found only in post-ACT parasites; changes in these
codons have also been reported in SEA with different amino acids. The N585K
mutation described for the first time in this study was present only in post-ACT 
parasites, and it was the most prevalent mutation at a frequency of 5.2%. This
study showed the type, prevalence, and frequency of K13 mutations that varied
based on the malaria ecological zones and also between the pre- and post-ACT time
periods.
