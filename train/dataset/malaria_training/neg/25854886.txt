Sexual reproduction is an obligate step in the life cycle of many parasites,
including the causative agents of malaria (Plasmodium). Mixed-species infections 
are common in nature and consequently, interactions between heterospecific
gametes occur. Given the importance of managing gene flow across parasite
populations, remarkably little is understood about how reproductive isolation
between species is maintained. We use the rodent malaria parasites P. berghei and
P. yoelii to investigate the ecology of mixed-species mating groups, identify
proteins involved in pre-zygotic barriers, and examine their evolution.
Specifically, we show that (i) hybridization occurs, but at low frequency; (ii)
hybridization reaches high levels when female gametes lack the surface proteins
P230 or P48/45, demonstrating that these proteins are key for pre-zygotic
reproductive isolation; (iii) asymmetric reproductive interference occurs, where 
the fertility of P. berghei gametes is reduced in the presence of P. yoelii and
(iv) as expected for gamete recognition proteins, strong positive selection acts 
on a region of P230 and P47 (P48/45 paralogue). P230 and P48/45 are leading
candidates for interventions to block malaria transmission. Our results suggest
that depending on the viability of hybrids, applying such interventions to
populations where mixed-species infections occur could either facilitate or
hinder malaria control.
