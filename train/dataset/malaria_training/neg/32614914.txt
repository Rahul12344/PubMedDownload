Anopheles sundaicus s.l. is an important malaria vector primarily found in
coastal landscapes of western and central Indonesia. The species complex has a
wide geographical distribution in South and Southeast Asia and exhibits
ecological and behavioural variability over its range. Studies on understanding
the distribution of different members in the complex and their bionomics related 
to malaria transmission might be important guiding more effective vector
intervention strategies. Female An. sundaicus s.l. were collected from seven
provinces, 12 locations in Indonesia representing Sumatra: North Sumatra,
Bangka-Belitung, South Lampung, and Bengkulu; in Java: West Java; and the Lesser 
Sunda Islands: West Nusa Tenggara and East Nusa Tenggara provinces. Sequencing of
ribosomal DNA ITS2 gene fragments and two mitochondrial DNA gene markers, COI and
cytb, enabled molecular identification of morphologically indistinguishable
members of the complex. Findings allowed inference on the distribution of the An.
sundaicus s.l. present in Indonesia and further illustrate the phylogenetic
relationships of An. epiroticus within the complex. A total of 370 An. sundaicus 
s.l specimens were analysed for the ITS2 fragment. The ITS2 sequence alignment
revealed two consistent species-specific point mutations, a T>C transition at
base 479 and a G>T transversion at base 538 that differentiated five haplotypes: 
TG, CG, TT, CT, and TY. The TG haplotype matched published An.
epiroticus-indicative sequences from Thailand, Vietnam and peninsular Malaysia.
The previously described insertion event (base 603) was observed in all
identified specimens. Analysis of the COI and cytb genes revealed no consistent
nucleotide variations that could definitively distinguish An. epiroticus from
other members in the Sundaicus Complex. The findings indicate and support the
existence of An. epiroticus in North Sumatra and Bangka-Belitung archipelago.
Further studies are recommended to determine the full distributional extent of
the Sundaicus complex in Indonesia and investigate the role of these species in
malaria transmission.
