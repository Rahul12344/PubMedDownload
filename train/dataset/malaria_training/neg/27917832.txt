Serine protease inhibitors (serpins) in insects function within development,
wound healing and immunity. The genome of the African malaria vector, Anopheles
gambiae, encodes 23 distinct serpin proteins, several of which are implicated in 
disease-relevant physiological responses. A. gambiae serpin 18 (SRPN18) was
previously categorized as non-inhibitory based on the sequence of its
reactive-center loop (RCL), a region responsible for targeting and initiating
protease inhibition. The crystal structure of A. gambiae SRPN18 was determined to
a resolution of 1.45 Å, including nearly the entire RCL in one of the two
molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure reveals that the SRPN18 RCL is
extremely short and constricted, a feature associated with noncanonical
inhibitors or non-inhibitory serpin superfamily members. Furthermore, the SRPN18 
RCL does not contain a suitable protease target site and contains a large number 
of prolines. The SRPN18 structure therefore reveals a unique RCL architecture
among the highly conserved serpin fold.
