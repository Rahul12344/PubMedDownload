The piggyBac transposon was modified to generate gene trap constructs, which were
then incorporated into the genome of the Asian malaria vector, Anopheles
stephensi and remobilized through genetic crosses using a piggyBac transposase
expressing line. A total of 620 remobilization events were documented, and 73
were further characterized at the DNA level to identify patterns in insertion
site preferences, remobilization frequencies, and remobilization patterns.
Overall, the use of the tetameric AmCyan reporter as the fusion peptide displayed
a preference for insertion into the 5'-end of transcripts. Notably 183 - 44882 bp
upstream of the An. stephensi v1.0 ab initio gene models, which demonstrated that
the promoter regions for the genes of An. stephensi are further upstream of the
5'-proximal regions of the genes in the ab inito models than may be otherwise
predicted. RNA-Seq transcript coverage supported the insertion of the splice
acceptor gene trap element into 5'-UTR introns for nearly half of all insertions 
identified. The use of a gene trap element that prefers insertion into the 5'-end
of genes supports the use of this technology for the random generation of
knock-out mutants, as well as the experimental confirmation of 5'-UTR introns in 
An. stephensi.
