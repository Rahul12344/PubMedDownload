Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are involved in the biotransformation of
chloroquine (CQ), but the role of the different profiles of metabolism of this
drug in relation to Plasmodium vivax recurrences has not been properly
investigated. To investigate the influence of the CYP genotypes associated with
CQ metabolism on the rates of P. vivax early recurrences, a case-control study
was carried out. The cases included patients presenting with an early recurrence 
(CQ-recurrent individuals), defined as a recurrence during the first 28 days
after initial infection and plasma concentrations of CQ plus desethylchloroquine 
(DCQ; the major CQ metabolite) higher than 100 ng/ml. A control group with no
parasite recurrence over the follow-up (the CQ-responsive group) was also
included. CQ and DCQ plasma levels were measured on day 28. CQ-metabolizing CYP
(CYP2C8, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5) genotypes were determined by real-time PCR. An ex
vivo study was conducted to verify the efficacy of CQ and DCQ against P. vivax
isolates. The frequency of alleles associated with normal and slow metabolism was
similar between the cases and the controls for the CYP2C8 (odds ratio
[OR] = 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.51 to 4.14, P = 0.570), CYP3A4
(OR = 2.38, 95% CI = 0.92 to 6.19, P = 0.105), and CYP3A5 (OR = 4.17, 95%
CI = 0.79 to 22.04, P = 1.038) genes. DCQ levels were higher than CQ levels,
regardless of the genotype. Regarding the DCQ/CQ ratio, there was no difference
between groups or between those patients who had a normal genotype and those
patients who had a mutant genotype. DCQ and CQ showed similar efficacy ex vivo
CYP genotypes had no influence on early recurrence rates. The similar efficacy of
CQ and DCQ ex vivo could explain the absence of therapeutic failure, despite the 
presence of alleles associated with slow metabolism.
