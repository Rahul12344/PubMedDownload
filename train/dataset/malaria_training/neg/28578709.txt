BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax remains a potential cause of morbidity and mortality
for people living in its endemic areas. Understanding the genetic diversity of P.
vivax from different regions is valuable for studying population dynamics and
tracing the origins of parasites. The PvMSP-1 gene is highly polymorphic and has 
been used as a marker in many P. vivax population studies. The aim of this study 
was to investigate the genetic diversity of the PvMSP-1 gene icb5-6 fragment and 
to provide more genetic polymorphism data for further studies on P. vivax
population structure and tracking of the origin of clinical cases.
METHODS: Nested PCR and sequencing of the PvMSP-1 icb5-6 marker were performed to
obtain the nucleotide sequences of 95 P. vivax isolates collected from Zhejiang
province, China. To investigate the genetic diversity of PvMSP-1, the 95
nucleotide sequences of the PvMSP-1 icb5-6 fragment were genotyped and analyzed
using DnaSP v5, MEGA software.
RESULTS: The 95 P. vivax isolates collected from Zhejiang province were either
indigenous cases or imported cases from different regions around the world. A
total of 95 sequences ranging from 390 to 460Â bp were obtained. The 95 sequences 
were genotyped into four allele-types (Sal I, Belem, R-III and R-IV) and 17
unique haplotypes. R-III and Sal I were the predominant allele-types. The
haplotype diversity (Hd) and nucleotide diversity (Pi) were estimated to be 0.729
and 0.062, indicating that the PvMSP-1 icb5-6 fragment had the highest level of
polymorphism due to frequent recombination processes and single nucleotide
polymorphism. The values of dN/dS and Tajima's D both suggested neutral selection
for the PvMSP-1icb5-6 fragment. In addition, a rare recombinant style of R-IV
type was identified.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presented high genetic diversity in the PvMSP-1 marker
among P. vivax strains from around the world. The genetic data is valuable for
expanding the polymorphism information on P. vivax, which could be helpful for
further study on population dynamics and tracking the origin of P. vivax.
