Protein phosphorylation is the most important post-translational event in the
regulation of various essential signaling pathways in a cell. Here, we show the
functional characterization of a FIKK family protein kinase of the rodent malaria
parasite (PbMLFK), which is expressed only in mosquito and liver stages and
contains two functional C-terminal PEXEL motifs. We demonstrate that this protein
plays a role in mosquito and liver stages of parasite growth. The oocysts of
PbMLFK-deficient parasites produced 4-fold fewer sporozoites. In the liver of
infected mice, PbMLFK-deficient parasites grew 100-fold less than did wild type
parasites. We also show that the C-terminal domain of this protein has a
functional serine-threonine kinase and that its activity was inhibited by a known
PKA inhibitor. Transcriptome analysis of infected host cells suggests that in
absence of this protein expression of the 288 host mRNAs are perturbed which are 
primarily associated with the immune system, cell cycle and metabolism.
