An unusual genome architecture characterizes the two related human parasitic
pathogens Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii. A major fraction of the
bulk parasite genome is packaged as transcriptionally permissive euchromatin with
few loci embedded in silenced heterochromatin. Primary chromatin shapers include 
histone modifications at the nucleosome lateral surface close to the DNA but
their mode of action remains unclear. We now identify versatile modifications at 
Lys31 within the globular domain of histone H4 that crucially determine genome
organization and expression in Apicomplexa parasites. H4K31 acetylation at the
promoter correlates with, and perhaps directly regulates, gene expression in both
parasites. By contrast, monomethylated H4K31 is enriched in the core body of T.
gondii active genes but inversely correlates with transcription, whereas it is
unexpectedly enriched at transcriptionally inactive pericentromeric
heterochromatin in P. falciparum, a region devoid of the characteristic H3K9me3
histone mark and its downstream effector HP1.
