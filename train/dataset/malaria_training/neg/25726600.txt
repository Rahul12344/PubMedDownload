OBJECTIVE: To identify and analyze Plasmodium ovale wallikeri in 5 imported
malaria cases, who were detected positive by microscopy and negative by
conventional PCR.
METHODS: Epidemiological information and blood samples were collected from the
five patients. The detection was conducted by microscopy, Rapid Diagnostic Test
(RDT) and nested PCR with Plasmodium genus-specific, species-specific and
Plasmodium ovale wallikeri-specific primers. The amplified products were
sequenced and Blast analysis was performed on line in NCBI.
RESULTS: The five patients returned from Africa, and all had a history of
malaria. They were microscopically positive for Plasmodium sp., and two cases
showed Pan positive RDT result. All blood samples were negative for four
Plasmodium spp. by conventional nested PCR, but positive by nested PCR with
Plasmodium ovale wallikeri-specific primers. Blast analysis showed that the
amplified sequences of the five cases had complete homology with P. ovale
wallikeri clone RSH10 18S ribosomal RNA gene (Accession No. KF219561.1).
CONCLUSION: The five cases which classified as positive by microscopy while
negative by conventional PCR have been confirmed as Plasmodium ovale wallikeri
infection by nested PCR with P. ovale wallikeri-specific primers.
