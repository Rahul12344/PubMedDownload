The diversity and specificity of T cell receptors (TCR), the characteristics of
T-cell surface marker, are central to the adaptive immunity. TCR variability is
required for successful immunization coverage because this structural foundation 
is indispensable for the valid identification of short antigen peptides (derived 
from degraded antigens) that are presented by major histocompatibility molecules 
on the surfaces of antigen-presenting cells. Despite the vast T-cell repertoire, 
biased αβ TCR has become a common theme in immunology. To date, numerous examples
of TCR bias have been observed in various diseases. Immunotherapy strategies that
are based on αβ T cell responses are also emerged as a prominent component of
clinical treatment. In the present review, we briefly summarize the current
knowledge regarding basic structural information and the molecular mechanisms
underlying TCR diversity. Moreover, we outline the role of TCR repertoire bias in
some diseases, and its application for therapeutic interventions, as these play
significant roles in disease progression, even with patients with a good
prognosis.
