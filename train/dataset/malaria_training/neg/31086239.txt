The malaria parasite species, Plasmodium vivax infects not only humans, but also 
African apes. Human specific P. vivax has evolved from a single ancestor that
originated from a parasite of African apes. Although previous studies have
proposed phylogenetic trees positioning P. vivax (the common ancestor of human
and African ape P. vivax) within the assemblages of Asian primate parasites, its 
position has not yet been robustly confirmed. We determined nearly complete
apicoplast genome sequences from seven Asian primate parasites, Plasmodium
cynomolgi (strains Ceylonensis and Berok), P. knowlesi P. fragile, P. fieldi, P. 
simiovale, P. hylobati, P. inui, and an African primate parasite, P. gonderi,
that infects African guenon. Phylogenetic relationships of the Plasmodium species
were analyzed using newly and previously determined apicoplast genome sequences. 
Multigene maximum likelihood analysis of 30 protein coding genes did not position
P. vivax within the Asian primate parasite clade but positioned it basal to the
clade, after the branching of an African guenon parasite, P. gonderi. The result 
does not contradict with the emerging notion that P. vivax phylogenetically
originated from Africa. The result is also supported by phylogenetic analyses
performed using massive nuclear genome data of seven primate Plasmodium species.
