BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that the baculovirus-vectored vaccine
based on the "baculovirus dual expression system (BDES)" is an effective vaccine 
delivery platform for malaria. However, a point of weakness remaining for use of 
this vaccine platform in vivo concerns viral inactivation by serum complement. In
an effort to achieve complement resistance, the gene encoding the human
decay-accelerating factor (hDAF) was incorporated into the BDES malaria vaccine
expressing the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP).
RESULTS: The newly-developed BDES vaccine, designated BDES-sPfCSP2-Spider,
effectively displayed hDAF and PfCSP on the surface of the viral envelope,
resulting in complement resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, upon
intramuscular inoculation into mice, the BDES-sPfCSP2-Spider vaccine had a higher
protective efficacy (60%) than that of the control vaccine BDES-sPfCSP2-Spier
(30%) against challenge with transgenic Plasmodium berghei sporozoites expressing
PfCSP.
CONCLUSION: DAF-shielded BDES-vaccines offer great potential for development as a
new malaria vaccine platform against the sporozoite challenge.
