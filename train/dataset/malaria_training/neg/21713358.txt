INTRODUCTION: The genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum has been one of the 
major obstacles for the success of anti-malaria drug therapy. It provides the
parasite an ability to evade the host's immune response by generating changes in 
its antigenic composition and resistance to antimalarial drugs.
OBJECTIVE: The genetic diversity of P.falciparum was characterized in 4 Colombian
localities through the analysis of polymorphic genes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-one samples were obtained from patients with
uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria and screened for polymorphic variants of
msp1, msp2 (merozoite surface proteins) and glurp (glutamate-rich protein) with a
multiplex PCR assay. The geographic regions sampled were Tierralta (Córdoba), in 
northwestern Colombia and in the Orinoco river watershed of eastern
Colombia--Inírida (Guainía), La Carpa (Guaviare), and Casuarito (Vichada).
RESULTS: The MAD20 variant was detected in all samples analyzed for the msp1
gene. For the msp2 gene, the IC allelic family was found in 96.3% of the samples 
as compared to 4.9% of the samples with the FC family. Both families showed size 
polymorphism with bands between 467 and 513 basepairs (bp) for IC and 286 and 300
bp for FC. PCR products of differing sizes were detected for the glurp gene and
grouped into 5 size classes: I (600-699 bp) 2.5%, II (700-799 bp) 19.8%, III
(800-899 bp) 72.8%, IV (900-999 bp) 1.2% and V (1000-1099 bp) 3.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: The msp1 molecular marker did not provide information for
differentiating P. falciparum parasite populations. The msp2 gene was more
suitable for studying the genetic diversity, however, further studies are
required to identify polymorphisms within the two allelic families. The glurp
gene showed a great genetic diversity of circulating P. falciparum populations,
and suggested that this gene may be useful for distinguishing between
recrudescence and reinfection.
