Primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) are an essential tool for modeling drug
metabolism and liver disease. However, variable plating efficiencies, short
lifespan in culture, and resistance to genetic manipulation have limited their
use. Here, we show that the pyrrolizidine alkaloid retrorsine improves PHH
repopulation of chimeric mice on average 10-fold and rescues the ability of even 
poorly plateable donor hepatocytes to provide cells for subsequent ex vivo
cultures. These mouse-passaged (mp) PHH cultures overcome the marked
donor-to-donor variability of cryopreserved PHH and remain functional for months 
as demonstrated by metabolic assays and infection with hepatitis B virus and
Plasmodium falciparum mpPHH can be efficiently genetically modified in culture,
mobilized, and then recultured as spheroids or retransplanted to create highly
humanized mice that carry a genetically altered hepatocyte graft. Together, these
advances provide flexible tools for the study of human liver disease and
evaluation of hepatocyte-targeted gene therapy approaches.
