BACKGROUND: The phylum Apicomplexa comprises important unicellular human
parasites such as Toxoplasma and Plasmodium. Eimeria is the largest and most
diverse genus of apicomplexan parasites and some species of the genus are the
causative agent of coccidiosis, a disease economically devastating in poultry. We
report a complete genome sequence of the mouse parasite Eimeria falciformis. We
assembled and annotated the genome sequence to study host-parasite interactions
in this understudied genus in a model organism host.
RESULTS: The genome of E. falciformis is 44 Mb in size and contains 5,879
predicted protein coding genes. Comparative analysis of E. falciformis with
Toxoplasma gondii shows an emergence and diversification of gene families
associated with motility and invasion mainly at the level of the Coccidia. Many
rhoptry kinases, among them important virulence factors in T. gondii, are absent 
from the E. falciformis genome. Surface antigens are divergent between Eimeria
species. Comparisons with T. gondii showed differences between genes involved in 
metabolism, N-glycan and GPI-anchor synthesis. E. falciformis possesses a reduced
set of transmembrane transporters and we suggest an altered mode of iron uptake
in the genus Eimeria.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced diversity of genes required for host-parasite interaction
and transmembrane transport allow hypotheses on host adaptation and
specialization of a single host parasite. The E. falciformis genome sequence
sheds light on the evolution of the Coccidia and helps to identify determinants
of host-parasite interaction critical for drug and vaccine development.
