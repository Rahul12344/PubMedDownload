Aphelids are a poorly known group of parasitoids of algae that have raised
considerable interest due to their pivotal phylogenetic position. Together with
Cryptomycota and the highly derived Microsporidia, they have been recently
re-classified as Opisthosporidia, being the sister group to fungi. Despite their 
huge diversity, as revealed by molecular environmental studies, and their
phylogenetic interest, only three genera have been described (Aphelidium,
Amoeboaphelidium, and Pseudaphelidium), from which 18S rRNA gene sequences exist 
only for Amoeboaphelidium species. Here, we describe the life cycle and
ultrastructure of Aphelidium aff. melosirae, and provide the first 18S rRNA gene 
sequence obtained for this genus. Molecular phylogeny analysis indicates that
Aphelidium is very distantly related to Amoebaphelidium, highlighting the wide
genetic diversity of the aphelids. The parasitoid encysts and penetrates the host
alga, Tribonema gayanum through an infection tube. Cyst germination leads to a
young trophont that phagocytes the algal cell content and progressively develops 
a plasmodium, which becomes a zoospore-producing sporangium. Aphelidium aff.
melosirae has amoeboflagellate zoospores, tubular/lamellar mitochondrial cristae,
a metazoan type of centrosome, and closed orthomitosis with an intranuclear
spindle. These features together with trophont phagocytosis distinguish
Aphelidium from fungi and support the erection of the new superphylum
Opisthosporidia as sister to fungi.
