BACKGROUND: Malaria vector mosquitoes acquire midgut microbiota primarily from
their habitat. The homeostasis of these microbial communities plays an essential 
role in the mosquito longevity, the most essential factor in the mosquito
vectorial capacity. Our recent study revealed that silencing genes involved in
regulation of the midgut homeostasis including FN3D1, FN3D3 and GPRGr9 reduced
the survival of female adult Anopheles arabiensis mosquitoes. In the present
study, we investigate the stability of the gene silencing efficiency of
mosquitoes reared in three different breeding conditions representing distinct
larval habitat types: town brick pits in Jimma, flood pools in the rural land of 
Asendabo and roadside pools in Wolkite.
METHODS: First-instar larvae of An. arabiensis mosquitoes were reared separately 
using water collected from the three breeding sites. The resulting adult females 
were micro-injected with dsRNA targeting the FN3D1 gene (AARA003032) and their
survival was monitored. Control mosquitoes were injected with dsRNA Lacz. In
addition, the load of midgut microbiota of these mosquitoes was determined using 
flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Survival of na√Øve adult female mosquitoes differed between the three
sites. Mosquitoes reared using water collected from brick pits and flood pools
survived longer than mosquitoes reared using water collected from roadside.
However, the FN3D1 gene silencing effect on survival did not differ between the
three sites.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed that the efficacy of FN3D1 gene silencing
is not affected by variation in the larval habitat. Thus, silencing this gene has
potential for application throughout sub-Saharan Africa.
