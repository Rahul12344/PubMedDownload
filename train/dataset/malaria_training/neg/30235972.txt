Antisense transcription emerges as a key regulator of important biological
processes in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. RNA-processing
factors, however, remain poorly characterized in this pathogen. Here, we purified
the multiprotein RNA exosome complex of malaria parasites by affinity
chromatography, using HA-tagged PfRrp4 and PfDis3 as the ligands. Seven distinct 
core exosome subunits (PfRrp41, PfMtr3, PfRrp42, PfRrp45, PfRrp4, PfRrp40,
PfCsl4) and two exoribonuclease proteins PfRrp6 and PfDis3 are identified by mass
spectrometry. Western blot analysis detects Dis3 and Rrp4 predominantly in the
cytoplasmic fraction during asexual blood stage development. An inducible gene
knock out of the PfDis3 subunit reveals the upregulation of structural and coding
RNA, but the vast majority belongs to antisense RNA. Furthermore, we detect
numerous types of cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) linked to virulence gene
families including antisense RNA in the rif gene family. Our work highlights the 
limitations of steady-state RNA analysis to predict transcriptional activity and 
link the RNA surveillance machinery directly with post-transcriptional control
and gene expression in malaria parasites.
