The influence of parasite genetic factors on immune responses and development of 
severe pathology of malaria is largely unknown. In this study, we performed
genome-wide transcriptomic profiling of mouse whole blood during blood-stage
infections of two strains of the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi that
differ in virulence. We identified several transcriptomic signatures associated
with the virulent infection, including signatures for platelet aggregation,
stronger and prolonged anemia and lung inflammation. The first two signatures
were detected prior to pathology. The anemia signature indicated deregulation of 
host erythropoiesis, and the lung inflammation signature was linked to increased 
neutrophil infiltration, more cell death and greater parasite sequestration in
the lungs. This comparative whole-blood transcriptomics profiling of virulent and
avirulent malaria shows the validity of this approach to inform severity of the
infection and provide insight into pathogenic mechanisms.
