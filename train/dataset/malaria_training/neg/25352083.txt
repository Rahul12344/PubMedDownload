The coevolutionary relationships between avian malaria parasites and their hosts 
influence the host specificity, geographical distribution and pathogenicity of
these parasites. However, to understand fine scale coevolutionary host-parasite
relationships, robust and widespread sampling from closely related hosts is
needed. We thus sought to explore the coevolutionary history of avian Plasmodium 
and the widespread African sunbirds, family Nectariniidae. These birds are
distributed throughout Africa and occupy a variety of habitats. Considering the
role that habitat plays in influencing host-specificity and the role that
host-specificity plays in coevolutionary relationships, African sunbirds provide 
an exceptional model system to study the processes that govern the distribution
and diversity of avian malaria. Here we evaluated the coevolutionary histories
using a multi-gene phylogeny for Nectariniidae and avian Plasmodium found in
Nectariniidae. We then assessed the host-parasite biogeography and the
structuring of parasite assemblages. We recovered Plasmodium lineages
concurrently in East, West, South and Island regions of Africa. However, several 
Plasmodium lineages were recovered exclusively within one respective region,
despite being found in widely distributed hosts. In addition, we inferred the
biogeographic history of these parasites and provide evidence supporting a model 
of biotic diversification in avian Plasmodium of African sunbirds.
