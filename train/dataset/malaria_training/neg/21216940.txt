Parasitic protozoa, such as malaria parasites, trypanosomes, and Leishmania,
acquire a plethora of nutrients from their hosts, employing transport proteins
located in the plasma membrane of the parasite. Application of molecular genetic 
approaches and the completion of genome projects have allowed the identification 
and functional characterization of a cohort of transporters and their genes in
these parasites. This review focuses on a subset of these permeases that have
been studied in some detail, that import critical nutrients, and that provide
examples of approaches being undertaken broadly with these and other parasite
transporters. Permeases reviewed include those for hexoses, purines, iron,
polyamines, carboxylates, and amino acids. Topics of special emphasis include
structure-function approaches, critical roles for transporters in parasite
viability and physiology, regulation of transporter expression, and subcellular
targeting. Investigations of parasite transporters impact a broad spectrum of
basic biological problems in these protozoa.
