Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is commonly seen in malaria
endemic areas as it is known to confer a selective advantage against malaria.
Recently, we reported a high proportion of asymptomatic reservoir of Plasmodium
vivax in Botswana, that calls for intervention with primaquine to achieve radical
cure of vivax malaria. Considering that individuals with this enzyme deficiency
are at risk of haemolysis following primaquine treatment, assessment of the
population for the relative frequency of G6PD deficiency is imperative. Samples
from 3019 children from all the districts of Botswana were successfully genotyped
for polymorphisms at positions 202 and 376 of the G6PD gene. Haematological
parameters were also measured. The overall population allele frequency (based on 
the hemizygous male frequency) was 2.30% (95% CI, 1.77-2.83), while the overall
frequency of G6PD-deficient genotypes A- (hemizygote and homozygote genotypes
only) was 1.26% (95% CI, 0.86-1.66). G6PD deficiency is spread in Botswana
according to the historical prevalence of malaria with a North-West to South-East
decreasing gradient trend. There was no association between G6PD status and P.
vivax infection. G6PD A- form was found to be associated with decreased RBC count
and haemoglobin levels without a known cause or illness. In conclusion, we report
for the first time the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in Botswana which is
relevant for strategies in the malaria elimination campaign. Further work to
examine the activities of the enzyme in the Botswana population at risk for
malaria is warranted.
