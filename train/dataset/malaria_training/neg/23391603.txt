BACKGROUND: In malaria diagnosis, specific gene identification is required in
cases with subclinical infection or cases with mixed infection. This study
applied the biosensor technology based on quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) to
differentially diagnose the most common and severe malaria, Plasmodium falciparum
and Plasmodium vivax.
METHOD: The QCM surface was immobilized with malaria biotinylated probe. Specific
DNA fragments of malaria-infected blood were amplified. Hybridization between the
amplified products and the immobilized probe resulted in quartz frequency shifts 
which were measured by an in-house frequency counter. Diagnostic potency and
clinical application of the malaria QCM were evaluated.
RESULT: The malaria QCM could differentially diagnose blood infected with P.
falciparum from that infected with P. vivax (p-value<0.05). No cross reaction
with human DNA indicated the QCM specificity. Clinical application was evaluated 
using 30 suspected samples. Twenty-seven samples showed consistent diagnosis of
the QCM with microscopy and rapid diagnosis tests (RDTs). Three samples reported 
"no malaria found" by microscopy showed P. falciparum infection by both QCM and
the RDTs.
CONCLUSION: The malaria QCM was developed with high accuracy, specificity,
sensitivity, stability and cost-effectiveness. It is field applicable in malaria 
endemic area and might be a promising point of care testing.
