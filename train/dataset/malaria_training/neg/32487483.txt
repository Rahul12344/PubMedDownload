BACKGROUND: CD36 is a multifunctional receptor in cells that plays a role in
important cellular processes including immune regulation. Evidence indicates that
mutations in the CD36 gene are associated with malaria. Moreover, studies on the 
frequency of CD36 deficiency have been conducted in specific provinces of China. 
However, the frequency of CD36 deficiency may differ among various ethnic
populations. In this study, we analyzed the frequency of CD36 deficiency among
seven different provinces and minorities in China.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this study, 5313 samples were randomly collected from
seven provinces in China. CD36 deficiency on platelets and monocytes was
determined via flow cytometry using a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against CD36. DNA
sequencing analysis was performed to identify mutations associated with CD36
deficiency.
RESULTS: The frequency of CD36 deficiency among individuals from different
provinces (n = 7) was 1.60%, comprising 0.38% of type-I deficiency and 1.22% of
type-II deficiency. The distribution among provinces ranged from 0.81% to 1.99%. 
The largest ethnic group, Han, showed a lower frequency of deficiency than ethnic
minorities (1.30% versus 2.37%). The most common mutations found in our overall
cohort were 329-330delAC and 1228-1239delATTGTGCCTATT. Significant high
frequencies of CD36 deficiency were detected in two ethnic minorities, Zhuang
(3.69%) and BuYi (3.05%), living in southern China.
CONCLUSIONS: Through an analysis of a large cohort, we determined the frequencies
of CD36 deficiency among different Chinese ethnic groups. A high frequency of
type-I deficiency was found in certain minorities living in southern China, which
is known to be vulnerable to malaria epidemics. These findings may help us
understand the phenotypic consequences of CD36-deficient alleles associated with 
malaria.
