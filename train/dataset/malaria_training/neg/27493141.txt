Many malaria antigens contain multiple disulphide bonds involved in the formation
of inhibitory B-cell epitopes. Producing properly folded malaria antigens in
sufficient quantities for vaccination is often a challenge. The 42-kDa fragment
of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP142 ) is such a kind of 
malaria antigen. In this study, we investigated the expression of MSP142 in a
rice system (9522, a cultivar of Oryza sativa ssp. japonica), which was used as a
bioreactor for protein production. The MSP142 gene was synthesized according to
rice-preferred codons and transformed into rice plants via an
Agrobacterium-mediated method. The recombinant antigen was efficiently expressed 
in rice seeds with a level up to 1.56% of total soluble protein and was
recognized by both the conformational monoclonal antibody 5.2 (mAb5.2) and the
pooled sera of P. falciparum malaria patients. Rabbits were immunized
intramuscularly with the purified MSP142 formulated with Freund's adjuvant. High 
antibody titres against MSP142 were elicited. The rabbit immune sera reacted well
with the native protein of P. falciparum parasite and strongly inhibited the in
vitro growth of blood-stage P. falciparum parasites, demonstrating that
transgenic rice can become an efficient bioreactor for the production of malaria 
vaccine antigens.
