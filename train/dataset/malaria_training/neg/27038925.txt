BACKGROUND: Transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) are a promising strategy for
malaria control and elimination. However, candidate TBV antigens are currently
limited, highlighting the urgency of identifying new antigens for TBV
development.
METHODS: Using a combination of bioinformatic analysis and functional studies in 
the rodent malaria model Plasmodium berghei, we identified a conserved Plasmodium
protein PbPH (PBANKA_041720) containing a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The
expression of PbPH was detected by Western blot and indirect immunofluorescence
assay (IFA). The function of PbPH was tested by genetic knockout. The TB activity
was confirmed by in vitro ookinete conversion assay and mosquito feeding.
RESULTS: PbPH was detected in Western blot as highly expressed in sexual stages
(gametocytes and ookinetes). IFA revealed localizations of PbPH on the surface of
gametes, zygotes, and ookinetes. Deletion of the pbph gene did not affect asexual
growth, but significantly reduced the formation of gametocytes, ookinetes, and
oocysts, indicating that PbPH protein is required for parasite sexual
development. Recombinant PbPH expressed and purified from bacteria elicited
strong antibody responses in mice and the antibodies significantly inhibited
exflagellation of male gametocytes and formation of ookinetes in a
concentration-dependent manner. Mosquito feeding experiments confirmed that
mosquitoes fed on mice immunized with PbPH had 13 % reduction in the prevalence
of infection and almost 48 % reduction in oocyst density.
CONCLUSIONS: Pbph is a highly conserved Plasmodium gene and is required for
parasite sexual development. PbPH protein is expressed on the surface of gametes 
and ookinetes. Immunization of mice against the recombinant PbPH protein induced 
strong antibody responses that effectively reduced the formation of male gametes 
and ookinetes in vitro and blocked transmission of the parasites to mosquitoes.
These results highlight PbPH as a potential TBV candidate that is worth future
investigations in human malaria parasites.
