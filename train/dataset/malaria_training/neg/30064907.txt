Importin α is nuclear transport receptor that recognises nuclear localisation
sequences (NLS). The protein has two domains: armadillo (ARM) repeats containing 
NLS-binding sites and the importin β-binding (IBB) domain. The IBB domain mimics 
an NLS and can bind to the ARM repeats, preventing NLS binding. This phenomenon, 
called auto-inhibition, is a key regulatory feature for binding and release of
NLS-containing cargo by importin α and mutants that lack auto-inhibition show
impaired viability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The genome of the human malaria
parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, contains a single gene for importin α and here
we show that the native protein expressed by this gene lacks auto-inhibition,
suggesting that P. falciparum parasites possess unconventional mechanisms for
regulation of cargo binding and release. Mutation of a single SKR motif
(conserved in Plasmodium species) to KRR in P. falciparum importin α restores
auto-inhibition. This is the first report of a single-celled eukaryote that has
evolved with a single importin α isoform lacking auto-inhibition.
