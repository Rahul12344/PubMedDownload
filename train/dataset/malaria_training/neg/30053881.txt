BACKGROUND: Plasmodium 18S rRNA is a biomarker used to monitor blood-stage
infections in malaria clinical trials. Plasmodium sporozoites also express this
biomarker, and there is conflicting evidence about how long sporozoite-derived
18S rRNA persists in peripheral blood. If present in blood for an extended
timeframe, sporozoite-derived 18S rRNA could complicate use as a blood-stage
biomarker.
METHODS: Blood samples from Plasmodium yoelii infected mice were tested for
Plasmodium 18S rRNA and their coding genes (rDNA) using sensitive quantitative
reverse transcription PCR and quantitative PCR assays, respectively. Blood and
tissues from Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite (PfSPZ)-infected rhesus macaques
were similarly tested.
RESULTS: In mice, when P. yoelii sporozoite inoculation and blood collection were
performed at the same site (tail vein), low level rDNA positivity persisted for
2 days post-infection. Compared to intact parasites with high rRNA-to-rDNA
ratios, this low level positivity was accompanied by no increase in rRNA-to-rDNA,
indicating detection of residual, non-viable parasite rDNA. When P. yoelii
sporozoites were administered via the retro-orbital vein and blood sampled by
cardiac puncture, neither P. yoelii 18S rRNA nor rDNA were detected 24 h
post-infection. Similarly, there was no P. falciparum 18S rRNA detected in blood 
of rhesus macaques 3 days after intravenous injection with extremely high doses
of PfSPZ. Plasmodium 18S rRNA in the rhesus livers increased by approximately
101-fold from 3 to 6 days post infection, indicating liver-stage proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: Beyond the first few hours after injection, sporozoite-derived
Plasmodium 18S rRNA was not detected in peripheral blood. Diagnostics based on
18S rRNA are unlikely to be confounded by sporozoite inocula in human clinical
trials.
