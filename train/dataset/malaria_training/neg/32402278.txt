The inflammasomes control the bioactivity of pro-inflammatory cytokines of the
interleukin (IL)-1 family. The inflammasome assembled by NLRP3 has been
predominantly studied in homogeneous cell populations in vitro, neglecting the
influence of cellular interactions that occur in vivo. Here, we show that
platelets boost the inflammasome capacity of human macrophages and neutrophils
and are critical for IL-1 production by monocytes. Platelets license NLRP3
transcription, thereby enhancing ASC oligomerization, caspase-1 activity, and
IL-1β secretion. Platelets influence IL-1β production in vivo, and blood platelet
counts correlate with plasmatic IL-1β levels in malaria. Furthermore, we reveal
an enriched platelet gene signature among the highest-expressed transcripts in
IL-1β-driven autoinflammatory diseases. The platelet effect is independent of
cell-to-cell contact, platelet-derived lipid mediators, purines, nucleic acids,
and a host of platelet cytokines, and it involves the triggering of
calcium-sensing receptors on macrophages. Hence, platelets provide an additional 
layer of regulation of inflammasomes and IL-1-driven inflammation.
