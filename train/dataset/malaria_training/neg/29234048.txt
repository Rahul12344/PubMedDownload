Protein synthesis rates are determined, at the translational level, by properties
of the transcript's sequence. The efficiency of an mRNA can be tuned by varying
the ribosome binding sites controlling the recruitment of the ribosomes, or the
codon usage establishing the speed of protein elongation. In this work we propose
transcript length as a further key determinant of translation efficiency. Based
on a physical model that considers the kinetics of ribosomes advancing on the
mRNA and diffusing in its surrounding, as well as mRNA circularisation and
ribosome drop-off, we explain how the transcript length may play a central role
in establishing ribosome recruitment and the overall translation rate of an mRNA.
According to our results, the proximity of the 3' end to the ribosomal
recruitment site of the mRNA could induce a feedback in the translation process
that would favour the recycling of ribosomes. We also demonstrate how this
process may be involved in shaping the experimental ribosome density-gene length 
dependence. Finally, we argue that cells could exploit this mechanism to adjust
and balance the usage of its ribosomal resources.
