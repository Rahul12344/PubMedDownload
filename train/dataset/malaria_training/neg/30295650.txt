Malaria is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. This
disease, which primarily affects those living in tropical and subtropical
regions, is caused by infection with Plasmodium parasites. The development of
more effective drugs to combat malaria can be accelerated by improving our
understanding of the biology of this complex parasite. Genetic manipulation of
these parasites is key to understanding their biology; however, historically the 
genome of P. falciparum has been difficult to manipulate. Recently, CRISPR/Cas9
genome editing has been utilized in malaria parasites, allowing for easier
protein tagging, generation of conditional protein knockdowns, and deletion of
genes. CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has proven to be a powerful tool for advancing 
the field of malaria research. Here, we describe a CRISPR/Cas9 method for
generating glmS-based conditional knockdown mutants in P. falciparum. This method
is highly adaptable to other types of genetic manipulations, including protein
tagging and gene knockouts.
