BACKGROUND: Anopheles gambiae, one of the main Afro-tropical mosquito vector of
malaria, has adapted to heavy metals in its natural habitat, and developed
resistance to most conventional insecticides. Investigations were conducted to
establish an association between tolerance to cadmium or lead-heavy metals, and
expression of specific genes for cytochrome p450 enzymes associated with
pyrethroid resistance in the mosquito.
METHODS: Juvenile aquatic stages of the mosquito were selected for tolerance to
cadmiun or lead through chronic exposure of the stages to maximum acceptable
toxicant concentrations (MATCs) of the metals. Using real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), three replicates each of male or female cadmium
or lead-tolerant individuals and relevant controls were separately screened for
expression of CYP6M2, CYP6P3 and CYP6Z1 genes. The variance in expression levels 
of the genes amongst the treatments was compared by ANOVA statistical tool.
RESULTS: Expressions of all the genes were significantly lower (P <0.05) in
females than in males. Within gender, there 1.3 - 2.3 or 3.1-4.2-fold reduction
in expression of the genes in cadmium or lead selected than respective control
populations. Expression of all the classes of gene was elevated in cadmium
selected female populations relative to their respective controls.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that tolerance to cadmium or lead in the
mosquito can influence response in cytochrome p450 genes associated with
metabolism of pyrethroids in the mosquito in a sex-specific manner. This can, in 
turn, affect sensitivity of the mosquito to pyrethroids and other xenobiotics
associated with these genes, with potential implications in mosquito vector
control operations.
