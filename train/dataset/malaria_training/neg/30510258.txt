Low plasma haptoglobin is a risk factor for life-threatening childhood severe
malarial anemia and not an exclusive consequence of hemolysis.

Severe Malarial Anemia (SMA), a life-threatening childhood Plasmodium falciparum 
malaria syndrome requiring urgent blood transfusion, exhibits inflammatory and
hemolytic pathology. Differentiating between hypo-haptoglobinemia due to
hemolysis or that of genetic origin is key to understand SMA pathogenesis. We
hypothesized that while malaria-induced hypo-haptoglobinemia should reverse at
recovery, that of genetic etiology should not. We carried-out a case-control
study of children living under hyper-endemic holoendemic malaria burden in the
sub-Saharan metropolis of Ibadan, Nigeria. We show that hypo-haptoglobinemia is a
risk factor for childhood SMA and not solely due to intravascular hemolysis from 
underlying schizogony. In children presenting with SMA, hypo-haptoglobinemia
remains through convalescence to recovery suggesting a genetic cause. We
identified a haptoglobin gene variant, rs12162087 (g.-1203G > A,
frequency = 0.67), to be associated with plasma haptoglobin levels
(p = 8.5 × 10-6). The Homo-Var:(AA) is associated with high plasma haptoglobin
while the reference Homo-Ref:(GG) is associated with hypo-haptoglobinemia
(p = 2.3 × 10-6). The variant is associated with SMA, with the most support for a
risk effect for Homo-Ref genotype. Our insights on regulatory haptoglobin
genotypes and hypo-haptoglobinemia suggest that haptoglobin screening could be
part of risk-assessment algorithms to prevent rapid disease progression towards
SMA in regions with no-access to urgent blood transfusion where SMA accounts for 
high childhood mortality rates.
