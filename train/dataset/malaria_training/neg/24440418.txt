Anopheles farauti is the primary malaria vector throughout the coastal regions of
the Southwest Pacific. A shift in peak biting time from late to early in the
night occurred following widespread indoor residue spraying of
dichlorodiphenyltrichloro-ethane (DDT) and has persisted in some island
populations despite the intervention ending decades ago. We used mitochondrial
cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequence data and 12 newly developed microsatellite
markers to assess the population genetic structure of this malaria vector in the 
Solomon Archipelago. With geographically distinct differences in peak A. farauti 
night biting time observed in the Solomon Archipelago, we tested the hypothesis
that strong barriers to gene flow exist in this region. Significant and often
large fixation index (FST) values were found between different island populations
for the mitochondrial and nuclear markers, suggesting highly restricted gene flow
between islands. Some discordance in the location and strength of genetic breaks 
was observed between the mitochondrial and microsatellite markers. Since early
night biting A. farauti individuals occur naturally in all populations, the
strong gene flow barriers that we have identified in the Solomon Archipelago lend
weight to the hypothesis that the shifts in peak biting time from late to early
night have appeared independently in these disconnected island populations. For
this reason, we suggest that insecticide impregnated bed nets and indoor residue 
spraying are unlikely to be effective as control tools against A. farauti
occurring elsewhere, and if used, will probably result in peak biting time
behavioural shifts similar to that observed in the Solomon Islands.
