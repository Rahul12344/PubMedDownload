An essential step in the transmission of the malaria parasite to the Anopheles
vector is the transformation of the mature gametocytes into gametes in the
mosquito gut, where they egress from the erythrocytes and mate to produce a
zygote, which matures into a motile ookinete. Osmiophilic bodies are electron
dense secretory organelles of the female gametocytes which discharge their
contents during gamete formation, suggestive of a role in gamete egress. Only one
protein with no functional annotation, Pfg377, is described to specifically
reside in osmiophilic bodies in Plasmodium falciparum Importantly, Pfg377
defective gametocytes lack osmiophilic bodies and fail to infect mosquitoes, as
confirmed here with newly produced pfg377 disrupted parasites. The unique feature
of Pfg377 defective gametocytes of lacking osmiophilic bodies was here exploited 
to perform comparative, label free, global and affinity proteomics analyses of
mutant and wild type gametocytes to identify components of these organelles.
Subcellular localization studies with fluorescent reporter gene fusions and
specific antibodies revealed an osmiophilic body localization for four out of
five candidate gene products analyzed: the proteases PfSUB2 (subtilisin 2) and
PfDPAP2 (Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase 2), the ortholog of the osmiophilic body
component of the rodent malaria gametocytes PbGEST and a previously nonannotated 
13 kDa protein. These results establish that osmiophilic bodies and their
components are dispensable or marginally contribute (PfDPAP2) to gamete egress.
Instead, this work reveals a previously unsuspected role of these organelles in
P. falciparum development in the mosquito vector.
