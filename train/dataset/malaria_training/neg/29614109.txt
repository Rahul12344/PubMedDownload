The malaria-causing blood stage of Plasmodium falciparum requires extracellular
pantothenate for proliferation. The parasite converts pantothenate into coenzyme 
A (CoA) via five enzymes, the first being a pantothenate kinase (PfPanK).
Multiple antiplasmodial pantothenate analogues, including pantothenol and
CJ-15,801, kill the parasite by targeting CoA biosynthesis/utilisation. Their
mechanism of action, however, remains unknown. Here, we show that parasites
pressured with pantothenol or CJ-15,801 become resistant to these analogues.
Whole-genome sequencing revealed mutations in one of two putative PanK genes
(Pfpank1) in each resistant line. These mutations significantly alter PfPanK
activity, with two conferring a fitness cost, consistent with Pfpank1 coding for 
a functional PanK that is essential for normal growth. The mutants exhibit a
different sensitivity profile to recently-described, potent, antiplasmodial
pantothenate analogues, with one line being hypersensitive. We provide evidence
consistent with different pantothenate analogue classes having different
mechanisms of action: some inhibit CoA biosynthesis while others inhibit
CoA-utilising enzymes.
