BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms in the complex gene cluster encoding human
Fc-gamma receptors (FcγRs) may influence malaria susceptibility and pathogenesis.
Studying genetic susceptibility to malaria is ideal among sympatric populations
because the distribution of polymorphic genes among such populations can help in 
the identification malaria candidate genes. This study determined the
distribution of three FcyRs single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
(FcγRIIB-rs1050519, FcγRIIC-rs3933769 and FcγRIIIA-rs396991) among sympatric
Fulani and Dogon children with uncomplicated malaria. The association of these
SNPs with clinical, malariometric and immunological indices was also tested.
METHODS: This study involved 242 Fulani and Dogon volunteers from Mali age under 
15 years. All SNPs were genotyped with predesigned TaqMan(®) SNP Genotyping
Assays. Genotypic and allelic distribution of SNPs was compared across ethnic
groups using the Fisher exact test. Variations in clinical, malariometric and
immunologic indices between groups were tested with Kruskal-Wallis H,
Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher exact test where appropriate.
RESULTS: The study confirmed known malariometric and immunologic differences
between sympatric Fulani and non-Fulani tribes. Parasite density was lower in the
Fulani than the Dogon (p < 0.0001). The mutant allele of FcγRIIC (rs3933769) was 
found more frequently in the Fulani than the Dogon (p < 0.0001) while that of
FcγRIIIA (rs396991) occurred less frequently in the Fulani than Dogon
(p = 0.0043). The difference in the mutant allele frequency of FcγRIIB
(rs1050519) between the two ethnic groups was however not statistically
significant (p = 0.064). The mutant allele of rs396991 was associated with high
malaria-specific IgG1 and IgG3 in the entire study population and Dogon tribe,
p = 0.023 and 0.015, respectively. Parasite burden was lower in carriers of the
FcγRIIC (rs3933769) mutant allele than non-carriers in the entire study
population (p < 0.0001). Carriers of this allele harboured less than half the
parasites found in non-carriers.
CONCLUSION: Differences in the allelic frequencies of rs3933769 and rs396991
among Fulani and Dogon indirectly suggest that these SNPs may influence malaria
susceptibility and pathogenesis in the study population. The high frequency of
the FcγRIIC (rs3933769) mutant allele in the Fulani and its subsequent
association with low parasite burden in the entire study population is
noteworthy.
