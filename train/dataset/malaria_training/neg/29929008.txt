The Arribalzagia Series of the Anopheles Subgenus comprises morphologically
similar species or members of species complexes which makes correct species
identification difficult. Therefore, the aim of this work was to discriminate the
morphospecies of the Arribalzagia Series present in Colombia using a multilocus
approach based on ITS2, COI and CAD sequences. Specimens of the Arribalzagia
Series collected at 32 localities in nine departments were allocated to seven
species. Individual and concatenated Bayesian analyses showed high support for
each of the species and reinforced the previous report of the Apicimacula species
Complex with distribution in the Pacific Coast and northwestern Colombia. In
addition, a new molecular operational taxonomic unit-MOTU was identified, herein 
denominated near Anopheles peryassui, providing support for the existence of a
Peryassui species Complex. Further, the CAD gene, just recently used for
Anopheles taxonomy and phylogeny, demonstrated its power in resolving
phylogenetic relationships among species of the Arribalzagia Series. The
divergence times for these species correspond to the early Pliocene and the
Miocene. Considering the epidemiological importance of some species of the Series
and their co-occurrence in malaria endemic regions of Colombia, their
discrimination constitutes an important step for vector incrimination and control
in the country.
