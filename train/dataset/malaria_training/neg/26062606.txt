We found a 47 aa protein sequence that occurs 17 times in the Plasmodium vivax
nucleotide database published on PlasmoDB. Coding sequence analysis showed
multiple restriction enzyme sites within the 141Â bp nucleotide sequence, and a
His6 tag attached to the 3' end, suggesting cloning vector origins. Sequences
with vector contamination were submitted to NCBI, and BLASTN was used to
cross-examine whole-genome shotgun contigs (WGS) from four recently deposited P. 
vivax whole genome sequencing projects. There are at least 26 genes listed in the
PlasmoDB database that incorporate this cloning vector sequence into their
predicted provisional protein products.
