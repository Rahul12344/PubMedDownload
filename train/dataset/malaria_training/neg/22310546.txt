Mutations in the Pfcrt gene that change the resulting amino acids and form
different haplotypes are common and correlate with the prevalence of chloroquine 
resistant (CQR) field isolates of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum.
This correlation provides opportunities to infer the global evolutionary history 
of CQ resistance by analysing CQR Pfcrt haplotype data. We collated data on the
Pfcrt haplotypes from different global studies and performed evolutionary genetic
analysis to present comprehensive and comparative information on the global
distribution of five major CQR-Pfcrt haplotypes and evolutionary
inter-relationships among 38 different countries. Using the haplotype diversity
data, inter-continental genetic differentiation was also ascertained.
