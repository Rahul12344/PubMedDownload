BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax malaria remains a major public health burden in
Myanmar. Resistance to chloroquine (CQ), the first-line treatment for P. vivax,
has been reported in the country and has potential to undermine local control
efforts.
METHODS: Patients over 6 years of age with uncomplicated P. vivax mono-infection 
were enrolled into clinical efficacy studies in Myawaddy in 2014 and Kawthoung in
2012. Study participants received a standard dose of CQ (25 mg/kg over 3 days)
followed by weekly review until day 28. Pvmdr1 copy number (CN) and
microsatellite diversity were assessed on samples from the patients enrolled in
the clinical study and additional cross-sectional surveys undertaken in Myawaddy 
and Shwegyin in 2012.
RESULTS: A total of 85 patients were enrolled in the CQ clinical studies, 25 in
Myawaddy and 60 in Kawthoung. One patient in Myawaddy (1.2%) had an early
treatment failure and two patients (2.3%) in Kawthoung presented with late
treatment failures on day 28. The day 28 efficacy was 92.0% (95% CI 71.6-97.9) in
Myawaddy and 98.3% (95% CI 88.7-99.8) in Kawthoung. By day 2, 92.2% (23/25) in
Myawaddy and 85.0% (51/60) in Kawthoung were aparasitaemic. Genotyping and pvmdr1
CN assessment was undertaken on 43, 52 and 46 clinical isolates from Myawaddy,
Kawthoung and Shwegyin respectively. Pvmdr1 amplification was observed in 3.2%
(1/31) of isolates in Myawaddy, 0% (0/49) in Kawthoung and 2.5% (1/40) in
Shwegyin. Diversity was high in all sites (H E 0.855-0.876), with low
inter-population differentiation (F ST 0.016-0.026, P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment failures after chloroquine were observed following
chloroquine monotherapy, with pvmdr1 amplification present in both Myawaddy and
Shwegyin. The results emphasize the importance of ongoing P. vivax drug
resistance surveillance in Myanmar, particularly given the potential connectivity
between parasite population at different sites.
