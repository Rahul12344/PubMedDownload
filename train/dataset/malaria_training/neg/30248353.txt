OBJECTIVES: To dissect the transcriptional networks underpinning immune cells
responses during primary Plasmodium vivax infection of healthy human adults.
METHODS: We conducted network co-expression analysis of next-generation RNA
sequencing data from whole blood from P. vivax and P. falciparum controlled human
malaria infection (CHMI) of healthy naïve and malaria-exposed volunteers. Single 
cell transcription signatures were used to deconvolute the bulk RNA-Seq data into
cell-specific signals.
RESULTS: Initial exposure to P. vivax induced activation of innate immunity,
including efficient antigen presentation and complement activation. However, this
effect was accompanied by strong immunosuppression mediated by dendritic cells
via the induction of Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase 1(IDO1) and Lymphocyte
Activation Gene 3 (LAG3). Additionally, P. vivax induced depletion of neutrophil 
populations associated with down regulation of 3G-protein coupled receptors,
CRXCR1, CXCR2 and CSF3R. Accordingly, in malaria-exposed volunteers the
inflammatory response was attenuated, with a decreased class II antigen
presentation in dendritic cells. While the immunosuppressive signalling was
maintained between plasmodium species, response to P. falciparum was
significantly more immunogenic.
CONCLUSIONS: In silico analyses suggest that primary infection with P. vivax
induces potent immunosuppression mediated by dendritic cells, conditioning
subsequent anti-malarial immune responses. Targeting immune evasion mechanisms
could be an effective alternative for improving vaccine efficacy.
