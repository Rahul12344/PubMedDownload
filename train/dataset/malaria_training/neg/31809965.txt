BACKGROUND: Imported cases of infectious disease provide invaluable information
about epidemiological conditions abroad, and should guide treatment decisions at 
home and abroad. Here, we examined cases of malaria imported from Africa to China
for mutations eroding the efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), sometimes
used as an intermittent preventive treatment during for pregnant women and
infants.
METHODS: A total of 208 blood samples were collected from P. falciparum-infected 
workers who had returned from Western and Central Africa to Guangxi Province
Frequency distribution. Samples were analyzed for the mutations in dhfr and dhps 
genes by PCR -sequencing. The prevalence of dhfr and dhps polymorphisms was
analyzed. Among the isolates, polymorphisms were detected in mutants N51I, C59R, 
S108N and I164L of Pfdhfr and I431V, S436 A/F, A437G, K540 E/N, A581G and A613T
of pfdhps.
RESULTS: Mutations promoting drug resistance were widespread in this cohort. For 
pfdhfr and pfdhps, wild types were equally rare among patients returned from
Western Africa and Central Africa. A triple-mutant dhfr haplotype was most
prevalent (>70%). We report for the first time mutation I164L-dhfr and I431V-dhps
in Ghana, and for the first time we found A581G to exceed a clinically-relevant
threshold that may counter-indicate current clinical practices. For Pfdhps, the
double-mutant IAGKAA was high prevalent haplotype in Ghana, Western Africa. The
single-mutant ISGKAA was a majority haplotype in Cameroon. Alarmingly, a "super
resistance" quintuple mutant was detected, for the first time, in parasites of
West African origin (defined by IAGKAA/IRNI in combination with pfdhps 581G and
dhfr I164L). This may limit the efficacy of this drug combination for even
intermittent clinical applications.
CONCLUSIONS: These data are cause for great concern and call for continued
surveillance of the efficacy of SP in source and recipient populations, and
should be considered when developing treatment policy for imported malaria cases 
in China and elsewhere.
