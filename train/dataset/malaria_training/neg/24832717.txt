Music and science have always been my passion. Ultimately, though, the scale was 
tipped in favor of science. And I lived out my science dreams in trying to grasp 
as many facets of it as possible. As a biologist, I didn't stay in one stream and
thus, I have embraced not only molecular biology but parasitology as well. This
was way back 1980s, when such a research career was viewed highly unusual in a
Japanese context. My commitment to malaria and vaccine development follows the
same path. I believe one has to integrate knowledge on a wide variety of academic
fields--gene expressions, protein structure, epidemiology, immunology--to achieve
significant success. Similar to life itself, one has to be prepared well to be
able to accept and interpret as widely as possible what one may term as
"accidental results" or "accidental elements."
