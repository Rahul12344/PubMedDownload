BACKGROUND: Plasmodium ovale curtisi and wallikeri are perceived as relapsing
malarial parasites. Contrary to Plasmodium vivax, direct evidence for this
hypothesis is scarce. The aim of this prospective study was to characterize the
reappearance patterns of ovale parasites.
METHODS: P. ovale spp. infected patients were treated with
artemether-lumefantrine and followed biweekly for up to 1 year for the detection 
of reappearing parasitemia. Molecular analysis of reappearing isolates was
performed to identify homologous isolates by genotyping and to define cases of
relapse following predefined criteria.
RESULTS: At inclusion, 26 participants were positive for P. ovale curtisi and/or 
P. ovale wallikeri. The median duration of follow-up was 35 weeks. Reappearance
of the same P. ovale species was observed in 46% of participants; 61% of P. ovale
curtisi and 19% of P. ovale wallikeri infection-free intervals were estimated to 
end with reappearance by week 32. Based on the predefined criteria, 23% of
participants were identified with 1 or 2 relapses, all induced by P. ovale
curtisi.
CONCLUSION: These findings are in line with the currently accepted relapse theory
inasmuch as the reappearance of P. ovale curtisi strains following initial blood 
clearance was conclusively demonstrated. Interestingly, no relapse of P. ovale
wallikeri was observed.
