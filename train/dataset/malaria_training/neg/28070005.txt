Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax have varying transmission dynamics
that are informed by molecular epidemiology. This study aimed to determine the
complexity of infection and genetic diversity of P. vivax and P. falciparum
throughout Papua New Guinea (PNG) to evaluate transmission dynamics across the
country. In 2008-2009, a nationwide malaria indicator survey collected 8,936
samples from all 16 endemic provinces of PNG. Of these, 892 positive P. vivax
samples were genotyped at PvMS16 and PvmspF3, and 758 positive P. falciparum
samples were genotyped at Pfmsp2. The data were analyzed for multiplicity of
infection (MOI) and genetic diversity. Overall, P. vivax had higher polyclonality
(71%) and mean MOI (2.32) than P. falciparum (20%, 1.39). These measures were
significantly associated with prevalence for P. falciparum but not for P. vivax. 
The genetic diversity of P. vivax (PvMS16: expected heterozygosity = 0.95,
0.85-0.98; PvMsp1F3: 0.78, 0.66-0.89) was higher and less variable than that of
P. falciparum (Pfmsp2: 0.89, 0.65-0.97). Significant associations of MOI with
allelic richness (rho = 0.69, P = 0.009) and expected heterozygosity (rho = 0.87,
P < 0.001) were observed for P. falciparum. Conversely, genetic diversity was not
correlated with polyclonality nor mean MOI for P. vivax. The results demonstrate 
higher complexity of infection and genetic diversity of P. vivax across the
country. Although P. falciparum shows a strong association of these parameters
with prevalence, a lack of association was observed for P. vivax and is
consistent with higher potential for outcrossing of this species.
