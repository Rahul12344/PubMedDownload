BACKGROUND: Malaria is associated with haemolysis and the release of plasma haem.
Plasma haem can cause endothelial injury and organ dysfunction, and is normally
scavenged by haemopexin to limit toxicity. It was hypothesized that dysregulation
of the haem-haemopexin pathway contributes to severe and fatal malaria
infections.
METHODS: Plasma levels of haemin (oxidized haem), haemopexin, haptoglobin, and
haemoglobin were quantified in a case-control study of Ugandan children with
Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Levels at presentation were compared in children
with uncomplicated malaria (UM; n = 29), severe malarial anaemia (SMA; n = 27) or
cerebral malaria (CM; n = 31), and evaluated for utility in predicting fatal
(n = 19) vs non-fatal (n = 39) outcomes in severe disease. A causal role for
haemopexin was assessed in a pre-clinical model of experimental cerebral malaria 
(ECM), following disruption of mouse haemopexin gene (hpx). Analysis was done
using Kruskall Wallis tests, Mann-Whitney tests, log-rank tests for survival, and
repeated measures ANOVA.
RESULTS: In Ugandan children presenting with P. falciparum malaria, haemin levels
were higher and haemopexin levels were lower in SMA and CM compared to children
with UM (haemin, p < 0.01; haemopexin, p < 0.0001). Among all cases of severe
malaria, elevated levels of haemin and cell-free haemoglobin at presentation were
associated with subsequent mortality (p < 0.05). Compared to ECM-resistant BALB/c
mice, susceptible C57BL/6 mice had lower circulating levels of haemopexin
(p < 0.01), and targeted deletion of the haemopexin gene, hpx, resulted in
increased mortality compared to their wild type littermates (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that plasma levels of haemin and haemopexin
measured at presentation correlate with malaria severity and levels of haemin and
cell-free haemoglobin predict outcome in paediatric severe malaria. Mechanistic
studies in the ECM model support a causal role for the haem-haemopexin axis in
ECM pathobiology.
