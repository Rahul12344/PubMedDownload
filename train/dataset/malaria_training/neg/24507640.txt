OBJECTIVE: To determine the distribution of Duffy blood group genotypes in
Balouch population as a major ethnic group that living in a sub-tropical area in 
south East of Iran.
METHODS: In this study, the Duffy blood group FY phenotypes were determined using
indirect anti-globulin technique and also genotype by PCR-RFLP in 160 vivax
malaria patients and 160 control individuals.
RESULTS: The results showed that the most common Duffy genotype was FYA/FYB
(46.6%) followed by FYA/FYA (15.3%), FYA/FYO (14.4%), FYB/FYO (11.9%), FYB/FYB
(10%) and FYO/FYO (1.9%). In case individuals, frequency of FYA, FYB and FYO
alleles were 0.471, 0.431 and 0.097, respectively compaired to 0.444, 0.353 and
0.203, respectively in control (non-infected) group.
CONCLUSIONS: This data provide evidence that individuals with the FYA/FYB
genotype have higher susceptibility to malaria and there are significant
associations between Duffy blood group variants and susceptibility or resistance 
to vivax malaria.
