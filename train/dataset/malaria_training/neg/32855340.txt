Hemocytes limit the capacity of mosquitoes to transmit human pathogens. Here we
profile the transcriptomes of 8506 hemocytes of Anopheles gambiae and Aedes
aegypti mosquito vectors. Our data reveal the functional diversity of hemocytes, 
with different subtypes of granulocytes expressing distinct and evolutionarily
conserved subsets of effector genes. A previously unidentified cell type in An.
gambiae, which we term "megacyte," is defined by a specific transmembrane protein
marker (TM7318) and high expression of lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis 
factor-α transcription factor 3 (LL3). Knockdown experiments indicate that LL3
mediates hemocyte differentiation during immune priming. We identify and validate
two main hemocyte lineages and find evidence of proliferating granulocyte
populations. This atlas of medically relevant invertebrate immune cells at
single-cell resolution identifies cellular events that underpin mosquito immunity
to malaria infection.
