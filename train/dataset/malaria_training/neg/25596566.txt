An abnormal calcium-parathyroid hormone (PTH)-vitamin D axis has been reported in
patients with malaria infection. A role for vitamin D in malaria has been
suggested by many studies. Genetic studies have identified numerous factors that 
link vitamin D to malaria, including human leukocyte antigen genes, toll-like
receptors, heme oxygenase-1, angiopoietin-2, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4,
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors, and Bcl-2. Vitamin D
has also been implicated in malaria via its effects on the Bacillus
Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, matrix metalloproteinases, mitogen-activated
protein kinase pathways, prostaglandins, reactive oxidative species, and nitric
oxide synthase. Vitamin D may be important in malaria; therefore, additional
research on its role in malaria is needed.
