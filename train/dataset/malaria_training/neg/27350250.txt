BACKGROUND: Multiplicity and genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum infection
might play a role in determining the clinical outcome of malaria infection and
could be a fair reflection of the disease transmission rate. This study
investigated the genetic diversity of P. falciparum and multiplicity of infection
in relation to the severity of malaria and age of patients in Gezira State,
Sudan.
METHODS: A cross-sectional health facilities-based survey was conducted in Gezira
State, Sudan in January 2012. A total of 140 P. falciparum malaria patients
diagnosed with microscopy and confirmed using nested PCR were recruited and
classified into uncomplicated malaria and severe malaria states according to the 
standard WHO criteria. DNA was extracted and MSP1 and MSP2 allelic families were 
determined using nested PCR.
RESULTS: The overall multiplicity of infection (MOI) was 2.25 and 2.30 and 2.15
for uncomplicated and severe malaria respectively. There were no statistically
significant differences between uncomplicated and severe malaria (SM) patient
groups in MOI with regard to MSP1, MSP2 and overall MOI (Mann-Whitney U-test; all
P < 0.05). The predominant MSP1 allelic families were MAD20 for uncomplicated
malaria and RO33 for severe malaria. The distribution of both FC27 and IC1/3D7
MSP2 allelic families were approximately the same across disease severity. One
hundred and eleven P. falciparum isolates (81 %) consisted of multiple genotypes;
71/90 (78.9 %) in uncomplicated malaria and 40/50 (85.1 %) in severe malaria
patient groups. Neither MSP1 nor MSP2 allelic families showed association with
malaria severity. No statistically significant differences in multiplicity of
infection were observed between different age groups.
CONCLUSION: In this study the majority of P. falciparum isolates from
uncomplicated and severe malaria patients consisted of multiple genotypes.
Further molecular epidemiological studies delineate the link between P.
falciparum genotype with the malaria phenotype in different regions are
encouraged.
