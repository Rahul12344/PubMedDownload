We present case histories of four patients treated with artemether-lumefantrine
for falciparum malaria in UK hospitals in 2015 to 2016. Each subsequently
presented with recurrent symptoms and Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia within 6 
weeks of treatment with no intervening travel to countries where malaria is
endemic. Parasite isolates, all of African origin, harbored variants at some
candidate resistance loci. No evidence of pfk13-mediated artemisinin resistance
was found. Vigilance for signs of unsatisfactory antimalarial efficacy among
imported cases of malaria is recommended.
