Plasmodium falciparum, the primary cause of malaria, contains a
non-photosynthetic plastid called the apicoplast. The apicoplast exists in most
members of the phylum Apicomplexa and has its own genome along with
organelle-specific enzymes for its replication. The only DNA polymerase found in 
the apicoplast (apPOL) was putatively acquired through horizontal gene transfer
from a bacteriophage and is classified as an atypical A-family polymerase. Here, 
we present its crystal structure at a resolution of 2.9Å. P. falciparum apPOL,
the first structural representative of a plastidic A-family polymerase, diverges 
from typical A-family members in two of three previously identified signature
motifs and in a region not implicated by sequence. Moreover, apPOL has an
additional N-terminal subdomain, the absence of which severely diminishes its 3' 
to 5' exonuclease activity. A compound known to be toxic to Plasmodium is a
potent inhibitor of apPOL, suggesting that apPOL is a viable drug target. The
structure provides new insights into the structural diversity of A-family
polymerases and may facilitate structurally guided antimalarial drug design.
