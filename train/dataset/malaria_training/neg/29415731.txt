BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen-1 (PfAMA-1) is one of
leading blood stage malaria vaccine candidates. However, genetic variation and
antigenic diversity identified in global PfAMA-1 are major hurdles in the
development of an effective vaccine based on this antigen. In this study, genetic
structure and the effect of natural selection of PfAMA-1 among Myanmar P.
falciparum isolates were analysed.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 58 Myanmar patients with falciparum
malaria. Full-length PfAMA-1 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and 
cloned into a TA cloning vector. PfAMA-1 sequence of each isolate was sequenced. 
Polymorphic characteristics and effect of natural selection were analysed with
using DNASTAR, MEGA4, and DnaSP programs. Polymorphic nature and natural
selection in 459 global PfAMA-1 were also analysed.
RESULTS: Thirty-seven different haplotypes of PfAMA-1 were identified in 58
Myanmar P. falciparum isolates. Most amino acid changes identified in Myanmar
PfAMA-1 were found in domains I and III. Overall patterns of amino acid changes
in Myanmar PfAMA-1 were similar to those in global PfAMA-1. However, frequencies 
of amino acid changes differed by country. Novel amino acid changes in Myanmar
PfAMA-1 were also identified. Evidences for natural selection and recombination
event were observed in global PfAMA-1. Among 51 commonly identified amino acid
changes in global PfAMA-1 sequences, 43 were found in predicted RBC-binding
sites, B-cell epitopes, or IUR regions.
CONCLUSIONS: Myanmar PfAMA-1 showed similar patterns of nucleotide diversity and 
amino acid polymorphisms compared to those of global PfAMA-1. Balancing natural
selection and intragenic recombination across PfAMA-1 are likely to play major
roles in generating genetic diversity in global PfAMA-1. Most common amino acid
changes in global PfAMA-1 were located in predicted B-cell epitopes where high
levels of nucleotide diversity and balancing natural selection were found. These 
results highlight the strong selective pressure of host immunity on the PfAMA-1
gene. These results have significant implications in understanding the nature of 
Myanmar PfAMA-1 along with global PfAMA-1. They also provide useful information
for the development of effective malaria vaccine based on this antigen.
