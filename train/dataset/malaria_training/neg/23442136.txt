Position effect variegation (PEV) refers to quasi-stable patterns of gene
expression that are observed at specific loci throughout the genomes of
eukaryotes. The genes subjected to PEV can be completely silenced or fully
active. Stochastic conversions between these 2 states are responsible for the
variegated phenotypes. Positional variegation is used by human pathogens
(Trypanosoma, Plasmodium, and Candida) to evade the immune system or adapt to the
host environment. In the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces pombe,
telomeric PEV aids the adaptation to a changing environment. In metazoans,
similar epigenetic conversions are likely to accompany cell differentiation and
the setting of tissue-specific gene expression programs. Surprisingly, we know
very little about the mechanisms of epigenetic conversions. In this article,
earlier models on the nature of PEV are revisited and recent advances on the
dynamic nature of chromatin are reviewed. The normal dynamic histone turnover
during transcription and DNA replication and its perturbation at transcription
and replication pause sites are discussed. It is proposed that such perturbations
play key roles in epigenetic conversions and in PEV.
