Molecular analysis of antifolate resistance-associated genes-dihydrofolate
reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate synthetase (dhps) of Plasmodium vivax is
important in predicting the emergence of drug resistance to
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). The present study aimed to determine the
polymorphism of dhfr and dhps genes in P. vivax field isolates. Samples from 80
microscopically diagnosed vivax malaria cases were collected from endemic areas
of malaria in Hormozgan Province of Iran, from June 2010 to November 2015. The
two sets of codons at position 33, 57, 58, 117, 173 of dhfr and 382, 383, and 553
of dhps genes were analysed by direct sequencing of PCR products. The majority of
the isolates (70%) harboured a wild-type allele for P. vivax dhfr (Pvdhfr) and P.
vivax dhps (Pvdhps). Mutations were detected in three codons of Pvdhfr (P33L,
S58R and S117N) and single codon in Pvdhps (A383G). Novel mutations that have not
been identified previously at codon 459 (D459A) of Pvdhps were also observed. The
high prevalence of point mutation as well as the rising triple mutation of Pvdhfr
and Pvdhps genotypes necessitate change in programmes and guidelines to eliminate
P. vivax in future.
