Antigenic variation, the capacity to produce a range of variable antigens, is a
well-described strategy of Plasmodium and other parasites to evade host immunity.
Here, we show that gene amplification is an additional evasion mechanism used by 
Plasmodium vivax to escape humoral immunity targeting PvDBP, the key ligand
involved in reticulocyte invasion. PvDBP gene amplification leads to increased
mRNA levels and protects P. vivax in vitro against invasion inhibitory human
monoclonal antibodies targeting a conserved binding domain of DBP. Patient
samples suggest that parasites with increased pvdbp copy number are able to
infect individuals with naturally acquired antibodies highlyÂ blocking the binding
of PvDBP to the Duffy receptor. These results show that gene copy number
variation affect the parasite's ability to evade anti-PvDBP humoral immunity.
