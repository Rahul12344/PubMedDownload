Virulence of the most deadly malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is linked to 
the variant surface antigen PfEMP1, which is encoded by about 60 var genes per
parasite genome. Although the expression of particular variants has been
associated with different clinical outcomes, little is known about var gene
expression at the onset of infection. By analyzing controlled human malaria
infections via quantitative real-time PCR, we show that parasite populations from
18 volunteers expressed virtually identical transcript patterns that were
dominated by the subtelomeric var gene group B and, to a lesser extent, group A. 
Furthermore, major changes in composition and frequency of var gene transcripts
were detected between the parental parasite culture that was used to infect
mosquitoes and Plasmodia recovered from infected volunteers, suggesting that P.
falciparum resets its var gene expression during mosquito passage and starts with
the broad expression of a specific subset of var genes when entering the human
blood phase.
