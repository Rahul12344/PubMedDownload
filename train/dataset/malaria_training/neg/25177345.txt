The epigenome of the human malaria vector Anopheles gambiae was characterized in 
midgut cells by mapping the distribution and levels of two post-translational
histone modifications, H3K27ac and H3K27me3. These histone profiles were then
correlated with levels of gene expression obtained by RNA-seq. Analysis of the
transcriptome of A. gambiae midguts and salivary glands led to the discovery of
13,898 new transcripts not present in the most recent genome assembly. A subset
of these transcripts is differentially expressed between midgut and salivary
glands. The enrichment profiles of H3K27ac and H3K27me3 are mutually exclusive
and associate with high and low levels of transcription, respectively. This
distribution agrees with previous findings in Drosophila showing association of
these two histone modifications with either active or inactive transcriptional
states, including Polycomb-associated domains in silenced genes. This study
provides a mosquito epigenomics platform for future comparative studies in other 
mosquito species, opening future investigations into the role of epigenetic
processes in vector-borne systems of medical and economic importance.
