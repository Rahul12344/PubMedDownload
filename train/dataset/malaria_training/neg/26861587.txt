Anopheles gambiae s.s. mosquitoes are efficient vectors for Plasmodium
falciparum, although variation exists in their susceptibility to infection. This 
variation depends partly on the thioester-containing protein 1 (TEP1) and TEP
depletion results in significantly elevated numbers of oocysts in susceptible and
resistant mosquitoes. Polymorphism in the Plasmodium gene coding for the surface 
protein Pfs47 modulates resistance of some parasite laboratory strains to
TEP1-mediated killing. Here, we examined resistance of P. falciparum isolates of 
African origin (NF54, NF165 and NF166) to TEP1-mediated killing in a susceptible 
Ngousso and a refractory L3-5 strain of A. gambiae. All parasite clones
successfully developed in susceptible mosquitoes with limited evidence for an
impact of TEP1 on transmission efficiency. In contrast, NF166 and NF165 oocyst
densities were strongly reduced in refractory mosquitoes and TEP1 silencing
significantly increased oocyst densities. Our results reveal differences between 
African P. falciparum strains in their capacity to evade TEP1-mediated killing in
resistant mosquitoes. There was no significant correlation between Pfs47 genotype
and resistance of a given P. falciparum isolate for TEP1 killing. These data
suggest that polymorphisms in this locus are not the sole mediators of immune
evasion of African malaria parasites.
