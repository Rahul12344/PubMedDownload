BACKGROUND: Antigenic polymorphisms are considered as one of the main strategies 
employed by malaria parasites to escape from the host immune responses after
infections. Merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) of Plasmodium vivax, a promising 
vaccine candidate, is a highly polymorphic protein whose immune recognition is
not well understood.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The IgG responses to conserved (MSP-119) and polymorphic
(block 2 and block 10) epitopes of PvMSP-1 were evaluated in 141 P. vivax
infected patients. Ten recombinant proteins corresponding to block 2 (variants
BR07, BP29, BP39, BP30, BEL) and block 10 (BR07, BP29, BP39, BP01, BP13) often
observed in Brazilian P. vivax isolates were assessed by ELISA in order to
determine levels of specific antibodies and their respective seroprevalence. The 
magnitude and the frequency of variant-specific responses were very low, except
for BR07 variant (>40%), which was the predominant haplotype as revealed by block
10 PvMSP-1 gene sequencing. By contrast, 89% of patients had IgG against the
C-terminal conserved domain (PvMSP-119), confirming the high antigenicity of this
protein. Using multiple linear and logistic regression models, there was evidence
for a negative association between levels of haemoglobin and several IgG
antibodies against block 2 variant antigens, with the strongest association being
observed for BP39 allelic version. This variant was also found to increase the
odds of anaemia in these patients.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings may have implications for vaccine development and
represent an important step towards a better understanding of the polymorphic
PvMSP-1 domain as potential targets of vaccine development. These data highlight 
the importance of extending the study of these polymorphic epitopes of PvMSP-1 to
different epidemiological settings.
