4,4'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) has been re-recommended by the World
Health Organization for malaria mosquito control. Previous DDT use has resulted
in resistance, and with continued use resistance will likely increase in terms of
level and extent. Drosophila melanogaster is a model dipteran with a well
annotated genome allowing both forward and reverse genetic manipulation, numerous
studies done on insecticide resistance mechanisms, and is related to malaria
mosquitoes allowing for extrapolation. The 91-R strain of D. melanogaster is
highly resistant to DDT (>1500-fold) and recently, reduced penetration, increased
detoxification, and direct excretion have been identified as resistance
mechanisms. Their interactions, however, remain unclear. Use of Gal4/UAS-RNAi
transgenic lines of D. melanogaster allowed for the targeted knockdown of genes
putatively involved in DDT resistance and has identified the role of several
cuticular proteins (Cyp4g1 and Lcp1), cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (Cyp6g1 and 
Cyp12d1), and ATP binding cassette transporters (Mdr50, Mdr65, and Mrp1) involved
in decreased sensitivity to DDT. These above findings have been further validated
in 91-R flies using a nanoparticle-enhanced RNAi strategy, directly implication
these genes in DDT resistance in 91-R flies.
