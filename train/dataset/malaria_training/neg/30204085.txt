The mitochondrial ATP synthase is a macromolecular motor that uses the proton
gradient to generate ATP. Proper ATP synthase function requires a stator linking 
the catalytic and rotary portions of the complex. However, sequence-based
searches fail to identify genes encoding stator subunits in apicomplexan
parasites like Toxoplasma gondii or the related organisms that cause malaria.
Here, we identify 11 previously unknown subunits from the Toxoplasma ATP
synthase, which lack homologs outside the phylum. Modeling suggests that two of
them, ICAP2 and ICAP18, are distantly related to mammalian stator subunits. Our
analysis shows that both proteins form part of the ATP synthase complex.
Depletion of ICAP2 leads to aberrant mitochondrial morphology, decreased oxygen
consumption, and disassembly of the complex, consistent with its role as an
essential component of the Toxoplasma ATP synthase. Our findings highlight
divergent features of the central metabolic machinery in apicomplexans, which may
reveal new therapeutic opportunities.
