MOTIVATION: The evolution of resistance in Plasmodium falciparum malaria against 
most available treatments is a major global health threat. Population genetics
approaches are commonly used to model the spread of drug resistance. Due to
uncommon features in malaria biology, existing forward-time population genetics
simulators cannot suitably model Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
RESULTS: Here we present ogaraK, a population genetics simulator for modelling
the spread of drug-resistant malaria. OgaraK is designed to make malaria
simulation computationally tractable as it models infections, not individual
parasites. OgaraK is also able to model the life cycle of the parasite which
includes both haploid and diploid phases and sexual and asexual reproduction. We 
also allow for the simulation of different inbreeding levels, an important
difference between high and low transmission areas and a fundamental factor
influencing the outcome of strategies to control or eliminate malaria.
