A strategy to decrease the vector competence of Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto
(Diptera: Culicidae), the most efficient malaria vector in Africa, may consist of
exploiting the genes involved in zoophily. Crossing and backcrossing experiments 
were performed between An. gambiae s.s. and the zoophilic sibling species
Anopheles quadriannulatus. Mosquito strains were tested in a dual-choice
olfactometer to investigate their responses to cow odour. Totals of 12% of
An. gambiae s.s. and 59% of An. quadriannulatus selected the port with the cow
odour. Crosses and backcrosses did not show a significant preference for the
cow-baited port. The results indicated that anthropophilic behaviour in
An. gambiae s.s. is a dominant or partially dominant trait, which, in conjunction
with the unstable zoophilic behaviour observed in An. quadriannulatus, poses a
serious obstacle to plans to decrease vector competence by modifying the
anthropophilic trait.
