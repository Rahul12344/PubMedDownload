Malaria still has a devastating impact on public health and welfare in Cameroon. 
Despite the increasing number of studies conducted on disease prevalence,
transmission patterns or treatment, there are to date, not enough studies
summarising findings from previous works in order to identify gaps in knowledge
and areas of interest where further evidence is needed to drive malaria
elimination efforts. The present study seeks to address these gaps by providing a
review of studies conducted so far on malaria in Cameroon since the 1940s to
date. Over 250 scientific publications were consulted for this purpose. Although 
there has been increased scale-up of vector control interventions which
significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality to malaria across the country
from a prevalence of 41% of the population reporting at least one malaria case
episode in 2000 to a prevalence of 24% in 2017, the situation is not yet under
control. There is a high variability in disease endemicity between
epidemiological settings with prevalence of Plasmodium parasitaemia varying from 
7 to 85% in children aged 6 months to 15 years after long-lasting insecticidal
nets (LLINs) scale-up. Four species of Plasmodium have been recorded across the
country: Plasmodium falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. vivax. Several
primate-infecting Plasmodium spp. are also circulating in Cameroon. A decline of 
artemisinin-based combinations therapeutic efficacy from 97% in 2006 to 90% in
2016 have been reported. Several mutations in the P. falciparum chloroquine
resistance (Pfcrt) and P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 (Pfmdr1) genes
conferring resistance to either 4-amino-quinoleine, mefloquine, halofanthrine and
quinine have been documented. Mutations in the Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes involved
in sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine are also on the rise. No mutation associated with
artemisinin resistance has been recorded. Sixteen anopheline species contribute
to malaria parasite transmission with six recognized as major vectors: An.
gambiae, An. coluzzii, An. arabiensis, An. funestus, An. nili and An. moucheti.
Studies conducted so far, indicated rapid expansion of DDT, pyrethroid and
carbamate resistance in An. gambiae, An. coluzzii, An. arabiensis and An.
funestus threatening the performance of LLINs. This review highlights the complex
situation of malaria in Cameroon and the need to urgently implement and reinforce
integrated control strategies in different epidemiological settings, as part of
the substantial efforts to consolidate gains and advance towards malaria
elimination in the country.
