BACKGROUND: Insect vectors, namely mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae), are
compulsory for malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) to complete their life cycle. 
Despite this, little is known about vector competence of different mosquito
species for the transmission of avian malaria parasites.
METHODS: In this study, nested PCR was used to determine Plasmodium spp.
occurrence in pools of whole individuals, as well as the diversity of
mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences in wild-caught mosquitoes sampled
across Eastern Austria in 2013-2015.
RESULTS: A total of 45,749 mosquitoes in 2628 pools were collected, of which 169 
pools (6.43%) comprising 9 mosquito species were positive for avian Plasmodium,
with the majority of positives in mosquitoes of Culex pipiens s.l./Culex
torrentium. Six different avian Plasmodium lineages were found, the most common
were Plasmodium vaughani SYAT05, Plasmodium sp. Linn1 and Plasmodium relictum
SGS1. In 2014, mosquitoes of the Culex pipiens complex were genetically
identified and Culex pipiens f. pipiens presented with the highest number of
avian Plasmodium positives (n = 37; 16.74%). Despite this, the minimum infection 
rate (MIR) was highest in Culex torrentium (5.36%) and Culex pipiens f.
pipiens/f. molestus hybrids (5.26%). During 2014 and 2015, seasonal and annual
changes in Plasmodium lineage distribution were also observed. In both years P.
vaughani SYAT05 dominated at the beginning of the sampling period to be replaced 
later in the year by P. relictum SGS1 (2014) and Plasmodium sp. Linn1 (2015).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large-scale study of avian Plasmodium parasites in
Austrian mosquitoes. These results are of special interest, because molecular
identification of the taxa of the Cx. pipiens complex and Cx. torrentium enabled 
the determination of Plasmodium prevalence in the different mosquito taxa and
hybrids of this complex. Since pools of whole insects were used, it is not
possible to assert any vector competence in any of the examined mosquitoes, but
the results are nonetheless valuable in providing an overview of avian Plasmodium
species and lineages present in Austria.
