We recently identified novel Plasmodium berghei (Pb) liver stage (LS) genes that 
as DNA vaccines significantly reduce Pb LS parasite burden (LPB) in C57Bl/6 (B6) 
mice through a mechanism mediated, in part, by CD8 T cells. In this study, we
sought to determine fine antigen (Ag) specificities of CD8 T cells that target LS
malaria parasites. Guided by algorithms for predicting MHC class I-restricted
epitopes, we ranked sequences of 32 Pb LS Ags and selected ~400 peptides
restricted by mouse H-2Kb and H-2Db alleles for analysis in the high-throughput
method of caged MHC class I-tetramer technology. We identified a 9-mer H-2Kb
restricted CD8 T cell epitope, Kb-17, which specifically recognized and activated
CD8 T cell responses in B6 mice immunized with Pb radiation-attenuated
sporozoites (RAS) and challenged with infectious sporozoites (spz). The Kb-17
peptide is derived from the recently described novel protective Pb LS Ag,
PBANKA_1031000 (MIF4G-like protein). Notably, immunization with the Kb-17 epitope
delivered in the form of a minigene in the adenovirus serotype 5 vector reduced
LPB in mice infected with spz. On the basis of our results, Kb-17 peptide was
available for CD8 T cell activation and recall following immunization with Pb RAS
and challenge with infectious spz. The identification of a novel MHC class
I-restricted epitope from the protective Pb LS Ag, MIF4G-like protein, is crucial
for advancing our understanding of immune responses to Plasmodium and by
extension, toward vaccine development against malaria.
