Serologic responses to the PfEMP1 DBL-CIDR head structure may be a better
indicator of malaria exposure than those to the DBL-α tag.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfEMP1)
antigens play a critical role in host immune evasion. Serologic responses to
these antigens have been associated with protection from clinical malaria,
suggesting that antibodies to PfEMP1 antigens may contribute to natural immunity.
The first N-terminal constitutive domain in a PfEMP1 is the Duffy binding-like
alpha (DBL-α) domain, which contains a 300 to 400 base pair region unique to each
particular protein (the DBL-α "tag"). This DBL-α tag has been used as a marker of
PfEMP1 diversity and serologic responses in malaria-exposed populations. In this 
study, using sera from a malaria-endemic region, responses to DBL-α tags were
compared to responses to the corresponding entire DBL-α domain (or "parent"
domain) coupled with the succeeding cysteine-rich interdomain region (CIDR).
METHODS: A protein microarray populated with DBL-α tags, the parent DBL-CIDR head
structures, and downstream PfEMP1 protein fragments was probed with sera from
Malian children (aged 1 to 6 years) and adults from the control arms of apical
membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) vaccine clinical trials before and during a malaria
transmission season. Serological responses to the DBL-α tag and the DBL-CIDR head
structure were measured and compared in children and adults, and throughout the
season.
RESULTS: Malian serologic responses to a PfEMP1's DBL-α tag region did not
correlate with seasonal malaria exposure, or with responses to the parent
DBL-CIDR head structure in either children or adults. Parent DBL-CIDR head
structures were better indicators of malaria exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: Larger PfEMP1 domains may be better indicators of malaria exposure
than short, variable PfEMP1 fragments such as DBL-α tags. PfEMP1 head structures 
that include conserved sequences appear particularly well suited for study as
serologic predictors of malaria exposure.
