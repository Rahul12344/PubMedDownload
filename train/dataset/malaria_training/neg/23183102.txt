The bioinformatics software, Geneious, provides a useful platform for researchers
to retrieve and analyse genomic and functional genomics information. However, the
main databases that the software is able to access are hosted by NCBI (National
Center for Biotechnology Information). The databases of EuPathDB (Eukaryotic
Pathogen Database Resources), such as PlasmoDB and PiroplasmaDB, collect more
specific and detailed information about eukaryotic pathogens than those kept in
NCBI databases. Two plugins for Geneious, one for PlasmaDB and one for
PiroplasmaDB were developed. When installed, users can use search facilities to
find and import gene and protein sequences from the EuPathDB databases. Users can
then use the functions of Geneious to process the sequence information. When
information unique to PlasmoDB and PiroplasmaDB is required, the user can access 
results linked with the gene/protein sequence via the default web browser. The
plugins are freely available from the Victorian Bioinformatics Consortium
website. The plugins can be modified to access any of the databases of EuPathDB.
