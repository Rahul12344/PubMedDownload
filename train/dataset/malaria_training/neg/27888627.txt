OBJECTIVE: Osteosarcoma (OS) is a malignant bone tumor with high morbidity in
young adults and adolescents. This study aimed to discover potential early
diagnosis biomarkers in OS.
RESULTS: In total, 111 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in
primary OS compared with normal controls and 235 DEGs were identified in
metastatic OS compared with primary OS. AURKB and PPP2R2B were the significantly 
up-regulated and down-regulated hub proteins, respectively, in the PPI
protein-protein network (PPI) network of primary OS. ISG15 and BTRC were the
significantly up-regulated and down-regulated hub proteins, respectively, in the 
network of metastatic OS. The DEGs in metastatic OS compared with primary OS were
significantly enriched in the arachidonic acid metabolism, malaria, and chemokine
signaling pathways. Finally, we employed quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
reaction (qRT-PCR) to validate the expression levels of candidate DEGs and the
results indicated that our bioinformatics approach was acceptable.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mRNA expression profiling of 20 subjects was obtained 
through high-throughput RNA-sequencing. DEGs were identified between primary OS
and normal Control, and between primary OS and metastatic OS, respectively.
Functional annotation and PPI networks were used to obtain insights into the
functions of DEGs. qRT-PCR was performed to detect the expression levels of
dysregulated genes in OS.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work might provide groundwork for the further exploration of
tumorigenesis and metastasis mechanisms of OS.
