Malaria parasites run through a complex life cycle in the vertebrate host and
mosquito vector. This not only requires tightly controlled mechanisms to govern
stage-specific gene expression but also necessitates effective strategies for
survival under changing environmental conditions. In recent years, the
combination of different -omics approaches and targeted functional studies
highlighted that Plasmodium falciparum blood stage parasites use
heterochromatin-based gene silencing as a unifying strategy for clonally variant 
expression of hundreds of genes. In this article, we describe the epigenetic
control mechanisms that mediate alternative expression states of genes involved
in antigenic variation, nutrient uptake and sexual conversion and discuss the
relevance of this strategy for the survival and transmission of malaria
parasites.
