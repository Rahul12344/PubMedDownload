The ability of the human malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum to adapt to
environmental changes depends considerably on its ability to maintain
within-population genetic variation. Strong selection, consequent to widespread
antimalarial drug usage, occasionally elicits a rapid expansion of drug-resistant
isolates, which can act as founders. To investigate whether this phenomenon
induces a loss of within-population genetic variation, we performed a population 
genetic analysis on 302â€‰P. falciparum cases detected during two cross-sectional
surveys in 2002/2003, just after the official introduction of
sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine as a first-line treatment, and again in 2010/2011, in 
highly endemic areas in Papua New Guinea. We found that a single-origin
sulphadoxine-resistant parasite isolate rapidly increased from 0% in 2002/2003 to
54% in 2010 and 84% in 2011. However, a considerable number of pairs exhibited
random associations among 10 neutral microsatellite markers located in various
chromosomes, suggesting that outcrossing effectively reduced non-random
associations, albeit at a low average multiplicity of infection (1.35-1.52).
Within-population genetic diversity was maintained throughout the study period.
This indicates that the parasites maintained within-population variation, even
after a clonal expansion of drug-resistant parasites. Outcrossing played a role
in the preservation of within-population genetic diversity despite low levels of 
multiplicity of infection.
