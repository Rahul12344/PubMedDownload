Increasing insecticide resistance in malaria-transmitting vectors represents a
public health threat, but underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, a
data integration approach is used to analyse transcriptomic data from comparisons
of insecticide resistant and susceptible Anopheles populations from disparate
geographical regions across the African continent. An unbiased, integrated
analysis of this data confirms previously described resistance candidates but
also identifies multiple novel genes involving alternative resistance mechanisms,
including sequestration, and transcription factors regulating multiple downstream
effector genes, which are validated by gene silencing. The integrated datasets
can be interrogated with a bespoke Shiny R script, deployed as an interactive
web-based application, that maps the expression of resistance candidates and
identifies co-regulated transcripts that may give clues to the function of novel 
resistance-associated genes.
