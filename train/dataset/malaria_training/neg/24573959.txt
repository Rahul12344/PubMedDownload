OBJECTIVES: The aims of this work are to provide first data on novel STRs at the 
NOS gene regions in human populations and to test for possible correlations with 
mortality rate by malaria in different areas of Sardinia (Italy).
METHODS: In the present study, 16 STRs (13 analyzed for the first time in human
populations) localized on three genes NOS were typed in 213 healthy individuals, 
unrelated for at least three generations, from six historical-geographical
Sardinian areas. STRs alleles were determined through sequencing. Statistical
analyses were performed by Genepop (v.4.0), Arlequin (v.3.5.1.2), R (v.2.15.1),
Statistica (v.5.1), and PHASE (v.2.1) software packages.
RESULTS: The number of alleles found for each locus ranged from 2 to 12 and their
distribution is most often unimodal. All populations met Hardy Weinberg
equilibrium after Bonferroni correction, with few exceptions. Analysis of genetic
distances did not show strong genetic structuring of the investigated
populations. Instead, the population genetic variability shows a positive and
highly significant (P-value < 0.01) correlation between mortality determined by
malaria infection and alleles (TGGA)7 of NOS2, (AAAAG)2 and (ATTT)10 of adNOS1,
and (AAACA)11 of adNOS3 genes.
CONCLUSIONS: The peculiar allele distribution found for several NOS alleles could
be due to malaria infection that may have contributed to their frequencies, but
we cannot exclude that the peculiar allele distribution of NOS might also be due 
to genetic drift, emphasized by isolation and founder effect.
