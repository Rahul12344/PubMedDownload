The functional characterisation of essential genes in apicomplexan parasites,
such as Toxoplasma gondii or Plasmodium falciparum, relies on conditional
mutagenesis systems. Here we present a novel strategy based on U1 snRNP-mediated 
gene silencing. U1 snRNP is critical in pre-mRNA splicing by defining the
exon-intron boundaries. When a U1 recognition site is placed into the 3'-terminal
exon or adjacent to the termination codon, pre-mRNA is cleaved at the 3'-end and 
degraded, leading to an efficient knockdown of the gene of interest (GOI). Here
we describe a simple method that combines endogenous tagging with DiCre-mediated 
positioning of U1 recognition sites adjacent to the termination codon of the GOI 
which leads to a conditional knockdown of the GOI upon rapamycin-induction.
Specific knockdown mutants of the reporter gene GFP and several endogenous genes 
of T. gondii including the clathrin heavy chain gene 1 (chc1), the vacuolar
protein sorting gene 26 (vps26), and the dynamin-related protein C gene (drpC)
were silenced using this approach and demonstrate the potential of this
technology. We also discuss advantages and disadvantages of this method in
comparison to other technologies in more detail.
