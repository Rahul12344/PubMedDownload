Mixed infections of different species and genetic lineages of haemosporidian
parasites (Haemosporida) predominate in wildlife, and such infections are
particularly virulent. However, currently used polymerase chain reaction
(PCR)-based detection methods often do not read mixed infections. Sensitivity of 
different PCR assays in detection of mixed infections has been insufficiently
tested, but this knowledge is essential in studies addressing parasite diversity 
in wildlife. Here, we applied five different PCR assays, which are broadly used
in wildlife avian haemosporidian research, and compared their sensitivity in
detection of experimentally designed mixed infections of Haemoproteus and
Plasmodium parasites. Three of these PCR assays use primer sets that amplify
fragments of cytochrome b gene (cyt b), one of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI)
gene, and one target apicoplast genome. We collected blood from wild-caught birds
and, using microscopic and PCR-based methods applied in parallel, identified
single infections of ten haemosporidian species with similar parasitemia. Then,
we prepared 15 experimental mixes of different haemosporidian parasites, which
often are present simultaneously in wild birds. Similar concentration of total
DNA was used in each parasite lineage during preparation of mixes. Positive
amplifications were sequenced, and the presence of mixed infections was reported 
by visualising double-base calling in sequence electropherograms. This study
shows that the use of each single PCR assay markedly underestimates biodiversity 
of haemosporidian parasites. The application of at least 3 PCR assays in parallel
detected the majority, but still not all lineages present in mixed infections. We
determined preferences of different primers in detection of parasites belonging
to different genera of haemosporidians during mixed infections.
