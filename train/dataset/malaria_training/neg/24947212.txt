Malaria is an infectious disease that is widespread in tropical and subtropical
regions. The malaria parasite is able to skip the host immunity and thus
maintains not only persistent but also repeated infections. There are a number of
multigene families in Plasmodium that code for the variant antigens and are
targets for protective immunity. In this article, we summarize the virulence
genes of P. falciparum (var genes) and P. vivax (vir genes) which play key roles 
in disease pathogenesis by evading elimination by the host immune system. These
genes occurring within the parasite population are mostly present in the
subtelomeric regions of the chromosome.
