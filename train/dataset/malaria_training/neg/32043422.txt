We identified the biosynthetic gene cluster for lucilactaene, a cell cycle
inhibitor from a filamentous fungus Fusarium sp. RK 97-94. The luc1 knockout
strain accumulated demethylated analogs, indicating the involvement of Luc1
methyltransferase in lucilactaene biosynthesis. Lucilactaene showed potent
antimalarial activity. Our data suggested that methylation and ether ring
formation are essential for its potent antimalarial activity.
