Control of the malaria vector An. gambiae is still largely obtained through
chemical intervention using pyrethroids, such as permethrin. However, strains of 
An. gambiae that are resistant to the toxic effects of pyrethroids have become
widespread in several endemic areas over the last decade. The objective of this
study was to assess differences in five life-history traits (larval developmental
time and the body weight, fecundity, hatch rate, and longevity of adult females) 
and energy metabolism between a strain of An. gambiae that is resistant to
permethrin (RSP), due to knockdown resistance and enhanced metabolic
detoxification, and a permethrin susceptible strain reared under laboratory
conditions. We also quantified the expression levels of five antioxidant enzyme
genes: GSTe3, CAT, GPXH1, SOD1, and SOD2. We found that the RSP strain had a
longer developmental time than the susceptible strain. Additionally, RSP adult
females had higher wet body weight and increased water and glycogen levels.
Compared to permethrin susceptible females, RSP females displayed reduced
metabolic rate and mitochondrial coupling efficiency and higher mitochondrial ROS
production. Furthermore, despite higher levels of GSTe3 and CAT transcripts, RSP 
females had a shorter adult life span than susceptible females. Collectively,
these results suggest that permethrin resistance alleles might affect energy
metabolism, oxidative stress, and adult survival of An. gambiae. However, because
the strains used in this study differ in their genetic backgrounds, the results
need to be interpreted with caution and replicated in other strains to have
significant implications for malaria transmission and vector control.
