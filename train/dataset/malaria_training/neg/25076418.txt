SUMMARY Erythrocytes are extensively remodelled by the malaria parasite following
invasion of the cell. Plasmodium falciparum encodes numerous virulence-associated
and host-cell remodelling proteins that are trafficked to the cytoplasm, the cell
membrane and the surface of the infected erythrocyte. The export of soluble
proteins relies on a sequence directing entry into the secretory pathways in
addition to an export signal. The export signal consisting of five amino acids is
termed the Plasmodium export element (PEXEL) or the vacuole transport signal
(VTS). Genome mining studies have revealed that PEXEL/VTS carrying protein
families have expanded dramatically in P. falciparum compared with other malaria 
parasite species, possibly due to lineage-specific expansion linked to the unique
requirements of P. falciparum for host-cell remodelling. The functional
characterization of such genes and gene families may reveal potential drug
targets that could inhibit protein trafficking in infected erythrocytes. This
review highlights some of the recent advances and key knowledge gaps in protein
trafficking pathways in P. falciparum-infected red cells and speculates on the
impact of exported gene families in the trafficking pathway.
