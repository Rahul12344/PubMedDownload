Proteins interacting with DNA are fundamental for mediating processes such as
gene expression, DNA replication and maintenance of genome integrity.
Accumulating evidence suggests that the chromatin of apicomplexan parasites, such
as Plasmodium falciparum, is highly organized, and this structure provides an
epigenetic mechanism for transcriptional regulation. To investigate how parasite 
chromatin structure is being regulated, we undertook comparative genomics
analysis using 12 distinct eukaryotic genomes. We identified conserved and
parasite-specific chromatin-associated domains (CADs) and proteins (CAPs). We
then used the chromatin enrichment for proteomics (ChEP) approach to
experimentally capture CAPs in P. falciparum. A topological scoring analysis of
the proteomics dataset revealed stage-specific enrichments of CADs and CAPs.
Finally, we characterized, two candidate CAPs: a conserved homologue of the
structural maintenance of chromosome 3 protein and a homologue of the
crowded-like nuclei protein, a plant-like protein functionally analogous to
animal nuclear lamina proteins. Collectively, our results provide a comprehensive
overview of CAPs in apicomplexans, and contribute to our understanding of the
complex molecular components regulating chromatin structure and genome
architecture in these deadly parasites.
