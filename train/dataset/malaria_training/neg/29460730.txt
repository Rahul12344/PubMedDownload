False-negative results for Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein (HRP)
2-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are increasing in Eritrea. We investigated 
HRP gene 2/3 (pfhrp2/pfhrp3) status in 50 infected patients at 2 hospitals. We
showed that 80.8% (21/26) of patients at Ghindae Hospital and 41.7% (10/24) at
Massawa Hospital were infected with pfhrp2-negative parasites and 92.3% (24/26)
of patients at Ghindae Hospital and 70.8% (17/24) at Massawa Hospital were
infected with pfhrp3-negative parasites. Parasite densities between
pfhrp2-positive and pfhrp2-negative patients were comparable. All pfhrp2-negative
samples had no detectable HRP2/3 antigen and showed negative results for
HRP2-based RDTs. pfhrp2-negative parasites were genetically less diverse and
formed 2 clusters with no close relationships to parasites from Peru. These
parasites probably emerged independently by selection in Eritrea. High prevalence
of pfhrp2-negative parasites caused a high rate of false-negative results for
RDTs. Determining prevalence of pfhrp2-negative parasites is urgently needed in
neighboring countries to assist case management policies.
