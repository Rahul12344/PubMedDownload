BACKGROUND: Malaria is a lethal disease causing mortality to over millions each
year. Drug resistance in the malarial parasite spurred effects to discover
effective antimalarial drug targets and drugs. An objective of this current study
is to identify drug targets for malarial parasite. Genes unique, non-homologous
to humans and essential for parasite are identified using BLASTn by comparing
genomes between parasite and host.
OBJECTIVE: Further open BLASTp was used to filter the targets specific to
Plasmodium species and later were subjected to gene property analysis to identify
65 potential targets. Screening of potential drug targets for the drug target
properties like virulence and enzyme identified three drug targets with virulence
property and eleven with enzymatic nature.
METHOD: Thirteen knockouts related to potential drug targets were already tested 
in Plasmodium species, non-Plasmodium species and rodent malaria, lending
credence to our approach. 3-D structures of 27 drug targets were predicted using 
I-tasser server and apicoplast import protein Tic20 is the best modeled protein. 
Gene ontology studies and analysis for motifs on nuclear localization signal
(NLS) established apicoplast import protein Tic20 as an import protein. In silico
docking studies were used to establish the druggability of apicoplast import
protein Tic20.
RESULT AND CONCLUSION: In silico docking studies on 3-D structure generated using
I-tasser with quinine, chloroquine, artesunate into the active site of apicoplast
import protein Tic20 established apicoplast import protein Tic20 as a promising
therapeutic molecular target.
