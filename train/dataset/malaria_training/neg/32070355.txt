BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a public health problem worldwide.
Malaria treatment policy has faced periodic changes due to emergence of drug
resistant parasites. In Sudan chloroquine has been replaced by artesunate and
sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (AS/SP) in 2005 and to artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in 
2017, due to the development of drug resistance. Different molecular markers have
been used to monitor the status of drug resistant P. falciparum. This study aimed
to determine the frequency of malaria drug resistance molecular markers in
Southeast Sudan.
METHODS: The samples of this study were day zero dried blood spot samples
collected from efficacy studies in the Blue Nile State from November 2015 to
January 2016. A total of 130 samples were amplified and sequenced using illumina 
Miseq platform. The molecular markers included were Pfcrt, Pfmdr1, Pfdhfr,
Pfdhps, Pfk13, exonuclease and artemisinin resistant (ART-R) genetic background
(Pfmdr2, ferroredoxine, Pfcrt and Pfarps10).
RESULTS: Resistance markers for chloroquine were detected in 25.8% of the samples
as mutant haplotype Pfcrt 72-76 CVIET and 21.7% Pfmdr1 86Y. Pfdhfr mutations were
detected in codons 51, 59 and 108. The ICNI double-mutant haplotype was the most 
prevalent (69%). Pfdhps mutations were detected in codons 436, 437, 540, 581 and 
613. The SGEGA triple-mutant haplotype was the most prevalent (43%). In
Pfdhfr/Pfdhps combined mutation, quintuple mutation ICNI/SGEGA is the most
frequent one (29%). Six of the seven treatment failure samples had quintuple
mutation and the seventh was quadruple. This was significantly higher from the
adequately responsive group (P < 0.01). Pfk13 novel mutations were found in 7
(8.8%) samples, which were not linked to artemisinin resistance. Mutations in
ART-R genetic background genes ranged from zero to 7%. Exonuclease mutation was
not detected.
CONCLUSION: In this study, moderate resistance to chloroquine and high resistance
to SP was observed. Novel mutations of Pfk13 gene not linked to treatment failure
were described. There was no resistance to piperaquine the partner drug of
dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine (DHA-PPQ).
