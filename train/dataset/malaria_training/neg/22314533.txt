The F423Y mutation in the pfmdr2 gene and mutations N51I, C59R, and S108N in the 
pfdhfr gene are independently associated with pyrimethamine resistance in
Plasmodium falciparum isolates.

Screening for in vitro susceptibility to pyrimethamine and sequencing of the
pfmdr2 and pfdhfr genes were performed in 140 Plasmodium falciparum isolates. The
risk of in vitro resistance to pyrimethamine was analyzed with a logistic
regression model. The mutation F423Y in pfmdr2 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.12
[confidence interval {CI}, 1.02 to 4.59]; P = 0.0489) and the mutation N51I,
C59R, or S108N in pfdhfr (OR = 42.34 [CI, 5.52 to 324.61]; P = 0.0003) were
independently associated with in vitro resistance to pyrimethamine.
