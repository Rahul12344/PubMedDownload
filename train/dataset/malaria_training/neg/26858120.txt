BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the population genetics and transmission dynamics of
Plasmodium vivax is crucial in predicting the emergence of drug resistance,
relapse pattern and novel parasite phenotypes, all of which are relevant to the
control of vivax infections. The aim of this study was to analyse changes in the 
genetic diversity of P. vivax genes from field isolates collected at different
times along the Thai-Myanmar border.
METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-four P. vivax isolates collected during two
periods 10 years apart along the Thai-Myanmar border were analysed. The parasites
were genotyped by nested-PCR and PCR-RFLP targeting selected polymorphic loci of 
Pvmsp1, Pvmsp3α and Pvcsp genes.
RESULTS: The total number of distinguishable allelic variants observed for Pvcsp,
Pvmsp1, and Pvmsp3α was 17, 7 and 3, respectively. High genetic diversity was
observed for Pvcsp (H E = 0.846) and Pvmsp1 (H E = 0.709). Of the 254 isolates,
4.3 and 14.6 % harboured mixed Pvmsp1 and Pvcsp genotypes with a mean
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.06 and 1.15, respectively. The overall
frequency of multiple genotypes was 16.9 %. When the frequencies of allelic
variants of each gene during the two distinct periods were analysed, significant 
differences were noted for Pvmsp1 (P = 0.018) and the Pvcsp (P = 0.033) allelic
variants.
CONCLUSION: Despite the low malaria transmission levels in Thailand, P. vivax
population exhibit a relatively high degree of genetic diversity along the
Thai-Myanmar border of Thailand, in particular for Pvmsp1 and Pvcsp, with
indication of geographic and temporal variation in frequencies for some variants.
These results are of relevance to monitoring the emergence of drug resistance and
to the elaboration of measures to control vivax malaria.
