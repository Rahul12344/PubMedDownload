BACKGROUND: The loss of chloroquine (CQ) effectiveness has led to its withdrawal 
from national policies as a first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in
several endemic countries, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The
K76T mutation on the pfcrt gene has been identified as a marker of CQ resistance 
and the SVMNT haplotype in codons 72-76 on the same gene has been associated with
resistance to amodiaquine (AQ). In the DRC, the prevalence of K76T has decreased 
from 100% in 2000 to 63.9% in 2014. The purpose of this study was to determine
the prevalence of K76T mutations in circulating strains of Plasmodium falciparum,
16 years after CQ withdrawal in the DRC and to investigate the presence of the
SVMNT haplotype.
METHODS: In 2017, ten geographical sites across the DRC were selected. Dried
blood samples were collected from patients attending health centres. Malaria was 
first detected by a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) available on site (SD Bioline
Malaria Ag Pf or CareStart Malaria Pf) or thick blood smear and then confirmed by
a P. falciparum species-specific real-time PCR assay. A pfcrt gene segment
containing a fragment that encodes amino acids at positions 72-76 was amplified
by conventional PCR before sequencing.
RESULTS: A total of 1070 patients were enrolled. Of the 806 PCR-confirmed
P. falciparum positive samples, 764 were successfully sequenced. The K76T
mutation was detected in 218 samples (28.5%; 95% CI 25.4%-31.9%), mainly (96%)
with the CVIET haplotype. Prevalence of CQ resistance marker was unequally
distributed across the country, ranging from 1.5% in Fungurume to 89.5% in
Katana. The SVMNT haplotype, related to AQ resistance, was not detected.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the frequency of the P. falciparum CQ resistance marker has 
decreased significantly and no resistance marker to AQ was detected in the DRC in
2017. However, the between regions variability of CQ resistance remains high in
the country. Further studies are needed for continuous monitoring of the CQ
resistance level for its prospective re-use in malaria management. The absence of
the AQ resistance marker is in line with the use of this drug in the current DRC 
malaria treatment policy.
