Genes for HslVU-type peptidases are found in bacteria and in a few select
Eukaryota, among those such important pathogens as Plasmodium spp. and Leishmania
spp. In this study, we performed replacements of all three HslV/HslU gene
homologues and found one of those, HslV, to be essential for Leishmania donovani 
viability. The Leishmania HslV gene can also partially relieve the
thermosensitive phenotype of a combined HslVU/Lon/ClpXP knockout mutant of
Escherichia coli, indicating a conserved function. However, we found that the
role and function of the two Leishmania HslU genes has diverged since neither of 
those interacts stably with HslV. The latter forms a dodecameric complex by
itself and shows a punctate distribution. We conclude that whilst the basic
function of HslV may be conserved in Leishmania, its organisation and interaction
with its canonical complex partner HslU is not. Nevertheless, given the absence
of HslV from the proteome of mammals and its essential role in Leishmania
viability, HslV is a promising target for intervention.
