Cytochemical staining remains an efficient way of identifying females who are
heterozygous for the X chromosome-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
gene. G6PD is highly polymorphic with certain alleles resulting in low
intracellular G6PD activity in red blood cells. Low intracellular G6PD activity
is associated with a risk of severe hemolysis when exposed to an oxidative stress
such as fava beans, certain drugs and infections. Heterozygous females express
the enzyme from both X-chromosome alleles resulting in two red blood cell
populations each with G6PD enzyme characteristics representative of each allele; 
for example, normal and deficient. Cytochemical staining is the only way to
determine the relative representation of each allele in red blood cells, a
feature that is critical when assessing the risk for severe hemolysis when
exposed to an oxidant such as the anti-malarial drug primaquine. This letter
discusses red blood cell integrity with respect to the cytofluorometric assays
for G6PD activity. An approach to making this test more robust is suggested. The 
approach makes this test more reliable and extends its use to a broader range of 
blood specimens.
