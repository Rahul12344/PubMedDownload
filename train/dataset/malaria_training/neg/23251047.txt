The human malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum is one of the world's most
devastating pathogen. Its capability to regulate its genes under various stages
of its life cycle as well as under unfavourable environmental conditions has led 
to the development of vaccine resistant strains. Similarly, under drug pressure
it develops mutations in the target genes. These mutations confer mid and
high-level resistance to the antimalarial drugs. Increasing a resistance of
malaria parasites to conventional antimalarial drugs is an important factor
contributing to the persistence of the disease as a major health threat. This
article reviews current knowledge of stage specific malarial targets,
antimalarial drugs and the mutations that have led to the emergence of resistant 
strains.
