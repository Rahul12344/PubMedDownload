BACKGROUND: Differentiation between gametocyte-producing Plasmodium falciparum
clones depends on both high levels of stage-specific transcripts and high genetic
diversity of the selected genotyping marker obtained by a high-resolution typing 
method. By analyzing consecutive samples of one host, the contribution of each
infecting clone to transmission and the dynamics of gametocyte production in
multiclone infections can be studied.
METHODS: We have evaluated capillary electrophoresis based differentiation of 6
length-polymorphic gametocyte genes. RNA and DNA of 25 µL whole blood from 46
individuals from Burkina Faso were simultaneously genotyped.
RESULTS: Highest discrimination power was achieved by pfs230 with 18 alleles,
followed by pfg377 with 15 alleles. When assays were performed in parallel on RNA
and DNA, 85.7% of all pfs230 samples and 59.5% of all pfg377 samples contained at
least one matching genotype in DNA and RNA.
CONCLUSIONS: The imperfect detection in both, DNA and RNA, was identified as
major limitation for investigating transmission dynamics, owing primarily to the 
volume of blood processed and the incomplete representation of all clones in the 
sample tested. Abundant low-density gametocyte carriers impede clone
detectability, which may be improved by analyzing larger volumes and detecting
initially sequestered gametocyte clones in follow-up samples.
