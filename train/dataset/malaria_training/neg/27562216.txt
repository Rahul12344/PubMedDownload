BACKGROUND: The use of artemisinin as a monotherapy resulted in the emergence of 
artemisinin resistance in 2005 in Southeast Asia. Monitoring of artemisinin
combination therapy (ACT) is critical in order to detect and prevent the spread
of resistance in endemic areas. Ex vivo studies and genotyping of molecular
markers of resistance can be used as part of this routine monitoring strategy.
One gene that has been associated in some ACT partner drug resistance is the
Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance protein 1 (pfmdr1) gene. The purpose
of this study was to assess the drug susceptibility of P. falciparum populations 
from Thiès, Senegal by ex vivo assay and typing molecular markers of resistance
to drug components of ACT currently used for treatment.
METHODS: The ex vivo susceptibility of 170 P. falciparum isolates to chloroquine,
amodiaquine, lumefantrine, artesunate, and artemether was determined using the
DAPI ex vivo assay. The high resolution melting technique was used to genotype
the pfmdr1 gene at codons 86, 184 and 1246.
RESULTS: A significant decrease in IC50 values was observed between 2012 and
2013: from 13.84 to 6.484 for amodiaquine, 173.4 to 113.2 for lumefantrine, and
39.72 to 18.29 for chloroquine, respectively. Increase of the wild haplotype NYD 
and the decrease of the mutant haplotype NFD (79 and 62.26 %) was also observed. 
A correlation was observed between the wild type allele Y184 in pfmdr1 and higher
IC50 for all drugs, except amodiaquine.
CONCLUSION: This study has shown an increase in sensitivity over the span of two 
transmission seasons, marked by an increase in the WT alleles at pfmdr1.
Continuous the monitoring of the ACT used for treatment of uncomplicated malaria 
will be helpful.
