Molecular markers associated with artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum
are yet to be well defined. Recent studies showed that polymorphisms in K13 gene 
are associated with artemisinin resistance. The present study was designed to
know the pattern of polymorphisms in propeller region of K13 gene among the
clinical isolates collected from urban Kolkata after five years of ACT
implementation. We collected 59 clinical isolates from urban Kolkata and
sequenced propeller region of K13 gene in 51 isolates successfully. We did not
find any mutation in any isolate. All patients responded to the ACT, a
combination of artesunate + sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine. The drug regimen is still
effective in the study area and there is no sign of emergence of resistance
against artemisinin as evidenced by wild genotype of K13 gene in all isolates
studied.
