We present a seminested PCR method that specifically discriminates between
Plasmodium ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri with high sensitivity. The test
is based on species-specific amplification of a size-polymorphic fragment of the 
tryptophan-rich antigen gene, potra, which also permits discrimination of
intraspecific sequence variants at this locus.
