A transmission-blocking vaccine targeting the sexual stages of Plasmodium species
could play a key role in eradicating malaria. Multiple studies have identified
the P. falciparum proteins Pfs25 and Pfs48/45 as prime targets for
transmission-blocking vaccines. Although significant advances have been made in
recombinant expression of these antigens, they remain difficult to produce at
large scale and lack strong immunogenicity as subunit antigens. We linked a
self-assembling protein, granule lattice protein 1 (Grl1p), from the ciliated
protozoan, Tetrahymena thermophila, to regions of the ectodomains of either Pfs25
or Pfs48/45. We found that resulting protein chimera could be produced in E. coli
as nanoparticles that could be readily purified in soluble form. When produced in
the E. coli SHuffle strain, fusion to Grl1p dramatically increased solubility of 
target antigens while at the same time directing the formation of particles with 
diameters centering on 38 and 25 nm depending on the antigen. In a number of
instances, co-expression with chaperone proteins and induction at a lower
temperature further increased expression and solubility. Based on Western
blotting and ELISA analysis, Pfs25 and Pfs48/45 retained their
transmission-blocking epitopes within E. coli-derived particles, and the
particles themselves elicited strong antibody responses in rabbits when given
with an aluminum-based adjuvant. Antibodies against Pfs25-containing
nanoparticles blocked parasite transmission in standard membrane-feeding assays. 
In conclusion, fusion to Grl1p can act as a solubility enhancer for proteins with
limited solubility while retaining correct folding, which may be useful for
applications such as the production of vaccines and other biologics.
