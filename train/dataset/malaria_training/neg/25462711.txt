Malaria remains the major cause of disease morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan
Africa with complex immune responses associated with disease outcomes. Symptoms
associated with severe malaria have generally shown chemokine upregulation but
little is known of responses to uncomplicated malaria. Eight villages in central 
Cameroon of 1045 volunteers were screened. Among these, malaria-positive
individuals with some healthy controls were selected for chemokine analysis using
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kits. Depressed serum levels of CXCL5
and raised CCL28 were observed in malarial positives when compared with healthy
controls. The mean concentration of CXCL11 was higher in symptomatic than
asymptomatic group, while CCL28 was lower in symptomatic individuals. Lower
chemokine levels were associated with symptoms of uncomplicated malaria except
for CXCL11 which was upregulated among fever-positive group. The mean CXCL5 level
was higher in malaria sole infection than co-infections with HIV and Loa loa.
Also, there was a raised mean level of malaria+HIV co-infection for CXCL9. This
study hypothesises a situation where depressed chemokines in the face of clinical
presentations could indicate an attempt by the immune system in preventing a
progression process from uncomplicated to complicated outcomes with CXCL11 being 
identified as possible biomarker for malarial fever.
