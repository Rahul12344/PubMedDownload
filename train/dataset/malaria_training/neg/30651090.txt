BACKGROUND: Bloodstream malaria parasites require Ca++ for their development, but
the sites and mechanisms of Ca++ utilization are not well understood. We
hypothesized that there may be differences in Ca++ uptake or utilization by
genetically distinct lines of P. falciparum. These differences, if identified,
may provide insights into molecular mechanisms.
RESULTS: Dose response studies with the Ca++ chelator EGTA (ethylene
glycol-bis(Î²-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid) revealed stable
differences in Ca++ requirement for six geographically divergent parasite lines
used in previous genetic crosses, with the largest difference seen between the
parents of the HB3 x Dd2 cross. Genetic mapping of Ca++ requirement yielded
complex inheritance in 34 progeny clones with a single significant locus on
chromosome 7 and possible contributions from other loci. Although encoded by a
gene in the significant locus and a proposed Ca++ target, PfCRT (P. falciparum
chloroquine resistance transporter), the primary determinant of clinical
resistance to the antimalarial drug chloroquine, does not appear to contribute to
this quantitative trait. Stage-specific application of extracellular EGTA also
excluded determinants associated with merozoite egress and erythrocyte
reinvasion.
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified differences in Ca++ utilization amongst P.
falciparum lines. These differences are under genetic regulation, segregating as 
a complex trait in genetic cross progeny. Ca++ uptake and utilization throughout 
the bloodstream asexual cycle of malaria parasites represents an unexplored
target for therapeutic intervention.
