Plasmodium falciparum sexual stage surface antigen Pfs25 is a well-established
candidate for malaria transmission-blocking vaccine development. Immunization
with DNA vaccines encoding Pfs25 has been shown to elicit potent antibody
responses in mice and nonhuman primates. Studies aimed at further optimization
have revealed improved immunogenicity through the application of in vivo
electroporation and by using a heterologous prime-boost approach. The goal of the
studies reported here was to systematically evaluate the impact of codon
optimization, in vivo electroporation, and N-linked glycosylation on the
immunogenicity of Pfs25 encoded by DNA vaccines. The results from this study
demonstrate that while codon optimization and in vivo electroporation greatly
improved functional immunogenicity of Pfs25 DNA vaccines, the presence or absence
of N-linked glycosylation did not significantly impact vaccine efficacy. These
findings suggest that N-glycosylation of Pfs25 encoded by DNA vaccines is not
detrimental to overall transmission-blocking efficacy.
