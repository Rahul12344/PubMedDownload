Drug resistance is a recurrent problem in the fight against malaria. Genetic and 
epidemiological surveillance of antimalarial resistant parasite alleles is
crucial to guide drug therapies and clinical management. New antimalarial
compounds are currently at various stages of clinical trials and regulatory
evaluation. Using ∼2000 Plasmodium falciparum genome sequences, we investigated
the genetic diversity of eleven gene-targets of promising antimalarial compounds 
and assessed their potential efficiency across malaria endemic regions. We
determined if the loci are under selection prior to the introduction of new drugs
and established a baseline of genetic variance, including potential resistant
alleles, for future surveillance programmes.
