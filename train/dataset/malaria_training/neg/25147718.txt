BACKGROUND: Genetic diversity has provided Plasmodium falciparum with the
potential capacity of avoiding the immune response, and possibly supported the
natural selection of drug or vaccine-resistant parasites. Merozoite surface
protein-3 (MSP-3) has been used to develop vaccines and investigate the genetic
diversity regarding P. falciparum malaria in Iran.
OBJECTIVES: The main goal of this study was to analyze the polymorphic antigen
MSP-3 genes across southeast of Iran among four different districts, to identify 
the differences in the allele frequency and genetic diversity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nested polymerase chain reaction amplification was used to
determine polymorphisms of N-terminal region of the MSP-3 gene. A total of 85
microscopically positive P. falciparum infected individuals from southeast of
Iran were included in this study.
RESULTS: Of the 85 confirmed P. falciparum samples obtained from four different
districts, 72 were successfully scored for MSP-3.The MSP-3 allele classes (K1 and
3D7 types) showed comparable prevalence in all districts. Overall frequencies of 
K1 and 3D7 allele classes were 94.5 % for both.
CONCLUSIONS: Since no study has yet looked at the extent of P. falciparum MSP-3
in this geographic region, these data can be helpful to support development of a 
vaccine based on MSP-3 against malaria. There should be a comparative analysis in
different seasonal peaks to indicate the allelic polymorphism of MSP-3 over a
period.
