The biosynthesis gene cluster of the xenortides and a new derivative, xenortide
D, which is produced in only trace amounts, was identified in Xenorhabdus
nematophila. The structure of xenortide D was elucidated using a combination of
labeling experiments followed by MS analysis and was confirmed by synthesis.
Bioactivity tests revealed a weak activity of tryptamine-carrying xenortides
against Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma brucei.
