Malaria threatens millions of people annually and is a burden to human health and
economic development. Unfortunately in terms of disease control, no effective
vaccines are available and the efficacy of treatment is limited by drug
resistance. Genetic manipulation in Plasmodium falciparum is hampered due to the 
absence of robust methods for genetic analyses. Electroporation-based
transfection methods have allowed the study of gene function in P. falciparum,
with low efficiency. A lipid nanoparticle was developed that allowed nuclear
targeting of pDNA with increased efficiency in reporter assay, compared to
traditional electroporation method. This method has for the first time,
facilitated transfection using both circular and linear DNA in P. falciparum
thereby serving as an alternative to electroporation with an increase in
transfection efficiency. Availability of a robust method for functional genomic
studies in these organisms may be a catalyst for discovery of novel targets for
developing drugs and vaccines.
