Inhibitors of cellular protein kinases have been reported to inhibit the
development of Apicomplexan parasites, suggesting that the functions of protozoan
protein kinases are critical for their life cycle. However, the specific roles of
these protein kinases cannot be determined using only these inhibitors without
molecular analysis, including gene disruption. In this report, we describe the
functions of Apicomplexan protein kinases in each parasite life stage and the
potential of pre-existing protein kinase inhibitors as Apicomplexan drugs
against, mainly, Plasmodium and Toxoplasma.
