The anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a highly conserved
multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls mitotic division in eukaryotic
cells by tagging cell cycle regulators for proteolysis. APC3 is a key component
that contributes to APC/C function. Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria,
undergoes atypical mitotic division during its life cycle. Only a small subset of
APC/C components has been identified in Plasmodium and their involvement in
atypical cell division is not well understood. Here, using reverse genetics we
examined the localisation and function of APC3 in Plasmodium berghei. APC3 was
observed as a single focus that co-localised with the centriolar plaque during
asexual cell division in schizonts, whereas it appeared as multiple foci in male 
gametocytes. Functional studies using gene disruption and conditional knockdown
revealed essential roles of APC3 during these mitotic stages with loss resulting 
in a lack of chromosome condensation, abnormal cytokinesis and absence of
microgamete formation. Overall, our data suggest that Plasmodium utilises unique 
cell cycle machinery to coordinate various processes during endomitosis, and this
warrants further investigation in future studies.
