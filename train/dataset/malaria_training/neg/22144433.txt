The geographical distribution of genetic variation in Plasmodium vivax samples (N
= 386) from nine districts across Sri Lanka is described using three markers; the
P. vivax merozoite surface protein-3α (Pvmsp-3α) gene, and the two
microsatellites m1501 and m3502. At Pvmsp-3α, 11 alleles were found with an
expected heterozygosity (H(e)) of 0.81, whereas at m1501 and m3502, 24 alleles
(H(e) = 0.85) and 8 alleles (H(e) = 0.74) were detected, respectively. Overall,
95 unique three locus genotypes were detected among the 279 samples positive at
all three loci (H(e) = 0.95). Calculating the pairwise fixation index (F(ST))
revealed statistically significant population structure. The presence of
identical 2-loci microsatellite genotypes in a significant proportion of samples 
revealed local clusters of closely related isolates contributing to strong
linkage disequilibrium between marker alleles. The results show evidence of high 
genetic diversity and possible population substructure of P. vivax populations in
Sri Lanka.
