The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and related organisms possess a relict
plastid known as the apicoplast. Apicoplast protein synthesis is a validated drug
target in malaria because antibiotics that inhibit translation in prokaryotes
also inhibit apicoplast protein synthesis and are sometimes used for malaria
prophylaxis or treatment. We identified components of an indirect aminoacylation 
pathway for Gln-tRNA(Gln) biosynthesis in Plasmodium that we hypothesized would
be essential for apicoplast protein synthesis. Here, we report our
characterization of the first enzyme in this pathway, the apicoplast
glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS). We expressed the recombinant P. falciparum
enzyme in Escherichia coli, showed that it is nondiscriminating because it
glutamylates both apicoplast tRNA(Glu) and tRNA(Gln), determined its kinetic
parameters, and demonstrated its inhibition by a known bacterial GluRS inhibitor.
We also localized the Plasmodium berghei ortholog to the apicoplast in blood
stage parasites but could not delete the PbGluRS gene. These data show that
Gln-tRNA(Gln) biosynthesis in the Plasmodium apicoplast proceeds via an essential
indirect aminoacylation pathway that is reminiscent of bacteria and plastids.
