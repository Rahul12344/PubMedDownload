Chronic infections with the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum depend
on antigenic variation. P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1),
the major erythrocyte surface antigen mediating parasite sequestration in the
microvasculature, is encoded in parasites by a highly diverse family of var
genes. Antigenic switching is mediated by clonal variation in var expression, and
recent in vitro studies have demonstrated a role for epigenetic processes in var 
regulation. Expression of particular PfEMP1 variants may result in parasite
enrichment in different tissues, a factor in the development of severe disease.
Here, we study in vivo human infections and provide evidence that
infection-induced stress responses in the host can modify PfEMP1 expression via
the perturbation of epigenetic mechanisms. Our work suggests that severe disease 
may not be the direct result of an adaptive virulence strategy to maximize
parasite survival but that it may indicate a loss of control of the carefully
regulated process of antigenic switching that maintains chronic infections.
