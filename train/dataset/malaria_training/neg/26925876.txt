Synthetic posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression is important for
understanding fundamental biology and programming new cellular processes in
synthetic biology. Previous strategies for regulating translation in eukaryotes
have focused on disrupting individual steps in translation, including initiation 
and mRNA cleavage. In emphasizing modularity and cross-organism functionality,
these systems are designed to operate orthogonally to native control mechanisms. 
Here we introduce a broadly applicable strategy for robustly controlling protein 
translation by integrating synthetic translational control via a
small-molecule-regulated RNA-protein module with native mechanisms that
simultaneously regulate multiple facets of cellular RNA fate. We demonstrate that
this strategy reduces 'leakiness' to improve overall expression dynamic range,
and can be implemented without sacrificing modularity and cross-organism
functionality. We illustrate this in Saccharomyces cerevisae and the non-model
human malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Given the limited functional
genetics toolkit available for P. falciparum, we establish the utility of this
strategy for defining essential genes.
