We examined the mitogenomes of a large global collection of human malaria
parasites to explore how and when Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax entered the 
Americas. We found evidence of a significant contribution of African and South
Asian lineages to present-day New World malaria parasites with additional P.
vivax lineages appearing to originate from Melanesia that were putatively carried
by the Australasian peoples who contributed genes to Native Americans.
Importantly, mitochondrial lineages of the P. vivax-like species P. simium are
shared by platyrrhine monkeys and humans in the Atlantic Forest ecosystem, but
not across the Amazon, which most likely resulted from one or a few recent
human-to-monkey transfers. While enslaved Africans were likely the main carriers 
of P. falciparum mitochondrial lineages into the Americas after the conquest,
additional parasites carried by Australasian peoples in pre-Columbian times may
have contributed to the extensive diversity of extant local populations of P.
vivax.
