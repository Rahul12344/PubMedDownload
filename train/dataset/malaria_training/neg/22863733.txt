We sequenced and annotated the genomes of four P. vivax strains collected from
disparate geographic locations, tripling the number of genome sequences available
for this understudied parasite and providing the first genome-wide perspective of
global variability in this species. We observe approximately twice as much SNP
diversity among these isolates as we do among a comparable collection of isolates
of P. falciparum, a malaria-causing parasite that results in higher mortality.
This indicates a distinct history of global colonization and/or a more stable
demographic history for P. vivax relative to P. falciparum, which is thought to
have undergone a recent population bottleneck. The SNP diversity, as well as
additional microsatellite and gene family variability, suggests a capacity for
greater functional variation in the global population of P. vivax. These findings
warrant a deeper survey of variation in P. vivax to equip disease interventions
targeting the distinctive biology of this neglected but major pathogen.
