Telomere position effect efficiently controls silencing of subtelomeric var
genes, which are involved in antigenic variation in human malaria parasite
Plasmodium falciparum. Although, PfOrc1 has been found to be associated with
PfSir2 in the silencing complex, its function in telomere silencing remained
uncertain especially due to an apparent lack of BAH domain at its amino-terminal 
region. Here we report that PfOrc1 possesses a Sir3/Orc1 like silencing activity.
Using yeast as a surrogate organism we have shown that PfOrc1 could complement
yeast Sir3 activity during telomere silencing in a Sir2 dependent manner. By
constructing a series of chimera between PfOrc1 and ScSir3 we have observed that 
the amino-terminal domain of PfOrc1 harbors silencing activity similar to that
present in the amino-terminal domain of ScSir3. We further generated several
amino-terminal deletion mutants to dissect out such silencing activity and found 
that the first seventy amino acids at the amino-terminal domain are dispensable
for its activity. Thus our results strongly supports that PfOrc1 may have a role 
in telomere silencing in this parasite. This finding will help to decipher the
mechanism of telomere position effect in P. falciparum.
