BACKGROUND: Malaria is the most prevalent communicable disease in Ethiopia, with 
75% of the country's landmass classified as endemic for malaria. Accurate
information on the distribution and clinical prevalence of Plasmodium vivax and
Plasmodium falciparum malaria in endemic areas, as well as in Duffy-negative
populations, is essential to develop integrated control strategies.
METHODS: A total of 390 and 416 community and clinical samples, respectively,
representing different localities and age groups across Ethiopia were examined.
Malaria prevalence was estimated using nested PCR of the 18S rRNA region.
Parasite gene copy number was measured by quantitative real-time PCR and compared
between symptomatic and asymptomatic samples, as well as between
children/adolescents and adults from the local community. An approximately 500-bp
segment of the human DARC gene was amplified and sequenced to identify Duffy
genotype at the -33rd nucleotide position for all the clinical and community
samples.
RESULTS: Plasmodium vivax prevalence was higher in the south while P. falciparum 
was higher in the north. The prevalence of P. vivax and P. falciparum malaria is 
the highest in children compared to adolescents and adults. Four P. vivax
infections were detected among the Duffy-negative samples. Samples from
asymptomatic individuals show a significantly lower parasite gene copy number
than those from symptomatic infections for P. vivax and P. falciparum.
CONCLUSIONS: Geographical and age differences influence the distribution of P.
vivax and P. falciparum malaria in Ethiopia. These findings offer evidence-based 
guidelines in targeting malaria control efforts in the country.
