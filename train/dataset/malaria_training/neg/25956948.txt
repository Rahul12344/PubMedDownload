Babesiosis is an important veterinary and zoonotic tick borne disease caused by
the hemoprotozoan Babesia spp. which infects red blood cell of its vertebrate
host. In order to control the infection, vaccination that targets molecules
involved in the invasion process of red blood cells could provide a good
alternative to chemotherapy. Among these molecules, Apical Membrane Antigen-1
(AMA-1) has been described as an excellent vaccine candidate in Plasmodium spp.
In this paper, we have investigated AMA-1 of Babesia divergens (BdAMA-1) as
vaccine candidate by evaluating its polymorphism and by studying the humoral
response against BdAMA-1 of sheep experimentally infected with B. divergens.
Polymorphism of BdAMA-1 was investigated by sequencing the corresponding gene of 
9 B. divergens isolates from different geographical areas in France. Two Bdama-1 
haplotypes (A and B) could be defined based on 2 non-synonymous point mutations. 
In silico prediction of linear epitopes revealed that the antigenicity of the 2
haplotypes is very similar. Antibody production against the extracellular domain 
of BdAMA-1 is weak and late, between 1 and 5 months after the inoculation of
parasites. Both IgG1 and IgG2 are components of the anti-BdAMA-1 response. These 
results indicate that while BdAMA-1 may not be an immuno-dominant antigen, it
could induce a mixed type 1 and type 2 immune response. In light of these
results, the potential of BdAMA-1 as vaccine candidate is discussed.
