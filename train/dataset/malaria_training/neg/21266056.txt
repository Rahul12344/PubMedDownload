BACKGROUND: The pathogenicity of Plasmodium falciparum is in part due to the
ability of the parasitized red blood cell (pRBC) to adhere to intra-vascular host
cell receptors and serum-proteins. Binding of the pRBC is mediated by Plasmodium 
falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), a large multi-variant
molecule encoded by a family of ≈60 var genes.
METHODS: The study of var gene transcription in the parasite clone FCR3S1.2 was
performed by semi-quantitative PCR and quantitative PCR (qPCR). The expression of
the major PfEMP1 in FCR3S1.2 pRBC was analysed with polyclonal sera in rosette
disruption assays and immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: Transcripts from var1 (FCR3S1.2(var1); IT4var21) and other var genes
were detected by semi-quantitative PCR but results from qPCR showed that one var 
gene transcript dominated over the others (FCR3S1.2(var2); IT4var60). Antibodies 
raised in rats to the recombinant NTS-DBL1α of var2 produced in E. coli
completely and dose-dependently disrupted rosettes (≈95% at a dilution of 1/5).
The sera reacted with the Maurer's clefts in trophozoite stages (IFA) and to the 
infected erythrocyte surface (FACS) indicating that FCR3S1.2(var2) encodes the
dominant PfEMP1 expressed in this parasite.
CONCLUSION: The major transcript in the rosetting model parasite FCR3S1.2 is
FCR3S1.2(var2) (IT4var60). The results suggest that this gene encodes the
PfEMP1-species responsible for the rosetting phenotype of this parasite. The
activity of previously raised antibodies to the NTS-DBL1α of FCR3S1.2(var1) is
likely due to cross-reactivity with NTS-DBL1α of the var2 encoded PfEMP1.
