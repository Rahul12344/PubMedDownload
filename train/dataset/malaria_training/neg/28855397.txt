In HIV infection, persistent inflammation despite effective antiretroviral
therapy is linked to increased risk of noninfectious chronic complications such
as cardiovascular and thromboembolic disease. A better understanding of
inflammatory and coagulation pathways in HIV infection is needed to optimize
clinical care. Markers of monocyte activation and coagulation independently
predict morbidity and mortality associated with non-AIDS events. We identified a 
specific subset of monocytes that express tissue factor (TF), persist after
virological suppression, and trigger the coagulation cascade by activating factor
X. This subset of monocytes expressing TF had a distinct gene signature with
up-regulated innate immune markers and evidence of robust production of multiple 
proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α), and IL-6, ex vivo and in vitro upon lipopolysaccharide
stimulation. We validated our findings in a nonhuman primate model, showing that 
TF-expressing inflammatory monocytes were associated with simian immunodeficiency
virus (SIV)-related coagulopathy in the progressive [pigtail macaques (PTMs)] but
not in the nonpathogenic (African green monkeys) SIV infection model. Last,
Ixolaris, an anticoagulant that inhibits the TF pathway, was tested and potently 
blocked functional TF activity in vitro in HIV and SIV infection without
affecting monocyte responses to Toll-like receptor stimulation. Strikingly, in
vivo treatment of SIV-infected PTMs with Ixolaris was associated with significant
decreases in D-dimer and immune activation. These data suggest that TF-expressing
monocytes are at the epicenter of inflammation and coagulation in chronic HIV and
SIV infection and may represent a potential therapeutic target.
