OBJECTIVES: The interaction between genetic, epigenetic inheritance and
environmental factors determines susceptibility to hypertension. Previous
epidemiology studies have shown that coke oven workers who are frequently exposed
to various occupational hazards have remarkable increase in the risk for
hypertension. Among many genetic variants identified in hypertension, heat shock 
protein 70 (HSP70) was found to play important roles in the pathogenesis of
hypertension and associated diseases. We therefore explore the possible role of
HSP70 polymorphisms and their interaction with occupational environment in
hypertension risk.
METHODS: We carried out a case-control study among 367 coke oven workers in
northwest China, focused on three common HSP70 polymorphisms (HSP70-1 G190C,
HSP70-2 A1267G and HSP70-hom T2437C), and evaluated the association of HSP70 gene
polymorphisms with work sites for high risk of hypertension.
RESULTS: The results indicated that HSP70-1 GC and CC genotype had 2.73-fold and 
4.26-fold increased relative risk (95% CI 1.33 to 5.55 and 1.17 to 15.53),
respectively, comparing with HSP70-1 GG genotype. HSP70-2 AG and GG conferred a
47% and 36% reduced risk (95% CI 0.23 to 0.99 and 0.14 to 0.92) comparing with
HSP70-2 AA genotype. Further analysis of the interaction of HSP70 polymorphisms
with occupational environment indicated a strong positive interaction between
HSP70 genotype (HSP70-1 GC+CC, HSP70-2 AA and HSP70-hom TC+CC) and oven top
workplace.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data indicate that HSP70 polymorphisms interact 
with occupational hazards might increase the risk of hypertension in coke oven
workers.
