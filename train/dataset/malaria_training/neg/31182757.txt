A highly effective vaccine that confers sterile protection to malaria is urgently
needed. Immunization under chemoprophylaxis with sporozoites (CPS) consistently
confers high levels of protection in the Controlled Human Malaria infection
(CHMI) model. To provide a broad, unbiased assessment of the composition and
kinetics of direct ex vivo human immune responses to CPS, we profiled whole-blood
transcriptomes by RNA-seq before and during CPS immunization and following CHMI
challenge. Differential expression of genes enriched in modules related to T
cells, NK cells, protein synthesis, and mitochondrial processes were detected in 
fully protected individuals four weeks after the first immunization.
Non-protected individuals demonstrated transcriptomic changes after the third
immunization and the day of treatment, with upregulation of interferon and innate
inflammatory genes and downregulation of B-cell signatures. Protected individuals
demonstrated more significant interactions between blood transcription modules
compared to non-protected individuals several weeks after the second and third
immunizations. These data provide insight into the molecular and cellular basis
of CPS-induced immune protection from P. falciparum infection.
