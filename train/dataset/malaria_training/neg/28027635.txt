BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Plasmodium falciparum infection during pregnancy is
characterised by placental inefficiency caused by infected erythrocyte
sequestration. Reduced placental efficiency leads to placental intrauterine
adaptation for sustaining fetal growth, which is reflected by changes in the
expression of placental genes involved in intrauterine growth regulation.
Therefore, we aimed to determine whether the placental weight ratio, an indicator
of placental efficiency, affects the placental expression of the components of
the insulin-like growth factor axis and leptin signalling pathway in P.
falciparum-infected pregnant women.
METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: A malaria case-only analysis of 50 P.
falciparum-infected pregnant women in Timika, Papua, Indonesia, was conducted.
The placental mRNA expression of insulin-like growth factor-I, insulin-like
growth factor binding protein-1, leptin, and the long and short isoforms of the
leptin receptor was measured through quantitative realtime PCR.
RESULTS: The placental weight ratio exerted a positive effect on the placental
mRNA expression of insulin- like growth factor-I (coefficient=6.10, p=0.002) and 
the long isoform of the leptin receptor (coefficient= 4.73, p=0.015) in
malaria-infected pregnant women without fever or chill symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that placental adaptive responses caused by
adverse intrauterine conditions in P. falciparuminfected pregnant women vary
depending on the presence or absence of fever and chill symptoms.
