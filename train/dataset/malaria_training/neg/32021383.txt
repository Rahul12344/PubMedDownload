Purpose: Pharmacogenes have an influence on biotransformation pathway and
clinical outcome of primaquine and chloroquine which are often prescribed to
treat Plasmodium vivax infection. Genetic variation may impact enzyme activity
and/or transporter function and thereby contribute to relapse. The aim of the
study was to assess allele, genotype frequencies and the association between
pharmacogenes variation and primaquine response in Thai patients infected with
Plasmodium vivax.
Patients and Methods: Fifty-one patients were genotyped for 74 variants in 18
genes by Sequenom MassARRAY® and Taqman® SNP Real-Time PCR.
Results: SNP frequencies were not significantly different between relapse (n=4)
and non-relapse (n=47) patients. However, the CYP2C19 c.681G>A, the frequency of 
the A-allele that defines the non-functional CYP2C19*2 haplotype was
significantly higher compared to the G-allele (OR=5.14, p=0.021). Patients
heterozygous for ABCG2 c.421C>A had a higher odds ratio (OR=8.75, p=0.071) and
the frequency of the G-allele of UGT2B7 c.372G>A was higher compared to the
A-allele (OR=3.75, p=0.081). CYP2C19, ABCG2 and UGT2B7 emerged as potential high 
priority genes.
Conclusion: Decreased activity of CYP2C19, ABCG2 and UGT2B7 in combination with
CYP2D6 intermediate or poor metabolizer status may expose patients to a higher
risk of Plasmodium vivax relapse. Further investigations are warranted to
substantiate these findings.
