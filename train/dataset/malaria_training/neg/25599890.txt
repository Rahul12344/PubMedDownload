BACKGROUND: Complex malaria infections are defined as those containing more than 
one genetically distinct lineage of Plasmodium parasite. Complexity of infection 
(COI) is a useful parameter to estimate from patient blood samples because it is 
associated with clinical outcome, epidemiology and disease transmission rate.
This manuscript describes a method for estimating COI using likelihood, called
COIL, from a panel of bi-allelic genotyping assays.
METHODS: COIL assumes that distinct parasite lineages in complex infections are
unrelated and that genotyped loci do not exhibit significant linkage
disequilibrium. Using the population minor allele frequency (MAF) of the
genotyped loci, COIL uses the binomial distribution to estimate the likelihood of
a COI level given the prevalence of observed monomorphic or polymorphic genotypes
within each sample.
RESULTS: COIL reliably estimates COI up to a level of three or five with at least
24 or 96 unlinked genotyped loci, respectively, as determined by in silico
simulation and empirical validation. Evaluation of COI levels greater than five
in patient samples may require a very large collection of genotype data, making
sequencing a more cost-effective approach for evaluating COI under conditions
when disease transmission is extremely high. Performance of the method is
positively correlated with the MAF of the genotyped loci. COI estimates from
existing SNP genotype datasets create a more detailed portrait of disease than
analyses based simply on the number of polymorphic genotypes observed within
samples.
CONCLUSIONS: The capacity to reliably estimate COI from a genome-wide panel of
SNP genotypes provides a potentially more accurate alternative to methods relying
on PCR amplification of a small number of loci for estimating COI. This approach 
will also increase the number of applications of SNP genotype data, providing
additional motivation to employ SNP barcodes for studies of disease epidemiology 
or control measure efficacy. The COIL program is available for download from
GitHub, and users may also upload their SNP genotype data to a web interface for 
simple and efficient determination of sample COI.
