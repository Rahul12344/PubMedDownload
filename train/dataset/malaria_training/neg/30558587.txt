BACKGROUND: In Pakistan, artesunate (AS) in combination with
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is the recommended treatment for uncomplicated
Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Monitoring molecular markers of anti-malarial drug
resistance is crucial for early detection and containment of parasite resistance 
to treatment. Currently, no data are available on molecular markers of
artemisinin resistance (K13 mutations) in P. falciparum isolates from Pakistan.
In this study, the prevalence of mutations associated with SP and artemisinin
resistance was estimated in different regions of Pakistan.
METHODS: A total of 845 blood samples that were positive for malaria parasites by
microscopy or rapid diagnostic test were collected from January 2016 to February 
2017 from 16 different sites in Pakistan. Of these samples, 300 were positive for
P. falciparum by PCR. Polymorphisms in the P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase 
(pfdhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase (pfdhps) genes were identified by
pyrosequencing while polymorphisms in the propeller domain of the pfk13 gene were
identified by Sanger sequencing.
RESULTS: The prevalence of the PfDHFR 108N and 59R mutations was 100% and 98.8%, 
respectively, while the prevalence of PfDHFR 50R and 51I mutations was 8.6%. No
mutation was observed at PfDHFR position 164. In PfDHPS, the prevalence of
mutations at positions 436, 437, and 613 was 9.9%, 45.2%, and 0.4%, respectively.
No mutations were found at PfDHPS positions 540 and 581. The prevalence of double
PfDHFR mutants (59R + 108N) ranged from 93.8% to 100%, while the prevalence of
parasites having the PfDHFR 59R + 108N mutations in addition to the PfDHPS 437G
mutation ranged from 9.5% to 83.3% across different regions of Pakistan. Nine
non-synonymous and four synonymous mutations were observed in the PfK13 propeller
domain, none of which correspond to mutations validated to contribute to
artemisinin resistance.
CONCLUSION: The absence of the highly resistant PfDHFR/PfDHPS quintuple mutant
parasites and the lack of PfK13 mutations associated with artemisinin resistance 
is consistent with AS + SP being effective in Pakistan.
