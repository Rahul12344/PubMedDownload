Wild-living African apes are endemically infected with parasites that are closely
related to human Plasmodium vivax, a leading cause of malaria outside Africa.
This finding suggests that the origin of P. vivax was in Africa, even though the 
parasite is now rare in humans there. To elucidate the emergence of human P.
vivax and its relationship to the ape parasites, we analyzed genome sequence data
of P. vivax strains infecting six chimpanzees and one gorilla from Cameroon,
Gabon, and Côte d'Ivoire. We found that ape and human parasites share nearly
identical core genomes, differing by only 2% of coding sequences. However,
compared with the ape parasites, human strains of P. vivax exhibit about 10-fold 
less diversity and have a relative excess of nonsynonymous nucleotide
polymorphisms, with site-frequency spectra suggesting they are subject to greatly
relaxed purifying selection. These data suggest that human P. vivax has undergone
an extreme bottleneck, followed by rapid population expansion. Investigating
potential host-specificity determinants, we found that ape P. vivax parasites
encode intact orthologs of three reticulocyte-binding protein genes (rbp2d,
rbp2e, and rbp3), which are pseudogenes in all human P. vivax strains. However,
binding studies of recombinant RBP2e and RBP3 proteins to human, chimpanzee, and 
gorilla erythrocytes revealed no evidence of host-specific barriers to red blood 
cell invasion. These data suggest that, from an ancient stock of P. vivax
parasites capable of infecting both humans and apes, a severely bottlenecked
lineage emerged out of Africa and underwent rapid population growth as it spread 
globally.
