BACKGROUND: Malaria elimination requires diagnostic methods able to detect
parasite levels well below what is currently possible with microscopy and rapid
diagnostic tests. This is particularly true in surveillance of malaria at the
population level that includes so-called "asymptomatic" individuals.
METHODS: The development of the first ultrasensitive loop mediated amplification 
method capable of detecting malaria from both whole blood and dried blood spots
(DBS) is described. The 18S rRNA and corresponding genes that remain stable on
DBS for up to 5 months are targeted.
RESULTS: In the case of Plasmodium falciparum, lower limits of detection of
25 parasite/mL and 50-100 parasite/mL from whole blood and DBS were obtained,
respectively. A sensitivity of 97.0% (95% CI 82.5-99.8) and specificity of 99.1% 
(95% CI 97.6-99.7) was obtained for the detection of all species in asymptomatic 
individuals from Africa and Asia (n = 494).
CONCLUSION: This tool is ideally suited for low middle-income countries where
malaria is endemic and ultrasensitive surveillance of malaria is highly desirable
for elimination.
