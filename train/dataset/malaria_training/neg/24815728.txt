Leishmania infantum is the main etiological agent of zoonotic visceral
leishmaniasis in the Mediterranean region, including Portugal, but, given its low
isoenzyme diversity in this country, the population structure is poorly known. A 
set of 14 polymorphic microsatellite markers was studied on 136 Portuguese
Leishmania strains isolated from different hosts, geographic regions and
different clinical forms. A total of 108 different genotypes were found, which is
a degree of genetic diversity comparable to other regions, even within zymodeme
MON-1. A single most common genotype was detected in 1:5 of all strains, which,
with a greater number of multi-strain genotypes found in the Lisbon Metropolitan 
Region, particularly for human strains, was suggestive of the occurrence of
clonal transmission. In addition, a high re-infection rate was found among HIV+
patients. Model based analysis by STRUCTURE uncovered two main populations
(populations A and B, composed of MON-1 and non-MON-1 strains, respectively),
with great genetic diversity between them, and two MON-1 sub-populations (A1 and 
A2). High inbreeding coefficients were found in these populations, although
strains with mixed ancestry were identified, suggesting that recombination also
plays a role in the epidemiology of this species in Portugal. Some but limited
geographical differentiation was observed, with groups of strains from the same
regions clustering together, particularly those from canine origin. Our results
show that L. infantum isolates from Portugal present microsatellite diversity
comparable to other regions and that different transmission models play a role in
its epidemiology, from clonal transmission to recombination. In addition,
although Portugal is a small country, mobility of people and animals is high and 
Leishmania can be probably easily disseminated between infected hosts throughout 
the country, two instances of seemingly local restricted transmission were
identified.
