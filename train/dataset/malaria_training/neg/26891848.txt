BACKGROUND: Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) play a key role in malaria
management and control. The PfHRP-2 based RDT is the most widely used RDT for
malaria diagnosis in Ghana. Deletion of pfhrp2 in Plasmodium falciparum parasites
affect the diagnostic accuracy of PfHRP-2 based RDT kits. Identifying the
prevalence and distribution of P. falciparum parasites with deleted pfhrp2 is
important for malaria control.
AIM: The purpose of this study was to identify and confirm the prevalence of
pfhrp2 deletant P. falciparum parasites circulating within different regions of
Ghana.
METHODS: DNA was extracted from the membrane of spent CareStartâ„¢ PfHRP-2 RDT kits
and dried filter paper blood blots using Chelex-100. Exon 2 of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 
genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), resolved by agarose gel 
electrophoresis and visualized under UV light.
RESULTS: Microscopic analysis of blood smears from samples that were PfHRP-2 RDT 
positive revealed a parasite prevalence of 54/114 (47.4 %) and 2/26 (7.7 %) in
Accra and Cape Coast, respectively. PCR analysis increased parasite prevalence in
the RDT positive samples to 94/114 (82.5 %) and 6/26 (23.1 %) in Accra and Cape
Coast respectively. The exon 2 of the pfhrp2 gene was deleted in 18/54 (33.3 %)
of the microscopy confirmed and 36.2 % (34/94) of the PCR confirmed RDT positive 
samples collected in Accra. No RDT sample, confirmed to contain parasites by
either PCR or microscopy was negative by pfhrp2 exon 2 PCR in Cape Coast. A
survey of an additional 558 DBS revealed that 22.4 % (46/205) and 40 % (44/110)
of PCR positive samples in Accra and Cape Coast, respectively, lacked the exon 2 
region of pfhrp2 and possibly the entire pfhrp2 gene.
CONCLUSIONS: A high number of P. falciparum parasites, which lack pfhrp2 exon 2
gene have been identified in two communities in Ghana. Continuous nationwide
monitoring of the prevalence of pfhrp2 deletant parasites would be essential to
malaria control. The use of RDT kits that are effective at malaria diagnosis
despite deletion of pfhrp2, such as the PfHRP-2/PfLDH combo RDT kit could enhance
the diagnosis of clinical malaria in Ghana.
