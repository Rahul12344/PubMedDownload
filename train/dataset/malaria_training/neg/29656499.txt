BACKGROUND: Blood group phenotype variation has been attributed to potential
resistance to pathogen invasion. Variation was mapped in blood donors from
Lampang (northern region) and Saraburi (central region), Thailand, where malaria 
is endemic. The previously unknown blood group allele profiles were characterized
and the data were correlated with phenotypes. The high incidence of the
Vel-negative phenotype previously reported in Thais was investigated.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: DNA from 396 blood donors was analyzed by
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
Outliers were investigated by serology and DNA sequencing. Allele discrimination 
assays for SMIM1 rs1175550A/G and ACKR1 rs118062001C/T were performed and
correlated with antigen expression.
RESULTS: All samples were phenotyped for Rh, MNS, and K. Genotyping/phenotyping
for RhD, K, and S/s showed 100% concordance. Investigation of three RHCE outliers
revealed an e-variant antigen encoded by RHCE*02.22. Screening for rs147357308
(RHCE c.667T) revealed a frequency of 3.3%. MN typing discrepancies in 41 samples
revealed glycophorin variants, of which 40 of 41 were due to Mia . Nine samples
(2.3%) were heterozygous for FY*01W.01 (c.265C > T), and six samples (1.5%) were 
heterozygous for JK*02N.01. All samples were wildtype SMIM1 homozygotes with 97% 
homozygosity for rs1175550A.
CONCLUSIONS: Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass
spectrometry is an efficient method for rapid routine genotyping and
investigation of outliers identified novel variation among our samples. The
expected high prevalence of the Mi(a+) phenotype was observed from both regions. 
Of potential clinical relevance in a region where transfusion-dependent
thalassemia is common, we identified two RHCE*02 alleles known to encode an
e-variant antigen.
