BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms in the cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) gene could 
influence therapeutic outcomes of CYP2B6-metabolized drugs such as artemisinin,
nevirapine (NVP), and efavirenz (EFV). The main objective of the present study
was to analyze the frequency of the most common allele of CYP2B6*1 to *7 and *9
in Iranian Baluchi population and also to compare the frequencies of these
polymorphisms with those reported in different ethnic groups.
METHODS: A total of 206 healthy, unrelated, subjects were participated in this
study. CYP2B6*1, *2, *3, *4, *5, *6,*7, and *9 polymorphisms were investigated,
using PCR-RFLP followed by sequencing analysis.
RESULTS: High frequency of 516T (35.7%) was found among the studied subjects.
Also, the three most frequent genotypes were CYP2B6*1/*6 (28.1%), CYP2B6*1/*1
(16%) and CYP2B6*1/*9 (14.6%). The frequency of CYP2B6*6/*6 (4.8%) was not
different from Caucasian, Japanese and Chinese populations, but it was lower than
West African (17%) and Papua New Guinean (43%) populations.
CONCLUSION: Allele frequencies for CYP2B6 in the examined population were
markedly different from those African, Caucasian, and Southeast Asian
populations. CYP2B6*2, *4, *5, *6, and *7 were found in the Iranian Baluchi that 
may affect the response to artemisin and its derivatives. High frequency of G516T
(35.7%) was detected among the examined subjects that might cause greater
efavirenz plasma exposure and more central nervous system side effects.
Therefore, characterization of pharmacologically relevant polymorphisms in CYP2B6
has a great potential to improve drug efficacy and reduce toxicity.
