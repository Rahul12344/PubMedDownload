Historically seen as a benign disease, it is now becoming clear that Plasmodium
vivax can cause significant morbidity. Effective control strategies targeting P. 
vivax malaria is hindered by our limited understanding of vivax biology. Here we 
established the P. vivax transcriptome of the Intraerythrocytic Developmental
Cycle (IDC) of two clinical isolates in high resolution by Illumina HiSeq
platform. The detailed map of transcriptome generates new insights into
regulatory mechanisms of individual genes and reveals their intimate relationship
with specific biological functions. A transcriptional hotspot of vir genes
observed on chromosome 2 suggests a potential active site modulating immune
evasion of the Plasmodium parasite across patients. Compared to other eukaryotes,
P. vivax genes tend to have unusually long 5' untranslated regions and also
present multiple transcription start sites. In contrast, alternative splicing is 
rare in P. vivax but its association with the late schizont stage suggests some
of its significance for gene function. The newly identified transcripts,
including up to 179 vir like genes and 3018 noncoding RNAs suggest an important
role of these gene/transcript classes in strain specific transcriptional
regulation.
