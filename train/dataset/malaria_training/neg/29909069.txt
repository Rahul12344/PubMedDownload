BACKGROUND: DSM265 is a novel, long-duration inhibitor of plasmodium
dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) with excellent selectivity over human DHODH 
and activity against blood and liver stages of Plasmodium falciparum. This study 
aimed to assess the efficacy of DSM265 in patients with P falciparum or
Plasmodium vivax malaria infection.
METHODS: This proof-of-concept, open-label, phase 2a study was conducted at the
Asociación Civil Selva Amazónica in Iquitos, Peru. Patients aged 18-70 years,
weighing 45-90 kg, who had clinical malaria (P falciparum or P vivax
monoinfection) and fever within the previous 24 h were eligible. Exclusion
criteria were clinical or laboratory signs of severe malaria, inability to take
oral medicine, and use of other antimalarial treatment in the preceding 14 days. 
Patients were divided into cohorts of those with P falciparum (cohort a) or P
vivax (cohort b) infection. Two initial cohorts received single oral doses of 400
mg DSM265. Patients were followed up for efficacy for 28 days and safety for 35
days. Further cohorts received escalated or de-escalated doses of DSM265, after
safety and efficacy assessment of the initial dose. The primary endpoints were
the proportion of patients achieving PCR-adjusted adequate clinical and
parasitological response (ACPR) by day 14 for patients infected with P falciparum
and the proportion of patients achieving a crude cure by day 14 for those
infected with P vivax. Cohort success, the criteria for dose escalation, was
defined as ACPR (P falciparum) or crude cure (P vivax) in at least 80% of
patients in the cohort. The primary analysis was done in the intention-to-treat
population (ITT) and the per-protocol population, and safety analyses were done
in all patients who received the study drug. This study is registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02123290).
FINDINGS: Between Jan 12, 2015, and Dec 2, 2015, 45 Peruvian patients (24 with P 
falciparum [cohort a] and 21 with P vivax [cohort b] infection) were sequentially
enrolled. For patients with P falciparum malaria in the per-protocol population, 
all 11 (100%) in the 400 mg group and eight (80%) of ten in the 250 mg group
achieved ACPR on day 14. In the ITT analysis, 11 (85%) of 13 in the 400 mg group 
and eight (73%) of 11 in the 250 mg group achieved ACPR at day 14. For the
patients with P vivax malaria, the primary endpoint was not met. In the
per-protocol analysis, none of four patients who had 400 mg, three (50%) of six
who had 600 mg, and one (25%) of four who had 800 mg DSM265 achieved crude cure
at day 14. In the ITT analysis, none of five in the 400 mg group, three (33%) of 
nine in the 600 mg group, and one (14%) of seven in the 800 mg group achieved
crude cure at day 14. During the 28-day extended observation of P falciparum
patients, a resistance-associated mutation in the gene encoding the DSM265 target
DHODH was observed in two of four recurring patients. DSM265 was well tolerated. 
The most common adverse events were pyrexia (20 [44%] of 45) and headache (18
[40%] of 45), which are both common symptoms of malaria, and no patients had any 
treatment-related serious adverse events or adverse events leading to study
discontinuation.
INTERPRETATION: After a single dose of DSM265, P falciparum parasitaemia was
rapidly cleared, whereas against P vivax, DSM265 showed less effective clearance 
kinetics. Its long duration of action provides the potential to prevent
recurrence of P falciparum after treatment with a single dose, which should be
further assessed in future combination studies.
