BACKGROUND: In the recent years Plasmodium vivax has been reported to cause
severe infections associated with mortality. Clinical evaluation has limited
accuracy for the early identification of the patients progressing towards the
fatal condition. Researchers have tried to identify the serum and the
plasma-based indicators of the severe malaria. Discovery of MicroRNA (miRNA) has 
opened up an era of identification of early biomarkers for various infectious and
non-infectious diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are the small non-coding RNA molecules
of length 19-24 nts and are responsible for the regulation of the majority of
human gene expressions at post transcriptional level.
METHODS: We identified the differentially expressed miRNAs by microarray and
validated the selected miRNAs by qRT-PCR. We assessed the diagnostic potential of
these up-regulated miRNAs for complicated P. vivax malaria. Futher, the
bioinformtic analysis was performed to construct protein-protein and mRNA-miRNA
networks to identify highly regulated miRNA.
RESULTS: In the present study, utility of miRNA as potential biomarker of
complicated P. vivax malaria was explored. A total of 276 miRNAs were found to be
differentially expressed by miRNA microarray and out of which 5 miRNAs
(hsa-miR-7977, hsa-miR-28-3p, hsa-miR-378-5p, hsa-miR-194-5p and hsa-miR-3667-5p)
were found to be significantly up-regulated in complicated P. vivax malaria
patients using qRT-PCR. The diagnostic potential of these 5 miRNAs were found to 
be significant with sensitivity and specificity of 60-71% and 69-81% respectively
and area under curve (AUC) of 0.7 (p < 0.05). Moreover, in silico analysis of the
common targets of up-regulated miRNAs revealed UBA52 and hsa-miR-7977 as majorly 
regulated hubs in the PPI and mRNA-miRNA networks, suggesting their putative role
in complicated P. vivax malaria.
CONCLUSION: miR-7977 might act as a potential biomarker for differentiating
complicated P. vivax malaria from uncomplicated type. The elevated levels of
miR-7977 may have a role to play in the disease pathology through UBA52 or
TGF-beta signalling pathway.
