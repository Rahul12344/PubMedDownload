In remote areas of malaria-endemic countries, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have 
dramatically improved parasitological confirmation of suspected malaria cases,
especially when skilled microscopists are not available. This study was designed 
to determine the frequency of Plasmodium falciparum isolates with histidine-rich 
protein 2 (pfhrp2) gene deletion as one of the possible factors contributing to
the failure of PfHRP2-based RDTs in detecting malaria. A total of 300 blood
samples were collected from several health centres in Nyala City, Western Sudan. 
The performance of PfHRP2-based RDTs in relation to microscopy was examined and
the PCR-confirmed samples were investigated for the presence of pfhrp2 gene. A
total of 113 out of 300 patients were P. falciparum positive by microscopy. Among
them, 93.81% (106 out of 113) were positives by the PfHRP2 RDTs. Seven isolates
were identified as false negative on the basis of the RDTs results. Only one
isolate (0.9%; 1/113) potentially has pfhrp2 gene deletion. The sensitivity and
specificity of PfHRP2-based RDTs were 93.81% and 100%, respectively. The results 
provide insights into the pfhrp2 gene deletion amongst P. falciparum population
from Sudan. However, further studies with a large and systematic collection from 
different geographical settings across the country are needed.
