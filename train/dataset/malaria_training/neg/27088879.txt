Sirtuins are NAD(+)-dependent enzymes universally present in all organisms, where
they play central roles in regulating numerous biological processes. Although
early studies showed that sirtuins deacetylated lysines in a reaction that
consumes NAD(+), more recent studies have revealed that these enzymes can remove 
a variety of acyl-lysine modifications. The specificities for varied acyl
modifications may thus underlie the distinct roles of the different sirtuins
within a given organism. This review summarizes the structure, chemistry, and
substrate specificity of sirtuins with a focus on how different sirtuins
recognize distinct substrates and thus carry out specific functions.
