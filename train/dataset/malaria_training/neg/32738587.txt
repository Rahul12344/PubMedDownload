New treatments for the diseases caused by apicomplexans are needed. Recently, we 
determined that tartrolon E (trtE), a secondary metabolite derived from a
shipworm symbiotic bacterium, has broad-spectrum anti-apicomplexan parasite
activity. TrtE inhibits apicomplexans at nM concentrations in vitro, including
Cryptosporidium parvum, Toxoplasma gondii, Sarcocystis neurona, Plasmodium
falciparum, Babesia spp. and Theileria equi. To investigate the mechanism of
action of trtE against apicomplexan parasites, we examined changes in the
transcriptome of trtE-treated T. gondii parasites. RNA-Seq data revealed that the
gene, TGGT1_272370, which is broadly conserved in the coccidia, is significantly 
upregulated within 4 h of treatment. Using bioinformatics and proteome data
available on ToxoDB, we determined that the protein product of this tartrolon E
responsive gene (trg) has multiple transmembrane domains, a phosphorylation site,
and localizes to the plasma membrane. Deletion of trg in a luciferase-expressing 
T. gondii strain by CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in a 68% increase in parasite resistance
to trtE treatment, supporting a role for the trg protein product in the response 
of T. gondii to trtE treatment. Trg is conserved in the coccidia, but not in more
distantly related apicomplexans, indicating that this response to trtE may be
unique to the coccidians, and other mechanisms may be operating in other
trtE-sensitive apicomplexans. Uncovering the mechanisms by which trtE inhibits
apicomplexans may identify shared pathways critical to apicomplexan parasite
survival and advance the search for new treatments.
