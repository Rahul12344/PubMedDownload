BACKGROUND: Relapse infections resulting from the activation hypnozoites produced
by Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale represent an important obstacle to the
successful control of these species. A single licensed drug, primaquine is
available to eliminate these liver dormant forms. To date, investigations of
vivax relapse infections have been few in number.
RESULTS: Genotyping, based on polymorphic regions of two genes (Pvmsp1F3 and
Pvcsp) and four microsatellite markers (MS3.27, MS3.502, MS6 and MS8), of 12
paired admission and relapse samples from P. vivax-infected patients were treated
with primaquine, revealed that in eight of the parasite populations in the
admission and relapse samples were homologous, and heterologous in the remaining 
four patients. The patients' CYP2D6 genotypes did not suggest that any were poor 
metabolisers of primaquine. Parasitaemia tended to be higher in the heterologous 
as compared to the homologous relapse episodes as was the IgG3 response. For the 
twelve pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine levels measured for all samples, only 
those of IL-6 and IL-10 tended to be higher in patients with heterologous as
compared to homologous relapses in both admission and relapse episodes.
CONCLUSIONS: The data from this limited number of patients with confirmed relapse
episodes mirror previous observations of a significant proportion of heterologous
parasites in relapses of P. vivax infections in Thailand. Failure of the
primaquine treatment that the patients received is unlikely to be due to poor
drug metabolism, and could indicate the presence of P. vivax populations in
Thailand with poor susceptibility to 8-aminoquinolines.
