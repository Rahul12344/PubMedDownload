Artemisia annua L. is mostly known for a bioactive metabolite, artemisinin, an
effective sesquiterpene lactone used against malaria without any reputed cases of
resistance. In this experiment, bioinoculants viz., Streptomyces sp. MTN14,
Bacillus megaterium MTN2RP and Trichoderma harzianum Thu were applied as growth
promoting substances to exploit full genetic potential of crops in terms of
growth, yield, nutrient uptake and particularly artemisinin content. Further,
multi-use of the bioinoculants singly and in combinations for the enhancement of 
antioxidant potential and therapeutic value was also undertaken which to our
knowledge has never been investigated in context with microbial application. The 
results demonstrated that a significant (P < 0.05) increase in growth, nutrient
uptake, total phenolic, flavonoid, free radical scavenging activity, ferric
reducing antioxidant power, reducing power and total antioxidant capacity were
observed in the A. annua treated with a combination of bioinoculants in
comparison to control. Most importantly, an increase in artemisinin content and
yield by 34 and 72 % respectively in the treatment having all the three microbes 
was observed. These results were further authenticated by the PCA analysis which 
showed positive correlation between plant macronutrients and antioxidant content 
with plant growth and artemisinin yield of A. annua. The present study thus
highlights a possible new application of compatible bioinoculants for enhancing
the growth along with antioxidant and therapeutic value of A. annua.
