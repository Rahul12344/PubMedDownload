We conducted a 28-day follow-up of 17 Laotian patients diagnosed with
uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria treated with mefloquine (Mephaquine, 
MQ) alone to determine the efficacy. All patients were completely cured with MQ, 
without reappearance of asexual stage parasitemia at follow-up. Of the 7 isolates
tested for genotypic analysis, one isolate was a Y86 mutant type of the pfmdr1
gene, the others were N86 wild. These findings suggest no MQ resistance in the
study area possibly because the drug is rarely used in southern Lao PDR.
