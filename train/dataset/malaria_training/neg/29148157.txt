In this study, we report that Streptomyces asterosporus DSM 41452 is a producer
of new molecules related to the nonribosomal cyclodepsipeptide WS9326A and the
polyketide annimycin. S. asterosporus DSM 41452 is shown to produce six
cyclodepsipeptides and peptides, WS9326A to G. Notably, the compounds WS9326F and
WS9326G have not been described before. The genome of S. asterosporus DSM 41452
was sequenced, and a putative WS9326A gene cluster was identified. Gene-deletion 
experiments confirmed that this cluster was responsible for the biosynthesis of
WS9326A to G. Additionally, a gene-deletion experiment demonstrated that sas16
encoding a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase was involved in the synthesis of the
novel (E)-2,3-dehydrotyrosine residue found in WS9326A and its derivatives. An
insertion mutation within the putative annimycin gene cluster led to the
production of a new annimycin derivative, annimycin B, which exhibited modest
inhibitory activity against Plasmodium falciparum.
