Invasion of human erythrocytes by Plasmodium falciparum merozoites involves
multiple interactions between host receptors and their merozoite ligands. Here we
report human Cyclophilin B as a receptor for PfRhopH3 during merozoite invasion. 
Localization and binding studies show that Cyclophilin B is present on the
erythrocytes and binds strongly to merozoites. We demonstrate that PfRhopH3 binds
to the RBCs and their treatment with Cyclosporin A prevents merozoite invasion.
We also show a multi-protein complex involving Cyclophilin B and Basigin, as well
as PfRhopH3 and PfRh5 that aids the invasion. Furthermore, we report
identification of a de novo peptide CDP3 that binds Cyclophilin B and blocks
invasion by up to 80%. Collectively, our data provide evidence of compounded
interactions between host receptors and merozoite surface proteins and paves the 
way for developing peptide and small-molecules that inhibit the protein-protein
interactions, individually or in toto, leading to abrogation of the invasion
process.
