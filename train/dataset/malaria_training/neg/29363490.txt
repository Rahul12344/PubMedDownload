Human memory B cells and plasma cells represent a rich source of antibodies that 
have been selected in response to human pathogens. In the last decade, different 
methods have been developed to interrogate the human memory repertoire and
isolate monoclonal antibodies. I will discuss how a target-agnostic approach
based on high-throughput screening of antibodies produced by cultured B cells and
plasma cells has not only provided potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies
against a range of pathogens, but has also advanced our understanding of basic
aspects of the immune response, from host-pathogen interaction to the role of
somatic mutations in affinity maturation and in the diversification of the
antibody response. Most surprisingly, this approach has also revealed a new
mechanism of diversification based on templated insertion of non-Ig DNA into
antibody genes that we discovered in the context of the immune response to
malaria infection.
