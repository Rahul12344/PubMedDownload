A highly efficacious pre-erythrocytic stage vaccine would be an important tool
for the control and elimination of malaria but is currently unavailable.
High-level protection in humans can be achieved by experimental immunization with
Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites attenuated by radiation or under anti-malarial 
drug coverage. Immunization with genetically attenuated parasites (GAP) would be 
an attractive alternative approach. In this study, we present data on safety and 
protective efficacy using sporozoites with deletions of two genes, that is the
newly identified b9 and slarp, which govern independent and critical processes
for successful liver-stage development. In the rodent malaria model,
PbΔb9ΔslarpGAP was completely attenuated showing no breakthrough infections while
efficiently inducing high-level protection. The human PfΔb9ΔslarpGAP generated
without drug resistance markers were infective to human hepatocytes in vitro and 
to humanized mice engrafted with human hepatocytes in vivo but completely aborted
development after infection. These findings support the clinical development of a
PfΔb9ΔslarpSPZ vaccine.
