Despite its function in sex determination and its role in driving genome
evolution, the Y chromosome remains poorly understood in most species. Y
chromosomes are gene-poor, repeat-rich and largely heterochromatic and therefore 
represent a difficult target for genetic engineering. The Y chromosome of the
human malaria vector Anopheles gambiae appears to be involved in sex
determination although very little is known about both its structure and
function. Here, we characterize a transgenic strain of this mosquito species,
obtained by transposon-mediated integration of a transgene construct onto the Y
chromosome. Using meganuclease-induced homologous repair we introduce a
site-specific recombination signal onto the Y chromosome and show that the
resulting docking line can be used for secondary integration. To demonstrate its 
utility, we study the activity of a germ-line-specific promoter when located on
the Y chromosome. We also show that Y-linked fluorescent transgenes allow
automated sex separation of this important vector species, providing the means to
generate large single-sex populations. Our findings will aid studies of sex
chromosome function and enable the development of male-exclusive genetic traits
for vector control.
