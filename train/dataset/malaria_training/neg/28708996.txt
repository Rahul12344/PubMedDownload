The genomes of malaria parasites contain many genes of unknown function. To
assist drug development through the identification of essential genes and
pathways, we have measured competitive growth rates in mice of 2,578 barcoded
Plasmodium berghei knockout mutants, representing >50% of the genome, and created
a phenotype database. At a single stage of its complex life cycle, P. berghei
requires two-thirds of genes for optimal growth, the highest proportion reported 
from any organism and a probable consequence of functional optimization
necessitated by genomic reductions during the evolution of parasitism. In
contrast, extreme functional redundancy has evolved among expanded gene families 
operating at the parasite-host interface. The level of genetic redundancy in a
single-celled organism may thus reflect the degree of environmental variation it 
experiences. In the case of Plasmodium parasites, this helps rationalize both the
relative successes of drugs and the greater difficulty of making an effective
vaccine.
