BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen is an oestrogen receptor modulator that is widely used for 
the treatment of early stage breast cancer and reduction of recurrences.
Tamoxifen is also used as a powerful research tool for controlling gene
expression in the context of the Cre/loxP site-specific recombination system in
conditional mutant mice.
METHODS: To determine whether the administration of tamoxifen affects Plasmodium 
growth and/or disease outcome in malaria, in vitro studies assessing the effect
of tamoxifen and its active metabolite 4-hydroxytamoxifen on Plasmodium
falciparum blood stages were performed. Tamoxifen effects were also evaluated in 
vivo treating C57/B6 mice infected with Plasmodium berghei (ANKA strain), which
is the standard animal model for the study of cerebral malaria.
RESULTS: Tamoxifen and its active metabolite, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, show activity
in vitro against P. falciparum (16.7 to 5.8 µM IC50, respectively). This activity
was also confirmed in tamoxifen-treated mice infected with P. berghei, which show
lower levels of parasitaemia and do not develop signs of cerebral malaria,
compared to control mice. Mice treated with tamoxifen for 1 week and left
untreated for an additional week before infection showed similar parasitaemia
levels and signs of cerebral malaria as control untreated mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Tamoxifen and its active metabolite, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, have
significant activity against the human parasite P. falciparum in vitro and the
rodent parasite P. berghei in vivo. This activity may be useful for prevention of
malaria in patients taking this drug chronically, but also represents a major
problem for scientists using the conditional mutagenic Cre/LoxP system in the
setting of rodent malaria. Allowing mice to clear tamoxifen before starting a
Plasmodium infection allows the use the Cre/LoxP conditional mutagenic system to 
investigate gene function in specific tissues.
