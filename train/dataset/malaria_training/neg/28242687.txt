Heme is ubiquitous, yet relatively little is known about the maintenance of
labile pools of this cofactor, which likely ensures its timely bioavailability
for proper cellular function. Quantitative analysis of labile heme is of
fundamental importance to understanding how nature preserves access to the
diverse chemistry heme enables, while minimizing cellular damage caused by its
redox activity. Here, we have developed and characterized a protein-based sensor 
that undergoes fluorescence quenching upon heme binding. By genetically encoding 
this sensor in the human malarial parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, we have
quantified cytosolic labile heme levels in intact, blood-stage parasites. Our
findings indicate that a labile heme pool (∼1.6 µM) is stably maintained
throughout parasite development within red blood cells, even during a period
coincident with extensive hemoglobin degradation by the parasite. We also find
that the heme-binding antimalarial drug chloroquine specifically increases labile
cytosolic heme, indicative of dysregulation of this homeostatic pool that may be 
a relevant component of the antimalarial activity of this compound class. We
propose that use of this technology under various environmental perturbations in 
P. falciparum can yield quantitative insights into fundamental heme biology.
