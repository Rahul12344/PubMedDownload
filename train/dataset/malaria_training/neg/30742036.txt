The iron ion is an essential cofactor in several vital enzymatic reactions, such 
as DNA replication, oxygen transport, and respiratory and photosynthetic electron
transfer chains, but its excess accumulation induces oxidative stress in cells.
Vacuolar iron transporter 1 (VIT1) is important for iron homeostasis in plants,
by transporting cytoplasmic ferrous ions into vacuoles. Modification of the VIT1 
gene leads to increased iron content in crops, which could be used for the
treatment of human iron deficiency diseases. Furthermore, a VIT1 from the
malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium is considered as a potential drug target for 
malaria. Here we report the crystal structure of VIT1 from rose gum Eucalyptus
grandis, which probably functions as a H+-dependent antiporter for Fe2+ and other
transition metal ions. VIT1 adopts a novel protein fold forming a dimer of five
membrane-spanning domains, with an ion-translocating pathway constituted by the
conserved methionine and carboxylate residues at the dimer interface. The second 
transmembrane helix protrudes from the lipid membrane by about 40 Å and connects 
to a three-helical bundle, triangular cytoplasmic domain, which binds to the
substrate metal ions and stabilizes their soluble form, thus playing an essential
role in their transport. These mechanistic insights will provide useful
information for the further design of genetically modified crops and the
development of anti-malaria drugs.
