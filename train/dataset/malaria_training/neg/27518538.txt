BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum encoded histidine rich protein (HRP2) based
malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are used in India. Deletion of pfhrp2 and
pfhrp3 genes contributes to false negative test results, and large numbers of
such deletions have been reported from South America, highlighting the importance
of surveillance to detect such deletions.
METHODS: This is the first prospective field study carried out at 16 sites
located in eight endemic states of India to assess the performance of PfHRP2
based RDT kits used in the national malaria control programme. In this study,
microscopically confirmed P. falciparum but RDT negative samples were assessed
for presence of pfhrp2, pfhrp3, and their flanking genes using PCR.
RESULTS: Among 1521 microscopically positive P. falciparum samples screened, 50
were negative by HRP2 based RDT test. Molecular testing was carried out using
these 50 RDT negative samples by assuming that 1471 RDT positive samples carried 
pfhrp2 gene. It was found that 2.4% (36/1521) and 1.8% (27/1521) of samples were 
negative for pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes, respectively. However, the frequency of
pfhrp2 deletions varied between the sites ranging from 0-25% (2.4, 95% CI;
1.6-3.3). The frequency of both pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletion varied from 0-8% 
(1.6, 95% CI; 1.0-2.4).
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for low level presence of pfhrp2 and
pfhrp3 deleted P. falciparum parasites in different endemic regions of India, and
periodic surveillance is warranted for reliable use of PfHRP2 based RDTs.
