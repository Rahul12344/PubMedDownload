Effective malaria control and elimination in hyperendemic areas of the world will
require treatment of the Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) blood stage that causes
disease as well as the gametocyte stage that is required for transmission from
humans to the mosquito vector. Most currently used therapies do not kill
gametocytes, a highly specialized, non-replicating sexual parasite stage. Further
confounding next generation drug development against Pf is the unknown metabolic 
state of the gametocyte and the lack of known biochemical activity for most
parasite gene products in general. Here, we take a systematic activity-based
proteomics approach to survey the activity of the large and druggable ATPase
family in replicating blood stage asexual parasites and transmissible,
non-replicating sexual gametocytes. ATPase activity broadly changes during the
transition from asexual schizonts to sexual gametocytes, indicating altered
metabolism and regulatory roles of ATPases specific for each lifecycle stage. We 
further experimentally confirm existing annotation and predict ATPase function
for 38 uncharacterized proteins. By mapping the activity of ATPases associated
with gametocytogenesis, we assign biochemical activity to a large number of
uncharacterized proteins and identify new candidate transmission blocking
targets.
