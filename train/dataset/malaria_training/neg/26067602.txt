Comment in
    Cell Host Microbe. 2015 Jun 10;17(6):727-8.

During red-blood-cell-stage infection of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite
undergoes repeated rounds of replication, egress, and invasion. Erythrocyte
invasion involves specific interactions between host cell receptors and parasite 
ligands and coordinated expression of genes specific to this step of the life
cycle. We show that a parasite-specific bromodomain protein, PfBDP1, binds to
chromatin at transcriptional start sites of invasion-related genes and directly
controls their expression. Conditional PfBDP1 knockdown causes a dramatic defect 
in parasite invasion and growth and results in transcriptional downregulation of 
multiple invasion-related genes at a time point critical for invasion.
Conversely, PfBDP1 overexpression enhances expression of these same
invasion-related genes. PfBDP1 binds to acetylated histone H3 and a second
bromodomain protein, PfBDP2, suggesting a potential mechanism for gene
recognition and control. Collectively, these findings show that PfBDP1 critically
coordinates expression of invasion genes and indicate that targeting PfBDP1 could
be an invaluable tool in malaria eradication.
