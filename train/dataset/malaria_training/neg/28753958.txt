Iron supplementation may have adverse health effects in infants, probably through
manipulation of the gut microbiome. Previous research in low-resource settings
have focused primarily on anemic infants. This was a double blind, randomized,
controlled trial of home fortification comparing multiple micronutrient powder
(MNP) with and without iron. Six-month-old, non- or mildly anemic,
predominantly-breastfed Kenyan infants in a rural malaria-endemic area were
randomized to consume: (1) MNP containing 12.5 mg iron (MNP+Fe, n = 13); (2) MNP 
containing no iron (MNP-Fe, n = 13); or (3) Placebo (CONTROL, n = 7), from 6-9
months of age. Fecal microbiota were profiled by high-throughput bacterial 16S
rRNA gene sequencing. Markers of inflammation in serum and stool samples were
also measured. At baseline, the most abundant phylum was Proteobacteria (37.6% of
rRNA sequences). The proteobacterial genus Escherichia was the most abundant
genus across all phyla (30.1% of sequences). At the end of the intervention, the 
relative abundance of Escherichia significantly decreased in MNP-Fe (-16.05 ±
6.9%, p = 0.05) and CONTROL (-19.75 ± 4.5%, p = 0.01), but not in the MNP+Fe
group (-6.23 ± 9%, p = 0.41). The second most abundant genus at baseline was
Bifidobacterium (17.3%), the relative abundance of which significantly decreased 
in MNP+Fe (-6.38 ± 2.5%, p = 0.02) and CONTROL (-8.05 ± 1.46%, p = 0.01), but not
in MNP-Fe (-4.27 ± 5%, p = 0.4445). Clostridium increased in MNP-Fe only (1.9 ±
0.5%, p = 0.02). No significant differences were observed in inflammation
markers, except for IL-8, which decreased in CONTROL. MNP fortification over
three months in non- or mildly anemic Kenyan infants can potentially alter the
gut microbiome. Consistent with previous research, addition of iron to the MNP
may adversely affect the colonization of potential beneficial microbes and
attenuate the decrease of potential pathogens.
