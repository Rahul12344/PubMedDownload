Our understanding of the structure and regulation of Plasmodium vivax genes is
limited by our inability to grow the parasites in long-term in vitro cultures.
Most P. vivax studies must therefore rely on patient samples, which typically
display a low proportion of parasites and asynchronous parasites. Here, we
present stranded RNA-seq data generated directly from a small volume of blood
from three Cambodian vivax malaria patients collected before treatment. Our
analyses show surprising similarities of the parasite gene expression patterns
across infections, despite extensive variations in parasite stage proportion.
These similarities contrast with the unique gene expression patterns observed in 
sporozoites isolated from salivary glands of infected Colombian mosquitoes. Our
analyses also indicate that more than 10% of P. vivax genes encode multiple,
often undescribed, protein-coding sequences, potentially increasing the diversity
of proteins synthesized by blood stage parasites. These data also greatly improve
the annotations of P. vivax gene untranslated regions, providing an important
resource for future studies of specific genes.
