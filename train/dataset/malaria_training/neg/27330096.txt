BACKGROUND: An insecticide susceptibility study was carried out on Anopheles
gambiae sensu lato vectors in 11 districts in Ghana between October 2012 and
January 2013.
METHODS: An. gambiae s.l. larvae were collected, bred under standard conditions, 
and 3-5 d postemerged females were used for bioassay. Between 22 and 25 female
An. gambiae s.l. fed only 10% sugar were used for testing. Exposure was for 1 h
(2 h for fenitrothion). An gambiae that were knocked down were recorded every
10 min and mortalities recorded 24 h posttest. Eleven insecticides from four
chemical classes were used: organochlorines, organophosphates, carbamates, and
pyrethroids. Subsamples of An gambiae were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction 
for species and knockdown resistance (kdr) allele determination.
RESULTS: Malathion was effective in killing An. gambiae in seven districts,
fenitrothion in three districts, and propoxur in one district. The
organophosphate and carbamate insecticides were effective in killing An. gambiae 
compared to pyrethroids and organochlorines. Of the limited samples analyzed, An.
gambiae sensu stricto (39/110), An. coluzzii (66/110), and An. arabiensis (5/110)
were identified. Few kdr (11/110) susceptible mosquitoes were detected.
Homozygous kdrRR (65/110) and heterozygous kdrRS (8/110) genotypes were
identified.
CONCLUSIONS: An organophosphate insecticide is considered appropriate for indoor 
residual spraying (IRS) in the 11 districts earmarked for the IRS program in
Ghana.
