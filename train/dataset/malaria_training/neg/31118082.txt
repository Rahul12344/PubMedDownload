BACKGROUND: RNA interference (RNAi), which has facilitated functional
characterization of mosquito neural development genes such as the axon guidance
regulator semaphorin-1a (sema1a), could one day be applied as a new means of
vector control. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) may represent an
effective interfering RNA expression system that could be used directly for
delivery of RNA pesticides to mosquito larvae. Here we describe characterization 
of a yeast larvicide developed through bioengineering of S. cerevisiae to express
a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting a conserved site in mosquito sema1a genes.
RESULTS: Experiments conducted on Aedes aegypti larvae demonstrated that the
yeast larvicide effectively silences sema1a expression, generates severe neural
defects, and induces high levels of larval mortality in laboratory,
simulated-field, and semi-field experiments. The larvicide was also found to
induce high levels of Aedes albopictus, Anopheles gambiae and Culex
quinquefasciatus mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of these studies indicate that use of yeast interfering 
RNA larvicides targeting mosquito sema1a genes may represent a new biorational
tool for mosquito control.
