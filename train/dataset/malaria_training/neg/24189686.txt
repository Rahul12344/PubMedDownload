Anopheles minimus is one of the major vectors for transmission of malaria disease
in north eastern (NE) region of India. The minimus species complex of Minimus
subgroup of Myzomyia series of anophelines were studied in malaria affected
states--Assam and Arunachal Pradesh (AP) of NE India. Ribosomal DNA
markers--second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) and third domain (D3) of 28S
gene were used to characterize An. minimus species. Sequence homogeneity was
observed in D3 sequences of An.minimus specimens throughout both the states.
However, a transversion in ITS2 sequence of single specimen collected from
Assam-Meghalaya border areas illustrates possibility of intra population
polymorphism in ITS2 sequence within the geographical region.
