BACKGROUND: In South Asia, the epidemiology of malaria is complex, and
transmission mainly occurs in remote areas near international borders. Vector
control has been implemented as a key strategy in malaria prevention for decades.
A rising threat to the efficacy of vector control efforts is the development of
insecticide resistance, thus it is important to monitor the type and frequency of
insecticide resistant alleles in the disease vectors such as An. sinensis along
the China-Vietnam border. Such information is needed to synthesize effective
malaria vector control strategies.
METHODS: A total of 208 adults of An. sinensis, collected from seven sites in
southwest Guangxi along the China-Vietnam border, were inspected for the
resistance-conferring G119S mutation in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by PCR-RFLP
(polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism) and kdr
mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) by sequencing. In addition, 
the evolutionary origin of An. sinensis vgsc gene haplotypes was analyzed using
Network 5.0.
RESULTS: The frequencies of mutant 119S of AChE were between 0.61-0.85 in the
seven An. sinensis populations. No susceptible homozygote (119GG) was detected in
three of the seven sites (DXEC, LZSK and FCGDX). Very low frequencies of kdr
(0.00-0.01) were detected in the seven populations, with most individuals being
susceptible homozygote (1014LL). The 1014F mutation was detected only in the
southeast part (FCGDX) at a low frequency of 0.03. The 1014S mutation was
distributed in six of the seven populations with frequencies ranging from 0.04 to
0.08, but absent in JXXW. Diverse haplotypes of 1014L and 1014S were found in An.
sinensis along the China-Vietnam border, while only one 1014F haplotype was
detected in this study. Consistent with a previous report, resistant 1014S
haplotypes did not have a single origin.
CONCLUSIONS: The G119S mutation of AChE was present at high frequencies
(0.61-0.85) in the An. sinensis populations along the China-Vietnam border,
suggesting that the vector control authorities should be cautious when
considering carbamates and organophosphates as chemicals for vector control. The 
low frequencies (0.00-0.11) of kdr in these populations suggest that pyrethroids 
remain suitable for use against An. sinensis in these regions.
