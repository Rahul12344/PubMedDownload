Growing resistance is reported to carbamate insecticides in malaria vectors in
Cameroon. However, the contribution of acetylcholinesterase (Ace-1) to this
resistance remains uncharacterised. Here, we established that the G119S mutation 
is driving resistance to carbamates in Anopheles gambiae populations from
Cameroon. Insecticide bioassay on field-collected mosquitoes from Bankeng, a
locality in southern Cameroon, showed high resistance to the carbamates
bendiocarb (64.8% ± 3.5% mortality) and propoxur (55.71% ± 2.9%) but a full
susceptibility to the organophosphate fenitrothion. The TaqMan genotyping of the 
G119S mutation in field-collected adults revealed the presence of this resistance
allele (39%). A significant correlation was observed between the Ace-1R and
carbamate resistance at allelic ((bendiocarb; odds ratio (OR) = 75.9; p < 0.0001)
and (propoxur; OR = 1514; p < 0.0001)) and genotypic (homozygote resistant vs.
homozygote susceptible (bendiocarb; OR = 120.8; p < 0.0001) and (propoxur; OR =
3277; p < 0.0001)) levels. Furthermore, the presence of the mutation was
confirmed by sequencing an Ace-1 portion flanking codon 119. The cloning of this 
fragment revealed a likely duplication of Ace-1 in Cameroon as mosquitoes
exhibited at least three distinct haplotypes. Phylogenetic analyses showed that
the predominant Ace-1R allele is identical to that from West Africa suggesting a 
recent introduction of this allele in Central Africa from the West. The spread of
this Ace-1R represents a serious challenge to future implementation of indoor
residual spraying (IRS)-based interventions using carbamates or organophosphates 
in Cameroon.
