Malaria pathogenesis results from the asexual replication of Plasmodium
falciparum within human red blood cells, which relies on a precisely timed
cascade of gene expression over a 48-h life cycle. Although substantial
post-transcriptional regulation of this hardwired program has been observed, it
remains unclear how these processes are mediated on a transcriptome-wide level.
To this end, we identified mRNA modifications in the P. falciparum transcriptome 
and performed a comprehensive characterization of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) over
the course of blood-stage development. Using mass spectrometry and m6A RNA
sequencing, we demonstrate that m6A is highly developmentally regulated,
exceeding m6A levels known in any other eukaryote. We characterize a distinct m6A
writer complex and show that knockdown of the putative m6A methyltransferase,
PfMT-A70, by CRISPR interference leads to increased levels of transcripts that
normally contain m6A. In accordance, we find an inverse correlation between m6A
methylation and mRNA stability or translational efficiency. We further identify
two putative m6A-binding YTH proteins that are likely to be involved in the
regulation of these processes across the parasite's life cycle. Our data
demonstrate unique features of an extensive m6A mRNA methylation programme in
malaria parasites and reveal its crucial role in dynamically fine-tuning the
transcriptional cascade of a unicellular eukaryote.
