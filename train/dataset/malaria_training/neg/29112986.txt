Gene expression DNA microarrays have been vital for characterizing whole-genome
transcriptional profiles. Nevertheless, their effectiveness relies heavily on the
accuracy of genome sequences, the annotation of gene structures, and the
sequence-dependent performance of individual probes. Currently available gene
expression arrays for the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum rely on an
average of 2 probes per gene, usually positioned near the 3' end of genes;
consequently, existing designs are prone to measurement bias and cannot capture
complexities such as the occurrence of transcript isoforms arising from
alternative splicing or alternative start/ stop sites. Here, we describe two
novel gene expression arrays with exon-focused probes designed with an average of
12 and 20 probes spanning each gene. This high probe density minimizes signal
noise inherent in probe-to-probe sequence-dependent hybridization intensity. We
demonstrate that these exon arrays accurately profile genome-wide expression,
comparing favorably to currently available arrays and RNA-seq profiling, and can 
detect alternatively spliced transcript isoforms as well as non-coding RNAs
(ncRNAs). Of the 964 candidate alternate splicing events from published RNA-seq
studies, 162 are confirmed using the exon array. Furthermore, the exon array
predicted 330 previously unidentified alternate splicing events. Gene expression 
microarrays continue to offer a cost-effective alternative to RNA-seq for the
simultaneous monitoring of gene expression and alternative splicing events.
Microarrays may even be preferred in some cases due to their affordability and
the rapid turn-around of results when hundreds of samples are required for
fine-scale systems biology investigations, including the monitoring of the
networks of gene co-expression in the emergence of drug resistance.
