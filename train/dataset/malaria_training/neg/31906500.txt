An inflammatory response is essential for combating invading pathogens. Several
effector components, as well as immune cell populations, are involved in mounting
an immune response, thereby destroying pathogenic organisms such as bacteria,
fungi, viruses, and parasites. In the past decade, microRNAs (miRNAs), a group of
noncoding small RNAs, have emerged as functionally significant regulatory
molecules with the significant capability of fine-tuning biological processes.
The important role of miRNAs in inflammation and immune responses is highlighted 
by studies in which the regulation of miRNAs in the host was shown to be related 
to infectious diseases and associated with the eradication or susceptibility of
the infection. Here, we review the biological aspects of microRNAs, focusing on
their roles as regulators of gene expression during pathogen-host interactions
and their implications in the immune response against Leishmania, Trypanosoma,
Toxoplasma, and Plasmodium infectious diseases.
