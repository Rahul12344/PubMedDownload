Two cases of Plasmodium knowlesi infection in humans were identified in Cambodia 
by 3 molecular detection assays and sequencing. This finding confirms the
widespread distribution of P. knowlesi malaria in humans in Southeast Asia.
Further wide-scale studies are required to assess the public health relevance of 
this zoonotic malaria parasite.
