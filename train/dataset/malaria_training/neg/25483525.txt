Malaria transmission blocking vaccines (TBV) directed against proteins expressed 
on sexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum in the mosquito midgut are considered
an effective means to reduce malaria transmission. Antibodies induced by TBV
block sporogonic development in the mosquito, and thus transmission to the next
human host. The Pfs25 protein, expressed on the surface of gametes, zygotes and
ookinetes, is one of the primary targets for TBV development. Using a plant
virus-based transient expression system, we have successfully produced Pfs25
fused to a modified lichenase (LicKM) carrier in Nicotiana benthamiana, purified 
and characterized the protein (Pfs25-FhCMB), and evaluated this vaccine candidate
in animal models for the induction of transmission blocking antibodies. Soluble
Pfs25-FhCMB was expressed in plants at a high level, and induced transmission
blocking antibodies that persisted for up to 6 months post immunization in mice
and rabbits. These data demonstrate the potential of the new malaria vaccine
candidate and also support feasibility of expressing Plasmodium antigens in a
plant-based system.
