Conventional reverse genetic approaches for study of Plasmodium malaria parasite 
gene function are limited, or not applicable. Hence, new inducible systems are
needed. Here we describe a method to control P. falciparum gene expression in
which target genes bearing a glmS ribozyme in the 3' untranslated region are
efficiently knocked down in transgenic P. falciparum parasites in response to
glucosamine inducer. Using reporter genes, we show that the glmS ribozyme cleaves
reporter mRNA in vivo leading to reduction in mRNA expression following
glucosamine treatment. Glucosamine-induced ribozyme activation led to efficient
reduction of reporter protein, which could be rapidly reversed by removing the
inducer. The glmS ribozyme was validated as a reverse-genetic tool by integration
into the essential gene and antifolate drug target dihydrofolate
reductase-thymidylate synthase (PfDHFR-TS). Glucosamine treatment of transgenic
parasites led to rapid and efficient knockdown of PfDHFR-TS mRNA and protein.
PfDHFR-TS knockdown led to a growth/arrest mutant phenotype and hypersensitivity 
to pyrimethamine. The glmS ribozyme may thus be a tool for study of essential
genes in P. falciparum and other parasite species amenable to transfection.
