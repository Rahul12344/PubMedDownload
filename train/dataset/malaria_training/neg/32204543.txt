Heterochromatin is identified as a potential factor driving diversification of
species. To understand the magnitude of heterochromatin variation within the
Anopheles gambiae complex of malaria mosquitoes, we analyzed metaphase
chromosomes in An. arabiensis, An. coluzzii, An. gambiae, An. merus, and An.
quadriannulatus. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with ribosomal
DNA (rDNA), a highly repetitive fraction of DNA, and heterochromatic Bacterial
Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones, we established the correspondence of
pericentric heterochromatin between the metaphase and polytene X chromosomes of
An. gambiae. We then developed chromosome idiograms and demonstrated that the X
chromosomes exhibit qualitative differences in their pattern of heterochromatic
bands and position of satellite DNA (satDNA) repeats among the sibling species
with postzygotic isolation, An. arabiensis, An. merus, An. quadriannulatus, and
An. coluzzii or An. gambiae. The identified differences in the size and structure
of the X chromosome heterochromatin point to a possible role of repetitive DNA in
speciation of mosquitoes. We found that An. coluzzii and An. gambiae, incipient
species with prezygotic isolation, share variations in the relative positions of 
the satDNA repeats and the proximal heterochromatin band on the X chromosomes.
This previously unknown genetic polymorphism in malaria mosquitoes may be caused 
by a differential amplification of DNA repeats or an inversion in the sex
chromosome heterochromatin.
