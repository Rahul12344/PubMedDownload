BACKGROUND: Plasmodium parasites undergo several major developmental transitions 
during their complex lifecycle, which are enabled by precisely ordered gene
expression programs. Transcriptomes from the 48-h blood stages of the major human
malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum have been described using cDNA microarrays
and RNA-seq, but these assays have not always performed well within non-coding
regions, where the AT-content is often 90-95%.
RESULTS: We developed a directional, amplification-free RNA-seq protocol
(DAFT-seq) to reduce bias against AT-rich cDNA, which we have applied to three
strains of P. falciparum (3D7, HB3 and IT). While strain-specific differences
were detected, overall there is strong conservation between the transcriptional
profiles. For the 3D7 reference strain, transcription was detected from 89% of
the genome, with over 78% of the genome transcribed into mRNAs. We also find that
transcription from bidirectional promoters frequently results in non-coding,
antisense transcripts. These datasets allowed us to refine the 5' and 3'
untranslated regions (UTRs), which can be variable, long (> 1000 nt), and often
overlap those of adjacent transcripts.
CONCLUSIONS: The approaches applied in this study allow a refined description of 
the transcriptional landscape of P. falciparum and demonstrate that very little
of the densely packed P. falciparum genome is inactive or redundant. By capturing
the 5' and 3' ends of mRNAs, we reveal both constant and dynamic use of
transcriptional start sites across the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle that
will be useful in guiding the definition of regulatory regions for use in future 
experimental gene expression studies.
