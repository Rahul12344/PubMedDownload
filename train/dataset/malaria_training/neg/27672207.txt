Despite the potential benefit of primaquine in reducing Plasmodium falciparum
transmission and radical cure of Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale
infections, concerns over risk of hemolytic toxicity in individuals with
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd) have hampered its
deployment. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2014 to assess the G6PDd
prevalence among 631 children between 6 and 59 months of age in southwestern
Uganda, an area where primaquine may be a promising control measure. G6PDd
prevalence was determined using three detection methods: a quantitative G6PD
enzyme activity assay (Trinity Biotech® G-6-PDH kit), a qualitative point-of-care
test (CareStart™ G6PD rapid diagnostic test [RDT]), and molecular detection of
the G6PD A- G202A allele. Qualitative tests were compared with the gold standard 
quantitative assay. G6PDd prevalence was higher by RDT (8.6%) than by
quantitative assay (6.8%), using a < 60% activity threshold. The RDT performed
optimally at a < 60% threshold and demonstrated high sensitivity (≥ 90%) and
negative predictive values (100%) across three activity thresholds (below 60%,
30%, and 40%). G202A allele frequency was 6.4%, 7.9%, and 6.8% among females,
males, and overall, respectively. Notably, over half of the G202A
homo-/hemizygous children expressed ≥ 60% enzyme activity. Overall, the
CareStart™ G6PD RDT appears to be a viable screening test to accurately identify 
individuals with enzyme activities below 60%. The low prevalence of G6PDd across 
all three diagnostic modalities and absence of severe deficiency in our study
suggests that there is little barrier to the use of single-dose primaquine in
this region.
