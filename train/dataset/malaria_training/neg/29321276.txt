Differentiation of CD4+ Th cells is critical for immunity to malaria. Several
innate immune signaling pathways have been implicated in the detection of
blood-stage Plasmodium parasites, yet their influence over Th cell immunity
remains unclear. In this study, we used Plasmodium-reactive TCR transgenic CD4+ T
cells, termed PbTII cells, during nonlethal P. chabaudi chabaudi AS and P. yoelii
17XNL infection in mice, to examine Th cell development in vivo. We found no role
for caspase1/11, stimulator of IFN genes, or mitochondrial antiviral-signaling
protein, and only modest roles for MyD88 and TRIF-dependent signaling in
controlling PbTII cell expansion. In contrast, IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) was
important for supporting PbTII expansion, promoting Th1 over T follicular helper 
(Tfh) differentiation, and controlling parasites during the first week of
infection. IRF3 was not required for early priming by conventional dendritic
cells, but was essential for promoting CXCL9 and MHC class II expression by
inflammatory monocytes that supported PbTII responses in the spleen. Thereafter, 
IRF3-deficiency boosted Tfh responses, germinal center B cell and memory B cell
development, parasite-specific Ab production, and resolution of infection. We
also noted a B cell-intrinsic role for IRF3 in regulating humoral immune
responses. Thus, we revealed roles for IRF3 in balancing Th1- and Tfh-dependent
immunity during nonlethal infection with blood-stage Plasmodium parasites.
