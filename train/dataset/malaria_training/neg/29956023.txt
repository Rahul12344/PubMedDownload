Malaria is a major concern for international health authorities. Millions of
people contract it every year in the world due to a parasite of the Plasmodium
genus. Due to the complexity of the parasite biology and genetics, there is
currently no vaccine against the disease. However, due to the great resistance
both to the medicines and to the insecticides used to combat the disease, it has 
become essential to obtain a vaccine as the necessary tool to prevent
transmission and eliminate the disease. The bibliometric data indicate that
interest in vaccines has been growing steadily since the 1980s. But nowadays, a
powerful tool is used: the Plasmodium genome. This allows us to improve the fight
against the disease. Knowing the sequences of the genes that favor the appearance
of drug resistance, or those that encode for proteins with greater antigenic
response, is a tool that can become fundamental. This article reviews the state
of the art on vaccines and genetics, in the fight against malaria, and analyzes
the fixed photo that the worldwide research on the disease poses.
