A cDNA encoding a lysozyme was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA
ends-polymerase chain reaction (RACE-PCR) from females of the malaria vector
Anopheles dirus A (Diptera: Culicidae). The 623 bp lysozyme (AdLys c-1) cDNA
encodes the 120 amino acid mature protein with a predicted molecular mass of 13.4
kDa and theoretical pI of 8.45. Six cysteine residues and a potential calcium
binding motif that are present in AdLys c-1 are highly conserved relative to
those of c-type lysozymes found in other insects. RT-PCR analysis of the AdLys
c-1 transcript revealed its presence at high levels in the salivary glands both
in larval and adult stages and in the larval caecum. dsRNA mediated gene
knockdown experiments were conducted to examine the potential role of this
lysozyme during Plasmodium berghei infection. Silencing of AdLys c-1 resulted in 
a significant reduction in the number of oocysts as compared to control dsGFP
injected mosquitoes.
