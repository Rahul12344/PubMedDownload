Plasmodium falciparum merozoites use diverse alternative erythrocyte receptors
for invasion and variably express cognate ligands encoded by the erythrocyte
binding antigen (eba) and reticulocyte binding-like homologue (Rh) gene families.
Previous analyses conducted on parasites from single populations in areas of
endemicity revealed a wide spectrum of invasion phenotypes and expression
profiles, although comparisons across studies have been limited by the use of
different protocols. For direct comparisons within and among populations,
clinical isolates from three different West African sites of endemicity (in
Ghana, Guinea, and Senegal) were cryopreserved and cultured ex vivo after thawing
in a single laboratory to assay invasion of target erythrocytes pretreated with
enzymes affecting receptor subsets. Complete invasion assay data from 67 isolates
showed no differences among the populations in the broad range of phenotypes
measured by neuraminidase treatment (overall mean, 40.6% inhibition) or trypsin
treatment (overall mean, 83.3% inhibition). The effects of chymotrypsin treatment
(overall mean, 79.2% inhibition) showed heterogeneity across populations
(Kruskall-Wallis P = 0.023), although the full phenotypic range was seen in each.
Schizont-stage transcript data for a panel of 8 invasion ligand genes (eba175,
eba140, eba181, Rh1, Rh2a, Rh2b, Rh4, and Rh5) were obtained for 37 isolates,
showing similar ranges of variation in each population except that eba175 levels 
tended to be higher in parasites from Ghana than in those from Senegal (whereas
levels of eba181 and Rh2b were lower in parasites from Ghana). The broad
diversity in invasion phenotypes and gene expression seen within each local
population, with minimal differences among them, is consistent with a hypothesis 
of immune selection maintaining parasite variation.
