INTRODUCTION: The human malaria parasite, Plasmodium vivax, is proving more
difficult to control and eliminate than Plasmodium falciparum in areas of
co-transmission. Comparisons of the genetic structure of sympatric parasite
populations may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the resilience of 
P. vivax and can help guide malaria control programs.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: P. vivax isolates representing the parasite
populations of four areas on the north coast of Papua New Guinea (PNG) were
genotyped using microsatellite markers and compared with previously published
microsatellite data from sympatric P. falciparum isolates. The genetic diversity 
of P. vivax (He = 0.83-0.85) was higher than that of P. falciparum (He =
0.64-0.77) in all four populations. Moderate levels of genetic differentiation
were found between P. falciparum populations, even over relatively short
distances (less than 50 km), with 21-28% private alleles and clear geospatial
genetic clustering. Conversely, very low population differentiation was found
between P. vivax catchments, with less than 5% private alleles and no genetic
clustering observed. In addition, the effective population size of P. vivax
(30353; 13043-69142) was larger than that of P. falciparum (18871; 8109-42986).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Despite comparably high prevalence, P. vivax had higher
diversity and a panmictic population structure compared to sympatric P.
falciparum populations, which were fragmented into subpopulations. The results
suggest that in comparison to P. falciparum, P. vivax has had a long-term large
effective population size, consistent with more intense and stable transmission, 
and limited impact of past control and elimination efforts. This underlines
suggestions that more intensive and sustained interventions will be needed to
control and eventually eliminate P. vivax. This research clearly demonstrates how
population genetic analyses can reveal deeper insight into transmission patterns 
than traditional surveillance methods.
