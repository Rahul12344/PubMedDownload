Acquisition of Elizabethkingia infections in intensive care units (ICUs) has
risen in the past decade. Treatment of Elizabethkingia infections is challenging 
due to the lack of effective therapeutic regimens, leading to a high mortality
rate. Elizabethkingia infections have long been attributed to Elizabethkingia
meningoseptica. Recently, we used whole-genome sequencing to reveal that E.
anophelis is the pathogenic agent for an Elizabethkingia outbreak at two ICUs. We
performed comparative genomic analysis of seven hospital-isolated E. anophelis
strains with five available Elizabethkingia spp. genomes deposited in the
National Center for Biotechnology Information Database. A pan-genomic approach
was applied to identify the core- and pan-genome for the Elizabethkingia genus.
We showed that unlike the hospital-isolated pathogen E. meningoseptica ATCC 12535
strain, the hospital-isolated E. anophelis strains have genome content and
organization similar to the E. anophelis Ag1 and R26 strains isolated from the
midgut microbiota of the malaria mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae. Both the
core- and accessory genomes of Elizabethkingia spp. possess genes conferring
antibiotic resistance and virulence. Our study highlights that E. anophelis is an
emerging bacterial pathogen for hospital environments.
