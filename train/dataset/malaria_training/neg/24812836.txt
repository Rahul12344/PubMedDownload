OBJECTIVE: To identify the incidence of the K76T mutation in Pfcrt gene of
imported Plasmodium falciparum and study the Pfcrt gene polymorphism in
Plasmodium falciparum.
METHODS: Seventy-two blood samples were collected from patients infected with P. 
falciparum returning from Africa (Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, Congo, Liberia,
Angora and Mali) and Southeast Asia (Myanmar and Indonesia) from 2008 to 2012.
According to Pfcrt gene sequence of P. falciparum, nested PCR primers were
designed, and the reaction was applied with P. falciparum DNA in the blood
samples as templates. PCR products were identified by Apo I digestion.
RESULTS: Among 72 blood samples of P. falciparum, mutant Pfcrt alleles were found
in 41 samples (57.7%, 41/71) and wild type Pfcrt alleles were found in 30 samples
(42.3%, 30/71). There were 25 samples (50%, 25/50) each with mutant Pfcrt alleles
or wild type that were from Africa, while 16 samples (76.2%, 16/21) with mutant
Pfcrt alleles and 5 samples (23.8%, 5/21) with wild type that were from Southeast
Asia, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The incidence of Pfcrt gene mutation is different in P. falciparum
isolates from different regions.
