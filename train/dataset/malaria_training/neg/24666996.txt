Plasmodium falciparum displays a large and remarkable variety of heat shock
protein 40 family members (PfHsp40s). The majority of the PfHsp40s are poorly
characterized, and although the functions of some of them have been suggested,
their exact mechanism of action is still elusive and their interacting partners
and client proteins are unknown. The P. falciparum heat shock protein 70 family
members (PfHsp70s) have been more extensively characterized than the PfHsp40s,
with certain members shown to function as molecular chaperones. However, little
is known about the PfHsp70-PfHsp40 chaperone partnerships. There is mounting
evidence that these chaperones are important not only in protein homoeostasis and
cytoprotection, but also in protein trafficking across the parasitophorous
vacuole (PV) and into the infected erythrocyte. We propose that certain members
of these chaperone families work together to maintain exported proteins in an
unfolded state until they reach their final destination. In this review, we
critically evaluate what is known and not known about PfHsp40s and PfHsp70s.
