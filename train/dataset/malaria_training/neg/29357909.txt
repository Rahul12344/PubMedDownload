BACKGROUND: The glutamate-rich protein (GLURP) of the malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum is a key surface antigen that serves as a component of a clinical
vaccine. Moreover, the GLURP gene is also employed routinely as a genetic marker 
for malarial genotyping in epidemiological studies. While extensive size
polymorphisms in GLURP are well recorded, the extent of the sequence diversity of
this gene is rarely investigated. The present study aimed to explore the genetic 
diversity of GLURP in natural populations of P. falciparum.
RESULTS: The polymorphic C-terminal repetitive R2 region of GLURP sequences from 
65 P. falciparum isolates in Thailand were generated and combined with the data
from 103 worldwide isolates to generate a GLURP database. The collection was
comprised of 168 alleles, encoding 105 unique GLURP subtypes, characterized by 18
types of amino acid repeat units (AAU). Of these, 28 GLURP subtypes, formed by 10
AAU types, were detected in P. falciparum in Thailand. Among them, 19 GLURP
subtypes and 2 AAU types are described for the first time in the Thai parasite
population. The AAU sequences were highly conserved, which is likely due to
negative selection. Standard Fst analysis revealed the shared distributions of
GLURP types among the P. falciparum populations, providing evidence of gene flow 
among the different demographic populations.
CONCLUSIONS: Sequence diversity causing size variations in GLURP in Thai P.
falciparum populations were detected, and caused by non-synonymous substitutions 
in repeat units and some insertion/deletion of aspartic acid or glutamic acid
codons between repeat units. The P. falciparum population structure based on
GLURP showed promising implications for the development of GLURP-based vaccines
and for monitoring vaccine efficacy.
