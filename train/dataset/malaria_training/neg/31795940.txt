BACKGROUND: Malaria pathogenesis relies on sexual gametocyte forms of the malaria
parasite to be transmitted between the infected human and the mosquito host but
the molecular mechanisms controlling gametocytogenesis remains poorly understood.
Here we provide a high-resolution transcriptome of Plasmodium falciparum as it
commits to and develops through gametocytogenesis.
RESULTS: The gametocyte-associated transcriptome is significantly different from 
that of the asexual parasites, with dynamic gene expression shifts characterizing
early, intermediate and late-stage gametocyte development and results in
differential timing for sex-specific transcripts. The transcriptional dynamics
suggest strict transcriptional control during gametocytogenesis in P. falciparum,
which we propose is mediated by putative regulators including epigenetic
mechanisms (driving active repression of proliferation-associated processes) and 
a cascade-like expression of ApiAP2 transcription factors.
CONCLUSIONS: The gametocyte transcriptome serves as the blueprint for sexual
differentiation and will be a rich resource for future functional studies on this
critical stage of Plasmodium development, as the intraerythrocytic transcriptome 
has been for our understanding of the asexual cycle.
