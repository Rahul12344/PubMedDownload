    Trends Parasitol. 2018 Apr;34(4):265-267.

Sleeping sickness is a fatal disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei, a unicellular 
parasite that lives in the bloodstream and interstitial spaces of peripheral
tissues and the brain. Patients have altered sleep/wake cycles, body temperature,
and endocrine profiles, but the underlying causes are unknown. Here, we show that
the robust circadian rhythms of mice become phase advanced upon infection, with
abnormal activity occurring during the rest phase. This advanced phase is caused 
by shortening of the circadian period both at the behavioral level as well as at 
the tissue and cell level. Period shortening is T. brucei specific and
independent of the host immune response, as co-culturing parasites with explants 
or fibroblasts also shortens the clock period, whereas malaria infection does
not. We propose that T. brucei causes an advanced circadian rhythm disorder,
previously associated only with mutations in clock genes, which leads to changes 
in the timing of sleep.
