Population genetic studies have been used to understand the transmission of
pathogens in humans and animals, especially the role of zoonotic infections and
evolution and dispersal of virulent subtypes. In this study, we analysed the
genetic diversity and population structure of Cryptosporidium meleagridis, the
only known Cryptosporidium species that infects both avian and mammalian hosts
and is responsible for approximately 10% of human cryptosporidiosis in some
areas. A total of 62 C. meleagridis specimens from children, AIDS patients, and
birds in Lima, Peru were characterised by sequence analysis of the ssrRNA gene
and five minisatellite, microsatellite and polymorphic markers in chromosome 6,
including the 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60), 47 kDa glycoprotein (CP47), a serine
repeat antigen (MSC6-5), retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) and
thrombospondin protein 8 (TSP8). The multilocus sequence analysis identified
concurrent infections with Cryptosporidium hominis in four AIDS patients and
three children. Unique subtypes of C. meleagridis ranged from eight at the gp60
locus (gene diversity -Hd=0.651), three at the RPGR (Hd=0.556), three at the
MSC6-5 locus (Hd=0.242), two at TSP8 (Hd=0.198), to one at CP47 (monomorphic),
much lower than that of C. hominis in the same area. Intragenic linkage
disequilibrium was strong and complete at all gene loci. Intergenic linkage
disequilibrium was highly significant (P<0.001) for all pairs of polymorphic
loci. Two major groups of subtypes were seen, with most subtypes belonging to
group 1. Within group 1, there was no clear population segregation, and two of
the 14 multilocus subtypes of C. meleagridis were found in both AIDS patients and
birds. We believe that these results provide the first evidence of a clonal
population structure of C. meleagridis and the likely occurrence of cross-species
transmission of C. meleagridis between birds and humans.
