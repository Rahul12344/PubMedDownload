In sub-Saharan Africa, inherited causes of anemia are common, but data are
limited regarding the geographical prevalence and coinheritance of these
conditions and their overall contributions to childhood anemia. To address these 
questions in Malawi, we performed a secondary analysis of the 2015-2016 Malawi
Micronutrient Survey, a nationally and regionally representative survey that
estimated the prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies and evaluated both
inherited and noninherited determinants of anemia. Children age 6 to 59 months
were sampled from 105 clusters within the 2015-2016 Malawi Demographic Health
Survey. Hemoglobin, ferritin, retinol binding protein, malaria, and inflammatory 
biomarkers were measured from venous blood. Molecular studies were performed
using dried blood spots to determine the presence of sickle cell disease or
trait, α-thalassemia trait, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)
deficiency. Of 1279 eligible children, 1071 were included in the final analysis. 
Anemia, iron deficiency, and malaria were common, affecting 30.9%, 21.5%, and
27.8% of the participating children, respectively. α-Thalassemia trait was common
(>40% of children demonstrating deletion of 1 [33.1%] or 2 [10.0%] α-globin
genes) and associated with higher prevalence of anemia (P < .001). Approximately 
20% of males had G6PD deficiency, which was associated with a 1.0 g/dL protection
in hemoglobin decline during malaria infection (P = .02). These data document
that inherited blood disorders are common and likely play an important role in
the prevalence of anemia and malaria in Malawian children.
