Malaria is a significant public health problem in Ghana. Seasonal Malaria
Chemoprevention (SMC) using a combination of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and
amodiaquine has been implemented since 2015 in northern Ghana where malaria
transmission is intense and seasonal. In this study, we estimated the prevalence 
of asymptomatic P. falciparum carriers in three ecological zones of Ghana, and
compared the sensitivity and specificity of different molecular methods in
identifying asymptomatic infections. Moreover, we examined the frequency of
mutations in pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, and pfdhps that relate to the ongoing SMC. A 
total of 535 asymptomatic schoolchildren were screened by microscopy and PCR (18s
rRNA and TARE-2) methods. Among all samples, 28.6% were detected as positive by
18S nested PCR, whereas 19.6% were detected by microscopy. A high PCR-based
asymptomatic prevalence was observed in the north (51%) compared to in the
central (27.8%) and south (16.9%). The prevalence of
pfdhfr-N51I/C59R/S108N/pfdhps-A437G quadruple mutant associated with
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance was significantly higher in the north where 
SMC was implemented. Compared to 18S rRNA, TARE-2 serves as a more sensitive
molecular marker for detecting submicroscopic asymptomatic infections in high and
low transmission settings. These findings establish a baseline for monitoring P. 
falciparum prevalence and resistance in response to SMC over time.
