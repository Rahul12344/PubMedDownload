The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum apicoplast indirect aminoacylation
pathway utilizes a non-discriminating glutamyl-tRNA synthetase to synthesize
Glu-tRNA(Gln) and a glutaminyl-tRNA amidotransferase to convert Glu-tRNA(Gln) to 
Gln-tRNA(Gln). Here, we show that Plasmodium falciparum and other apicomplexans
possess a unique heterodimeric glutamyl-tRNA amidotransferase consisting of GatA 
and GatB subunits (GatAB). We localized the P. falciparum GatA and GatB subunits 
to the apicoplast in blood stage parasites and demonstrated that recombinant
GatAB converts Glu-tRNA(Gln) to Gln-tRNA(Gln) in vitro. We demonstrate that the
apicoplast GatAB-catalyzed reaction is essential to the parasite blood stages
because we could not delete the Plasmodium berghei gene encoding GatA in blood
stage parasites in vivo. A phylogenetic analysis placed the split between
Plasmodium GatB, archaeal GatE, and bacterial GatB prior to the phylogenetic
divide between bacteria and archaea. Moreover, Plasmodium GatA also appears to
have emerged prior to the bacterial-archaeal phylogenetic divide. Thus, although 
GatAB is found in Plasmodium, it emerged prior to the phylogenetic separation of 
archaea and bacteria.
