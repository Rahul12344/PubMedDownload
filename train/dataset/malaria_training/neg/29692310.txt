Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes develop over 9-12 days while sequestered in
deep tissues. On emergence into the bloodstream, they circulate for varied
amounts of time during which certain host factors might influence their further
development. We aimed to evaluate the potential association of patient clinical
parameters with gametocyte development and carriage via in vivo methods.
Seventy-two patients were enrolled from three hospitals in the Volta region of
Ghana in 2016. Clinical parameters were documented for all patients, and
gametocyte prevalence by microscopy was estimated at 12.5%. By measuring RNA
transcripts representing two distinct gametocyte developmental stages using
reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), we
obtained a more precise estimate of gametocyte carriage while also inferring
gametocyte maturation. Fifty-three percent of the study participants harbored
parasites expressing transcripts of the immature gametocyte-specific gene
(PF3D7_1477700), whereas 36% harbored PF3D7_1438800 RNA-positive parasites, which
is enriched in mid and mature gametocytes, suggesting the presence of more
immature stages. Linear logistic regression showed that patients older than 5
years but less than 16 years were more likely to carry gametocytes expressing
both PF3D7_1477700 and PF3D7_1438800 compared with younger participants, and
gametocytemia was more likely in mildly anemic individuals compared with those
with severe/moderate anemia. These data provide further evidence that a greater
number of malaria patients harbor gametocytes than typically estimated by
microscopy and suggest a possible association between age, fever, anemia, and
gametocytemia.
