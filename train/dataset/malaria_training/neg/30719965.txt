We attempted to identify Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2/3
(pfhrp2/3) deletions among rapid diagnostic test (RDT)-negative but PCR- or
microscopy-positive P. falciparum-infected individuals in areas of low
transmission (Choma District, 2009-2011) and high transmission (Nchelenge
District, 2015-2017) in Zambia. Through community-based surveys, 5,167
participants were screened at 1,147 households by P. falciparum histidine-rich
protein 2 (PfHRP2)-based RDTs. Slides were made and dried blood spots were
obtained for molecular analysis. Of 28 samples with detectable P. falciparum DNA,
none from Nchelenge District were pfhrp2/3 negative. All eight samples from Choma
District had detectable pfhrp3 genes, but pfhrp2 was undetectable in three. DNA
concentrations of pfhrp2-negative samples were low (< 0.001 ng/Î¼L). These
findings suggest that PfHRP2-based RDTs remain effective tools for malaria
diagnosis in Nchelenge District, but further study is warranted to understand the
potential for pfhrp2/3 deletions in southern Zambia where malaria transmission
declined over the past decade.
