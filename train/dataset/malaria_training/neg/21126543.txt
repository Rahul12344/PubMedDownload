Malaria is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium and involves
infection of multiple hosts and cell types during the course of an infection. To 
complete its complex life cycle the parasite requires strict control of gene
regulation for survival and successful propagation. Thus far, the Apicomplexan
AP2 (ApiAP2) family of DNA-binding proteins is the sole family of proteins to
have surfaced as candidate transcription factors in all apicomplexan species.
Work from several laboratories is beginning to shed light on how the ApiAP2
proteins from Plasmodium spp. contribute to the regulation of gene expression at 
various stages of parasite development. Here we highlight recent progress toward 
understanding the role of Plasmodium ApiAP2 proteins in DNA related regulatory
processes including transcriptional regulation and gene silencing.
