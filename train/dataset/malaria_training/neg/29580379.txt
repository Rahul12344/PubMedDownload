Single-cell RNA-sequencing is revolutionising our understanding of seemingly
homogeneous cell populations but has not yet been widely applied to single-celled
organisms. Transcriptional variation in unicellular malaria parasites from the
Plasmodium genus is associated with critical phenotypes including red blood cell 
invasion and immune evasion, yet transcriptional variation at an individual
parasite level has not been examined in depth. Here, we describe the adaptation
of a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) protocol to deconvolute
transcriptional variation for more than 500 individual parasites of both rodent
and human malaria comprising asexual and sexual life-cycle stages. We uncover
previously hidden discrete transcriptional signatures during the pathogenic part 
of the life cycle, suggesting that expression over development is not as
continuous as commonly thought. In transmission stages, we find novel,
sex-specific roles for differential expression of contingency gene families that 
are usually associated with immune evasion and pathogenesis.
