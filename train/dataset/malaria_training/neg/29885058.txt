Malaria parasites are transmitted through blood feeding by female Anopheline
mosquitoes. Unveiling the blood-feeding process will improve understanding of
vector biology. Anopheles dirus (Diptera: Culicidae) is one of the primary
malaria vectors in the Greater Mekong Subregion, the epicentre of malaria drug
resistance. In this study, differential gene expression between sugar- and
blood-fed An. dirus was investigated by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). A total of 589 
transcripts were found to be upregulated and 703 transcripts downregulated as a
result of blood feeding. Transcriptional differences were found in genes involved
in blood digestion, peritrophic matrix formation, oogenesis and vitellogenesis.
The expression levels of several genes were validated by quantitative reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction. The present results provide better
understanding of An. dirus biology in relation to its blood feeding.
