BACKGROUND: G6PD deficiency is common in malaria endemic regions and is estimated
to affect more than 400 million people worldwide. Treatment of malaria patients
with the anti-malarial drug primaquine or other 8-aminoquinolines may be
associated with potential haemolytic anaemia. The aim of the present study was to
investigate the prevalence of G6PD variants in Thai population who resided in
malaria endemic areas (western, northern, north-eastern, southern, eastern and
central regions) of Thailand, as well as the Burmese population who resided in
areas along the Thai-Myanmar border.
METHODS: The ten common G6PD variants were investigated in dried blood spot
samples collected from 317 Thai (84 males, 233 females) and 183 Burmese (11
males, 172 females) populations residing in malaria endemic areas of Thailand
using PCR-RFLP method.
RESULTS: Four and seven G6PD variants were observed in samples collected from
Burmese and Thai population, with prevalence of 6.6% (21/317) and 14.2% (26/183),
respectively. Almost all (96.2%) of G6PD mutation samples collected from Burmese 
population carried G6PD Mahidol variant; only one sample (3.8%) carried G6PD
Kaiping variant. For the Thai population, G6PD Mahidol (8/21: 38.1%) was the most
common variant detected, followed by G6PD Viangchan (4/21: 19.0%), G6PD Chinese 4
(3/21: 14.3%), G6PD Canton (2/21: 9.5%), G6PD Union (2/21: 9.5%), G6PD Kaiping
(1/21: 4.8%), and G6PD Gaohe (1/21: 4.8%). No G6PD Chinese 3, Chinese 5 and
Coimbra variants were found. With this limited sample size, there appeared to be 
variation in G6PD mutation variants in samples obtained from Thai population in
different regions particularly in the western region.
CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate difference in the prevalence and distribution of
G6PD gene variants among the Thai and Burmese populations in different malaria
endemic areas. Dosage regimen of primaquine for treatment of both Plasmodium
falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria may need to be optimized, based on
endemic areas with supporting data on G6PD variants. Larger sample size from
different malaria endemic is required to obtain accurate genetic mapping of G6PD 
variants in Burmese and Thai population residing in malaria endemic areas of
Thailand.
