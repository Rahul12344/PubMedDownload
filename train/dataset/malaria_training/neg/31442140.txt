Detoxification of Azadirachta indica Extracts In Anopheles stephensi Larvae.

Detoxifying pathways of mosquitoes against the neem (Azadirachta indica) extracts
are still unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of
adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in this process in
Anopheles stephensi, one of the main malaria vectors in southern Asia.
Third-stage larvae of An. stephensi were fed with fish food alone or in
combination with neem extract at 0.5%, 1%, 5%, and 10%. Six ABC-transporter genes
from 3 different subfamilies (B, C, and G) were analyzed to assess their relative
expression compared with controls. A bioassay was also performed to assess larval
mortality rate at different concentrations and in combination with verapamil, an 
ABC-transporter inhibitor. No significant variation in the expression levels of
any transporter belonging to the B, C, and G subfamilies was detected.
Furthermore, the use of verapamil did not induce an increase in mortality at any 
of the tested neem extract concentrations, indicating that ABC transporters are
not involved in the detoxification of neem extracts in An. stephensi larvae.
