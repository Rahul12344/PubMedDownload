Real-time PCR, also called quantitative PCR (qPCR), has been powerful analytical 
tool for detection of nucleic acids since it developed. Not only for biological
research but also for diagnostic needs, qPCR technique requires capacity to
detect multiple genes in recent years. Solid phase PCR (SP-PCR) where one or two 
directional primers are immobilized on solid substrates could analyze multiplex
genetic targets. However, conventional SP-PCR was subjected to restriction of
application for lack of PCR efficiency and quantitative resolution. Here we
introduce an advanced qPCR with primer-incorporated network (PIN). One
directional primers are immobilized in the porous hydrogel particle by covalent
bond and the other direction of primers are temporarily immobilized at so-called 
'Supplimers'. Supplimers released the primers to aqueous phase in the hydrogel at
the thermal cycling of PCR. It induced the high PCR efficiency over 92% with high
reliability. It reduced the formation of primer dimers and improved the
selectivity of qPCR thanks to the strategy of 'right primers supplied to right
place only'. By conducting a six-plex qPCR of 30 minutes, we analyzed DNA samples
originated from malaria patients and successfully identified malaria species in a
single reaction.
