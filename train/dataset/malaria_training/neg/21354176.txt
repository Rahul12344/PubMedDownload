Gene expression during the intraerythrocytic development cycle of the human
malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum is subject to tight temporal control,
resulting in a cascade of gene expression to meet the physiological demands of
growth, replication, and reinvasion. The roles of the different molecular
mechanisms that drive this temporal program of gene expression are poorly
understood. Here we report the use of the bxb1 integrase system to reconstitute
all aspects of the absolute and temporal control of the prototypical housekeeping
gene encoding the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Pfpcna) around an
integrated luciferase reporter cassette. A quantitative analysis of the effect of
the serial deletion of 5' and 3' genetic elements and sublethal doses of histone 
deacetylase inhibitors demonstrates that while the absolute control of gene
expression could be perturbed, no effect on the temporal control of gene
expression was observed. These data provide support for a novel model for the
temporal control of potentially hundreds of genes during the intraerythrocytic
development of this important human pathogen.
