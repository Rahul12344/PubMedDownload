BACKGROUND: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is seeking malaria eradication. Malaria
transmission has been very low over the last few years. Discovered cases of
Plasmodium falciparum infection are assigned a treatment protocol of
artemisinin-based combination therapy, which consists of artesunate in addition
to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine rather than the traditional chloroquine, which has
high resistance rates worldwide. This study aims to investigate the presence of
different gene mutations concerning anti-malarial drug resistance (pfdhfr,
pfdhps, pfmdr1, pfcrt, pfcytb, pfkelch13) to identify whether drug-resistant
alleles are present in this area of the Kingdom and whether the country's
treatment protocol is still suitable for Plasmodium bearing a resistance mutation
[corrected].
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from patients suffering from symptoms
suggesting malaria coming to King Faisal Hospital, Taif, from February to August 
2016. Diagnosis was performed by Giemsa-stained thin and thick blood films, rapid
diagnostic test and PCR. Positive P. falciparum samples were further subjected to
series of PCR amplification reactions targeting genes related with drug
resistance (pfdhfr, pfdhps, pfmdr1, pfcrt, pfcytb, pfketch13).
RESULTS: Twenty-six cases were positives, 13 infected with P. falciparum, of
those, 4 cases were autochthonous, and 13 with Plasmodium vivax. The results of
the gene mutation detection confirmed that there was no mutation related to
resistance to artemisinin or atovaquone, on the other hand chloroquine resistance
alleles were detected in 31% of samples. Moreover, point mutations in the pfdhfr 
and pfdhps genes, related resistance to antifolate drugs, were detected in all
characterized samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Haplotypes of P. falciparum in the western region of the Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia exhibit high resistance against antifolate drugs. These results
should be extensively discussed when planning to modify anti-malarial drug
protocols in the future.
