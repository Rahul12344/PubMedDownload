The effects of cell asynchrony on gene expression levels: analysis and
application to Plasmodium falciparum.

Zhao W, Dauwels J, Cao J.

To investigate the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle of Plasmodium
falciparum, time-series gene expression data is commonly measured of infected red
blood cells. However, the observed data are usually blurred due to cell
asynchrony during experiments. In this paper, the effect of cell asynchrony is
investigated by conducting numerical experiments. The simulation results suggest 
that cell asynchrony has varying effects on different intrinsic expression
patterns. Specifically, the intrinsic patterns with high expression around the
late life stage are more likely to be affected by cell asynchrony. It is also
investigated how the effect of cell asynchrony depends on the experimental
conditions. From this analysis, the burst rate r% in infection period and the
standard deviation Ïƒ of growth rate are identified to have a strong impact on the
blurring due to cell asynchrony. Consequently, it is important to measure these
two parameters during biological experiments in order to deblur time-series gene 
expression data.
