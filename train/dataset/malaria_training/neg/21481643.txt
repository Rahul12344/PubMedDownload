The recent discovery that Plasmodium knowlesi causes malaria in human
populations, established it as the fifth species of plasmodium that may do so. A 
case of P. knowlesi malaria is described in a helicopter pilot from New Zealand, 
who became ill after returning from recurring visits to Malaysian Borneo in June 
2010. His P. knowlesi infection was not detected using microscopic examination
and a rapid diagnostic test for malaria, but was confirmed by both PCR
(polymerase chain reaction) and sequence analysis showing homology with the
ribosomal RNA gene for P. knowlesi. He responded rapidly to treatment with
artemether & lumefantrine combination. The evolution of a rapid diagnostic kit to
diagnose P. knowlesi is needed, for early identification and appropriate
anti-malarial therapy of suspect cases are both critical in the prevention of the
potentially life-threatening disease through P. knowlesi. Clinicians need to
consider knowlesi infection in the differential diagnosis in recent-onset febrile
travellers to areas of forestation in Southeast Asia.
