Malaria is caused by obligate intracellular parasites, of which Plasmodium
falciparum is the most lethal species. In humans, P.  falciparum merozoites
(invasive forms of the parasite) employ a host of parasite proteins to rapidly
invade erythrocytes. One of these is the P.  falciparum apical membrane antigen 1
(PfAMA1) which forms a complex with rhoptry neck proteins at the tight junction. 
Here, we have placed the Pfama1 gene under conditional control using dimerizable 
Cre recombinase (DiCre) in P.  falciparum. DiCre-mediated excision of the
loxP-flanked Pfama1 gene results in approximately 80% decreased expression of the
protein within one intraerythrocytic growth cycle. This reduces growth by 40%,
due to decreased invasion efficiency characterized by a post-invasion defect in
sealing of the parasitophorous vacuole. These results show that PfAMA1 is an
essential protein for merozoite invasion in P.  falciparum and either directly or
indirectly plays a role in resealing of the red blood cell at the posterior end
of the invasion event.
