Functionally constrained genes are ideal insecticide targets because disruption
is often fatal, and resistance mutations are typically costly. Synaptic
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an essential neurotransmission enzyme targeted by 
insecticides used increasingly in malaria control. In Anopheles and Culex
mosquitoes, a glycine-serine substitution at codon 119 of the Ace-1 gene confers 
both resistance and fitness costs, especially for 119S/S homozygotes. G119S in
Anopheles gambiae from Accra (Ghana) is strongly associated with resistance, and,
despite expectations of cost, resistant 119S alleles are increasing significantly
in frequency. Sequencing of Accra females detected only a single Ace-1 119S
haplotype, whereas 119G diversity was high overall but very low at non-synonymous
sites, evidence of strong purifying selection driven by functional constraint.
Flanking microsatellites showed reduced diversity, elevated linkage
disequilibrium and high differentiation of 119S, relative to 119G homozygotes
across up to two megabases of the genome. Yet these signals of selection were
inconsistent and sometimes weak tens of kilobases from Ace-1. This unexpected
finding is attributable to apparently ubiquitous amplification of 119S alleles as
part of a large copy number variant (CNV) far exceeding the size of the Ace-1
gene, whereas 119G alleles were unduplicated. Ace-1 CNV was detectable in
archived samples collected when the 119S allele was rare in Ghana. Multicopy
amplification of resistant alleles has not been observed previously and is likely
to underpin the recent increase in 119S frequency. The large CNV compromised
localization of the strong selective sweep around Ace-1, emphasizing the need to 
integrate CNV analysis into genome scans for selection.
