Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by Leishmania protozoa
transmitted by infected sand flies. Vaccination through leishmanization with live
Leishmania major has been used successfully but is no longer practiced because it
resulted in occasional skin lesions. A second generation leishmanization is
described here using a CRISPR genome edited L. major strain (LmCen-/-). Notably, 
LmCen-/- is a genetically engineered centrin gene knock-out mutant strain that is
antibiotic resistant marker free and does not have detectable off-target
mutations. Mice immunized with LmCen-/- have no visible lesions following
challenge with L. major-infected sand flies, while non-immunized animals develop 
large and progressive lesions with a 2-log fold higher parasite burden. LmCen-/- 
immunization results in protection and an immune response comparable to
leishmanization. LmCen-/- is safe since it is unable to cause disease in
immunocompromised mice, induces robust host protection against vector sand fly
challenge and because it is marker free, can be advanced to human vaccine trials.
