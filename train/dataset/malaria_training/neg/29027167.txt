MNase-seq allows the genome-wide examination of the nucleosome landscape by
determination of nucleosome positioning and occupancy. Typically, native or
formaldehyde fixed chromatin is subjected to digestion by micrococcal nuclease
(MNase), which degrades linker DNA and yields mainly mono-nucleosomes. The
resulting material can be processed directly or can be subjected to an optional
chromatin immunoprecipitation step (MNase-ChIP-seq). De-crosslinked and purified 
DNA is then subjected to next-generation sequencing. The protocol presented here 
has been tailored for the analysis of nucleosome landscape in the malaria
parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, but most steps are directly applicable to other 
cell types. We also discuss general considerations for experimental design and
computational analysis, which are crucial for accurate investigation of the
nucleosome landscape.
