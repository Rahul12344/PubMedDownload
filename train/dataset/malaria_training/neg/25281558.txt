BACKGROUND: Homopolymeric tracts, particularly poly dA.dT, are enriched within
the intergenic sequences of eukaryotic genomes where they appear to act as
intrinsic regulators of nucleosome positioning. A previous study of the
incomplete genome of the human malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum reports a 
higher than expected enrichment of poly dA.dT tracts, far above that anticipated 
even in this highly AT rich genome. Here we report an analysis of the relative
frequency, length and spatial arrangement of homopolymer tracts for the complete 
P. falciparum genome, extending this analysis to twelve additional genomes of
Apicomplexan parasites important to human and animal health. In addition, using
nucleosome-positioning data available for P. falciparum, we explore the
correlation of poly dA.dT tracts with nucleosome-positioning data over key
expression landmarks within intergenic regions.
RESULTS: We describe three apparent lineage-specific patterns of homopolymeric
tract organization within the intergenic regions of these Apicomplexan parasites.
Moreover, a striking pattern of enrichment of overly long poly dA.dT tracts in
the intergenic regions of Plasmodium spp. uniquely extends into protein coding
sequences. There is a conserved spatial arrangement of poly dA.dT immediately
flanking open reading frames and over predicted core promoter sites. These key
landmarks are all relatively depleted in nucleosomes in P. falciparum, as would
be expected for poly dA.dT acting as nucleosome exclusion sequences.
CONCLUSIONS: Previous comparative studies of homopolymer tract organization
emphasize evolutionary diversity; this is the first report of such an analysis
within a single phylum. Our data provide insights into the evolution of
homopolymeric tracts and the selective pressures at play in their maintenance and
expansion.
