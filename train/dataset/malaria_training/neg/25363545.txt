BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combinations currently recommended for treatment of
uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in many countries of sub-Saharan
Africa are substrates of CYP enzymes. The cytochrome enzyme system is responsible
for metabolism of about 80-90% of clinically used drugs. It is, therefore,
important to obtain the pharmacogenetics of the population in the region with
respect to these combinations and thereby enable practitioners to predict
treatment outcomes. The aim of this study was to detect and determine allelic
frequencies of CYP2C8*2, CYP2C8*3, CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A5*3 and CYP2B6*6 variant
alleles in a Tanzanian indigenous population.
METHODS: Genomic DNA extraction from blood obtained from 256 participants who
escorted patients at Karume Health Centre in Mwanza Tanzania, was carried out
using the Gene JET™ Genomic DNA purification kit (Thermo Scientific). Genotyping 
for the cytochrome P450 variant alleles was performed using predesigned primers. 
Amplification was done by PCR while differentiation between alleles was done by
restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) (for CYP2C8*2, CYP2C8*3) and 
sequencing (for CYP2B6*6, CYP3A5*3 and CYP3A4*1B).
RESULTS: CYP2C8*2, CYP2C8*3, CYP3A5*3, CYP3A4*1B and CYP2B6*6 variant allelic
frequencies were found to be 19,10,16,78 and 36% respectively.
CONCLUSION: Prevalence of CYP2C8*2, CYP3A5*3, CYP3A4*1B and CYP2B6*6 mutations in
a Tanzanian population/subjects are common. The impact of these point mutations
on the metabolism of anti-malarial drugs, particularly artemisinin-based
combinations, and their potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) needs to be
further evaluated.
