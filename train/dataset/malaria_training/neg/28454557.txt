BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapies are the first line of
treatment for Plasmodium falciparum infections worldwide, but artemisinin
resistance has risen rapidly in Southeast Asia over the past decade. Mutations in
the kelch13 gene have been implicated in this resistance. We used longitudinal
genomic surveillance to detect signals in kelch13 and other loci that contribute 
to artemisinin or partner drug resistance. We retrospectively sequenced the
genomes of 194 P. falciparum isolates from five sites in Northwest Thailand, over
the period of a rapid increase in the emergence of artemisinin resistance
(2001-2014).
RESULTS: We evaluate statistical metrics for temporal change in the frequency of 
individual SNPs, assuming that SNPs associated with resistance increase in
frequency over this period. After Kelch13-C580Y, the strongest temporal change is
seen at a SNP in phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, which is involved in a pathway
recently implicated in artemisinin resistance. Furthermore, other loci exhibit
strong temporal signatures which warrant further investigation for involvement in
artemisinin resistance evolution. Through genome-wide association analysis we
identify a variant in a kelch domain-containing gene on chromosome 10 that may
epistatically modulate artemisinin resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrates the potential of a longitudinal genomic
surveillance approach to detect resistance-associated gene loci to improve our
mechanistic understanding of how resistance develops. Evidence for additional
genomic regions outside of the kelch13 locus associated with
artemisinin-resistant parasites may yield new molecular markers for resistance
surveillance, which may be useful in efforts to reduce the emergence or spread of
artemisinin resistance in African parasite populations.
