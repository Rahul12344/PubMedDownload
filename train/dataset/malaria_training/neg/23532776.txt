Plasmodium falciparum is one of the causative agents of malaria in humans. This
parasite causes the most severe forms of the disease. In order to combat the
disease, it is important to have knowledge about the parasite and its interaction
with its host. In this study, we profiled 74 patients admitted to hospital in
Tagum, Davao, Philippines who were confirmed to be infected with P. falciparum.
We correlated the age, sex and parasite load with malaria severity and show that 
among these, only sex is correlated with disease severity in this population. In 
addition, we profiled the MSP-1 block 2 allele distribution in the population and
found that the most abundant allele form was K1, followed by MAD20. The RO33
allele form was the rarest allele in this population.
