Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation are increasingly recognized to be
critical for vaccination efficacy and outcome of different infectious diseases,
but corresponding information is scarcely available for host defense against
malaria. In the experimental blood-stage malaria Plasmodium chabaudi, we
investigate the possible effects of a blood-stage vaccine on DNA methylation of
gene promoters in the liver, known as effector against blood-stage malaria, using
DNA methylation microarrays. Naturally susceptible Balb/c mice acquire, by
protective vaccination, the potency to survive P. chabaudi malaria and,
concomitantly, modifications of constitutive DNA methylation of promoters of
numerous genes in the liver; specifically, promoters of 256 genes are hyper(=up)-
and 345 genes are hypo(=down)-methylated (p < 0.05). Protective vaccination also 
leads to changes in promoter DNA methylation upon challenge with P. chabaudi at
peak parasitemia on day 8 post infection (p.i.), when 571 and 1013 gene promoters
are up- and down-methylated, respectively, in relation to constitutive DNA
methylation (p < 0.05). Gene set enrichment analyses reveal that both vaccination
and P. chabaudi infections mainly modify promoters of those genes which are most 
statistically enriched with functions relating to regulation of transcription.
Genes with down-methylated promoters encompass those encoding CX3CL1, GP130, and 
GATA2, known to be involved in monocyte recruitment, IL-6 trans-signaling, and
onset of erythropoiesis, respectively. Our data suggest that vaccination may
epigenetically improve parts of several effector functions of the liver against
blood-stage malaria, as, e.g., recruitment of monocyte/macrophage to the liver
accelerated liver regeneration and extramedullary hepatic erythropoiesis, thus
leading to self-healing of otherwise lethal P. chabaudi blood-stage malaria.
