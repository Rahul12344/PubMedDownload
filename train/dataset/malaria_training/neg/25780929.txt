Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of severe human malaria, employs
antigenic variation to avoid host immunity. Antigenic variation is achieved by
transcriptional switching amongst polymorphic var genes, enforced by epigenetic
modification of chromatin. The histone-modifying 'sirtuin' enzymes PfSir2a and
PfSir2b have been implicated in this process. Disparate patterns of var
expression have been reported in patient isolates as well as in cultured strains.
We examined var expression in three commonly used laboratory strains (3D7, NF54
and FCR-3) in parallel. NF54 parasites express significantly lower levels of var 
genes compared to 3D7, despite the fact that 3D7 was originally a clone of the
NF54 strain. To investigate whether this was linked to the expression of
sirtuins, genetic disruption of both sirtuins was attempted in all three strains.
No dramatic changes in var gene expression occurred in NF54 or FCR-3 following
PfSir2b disruption, contrasting with previous observations in 3D7. In 3D7,
complementation of the PfSir2a genetic disruption resulted in a significant
decrease in previously-elevated var gene expression levels, but with the
continued expression of multiple var genes. Finally, rearranged chromosomes were 
observed in the 3D7 PfSir2a knockout line. Our results focus on the potential for
parasite genetic background to contribute to sirtuin function in regulating
virulence gene expression and suggest a potential role for sirtuins in
maintaining genome integrity.
