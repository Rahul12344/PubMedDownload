The role of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) in the transmission 
of HIV-1 has not been extensively studied. Here, we investigated the association 
of KIR gene content polymorphisms with perinatal HIV-1 transmission. The KIR gene
family comprising 16 genes was genotyped in 313 HIV-1 positive Kenyan mothers
paired with their infants. Gene content polymorphisms were presented as presence 
of individual KIR genes, haplotypes, genotypes and KIR gene concordance. The
genetic data were analyzed for associations with perinatal transmission of HIV.
There was no association of infant KIR genes with perinatal HIV-1 transmission.
After adjustment for gravidity, viral load, and CD4 cell count, there was
evidence of an association between reduction in perinatal HIV-1 transmission and 
the maternal individual KIR genes KIR2DL2 (adjusted OR = 0.50; 95% CI: 0.24-1.02,
P = 0.06), KIR2DL5 (adjusted OR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.23-0.95, P = 0.04) and KIR2DS5 
(adjusted OR = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.18-0.80, P = 0.01). Furthermore, these maternal
KIR genes were only significantly associated with reduction in perinatal HIV
transmission in women with CD4 cell count ≥ 350 cells/ μl and viral load <10000
copies/ml. Concordance analysis showed that when both mother and child had
KIR2DS2, there was less likelihood of perinatal HIV-1 transmission (adjusted OR =
0.44; 95% CI: 0.20-0.96, P = 0.039). In conclusion, the maternal KIR genes
KIR2DL2, KIR2DL5, KIR2DS5, and KIR2DS2 were associated with reduction of HIV-1
transmission from mother to child. Furthermore, maternal immune status is an
important factor in the association of KIR with perinatal HIV transmission.
