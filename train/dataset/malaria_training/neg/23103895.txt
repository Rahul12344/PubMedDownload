INTRODUCTION: The study was conducted to determine for the first time the
association between the erythrocyte binding antigen 175 (EBA-175) alleles and ABO
blood groups in malaria patients living in Thies, a hypoendemic area in Senegal.
METHODOLOGY: In 2007, the EBA-175 alleles and blood group types were determined
by nested PCR and the Simonin test respectively in blood samples obtained from
uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria positive patients.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: In total, 129 patients were enrolled in the study. The
EBA-175 genotyping showed a prevalence of 67.45% for the F-allele, 27.90% for the
C-allele and 4.65% of mixed C+F infection. The distribution of the ABO blood
group type showed 59.8% for the O group, 19.7% for the A group, 17.2% for the B
group, and 3.3% for the AB group. No correlation was noted between the EBA-175
alleles and either the blood group type or parasitemia.
