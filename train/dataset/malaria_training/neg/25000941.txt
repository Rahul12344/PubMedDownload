BACKGROUND: Anopheles sinensis is the major malaria vector in China and Southeast
Asia. Vector control is one of the most effective measures to prevent malaria
transmission. However, there is little transcriptome information available for
the malaria vector. To better understand the biological basis of malaria
transmission and to develop novel and effective means of vector control, there is
a need to build a transcriptome dataset for functional genomics analysis by
large-scale RNA sequencing (RNA-seq).
METHODS: To provide a more comprehensive and complete transcriptome of An.
sinensis, eggs, larvae, pupae, male adults and female adults RNA were pooled
together for cDNA preparation, sequenced using the Illumina paired-end sequencing
technology and assembled into unigenes. These unigenes were then analyzed in
their genome mapping, functional annotation, homology, codon usage bias and
simple sequence repeats (SSRs).
RESULTS: Approximately 51.6 million clean reads were obtained, trimmed, and
assembled into 38,504 unigenes with an average length of 571 bp, an N50 of
711 bp, and an average GC content 51.26%. Among them, 98.4% of unigenes could be 
mapped onto the reference genome, and 69% of unigenes could be annotated with
known biological functions. Homology analysis identified certain numbers of An.
sinensis unigenes that showed homology or being putative 1:1 orthologues with
genomes of other Dipteran species. Codon usage bias was analyzed and 1,904 SSRs
were detected, which will provide effective molecular markers for the population 
genetics of this species.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data and analysis provide the most comprehensive transcriptomic 
resource and characteristics currently available for An. sinensis, and will
facilitate genetic, genomic studies, and further vector control of An. sinensis.
