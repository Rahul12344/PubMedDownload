Robust tools for analysing gene function in Plasmodium parasites, which are the
causative agents of malaria, are being developed at an accelerating rate. Two
decades after genetic technologies for use in Plasmodium spp. were first
described, a range of genetic tools are now available. These include conditional 
systems that can regulate gene expression at the genome, transcriptional or
protein level, as well as more sophisticated tools for gene editing that use
piggyBac transposases, integrases, zinc-finger nucleases or the CRISPR-Cas9
system. In this Review, we discuss the molecular genetic systems that are
currently available for use in Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium berghei, and 
evaluate the advantages and limitations of these tools. We examine the insights
that have been gained into the function of genes that are important during the
blood stages of the parasites, which may help to guide the development and
improvement of drug therapies and vaccines.
