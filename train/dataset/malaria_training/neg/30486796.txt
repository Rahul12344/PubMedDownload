BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum exhibits resistance to the artemisinin
component of the frontline antimalarial treatment Artemisinin-based Combination
Therapy in South East Asia. Millions of lives will be at risk if artemisinin
resistance (ART-R) spreads to Africa. Single non-synonymous mutations in the
propeller region of PF3D7_1343700,"K13" are implicated in resistance. In this
work, we use transcriptional profiling to characterize a laboratory-generated k13
insertional mutant previously demonstrated to have increased sensitivity to
artemisinins to explore the functional role of k13.
RESULTS: A set of RNA-seq and microarray experiments confirmed that the
expression profile of k13 is specifically altered during the early ring and early
trophozoite stages of the mutant intraerythrocytic development cycle. The
down-regulation of k13 transcripts in this mutant during the early ring stage is 
associated with a transcriptome advance towards a more trophozoite-like state. To
discover the specific downstream effect of k13 dysregulation, we developed a new 
computational method to search for differential gene expression while accounting 
for the temporal sequence of transcription. We found that the strongest
biological signature of the transcriptome shift is an up-regulation of DNA
replication and repair genes during the early ring developmental stage and a
down-regulation of DNA replication and repair genes during the early trophozoite 
stage; by contrast, the expressions of housekeeping genes are unchanged. This
effect, due to k13 dysregulation, is antagonistic, such that k13 levels are
negatively correlated with DNA replication and repair gene expression.
CONCLUSION: Our results support a role for k13 as a stress response regulator
consistent with the hypothesis that artemisinins mode of action is oxidative
stress and k13 as a functional homolog of Keap1 which in humans regulates DNA
replication and repair genes in response to oxidative stress.
