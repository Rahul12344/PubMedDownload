Malaria parasites modify their human host cell, the mature erythrocyte. This
modification is mediated by a large number of parasite proteins that are exported
to the host cell, and is also the underlying cause for the pathology caused by
malaria infection. Amongst these proteins are many Hsp40 co-chaperones, and a
single Hsp70. These proteins have been implicated in several processes in the
host cell, including a potential role in protein transport, however the further
molecular players in this process remain obscure. To address this, we have
utilized chemical cross-linking followed by mass spectrometry and immunoblotting 
to isolate and characterize proteins complexes containing an exported Hsp40
(PFE55), and the only known exported Hsp70 (PfHsp70x). Our data reveal that both 
of these proteins are contained in high molecular weight protein complexes. These
complexes are found both in the infected erythrocyte, and within the
parasite-derived compartment referred to as the parasitophorous vacuole.
Surprisingly, our data also reveal an association of PfHsp70x with components of 
PTEX, a putative protein translocon within the membrane of the parasitophorous
vacuole. Our results suggest that the P. falciparum- infected human erythrocyte
contains numerous high molecular weight protein complexes, which may potentially 
be involved in host cell modification.
