BACKGROUND: Eighteen imported ovale malaria cases imported from Myanmar and
various African countries have been reported in Yunnan Province, China from 2013 
to 2018. All of them have been confirmed by morphological examination and 18S
small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (18S rRNA) based PCR in YNRL. Nevertheless, the 
subtypes of Plasmodium ovale could not be identified based on 18S rRNA gene test,
thus posing challenges on its accurate diagnosis. To help establish a more
sensitive and specific method for the detection of P. ovale genes, this study
performs sequence analysis on k13-propeller polymorphisms in P. ovale.
METHODS: Dried blood spots (DBS) from ovale malaria cases were collected from
January 2013 to December 2018, and the infection sources were confirmed according
to epidemiological investigation. DNA was extracted, and the coding region (from 
206th aa to 725th aa) in k13 gene propeller domain was amplified using nested
PCR. Subsequently, the amplified products were sequenced and compared with
reference sequence to obtain CDS. The haplotypes and mutation loci of the CDS
were analysed, and the spatial structure of the amino acid peptide chain of k13
gene propeller domain was predicted by SWISS-MODEL.
RESULTS: The coding region from 224th aa to 725th aa of k13 gene from P. ovale in
83.3% of collected samples (15/18) were amplified. Three haplotypes were observed
in 15 samples, and the values of Ka/Ks, nucleic acid diversity index (π) and
expected heterozygosity (He) were 3.784, 0.0095, and 0.4250. Curtisi haplotype,
Wallikeri haplotype, and mutant type accounted for 73.3% (11/15), 20.0% (3/15),
and 6.7% (1/15). The predominant haplotypes of P. ovale curtisi were determined
in all five Myanmar isolates. Of the ten African isolates, six were identified as
P. o. curtisi, three were P. o. wallikeri and one was mutant type. Base
substitutions between the sequences of P. o. curtisi and P. o. wallikeri were
determined at 38 loci, such as c.711. Moreover, the A > T base substitution at
c.1428 was a nonsynonymous mutation, resulting in amino acid variation of T476S
in the 476th position. Compared with sequence of P. o. wallikeri, the double
nonsynonymous mutations of G > A and A > T at the sites of c.1186 and c.1428
leads to the variations of D396N and T476S for the 396th and 476th amino acids
positions. For P. o. curtisi and P. o. wallikeri, the peptide chains in the
coding region from 224th aa to 725th aa of k13 gene merely formed a monomeric
spatial model, whereas the double-variant peptide chains of D396N and T476S
formed homodimeric spatial model.
CONCLUSION: The propeller domain of k13 gene in the P. ovale isolates imported
into Yunnan Province from Myanmar and Africa showed high differentiation. The
sequences of Myanmar-imported isolates belong to P. o. curtisi, while the
sequences of African isolates showed the sympatric distribution from P. o.
curtisi, P. o. wallikeri and mutant isolates. The CDS with a double base
substitution formed a dimeric spatial model to encode the peptide chain, which is
completely different from the monomeric spatial structure to encode the peptide
chain from P. o. curtisi and P. o. wallikeri.
