Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum kills nearly one million children each
year and imposes crippling economic burdens on families and nations worldwide. No
licensed vaccine exists, but infection can be prevented by antibodies against the
circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the major surface protein of sporozoites, the
form of the parasite injected by mosquitoes. We have used vectored
immunoprophylaxis (VIP), an adeno-associated virus-based technology, to introduce
preformed antibody genes encoding anti-P. falciparum CSP mAb into mice. VIP
vector-transduced mice exhibited long-lived mAb expression at up to 1,200 Âµg/mL
in serum, and up to 70% were protected from both i.v. and mosquito bite challenge
with transgenic Plasmodium berghei rodent sporozoites that incorporate the P.
falciparum target of the mAb in their CSP. Serum antibody levels and protection
from mosquito bite challenge were dependent on the dose of the VIP vector. All
individual mice expressing CSP-specific mAb 2A10 at 1 mg/mL or more were
completely protected, suggesting that in this model system, exceeding that
threshold results in consistent sterile protection. Our results demonstrate the
potential of VIP as a path toward the elusive goal of immunization against
malaria.
