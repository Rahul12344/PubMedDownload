BACKGROUND: Chloroquine, a previous highly efficacious, easy to use and
affordable anti-malarial agent was withdrawn from malaria endemic regions due to 
high levels of resistance. This review collated evidence from published-reviewed 
articles to establish prevalence of Pfcrt 76T and Pfmdr-1 86Y alleles in malaria 
affected countries following official discontinuation of chloroquine use.
METHODS: A review protocol was developed, registered in PROSPERO
(#CRD42018083957) and published in a peer-reviewed journal. Article search was
done in PubMed, Scopus, Lilacs/Vhl and Embase databases by two experienced
librarians (AK, RS) for the period 1990-to-Febuary 2018. Mesh terms and Boolean
operators (AND, OR) were used. Data extraction form was designed in Excel spread 
sheet 2007. Data extraction was done by three reviewers (NL, BB and MO),
discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Random effects analysis was done in
Open Meta Analyst software. Heterogeneity was established using I2-statistic.
RESULTS: A total of 4721 citations were retrieved from article search
(Pubmed = 361, Lilac/vhl = 28, Science Direct = 944, Scopus = 3388). Additional
targeted search resulted in three (03) eligible articles. After removal of
duplicates (n = 523) and screening, 38 articles were included in the final
review. Average genotyping success rate was 63.6% (18,343/28,820) for Pfcrt K76T 
and 93.5% (16,232/17,365) for Pfmdr-1 86Y mutations. Prevalence of Pfcrt 76T was 
as follows; East Africa 48.9% (2528/5242), Southern Africa 18.6% (373/2163), West
Africa 58.3% (3321/6608), Asia 80.2% (1951/2436). Prevalence of Pfmdr-1 86Y was; 
East Africa 32.4% (1447/5722), Southern Africa 36.1% (544/1640), West Africa
52.2% (1986/4200), Asia 46.4% (1276/2217). Over half, 52.6% (20/38) of included
studies reported continued unofficial chloroquine use following policy change.
Studies done in Madagascar and Kenya reported re-emergence of chloroquine
sensitive parasites (IC50 < 30.9 nM). The average time (years) since
discontinuation of chloroquine use to data collection was 8.7 ± 7.4. There was
high heterogeneity (I2 > 95%).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of chloroquine resistance alleles among Plasmodium
falciparum parasites have steadily declined since discontinuation of chloroquine 
use. However, Pfcrt K76T and Pfmdr-1 N86Y mutations still persist at moderate
frequencies in most malaria affected countries.
