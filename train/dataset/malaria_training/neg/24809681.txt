BACKGROUND: Drug resistance remains a chief concern for malaria control. In order
to determine the genetic markers of drug resistant parasites, we tested the
genome-wide associations (GWA) of sequence-based genotypes from 35 Kenyan P.
falciparum parasites with the activities of 22 antimalarial drugs.
METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Parasites isolated from children with acute
febrile malaria were adapted to culture, and sensitivity was determined by in
vitro growth in the presence of anti-malarial drugs. Parasites were genotyped
using whole genome sequencing techniques. Associations between 6250 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and resistance to individual anti-malarial agents
were determined, with false discovery rate adjustment for multiple hypothesis
testing. We identified expected associations in the pfcrt region with chloroquine
(CQ) activity, and other novel loci associated with amodiaquine, quinazoline, and
quinine activities. Signals for CQ and primaquine (PQ) overlap in and around
pfcrt, and interestingly the phenotypes are inversely related for these two
drugs. We catalog the variation in dhfr, dhps, mdr1, nhe, and crt, including
novel SNPs, and confirm the presence of a dhfr-164L quadruple mutant in coastal
Kenya. Mutations implicated in sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance are at or
near fixation in this sample set.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Sequence-based GWA studies are powerful tools for
phenotypic association tests. Using this approach on falciparum parasites from
coastal Kenya we identified known and previously unreported genes associated with
phenotypic resistance to anti-malarial drugs, and observe in high-resolution
haplotype visualizations a possible signature of an inverse selective
relationship between CQ and PQ.
