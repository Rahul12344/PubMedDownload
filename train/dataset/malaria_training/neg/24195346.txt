Malaria is a complex disease that afflicts human today. Malaria epidemiology is
associated with drug resistance in parasite and differential distribution and
insecticide resistance in vector. Efforts are being made to eradicate malaria but
burden of malaria is still increasing. Vector control is essential for malaria
prevention strategies. Knowledge of population genetic structure is pre-requisite
for determining prevention strategies particularly using transgenic mosquitoes.
Population genetic study can predict level of gene flow between different
populations. Anopheles stephensi Liston is urban vector of malaria in
Indo-Pakistan subcontinent. About 12% of malaria cases of malaria in India are
contributed by A. stephensi. Studies conducted on population genetics of A.
stephensi using various markers in different parts of the world are discussed in 
this communication.
