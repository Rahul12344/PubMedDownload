The availability of diverse genomes makes it possible to predict gene function
based on shared evolutionary history. This approach can be challenging, however, 
for pathways whose components do not exhibit a shared history but rather consist 
of distinct "evolutionary modules." We introduce a computational algorithm,
clustering by inferred models of evolution (CLIME), which inputs a eukaryotic
species tree, homology matrix, and pathway (gene set) of interest. CLIME
partitions the gene set into disjoint evolutionary modules, simultaneously
learning the number of modules and a tree-based evolutionary history that defines
each module. CLIME then expands each module by scanning the genome for new
components that likely arose under the inferred evolutionary model. Application
of CLIME to ∼1,000 annotated human pathways and to the proteomes of yeast, red
algae, and malaria reveals unanticipated evolutionary modularity and coevolving
components. CLIME is freely available and should become increasingly powerful
with the growing wealth of eukaryotic genomes.
