Wolbachia, one of the most widespread endosymbionts, is a target for biological
control of mosquito-borne diseases (malaria and dengue virus), and antibiotic
elimination of infectious filarial nematodes. We sequenced and analyzed the
genome of a new Wolbachia strain (wPpe) in the plant-parasitic nematode
Pratylenchus penetrans. Phylogenomic analyses placed wPpe as the earliest
diverging Wolbachia, suggesting two evolutionary invasions into nematodes. The
next branches comprised strains in sap-feeding insects, suggesting Wolbachia may 
have first evolved as a nutritional mutualist. Genome size, protein content, %GC,
and repetitive DNA allied wPpe with mutualistic Wolbachia, whereas gene
repertoire analyses placed it between parasite (A, B) and mutualist (C, D, F)
groups. Conservation of iron metabolism genes across Wolbachia suggests iron
homeostasis as a potential factor in its success. This study enhances our
understanding of this globally pandemic endosymbiont, highlighting genetic
patterns associated with host changes. Combined with future work on this strain, 
these genomic data could help provide potential new targets for plant-parasitic
nematode control.
