MMV007564 is a novel antimalarial benzimidazolyl piperidine chemotype identified 
in cellular screens. To identify the genetic determinant of MMV007564 resistance,
parasites were cultured in the presence of the compound to generate resistant
lines. Whole genome sequencing revealed distinct mutations in the gene named
Plasmodium falciparum cyclic amine resistance locus (pfcarl), encoding a
conserved protein of unknown function. Mutations in pfcarl are strongly
associated with resistance to a structurally unrelated class of compounds, the
imidazolopiperazines, including KAF156, currently in clinical trials. Our data
demonstrate that pfcarl mutations confer resistance to two distinct compound
classes, benzimidazolyl piperidines and imidazolopiperazines. However, MMV007564 
and the imidazolopiperazines, KAF156 and GNF179, have different timings of action
in the asexual blood stage and different potencies against the liver and sexual
blood stages. These data suggest that pfcarl is a multidrug-resistance gene
rather than a common target for benzimidazolyl piperidines and
imidazolopiperazines.
