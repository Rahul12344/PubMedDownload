Pharmaceutical terpenoids belong to the most diverse class of natural products.
They have significant curative effects on a variety of diseases, such as cancer, 
cardiovascular diseases, malaria and Alzheimer's disease. Nowadays, elicitors,
including biotic and abiotic elicitors, are often used to activate the pathway of
secondary metabolism and enhance the production of target terpenoids. Based on
Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation, several plant metabolic
engineering strategies hold great promise to regulate the biosynthesis of
pharmaceutical terpenoids. Overexpressing terpenoids biosynthesis pathway genes
in homologous and ectopic plants is an effective strategy to enhance the yield of
pharmaceutical terpenoids. Another strategy is to suppress the expression of
competitive metabolic pathways. In addition, global regulation which includes
regulating the relative transcription factors, endogenous phytohormones and
primary metabolism could also markedly increase their yield. All these strategies
offer great opportunities to enhance the supply of scarce terpenoids drugs,
reduce the price of expensive drugs and improve people's standards of living.
