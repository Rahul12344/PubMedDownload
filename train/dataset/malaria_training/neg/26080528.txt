OBJECTIVE: To identity Plasmodium ovale infection by 18S rRNA gene nested PCR.
METHODS: Whole blood and filter paper blood samples of malaria patients in
Shandong Province were collected during 2012-2013. The parasites were observed
under a microscope with Giemsa staining. The genome DNA of blood samples were
extracted as PCR templates. Genus- and species-specific primers were designed
according to the Plasmodium 18S rRNA gene sequences. Plasmodium ovale-positive
specimens were identified by nested PCR as well as verified by sequencing.
RESULTS: There were 7 imported cases of P. ovale infection in the province during
2012-2013. Nested PCR results showed that the P. ovale specific band (800 bp) was
amplified in all the 7 specimens. Blast results indicated that the PCR products
were consistent with the Plasmodium ovale reference sequence in GenBank.
CONCLUSION: Seven imported cases of ovale malaria in Shandong Province in
2012-2013 are confirmed by nested PCR.
