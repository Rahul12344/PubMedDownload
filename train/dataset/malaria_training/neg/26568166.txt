In vitro cultivation of Plasmodium falciparum is critical for studying the
biology of this parasite. However, it is likely that different in vitro
cultivation conditions influence various aspects of the parasite's life cycle. In
the present study two P. falciparum isolates were cultivated using the two most
common methods, in which AlbuMAX or human serum as additives are used, and the
results were compared. The type of cultivation influenced the knob structure of
P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IEs). IEs cultivated with AlbuMAX had fewer 
knobs than those cultivated with human serum. Furthermore, knob size varied
between isolates and is also depended on the culture medium. In addition, there
was a greater reduction in the cytoadhesion of IEs to various endothelial
receptors in the presence of AlbuMAX than in the presence of human serum.
Surprisingly, cytoadhesion did not correlate with the presence or absence of
knobs. Greater numbers of the variant surface antigen families RIFIN, STEVOR, and
PfMC-2TM were found at the IE membrane when cultivated in the presence of
AlbuMAX. Moreover, the type of cultivation had a marked influence on the
transcriptome profile. Compared with cultivation with human serum, cultivation
with AlbuMAX increased the expression of approximately 500-870 genes.
