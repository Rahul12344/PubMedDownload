Malaria causes high global mortality and morbidity annually. Plasmodium knowlesi 
has been recognised as the fifth human Plasmodium sp. and its infection is widely
distributed in Southeast Asia. Merozoite surface protein-119 (MSP-119) appears as
a potential candidate for malaria blood stage vaccine as it could induce
protective immunity. In this study, codon optimized P. knowlesi MSP-119
(pkMSP-119) was expressed and purified in yeast Pichia pastoris expression
system. The purified recombinant protein was further evaluated using Western blot
assay using knowlesi malaria, non-knowlesi human malaria, non-malarial parasitic 
infections and healthy serum samples (n = 50). The sensitivity of purified
pkMSP-119 towards detection of knowlesi infection was as 28.6% (2/7). pkMSP-119
did not react with all non-malarial parasitic infections and healthy donor sera, 
yet reacted with some non-knowlesi human malaria sera, therefore lead to a
specificity of 86.0% (37/43).
