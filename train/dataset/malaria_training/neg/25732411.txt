In the present study, we identified and characterised the complete coding
sequence of Babesia orientalis apical membrane antigen 1 (designated Bo-ama1); it
is 1803bp in length and encodes a polypeptide of 601 amino acids (aa). The
Bo-ama-1 gene product (Bo-AMA1) is predicted to be 67kDa in size and contains a
signal peptide. Mature Bo-AMA1 is predicted to have one transmembrane region and 
a short cytoplasmic tail (C-terminal domain). The extracellular part of Bo-AMA1
has three functional domains (DI, DII and DIII) with 14 conserved cysteine
residues. A Bo-AMA1 fragment containing all three of these domains (designated
Bo-AMA1-DI/II/III) was cloned into the plasmid vector pET-28a and expressed as a 
recombinant (His-fusion) protein of 53kDa. Antibodies in the serum from a B.
orientalis-infected water buffalo specifically recognised this protein in
immunoblotting analysis. Rabbit antibodies raised against the recombinant protein
were able to detect native Bo-AMA1 (67kDa) from erythrocytes of B.
orientalis-infected water buffalo. Bo-AMA1 is a new member of the AMA1 family and
might be a good antigen for the specific detection of antibodies produced in B.
orientalis infected cattle. This protein is likely to play critical roles during 
host cell adherence and invasion by B. orientalis, as the AMA1s reported in other
organisms such as Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii. Further research
is required to explore the biological functions of this protein and to determine 
whether its immunisation can induce protective effects in water buffalo against
B. orientalis infection.
