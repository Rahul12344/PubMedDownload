African populations are characterized by high degree of genetic diversity. This
high genetic diversity could result from the natural selection pressure. Several 
studies have described an association between some genetic diversities and
difference of susceptibility to infectious diseases like malaria. It seems
therefore important to consider genetic diversity impact when interpreting
results of clinical trials in malaria endemic areas. This study aimed to
determine the genetic polymorphism with erythrocyte traits in different
populations of malaria endemic area in Mali. The cross-sectional surveys were
carried out in different ethnic groups living in malaria endemic areas in Mali.
Six milliliters of whole blood were collected in EDTA vials from each participant
after informed consent has been obtained. The ABO, RH, Kell, MNSs, Kidd and Duffy
systems phenotypes were assessed by the technique of gel filtration. A total of
231 subjects were included from six villages. The blood groups phenotypes O
(40.7%) and A (31.2%) were more frequent with respective allele frequencies of
0.65 and 0.21. In the RH system the haplotypes R0 (0.55), r (0.20) and R1 (0.13) 
were the most frequent. Seven percent (7%) of Duffy positive and 4% of
Glycophorin B deficiency (S-s-) were observed among participants. All
participants were Kell negative. ABO and RH systems were polymorphic in these
ethnic groups in Mali. Their implication in susceptibility to malaria should be
taken into account in clinical trials interpretation, and for prevention of blood
transfusion risks during anemia frequently caused by malaria in children.
