In a genome-wide screen for alpha-helical coiled coil motifs aiming at
structurally defined vaccine candidates we identified PFF0165c. This protein is
exported in the trophozoite stage and was named accordingly Trophozoite exported 
protein 1 (Tex1). In an extensive preclinical evaluation of its coiled coil
peptides Tex1 was identified as promising novel malaria vaccine candidate
providing the rational for a comprehensive cell biological characterization of
Tex1. Antibodies generated against an intrinsically unstructured N-terminal
region of Tex1 and against a coiled coil domain were used to investigate
cytological localization, solubility and expression profile. Co-localization
experiments revealed that Tex1 is exported across the parasitophorous vacuole
membrane and located to Maurer's clefts. Change in location is accompanied by a
change in solubility: from a soluble state within the parasite to a
membrane-associated state after export to Maurer's clefts. No classical export
motifs such as PEXEL, signal sequence/anchor or transmembrane domain was
identified for Tex1.
