Placental malaria infections are caused by Plasmodium falciparum-infected red
blood cells sequestering in the placenta by binding to chondroitin sulfate A,
mediated by VAR2CSA, a variant of the PfEMP1 family of adhesion antigens. Recent 
studies have shown that many P. falciparum genomes have multiple genes coding for
different VAR2CSA proteins, and parasites with >1 var2csa gene appear to be more 
common in pregnant women with placental malaria than in nonpregnant individuals. 
We present evidence that, in pregnant women, parasites containing multiple
var2csa-type genes possess a selective advantage over parasites with a single
var2csa gene. Accumulation of parasites with multiple copies of the var2csa gene 
during the course of pregnancy was also correlated with the development of
antibodies involved in blocking VAR2CSA adhesion. The data suggest that
multiplicity of var2csa-type genes enables P. falciparum parasites to persist for
a longer period of time during placental infections, probably because of their
greater capacity for antigenic variation and evasion of variant-specific immune
responses.
