Elucidation of the evolutionary history and interrelatedness of Plasmodium
species that infect humans has been hampered by a lack of genetic information for
three human-infective species: P. malariae and two P. ovale species (P. o.
curtisi and P. o. wallikeri). These species are prevalent across most regions in 
which malaria is endemic and are often undetectable by light microscopy,
rendering their study in human populations difficult. The exact evolutionary
relationship of these species to the other human-infective species has been
contested. Using a new reference genome for P. malariae and a manually curated
draft P. o. curtisi genome, we are now able to accurately place these species
within the Plasmodium phylogeny. Sequencing of a P. malariae relative that
infects chimpanzees reveals similar signatures of selection in the P. malariae
lineage to another Plasmodium lineage shown to be capable of colonization of both
human and chimpanzee hosts. Molecular dating suggests that these host adaptations
occurred over similar evolutionary timescales. In addition to the core genome
that is conserved between species, differences in gene content can be linked to
their specific biology. The genome suggests that P. malariae expresses a family
of heterodimeric proteins on its surface that have structural similarities to a
protein crucial for invasion of red blood cells. The data presented here provide 
insight into the evolution of the Plasmodium genus as a whole.
