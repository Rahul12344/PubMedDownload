Genetic modification of Plasmodium falciparum is a key molecular tool for the
investigation of the biology and pathogenesis of this important human pathogen.
The most effective means to introduce exogenous DNA into P. falciparum is via
passive uptake following invasion into a DNA-loaded erythrocyte. Using
bioluminescence as a tool to quantify transfection efficiency, parameters
previously judged empirically to enhance transfection efficiency were subjected
to a quantitative analysis. This report supports roles for fresh erythrocytes and
growth medium supplemented with human serum in enhancing transfection efficiency.
Critically, a proposed enhancement to transfection efficiency through continued
feeding with DNA-loaded erythrocytes is not borne out in this study, and actually
appears to be detrimental.
