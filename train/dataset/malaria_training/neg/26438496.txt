Polymorphism in the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter
(PfCRT) was shown to cause chloroquine resistance. In this report, we examined
the antimalarial potential of novel 3-halo chloroquine derivatives (3-chloro,
3-bromo, and 3-iodo) against chloroquine-susceptible and -resistant P.
falciparum. All three derivatives inhibited the proliferation of P. falciparum;
with 3-iodo chloroquine being most effective. Moreover, 3-iodo chloroquine was
highly effective at potentiating and reversing chloroquine toxicity of
drug-susceptible and -resistant P. falciparum.
