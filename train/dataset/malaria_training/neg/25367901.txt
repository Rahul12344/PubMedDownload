The resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to some antimalarial drugs is linked to
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Currently, there are no methods for the
identification of resistant parasites that are sufficiently simple, cheap, and
fast enough to be performed at point-of-care, i.e., in local hospitals where
drugs are prescribed. Primer extension methods (PEXT) were developed to identify 
4 SNPs in P. falciparum positioned at amino acids 86, 184, and 1246 of the P.
falciparum multidrug resistance 1 gene (pfmdr1) and amino acid 76 of the
chloroquine resistance transporter gene (pfcrt). The PEXT products were
visualized by a nucleic acid lateral flow immunoassay (NALFIA) with carbon
nanoparticles as the detection labels. PCR-PEXT-NALFIAs showed good correlation
to the reference methods, quantitative PCR (qPCR) or direct amplicon sequence
analysis, in an initial open-label evaluation with 17 field samples. The tests
were further evaluated in a blind study design in a set of 150 patient isolates. 
High specificities of 98 to 100% were found for all 4 PCR-PEXT genotyping assays.
The sensitivities ranged from 75% to 100% when all PEXT-positive tests were
considered. A number of samples with a low parasite density were successfully
characterized by the reference methods but failed to generate a result in the
PCR-PEXT-NALFIA, particularly those samples with microscopy-negative subpatent
infections. This proof-of principle study validates the use of PCR-PEXT-NALFIA
for the detection of resistance-associated mutations in P. falciparum,
particularly for microscopy-positive infections. Although it requires a standard 
thermal cycler, the procedure is cheap and rapid and thus a potentially valuable 
tool for point-of-care detection in developing countries.
