BACKGROUND: Malaria control and prevention efforts continue to rely heavily on
the use of medicines especially artemisinin agents. However, currently, the
emergence of artemisinin resistance threatens this effort globally. The K13-gene 
polymorphisms associated with artemisinin resistance have been detected in
Southeast Asia. In countries outside Southeast Asia, artemisinin resistance has
not yet been confirmed.
METHODS/DESIGN: The articles will be obtained from the search of MEDLINE via
PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and LILACS/VHL databases. Mesh terms will be used in the 
article search. Boolean operators ("AND", "OR") will be used in the article
search. Article search will be done independently by two librarians (RS and AK). 
The articles will be screened for inclusion using set criteria and following the 
PRISMA guidelines. Data extraction will be done by two independent reviewers (NL 
and BB), Kappa statistic will be calculated, and any discrepancies resolved by
discussion. Heterogeneity in the articles will be established using I2 statistic.
DISCUSSION: This review will focus on establishing the K13-gene polymorphisms
among Plasmodium falciparum parasites reported from previous studies in
malaria-affected countries. Artemisinin resistance has not been widely reported
among parasites in Africa and other malaria-endemic countries outside Southeast
Asia. However, several studies on artemisinin resistance have reported different 
K13-gene polymorphisms from the validated mutations found in Southeast Asia. This
study will collate evidence from previous studies on the commonly reported K13
-gene polymorphisms among P. falciparum parasites in malaria-affected countries.
