Estimates of malaria transmission intensity (MTI) typically rely upon microscopy 
or rapid diagnostic testing (RDT). However, these methods are less sensitive than
nucleic acid amplification techniques and may underestimate parasite prevalence. 
We compared microscopy, RDT, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the
diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia as part of an MTI study of 800
children and adults conducted in Lilongwe, Malawi. PCR detected more cases of
parasitemia than microscopy or RDT. Age less than 5 years predicted parasitemia
detected by PCR alone (adjusted odds ratio = 1.61, 95% confidence interval =
1.09-2.38, Wald P = 0.02). In addition, we identified one P. falciparum parasite 
with a false-negative RDT result due to a suspected deletion of the
histidine-rich protein 2 (hrp2) gene and used a novel, ultrasensitive PCR assay
to detect low-level parasitemia missed by traditional PCR. Molecular methods
should be considered for use in future transmission studies as a supplement to
RDT or microscopy.
