Deletion of the pfhrp2 gene in Plasmodium falciparum can lead to false-negative
rapid diagnostic test (RDT) results, constituting a major challenge for
evidence-based malaria treatment. Here we analyzed the whole genome sequences of 
138 P. falciparum clinical samples collected from the China-Myanmar boarder for
pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletions. We found pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions in 9.4%
and 3.6% of samples, respectively, with no samples harboring deletions of both
genes. The pfhrp2 deletions showed 2 distinct breakpoints, representing 2
different chromosomal deletion events. A phylogenetic analysis performed using
genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms revealed that the 2 pfhrp2 breakpoint
groups as well as all the pfhrp3-negative parasites formed separate clades,
suggesting they might have resulted from clonal expansion of pfhrp2- and
pfhrp3-negative parasites. These findings highlight the need for urgent surveys
to determine the prevalence of pfhrp2-negative parasites causing false-negative
RDT results and a plan for switching of RDTs pending the survey results.
