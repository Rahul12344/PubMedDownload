After transmission by Anopheles mosquitoes, Plasmodium sporozoites travel to the 
liver, infect hepatocytes, and rapidly develop as intrahepatocytic liver stages
(LS). Rodent models of malaria exhibit large differences in the magnitude of
liver infection, both between parasite species and between strains of mice. This 
has been mainly attributed to differences in innate immune responses and parasite
infectivity. Here, we report that BALB/cByJ mice are more susceptible to
Plasmodium yoelii preerythrocytic infection than BALB/cJ mice. This difference
occurs at the level of early hepatocyte infection, but expression levels of
reported host factors that are involved in infection do not correlate with
susceptibility. Interestingly, BALB/cByJ hepatocytes are more frequently
polyploid; thus, their susceptibility converges on the previously observed
preference of sporozoites to infect polyploid hepatocytes. Gene expression
analysis demonstrates hepatocyte-specific differences in mRNA abundance for
numerous genes between BALB/cByJ and BALB/cJ mice, some of which encode
hepatocyte surface molecules. These data suggest that a yet-unknown receptor for 
sporozoite infection, present at elevated levels on BALB/cByJ hepatocytes and
also polyploid hepatocytes, might facilitate Plasmodium liver infection.
