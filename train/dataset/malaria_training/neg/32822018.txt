5-Methylcytosine (5mC) is an epigenetic mark known to contribute to the
regulation of gene expression in a wide range of biological systems. Ten Eleven
Translocation (TET) dioxygenases oxidize 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine,
5-formylcytosine, and 5-carboxylcytosine in metazoans and fungi. Moreover, two
recent reports imply the existence of other species of modified cytosine in
unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum. Here we provide an overview of the spectrum of cytosine modifications
and their roles in demethylation of DNA and regulation of gene expression in
different eukaryotic organisms.
