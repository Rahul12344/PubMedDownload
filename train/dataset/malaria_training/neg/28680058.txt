Calcium Dependent Protein Kinases are key effectors of calcium signaling in
malaria parasite. PfCDPK1 is critical for asexual development of Plasmodium
falciparum, but its precise function and substrates remain largely unknown. Using
a conditional knockdown strategy, we here establish that this kinase is critical 
for the invasion of host erythrocytes. Furthermore, using a multidisciplinary
approach involving comparative phosphoproteomics we gain insights into the
underlying molecular mechanisms. We identify substrates of PfCDPK1, which
includes proteins of Inner Membrane Complex and glideosome-actomyosin motor
assembly. Interestingly, PfCDPK1 phosphorylates PfPKA regulatory subunit
(PfPKA-R) and regulates PfPKA activity in the parasite, which may be relevant for
the process of invasion. This study delineates the signaling network of PfCDPK1
and sheds light on mechanisms via which it regulates invasion.Calcium dependent
protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) plays an important role in asexual development of
Plasmodium falciparum. Using phosphoproteomics and conditional knockdown of
CDPK1, the authors here identify CDPK1 substrates and a cross-talk between CDPK1 
and PKA, and show the role of CDPK1 in parasite invasion.
