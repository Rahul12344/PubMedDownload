Artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum was associated with mutations in 
the propeller domain of the PfK13 gene and increased
phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PfPI3K) activity. Assessment of the genetic
diversity of the PfK13 ortholog PvK12 in Plasmodium vivax field samples from the 
same hotspots of P. falciparum artemisinin resistance revealed a limited genetic 
diversity of PvK12. Following the same logic, we analyzed genetic variations of
the PvPI3K gene in 188 P. vivax field isolates from two geographic locations
along the China-Myanmar border. Overall, high genetic diversity of PvPI3K was
observed; parasites from Yunnan's Tengchong County had higher genetic diversity
than those from Laiza Township, Kachin State, Myanmar. Almost all the neutrality 
tests applied detected statistically significant deviation from zero. The
negative Tajima's D values in both populations implicated that PvPI3K gene might 
have experienced either a directional selection or an expansion in population
size. There was low linkage disequilibrium between the PvPI3K mutations in both
populations, suggesting the existence of large, almost panmictic, parasite
populations that enabled effective recombination. This later result was confirmed
by the detection of a minimum of five recombination events in each population
with two major breakpoints. Multiple tests for selection confirmed a signature of
purifying selection on PvPI3K. All the amino acid mutations were predicted to be 
neutral for the PI3K protein's function. These findings provide insights on the
genetic diversity of P. vivax populations along the China-Myanmar border.
