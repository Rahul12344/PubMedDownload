Amongst host genetic factors, cytokine gene polymorphism can be anticipated to be
an important factor as qualitative, quantitative and time of secretion play an
important role in disease outcome. We have investigated association of cytokine
promoter SNPs with risk of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and disease severity in 
a case control study in malaria endemic Karbi Anglong district of Assam, India.
Frequency of IL-8-251T/A (p=0.03 and p=0.01) and TGF-β1-509C/T (p=0.02 and
p=0.03) was higher in malaria in comparison to control participants and
non-malarial fever controls. Interestingly, a higher frequency of mutant allele
of IL-10-819T/C was observed in non-malarial fever controls compared to malaria
thus suggesting its role as a distinguishing marker of the two disease groups.
Higher IL-8 expression and increased frequency of IL-8-251T/A in complicated
malaria (p=0.002) was reported indicating its role in susceptibility to
complicated malaria. In conclusion, our study suggests the role of mutant
genotype of IL-8-251T/A as a marker of complicated malaria in our population.
Surprisingly, decreased expression of TGF-β1 in uncomplicated malaria even in
presence of high expressing mutant genotype was observed and needs to be
investigated in context of the pool of activated cells producing the cytokine.
