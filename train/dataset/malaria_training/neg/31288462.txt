Conductive biopolymers, an important class of functional materials, have received
attention in various fields because of their unique electrical, optical, and
physical properties. In this study, the polymerization of heme into hemozoin was 
carried out in an in vitro system by the newly developed heme polymerase
(histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP-II)). The HRP-II was produced by recombinant E.
coli BL21 from the Plasmodium falciparum gene. To improve the hemozoin
production, the reaction conditions on the polymerization were investigated and
the maximum production was achieved after about 790 μM at 34 °C with 200 rpm for 
24 h. As a result, the production was improved about two-fold according to the
stepwise optimization in an in vitro system. The produced hemozoin was
qualitatively analyzed using the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, 
energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM). Finally, it was confirmed that the enzymatically polymerized hemozoin had 
similar physical properties to chemically synthesized hemozoin. These results
could represent a significant potential for nano-biotechnology applications, and 
also provide guidance in research related to hemozoin utilization.
