BACKGROUND: Anopheles funestus is among the major malaria vectors in Kenya and
sub-Saharan Africa and has been recently implicated in persistent malaria
transmission. However, its ecology and genetic diversity remain poorly understood
in Kenya.
METHODS: Using 16 microsatellite loci, we examined the genetic structure of An.
funestus sampled from 11 locations (n = 426 individuals) across a wide
geographical range in Kenya spanning coastal, western and Rift Valley areas.
RESULTS: Kenyan An. funestus resolved as three genetically distinct clusters. The
largest cluster (FUN1) broadly included samples from western and Rift Valley
areas of Kenya with two clusters identified from coastal Kenya (FUN2 and FUN3),
not previously reported. Geographical distance had no effect on population
differentiation of An. funestus. We found a significant variation in the mean
Plasmodium infectivity between the clusters (Ï‡2 = 12.1, df = 2, P = 0.002) and
proportional to the malaria prevalence in the different risk zones of Kenya.
Notably, there was variation in estimated effective population sizes between the 
clusters, suggesting possible differential impact of anti-vector interventions in
represented areas.
CONCLUSIONS: Heterogeneity among Kenyan populations of An. funestus will impact
malaria vector control with practical implications for the development of
gene-drive technologies. The difference in Plasmodium infectivity and effective
population size between the clusters could suggest potential variation in
phenotypic characteristics relating to competence or insecticide resistance. This
is worth examining in future studies.
