BACKGROUND: Mexico advanced to the pre-elimination phase in 2009 due to a
significant reduction in malaria cases, and since 2000, Plasmodium vivax is the
only species transmitted. During the last two decades, malaria transmission has
been mostly local and isolated to a few regions. It is important to gain further 
insights into the impact of control measures on the parasite population
structure. Hence, the aim of the current study was to determine detailed changes 
in P. vivax genetic diversity and population structure based on analysing the
gene that encodes the apical membrane antigen 1 (pvama1). This analysis covered
from control to pre-elimination (1993-2011) in a hypo-endemic region in southern 
Mexico.
RESULTS: The 213 pvama1 I-II sequences presently analysed were grouped into six
periods of three years each. They showed low genetic diversity, with 15
haplotypes resolved. Among the DNA sequences, there was a gradual decrease in
genetic diversity, the number of mixed genotype infections and the intensity of
positive selection, in agreement with the parallel decline in malaria cases. At
the same time, linkage disequilibrium (R2) increased. The three-dimensional
haplotype network revealed that pvama1 I-II haplotypes were separated by 1-11
mutational steps, and between one another by 0-3 unsampled haplotypes. In the
temporal network, seven haplotypes were detected in at least two of the six-time 
layers, and only four distinct haplotypes were evidenced in the pre-elimination
phase. Structure analysis indicated that three subpopulations fluctuated over
time. Only 8.5% of the samples had mixed ancestry. In the pre-elimination phase, 
subpopulation P1 was drastically reduced, and the admixture was absent.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that P. vivax in southern Mexico evolved based
on local adaptation into three "pseudoclonal" subpopulations that diversified at 
the regional level and persisted over time, although with varying frequency.
Control measures and climate events influenced the number of malaria cases and
the genetic structure. The sharp decrease in parasite diversity and other related
genetic parameters during the pre-elimination phase suggests that malaria
elimination is possible in the near future. These results are useful for
epidemiological surveillance.
