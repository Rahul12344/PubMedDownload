Tafenoquine is an 8-aminoquinoline under investigation for the prevention of
relapse in Plasmodium vivax malaria. This open-label, dose-escalation study
assessed quantitatively the hemolytic risk with tafenoquine in female healthy
volunteers heterozygous for the Mahidol487A glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD)-deficient variant versus G6PD-normal females, and with reference to
primaquine. Six G6PD-heterozygous subjects (G6PD enzyme activity 40-60% of
normal) and six G6PD-normal subjects per treatment group received single-dose
tafenoquine (100, 200, or 300 mg) or primaquine (15 mg × 14 days). All
participants had pretreatment hemoglobin levels ≥ 12.0 g/dL. Tafenoquine dose
escalation stopped when hemoglobin decreased by ≥ 2.5 g/dL (or hematocrit decline
≥ 7.5%) versus pretreatment values in ≥ 3/6 subjects. A dose-response was evident
in G6PD-heterozygous subjects (N = 15) receiving tafenoquine for the maximum
decrease in hemoglobin versus pretreatment values. Hemoglobin declines were
similar for tafenoquine 300 mg (-2.65 to -2.95 g/dL [N = 3]) and primaquine
(-1.25 to -3.0 g/dL [N = 5]). Two further cohorts of G6PD-heterozygous subjects
with G6PD enzyme levels 61-80% (N = 2) and > 80% (N = 5) of the site median
normal received tafenoquine 200 mg; hemolysis was less pronounced at higher G6PD 
enzyme activities. Tafenoquine hemolytic potential was dose dependent, and
hemolysis was greater in G6PD-heterozygous females with lower G6PD enzyme
activity levels. Single-dose tafenoquine 300 mg did not appear to increase the
severity of hemolysis versus primaquine 15 mg × 14 days.
