Drug resistant Plasmodium falciparum parasites represent a major obstacle in our 
efforts to control malaria, a deadly vector borne infectious disease. This
situation creates an urgent need to find and validate new drug targets to contain
the spread of the disease. Several genes associated with the unfolded protein
response (UPR) including Glucose-regulated Protein 78â€‰kDa (GRP78, also known as
BiP) have been deemed potential drug targets. We explored the drug target
potential of GRP78, a molecular chaperone that is a regulator of the UPR, for the
treatment of P. falciparum parasite infection. By screening repurposed chaperone 
inhibitors that are anticancer agents, we showed that GRP78 inhibition is lethal 
to drug-sensitive and -resistant P. falciparum parasite strains in vitro. We
correlated the antiplasmodial activity of the inhibitors with their ability to
bind the malaria chaperone, by characterizing their binding to recombinant
parasite GRP78. Furthermore, we determined the crystal structure of the ATP
binding domain of P. falciparum GRP78 with ADP and identified structural features
unique to the parasite. These data suggest that P. falciparum GRP78 can be a
valid drug target and that its structural differences to human GRP78 emphasize
potential to generate parasite specific compounds.
