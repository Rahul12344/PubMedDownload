BACKGROUND: The major malaria vector in Sri Lanka is reported to be Anopheles
culicifacies with Anopheles subpictus, Anopheles annularis, and Anopheles varuna 
considered as potential vectors. The occurrence of Anopheles stephensi, which is 
the key vector of urban malaria in India and the Middle East, had never been
reported from Sri Lanka.
METHODS: A series of entomological investigations were carried out by the Anti
Malaria Campaign, Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka during December 2016 to April
2017 in two localities of the Mannar District in the Northern Province of the
country. Adult mosquito collections were done through indoor and outdoor resting 
collections, animal and human biting collections and emergence traps. Potential
mosquito breeding sites were investigated through larval surveys. The larvae and 
adults of An. stephensi were initially identified using morphological keys, and
subsequently confirmed by sequencing the barcode region of the cytochrome c
oxidase I (COI) gene.
RESULTS: This is the first report of the presence of An. stephensi in the island 
of Mannar in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. Anopheles stephensi (36.65%) was
the most abundant anopheline species in the larval habitats in Mannar. It was
found breeding together with An. culicifacies (20.7%), An. subpictus (13.5%) and 
An. varuna (28.13%). Anopheles stephensi was found to be abundantly breeding in
built wells used for domestic purposes. Adult females of An. stephensi were
observed in emergence trap collections (93.9%), human landing catches all night
(79.2%), pyrethrum spray sheet collections (38.6%), outdoor collections (8.3%),
donkey-baited trap collections (14.3), and cattle-baited net trap collections
(0.7%).
CONCLUSIONS: Sri Lanka was certified as malaria-free by the WHO in September
2016, however, this new finding may pose a serious challenge to the efforts of
the Ministry of Health to prevent the re-introduction of malaria transmission in 
the country, considering the role that An. stephensi could play in urban and high
vulnerability areas of Sri Lanka.
