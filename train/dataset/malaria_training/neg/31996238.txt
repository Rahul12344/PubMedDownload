BACKGROUND: Vaccination induces survival of otherwise lethal blood-stage
infections of the experimental malaria Plasmodium chabaudi. Blood-stage malaria
induces extramedullary erythropoiesis in the liver. This study investigates how
vaccination affects the course of malaria-induced expression of erythrocytic
genes in the liver.
METHODS: Female Balb/c mice were vaccinated at week 3 and week 1 before
challenging with 106 P. chabaudi-parasitized erythrocytes. The non-infectious
vaccine consisted of erythrocyte ghosts isolated from P. chabaudi-infected
erythrocytes. Gene expression microarrays and quantitative real-time PCR were
used to compare mRNA expression of different erythrocytic genes in the liver of
vaccination-protected and non-protected mice during infections on days 0, 1, 4,
8, and 11 p.i.
RESULTS: Global transcriptomics analyses reveal vaccination-induced modifications
of malaria-induced increases in hepatic gene expression on days 4 and 11 p.i. On 
these days, vaccination also alters hepatic expression of the
erythropoiesis-involved genes Ermap, Kel, Rhd, Rhag, Slc4a1, Gypa, Add2, Ank1,
Epb4.1, Epb4.2, Epb4.9, Spta1, Sptb, Tmod1, Ahsp, Acyp1, Gata1, Gfi1b, Tal1,
Klf1, Epor, and Cldn13. In vaccination-protected mice, expression of these genes,
except Epb4.1, is significantly higher on day 4 p.i. than in un-protected
non-vaccinated mice, reaches maximal expression at peak parasitaemia on day 8
p.i., and is slowed down or even decreased towards the end of crisis phase on day
11 p.i.. After day 1 p.i., Epor expression takes about the same course as that of
the other erythroid genes. Hepatic expression of Epo, however, is delayed in both
vaccinated and non-vaccinated mice for the first 4 days p.i. and is maximal at
significantly higher levels in vaccinated mice on day 8 p.i., before declining
towards the end of crisis phase on day 11 p.i.
CONCLUSION: The present data indicate that vaccination accelerates
malaria-induced erythroblastosis in the liver for 1-2 days. This may contribute
to earlier replenishment of peripheral red blood cells by liver-derived
reticulocytes, which may favour final survival of otherwise lethal blood-stage
malaria, since reticulocytes are not preferred as host cells by P. chabaudi.
