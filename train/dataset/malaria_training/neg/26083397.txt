Six Hsp70-like genes are represented on the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. Of
these two occur in the cytosol: P. falciparum Hsp70-z (PfHsp70-z) and PfHsp70-1. 
PfHsp70-1 is a well characterised canonical Hsp70 that facilitates protein
quality control and is crucial for the development of malaria parasites. There is
very little known about PfHsp70-z. However, PfHsp70-z is known to be essential
and is implicated in suppressing aggregation of asparagine-rich proteins of P.
falciparum. In addition, its expression at the clinical stage of malaria
correlates with disease prognosis. Based on structural evidence PfHsp70-z belongs
to the Hsp110 family of proteins. Since Hsp110 proteins have been described as
nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) of their canonical Hsp70 counterparts, it has 
been speculated that PfHsp70-z may serve as a NEF of PfHsp70-1. In the current
study, P. falciparum cells cultured in vitro were subjected to heat stress,
triggering the enhanced expression of PfHsp70-z. Biochemical assays conducted
using recombinant PfHsp70-z protein demonstrated that the protein is heat stable 
and possesses ATPase activity. Furthermore, we observed that PfHsp70-z is capable
of self-association. The structural-functional features of PfHsp70-z provide
further evidence for its role as a chaperone and possible nucleotide exchange
factor of PfHsp70-1.
