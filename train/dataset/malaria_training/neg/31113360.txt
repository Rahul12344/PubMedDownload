BACKGROUND: In the arms race between hosts and parasites, genes involved in the
immune response are targets for natural selection. Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) genes
play a role in parasite detection as part of the innate immune system whereas
Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes encode proteins that display
antigens as part of the vertebrate adaptive immune system. Thus, both gene
families are under selection pressure from pathogens. The bananaquit (Coereba
flaveola) is a passerine bird that is a common host of avian malarial parasites
(Plasmodium sp. and Haemoproteus sp.). We assessed molecular variation of TLR and
MHC genes in a wild population of bananaquits and identified allelic associations
with resistance/susceptibility to parasitic infection to address hypotheses of
avian immune response to haemosporidian parasites.
RESULTS: We found that allele frequencies are associated with infection status at
the immune loci studied. A consistent general trend showed the infected groups
possessed more alleles at lower frequencies, and exhibited unique alleles,
compared to the uninfected group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the theory of natural selection favoring
particular alleles for resistance while maintaining overall genetic diversity in 
the population, a mechanism which has been demonstrated in some systems in MHC
previously but understudied in TLRs.
