BACKGROUND: Successful control programs have impeded local malaria transmission
in almost all Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries: Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait,
Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia. Nevertheless, a prodigious
influx of imported malaria via migrant workers sustains the threat of local
transmission. Here we examine the origin of imported malaria in Qatar, assess
genetic diversity and the prevalence of drug resistance genes in imported
Plasmodium falciparum, and finally, address the potential for the reintroduction 
of local transmission.
METHODS: This study examined imported malaria cases reported in Qatar, between
2013 and 2016. We focused on P. falciparum infections and estimated both total
parasite and gametocyte density, using qPCR and qRT-PCR, respectively. We also
examined ten neutral microsatellites and four genes associated with drug
resistance, Pfmrp1, Pfcrt, Pfmdr1, and Pfkelch13, to assess the genetic diversity
of imported P. falciparum strains, and the potential for propagating drug
resistance genotypes respectively.
RESULTS: The majority of imported malaria cases were P. vivax, while P.
falciparum and mixed species infections (P. falciparum / P. vivax) were less
frequent. The primary origin of P. vivax infection was the Indian subcontinent,
while P. falciparum was mostly presented by African expatriates. Imported P.
falciparum strains were highly diverse, carrying multiple genotypes, and
infections also presented with early- and late-stage gametocytes. We observed a
high prevalence of mutations implicated in drug resistance among these strains,
including novel SNPs in Pfkelch13.
CONCLUSIONS: The influx of genetically diverse P. falciparum, with multiple drug 
resistance markers and a high capacity for gametocyte production, represents a
threat for the reestablishment of drug-resistant malaria into GCC countries. This
scenario highlights the impact of mass international migration on the
reintroduction of malaria to areas with absent or limited local transmission.
