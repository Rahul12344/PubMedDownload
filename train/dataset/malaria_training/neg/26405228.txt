Assembly of protein complexes is considered a posttranslational process involving
random collision of subunits. We show that within the Escherichia coli cytosol,
bacterial luciferase subunits LuxA and LuxB assemble into complexes close to the 
site of subunit synthesis. Assembly efficiency decreases markedly if subunits are
synthesized on separate messenger RNAs from genes integrated at distant
chromosomal sites. Subunit assembly initiates cotranslationally on nascent LuxB
in vivo. The ribosome-associated chaperone trigger factor delays the onset of
cotranslational interactions until the LuxB dimer interface is fully exposed.
Protein assembly is thus directly coupled to the translation process and involves
spatially confined, actively chaperoned cotranslational subunit interactions.
Bacterial gene organization into operons therefore reflects a fundamental
cotranslational mechanism for spatial and temporal regulation that is vital to
effective assembly of protein complexes.
