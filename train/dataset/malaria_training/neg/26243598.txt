Obesity has increased continuously in western countries during the last several
decades and recently become a problem in developing countries. Currently,
anti-obesity drugs originating from natural products are being investigated for
their potential to overcome adverse effects associated with chemical drugs.
Artemisinic acid, which was isolated from the well-known anti-malaria herb
Artemisia annua (AA) L., was recently shown to possess anti-adipogenic effects in
vitro. However, the anti-adipogenic effects of AA in animal models have not yet
been investigated. Therefore, we conducted daily oral administration with AA
water extract in a diet-induced obesity animal model and treated 3T3-L1 cells
with AA to confirm the anti-adipogenic effects in the related protein
expressions. We then evaluated the physiology, adipose tissue histology and mRNA 
expressions of many related genes. Inhibition of adipogenesis by the AA water
extract was observed in vitro. In the animal model, weight gain was significantly
lower in the AA treated group, but there were no changes in food intake volume or
calories. Reductions in lipid droplet size and mRNA expression associated with
adipogenesis were also observed in animal epididymal fat. This study is the first
to report that AA has an anti-obese effects in vivo.
