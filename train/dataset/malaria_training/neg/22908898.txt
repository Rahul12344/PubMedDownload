BACKGROUND: Sabang Municipality, in Aceh Province, Indonesia, plans to initiate a
malaria elimination programme in 2013. A baseline survey of the distribution of
malaria in the municipality was conducted to lay the foundations for an
evidence-based programme and to assess the island's readiness to begin the
elimination process.
METHODS: The entire population of the municipality was screened for malaria
infection and G6PD deficiency. Specimens collected included blood slides, blots
and tubes for selected households.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Samples were collected from 16,229 residents. Microscopic
examination of the blood smears revealed 12 malaria infections; 10 with
Plasmodium falciparum and 2 with Plasmodium vivax. To confirm the parasite
prevalence, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnosis was performed on the entire
positive cases by microscopy and randomized 10% of the microscopically negative
blood samples. PCR revealed an additional 11 subjects with malaria; one P.
falciparum infection from the village of Paya Keunekai, and nine P. vivax
infections and one mixed P. falciparum/P. vivax infection from the village of
Batee Shok. The overall slide positivity rate was 0.074% (CI 95%: 0.070-0.078)
and PCR corrected prevalence 0,590% (CI 95%: 0.582-0.597). Analysis of 937 blood 
samples for G6PD deficiency revealed two subjects (0.2%) of deficient G6PD.
Analysis of several genes of the parasite, such as Pfdhfr, Pfdhps, Pfmdr1, Pfcrt,
Pfmsp1, Pfmsp2, Pvdhfr, Pvdhps, Pvmdr1 and host gene, such as G6PD gene revealed 
that both P. falciparum and P. vivax carried the mutation associated with
chloroquine resistance.
CONCLUSION: Malariometric and host genetic analysis indicated that there is a low
prevalence of both malaria and G6PD deficiency in the population of Sabang
Municipality. Nevertheless, malaria cases were clustered in three rural villages 
and efforts for malaria elimination in Sabang should be particularly focused on
those three villages.
