Worldwide malaria risk due to Plasmodium vivax makes development of vaccine
against P. vivax, a high priority. Serine Repeat Antigen of P. vivax (PvSERA) is 
a multigene family of blood stage proteins with 12 homologues. Sequence diversity
studies are important for understanding them as potential vaccine candidates. No 
information on N-terminal diversity of these genes is available in literature. In
this paper, we evaluate the genetic polymorphism of N-terminal regions of the
highly expressed member PvSERA4 and PvSERA5 genes from Indian field isolates. Our
results show that PvSERA4 has deletions and insertions in Glutamine rich
tetrameric repeat units contributing to its diversity. PvSERA5 also exhibits high
genetic diversity with non-synonymous substitutions leading to identification of 
novel haplotypes from India. Our first report helps in elucidating the allelic
variants of PvSERA genes in this region and contributes to evaluating their
efficacy as vaccine candidates.
