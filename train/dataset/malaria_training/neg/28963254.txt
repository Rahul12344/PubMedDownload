The mosquito's innate immune system controls both Plasmodium and bacterial
infections. We investigated the competitiveness of mosquitoes genetically
modified to alter expression of their own anti-Plasmodium immune genes in a
mixed-cage population with wild-type mosquitoes. We observed that genetically
modified mosquitoes with increased immune activity in the midgut tissue did not
have an observed fitness disadvantage and showed reduced microbial loads in both 
the midgut and reproductive organs. These changes result in a mating preference
of genetically modified males for wild-type females, whereas wild-type males
prefer genetically modified females. These changes foster the spread of the
genetic modification in a mosquito cage population.
