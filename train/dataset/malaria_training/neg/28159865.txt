Testes-biased genes evolve rapidly and are important in the establishment,
solidification, and maintenance of reproductive isolation between incipient
species. The Anopheles gambiae complex, a group of at least eight isomorphic
mosquito species endemic to Sub-Saharan Africa, is an excellent system to explore
the evolution of testes-biased genes. Within this group, the testes are an
important tissue in the diversification process because hybridization between
species results in sterile hybrid males, but fully fertile females. We conducted 
RNA sequencing of A. gambiae and A. merus carcass and testes to explore tissue-
and species-specific patterns of gene expression. Our data provides support for
transcriptional repression of X-linked genes in the male germline, which likely
drives demasculinization of the X chromosome. Testes-biased genes predominately
function in cellular differentiation and show a number of interesting patterns
indicative of their rapid evolution, including elevated dN/dS values, low
evolutionary conservation, poor annotation in existing reference genomes, and a
high likelihood of differential expression between species.
