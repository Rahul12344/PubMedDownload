Upon infection of a mammalian host, Plasmodium parasites first replicate inside
hepatocytes, generating thousands of new parasites. Although Plasmodium
intra-hepatic development represents a substantial metabolic challenge to the
host hepatocyte, how infected cells respond to and integrate this stress remains 
poorly understood. Here, we present proteomic and transcriptomic analyses,
revealing that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident unfolded protein response 
(UPR) is activated in host hepatocytes upon Plasmodium berghei infection. The
expression of XBP1s--the active form of the UPR mediator XBP1--and the
liver-specific UPR mediator CREBH is induced by P. berghei infection in vivo.
Furthermore, this UPR induction increases parasite liver burden. Altogether, our 
data suggest that ER stress is a central feature of P. berghei intra-hepatic
development, contributing to the success of infection.
