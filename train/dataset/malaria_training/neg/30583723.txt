BACKGROUND: The Asian malaria mosquito, Anopheles stephensi, is a major urban
malaria vector in the Middle East and on the Indian subcontinent. Early zygotic
transcription, which marks the maternal-to-zygotic transition, has not been
systematically studied in An. stephensi or any other Anopheles mosquitoes.
Improved understanding of early embryonic gene expression in An. stephensi will
facilitate genetic and evolutionary studies and help with the development of
novel control strategies for this important disease vector.
RESULTS: We obtained RNA-seq data in biological triplicates from four early An.
stephensi embryonic time points. Using these data, we identified 70 and 153 pure 
early zygotic genes (pEZGs) under stringent and relaxed conditions, respectively.
We show that these pEZGs are enriched in functional groups related to DNA-binding
transcription regulators, cell cycle modulators, proteases, transport, and
cellular metabolism. On average these pEZGs are shorter and have less introns
than other An. stephensi genes. Some of the pEZGs may arise de novo while others 
have clear non-pEZG paralogs. There is no or very limited overlap between An.
stephensi pEZGs and Drosophila melanogaster or Aedes aegypti pEZGs.
Interestingly, the upstream region of An. stephensi pEZGs lack significant
enrichment of a previously reported TAGteam/VBRGGTA motif found in the regulatory
region of pEZGs in D. melanogaster and Ae. aegypti. However, a GT-rich motif was 
found in An. stephensi pEZGs instead.
CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a number of pEZGs whose predicted functions and
structures are consistent with their collective roles in the degradation of
maternally deposited components, activation of the zygotic genome, cell division,
and metabolism. The pEZGs appear to rapidly turn over within the Dipteran order
and even within the Culicidae family. These pEZGs, and the shared regulatory
motif, could provide the promoter or regulatory sequences to drive gene
expression in the syncytial or early cellular blastoderm, a period when the
developing embryo is accessible to genetic manipulation. In addition, these
molecular resources may be used to achieve sex separation of mosquitoes for
sterile insect technique.
