The var gene-encoded erythrocyte membrane protein-1 of Plasmodium falciparum
(PfEMP-1) is the main variant surface antigen (VSA) expressed on infected
erythrocytes. The rate at which antibody responses to VSA expressed by
circulating parasites are acquired depends on the size of the local VSA
repertoire and the frequency of exposure to new VSA. Because parasites from areas
with declining malaria endemicity, such as the Amazon, typically express a
restricted PfEMP-1 repertoire, we hypothesized that Amazonians would rapidly
acquire antibodies to most locally circulating VSA. Consistent with our
expectations, the analysis of 5878 sequence tags expressed by 10 local
P. falciparum samples revealed little PfEMP-1 DBL1α domain diversity. Among the
most commonly expressed DBL1α types, 45% were shared by two or more independent
parasite lines. Nevertheless, Amazonians displayed major gaps in their repertoire
of anti-VSA antibodies, although the breadth of anti-VSA antibody responses
correlated positively with their cumulative exposure to malaria. We found little 
antibody cross-reactivity even when testing VSA from related parasites expressing
the same dominant DBL1α types. We conclude that variant-specific immunity to
P. falciparum VSAs develops slowly despite the relatively restricted PfEMP-1
repertoire found in low-endemicity settings.
