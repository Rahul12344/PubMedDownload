Aluminum salts have been used as vaccine adjuvants for >50 years, and they are
currently present in at least 146 licensed vaccines worldwide. In this study we
examined whether adsorption of Army Liposome Formulation (ALF) to an aluminum
salt that already has an antigen adsorbed to it might result in improved immune
potency of the aluminum-adsorbed antigen. ALF is composed of a family of anionic 
liposome-based adjuvants, in which the liposomes contain synthetic phospholipids 
having dimyristoyl fatty acyl groups, cholesterol and monophosphoryl lipid A
(MPLA). For certain candidate vaccines, ALF has been added to aluminum hydroxide 
(AH) gel as a second adjuvant to form ALFA. Here we show that different methods
of preparation of ALF changed the physical structures of both ALF and ALFA.
Liposomes containing the saponin QS21 (ALFQ) have also been mixed with AH to form
ALFQA as an effective combination. In this study, we first adsorbed one of two
different antigens to AH, either tetanus toxoid conjugated to 34 copies of a
hapten (MorHap), which has been used in a candidate heroin vaccine, or gp140
protein derived from the envelope protein of HIV-1. We then co-adsorbed ALF or
ALFQ to the AH to form ALFA or ALFQA. In each case, the immune potency of the
antigen adsorbed to AH was greatly increased by co-adsorbing either ALF or ALFQ
to the AH. Based on IgG subtype and cytokine analysis by ELISPOT, ALFA induced
predominately a Th2-type response and ALFQ and ALFQA each induced more balanced
Th1/Th2 responses.
