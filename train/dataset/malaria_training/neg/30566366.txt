Plasmodium falciparum remains a serious public health problem and a continuous
challenge for the immune system due to the complexity and diversity of the
pathogen. Recent advances from several laboratories in the characterization of
the antibody response to the parasite have led to the identification of critical 
targets for protection and revealed a new mechanism of diversification based on
the insertion of host receptors into immunoglobulin genes, leading to the
production of receptor-based antibodies. These advances have opened new
possibilities for vaccine design and passive antibody therapies to provide
sterilizing immunity and control blood-stage parasites.
