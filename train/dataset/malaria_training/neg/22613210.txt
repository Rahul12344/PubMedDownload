The 3'-5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKG) is
the main mediator of cGMP signalling in the malaria parasite. This article
reviews the role of PKG in Plasmodium falciparum during gametogenesis and blood
stage schizont rupture, as well as the role of the Plasmodium berghei orthologue 
in ookinete differentiation and motility, and liver stage schizont development.
The current views on potential effector proteins downstream of PKG and the
mechanisms that may regulate cyclic nucleotide levels are presented.
