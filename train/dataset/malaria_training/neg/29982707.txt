Background: Antigametocyte-specific immune responses may regulate Plasmodium
falciparum gametocyte density, providing the rationale for pursuing
transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) that target gametocytes in the human host.
Methods: To identify novel antigametocyte TBV antigens, we interrogated the
gametocyte proteome with our whole proteome differential screening method using
plasma from a treatment-reinfection study conducted in western Kenya. At the
start of the high-transmission season, 144 males (12-35 years) were enrolled and 
treated with quinine and doxycycline, peripheral venous blood samples were
obtained, volunteers were observed, and weekly blood films were obtained for 18
weeks to quantify gametocytemia. Using plasma pooled from individuals with low
versus high gametocyte carriage, we differentially screened a P falciparum
gametocyte stage complementary deoxyribonucleic acid expression library.
Results: We identified 8 parasite genes uniquely recognized by
gametocyte-resistant but not by gametocyte-susceptible individuals. Antibodies to
one of these antigens, PfsEGXP, predicted lower gametocytemia measured over the
18-week transmission season (P = .021). When analyzed dichotomously, anti-PfsEGXP
responders had 31% lower gametocyte density over 18 weeks of follow-up, compared 
with nonresponders (P = .04).
Conclusions: PfsEGXP is one of the first reported gametocyte-specific target of
antibodies that predict decreased gametocyte density in humans and supports our
novel TBV antigen discovery platform.
