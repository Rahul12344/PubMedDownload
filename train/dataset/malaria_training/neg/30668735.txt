Comment in
    J Infect Dis. 2019 Oct 22;220(11):1716-1718.

The Horn of Africa harbors the largest reservoir of Plasmodium vivax in the
continent. Most of sub-Saharan Africa has remained relatively vivax-free due to a
high prevalence of the human Duffy-negative trait, but the emergence of strains
able to invade Duffy-negative reticulocytes poses a major public health threat.
We undertook the first population genomic investigation of P. vivax from the
region, comparing the genomes of 24 Ethiopian isolates against data from
Southeast Asia to identify important local adaptions. The prevalence of the Duffy
binding protein amplification in Ethiopia was 79%, potentially reflecting
adaptation to Duffy negativity. There was also evidence of selection in a region 
upstream of the chloroquine resistance transporter, a putative
chloroquine-resistance determinant. Strong signals of selection were observed in 
genes involved in immune evasion and regulation of gene expression, highlighting 
the need for a multifaceted intervention approach to combat P. vivax in the
region.
