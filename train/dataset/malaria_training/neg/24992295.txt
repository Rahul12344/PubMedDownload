The pathogenesis of malaria is strongly correlated with secretion of the
micronemes, the apical organelles which contain the adhesins required for
invasion of Plasmodium falciparum into human erythrocytes. A critical event in P.
falciparum erythrocyte invasion is the production of calcium transients. After
entering the cell, Ca(2+) binds to soluble Ca(2+)-binding proteins, such as the
double C2 domains (DOC2). Recently, deletion of a P. falciparum DOC2 protein,
PfDOC2, was shown to cause impairment in microneme secretion. However, PfDOC2
remains poorly characterized. Here, we report that PfDOC2 is expressed throughout
the erythrocytic cycle and demonstrate that it is associated with membrane
fractions and binds to calcium when it is part of these membranous structures. In
summary, we show that PfDOC2 is a calcium lipid-binding protein of the protein
kinase C type of DOC2 proteins.
