Illumina library preparation methods for ultra-low input amounts were compared
using genomic DNA from two foodborne parasites (Angiostrongylus cantonensis and
Cyclospora cayetanensis) as examples. The Ovation Ultralow method resulted in
libraries with the highest concentration and produced quality sequencing data,
even when the input DNA was in the picogram range.
