We evaluated the influence of allelic frequency of the human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) -DRB1 on the acquisition of antibody response against malaria sporozoite
and merozoite peptides in patients with Plasmodium vivax malaria acquired in
endemic areas of Brazil. IgG antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay against four peptides of circumsporozoite protein (CSP)
(amino, carboxyl, and VK210 and VK247 repeats) and peptides of merozoite surface 
protein 1 (MSP-1), apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1), and Duffy-binding protein
(DBP). We found an association between HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR5 alleles and lack of
antibody response to CSP amino terminal, as well as an association between
HLA-DR3 and the highest antibody response to MSP1 (Pv200L). In conclusion, we
suggest a potential regulatory role of the HLA-DRB1 alleles in the production of 
antibodies to a conserved region of P. vivax CSP and MSP1 in Brazilian population
exposed to malaria.
