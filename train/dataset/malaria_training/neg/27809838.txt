BACKGROUND: Malaria is one of the most serious and widespread parasitic diseases 
affecting humans. Because of the spread of resistance in both parasites and the
mosquito vectors to anti-malarial drugs and insecticides, controlling the spread 
of malaria is becoming difficult. Thus, identifying new drug targets is urgently 
needed. Helicases play key roles in a wide range of cellular activities involving
DNA and RNA transactions, making them attractive anti-malarial drug targets.
METHODS: ATP-dependent DNA helicase gene (PfRuvB3) of Plasmodium falciparum
strain K1, a chloroquine and pyrimethamine-resistant strain, was inserted into
pQE-TriSystem His-Strep 2 vector, heterologously expressed and affinity purified.
Identity of recombinant PfRuvB3 was confirmed by western blotting coupled with
tandem mass spectrometry. Helicase and ATPase activities were characterized as
well as co-factors required for optimal function.
RESULTS: Recombinant PfRuvB3 has molecular size of 59 kDa, showing both DNA
helicase and ATPase activities. Its helicase activity is dependent on divalent
cations (Cu2+, Mg2+, Ni+2 or Zn+2) and ATP or dATP but is inhibited by high NaCl 
concentration (>100 mM). PfPuvB3 is unable to act on blunt-ended duplex DNA, but 
manifests ATPase activity in the presence of either single- or double-stranded
DNA. PfRuvB3.is inhibited by doxorubicin, daunorubicin and netropsin, known DNA
helicase inhibitors.
CONCLUSIONS: Purified recombinant PfRuvB3 contains both DNA helicase and ATPase
activities. Differences in properties of RuvB between the malaria parasite
obtained from the study and human host provide an avenue leading to the
development of novel drugs targeting specifically the malaria form of RuvB family
of DNA helicases.
