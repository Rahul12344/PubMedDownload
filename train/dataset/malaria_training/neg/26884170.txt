Ligands of the endothelial-enriched tunica interna endothelial cell kinase 2
(Tie2) are markedly imbalanced in severe infections associated with vascular
leakage, yet regulation of the receptor itself has been understudied in this
context. Here, we show that TIE2 gene expression may constitute a novel vascular 
barrier control mechanism in diverse infections. Tie2 expression declined rapidly
in wide-ranging models of leak-associated infections, including anthrax,
influenza, malaria, and sepsis. Forced Tie2 suppression sufficed to attenuate
barrier function and sensitize endothelium to permeability mediators. Rapid
reduction of pulmonary Tie2 in otherwise healthy animals attenuated downstream
kinase signaling to the barrier effector vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and
induced vascular leakage. Compared with wild-type littermates, mice possessing
one allele of Tie2 suffered more severe vascular leakage and higher mortality in 
two different sepsis models. Common genetic variants that influence TIE2
expression were then sought in the HapMap3 cohort. Remarkably, each of the three 
strongest predicted cis-acting SNPs in HapMap3 was also associated with the risk 
of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in an intensive care unit cohort of
1,614 subjects. The haplotype associated with the highest TIE2 expression
conferred a 28% reduction in the risk of ARDS independent of other major clinical
variables, including disease severity. In contrast, the most common haplotype was
associated with both the lowest TIE2 expression and 31% higher ARDS risk.
Together, the results implicate common genetic variation at the TIE2 locus as a
determinant of vascular leak-related clinical outcomes from common infections,
suggesting new tools to identify individuals at unusual risk for deleterious
complications of infection.
