Enhancers are cis-regulatory elements that control most of the developmental and 
spatial gene expression in eukaryotes. Genetic variation of enhancer sequences is
known to influence phenotypes, but the effect of enhancer variation upon enhancer
functional activity and downstream phenotypes has barely been examined in any
species. In the African malaria vector, Anopheles coluzzii, we identified
candidate enhancers in the proximity of genes relevant for immunity, insecticide 
resistance, and development. The candidate enhancers were functionally validated 
using luciferase reporter assays, and their activity was found to be essentially 
independent of their physical orientation, a typical property of enhancers. All
of the enhancers segregated genetically polymorphic alleles, which displayed
significantly different levels of functional activity. Deletion mutagenesis and
functional testing revealed a fine structure of positive and negative regulatory 
elements that modulate activity of the enhancer core. Enhancer polymorphisms
segregate in wild A. coluzzii populations in West Africa. Thus, enhancer variants
that modify target gene expression leading to likely phenotypic consequences are 
frequent in nature. These results demonstrate the existence of naturally
polymorphic A. coluzzii enhancers, which may help explain important differences
between individuals or populations for malaria transmission efficiency and vector
adaptation to the environment.
