BACKGROUND: Reported malaria cases in the Americas had been reduced to about
one-half million by 2012. To advance towards elimination of this disease, it is
necessary to gain insights into how the malaria parasite is evolving, including
the emergence, spread and persistence of new haplotypes in affected regions. In
here, the genetic diversity of the three major P. vivax merozoite genes was
analyzed.
METHODS: From P. vivax-infected blood samples obtained in southern Mexico (SMX)
during 2006-2007, nucleotide sequences were achieved for: the 42 kDa carboxyl
fragment of the merozoite surface protein-1 (msp1 42 ), domains I-II of the
apical membrane antigen-1 (ama1 I-II ), and domain II of the Duffy binding
protein (dbp II ). Gene polymorphism was examined and haplotype networks were
developed to depict parasite relationships in SMX. Then genetic diversity,
recombination and natural selection were analyzed and the degree of
differentiation was determined as FST values.
RESULTS: The diversity of P. vivax merozoite genes in SMX was less than that of
parasites from other geographic origins, with dbp II  < ama1 I-II  < msp1 42 .
Ama1 I-II and msp1 42 exposed the more numerous haplotypes exclusive to SMX.
While, all dbp II haplotypes from SMX were separated from one to three mutational
steps, the networks of ama1 I-II and msp1 42 were more complex; loops and
numerous mutational steps were evidenced, likely due to recombination. Sings of
local diversification were more evident for msp1 42 . Sixteen combined haplotypes
were determined; one of these haplotypes not detected in 2006 was highly frequent
in 2007. The Rm value was higher for msp1 42 than for ama1 I-II, being
insignificant for dbp II . The dN-dS value was highly significant for ama1 I-II
and lesser so for dbp II . The F ST values were higher for dbp II than msp1 42 , 
and very low for ama1 I-II .
CONCLUSIONS: In SMX, P. vivax ama1 I-II , dbp II and msp1 42 demonstrated limited
diversity, and exhibited a differentiated parasite population. The results
suggest that differential intensities of selective forces are operating on these 
gene fragments, and probably related to their timing, length of exposure and
function during reticulocyte adhesion and invasion. Therefore, these finding are 
essential for mono and multivalent vaccine development and for epidemiological
surveillance.
