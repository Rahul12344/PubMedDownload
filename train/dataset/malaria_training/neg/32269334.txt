In cells, organs and whole organisms, nutrient sensing is key to maintaining
homeostasis and adapting to a fluctuating environment1. In many animals, nutrient
sensors are found within the enteroendocrine cells of the digestive system;
however, less is known about nutrient sensing in their cellular siblings, the
absorptive enterocytes1. Here we use a genetic screen in Drosophila melanogaster 
to identify Hodor, an ionotropic receptor in enterocytes that sustains larval
development, particularly in nutrient-scarce conditions. Experiments in Xenopus
oocytes and flies indicate that Hodor is a pH-sensitive, zinc-gated chloride
channel that mediates a previously unrecognized dietary preference for zinc.
Hodor controls systemic growth from a subset of enterocytes-interstitial cells-by
promoting food intake and insulin/IGF signalling. Although Hodor sustains gut
luminal acidity and restrains microbial loads, its effect on systemic growth
results from the modulation of Tor signalling and lysosomal homeostasis within
interstitial cells. Hodor-like genes are insect-specific, and may represent
targets for the control of disease vectors. Indeed, CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing
revealed that the single hodor orthologue in Anopheles gambiae is an essential
gene. Our findings highlight the need to consider the instructive contributions
of metals-and, more generally, micronutrients-to energy homeostasis.
