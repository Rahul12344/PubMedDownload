DNA in dried blood spots of 39 vivax malaria patients (2009-2010) from Anhui
(Bengbu urban district and counties of Wuhe, Huaiyuan, Mengcheng and Lixin) was
extracted. The Plasmodium vivax LDH (PvLDH) gene was amplified, cloned and
sequenced. The sequences were subjected to NCBI Blast program. The results showed
that the targeted DNA fragment size was 951 bp without difference among the 39
samples (accession No. GU078391), and was more than 99% homologous to the PvLDH
sequences in other strains from GenBank. There was only one different amino acid 
in the protein sequences between the isolates from Anhui and EJEU60134 or
MIA061251 strains.
