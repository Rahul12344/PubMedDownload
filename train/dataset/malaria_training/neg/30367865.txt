Malaria parasite oocysts located on the mosquito midgut generate sporozoites by a
process called sporogony. Plasmodium berghei parasites express six LCCL lectin
domain adhesive-like proteins (LAPs), which operate as a complex and share a
localisation in the crystalloid - an organelle found in the ookinete and young
oocyst. Depletion of LAPs prevents crystalloid formation, increases oocyst
growth, and blocks sporogony. Here, we describe a LAP4 mutant that has abnormal
crystalloid biogenesis and produces oocysts that display reduced growth and
premature sporogony. These findings provide evidence for a role of the LAP
complex in regulating oocyst cell division via the crystalloid.
