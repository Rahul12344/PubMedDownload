We have shown that transgenic Plasmodium falciparum parasites expressing the
yeast DHODH (dihydroorotate dehydrogenase) are independent of the mtETC
(mitochondrial electron transport chain), suggesting that they might not need the
mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), since it only encodes three protein subunits
belonging to the mtETC and fragmentary ribosomal RNA molecules. Disrupting the
mitochondrial RNA polymerase (mtRNAP), which is critical for mtDNA replication
and transcription, might then cause the generation of a ρ(0) parasite line
lacking mtDNA. We made multiple attempts to disrupt the mtRNAP gene by double
crossover recombination methods in parasite lines expressing yDHODH either
episomally or integrated in the genome, but were unable to produce the desired
knockout. We verified that the mtRNAP gene was accessible to recombination by
successfully integrating a triple HA tag at the 3' end via single cross-over
recombination. These studies suggest that mtRNAP is essential even in
mtETC-independent P. falciparum parasites.
