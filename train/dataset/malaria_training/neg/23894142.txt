SUMMARY: The Malaria Genome Exploration Tool (MaGnET) is a software tool enabling
intuitive 'exploration-style' visualization of functional genomics data relating 
to the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. MaGnET provides innovative
integrated graphic displays for different datasets, including genomic location of
genes, mRNA expression data, protein-protein interactions and more. Any selection
of genes to explore made by the user is easily carried over between the different
viewers for different datasets, and can be changed interactively at any point
(without returning to a search).
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Free online use (Java Web Start) or download
(Java application archive and MySQL database; requires local MySQL installation) 
at http://malariagenomeexplorer.org

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics
online.
