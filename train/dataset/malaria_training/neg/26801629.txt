BACKGROUND: In December 2010, a Plasmodium vivax malaria outbreak occurred among 
French forces involved in a mission to control illegal gold mining in French
Guiana. The findings of epidemiological and entomological investigations
conducted after this outbreak are presented here.
METHODS: Data related to malaria cases reported to the French armed forces
epidemiological surveillance system were collected during the epidemic period
from December 2010 to April 2011. A retrospective cohort study was conducted to
identify presumed contamination sites. Anopheles mosquitoes were sampled at the
identified sites using Mosquito Magnet and CDC light traps. Specimens were
identified morphologically and confirmed using molecular methods (sequencing of
ITS2 gene and/or barcoding). Anopheles infections with Plasmodium falciparum and 
P. vivax were tested by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Seventy-two P. vivax malaria cases were reported (three were mixed P.
falciparum/P. vivax infections), leading to a global attack rate of 26.5%
(72/272). Lack of compliance with vector control measures and doxycycline
chemoprophylaxis was reported by patients. Two illegal gold mining sites located 
in remote areas in the primary forest were identified as places of contamination.
In all, 595 Anopheles females were caught and 528 specimens were formally
identified: 305 Anopheles darlingi, 145 Anopheles nuneztovari s.l., 63 Anopheles 
marajoara and 15 Anopheles triannulatus s.l. Three An. darlingi were infected by 
P. falciparum (infection rate: 1.1%) and four An. marajoara by P. vivax
(infection rate: 6.4%).
DISCUSSION: The main drivers of the outbreak were the lack of adherence by
military personnel to malaria prevention measures and the high level of malaria
transmission at illegal gold mining sites. Anopheles marajoara was clearly
implicated in malaria transmission for the first time in French Guiana. The high 
infection rates observed confirm that illegal gold mining sites must be
considered as high level malaria transmission areas in the territory.
CONCLUSIONS: Illegal gold mining activities are challenging the control of
malaria in French Guiana. Collaboration with neighbouring countries is necessary 
to take into account mobile populations such as gold miners. Malaria control
strategies in the French armed forces must be adapted to P. vivax malaria and
sylvatic Anopheles species.
