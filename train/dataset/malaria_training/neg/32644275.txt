SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic which is putting strain on the health-care
system and global economy. There is much pressure to develop both preventative
and curative therapies for SARS-CoV-2 as there is no evidence to support
therapies to improve outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Medications that
inhibit certain steps of virus life cycle that are currently used to treat other 
illnesses such as Malaria, Ebola, HIV and Hepatitis C are being studied for use
against SARS-CoV-2. To date, data is limited for medications that facilitate
clinical improvement of COVID-19 infections.
