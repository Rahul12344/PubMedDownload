BACKGROUND: Highly sensitive, scalable diagnostic methods are needed to guide
malaria elimination interventions. While traditional microscopy and rapid
diagnostic tests (RDTs) are suitable for the diagnosis of symptomatic malaria
infection, more sensitive tests are needed to screen for low-density,
asymptomatic infections that are targeted by interventions aiming to eliminate
the entire reservoir of malaria infection in humans.
METHODS: A reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) was
developed for multiplexed detection of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene and ribosomal
RNA of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Simulated field samples stored
for 14 days with sample preservation buffer were used to assess the analytical
sensitivity and specificity. Additionally, 1750 field samples from Southeastern
Myanmar were tested both by RDT and ultrasensitive RT-PCR.
RESULTS: Limits of detection (LoD) were determined under simulated field
conditions. When 0.3 mL blood samples were stored for 14 days at 28 °C and 80%
humidity, the LoD was less than 16 parasites/mL for P. falciparum and 19.7
copies/µL for P. vivax (using a plasmid surrogate), about 10,000-fold lower than 
RDTs. Of the 1739 samples successfully evaluated by both ultrasensitive RT-PCR
and RDT, only two were RDT positive while 24 were positive for P. falciparum, 108
were positive for P. vivax, and 127 were positive for either P. vivax and/or P.
falciparum using ultrasensitive RT-PCR.
CONCLUSIONS: This ultrasensitive RT-PCR method is a robust, field-tested
screening method that is vastly more sensitive than RDTs. Further optimization
may result in a truly scalable tool suitable for widespread surveillance of
low-level asymptomatic P. falciparum and P. vivax parasitaemia.
