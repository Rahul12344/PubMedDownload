BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the origins, distribution, and inheritance of variation 
in the malaria parasite (Plasmodium falciparum) genome is crucial for
understanding its evolution; however the 81% (A+T) genome poses challenges to
high-throughput sequencing technologies. We explore the viability of the Roche
454 Genome Sequencer FLX (GS FLX) high throughput sequencing technology for both 
whole genome sequencing and fine-resolution characterization of genetic exchange 
in malaria parasites.
RESULTS: We present a scheme to survey recombination in the haploid stage genomes
of two sibling parasite clones, using whole genome pyrosequencing that includes a
sliding window approach to predict recombination breakpoints. Whole genome
shotgun (WGS) sequencing generated approximately 2 million reads, with an average
read length of approximately 300 bp. De novo assembly using a combination of WGS 
and 3 kb paired end libraries resulted in contigs ≤ 34 kb. More than 8,000 of the
24,599 SNP markers identified between parents were genotyped in the progeny,
resulting in a marker density of approximately 1 marker/3.3 kb and allowing for
the detection of previously unrecognized crossovers (COs) and many non crossover 
(NCO) gene conversions throughout the genome.
CONCLUSIONS: By sequencing the 23 Mb genomes of two haploid progeny clones
derived from a genetic cross at more than 30× coverage, we captured high
resolution information on COs, NCOs and genetic variation within the progeny
genomes. This study is the first to resequence progeny clones to examine fine
structure of COs and NCOs in malaria parasites.
