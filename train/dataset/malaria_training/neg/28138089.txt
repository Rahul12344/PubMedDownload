OBJECTIVE: To determine the polymorphisms in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR)
of the G6PD gene and analyze the specific SNPs or haplotypes that may affect
messenger RNA (mRNA) secondary structure by in silico analysis.
METHODS: We studied the 3'UTR polymorphisms in 107 healthy subjects living in
Thailand (ethnicities unknown). The haplotype was analyzed using Haploview
software. mRNA secondary structure and microRNA binding of the G6PD gene were
predicted by use of the CLC Main Workbench 6.9 and RegRNA 2.0 programs.
RESULTS: The results revealed 1 new variant in the 3'UTR of the G6PD gene
(c.*99A > G). Haplotype ATCG showed significance by association-test results that
yielded a high odds ratio (OR, 7.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.15-19.81).
Moreover, this haplotype affected G6PD mRNA secondary structure changes and
microRNA binding via in silico analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the haplotype ATCG is associated with
reduction of G6PD enzyme expression, G6PD mRNA secondary structure changes, and
microRNA binding via in silico analysis.
