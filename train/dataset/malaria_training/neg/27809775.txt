BACKGROUND: Malaria parasites of the genus Plasmodium possess large
hyper-variable families of antigen-encoding genes. These are often
variantly-expressed and are major virulence factors for immune evasion and the
maintenance of chronic infections. Recombination and diversification of these
gene families occurs readily, and may be promoted by G-quadruplex (G4) DNA motifs
within and close to the variant genes. G4s have been shown to cause replication
fork stalling, DNA breakage and recombination in model systems, but these motifs 
remain largely unstudied in Plasmodium.
RESULTS: We examined the nature and distribution of putative G4-forming sequences
in multiple Plasmodium genomes, finding that their co-distribution with variant
gene families is conserved across different Plasmodium species that have
different types of variant gene families. In P. falciparum, where a large set of 
recombination events that occurred over time in cultured parasites has been
mapped, we found a strong spatial association between these recombination events 
and putative G4-forming sequences. Finally, we searched Plasmodium genomes for
the three classes of helicase that can unwind G4s: Plasmodium spp. have no
identifiable homologue of the highly efficient G4 helicase PIF1, but they do
encode two putative RecQ helicases and one homologue of the RAD3-family helicase 
FANCJ.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses, conducted at the whole-genome level in multiple
species of Plasmodium, support the concept that G4s are likely to be involved in 
recombination and diversification of antigen-encoding gene families in this
important protozoan pathogen.
