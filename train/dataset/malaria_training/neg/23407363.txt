BACKGROUND: Because of the lack of an effective and economical control strategy
against malaria (the most devastating infectious disease in developing countries)
Transmission-Blocking Vaccines (TBVs) concept has been raised in recent years,
promising a more efficient way to malaria control. TBVs aim at interfering and/or
blocking pathogen development within the vector, halting transmission to
non-infected vertebrate host. Aminopeptidase N (APN) is one of the most potent
proteins in parasite development in Anopheles malaria vectors, which is strongly 
co-localized with human malaria parasites in the mosquito midgut epithelium.
Therefore, Aminopeptidase N is one of the best choices for a new TBV.
METHODS: In this study for the first time we used 3'-RACE to amplify APN gene in 
Anopheles stephensi (An.stephensi), a major malaria vector in Iran, Indian
subcontinent up to China by using different sets of primers including exon
junction, conserved and specific region primers.
RESULTS: Full length of APN was sequenced stepwise, which could be applied in
designing a new regional TBV and act as an essential component of malaria
elimination program in An.stephensi distribution areas.
CONCLUSION: Primers design and method modification should be set up exactly in
approach based amplifications. From results we came to this conclusion that that 
3'-RACE could be applied to amplified key regions which are beyond reach.
