The peritrophic matrix (PM) is penetrated by Plasmodium ookinete to permit
transition to oocyst in the mosquito midgut, the manner by which the ookinete
interacts with glycoproteins on the PM remains poorly understood. We partially
characterized peritrophic matrix C-type lectin (PMCTL) from An. gambiae (CTL10)
and An. dirus (AdPMCTL). AdPMCTL protein was produced specifically in blood-fed
mosquitoes. The 320 amino acid AdPMCTL exhibits 72% identity with a putative
secreted An. gambiae ortholog (AGAP009316, CTL10). AdPMCTL was cloned and its
expression profile determined in sugar- and blood-fed midguts. RNAi was used to
determine the effect of AdPMCTL on blood meal size and on mosquito survival.
AdPMCTL mRNA was present in midguts of sugar-fed mosquitoes and exhibited
up-regulation following a blood meal, and AdPMCTL silencing significantly
influenced the blood-meal size of engorged mosquitoes, suggesting a role for
AdPMCTL as a stabilizing linker molecule, which limits PM distension after blood 
feeding.
