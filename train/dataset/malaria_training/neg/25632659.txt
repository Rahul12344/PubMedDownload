Molecular detection of Plasmodium in free-ranging birds and captive flamingos
(Phoenicopterus chilensis) in Chicago.

Thurber MI, Gamble KC, Krebs B, Goldberg TL.

Frozen blood samples from 13 species of free-ranging birds (n = 65) and captive
Chilean flamingos (Phoenicopterus chilensis) (n = 46) housed outdoors in the
Chicago area were screened for Plasmodium. With the use of a modified polymerase 
chain reaction, 20/65 (30.8%) of free-ranging birds and 26/46 (56.5%) of
flamingos were classified as positive for this parasite genus. DNA sequencing of 
the parasite cytochrome b gene in positive samples demonstrated that eight
species of free-ranging birds were infected with five different Plasmodium spp.
cytochrome b lineages, and all positive Chilean flamingos were infected with
Plasmodium spp. cytochrome b lineages most closely related to organisms in the
Novyella subgenus. These results show that Chilean flamingos may harbor
subclinical malaria infections more frequently than previously estimated, and
that they may have increased susceptibility to some Plasmodium species.
