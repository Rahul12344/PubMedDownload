PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Modern advances in malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT)
technology have increased demand for low-cost, easy-to-use assays in areas
endemic for malaria. Substantial developments in diagnostic sensitivity and
specificity, improvements in non-falciparum RDTs, and novel biotechnological
innovations are gradually aligning the performance of RDTs with reference-level
diagnostics including PCR and expert microscopy gold standards.
RECENT FINDINGS: Trends have emerged in recent malaria RDT literature: (1)
improvements in the sensitivity and specificity of RDTs for Plasmodium falciparum
diagnosis, making them comparable to expert microscopic examination; (2) reduced 
false-positive and false-negative reactions with novel antibody development; (3) 
improved sensitivity and specificity capabilities of Plasmodium vivax-specific
RDTs; (4) developing RDTs for co-endemic mixed infection differentiation; (5)
significant improvements of RDTs for Plasmodium knowlesi; (6) a global push
towards assessing and confronting the growing concerns of widespread pfhrp2 gene 
deletions; and (7) original innovation in loop-mediated isothermal amplification 
(LAMP) biotechnological RDT-like platforms that demonstrate promising performance
characteristics for P. falciparum, P. vivax, and P. knowlesi infections. The past
5Â years have been characterized by increasing demand for malaria RDTs,
translating into meaningful improvements in performance and novel
biotechnological innovation. Future work should facilitate the development of
improved RDT platforms for Plasmodium ovale, P. knowlesi, and Plasmodium
malariae, and surmount the issue of pfhrp2 gene deletions, while maintaining
comparable performance to both PCR and expert microscopy reference standards.
