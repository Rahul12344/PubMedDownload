Protozoan parasites colonize numerous metazoan hosts and insect vectors through
their life cycles, with the need to respond quickly and reversibly while
encountering diverse and often hostile ecological niches. To succeed, parasites
must also persist within individuals until transmission between hosts is
achieved. Several parasitic protozoa cause a huge burden of disease in humans and
livestock, and here we focus on the parasites that cause malaria and African
trypanosomiasis. Efforts to understand how these pathogens adapt to survive in
varied host environments, cause disease, and transmit between hosts have revealed
a wealth of epigenetic phenomena. Epigenetic switching mechanisms appear to be
ideally suited for the regulation of clonal antigenic variation underlying
successful parasitism. We review the molecular players and complex mechanistic
layers that mediate the epigenetic regulation of virulence gene expression.
Understanding epigenetic processes will aid the development of antiparasitic
therapeutics.
