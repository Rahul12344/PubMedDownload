In certain cases, a species may have access to important genetic variation
present in a related species via adaptive introgression. These novel alleles may 
interact with their new genetic background, resulting in unexpected phenotypes.
In this study, we describe a selective sweep on standing variation on the X
chromosome in the mosquito Anopheles coluzzii, a principal malaria vector in West
Africa. This event may have been influenced by the recent adaptive introgression 
of the insecticide resistance gene known as kdr from the sister species Anopheles
gambiae. Individuals carrying both kdr and a nearly fixed X-linked haplotype,
encompassing at least four genes including the P450 gene CYP9K1 and the cuticular
protein CPR125, have rapidly increased in relative frequency. In parallel, a
reproductively isolated insecticide-susceptible A. gambiae population (Bamako
form) has been driven to local extinction, likely due to strong selection from
increased insecticide-treated bed net usage.
