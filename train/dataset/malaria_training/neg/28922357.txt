The macaque parasite Plasmodium knowlesi is a significant concern in Malaysia
where cases of human infection are increasing. Parasites infecting humans
originate from genetically distinct subpopulations associated with the
long-tailed (Macaca fascicularis (Mf)) or pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina 
(Mn)). We used a new high-quality reference genome to re-evaluate previously
described subpopulations among human and macaque isolates from Malaysian-Borneo
and Peninsular-Malaysia. Nuclear genomes were dimorphic, as expected, but new
evidence of chromosomal-segment exchanges between subpopulations was found. A
large segment on chromosome 8 originating from the Mn subpopulation and
containing genes encoding proteins expressed in mosquito-borne parasite stages,
was found in Mf genotypes. By contrast, non-recombining organelle genomes
partitioned into 3 deeply branched lineages, unlinked with nuclear genomic
dimorphism. Subpopulations which diverged in isolation have re-connected,
possibly due to deforestation and disruption of wild macaque habitats. The
resulting genomic mosaics reveal traits selected by host-vector-parasite
interactions in a setting of ecological transition.
