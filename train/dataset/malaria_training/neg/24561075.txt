The aim of the study was to re-assess the treatment outcomes of Gabonese
children, treated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and artesunate-mefloquine
(AM) and categorized by microscopy as adequate clinical and parasitological
response (ACPR), using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Dried blood spots were
collected at day 0 and day 28 and stevor gene amplification was performed to
detect Plasmodium falciparum infections. Plasmodial DNA was found in 27.5%
(n=19/69) of the isolates collected at day 28; this proportion was 34.3%
(n=12/35) in the SP group and 20.6% (n=7/34) in the AM group. This study
underlines the need of an accurate and more appropriate technique such as PCR to 
evaluate antimalarial drug efficacy during clinical trials.
