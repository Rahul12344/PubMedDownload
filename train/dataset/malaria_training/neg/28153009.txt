BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax is the second most important human malaria parasite,
widely spread across the world. This parasite is associated with important issues
in the process toward malaria elimination, including potential for relapse and
increased resistance to chloroquine. Plasmodium vivax multi-drug resistant
(pvmdr1) is suspected to be a marker of resistance although definitive evidence
is lacking. Progress has been made in knowledge of biological factors affecting
parasite growth, including mechanisms of regulated cell death and the suspected
role of metacaspase. Plasmodium vivax metacaspase1 (PvMCA1-cd) has been described
with a catalytic domain composed of histidine (H372) and cysteine (C428)
residues. The aim of this study was to test for a link between the conserved
histidine and cysteine residues in PvMCA1-cd, and the polymorphism of the P.
vivax multi-drug resistant gene (pvmdr1).
RESULTS: Thirty P. vivax isolates were collected from Mauritania, Sudan, and
Oman. Among the 28 P. vivax isolates successfully sequenced, only 4 samples
showed the conserved His (372)-Cys (428) residues in PvMCA1-cd. Single nucleotide
polymorphisms observed were H372T (46.4%), H372D (39.3%), and C428R (85.7%). A
new polymorphic catalytic domain was observed at His (282)-Cys (305) residues.
Sequences alignment analysis of pvmdr1 showed SNP in the three codons 958, 976
and 1076. A single SNP was identified at the codon M958Y (60%), 2 SNPs were found
at the position 976: Y976F (13%) and Y976V (57%), and 3 SNPs were identified at
the position 1076: F1076L (40%), F1076T (53%) and F1076I (3%). Only one isolate
was wildtype in all three codons (MYF), 27% were single MYL mutants, and 10% were
double MFL mutants. Three new haplotypes were also identified: the triple mutant 
YVT was most prevalent (53.3%) distributed in the three countries, while triple
YFL and YVI mutants (3%), were only found in samples from Sudan and Mauritania.
CONCLUSIONS: Triple or quadruple mutants for metacaspase genes and double or
triple mutants for Pvmdr1 were observed in 24/28 and 19/28 samples. There was no 
difference in the frequency of mutations between PvMCA1-cd and Pvmdr1 (P > 0.2). 
Histidine and cysteine residues in PvMCA1-cd are highly polymorphic and linkage
disequilibrium with SNPs of Pvmdr1 gene may be expected from these three areas
with different patterns of P. vivax transmission.
