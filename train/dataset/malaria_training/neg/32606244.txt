Malaria infection induces complex and diverse immune responses. To elucidate the 
mechanisms underlying host-parasite interaction, we performed a genetic screen
during early (24 h) Plasmodium yoelii infection in mice and identified a large
number of interacting host and parasite genes/loci after transspecies expression 
quantitative trait locus (Ts-eQTL) analysis. We next investigated a host E3
ubiquitin ligase gene (March1) that was clustered with interferon
(IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs) based on the similarity of the genome-wide pattern 
of logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores (GPLS). March1 inhibits
MAVS/STING/TRIF-induced type I IFN (IFN-I) signaling in vitro and in vivo.
However, in malaria-infected hosts, deficiency of March1 reduces IFN-I production
by activating inhibitors such as SOCS1, USP18, and TRIM24 and by altering immune 
cell populations. March1 deficiency increases CD86+DC (dendritic cell)
populations and levels of IFN-γ and interleukin 10 (IL-10) at day 4 post
infection, leading to improved host survival. T cell depletion reduces IFN-γ
level and reverse the protective effects of March1 deficiency, which can also be 
achieved by antibody neutralization of IFN-γ. This study reveals functions of
MARCH1 (membrane-associated ring-CH-type finger 1) in innate immune responses and
provides potential avenues for activating antimalaria immunity and enhancing
vaccine efficacy.
