T-cell receptor transgenic mice are powerful tools to study T cell responses to
malaria parasites. They allow for a population of antigen specific T cells to be 
monitored during developing responses to immunization or parasite infection; this
makes them particularly useful to study fundamental aspects of T cell activation,
differentiation, and migration in different tissue compartments. Moreover, the
use of these cells allows for a thorough analysis of the mechanisms of
antiparasite activity by T cells.
