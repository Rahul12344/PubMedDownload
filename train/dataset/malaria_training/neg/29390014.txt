BACKGROUND: The emergence of resistance against artemisinin combination treatment
is a major concern for malaria control. ACTs are recommended as the rescue
treatment, however, there is limited evidence as to whether treatment and
re-treatment with ACTs select for drug-resistant P. falciparum parasites. Thus,
the purpose of the present study is to investigate the impact of (re-)treatment
using artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) on the
selection of P. falciparum multidrug resistance-1 (Pfmdr1) alleles in clinical
settings.
METHODS: P. falciparum positive samples were collected from children aged 12-59
months in a clinical trial in DR Congo and Uganda. Pfmdr1 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis at codons N86Y, Y184F, and D1246Y were performed at
baseline and post-treatment with either AL or ASAQ as a rescue treatment using
nested PCR followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assays.
RESULTS: The pre-treatment prevalence of Pfmdr1 N86 and D1246Y varied
significantly between the sites, (p>0.001) and (p = 0.013), respectively. There
was borderline significant directional selection for Pfmdr1 184F in recurrent
malaria infections after treatment with AL in Uganda site (p = 0.05). Pfmdr1 NFD 
haplotype did not significantly change in post-treatment infections after
re-treatment with either AL or ASAQ. Comparison between pre-treatment and
post-treatment recurrences did not indicate directional selection of Pfmdr1 N86, 
D1246 alleles in the pre-RCT, RCT and post-RCT phases in both AL and ASAQ
treatment arms. Pfmdr1 86Y was significantly associated with reduced risk of AL
treatment failure (RR = 0.34, 95% CI:0.11-1.05, p = 0.04) while no evidence for
D1246 allele (RR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.42-2.47, p = 1.0). Survival estimates showed
that the Pfmdr1 alleles had comparable mean-time to PCR-corrected recrudescence
and new infections in both AL and ASAQ treatment arms.
CONCLUSION: We found limited impact of (re-)treatment with AL or ASAQ on
selection for Pfmdr1 variants and haplotypes associated with resistance to
partner drugs. These findings further supplement the evidence use of same or
alternative ACTs as a rescue therapy for recurrent P.falciparum infections.
Continued monitoring of genetic signatures of resistance is warranted to timely
inform malaria (re-)treatment policies and guidelines.
