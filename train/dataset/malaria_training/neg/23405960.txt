BACKGROUND: Members of the Anopheles punctulatus group (AP group) are the primary
vectors of human malaria in Papua New Guinea. The AP group includes 13 sibling
species, most of them morphologically indistinguishable. Understanding why only
certain species are able to transmit malaria requires a better comprehension of
their evolutionary history. In particular, understanding relationships and
divergence times among Anopheles species may enable assessing how malaria-related
traits (e.g. blood feeding behaviours, vector competence) have evolved.
METHODS: DNA sequences of 14 mitochondrial (mt) genomes from five AP sibling
species and two species of the Anopheles dirus complex of Southeast Asia were
sequenced. DNA sequences from all concatenated protein coding genes (10,770 bp)
were then analysed using a Bayesian approach to reconstruct phylogenetic
relationships and date the divergence of the AP sibling species.
RESULTS: Phylogenetic reconstruction using the concatenated DNA sequence of all
mitochondrial protein coding genes indicates that the ancestors of the AP group
arrived in Papua New Guinea 25 to 54 million years ago and rapidly diverged to
form the current sibling species.
CONCLUSION: Through evaluation of newly described mt genome sequences, this study
has revealed a divergence among members of the AP group in Papua New Guinea that 
would significantly predate the arrival of humans in this region, 50 thousand
years ago. The divergence observed among the mtDNA sequences studied here may
have resulted from reproductive isolation during historical changes in sea-level 
through glacial minima and maxima. This leads to a hypothesis that the AP sibling
species have evolved independently for potentially thousands of generations. This
suggests that the evolution of many phenotypes, such as insecticide resistance
will arise independently in each of the AP sibling species studied here.
