BACKGROUND: Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) and upstream AUGs (uAUGs) can
regulate the translation of downstream ORFs. The AT rich genome of Plasmodium
falciparum, due to the higher AT content of start and stop codons, has the
potential to give rise to a large number of uORFs and uAUGs that may affect
expression of their flanking ORFs.
METHODS: A bioinformatics approach was used to detect uATGs associated with
different genes in the parasite. To study the effect of some of these uAUGs on
the expression of the downstream ORF, promoters and 5' leaders containing uAUGs
and uORFs were cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. Luciferase assays
were carried out in transient transfection experiments to assess the effects of
uAUGs and mutations on reporter expression.
RESULTS: The average number of uATGs and uORFs seen in P. falciparum coding
sequences (CDS) is expectedly high compared to other less biased genomes. Certain
genes, including the var gene family contain the maximum number of uATGs and
uORFs in the parasite. They possess ~5 times more uORFs and ~4.5 times more uAUGs
within 100 bases upstream of the start codons than other CDS of the parasite. A
60 bp upstream region containing three ORFs and five ATGs from var gene
PF3D7_0400100 and a gene of unknown function (PF3D7_0517100) when cloned upstream
of the luciferase start codon, driven by the hsp86 promoter, resulted in loss of 
luciferase activity. This was restored when all the ATGs present in the -60 bp
were mutated to TTGs. Point mutations in the ATGs showed that even one AUG was
sufficient to repress the luciferase gene.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this work indicates that the P. falciparum genome has a
large number of uATGs and uORFs that can repress the expression of flanking ORFs.
The role of AUGs in translation initiation suggests that this repression is
mediated by preventing the translation initiation complex from reaching the main 
AUG of the downstream ORF. How the P. falciparum ribosome is able to bypass these
uAUGs and uORFs for highly expressed genes remains a question for future
research.
