BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax is one of the five species causing malaria in human 
beings, affecting around 391 million people annually. The development of an
anti-malarial vaccine has been proposed as an alternative for controlling this
disease. However, its development has been hampered by allele-specific responses 
produced by the high genetic diversity shown by some parasite antigens.
Evaluating these antigens' genetic diversity is thus essential when designing a
completely effective vaccine.
METHODS: The gene sequences of Plasmodium vivax p12 (pv12) and p38 (pv38),
obtained from field isolates in Colombia, were used for evaluating haplotype
polymorphism and distribution by population genetics analysis. The evolutionary
forces generating the variation pattern so observed were also determined.
RESULTS: Both pv12 and pv38 were shown to have low genetic diversity. The neutral
model for pv12 could not be discarded, whilst polymorphism in pv38 was maintained
by balanced selection restricted to the gene's 5' region. Both encoded proteins
seemed to have functional/structural constraints due to the presence of s48/45
domains, which were seen to be highly conserved.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to the role that malaria parasite P12 and P38 proteins seem to
play during invasion in Plasmodium species, added to the Pv12 and Pv38 antigenic 
characteristics and the low genetic diversity observed, these proteins might be
good candidates to be evaluated in the design of a multistage/multi-antigen
vaccine.
