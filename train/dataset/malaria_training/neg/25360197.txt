Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common inherited disorders of
haemoglobin in Africa and it is expected that sickle cell trait varies in
frequency in different areas in Sudan. An extensive literature search was carried
out accessing the US National Library of Medicine, the WHO Eastern Mediterranean 
Region resources, the Catalogue for Transmission Genetics in Arabs and papers and
documents published in Sudan that included data on the prevalence of sickle cell 
anaemia and trait. Rates of SCA and trait varied in different areas in Sudan with
the highest rates reported from Western and Eastern Sudan where one in every 123 
children born in Messeryia tribe in Western Sudan is at risk of having SCD. High 
consanguinity rates and malaria endemicity are strong related factors with sickle
cell gene in Sudan. This review will present what is known about the rates of
sickle cell gene in different ethnic groups in Sudan.
