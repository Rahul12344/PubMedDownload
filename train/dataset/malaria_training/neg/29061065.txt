Improving the potency of DNA vaccine encoding HIV-1 Nef antigen using two
endogenous adjuvants in mouse model.

BACKGROUND: DNA immunization can induce long-term immune responses, which are
required to design an effective HIV vaccine. It was shown that antigen-expressing
plasmids can increase the protective immunity against infectious diseases such
as: influenza and malaria. However, DNA-based immunizations have poor
immunogenicity, thus the use of potent immunoadjuvants can enhance their potency.
METHODS: In the current study, preparation of the recombinant HIV-1 Nef, Gp96 and
HMGB1 DNA constructs was performed in bacterial system. Then, the immunogenicity 
of DNA construct harboring HIV-1 Nef gene (pcDNA-Nef) was studied using two
endogenous adjuvants (pcDNA-HMGB1 and pcDNA-Gp96) in BALB/c mouse model.
RESULTS: Our data showed that co-injection of pcDNA-Nef with pcDNA-HMGB1
effectively raised both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in mice as
compared to pcDNA-Nef adjuvanted with pcDNA-gp96. Indeed, co-immunization of
HIV-1 Nef DNA with HMGB1 DNA significantly induced high levels of IgG2a and IFN-Î³
directed toward Th1 responses and also cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) activity in
comparison with other immunized groups.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the full length of HMGB1 gene could be a 
more efficient adjuvant for improvement of therapeutic HIV DNA-based immunization
compared to the full length of gp96 gene (Tab. 1, Fig. 3, Ref. 58).
