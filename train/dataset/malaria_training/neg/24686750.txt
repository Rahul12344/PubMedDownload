The factors implicated in the transition from uncomplicated to severe clinical
malaria such as pulmonary oedema and cerebral malaria remain unclear. It is known
that alterations in vascular integrity due to endothelial cell (EC) activation
and death occur during severe malaria. In this study, we assessed the ability of 
different P. falciparum clinical isolates to induce apoptosis in ECs derived from
human lung and brain. We observed that induction of EC apoptosis was sensitive to
the environmental pH and required direct contact between the parasite and the
cell, though it was not correlated to the ability of the parasite to cytoadhere. 
Moreover, the extent of induced apoptosis in the two EC types varied with the
isolate. Analysis of parasite genes transcript led us to propose that the
activation of different pathways, such as Plasmodium apoptosis-linked
pathogenicity factors (PALPF), PALPF-2, PALPF-5 and PF11_0521, could be implied
in EC death. These observations provide an experimental framework to decipher the
molecular mechanism implicated in the genesis of severe malaria.
