BACKGROUND: CYP2D6 pathway mediates the activation of primaquine into active
metabolite(s) in hepatocytes. CYP2D6 is highly polymorphic, encoding CYP2D6
isoforms with normal, reduced, null or increased activity. It is hypothesized
that Plasmodium vivax malaria patients with defective CYP2D6 function would be at
increased risk for primaquine failure to prevent recurrence. The aim of this
study was to investigate the association of CYP2D6 polymorphisms and inferred
CYP2D6 phenotypes with malaria recurrence in patients from the Western Brazilian 
Amazon, following chloroquine/primaquine combined therapy.
METHODS: The prospective cohort consisted of P. vivax malaria patients who were
followed for 6 months after completion of the chloroquine/primaquine therapy.
Recurrence was defined as one or more malaria episodes, 28-180 days after the
initial episode. Genotyping for nine CYP2D6 SNPs and copy number variation was
performed using TaqMan assays in a Fast 7500 Real-Time System. CYP2D6 star
alleles (haplotypes), diplotypes and CYP2D6 phenotypes were inferred, and the
activity score system was used to define the functionality of the CYP2D6
diplotypes. CYP2D6 activity scores (AS) were dichotomized at ≤ 1 (gPM, gIM and
gNM-S phenotypes) and ≥ 1.5 (gNM-F and gUM phenotypes).
RESULTS: Genotyping was successfully performed in 190 patients (44 with
recurrence and 146 without recurrences). Recurrence incidence was higher in
individuals presenting reduced activity CYP2D6 phenotypes (adjusted relative
risk = 1.89, 95% CI 1.01-3.70; p = 0.049). Attributable risk and population
attributable fraction were 11.5 and 9.9%, respectively. The time elapsed from the
first P. vivax malaria episode until the recurrence did not differ between
patients with AS of ≤ 1 versus ≥ 1.5 (p = 0.917).
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that CYP2D6 polymorphisms are associated with
increased risk of recurrence of vivax malaria, following chloroquine-primaquine
combined therapy. This association is interpreted as the result of reduced
conversion of primaquine into its active metabolites in patients with reduced
CYP2D6 enzymatic activity.
