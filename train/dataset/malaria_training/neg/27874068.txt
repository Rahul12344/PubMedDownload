Plasmodium parasites are responsible for the devastating disease malaria that
affects hundreds of millions of people each year. Blood stage parasites establish
new permeability pathways (NPPs) in infected red blood cell membranes to
facilitate the uptake of nutrients and removal of parasite waste products.
Pharmacological inhibition of the NPPs is expected to lead to nutrient starvation
and accumulation of toxic metabolites resulting in parasite death. Here, we have 
screened a curated library of antimalarial compounds, the MMV Malaria Box,
identifying two compounds that inhibit NPP function. Unexpectedly, metabolic
profiling suggested that both compounds also inhibit dihydroorotate dehydrogense 
(DHODH), which is required for pyrimidine synthesis and is a validated drug
target in its own right. Expression of yeast DHODH, which bypasses the need for
the parasite DHODH, increased parasite resistance to these compounds. These
studies identify two potential candidates for therapeutic development that
simultaneously target two essential pathways in Plasmodium, NPP and DHODH.
