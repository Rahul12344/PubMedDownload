A necropsy was conducted on a female grey-headed parrot (Poicephalus robustus
suahelicus) that died following signs of depression, ruffled feathers, and
inappetence. Microscopic examination revealed the presence of hemoprotozoa in the
liver. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), targeting the mitochondrial
cytochrome b gene of Haemoproteus species, Plasmodium species, and Leucocytozoon 
species, was performed on frozen tissue samples collected at necropsy. The
hemoprotozoa were identified by PCR analysis as Leucocytozoon species.
Hemoprotozoa are rarely reported in African parrots, and this is the first report
of a Leucocytozooon species infection in a Poicephalus robustus suahelicus.
