Understanding how phenotypic differences between males and females arise from the
sex-biased expression of nearly identical genomes can reveal important insights
into the biology and evolution of a species. Among Anopheles mosquito species,
these phenotypic differences include vectorial capacity, as it is only females
that blood feed and thus transmit human malaria. Here, we use RNA-seq data from
multiple tissues of four vector species spanning the Anopheles phylogeny to
explore the genomic and evolutionary properties of sex-biased genes. We find
that, in these mosquitoes, in contrast to what has been found in many other
organisms, female-biased genes are more rapidly evolving in sequence, expression,
and genic turnover than male-biased genes. Our results suggest that this atypical
pattern may be due to the combination of sex-specific life history challenges
encountered by females, such as blood feeding. Furthermore, female propensity to 
mate only once in nature in male swarms likely diminishes sexual selection of
post-reproductive traits related to sperm competition among males. We also
develop a comparative framework to systematically explore tissue- and
sex-specific splicing to document its conservation throughout the genus and
identify a set of candidate genes for future functional analyses of sex-specific 
isoform usage. Finally, our data reveal that the deficit of male-biased genes on 
the X Chromosomes in Anopheles is a conserved feature in this genus and can be
directly attributed to chromosome-wide transcriptional regulation that
de-masculinizes the X in male reproductive tissues.
