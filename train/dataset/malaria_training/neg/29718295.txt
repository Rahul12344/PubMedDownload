The HS3ST3A1/B1 genes encode two homologous 3-O-sulfotransferases involved in the
late modification step during heparan sulfate (HS) biosynthesis. In addition to
the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs28470223 (C > T) in the promoter
region of both HS3ST3A1 and rs62636623 (Gly/Arg) in the stem region of HS3ST3B1, 
three missense mutations (rs62056073, rs61729712 and rs9906590) located within
the catalytic sulfotransferase domain of 3-OST-B1 are linked and associated to
Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia. To ascertain the functional effects of these 
SNP associations, we investigated the regulatory effect of rs28470223 and
characterized the enzymatic activity of the missense SNP rs61729712 (Ser279Asn)
localized at proximity of the substrate binding cleft. The SNP rs28470223 results
in decreased promoter activity of HS3ST3A1 in K562 cells, suggesting a reduced in
vivo transcription activity of the target gene. A comparative kinetic analysis of
wt HS3ST3B1 and the Ser269Asn variant (rs61729712) using a HS-derived
oligosaccharide substrate reveals a slightly higher catalytic activity for the
SNP variant. These genetic and enzymatic studies suggest that genetic variations 
in enzymes responsible of HS 3-O-sulfation can modulate their promoter and
enzymatic activities and may influence P. falciparum parasitaemia.
