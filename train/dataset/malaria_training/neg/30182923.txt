Community prevalence of infection is a widely used, standardized metric for
evaluating malaria endemicity. Conventional methods for measuring prevalence
include light microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), but their detection
thresholds are inadequate for diagnosing low-density infections. The significance
of submicroscopic malaria infections is poorly understood in Madagascar, a
country of heterogeneous malaria epidemiology. A cross-sectional community survey
in the western foothills of Madagascar during the March 2014 transmission season 
found malaria infection to be predominantly submicroscopic and asymptomatic.
Prevalence of Plasmodium infection diagnosed by microscopy, RDT, and molecular
diagnosis was 2.4%, 4.1%, and 13.8%, respectively. This diagnostic discordance
was greatest for Plasmodium vivax infection, which was 98.5% submicroscopic.
Village location, insecticide-treated bednet ownership, and fever were
significantly associated with infection outcomes, as was presence of another
infected individual in the household. Duffy-negative individuals were diagnosed
with P. vivax, but with reduced odds relative to Duffy-positive hosts. The
observation of high proportions of submicroscopic infections calls for a wider
assessment of the parasite reservoir in other regions of the island, particularly
given the country's current focus on malaria elimination and the poorly
documented distribution of the non-P. falciparum parasite species.
