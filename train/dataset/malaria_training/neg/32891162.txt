BACKGROUND: Vector control with Bacillus sphaericus (Bs) is an effective way to
block the transmission of malaria. However, in practical application of Bs
agents, a sublethal dose effect was often caused by insufficient dosing, and it
is little known whether the Bs exposure would affect the surviving mosquitoes'
vector capacity to malaria.
METHODS: A sublethal dose of the Bs 2362 strain was administrated to the early
fourth-instar larvae of Anopheles dirus to simulate shortage use of Bs in field
circumstance. To determine vector competence, mosquitoes were dissected and the
oocysts in the midguts were examined on day 9-11 post-infection with Plasmodium
yoelii. Meanwhile, a SYBR quantitative PCR assay was conducted to examine the
transcriptional level of the key immune molecules of mosquitoes, and RNA
interference was utilized to validate the role of key immune effector molecule
TEP1.
RESULTS: The sublethal dose of Bs treatment significantly reduced susceptibility 
of An. dirus to P. yoelii, with the decrease of P. yoelii infection intensity and
rate. Although there existed a melanization response of adult An. dirus following
challenge with P. yoelii, it was not involved in the decrease of vector
competence as no significant difference of melanization rates and densities
between the control and Bs groups was found. Further studies showed that Bs
treatment significantly increased TEP1 expression in the fourth-instar larvae
(L4), pupae (Pu), 48 h post-infection (hpi) and 72 hpi (P < 0.001). Further,
gene-silencing of TEP1 resulted in disappearance of the Bs impact on vector
competence of An. dirus to P. yoelii. Moreover, the transcriptional level of
PGRP-LC and Rel2 were significantly elevated by Bs treatment with decreased
expression of the negative regulator Caspar at 48 hpi, which implied that the Imd
signaling pathway was upregulated by Bs exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: Bs exposure can reduce the vector competence of An. dirus to malaria
parasites through upregulating Imd signaling pathway and enhancing the expression
of TEP1. The data could not only help us to understand the impact and mechanism
of Bs exposure on Anopheles' vector competence to malaria but also provide us
with novel clues for wiping out malaria using vector control.
