The central role that erythrocyte invasion plays in Plasmodium falciparum
survival and reproduction makes this process an attractive target for therapeutic
or vaccine development. However, multiple invasion-related genes with
complementary and overlapping functions afford the parasite the plasticity to
vary ligands used for invasion, leading to phenotypic variation and immune
evasion. Overcoming the challenge posed by redundant ligands requires a deeper
understanding of conditions that select for variant phenotypes and the molecular 
mediators. While host factors including receptor heterogeneity and acquired
immune responses may drive parasite phenotypic variation, we have previously
shown that host-independent changes in invasion phenotype can be achieved by
continuous culturing of the W2mef and Dd2 P. falciparum strains in moving
suspension as opposed to static conditions. Here, we have used a highly
biologically replicated whole transcriptome sequencing approach to identify the
molecular signatures of variation associated with the phenotype switch. The data 
show increased expression of particular invasion-related genes in switched
parasites, as well as a large number of genes encoding proteins that are either
exported or form part of the export machinery. The genes with most markedly
increased expression included members of the erythrocyte binding antigens (EBA), 
reticulocyte binding homologues (RH), surface associated interspersed proteins
(SURFIN), exported protein family 1 (EPF1) and Plasmodium Helical Interspersed
Sub-Telomeric (PHIST) gene families. The data indicate changes in expression of a
repertoire of genes not previously associated with erythrocyte invasion
phenotypes, suggesting the possibility that moving suspension culture may also
select for other traits.
