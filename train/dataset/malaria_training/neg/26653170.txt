BACKGROUND: Leishmania major and Leishmania infantum are among the main species
that are responsible for cutaneous leishmaniosis (CL) and visceral leishmaniosis 
(VL), respectively. The leishmanioses represent the second-largest parasitic
killer in the world after malaria. Recently, we succeeded in generating a plasmid
DNA (pCMV-HISA70m2A) and demonstrated that immunized mice were protected against 
L. major challenge. The efficacy of the DNA-vaccine was further enhanced by the
inclusion of KMP-11 antigen into the antibiotic-free plasmid pVAX1-asd.
METHODS: Here, we describe the use of a HisAK70 DNA-vaccine encoding seven
Leishmania genes (H2A, H2B, H3, H4, A2, KMP11 and HSP70) for vaccination of mice 
to assess the induction of a resistant phenotype against VL and CL.
RESULTS: HisAK70 was successful in vaccinated mice, resulting in a high amount of
efficient sterile hepatic granulomas associated with a hepatic parasite burden
fully resolved in the VL model; and resulting in 100% inhibition of parasite
visceralization in the CL model.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that immunization with the HisAK70 DNA-vaccine
may provide a rapid, suitable, and efficient vaccination strategy to confer
cross-protective immunity against VL and CL.
