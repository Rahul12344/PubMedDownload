BACKGROUND: Six Plasmodium species are known to naturally infect humans. Mixed
species infections occur regularly but morphological discrimination by microscopy
is difficult and multiplicity of infection (MOI) can only be evaluated by
molecular methods. This study investigated the complexity of Plasmodium
infections in patients treated for microscopically detected non-falciparum or
mixed species malaria in Gabon.
METHODS: Ultra-deep sequencing of nucleus (18S rRNA), mitochondrion, and
apicoplast encoded genes was used to evaluate Plasmodium species diversity and
MOI in 46 symptomatic Gabonese patients with microscopically diagnosed
non-falciparum or mixed species malaria.
RESULTS: Deep sequencing revealed a large complexity of confections in patients
with uncomplicated malaria, both on species and genotype levels. Mixed infections
involved up to four parasite species (Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae,
Plasmodium ovale curtisi, and P. ovale wallikeri). Multiple genotypes from each
species were determined from the asexual 18S rRNA gene. 17 of 46 samples (37%)
harboured multiple genotypes of at least one Plasmodium species. The number of
genotypes per sample (MOI) was highest in P. malariae (n = 4), followed by P.
ovale curtisi (n = 3), P. ovale wallikeri (n = 3), and P. falciparum (n = 2). The
highest combined genotype complexity in samples that contained mixed-species
infections was seven.
CONCLUSIONS: Ultra-deep sequencing showed an unexpected breadth of Plasmodium
species and within species diversity in clinical samples. MOI of P. ovale
curtisi, P. ovale wallikeri and P. malariae infections were higher than
anticipated and contribute significantly to the burden of malaria in Gabon.
