BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is the mainstay of global
efforts for treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, but decline in its
efficacy is the most important obstacle towards malaria control and elimination. 
Therefore, the present molecular analysis provides information on putative
mutations associated with artemisinin resistance in P. falciparum clinical
population unexposed and exposed to artesunate 4 years after adoption of ACT as
the first-line anti-malarial therapy in Iran.
METHODS: In this study, blood samples (n = 226) were collected from uncomplicated
P. falciparum-infected patients from different health centers of Chabahar
district in Sistan and Baluchistan province in the south-eastern part of Iran,
during 2003 to 2010. All collected isolates were analysed for putative candidate 
mutations (TTA) L263E (GAA), (GAA) E431K (AAA), (GCA) A623E (GAA) and (AGT) S769N
(AAT) of pfatpase6 gene using nested PCR/RFLP, followed by sequencing.
Furthermore, the gene copy number was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR
(RT-qPCR) in the presence of SYBR green.
RESULTS: Neither the pfatpase6 L263E nor the A623E mutation was detected among
all examined isolates. The E431K mutation was found in 23% of the analysed
samples unexposed to ACT; however, it was detected in 17.8% (34/191) of P.
falciparum isolates exposed to artesunate after 2007. High frequency of this
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (overall 18.6%) among both examined groups 
(X2 test, P>0.05) indicated that this SNP should be considered as an unrelated
mutation to artemisinin resistance. In contrast, S769N mutation was not detected 
in unexposed isolates; however, it was found in 2.6% (5/191), four years after
introduction of ACT in this malaria setting. Also, detected SNPs were not
significantly frequent in both unexposed and exposed examined isolates (X2 test, 
P> 0.05). Investigation in the copy number of pfatpase6 gene revealed a similar
number of copy (n = 1) as in an isolate sensitive to artemisinin.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, the results suggest, in particular, that pfatpase6
S769N gene needs more consideration for its possible association with artesunate 
resistance among P. falciparum isolates.
