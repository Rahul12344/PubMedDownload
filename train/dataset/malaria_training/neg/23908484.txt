BACKGROUND: Major impediments to development of vaccines and drugs for Plasmodium
vivax malaria are the inability to culture this species and the extreme
difficulty in undertaking clinical research by experimental infection.
METHODS: A parasite bank was collected from a 49-year-old woman with P. vivax
infection, characterized, and used in an experimental infection study.
RESULTS: The donor made a full recovery from malaria after collection of a
parasite bank, which tested negative for agents screened for in blood donations. 
DNA sequence analysis of the isolate indicated that it was clonal. Two subjects
inoculated with the isolate became polymerase chain reaction positive on days 8
and 9, with onset of symptoms and positive blood smears on day 14, when they were
treated with artemether-lumefantrine, with rapid clinical and parasitologic
response. Transcripts of the parasite gene pvs25 that is expressed in
gametocytes, the life cycle stage infectious to mosquitoes, were first detected
on days 11 and 12.
CONCLUSIONS: This experimental system results in in vivo parasite growth,
probably infectious to mosquitoes. It offers the opportunity to undertake studies
previously impossible in P. vivax that will facilitate a better understanding of 
the pathology of vivax malaria and development of antimalarial drugs and
vaccines. Trial Registration. ANZCTR: 12612001096842.
