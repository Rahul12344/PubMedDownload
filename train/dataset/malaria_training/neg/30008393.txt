An expatriate to Ivory Coast (supposedly allergic to artemether-lumefantrine) was
diagnosed with severe malaria in Spain. Parasitemia increased from 2% up to 21%
within 24 h under quinine (10 mg/kg) and clindamycin (450 mg/8 h) combination
treatment. Molecular profiling of the patient revealed the presence of molecular 
markers of quinine and other antimalarials resistance. Additionally, multiple
copies of pfpm2 gene were also noticed in the patient sample, despite the absence
of piperaquine drug pressure in Ivory Coast. Parasitemia was cleared with
artesunate (2.4 mg/kg) under a desensitization protocol. Nevertheless, detection 
of early treatment failure is needed mainly in cases of suspected antimalarial
resistance.
