OBJECTIVE: To explore the possible association between polymorphisms in CD1 genes
and both asymptomatic and mild Plasmodium falciparum infection.
METHODS: Two clusters of 85 school children, from the village of Dienga (Gabon)
were investigated. The first group was analysed for the prevalence and the
multiplicity of asymptomatic P. falciparum infection, whereas the second group
was screened for the frequency of malarial attacks.
RESULTS: Our findings showed that homozygosity for the CD1E*02 allele was
associated with a low frequency of malarial attacks. Furthermore, a strong
association between CD1E*02 homozygotes and the resistance to multiple malarial
attacks was identified. The CD1A*01 allele showed a weak association with a small
number of malarial attacks.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest a possible role of CD1E polymorphisms in malaria 
protection among school children and that CD1e molecules are involved in
anti-malarial immunity.
