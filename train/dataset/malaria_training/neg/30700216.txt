BACKGROUND: Cellular metabolism generates reactive oxygen species. The oxidation 
and deamination of the deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pool results in the
formation of non-canonical, toxic dNTPs that can cause mutations, genome
instability, and cell death. House-cleaning or sanitation enzymes that break down
and detoxify non-canonical nucleotides play major protective roles in nucleotide 
metabolism and constitute key drug targets for cancer and various pathogens. We
hypothesized that owing to their protective roles in nucleotide metabolism, these
house-cleaning enzymes are key drug targets in the malaria parasite.
METHODS: Using the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei we evaluate here,
by gene targeting, a group of conserved proteins with a putative function in the 
detoxification of non-canonical nucleotides as potential antimalarial drug
targets: they are inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPase), deoxyuridine
triphosphate pyrophosphatase (dUTPase) and two NuDiX hydroxylases, the
diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A) hydrolase and the nucleoside triphosphate
hydrolase (NDH).
RESULTS: While all four proteins are expressed constitutively across the
intraerythrocytic developmental cycle, neither ITPase nor NDH are required for
parasite viability. dutpase and ap4ah null mutants, on the other hand, are not
viable suggesting an essential function for these proteins for the malaria
parasite.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasmodium dUTPase and Ap4A could be drug targets in the malaria
parasite.
