The aim of this translational study was to show the use of molecular surveillance
for polymorphisms and copy number as a monitoring tool to track the emergence and
dynamics of Plasmodium falciparum drug resistance. A molecular baseline for
Suriname was established in 2005, with P. falciparum chloroquine resistance
transporter (pfcrt) and P. falciparum multidrug resistance (pfmdr1) markers and
copy number in 40 samples. The baseline results revealed the existence of a
uniformly distributed mutated genotype corresponding with the fully
mefloquine-sensitive 7G8-like genotype (Y184F, S1034C, N1042D, and D1246Y) and a 
fixed pfmdr1 N86 haplotype. All samples harbored the pivotal pfcrtK76T mutation, 
showing that chloroquine reintroduction should not yet be contemplated in
Suriname. After 5 years, 40 samples were assessed to trace temporal changes in
the status of pfmdr1 polymorphisms and copy number and showed minor genetic
alterations in the pfmdr1 gene and no significant changes in copy number, thus
providing scientific support for prolongation of the current drug policy in
Suriname.
