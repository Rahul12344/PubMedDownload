Plasmodium vivax malaria is much less common in Africa than the rest of the world
because the parasite relies primarily on the Duffy antigen/chemokine receptor
(DARC) to invade human erythrocytes, and the majority of Africans are Duffy
negative. Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in the reporting of P.
vivax cases in Africa, with a high number of them being in Duffy negative
individuals, potentially indicating P. vivax has evolved an alternative invasion 
mechanism that can overcome Duffy negativity. Here, we analyzed single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) and copy number variation (CNV) in Whole Genome Sequence (WGS)
data from 44 P. vivax samples isolated from symptomatic malaria patients in
southwestern Ethiopia, where both Duffy positive and Duffy negative individuals
are found. A total of 123,711 SNPs were detected, of which 22.7% were
nonsynonymous and 77.3% were synonymous mutations. The largest number of SNPs
were detected on chromosomes 9 (24,007 SNPs; 19.4% of total) and 10 (16,852 SNPs,
13.6% of total). There were particularly high levels of polymorphism in
erythrocyte binding gene candidates including merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) 
and merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP3.5, MSP3.85 and MSP3.9). Two genes, MAEBL
and MSP3.8 related to immunogenicity and erythrocyte binding function were
detected with significant signals of positive selection. Variation in gene copy
number was also concentrated in genes involved in host-parasite interactions,
including the expansion of the Duffy binding protein gene (PvDBP) on chromosome 6
and MSP3.11 on chromosome 10. Based on the phylogeny constructed from the whole
genome sequences, the expansion of these genes was an independent process among
the P. vivax lineages in Ethiopia. We further inferred transmission patterns of
P. vivax infections among study sites and showed various levels of gene flow at a
small geographical scale. The genomic features of P. vivax provided baseline data
for future comparison with those in Duffy-negative individuals and allowed us to 
develop a panel of informative Single Nucleotide Polymorphic markers diagnostic
at a micro-geographical scale.
