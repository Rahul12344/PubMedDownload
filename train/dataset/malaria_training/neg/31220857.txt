Due to the unique selective pressures and extreme changes faced by the human
malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum throughout its life cycle, the parasite
has evolved distinct features to alter its gene expression patterns. Along with
classical gene regulation by transcription factors (TFs), of which only one
family, the AP2 TFs, has been described in the parasite genome, a large body of
evidence points toward chromatin structure and epigenetic factors mediating the
changes in gene expression associated with parasite life cycle stages. These
attributes may be critically important for immune evasion, host cell invasion and
development of the parasite in its two hosts, the human and the Anopheles vector.
Thus, the factors involved in the maintenance and regulation of chromatin and
epigenetic features represent potential targets for antimalarial drugs. In this
review, we discuss the mechanisms in P. falciparum that regulate chromatin
structure, nucleosome landscape, the 3-dimensional structure of the genome and
additional distinctive features created by parasite-specific genes and gene
families. We review conserved traits of chromatin in eukaryotes in order to
highlight what is unique in the parasite.
