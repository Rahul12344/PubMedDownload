We investigated the efficacy and types of immune responses from plasmid malaria
DNA vaccine encoding VR1020-PyMSP119 condensed on the surface of
polyethyleneimine (PEI)-coated SPIONs. In vivo mouse studies were done firstly to
determine the optimum magnetic vector composition, and then to observe immune
responses elicited when magnetic vectors were introduced via different
administration routes. Higher serum antibody titers against PyMSP119 were
observed with intraperitoneal and intramuscular injections than subcutaneous and 
intradermal injections. Robust IgG2a and IgG1 responses were observed for
intraperitoneal administration, which could be due to the physiology of
peritoneum as a major reservoir of macrophages and dendritic cells. Heterologous 
DNA prime followed by single protein boost vaccination regime also enhanced
IgG2a, IgG1, and IgG2b responses, indicating the induction of appropriate memory 
immunity that can be elicited by protein on recall. These outcomes support the
possibility to design superparamagnetic nanoparticle-based DNA vaccines to
optimally evoke desired antibody responses, useful for a variety of diseases
including malaria.
