Placental malaria (PM) is a major cause of fetal growth restriction, yet the
underlying mechanism is unclear. Complement C5a and C5a receptor levels are
increased with PM. C5a is implicated in fetal growth restriction in
non-infection-based animal models. In a case-control study of 492 pregnant
Malawian women, we find that elevated C5a levels are associated with an increased
risk of delivering a small-for-gestational-age infant. C5a was significantly
increased in PM and was negatively correlated with the angiogenic factor
angiopoietin-1 and positively correlated with angiopoietin-2, soluble endoglin,
and vascular endothelial growth factor. Genetic or pharmacological blockade of
C5a or its receptor in a mouse model of PM resulted in greater fetoplacental
vessel development, reduced placental vascular resistance, and improved fetal
growth and survival. These data suggest that C5a drives fetal growth restriction 
in PM through dysregulation of angiogenic factors essential for placental
vascular remodeling resulting in placental vascular insufficiency.
