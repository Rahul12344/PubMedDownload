Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease of humans and other animals. It is
caused by the parasitic protozoan, Plasmodium. Sporozoites, the infectious form
of malaria parasites, are quiescent when they remain in the salivary glands of
the Anopheles mosquito until transmission into a mammalian host. Metamorphosis of
the dormant sporozoite to its active form in the liver stage requires
transcriptional and translational regulations. Here, we summarize recent advances
in the translational repression of gene expression in the malaria sporozoite. In 
sporozoites, many mRNAs that are required for liver stage development are
translationally repressed. Phosphorylation of eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2α
(eIF2α) leads to a global translational repression in sporozoites. The eIF2α
kinase, known as Upregulated in Infectious Sporozoite 1 (UIS1), is dominant in
the sporozoite. The eIF2α phosphatase, UIS2, is translationally repressed by the 
Pumilio protein Puf2. This translational repression is alleviated when
sporozoites are delivered into the mammalian host.
