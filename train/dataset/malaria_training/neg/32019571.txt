BACKGROUND: Resistance to anti-malarial drugs hinders malaria elimination.
Monitoring the molecular markers of drug resistance helps improve malaria
treatment policies. This study aimed to assess the distribution of molecular
markers of imported Plasmodium falciparum infections.
METHODS: In total, 485 P. falciparum cases imported from Africa, Southeast Asia, 
and Oceania into Zhejiang province, China, from 2016 to 2018 were investigated.
Most were imported from Africa, and only a few cases originated in Asia and
Oceania. Blood samples were collected from each patient. Plasmodium falciparum
chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt) at residues 72-76 and
Kelch13-propeller (k13) were determined by nested PCR and DNA sequence.
RESULTS: Wild-type Pfcrt at residues 72-76 was predominant (72.61%), but mutant
and mixed alleles were also detected, of which CVIET (22.72%) was the most
common. Mutant Pfcrt haplotypes were more frequent in patients from West Africa
(26.92%), North Africa (25%), and Central Africa (21.93%). The number of cases of
P. falciparum infections was small in Southeast Asia and Oceania, and these cases
involved Pfcrt mutant type. For the k13 propeller gene, 26 samples presented 19
different point mutations, including eight nonsynonymous mutations (P441S, D464E,
K503E, R561H, A578S, R622I, V650F, N694K). In addition, R561H, one of the
validated SNPs in k13, was detected in one patient from Myanmar and one patient
from Rwanda. A578S, although common in Africa, was found in only one patient from
Cameroon. R622I was detected in one sample from Mozambique and one sample from
Somalia. The genetic diversity of k13 was low in most regions of Africa and
purifying selection was suggested by Tajima's D test.
CONCLUSIONS: The frequency and spatial distributions of Pfcrt and k13 mutations
associated with drug resistance were determined. Wild-type Pfcrt was dominant in 
Africa. Among k13 mutations correlated with delayed parasite clearance, only the 
R561H mutation was found in one case from Rwanda in Africa. Both Pfcrt and k13
mutations were detected in patients from Southeast Asia and Oceania. These
findings provide insights into the molecular epidemiological profile of drug
resistance markers in the study region.
