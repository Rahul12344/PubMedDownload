Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or quantitative PCR (qPCR), is a
rapid, sensitive, and specific method used for a broad variety of applications
including quantitative gene expression analysis, DNA copy number measurement,
characterization of gene and chromosomal deletions, and genotyping. Real-time
reverse transcription (RT)-PCR has largely supplanted Northern blot and RNase
protection assays, as two examples, as a means of quantifying transcript levels. 
The method utilizes small amounts of RNA and allows efficient screening of a
large number of samples. Here, we describe the materials and methods required to 
perform real-time RT-PCR, including RNA purification, cDNA synthesis, and
real-time PCR analysis of cDNA samples.
