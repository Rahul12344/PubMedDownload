Most mosquito species display host preferences that are a crucial determinant of 
the transmission rate of mosquito-borne pathogens. Although a transgenic
approach, based on driving genes for zoophily into vector populations, has been
advocated as a malaria control strategy by the World Health Organization since
1982, the genes involved in mosquito host choice remain poorly understood. Culex 
pipiens pallens Coquillet mosquitoes were artificially selected for two different
host preferences in a specially designed experimental enclosure. Of 3,035
mosquitoes obtained from larvae and pupae collected from the wild (the F0
generation), 27% preferentially fed on pigeons and 16% fed on mice. Following
artificial selection for these host preferences over successive generations, the 
percentage of mosquitoes that preferred to feed on pigeons or mice gradually
increased, eventually stabilizing at ∼55 and 34%, respectively, after the sixth
generation. Intergenerational differences in host preferences were significant
(P < 0.001). Furthermore, differences in host preferences between mosquitoes
selected to prefer pigeons and those selected to prefer mice were both
significant and consistent over almost six generations.
