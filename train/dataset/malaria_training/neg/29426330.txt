BACKGROUND: Malaria caused by Plasmodium ovale spp. has been neglected by and
large from research and has received only little scientific attention during the 
past decades. Ovale malaria is considered to feature relapses by liver
hypnozoites although scientific evidence for this paradigm is scarce.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here, the case of a 16-year-old male, who presented with
fevers to the outpatient department in Vienna, Austria, after travelling to
Uganda and Papua New Guinea is described. Infection with Plasmodium malariae was 
diagnosed by microscopy and the patient was treated accordingly with a full
course of supervised artemether-lumefantrine. He was discharged in good clinical 
condition with a negative blood smear. One month after initial diagnosis, he
returned complaining of fever. Thick blood smear was positive again for malaria
parasites, which were confirmed as P. ovale wallikeri by PCR. Retrospective
analysis revealed the identical Plasmodium spp. in the initial blood samples.
Molecular analysis of various gene loci (nuclear porbp2, 18S rRNA and potra
genes) gave identical results providing further evidence for relapse by an
identical parasite genotype. Consecutively, the patient was retreated with
artemether-lumefantrine and received a regimen of primaquine according to WHO
guidelines.
CONCLUSION: Conclusive evidence for relapses with P. ovale spp. is rare. The
presented case provides convincing confirmation for the relapse paradigm based on
re-appearing parasitaemia following supervised treatment in a non-endemic region 
with a parasite strain of identical genotype.
