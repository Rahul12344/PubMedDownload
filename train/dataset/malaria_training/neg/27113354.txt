BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a public health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa with 
Plasmodium falciparum being the principal cause of malaria disease morbidity and 
mortality. Plasmodium falciparum virulence is attributed, in part, to its
population-level genetic diversity-a characteristic that has yet to be studied in
Rwanda. Characterizing P. falciparum molecular epidemiology in an area is needed 
for a better understand of malaria transmission and to inform choice of malaria
control strategies.
METHODS: In this health-facility based survey, malaria case clinical profiles and
parasite densities as well as parasite genetic diversity were compared among P.
falciparum-infected patients identified at two sites of different malaria
transmission intensities in Rwanda. Data on demographics and clinical features
and finger-prick blood samples for microscopy and parasite genotyping were
collected(.) Nested PCR was used to genotype msp-2 alleles of FC27 and 3D7.
RESULTS: Patients' variables of age group, sex, fever (both by patient report and
by measured tympanic temperatures), parasite density, and bed net use were found 
differentially distributed between the higher endemic (Ruhuha) and lower endemic 
(Mubuga) sites. Overall multiplicity of P. falciparum infection (MOI) was 1.73
but with mean MOI found to vary significantly between 2.13 at Ruhuha and 1.29 at 
Mubuga (p < 0.0001). At Ruhuha, expected heterozygosity (EH) for FC27 and 3D7
alleles were 0.62 and 0.49, respectively, whilst at Mubuga, EH for FC27 and 3D7
were 0.26 and 0.28, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a higher geometrical mean parasite counts, more
polyclonal infections, higher MOI, and higher allelic frequency were observed at 
the higher malaria-endemic (Ruhuha) compared to the lower malaria-endemic
(Mubuga) area. These differences in malaria risk and MOI should be considered
when choosing setting-specific malaria control strategies, assessing p.
falciparum associated parameters such as drug resistance, immunity and impact of 
used interventions, and in proper interpretation of malaria vaccine studies.
