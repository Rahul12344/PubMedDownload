Cerebral malaria (CM) is a serious neurological complication caused by Plasmodium
falciparum infection. Currently, the only treatment for CM is the provision of
antimalarial drugs; however, such treatment by itself often fails to prevent
death or development of neurological sequelae. To identify potential improved
treatments for CM, we performed a nonbiased whole-brain transcriptomic
time-course analysis of antimalarial drug chemotherapy of murine experimental CM 
(ECM). Bioinformatics analyses revealed IL33 as a critical regulator of
neuroinflammation and cerebral pathology that is down-regulated in the brain
during fatal ECM and in the acute period following treatment of ECM. Consistent
with this, administration of IL33 alongside antimalarial drugs significantly
improved the treatment success of established ECM. Mechanistically, IL33
treatment reduced inflammasome activation and IL1β production in microglia and
intracerebral monocytes in the acute recovery period following treatment of ECM. 
Moreover, treatment with the NLRP3-inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 alongside
antimalarial drugs phenocopied the protective effect of IL33 therapy in improving
the recovery from established ECM. We further showed that IL1β release from
macrophages was stimulated by hemozoin and antimalarial drugs and that this was
inhibited by MCC950. Our results therefore demonstrate that manipulation of the
IL33-NLRP3 axis may be an effective therapy to suppress neuroinflammation and
improve the efficacy of antimalarial drug treatment of CM.
