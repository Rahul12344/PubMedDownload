BACKGROUND: Zanzibar has recently undergone a rapid decline in Plasmodium
falciparum transmission following combined malaria control interventions with
artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) and integrated vector control.
Artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) was implemented as first-line treatment for
uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Zanzibar in 2003. Resistance to
amodiaquine has been associated with the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
alleles pfcrt 76T, pfmdr1 86Y, 184Y and 1246Y. An accumulation of these SNP
alleles in the parasite population over time might threaten ASAQ efficacy.The aim
of this study was to assess whether prolonged use of ASAQ as first-line
anti-malarial treatment selects for P. falciparum SNPs associated with resistance
to the ACT partner drug amodiaquine.
METHODS: The individual as well as the combined SNP allele prevalence were
compared in pre-treatment blood samples from patients with uncomplicated P.
falciparum malaria enrolled in clinical trials conducted just prior to the
introduction of ASAQ in 2002-2003 (n = 208) and seven years after wide scale use 
of ASAQ in 2010 (n = 122).
RESULTS: There was a statistically significant decrease of pfcrt 76T (96-63%),
pfmdr1 86Y (75-52%), 184Y (83-72%), 1246Y (28-16%) and the most common haplotypes
pfcrt/pfmdr1 TYYD (46-26%) and TYYY (17-8%), while an increase of pfcrt/pfmdr1
KNFD (0.4-14%) and KNYD (1-12%).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first observation of a decreased prevalence of pfcrt
76T, pfmdr1 86Y, 184Y and 1246Y in an African setting after several years of
extensive ASAQ use as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. This may
support sustained efficacy of ASAQ on Zanzibar, although it was unexpected
considering that all these SNPs have previously been associated with amodiaquine 
resistance. The underlying factors of these results are unclear. Genetic dilution
by imported P. falciparum parasites from mainland Tanzania, a de-selection by
artesunate per se and/or an associated fitness cost might represent contributing 
factors. More detailed studies on temporal trends of molecular markers associated
with amodiaquine resistance are required to improve the understanding of this
observation.
