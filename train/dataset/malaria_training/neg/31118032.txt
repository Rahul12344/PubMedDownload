BACKGROUND: Malaria, one of the world's greatest public health challenges, is an 
endemic disease with stable transmission in Togo. Combating malaria requires an
effective vector control. This study provides temporal data on insecticide
resistance status in the major malaria vector Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.)
from Togo.
METHODS: Two to 5 days old females of An. gambiae s.l., originating from three
localities (Baguida, Kovié, Kolokopé) were subjected to insecticide-impregnated
papers during 3 years (2012, 2013, 2016) as follows: organochlorides (4% DDT),
pyrethroids (0.05% deltamethrin, 0.75% permethrin, 0.05% lambdacyhalothrin),
carbamates (0.4% bendiocarb and 0.1% propoxur), and organophosphates (5%
malathion, 0.4% chlorpyrifos methyl, 1% fenitrothion) following the WHO standard 
protocol. Dead and surviving mosquitoes were stored separately in Eppendorf tubes
containing silica gel for DNA extraction, species identification, and kdr and
ace-1 genotyping.
RESULTS: Knockdown times (KDT50 and KDT95) were high in An. gambiae s.l. The
lowest KDTs were recorded at Baguida in 2013 for deltamethrin (KDT50 = 24.7, CI
[22.4-27.12] and KDT95 = 90.78, CI [76.35-113.49]). No KDTs were recorded for DDT
and in some instances for permethrin. In general, An. gambiae s.l. was resistant 
to most of the four classes of insecticides during the survey periods regardless 
of locality and year, except to chlorpyrifos methyl. In some instances,
mosquitoes were fully susceptible to fenitrothion (Kolokopé: 100% and Kovié:
98.05%, CI [95.82-100.26]) and malathion (100% at both Kolokopé and Kovié) in
2013, and malathion only (Kolokopé; 100%) in 2016. Anopheles coluzzii, An.
gambiae and Anopheles arabiensis were the three sibling species identified at the
three localities with some hybrids at Baguida (2013), and Kovié (2012 and 2016), 
respectively. Anopheles gambiae was relatively dominant (61.6%). The kdr 1014F
allele frequency was > 0.9 in most of the cases, except at Kolokopé (f
(1014F) = 0.63, CI [0.55-0.71]) in 2013. The kdr 1014S allele frequency was below
0.02. The highest ace-1 frequencies were identified in An. gambiae at Baguida
(2012: 0.52, CI [0.34-0.69] and 2013: 0.66, CI [0.46-0.86]).
CONCLUSION: The resistance status is worrying in Togo and should be considered in
future malaria vector resistance management programmes by decision-makers.
