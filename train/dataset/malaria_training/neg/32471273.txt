Malaria control relies on first-line treatments that use artemisinin-combination 
therapies (ACT). Unfortunately, mutations in the plasmodium falciparum kelch13
gene result in delayed parasite clearance. Research on what is causing ACT
failure is non-existent in northwestern Nigeria. Thus, the presence of mutations 
in kelch13 in P. falciparum isolates from Kano, Nigeria was investigated in this 
study. Microscopic examination of 154 blood samples obtained from patients
revealed a high prevalence of P. falciparum infection (114 positive individuals, 
slide positivity rate = 74.03%). The 114 patients were administered CartefÂ® (ACT)
and out of the 50 patients that returned for the 14-day follow up, 11 were
positive for P. falciparum (slide positivity rate = 22%). On day 0, 80 samples
out of 114 and 11 samples on day 14 (91 out of 125 microscopy-positive samples)
were positive with Plasmodium according to the PCR of cytochrome oxidase I, which
corresponds to 72.8%. A fragment of the kelch13 gene encompassing the propeller
domains was sequenced in 49 samples, alongside samples of the susceptible strain 
pf_3D7. Low polymorphism was observed, suggesting a lack of selection on this
gene, and only six mutations (Glu433Gly, Phe434Ile, Phe434Ser, Ile684Asn,
Ile684Thr and Glu688Lys) were found. The epidemiologic impact of these mutations 
and their potential role in ACT resistance needs to be investigated further.
