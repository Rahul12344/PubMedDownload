Avian blood parasites have been preliminarily studied in East Asia, but no data
are available from long-term monitoring. The aim of this study was to evaluate
the prevalence, genetic diversity, and temporal dynamics of Plasmodium,
Haemoproteus, and Leucocytozoon in two passerine communities (one forest and one 
urban) in north China from 2008 to 2013, as well as the association between
infected lineages and host specificities. Out of 633 birds from 40 species, 157
individuals (24.8 %) were infected; overall prevalence was 26.7 % and 16.8 % in
two sites, respectively. The dominant avian blood parasite genus in the forest
park changed yearly between Plasmodium and Haemoproteus, while the Leucocytozoon 
maintained a low infection level. Forty-four haplotypes were identified by
sequencing a 432-bp fragment of the cytochrome b (cyt b) gene; more than 70 %
were novel (six Plasmodium lineages, 16 Haemoproteus lineages, and nine
Leucocytozoon lineages). Based on our data gathered over consecutive years, we
found that the highly observed lineages of Haemoproteus showed higher host
diversities than those of Plasmodium, and the most infected lineage EMEL01 (100 %
identity with SGS1) take on the highest host diversity but low temporal diversity
of the two genera, implying that this lineage infected a great diversity of
species in certain years, but maintained a lower infection level or even
disappeared in other years. The results suggest that genetic diversity of avian
blood parasites in East Asia is high and provides scope for further research. In 
addition, compared with overall analysis, yearly prevalence monitoring is
important in uncovering the temporal dynamic and host specificity variations over
time.
