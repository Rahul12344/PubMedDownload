PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) target transcripts by sequence complementarity
serving as guides for RNA slicing in animal germ cells. The piRNA pathway is
increasingly recognized as critical for essential cellular functions such as
germline development and reproduction. In the Anopheles gambiae ovary, as much as
11% of piRNAs map to protein-coding genes. Here, we show that ovarian mRNAs and
long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are processed into piRNAs that can direct other
transcripts into the piRNA biogenesis pathway. Targeting piRNAs fuel transcripts 
either into the ping-pong cycle of piRNA amplification or into the machinery of
phased piRNA biogenesis, thereby creating networks of inter-regulating
transcripts. RNAs of the same network share related genomic repeats. These
repeats give rise to piRNAs, which target other transcripts and lead to a cascade
of concerted RNA slicing. While ping-pong networks are based on repeats of
several hundred nucleotides, networks that rely on phased piRNA biogenesis
operate through short ~40-nucleotides long repeats, which we named snetDNAs.
Interestingly, snetDNAs are recurring in evolution from insects to mammals. Our
study brings to light a new type of conserved regulatory pathway, the
snetDNA-pathway, by which short sequences can include independent genes and
lncRNAs in the same biological pathway.
