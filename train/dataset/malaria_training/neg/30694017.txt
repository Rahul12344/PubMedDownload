The natural product pepticinnamin E potently inhibits protein farnesyl
transferases and has potential applications in treating cancer and malaria.
Pepticinnamin E contains a rare N-terminal cinnamoyl moiety as well as several
nonproteinogenic amino acids, including the unusual
2-chloro-3-hydroxy-4-methoxy-N-methyl-L-phenylalanine. The biosynthesis of
pepticinnamin E has remained uncharacterized because its original producing
strain is no longer available. Here we identified a gene cluster (pcm) for this
natural product in a new producer, Actinobacteria bacterium OK006, by means of a 
targeted rediscovery strategy. We demonstrated that the pcm cluster is
responsible for the biosynthesis of pepticinnamin E, a nonribosomal
peptide/polyketide hybrid. We also characterized a key O-methyltransferase that
modifies 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine. Our work has identified the gene cluster 
for pepticinnamins for the first time and sets the stage for elucidating the
unique chemistry required for biosynthesis.
