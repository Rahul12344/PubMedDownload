Severe malarial anemia [SMA, hemoglobin (Hb) <5.0 g/dL] is a leading cause of
global morbidity and mortality among children residing in Plasmodium falciparum
transmission regions. Exploration of molecular pathways through global gene
expression profiling revealed that SMA was characterized by decreased HSPA1A, a
heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 coding gene. Hsp70 is a ubiquitous chaperone that
regulates Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling and production of
pro-inflammatory cytokines known to be important in malaria pathogenesis (e.g.,
IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α). Since the role of host Hsp70 in malaria pathogenesis is
unexplored, we investigated Hsp70 and molecular pathways in children with SMA.
Validation experiments revealed that leukocytic HSP70 transcripts were reduced in
SMA relative to non-severe malaria, and that intraleukocytic hemozoin (PfHz) was 
associated with lower HSP70. HSP70 was correlated with reticulocyte production
and Hb. Since glutamine (Gln) up-regulates Hsp70, modulates NF-κB activation, and
attenuates over-expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, circulating Gln was
measured in children with malaria. Reduced Gln was associated with increased risk
of developing SMA. Treatment of cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) with PfHz caused a time-dependent decrease in Hsp70 transcripts/protein, 
and NF-κB activation. Gln treatment of PBMCs overcame PfHz-induced suppression of
HSP70 transcripts/protein, reduced NF-κB activation, and suppressed
over-expression of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. Findings here demonstrate that SMA is
characterized by reduced intraleukocytic HSP70 and circulating Gln, and that
PfHz-induced suppression of HSP70 can be reversed by Gln. Thus, Gln
supplementation may offer important immunotherapeutic options for futures studies
in children with SMA.
