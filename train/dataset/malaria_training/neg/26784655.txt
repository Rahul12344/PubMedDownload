The monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene is an important candidate gene for human
behavior that encodes an enzyme regulating the metabolism of key
neurotransmitters. The regulatory mechanisms of the MAOA gene in dogs are yet to 
be elucidated. We measured MAOA gene transcription and analyzed the VNTR genotype
and methylation status of the gene promoter region in different dog breeds to
determine whether MAOA expression is correlated with the MAOA genotype or
epigenetic modification in dogs. We found brain-specific expression of the MAOA
gene and different transcription levels in different dog breeds including Beagle,
Sapsaree, and German shepherd, and also a robust association of the DNA
methylation of the gene promoter with mRNA levels. However, the 90 bp tandem
repeats that we observed near the transcription start site were not variable,
indicating no correlation with canine MAOA activity. These results show that
differential DNA methylation in the MAOA promoter region may affect gene
expression by modulating promoter activity. Moreover, the distinctive patterns of
MAOA expression and DNA methylation may be involved in breed-specific or
individual behavioral characteristics, such as aggression, because behavioral
phenotypes are related to different physiological and neuroendocrine responses.
