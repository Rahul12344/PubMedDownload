BACKGROUND: Malaria is a vector-borne parasitic disease which is prevalent in
many developing countries. Recently, it has been found that Plasmodium knowlesi, 
a simian malaria parasite can be life-threatening to humans. Long-tailed
macaques, which are widely distributed in Malaysia, are the natural hosts for
simian malaria, including P. knowlesi. The aim of the present study was to
determine the prevalence of simian malaria parasites in long-tailed macaques in
the district of Hulu Selangor, Selangor, Malaysia.
METHODS: A total of 70 blood samples were collected from Macaca fascicularis
dwelling in the forest of Hulu Selangor by the Department of Wildlife and
National Parks Peninsular Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. DNA was extracted
using PureLinkâ„¢ Genomic DNA Kits. Conventional and nested PCR were used to detect
the genus and species of Plasmodium parasites respectively. In addition,
phylogenetic analysis was carried out to confirm the species of Plasmodium
parasites.
RESULTS: Thirty-five (50 %) of the 70 samples were positive for Plasmodium using 
genus-specific primers. These positive samples were then subjected to nested PCR 
targeting the 18S ribosomal RNA genes to detect all five simian malaria
parasites: namely, P. knowlesi, Plasmodium inui, Plasmodium cynomolgi, Plasmodium
fieldi, and Plasmodium coatneyi. All five species of simian malaria parasites
were detected. Of these, P. inui was the predominant (65.7 %), followed by P.
knowlesi (60 %), P. cynomolgi (51.4 %) P. coatneyi (45.7 %) and P. fieldi (2.9
%). A total of nine macaques had mono-infection with P. knowlesi (four), P.
cynomolgi (two), P. coatneyi (two) and P. fieldi (one). Eleven of the macaques
had dual infections while 12 had triple infections. Three macaques were infected 
with four species of Plasmodium. Molecular and phylogenetic analysis confirmed
the five species of Plasmodium parasites.
CONCLUSION: This study has provided evidence to elucidate the presence of
transmission of malaria parasites among the local macaques in Hulu Selangor.
Since malaria is a zoonosis, it is important to determine the new control
strategies for the control of malaria.
