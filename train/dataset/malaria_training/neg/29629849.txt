The prospect of using genetic methods to target vector, parasite, and reservoir
species offers tremendous potential benefits to public health, but the use of
genome editing to alter the shared environment will require special attention to 
public perception and community governance in order to benefit the world. Public 
skepticism combined with the media scrutiny of gene drive systems could easily
derail unpopular projects entirely, especially given the potential for trade
barriers to be raised against countries that employ self-propagating gene drives.
Hence, open and community-guided development of thoughtfully chosen applications 
is not only the most ethical approach, but also the most likely to overcome the
economic, social, and diplomatic barriers. Here we review current and past
attempts to alter ecosystems using biological methods, identify key determinants 
of social acceptance, and chart a stepwise path for developers towards safe and
widely supported use.
