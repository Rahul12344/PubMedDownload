Many pathogens (virus, bacteria, fungi, or parasites) have developed a wide
variety of mechanisms to evade their host immune system. The budding yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae has successfully been used to decipher some of these
immune evasion strategies. This includes the cis-acting mechanism that limits the
expression of the oncogenic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded EBNA1 and thus of
antigenic peptides derived from this essential but highly antigenic viral
protein. Studies based on budding yeast have also revealed the molecular bases of
epigenetic switching or recombination underlying the silencing of all except one 
members of extended families of genes that encode closely related and highly
antigenic surface proteins. This mechanism is exploited by several parasites
(that include pathogens such as Plasmodium, Trypanosoma, Candida, or
Pneumocystis) to alternate their surface antigens, thereby evading the immune
system. Yeast can itself be a pathogen, and pathogenic fungi such as Candida
albicans, which is phylogenetically very close to S. cerevisiae, have developed
stealthiness strategies that include changes in their cell wall composition, or
epitope-masking, to control production or exposure of highly antigenic but
essential polysaccharides in their cell wall. Finally, due to the high
antigenicity of its cell wall, yeast has been opportunistically exploited to
create adjuvants and vectors for vaccination.
