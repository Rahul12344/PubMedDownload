BACKGROUND: Haemoglobin S (HbS) is the gene known to confer the strongest
advantage against malaria morbidity and mortality. Multiple HbS effects have been
described resulting in protection against parasitaemia and reduction of severe
malaria risk. This study aimed to explore HbS protection against severe malaria
and Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia in Angolan children exhibiting different
severe malaria syndromes.
METHODS: A case-control study was designed with 430 malaria cases (n = 288 severe
malaria and n = 142 uncomplicated malaria) and 319 uninfected controls, attending
a central paediatric hospital in Luanda. Severe malaria syndromes were cerebral
malaria (n = 130), severe malaria anaemia (n = 30) and hyperparasitaemia (n =
128). Quantitative trait locus analysis was carried out to study HbS association 
to parasite densities.
RESULTS: Previously reported HbS protection against severe malaria was confirmed 
in case-control analysis (P = 2 × 10(-13)) and corroborated by transmission
disequilibrium test (P = 4 × 10(-3)). High parasite density protection conferred 
by HbS was detectable within severe malaria patients (P = 0.04). Stratifying
severe malaria patients according parasite densities, it was found that HbS was
highly associated to hyperparasitaemia protection (P = 1.9 × 10(-9)) but did not 
protect non-hyperparasitaemic children against severe malaria complications,
namely cerebral malaria and severe malaria anaemia. Many studies have shown that 
HbS protects from severe malaria and controls parasite densities but the analysis
further suggests that HbS protection against severe malaria syndromes was at a
large extent correlated with control of parasitaemia levels.
CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the hypothesis that HbS confers resistance to
hyperparasitaemia in patients exhibiting severe malaria syndromes and highlights 
that parasitaemia should be taken into account when evaluating HbS protection in 
severe malaria.
