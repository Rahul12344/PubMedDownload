BACKGROUND: All symptoms of malaria are caused by the intraerythrocytic
proliferation of Plasmodium merozoites. Merozoites invade erythrocytes using
multiple binding ligands that recognise specific surface receptors. It has been
suggested that adaptation of Plasmodium parasites to infect specific hosts is
driven by changes in genes encoding Plasmodium erythrocyte-binding ligands (EBL) 
and reticulocyte-binding ligands (RBL). Homologs of both EBL and RBL, including
the EBA-140 merozoite ligand, have been identified in P. falciparum and P.
reichenowi, which infect humans and chimpanzees, respectively. The P. falciparum 
EBA-140 was shown to bind human glycophorin C, a minor erythrocyte
sialoglycoprotein. Until now, the erythrocyte receptor for the P. reichenowi
EBA-140 remained unknown.
METHODS: The baculovirus expression vector system was used to obtain the
recombinant EBA-140 Region II, and flow cytometry and immunoblotting methods were
applied to characterise its specificity.
RESULTS: We showed that the chimpanzee glycophorin D is the receptor for the P.
reichenowi EBA-140 ligand on chimpanzee red blood cells.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the development of glycophorin C specificity is
spurred by the P. falciparum lineage. We speculate that the P. falciparum EBA-140
evolved to hijack GPC on human erythrocytes during divergence from its ape
ancestor.
