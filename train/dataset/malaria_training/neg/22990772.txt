Genetic manipulation of Plasmodium falciparum remains very challenging, mainly
due to the parasite genome's high A/T-richness and low transfection efficiency.
This chapter includes methods for generating transient and stable transfections
by electroporation, allelic replacement with tagged genes, gene deletion, and the
analysis of all the above.
