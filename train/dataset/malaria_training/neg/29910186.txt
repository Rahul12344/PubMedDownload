Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii are obligate intracellular parasites 
that belong to the phylum of Apicomplexa and cause major human diseases. Their
access to an intracellular lifestyle is reliant on the coordinated release of
proteins from the specialized apical organelles called micronemes and rhoptries. 
A specific phosphatidic acid effector, the acylated pleckstrin homology
domain-containing protein (APH) plays a central role in microneme exocytosis and 
thus is essential for motility, cell entry, and egress. TgAPH is acylated on the 
surface of the micronemes and recruited to phosphatidic acid (PA)-enriched
membranes. Here, we dissect the atomic details of APH PA-sensing hub and its
functional interaction with phospholipid membranes. We unravel the key
determinant of PA recognition for the first time and show that APH inserts into
and clusters multiple phosphate head-groups at the bilayer binding surface.
