Copy number variation can contribute to the variation observed in susceptibility 
to complex diseases. Here we present the first study to investigate copy number
variation of the chemokine gene CCL3L1 with susceptibility to malaria. We present
a family-based genetic analysis of a Tanzanian population (n=922), using parasite
load, mean number of clinical infections of malaria and haemoglobin levels as
phenotypes. Copy number of CCL3L1 was measured using the paralogue ratio test
(PRT) and the dataset exhibited copy numbers ranging between 1 and 10 copies per 
diploid genome (pdg). Association between copy number and phenotypes was
assessed. Furthermore, we were able to identify copy number haplotypes in some
families, using microsatellites within the copy variable region, for transmission
disequilibrium testing. We identified a high level of copy number haplotype
diversity and find some evidence for an association of low CCL3L1 copy number
with protection from anaemia.
