BACKGROUND: Individual drug treatment may select resistant parasites in the human
body, a process termed in vivo selection. Some single nucleotide polymorphisms in
Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine-resistance transporter (pfcrt) and multidrug
resistance gene 1 (pfmdr1) genes have been reportedly selected after
artemether-lumefantrine treatment. However, there is a paucity of data regarding 
in vivo selection of P. falciparum Kelch propeller domain (pfkelch13)
polymorphisms, responsible for artemisinin-resistance in Asia, and six putative
background mutations for artemisinin resistance; D193Y in ferredoxin, T484I in
multiple resistance protein 2, V127M in apicoplast ribosomal protein S10, I356T
in pfcrt, V1157L in protein phosphatase and C1484F in phosphoinositide-binding
protein.
METHODS: Artemether-lumefantrine efficacy study with a follow-up period of
28 days was conducted in northern Uganda in 2014. The above-mentioned genotypes
were comparatively analysed before drug administration and on days; 3, 7, and
28 days after treatment.
RESULTS: In 61 individuals with successful follow-up, artemether-lumefantrine
treatment regimen was very effective with PCR adjusted efficacy of 95.2%. Among
146 isolates obtained before treatment, wild-type alleles were observed in 98.6% 
of isolates in pfkelch13 and in all isolates in the six putative background genes
except I356T in pfcrt, which had 2.4% of isolates as mixed infections. In vivo
selection study revealed that all isolates detected in the follow-up period
harboured wild type alleles in pfkelch13 and the six background genes.
CONCLUSION: Mutations in pfkelch13 and the six background genes may not play an
important role in the in vivo selection after artemether-lumefantrine treatment
in Uganda. Different mechanisms might rather be associated with the existence of 
parasites after treatment.
