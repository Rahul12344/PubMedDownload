BACKGROUND: Anopheles sinensis is a major vector of malaria in China and its
control is under great threat as the development of insecticide resistance.
Voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) is the target of several classes of
insecticides. Genetic mutations of VGSC have been documented to confer knockdown 
resistance (kdr) to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and pyrethroids in
mosquitoes. To control this vector efficiently, it is important to know the
resistance-associated genetic mutations, their distribution frequencies and
genealogical relations.
METHODS: Three hundreds and thirteen (313) adults of An. sinensis collected from 
nine locations across Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region were used. The partial
sequence of the An. sinensis voltage gated sodium channel gene (AS-VGSC)
containing codon 1014 was sequenced. PHASE2.1 was used to construct the
haplotypes of each individual, and the accuracy of haplotypes was further
confirmed by clone sequencing. The genealogical relations of kdr mutations in
AS-VGSC was analysed using TCS 2.1 and Network 5.0.
RESULTS: Sixteen AS-VGSC haplotypes including seven haplotypes carrying
non-synonymous mutations at codon 1014, and fifty-five AS-VGSC genotypes were
identified from 313 mosquitoes collected from nine geographical locations across 
Guangxi. The number of haplotypes in each of the nine populations ranged from 5
to 13. The frequency of haplotypes carrying kdr mutations ranged from 2.7 to
80.0Â % within the nine populations, of which 1014C was unexpectedly high in the
northeast of Guangxi. Genealogical analysis suggested multiple origins of kdr
mutations in An. sinensis.
CONCLUSION: Diverse haplotypes of AS-VGSC are distributed in Guangxi. The
presence of haplotypes carrying mutations at codon 1014 indicates a risk of
pyrethroid and DDT resistance. The kdr mutations show differential distribution
geographically, with high frequencies occurred in the northeast of Guangxi.
Genealogical analysis suggests multiple origins of kdr mutations in An. sinensis 
populations in Guangxi. These findings have important practical implications for 
the sustainability of An. sinensis control programmes.
