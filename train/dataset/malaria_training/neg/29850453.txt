Background: The key gene sets involved in the progression of acute liver failure 
(ALF), which has a high mortality rate, remain unclear. This study aims to gain a
deeper understanding of the transcriptional response of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) following ALF.
Methods: ALF was induced by D-galactosamine (D-gal) in a porcine model. PBMCs
were separated at time zero (baseline group), 36 h (failure group), and 60 h
(dying group) after D-gal injection. Transcriptional profiling was performed
using RNA sequencing and analysed using DAVID bioinformatics resources.
Results: Compared with the baseline group, 816 and 1,845 differentially expressed
genes (DEGs) were identified in the failure and dying groups, respectively. A
total of five and two gene ontology (GO) term clusters were enriched in 107 GO
terms in the failure group and 154 GO terms in the dying group. These GO clusters
were primarily immune-related, including genes regulating the inflammasome
complex and toll-like receptor signalling pathways. Specifically, GO terms
related to cell death, including apoptosis, pyroptosis, and autophagy, and those 
related to fibrosis, coagulation dysfunction, and hepatic encephalopathy were
enriched. Seven Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways,
cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, hematopoietic cell lineage, lysosome,
rheumatoid arthritis, malaria, and phagosome and pertussis pathways were mapped
for DEGs in the failure group. All of these seven KEGG pathways were involved in 
the 19 KEGG pathways mapped in the dying group.
Conclusion: We found that the dramatic PBMC transcriptome changes triggered by
ALF progression was predominantly related to immune responses. The enriched GO
terms related to cell death, fibrosis, and so on, as indicated by PBMC
transcriptome analysis, seem to be useful in elucidating potential key gene sets 
in the progression of ALF. A better understanding of these gene sets might be of 
preventive or therapeutic interest.
