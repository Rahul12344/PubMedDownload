Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest species of malaria parasites, is dependent
on glycolysis for the generation of ATP during the pathogenic red blood cell
stage. Hexokinase (HK) catalyzes the first step in glycolysis, transferring the
γ-phosphoryl group of ATP to glucose to yield glucose-6-phosphate. Here, we
describe the validation of a high-throughput assay for screening small-molecule
collections to identify inhibitors of the P. falciparum HK (PfHK). The assay,
which employed an ADP-Glo reporter system in a 1,536-well-plate format, was
robust with a signal-to-background ratio of 3.4 ± 1.2, a coefficient of variation
of 6.8% ± 2.9%, and a Z'-factor of 0.75 ± 0.08. Using this assay, we screened
57,654 molecules from multiple small-molecule collections. Confirmed hits were
resolved into four clusters on the basis of structural relatedness. Multiple
singleton hits were also identified. The most potent inhibitors had 50%
inhibitory concentrations as low as ∼1 μM, and several were found to have
low-micromolar 50% effective concentrations against asexual
intraerythrocytic-stage P. falciparum parasites. These molecules additionally
demonstrated limited toxicity against a panel of mammalian cells. The
identification of PfHK inhibitors with antiparasitic activity using this
validated screening assay is encouraging, as it justifies additional HTS
campaigns with more structurally amenable libraries for the identification of
potential leads for future therapeutic development.
