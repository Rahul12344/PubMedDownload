Children in malaria endemic areas acquire immunity to severe malaria faster than 
to mild malaria. Only a minority of children suffers from severe malaria and it
is not known what determines this. The aim of this study was to establish how P. 
falciparum infections during the first years of life affect the risk of severe
malaria. A matched case-control study was nested within a large birth cohort set 
up to study the immunoepidemiology of pneumococci on the Kenyan coast. Infection 
patterns in three-monthly blood samples in cohort children admitted to hospital
with severe malaria were compared to controls matched on age, residential
location and time of sampling. P. falciparum detected at least once from birth
conferred an increased risk of severe malaria and particularly if multiclonal
infections, as characterized by genotyping of a polymorphic antigen gene, were
ever detected. The results show for the first time that children with severe
malaria have more infections early in life compared to community controls. These 
findings provide important insights on the immunity to severe disease, knowledge 
essential for the development of a vaccine against severe malaria.
