Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance constitutes a major obstacle to the
global malaria elimination campaign. Specific mutations in the Plasmodium
falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT) mediate resistance to the
4-aminoquinoline drug chloroquine and impact parasite susceptibility to several
partner agents used in current artemisinin-based combination therapies, including
amodiaquine. By examining gene-edited parasites, we report that the ability of
the wide-spread Dd2 PfCRT isoform to mediate chloroquine and amodiaquine
resistance is substantially reduced by the addition of the PfCRT L272F mutation, 
which arose under blasticidin selection. We also provide evidence that L272F
confers a significant fitness cost to asexual blood stage parasites. Studies with
amino acid-restricted media identify this mutant as a methionine auxotroph.
Metabolomic analysis also reveals an accumulation of short, hemoglobin-derived
peptides in the Dd2 + L272F and Dd2 isoforms, compared with parasites expressing 
wild-type PfCRT. Physiologic studies with the ionophores monensin and nigericin
support an impact of PfCRT isoforms on Ca2+ release, with substantially reduced
Ca2+ levels observed in Dd2 + L272F parasites. Our data reveal a central role for
PfCRT in regulating hemoglobin catabolism, amino acid availability, and ionic
balance in P. falciparum, in addition to its role in determining parasite
susceptibility to heme-binding 4-aminoquinoline drugs.
