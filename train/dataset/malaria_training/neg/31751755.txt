BACKGROUND: Sensitive diagnostic techniques are needed for timely detection of
malaria parasite and disease control. Molecular diagnostic techniques involving
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with 18 s rRNA as a known diagnostic target with 
an overall sensitivity of 10 parasites per microliter is used as a gold standard.
Till date, no attempt has been undertaken to develop a technique for the
identification of four Plasmodium species in a single step PCR combined with
restriction digestion with enzymes.
METHOD: Plasmodium species-specific polymerase chain reaction-restriction
fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assays have been developed, based on RFLP
of amplified PCR product of mitochondrial gene as a target. This approach
identifies Plasmodium species in two steps involving amplification of
mitochondrial (Mt) gene by PCR followed by digestion with restriction enzymes.
RESULT: A total of 36 clinical samples were subjected to PCR-RFLP for the
diagnosis and detection of malaria parasites targeting mitochondrial gene (Mt).
The findings of the method were compared with gold standard methods (Microscopy, 
RDTs and Nested PCR) and was able to detect mixed infection with a sensitivity of
100% and specificity of 93.8% with respect to nested PCR. The results obtained by
PCR-RFLP were validated with Sanger sequencing (n = 32) and were found to be
consistent with the method.
CONCLUSION: This method identifies and distinguishes four species of human
malaria parasite namely P. falciparum (Pf), P. vivax (Pv), P. malariae (Pm) and
P. ovale (Po) in approximately 4 h. To overcome and address PCR difficulties,
continuous efforts are needed for the development of newer diagnostic techniques.
