Previous whole genome comparisons of Plasmodium falciparum populations have not
included collections from the Indian subcontinent, even though two million
Indians contract malaria and about 50,000 die from the disease every year.
Stratification of global parasites has revealed spatial relatedness of parasite
genotypes on different continents. Here, genomic analysis was further improved to
obtain country-level resolution by removing var genes and intergenic regions from
distance calculations. P. falciparum genomes from India were found to be most
closely related to each other. Their nearest neighbors were from Bangladesh and
Myanmar, followed by Thailand. Samples from the rest of Southeast Asia, Africa
and South America were increasingly more distant, demonstrating a high-resolution
genomic-geographic continuum. Such genome stratification approaches will help
monitor variations of malaria parasites within South Asia and future changes in
parasite populations that may arise from in-country and cross-border migrations.
