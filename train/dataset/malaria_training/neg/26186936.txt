BACKGROUND: Control efforts towards malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum
significantly decreased the incidence of the disease in many endemic countries
including Senegal. Surprisingly, in Kedougou (southeastern Senegal) P. falciparum
malaria remains highly prevalent and the relative contribution of other
Plasmodium species to the global malaria burden is very poorly documented, partly
due to the low sensitivity of routine diagnostic tools. Molecular methods offer
better estimate of circulating Plasmodium species in a given area. A molecular
survey was carried out to document circulating malaria parasites in Kedougou
region.
METHODS: A total of 263 long-term stored sera obtained from patients presenting
with acute febrile illness in Kedougou between July 2009 and July 2013 were used 
for malaria parasite determination. Sera were withdrawn from a collection
established as part of a surveillance programme of arboviruses infections in the 
region. Plasmodium species were characterized by a nested PCR-based approach
targeting the 18S small sub-unit ribosomal RNA genes of Plasmodium spp.
RESULTS: Of the 263 sera screened in this study, Plasmodium genomic DNA was
amplifiable by nested PCR from 62.35% (164/263) of samples. P. falciparum
accounted for the majority of infections either as single in 85.97% (141/164) of 
Plasmodium-positive samples or mixed with Plasmodium ovale (11.58%, 19/164) or
Plasmodium vivax (1.21%, 2/164). All 19 (11.58%) P. ovale-infected patients were 
mixed with P. falciparum, while no Plasmodium malariae was detected in this
survey. Four patients (2.43%) were found to be infected by P. vivax, two of whom 
were mixed with P. falciparum. P. vivax infections originated from Bandafassi and
Ninefesha villages and concerned patients aged 4, 9, 10, and 15 years old,
respectively. DNA sequences alignment and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that
sequences from Kedougou corresponded to P. vivax, therefore confirming the
presence of P. vivax infections in Senegal.
CONCLUSION: The results confirm the high prevalence of P. falciparum in Kedougou 
and provide the first molecular evidence of P. vivax infections in Senegal. These
findings pave the ways for further investigations of P. vivax infections in
Senegal and its contribution to the global burden of malaria disease before
targeted strategies can be deployed.
