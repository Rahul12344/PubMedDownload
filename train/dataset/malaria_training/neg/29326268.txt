Chemogenetic characterization through in vitro evolution combined with
whole-genome analysis can identify antimalarial drug targets and drug-resistance 
genes. We performed a genome analysis of 262 Plasmodium falciparum parasites
resistant to 37 diverse compounds. We found 159 gene amplifications and 148
nonsynonymous changes in 83 genes associated with drug-resistance acquisition,
where gene amplifications contributed to one-third of resistance acquisition
events. Beyond confirming previously identified multidrug-resistance mechanisms, 
we discovered hitherto unrecognized drug target-inhibitor pairs, including
thymidylate synthase and a benzoquinazolinone, farnesyltransferase and a
pyrimidinedione, and a dipeptidylpeptidase and an arylurea. This exploration of
the P. falciparum resistome and druggable genome will likely guide drug discovery
and structural biology efforts, while also advancing our understanding of
resistance mechanisms available to the malaria parasite.
