Mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum cyclic amine resistance locus (PfCARL) are
associated with parasite resistance to the imidazolopiperazines, a potent class
of novel antimalarial compounds that display both prophylactic and
transmission-blocking activity, in addition to activity against blood-stage
parasites. Here, we show that pfcarl encodes a protein, with a predicted
molecular weight of 153 kDa, that localizes to the cis-Golgi apparatus of the
parasite in both asexual and sexual blood stages. Utilizing clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-mediated gene introduction of 5
variants (L830V, S1076N/I, V1103L, and I1139K), we demonstrate that mutations in 
pfcarl are sufficient to generate resistance against the imidazolopiperazines in 
both asexual and sexual blood-stage parasites. We further determined that the
mutant PfCARL protein confers resistance to several structurally unrelated
compounds. These data suggest that PfCARL modulates the levels of small-molecule 
inhibitors that affect Golgi-related processes, such as protein sorting or
membrane trafficking, and is therefore an important mechanism of resistance in
malaria parasites.IMPORTANCE: Several previous in vitro evolution studies have
implicated the Plasmodium falciparum cyclic amine resistance locus (PfCARL) as a 
potential target of imidazolopiperazines, potent antimalarial compounds with
broad activity against different parasite life cycle stages. Given that the
imidazolopiperazines are currently being tested in clinical trials, understanding
their mechanism of resistance and the cellular processes involved will allow more
effective clinical usage.
