The predisposition of parasites acquiring artemisinin resistance still remains
unclear beyond the mutations in Pfk13 gene and modulation of the unfolded protein
response pathway. To explore the chain of casualty underlying artemisinin
resistance, we reanalyze 773 P. falciparum isolates from TRACI-study integrating 
TWAS, GWAS, and eQTL analyses. We find the majority of P. falciparum parasites
are transcriptomically converged within each geographic site with two broader
physiological profiles across the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). We report 8720 
SNP-expression linkages in the eastern GMS parasites and 4537 in the western. The
minimal overlap between them suggests differential gene regulatory networks
facilitating parasite adaptations to their unique host environments. Finally, we 
identify two genetic and physiological backgrounds associating with artemisinin
resistance in the GMS, together with a farnesyltransferase protein and a
thioredoxin-like protein which may act as vital intermediators linking the Pfk13 
C580Y mutation to the prolonged parasite clearance time.
