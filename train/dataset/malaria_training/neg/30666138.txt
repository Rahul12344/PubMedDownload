Vector-borne infectious diseases continue to be a major threat to public health. 
Although some prevention and treatment modalities exist for these diseases,
resistance to such modalities, exacerbated by global climate change, remains a
fundamental challenge. Developments in genomic engineering technologies present a
new front in battling vector-borne illnesses; however, there is a lack of
consensus over the scope and consequences of these approaches. In this article,
we use malaria as a case study to address the developments and controversies
surrounding gene drives, a novel genomic engineering technology. We draw
attention to the themes of infection control, resistance, and reversibility using
a science and technology studies framework. Unlike other current prevention and
treatment modalities, gene drives have the capacity to alter not only single
organisms but also entire species and ecologies. Therefore, broader public and
scientific engagement is needed to inform a more inclusive discussion between
clinicians, researchers, policy makers, and society.
