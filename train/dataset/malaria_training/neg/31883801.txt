Malaria vaccine candidate RTS,S/AS01 is based on the central and C-terminal
regions of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) of P. falciparum. mAb397 was
isolated from a volunteer in an RTS,S/AS01 clinical trial, and it protects mice
from infection by malaria sporozoites. However, mAb397 originates from the less
commonly used VH3-15 germline gene compared to the VH3-30/33 antibodies generally
elicited by RTS,S to the central NANP repeat region of CSP. The crystal structure
of mAb397 with an NPNA4 peptide shows that the central NPNA forms a type I β-turn
and is the main recognition motif. In most anti-NANP antibodies studied to date, 
a germline-encoded Trp is used to engage the Pro in NPNA β-turns, but here the
Trp interacts with the first Asn. This "conserved" Trp, however, can arise from
different germline genes and be located in the heavy or the light chain.
Variation in the terminal ψ angles of the NPNA β-turns results in different
dispositions of the subsequent NPNA and, hence, different stoichiometries and
modes of antibody binding to rsCSP. Diverse protective antibodies against NANP
repeats are therefore not limited to a single germline gene response or mode of
binding.
