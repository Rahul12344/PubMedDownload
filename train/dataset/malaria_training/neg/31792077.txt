We used a genome-wide screen in N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-mutagenized mice to
identify genes in which recessive loss-of-function mutations protect against
pathological neuroinflammation. We identified an R367Q mutation in the ZBTB7B
(ThPOK) protein in which homozygosity causes protection against experimental
cerebral malaria (ECM) caused by infection with Plasmodium berghei ANKA.
Zbtb7bR367Q homozygous mice show a defect in the lymphoid compartment expressed
as severe reduction in the number of single-positive CD4 T cells in the thymus
and in the periphery, reduced brain infiltration of proinflammatory leukocytes in
P. berghei ANKA-infected mice, and reduced production of proinflammatory
cytokines by primary T cells ex vivo and in vivo Dampening of proinflammatory
immune responses in Zbtb7bR367Q mice is concomitant to increased susceptibility
to infection with avirulent (Mycobacterium bovis BCG) and virulent (Mycobacterium
tuberculosis H37Rv) mycobacteria. The R367Q mutation maps to the first
DNA-binding zinc finger domain of ThPOK and causes loss of base contact by R367
in the major groove of the DNA, which is predicted to impair DNA binding. Global 
immunoprecipitation of ThPOK-containing chromatin complexes coupled to DNA
sequencing (ChIP-seq) identified transcriptional networks and candidate genes
likely to play key roles in CD4+ CD8+ T cell development and in the expression of
lineage-specific functions of these cells. This study highlights ThPOK as a
global regulator of immune function in which alterations may affect normal
responses to infectious and inflammatory stimuli.
