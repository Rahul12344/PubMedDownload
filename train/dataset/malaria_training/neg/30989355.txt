The microbiota in mosquito breeding waters can affect ovipositing mosquitoes,
have effects on larval development, and can modify adult mosquito-gut bacterial
composition. This, in turn, can affect transmission of human pathogens such as
malaria parasites. Here, we explore the microbiota of four breeding sites for
Anopheles darlingi, the most important malaria vector in Latin America. The sites
are located in Manaus in the Amazon basin in Brazil, an area of active malaria
transmission. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing by MiSeq, we found that all sites
were dominated by Proteobacteria and Firmicutes and that 94% of the total number 
of reads belonged to 36 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) identified in all
sites. Of these, the most common OTUs belonged to Escherichia/Shigella,
Staphylococcus, and Pseudomonas. Of the remaining 6% of the reads, the OTUs found
to differentiate between the four sites belonged to the orders Burkholderiales,
Actinomycetales, and Clostridiales. We conclude that An. darlingi can develop in 
breeding waters with different surface-water bacteria, but that the common
microbiota found in all breeding sites might indicate or contribute to a suitable
habitat for this important malaria vector.
