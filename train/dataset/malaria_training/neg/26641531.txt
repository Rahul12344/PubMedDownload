Gene drive systems that enable super-Mendelian inheritance of a transgene have
the potential to modify insect populations over a timeframe of a few years. We
describe CRISPR-Cas9 endonuclease constructs that function as gene drive systems 
in Anopheles gambiae, the main vector for malaria. We identified three genes
(AGAP005958, AGAP011377 and AGAP007280) that confer a recessive female-sterility 
phenotype upon disruption, and inserted into each locus CRISPR-Cas9 gene drive
constructs designed to target and edit each gene. For each targeted locus we
observed a strong gene drive at the molecular level, with transmission rates to
progeny of 91.4 to 99.6%. Population modeling and cage experiments indicate that 
a CRISPR-Cas9 construct targeting one of these loci, AGAP007280, meets the
minimum requirement for a gene drive targeting female reproduction in an insect
population. These findings could expedite the development of gene drives to
suppress mosquito populations to levels that do not support malaria transmission.
