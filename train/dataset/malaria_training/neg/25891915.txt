Uncovering the transmission dynamics of Plasmodium vivax using population
genetics.

Barry AE, Waltmann A, Koepfli C, Barnadas C, Mueller I.

Population genetic analysis of malaria parasites has the power to reveal key
insights into malaria epidemiology and transmission dynamics with the potential
to deliver tools to support control and elimination efforts. Analyses of parasite
genetic diversity have suggested that Plasmodium vivax populations are more
genetically diverse and less structured than those of Plasmodium falciparum
indicating that P. vivax may be a more ancient parasite of humans and/or less
susceptible to population bottlenecks, as well as more efficient at disseminating
its genes. These population genetic insights into P. vivax transmission dynamics 
provide an explanation for its relative resilience to control efforts. Here, we
describe current knowledge on P. vivax population genetic structure, its
relevance to understanding transmission patterns and relapse and how this
information can inform malaria control and elimination programmes.
