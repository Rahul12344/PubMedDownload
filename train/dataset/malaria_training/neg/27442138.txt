Apicoplasts are vestigial plastids in apicomplexan parasites like Plasmodium, the
causative agent of malaria. Apicomplexan parasites are dependant on their
apicoplasts for synthesis of various molecules that they are unable to scavenge
in sufficient quantity from their host, which makes apicoplasts attractive drug
targets. Proteins known as plastid phosphate translocators (pPTs) are embedded in
the outer apicoplast membrane and are responsible for the import of carbon,
energy and reducing power to drive anabolic synthesis in the organelle. We
investigated how a pPT is targeted into the outer apicoplast membrane of the
human malaria parasite P. falciparum. We showed that a transmembrane domain is
likely to act as a recessed signal anchor to direct the protein into the
endomembrane system, and that a tyrosine in the cytosolic N-terminus of the
protein is essential for targeting, but one or more, as yet unidentified, factors
are also essential to direct the protein into the outer apicoplast membrane.
