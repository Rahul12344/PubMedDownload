The dinoflagellates are an important group of eukaryotic, single celled algae.
They are the sister group of the Apicomplexa, a group of intracellular parasites 
and photosynthetic algae including the malaria parasite Plasmodium. Many
apicomplexan mitochondria have a number of unusual features, including the lack
of a pyruvate dehydrogenase and the existence of a branched TCA cycle. Here, we
analyse dinoflagellate EST (expressed sequence tag) data to determine whether
these features are apicomplexan-specific, or if they are more widespread. We show
that dinoflagellates have replaced a key subunit (E1) of pyruvate dehydrogenase
with a subunit of bacterial origin and that transcripts encoding many of the
proteins that are essential in a conventional ATP synthase/Complex V are absent, 
as is the case in Apicomplexa. There is a pathway for synthesis of starch or
glycogen as a storage carbohydrate. Transcripts encoding isocitrate lyase and
malate synthase are present, consistent with ultrastructural reports of a
glyoxysome. Finally, evidence for a conventional haem biosynthesis pathway is
found, in contrast to the Apicomplexa, Chromera and early branching
dinoflagellates (Perkinsus, Oxyrrhis).
