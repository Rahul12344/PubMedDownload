Although generally curable with intensive chemotherapy in resource-rich settings,
Burkitt lymphoma (BL) remains a deadly disease in older patients and in
sub-Saharan Africa. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positivity is a feature in more than
90% of cases in malaria-endemic regions, and up to 30% elsewhere. However, the
molecular features of BL have not been comprehensively evaluated when taking into
account tumor EBV status or geographic origin. Through an integrative analysis of
whole-genome and transcriptome data, we show a striking genome-wide increase in
aberrant somatic hypermutation in EBV-positive tumors, supporting a link between 
EBV and activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AICDA) activity. In addition to
identifying novel candidate BL genes such as SIN3A, USP7, and CHD8, we
demonstrate that EBV-positive tumors had significantly fewer driver mutations,
especially among genes with roles in apoptosis. We also found immunoglobulin
variable region genes that were disproportionally used to encode clonal B-cell
receptors (BCRs) in the tumors. These include IGHV4-34, known to produce
autoreactive antibodies, and IGKV3-20, a feature described in other B-cell
malignancies but not yet in BL. Our results suggest that tumor EBV status defines
a specific BL phenotype irrespective of geographic origin, with particular
molecular properties and distinct pathogenic mechanisms. The novel mutation
patterns identified here imply rational use of DNA-damaging chemotherapy in some 
patients with BL and targeted agents such as the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in 
others, whereas the importance of BCR signaling in BL strengthens the potential
benefit of inhibitors for PI3K, Syk, and Src family kinases among these patients.
