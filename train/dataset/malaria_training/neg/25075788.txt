Countries could use the monitoring of drug resistance in malaria parasites as an 
effective early warning system to develop the timely response mechanisms that are
required to avert the further spread of malaria. Drug resistance surveillance is 
essential in areas where no drug resistance has been reported, especially if
neighbouring countries have previously reported resistance. Here, we present the 
results of a four-year surveillance program based on the sequencing of the pfcrt 
gene of Plasmodium falciparum populations from endemic areas of Honduras. All
isolates were susceptible to chloroquine, as revealed by the pfcrt "CVMNK"
genotype in codons 72-76.
