BACKGROUND: The role of the liver for survival of blood-stage malaria is only
poorly understood. In experimental blood-stage malaria with Plasmodium chabaudi, 
protective vaccination induces healing and, thus, survival of otherwise lethal
infections. This model is appropriate to study the role of the liver in
vaccination-induced survival of blood-stage malaria.
METHODS: Female Balb/c mice were vaccinated with a non-infectious vaccine
consisting of plasma membranes isolated in the form of erythrocyte ghosts from P.
chabaudi-infected erythrocytes at week 3 and week 1 before infection with P.
chabaudi blood-stage malaria. Gene expression microarrays and quantitative
real-time PCR were used to investigate the response of the liver, in terms of
expression of mRNA and long intergenic non-coding (linc)RNA, to
vaccination-induced healing infections and lethal P. chabaudi malaria at early
patency on day 4 post infection, when parasitized erythrocytes begin to appear in
peripheral blood.
RESULTS: In vaccination-induced healing infections, 23 genes were identified to
be induced in the liver by > tenfold at p < 0.01. More than one-third were genes 
known to be involved in erythropoiesis, such as Kel, Rhag, Ahsp, Ermap, Slc4a1,
Cldn13 Gata1, and Gfi1b. Another group of > tenfold expressed genes include genes
involved in natural cytotoxicity, such as those encoding killer cell lectin-like 
receptors Klrb1a, Klrc3, Klrd1, the natural cytotoxicity-triggering receptor 1
Ncr1, as well as the granzyme B encoding Gzmb. Additionally, a series of genes
involved in the control of cell cycle and mitosis were identified: Ccnb1, Cdc25c,
Ckap2l were expressed > tenfold only in vaccination-protected mice, and the
expression of 22 genes was at least 100% higher in vaccination-protected mice
than in non-vaccinated mice. Furthermore, distinct lincRNA species were changed
by > threefold in livers of vaccination-protected mice, whereas lethal malaria
induced different lincRNAs.
CONCLUSION: The present data suggest that protective vaccination accelerates the 
malaria-induced occurrence of extramedullary erythropoiesis, generation of
liver-resident cytotoxic cells, and regeneration from malaria-induced injury in
the liver at early patency, which may be critical for final survival of otherwise
lethal blood-stage malaria of P. chabaudi.
