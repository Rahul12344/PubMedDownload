The RTS,S candidate malaria vaccine can protect against controlled human malaria 
infection (CHMI), but how protection is achieved remains unclear. Here, we have
analyzed longitudinal peripheral blood transcriptome and immunogenicity data from
a clinical efficacy trial in which healthy adults received three RTS,S doses
4 weeks apart followed by CHMI 2 weeks later. Multiway partial least squares
discriminant analysis (N-PLS-DA) of transcriptome data identified 110 genes that 
could be used in predictive models of protection. Among the 110 genes, 42 had
known immune-related functions, including 29 that were related to the
NF-κB-signaling pathway and 14 to the IFN-γ-signaling pathway. Post-dose 3 serum 
IFN-γ concentrations were also correlated with protection; and N-PLS-DA of
IFN-γ-signaling pathway transcriptome data selected almost all (44/45) of the
representative genes for predictive models of protection. Hence, the
identification of the NF-κB and IFN-γ pathways provides further insight into how 
vaccine-mediated protection may be achieved.
