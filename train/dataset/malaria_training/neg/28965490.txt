BACKGROUND: Interventions are currently being used against 'infectious diseases
of poverty', which remain highly debilitating and deadly in most endemic
countries, especially malaria, schistosomiasis, echinococcosis and African
sleeping sickness. However, major limitations of current 'traditional' methods
for diagnosis are neither simple nor convenient for population surveillance, and 
showed low sensitivity and specificity. Access to novel technologies for the
development of adequate and reliable tools are expressly needed. A collaborative 
project between African Network for Drugs and Diagnostics Innovation and partner 
institutions in Africa and China aims to screen suitable serological biomarkers
for diagnostic pipelines against these 'diseases of the poor'.
METHODS: Parasite-specific exposed versus unexposed individuals were screened and
sera or urine/stools were collected through case-control studies in China and
African countries. Target genes/open reading frames were selected, then will be
cloned and cell-free expressed, quantified and immuno-detected. Target
antigens/epitopes will be probed and screened with sera from exposed or unexposed
individuals using a high-throughput antigen screening platform as the study
progresses. The specificity and sensitivity of highly immunoreactive biomarkers
will be evaluated as well, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays or dipsticks.
DISCUSSION: This roadmap explicitly unfolds the integrated operating procedures
with focus on malaria and schistosomiasis, for the identification of suitable
biomarkers that will aid the prioritization of diagnostics for population use.
However, there is need to further validate any new diagnostic through comparison 
with standard methods in field deployable tests for each region. Our expectations
for the future are to seek regulatory approval and promote the use of diagnostics
in endemic areas.
