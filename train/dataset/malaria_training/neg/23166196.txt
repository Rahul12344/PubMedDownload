The impact of malaria intervention measures (insecticide-treated net use and
artemisinin combination therapy) on malaria genetics was investigated at two
sites in western Kenya: an endemic lowland and an epidemic highland. The genetic 
structure of the parasite population was assessed by using microsatellites, and
the prevalence of drug-resistant mutations was examined by using the polymerase
chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Two years after
intervention, genetic diversity remained high in both populations. A significant 
decrease in the prevalence of quintuple mutations conferring resistance to
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine was detected in both populations, but the mutation
prevalence at codon 1246 of the Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance 1 gene
had increased in the highland population. The decrease in
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine-resistant mutants is encouraging, but the increase in
P. falciparum multidrug resistance 1 gene mutations is worrisome because these
mutations are linked to resistance to other antimalarial drugs. In addition, the 
high level of genetic diversity observed after intervention suggests transmission
is still high in each population.
