Imported malaria has been a great challenge for public health in Qatar due to
influx of large number of migrant workers. Antimalarial drug resistance has
emerged as one of the greatest challenges facing malaria control today.
Monitoring parasite haplotypes that predict susceptibility to major antimalarial 
can guide treatment policies. This study aimed to determine molecular drug
resistance pattern in imported malaria cases in Qatar. Blood samples from the
uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria patients were collected at Hamad General
Hospital, HMC, Doha, Qatar. The samples were further confirmed by
nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for P. falciparum. Molecular markers of
chloroquine (Pfcrt and Pfmdr1) were analyzed by using nested PCR- RFLP method to 
determine the key point mutations associated with chloroquine (CQ) drug
resistance. A total 118 blood samples were positive for P. falciparum. Overall,
by RFLP, 72% harboured wild type allele (N86) of Pfmdr1 gene. The prevalence of
Pfcrt mutant (T76), WT (K76) and mixed alleles (K76T) was 63.6% (n = 75), 22.9%
(n = 27) and 13.5% (n = 16), respectively. Mean parasitaemia level was higher
among the wild type alleles of Pfcrt gene as compared to the mixed/mutant alleles
whereas mixed alleles of Pfmdr1 gene having high parasitaemia. Molecular
surveillance strategy based on imported malaria cases can be used to detect and
track CQ drug-resistant malaria. The data presented here might be helpful for
enrichment of molecular surveillance of antimalarial resistance and will be
useful for developing and updating antimalarial guidance for non-immune imported 
cases in Qatar.
