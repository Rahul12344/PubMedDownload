BACKGROUND: Transmission of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum from
humans to the mosquito vector requires differentiation of a sub-population of
asexual forms replicating within red blood cells into non-dividing male and
female gametocytes. The nature of the molecular mechanism underlying this key
differentiation event required for malaria transmission is not fully understood.
METHODS: Whole genome sequencing was used to examine the genomic diversity of the
gametocyte non-producing 3D7-derived lines F12 and A4. These lines were used in
the recent detection of the PF3D7_1222600 locus (encoding PfAP2-G), which acts as
a genetic master switch that triggers gametocyte development.
RESULTS: The evolutionary changes from the 3D7 parental strain through its
derivatives F12 (culture-passage derived cloned line) and A4 (transgenic cloned
line) were identified. The genetic differences including the formation of
chimeric var genes are presented.
CONCLUSION: A genomics resource is provided for the further study of
gametocytogenesis or other phenotypes using these parasite lines.
