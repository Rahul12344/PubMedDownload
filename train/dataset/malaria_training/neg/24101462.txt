Anopheles gambiae is a major vector mosquito for Plasmodium falciparum, the
deadly pathogen causing most human malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. Synthesized in 
the fat body, trehalose is the predominant sugar in mosquito hemolymph. It not
only provides energy but also protects the mosquito against desiccation and heat 
stresses. Trehalose enters the mosquito hemolymph by the trehalose transporter
AgTreT1. In adult female A. gambiae, AgTreT1 is predominantly expressed in the
fat body. We found that AgTreT1 expression is induced by environmental stresses
such as low humidity or elevated temperature. AgTreT1 RNA silencing reduces the
hemolymph trehalose concentration by 40%, and the mosquitoes succumb sooner after
exposure to desiccation or heat. After an infectious blood meal, AgTreT1 RNA
silencing reduces the number of P. falciparum oocysts in the mosquito midgut by
over 70% compared with mock-injected mosquitoes. These data reveal important
roles for AgTreT1 in stress adaptation and malaria pathogen development in a
major vector mosquito. Thus, AgTreT1 may be a potential target for malaria vector
control.
