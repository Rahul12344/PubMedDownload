BACKGROUND: The decline in the efficacy of artemisinin-based combination
treatment (ACT) in some endemic regions threatens the progress towards global
elimination of malaria. Molecular surveillance of drug resistance in
malaria-endemic regions is vital to detect the emergence and spread of mutant
strains.
METHODS: We observed 89 malaria patients for the efficacy of
artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum 
infections in Lagos, Nigeria and determined the prevalence of drug resistant
strains in the population. Parasite clearance rates were determined by microscopy
and the highly sensitive var gene acidic terminal sequence (varATS) polymerase
chain reaction for 65 patients with samples on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28
after commencement of treatment. The genomic finger print of parasite DNA from
pre- and post-treatment samples were determined using 24 nuclear single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) barcode for P. falciparum. Drug resistance
associated alleles in chloroquine resistance transporter gene (crt-76), multidrug
resistance genes (mdr1-86 and mdr1-184), dihydropteroate synthase (dhps-540),
dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr-108) and kelch domain (K-13580) were genotyped by
high resolution melt analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments.
RESULTS: By varATS qPCR, 12 (18.5%) of the participants had detectable parasite
DNA in their blood three days after treatment, while eight (12.3%) individuals
presented with genotypable day 28 parasitaemia. Complexity of infection (CoI) was
1.30 on day 0 and 1.34 on day 28, the mean expected heterozygosity (HE) values
across all barcodes were 0.50 ± 0.05 and 0.56 ± 0.05 on days 0 and 28
respectively. Barcode (π) pairwise comparisons showed high genetic relatedness of
day 0 and day 28 parasite isolates in three (37.5%) of the eight individuals who 
presented with re-appearing infections. Crt-76 mutant allele was present in 38
(58.5%) isolates. The mdr1-86 mutant allele was found in 56 (86.2%) isolates. No 
mutation in the K-13580 was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Persistence of DNA-detectable parasitaemia in more than 18% of cases
after treatment and indications of genetic relatedness between pre- and
post-treatment infections warrants further investigation of a larger population
for signs of reduced ACT efficacy in Nigeria.
