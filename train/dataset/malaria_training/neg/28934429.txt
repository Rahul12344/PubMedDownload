Cerebral malaria, a reversible encephalopathy affecting young children, is a
medical emergency requiring urgent clinical assessment and treatment. We
performed a whole-transcriptomic analysis of blood samples from Malian children
with cerebral or uncomplicated malaria. We focused on transcripts from pathways
for which dysfunction has been associated with neurodegenerative disorders. We
found that SNCA, SIAH2, UBB, HSPA1A, TUBB2A, and PINK1 were upregulated
(fold-increases, ≥2.6), whereas UBD and PSMC5 were downregulated (fold-decreases,
≤4.39) in children with cerebral malaria, compared with those with uncomplicated 
malaria. These findings provide the first evidence for pathogenic mechanisms
common to human cerebral malaria and neurodegenerative disorders.
