We compared light microscopy examination and a semi-nested multiplex PCR
(SnM-PCR) assay in endemic areas of the Islamic Republic of Iran. A total of 68
individuals with malaria-positive and suspected malaria symptoms were included in
the study. Giemsa-stained thick blood films were examined under a light
microscope for malaria parasites in 100 and 200 fields. DNA was extracted from
blood samples and SnM-PCR based on the amplification of the small sub-unit
ribosomal RNA (ssrRNA) gene sequences was applied. Microscopical examination
showed that 48.5% (33.8% P. vivax and 14.7% P.falciparum) and 50% (35.3% P. vivax
and 14.7% P. falciparum) of the samples were positive in 100 and 200 fields
respectively. SnM-PCR showed the same results as the 200 field microscopy.
