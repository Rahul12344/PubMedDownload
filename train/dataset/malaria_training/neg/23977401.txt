Anopheles gambiae, the main mosquito vector of human malaria, is a challenging
organism to manipulate genetically. As a consequence, reverse genetics studies in
this disease vector have been largely limited to RNA interference experiments.
Here, we report the targeted disruption of the immunity gene TEP1 using
transgenic expression of Transcription-Activator Like Effector Nucleases
(TALENs), and the isolation of several TEP1 mutant A. gambiae lines. These
mutations inhibited protein production and rendered TEP1 mutants hypersusceptible
to Plasmodium berghei. The TALEN technology opens up new avenues for genetic
analysis in this disease vector and may offer novel biotechnology-based
approaches for malaria control.
