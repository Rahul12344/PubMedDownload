We describe two improved assays for in vitro and in vivo screening of inhibitors 
and chemicals for antimalarial activity against blood stages of the rodent
malaria parasite, Plasmodium berghei. These assays are based on the determination
of bioluminescence in small blood samples that is produced by reporter parasites 
expressing luciferase. Luciferase production increases as the parasite develops
in a red blood cell and as the numbers of parasites increase during an infection.
In the first assay, in vitro drug luminescence (ITDL) assay, the in vitro
development of ring-stage parasites into mature schizonts in the presence and
absence of candidate inhibitor(s) is quantified by measuring luciferase activity 
after the parasites have been allowed to mature into schizonts in culture. In the
second assay, the in vivo drug luminescence (IVDL) assay, in vivo parasite growth
(using a standard 4-day suppressive drug test) is quantified by measuring the
luciferase activity of circulating parasites in samples of tail blood of
drug-treated mice.
