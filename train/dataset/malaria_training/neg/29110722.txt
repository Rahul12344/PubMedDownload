BACKGROUND: Drug resistance is one of the greatest challenges of malaria control 
programmes, with the monitoring of parasite resistance to artemisinins or to
Artemisinin Combination Therapy (ACT) partner drugs critical to elimination
efforts. Markers of resistance to a wide panel of antimalarials were assessed in 
natural parasite populations from southwestern Cameroon.
METHODS: Individuals with asymptomatic parasitaemia or uncomplicated malaria were
enrolled through cross-sectional surveys from May 2013 to March 2014 along the
slope of mount Cameroon. Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasitaemic blood,
screened by light microscopy, was depleted of leucocytes using CF11 cellulose
columns and the parasite genotype ascertained by sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq
platform.
RESULTS: A total of 259 participants were enrolled in this study from three
different altitudes. While some alleles associated with drug resistance in
pfdhfr, pfmdr1 and pfcrt were highly prevalent, less than 3% of all samples
carried mutations in the pfkelch13 gene, none of which were amongst those
associated with slow artemisinin parasite clearance rates in Southeast Asia. The 
most prevalent haplotypes were triple mutants Pfdhfr I 51 R 59 N 108 I 164(99%), 
pfcrt- C72V73 I 74 E 75 T 76 (47.3%), and single mutants PfdhpsS436 G
437K540A581A613(69%) and Pfmdr1 N86 F 184D1246 (53.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: The predominance of the Pf pfcrt CVIET and Pf dhfr IRN triple mutant
parasites and absence of pfkelch13 resistance alleles suggest that the
amodiaquine and pyrimethamine components of AS-AQ and SP may no longer be
effective in their role while chloroquine resistance still persists in
southwestern Cameroon.
