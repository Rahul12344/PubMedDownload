If copy number variants (CNVs) are predominantly deleterious, we would expect
them to be more efficiently purged from populations with a large effective
population size (Ne) than from populations with a small Ne. Malaria parasites
(Plasmodium falciparum) provide an excellent organism to examine this prediction,
because this protozoan shows a broad spectrum of population structures within a
single species, with large, stable, outbred populations in Africa, small unstable
inbred populations in South America and with intermediate population
characteristics in South East Asia. We characterized 122 single-clone parasites, 
without prior laboratory culture, from malaria-infected patients in seven
countries in Africa, South East Asia and South America using a high-density
single-nucleotide polymorphism/CNV microarray. We scored 134 high-confidence CNVs
across the parasite exome, including 33 deletions and 102 amplifications, which
ranged in size from <500 bp to 59 kb, as well as 10,107 flanking, biallelic
single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Overall, CNVs were rare, small, and skewed
toward low frequency variants, consistent with the deleterious model. Relative to
African and South East Asian populations, CNVs were significantly more common in 
South America, showed significantly less skew in allele frequencies, and were
significantly larger. On this background of low frequency CNV, we also identified
several high-frequency CNVs under putative positive selection using an FST
outlier analysis. These included known adaptive CNVs containing rh2b and pfmdr1, 
and several other CNVs (e.g., DNA helicase and three conserved proteins) that
require further investigation. Our data are consistent with a significant impact 
of genetic structure on CNV burden in an important human pathogen.
