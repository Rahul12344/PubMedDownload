Plasmodium vivax is the most prevalent parasite worldwide, escalating by spread
of drug resistance. Currently, in Qatar, chloroquine (CQ) plus primaquine are
recommended for the treatment of P. vivax malaria. The present study examined the
prevalence of mutations in dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr), dihydropteroate
synthase (dhps) genes and CQ resistance transporter (crt-o) genes, associated
with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and chloroquine resistance, among imported
P. vivax cases in Qatar. Blood samples were collected from patients positive for 
P. vivax and seeking medical treatment at Hamad General Hospital, Doha, during
2013-2016. The Sanger sequencing method was performed to examine the single
nucleotide polymorphisms in Pvdhfr, Pvdhps, and Pvcrt-o genes. Of 314 examined P.
vivax isolates, 247 (78.7%), 294 (93.6%) and 261 (83.1%) were successfully
amplified and sequenced for Pvdhfr, Pvdhps, and Pvcrt-o, respectively. Overall,
53.8% (N = 133) carried mutant alleles (58R/117N) in Pvdhfr, whereas 77.2% (N =
227) and 90% (N = 235) isolates possessed wild type allele in Pvdhps and Pvcrt-o 
genes, respectively. In addition, a total of eleven distinct haplotypes were
detected in Pvdhfr/Pvdhps genes. Interestingly, K10 insertion in the Pvcrt-o gene
was observed only in patients originating from the Indian subcontinent. The
results suggested that CQ remains an acceptable treatment regimen but further
clinical data are required to assess the effectiveness of CQ and SP in Qatar to
support the current national treatment guidelines. In addition, limited
distribution of genetic polymorphisms associated with CQ and SP resistance
observed in imported P. vivax infections, necessitates regular monitoring of drug
resistant P. vivax malaria in Qatar.
