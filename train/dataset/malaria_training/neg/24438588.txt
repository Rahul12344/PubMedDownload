BACKGROUND: Anopheles sinensis is an important mosquito vector of Plasmodium
vivax, which is the most frequent and widely distributed cause of recurring
malaria throughout Asia, and particularly in China, Korea, and Japan.
RESULTS: We performed 454 next-generation sequencing and obtained a draft
sequence of A. sinensis assembled into scaffolds spanning 220.8 million base
pairs. Analysis of this genome sequence, we observed expansion and contraction of
several immune-related gene families in anopheline relative to culicine mosquito 
species. These differences suggest that species-specific immune responses to
Plasmodium invasion underpin the biological differences in susceptibility to
Plasmodium infection that characterize these two mosquito subfamilies.
CONCLUSIONS: The A. sinensis genome produced in this study, provides an important
resource for analyzing the genetic basis of susceptibility and resistance of
mosquitoes to Plasmodium parasites research which will ultimately facilitate the 
design of urgently needed interventions against this debilitating mosquito-borne 
disease.
