Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes play a key role in the immune response to
infectious diseases, some of which are highly prevalent in specific environments,
like malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. Former case-control studies showed that one
particular HLA-B allele, B*53, was associated with malaria protection in Gambia, 
but this hypothesis was not tested so far within a population genetics framework.
In this study, our objective was to assess whether pathogen-driven selection
associated with malaria contributed to shape the HLA-B genetic landscape of
Africa. To that aim, we first typed the HLA-A and -B loci in 484 individuals from
11 populations living in different environments across the Sahel, and we analysed
these data together with those available for 29 other populations using several
approaches including linear modelling on various genetic, geographic and
environmental parameters. In addition to relevant signatures of populations'
demography and migrations history in the genetic differentiation patterns of both
HLA-A and -B loci, we found that the frequencies of three HLA alleles, B*53, B*78
and A*74, were significantly associated with Plasmodium falciparum malaria
prevalence, suggesting their increase through pathogen-driven selection in
malaria-endemic environments. The two HLA-B alleles were further identified, by
high-throughput sequencing, as B*53:01:01 (in putative linkage disequilibrium
with one HLA-C allele, C*04:01:01:01) and B*78:01 in all but one individuals
tested, making them appropriate candidates to malaria protection. These results
highlight the role of environmental factors in the evolution of the HLA
polymorphism and open key perspectives for functional studies focusing on HLA
peptide-binding properties.
