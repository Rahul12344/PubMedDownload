Insect pericardial cells (PCs) are strategically located along the dorsal vessel 
where they encounter a high hemolymph flow enabling them to undertake their
osmoregulatory, detoxifying, and scavenging functions. In this location, PCs also
encounter foreign molecules and microorganisms. The response of PCs of the
mosquito Anopheles albimanus, one of the most important Plasmodium vivax vectors 
in Mexico and Latin America, to Saccharomyces cerevisiae was analyzed by using
biochemical, cellular, ultrastructural, and bioinformatics approaches. Immune
gene transcripts were identified in the PC transcriptome of A. albimanus. PCs
responded to the presence of yeast and zymosan with increased lysosomal and
phosphatase activities and produced lytic activity against bacteria. Our results 
indicate that mosquito PCs play a key role in the neutralization and elimination 
of pathogens.
