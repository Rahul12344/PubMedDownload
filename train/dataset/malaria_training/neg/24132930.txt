Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)-mediated malaria is one of the most devastating
diseases in the world, and the search for suitable antimalarial drugs remains an 
extraordinary challenge for scientists working in this area. Novel unconventional
approaches could reveal new potential targets that may be useful for the
treatment of malaria. We used a bioinformatics approach to analyze the entire
genome of the Pf3D7 strain. Because the carbon (C-) content is a pivotal
parameter that determines the hydrophobicity of a protein, which in turn controls
protein folding and function, we analyzed the entire Pf3D7 proteome based on the 
gene's thymine (T)-controlled amino acid expression. Our data disclose a total of
14 proteins encoded by chromosome-4 and chromosome-9 that have an outstanding
T-encoded and C-controlled hydrophobic character. The identification of these
proteins could open new pivotal drug-targeting avenues.
