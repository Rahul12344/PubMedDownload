Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii are obligate intracellular
apicomplexan parasites that rapidly invade and extensively modify host cells.
Protein phosphorylation is one mechanism by which these parasites can control
such processes. Here we present a phosphoproteome analysis of peptides enriched
from schizont stage P. falciparum and T. gondii tachyzoites that are either
"intracellular" or purified away from host material. Using liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we identified over 5,000 and 10,000
previously unknown phosphorylation sites in P. falciparum and T. gondii,
respectively, revealing that protein phosphorylation is an extensively used
regulation mechanism both within and beyond parasite boundaries. Unexpectedly,
both parasites have phosphorylated tyrosines, and P. falciparum has unusual
phosphorylation motifs that are apparently shaped by its A:T-rich genome. This
data set provides important information on the role of phosphorylation in the
host-pathogen interaction and clues to the evolutionary forces operating on
protein phosphorylation motifs in both parasites.
