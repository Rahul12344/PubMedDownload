Infection of erythrocytes with the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum,
results in dramatic changes to the host cell structure and morphology. The
predicted functional localization of the STEVOR proteins at the erythrocyte
surface suggests that they may be involved in parasite-induced modifications of
the erythrocyte membrane during parasite development. To address the biologic
function of STEVOR proteins, we subjected a panel of stevor transgenic parasites 
and wild-type clonal lines exhibiting different expression levels for stevor
genes to functional assays exploring parasite-induced modifications of the
erythrocyte membrane. Using this approach, we show that stevor expression impacts
deformability of the erythrocyte membrane. This process may facilitate parasite
sequestration in deep tissue vasculature.
