BACKGROUND: Insecticide resistance is a growing concern for malaria control and
vector control effectiveness relies on assessing it distribution and
understanding its evolution.
METHODS: We assessed resistance levels and the frequencies of two major
target-site mutations, L1014F-VGSC and G119S-ace-1, conferring resistance to
pyrethroids (PYRs) and carbamates/organophosphates (CXs/OPs) insecticides. These 
data were compared to those acquired between 2006 and 2010 to follow resistance
evolutionary trends over ten years.
RESULTS: We report the results of a 3-year survey (2013-2015) of insecticide
resistance in 13 localities across the whole country of Benin. Permethrin (PYR)
resistance was found in all populations tested, L1014F-VGSC being almost fixed
everywhere, while bendiocarb resistance was limited to a few localities,
G119S-ace-1 remaining rare, with very limited variations during surveyed period. 
Interestingly, we found no effect of the type of insecticide pressure on the
dynamics of these mutations.
CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm both the high prevalence of PYR resistance and
the potential of CXs/OPs as short- to medium-term alternatives in Benin. They
also underline the need for regular resistance monitoring and informed management
in their usage, as the G119S-ace-1 mutation is already present in Benin and
surrounding countries. Their unwise usage would rapidly lead to its spread, which
would jeopardize PYR-resistant Anopheles control.
