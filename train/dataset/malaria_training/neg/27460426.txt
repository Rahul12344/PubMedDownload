There is concern that susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus to tetracyclines
may decrease due to use of antimalarial prophylaxis (doxycycline). We examined
characteristics related to tetracycline resistance, including doxycycline
exposure, in S. aureus isolates collected via admission surveillance swabs and
inpatient clinical cultures from United States military personnel injured during 
deployment (June 2009-January 2012). Tetracycline class resistance was determined
using antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The first S. aureus isolate from 168 
patients were analyzed, of which 38 (23%) isolates were resistant to
tetracyclines (class). Tetracycline-resistant isolates had a higher proportion of
resistance to clindamycin (P=0.019) compared to susceptible isolates. There was
no significant difference in tetracycline resistance between isolates collected
from patients with and without antimalarial prophylaxis; however, significantly
more isolates had tet(M) resistance genes in the doxycycline exposure group
(P=0.031). Despite 55% of the patients receiving doxycycline as antimalarial
prophylaxis, there was no association with resistance to tetracyclines.
