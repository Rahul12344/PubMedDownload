Baculovirus vectors (BVs) enable safe and efficient gene delivery to mammalian
cells and are useful in a wide range of applications, including gene therapy and 
in vivo analysis of gene functions. We previously developed BVs expressing
malaria sporozoite surface proteins for targeting liver cells or hepatocytes.
However, BVs are known to be very vulnerable to complement attack and efforts to 
overcome their inactivation based on complement are important. In this study, BVs
expressing complement regulatory proteins (CRPs) on the surfaces of virions were 
developed to inhibit complement reactions. Decay accelerating factor (DAF;
CD55)-type BVs exhibited significantly higher complement resistance than control 
BVs without any CRPs in HepG2 cells transduction, although the transduction
efficacy of DAF-type BV was low. In contrast, CD46-DAF-CD59 fusion type BVs
showed significantly higher transduction efficacy and complement resistance than 
both control and DAF-type BVs. DAF-type and CD46-DAF-CD59 type BVs repressed
formation of the membrane attack complex, a terminal product of complement
reaction cascades, induced by BVs. These results suggest that the CD46-DAF-CD59
fusion construct confers complement protection ability superior to that of the
DAF construct in gene delivery under complement active serum.
