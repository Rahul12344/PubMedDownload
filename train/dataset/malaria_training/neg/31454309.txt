Malaria was present in most of Europe until the second half of the 20th century, 
when it was eradicated through a combination of increased surveillance and
mosquito control strategies, together with cross-border and political
collaboration. Despite the severe burden of malaria on human populations, it
remains contentious how the disease arrived and spread in Europe. Here, we report
a partial Plasmodium falciparum nuclear genome derived from a set of antique
medical slides stained with the blood of malaria-infected patients from Spain's
Ebro Delta, dating to the 1940s. Our analyses of the genome of this now
eradicated European P. falciparum strain confirms stronger phylogeographical
affinity to present-day strains in circulation in central south Asia, rather than
to those in Africa. This points to a longitudinal, rather than a latitudinal,
spread of malaria into Europe. In addition, this genome displays two derived
alleles in the pfmrp1 gene that have been associated with drug resistance. Whilst
this could represent standing variation in the ancestral P. falciparum
population, these mutations may also have arisen due to the selective pressure of
quinine treatment, which was an anti-malarial drug already in use by the time the
sample we sequenced was mounted on a slide.
