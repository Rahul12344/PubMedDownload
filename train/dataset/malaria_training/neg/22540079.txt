BACKGROUND: Control of malaria during pregnancy remains a major public health
challenge in developing countries. Microscopic parasite detection represents a
pivotal step in malaria control, while modern molecular techniques are deemed to 
improve detection rates markedly.
AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the frequency of submicroscopic and
multiple Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) infections during pregnancy, using
the P. falciparum merozoite surface protein1 (MSP-1) gene as a polymorphic
marker.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional, analytical study that was
conducted at Omdurman Maternity Hospital, Sudan, between July 2003 and December
2004. Following informed consent, 836 pregnant women between the ages of 16-47
years with different gestational ages were enrolled in the study. Thin and thick 
blood films were stained with Giemsa and examined by experienced microscopists.
Parasite DNA was extracted using Chelex method. Nested polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) assays specific for P. falciparum were carried out to detect infections
below the threshold of microscopy and to genotype different strains in the
samples using merozoite surface protein-1.
RESULTS: More than a quarter of the study participants (219/836; 26.2%) were
smear-positive for malaria infection. The results of the PCR-based assays showed 
that 41.8 % (257/617) of the smear-negative women were PCR positive and therefore
had submicroscopic infections. The mean number of genetically different P.
falciparum parasites detected was 2.7 (range 1-9). The multiplicity of infection 
identified by at least two alleles of MSP-1 was significantly higher among
paucigravidae (45.6%) compared to multigravidae (28.9%), with mean number of
alleles of 2.4 and 1.9, respectively (p=0.009). This likely indicates the gradual
acquisition of immunity.
CONCLUSION: Conventional microscopy underestimates the actual extent of malaria
infections during pregnancy in endemic regions. Multiplicity of infection may be 
an important factor in the gradual acquisition of strain-specific immunity.
