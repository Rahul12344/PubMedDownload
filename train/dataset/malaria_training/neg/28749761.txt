The Caribbean island of Hispaniola is targeted for malaria elimination.
Currently, this is the only island with ongoing transmission of malaria in the
Caribbean. In 2015, six patients from Puerto Rico and one from Massachusetts, who
traveled to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, were confirmed to be infected with
Plasmodium falciparum. Additional molecular analysis was performed at the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention to characterize the drug-resistant alleles and
Plasmodium population genetic markers. All specimens carried wildtype genotypes
for chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, and artemisinin resistance genetic
markers. A mutation in codon 184 (Y/F) of Pfmdr-1 gene was observed in all
samples and they shared an identical genetic lineage as determined by
microsatellite analysis. This genetic profile was similar to one previously
reported from Hispaniola suggesting that a clonal P. falciparum residual parasite
population present in Punta Cana is the source population for these imported
malaria cases.
