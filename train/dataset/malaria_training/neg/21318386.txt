Plasmodium vivax is classified into two serotypes, VK210 [the dominant
form-GDRA(D/A)GQPA repeats] and VK247 [the variant form-ANGA(G/D)(N/D)QPG
repeats], based on sequence variation of the repeat region of the
circumsporozoite (CS) protein gene. Genomic DNA for the variant CS protein gene
was obtained from field isolate strains in Myanmar. The repetitive region has
highly 19 immunogenic repeats flanked by non-repeat stretches of amino acids. The
sequence including this region (717 bp) was subcloned into the expression vector 
pQE30 and expressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed recombinant protein has a 
molecular weight of about 50 kDa as analyzed by sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis. Anti-VK247
antibodies were found in malaria patients who have been exposed to variant form
of P. vivax in western blot analysis. Therefore, this recombinant protein might
be a useful tool in serodiagnosis of malaria patients who have been infected with
variant form of P. vivax.
