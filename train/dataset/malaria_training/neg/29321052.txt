BACKGROUND: Anopheles sinensis is an important malaria vector in Southeast Asia. 
The widespread emergence of insecticide resistance in this mosquito species poses
a serious threat to the efficacy of malaria control measures, particularly in
China. Recently, the whole-genome sequencing and de novo assembly of An. sinensis
(China strain) has been finished. A series of insecticide-resistant studies in
An. sinensis have also been reported. There is a growing need to integrate these 
valuable data to provide a comprehensive database for further studies on
insecticide-resistant management of An. sinensis.
RESULTS: A bioinformatics database named An. sinensis genome database (ASGDB) was
built. In addition to being a searchable database of published An. sinensis
genome sequences and annotation, ASGDB provides in-depth analytical platforms for
further understanding of the genomic and genetic data, including visualization of
genomic data, orthologous relationship analysis, GO analysis, pathway analysis,
expression analysis and resistance-related gene analysis. Moreover, ASGDB
provides a panoramic view of insecticide resistance studies in An. sinensis in
China. In total, 551 insecticide-resistant phenotypic and genotypic reports on
An. sinensis distributed in Chinese malaria-endemic areas since the mid-1980s
have been collected, manually edited in the same format and integrated into
OpenLayers map-based interface, which allows the international community to
assess and exploit the high volume of scattered data much easier. The database
has been given the URL: http://www.asgdb.org /.
CONCLUSIONS: ASGDB was built to help users mine data from the genome sequence of 
An. sinensis easily and effectively, especially with its advantages in
insecticide resistance surveillance and control.
