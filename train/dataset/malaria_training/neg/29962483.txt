Anopheles (Anopheles) lindesayi Giles consists of 5 subspecies. In Japan, only
one subspecies, An. l. japonicus Yamada, has been reported. Its geographical
populations are morphologically diverse; however, they are regarded as a single
subspecies. In this study, we re-evaluated the taxonomic status of An. l.
japonicus in Japan, and that of another subspecies, An. l. pleccau, distributed
in Taiwan, by comparative morphological and molecular analyses based on the gene 
sequences of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and ribosomal DNA
internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2). Nucleotide sequence divergence was
calculated using the Kimura-two-parameter (K2P) distance model. Phylogenetic
trees based on COI and ITS2 sequences showed 3 distinct clades: Eastern Japan,
Western Japan, and the Ryukyus. The sequences of the Ryukyu specimens were
located within the same clade as that of the sequences of the Taiwanese
specimens. Regarding the COI sequences, the 3 geographical groups in Japan were
genetically distinct. The following morphological characteristics distinguished
the groups: larval seta 1-S, pupal setae 5 through segments IV-VII, and pupal
setae 6 on segments IV-VII. Based on these results, it was revealed that An. l.
japonicus included 3 genetically and morphologically distinct groups: 2 groups of
An. l. japonicus and a group in the Ryukyus, which was a synonym of An. l.
pleccau.
