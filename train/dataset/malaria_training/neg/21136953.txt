Malaria causes a worldwide annual mortality of about a million people. Rapidly
evolving drug-resistant species of the parasite have created a pressing need for 
the identification of new drug targets and vaccine candidates. By developing
fractionation protocols to enrich parasites from low-parasitemia patient samples,
we have carried out the first ever proteomics analysis of clinical isolates of
early stages of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and P. vivax. Patient-derived malarial
parasites were directly processed and analyzed using shotgun proteomics approach 
using high-sensitivity MS for protein identification. Our study revealed about
100 parasite-coded gene products that included many known drug targets such as Pf
hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase, Pf L-lactate dehydrogenase, and 
Plasmepsins. In addition, our study reports the expression of several parasite
proteins in clinical ring stages that have never been reported in the ring stages
of the laboratory-cultivated parasite strain. This proof-of-principle study
represents a noteworthy step forward in our understanding of pathways elaborated 
by the parasite within the malaria patient and will pave the way towards
identification of new drug and vaccine targets that can aid malaria therapy.
