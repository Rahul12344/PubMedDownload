BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of Plasmodium
vivax and polymorphisms in the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) gene 
in patients with suspected malaria from eastern (Harar) and southwestern (Jimma) 
Ethiopia.
METHODS: Plasmodium presence and species was assessed by microscopy in 1304 and
627 febrile patients in Harar and Jimma, respectively, during October-November
2009. All microscopy-positive samples were confirmed by PCR. DARC gene
polymorphisms were identified by DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Plasmodium vivax was the dominant species in Harar (74/98, 76%) and P.
falciparum was more common in Jimma (70/107, 65%). We found 17/98 (17%) and
24/107 (22%) homozygous Duffy-negative patients in Harar and Jimma, respectively.
Unexpectedly, three Duffy-negative patients from Harar had P. vivax malaria.
CONCLUSION: This study documents the emergence of P. vivax malaria in
Duffy-negative individuals in Ethiopia. The Duffy-negative blood group does not
appear to provide absolute protection against P. vivax infection in this region.
