Case fatality rates for severe malaria remain high even in the best clinical
settings because antimalarial drugs act against the parasite without alleviating 
life-threatening inflammation. We assessed the potential for host-directed
therapy of severe malaria of a new class of anti-inflammatory drugs, the innate
defense regulator (IDR) peptides, based on host defense peptides. The Plasmodium 
berghei ANKA model of experimental cerebral malaria was adapted to use as a
preclinical screen by combining late-stage intervention in established infections
with advanced bioinformatic analysis of early transcriptional changes in
co-regulated gene sets. Coadministration of IDR-1018 with standard first-line
antimalarials increased survival of infected mice while down-regulating key
inflammatory networks associated with fatality. Thus, IDR peptides provided
host-directed adjunctive therapy for severe disease in combination with
antimalarial treatment.
