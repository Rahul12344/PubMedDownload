Two polymorphic marker genes, merozoite surface protein 3α (PvMSP3α) and
merozoite surface protein 3β (PvMSP3β), from 100 Plasmodium vivax field isolates,
were investigated using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length
polymorphism (PCR/RFLP). Genotyping of PvMSP3α and PvMSP3β revealed marked
polymorphisms in length and sequence. Three major types of PvMSP3α (Type A, B and
C) and two major types of PvMSP3β (Type A and B) were detected based on the
length of PCR products. Fourteen alleles of both genes with difference
frequencies were distinguished by restriction fragment length polymorphism, and
these results strongly support that P. vivax isolates in Thailand are markedly
diverse. PvMSP3α and PvMSP3β are reliable polymorphic markers for population
genetic analysis of P. vivax, and PCR/RFLP provides a powerful method for
genotyping and identification of mixed parasite infections without requirement of
gene sequencing.
