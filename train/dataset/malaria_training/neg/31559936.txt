C-mannosylation was recently identified in the thrombospondin-related anonymous
protein (TRAP) from Plasmodium falciparum salivary gland sporozoites. A candidate
P. falciparum C-mannosyltransferase (PfDPY-19) was demonstrated to modify
thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR) domains in vitro, exhibiting a different
acceptor specificity than their mammalian counterparts. According to the
described minimal acceptor of PfDPY19, several TSR domain-containing proteins of 
P. falciparum could be C-mannosylated in vivo. However, the relevance of this
protein modification for the parasite viability remains unknown. In the present
study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate a PfDPY19 null mutant,
demonstrating that this glycosyltransferase is not essential for the asexual
blood development of the parasite. PfDPY19 gene disruption was not associated
with a growth phenotype, not even under endoplasmic reticulum-stressing
conditions that could impair protein folding. The data presented in this work
strongly suggest that PfDPY19 is unlikely to play a critical role in the asexual 
blood stages of the parasite, at least under in vitro conditions.
