Both the invasion of red blood cells (RBCs) by Plasmodium falciparum parasites
and the sequestration of parasite-infected RBCs in the microvasculature are
mediated in part by complement receptor one (CR1). RBC surface CR1 level can vary
between individuals by more than 20-fold and may be associated with the risk of
severe malaria. The factors that influence RBC CR1 level variation are poorly
understood, particularly in African populations. We studied 3535 child residents 
of a malaria-endemic region of coastal Kenya and report, for the first time, that
the CR1 Knops blood group alleles Sl2 and McC(b), and homozygous HbSS are
positively associated with RBC CR1 level. Sickle cell trait and ABO blood group
did not influence RBC CR1 level. We also confirm the previous observation that
α(+)thalassaemia is associated with reduced RBC CR1 level, possibly due to small 
RBC volume, and that age-related changes in RBC CR1 expression occur throughout
childhood. RBC CR1 level in malaria-endemic African populations is a complex
phenotype influenced by multiple factors that should be taken into account in the
design and interpretation of future studies on CR1 and malaria susceptibility.
