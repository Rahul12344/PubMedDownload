The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) harbors 11% of global malaria cases,
yet little is known about the spatial and genetic structure of the parasite
population in that country. We sequence 2537 Plasmodium falciparum infections,
including a nationally representative population sample from DRC and samples from
surrounding countries, using molecular inversion probes - a high-throughput
genotyping tool. We identify an east-west divide in haplotypes known to confer
resistance to chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Furthermore, we identify
highly related parasites over large geographic distances, indicative of gene flow
and migration. Our results are consistent with a background of isolation by
distance combined with the effects of selection for antimalarial drug resistance.
This study provides a high-resolution view of parasite genetic structure across a
large country in Africa and provides a baseline to study how implementation
programs may impact parasite populations.
