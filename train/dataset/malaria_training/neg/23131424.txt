Antimalarial chemotherapy is one of the main pillars in the prevention and
control of malaria. Following widespread resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to
chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine came to the scene as an alternative to the
cheap and well-tolerated chloroquine. However, widespread resistance to
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine has been documented. In vivo efficacy tests are the
gold standard for assessing drug resistance and treatment failure. However, they 
have many disadvantages, such as influence of host immunity and drug
pharmacokinetics. In vitro tests of antimalarial drug efficacy also have many
technical difficulties. Molecular markers of resistance have emerged as
epidemiologic tools to investigate antimalarial drug resistance even before
becoming clinically evident. Mutations in P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase
and dihydrofolate synthase have been extensively studied as molecular markers for
resistance to pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine, respectively. This review highlights
the resistance of P. falciparum at the molecular level presenting both supporting
and opposing studies on the utility of molecular markers.
