BACKGROUND: Resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to anti-malarial drugs has
hampered efforts to eradicate malaria. Recent reports of a decline in the
prevalence of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum in several countries, including
Malawi and Zambia, is raising the hope of reintroducing chloroquine in the near
future, ideally in combination with another anti-malarial drug for the treatment 
of uncomplicated malaria. In Côte d'Ivoire, the decrease in the clinical efficacy
of chloroquine, in addition to a high proportion of clinical isolates carrying
the Thr-76 mutant allele of the pfcrt gene, had led to the discontinuation of the
use of chloroquine in 2004. Previous studies have indicated the persistence of a 
high prevalence of the Thr-76 mutant allele despite the withdrawal of chloroquine
as first-line anti-malarial drug. This present study is conducted to determine
the prevalence of the Thr-76T mutant allele of the Pfcrt gene after a decade of
the ban on the sale and use of chloroquine in Côte d'Ivoire.
RESULTS: Analysis of the 64 sequences from all three study sites indicated a
prevalence of 15% (10/64) of the Thr-76 mutant allele against 62% (40/64) of the 
Lys-76 wild-type allele. No mutation of the allele Thr-76 was observed at
Anonkoua Kouté while this mutant allele was in 31% (5/16) and 25% (5/20) of
isolate sequences from Port-Bouët and Ayamé respectively.
CONCLUSION: More than a decade after the discontinuation of the use of
chloroquine in Côte d'Ivoire, the proportion of parasites sensitive to this
anti-malarial seems to increase in Anonkoua-kouté, Port-bouët and Ayamé.
