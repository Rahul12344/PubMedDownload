BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum malaria remains a leading health problem in
Africa and its control is seriously challenged by drug resistance. Although
resistance to the sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is widespread, this combination
remains an important component of malaria control programmes as intermittent
preventive therapy (IPT) for pregnant women and children. In Angola, resistance
patterns have been poorly characterized, and IPT has been employed for pregnant
women since 2006. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of key
antifolate resistance mediating polymorphisms in the pfdhfr and pfdhps genes in
P. falciparum samples from Angola.
METHODS: Plasmodium falciparum samples collected in Luanda, in 2007, were
genotyped by amplification and DNA forward and reverse sequencing of the pfdhfr
and pfdhps genes.
RESULTS: The most prevalent polymorphisms identified were pfdhfr 108N (100%), 51I
(93%), 59R (57%) and pfdhps 437G (93%). Resistance-mediating polymorphisms in
pfdhps less commonly observed in West Africa were also identified (540E in 10%,
581G in 7% of samples).
CONCLUSION: This study documents an important prevalence of 4 P. falciparum
polymorphisms that predicts an antifolate resistance in Luanda. Further, some
samples presented additional mutations associated to high-level resistance. These
results suggest that the use of SP for IPT may no longer be warranted in Angola.
