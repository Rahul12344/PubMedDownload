The search for antimalarial chemotypes with modes of action unrelated to existing
drugs has intensified with the recent failure of first-line therapies across
Southeast Asia. Here, we show that the trisubstituted imidazole MMV030084
potently inhibits hepatocyte invasion by Plasmodium sporozoites, merozoite egress
from asexual blood stage schizonts, and male gamete exflagellation. Metabolomic, 
phosphoproteomic, and chemoproteomic studies, validated with conditional
knockdown parasites, molecular docking, and recombinant kinase assays, identified
cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) as the primary target of MMV030084. PKG is
known to play essential roles in Plasmodium invasion of and egress from host
cells, matching MMV030084's activity profile. Resistance selections and gene
editing identified tyrosine kinase-like protein 3 as a low-level resistance
mediator for PKG inhibitors, while PKG itself never mutated under pressure. These
studies highlight PKG as a resistance-refractory antimalarial target throughout
the Plasmodium life cycle and promote MMV030084 as a promising Plasmodium
PKG-targeting chemotype.
