Vaccination has had great success in combating diseases, especially infectious
diseases. However, traditional vaccination strategies are ineffective for several
life-threatening diseases, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS),
tuberculosis, malaria, and cancer. Viral vaccine vectors represent a promising
strategy because they can efficiently deliver foreign genes and enhance antigen
presentation in vivo. However, several limitations, including pre-existing
immunity and packaging capacity, block the application of viral vectors.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been demonstrated as a new type of viral vector with
additional advantages. CMV could systematically elicit and maintain high
frequencies of effector memory T cells through the "memory inflation" mechanism. 
Studies have shown that CMV can be genetically modified to induce distinct
patterns of CD8+ T-cell responses, while some unconventional CD8+ T-cell
responses are rarely induced through conventional vaccine strategies. CMV has
been used as a vaccine vector to deliver many disease-specific antigens, and the 
efficacy of these vaccines was tested in different animal models. Promising
results demonstrated that the robust and unconventional T-cell responses elicited
by the CMV-based vaccine vector are essential to control these diseases. These
accumulated data and evidence strongly suggest that a CMV-based vaccine vector
represents a promising approach to develop novel prophylactic and therapeutic
vaccines against some epidemic pathogens and tumors.
