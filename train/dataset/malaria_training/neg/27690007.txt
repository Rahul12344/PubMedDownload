Diastereoisomers of quinidine and quinine are used to treat arrhythmia and
malaria, respectively. It has been reported that both drugs block the hERG (human
ether-a-go-go-related gene) potassium channel which is essential for myocardium
repolarization. Abnormality of repolarization increases risk of arrhythmia. The
aim of our research is to study and compare the impacts of quinidine and quinine 
on hERG. Results show that both drugs block the hERG channel, with quinine
14-fold less potent than quinidine. In addition, they presented distinct impacts 
on channel dynamics. The results imply their stereospecific block effect on the
hERG channel. However, F656C-hERG reversed this stereoselectivity. The mutation
decreases affinity of the two drugs with hERG, and quinine was more potent than
quinidine in F656C-hERG blockage. These data suggest that F656 residue
contributes to the stereoselective pocket for quinidine and quinine. Further
study demonstrates that both drugs do not change hERG protein levels. In rescue
experiments, we found that they exert no reverse effect on pentamidine- or
desipramine-induced hERG trafficking defect, although quinidine has been reported
to rescue trafficking-deficient pore mutation hERG G601S based on the interaction
with F656. Our research demonstrated stereoselective effects of quinidine and
quinine on the hERG channel, and this is the first study to explore their
reversal potency on drug-induced hERG deficiency.
