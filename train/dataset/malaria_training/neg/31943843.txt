Carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), and sulfur (S) atoms intrigue
as they are the foundation for amino acid (AA) composition and the folding and
functions of proteins and thus define and control the survival of a cell, the
smallest unit of life. Here, we calculated the proteomic atom distribution in
>1500 randomly selected species across the entire current phylogenetic tree and
identified uracil-5-methyltransferase (U5MTase) of the protozoan parasite
Plasmodium falciparum (Pf, strain Pf3D7), with a distinct atom and AA
distribution pattern. We determined its apicoplast location and in silico 3D
protein structure to refocus attention exclusively on U5MTase with tremendous
potential for therapeutic intervention in malaria. Around 300 million clinical
cases of malaria occur each year in tropical and subtropical regions of the
world, resulting in over one million deaths annually, placing malaria among the
most serious infectious diseases. Genomic and proteomic research of the clades of
parasites containing Pf is progressing slowly and the functions of most of the
∼5300 genes are still unknown. We applied a 'bottom-up' comparative proteomic
atomics analysis across the phylogenetic tree to visualize a protein molecule on 
its actual basis - i. e., its atomic level. We identified a protruding
Pf3D7-specific U5MTase, determined its 3D protein structure, and identified
potential inhibitory drug molecules through in silico drug screening that might
serve as possible remedies for the treatment of malaria. Besides, this
atomic-based proteome map provides a unique approach for the identification of
parasite-specific proteins that could be considered as novel therapeutic targets.
