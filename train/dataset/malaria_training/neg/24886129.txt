BACKGROUND: Malaria vector control in Sudan relies mainly on indoor residual
spraying (IRS) and the use of long lasting insecticide treated bed nets (LLINs). 
Monitoring insecticide resistance in the main Sudanese malaria vector, Anopheles 
arabiensis, is essential for planning and implementing an effective vector
control program in this country.
METHODS: WHO susceptibility tests were used to monitor resistance to insecticides
from all four WHO-approved classes of insecticide at four sentinel sites in
Gezira state over a three year period. Insecticide resistance mechanisms were
studied using PCR and microarray analyses.
RESULTS: WHO susceptibility tests showed that Anopheles arabiensis from all sites
were fully susceptible to bendiocarb and fenitrothion for the duration of the
study (2008-2011). However, resistance to DDT and pyrethroids was detected at
three sites, with strong seasonal variations evident at all sites. The 1014 F kdr
allele was significantly associated with resistance to pyrethroids and DDT
(P < 0.001) with extremely high effects sizes (OR > 7 in allelic tests). The
1014S allele was not detected in any of the populations tested. Microarray
analysis of the permethrin-resistant population of An. arabiensis from Wad Medani
identified a number of metabolic genes that were significantly over-transcribed
in the field-collected resistant samples when compared to the susceptible
Sudanese An. arabiensis Dongola strain. These included CYP6M2 and CYP6P3, two
genes previously implicated in pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles gambiae s.s,
and the epsilon-class glutathione-S-transferase, GSTe4.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that both target-site mechanisms and metabolic
mechanisms play an important role in conferring pyrethroid resistance in An.
arabiensis from Sudan. Identification in An. arabiensis of candidate loci that
have been implicated in the resistance phenotype in An. gambiae requires further 
investigation to confirm the role of these genes.
