The genome of the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum is extremely AT rich.
This bias toward a low GC content is a characteristic of several, but not all,
species within the genus Plasmodium. We compared 4283 orthologous pairs of
protein-coding sequences between Plasmodium falciparum and the less AT-biased
Plasmodium vivax. Our results indicate that the common ancestor of these two
species was also extremely AT rich. This means that, although there was a strong 
bias toward A+T during the early evolution of the ancestral Plasmodium lineage,
there was a subsequent reversal of this trend during the more recent evolution of
some species, such as P. vivax. Moreover, we show that not only is the P. vivax
genome losing its AT richness, it is actually gaining a very significant degree
of GC richness. This example illustrates the potential volatility of nucleotide
content during the course of molecular evolution. Such reversible fluxes in
nucleotide content within lineages could have important implications for
phylogenetic reconstruction based on molecular sequence data.
