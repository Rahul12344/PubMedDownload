Plasmodium falciparum has successfully developed resistance to almost all
currently used antimalarials. A single nucleotide polymorphism in the P.
falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt) gene at position 76
resulting in a change in coding from lysine to threonine (K76T) has been
implicated to be the corner stone of chloroquine resistance. Widespread
resistance to chloroquine in endemic regions led to its replacement with other
antimalarials. In some areas this replacement resulted in a reversion of the
mutant T76 allele to the wild-type K76 allele. This study was conducted to
determine the prevalence of the K76T mutation of the Pfcrt gene eight years after
the ban on chloroquine sales and use. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 6 
regional hospitals in Ghana. PCR-RFLP was used to analyse samples collected to
determine the prevalence of Pfcrt K76T mutation. Of the 1318 participants
recruited for this study, 246 were found to harbour the P. falciparum parasites, 
of which 60.98% (150/246) showed symptoms for malaria. The prevalence of the
Pfcrt T76 mutant allele was 58.54% (144/246) and that of the K76 wild-type allele
was 41.46% (102/246). No difference of statistical significance was observed in
the distribution of the alleles in the symptomatic and asymptomatic participants 
(P=0.632). No significant association was, again, observed between the alleles
and parasite density (P=0.314), as well as between the alleles and Hb levels of
the participants (P=0.254). Notwithstanding the decline in the prevalence of the 
Pfcrt T76 mutation since the antimalarial policy change in 2004, the 58.54%
prevalence recorded in this study is considered high after eight years of the
abolishment of chloroquine usage in Ghana. This is in contrast to findings from
other endemic areas where the mutant allele significantly reduced in the
population after a reduction chloroquine use.
