Most eukaryotic organisms including protozoans like Crithidia, Leishmania, and
Plasmodium encode a repertoire of equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs).
Using genomic sequencing data from Crithidia fasciculata, we discovered that this
organism contains multiple ENT genes of highly similar sequence to the previously
cloned and characterized adenosine transporter CfNT1: CfAT1 and CfNT3, and an
allele of CfAT1, named CfAT1.2. Characterization of CfAT1 shows that it is an
adenosine-only transporter, 87% identical to CfNT1 in protein sequence, with a
50-fold lower Km for adenosine. Site directed mutation of a key residue in
transmembrane domain 4 (TM4) in both CfNT1 and CfAT1 shows that lysine at this
position results in a high affinity phenotype, while threonine decreases
adenosine affinity in both transporters. These results show that C. fasciculata
has at least two adenosine transporters, and that as in other protozoan ENTs, a
lysine residue in TM4 plays a key role in ligand affinity.
