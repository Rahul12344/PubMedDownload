BACKGROUND: To reduce onward falciparum malaria transmission, the World Health
Organization recommends adding single low-dose (SLD) primaquine to
artemisinin-based combination treatment in low transmission areas. However,
uptake of this recommendation has been relatively slow given concerns about
whether individual risks justify potential community benefit. This study was
undertaken to generate comprehensive local data on the risk-benefit profile of
SLD primaquine deployment in a pre-elimination area in South Africa.
METHODS: This randomized, controlled open-label trial investigated adding a
single low primaquine dose on day 3 to standard artemether-lumefantrine treatment
for uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Efficacy, safety and tolerability of
artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine treatment were assessed on days 3, 7, 14, 
28 and 42. Lumefantrine concentrations were assayed from dried blood spot samples
collected on day 7.
RESULTS: Of 217 patients screened, 166 were enrolled with 140 randomized on day
3, 70 to each study arm (primaquine and no primaquine). No gametocytes were
detected by either microscopy or PCR in any of the follow-up samples collected
after randomization on day 3, precluding assessment of primaquine efficacy.
Prevalence of the CYP2D6*4, CYP2D6*10 and CYP2D6*17 mutant alleles was low with
allelic frequencies of 0.02, 0.11 and 0.16, respectively; none had the
CYP2D6*4/*4 variant associated with null activity. Among 172 RDT-positive
patients G6PD-genotyped, 24 (14%) carried the G6PD deficient (A-) variant. Median
haemoglobin concentrations were similar between treatment arms throughout
follow-up. A third of participants had a haemoglobin drop > 2 g/dL; this was not 
associated with primaquine treatment but may be associated with G6PD genotype
[52.9% (9/17) with A- genotype vs. 31% (36/116) with other genotypes
(p = 0.075)]. Day 7 lumefantrine concentrations and the number and nature of
adverse events were similar between study arms; only one serious adverse event
occurred (renal impairment in the no primaquine arm). The artemether-lumefantrine
PCR-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response rate was 100%, with 
only one re-infection found among the 128 patients who completed 42-day
follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Safety, tolerability, CYP2D6 and G6PD variant data from this study
support the deployment of the WHO-recommended SLD primaquine without G6PD testing
to advance malaria elimination in South African districts with low-intensity
residual transmission. Trial registration Pan African Clinical Trial Registry,
