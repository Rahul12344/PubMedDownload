The complexity of the Plasmodium parasite and its life cycle poses a challenge to
our understanding of the host immune response against malaria. Studying human
immune responses during natural and experimental Plasmodium infections can
enhance our understanding of malaria-protective immunity and inform the design of
disease-modifying adjunctive therapies and next-generation malaria vaccines.
Systems immunology can complement conventional approaches to facilitate our
understanding of the complex immune response to the highly dynamic malaria
parasite. In this review, recent studies that used systems-based approaches to
evaluate human immune responses during natural and experimental Plasmodium
falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections as well as during immunization with
candidate malaria vaccines are summarized and related to each other. The
potential for next-generation technologies to address the current limitations of 
systems-based studies of human malaria are discussed.
