BACKGROUND: The unexpected high proportion of submicroscopic malaria infections
in areas with low transmission intensity challenges the control and elimination
of malaria in the Americas. The current PCR-based assays present limitations as
most protocols still rely on amplification of few-copies target gene. Here, the
hypothesis was that amplification of different plasmodial targets-ribosomal (18S 
rRNA) and non-ribosomal multi-copy sequences (Pvr47 for Plasmodium vivax and
Pfr364 for Plasmodium falciparum)-could increase the chances of detecting
submicroscopic malaria infection.
METHODS: A non-ribosomal real-time PCR assay targeting Pvr47/Pfr364 (NR-qPCR) was
established and compared with three additional PCR protocols, two of them based
on 18S rRNA gene amplification (Nested-PCR and R-qPCR) and one based on
Pvr47/Pfr364 targets (NR-cPCR). The limit of detection of each PCR protocol, at
single and artificial mixed P. vivax/P. falciparum infections, was determined by 
end-point titration curves. Field samples from clinical (n = 110) and subclinical
(n = 324) malaria infections were used to evaluate the impact of using multiple
molecular targets to detect malaria infections.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that an association of ribosomal and
non-ribosomal targets did not increase sensitivity to detect submicroscopic
malaria infections. Despite of that, artificial mixed-malaria infections
demonstrated that the NR-qPCR was the most sensitive protocol to detect
low-levels of P. vivax/P. falciparum co-infections. Field studies confirmed that 
submicroscopic malaria represented a large proportion (up to 77%) of infections
among asymptomatic Amazonian residents, with a high proportion of infections
(~ 20%) identified only by the NR-qPCR.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a new species-specific non-ribosomal PCR assay
with potential to identify low-density P. vivax and P. falciparum infections. As 
the majority of subclinical infections was caused by P. vivax, the commonest form
of malaria in the Amazon area, future studies should investigate the potential of
Pvr47/Pfr364 to detect mixed-malaria infections in the field.
