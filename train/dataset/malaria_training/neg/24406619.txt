OBJECTIVE: Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a strong chondroprotective cytokine and
polymorphisms within this gene may be a risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA). We
aimed to investigate genotype and allele frequencies of IL-4 gene intron 3
variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism in patients with knee OA in
a Turkish population.
METHODS: The study included 202 patients with knee OA and 180 healthy controls.
Genomic DNA was isolated and IL-4 gene 70 bp VNTR polymorphism determined by
using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific primers followed by
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis.
RESULTS: Our result show that there was statistically significant difference
between knee OA patients and control group with respect to IL-4 genotype
distribution and allele frequencies (p=0.000, OR: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.10-0.41, OR:
0.22, 95% CI: 0.12-0.42, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that there is an association of IL-4 gene
intron 3 VNTR polymorphism with susceptibility of a person for development of
knee OA. As a result, IL-4 gene intron 3 VNTR polymorphism could be a genetic
marker in OA in a Turkish study population. This is the first association study
that evaluates the associations between IL-4 gene VNTR polymorphism and knee OA.
