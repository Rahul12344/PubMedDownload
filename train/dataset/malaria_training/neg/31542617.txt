BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Usnea diﬀ ;racta Vain. (U. diffracta) belonging to the Usnea
genus, is widely used as a folk medicine for the treatment of ulcer, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, malaria and so on. However, the antiatherogenic effect of U.
diffracta has not yet been reported. This study aims to investigate the
antiatherogenic effects of the ethanol extract of U. diffracta and its mechanism.
METHOD: A high fat diet and VD3 were used to establish the atherosclerotic rat
model, with 0.004 g/kg/d of simvastatin as a positive control, fed with 0.7, 1.4,
and 2.8 g/kg/d of Usnea ethanol extract for 21 days. The blood, liver, and aorta 
samples from each rat were collected after the last administration.
Pharmacodynamic effects were evaluated. The inflammation related factors, the
gene expressions of Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), myeloid differentiating factor
88 (MyD88), and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) were detected.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the model group, simvastatin and ethanol
extract of U. diffracta can significantly reduce the serum levels of triglyceride
(TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), Ca2+, AST, ALT, the liver
contents of total cholesterol (TC), TG, AI and liver index, as well as
significantly increase the contents of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C) both in serum and liver (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05). The serum level of ox-LDL
can be significantly reduced by simvastatin, low and medium U. diffracta ethanol 
extract doses (p < 0.01). In addition, simvastatin and low dosage of U. diffracta
ethanol extract can significantly reduce the liver content of LDL-C (p < 0.01).
U. diffracta ethanol extract shows a positive antiatherogenic effect.
Furthermore, the mechanism may be related to promoting the expression of serum
IL-10 and inhibition of TLR5/NF-κB signaling pathway.
