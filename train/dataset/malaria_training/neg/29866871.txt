Piperaquine is an important partner drug used in artemisinin-based combination
therapies (ACTs). An increase in the plasmepsin 2 and 3 gene copy numbers has
been associated with decreased susceptibility of Plasmodium falciparum to
piperaquine in Cambodia. Here, we developed a photo-induced electron transfer
real-time PCR (PET-PCR) assay to quantify the copy number of the P.
falciparumplasmepsin 2 gene (PfPM2) that can be used in countries where P.
falciparum is endemic to enhance molecular surveillance.
