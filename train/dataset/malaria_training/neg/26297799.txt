Deletion of the Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (pfhrp2) gene may 
affect the performance of PfHRP2-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Here we
investigated the genetic diversity of the pfhrp2 gene in clinical parasite
isolates collected in recent years from the China-Myanmar border area. Deletion
of pfhrp2 has been identified in 4 out of 97 parasite isolates. Sequencing of the
pfhrp2 exon2 from 67 isolates revealed a high level of genetic diversity in
pfhrp2, which is reflected in the presence of many repeat types and their
variants, as well as variable copy numbers and different arrangements of these
repeats in parasite isolates. In addition, we observed pfhrp3 deletion in three
of the four parasites harboring pfhrp2 deletion, suggesting of double deletions
of both genes in these three isolates. Analysis of two cases, which were P.
falciparum-positive by microscopy and PCR but failed by two PfHRP2-based RDTs,
did not find pfhrp2 deletion. Further correlational studies of pfhrp2
polymorphisms with detection sensitivity are needed to identify factors
influencing the performance of RDTs in malaria-endemic areas.
