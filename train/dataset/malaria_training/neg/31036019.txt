BACKGROUND: Europe and Italy were declared malaria free since the 1970s although 
the presence of competent vectors and the high number of yearly imported malaria 
cases make this disease a potential rising health issue. In September 2017, a
cryptic fatal case of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in the Province of Trento,
Italy, raised the concern of health authorities on the possible resurgence of
this disease in the Mediterranean Basin.
METHODS: An entomological surveillance by means of BG traps, CDC light traps and 
larval search was performed. Sites were chosen among urban and suburban
environments (e.g. private houses, public parks, schools, cemeteries, ecotone
urban/forest, farms), ranging from an altitude of 91 to 1332 m above sea level.
All the mosquitoes collected were morphologically identified and about half of
them (103; 49%) were confirmed with the sequencing analysis of the rRNA internal 
transcribed spacer 2 (ITS-2).
RESULTS: In the present study 287 sites were screened for the presence of
Anopheles spp. and 211 specimens were collected and identified. Hundred-eighteen 
individuals (56%) belonged to Anopheles plumbeus, 56 (26.5%) to Anopheles
maculipennis complex, 10 (4.7%) to Anopheles claviger and 27 were identified only
at genus level. This is the first record for the presence of An. plumbeus in the 
study area.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of Anopheles spp. mosquitoes in the Province of Trento,
Italy, has been updated with the occurrence of An. plumbeus. The risk of malaria 
endemicity in the area is to be considered very low, but urban and peri-urban
habitat may act as potential breeding sites for the presence of mosquito vectors 
and should be constantly monitored.
