In a recent report, the cellular receptor CD55 was identified as a molecule
essential for the invasion of human erythrocytes by Plasmodium falciparum, the
causal agent of the most severe form of malaria. As this invasion process
represents a critical step during infection with the parasite, it was
hypothesized that genetic variants in the gene could affect severe malaria (SM)
susceptibility. We performed high-resolution variant discovery of rare and common
genetic variants in the human CD55 gene. Association testing of these variants in
over 1700 SM cases and unaffected control individuals from the malaria-endemic
Ashanti Region in Ghana, West Africa, were performed on the basis of single
variants, combined rare variant analyses, and reconstructed haplotypes. A total
of 26 genetic variants were detected in coding and regulatory regions of CD55
Five variants were previously unknown. None of the single variants, rare
variants, or haplotypes showed evidence for association with SM or P. falciparum 
density. Here, we present the first comprehensive analysis of variation in the
CD55 gene in the context of SM and show that genetic variants present in a
Ghanaian study group appear not to influence susceptibility to the disease.
