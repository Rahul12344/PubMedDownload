Detection of sub-microscopic parasitemia is crucial for all malaria elimination
programs. PCR-based methods have proven to be sensitive, but two rounds of
amplification (nested PCR) are often needed to detect the presence of Plasmodium 
DNA. To simplify the detection process, we designed a nested PCR method whereby
only the primary PCR is required for the detection of the four major human
Plasmodium species. Primers designed for the detection of the fifth species,
Plasmodium knowlesi, were not included in this study due to the absence of
appropriate field samples. Compared to the standard 18S rDNA PCR method, our
cytochrome c oxidase III (cox3) method detected 10-50% more cases while
maintaining high sensitivities (1.00) for all four Plasmodium species in our
samples from Vanuatu (n=77) and Kenya (n=76). Improvement in detection efficiency
was more substantial for samples with sub-microscopic parasitemia (54%) than
those with observable parasitemia (10-16%). Our method will contribute to
improved malaria surveillance in low endemicity settings.
