BACKGROUND: There is a renewed effort to develop novel malaria control strategies
as even well-implemented existing malaria control tools may fail to block
transmission in some regions. Currently, transgenic implementations of the
sterile insect technique (SIT) such as the release of insects with a dominant
lethal, homing endonuclease genes, or flightless mosquitoes are in development.
These implementations involve the release of transgenic male mosquitoes whose
matings with wild females produce either no viable offspring or no female
offspring. As these technologies are all in their infancy, little is known about 
the relative efficiencies of the various implementations.
METHODS: This paper describes agent-based modelling of emerging and theoretical
implementations of transgenic SIT in Anopheles gambiae for the control of
malaria. It reports on female suppression as it is affected by the SIT
implementation, the number of released males, and competitiveness of released
males.
CONCLUSIONS: The simulation experiments suggest that a late-acting bisex lethal
gene is the most efficient of the four implementations we simulated. They
demonstrate 1) the relative impact of release size on a campaign's effectiveness 
2) late-acting genes are preferred because of their ability to exploit density
dependent larval mortality 3) late-acting bisex lethal genes achieve elimination 
before their female-killing counterparts.
