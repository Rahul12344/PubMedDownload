Charged, solvent-exposed residues at the entrance to the substrate binding site
(gatekeeper residues) produce electrostatic dipole interactions with approaching 
substrates, and control their access by a novel mechanism called "electrostatic
gatekeeper effect". This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that the nucleotide 
specificity can be engineered by altering the electrostatic properties of the
gatekeeper residues outside the binding site. Using Blastocystis succinyl-CoA
synthetase (SCS, EC 6.2.1.5), we demonstrated that the gatekeeper mutant (ED)
resulted in ATP-specific SCS to show high GTP specificity. Moreover, nucleotide
binding site mutant (LF) had no effect on GTP specificity and remained
ATP-specific. However, via combination of the gatekeeper mutant with the
nucleotide binding site mutant (ED+LF), a complete reversal of nucleotide
specificity was obtained with GTP, but no detectable activity was obtained with
ATP. This striking result of the combined mutant (ED+LF) was due to two changes; 
negatively charged gatekeeper residues (ED) favored GTP access, and nucleotide
binding site residues (LF) altered ATP binding, which was consistent with the
hypothesis of the "electrostatic gatekeeper effect". These results were further
supported by molecular modeling and simulation studies. Hence, it is imperative
to extend the strategy of the gatekeeper effect in a different range of crucial
enzymes (synthetases, kinases, and transferases) to engineer substrate
specificity for various industrial applications and substrate-based drug design.
