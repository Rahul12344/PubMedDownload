BACKGROUND: The genetic variation in the Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich
protein 2 (pfhrp2) gene that may compromise the use of pfhrp2-based rapid
diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the diagnosis of malaria was assessed in P.
falciparum isolates from Yemen.
METHODS: This study was conducted in Hodeidah and Al-Mahwit governorates, Yemen. 
A total of 622 individuals with fever were examined for malaria by CareStart
malaria HRP2-RDT and Giemsa-stained thin and thick blood films. The Pfhrp2 gene
was amplified and sequenced from 180 isolates, and subjected to amino acid repeat
types analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 188 (30.2%) participants were found positive for P.
falciparum by the RDT. Overall, 12 different amino acid repeat types were
identified in Yemeni isolates. Six repeat types were detected in all the isolates
(100%) namely types 1, 2, 6, 7, 10 and 12 while types 9 and 11 were not detected 
in any of the isolates. Moreover, the sensitivity and specificity of the used
PfHRP2-based RDTs were high (90.5% and 96.1%, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The present study provides data on the genetic variation within the
pfhrp2 gene, and its potential impact on the PfHRP2-based RDTs commonly used in
Yemen. CareStart Malaria HRP2-based RDT showed high sensitivity and specificity
in endemic areas of Yemen.
