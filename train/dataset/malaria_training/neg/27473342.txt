Over the past decade important advances have been made in the field of innate
immunity; however, our appreciation of the signaling pathways and molecules that 
participate in host immune responses to parasitic nematode infections lags behind
that of responses to microbial challenges. Here we have examined the regulation
and immune activity of Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling in the
model host Drosophila melanogaster upon infection with the nematode parasites
Heterorhabditis gerrardi and H. bacteriophora containing their mutualistic
bacteria Photorhabdus. We have found that the genes encoding the Activin and Bone
Morphogenic Protein (BMP) ligands Dawdle (Daw) and Decapentaplegic (Dpp) are
transcriptionally induced in flies responding to infection with the nematode
parasites, containing or lacking their associated bacteria. We also show that
deficient Daw or Dpp regulates the survival of D. melanogaster adults to the
pathogens, whereas inactivation of Daw reduces the persistence of the nematodes
in the mutant flies. These findings demonstrate a novel role for the TGF-β
signaling pathways in the host anti-nematode immune response. Understanding the
molecular mechanisms of host anti-nematode processes will potentially lead to the
development of novel means for the efficient control of parasitic nematodes.
