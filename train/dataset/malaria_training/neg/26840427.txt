Apicomplexan parasites replicate by several budding mechanisms with two
well-characterized examples being Toxoplasma endodyogeny and Plasmodium
schizogony. Completion of budding requires the tapering of the nascent daughter
buds toward the basal end, driven by contraction of the basal complex. This
contraction is not executed by any of the known cell division associated
contractile mechanisms and in order to reveal new components of the unusual basal
complex we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with its major scaffolding
protein, TgMORN1. Here we report on a conserved protein with a haloacid
dehalogenase (HAD) phosphatase domain, hereafter named HAD2a, identified by yeast
two-hybrid. HAD2a has demonstrated enzyme-activity in vitro, localizes to the
nascent daughter buds, and co-localizes with MORN1 to the basal complex during
its contraction. Conditional knockout of HAD2a in Toxoplasma interferes with
basal complex assembly, which leads to incomplete cytokinesis and conjoined
daughters that ultimately results in disrupted proliferation. In Plasmodium, we
further confirmed localization of the HAD2a ortholog to the basal complex toward 
the end of schizogony. In conclusion, our work highlights an essential role for
this HAD phosphatase across apicomplexan budding and suggests a regulatory
mechanism of differential phosphorylation on the structure and/or contractile
function of the basal complex.
