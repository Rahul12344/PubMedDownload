Despite efforts made over decades by the Peruvian government to eliminate
malaria, Plasmodium vivax remains a challenge for public health decision-makers
in the country. The uneven distribution of its incidence, plus its complex
pattern of dispersion, has made ineffective control measures based on global
information that lack the necessary detail to understand transmission fully. In
this sense, population genetic tools can complement current surveillance. This
study describes the genetic diversity and population structure from September
2012 to March 2015 in three geographically distant settlements, Cahuide (CAH),
Lupuna (LUP) and Santa Emilia (STE), located in the Peruvian Amazon. A total 777 
P. vivax mono-infections, out of 3264, were genotyped. Among study areas, LUP
showed 19.7% of polyclonal infections, and its genetic diversity (Hexp) was
0.544. Temporal analysis showed a significant increment of polyclonal infections 
and Hexp, and the introduction and persistence of a new parasite population since
March 2013. In STE, 40.1% of infections were polyclonal, with Hexp = 0.596. The
presence of four genetic clusters without signals of clonal expansion and
infections with lower parasite densities compared against the other two areas
were also found. At least four parasite populations were present in CAH in 2012, 
where, after June 2014, malaria cases decreased from 213 to 61, concomitant with 
a decrease in polyclonal infections (from 0.286 to 0.18), and expectedly variable
Hexp. Strong signals of gene flow were present in the study areas and wide
geographic distribution of highly diverse parasite populations were found. This
study suggests that movement of malaria parasites by human reservoirs connects
geographically distant malaria transmission areas in the Peruvian Amazon. The
maintenance of high levels of parasite genetic diversity through human mobility
is a critical barrier to malaria elimination in this region.
