Background and Objectives. Malaria infection, caused by Plasmodium falciparum, is
the most lethal and frequently culminates in severe clinical complications.
Interleukin-22 (IL-22) has been implicated in several diseases including malaria.
The objective of this study was to investigate the role of IL-22 gene
polymorphisms in P. falciparum infection. Material and Methods. Ten
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs976748, rs1179246, rs2046068,
rs1182844, rs2227508, rs2227513, rs2227478, rs2227481, rs2227491, and rs2227483, 
of IL-22 gene were genotyped through PCR-based assays of 250 P. falciparum
infection. IL-22 gene promoter activity.Results: We found that the rs2227481 TT
genotype (odds ratio 0.254, confidence interval = 0.097-0.663, P. P. falciparum
infection. P. P. P. P.
Conclusion: The study suggests that IL-22 polymorphisms in rs2227481 and
rs2227483 could contribute to protection against P. falciparum infection. IL-22
gene promoter activity.
