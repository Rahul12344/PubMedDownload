INTRODUCTION: Although there have been several phylogenetic studies on Plasmodium
knowlesi (P. knowlesi), only cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COX1) gene analysis 
has shown some geographical differentiation between the isolates of different
countries.
METHODS: Phylogenetic analysis of locally acquired P. knowlesi infections, based 
on circumsporozoite, small subunit ribosomal ribonucleic acid (SSU rRNA),
merozoite surface protein 1 and COX1 gene targets, was performed. The results
were compared with the published sequences of regional isolates from Malaysia and
Thailand.
RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis of the circumsporozoite, SSU rRNA and merozoite
surface protein 1 gene sequences for regional P. knowlesi isolates showed no
obvious differentiation that could be attributed to their geographical origin.
However, COX1 gene analysis showed that it was possible to differentiate between 
Singapore-acquired P. knowlesi infections and P. knowlesi infections from
Peninsular Malaysia and Sarawak, Borneo, Malaysia.
CONCLUSION: The ability to differentiate between locally acquired P. knowlesi
infections and imported P. knowlesi infections has important utility for the
monitoring of P. knowlesi malaria control programmes in Singapore.
