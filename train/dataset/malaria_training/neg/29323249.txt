Plasmodium gametocytes are the sexual forms of the malaria parasite essential for
transmission to mosquitoes. To better understand how gametocytes differ from
asexual blood-stage parasites, we performed a systematic analysis of available
'omics data for P. falciparum and other Plasmodium species. 18 transcriptomic and
proteomic data sets were evaluated for the presence of curated "gold standards"
of 41 gametocyte-specific versus 46 non-gametocyte genes and integrated using
Bayesian probabilities, resulting in gametocyte-specificity scores for all P.
falciparum genes. To illustrate the utility of the gametocyte score, we explored 
newly predicted gametocyte-specific genes as potential biomarkers of gametocyte
carriage and exposure. We analyzed the humoral immune response in field samples
against 30 novel gametocyte-specific antigens and found five antigens to be
differentially recognized by gametocyte carriers as compared to malaria-infected 
individuals without detectable gametocytes. We also validated the
gametocyte-specificity of 15 identified gametocyte transcripts on culture
material and samples from naturally infected individuals, resulting in eight
transcripts that were >1000-fold higher expressed in gametocytes compared to
asexual parasites and whose transcript abundance allowed gametocyte detection in 
naturally infected individuals. Our integrated genome-wide gametocyte-specificity
scores provide a comprehensive resource to identify targets and monitor P.
falciparum gametocytemia.
