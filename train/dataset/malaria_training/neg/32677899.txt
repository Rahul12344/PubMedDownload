BACKGROUND: Imported falciparum malaria from Africa has become a key public
health challenge in Guizhou Province since 2012. Understanding the polymorphisms 
of molecular markers of drug resistance can guide selection of antimalarial drugs
for the treatment of malaria. This study was aimed to analyze the polymorphisms
of pfcrt, pfmdr1, and K13-propeller among imported falciparum malaria cases in
Guizhou Province, China.
METHOD: Fifty-five imported falciparum malaria cases in Guizhou Province during
2012-2016 were included in this study. Their demographic information and filter
paper blood samples were collected. Genomic DNA of Plasmodium falciparum was
extracted from the blood samples, and polymorphisms of pfcrt, pfmdr1, and
K13-propeller were analyzed with nested PCR amplification followed by sequencing.
Data were analyzed with the SPSS17.0 software.
RESULTS: The prevalence of pfcrt K76T, pfmdr1 N86Y, and pfmdr1 Y184F mutation was
56.6, 22.2, and 72.2%, respectively, in imported falciparum malaria cases in
Guizhou Province. We detected two mutant haplotypes of pfcrt, IET and MNT, with
IET being more commonly found (54.7%), and five mutant haplotypes of pfmdr1, of
which NFD was the most frequent (53.7%). There were totally 10 combined
haplotypes of pfcrt and pfmdr1, of which the haplotype IETNFD possessed a
predominance of 28.8%. In addition, three nonsynonymous mutations (S459T, C469F, 
and V692L) and two synonymous mutations (R471R and V589V) were detected in
K13-propeller, all having prevalence less than 6.0%. In particular, a candidate
K13 resistance mutation, C469F, was identified for the first time from Democratic
Republic of the Congo with the prevalence of 2.0%.
CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of IET haplotype of pfcrt and NFD haplotype of
pfmdr1 suggests the presence of chloroquine, artemether/lumefantrine, and
dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine resistance in these cases. Therefore cautions
should be made to artemisinin therapy for P. falciparum in Africa. Continuous
monitoring of anti-malarial drug efficacy in imported malaria cases is helpful
for optimizing antimalarial drug therapy in Guizhou Province, China.
