We previously reported that melatonin modulates the Plasmodium falciparum
erythrocytic cycle by increasing schizont stage population as well as diminishing
ring stage population. In addition, the importance of calcium and cAMP in
melatonin signaling pathway in P. falciparum was also demonstrated. Nevertheless,
the molecular effectors of the indoleamine signaling pathway remain elusive. We
now demonstrate by real-time PCR that melatonin treatment up-regulates genes
related to ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) components and that luzindole, a
melatonin receptor antagonist, inhibits UPS transcription modulation. We also
show that protein kinase PfPK7, a P. falciparum orphan kinase, plays a crucial
role in the melatonin transduction pathway, since following melatonin treatment
of P. falciparum parasites where pfpk7 gene is disrupted (pfpk7(-) parasites) (i)
the ratio of asexual stages remain unchanged, (ii) the increase in cytoplasmatic 
calcium in response to melatonin was strongly diminished and (iii) up-regulation 
of UPS genes did not occur. The wild-type melatonin-induced alterations in cell
cycle features, calcium rise and UPS gene transcription were restored by
re-introduction of a functional copy of the pfpk7 gene in the pfpk7(-) parasites.
