BACKGROUND: Thirty-one glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins of
Plasmodium vivax, merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1), MSP1 paralogue, MSP4, MSP5,
MSP8, and MSP10 have been reported from homologs of Plasmodium falciparum by gene
annotation with bioinformatics tools. These GPI-anchored proteins contain two
epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains at its C-terminus. Here, P. vivax
merozoite surface protein 8 (PvMSP8) are considered as potential targets of
protective immunity.
METHODS: Recombinant PvMSP8 (rPvMSP8) was expressed, purified, and used for the
assessment of humoral and cellular immune responses in P. vivax-infected patients
and immune mice. Moreover, the target epitope of ant-PvMSP8 antibodies and
subcellular localization of PvMSP8 was also determined.
RESULTS: The rPvMSP8 was successfully expressed and purified as soluble form
as ~55 kDa. PvMSP8 was localized to the outer circle of pigments associated with 
the food vacuole. The rPvMSP8 protein had a high antigenicity (73.2% in
sensitivity and 96.2% in specificity) in patients infected with P. vivax. IgG2
antibody subtype was the predominantly responses to this antigen. Antibody
response to PvMSP8 increased up to day 7 and after that slightly decreased within
a month. The longevity of anti-PvMSP8 antibody was stably sustained up to 12-year
recovery patient samples. Most anti-PvMSP8 antibodies recognized two epitopes
that were located outside the C-terminal EGF-like domain. The cellular immune
response in P. vivax-exposed individuals produced high levels of IFN-γ and IL-10 
upon PvMSP8 antigen stimulation in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: All data in this study suggest that PvMSP8 antigen has a potential
to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in patients with P. vivax
infection. The subcellular localization of PvMSP8 confirmed that it was
associated with the parasite food vacuole in blood-stage parasites. A further
characterization of this protein will be useful for blood stage P. vivax vaccine 
development.
