The malaria parasite has a complex lifecycle, including several events of
differentiation and stage progression, while actively evading immunity in both
its mosquito and human hosts. Important parasite gene expression and regulation
during these events remain hidden in rare populations of cells. Here, we combine 
a capillary-based platform for cell isolation with single-cell RNA-sequencing to 
transcriptionally profile 165 single infected red blood cells (iRBCs) during the 
intra-erythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC). Unbiased analyses of single-cell
data grouped the cells into eight transcriptional states during IDC.
Interestingly, we uncovered a gene signature from the single iRBC analyses that
can successfully discriminate between developing asexual and sexual stage
parasites at cellular resolution, and we verify five, previously undefined,
gametocyte stage specific genes. Moreover, we show the capacity of detecting
expressed genes from the variable gene families in single parasites, despite the 
sparse nature of data. In total, the single parasite transcriptomics holds
promise for molecular dissection of rare parasite phenotypes throughout the
malaria lifecycle.
