The FK506-binding protein of Plasmodium knowlesi (Pk-FKBP35) is considerably a
viable antimalarial drug target, which belongs to the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans
isomerase (PPIase) protein family member. Structurally, this protein consists of 
an N-terminal FK506-binding domain (FKBD) and a C-terminal tetratricopeptide
repeat domain (TPRD). This study aims to decipher functional properties of these 
domains as a platform for development of novel antimalarial drugs. Accordingly,
full-length Pk-FKBP35 as well as its isolated domains, Pk-FKBD and Pk-TPRD were
overexpressed, purified, and characterized. The results showed that catalytic
PPIase activity was confined to the full-length Pk-FKBP35 and Pk-FKBD, suggesting
that the catalytic activity is structurally regulated by the FKBD. Meanwhile,
oligomerization analysis revealed that Pk-TPRD is essential for dimerization.
Asp55, Arg60, Trp77 and Phe117 in the Pk-FKBD were considerably important for
catalysis as underlined by significant reduction of PPIase activity upon
mutations at these residues. Further, inhibition activity of Pk-FKBP35 towards
calcineurin phosphatase activity revealed that the presence of FKBD is essential 
for the inhibitory property, while TPRD may be important for efficient binding to
calcineurin. We then discussed possible roles of FKBP35 in Plasmodium cells and
proposed mechanisms by which the immunosuppressive drug, FK506, interacts with
the protein.
