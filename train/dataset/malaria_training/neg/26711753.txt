Our recent report of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine failure to treat Plasmodium
falciparum infections in Cambodia adds new urgency to the search for alternative 
treatments. Despite dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine failure, and higher
piperaquine 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) following reanalysis than those
previously reported, P. falciparum remained sensitive to atovaquone (ATQ) in
vitro. There were no point mutations in the P. falciparum cytochrome b ATQ
resistance gene. Mefloquine, artemisinin, chloroquine, and quinine IC50s remained
comparable to those from other recent reports. Atovaquone-proguanil may be a
useful stopgap but remains susceptible to developing resistance when used as
blood-stage therapy.
