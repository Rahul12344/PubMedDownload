BACKGROUND: Encoded by the var gene family, highly variable Plasmodium falciparum
erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfEMP1) proteins mediate tissue-specific
cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes, resulting in immune evasion and severe
malaria disease. Sequencing and assembling the 40-60 var gene complement for
individual infections has been notoriously difficult, impeding molecular
epidemiological studies and the assessment of particular var elements as subunit 
vaccine candidates.
METHODS: We developed and validated a novel algorithm, Exon-Targeted Hybrid
Assembly (ETHA), to perform targeted assembly of var gene sequences, based on a
combination of Pacific Biosciences and Illumina data.
RESULTS: Using ETHA, we characterized the repertoire of var genes in 12 samples
from uncomplicated malaria infections in children from a single Malian village
and showed them to be as genetically diverse as vars from isolates from around
the globe. The gene var2csa, a member of the var family associated with placental
malaria pathogenesis, was present in each genome, as were vars previously
associated with severe malaria.
CONCLUSION: ETHA, a tool to discover novel var sequences from clinical samples,
will aid the understanding of malaria pathogenesis and inform the design of
malaria vaccines based on PfEMP1. ETHA is available at:
