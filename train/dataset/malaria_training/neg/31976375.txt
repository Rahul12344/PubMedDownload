Background: Malaria control heavily relies on insecticide-based interventions
against mosquito vectors. However, the increasing spread of insecticide
resistance is a major threat. The extent to which such resistance, notably
metabolic resistance, interferes with the development of the Plasmodium parasite 
and its impact on overall malaria transmission remains poorly characterized.
Here, we investigated whether glutathione S-transferase-based resistance could
influence Plasmodium falciparum development in Anopheles funestus. Methods:
Anopheles funestus females were infected with P. falciparum gametocytes and
midguts were dissected at day 7 post infection for detection/quantification of
oocysts. Infection parameters were compared between individual with different
L119F-GSTe2 genotypes, and the polymorphism of the GSTe2 gene was analyzed in
infected and uninfected mosquito groups. Results: Overall, 403 mosquitoes were
dissected and genotyped. The frequency of the L119F-GSTe2 resistance allele was
significantly higher in non-infected (55.88%) compared to infected (40.99%)
mosquitoes (Fisher's exact test, P<0.0001). Prevalence of infection was
significantly higher in heterozygous and homozygous susceptible genotypes
(P<0.001). However, homozygous resistant and heterozygous mosquitoes exhibited
significantly higher infection intensity (P<0.01). No association was observed
between the GSTe2 polymorphism and the infection status of mosquitoes.
Conclusion: Altogether, these results suggest that GSTe2-based metabolic
resistance may affect the vectorial competence of resistant An. funestus
mosquitoes to P. falciparum infection, by increasing its permissiveness to
Plasmodium infection.
