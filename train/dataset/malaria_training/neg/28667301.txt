Artemisinins are the current mainstay of malaria chemotherapy. Their exact mode
of action is an ongoing matter of debate, and several factors have recently been 
reported to affect an early stage of artemisinin resistance of the most important
human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Here, we identified a locus on
chromosome 7 that affects the artemisinin susceptibility of P. falciparum in a
quantitative trait locus analysis of a genetic cross between strains 7G8 and GB4.
This locus includes the peroxiredoxin gene PFAOP. However, steady-state kinetic
data with recombinant PfAOP do not support a direct interaction between this
peroxidase and the endoperoxide artemisinin. Furthermore, neither the
overexpression nor the deletion of the encoding gene affected the IC50 values for
artemisinin or the oxidants diamide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide. Thus, PfAOP is 
dispensable for blood stage parasite survival, and the correlation between the
artemisinin susceptibility and chromosome 7 is probably based on another gene
within the identified locus.
