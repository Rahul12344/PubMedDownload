In this study, we characterized the Puf family gene member Puf3 in the malaria
parasites Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium yoelii Secondary structure
prediction suggested that the RNA-binding domains of the Puf3 proteins consisted 
of 11 pumilio repeats that were similar to those in the human Puf-A (also known
as PUM3) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Puf6 proteins, which are involved in
ribosome biogenesis. Neither P. falciparum (Pf)Puf3 nor P. yoelii (Py)Puf3 could 
be genetically disrupted, suggesting they may be essential for the
intraerythrocytic developmental cycle. Cellular fractionation of PfPuf3 in the
asexual stages revealed preferential partitioning to the nuclear fraction,
consistent with nuclear localization of PfPuf3::GFP and PyPuf3::GFP as detected
by immunofluorescence. Furthermore, PfPuf3 colocalized with the nucleolar marker 
PfNop1, demonstrating that PfPuf3 is a nucleolar protein in the asexual stages.
We found, however, that PyPuf3 changed its localization from being nucleolar to
being present in cytosolic puncta in the mosquito and liver stages, which may
reflect alternative functions in these stages. Affinity purification of molecules
that associated with a PTP-tagged variant of PfPuf3 revealed 31 proteins
associated with the 60S ribosome, and an enrichment of 28S rRNA and internal
transcribed spacer 2 sequences. Taken together, these results suggest an
essential function for PfPuf3 in ribosomal biogenesis.
