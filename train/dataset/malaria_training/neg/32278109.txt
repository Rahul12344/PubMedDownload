OBJECTIVES: Invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis is a significant
health concern globally, but our knowledge of the prevailing serogroups,
antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, and genetics of N. meningitidis in
Southeast Asia is limited. Chloramphenicol resistance in N. meningitidis has
rarely been reported, but was first described in isolates from Vietnam in 1998.
We aimed to characterise eight chloramphenicol resistant meningococcal isolates
collected between 2007 and 2018 from diagnostic microbiology laboratories in
Cambodia, Thailand and the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos).
METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing was used to generate genome sequences from 18
meningococcal isolates including the eight chloramphenicol resistant isolates. We
identified antimicrobial resistance genes present in these strains, and examined 
the phylogenetic relationships between strains.
RESULTS: The eight resistant strains all contain the same chloramphenicol
resistance gene first described in 1998, and are closely related to each other.
Strains resistant to penicillin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin were also
observed, including a chloramphenicol-resistant strain which has acquired
penicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that chloramphenicol-resistant N. meningitidis
is more widespread than previously thought, and that the previously-identified
resistant lineage is now found in multiple countries in Southeast Asia.
