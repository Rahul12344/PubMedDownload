OBJECTIVE: Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by
Th1 cells and macrophages. The rationale of this study was to examine and
validate possible contributions of IL-10 promoter polymorphisms in sub-Saharan
Africa in children infected with either Plasmodium falciparum or Schistosoma
haematobium and in children co-infected with both parasites.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 309 Nigerian children aged 4-15 years were
recruited. The study group consisted of individuals infected either with P.
falciparum (n = 76) or S. haematobium (n = 94) in mono-infections, a group of
children co-infected with both P. falciparum and S. haematobium (n = 62) and
matched healthy controls (n = 77). The IL-10 promoter polymorphisms -1082G/A,
-819C/T and -592C/A were genotyped by direct sequencing.
RESULTS: The frequencies of the IL-10 -1082GG genotype, the -1082G allele and
haplotype GCC (positions -1082, -819 and -592) were higher in children infected
with P. falciparum than in healthy controls, indicating that the -1082GG genotype
and the -1082G allele and the GCC haplotype are associated with increased
susceptibility to malaria infection (OR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.2-10.8, P = 0.02; OR = 
2.5, 95% CI = 1.1-3.4, P = 0.02; OR = 3.8, 95% CI = 2.0-7.2, P = 0.0001,
respectively). Children with the -1082GG genotype had a higher parasitaemia than 
children with the -1082AA or -1082AG genotypes (P = 0.0017). Haplotype GCC
occurred more frequently in children infected with S. haematobium, while
haplotype GTA was less frequent than in controls (OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.2-4.4, P =
0.017 and OR = 0.1, 95% CI = 0.02-0.5, P = 0.0004, respectively). No differences 
in the frequencies of IL-10 promoter polymorphisms were observed between children
with P. falciparum-S. haematobium co-infections and healthy controls.
CONCLUSION: Although IL-10 promoter polymorphisms are not associated with P.
falciparum and S. haematobium co-infection, variant -1082G/A and haplotype GCC
are associated with malaria, whereas the IL-10 haplotypes GCC and GTA are
associated with schistosomiasis.
