Export of most malaria proteins into the erythrocyte cytosol requires the
Plasmodium translocon of exported proteins (PTEX) and a cleavable Plasmodium
export element (PEXEL). In contrast, the contribution of PTEX in the liver stages
and export of liver stage proteins is unknown. Here, using the FLP/FRT
conditional mutatagenesis system, we generate transgenic Plasmodium berghei
parasites deficient in EXP2, the putative pore-forming component of PTEX. Our
data reveal that EXP2 is important for parasite growth in the liver and critical 
for parasite transition to the blood, with parasites impaired in their ability to
generate a patent blood-stage infection. Surprisingly, whilst parasites
expressing a functional PTEX machinery can efficiently export a PEXEL-bearing GFP
reporter into the erythrocyte cytosol during a blood stage infection, this same
reporter aggregates in large accumulations within the confines of the
parasitophorous vacuole membrane during hepatocyte growth. Notably HSP101, the
putative molecular motor of PTEX, could not be detected during the early liver
stages of infection, which may explain why direct protein translocation of this
soluble PEXEL-bearing reporter or indeed native PEXEL proteins into the
hepatocyte cytosol has not been observed. This suggests that PTEX function may
not be conserved between the blood and liver stages of malaria infection.
