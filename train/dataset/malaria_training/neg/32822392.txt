Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have been recommended by the World
Health Organization (WHO) as first-line treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium
falciparum (P. falciparum) malaria since 2005 in Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) and a regular surveillance of the ACT efficacy is required to ensure the
treatment effectiveness. Mutations in the propeller domain of the pfk13 gene were
identified as molecular markers of artemisinin resistance (ART-R). This study
investigated the pfk13-propeller gene polymorphism in clinical isolates of P.
falciparum collected in the DRC. In 2017, ten geographical sites across DRC were 
selected for a cross-sectional study that was conducted first in Kinshasa from
January to March, then in the nine other sites from September to December. Dried 
blood samples were collected from patients attending health centers for fever
where diagnosis of Malaria was first made by rapid diagnostic test (RDT)
available on site (SD Bioline malaria Ag Pf or CareStart Malaria Pf) or by thick 
blood smear and then confirmed by a P. falciparum real-time PCR assay. A
pfk13-propeller segment containing a fragment that codes for amino acids at
positions 427-595 was amplified by conventional PCR before sequencing. In total, 
1070 patients were enrolled in the study. Real-time PCR performed confirmed the
initial diagnosis of P. falciparum infection in 806 samples (75.3%; 95% CI:
72.6%- 77.9%). Of the 717 successfully sequenced P. falciparum isolates, 710
(99.0%; 95% CI: 97.9% - 99.6) were wild-type genotypes and 7 (1.0%; 95% CI: 0.4% 
- 2.1%) carried non-synonymous (NS) mutations in pfk13-propeller including 2
mutations (A578S and V534A) previously detected and 2 other (M472I and A569T) not
yet detected in the DRC. Mutations associated with ART-R in Southeast Asia were
not observed in DRC. However, the presence of other mutations in pfk13-propeller 
gene calls for further investigations to assess their implication in drug
resistance.
