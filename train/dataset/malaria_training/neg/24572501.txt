Sequencing data from Plasmodium ovale genotypes co-circulating in multiple
countries support the hypothesis that P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri are
2 separate species. We conducted a multicenter, retrospective, comparative study 
in Spain of 21 patients who had imported P. ovale curtisi infections and 14 who
had imported P. ovale wallikeri infections confirmed by PCR and gene sequencing
during June 2005-December 2011. The only significant finding was more severe
thrombocytopenia among patients with P. ovale wallikeri infection than among
those with P. ovale curtisi infection (p = 0.031). However, we also found
nonsignificant trends showing that patients with P. ovale wallikeri infection had
shorter time from arrival in Spain to onset of symptoms, lower level of albumin, 
higher median maximum core temperature, and more markers of hemolysis than did
those with P. ovale curtisi infection. Larger, prospective studies are needed to 
confirm these findings.
