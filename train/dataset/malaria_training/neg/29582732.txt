Data on prevalence of antimalarial molecular resistance markers in pregnant women
in Ghana is scarce. Prevalence of single nucleotide polymorphisms/haplotypes in
the Pfcrt, Pfmdr1, Pfdhfr, and Pfdhps genes was assessed in a cross-sectional
study involving 200 pregnant women. Almost 90% of infections were wild type at
the Pfcrt gene whereas the Pfmdr1 NFD mutant haplotype occurred in 43% of
samples. Prevalence of Pfdhfr/Pfdhps quadruple mutation was 92.6% whereas
Pfdfr/Pfdhps quintuple mutation with K540E was not observed. The study provides
important updates of antimalarial resistance markers in Ghanaian pregnant women
and suggests increased tolerance to one of the first-line treatment options in
Ghana: artemether-lumefantrine. The data support the view that
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is still efficacious for intermittent preventive
treatment in Ghana, but the impact of increased doses on selection of mutations
needs to be assessed. Continuing the surveillance of resistance markers is
important to inform changes in antimalarial drug policy in pregnancy.
