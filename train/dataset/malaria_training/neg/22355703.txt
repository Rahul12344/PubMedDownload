Accuracy of aminoacylation is dependent on maintaining fidelity during attachment
of amino acids to cognate tRNAs. Cis- and trans-editing protein factors impose
quality control during protein translation, and 8 of 36 Plasmodium falciparum
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) assemblies contain canonical putative editing
modules. Based on expression and localization profiles of these 8 aaRSs, we
propose an asymmetric distribution between the parasite cytoplasm and its
apicoplast of putative editing-domain containing aaRSs. We also show that the
single copy alanyl- and threonyl-tRNA synthetases are dually targeted to parasite
cytoplasm and apicoplast. This bipolar presence of two unique synthetases
presents opportunity for inhibitor targeting their aminoacylation and editing
activities in twin parasite compartments. We used this approach to identify
specific inhibitors against the alanyl- and threonyl-tRNA synthetases. Further
development of such inhibitors may lead to anti-parasitics which simultaneously
block protein translation in two key parasite organelles, a strategy of wider
applicability for pathogen control.
