The coexistence of multiple independently circulating strains in pathogen
populations that undergo sexual recombination is a central question of
epidemiology with profound implications for control. An agent-based model is
developed that extends earlier 'strain theory' by addressing the var gene family 
of Plasmodium falciparum. The model explicitly considers the extensive diversity 
of multi-copy genes that undergo antigenic variation via sequential, mutually
exclusive expression. It tracks the dynamics of all unique var repertoires in a
population of hosts, and shows that even under high levels of sexual
recombination, strain competition mediated through cross-immunity structures the 
parasite population into a subset of coexisting dominant repertoires of var genes
whose degree of antigenic overlap depends on transmission intensity. Empirical
comparison of patterns of genetic variation at antigenic and neutral sites
supports this role for immune selection in structuring parasite
diversity.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00093.001.
