Some of the most crucial phenotypic aspects of parasites, such as an
antigen-coated surface, parasite sexual differentiation, virulence, and drug
resistance, rely on adaptive plasticity and/or stochastic events. At a population
level, cell to cell variability represents an avenue for rapid response to
drastic changes in the environment. Single cell approaches can be used to unravel
the different strategies used by parasites to survive in the context of regulated
transcriptional control (apicomplexa) or in its absence (kinetoplastids).
