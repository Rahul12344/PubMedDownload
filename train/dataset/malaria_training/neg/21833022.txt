Previously, we have shown that pyruvate kinase, liver and red cell isoform (PKLR)
deficiency protects mice in vivo against blood-stage malaria, and observed that
reduced PKLR function protects human erythrocytes against Plasmodium falciparum
replication ex vivo. Here, we have sequenced the human PKLR gene in 387
individuals from malaria-endemic and other regions in order to assess genetic
variability in different geographical regions and ethnic groups. Rich genetic
diversity was detected in PKLR, including 59 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 
several loss-of-function variants (frequency 1.5%). Haplotype distribution and
allele frequency varied considerably with geography. Neutrality testing suggested
positive selection of the genein the sub-Saharan African and Pakistan
populations. It is possible that such positive selection involves the malarial
parasite.
