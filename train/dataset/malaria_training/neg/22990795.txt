Exoerythrocytic Plasmodium parasites infect hepatocytes and develop to huge
multinucleated schizonts inside a parasitophorous vacuole. Finally, thousands of 
merozoites are formed and released into the host cell cytoplasm by complete
disintegration of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. This, in turn, results in
death and detachment of the infected hepatocyte, followed by the formation of
merosomes. The fast growth of the parasite and host cell detachment are hallmarks
of liver stage development and can easily be monitored. Here, we describe how to 
translate these observations into assays for characterizing parasite development.
Additionally, other recently introduced techniques and tools to analyze and
manipulate liver stage parasites are also discussed.
