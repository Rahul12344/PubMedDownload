The molecular pathways controlling gender are highly variable and have been
identified in only a few nonmammalian model species. In many insects, maleness is
conferred by a Y chromosome-linked M factor of unknown nature. We have isolated
and characterized a gene, Yob, for the M factor in the malaria mosquito Anopheles
gambiae Yob, activated at the beginning of zygotic transcription and expressed
throughout a male's life, controls male-specific splicing of the doublesex gene. 
Silencing embryonic Yob expression is male-lethal, whereas ectopic embryonic
delivery of Yob transcripts yields male-only broods. This female-killing property
may be an invaluable tool for creation of conditional male-only transgenic
Anopheles strains for malaria control programs.
