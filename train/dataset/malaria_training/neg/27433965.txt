Infections of humans with the zoonotic simian malaria parasite Plasmodium
knowlesi occur throughout Southeast Asia, although most cases have occurred in
Malaysia, where P. knowlesi is now the dominant malaria species. This apparently 
skewed distribution prompted an investigation of the phylogeography of this
parasite in 2 geographically separated regions of Malaysia, Peninsular Malaysia
and Malaysian Borneo. We investigated samples collected from humans and macaques 
in these regions. Haplotype network analyses of sequences from 2 P. knowlesi
genes, type A small subunit ribosomal 18S RNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I,
showed 2 genetically distinct divergent clusters, 1 from each of the 2 regions of
Malaysia. We propose that these parasites represent 2 distinct P. knowlesi types 
that independently became zoonotic. These types would have evolved after the
sea-level rise at the end of the last ice age, which separated Malaysian Borneo
from Peninsular Malaysia.
