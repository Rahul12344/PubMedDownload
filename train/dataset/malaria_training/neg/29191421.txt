The p23 proteins are small acidic proteins that aid the functional cycle of the
Hsp90 molecular chaperone. Such co-chaperone acts by temporarily inhibiting the
ATPase activity of Hsp90 and exhibits intrinsic chaperone activity, suggesting
independent roles. A search for p23 in the Plasmodium falciparum genome led to
the identification of two putative proteins showing 13% identity to each other
and approximately 20% identity to human p23. To understand the presence of two
p23 proteins in this organism, we generated recombinant p23 proteins (Pfp23A and 
Pfp23B) and investigated their structure and function. The proteins presented
some similarities and dissimilarities in structural contents and showed different
chemical and thermal stabilities, with Pfp23A being more stable than Pfp23B,
suggesting that these proteins may present different functions in this organism. 
Both Pfp23 proteins behaved as elongated monomers in solution and were capable of
preventing the thermal-induced aggregation of model client proteins with
different efficiencies. Finally, the Pfp23 proteins inhibited the ATPase activity
of recombinant P. falciparum Hsp90 (PfHsp90). These results validate the studied 
proteins as p23 proteins and co-chaperones of PfHsp90.
