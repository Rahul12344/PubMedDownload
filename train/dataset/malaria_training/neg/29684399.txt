The RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 has applied as an efficient gene-editing method 
in malaria parasite Plasmodium. However, the size (4.2 kb) of the commonly used
Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) limits its utility for genome editing
in the parasites only introduced with cas9 plasmid. To establish the endogenous
and constitutive expression of Cas9 protein in the rodent malaria parasite P.
yoelii, we replaced the coding region of an endogenous gene sera1 with the intact
SpCas9 coding sequence using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing method,
generating the cas9-knockin parasite (PyCas9ki) of the rodent malaria parasite P.
yoelii. The resulted PyCas9ki parasite displays normal progression during the
whole life cycle and possesses the Cas9 protein expression in asexual blood
stage. By introducing the plasmid (pYCs) containing only sgRNA and homologous
template elements, we successfully achieved both deletion and tagging
modifications for different endogenous genes in the genome of PyCas9ki parasite. 
This cas9-knockin PyCas9ki parasite provides a new platform facilitating gene
functions study in the rodent malaria parasite P. yoelii.
