Intracellular malaria parasites grow in a vacuole delimited by the
parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM). This membrane fulfils critical roles for
survival of the parasite in its intracellular niche such as in protein export and
nutrient acquisition. Using a conditional knockout (KO), we here demonstrate that
the abundant integral PVM protein exported protein 1 (EXP1) is essential for
parasite survival but that this is independent of its previously postulated
function as a glutathione S-transferase (GST). Patch-clamp experiments indicated 
that EXP1 is critical for the nutrient-permeable channel activity at the PVM.
Loss of EXP1 abolished the correct localisation of EXP2, a pore-forming protein
required for the nutrient-permeable channel activity and protein export at the
PVM. Unexpectedly, loss of EXP1 affected only the nutrient-permeable channel
activity of the PVM but not protein export. Parasites with low levels of EXP1
became hypersensitive to low nutrient conditions, indicating that EXP1 indeed is 
needed for nutrient uptake and experimentally confirming the long-standing
hypothesis that the channel activity measured at the PVM is required for parasite
nutrient acquisition. Hence, EXP1 is specifically required for the functional
expression of EXP2 as the nutrient-permeable channel and is critical for the
metabolite supply of malaria parasites.
