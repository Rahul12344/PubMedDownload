PCR amplification coupled with pyrosequencing was used to measure molecular
markers that could be used to detect and differentiate Plasmodium falciparum and 
Plasmodium vivax in human blood samples. The detection rates were in agreement
with the results of Giemsa-stained film microscopy, which is the current gold
standard for detection. This method provides an exciting alternative for malaria 
diagnosis.
