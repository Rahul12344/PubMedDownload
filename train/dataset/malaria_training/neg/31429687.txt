Malaria disease is a public health problem especially in tropical countries,
445.000 of malaria-related deaths have been reported in 2017. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) 
are small non-coding RNAs with 18-24 nucleotides in length, which have been
demonstrated to regulate gene expression of several biological processes. The
dysregulation of host immune-related gene expressions during the transcriptional 
process by microRNA has been extensively reported in malaria parasite invasion of
erythrocytes infection. The candidate's miRNAs would be used as potential
biomarkers in the future and perspective. A systematic review on miRNAs as
candidate clinical biomarkers in malaria infection has been established in this
study. Electronic databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane data bases)
were screened and articles were included as per established selection criteria.
We comprehensively searched to identify publications related to malaria and
miRNA. PRISMA guidelines were followed, 262 articles were searched, duplicates
and unconnected papers were excluded. Nineteen articles were included in the
study. It was found that malaria parasite infected liver or tissue produce
tissue-specific miRNAs and release to the blood stream. The association of miRNAs
including miR-16, miR-155, miR-150, miR-451 and miR-223 with the dysregulations
of immune-related genes expression such as PfEMP-1, IFN-γ, AGO- 1 AGO-2; IL4,
CD80, CD86, CD36, ANG-1 and ANG-2 during early, severe and/or cerebral malaria
infections indicate the potential use of those miRNAs as biomarkers for malaria
infection.
