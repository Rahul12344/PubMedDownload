In response to environmental stresses, the mammalian serine threonine kinases
PERK, GCN2, HRI, and PKR phosphorylate the regulatory serine 51 of the eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) to inhibit global protein synthesis.
Plasmodium, the protozoan that causes malaria, expresses three eIF2α kinases:
IK1, IK2, and PK4. Like GCN2, IK1 regulates stress response to amino acid
starvation. IK2 inhibits development of malaria sporozoites present in the
mosquito salivary glands. Here we show that the phosphorylation by PK4 of the
regulatory serine 59 of Plasmodium eIF2α is essential for the completion of the
parasite's erythrocytic cycle that causes disease in humans. PK4 activity leads
to the arrest of global protein synthesis in schizonts, where ontogeny of
daughter merozoites takes place, and in gametocytes that infect Anopheles
mosquitoes. The implication of these findings is that drugs that reduce PK4
activity should alleviate disease and inhibit malaria transmission.
