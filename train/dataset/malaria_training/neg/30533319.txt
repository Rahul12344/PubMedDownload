Background: Host factors, including host genetic variation, have been shown to
influence the outcome of Plasmodium falciparum infection. Genome-wide linkage
studies have mapped mild malaria resistance genes on chromosome 6p21, whereas
NCR3-412 polymorphism (rs2736191) lying within this region was found to be
associated with mild malaria.
Methods: Blood samples were taken from 188 Plasmodium falciparum malaria patients
(76 mild malaria patients, 85 cerebral malaria patients, and 27 severe
non-cerebral malaria patients). NCR3-412 (rs2736191) was analysed by sequencing, 
and haematological parameters were measured. Finally, their association with
clinical phenotypes was assessed.
Results: We evidenced an association of thrombocytopenia with both cerebral
malaria and severe non-cerebral malaria, and of an association of high leukocyte 
count with cerebral malaria. Additionally, we found no association of NCR3-412
with either cerebral malaria, severe non-cerebral malaria, or severe malaria
after grouping cerebral malaria and severe non-cerebral malaria patients.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that NCR3 genetic variation has no effect, or
only a small effect on the occurrence of severe malaria, although it has been
strongly associated with mild malaria. We discuss the biological meaning of these
results. Besides, we confirmed the association of thrombocytopenia and high
leukocyte count with severe malaria phenotypes.
