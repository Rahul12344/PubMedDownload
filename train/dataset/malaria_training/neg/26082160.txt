BACKGROUND: Anopheles culicifacies s.l. is one of the primary vectors of malaria 
in India responsible for the highest number of malaria cases. This vector is
resistant to DDT in most parts of the country with indication of emerging
resistance to pyrethroids. Since knockdown resistance (kdr) is known to confer
cross-resistance between DDT and pyrethroids owing to a common target site of
action, knowledge of prevalence of knockdown resistance (kdr) alleles is
important from insecticide resistance management point of view.
METHODS: Nine populations of An. culicifacies belonging to five states of India, 
representing northern, western and central-east India, were screened for the
presence of two alternative kdr mutations L1014F and L1014S using PCR-based
assays. Dead and alive mosquitoes, following WHO standard insecticide
susceptibility test against deltamethrin and DDT, were tested for allelic
association.
RESULTS: L1014F mutation was recorded in all populations studied except from
Haryana and Rajasthan states in northern India, with low frequencies ranging
between 0.012 and 0.076; whereas presence of L1014S mutation was recorded in five
populations only belonging to central-east India, with allelic frequencies
ranging between 0.010 and 0.046. Both the kdr mutant alleles were found mostly in
heterozygous condition without deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Both
mutations showed protection against deltamethrin whereas only L1014S mutation
showed protection against DDT when tested using additive model.
CONCLUSIONS: The two L1014-kdr mutations, L1014F and L1014S, co-occurred in five 
populations belonging to Chhattisgarh and Odisha states of India whereas L1014F
was present in all populations studied except populations from northern states.
Both kdr mutations were found with very low allelic frequencies mostly in
heterozygous condition and exhibited protection against deltamethrin.
