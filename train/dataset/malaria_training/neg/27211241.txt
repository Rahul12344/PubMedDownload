Signal transduction and kinomics have been rapidly expanding areas of
investigation within the malaria research field. Here, we provide an overview of 
phosphosignalling pathways that operate in all stages of the Plasmodium life
cycle. We review signalling pathways in the parasite itself, in the cells it
invades, and in other cells of the vertebrate host with which it interacts. We
also discuss the potential of these pathways as novel targets for antimalarial
intervention.
