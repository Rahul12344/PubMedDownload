OBJECTIVE: To analyze the results of assessment and authentication of malaria
elimination of 7 county-level cities and districts in Changzhou City, Jiangsu
Province, and explore the suitable monitoring methods for malaria after the
elimination in this region, so as to provide the evidence for formulating and
adjusting the malaria elimination strategies and measures.
METHODS: The data from the network reports of malaria epidemic situation, blood
examinations of febrile patients, epidemiological questionnaires of malaria
cases, investigation of epidemic focuses and disposal tables were collected and
analyzed in Changzhou City from 2009 to 2014. The clinicians were assessed with
the closed-book written examinations for their ability of the diagnosis and
treatment of malaria. The inspection personnel were assessed by the microscopical
examinations of Plasmodium. Totally 30 negative blood slides were reviewed. In
the natural village where the last local case of malaria was located, 200 blood
filter papers were collected for gene detection of Plasmodium.
RESULTS: From 2009 to 2014, 145 malaria cases were reported in Changzhou City.
Totally 170 638 febrile patients received blood detections for malaria, of which 
137 cases were positive and the positive rate was 0.08%. The majority of malaria 
cases were imported except 8 local malaria infection cases in 2009 and 2 local
malaria infection cases in 2010. Four of seven county-level cities (districts)
gained an average score of 20 points on the microscopical examinations of
Plasmodium. Liyang City got a minimum average score of 18.8 points. In capacity
assessment of malaria diagnosis and treatment, Liyang City gained the highest
average score of 19.8 points, and Qishuyan District got the lowest average score 
of 18.0 points. The malaria elimination assessment scores of the 7 county-level
cities (districts) were all above 93 points. Four county-level cities (districts)
(Xinbei District, Wujin District, Liyang City, and Jintan City) carried out the
active case detections. A total of 731 cases were detected and the results were
all negative. Liyang City in 2012, Zhonglou District and Jintan City in 2013,
Tianning District, Qishuyan District, Xinbei District and Wujin District in 2014,
passed the malaria elimination assessment at county (district) level,
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: All the 7 county-level cities (districts) of Changzhou City have
passed the malaria elimination assessment at a high score. After the malaria
elimination, the monitoring should continue to consolidate the achievements.

为制订和调整消除疟疾策略和措施提供依据。方法 收集2009-2014年常州市网络报告疟疾疫情、发热病人
血检、专报系统中疟疾病例个案流行病学调查表、疫点调查和处置表等数据进行统计分析。现场对临床医生采用闭卷书 面考试进行疟疾诊治知识考核;
对检验人员进行疟原虫镜检技能考核; 复核30张阴性血片。对当地最后1例疟疾病例所 在自然村, 采制不少于200人份居民滤纸血采样并进行疟原虫基因检测。结果
2009-2014年常州市共报告疟疾病例 145例, 血检发热病人170 638人次, 检出阳性137例, 阳性率0.08%;
常州市除2009年和2010年分别有8例和2例本地感 染疟疾病例外, 其余均为输入性病例。7县 (区) 疟原虫镜检技能考核有4家单位平均分为20分,
溧阳区平均分最低, 为 18.8分; 疟疾诊治能力考核溧阳区平均分最高, 为19.8分, 戚墅堰区平均分最低, 为18.0分; 常州市7县 (区) 消除疟疾总
考核得分均在93分以上。新北区、武进区、溧阳市和金坛市4个县 (区) 开展主动病例侦查, 共检测731人份居民滤纸血 采样,
检测结果均为阴性。溧阳市于2012年, 钟楼区和金坛市于2013年, 天宁区、戚墅堰区、新北区和武进区于2014年 通过消除疟疾县 (区) 级达标考核。结论
常州市7县 (区) 均以高分通过消除疟疾达标考核, 今后应继续做好消除后监 测工作, 巩固已取得的消除疟疾成果。.
