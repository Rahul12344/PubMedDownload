BACKGROUND: Few previous retrospective studies suggest that Plasmodium ovale
wallikeri seems to have a longer latency period and produces deeper
thrombocytopaenia than Plasmodium ovale curtisi. Prospective studies were
warranted to better assess interspecies differences.
METHODS: Patients with imported P. ovale spp. infection diagnosed by thick or
thin film, rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were
recruited between March 2014 and May 2017. All were confirmed by DNA isolation
and classified as P. o. curtisi or P. o. wallikeri using partial sequencing of
the ssrRNA gene. Epidemiological, analytical and clinical differences were
analysed by statistical methods.
RESULTS: A total of 79 samples (35 P. o. curtisi and 44 P. o. wallikeri) were
correctly genotyped. Males predominate in wallikeri group (72.7%), whereas were
48.6% in curtisi group. Conversely, 74.3% of curtisi group were from patients of 
African ethnicity, whilst 52.3% of Caucasians were infected by P. o. wallikeri.
After performing a multivariate analysis, more thrombocytopaenic patients
(p = 0.022), a lower number of platelets (p = 0.015), a higher INR value
(p = 0.041), and shorter latency in Caucasians (p = 0.034) were significantly
seen in P. o. wallikeri. RDT sensitivity was 26.1% in P. o. curtisi and 42.4% in 
P. o. wallikeri. Nearly 20% of both species were diagnosed only by PCR. Total
bilirubin over 3 mg/dL was found in three wallikeri cases. Two patients with
curtisi infection had haemoglobin under 7 g/dL, one of them also with icterus. A 
wallikeri patient suffered from haemophagocytosis. Chemoprophylaxis failed in
14.8% and 35% of curtisi and wallikeri patients, respectively. All treated
patients with various anti-malarials which included artesunate recovered.
Diabetes mellitus was described in 5 patients (6.32%), 4 patients of wallikeri
group and 1 curtisi.
CONCLUSIONS: Imported P. o. wallikeri infection may be more frequent in males and
Caucasians. Malaria caused by P. o. wallikeri produces more thrombocytopaenia, a 
higher INR and shorter latency in Caucasians and suggests a more pathogenic
species. Severe cases can be seen in both species. Chemoprophylaxis seems less
effective in P. ovale spp. infection than in P. falciparum, but any anti-malarial
drug is effective as initial treatment. Diabetes mellitus could be a risk factor 
for P. ovale spp. infection.
