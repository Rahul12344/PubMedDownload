Owing to the increased reports in Aedes-borne diseases in the Caribbean and Latin
America, the United States Agency for International Development assisted the
Jamaican Ministry of Health and Wellness in conducting insecticide susceptibility
tests on Aedes aegypti populations. Sentinel sites were established in seven
parishes of Jamaica (St. Catherine, Kingston and St. Andrew, St. Thomas,
Portland, St. Mary and St. Ann) and Aedes aegypti eggs were collected, reared to 
adults per collected population and their susceptibility to varying pyrethroids
and organophosphates were tested using the World Health Organization paper
bioassays for these insecticides. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
bottle bioassay was used to assess susceptibility to the carbamate, bendiocarb.
The voltage gated sodium channel gene mutations V1016I and I1011V, normally
associated with pyrethroid resistance, were also analysed. The results showed
that Aedes aegypti collected from all parishes exhibited resistance to
pyrethroids at the following concentrations, permethrin 0.25-2.5%; deltamethrin
0.03-0.15%; lambda-cyhalothrin 0.03-0.3%; and etofenprox 0.5-2.5%. The
insecticide deltamethrin at concentration 0.3% was the only pyrethroid tested
that resulted in high mortality, 94.9 ± 0.34% knockdown within 1 hour of exposure
and 98.95 ± 0.01% mortality (p <0.01) at 24 hours post exposure. The frequency of
the voltage gated sodium channel gene mutation V1016I was high in the tested
population, possibly accounting for the reduced sensitivity to pyrethroids.
Organophosphate resistance was also observed in all populations tested. Mortality
rates for 0.8% Malathion was 0.8 ± 0.70-60.68 ± 0.38% after 24 hour and
0.00-47.10 ± 3.02%, for pirimiphos-methyl 0.21%. Bendiocarb applied as 12.5 μg/
bottle resulted in mortality rates of 76.25 ± 4.30-100 ± 0.00% after 30 minutes
of exposure. The results showed that Ae. aegypti from the seven parishes analysed
demonstrated resistance to the insecticides tested. Deltamethrin and bendiocarb
at concentrations 0.3% and 12.5μg respectively, were considered most effective,
causing high mortality in the local populations. Routine monitoring and
evaluations of Ae. aegypti populations from the included parishes are
recommended. Additionally, the study results represent the most comprehensive
testing to date with local Aedes aegypti populations distributed across different
parishes of Jamaica and should be useful to guide national and sub national
strategies for vector control and surveillance.
