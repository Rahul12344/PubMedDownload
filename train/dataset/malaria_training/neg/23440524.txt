On July 15, 2012, adult Anopheles hyrcanus (Pallas 1771) mosquitoes were caught
next to a farm barn near Rust, Burgenland, close to Lake Neusiedl National Park
in eastern Austria. Six weeks later, adults of this invasive species were also
found in a sheep shelter outside the village of Oggau and another 2 weeks later, 
in a horse barn in Mörbisch. The morphological typing was confirmed genetically
by amplification and sequencing of a 1,404-bp-long fragment within the 5.8S
ribosomal RNA gene, the internal transcribed spacer 2, and the 28S ribosomal RNA 
gene. Out of two A. hyrcanus pools analyzed, one was found positive for
Plasmodium sp. A 460-bp-long sequence within the mitochondrial cytochrome b
region revealed 100 % identity to a sequence of a Plasmodium parasite identified 
in a New Zealand bellbird (Anthornis melanura). The Austrian finding sites are
close to the Hungarian border. In Hungary, the occurrence of A. hyrcanus was
already reported in 1963. A. hyrcanus is considered the most important potential 
vector of malaria in southern France today. In Austria, sporadic autochthonous
malaria cases could emerge, caused by immigration from malaria-endemic countries 
and heavy tourism. However, the broad population coverage of the Austrian health 
care system makes the reestablishment of endemic areas for malaria unlikely.
