BACKGROUND: Malaria continues being a public health problem worldwide. Plasmodium
vivax is the species causing the largest number of cases of malaria in Asia and
South America. Due to the lack of a completely effective anti-malarial vaccine,
controlling this disease has been based on transmission vector management, rapid 
diagnosis and suitable treatment. However, parasite resistance to anti-malarial
drugs has become a major yet-to-be-overcome challenge. This study was thus aimed 
at determining pvmdr1, pvdhfr, pvdhps and pvcrt-o gene mutations and haplotypes
from field samples obtained from an endemic area in the Colombian Amazonian
region.
METHODS: Fifty samples of parasite DNA infected by a single P. vivax strain from 
symptomatic patients from the Amazonas department in Colombia were analysed by
PCR and the pvdhfr, pvdhps, pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes were sequenced. Diversity
estimators were calculated from the sequences and the haplotypes circulating in
the Colombian Amazonian region were obtained.
CONCLUSION: pvdhfr, pvdhps, pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes in the Colombian Amazonian
region are characterized by low genetic diversity. Some resistance-associated
mutations were found circulating in this population. New variants are also being 
reported. A selective sweep signal was located in pvdhfr and pvmdr1 genes,
suggesting that these mutations (or some of them) could be providing an adaptive 
advantage.
