OBJECTIVE: Drug resistance against Plasmodium falciparum has been recognized as
the crucial obstacle to curbing mortality and morbidity from malaria. To
investigate the distribution and pattern of multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1) gene 
polymorphisms in P. falciparum, isolates collected from the malaria high-endemic 
Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 217 patients with P. falciparum
malaria during rainy season in 2012 on Bioko Island. These samples were extracted
using Chelex to obtain parasite DNA. Nest-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
sequencing were employed to detect mutations (N86Y, E130K, Y184F, S1034C, N1042D,
V1109I, and D1246Y) and haplotypes in pfmdr1 gene.
RESULTS: A total of 151 samples were successfully detected for pfmdr1 mutations
from the 217 patients. Pfmdr1 mutations were found in 91·39% (138/151) P.
falciparum isolates. However, no mutation at 130 and 1109 was identified from
these samples. Four haplotypes coding 86, 184, 1034, 1,042, and 1,246 were found 
including NYSND, YYSND, NFSND, and YFSND, which accounted for 8·61% (13/151),
2·65% (4/151), 29·80% (45/151), and 58·94% (89/151), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results exhibited hypersensitivity to lumefantrine (LU) and
mefloquine (MQ) and resistance to chloroquine (CQ) and amodiaquine (AQ) in P.
falciparum isolates from Bioko Island. This information will be useful for
anti-malarial drug policy in Equatorial Guinea.
