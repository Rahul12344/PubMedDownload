Development of cerebral malaria (CM), a severe and fatal form of clinical
Plasmodium falciparum infection, results from a damaging cascade of vascular,
inflammatory, and immunological host responses that leads to brain injury.
Progression to CM can be modified by host genetic factors. Our case-control study
in Angolan children aimed at highlighting the role of IFN (α, β) receptor 1
(IFNAR1) in progression to CM. We report a robust association between IFNAR1 and 
CM protection, as well as detailed studies showing analogous protection from
experimental CM in Ifnar1(-/-) mice infected with P. berghei ANKA. We developed a
novel cell-transfer protocol that enables spleen cell priming in the absence of
disease. This led to the discovery that IFNAR1 expression in CD8(+) T cells is
crucial and can abrogate resistance to experimental CM in Ifnar1(-/-) mice.
Splenic CD8(+) T cells from Ifnar1(-/-) mice are functionally activated upon
infection, yet are unable to mediate experimental CM development within the brain
tissue. Our findings prove that IFNAR1 signaling unleashes CD8(+) T cell effector
capacity, which is vital for CM, and raises the hypothesis that the cohesive role
of IFNAR1 in both human and mouse CM operates through CD8(+) T cell triggering.
