BACKGROUND: The Barbirostris Complex comprises six formally described species
that cannot be differentiated based on morphology alone. Out of these six
species, two have been reported as putative malaria vectors, An. campestris and
An. wejchoochotei. Five species are present in Thailand, An. barbirostris, An.
campestris, An. dissidens, An. saeungae and An. wejchoochotei, while An.
vanderwulpi occurs in Indonesia. As these species cannot be accurately
differentiated by morphological characters, there is a crucial lack of
information on their bionomics and role in the transmission of malaria and
filariasis agents.
RESULTS: For differentiating the six species, an allele-specific amplification
(AS-PCR) based on the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) sequence was
developed. From 862 mosquitoes in the Barbirostris Complex collected in 23
provinces throughout Thailand, the AS-PCR was able to identify five species and
its validation was undertaken on 185 specimens.
CONCLUSIONS: This multiplex-PCR assay is potentially able to definitely identify 
all six species of the Barbirostris Complex and was validated on five species
present in Thailand.
