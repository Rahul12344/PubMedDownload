Plasmodium falciparum can invade all stages of red blood cells, while Plasmodium 
vivax can invade only reticulocytes. Although many P. vivax proteins have been
discovered, their functions are largely unknown. Among them, P. vivax
reticulocyte binding proteins (PvRBP1 and PvRBP2) recognize and bind to
reticulocytes. Both proteins possess a C-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane
domain, which drives adhesion to reticulocytes. PvRBP1 and PvRBP2 are large (>
326 kDa), which hinders identification of the functional domains. In this study, 
the complete genome information of the P. vivax RBP family was thoroughly
analyzed using a prediction server with bioinformatics data to predict B-cell
epitope domains. Eleven pvrbp family genes that included 2 pseudogenes and 9 full
or partial length genes were selected and used to express recombinant proteins in
a wheat germ cell-free system. The expressed proteins were used to evaluate the
humoral immune response with vivax malaria patients and healthy individual serum 
samples by protein microarray. The recombinant fragments of 9 PvRBP proteins were
successfully expressed; the soluble proteins ranged in molecular weight from 16
to 34 kDa. Evaluation of the humoral immune response to each recombinant PvRBP
protein indicated a high antigenicity, with 38-88% sensitivity and 100%
specificity. Of them, N-terminal parts of PvRBP2c (PVX_090325-1) and PvRBP2 like 
partial A (PVX_090330-1) elicited high antigenicity. In addition, the PvRBP2-like
homologue B (PVX_116930) fragment was newly identified as high antigenicity and
may be exploited as a potential antigenic candidate among the PvRBP family. The
functional activity of the PvRBP family on merozoite invasion remains unknown.
