BACKGROUND: A multidrug-resistant co-lineage of Plasmodium falciparum malaria,
named KEL1/PLA1, spread across Cambodia in 2008-13, causing high rates of
treatment failure with the frontline combination therapy
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Here, we report on the evolution and spread of
KEL1/PLA1 in subsequent years.
METHODS: For this genomic epidemiology study, we analysed whole genome sequencing
data from P falciparum clinical samples collected from patients with malaria
between 2007 and 2018 from Cambodia, Laos, northeastern Thailand, and Vietnam,
through the MalariaGEN P falciparum Community Project. Previously unpublished
samples were provided by two large-scale multisite projects: the Tracking
Artemisinin Resistance Collaboration II (TRAC2) and the Genetic Reconnaissance in
the Greater Mekong Subregion (GenRe-Mekong) project. By investigating genome-wide
relatedness between parasites, we inferred patterns of shared ancestry in the
KEL1/PLA1 population.
FINDINGS: We analysed 1673 whole genome sequences that passed quality filters,
and determined KEL1/PLA1 status in 1615. Before 2009, KEL1/PLA1 was only found in
western Cambodia; by 2016-17 its prevalence had risen to higher than 50% in all
of the surveyed countries except for Laos. In northeastern Thailand and Vietnam, 
KEL1/PLA1 exceeded 80% of the most recent P falciparum parasites. KEL1/PLA1
parasites maintained high genetic relatedness and low diversity, reflecting a
recent common origin. Several subgroups of highly related parasites have recently
emerged within this co-lineage, with diverse geographical distributions. The
three largest of these subgroups (n=84, n=79, and n=47) mostly emerged since 2016
and were all present in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. These expanding subgroups
carried new mutations in the crt gene, which arose on a specific genetic
background comprising multiple genomic regions. Four newly emerging crt mutations
were rare in the early period and became more prevalent by 2016-17 (Thr93Ser,
rising to 19·8%; His97Tyr to 11·2%; Phe145Ile to 5·5%; and Ile218Phe to 11·1%).
INTERPRETATION: After emerging and circulating for several years within Cambodia,
the P falciparum KEL1/PLA1 co-lineage diversified into multiple subgroups and
acquired new genetic features, including novel crt mutations. These subgroups
have rapidly spread into neighbouring countries, suggesting enhanced fitness.
These findings highlight the urgent need for elimination of this increasingly
drug-resistant parasite co-lineage, and the importance of genetic surveillance in
accelerating malaria elimination efforts.
