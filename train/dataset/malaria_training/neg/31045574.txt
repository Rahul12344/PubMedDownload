Chronic malaria is a major public health problem and significant challenge for
disease eradication efforts. Despite its importance, the biological factors
underpinning chronic malaria are not fully understood. Recent studies have shown 
that host metabolic state can influence malaria pathogenesis and transmission,
but its role in chronicity is not known. Here, with the goal of identifying
distinct modifications in the metabolite profiles of acute versus chronic
malaria, metabolomics was performed on plasma from Plasmodium-infected humans and
nonhuman primates with a range of parasitemias and clinical signs. In rhesus
macaques infected with Plasmodium coatneyi, significant alterations in amines,
carnitines, and lipids were detected during a high parasitemic acute phase and
many of these reverted to baseline levels once a low parasitemic chronic phase
was established. Plasmodium gene expression, studied in parallel in the macaques,
revealed transcriptional changes in amine, fatty acid, lipid and energy
metabolism genes, as well as variant antigen genes. Furthermore, a common set of 
amines, carnitines, and lipids distinguished acute from chronic malaria in plasma
from human Plasmodium falciparum cases. In summary, distinct host-parasite
metabolic environments have been uncovered that characterize acute versus chronic
malaria, providing insights into the underlying host-parasite biology of malaria 
disease progression.
