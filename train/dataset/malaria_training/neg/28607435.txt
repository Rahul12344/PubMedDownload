Anopheles mosquitoes are vectors of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium
falciparum. The vector microbiota is a likely factor influencing parasite
transmission. The prokaryotic microbiota of mosquitoes is efficiently surveyed by
sequencing of hypervariable regions of the 16s ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene.
However, identification of the eukaryotic microbiota by targeting the 18s rRNA
gene is challenging due to simultaneous amplification of the abundant 18s rRNA
gene target in the mosquito host. Consequently, the eukaryotic microbial
diversity of mosquitoes is vastly underexplored. An efficient methodology is
needed to identify this component of the microbiota, expected to include
relatives of Plasmodium. Here, we use defined panels of Anopheles samples from
West Africa to test two experimental PCR clamp approaches to maximize the
specific amplification of 18s rRNA gene hypervariable regions from eukaryotic
microbes: anneal-inhibiting blocking primers and peptide-nucleic acid (PNA)
oligonucleotide blockers. Of the two, PNA blockers were the only efficient
blocking strategy, allowing a reduction of mosquito 18s rRNA gene sequences by
more than 80% for the V4 hypervariable region. These PNA blockers will facilitate
taxonomic profiling of the eukaryotic microbiota of the A. gambiae species
complex, and contribute to a better understanding of microbial influence upon
immunity and pathogen infection.
