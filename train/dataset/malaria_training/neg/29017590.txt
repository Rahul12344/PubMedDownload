BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a major public health threat in Cameroon and disease 
prevention is facing strong challenges due to the rapid expansion of insecticide 
resistance in vector populations. The present review presents an overview of
published data on insecticide resistance in the main malaria vectors in Cameroon 
to assist in the elaboration of future and sustainable resistance management
strategies.
METHODS: A systematic search on mosquito susceptibility to insecticides and
insecticide resistance in malaria vectors in Cameroon was conducted using online 
bibliographic databases including PubMed, Google and Google Scholar. From each
peer-reviewed paper, information on the year of the study, mosquito species,
susceptibility levels, location, insecticides, data source and resistance
mechanisms were extracted and inserted in a Microsoft Excel datasheet. The data
collected were then analysed for assessing insecticide resistance evolution.
RESULTS: Thirty-three scientific publications were selected for the analysis. The
rapid evolution of insecticide resistance across the country was reported from
2000 onward. Insecticide resistance was highly prevalent in both An. gambiae
(s.l.) and An. funestus. DDT, permethrin, deltamethrin and bendiocarb appeared as
the most affected compounds by resistance. From 2000 to 2017 a steady increase in
the prevalence of kdr allele frequency was noted in almost all sites in An.
gambiae (s.l.), with the L1014F kdr allele being the most prevalent. Several
detoxification genes (particularly P450 monooxygenase) were associated with DDT, 
pyrethroids and bendiocarb resistance. In An. funestus, resistance to DDT and
pyrethroids was mainly attributed to the 119F-GSTe2 metabolic resistance marker
and over-expression of P450 genes whereas the 296S-RDL mutation was detected in
dieldrin-resistant An. funestus.
CONCLUSIONS: The review provides an update of insecticide resistance status in
malaria vector populations in Cameroon and stresses the need for further actions 
to reinforce malaria control strategies in the coming years.
