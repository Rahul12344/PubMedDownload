Sequence variation in the asparagine/aspartate-rich domain of pfmdr1 in 215
isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from three African countries was compared with 
published data. The role of this domain in modulating antimalarial sensitivity
has not been established. The pfmdr1 86Y allele was significantly associated with
different configurations of the Asn/Asp-rich domain in West and East Africa. In
Kenya, a specific form of the Asn/Asp-rich domain was significantly linked to the
86Y, 184Y, and 1246Y haplotype of pfmdr1.
