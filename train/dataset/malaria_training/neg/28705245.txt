or fecundity.

BACKGROUND: Abscisic acid (ABA) is naturally present in mammalian blood and
circulating levels can be increased by oral supplementation. We showed previously
that oral ABA supplementation in a mouse model of Plasmodium yoelii 17XNL
infection reduced parasitemia and gametocytemia, spleen and liver pathology, and 
parasite transmission to the mosquito Anopheles stephensi fed on these mice.
Treatment of cultured Plasmodium falciparum with ABA at levels detected in our
model had no effects on asexual growth or gametocyte formation in vitro. However,
ABA treatment of cultured P. falciparum immediately prior to mosquito feeding
significantly reduced oocyst development in A. stephensi via ABA-dependent
synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) in the mosquito midgut.
RESULTS: Here we describe the mechanisms of effects of ABA on mosquito
physiology, which are dependent on phosphorylation of TGF-β-activated kinase 1
(TAK1) and associated with changes in homeostatic gene expression and activity of
kinases that are central to metabolic regulation in the midgut epithelium.
Collectively, the timing of these effects suggests a transient physiological
shift that enhances NF-κB-dependent innate immunity without significantly
altering mosquito lifespan or fecundity.
CONCLUSIONS: ABA is a highly conserved regulator of immune and metabolic
homeostasis within the malaria vector A. stephensi with potential as a
transmission-blocking supplemental treatment.
