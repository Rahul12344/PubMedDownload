The ability of transposons to mobilize to new places in a genome enables them to 
introgress rapidly into populations. The piRNA pathway has been characterized
recently in the germ line of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and is
responsible for downregulating transposon mobility. Transposons have been used as
tools in mosquitoes to genetically transform a number of species including
Anopheles stephensi, a vector of human malaria. These mobile genetic elements
also have been proposed as tools to drive antipathogen effector genes into wild
mosquito populations to replace pathogen-susceptible insects with those
engineered genetically to be resistant to or unable to transmit a pathogen. The
piRNA pathway may affect the performance of such proposed genetic engineering
strategies. In the present study, we identify and describe the An. stephensi
orthologues of the major genes in the piRNA pathway, Ago3, Aubergine (Aub) and
Piwi. Consistent with a role in protection from transposon movement, these three 
genes are expressed constitutively in the germ-line cells of ovaries and induced 
further after a blood meal.
