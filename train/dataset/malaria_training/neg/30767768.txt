BACKGROUND: Rodent malaria models are extensively used to predict treatment
outcomes in human infections. There is a constant need to improve and refine
these models by innovating ways to apply new scientific findings and cutting edge
technologies. In addition, and in accordance with the three R's of animal use in 
research, in vivo studies should be constantly refined to avoid unnecessary pain 
and distress to the experimental animals by using preemptive euthanasia as soon
as the main scientific study objective has been accomplished.
METHODS: The new methodology described in this manuscript uses the whole-body
bioluminescence signal emitted by transgenic, luciferase-expressing Plasmodium
berghei parasites to assess the parasite load predicted parasitaemia (PLPP) in
drug and control treated female ICR-CD1 mice infected with 1 × 105
luciferase-expressing P. berghei (ANKA strain) infected erythrocytes. This
methodology can replace other time-consuming and expensive methods that are
routinely used to measure parasitaemia in infected animals, such as
Giemsa-stained thin blood smears and flow cytometry.
RESULTS: There is a good correlation between whole-body bioluminescence signal
and parasitaemia measured using Giemsa-stained thin blood smears and flow
cytometry respectively in donor and study mice in the modified Thompson test. The
algebraic formulas which represent these correlations can be successfully used to
assess PLPP in donor and study mice. In addition, the new methodology can
pinpoint sick animals 2-8 days before they would have been otherwise diagnosed
based on behavioural or any other signs of malaria disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The new method for predicting parasitaemia in the modified Thompson 
test is simple, precise, objective, and minimizes false positive results that can
lead to the premature removal of animals from study. Furthermore, from the animal
welfare perspective of replace, reduce, and refine, this new method facilitates
early removal of sick animals from study as soon as the study objective has been 
achieved, in many cases well before the clinical signs of disease are present.
