Fluorescence-based techniques have been used extensively in the malaria field to 
study the functional role of nuclear organization and gene positioning in blood
stages of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. In this chapter, we 
present optimized protocols for bromouridine (BrUTP) incorporation into nascent
RNA in live parasites and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in fixed
parasites. Methodology to perform various combinations of the FISH assay, as well
as a basic approach for quantitative analysis of nuclear position, is also
described.
