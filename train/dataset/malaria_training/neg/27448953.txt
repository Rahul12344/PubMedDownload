BACKGROUND: The emergence of resistant power against different antimalarial
agents particularly by Plasmodium falciparum is a challenge to combat malaria.
Regular monitoring is essential not only to determine the efficacy and
development of resistance by the parasite but also to detect early sign of
regaining sensitivity to any anti-malarial agent that has been withdrawn for a
long period. Studies on molecular markers associated with antimalarial drug
resistance of prevailing Plasmodium population play an important role in this
aspect. The present protocol was designed to study the polymorphisms in pfcrt and
pfmdr-1 gene to determine any sign of regaining sensitivity to chloroquine among 
P. falciparum after five years of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT)
implementation.
METHODS: Clinical isolates were collected from P. falciparum positive patients
attending the malaria clinic of Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine during
December 2014 to December 2015. Genomic parasitic DNA was extracted and subjected
to sequencing of pfcrt and pfmdr-1 gene directly from purified PCR products.
RESULTS: A total of 89 isolates were sequenced for pfcrt and 73 isolates for
pfmdr-1 genes. In pfcrt gene mutant K76T was detected in all isolates and all
were SVMNT haplotype. Out of three important polymorphisms in pfmdr-1 gene mutant
Y184F was detected among all isolates. One synonymous G182G and one
non-synonymous S232F/Y, mutation were detected in 99% isolates.
CONCLUSION: All isolates carrying mutant K76T in pfcrt gene, considered as hall
mark for CQ resistance, indicate that there is no sign of regaining CQ
sensitivity among the prevailing P. falciparum population of the study area after
five years of ACT implementation.
