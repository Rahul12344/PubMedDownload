BACKGROUND: Antigenic variation of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane
protein 1 is a key parasite mechanism for immune evasion and parasite survival.
It is assumed that the number of parasites expressing the same var gene must
reach high enough numbers before the host can produce detectable levels of
antibodies (Ab) to the variant. VAR2CSA is a protein coded for by one of 60 var
genes that is expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes (IE) and mediates
IE binding to the placenta. The idea that Ab to VAR2CSA are pregnancy-associated 
was challenged when VAR2CSA-specific Ab were reported in children and men.
However, the frequency and conditions under which Ab to VAR2CSA are produced
outside pregnancy is unclear. This study sought to determine frequency,
specificity and level of Ab to VAR2CSA produced in children and whether children 
with hyperparasitaemia and severe malaria are more likely to produce Ab to
VAR2CSA compared to healthy children.
METHODS: Antibody responses to a panel of recombinant proteins consisting of
multiple VAR2CSA Duffy-binding-like domains (DBL) and full-length VAR2CSA (FV2)
were characterized in 193 1-15 year old children from rural Cameroonian villages 
and 160 children with severe malaria from the city.
RESULTS: Low Ab levels to VAR2CSA were detected in children; however, Ab levels
to FV2 in teenagers were rare. Children preferentially recognized DBL2 (56-70%)
and DBL4 (50-60%), while multigravidae produced high levels of IgG to DBL3, DBL5 
and FV2. Sixty-seven percent of teenage girls (n = 16/24) recognized ID1-ID2a
region of VAR2CSA. Children with severe forms of malaria had significantly higher
IgG to merozoite antigens (all p < 0.05), but not to VAR2CSA (all p > 0.05) when 
compared to the healthy children.
CONCLUSION: The study suggests that children, including teenage girls acquire Ab 
to VAR2CSA domains and FV2, but Ab levels are much lower than those needed to
protect women from placental infections and repertoire of Ab responses to DBL
domains is different from those in pregnant women. Interestingly, children with
severe malaria did not have higher Ab levels to VAR2CSA compared to healthy
children.
