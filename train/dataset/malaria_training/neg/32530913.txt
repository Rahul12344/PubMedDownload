BACKGROUND: Vivax malaria is an important public health problem in the Greater
Mekong Subregion (GMS), including the China-Myanmar border. Previous studies have
found that Plasmodium vivax has decreased sensitivity to antimalarial drugs in
some areas of the GMS, but the sensitivity of P. vivax to antimalarial drugs is
unclear in the China-Myanmar border. Here, we investigate the drug sensitivity
profile and genetic variations for two drug resistance related genes in P. vivax 
isolates to provide baseline information for future drug studies in the
China-Myanmar border.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 64 P. vivax clinical isolates
collected from the China-Myanmar border area were assessed for ex vivo
susceptibility to eight antimalarial drugs by the schizont maturation assay. The 
medians of IC50 (half-maximum inhibitory concentrations) for chloroquine,
mefloquine, pyronaridine, piperaquine, quinine, artesunate, artemether,
dihydroartemisinin were 84.2 nM, 34.9 nM, 4.0 nM, 22.3 nM, 41.4 nM, 2.8 nM, 2.1
nM and 2.0 nM, respectively. Twelve P. vivax clinical isolates were found over
the cut-off IC50 value (220 nM) for chloroquine resistance. In addition, sequence
polymorphisms in pvmdr1 (P. vivax multidrug resistance-1), pvcrt-o (P. vivax
chloroquine resistance transporter-o), and difference in pvmdr1 copy number were 
studied. Sequencing of the pvmdr1 gene in 52 samples identified 12 amino acid
substitutions, among which two (G698S and T958M) were fixed, M908L were present
in 98.1% of the isolates, while Y976F and F1076L were present in 3.8% and 78.8%
of the isolates, respectively. Amplification of the pvmdr1 gene was only detected
in 4.8% of the samples. Sequencing of the pvcrt-o in 59 parasite isolates
identified a single lysine insertion at position 10 in 32.2% of the isolates. The
pvmdr1 M908L substitutions in pvmdr1 in our samples was associated with reduced
sensitivity to chloroquine, mefloquine, pyronaridine, piperaquine, quinine,
artesunate and dihydroartemisinin.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings depict a drug sensitivity profile and genetic
variations of the P. vivax isolates from the China-Myanmar border area, and
suggest possible emergence of chloroquine resistant P. vivax isolates in the
region, which demands further efforts for resistance monitoring and mechanism
studies.
