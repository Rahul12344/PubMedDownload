BACKGROUND: Evidence of haemosporidian infections in bats and bat flies has
motivated a growing interest in characterizing their transmission cycles. In
Gabon (Central Africa), many caves house massive colonies of bats that are known 
hosts of Polychromophilus Dionisi parasites, presumably transmitted by
blood-sucking bat flies. However, the role of bat flies in bat malaria
transmission remains under-documented.
METHODS: An entomological survey was carried out in four caves in Gabon to
investigate bat fly diversity, infestation rates and host preferences and to
determine their role in Polychromophilus parasite transmission. Bat flies were
sampled for 2-4 consecutive nights each month from February to April 2011 (Faucon
and Zadie caves) and from May 2012 to April 2013 (Kessipoughou and Djibilong
caves). Bat flies isolated from the fur of each captured bat were morphologically
identified and screened for infection by haemosporidian parasites using primers
targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene.
RESULTS: Among the 1,154 bats captured and identified as Miniopterus inflatus
Thomas (n = 354), Hipposideros caffer Sundevall complex (n = 285), Hipposideros
gigas Wagner (n = 317), Rousettus aegyptiacus Geoffroy (n = 157, and Coleura afra
Peters (n = 41), 439 (38.0 %) were infested by bat flies. The 1,063 bat flies
recovered from bats belonged to five taxa: Nycteribia schmidlii scotti Falcoz,
Eucampsipoda africana Theodor, Penicillidia fulvida Bigot, Brachytarsina allaudi 
Falcoz and Raymondia huberi Frauenfeld group. The mean infestation rate varied
significantly according to the bat species (ANOVA, F (4,75) = 13.15, P < 0.001)
and a strong association effect between bat fly species and host bat species was 
observed. Polychromophilus melanipherus Dionisi was mainly detected in N. s.
scotti and P. fulvida and less frequently in E. africana, R. huberi group and B. 
allaudi bat flies. These results suggest that N. s. scotti and P. fulvida could
potentially be involved in P. melanipherus transmission among cave-dwelling bats.
Sequence analysis revealed eight haplotypes of P. melanipherus.
CONCLUSIONS: This work represents the first documented record of the
cave-dwelling bat fly fauna in Gabon and significantly contributes to our
understanding of bat fly host-feeding behavior and their respective roles in
Polychromophilus transmission.
