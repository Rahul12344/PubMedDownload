Apicidins are cyclic tetrapeptides with histone deacetylase inhibitory activity. 
Since their discovery in 1996 a multitude of studies concerning the activity
against protozoa and certain cancer cell lines of natural and synthetic apicidin 
analogues have been published. Until now, the only published natural sources of
apicidin are the fungus Fusarium pallidoroseum, later known as F. semitectum and 
two unspecified Fusarium strains. The biosynthetic origin of apicidins could be
associated with a gene cluster, and a biosynthetic pathway has been proposed.
Recently, our group was able to identify for the first time an apicidin-like gene
cluster in F. fujikuroi that apparently does not lead to the production of any
known apicidin analogue. By overexpressing the pathway-specific transcription
factor we were able to identify a new apicidin-like compound. The present study
provides the complete structure elucidation of the new compound, named apicidin
F. Activity evaluation against Plasmodium falciparum showed good in vitro
activity with an IC50 value of 0.67 μM.
