K+ channels are integral membrane proteins, which contribute to maintain vital
parameters such as the cellular membrane potential and cell volume. Malaria
parasites encode two K+ channel homologues, Kch1 and Kch2, which are
well-conserved among members of the Plasmodium genus. In the rodent malaria
parasite P. berghei, the functional significance of K+ channel homologue PbKch2
was studied using targeted gene knock-out. The knockout parasites were
characterized in a mouse model in terms of growth-kinetics and infectivity in the
mosquito vector. Furthermore, using a tracer-uptake technique with 86Rb+ as a K+ 
congener, the K+ transporting properties of the knockout parasites were
assessed.RESULTS: Genetic disruption of Kch2 did not grossly affect the phenotype
in terms of asexual replication and pathogenicity in a mouse model. In contrast
to Kch1-null parasites, Kch2-null parasites were fully capable of forming oocysts
in female Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. 86Rb+ uptake in Kch2-deficient
blood-stage P. berghei parasites (Kch2-null) did not differ from that of
wild-type (WT) parasites. About two-thirds of the 86Rb+ uptake in WT and in
Kch2-null parasites could be inhibited by K+ channel blockers and could be
inferred to the presence of functional Kch1 in Kch2 knockout parasites. Kch2 is
therefore not required for transport of K+ in P. berghei and is not essential to 
mosquito-stage sporogonic development of the parasite.
