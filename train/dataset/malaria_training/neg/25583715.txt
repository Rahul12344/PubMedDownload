The prevalence of a genetic polymorphism(s) at codon 268 in the cytochrome b
gene, which is associated with failure of atovaquone-proguanil treatment, was
analyzed in 227 Plasmodium falciparum parasites from western Kenya. The
prevalence of the wild-type allele was 63%, and that of the Y268S (denoting a
Y-to-S change at position 268) mutant allele was 2%. There were no pure Y268C or 
Y268N mutant alleles, only mixtures of a mutant allele(s) with the wild type.
There was a correlation between parasite 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) and 
parasite genetic polymorphism; mutant alleles had higher IC50s than the wild
type.
