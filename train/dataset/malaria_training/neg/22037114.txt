BACKGROUND: Fungal pathogens have developed strategies, involving genes
expression that favors their persistence and multiplication in the host. The
absence of molecules encoded by these genes could interfere with the growth and
death of these fungi. In the past, a coactivator protein coding gene (Hcp100) of 
the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum was reported, which is overexpressed after 1h
of contact between fungal yeast-cells and murine macrophages. The product of this
gene, a protein of 100 kDa (Hcp100) of H. capsulatum, is probably a regulatory
protein involved in the processes required for fungal adaptation and its survival
in the intracellular hostile conditions of the macrophages. A 210-bp fragment of 
the Hcp100 marker has proved to be an excellent tool for H. capsulatum molecular 
detection in clinical samples. The potential use of this gene as a therapeutic
target in Plasmodium falciparum has been explored through the inhibition of both,
the gene and the protein p100 of the parasite, by blocking its growth.
METHODS: Based on the above mentioned antecedents, we believe that the Hcp100 has
an important role in the development and maintenance of the H. capsulatum yeast
cells within macrophages.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: To study the probable function of Hcp100 in the
yeast-phase of this fungal pathogen is relevant to understand its activity and to
propose it as a therapeutic target for histoplasmosis treatment.
