We used a genome-wide screen in mutagenized mice to identify genes which
inactivation protects against lethal neuroinflammation during experimental
cerebral malaria (ECM). We identified an ECM-protective mutation in coiled-coil
domain containing protein 88b (Ccdc88b), a poorly annotated gene that is found
expressed specifically in spleen, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and thymus. The
CCDC88B protein is abundantly expressed in immune cells, including both CD4(+)
and CD8(+) T lymphocytes, and in myeloid cells, and loss of CCDC88B protein
expression has pleiotropic effects on T lymphocyte functions, including impaired 
maturation in vivo, significantly reduced activation, reduced cell division as
well as impaired cytokine production (IFN-γ and TNF) in response to T cell
receptor engagement, or to nonspecific stimuli in vitro, and during the course of
P. berghei infection in vivo. This identifies CCDC88B as a novel and important
regulator of T cell function. The human CCDC88B gene maps to the 11q13 locus that
is associated with susceptibility to several inflammatory and auto-immune
disorders. Our findings strongly suggest that CCDC88B is the morbid gene
underlying the pleiotropic effect of the 11q13 locus on inflammation.
