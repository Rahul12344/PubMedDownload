OBJECTIVES: Pfs48/45 and Pfs230 are Plasmodium falciparum sexual stage proteins
and promising malaria transmission-blocking vaccine candidates. Antibody
responses against these proteins may be naturally acquired and target antigens
may be under selective pressure. This has consequences for the future evaluation 
of vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy in populations naturally exposed to
malaria.
METHODS: We determined naturally acquired antibody responses to the recombinant
proteins Pfs48/45-10C and Pfs230-230CMB in children from three malaria endemic
settings in Ghana, Tanzania and Burkina Faso. We also examined genetic
polymorphisms in the P. falciparum gene pfs48/45.
RESULTS: Antibody prevalence was 1.1-18.2% for 10C and 6.7-18.9% for 230CMB. In
Burkina Faso we observed evidence of an age-dependent acquisition pattern for
both 10C (p < 0.001) and 230CMB (p = 0.031). Membrane feeding assays on a
separate dataset demonstrated an association between functional transmission
reducing activity and antibody prevalence for both 10C (p = 0.017) and 230CMB
(p = 0.049). 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms were found in pfs48/45 (from 126 
samples), with 5 non-synonymous SNPs in the Pfs48/45 10C region.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude there are naturally acquired antibody responses to both 
vaccine candidates which have functional relevance by reducing the
transmissibility of infected individuals. We identified genetic polymorphisms, in
pfs48/45 which exhibited geographical specificity.
