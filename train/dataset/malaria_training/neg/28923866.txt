Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) has demonstrated excellent efficacy for the
treatment and prevention of malaria in Uganda. However, resistance to both
components of this regimen has emerged in Southeast Asia. The efficacy of
artemether-lumefantrine, the first-line regimen to treat malaria in Uganda, has
also been excellent, but continued pressure may select for parasites with
decreased sensitivity to lumefantrine. To gain insight into current drug
sensitivity patterns, ex vivo sensitivities were assessed and genotypes
previously associated with altered drug sensitivity were characterized for 58
isolates collected in Tororo, Uganda, from subjects presenting in 2016 with
malaria from the community or as part of a clinical trial comparing DP
chemoprevention regimens. Compared to community isolates, those from trial
subjects had lower sensitivities to the aminoquinolines chloroquine, monodesethyl
amodiaquine, and piperaquine and greater sensitivities to lumefantrine and
mefloquine, an observation consistent with DP selection pressure. Compared to
results for isolates from 2010 to 2013, the sensitivities of 2016 community
isolates to chloroquine, amodiaquine, and piperaquine improved (geometric mean
50% inhibitory concentrations [IC50] = 248, 76.9, and 19.1 nM in 2010 to 2013 and
33.4, 14.9, and 7.5 nM in 2016, respectively [P < 0.001 for all comparisons]),
the sensitivity to lumefantrine decreased (IC50 = 3.0 nM in 2010 to 2013 and 5.4 
nM in 2016 [P < 0.001]), and the sensitivity to dihydroartemisinin was unchanged 
(IC50 = 1.4 nM). These changes were accompanied by decreased prevalence of
transporter mutations associated with aminoquinoline resistance and low
prevalence of polymorphisms recently associated with resistance to artemisinins
or piperaquine. Antimalarial drug sensitivities are changing in Uganda, but novel
genotypes associated with DP treatment failure in Asia are not prevalent.
