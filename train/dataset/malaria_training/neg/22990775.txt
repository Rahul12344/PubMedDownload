Genetically modified Plasmodium parasites are central gene function reagents in
malaria research. The Rodent Malaria genetically modified DataBase (RMgmDB) (
www.pberghei.eu ) is a manually curated Web - based repository that contains
information on genetically modified rodent malaria parasites. It provides easy
and rapid access to information on the genotype and phenotype of genetically
modified mutant and reporter parasites. Here, we provide guidelines for
generating and describing rodent malaria parasite mutants. Standardization in
describing mutant genotypes and phenotypes is important not only to enhance
publication quality but also to facilitate cross-linking and mining data from
multiple sources, and should permit information derived from mutant parasites to 
be used in integrative system biology approaches. We also provide guidelines on
how to submit information to RMgmDB on non-published mutants, mutants that do not
exhibit a clear phenotype, as well as negative attempts to disrupt/mutate genes. 
Such information helps to prevent unnecessary duplication of experiments in
different laboratories, and can provide indirect evidence that these genes are
essential for blood-stage development.
