BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) detecting the histidine-rich protein 2 
(PfHRP2) have a central position for the management of Plasmodium falciparum
infections. Yet, variable detection of certain targeted motifs, low parasitaemia,
but also deletion of pfhrp2 gene or its homologue pfhrp3, may result in
false-negative RDT leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. This study
aimed at investigating the prevalence, and understanding the possible causes, of 
P. falciparum RDT-negative infections at Montpellier Academic Hospital, France.
METHODS: The prevalence of falsely-negative RDT results reported before and after
the introduction of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, as
part as the malaria screening strategy in January 2017, was analysed. Negative P.
falciparum RDT infections were screened for pfhrp2 or pfhrp3 deletion; and exons 
2 were sequenced to show a putative genetic diversity impairing PfHRP2 detection.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of P. falciparum negative RDTs from January 2006 
to December 2018 was low (3/446). Whereas no cases were reported from 2006 to
2016 (0/373), period during which the malaria diagnostic screen was based on
microscopy and RDT, prevalence increased up to 4.1% (3/73) between 2017 and 2018,
when molecular detection was implemented for primary screening. Neither pfhrp2/3 
deletion nor major variation in the frequency of repetitive epitopes could
explain these false-negative RDT results.
CONCLUSION: This paper demonstrates the presence of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes in
three P. falciparum RDT-negative infections and reviews the possible reasons for 
non-detection of HRP2/3 antigens in a non-endemic setting. It highlights the
emergence of falsely negative rapid diagnostic tests in a non-endemic setting and
draws attention on the risk of missing malaria cases with low parasitaemia
infections using the RDT plus microscopy-based strategy currently recommended by 
French authorities. The relevance of a novel diagnostic scheme based upon a LAMP 
assay is discussed.
