Previous research demonstrates that ADHD is considered a risk factor for
COVID-19. The current study attempts to investigate the relationships between
infection, mortality and recovery rates from coronavirus and the prevalence of
ADHD at the US statewide level. Based on information from 2011 regarding the
prevalence of ADHD across the US by state, findings suggest that, while there are
no correlations between ADHD and population size, infection and mortality rates
from coronavirus, recovery rates (recovery-population ratio) rise with the
prevalence of ADHD. Consequently, a possible explanation is that in coping with
the disease, ADHD might provide an evolutionary advantage. An example of this
phenomenon can be found in the gene that causes sickle-cell disease, which, as a 
non-dominant gene, helps cope with infection from malaria. If corroborated,
research findings may support the conclusion that coronavirus limitations in
special educational frameworks for ADHD would not be required or could be
relaxed.JEL Codes: H75, I12.
