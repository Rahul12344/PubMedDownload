Malaria parasites possess the remarkable ability to maintain chronic infections
that fail to elicit a protective immune response, characteristics that have
stymied vaccine development and cause people living in endemic regions to remain 
at risk of malaria despite previous exposure to the disease. These traits stem
from the tremendous antigenic diversity displayed by parasites circulating in the
field. For Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent of the human malaria
parasites, this diversity is exemplified by the variant gene family called var,
which encodes the major surface antigen displayed on infected red blood cells
(RBCs). This gene family exhibits virtually limitless diversity when var gene
repertoires from different parasite isolates are compared. Previous studies
indicated that this remarkable genome plasticity results from extensive ectopic
recombination between var genes during mitotic replication; however, the
molecular mechanisms that direct this process to antigen-encoding loci while the 
rest of the genome remains relatively stable were not determined. Using targeted 
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and long-read whole-genome sequencing, we show
that a single break within an antigen-encoding region of the genome can result in
a cascade of recombination events leading to the generation of multiple chimeric 
var genes, a process that can greatly accelerate the generation of diversity
within this family. We also found that recombinations did not occur randomly, but
rather high-probability, specific recombination products were observed
repeatedly. These results provide a molecular basis for previously described
structured rearrangements that drive diversification of this highly polymorphic
gene family.
