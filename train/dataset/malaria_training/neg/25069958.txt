HMIP-2 is a human quantitative trait locus affecting peripheral numbers, size and
hemoglobin composition of red blood cells, with a marked effect on the
persistence of the fetal form of hemoglobin, HbF, in adults. The locus consists
of multiple common variants in an enhancer region for MYB (chr 6q23.3), which
encodes the hematopoietic transcription factor cMYB. Studying a European
population cohort and four African-descended groups of patients with sickle cell 
anemia, we found that all share a set of two spatially separate HbF-promoting
alleles at HMIP-2, termed "A" and "B." These typically occurred together ("A-B") 
on European chromosomes, but existed on separate homologous chromosomes in
Africans. Using haplotype signatures for "A" and "B," we interrogated public
population datasets. Haplotypes carrying only "A" or "B" were typical for
populations in Sub-Saharan Africa. The "A-B" combination was frequent in
European, Asian, and Amerindian populations. Both alleles were infrequent in
tropical regions, possibly undergoing negative selection by geographical factors,
as has been reported for malaria with other hematological traits. We propose that
the ascertainment of worldwide distribution patterns for common, HbF-promoting
alleles can aid their further genetic characterization, including the
investigation of gene-environment interaction during human migration and
adaptation.
