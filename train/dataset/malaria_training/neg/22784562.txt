Although the role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) during malaria infection has been
studied extensively, such studies have focused exclusively on the role of Treg
during the blood stage of infection; little is known about the detailed
mechanisms of Tregs and sporozoite deposition in the dermis by mosquito bites. In
this paper we show that sporozoites introduced into the skin by mosquito bites
increase the mobility of skin Tregs and dendritic cells (DCs). We also show
differences in MHC class II and/or CD86 expression on skin-resident dendritic
cell subtypes and macrophages. From the observed decrease of the number of APCs
into draining lymph nodes, suppression of CD28 expression in conventional CD4 T
cells, and a low homeostatic proliferation of skin-migrated CD4 T found in nude
mice indicate that Tregs may play a fundamental role during the initial phase of 
malaria parasite inoculation into the mammalian host.
