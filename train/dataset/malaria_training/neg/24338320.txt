Malaria is wide spread in poor world and its burden has been assessed by the
enumeration of malarial parasites in blood of patients. This study was designed
to find a relationship between social structure, and spread of malaria in Khyber 
agency. The average parasite density was 2050 parasite/μl in Khyber Agency. Due
to economic and social setup most of the people have habit of sleeping in open
air thus playing role in high malaria prevalence and Plasmodium vivax remains the
prevalent species. Genetic study performed on 110 Blood samples showed less
genetic diversity for both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum. Eight
alleles were distinguished both for Pvmsp 3α and Pvmsp 3β in total of 20 and 39
amplified samples of P. vivax respectively. Out of 17 samples amplified for P.
falciparum 11 showed genotype K1 and 10 for MAD at Pfmsp-1 while 14 alleles were 
identified for 3D7/1C and two for FC27 of corresponding families of Pfmsp-2 gene.
This shows that Plasmodium parasites are not genetically diverse in Khyber
agency.
