Insecticidal fungi represent a promising alternative to chemical pesticides for
disease vector control. Here, we show that the pathogenic fungus Beauveria
bassiana exports a microRNA-like RNA (bba-milR1) that hijacks the host
RNA-interference machinery in mosquito cells by binding to Argonaute 1 (AGO1).
bba-milR1 is highly expressed during fungal penetration of the mosquito
integument, and suppresses host immunity by silencing expression of the mosquito 
Toll receptor ligand Sp√§tzle 4 (Spz4). Later, upon entering the hemocoel,
bba-milR1 expression is decreased, which avoids induction of the host proteinase 
CLIPB9 that activates the melanization response. Thus, our results indicate that 
the pathogen deploys a cross-kingdom small-RNA effector that attenuates host
immunity and facilitates infection.
