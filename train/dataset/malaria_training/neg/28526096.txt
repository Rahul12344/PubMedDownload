BACKGROUND: Adhesin proteins are used by Plasmodium parasites to bind and invade 
target cells. Hence, characterising molecules that participate in reticulocyte
interaction is key to understanding the molecular basis of Plasmodium vivax
invasion. This study focused on predicting functionally restricted regions of the
P. vivax GPI-anchored micronemal antigen (PvGAMA) and characterising their
reticulocyte binding activity.
RESULTS: The pvgama gene was initially found in P. vivax VCG-I strain schizonts. 
According to the genetic diversity analysis, PvGAMA displayed a size polymorphism
very common for antigenic P. vivax proteins. Two regions along the antigen
sequence were highly conserved among species, having a negative natural selection
signal. Interestingly, these regions revealed a functional role regarding
preferential target cell adhesion.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study describes PvGAMA reticulocyte binding
properties for the first time. Conserved functional regions were predicted
according to natural selection analysis and their binding ability was confirmed. 
These findings support the notion that PvGAMA may have an important role in P.
vivax merozoite adhesion to its target cells.
