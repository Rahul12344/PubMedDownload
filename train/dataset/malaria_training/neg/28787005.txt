The genetic diversity in Plasmodium falciparum antigens is a major hurdle in
developing an effective malaria vaccine. Protective efficacy of the vaccine is
dependent on the polymorphic alleles of the vaccine candidate antigens.
Therefore, we investigated the genetic diversity of the potential vaccine
candidate antigens i.e. msp-1, msp-2, glurp, csp and pfs25 from field isolates of
P.falciparum and determined the natural immune response against the synthetic
peptide of these antigens. Genotyping was performed using Sanger method and size 
of alleles, multiplicity of infection, heterogeneity and recombination rate were 
analyzed. Asexual stage antigens were highly polymorphic with 55 and 50 unique
alleles in msp-1 and msp-2 genes, respectively. The MOI for msp-1 and msp-2 were 
1.67 and 1.28 respectively. A total 59 genotype was found in glurp gene with 8
types of amino acid repeats in the conserved part of RII repeat region. The
number of NANP repeats from 40 to 44 was found among 55% samples in csp gene
while pfs25 was found almost conserved with only two amino acid substitution
site. The level of genetic diversity in the present study population was very
similar to that from Asian countries. A higher IgG response was found in the
B-cell epitopes of msp-1 and csp antigens and higher level of antibodies against 
csp B-cell epitope and glurp antigen were recorded with increasing age groups.
Significantly, higher positive responses were observed in the csp antigen among
the samples with â‰¥42 NANP repeats. The present finding showed extensive diversity
in the asexual stage antigens.
