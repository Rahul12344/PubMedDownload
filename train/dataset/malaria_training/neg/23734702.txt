BACKGROUND: Plasmodium knowlesi is the fifth species identified to cause malaria 
in humans and is often misdiagnosed as Plasmodium malariae due to morphological
similarities. The development of an inexpensive, serological detection method
utilizing antibodies specific to P. knowlesi would be a valuable tool for
diagnosis. However, the identification of specific antigens for these parasites
remains a major challenge for generating such assays. In this study, surface
protein containing an altered thrombospondin repeat domain (SPATR) was selected
as a potentially specific antigen from P. knowlesi. Its multistage expression by 
sporozoites, asexual erythrocytic forms and gametocytes, along with its possible 
role in liver cell invasion, suggests that SPATR could be used as a biomarker for
diagnosis of P. knowlesi.
METHODS: The spatr gene from P. knowlesi was codon optimized and cloned
(pkhspatr). Recombinant pkHSPATR protein was expressed, purified, and evaluated
for its sensitivity and specificity in immunoblot and ELISA-based assays for
detecting P. knowlesi infection.
RESULTS: The recombinant pkHSPATR protein allows sensitive detection of human P. 
knowlesi infection in serum samples by immunoblot and ELISA.
CONCLUSIONS: With further research, recombinant pkHSPATR protein could be
exploited as a marker for detection of P. knowlesi infection in humans.
Therefore, this finding should contribute to the development of immunodiagnostic 
assays for the species-specific detection of malaria.
