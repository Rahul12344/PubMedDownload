BACKGROUND: Plasmodium cynomolgi, a non-human primate malaria parasite species,
has been an important model parasite since its discovery in 1907. Similarities in
the biology of P. cynomolgi to the closely related, but less tractable, human
malaria parasite P. vivax make it the model parasite of choice for liver biology 
and vaccine studies pertinent to P. vivax malaria. Molecular and genome-scale
studies of P. cynomolgi have relied on the current reference genome sequence,
which remains highly fragmented with 1,649 unassigned scaffolds and little
representation of the subtelomeres.  Methods: Using long-read sequence data
(Pacific Biosciences SMRT technology), we assembled and annotated a new reference
genome sequence, PcyM, sourced from an Indian rhesus monkey. We compare the newly
assembled genome sequence with those of several other Plasmodium species,
including a re-annotated P. coatneyi assembly.
RESULTS: The new PcyM genome assembly is of significantly higher quality than the
existing reference, comprising only 56 pieces, no gaps and an improved average
gene length. Detailed manual curation has ensured a comprehensive annotation of
the genome with 6,632 genes, nearly 1,000 more than previously attributed to P.
cynomolgi. The new assembly also has an improved representation of the
subtelomeric regions, which account for nearly 40% of the sequence. Within the
subtelomeres, we identified more than 1300 Plasmodium interspersed repeat ( pir) 
genes, as well as a striking expansion of 36 methyltransferase pseudogenes that
originated from a single copy on chromosome 9.
CONCLUSIONS: The manually curated PcyM reference genome sequence is an important 
new resource for the malaria research community. The high quality and contiguity 
of the data have enabled the discovery of a novel expansion of methyltransferase 
in the subtelomeres, and illustrates the new comparative genomics capabilities
that are being unlocked by complete reference genomes.
