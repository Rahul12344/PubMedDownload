Characterization of HIV-1 subtype diversity in regions where vaccine trials are
conducted is critical for vaccine development and testing. This study describes
the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 within a tea-plantation community cohort in
Kericho, Kenya. Sixty-three incident infections were ascertained in the HIV and
Malaria Cohort Study conducted in Kericho from 2003 to 2006. HIV-1 strains from
58 of those individuals were full genome characterized and compared to two
previous Kenyan studies describing 41 prevalent infections from a blood bank
survey (1999-2000) and 21 infections from a higher-risk cohort containing a mix
of incident and prevalent infections (2006). Among the 58 strains from the
community cohort, 43.1% were pure subtypes (36.2% A1, 5.2% C, and 1.7% G) and
56.9% were inter-subtype recombinants (29.3% A1D, 8.6% A1CD, 6.9% A1A2D, 5.2%
A1C, 3.4% A1A2CD, and 3.4% A2D). This diversity and the resulting genetic
distance between the observed strains will need to be addressed when vaccine
immunogens are chosen. In consideration of current vaccine development efforts,
the strains from these three studies were compared to five candidate vaccines
(each of which are viral vectored, carrying inserts corresponding to parts of
gag, pol, and envelope), which have been developed for possible use in
sub-Saharan Africa. The sequence comparison between the observed strains and the 
candidate vaccines indicates that in the presence of diverse recombinants, a
bivalent vaccine is more likely to provide T-cell epitope coverage than
monovalent vaccines even when the inserts of the bivalent vaccine are not
subtype-matched to the local epidemic.
