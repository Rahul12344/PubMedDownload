BACKGROUND: Plasmodium ookinete surface proteins as post-fertilization target
antigens are potential malaria transmission-blocking vaccine (TBV) candidates.
Putative secreted ookinete protein 25 (PSOP25) is a highly conserved ookinete
surface protein, and has been shown to be a promising novel TBV target. Here, we 
further investigated the TBV activities of the full-length recombinant PSOP25
(rPSOP25) protein in Plasmodium berghei, and characterized the potential
functions of PSOP25 during the P. berghei life-cycle.
METHODS: We expressed the full-length P. berghei PSOP25 protein in a prokaryotic 
expression system, and developed polyclonal mouse antisera and a monoclonal
antibody (mAb) against the recombinant protein. Indirect immunofluorescence assay
(IFA) and Western blot were used to test the specificity of antibodies. The
transmission-blocking (TB) activities of antibodies were evaluated by the in
vitro ookinete conversion assay and by direct mosquito feeding assay (DFA).
Finally, the function of PSOP25 during Plasmodium development was studied by
deleting the psop25 gene.
RESULTS: Both polyclonal mouse antisera and anti-rPSOP25 mAb recognized the
PSOP25 proteins in the parasites, and IFA showed the preferential expression of
PSOP25 on the surface of zygotes, retorts and mature ookinetes. In vitro, these
antibodies significantly inhibited ookinetes formation in an antibody
concentration-dependent manner. In DFA, mice immunized with the rPSOP25 and those
receiving passive transfer of the anti-rPSOP25 mAb reduced the prevalence of
mosquito infection by 31.2 and 26.1%, and oocyst density by 66.3 and 63.3%,
respectively. Genetic knockout of the psop25 gene did not have a detectable
impact on the asexual growth of P. berghei, but significantly affected the
maturation of ookinetes and the formation of midgut oocysts.
CONCLUSIONS: The full-length rPSOP25 could elicit strong antibody response in
mice. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against PSOP25 could effectively block
the formation of ookinetes in vitro and transmission of the parasites to
mosquitoes. Genetic manipulation study indicated that PSOP25 is required for
ookinete maturation in P. berghei. These results support further testing of the
PSOP25 orthologs in human malaria parasites as promising TBV candidates.
