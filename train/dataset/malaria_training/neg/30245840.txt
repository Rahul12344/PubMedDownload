The human ACKR1 gene encodes a glycoprotein expressing the Duffy blood group
antigens (Fy). The Duffy protein acts as a receptor for distinct pro-inflammatory
cytokines and malaria parasites. We determined the haplotypes of the ACKR1 gene
in a population inhabiting a malaria-endemic area. We collected blood samples
from 60 healthy volunteers in Ethiopia's southwestern low-altitude tropical
region. An assay was devised to amplify the ACKR1 gene as a single amplicon and
determine its genomic sequence. All haplotypes were resolved at 5178 nucleotides 
each, covering the coding sequence (CDS) of the ACKR1 gene and including the 5'- 
and 3'-untranslated regions (UTR), intron 1, and the 5'- and 3'-flanking regions.
When necessary, allele-specific PCR with nucleotide sequencing or length
polymorphism analysis was applied. Among the 120 chromosomes analyzed, 18 ACKR1
alleles were confirmed without ambiguity. We found 18 single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs); only one SNP was novel. The non-coding sequences harbored
14 SNPs. No SNP, other than c.-67T>C, indicative of a non-functional allele, was 
detected. We described haplotypes of the ACKR1 gene in an autochthonous
East-African population and found 18 distinct ACKR1 alleles. These long-range
alleles are useful as templates to phase and analyze next-generation sequencing
data, thus enhancing the reliability of clinical diagnostics.
