Novel strategies to directly thwart malaria transmission are needed to maintain
the gains achieved by current control measures. Transmission-blocking
interventions (TBIs), namely vaccines and drugs targeting parasite or mosquito
molecules required for vector-stage parasite development, have been recognized as
promising approaches for preventing malaria transmission. However, the number of 
TBI targets is limited and their degree of conservation among the major
vector-parasite systems causing human disease is unclear. Therefore, discovery
and characterization of novel proteins involved in vector-stage parasite
development of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax is paramount. We mined 
the recent Anopheles gambiae midgut lipid raft proteome for putative
mosquito-derived TBI targets and characterized a secreted glycoconjugate of
unknown function, AgSGU. We analyzed molecular variation in this protein among a 
range of anopheline mosquitoes, determined its transcriptomic and proteomic
profiles, and conducted both standard and direct membrane feeding assays with P. 
falciparum (lab/field) and P. vivax (field) in An. gambiae and Anopheles dirus.
We observed that α-AgSGU antibodies significantly reduced midgut infection
intensity for both lab and field isolates of P. falciparum in An. gambiae and An.
dirus. However, no transmission-reducing effects were noted when comparable
concentrations of antibodies were included in P. vivax-infected blood meals.
Although antibodies against AgSGU exhibit transmission-reducing activity, the
high antibody titer required for achieving 80% reduction in oocyst intensity
precludes its consideration as a malaria mosquito-based TBI candidate. However,
our results suggest that P. falciparum and P. vivax ookinetes use a different
repertoire of midgut surface glycoproteins for invasion and that α-AgSGU
antibodies, as well as antibodies to other mosquito-midgut microvillar surface
proteins, may prove useful as tools for interrogating Plasmodium-mosquito
interactions.
