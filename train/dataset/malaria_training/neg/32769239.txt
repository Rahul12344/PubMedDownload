Background: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is widely used in India
and many generic preparations are available. Delayed response has been reported, 
suggesting inadequate response to artesunate (AS) or genotypic resistance. We
designed a prospective observational study to assess the therapeutic response,
elaborate pharmacokinetics of AS and identify Plasmodium falciparum kelch 13
(pfk13) propeller gene polymorphisms among hospitalized Indian patients with
severe malaria.
Methods: We collected blood samples from adult patients with severe P. falciparum
or mixed (P. falciparum and P. vivax) malaria on ACT. We calculated the parasite 
clearance (CL) half-life using the Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network
(WWARN) online parasite clearance estimator (PCE). We used the liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectrophoto-metry method for simultaneous
quantification of AS and dihydroartemisinin. We genotyped longitudinally archived
DNA samples obtained pre-treatment (day 0) to study the point mutations in the
pfk13 propeller domain.
Results: A total of 54 patients with malaria were included, with a majority
fulfilling the definitions of severe malaria. The median parasite CL slope
half-life was estimated to be 6.44 hours (interquartile range 4.79-10.24). AS
pharmacokinetics, assessed in 17 patients, were found to be similar in the groups
with rapid (<48 hours) and slow CL (>48 hours) of parasites. No known mutations
associated with artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia were observed in our
study participants.
Conclusions: Slow parasite CL was seen with a high parasite burden without
genotypic evidence of AS resistance. There is a need to standardize definitions
of therapeutic efficacy of AS in cases of severe malaria.
