In addition to being used to treat malaria, artemisinin (Art) can be used as an
anti-inflammatory and antitumor agent. In this study, we evaluated the effects of
Art on osteoclast formation and activation and on the development of breast
cancer cells in bone. To evaluate the effect of Art on osteoclast differentiation
in vitro, we treated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) with various
concentrations of Art and evaluated the expression of genes and proteins involved
in osteoclast formation. We also performed cell counting kit-8 assays to evaluate
the toxicity of Art in BMMs and MDA-MB-231 cells. We also performed Transwell
assays, wound-healing assays, colony formation assays, and cell apoptosis assays 
to evaluate the effect of Art in MDA-MB-231 cells. We also evaluated the effect
of Art in an in vivo osteoclast bone resorption assay using a nude mouse model.
We demonstrated that Art inhibits the differentiation and establishment of
osteoclasts even though Art is not toxic to osteoclasts. In addition, Art reduced
expression of genes involved in osteoclast formation and inhibited osteoclast
bone resorption in a concentration-dependent manner. Based on our data, we
believe that Art can inhibit proliferation of breast cancer cells by activating
apoptosis pathways, and inhibit osteoclast formation and differentiation by
inhibiting activation of cathepsin K, ATPase H+ transporting V0 subunit D2,
nuclear factor of activated T cells 1, calcitonin receptor, and
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and by inhibiting nuclear factor-κB
activation.
