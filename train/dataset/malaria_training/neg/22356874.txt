BACKGROUND: The majority of Haemosporida species infect birds or reptiles, but
many important genera, including Plasmodium, infect mammals. Dipteran vectors
shared by avian, reptilian and mammalian Haemosporida, suggest multiple invasions
of Mammalia during haemosporidian evolution; yet, phylogenetic analyses have
detected only a single invasion event. Until now, several important
mammal-infecting genera have been absent in these analyses. This study focuses on
the evolutionary origin of Polychromophilus, a unique malaria genus that only
infects bats (Microchiroptera) and is transmitted by bat flies (Nycteribiidae).
METHODS: Two species of Polychromophilus were obtained from wild bats caught in
Switzerland. These were molecularly characterized using four genes (asl, clpc,
coI, cytb) from the three different genomes (nucleus, apicoplast, mitochondrion).
These data were then combined with data of 60 taxa of Haemosporida available in
GenBank. Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood and a range of rooting methods
were used to test specific hypotheses concerning the phylogenetic relationships
between Polychromophilus and the other haemosporidian genera.
RESULTS: The Polychromophilus melanipherus and Polychromophilus murinus samples
show genetically distinct patterns and group according to species. The Bayesian
tree topology suggests that the monophyletic clade of Polychromophilus falls
within the avian/saurian clade of Plasmodium and directed hypothesis testing
confirms the Plasmodium origin.
CONCLUSION: Polychromophilus' ancestor was most likely a bird- or
reptile-infecting Plasmodium before it switched to bats. The invasion of mammals 
as hosts has, therefore, not been a unique event in the evolutionary history of
Haemosporida, despite the suspected costs of adapting to a new host. This was,
moreover, accompanied by a switch in dipteran host.
