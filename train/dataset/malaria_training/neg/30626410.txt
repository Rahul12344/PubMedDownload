BACKGROUND: As resistance to insecticides increases in disease vectors, it has
become exceedingly important to monitor populations for susceptibility. Most
studies of field populations of Aedes aegypti have largely characterized
resistance patterns at the spatial scale of the city or country, which may not be
completely informative given that insecticide application occurs at the scale of 
the house or city block. Phenotypic resistance to pyrethroids dominates in Ae.
aegypti, and it has been partially explained by mutations in the voltage-gated
sodium channel gene. Here, we assess community-level patterns of four knockdown
resistance (kdr) haplotypes (C1534/I1016, F1534/I1016, C1534/V1016 and
F1534/V1016) in Ae. aegypti in 24 randomly chosen city blocks from a city in
Yucatán State, Mexico, during both the dry and wet season and over two years.
RESULTS: Three of the four haplotypes, C1534/I1016, C1534/V1016 and F1534/V1016
were heterogeneous between city blocks at all four sampling time points, and the 
double mutant haplotype, C1534/I1016, showed a significant increase following the
wet season. The F1534/I1016 haplotype was rarely detected, similar to other
studies. However, when haplotype frequencies were aggregated to a coarser spatial
scale, the differences in space and time were obscured.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide empirical evidence that the selection of kdr
alleles is occurring at fine spatial scales, indicating that future studies
should include this scale to better understand evolutionary processes of
resistance in natural populations.
