Identifying the genetic determinants of phenotypes that impact disease severity
is of fundamental importance for the design of new interventions against malaria.
Here we present a rapid genome-wide approach capable of identifying multiple
genetic drivers of medically relevant phenotypes within malaria parasites via a
single experiment at single gene or allele resolution. In a proof of principle
study, we found that a previously undescribed single nucleotide polymorphism in
the binding domain of the erythrocyte binding like protein (EBL) conferred a
dramatic change in red blood cell invasion in mutant rodent malaria parasites
Plasmodium yoelii. In the same experiment, we implicated merozoite surface
protein 1 (MSP1) and other polymorphic proteins, as the major targets of
strain-specific immunity. Using allelic replacement, we provide functional
validation of the substitution in the EBL gene controlling the growth rate in the
blood stages of the parasites.
