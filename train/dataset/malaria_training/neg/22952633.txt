BACKGROUND: In the Peruvian Amazon, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax
malaria are endemic in rural areas, where microscopy is not available. Malaria
rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) provide quick and accurate diagnosis. However,
pfhrp2 gene deletions may limit the use of histidine-rich protein-2 (PfHRP2)
detecting RDTs. Further, cross-reactions of P. falciparum with P. vivax-specific 
test lines and vice versa may impair diagnostic specificity.
METHODS: Thirteen RDT products were evaluated on 179 prospectively collected
malaria positive samples. Species diagnosis was performed by microscopy and
confirmed by PCR. Pfhrp2 gene deletions were assessed by PCR.
RESULTS: Sensitivity for P. falciparum diagnosis was lower for PfHRP2 compared to
P. falciparum-specific Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (Pf-pLDH)-detecting RDTs 
(71.6% vs. 98.7%, p<0.001). Most (19/21) false negative PfHRP2 results were
associated with pfhrp2 gene deletions (25.7% of 74 P. falciparum samples).
Diagnostic sensitivity for P. vivax (101 samples) was excellent, except for two
products. In 10/12 P. vivax-detecting RDT products, cross-reactions with the
PfHRP2 or Pf-pLDH line occurred at a median frequency of 2.5% (range 0%-10.9%) of
P. vivax samples assessed. In two RDT products, two and one P. falciparum samples
respectively cross-reacted with the Pv-pLDH line. Two Pf-pLDH/pan-pLDH-detecting 
RDTs showed excellent sensitivity with few (1.0%) cross-reactions but showed
faint Pf-pLDH lines in 24.7% and 38.9% of P. falciparum samples.
CONCLUSION: PfHRP2-detecting RDTs are not suitable in the Peruvian Amazon due to 
pfhrp2 gene deletions. Two Pf-pLDH-detecting RDTs performed excellently and are
promising RDTs for this region although faint test lines are of concern.
