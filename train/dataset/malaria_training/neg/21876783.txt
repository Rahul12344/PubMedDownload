Members of the phylum Apicomplexa, which includes the species Plasmodium,
Eimeria, Toxoplasma, and Babesia amongst others, are the most successful
intracellular pathogens known to humankind. The widespread acquisition of
antimicrobial resistance to most drugs used to date has sparked a great deal of
research and commercial interest in the development of vaccines as alternative
control strategies. A few antigens from the asexual and sexual stages of
apicomplexan development have been identified and their genes characterised;
however, the fine cellular and molecular details of the effector mechanisms
crucial for parasite inhibition and stimulation of protective immunity are still 
not entirely understood. This paper provides an overview of what is currently
known about the protective immune response against the various types of
apicomplexan parasites and focuses mainly on the similarities of these pathogens 
and their host interaction. Finally, the evolutionary relationships of these
parasites and their hosts, as well as the modulation of immune functions that are
critical in determining the outcome of the infection by these pathogenic
organisms, are discussed.
