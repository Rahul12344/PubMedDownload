BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) has
contributed substantially to the decrease in malaria-related morbidity and
mortality. The emergence of Plasmodium falciparum parasites resistant to
artemisinin derivatives in Southeast Asia and the risk of their spread or of
local emergence in sub-Saharan Africa are a major threat to public health. This
study thus set out to estimate the proportion of P. falciparum isolates, with
Pfkelch13 gene mutations associated with artemisinin resistance previously
detected in Southeast Asia.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected in two sites of Bangui, the capital of the 
Central African Republic (CAR) from 2017 to 2019. DNA was extracted and nested
PCR were carried out to detect Plasmodium species and mutations in the propeller 
domain of the Pfkelch13 gene for P. falciparum samples.
RESULTS: A total of 255 P. falciparum samples were analysed. Plasmodium ovale DNA
was found in four samples (1.57%, 4/255). Among the 187 samples with
interpretable Pfkelch13 sequences, four samples presented a mutation (2.1%,
4/187), including one non-synonymous mutation (Y653N) (0.5%, 1/187). This
mutation has never been described as associated with artemisinin resistance in
Southeast Asia and its in vitro phenotype is unknown.
CONCLUSION: This preliminary study indicates the absence of Pfkelch13 mutant
associated with artemisinin resistance in Bangui. However, this limited study
needs to be extended by collecting samples across the whole country along with
the evaluation of in vitro and in vivo phenotype profiles of Pfkelch13 mutant
parasites to estimate the risk of artemisinin resistance in the CAR.
