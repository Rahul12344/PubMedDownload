BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a major public health problem, affecting mainly
low-and middle-income countries. The management of this parasitic disease is
challenged by ever increasing drug resistance. This study, investigated the
therapeutic efficacy, tolerability and safety of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and
artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ), used as first-line drugs to treat uncomplicated
malaria in Lambaréné, Gabon.
METHODS: A non-randomized clinical trial was conducted between October 2017 and
March 2018 to assess safety, clinical and parasitological efficacy of fixed-doses
of AL and AS-AQ administered to treat uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria
in children aged from 6 months to 12 years. After 50 children were treated with
AL, another 50 children received ASAQ. The 2009 World Health Organization
protocol for monitoring of the efficacy of anti‑malarial drugs was followed.
Molecular markers msp1 and msp2 were used to differentiate recrudescence and
reinfection. For the investigation of artemisinin resistant markers, gene
mutations in Pfk13 were screened.
RESULTS: Per-protocol analysis on day 28 showed a PCR corrected cure rate of 97% 
(95% CI 86-100) and 95% (95% CI 84-99) for AL and AS-AQ, respectively. The most
frequent adverse event in both groups was asthenia. No mutations in the kelch-13 
gene associated with artemisinin resistance were identified. All participants had
completed microscopic parasite clearance by day 3 post-treatment.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that AL and AS-AQ remain efficacious,
well-tolerated, and are safe to treat uncomplicated malaria in children from
Lambaréné. However, a regular monitoring of efficacy and a study of molecular
markers of drug resistance to artemisinin in field isolates is essential. Trial
