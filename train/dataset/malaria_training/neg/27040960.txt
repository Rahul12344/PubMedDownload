G6PD is a housekeeping gene expressed in all cells. Glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PD) is part of the pentose phosphate pathway, and its main
physiologic role is to provide NADPH. G6PD deficiency, one of the commonest
inherited enzyme abnormalities in humans, arises through one of many possible
mutations, most of which reduce the stability of the enzyme and its level as red 
cells age. G6PD-deficient persons are mostly asymptomatic, but they can develop
severe jaundice during the neonatal period and acute hemolytic anemia when they
ingest fava beans or when they are exposed to certain infections or drugs. G6PD
deficiency is a global health issue.
