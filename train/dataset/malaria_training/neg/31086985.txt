BACKGROUND: Namibia has made significant gains in the fight against malaria, with
a target of elimination by 2023. We examined the genotype and allele frequencies 
of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency to inform decisions on
primaquine use, as we recently detected clusters of Plasmodium ovale curtisi in
Kavango.
METHODS: A multistaged cross-sectional sampling method was used to enrol 212
children 2-9 y of age from schools and clinics in the Okavango and Zambezi
regions of northern Namibia. Genotypes for the 202 G→A and 376 A→G mutations were
assigned by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism.
RESULTS: Of the 212 subjects enrolled, genotypes were available for 210, made up 
of 61 males and 149 females. G6PD-deficient males (hemizygotes) and females
(homozygotes) constituted 3.27% (2/61) and 0.0% (0/149), respectively. Female
heterozygotes (AA- and BA-) constituted 10.07% (15/149), while G6PD wild-type
males (with A or B haplotype) and females (with AA, BB or AB haplotypes)
consisted of 96.72% (59/61) and 89.93% (134/149), respectively. The A-, A and B
allele frequencies were 0.0474, 0.3036 and 0.6490, respectively. Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium tests for female genotype frequencies did not show deviation
(p=0.29).
CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of G6PD deficiency alleles in males in the Kavango and
Zambezi regions of northern Namibia constitute 3.27%, a first report to inform
policy on primaquine role out.
