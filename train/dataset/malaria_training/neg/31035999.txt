BACKGROUND: The high proportion of human cases due to the simian malaria parasite
Plasmodium knowlesi in Malaysia is a cause of concern, as they can be severe and 
even fatal. Merozoite surface protein 7 (MSP7) is a multigene family which forms 
a non-covalent complex with MSP-1 prior to receptor-ligand recognition in
Plasmodium falciparum and thus an important antigen for vaccine development.
However, no study has been done in any of the ortholog family members in P.
knowlesi from clinical samples. This study investigates the level of
polymorphism, haplotypes, and natural selection acting at the pkmsp-7D gene in
clinical samples from Malaysia.
METHODS: Thirty-six full-length pkmsp7D gene sequences (along with the reference 
H-strain: PKNH_1266000) obtained from clinical isolates of Malaysia, which were
orthologous to pvmsp7H (PVX_082680) were downloaded from public databases.
Population genetic, evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses were performed to
determine the level of genetic diversity, polymorphism, recombination and natural
selection.
RESULTS: Analysis of 36 full-length pkmsp7D sequences identified 147 SNPs (91
non-synonymous and 56 synonymous substitutions). Nucleotide diversity across the 
full-length gene was higher than its ortholog in Plasmodium vivax (msp7H).
Region-wise analysis of the gene indicated that the nucleotide diversity at the
central region was very high (π = 0.14) compared to the 5' and 3' regions. Most
hyper-variable SNPs were detected at the central domain. Multiple test for
natural selection indicated the central region was under strong positive natural 
selection however, the 5' and 3' regions were under negative/purifying selection.
Evidence of intragenic recombination were detected at the central region of the
gene. Phylogenetic analysis using full-length msp7D genes indicated there was no 
geographical clustering of parasite population.
CONCLUSIONS: High genetic diversity with hyper-variable SNPs and strong evidence 
of positive natural selection at the central region of MSP7D indicated exposure
of the region to host immune pressure. Negative selection at the 5' and the 3'
regions of MSP7D might be because of functional constraints at the unexposed
regions during the merozoite invasion process of P. knowlesi. No evidence of
geographical clustering among the clinical isolates from Malaysia indicated
uniform selection pressure in all populations. These findings highlight the
further evaluation of the regions and functional characterization of the protein 
as a potential blood stage vaccine candidate for P. knowlesi.
