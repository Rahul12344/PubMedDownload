Our understanding of the key phosphorylation-dependent signalling pathways in the
human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, remains rudimentary. Here we
address this issue for the essential cGMP-dependent protein kinase, PfPKG. By
employing chemical and genetic tools in combination with quantitative global
phosphoproteomics, we identify the phosphorylation sites on 69 proteins that are 
direct or indirect cellular targets for PfPKG. These PfPKG targets include
proteins involved in cell signalling, proteolysis, gene regulation, protein
export and ion and protein transport, indicating that cGMP/PfPKG acts as a
signalling hub that plays a central role in a number of core parasite processes. 
We also show that PfPKG activity is required for parasite invasion. This
correlates with the finding that the calcium-dependent protein kinase, PfCDPK1,
is phosphorylated by PfPKG, as are components of the actomyosin complex,
providing mechanistic insight into the essential role of PfPKG in parasite egress
and invasion.
