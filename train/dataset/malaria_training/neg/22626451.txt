PROBLEM: Pregnancy is a challenge to the maternal immune system as it must defend
the body against pathogens while at the same time develop immune tolerance
against the fetus growing inside the uterus. Despite ex vivo techniques being
used to understand these processes, in vivo techniques are missing.
METHOD OF STUDY: To directly study these phenomena, we have developed a new
microscope stage and surgical procedures for use in two-photon microscopy, for in
vivo observation of the mouse placenta.
RESULTS: These tools and surgical procedures demonstrate fetal and maternal blood
flow inside the labyrinth zone of the placenta, as well as its three dimensional 
structure. It was also useful to identify Plasmodium chabaudi-infected red blood 
cells inside this labyrinth zone.
CONCLUSION: We believe this technique will represent an important contribution
for expanding the available knowledge concerning cell dynamics and interactions
at the fetal-maternal interface.
