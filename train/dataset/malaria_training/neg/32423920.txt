Anopheles sinensis is a major malaria vector in Southeast Asia. Resistance to
pyrethroid insecticides in this species has impeded malaria control in the
region. Previous studies found that An. sinensis populations from Yunnan
Province, China were highly resistant to deltamethrin and did not carry mutations
in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene that cause knockdown resistance. In this
study, we tested the hypothesis that other genomic variants are associated with
the resistance phenotype. Using paired-end whole genome sequencing (DNA-seq), we 
generated 108 Gb of DNA sequence from deltamethrin -resistant and -susceptible
mosquito pools with an average coverage of 83.3× depth. Using a stringent
filtering method, we identified a total of 916,926 single nucleotide variants
(SNVs), including 32,240 non-synonymous mutations. A total of 958 SNVs differed
significantly in allele frequency between deltamethrin -resistant and
-susceptible mosquitoes. Of these, 43 SNVs were present within 37 genes that code
for immunity, detoxification, cuticular, and odorant proteins. A subset of 12
SNVs were randomly selected for genotyping of individual mosquitoes by polymerase
chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and showed
consistent allele frequencies with the pooled DNA-seq derived allele frequencies.
In addition, copy number variations (CNVs) were detected in 56 genes, including
33 that contained amplification alleles and 23 that contained deletion alleles in
resistant mosquitoes compared to susceptible mosquitoes. The genomic variants
described here provide a useful resource for future studies on the genetic
mechanism of insecticide resistance in this important malaria vector species.
