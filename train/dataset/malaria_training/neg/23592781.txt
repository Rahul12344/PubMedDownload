Anopheline mosquitoes are the only vectors of human malaria worldwide. It is now 
widely accepted that mosquito immune responses play a crucial role in restricting
Plasmodium development within the vector; therefore, further dissection of the
molecular mechanisms underlying these processes should inform new vector control 
strategies urgently needed to roll back the disease. Here, using genome-wide
transcriptional profiling, bioinformatics, and functional gene analysis, we
identify a new axis of mosquito resistance to monoclonal Plasmodium falciparum
infections that includes the AP-1 transcription factor Fos and the
transglutaminase 2 (TGase2), a cross-linking enzyme with known roles in wound
responses. We demonstrate that Fos regulates induction of TGase2 expression after
wounding but does not affect expression of the components of the well
characterized complement-like system. Silencing of Fos or of TGase2 aborts the
wounding-induced mosquito killing of P. falciparum. These results reveal multiple
signaling pathways that are required for efficient Plasmodium killing in
Anopheles gambiae.
