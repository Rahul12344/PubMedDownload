Aging is accompanied by imbalanced bone remodeling, elevated osteocyte apoptosis,
and decreased bone mass and mechanical properties; and improved pharmacologic
approaches to counteract bone deterioration with aging are needed. We examined
herein the effect of mefloquine, a drug used to treat malaria and systemic lupus 
erythematosus and shown to ameliorate bone loss in glucocorticoid-treated
patients, on bone mass and mechanical properties in young and old mice. Young
3.5-month-old and old 21-month-old female C57BL/6 mice received daily injections 
of 5 mg/kg/day mefloquine for 14 days. Aging resulted in the expected changes in 
bone volume and mechanical properties. In old mice mefloquine administration
reversed the lower vertebral cancellous bone volume and bone formation; and had
modest effects on cortical bone volume, thickness, and moment of inertia.
Mefloquine administration did not change the levels of the circulating bone
formation markers P1NP or alkaline phosphatase, whereas levels of the resorption 
marker CTX showed trends towards increase with mefloquine treatment. In addition,
and as expected, aging bones exhibited an accumulation of active
caspase3-expressing osteocytes and higher expression of apoptosis-related genes
compared to young mice, which were not altered by mefloquine administration at
either age. In young animals, mefloquine induced higher periosteal bone
formation, but lower endocortical bone formation. Further, osteoclast numbers
were higher on the endocortical bone surface and circulating CTX levels were
increased, in mefloquine- compared to vehicle-treated young mice. Consistent with
this, addition of mefloquine to bone marrow cells isolated from young mice led to
increased osteoclastic gene expression and a tendency towards increased
osteoclast numbers in vitro. Taken together our findings identify the age and
bone-site specific skeletal effects of mefloquine. Further, our results highlight
a beneficial effect of mefloquine administration on vertebral cancellous bone
mass in old animals, raising the possibility of using this pharmacologic
inhibitor to preserve skeletal health with aging.
