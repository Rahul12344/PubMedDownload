Background: As Indonesia works toward the goal of malaria elimination,
information is lacking on malaria epidemiology from some western provinces. As a 
basis for studies of antimalarial efficacy, we set out to survey parasite
carriage in 3 communities in North Sumatera Province.
Methods: A combination of active and passive detection of infection was carried
out among communities in Batubara, Langkat, and South Nias regencies.
Finger-prick blood samples from consenting individuals of all ages provided blood
films for microscopic examination and blood spots on filter paper. Plasmodium
species were identified using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of ribosomal
RNA genes and a novel assay that amplifies a conserved sequence specific for the 
sicavar gene family of Plasmodium knowlesi.
Results: Of 3731 participants, 614 (16.5%) were positive for malaria parasites by
microscopy. PCR detected parasite DNA in samples from 1169 individuals (31.3%).
In total, 377 participants (11.8%) harbored P. knowlesi. Also present were
Plasmodium vivax (14.3%), Plasmodium falciparum (10.5%) and Plasmodium malariae
(3.4%).
Conclusions: Amplification of sicavar is a specific and sensitive test for the
presence of P. knowlesi DNA in humans. Subpatent and asymptomatic multispecies
parasitemia is relatively common in North Sumatera, so PCR-based surveillance is 
required to support control and elimination activities.
