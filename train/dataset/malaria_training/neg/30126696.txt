The immunological factors that could explain the near absence of malaria
parasites in bonobos are not yet understood. The MHC class I system, however, may
play an important role, as particular bonobo allotypes show functional
similarities to HLA-B*53/B*78, which are considered to confer protection against 
malaria in humans.
