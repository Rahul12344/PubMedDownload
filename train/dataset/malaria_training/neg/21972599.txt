According to the sequences of small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene of
Plasmodium spp., universal and species-specific primers were designed to detect
malaria and identify species. 60 blood samples were detected by the established
nested PCR method. The results were compared with those of microscopic
examination. 40 blood samples were Plasmodium-positive by nested PCR with 22
samples of P. falciparum, 13 of P. vivas, 3 with P. falciparum and P. vivax mixed
infection, 1 of P. ovale and 1 of unclassified malaria infection. Altogether, the
coincidence between the results of nested PCR and microscopy stood for 76.7%
(46/60), including 18 of P. falciparum, 11 of P. vivax and 17 negatives. Further 
sequence analysis and real-time PCR were performed to detect blood samples with
discrepancy, results of which were the same as that of nested PCR. The amplified 
product of P. ovale was sequenced and showed 100% homology to the corresponding
part of P. ovale SSU rRNA gene sequence (GenBank No. DQ845247), which confirmed
that the case was imported ovale malaria.
