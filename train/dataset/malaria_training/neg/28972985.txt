BACKGROUND: Culex quinquefasciatus collected in Uganda, where no vector control
interventions directly targeting this species have been conducted, was used as a 
model to determine if it is possible to detect heterogeneities in selection
pressure driven by insecticide application targeting other insect species.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Population genetic structure was assessed through
microsatellite analysis, and the impact of insecticide pressure by genotyping two
target-site mutations, Vgsc-1014F of the voltage-gated sodium channel target of
pyrethroid and DDT insecticides, and Ace1-119S of the acetylcholinesterase gene, 
target of carbamate and organophosphate insecticides. No significant differences 
in genetic diversity were observed among populations by microsatellite markers
with HE ranging from 0.597 to 0.612 and low, but significant, genetic
differentiation among populations (FST = 0.019, P = 0.001). By contrast, the
insecticide-resistance markers display heterogeneous allelic distributions with
significant differences detected between Central Ugandan (urban) populations
relative to Eastern and Southwestern (rural) populations. In the central region, 
a frequency of 62% for Vgsc-1014F, and 32% for the Ace1-119S resistant allele
were observed. Conversely, in both Eastern and Southwestern regions the
Vgsc-1014F alleles were close to fixation, whilst Ace1-119S allele frequency was 
12% (although frequencies may be underestimated due to copy number variation at
both loci).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, the microsatellite and both insecticide
resistance target-site markers provide evidence that in the face of intense gene 
flow among populations, disjunction in resistance frequencies arise due to
intense local selection pressures despite an absence of insecticidal control
interventions targeting Culex.
