BACKGROUND: Anopheles sinensis is a dominant natural vector of Plasmodium vivax
in China, Taiwan, Japan, and Korea. Recent genome sequencing of An. sinensis
provides important insights into the genomic basis of vectorial capacity.
However, the lack of a physical genome map with chromosome assignment and
orientation of sequencing scaffolds hinders comparative analyses with other
genomes to infer evolutionary changes relevant to the vector capacity.
RESULTS: Here, a physical genome map for An. sinensis was constructed by
assigning 52 scaffolds onto the chromosomes using fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH). This chromosome-based genome assembly composes
approximately 36% of the total An. sinensis genome. Comparisons of 3955
orthologous genes between An. sinensis and Anopheles gambiae identified 361
conserved synteny blocks and 267 inversions fixed between these two lineages. The
rate of gene order reshuffling on the X chromosome is approximately 3.2 times
higher than that on the autosomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The physical map will facilitate detailed genomic analysis of An.
sinensis and contribute to understanding of the patterns and mechanisms of
large-scale genome rearrangements in anopheline mosquitoes.
