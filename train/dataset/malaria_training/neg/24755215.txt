The malaria parasite experiences a significant amount of redox stress during its 
growth in human erythrocytes and heavily relies on secretory functions for
pathogenesis. Most certainly, the parasite is equipped with machinery to tackle
perturbations in the secretory pathway, like the unfolded protein response
pathway in higher eukaryotes. Our bioinformatics analysis revealed the complete
absence of genes involved in the canonical unfolded protein response pathway in
Plasmodium falciparum. Accordingly, the parasite was unable to up-regulate
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperones or ER-associated degradation in response to
DTT-mediated ER stress. Global profiling of gene expression upon DTT treatment
revealed a network of AP2 transcription factors and their targets being
activated. The overall outcome was up-regulation of genes involved in protein
export and the sexual stage of the parasite life cycle culminating in
gametocytogenesis. Our results suggest that the malaria parasite uses ER stress
as a cue to switch to the transmissible sexual stages.
