BACKGROUND: Efforts to control malaria are demanding due to drug-resistant
parasites, insecticide-resistant mosquitoes and poor health infrastructure in
malaria-endemic countries. Therefore, the research and development of additional 
malaria control methods are crucial. For host-parasite interactions, surface
antigens and secreted proteins are likely to be involved in infectivity and
invasion of host tissues and therefore can be effective targets for control by
vaccines, drug therapy, or novel mosquito control methods. In an effort to
identify and characterize genes that may have a role in host-parasite
interaction, this study describes the expression profile of Plasmodium falciparum
PF3D7_1363700.
METHODS: A P. falciparum gene, PF3D7_1363700, was identified by a search of the
annotated Plasmodium genome database. Protein alignments of PF3D7_1363700
orthologues from various Plasmodium species were performed to demonstrate protein
similarity. Transcript expression profiles of PF3D7_1363700 were determined via
reverse-transcriptase PCR and protein expression was investigated by
immunofluorescence assays, western blot analysis and green fluorescent
trafficking studies.
RESULTS: The PF3D7_1363700 protein demonstrates significant similarity with
orthologues in other Plasmodium species and appears to be unique to
Apicomplexans. The PF3D7_1363700 transcription profile demonstrated expression
during the intra-erythrocytic, oocyst sporozoite, and salivary gland sporozoite
stages while the PF3D7_1363700 protein was only detected during the
intra-erythrocytic stages.
CONCLUSIONS: This research utilized an in silico approach to identify a
well-conserved protein known as PF3D7_1363700. By molecular, biochemical and
cellular analyses, PF3D7_1363700 was discovered to be an
intra-erythrocytic-specific stage protein that is unique to Apicomplexans.
