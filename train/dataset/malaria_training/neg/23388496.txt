Analyzing molecular determinants of Plasmodium parasite cell death is a promising
approach for exploring new avenues in the fight against malaria. Three major
forms of cell death (apoptosis, necrosis and autophagic cell death) have been
described in multicellular organisms but which cell death processes exist in
protozoa is still a matter of debate. Here we suggest that all three types of
cell death occur in Plasmodium liver-stage parasites. Whereas typical molecular
markers for apoptosis and necrosis have not been found in the genome of
Plasmodium parasites, we identified genes coding for putative autophagy-marker
proteins and thus concentrated on autophagic cell death. We characterized the
Plasmodium berghei homolog of the prominent autophagy marker protein Atg8/LC3 and
found that it localized to the apicoplast. A relocalization of PbAtg8 to
autophagosome-like vesicles or vacuoles that appear in dying parasites was not,
however, observed. This strongly suggests that the function of this protein in
liver-stage parasites is restricted to apicoplast biology.
