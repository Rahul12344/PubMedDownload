BACKGROUND: The recent spread of artemisinin (ART)-resistant Plasmodium
falciparum represents an emerging global threat to public health. In Southeast
Asia, the C580Y mutation of kelch13 (k13) is the dominant mutation of
ART-resistant P. falciparum. Therefore, a simple method for the detection of
C580Y mutation is urgently needed to enable widespread routine surveillance in
the field. The aim of this study is to develop a new diagnostic procedure for the
C580Y mutation using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) combined with 
the MinION nanopore sequencer.
RESULTS: A LAMP assay for the k13 gene of P. falciparum to detect the C580Y
mutation was successfully developed. The detection limit of this procedure was 10
copies of the reference plasmid harboring the k13 gene within 60 min. Thereafter,
amplicon sequencing of the LAMP products using the MinION nanopore sequencer was 
performed to clarify the nucleotide sequences of the gene. The C580Y mutation was
identified based on the sequence data collected from MinION reads 30 min after
the start of sequencing. Further, clinical evaluation of the LAMP assay in 34
human blood samples collected from patients with P. falciparum malaria in
Indonesia revealed a positive detection rate of 100%. All LAMP amplicons of up to
12 specimens were simultaneously sequenced using MinION. The results of
sequencing were consistent with those of the conventional PCR and Sanger
sequencing protocol. All procedures from DNA extraction to variant calling were
completed within 3 h. The C580Y mutation was not found among these 34 P.
falciparum isolates in Indonesia.
CONCLUSIONS: An innovative method combining LAMP and MinION will enable simple,
rapid, and high-sensitivity detection of the C580Y mutation of P. falciparum,
even in resource-limited situations in developing countries.
