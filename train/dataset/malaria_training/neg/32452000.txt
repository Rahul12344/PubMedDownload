In the last few years, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been widely studied in
humans, and their relevance for physiological and pathological conditions has
been demonstrated. In parasites, there are only a few works, such as in
Plasmodium falciparum, where it was shown that an lncRNA regulates the expression
of a gene associated with immune system evasion, also indicating the relevance of
understanding the role of this class of RNAs in parasites. In Schistosoma
mansoni, in the last 2 years, there were four published articles related to the
annotation of lncRNAs in different life cycle stages using RNA-Seq libraries. In 
order to make this process of lncRNA identification and annotation more
accessible to biologists with no bioinformatics training, considering the growing
number of S. mansoni RNA-Seq libraries publicly available from different sources,
such as ovary tissues from bi-sex and single-sex infections, and the potential of
lncRNAs as therapeutic targets, we provide this step-by-step protocol of lncRNA
identification and quantification. This guide includes the download of RNA-Seq
libraries from a public database and reads processing and mapping against the
genome, transcript reconstruction, novel lncRNA identification, transcripts
expression level determination, and the identification of differentially
expressed lncRNAs.
