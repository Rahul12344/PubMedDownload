Severe forms of malaria infection, such as cerebral malaria (CM) and acute lung
injury (ALI), are mainly caused by the apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium
falciparum. Primary therapy with quinine or artemisinin derivatives is generally 
effective in controlling P. falciparum parasitemia, but mortality from CM and
other forms of severe malaria remains unacceptably high. Herein, we report the
design and synthesis of a novel carbon monoxide-releasing molecule (CO-RM;
ALF492) that fully protects mice against experimental CM (ECM) and ALI. ALF492
enables controlled CO delivery in vivo without affecting oxygen transport by
hemoglobin, the major limitation in CO inhalation therapy. The protective effect 
is CO dependent and induces the expression of heme oxygenase-1, which contributes
to the observed protection. Importantly, when used in combination with the
antimalarial drug artesunate, ALF492 is an effective adjunctive and adjuvant
treatment for ECM, conferring protection after the onset of severe disease. This 
study paves the way for the potential use of CO-RMs, such as ALF492, as
adjunctive/adjuvant treatment in severe forms of malaria infection.
