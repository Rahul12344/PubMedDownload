BACKGROUND: Frozen blood clots remaining after serum collection is an often
disregarded source of host and pathogen DNA due to troublesome handling and
suboptimal outcome.
METHODS: High-speed shaking of clot samples in a cell disruptor manufactured for 
homogenization of tissue and faecal specimens was evaluated for processing frozen
blood clots for DNA extraction. The method was compared to two commercial clot
protocols based on a chemical kit and centrifugation through a plastic sieve,
followed by the same DNA extraction protocol. Blood clots with different levels
of parasitaemia (1-1,000 p/μl) were prepared from parasite cultures to assess
sensitivity of PCR detection. In addition, clots retrieved from serum samples
collected within two epidemiological studies in Kenya (n = 630) were processed by
high speed shaking and analysed by PCR for detection of malaria parasites and the
human α-thalassaemia gene.
RESULTS: High speed shaking succeeded in fully dispersing the clots and the
method generated the highest DNA yield. The level of PCR detection of P.
falciparum parasites and the human thalassaemia gene was the same as samples
optimally collected with an anticoagulant. The commercial clot protocol and
centrifugation through a sieve failed to fully dissolve the clots and resulted in
lower sensitivity of PCR detection.
CONCLUSIONS: High speed shaking was a simple and efficacious method for
homogenizing frozen blood clots before DNA purification and resulted in PCR
templates of high quality both from humans and malaria parasites. This novel
method enables genetic studies from stored blood clots.
