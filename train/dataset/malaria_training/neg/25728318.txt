The sexual stage Pfs48/45 antigen is a well-established lead candidate for a
transmission blocking (TB) vaccine because of its critical role in parasite
fertilization. We have recently produced the carboxy-terminal 10C-fragment of
Pfs48/45 containing three known epitopes for TB antibodies as a chimera with the 
N-terminal region of GLURP (R0). The resulting fusion protein elicited high titer
TB antibodies in rodents. To increase the relatively low yield of correctly
folded Pfs48/45 we have generated a series of novel chimera truncating the
10C-fragments to 6 cysteine residues containing sub-units (6C). All constructs
harbor the major epitope I for TB antibodies. One of these sub-units (R0.6Cc),
produced high yields of correctly folded conformers, which could be purified by a
simple 2-step procedure. Purified R0.6Cc was stable and elicits high titer TB
antibodies in rats. The yield, purity and stability of R0.6Cc allows for further 
clinical development.
