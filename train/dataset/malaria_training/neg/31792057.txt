The Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP) is a sporozoite
surface protein whose role in sporozoite motility and cell invasion has made it
the leading candidate for a pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine. However, production
of high yields of soluble recombinant PfCSP, including its extensive NANP and
NVDP repeats, has proven problematic. Here, we report on the development and
characterization of a secreted, soluble, and stable full-length PfCSP (containing
4 NVDP and 38 NANP repeats) produced in the Lactococcus lactis expression system.
The recombinant full-length PfCSP, denoted PfCSP4/38, was produced initially with
a histidine tag and purified by a simple two-step procedure. Importantly, the
recombinant PfCSP4/38 retained a conformational epitope for antibodies as
confirmed by both in vivo and in vitro characterizations. We characterized this
complex protein by HPLC, light scattering, MS analysis, differential scanning
fluorimetry, CD, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting with conformation-dependent and
-independent mAbs, which confirmed it to be both pure and soluble. Moreover, we
found that the recombinant protein is stable at both frozen and
elevated-temperature storage conditions. When we used L. lactis-derived PfCSP4/38
to immunize mice, it elicited high levels of functional antibodies that had the
capacity to modify sporozoite motility in vitro We concluded that the reported
yield, purity, results of biophysical analyses, and stability of PfCSP4/38
warrant further consideration of using the L. lactis system for the production of
circumsporozoite proteins for preclinical and clinical applications in malaria
vaccine development.
