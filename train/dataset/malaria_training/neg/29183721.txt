Nucleosome assembly in P. falciparum could be the key process in maintaining its 
genomic integrity as DNA replicates more than once per cell cycle during several 
stages of its life cycle. Here, we report the functional characterization of
P. falciparum chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF1), which interacts with several
proteins namely PfCAF2, Histones, PfHP1 and others. Consistent with the above
findings, we demonstrate the presence of PfCAF1 at the telomeric repeat regions, 
central and subtelomeric var genes of multiple var gene family along with PfHP1. 
Further, we report the upregulation of PfCAF1 after treatment with genotoxic
agents like MMS and HU. Together, these findings establish role of PfCAF1 in
heterochromatin maintenance and as histone chaperone in nucleosome assembly and
DNA damage repair.
