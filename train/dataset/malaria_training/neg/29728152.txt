BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic individuals are one of the major challenges for malaria 
elimination programs in endemic areas. In the absence of clinical symptoms and
with a lower parasite density they constitute silent reservoirs considered
important for maintaining transmission of human malaria. Studies from Brazil have
shown that infected individuals may carry these parasites for long periods.
RESULTS: Patients were selected from three periurban endemic areas of the city of
Manaus, in the western Brazilian Amazon. Symptomatic and asymptomatic patients
with positive thick blood smear and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) positive
for Plasmodium vivax were invited to participate in the study. A standardised
pvs25 gene amplification by qPCR was used for P. vivax gametocytes detection.
Anopheles aquasalis were fed using membrane feeding assays (MFA) containing blood
from malaria patients. Parasitemia of 42 symptomatic and 25 asymptomatic
individuals was determined by microscopic examination of blood smears and qPCR.
Parasitemia density and gametocyte density were assessed as determinants of
infection rates and oocysts densities. A strong correlation between gametocyte
densities (microscopy and molecular techniques) and mosquito infectivity (P <
0.001) and oocysts median numbers (P < 0.05) was found in both groups. The
ability to infect mosquitoes was higher in the symptomatic group (41%), but
infectivity in the asymptomatic group was also seen (1.42%).
CONCLUSIONS: Although their infectivity to mosquitoes is relatively low, given
the high prevalence of P. vivax asymptomatic carriers they are likely to play and
important role in malaria transmission in the city of Manaus. The role of
asymptomatic infections therefore needs to be considered in future malaria
elimination programs in Brazil.
