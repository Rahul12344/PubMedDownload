Cell-cell communication is an important mechanism for information exchange
promoting cell survival for the control of features such as population density
and differentiation. We determined that Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood 
cells directly communicate between parasites within a population using
exosome-like vesicles that are capable of delivering genes. Importantly,
communication via exosome-like vesicles promotes differentiation to sexual forms 
at a rate that suggests that signaling is involved. Furthermore, we have
identified a P. falciparum protein, PfPTP2, that plays a key role in efficient
communication. This study reveals a previously unidentified pathway of P.
falciparum biology critical for survival in the host and transmission to
mosquitoes. This identifies a pathway for the development of agents to block
parasite transmission from the human host to the mosquito.
