BACKGROUND: Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is a cornerstone of malaria
chemoprophylaxis and is considered for programmes in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC). However, SP efficacy is threatened by drug resistance, that is
conferred by mutations in the dhfr and dhps genes. The World Health Organization 
has specified that intermittent preventive treatment for infants (IPTi) with SP
should be implemented only if the prevalence of the dhps K540E mutation is under 
50%. There are limited current data on the prevalence of resistance-conferring
mutations available from Eastern DRC. The current study aimed to address this
knowledge gap.
METHODS: Dried blood-spot samples were collected from clinically suspected
malaria patients [outpatient department (OPD)] and pregnant women attending
antenatal care (ANC) in four sites in North and South Kivu, DRC. Quantitative PCR
(qPCR) was performed on samples from individuals with positive and with negative 
rapid diagnostic test (RDT) results. Dhps K450E and A581G and dhfr I164L were
assessed by nested PCR followed by allele-specific primer extension and detection
by multiplex bead-based assays.
RESULTS: Across populations, Plasmodium falciparum parasite prevalence was 47.9% 
(1160/2421) by RDT and 71.7 (1763/2421) by qPCR. Median parasite density measured
by qPCR in RDT-negative qPCR-positive samples was very low with a median of 2.3
parasites/µL (IQR 0.5-25.2). Resistance genotyping was successfully performed in 
RDT-positive samples and RDT-negative/qPCR-positive samples with success rates of
86.2% (937/1086) and 55.5% (361/651), respectively. The presence of dhps K540E
was high across sites (50.3-87.9%), with strong evidence for differences between 
sites (p < 0.001). Dhps A581G mutants were less prevalent (12.7-47.2%). The dhfr 
I164L mutation was found in one sample.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of the SP resistance marker dhps K540E exceeds 50% in
all four study sites in North and South Kivu, DRC. K540E mutations regularly
co-occurred with mutations in dhps A581G but not with the dhfr I164L mutation.
The current results do not support implementation of IPTi with SP in the study
area.
