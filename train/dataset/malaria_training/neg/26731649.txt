Members of the Anopheles gambiae species complex are primary vectors of human
malaria in Africa. Population heterogeneities for ecological and behavioral
attributes expand and stabilize malaria transmission over space and time, and
populations may change in response to vector control, urbanization and other
factors. There is a need for approaches to comprehensively describe the structure
and characteristics of a sympatric local mosquito population, because incomplete 
knowledge of vector population composition may hinder control efforts. To this
end, we used a genome-wide custom SNP typing array to analyze a population
collection from a single geographic region in West Africa. The combination of
sample depth (n = 456) and marker density (n = 1536) unambiguously resolved
population subgroups, which were also compared for their relative susceptibility 
to natural genotypes of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The population subgroups
display fluctuating patterns of differentiation or sharing across the genome.
Analysis of linkage disequilibrium identified 19 new candidate genes for
association with underlying population divergence between sister taxa, A.
coluzzii (M-form) and A. gambiae (S-form).
