BACKGROUND: Mosquitoes belonging to Anopheles gambiae species complex are the
main malaria vector in Mauritania but data on their vector capacities, feeding
habits and insecticide susceptibility are still scanty. The objectives of this
study were to fill this gap.
METHODS: Adult Anopheles spp. mosquitoes were collected using pyrethrum spray
catch method from two ecological zones of Mauritania: Nouakchott (Saharan zone)
and Hodh Elgharbi region (Sahelian zone). Circumsporozoite proteins (CSP) for P. 
falciparum, P. vivax VK210 and P. vivax VK247 were detected by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from the female anopheline mosquitoes. To confirm
CSP-ELISA results, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was also performed. Blood meal
identification was performed in all engorged females by partial sequencing of the
mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Molecular assessments of pyrethroid knockdown
resistance (kdr) and insensitive acetylcholinesterase resistance (ace-1) were
conducted.
RESULTS: In Nouakchott, the only species of Anopheles identified during the
survey was Anopheles arabiensis (356 specimens). In Hodh Elgharbi, 1016 specimens
of Anopheles were collected, including 578 (56.9%) Anopheles rufipes, 410
(40.35%) An. arabiensis, 20 (1.96%) An. gambiae, 5 (0.5%) An. pharoensis and 3
(0.3 %) An. funestus. Three of 186 female An. arabiensis collected in Nouakchott 
and tested by ELISA were found positive for Plasmodium vivax VK210, corresponding
to a sporozoite rate of 1.6%; however PCR confirmed infection by P. vivax
sporozoite in only one of these. In Hodh Elgharbi, no mosquito was found positive
for Plasmodium spp. infection. There was a statistically significant difference
in the percentage of human blood-fed Anopheles spp. between Nouakchott (58.7%, 47
of 80 blood-engorged An. arabiensis females) and Hodh Elgharbi (11.1%, 2 of 18
blood-engorged mosquitoes). Analysis of the kdr polymorphisms showed 48.2%
(70/145) of East African kdr mutation (L1014S) in Nouakchott compared to 10%
(4/40) in Hodh Elgharbi region (P < 0.001). Nevertheless, West African kdr
mutation (L1014F) was found only in An. gambiae populations (4/40, 10%) from Hodh
Elgharbi region. No ace-1 mutation was found in mosquito specimens from the two
study zones.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study confirmed the autochthonous P. vivax malaria
transmission in Nouakchott, involving An. arabiensis as the main vector. It also 
described for the first time the absence of ace-1 mutation, the co-occurrence of 
both West and East African kdr mutation in An. gambiae in Mauritania, and
highlighted the regional variations in the prevalence and type of kdr mutations.
