Mosquito-borne diseases remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality across
the tropical regions. Despite much progress in the control of malaria,
malaria-associated morbidity remains high, whereas arboviruses-most notably
dengue-are responsible for a rising burden of disease, even in middle-income
countries that have almost completely eliminated malaria. Here I discuss how new 
interventions offer the promise of considerable future reductions in disease
burden. However, I emphasize that intervention programmes need to be underpinned 
by rigorous trials and quantitative epidemiological analyses. Such analyses
suggest that the long-term goal of elimination is more feasible for dengue than
for malaria, even if malaria elimination would offer greater overall health
benefit to the public.
