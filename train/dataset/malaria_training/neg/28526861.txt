The hepatic stage of the malaria parasite Plasmodium is accompanied by an
autophagy-mediated host response directly targeting the parasitophorous vacuolar 
membrane (PVM) harbouring the parasite. Removal of the PVM-associated autophagic 
proteins such as ubiquitin, p62, and LC3 correlates with parasite survival. Yet, 
it is unclear how Plasmodium avoids the deleterious effects of selective
autophagy. Here we show that parasites trap host autophagic factors in the
tubovesicular network (TVN), an expansion of the PVM into the host cytoplasm. In 
proliferating parasites, PVM-associated LC3 becomes immediately redirected into
the TVN, where it accumulates distally from the parasite's replicative centre.
Finally, the host factors are shed as vesicles into the host cytoplasm. This
strategy may enable the parasite to balance the benefits of the enhanced host
catabolic activity with the risk of being eliminated by the cell's cytosolic
immune defence.
