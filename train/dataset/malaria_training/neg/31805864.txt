BACKGROUND: Gut microbes can contribute to their hosts in food digestion,
nutrient absorption, and inhibiting the growth of pathogens. However, only
limited studies have focused on the gut microbiota of freshwater snails. Pomacea 
canaliculata is considered one of the worst invasive alien species in the world. 
Elucidating the diversity and composition of the microbiota in the gut of P.
canaliculata snails may be helpful for better understanding the widespread
invasion of this snail species. In this study, the buccal masses, stomachs, and
intestines were isolated from seven P. canaliculata snails. The diversity and
composition of the microbiota in the three gut sections were then investigated
based on high-throughput Illumina sequencing targeting the V3-V4 regions of the
16S rRNA gene.
RESULTS: The diversity of the microbiota was highest in the intestine but lowest 
in the buccal mass. A total of 29 phyla and 111 genera of bacteria were
identified in all of the samples. In general, Ochrobactrum, a genus of putative
cellulose-degrading bacteria, was the most abundant (overall relative abundance: 
13.6%), followed by Sediminibacterium (9.7%), Desulfovibrio (7.8%), an
unclassified genus in the family Aeromonadaceae (5.4%), and Cloacibacterium
(5.4%). The composition of the microbiota was diverse among the different gut
sections. Ochrobactrum (relative abundance: 23.15% ± 7.92%) and Sediminibacterium
(16.95 ± 5.70%) were most abundant in the stomach, an unclassified genus in the
family Porphyromonadaceae (14.28 ± 7.29%) and Leptotrichia (8.70 ± 4.46%) were
highest in the buccal mass, and two genera in the families Aeromonadaceae
(7.55 ± 4.53%) and Mollicutes (13.47 ± 13.03%) were highest in the intestine.
CONCLUSIONS: The diversity and composition of the microbiome vary among different
gut sections of P. canaliculata snails. Putative cellulose-degrading bacteria are
enriched in the gut of P. canaliculata.
