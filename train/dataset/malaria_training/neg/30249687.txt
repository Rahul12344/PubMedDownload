The in vivo antimalarial efficacies of two phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K)
inhibitors, a 3,5-diaryl-2-aminopyrazine sulfoxide and its corresponding sulfone 
metabolite, were evaluated in the NOD-scid IL2Rγnull (NSG) murine malaria disease
model of Plasmodium falciparum infection. We hypothesized that the sulfoxide
would serve as a more soluble prodrug for the sulfone, which would lead to
improved drug exposure with oral dosing. Both compounds had similar efficacy (90%
effective dose [ED90], 0.1 mg kg-1 of body weight) across a quadruple-dose
regimen. Pharmacokinetic profiling revealed rapid sulfoxide clearance via
conversion to sulfone, with sulfone identified as the major active metabolite.
When the sulfoxide was dosed, the exposure of the sulfone achieved was as much as
2.9-fold higher than when the sulfone was directly dosed, thereby demonstrating
that the sulfoxide served as an effective prodrug for the treatment of malaria.
