BACKGROUND: The bacterial community present in the abdomen in Anophelinae
mosquitoes can influence mosquito susceptibility to Plasmodium infection. Little 
is known about the bacteria associated with Nyssorhynchus darlingi, a primary
malaria vector in the Amazon basin. We investigated the abdominal bacterial
community compositions of naturally Plasmodium-infected (P-positive, n = 9) and
non-infected (P-negative, n = 7) Ny. darlingi from the Brazilian Amazon region
through massive parallel sequencing of the bacterial V4 variable region of the
16S rRNA gene.
RESULTS: Bacterial richness of Ny. darlingi encompassed 379 operational taxonomic
units (OTUs), the majority of them belonging to the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes
and Bacteroides phyla. Escherichia/Shigella and Pseudomonas were more abundant in
the P-positive and P-negative groups, respectively, than in the opposite groups. 
Enterobacter was found only in the P-negative group. The results of statistical
analyses conducted to compare bacterial abundance and diversity between
Plasmodium-infected and Plasmodium-non-infected mosquitoes were not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: This study increased knowledge about bacterial composition in Ny.
darlingi and revealed that Plasmodium-positive and Plasmodium-negative groups
share a common core of bacteria. The genera Prevotella 9, Sphingomonas,
Bacteroides, and Bacillus were reported for the first time in Ny. darlingi.
