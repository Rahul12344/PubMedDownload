Advances in infectious disease control strategies through genetic manipulation of
insect microbiomes have heightened interest in microbially produced small
molecules within mosquitoes. Herein, 33 mosquito-associated bacterial genomes
were mined and over 700 putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were
identified, 135 of which belong to known classes of BGCs. After an in-depth
analysis of the 135 BGCs, iron-binding siderophores were chosen for further
investigation due to their high abundance and well-characterized bioactivities.
Through various metabolomic strategies, eight siderophore scaffolds were
identified in six strains of mosquito-associated bacteria. Among these,
serratiochelin A and pyochelin were found to reduce female Anopheles gambiae
overall fecundity likely by lowering their blood-feeding rate. Serratiochelin A
and pyochelin were further found to inhibit the Plasmodium parasite asexual blood
and liver stages in vitro. Our work supplies a bioinformatic resource for future 
mosquito-microbiome studies and highlights an understudied source of bioactive
small molecules.
