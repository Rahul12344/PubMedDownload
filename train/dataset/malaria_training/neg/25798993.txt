Peptide-based drug discovery has experienced a significant upturn within the past
decade since the introduction of chemical modifications and unnatural amino acids
has allowed for overcoming some of the drawbacks associated with peptide
therapeutics. Strengthened by such features, modified peptides become capable of 
occupying a niche that emerges between the two major classes of today's
therapeutics-small molecules (<500 Da) and biologics (>5000 Da). Stabilized
α-helices have proven particularly successful at impairing disease-relevant PPIs 
previously considered "undruggable." Among those, hydrocarbon stapled α-helical
peptides have emerged as a novel class of potential peptide therapeutics. This
review provides a comprehensive overview of the development and applications of
hydrocarbon stapled peptides discussing the benefits and limitations of this
technique.
