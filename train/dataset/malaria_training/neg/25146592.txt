Because of the relative prevalence of hereditary sickle cell disease and the
auxiliary role of the sickle cell gene in reducing the mortality of malaria, it
is believed that P. falciparum has exerted selection pressure on human
populations to increase the prevalence of this otherwise detrimental gene. A
model incorporating three genotypes and two age cohorts is used to test the
hypothesis that higher death rates due to malaria can exert selective pressure to
increase the prevalence of the sickle cell gene. The model displays selection
pressure for the carrier gene in the presence of increasing malaria death rates
for either adults or children, showing both higher final frequencies of the gene 
as well as shortened time to reach these frequencies.
