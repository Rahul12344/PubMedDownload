Plasmodium malariae causes malaria in humans throughout the tropics and
subtropics. Plasmodium ovale curtisi and Plasmodium ovale wallikeri are sympatric
sibling species common in sub-Saharan Africa and also found in Oceania and Asia. 
Although rarely identified as the cause of malaria cases in endemic countries,
PCR detection has confirmed all three parasite species to be more prevalent, and 
persistent, than previously thought. Chronic, low-density, multispecies
asymptomatic infection is a successful biological adaptation by these Plasmodium 
spp., a pattern also observed among malaria parasites of wild primates. Current
whole-genome analyses are illuminating the species barrier separating the ovale
parasite species and reveal substantial expansion of subtelomeric gene families. 
The evidence for and against a quiescent pre-erythrocytic form of P. malariae is 
reviewed.
