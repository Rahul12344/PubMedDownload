BACKGROUND: Artesunate-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (ASSP) is the frontline
artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) in India. Random, irrational,
subtherapeutic artemisinin doses and self-medication with ACT along with
predominance of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance parasite invoked a strong
possibility of emerging artemisinin-resistant malaria parasites.
METHODS: This study involved 226 patients with uncomplicated Plasmodium
falciparum infection who had successfully completed the 42 days follow-up after
ASSP combination therapy from April 2014 to January 2016. We assessed the ASSP
treatment efficacy by evaluating parasite clearance half-life, pfkelch13, and
other (pfdhfr, pfdhps, pfmdr1, pfcrt) gene mutations and survival of parasites as
detected by an ex vivo ring-stage survival assay (RSA).
FINDINGS: Slow-clearing infections with longer parasite clearance half-lives (>5 
hours) were observed in 12% isolates. Cure rate after ASSP treatment was
declining to about 84.1%. ASSP failure was recorded in 15.9% (early treatment
failure, 7.9%; late treatment failure, 7.9%) of isolates. In sum, 24 patients
(10.6%) had parasite clearance half-lives greater than 5 hours with pfkelch13
polymorphism after 441 codon; in 15 of those patients (6.6%), parasites had not
cleared by 72 hours after initiation of therapy. Median ex vivo ring-stage
survival rate of these isolates was very high (12.2%; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 10.9-13.8) from that of cured patients (0.9%; 95% CI, 0.09-1.07). Of these 
15 patients, 13 patients had pfkelch13 G625R polymorphism, whereas 2 patients
contained R539T polymorphism. As per the World Health Organization guideline,
these 15 isolates were true artemisinin-resistant isolates.
INTERPRETATION: Identification of artemisinin-resistant isolates in India
together with new mutations and increasing combination therapy failures blow
alarms for urgent malaria control.
