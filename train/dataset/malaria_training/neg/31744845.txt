Pregnancy and pharmacogenetics variation alter drug disposition and treatment
outcome. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of pregnancy
and pharmacogenetics variation on day 7 lumefantrine (LF) plasma concentration
and therapeutic responses in malaria-infected women treated with
artemether-lumefantrine (ALu) in Tanzania. A total of 277 (205 pregnant and 72
nonpregnant) women with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were
enrolled. Patients were treated with ALu and followed up for 28 days. CYP3A4,
CYP3A5, and ABCB1 genotyping were done. Day 7 plasma LF concentration and the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) - corrected adequate clinical and parasitological
response (ACPR) at day 28 were determined. The mean day 7 plasma LF
concentrations were significantly lower in pregnant women than nonpregnant women 
[geometric mean ratio = 1.40; 95% confidence interval (CI) of geometric mean
ratio (1.119-1.1745), P < 0.003]. Pregnancy, low body weight, and CYP3A5*1/*1
genotype were significantly associated with low day 7 LF plasma concentration (P 
< 0.01). PCR-corrected ACPR was 93% (95% CI = 89.4-96.6) in pregnant women and
95.7% (95% CI = 90.7-100) in nonpregnant women. Patients with lower day 7 LF
concentration had a high risk of treatment failure (mean 652 vs. 232 ng/ml, P <
0.001). In conclusion, pregnancy, low body weight, and CYP3A5*1 allele are
significant predictors of low day 7 LF plasma exposure. In turn, lower day 7 LF
concentration is associated with a higher risk of recrudescence. SIGNIFICANCE
STATEMENT: This study reports a number of factors contributing to the lower day 7
lumefantrine (LF) concentration in women, which includes pregnancy, body weight, 
and CYP3A5*1/*1 genotype. It also shows that day 7 LF concentration is a main
predictor of malaria treatment. These findings highlight the need to look into
artemether-LF dosage adjustment in pregnant women so as to be able to maintain
adequate drug concentration, which is required to reduce treatment failure rates 
in pregnant women.
