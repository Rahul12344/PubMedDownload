A major obstacle in analyzing gene function in apicomplexan parasites is the
absence of a practical regulatable expression system. Here, we identified
functional transcriptional activation domains within Apicomplexan AP2 (ApiAP2)
family transcription factors. These ApiAP2 transactivation domains were validated
in blood-, liver-, and mosquito-stage parasites and used to create a robust
conditional expression system for stage-specific, tetracycline-dependent gene
regulation in Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium berghei, and Plasmodium falciparum.
To demonstrate the utility of this system, we created conditional knockdowns of
two essential P. berghei genes: profilin (PRF), a protein implicated in parasite 
invasion, and N-myristoyltransferase (NMT), which catalyzes protein acylation.
Tetracycline-induced repression of PRF and NMT expression resulted in a dramatic 
reduction in parasite viability. This efficient regulatable system will allow for
the functional characterization of essential proteins that are found in these
important parasites.
