Nitric oxide (NO) has dicotomic influence on modulating host-parasite interplay, 
synchronizing physiological orchestrations and diagnostic potential; instigated
us to investigate the plausible association and genetic regulation among NO
level, components of oxidative stress, iNOS polymorphisms and risk of malaria.
Here, we experimentally elucidate that iNOS promoter polymorphisms are associated
with risk of malaria; employing mutation specific genotyping, functional
interplay using western blot and RT-PCR, quantitative estimation of NO, total
antioxidant content (TAC) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Genotyping revealed 
significantly associated risk of P. vivax (adjusted OR = 1.92 and 1.72) and P.
falciparum (adjusted OR = 1.68 and 1.75) infection with SNP at iNOS-954G/C and
iNOS-1173C/T positions, respectively; though vivax showed higher risk of
infection. Intriguingly, mutation and infection specific differential
upregulation of iNOS expression/NO level was observed and found to be
significantly associated with mutant genotypes. Moreover, P. vivax showed
pronounced iNOS protein (2.4 fold) and mRNA (2.5 fold) expression relative to
healthy subjects. Furthermore, TAC and ROS were significantly decreased in
infection; and differentially decreased in mutant genotypes. Our findings endorse
polymorphic regulation of iNOS expression, altered oxidant-antioxidant components
and evidences of risk association as the hallmark of malaria pathogenesis.
iNOS/NO may serve as potential diagnostic marker in assessing clinical malaria.
