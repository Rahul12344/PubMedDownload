Plasmepsin IV from Plasmodium falciparum (PM IV) is a promising target for the
development of novel antimalarial drugs. Here, the crystal structure of the
truncated zymogen of PM IV (pPM IV), consisting of the mature enzyme plus a
prosegment of 47 residues, has been determined at 1.5 Å resolution. pPM IV
presents the fold previously described for studied proplasmepsins, displaying
closer similarities to proplasmepin IV from P. vivax (pPvPM) than to the other
two proplasmepsins from P. falciparum. The study and comparison of the pPM IV
structure with the proplasmepsin structures described previously provide
information about the similarities and differences in the inactivation-activation
mechanisms among the plasmepsin zymogens.
