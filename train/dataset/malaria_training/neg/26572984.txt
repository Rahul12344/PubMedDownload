BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax apical membrane antigen-1 (PvAMA-1) is a leading
candidate antigen for blood stage malaria vaccine. However, antigenic variation
is a major obstacle in the development of an effective vaccine based on this
antigen. In this study, the genetic structure and the effect of natural selection
of PvAMA-1 among Korean P. vivax isolates were analysed.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 66 Korean patients with vivax malaria.
The entire PvAMA-1 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned
into a TA cloning vector. The PvAMA-1 sequence of each isolate was sequenced and 
the polymorphic characteristics and effect of natural selection were analysed
using the DNASTAR, MEGA4, and DnaSP programs.
RESULTS: Thirty haplotypes of PvAMA-1, which were further classified into seven
different clusters, were identified in the 66 Korean P. vivax isolates. Domain II
was highly conserved among the sequences, but substantial nucleotide diversity
was observed in domains I and III. The difference between the rates of
non-synonymous and synonymous mutations suggested that the gene has evolved under
natural selection. No strong evidence indicating balancing or positive selection 
on PvAMA-1 was identified. Recombination may also play a role in the resulting
genetic diversity of PvAMA-1.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first comprehensive analysis of nucleotide
diversity across the entire PvAMA-1 gene using a single population sample from
Korea. Korean PvAMA-1 had limited genetic diversity compared to PvAMA-1 in global
isolates. The overall pattern of genetic polymorphism of Korean PvAMA-1 differed 
from other global isolates and novel amino acid changes were also identified in
Korean PvAMA-1. Evidences for natural selection and recombination event were
observed, which is likely to play an important role in generating genetic
diversity across the PvAMA-1. These results provide useful information for the
understanding the population structure of P. vivax circulating in Korea and have 
important implications for the design of a vaccine incorporating PvAMA-1.
