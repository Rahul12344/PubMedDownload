OBJECTIVE: To depict mitochondrial genetic variation for the first time among
Anopheles minimus (An.minimus) (Diptera: Culicidae) species from two malaria
endemic states of NE India.
METHODS: Phylogeographic analysis was carried at 9 out of 12 sites of An.minimus 
confirmed malaria endemic places.
RESULTS: All sequences were Adenine-Thymine rich regions. Transitions were
observed in 6 sequences where 5 mutations were synonymous substitutions and in 1 
case non synonymous mutation was observed. Three distinct clusters of haplotypes 
were generated. Haplotype diversity and low nucleotide diversity were studied.
Overall negative values obtained from Tajima's D test and Fu'sFS test indicate a 
recent genetic population expansion. Network analysis has explained sequence
diversity that was also shown by mutations in 6 sequences.
CONCLUSIONS: High genetic diversity observed within the populations of An.minimus
species has several possible implications for vector control in the region.
