The apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid of apicomplexan species, has an
extremely reduced but highly conserved genome. Here, the apicoplast genome of the
rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi (Pcc) isolate CB was
characterized. Although the set of genes in the genome is identical, the copy
number of some tRNA genes differs between Pcc and other Plasmodium species
because the Pcc DNA has only one rRNA/tRNA gene cluster, which is normally
duplicated in other species. The location of the duplicated trnR(ACG) and trnM
implies that one of the duplicated clusters in the ancestral molecule has been
lost due to an intramolecular recombination event. The Pcc DNA occurs in two
isoforms with an internal inversion between them. The presence of a unique
variant in the duplicated trnT gene suggests that the two isoforms are
interconvertible. This is the first report of the complete nucleotide sequence of
a Plasmodium apicoplast DNA.
