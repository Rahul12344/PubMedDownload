Host Transcriptional Responses to High- and Low-Virulent Avian Malaria Parasites.

The transcriptional response of hosts to genetically similar pathogens can vary
substantially, with important implications for disease severity and host fitness.
A low pathogen load can theoretically elicit both high and low host responses, as
the outcome depends on both the effectiveness of the host at suppressing the
pathogen and the ability of the pathogen to evade the immune system. Here, we
investigate the transcriptional response of Eurasian siskins (Spinus spinus) to
two closely related lineages of the malaria parasite Plasmodium relictum. Birds
were infected with either the high-virulent lineage P. relictum SGS1, the
low-virulent sister lineage P. relictum GRW4, or sham-injected (controls). Blood 
samples for RNA sequencing were collected at four time points during the course
of infection, totaling 76 transcriptomes from 19 birds. Hosts infected with SGS1 
experienced up to 87% parasitemia and major transcriptome shifts throughout the
infection, and multiple genes showed strong correlation with parasitemia. In
contrast, GRW4-infected hosts displayed low parasitemia (maximum 0.7%) with a
minor transcriptional response. We furthermore demonstrate that the baseline gene
expression levels of hosts prior to infection were irrelevant as immunocompetence
markers, as they could not predict future pathogen load. This study shows that
the magnitude of the host transcriptional response can differ markedly from
related parasites with different virulence, and it enables a better understanding
of the molecular interactions taking place between hosts and parasites.
