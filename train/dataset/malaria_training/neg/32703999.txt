The use of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) as a source for nucleic acids
that can be analyzed via nucleic acid amplification techniques has several
advantages, including minimal amounts of blood, sample collection, simplified
storage and shipping conditions at room temperature. We have systematically
developed and extensively evaluated a procedure to extract total nucleic acids
from used malaria RDTs. The co-extraction of DNA and RNA molecules from small
volumes of dried blood retained on the RDTs allows detection and quantification
of P. falciparum parasites from asymptomatic patients with parasite densities as 
low as 1 Pf/µL blood using reverse transcription quantitative PCR. Based on the
extraction protocol we have developed the ENAR (Extraction of Nucleic Acids from 
RDTs) approach; a complete workflow for large-scale molecular malaria
surveillance. Using RDTs collected during a malaria indicator survey we
demonstrated that ENAR provides a powerful tool to analyze nucleic acids from
thousands of RDTs in a standardized and high-throughput manner. We found several,
known and new, non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the propeller
region of the kelch 13 gene among isolates circulating on Bioko Island,
Equatorial Guinea.
