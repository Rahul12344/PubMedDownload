Tropical diseases caused by parasitic worms and protists are of major public
health concern affecting millions of people worldwide. New therapeutic and
diagnostic tools would be of great help in dealing with the public health and
economic impact of these diseases. RNA interference (RNAi) pathways utilize small
non-coding RNAs to regulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. In
recent years, a wealth of data about the mechanisms and biological functions of
RNAi pathways in distinct groups of eukaryotes has been described. Often, RNAi
pathways have unique features that are restricted to groups of eukaryotes. The
focus of this review will be on RNAi pathways in specific groups of parasitic
eukaryotes that include Trypanosoma cruzi, Plasmodium and Schistosoma mansoni.
These parasites are the causative agents of Chagas disease, Malaria, and
Schistosomiasis, respectively, all of which are tropical diseases that would
greatly benefit from the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic tools. In 
this context, we will describe specific features of RNAi pathways in each of
these parasitic eukaryotic groups and discuss how they could be exploited for the
treatment of tropical diseases.
