A vivax malaria case in Henan Province was diagnosed as an indigenous case
firstly in June 2013, and replased in April 2014. The clinical data of this case 
were collected and the epidemiological investigation was conducted. The blood
samples were examined by Giemsa-stained blood smear, rapid diagnostic test strip 
(RDT) and nested PCR. This patient stayed at Myanmar for about one week in May
2013, had the symptoms of chills, fever and sweating in June, and was diagnosed
as vivax malaria. After treated with artesunate, the symptoms disappeared. The
CSP sequence was amplified from the blood samples of the first and second attack,
and there was no difference in the central repeat domain of CSP gene. The
identity of our two CSP gene sequences to that of Myanmar isolates (GenBank
accessssion No. ABS95455, ABS95456) was 95.1% and 100%, while their nucleotide
sequence was with 88.8% and 67.1% identity with that of Henan isolates
(accessssion No. KP888996, KP889000), respectively. This patient is therefore
confirmed as an imported relapse case of Plasmodium vivax infection.
