The SIR2 family of NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylases, collectively called
sirtuins, has been of central interest due to their proposed roles in life-span
regulation and ageing. Sirtuins are one group of environment sensors of a cell
interpreting external information and orchestrating internal responses at the
sub-cellular level, through participation in gene regulation mechanisms.
Remarkably conserved across all kingdoms of life SIR2 proteins in several
protozoan parasites appear to have both conserved and intriguing unique
functions. This review summarises our current knowledge of the members of the
sirtuin families in Apicomplexa, including Plasmodium, and other protozoan
parasites such as Trypanosoma and Leishmania. The wide diversity of processes
regulated by SIR2 proteins makes them targets worthy of exploitation in
anti-parasitic therapies.
