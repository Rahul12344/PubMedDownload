Monitoring of antimalarial resistance is important to prevent its further spread,
but the available options for assessing resistance are less than ideal for field 
settings. Although molecular detection is perhaps the most efficient method, it
is also the most complex because it requires DNA extraction and PCR
instrumentation. To develop a more deployable approach, we designed new probes,
which, when used in combination with an inhibitor-tolerant Taq polymerase, enable
single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping directly from whole blood. The probes
feature two strategic design elements: locked nucleic acids to enhance
specificity and the reporter dyes Cy5 and TEX615, which have less optical overlap
with the blood absorbance spectra than other commonly used dyes. Probe
performance was validated on a traditional laboratory-based instrument and then
further tested on a field-deployable Adaptive PCR instrument to develop a
point-of-care platform appropriate for use in malaria settings. The probes
discriminated between wild-type Plasmodium falciparum and the
chloroquine-resistant CRT PF3D7_0709000:c.227A>C (p.Lys76Thr) mutant in the
presence of 2% blood. Additionally, in allelic discrimination plots with the new 
probes, samples clustered more closely to their respective axes compared with
samples using minor groove binder probes with 6-FAM and VIC reporter dyes. Our
strategy greatly simplifies single-nucleotide polymorphism detection and provides
a more accessible alternative for antimalarial resistance surveillance in the
field.
