BACKGROUND: Transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs), which target the sexual stages
of malaria parasites to interfere with and/or inhibit the parasite's development 
within mosquitoes, have been regarded as promising targets for disrupting the
malaria transmission cycle. In this study, genetic diversity of four TBV
candidate antigens, Pvs25, Pvs28, Pvs48/45, and PvWARP, among Plasmodium vivax
Korean isolates was analysed.
METHODS: A total of 86 P. vivax-infected blood samples collected from patients in
Korea were used for analyses. Each of the full-length genes encoding four TBV
candidate antigens, Pvs25, Pvs28, Pvs48/45, and PvWARP, were amplified by PCR,
cloned into T&A vector, and then sequenced. Polymorphic characteristics of the
genes were analysed using the DNASTAR, MEGA4, and DnaSP programs.
RESULTS: Polymorphism analyses of the 86 Korean P. vivax isolates revealed two
distinct haplotypes in Pvs25 and Pvs48/45, and three different haplotypes in
PvWARP. In contrast, Pvs28 showed only a single haplotype. Most of the nucleotide
substitutions and amino acid changes identified in all four TBV candidate
antigens were commonly found in P. vivax isolates from other geographic areas.
The overall nucleotide diversities of the TBV candidates were much lower than
those of blood stage antigens.
CONCLUSIONS: Limited sequence polymorphisms of TBV candidate antigens were
identified in the Korean P. vivax population. These results provide baseline
information for developing an effective TBV based on these antigens, and offer
great promise for applications of a TBV against P. vivax infection in regions
where the parasite is most prevalent.
