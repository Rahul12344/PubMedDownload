Plasmodium liver hypnozoites, which cause disease relapse, are widely considered 
to be the last barrier towards malaria eradication. The biology of this quiescent
form of the parasite is poorly understood which hinders drug discovery. We report
a comparative transcriptomic dataset of replicating liver schizonts and dormant
hypnozoites of the relapsing parasite Plasmodium cynomolgi. Hypnozoites express
only 34% of Plasmodium physiological pathways, while 91% are expressed in
replicating schizonts. Few known malaria drug targets are expressed in quiescent 
parasites, but pathways involved in microbial dormancy, maintenance of genome
integrity and ATP homeostasis were robustly expressed. Several transcripts
encoding heavy metal transporters were expressed in hypnozoites and the copper
chelator neocuproine was cidal to all liver stage parasites. This transcriptomic 
dataset is a valuable resource for the discovery of vaccines and effective
treatments to combat vivax malaria.
