A major obstacle in understanding the complex biology of the malaria parasite
remains to discover how gene transcription is controlled during its life cycle.
Accumulating evidence indicates that the parasite's epigenetic state plays a
fundamental role in gene expression and virulence. Using a comprehensive and
quantitative mass spectrometry approach, we determined the global and dynamic
abundance of histones and their covalent post-transcriptional modifications
throughout the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle of Plasmodium falciparum. We
detected a total of 232 distinct modifications, of which 160 had never been
detected in Plasmodium and 88 had never been identified in any other species. We 
further validated over 10% of the detected modifications and their expression
patterns by multiple reaction monitoring assays. In addition, we uncovered an
unusual chromatin organization with parasite-specific histone modifications and
combinatorial dynamics that may be directly related to transcriptional activity, 
DNA replication, and cell cycle progression. Overall, our data suggest that the
malaria parasite has a unique histone modification signature that correlates with
parasite virulence.
