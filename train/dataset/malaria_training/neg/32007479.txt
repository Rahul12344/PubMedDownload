Establishing an in vitro "red blood cell matrix" that would allow uninterrupted
access to a stable, homogeneous reticulocyte population would facilitate the
establishment of continuous, long-term in vitro Plasmodium vivax blood stage
cultures. In this study, we have explored the suitability of the erythroleukemia 
K562 cell line as a continuous source of such reticulocytes and have investigated
regulatory factors behind the terminal differentiation (and enucleation, in
particular) of this cell line that can be used to drive the reticulocyte
production process. The Duffy blood group antigen receptor (Fy), essential for P.
vivax invasion, was stably introduced into K562 cells by lentiviral gene
transfer. miRNA-26a-5p and miRNA-30a-5p were downregulated to promote erythroid
differentiation and enucleation, resulting in a tenfold increase in the
production of reticulocytes after stimulation with an induction cocktail compared
with controls. Our results suggest an interplay in the mechanisms of action of
miRNA-26a-5p and miRNA-30a-5p, which makes it necessary to downregulate both
miRNAs to achieve a stable enucleation rate and Fy receptor expression. In the
context of establishing P. vivax-permissive, stable, and reproducible
reticulocytes, a higher enucleation rate may be desirable, which may be achieved 
by the targeting of further regulatory mechanisms in Fy-K562 cells; promoting the
shift in hemoglobin production from fetal to adult may also be necessary. Despite
the fact that K562 erythroleukemia cell lines are of neoplastic origin, this cell
line offers a versatile model system to research the regulatory mechanisms
underlying erythropoiesis.
