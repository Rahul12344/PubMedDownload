Plasmodium gene functions in mosquito and liver stages remain poorly
characterized due to limitations in the throughput of phenotyping at these
stages. To fill this gap, we followed more than 1,300 barcoded P. berghei mutants
through the life cycle. We discover 461 genes required for efficient parasite
transmission to mosquitoes through the liver stage and back into the bloodstream 
of mice. We analyze the screen in the context of genomic, transcriptomic, and
metabolomic data by building a thermodynamic model of P. berghei liver-stage
metabolism, which shows a major reprogramming of parasite metabolism to achieve
rapid growth in the liver. We identify seven metabolic subsystems that become
essential at the liver stages compared with asexual blood stages: type II fatty
acid synthesis and elongation (FAE), tricarboxylic acid, amino sugar, heme,
lipoate, and shikimate metabolism. Selected predictions from the model are
individually validated in single mutants to provide future targets for drug
development.
