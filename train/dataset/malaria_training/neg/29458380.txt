BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy is the first-line anti-malarial
treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum infection in Angola. To date,
the prevalence of polymorphisms in the pfk13 gene, associated with artemisinin
resistance, and pfmdr1, associated with lumefantrine resistance, have not been
systematically studied in Angola.
METHODS: DNA was isolated from pretreatment and late treatment failure dried
blood spots collected during the 2015 round of therapeutic efficacy studies in
Benguela, Lunda Sul, and Zaire Provinces in Angola. The pfk13 propeller domain
and pfmdr1 gene were sequenced and analysed for polymorphisms. Pfmdr1 copy number
variation was assessed using a real-time PCR method. The association between
pfmdr1 and pfk13 mutations and treatment failure was investigated.
RESULTS: The majority of pretreatment (99%, 466/469) and all late treatment
failure (100%, 50/50) samples were wild type for pfk13. Three of the pretreatment
samples (1%) carried the A578S mutation commonly observed in Africa and not
associated with artemisinin resistance. All 543 pretreatment and day of late
treatment failure samples successfully analysed for pfmdr1 copy number variation 
carried one copy of pfmdr1. The NYD haplotype was the predominant pfmdr1
haplotype, present in 63% (308/491) of pretreatment samples, followed by NFD,
which was present in 32% (157/491) of pretreatment samples. The pfmdr1 N86 allele
was overrepresented in day of late treatment failure samples from participants
receiving artemether-lumefantrine (p value 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: The pretreatment parasites in patients participating in therapeutic 
efficacy studies in 2015 in Angola's three sentinel sites showed genetic evidence
of susceptibility to artemisinins, consistent with clinical outcome data showing 
greater than 99% day 3 clearance rates. The lack of increased pfmdr1 copy number 
is consistent with previous reports from sub-Saharan Africa. Although pfmdr1 NYD 
and NFD haplotypes were overrepresented in artemether-lumefantrine late treatment
failure samples, their role as markers of resistance was unclear given that these
haplotypes were also present in the majority of successfully treated patients in 
the artemether-lumefantrine treatment arms.
