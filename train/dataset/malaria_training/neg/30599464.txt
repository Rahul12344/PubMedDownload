BACKGROUND: During Plasmodium falciparum infection, microRNA expression alters in
brain tissue of mice with cerebral malaria compared to noninfected controls.
MicroRNA regulates gene expression post-transcriptionally to influence biological
processes. Cerebral malaria pathology caused mainly by the immunological
disorder. We hypothesize that single-nucleotide polymorphism in a microRNA
influences microRNA biogenesis or target gene recognition and altering
susceptibility to cerebral malaria.
METHODS: We performed a literature search based on immunological mechanism and
applied microRNA-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms database to examine
candidate microRNA SNPs possibly responsible for cerebral malaria. MicroRNA-27a
and microRNA-146a are supposed to involve in cerebral malaria pathology. To
assess the relationship of microRNA SNP to cerebral malaria outcome, we performed
TaqMan Genotyping Assays in 110 cerebral malaria and 207 uncomplicated malaria
cases for three candidate microRNA SNPs (rs895819 of microRNA-27a, rs57095329 and
rs2910164 of microRNA-146a).
RESULTS: Our study detected no significant difference in genotype and allele
frequency of individual microRNA SNPs as well as in haplotypes of microRNA-146a
between these two groups of malaria patients in Thailand. Hardy-Weinberg
disequilibrium of rs57095329 in the cerebral malaria group showed a heterozygous 
excess which might be due to natural selection.
CONCLUSION: Our data supported that the candidate microRNA SNPs have no major
role to develop cerebral malaria.
