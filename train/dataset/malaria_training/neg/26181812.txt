BACKGROUND: Other than Kaposi sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus and CD4 T-cell 
lymphopenia, the mechanisms responsible for KS in the context of HIV are poorly
understood. One recently explored pathway of HIV pathogenesis involves induction 
of the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO), which catabolizes tryptophan
into kynurenine and several other immunologically active metabolites that
suppress T-cell proliferation. We investigated the role of IDO in the development
of KS in HIV disease.
METHODS: In a case-control study among untreated HIV-infected Ugandans, cases
were adults with KS and controls were without KS. IDO activity was assessed by
the ratio of plasma kynurenine to tryptophan levels (KT ratio), measured by
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
RESULTS: We studied 631 HIV-infected subjects: 222 KS cases and 409 controls.
Non-KS controls had a higher median plasma KT ratio (130, interquartile range: 90
to 190 nM/μM) than KS cases (110, interquartile range: 90 to 150 nM/μM) (P =
0.004). After adjustment for age, sex, CD4 count, and plasma HIV RNA level,
subjects with the highest (fourth quartile) plasma KT ratios had a 59% reduction 
(95% confidence interval: 27% to 77%) in the odds of KS compared with those with 
the lowest (first quartile) levels. KS was also independently associated with
lower CD4 count, higher plasma HIV RNA, and men.
CONCLUSIONS: Among HIV-infected individuals, greater activity of the kynurenine
pathway of tryptophan catabolism, as evidenced by higher levels of plasma KT
ratio, was associated with lower occurrence of KS. Some consequences of immune
activation in HIV infection might actually suppress certain cancers.
