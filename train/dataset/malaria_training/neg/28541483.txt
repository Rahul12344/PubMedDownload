Background: Human malaria susceptibility is determined by multiple genetic
factors. It is unclear, however, which genetic variants remain important over
time.
Methods: Genetic associations of 175 high-quality polymorphisms within several
malaria candidate genes were examined in a sample of 8096 individuals from
northeast Tanzania using altitude, seroconversion rates, and parasite rates as
proxies of historical, recent, and current malaria transmission intensity. A
principal component analysis was used to derive 2 alternative measures of overall
malaria propensity of a location across different time scales.
Results: Common red blood cell polymorphisms (ie, hemoglobin S,
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and α-thalassemia) were the only ones to be
associated with all 3 measures of transmission intensity and the first principal 
component. Moderate associations were found between some immune response genes
(ie, IL3 and IL13) and parasite rates, but these could not be reproduced using
the alternative measures of malaria propensity.
Conclusions: We have demonstrated the potential of using altitude and
seroconversion rate as measures of malaria transmission capturing medium- to
long-term time scales to detect genetic associations that are likely to persist
over time. These measures also have the advantage of minimizing the deleterious
effects of random factors affecting parasite rates on the respective association 
signals.
