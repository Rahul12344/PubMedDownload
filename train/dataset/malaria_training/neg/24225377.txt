BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the distribution of a
series of independent doxycycline inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) values to
validate the trimodal distribution previously described and to validate the use
of the pftetQ and pfmdt genes as molecular markers of decreased in vitro
doxycycline susceptibility in Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
METHODS: Doxycycline IC50 values, from 484 isolates obtained at the French
National Reference Centre for Imported Malaria (Paris) between January 2006 and
December 2010, were analysed for the first time by a Bayesian mixture modelling
approach to distinguish the different in vitro phenotypic groups by their IC50
values. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate the
pftetQ and pfmdt copy numbers of 89 African P. falciparum isolates that were
randomly chosen from the phenotypic groups.
RESULTS: The existence of at least three doxycycline phenotypes was demonstrated.
The mean doxycycline IC50 was significantly higher in the group with a pftetQ
copy number >1 compared to the group with a pftetQ copy number = 1 (33.17 μM
versus 17.23 μM) and the group with a pfmdt copy number >1 (28.28 μM versus 16.11
μM). There was a significant difference between the combined low and medium
doxycycline IC50 group and the high IC50 group in terms of the per cent of
isolates with one or more copy numbers of the pftetQ gene (0% versus 20.69%) or
pfmdt gene (8.33% versus 37.93%). In the logistic regression model, the pfmdt and
pftetQ copy numbers >1 (odds ratio = 4.65 and 11.47) were independently
associated with the high IC50 group.
CONCLUSIONS: Copy numbers of pftetQ and pfmdt are potential predictive molecular 
markers of decreased susceptibility to doxycycline.
