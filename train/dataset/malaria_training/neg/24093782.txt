OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and patterns of pfcrt and pfmdr1
polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) isolates collected from
the malaria endemic area of Thailand along Thai-Myanmar border.
METHODS: Dried blood spot samples were collected from 172 falciparum malaria
patients prior received treatment. The samples were extracted using chelex to
obtain parasite DNA. PCR-RFLP was employed to detect pfcrt mutation at codons 76,
220, 271, 326, 356 and 371, and the pfmdr1 mutation at codon 86. Pfmdr1 gene copy
number was determined by SYBR Green I real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Mutant alleles of pfcrt and wild type allele of pfmdr1 were found in
almost all samples. Pfmdr1 gene copy number in isolates collected from all areas 
ranged from 1.0 to 5.0 copies and proportion of isolates carrying>1 gene copies
was 38.1%. The distribution and patterns of pfcrt and pfmdr1 mutations were
similar in P. falciparum isolates from all areas. However, significant
differences in both number of pfmdr1 copies and prevalence of isolates carrying>1
gene copies were observed among isolates collected from different areas. The
median pfmdr1 copy number in P. falciparum collected from Kanchanaburi and Mae
Hongson were 2.5 and 2.0, respectively and more than half of the isolates
carried>1 gene copies.
CONCLUSIONS: The observation of pfmdr1 wild type and increasing of gene copy
number may suggest declining of artesunate-mefloquine treatment efficacy in P.
falciparum isolates in this border area.
