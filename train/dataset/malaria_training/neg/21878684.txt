The DARC (Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines) gene, also called Duffy or FY,
encodes a membrane-bound chemokine receptor. Two malaria parasites, Plasmodium
vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi, use DARC to trigger internalization into red blood
cells. Although much has been reported on the evolution of DARC null alleles,
little is known about the evolution of the coding portion of this gene or the
role that protein sequence divergence in this receptor may play in disease
susceptibility or zoonosis. Here, we show that the Plasmodium interaction domain 
of DARC is nearly invariant in the human population, suggesting that coding
polymorphism there is unlikely to play a role in differential susceptibility to
infection. However, an analysis of DARC orthologs from 35 simian primate species 
reveals high levels of sequence divergence in the Plasmodium interaction domain. 
Signatures of positive selection in this domain indicate that species-specific
mutations in the protein sequence of DARC could serve as barriers to the
transmission of Plasmodium between primate species.
