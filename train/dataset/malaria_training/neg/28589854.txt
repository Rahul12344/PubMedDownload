BACKGROUND: Complex diseases involve many genes, and these genes are often
associated with several different illnesses. Disease similarity measurement can
be based on shared genotype or phenotype. Quantifying relationships between genes
can reveal previously unknown connections and form a reference base for therapy
development and drug repurposing.
METHODS: Here we introduce a method to measure disease similarity that
incorporates the uniqueness of shared genes. For each disease pair, we calculated
the uniqueness score and constructed disease similarity matrices using OMIM and
Disease Ontology annotation.
RESULTS: Using the Disease Ontology-based matrix, we identified several
interesting connections between cancer and other disease and conditions such as
malaria, along with studies to support our findings. We also found several high
scoring pairwise relationships for which there was little or no literature
support, highlighting potentially interesting connections warranting additional
study.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a co-occurrence matrix based on gene uniqueness to
examine the relationships between diseases from OMIM and DORIF data. Our
similarity matrix can be used to identify potential disease relationships and to 
motivate further studies investigating the causal mechanisms in diseases.
