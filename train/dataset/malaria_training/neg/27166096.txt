Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain containing adapter protein (TIRAP) plays a
crucial role in TLR2 and TLR4 signaling pathways. Glycosylphospatidylinositol
(GPI), considered a toxin molecule of Plasmodium falciparum, interacts with TLR2 
and 4 to induce an immune inflammatory response. A single nucleotide polymorphism
at coding region of TIRAP (S180L) has been reported to influence TLRs signaling. 
In the present study, we investigated the association of TIRAP (S180L)
polymorphism with susceptibility/resistance to severe P. falciparum malaria in a 
cohort of adult patients from India. TIRAP S180L polymorphism was typed in 347
cases of severe malaria (SM), 232 uncomplicated malaria and 150 healthy controls.
Plasma levels of TNF-α was quantified by ELISA. Heterozygous mutation (S/L)
conferred significant protection against MOD (multi organ dysfunction), NCSM
(non-cerebral severe malaria) as well as mortality. Interestingly, homozygous
mutants (L/L) had 16 fold higher susceptibility to death. TIRAP mutants (S/L and 
L/L) were associated with significantly higher plasma TNF-α levels compared to
wild type (S/S). The results of the present study demonstrate that TIRAP S180L
heterozygous mutation may protect patients against severe malaria and mortality.
