The remarkable ability of many parasites to evade host immunity is the key to
their success and pervasiveness. The immune evasion is directly linked to the
silencing of the members of extended families of genes that encode for major
parasite antigens. At any time only one of these genes is active. Infrequent
switches to other members of the gene family help the parasites elude the immune 
system and cause prolonged maladies. For most pathogens, the detailed mechanisms 
of gene silencing and switching are poorly understood. On the other hand, studies
in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have revealed similar mechanisms of
gene repression and switching and have provided significant insights into the
molecular basis of these phenomena. This information is becoming increasingly
relevant to the genetics of the parasites. Here we summarize recent advances in
parasite epigenetics and emphasize the similarities between S. cerevisiae and
pathogens such as Plasmodium, Trypanosoma, Candida, and Pneumocystis. We also
outline current challenges in the control and the treatment of the diseases
caused by these parasites and link them to epigenetics and the wealth of
knowledge acquired from budding yeast.
