BACKGROUND: Malaria cases persist in some remote areas in Sabah and Sarawak
despite the ongoing and largely successful malaria control programme conducted by
the Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, Ministry Of Health, Malaysia. Point
mutations in the genes that encode the two enzymes involved in the folate
biosynthesis pathway, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and dihydropteroate synthase
(DHPS) enzymes confer resistance to pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine respectively,
in both Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. The aim of the current study was to
determine the mutation on both pvdhfr at codon 13, 33, 57, 58, 61, 117, and 173
and pvdhps genes at codon 383 and 553, which are potentially associated with
resistance to pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine in P. vivax samples in Sabah.
METHODS: Every individual was screened for presence of malaria infection using a 
commercial rapid dipstick assay, ParaMax-3â„¢ (Zephyr Biomedical, India).
Individuals tested positive for P. vivax had blood collected and parasite DNA
extracted. The pvdhfr and pvdhps genes were amplified by nested-PCR. Restriction 
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was carried out for detection of specific
mutations in pvdhfr at codons 13Leu, 33Leu, 57Ile/Leu, 58Arg, 61Met, 117Asn/Thr, 
and 173Leu and pvdhps at codons 383Gly and 553Gly. The PCR-RFLP products were
analysed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technology, AS).
RESULTS: A total of 619 and 2119 individuals from Kalabakan and Kota Marudu,
respectively participated in the study. In Kalabakan and Kota Marudu, 9.37 and
2.45 % were tested positive for malaria and the positivity for P. vivax infection
was 4.2 and 0.52 %, respectively. No mutation was observed at codon 13, 33 and
173 on pvdhfr and at codon 553 on pvdhps gene on samples from Kalabakan and Kota 
Marudu. One-hundred per cent mutations on pvdhfr were at 57Leu and 117Thr.
Mutation at 58Arg and 61Met was observed to be higher in Kota Marudu 72.73 %.
Mutation at 383Gly on pvdhps was highest in Kalabakan with 80.77 %. There are
four distinct haplotypes of pvdhfr/pvdhps combination.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of triple and quintuple mutation combination suggest
that the P. vivax isolates exhibit a high degree of resistant to sulfadoxine,
pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine combination therapy.
