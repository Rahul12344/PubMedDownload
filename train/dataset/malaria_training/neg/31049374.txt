Antennae of female Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were dissected and lysed with
1% SDS. Proteins were extracted using ultra sonication and analyzed on high
resolution mass spectrometer. Proteomic data was analyzed using two search
algorithms SEQUEST and Mascot, resulting in the identification of 22,729 peptides
corresponding to 3262 proteins. These proteins were characterized using different
bioinformatics tools. VectorBase resource was used to assign Gene Ontology (GO)
terms. Using Biomart tool ortholog information was fetched from the VectorBase
database. Raw mass spectrometric data was deposited in ProteomeXchange Consortium
via PRIDE partner repository in the public dataset PXD001128. Proteins involved
in insecticide resistance and odorant binding were the most abundant in the
antennae. The proteins identified in this study could be targeted for developing 
novel vector control strategy.
