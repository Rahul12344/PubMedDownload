BACKGROUND: Genetic factors play a key role in determining
resistance/susceptibility to infectious disease. Susceptibility of the human host
to malaria infection has been reported to be influenced by genetic factors, which
could be confounders if not taken into account in the assessment of the efficacy 
of interventions against malaria. This study aimed to assess the relationship
between haemoglobin genotypes and malaria in children under five years in a site 
being characterized for future malaria vaccine trials.
METHODS: The study population consisted of 452 children living in four rural
villages. Hb genotype was determined at enrolment. Clinical malaria incidence was
evaluated over a one-year period using combined active and passive surveillance. 
Prevalence of infection was evaluated via bi-annual cross-sectional surveys. At
each follow-up visit, children received a brief clinical examination and thick
and thin blood films were prepared for malaria diagnosis. A clinical malaria was 
defined as Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia >2,500 parasites/μl and axillary
temperature ≥37.5°C or reported fever over the previous 24 hours.
RESULTS: Frequencies of Hb genotypes were 73.2% AA; 15.0% AC; 8.2% AS; 2.2% CC;
1.1% CS and 0.2% SS. Prevalence of infection at enrolment ranged from 61.9%-54.1%
among AA, AC and AS children. After one year follow-up, clinical malaria
incidence (95% CI) (episodes per person-year) was 1.9 (1.7-2.0) in AA, 1.6
(1.4-2.1) in AC, and 1.7 (1.4-2.0) in AS children. AC genotype was associated
with lower incidence of clinical malaria relative to AA genotype among children
aged 1-2 years [rate ratio (95% CI) 0.66 (0.42-1.05)] and 2-3 years [rate ratio
(95% CI) 0.37 (0.18-0.75)]; an association of opposite direction was however
apparent among children aged 3-4 years. AS genotype was associated with lower
incidence of clinical malaria relative to AA genotype among children aged 2-3
years [rate ratio (95% CI) 0.63 (0.40-1.01)].
CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of children, AC or AS genotype was associated with
lower risk of clinical malaria relative to AA genotype only among children aged
one to three years. It would be advisable for clinical studies of malaria in
endemic regions to consider haemoglobin gene differences as a potentially
important confounder, particularly among younger children.
