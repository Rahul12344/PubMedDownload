PURPOSE: Although the polymorphisms of erythrocyte complement receptor type 1
(CR1) in patients with malaria have been extensively studied, a question of
whether the polymorphisms of CR1 are associated with severe malaria remains
controversial. Furthermore, no study has examined the association of CR1
polymorphisms with malaria in Chinese population. Therefore, we investigated the 
relationship of CR1 gene polymorphism and malaria in Chinese population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed polymorphisms of CR1 gene rs2274567 G/A,
rs4844600 G/A, and rs2296160 C/T in 509 patients with malaria and 503 controls,
using the Taqman genotyping assay and PCR-direct sequencing.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the genotype, allele and
haplotype frequencies of CR1 gene rs2274567 G/A, rs4844600 G/A, and rs2296160 C/T
polymorphisms between patients with malaria and controls. Furthermore, there was 
no association of polymorphisms in the CR1 gene with the severity of malaria in
Chinese population.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that CR1 gene rs2274567 G/A, rs4844600 G/A,
and rs2296160 C/T polymorphisms may not be involved in susceptibility to malaria 
in Chinese population.
