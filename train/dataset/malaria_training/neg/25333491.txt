BACKGROUND: Establishing the extent, geographical distribution and mechanisms of 
insecticide resistance in malaria vectors is a prerequisite for resistance
management. Here, we report a widespread distribution of insecticide resistance
in the major malaria vector An. funestus across Uganda and western Kenya under
the control of metabolic resistance mechanisms.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Female An. funestus collected throughout Uganda
and western Kenya exhibited a Plasmodium infection rate between 4.2 to 10.4%.
Widespread resistance against both type I (permethrin) and II (deltamethrin)
pyrethroids and DDT was observed across Uganda and western Kenya. All populations
remain highly susceptible to carbamate, organophosphate and dieldrin
insecticides. Knockdown resistance plays no role in the pyrethroid and DDT
resistance as no kdr mutation associated with resistance was detected despite the
presence of a F1021C replacement. Additionally, no signature of selection was
observed on the sodium channel gene. Synergist assays and qRT-PCR indicated that 
metabolic resistance plays a major role notably through elevated expression of
cytochrome P450s. DDT resistance mechanisms differ from West Africa as the
L119F-GSTe2 mutation only explains a small proportion of the genetic variance to 
DDT resistance.
CONCLUSION: The extensive distribution of pyrethroid and DDT resistance in East
African An. funestus populations represents a challenge to the control of this
vector. However, the observed carbamate and organophosphate susceptibility offers
alternative solutions for resistance management.
