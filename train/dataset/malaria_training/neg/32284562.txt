The most severe form of human malaria is caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Its
virulence is closely linked to the increase in rigidity of infected erythrocytes 
and their adhesion to endothelial receptors, obstructing blood flow to vital
organs. Unlike other human-infecting Plasmodium species, P. falciparum exports a 
family of 18 FIKK serine/threonine kinases into the host cell, suggesting that
phosphorylation may modulate erythrocyte modifications. We reveal substantial
species-specific phosphorylation of erythrocyte proteins by P. falciparum but not
by Plasmodium knowlesi, which does not export FIKK kinases. By conditionally
deleting all FIKK kinases combined with large-scale quantitative
phosphoproteomics we identified unique phosphorylation fingerprints for each
kinase, including phosphosites on parasite virulence factors and host erythrocyte
proteins. Despite their non-overlapping target sites, a network analysis revealed
that some FIKKs may act in the same pathways. Only the deletion of the
non-exported kinase FIKK8 resulted in reduced parasite growth, suggesting the
exported FIKKs may instead support functions important for survival in the host. 
We show that one kinase, FIKK4.1, mediates both rigidification of the erythrocyte
cytoskeleton and trafficking of the adhesin and key virulence factor PfEMP1 to
the host cell surface. This establishes the FIKK family as important drivers of
parasite evolution and malaria pathology.
