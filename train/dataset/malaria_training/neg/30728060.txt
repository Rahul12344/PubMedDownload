BACKGROUND: Novel transgenic mosquito control methods require progressively more 
realistic evaluation. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of a
transgene that causes a male-bias sex ratio on Anopheles gambiae target
populations in large insectary cages.
METHODS: Life history characteristics of Anopheles gambiae wild type and Ag(PMB)1
(aka gfp124L-2) transgenic mosquitoes, whose progeny are 95% male, were measured 
in order to parameterize predictive population models. Ag(PMB)1 males were then
introduced at two ratios into large insectary cages containing target wild type
populations with stable age distributions and densities. The predicted proportion
of females and those observed in the large cages were compared. A related model
was then used to predict effects of male releases on wild mosquitoes in a west
African village.
RESULTS: The frequency of transgenic mosquitoes in target populations reached an 
average of 0.44 ± 0.02 and 0.56 ± 0.02 after 6 weeks in the 1:1 and in the 3:1
release ratio treatments (transgenic male:wild male) respectively. Transgenic
males caused sex-ratio distortion of 73% and 80% males in the 1:1 and 3:1
treatments, respectively. The number of eggs laid in the transgenic treatments
declined as the experiment progressed, with a steeper decline in the 3:1 than in 
the 1:1 releases. The results of the experiment are partially consistent with
predictions of the model; effect size and variability did not conform to the
model in two out of three trials, effect size was over-estimated by the model and
variability was greater than anticipated, possibly because of sampling effects in
restocking. The model estimating the effects of hypothetical releases on the
mosquito population of a West African village demonstrated that releases could
significantly reduce the number of females in the wild population. The interval
of releases is not expected to have a strong effect.
CONCLUSIONS: The biological data produced to parameterize the model, the model
itself, and the results of the experiments are components of a system to evaluate
and predict the performance of transgenic mosquitoes. Together these suggest that
the Ag(PMB)1 strain has the potential to be useful for reversible population
suppression while this novel field develops.
