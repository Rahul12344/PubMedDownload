Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is one of the most common
inherited enzymopathies in endemic areas of malaria including Southeast Asia. The
molecular features of G6PD deficiency are similar among Southeast Asian
population, with differences in the type of the prominent variants in each
region. This study determined the prevalence and molecular characteristics of
G6PD deficiency in northern Thailand. Quantitative assay of G6PD activity was
conducted in 566 neonatal cord blood samples and 6 common G6PD mutations were
determined by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method on G6PD
complete and intermediate deficiency samples. Ninety newborns had G6PD
deficiency, with prevalence in male newborns of 17% and that of female newborns
having an intermediate and complete deficiency of 13% and 2%, respectively. From 
95 G6PD alleles tested, G6PD Mahidol, G6PD Kaiping, G6PD Canton, G6PD Viangchan, 
G6PD Union, and G6PD Chinese-5 was detected in 19, 17, 15, 13, 7, and 2 alleles, 
respectively. Our study shows that the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in northern 
Thai population is high and combination of the common Chinese mutations is the
majority, a distribution different from central and southern Thailand where G6PD 
Viangchan is the prominent variant. These findings suggest a higher proportion of
assimilated Chinese ethnic group in the northern Thai population.
