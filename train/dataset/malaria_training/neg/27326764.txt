BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-induced dormancy provides a plausible explanation for
recrudescence following artemisinin monotherapy. This phenomenon shares
similarities with cell cycle arrest where cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and
cyclins play an important role.
METHODS: Transcription profiles of Plasmodium falciparum CDKs and cyclins before 
and after dihydroartemisinin (DHA) treatment in three parasite lines, and the
effect of CDK inhibitors on parasite recovery from DHA-induced dormancy were
investigated.
RESULTS: After DHA treatment, parasites enter a dormancy phase followed by a
recovery phase. During the dormancy phase parasites up-regulate pfcrk1, pfcrk4,
pfcyc2 and pfcyc4, and down-regulate pfmrk, pfpk5, pfpk6, pfcrk3, pfcyc1 and
pfcyc3. When entering the recovery phase parasites immediately up-regulate all
CDK and cyclin genes. Three CDK inhibitors, olomoucine, WR636638 and roscovitine,
produced distinct effects on different phases of DHA-induced dormancy, blocking
parasites recovery.
CONCLUSIONS: The up-regulation of PfCRK1 and PfCRK4, and down regulation of other
CDKs and cyclins correlate with parasite survival in the dormant state. Changes
in CDK expression are likely to negatively regulate parasite progression from G1 
to S phase. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of
artemisinin-induced dormancy and cell cycle regulation of P. falciparum, opening 
new opportunities for preventing recrudescence following artemisinin treatment.
