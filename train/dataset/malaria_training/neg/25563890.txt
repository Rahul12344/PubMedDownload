Recent studies have highlighted a key role in regulating gene transcription, in
both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, by enzymes that control the acetylation and
deacetylation of histones. In particular, inhibitors of histone deacetylases
(HDAC-Is) have been shown effective in controlling the development of many
parasites, such as the plasmodium of malaria. Here we report the results of a
study aimed at evaluating antiparasitic effect of two classes of HDAC-Is bearing 
different zinc binding group (hydroxamic acid vs thiol). The study showed that
only the hydroxamic acid based HDAC inhibitors were active, with Plasmodium
falciparum being the most sensitive parasite, having from low double-digit to
single-digit nanomolar range in vitro activities. Among three derivatives
evaluated also in vivo, ST8086AA1 (8) effectively inhibited 88% of the
development of Plasmodium falciparum.
