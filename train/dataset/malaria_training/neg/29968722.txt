The incidence of Plasmodium vivax infection has declined markedly in Malaysia
over the past decade despite evidence of high-grade chloroquine resistance. Here 
we investigate the genetic changes in a P. vivax population approaching
elimination in 51 isolates from Sabah, Malaysia and compare these with data from 
104 isolates from Thailand and 104 isolates from Indonesia. Sabah displays
extensive population structure, mirroring that previously seen with the emergence
of artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum founder populations in Cambodia.
Fifty-four percent of the Sabah isolates have identical genomes, consistent with 
a rapid clonal expansion. Across Sabah, there is a high prevalence of loci known 
to be associated with antimalarial drug resistance. Measures of differentiation
between the three countries reveal several gene regions under putative selection 
in Sabah. Our findings highlight important factors pertinent to parasite
resurgence and molecular cues that can be used to monitor low-endemic populations
at the end stages of P. vivax elimination.
