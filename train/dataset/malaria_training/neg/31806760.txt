Artemisinins are effective against a variety of parasites and provide the first
line of treatment for malaria. Laboratory studies have identified several
mechanisms for artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, including
mutations in Kelch13 that are associated with delayed clearance in some clinical 
isolates, although other mechanisms are likely involved. To explore other
potential mechanisms of resistance in parasites, we took advantage of the genetic
tractability of Toxoplasma gondii, a related parasite that shows moderate
sensitivity to artemisinin. Resistant populations of T. gondii were selected by
culture in increasing concentrations and whole-genome sequencing identified
several nonconservative point mutations that emerged in the population and were
fixed over time. Genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9 was used to introduce point
mutations conferring amino acid changes in a serine protease homologous to DegP
and a serine/threonine protein kinase of unknown function. Single and double
mutations conferred a competitive advantage over wild-type parasites in the
presence of drug, despite not changing EC50 values. Additionally, the evolved
resistant lines showed dramatic amplification of the mitochondria genome,
including genes encoding cytochrome b and cytochrome c oxidase I. Prior studies
in yeast and mammalian tumor cells implicate the mitochondrion as a target of
artemisinins, and treatment of wild-type parasites with high concentrations of
drug decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, a phenotype that was stably
altered in the resistant parasites. These findings extend the repertoire of
mutations associated with artemisinin resistance and suggest that the
mitochondrion may be an important target of inhibition of resistance in T.
gondii.
