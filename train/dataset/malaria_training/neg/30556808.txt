Erythrocyte Binding Antigen of 175 kDa (EBA-175) has a well-defined role in
binding to glycophorin A (GpA) during Plasmodium falciparum invasion of
erythrocytes. However, EBA-175 is shed post invasion and a role for this shed
protein has not been defined. We show that EBA-175 shed from parasites promotes
clustering of RBCs, and EBA-175-dependent clusters occur in parasite culture.
Region II of EBA-175 is sufficient for clustering RBCs in a GpA-dependent manner.
These clusters are capable of forming under physiological flow conditions and
across a range of concentrations. EBA-175-dependent RBC clustering provides
daughter merozoites ready access to uninfected RBCs enhancing parasite growth.
Clustering provides a general method to protect the invasion machinery from
immune recognition and disruption as exemplified by protection from neutralizing 
antibodies that target AMA-1 and RH5. These findings provide a mechanistic
framework for the role of shed proteins in RBC clustering, immune evasion, and
malaria.
