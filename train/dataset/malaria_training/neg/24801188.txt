The mechanisms underlying sexual stage switching in Plasmodium spp. have hitherto
remained a mystery. However, two recent studies have revealed that an
apicomplexan-specific DNA-binding protein is essential for the initiation of this
cell fate decision, ultimately providing the malaria community with a novel and
important tool in the battle to prevent malaria transmission.
