BACKGROUND: Two recent reports have identified the Endothelial Protein C Receptor
(EPCR) as a key molecule implicated in severe malaria pathology. First, it was
shown that EPCR in the human microvasculature mediates sequestration of
Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes. Second, microvascular thrombosis,
one of the major processes causing cerebral malaria, was linked to a reduction in
EPCR expression in cerebral endothelial layers. It was speculated that genetic
variation affecting EPCR functionality could influence susceptibility to severe
malaria phenotypes, rendering PROCR, the gene encoding EPCR, a promising
candidate for an association study.
METHODS: Here, we performed an association study including high-resolution
variant discovery of rare and frequent genetic variants in the PROCR gene. The
study group, which previously has proven to be a valuable tool for studying the
genetics of malaria, comprised 1,905 severe malaria cases aged 1-156 months and
1,866 apparently healthy children aged 2-161 months from the Ashanti Region in
Ghana, West Africa, where malaria is highly endemic. Association of genetic
variation with severe malaria phenotypes was examined on the basis of single
variants, reconstructed haplotypes, and rare variant analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 41 genetic variants were detected in regulatory and coding
regions of PROCR, 17 of which were previously unknown genetic variants. In
association tests, none of the single variants, haplotypes or rare variants
showed evidence for an association with severe malaria, cerebral malaria, or
severe malaria anemia.
CONCLUSION: Here we present the first analysis of genetic variation in the PROCR 
gene in the context of severe malaria in African subjects and show that genetic
variation in the PROCR gene in our study population does not influence
susceptibility to major severe malaria phenotypes.
