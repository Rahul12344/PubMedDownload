Cerebral malaria is associated with the circulating levels of tumour necrosis
factor alpha (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), but association
between these two cytokines and implications in splenocyte apoptosis remain
largely obscured. We have evaluated the outcome of TGF-β and TNF-α production in 
the context of splenocyte apoptosis during Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA)
infection. Blood-stage PbA infection confirmed blood-brain barrier disruption,
disarray of white pulp, increase in percentage of sub-G0/G1 and splenocyte
apoptosis. Flow cytometric analysis reveals up-regulation of Fas-L followed by
caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation and signifies possible involvement of
Fas-L-mediated splenocyte apoptosis. We have observed down-regulation of TGF-β
and up-regulation of TNF-α in tissue and serum level, respectively, during PbA
infection. Association between the production of TGF-β and the severity of
malaria infection in splenocytes was verified with TGF-β inhibitor that
exacerbated the apoptotic process. In contrary, TNF-α inhibitor causes
significant delay in apoptotic process, but could not alter the lethality of
parasite. Thus, results from this study suggest that the critical balance between
TGF-β and TNF-α might have a key role on Fas-L-mediated splenocyte apoptosis
during experimental cerebral malaria.
