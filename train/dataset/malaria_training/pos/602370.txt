Babesia bovis (argentina): observations of coagulation parameters, fibrinogen
catabolism and fibrinolysis in intact and splenectomized cattle.

Goodger BV, Wright IG.

The results of this paper indicate that cattle infected with B. bovis (argentina)
have a markedly altered and activated coagulation system. A degree of thrombin
activation occurs due partly to release of thromboplastin-like substances from
lysed erythrocytes but due primarily to activation of kallikrein by babesial
proteases. This produces a hyperfibrinogenaemia, particularly in intact cattle,
with soluble fibrin complexes constituting up to one-third of the total
fibrinogen concentration. High molecular weight non-coagulable fibrinogen-like
proteins are detected terminally but more so in splenectomized cattle.
Plasminogen concentration decreases in splenectomized but not intact cattle while
low molecular weight fibrinogen degradation products are not easily detected. It 
is suggested that a hypercoagulable intermediate state with little or no fibrin
deposition occurs rather than terminal disseminated intravascular coagulation.
