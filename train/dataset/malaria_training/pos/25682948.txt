Cerebral malaria, a severe complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection, can
be modeled in murine Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection. PbA-induced
experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) is CD8(+) T-cell mediated, and influenced by 
TH 1/TH 2 balance. Here, we show that IL-33 expression is increased in brain
undergoing ECM and we address the role of the IL-33/ST2 pathway in ECM
development. ST2-deficient mice were resistant to PbA-induced neuropathology.
They survived >20 days with no ECM neurological sign and a preserved cerebral
microcirculation, while WT mice succumbed within 10 days with ECM, brain vascular
leakage, distinct microvascular pathology obstruction, and hemorrhages.
Parasitemia and brain parasite load were similar in ST2-deficient and WT mice.
Protection was accompanied by reduced brain sequestration of activated CD4(+) T
cells and perforin(+) CD8(+) T cells. While IFN-γ and T-cell-attracting
chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 were not affected in the absence of functional ST2
pathway, the local expression of ICAM-1, CXCR3, and LT-α, crucial for ECM
development, was strongly reduced, and this may explain the diminished pathogenic
T-cell recruitment and resistance to ECM. Therefore, IL-33 is induced in PbA
sporozoite infection, and the pathogenic T-cell responses with local
microvascular pathology are dependent on IL-33/ST2 signaling, identifying IL-33
as a new actor in ECM development.
