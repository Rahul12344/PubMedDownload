Babesia divergens was cultivated in RPMI 1640 (25 mM HEPES) supplemented with 10%
human serum (RPMI-10% HS) with a high percentage of parasitized erythrocytes
(PPE) (> or = 40%). Standardization of in vitro tests, purification of
exoantigens, biochemical studies and the safety of the culture handler motivated 
the development of a serum-free defined medium. Removal of serum greatly reduced 
the PPE but, after a period of adaptation, the culture was continuous and the
parasite was able to develop a 3% routine PPE. Addition of vitamins or reduced
glutathione in basal medium (RPMI) did not improve the PPE. The supplementation
of basal medium with lipidic carrier (Albumax I or bovine serum albumin-Cohn's
fraction V) promoted the growth of B. divergens with high PPE (> 30%) close to
those obtained in RPMI-10% HS. Neither protein nor lipid fractions alone were
able to restore the growth of B. divergens. Nevertheless, the whole lipid
fraction from serum or Albumax I added to delipidated albumin partially restored 
the growth (7% PPE), indicating that the presentation of specific lipids by a
carrier is crucial for the parasite. All the data indicate that Albumax I can
replace human serum offering the advantages of safety, standardization for
chemosensitivity tests, and exoantigen purification.
