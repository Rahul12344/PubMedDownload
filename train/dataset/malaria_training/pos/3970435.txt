Experimental babesiosis in coyotes and coydogs.

Roher DP, Anderson JF, Nielsen SW.

One splenectomized and 6 intact coyotes (Canis latrans), and 2 coydogs were
experimentally inoculated with a recent isolate of Babesia gibsoni. The disease
was mild in intact animals, was fatal in the splenectomized coyote, and was
characterized by a regenerative hemolytic anemia with the PCV decreasing to 16%
in intact animals and to 6% in the splenectomized coyote. Peak parasitemia ranged
from 3% to 21% of erythrocytes infected and was inversely correlated to PCV.
Serum lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, and globulin concentrations were
increased in all infected animals. Three weeks after inoculation, specific
antibody titers increased to 1:65,536 and remained elevated in the chronically
infected animals. The splenectomized coyote had progressive weakness until death,
24 days after inoculation. Intact animals had splenomegaly and anorexia at the
height of infection. The splenectomized coyote had generalized edema, omental
petechiae, renal and hepatic degeneration, membrano-proliferative
glomerulonephritis and congestion, extramedullary hematopoiesis, lymphoid
hyperplasia, and severe hemosiderosis in an accessory spleen. The only consistent
change in the intact animals was splenomegaly.
