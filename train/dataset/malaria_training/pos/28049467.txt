BACKGROUND: Placental Plasmodium falciparum malaria can trigger intervillositis, 
a local inflammatory response more strongly associated with low birthweight than 
placental malaria infection alone. Fetal growth (and therefore birthweight) is
dependent on placental amino acid transport, which is impaired in placental
malaria-associated intervillositis. Here, we tested the hypothesis that
mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, a pathway known to regulate
amino acid transport, is inhibited in placental malaria-associated
intervillositis, contributing to lower birthweight.
METHODS: We determined the link between intervillositis, mTOR signaling activity,
and amino acid uptake in tissue biopsies from both uninfected placentas and
malaria-infected placentas with and without intervillositis, and in an in vitro
model using primary human trophoblast (PHT) cells.
RESULTS: We demonstrated that (1) placental mTOR activity is lower in cases of
placental malaria with intervillositis, (2) placental mTOR activity is negatively
correlated with the degree of inflammation, and (3) inhibition of placental mTOR 
activity is associated with reduced placental amino acid uptake and lower
birthweight. In PHT cells, we showed that (1) inhibition of mTOR signaling is a
mechanistic link between placental malaria-associated intervillositis and
decreased amino acid uptake and (2) constitutive mTOR activation partially
restores amino acid uptake.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the concept that inhibition of placental mTOR
signaling constitutes a mechanistic link between placental malaria-associated
intervillositis and decreased amino acid uptake, which may contribute to lower
birthweight. Restoring placental mTOR signaling in placental malaria may increase
birthweight and improve neonatal survival, representing a new potential
therapeutic approach.
