Cerebral malaria (CM) causes substantial mortality and neurological sequelae in
survivors, and no neuroprotective regimens are currently available for this
condition. Erythropoietin (EPO) reduces neuropathology and improves survival in
murine CM. Using the Plasmodium berghei model of CM, we investigated if EPO's
neuroprotective effects include activation of endogenous neural stem cells (NSC).
By using immunohistochemical markers of different NSC maturation stages, we show 
that EPO increased the number of nestin(+) cells in the dentate gyrus and in the 
sub-ventricular zone of the lateral ventricles, relative to control-treatment.
75% of the EPO-treated CM mice displayed migration as nestin(+) NSC. The NSC
showed differentiation towards a neural cell lineage as shown by PSA-NCAM binding
and NSC maturation and lineage commitment was significantly affected by exogenous
EPO and by CM in the sub ventricular zone. These results indicate a rapid,
EPO-dependent activation of NSC during CM pathology.
