The acquisition of regulatory proteins is a means of blood-borne pathogens to
avoid destruction by the human complement. We recently showed that the gametes of
the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum bind factor H (FH) from the
blood meal of the mosquito vector to assure successful sexual reproduction, which
takes places in the mosquito midgut. While these findings provided a first
glimpse of a complex mechanism used by Plasmodium to control the host immune
attack, it is hitherto not known, how the pathogenic blood stages of the malaria 
parasite evade destruction by the human complement. We now show that the human
complement system represents a severe threat for the replicating blood stages,
particularly for the reinvading merozoites, with complement factor C3b
accumulating on the surfaces of the intraerythrocytic schizonts as well as of
free merozoites. C3b accumulation initiates terminal complement complex
formation, in consequence resulting in blood stage lysis. To inactivate C3b, the 
parasites bind FH as well as related proteins FHL-1 and CFHR-1 to their surface, 
and FH binding is trypsin-resistant. Schizonts acquire FH via two contact sites, 
which involve CCP modules 5 and 20. Blockage of FH-mediated protection via
anti-FH antibodies results in significantly impaired blood stage replication,
pointing to the plasmodial complement evasion machinery as a promising malaria
vaccine target.
