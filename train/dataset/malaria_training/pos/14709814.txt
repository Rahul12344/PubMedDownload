Erythrocyte 5'-nucleotidase is thought to be involved in the maturation of
erythrocytes. In the present study, in vitro incubation of canine erythrocytes
demonstrated that significant inhibition of 5'-nucleotidase activity occurred in 
the presence of serum from dogs infected with Babesia gibsoni, when the enzyme
was assayed with cytidine 5'-monophosphate (5'-CMP) and inosine 5'-monophosphate 
(5'-IMP) as substrates. The multiplication of B. gibsoni in in vitro culture also
resulted in a significant decrease in the enzyme activity of erythrocytes in the 
culture. Furthermore, the infected serum and 5'-CMP retarded the maturation of
canine reticulocytes in vitro. These results suggested that nucleotides such as
5'-CMP and 5'-IMP might accumulate in young erythrocytes and/or serum in dogs
infected with B. gibsoni as a result of decreased activity of erythrocyte
5'-nucleotidase, resulting in the delayed maturation of reticulocytes.
