BACKGROUND: We aimed to reveal the role of CD11b and hypoxia-inducible
factors-1alpha (HIF-1α) expressions on monocytes and alveolar macrophages of lung
tissue, and the levels of serum surfactant protein-D (SP-D) in severe
malaria-associated acute lung injury (ALI).
METHODS: The C57BL/6 mice were divided into control group, renal malaria group
(inoculated with 106Plasmodium berghei ANKA), and cerebral malaria group
(inoculated with 107P. berghei ANKA). The expressions of CD11b and HIF-1α in lung
tissue were observed by immunohistochemistry, and serum SP-D levels were measured
by ELISA. This study was conducted from June 2014 to February 2015 in the
Laboratory of Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Brawijaya, Malang.
RESULTS: The CD11b expression on pulmonary tissue of renal and cerebral malaria
mice were significantly higher than control mice (P=0.002; P=0.002), as well as
the HIF-1α expression on pulmonary tissue (P=0.002; P=0.002). The level of serum 
SP-D in renal malaria and cerebral malaria mice were significantly higher than
control mice (P=0.002; P=0.002). We found a strong correlation between the
expression of CD11b and HIF-1α in lung tissue (r=0.937, P=0.000), as well as
between CD11b expression and serum SP-D levels (r=0.907, P=0.000) and between
HIF-1α expression and serum SP-D levels (r=0.913, P=0.000).
CONCLUSION: Severe malaria-associated ALI increased the expression of CD11b and
HIF-1α in the lung tissue and increased serum SP-D levels of C57BL/6 mice
significantly.
