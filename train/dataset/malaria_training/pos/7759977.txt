Transcobalamin II (TCII) levels have been reported to be elevated in patients
with many clinical conditions including proliferative reticuloendothelial system.
As reactive macrophage hyperplasia frequently occurs in patients with malaria,
the objective of the present study was to determine TCII in patients with
Plasmodium falciparum with cerebral symptoms. The studies were performed on 14
cerebral malaria patients as well as 60 normal subjects. The mean values of serum
vitamin B12 and TCII levels were significantly higher in the patient group and 6 
and 7 patients had serum vitamin B12 and TCII levels higher than the normal
values. There was direct relationship between serum TCII levels and BUN or
creatinine levels. These findings indicated that raised serum TCII level occurred
only in patients with renal insufficiency. A decreased glomerular fiLtration rate
reduced the amount of vitamin B12 and TCII-B12 that filtered through the
glomeruli resulting in the reduced proximal tubular cells uptake and its
degradation of TCII. This reduced lysosomal enzyme activity, therefore, prolongs 
the intravascular TCII survival and increased secretion of TCII into the
circulation. Therefore, serum TCII levels were elevated in these cerebral malaria
patients.
