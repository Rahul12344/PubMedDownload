BACKGROUND: Plasmodium knowlesi was identified as the fifth major malaria
parasite in humans. It presents severe clinical symptoms and leads to mortality
as a result of hyperparasitemia in a short period of time. This study aimed to
improve the current understanding of P. knowlesi and identify potential
biomarkers for knowlesi malaria.
METHODS: In the present study, we have employed two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis-coupled immunoblotting techniques and mass spectrometry to
identify novel circulating markers in sera from P. knowlesi-infected patients.
Specifically, we have compared serum protein profiles from P. knowlesi-infected
patients against those of healthy or P. vivax-infected individuals.
RESULTS: We identified several immunoreactive proteins in malarial-infected
subjects, including alpha-2-HS glycoprotein (AHSG), serotransferrin (TF),
complement C3c (C3), hemopexin (HPX), zinc-2-alpha glycoprotein (ZAG1),
apolipoprotein A1 (Apo-A1), haptoglobin (HAP), and alpha-1-B-glycoprotein (A1BG).
However, only TF and HPX displayed enhanced antigenicity and specificity,
suggesting that they might represent valid markers for detecting P. knowlesi
infection. Additionally, six P. knowlesi-specific antigens were identified (K15, 
K16, K28, K29, K30, and K38). Moreover, although HAP antigenicity was observed
during P. vivax infection, it was undetectable in P. knowlesi-infected subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated the application of immunoproteomics approach to
identify potential candidate biomarkers for knowlesi malaria infection.
