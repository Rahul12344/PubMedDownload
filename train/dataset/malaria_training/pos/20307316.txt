BACKGROUND: The mechanisms by which malaria up and down-regulates CYP activities 
are not understood yet. It is also unclear whether CYP activities are modulated
during non-lethal malaria infections. This study was undertaken to evaluate the
time course of CYP alterations in lethal (Plasmodium berghei ANKA) and non-lethal
(Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi) murine malaria. Additionally, hypotheses on the
association of CYP depression with enhanced nitric oxide (NO) production, and of 
CYP2a5 induction with endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction, enhanced haem metabolism
and oxidative stress were examined as well.
METHODS: Female DBA-2 and C57BL/6 mice were infected with P.berghei ANKA or P.
chabaudi and killed at different post-infection days. Infection was monitored by 
parasitaemia rates and clinical signs. NO levels were measured in the serum.
Activities of CYP1a (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase), 2b
(benzyloxyresorufin-O-debenzylase), 2a5 (coumarin-7-hydroxylase) and
uridine-diphosphoglucuronyl-transferase (UGT) were determined in liver
microsomes. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity and concentrations of
gluthatione (GSH) and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) were
determined in the liver. Levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) were
evaluated by immunoblotting, while mRNAs of haemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) and inducible 
nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were determined by quantitative RT-PCR.
RESULTS: Plasmodium berghei depressed CYP1a and 2b and induced 2a5 in DBA-2 mice.
In P.berghei-infected C57BL/6 mice CYP activities remained unaltered. In both
strains, GST and UGT were not affected by P.berghei. Plasmodium c. chabaudi
depressed CYP1a and 2b and induced 2a5 activities on the day of peak parasitaemia
or near this day. CYP2a5 induction was associated with over-expression of HO-1
and enhanced oxidative stress, but it was not associated with GRP78 induction, a 
marker of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Plasmodium chabaudi increased serum NO on
days near the parasitaemia peak in both strains. Although not elevating serum NO,
P.berghei enhanced iNOS mRNA expression in the liver.
CONCLUSION: Down-regulation of CYP1a and 2b and induction of 2a5 occurred in
lethal and non-lethal infections when parasitaemia rates were high. A
contribution of NO for depression of CYP2b cannot be ruled out. Results were
consistent with the view that CYP2a5 and HO-1 are concurrently up-regulated and
suggested that CYP2a5 induction may occur in the absence of enhanced endoplasmic 
reticulum stress.
