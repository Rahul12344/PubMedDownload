Elevated levels of phospholipase B in mice infected and challenged with
Plasmodium yoelii.

Ngwenya BZ, Capaci BL.

Marked increases in phospholipase B activity were measured in spleen homogenates 
and sera of CD-1 mice given a primary infection of Plasmodium yoelii. The rise in
enzyme activity paralleled parasitemia and splenomegaly, all reaching maximum
values 14 days after infection. Maximum enzyme activity and splenomegaly were
noted 5 days after challenge in mice given a secondary infection indicating an
anamnesticlike response following a subsequent contact with the infecting
parasite. These observations represent a new finding of this enzyme activity in a
protozoan infection.
