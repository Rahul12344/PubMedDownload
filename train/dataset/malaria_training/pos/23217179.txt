BACKGROUND: Malaria is among the most prevalent parasitic diseases worldwide. In 
Brazil, malaria is concentrated in the northern region, where Plasmodium vivax
accounts for 85% disease incidence. The role of genetic factors in host immune
system conferring resistance/susceptibility against P. vivax infections is still 
poorly understood.
METHODS: The present study investigates the influence of polymorphisms in 18
genes related to the immune system in patients with malaria caused by P. vivax. A
total of 263 healthy individuals (control group) and 216 individuals infected by 
P. vivax (malaria group) were genotyped for 33 single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in IL1B, IL2, IL4, IL4R, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL12A, IL12B, IL12RB1, SP110,
TNF, TNFRSF1A, IFNG, IFNGR1, VDR, PTPN22 and P2X7 genes. All subjects were
genotyped with 48 ancestry informative insertion-deletion polymorphisms to
determine the proportion of African, European and Amerindian ancestry. Only 13
SNPs in 10 genes with differences lower than 20% between cases and controls in a 
Poisson Regression model with age as covariate were further investigated with a
structured population association test.
RESULTS: The IL1B gene -5839C > T and IL4R 1902A > G polymorphisms and IL12RB1
-1094A/-641C and TNF -1031 T/-863A/-857 T/-308 G/-238 G haplotypes were
associated with malaria susceptibility after population structure correction
(p = 0.04, p = 0.02, p = 0.01 and p = 0.01, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Plasmodium vivax malaria pathophysiology is still poorly understood. 
The present findings reinforce and increase our understanding about the role of
the immune system in malaria susceptibility.
