Although Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) has been implicated in cytokine and type I
interferon (IFN) production during malaria in humans and mice, the high AT
content of the Plasmodium falciparum genome prompted us to examine the
possibility that malarial DNA triggered TLR9-independent pathways. Over 6000
ATTTTTAC ("AT-rich") motifs are present in the genome of P. falciparum, which we 
show here potently induce type I IFNs. Parasite DNA, parasitized erythrocytes and
oligonucleotides containing the AT-rich motif induce type I IFNs via a pathway
that did not involve the previously described sensors TLR9, DAI, RNA
polymerase-III or IFI16/p204. Rather, AT-rich DNA sensing involved an unknown
receptor that coupled to the STING, TBK1 and IRF3-IRF7 signaling pathway. Mice
lacking IRF3, IRF7, the kinase TBK1 or the type I IFN receptor were resistant to 
otherwise lethal cerebral malaria. Collectively, these observations implicate
AT-rich DNA sensing via STING, TBK1 and IRF3-IRF7 in P. falciparum malaria.
