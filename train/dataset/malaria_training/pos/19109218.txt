BACKGROUND: The contribution of pro-inflammatory cytokines to the pathogenesis of
malarial anemia has been studied extensively but the roles of Th2 cytokines
remain unknown. Here, we investigated the role of signal transducer and activator
of transcription (STAT)6-mediated responses in erythropoietic suppression during 
acute malaria infection in mice.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Na√Øve and/or erythropoietin-treated wild-type and STAT6(-/-) 
mice were infected with Plasmodium chabaudi AS (P. chabaudi), and the effects
parasitemia, hematologic parameters, erythropoietin receptor, TER119, and CD71
expression, in vitro erythropoietin-stimulated proliferation of splenic erythroid
precursors, and serum cytokine levels were analyzed. To explore the role of
interleukin-4 in STAT6-dependent erythropoietic suppression, mice were treated in
vivo with a monoclonal antibody to interleukin-4 and the effects on parasitemia, 
hematologic parameters, and cytokine levels were analyzed.
RESULTS: Infected STAT6(-/-) mice developed enhanced reticulocytosis compared to 
wild-type mice despite higher parasitemia and a similar course of anemia.
Enhanced reticulocytosis in infected STAT6(-/-) mice was associated with an
increased frequency of late-stage erythroblasts, fewer leukocytes expressing
CD71, and increased erythropoietin-stimulated proliferation of splenocytes
compared to infected wild-type mice. Interleukin-4-depleted wild-type mice had
increased levels of parasitemia and a course of reticulocytosis similar to
responses observed in infected STAT6(-/-) mice. Determination of serum cytokine
levels in STAT6(-/-) and wild-type mice depleted of interleukin-4 by treatment
with mAb revealed significantly lower levels of interferon-gamma compared to
control wild-type mice during infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings provide evidence for a STAT6-dependent
mechanism in mediating erythropoietic suppression during acute blood-stage
malaria and indicate a role for interleukin-4 and possibly interferon-gammain
STAT6-induced erythropoietic suppression.
