Although the relationship between hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor
populations has been investigated extensively under steady-state conditions, the 
dynamic response of the hematopoietic compartment during acute infection is
largely unknown. Here we show that after infection of mice with Plasmodium
chabaudi, a c-Kit(hi) progenitor subset positive for interleukin 7 receptor-alpha
(IL-7Ralpha) emerged that had both lymphoid and myeloid potential in vitro. After
being transferred into uninfected alymphoid or malaria-infected hosts,
IL-7Ralpha(+)c-Kit(hi) progenitors generated mainly myeloid cells that
contributed to the clearance of infected erythrocytes in infected hosts. The
generation of these infection-induced progenitors was critically dependent on
interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) signaling in hematopoietic progenitors. Thus,
IFN-gamma is a key modulator of hematopoiesis and innate and adaptive immunity
during acute malaria infection.
