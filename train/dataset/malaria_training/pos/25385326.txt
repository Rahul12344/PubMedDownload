Studies have demonstrated that the membrane attack complex (MAC) of complement
can evoke seizures when injected directly into rodent brain. In the course of
studies that examine the role of complement in the development of experimental
cerebral malaria (ECM), we observed fewer seizures in mice deficient in C5, a
component required for MAC formation. To determine if the MAC contributed to the 
tonic-clonic seizures characteristic of ECM, we performed long-term
video-electroencephalography (EEG) on C5(-/-) mice with Plasmodium berghei
ANKA-induced cerebral malaria and observed significantly reduced spike and
seizure frequency compared to wild-type mice. Our data suggest a role for the MAC
in malaria-induced seizures and that inhibition of the terminal complement
pathway may reduce seizures and seizure-related neurocognitive deficits.
