The intracellular parasite Theileria induces uncontrolled proliferation and host 
cell transformation. Parasite-induced transformation is accompanied by
constitutive activation of IkappaB kinase (IKK), resulting in permanently high
levels of activated nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. IKK activation pathways normally 
require heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a chaperone that regulates the stability
and activity of signalling molecules and can be blocked by the benzoquinone
ansamycin compound geldanamycin (GA). In Theileria-transformed cells,
IkappaBalpha and p65 phosphorylation, NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and DNA
binding activity are largely resistant to GA and also NF-kappaB-dependent
reporter gene expression is only partly affected. Our findings indicate that
parasite-induced IKK activity does not require functional Hsp90.
