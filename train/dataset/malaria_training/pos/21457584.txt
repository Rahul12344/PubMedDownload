BACKGROUND: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular
patterns and their activation leads to the induction of effector genes involving 
inflammatory cytokines that may have contribute to controlling parasite growth
and disease pathogenesis. The current immunogenetic study was designed to analyse
the key components of innate immunity, TLRs and TIRAP (Toll-interleukin-1
receptor domain-containing adaptor protein), also known as MAL (MYD88
adaptor-like), in Iranian patients with mild malaria.
METHODS: The tlr-4 (D299G and T399I), tlr-9 (T-1486C and T-1237C) and tirap
(S180L) genes were assessed in 640 Baluchi individuals (320 Plasmodium
falciparum-infected and 320 non-infected, median age of 28 years) from
malaria-endemic regions using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment
length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods.
RESULTS: Common tlr-4 SNPs and promoter SNPs of tlr-9 were distributed among P.
falciparum-infected and non-infected groups (P > 0.05) that showed no association
of these variants with mild clinical manifestation. The comparison of the tirap
S180L genotypes between patients with mild malaria and those healthy individuals 
showed that the frequency of heterozygosity was significantly higher in infected 
than non-infected individuals (33.8 vs. 25.6; OR, 1.479; 95% CI, 1.051-2.081; P =
0.024). The result also revealed a significant association of tirap S180L (P <
0.05) with development of mild malaria, which is common in Baluchi populations,
who are living in malaria hypoendemic region of Iran but not in African
populations (0%-6%).
CONCLUSION: These data point towards the need for addressing the exact role of
TLRs in contributing to human genetic factors in malaria
susceptibility/resistance/severity within different malaria settings in the
world.
