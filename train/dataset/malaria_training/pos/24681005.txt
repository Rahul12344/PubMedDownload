BACKGROUND: Various factors determine the outcome of Plasmodium falciparum
infection such as parasite load, sequestration, adhesion molecules, and immune
mediators. P. falciparum merozoite surface protein-1 (msp-1) and msp-2 genotypes 
were also found associated with severe disease. We investigated the association
between msp-1 and msp-2 genotypes in patients with uncomplicated malaria (UM) and
severe malaria (SM).
METHODS: Twenty-two malaria patients with microscopy-confirmed P. falciparum
infection and eight healthy endemic controls were selected for analysis. Nested
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify P. falciparum genotypes. The
plasma concentration of cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α),
interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)] and chemokines [chemokine
(C-X-C motif) ligand 9 (CXCL9) and CXCL10] were evaluated using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: TNF-α levels were significantly higher in both UM (389 pg/mL, p = 0.020)
and SM (771 pg/mL, p = 0.004) compared with healthy controls, while they were
greater in SM (p = 0.012) as compared to UM. CXCL9 levels were significantly
raised in SM as compared to UM and negative controls (NCs). CXCL10 levels were
raised in UM (550 pg/mL, p = 0.001) and SM (1480 pg/mL, p = 0.01) as compared
with NCs. Increased levels of IL-6 were found in patients carrying the FC27
allelic type of msp-2. A higher prevalence of MAD 20 and K1 msp-1 alleles was
observed in the SM group compared to UM.
CONCLUSION: Overall, a greater prevalence of MAD 20 alleles and increased serum
TNF-α and CXCL9 levels were associated with severe outcome in malaria.
Understanding the diversity of malaria genotypes is important for predicting
disease-related outcomes of P. falciparum infection in endemic areas.
