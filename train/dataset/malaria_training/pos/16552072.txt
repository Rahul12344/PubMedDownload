Osteopontin (OPN) knockout mice (OPN-KO mice) died of Plasmodium chabaudi
chabaudi infection, although wild-type (WT) mice had self-limiting infections.
OPN was detected in the WT mice at 2 days postinfection. OPN-KO mice produced
significantly smaller amounts of interleukin-12 and gamma interferon than WT mice
produced. These results suggested that OPN is involved in Th1-mediated immunity
against malaria infection.
