BACKGROUND: Serum concentrations of acute phase proteins can provide valuable
diagnostic information in the detection, prognosis, or monitoring of disease.
Information available on the acute phase response in naturally occurring canine
babesiosis is limited.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this investigation was to retrospectively evaluate
serum concentrations of haptoglobin, C-reactive protein, and ceruloplasmin in
dogs naturally infected with Babesia canis.
METHODS: Haptoglobin, C-reactive protein, and ceruloplasmin concentrations were
measured in serum samples from dogs with uncomplicated (n = 6) and complicated (n
= 1) babesiosis and compared with 6 healthy dogs.
RESULTS: Serum C-reactive protein and ceruloplasmin concentrations were
significantly higher in dogs with babesiosis; however, serum haptoglobin
concentration was significantly lower compared with control dogs (P <.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest that acute phase protein
concentrations could be beneficial in the diagnosis and determination of the
severity of babesiosis in dogs.
