In patients with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum infection cytokine-mediated 
serum protein levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), coeruloplasmin (COE), beta
2-microglobulin (B2M), alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG), alpha 1-antitrypsin
(AAT), haptoglobin (HPT), prealbumin (PRE), retinol binding protein (RBP),
albumin (ALB) and transferrin (TRF) were measured in an endemic area of the
Amazonian rain forest. Semi-immune (SI) and nonimmune (NI) patients were
investigated. In both patient groups the serum concentrations of CRP, COE and B2M
were elevated on admission. In addition AAG and AAT concentrations were increased
in NI patients compared to control subjects. Significantly lower serum
concentrations of HPT, PRE, RBP, ALB and TRF were seen in both patient groups
during the acute phase of the disease, and were more pronounced in NI patients.
After a 28-day follow-up, AAT and B2M were normal in SI patients but HPT, AAT and
B2M were still significantly altered in NI patients.
