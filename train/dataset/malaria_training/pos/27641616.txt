After invading red blood cells (RBCs), Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) can export its 
own proteins to the host membrane and activate endogenous channels that are
present in the membrane of RBCs. This transport pathway involves the Voltage
Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC). Moreover, ligands of the VDAC partner
TranSlocator PrOtein (TSPO) were demonstrated to inhibit the growth of the
parasite. We studied the expression of TSPO and VDAC isoforms in late erythroid
precursors, examined the presence of these proteins in membranes of non-infected 
and infected human RBCs, and evaluated the efficiency of TSPO ligands in
inhibiting plasmodium growth, transporting the haem analogue Zn-protoporphyrin-IX
(ZnPPIX) and enhancing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). TSPO
and VDAC isoforms are differentially expressed on erythroid cells in late
differentiation states. TSPO2 and VDAC are present in the membranes of mature
RBCs in a unique protein complex that changes the affinity of TSPO ligands after 
Pf infection. TSPO ligands dose-dependently inhibited parasite growth, and this
inhibition was correlated to ZnPPIX uptake and ROS accumulation in the infected
RBCs. Our results demonstrate that TSPO ligands can induce Pf death by increasing
the uptake of porphyrins through a TSPO2-VDAC complex, which leads to an
accumulation of ROS.
