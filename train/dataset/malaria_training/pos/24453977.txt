Cyclic paroxysm and high fever are hallmarks of malaria and are associated with
high levels of pyrogenic cytokines, including IL-1β. In this report, we describe 
a signature for the expression of inflammasome-related genes and caspase-1
activation in malaria. Indeed, when we infected mice, Plasmodium infection was
sufficient to promote MyD88-mediated caspase-1 activation, dependent on
IFN-γ-priming and the expression of inflammasome components ASC, P2X7R, NLRP3
and/or NLRP12. Pro-IL-1β expression required a second stimulation with LPS and
was also dependent on IFN-γ-priming and functional TNFR1. As a consequence of
Plasmodium-induced caspase-1 activation, mice produced extremely high levels of
IL-1β upon a second microbial stimulus, and became hypersensitive to septic
shock. Therapeutic intervention with IL-1 receptor antagonist prevented
bacterial-induced lethality in rodents. Similar to mice, we observed a
significantly increased frequency of circulating CD14(+)CD16(-)Caspase-1(+) and
CD14(dim)CD16(+)Caspase-1(+) monocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
febrile malaria patients. These cells readily produced large amounts of IL-1β
after stimulation with LPS. Furthermore, we observed the presence of inflammasome
complexes in monocytes from malaria patients containing either NLRP3 or NLRP12
pyroptosomes. We conclude that NLRP12/NLRP3-dependent activation of caspase-1 is 
likely to be a key event in mediating systemic production of IL-1β and
hypersensitivity to secondary bacterial infection during malaria.
