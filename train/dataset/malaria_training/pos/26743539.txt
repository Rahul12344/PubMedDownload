BACKGROUND: Alterations of blood coagulation are thought to be involved in
malaria pathogenesis. This study had the aim to investigate changes of blood
coagulation under the standardized conditions of controlled human malaria
infection.
METHODS: In a clinical trial aseptic, purified, cryopreserved Plasmodium
falciparum sporozoites were intravenously (n = 24) or intradermally (n = 6)
injected into 30 healthy volunteers. Twenty-two participants developed
parasitaemia. Serial blood samples before and during prepatent period and at
parasitaemia, diagnosed by microscopic assessment of thick blood smear, were
obtained. Biomarkers of blood coagulation (thrombin generation potential,
D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, von Willebrand factor, ADAMTS13 activity and
soluble P-selectin) were determined.
RESULTS: At first detection of P. falciparum parasitaemia, 72.7% of volunteers
had peak thrombin generation 10% above their baseline. Overall, peak thrombin
generation was 17.7% higher at parasitaemia compared to baseline [median
(25th-75th percentile): 225.4 nM (168.1-295.6) vs. 191.5 nM (138.2-231.9); p =
0.026]. There were no significant changes of other coagulation parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: The thrombin generation potential, an in vitro blood coagulation
test, which reflects an individual´s global coagulation status, was increased by 
17.7% at very early stages of P. falciparum malaria, suggesting a hypercoagulable
state may be induced, even when parasite density is low.
