In an unmatched case-control study of 63 non-immune European patients with
uncomplicated (n = 52) and complicated (n = 11) falciparum malaria, serum levels 
of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), heart-type fatty
acid-binding protein (H-FABP), myoglobin, troponin T and creatin kinase-muscle
brain were compared. Elevated levels of NT-proBNP and H-FABP indicated myocardial
impairment in complicated but not in uncomplicated falciparum malaria. The
clinical impact of these findings remains to be evaluated. The pathophysiology of
cardiac impairment in complicated falciparum malaria warrants further
investigation.
