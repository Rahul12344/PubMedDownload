Cerebral malaria is a serious complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection. We
have investigated the role of perforin in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria in
a murine model (Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection). C57BL/6 mice
demonstrated the typical neuropathological symptoms of experimental cerebral
malaria infection from day 5p.i. and became moribund on day 6p.i. This pathology 
was not seen in PbA-infected, perforin-deficient (pfp-/-) mice. From days 5-6p.i.
onwards there was a significant increase in mRNA for granzyme B and CD8, but not 
CD4, in brain tissue from PbA-infected C57BL/6 and pfp-/- mouse brains. Perforin 
mRNA was strongly increased in the brains of PbA-infected C57BL/6 mice on day
6p.i. Immunohistochemistry revealed increased perforin staining and elevated
numbers of CD8(+) cells within the cerebral microvessels in PbA-infected C57BL/6 
at days 5 and 6p.i. compared with uninfected animals. At day 6p.i., there were
TUNEL-positive cells and activated caspase-3 positive cells of endothelial
morphology in the CNS of PbA-infected C57BL/6 mice. The TUNEL-positive cells were
greatly reduced in pfp-/- mice. These results suggest that CD8(+)T lymphocytes
induce apoptosis of endothelial cells via a perforin-dependent process,
contributing to the fatal pathogenic process in murine cerebral malaria.
