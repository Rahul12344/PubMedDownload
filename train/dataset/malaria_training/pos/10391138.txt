Reactive oxygen species are important mediators of tissue injury during malaria
infection. The status of hepatic oxidative stress and antioxidant defence indices
were studied during Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis (P. y. nigeriensis) infection
and chloroquine/ polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid stabilized with polylysine and
carboxymethylcellulose (poly ICLC) treatment of infected mice. P. y. nigeriensis 
infection resulted in a significant increase in oxidative stress indices viz.,
xanthine oxidase and rate of lipid peroxidation (LPO). This was accompanied by a 
highly significant increase in antioxidant defence indices viz., reduced
glutathione (GSH) and glutathione reductase while superoxide dismutase (SOD) and 
catalase showed a highly significant decrease with respect to normal mice.
Chloroquine treatment of infected mice caused a decrease in parasitaemia which
was associated with restoration of indices altered during infection towards
normalization. Poly ICLC treatment of infected mice caused no change in blood
parasitaemia but resulted in a significant increase in GSH, glutathione
reductase, SOD and catalase with respect to infected mice. Combination therapy of
chloroquine and poly ICLC resulted in clearance of parasitaemia and restoration
of all oxidative stress and antioxidant defence indices to normal levels.
