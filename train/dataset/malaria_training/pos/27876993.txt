A 4 year old male Rottweiler was presented to Teaching Veterinary Clinics of
GADVASU with a primary complaint of paraplegia, fever and inappetence. The dog
was found to be dull with elevated rectal temperature (105 °F), heart rate (158
per minute) and respiration rate (57 per minute). Blood smear examination and PCR
assay revealed that dog was positive for Babesia gibsoni. Elevated bilirubin,
alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, total leucocyte
count, neutrophils and hypoglycaemia were haemato-biochemical alterations. The
therapy targeting babesiosis was carried out with a single dose of diminazene
aceturate in combination with doxycycline, enrofloxacin and metronidazole for
21 days. Complete follow up of the case revealed complete clinical recovery
within 21 days.
