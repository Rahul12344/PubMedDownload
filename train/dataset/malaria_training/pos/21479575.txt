Malaria infection leads to anemia in humans which generally occurs during the
chronic phase of the infection. The role that erythropoietic molecules play for
anemia during malaria at low parasitemia levels is still controversial due to the
lack of suitable animal models which might mimic this condition. In this regard, 
α-tocopherol transfer protein knockout mice, with undetectable levels of vitamin 
E in circulation, were possibly used as a model to investigate the role that
erythropoietic molecules such as erythropoietin (EPO), erythropoietin receptor
(EPOR), and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) play on the outcome of
anemia during uncomplicated malaria infection at low parasitemias. The results
indicate that the degree of parasitemia unlikely plays any important effect on
mRNA expression of EPO and EPOR in different organs. Moreover, even though EPO
and EPOR productions are impaired in the kidney and bone marrow, respectively,
other organs such as the liver and spleen intend to compensate production of
these cytokines to prevent anemia in the infected animals.
