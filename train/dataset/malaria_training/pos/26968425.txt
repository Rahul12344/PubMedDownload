Interleukin-27 (IL-27) is a heterodimeric regulatory cytokine of the IL-12
family, which is produced by macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells upon
stimulation through innate immune receptors. Here, we described regulatory CD4(+)
T cells that produce IL-27 in response to T cell receptor stimulation during
malaria infection, inhibiting IL-2 production and clonal expansion of other T
cells in an IL-27-dependent manner. IL-27-producing CD4(+) T cells were
Foxp3(-)CD11a(+)CD49d(+) malaria antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells and were
distinct from interferon-γ (IFN-γ) producing Th1 or IL-10 producing Tr1 cells. In
mice lacking IL-27 in T cells, IL-2 production was restored and clonal expansion 
and IFN-γ production by specific CD4(+) T cells were improved, culminating in
reduced parasite burden. This study highlights a unique population of IL-27
producing regulatory CD4(+) T cells and their critical role in the regulation of 
the protective immune response against malaria parasites.
