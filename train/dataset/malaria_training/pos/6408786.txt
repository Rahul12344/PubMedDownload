Complement activation and fibrinolysis during infection with Theileria parva
(East Coast fever) in cattle.

The role played by complement and fibrinolysis in the pathogenesis of pulmonary
oedema and the disseminated, subendothelial, petechial haemorrhages in cattle
infected with Theileria parva was investigated. There was a marked reduction in
total haemolytic complement in animals that died of this disease whereas the
survivors showed only transient changes. The reduction in C3 levels in animals
with severe disease, however, was equivalent to that in the survivors. Neither
circulating soluble immune complexes nor free antibody against macroschizonts
were detected in sera from cattle with severe infection. In addition to the
complement changes, high levels of fibrinogen degradation products (FDPs) were
detected in sera from the infected animals. The rate of production of FDPs and
reduction in total haemolytic complement paralleled the clinical course of the
disease. It is, therefore, suggested that the pulmonary oedema and disseminated
petechial haemorrhages seen in East Coast fever may be the direct result of the
combined effects of complement activation and consumption of fibrinogen and
fibrin.
