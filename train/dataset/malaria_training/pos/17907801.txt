Plasmodium falciparum uses gC1qR/HABP1/p32 as a receptor to bind to vascular
endothelium and for platelet-mediated clumping.

The ability of Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells (IRBCs) to bind to 
vascular endothelium, thus enabling sequestration in vital host organs, is an
important pathogenic mechanism in malaria. Adhesion of P. falciparum IRBCs to
platelets, which results in the formation of IRBC clumps, is another
cytoadherence phenomenon that is associated with severe disease. Here, we have
used in vitro cytoadherence assays to demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first
time, that P. falciparum IRBCs use the 32-kDa human protein gC1qR/HABP1/p32 as a 
receptor to bind to human brain microvascular endothelial cells. In addition, we 
show that P. falciparum IRBCs can also bind to gC1qR/HABP1/p32 on platelets to
form clumps. Our study has thus identified a novel host receptor that is used for
both adhesion to vascular endothelium and platelet-mediated clumping. Given the
association of adhesion to vascular endothelium and platelet-mediated clumping
with severe disease, adhesion to gC1qR/HABP1/p32 by P. falciparum IRBCs may play 
an important role in malaria pathogenesis.
