Immunoresponsiveness in acute babesiosis in humans.

Benach JL, Habicht GS, Hamburger MI.

Immunoresponsiveness in patients with acute babesiosis was characterized.
Lymphocyte subpopulations, mononuclear cell responses to nonspecific mitogens,
and serum immunochemical values were studied in patients during acute babesiosis 
and after recovery (four to 40 months), controls, and seropositive individuals.
Serum studies were also carried out retrospectively on stored sera from patients 
with babesiosis. Mean and differential lymphocyte counts and percentages of B
lymphocytes were higher than in controls in patients with acute babesiosis, and
levels of T lymphocytes bearing the IgG Fc receptor (T gamma) were significantly 
(P less than 0.01) elevated. Responses to nonspecific mitogens were suppressed
during acute babesiosis. Levels of serum IgG and IgM and Clq binding were
significantly increased whereas C3 and C4 levels and hemolytic activity were
suppressed in acute-phase sera. The apparent paradox of an increased T
suppressor/cytotoxic population in the presence of evidence of increased in vivo 
lymphocyte function is discussed in terms of the heterogeneity of the T gamma
subpopulation.
