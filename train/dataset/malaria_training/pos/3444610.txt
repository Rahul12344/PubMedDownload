Serologically negative horses, as determined with the indirect fluorescent
antibody test (IFA), were infected with Babesia equi and 60 days later with
Babesia caballi. The only clinical signs of disease observed in these animals
were a febrile reaction and slight icterus. Haematological changes included a
drop in haematocrit and haemoglobin concentration, as well as lowered platelet
counts. The serum concentrations of albumin, iron and phosphorus were lowered.
Mildly elevated serum bilirubin and fibrinogen concentrations were observed.
Antibody titres were determined with the IFA and complement fixation (CF) tests. 
Antibodies to B. equi were first detected between Days 10-19 and 12-38 with the
IFA and CF test, respectively, while the corresponding IFA periods for B. caballi
were 6-8 days after infection. The parasitaemia of both B. equi and B. caballi
infections never reached the 1% level.
