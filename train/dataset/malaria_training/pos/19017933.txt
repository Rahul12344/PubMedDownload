Studies in experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) in mice have identified T cells
and TNF family members as critical mediators of pathology. In this study we
report a role for LIGHT-lymphotoxin beta Receptor (LTbetaR) signaling in the
development of ECM and control of parasite growth. Specific blockade of
LIGHT-LTbetaR, but not LIGHT-herpesvirus entry mediator interactions, abrogated
the accumulation of parasites and the recruitment of pathogenic CD8(+) T cells
and monocytes to the brain during infection without affecting early activation of
CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, or NK cells. Importantly, blockade of
LIGHT-LTbetaR signaling caused the expansion of splenic monocytes and an overall 
enhanced capacity to remove and process Ag during infection, as well as reduced
systemic cytokine levels when control mice displayed severe ECM symptoms. In
summary, we have discovered a novel pathogenic role for LIGHT and LTbetaR in ECM,
identifying this TNF family receptor-ligand interaction as an important immune
regulator during experimental malaria.
