Lactoferrin (LF), a human serum protein, strongly inhibited the adherence of
Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (PE) to immobilized chondroitin
sulfate A (CSA)-conjugated albumin at a concentration of 100 microg/mL and
blocked the PE binding to CD36-expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, as
well as immobilized CD36 at concentrations of 5 microg/mL and 100 microg/mL,
respectively. Biotinylated LF bound to CD36 in a saturable manner, and such
binding was inhibited by unlabeled LF and the anti-CD36 monoclonal antibody, 8A6,
suggesting specificity of binding. Additionally, LF inhibited PE binding to
immobilized thrombospondin (TSP) at a concentration of 100 microg/mL, and
specific binding of LF to TSP was confirmed using biotinylated LF. LF inhibited
PE binding to C32 amelanotic melanoma cells in a dose-dependent manner. A peptide
of LF, Arg-Asn-Met Arg-Lys-Val Arg-Gly-Pro-Pro-Val-Ser-Cys (amino acid residues
25-37 of LF), which has been suggested to contribute to LF binding to various
materials, including CSA, inhibited PE binding to immobilized CSA-conjugated
albumin, immobilized CD36, CD36-expressing CHO cells, immobilized TSP, and C32
amelanotic melanoma cells, as well as LF itself. These results suggest that LF
peptide may provide the basis for developing agents that are able to inhibit
CSA-, CD36-, and TSP-mediated cytoadherence of PE.
