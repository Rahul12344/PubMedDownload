Malaria-associated lung pathology has been a neglected area in the study of
malaria complications. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is an inflammatory
mediator involved in lung inflammation. Using mice lacking the PAF receptor
(PAFR(-/-)) we investigated the relevance of signaling through the PAFR for the
lung inflammatory process triggered by Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) strain
infection. In PAFR(-/-) mice, pulmonary inflammation was markedly reduced as
demonstrated by histology, production of certain pro-inflammatory mediators,
accumulation of macrophage and CD8+ T cells in the lung parenchyma and the
virtual absence of changes in vascular permeability. Therefore, PAFR activation
is crucial in the pathogenesis of pulmonary damage associated with PbA infection 
in C57Bl/6 mice.
