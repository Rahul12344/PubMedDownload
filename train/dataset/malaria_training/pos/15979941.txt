It is commonly acknowledged that intracellular parasites manipulate the survival 
pathways of the host cells to their own ends. Theileria are masters of this
because they invade bovine leukocytes and immortalize them. Host-cell survival
depends on the presence of live parasites, and parasite death results in the
leukocyte undergoing programmed cell death. The parasite, therefore, activates
several anti-apoptotic pathways in host cells to ensure its own survival. In B
cells that are infected by Theileria parva, one of the main mechanisms involves
the induction of c-Myc and the subsequent activation of the anti-apoptotic
protein Mcl-1. Activation of Myc might occur in other types of leukocyte that are
infected by Theileria and in other host cells that are infected with different
parasites.
