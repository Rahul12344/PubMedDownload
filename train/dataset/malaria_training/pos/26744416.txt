Genome-wide searches for loci involved in human resistance to malaria are
currently being conducted on a large scale in Africa using case-control studies. 
Here, we explore the utility of an alternative approach-"environmental
correlation analysis, ECA," which tests for clines in allele frequencies across a
gradient of an environmental selection pressure-to identify genes that have
historically protected against death from malaria. We collected genotype data
from 12,425 newborns on 57 candidate malaria resistance loci and 9,756 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected at random from across the genome, and
examined their allele frequencies for geographic correlations with long-term
malaria prevalence data based on 84,042 individuals living under different
historical selection pressures from malaria in coastal Kenya. None of the 57
candidate SNPs showed significant (P < 0.05) correlations in allele frequency
with local malaria transmission intensity after adjusting for population
structure and multiple testing. In contrast, two of the random SNPs that had
highly significant correlations (P < 0.01) were in genes previously linked to
malaria resistance, namely, CDH13, encoding cadherin 13, and HS3ST3B1, encoding
heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferase 3B1. Both proteins play a role in
glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell adhesion which has been widely implicated in
cerebral malaria, the most life-threatening form of this disease. Other top
genes, including CTNND2 which encodes δ-catenin, a molecular partner to cadherin,
were significantly enriched in cadherin-mediated pathways affecting inflammation 
of the brain vascular endothelium. These results demonstrate the utility of ECA
in the discovery of novel genes and pathways affecting infectious disease.
