Serum pools from mice undergoing lethal infection with Plasmodium berghei inhibit
the growth of an IL2-dependent mouse cytotoxic T cell line (CTLL). A partially
purified preparation of the inhibitory factor specifically inhibited IL2-mediated
events such as IL2-dependent CTLL growth and the Con A mitogenic response of
normal mouse spleen cells. Production of and response to IL1, as well as growth
of myeloma lines, was not affected. Administration of the partially purified
preparation to normal mice resulted in a significant depression in IL2
production, thereby indicating a role for the inhibitory factor in maintaining
immune depression in malaria-infected mice.
