Spleen cell changes during fatal and self-limiting malarial infections of mice.

Freeman RR, Parish CR.

Changes in the proportions and total numbers of splenic Thy-1.2+ cells, Ig+ cells
and normoblasts were analysed during fatal Plasmodium berghei and non-fatal P.
yoelii infections in mice. Thy-1.2+ and Ig+ cells were identified by rosetting
techniques, and normoblasts by morphological criteria. The splenomegaly observed 
during these infections was found to be caused mainly by proliferation of
normoblasts. An early increase in the numbers of Thy-1.2+ and Ig+ cells was
detected in both infections, but in P. berghei infections these responses were
subsequently suppressed. In P. yoelii infections Thy-1.2+ and Ig+ cell numbers
were maintained at four to five-fold above normal levels until the mice had
completely recovered. During the acute phase of P. yoelii infection it appeared
that most splenic T-cells expressed surface immunoglobulin.
