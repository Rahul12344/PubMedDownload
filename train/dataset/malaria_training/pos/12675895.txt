Infection with Babesia bovis was diagnosed in a 2-day-old female calf apparently 
transmitted in utero. The calf was born as the second calving to a cross-bred
beef cow permanently on pasture. Diagnosis was based upon identification of B.
bovis in peripheral blood smears and clinical signs which included fever,
jaundice, pale mucous membranes and convulsions. Anaemia, leucocytosis,
thrombocytopenia and lymphocytosis were noted at the febrile acute stage of the
disease. The blood smears revealed evidence of regeneration of toxic neutrophils 
with a left shift, severe spherocytosis and high degree of basophilic stippling. 
Elevated concentration of aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and 
creatine kinase were also noted, and were probably the result of haemolysis,
dehydration and muscle damage because of recumbancy. Elevated total bilirubin
concentration following haemolysis resulted in jaundice. The neurological
symptoms observed were probably caused by sludging of parasitized erythrocytes in
the brain capillaries. The calf recovered following treatment with diminazene
aceturate and the recovery was followed up clinically, haematologically and
biochemically.
