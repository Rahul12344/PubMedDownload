To explore the hypothesis that susceptibility to cerebral malaria is influenced
by genetic variation in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), we genotyped
three commonly defined polymorphic loci of eNOS, Glu(298)-->Asp, intron 4
variable number of tandem repeat region, and T-786-->C, in 244 patients (mean
age, 36.2 years) with mild malaria and 194 patients (mean age, 35.6 years) with
severe malaria belonging to same ethnic group in Orissa, an eastern Indian state.
We found that there was an association of the Glu(298)-->Asp substitution (P =
0.0037; odds ratio, 1.95; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 3.0) and a single
unique haplotype defined by "C-b-Asp" (P(corrected) = 0.0024) for protection
against cerebral malaria. Further, the median plasma level of nitrite-nitrate was
found to be increased in individuals with the Glu(298)-->Asp substitution and was
significantly higher in the mild malaria group (P <or= 0.0001), but the increase 
was not significant in the severe malaria group (P = 0.0528). These findings
suggest that the Glu(298)-->Asp substitution and the "C-b-Asp" haplotype may
enhance eNOS expression and NO production, which leads to protection against
cerebral malaria. These findings may increase our understanding of the
pathogenesis of malaria.
