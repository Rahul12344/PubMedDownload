OBJECTIVE: To determine pharmacokinetics after oral administration of a single
dose of terbinafine hydrochloride to Hispaniolan Amazon parrots (Amazona
ventralis).
ANIMALS: 6 healthy adult Hispaniolan Amazon parrots.
PROCEDURES: A single dose of terbinafine hydrochloride (60 mg/kg) was
administered orally to each bird, which was followed immediately by
administration of a commercially available gavage feeding formula. Blood samples 
were collected at the time of drug administration (time 0) and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2,
4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after drug administration. Plasma concentrations of
terbinafine were determined via high-performance liquid chromatography.
RESULTS: Data from 1 bird were discarded because of a possible error in the dose 
of drug administered. After oral administration of terbinafine, the maximum
concentration for the remaining 5 fed birds ranged from 109 to 671 ng/mL,
half-life ranged from 6 to 13.5 hours, and time to the maximum concentration
ranged from 2 to 8 hours. No adverse effects were observed.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Analysis of the results indicated that oral
administration of terbinafine at a dose of 60 mg/kg to Amazon parrots did not
result in adverse effects and may be potentially of use in the treatment of
aspergillosis. Additional studies are needed to determine treatment efficacy and 
safety.
