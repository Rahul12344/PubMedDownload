The protective immunity of natural killer (NK) cells against malarial infections 
is thought to be due to early production of type II interferon (IFN) and possibly
direct NK cell cytotoxicity. To better understand this mechanism, a microarray
analysis was conducted on NK cells from healthy donors PBMCs that were
co-cultured with P. falciparum 3D7-infected erythrocytes. A very similar pattern 
of gene expression was observed among all donors for each treatment in three
replicas. Parasites particularly modulated genes involved in IFN-α/β signaling as
well as molecules involved in the activation of interferon regulatory factors,
pathways known to play a role in the antimicrobial immune response. This pattern 
of transcription was entirely different from that shown by NK cells treated with 
IL-12 and IL-18, in which IFN-γ- and TREM-1-related genes were over-expressed.
These results suggest that P. falciparum parasites and the cytokines IL-12 and
IL-18 have diverse imprints on the transcriptome of human primary NK cells.
IFN-α-related genes are the prominent molecules induced by parasites on NK cells 
and arise as candidate biomarkers that merit to be further investigated as
potential new tools in malaria control.
