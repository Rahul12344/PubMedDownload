Plasmodium falciparum infection generally induces elevated total plasma levels of
immunoglobulins, some of which recognize self- or parasite-specific antigens. To 
our knowledge, we are the first to report high levels of functional
immunoglobulin E (IgE) autoantibodies recognizing brain 14-3-3 protein ε in
asymptomatic P. falciparum malaria. 14-3-3 ε protein belongs to a family of
proteins that binds to CD81, a member of the tetraspanin superfamily elicited in 
hepatocyte invasion by sporozoites. Levels of expression of 14-3-3 ε protein were
found to be increased in vivo and in vitro during Plasmodium yoelii and P.
falciparum intrahepatic development. Collectively, these results indicate that
self-reactive IgE is produced during malaria. In addition, the negative
correlation between levels of self-reactive IgE to 14-3-3 ε protein and
parasitemia in asymptomatic malaria due to P. falciparum supports a role for
these IgE molecules in defense mechanisms, probably by interfering with
development of liver-stage parasites through the CD81 pathway.
