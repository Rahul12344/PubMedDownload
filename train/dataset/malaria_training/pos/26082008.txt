OBJECTIVE: To characterize hemostasis and determine if disseminated intravascular
coagulation (DIC) is present in cats with cytauxzoonosis.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: University teaching hospital.
ANIMALS: Five client-owned cats with cytologic and PCR-confirmed cytauxzoonosis.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Admission samples were collected for hemostasis
testing including platelet count, activated partial thromboplastin time,
prothrombin time, fibrinogen, antithrombin (AT), d-dimer, protein C, plasminogen,
antiplasmin, factors VII, VIII, IX, X, and XI, von Willebrand factor, and
thromboelastography. Results were compiled for combined criteria used to define
DIC, and all 5 cats satisfied criteria using a previously described modified
scoring system for DIC in cats. The abnormalities found in all 5 cats included
thrombocytopenia, low protein C activity, and prolonged prothrombin time;
however, none of the cats had low AT activity. None of the cats had clinical
signs of hemorrhage despite thrombocytopenia, coagulation factor deficiency (5/5 
cats), and thromboelastographic evidence of hypocoagulability (2/5 cats). Three
of 5 cats survived to hospital discharge. The nonsurvivors had disseminated
cytauxzoonosis with schizont-laden macrophages in vessels of various organs.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report that comprehensively describes the
hemostastic status of cats with naturally occurring infection with Cytauxzoon
felis. All 5 cats had laboratory evidence of overt DIC. Unlike human and canine
models of sepsis-induced DIC, AT deficiency was not found in this series of cats.
Further research is warranted to investigate therapeutic strategies targeting
thrombotic DIC to improve survival in cats with cytauxzoonosis.
