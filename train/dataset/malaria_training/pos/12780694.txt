Release of soluble Granzymes (sGranzymes) is considered to reflect activation of 
cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells. sGranzymes and a number of pro-inflammatory
cytokines were measured in plasma of malaria patients with natural or
experimentally induced Plasmodium falciparum infections. Concentrations of
sGranzyme A and B, IL-10, IL-12p70 and CRP were significantly increased in
African children presenting with clinical malaria; IL-10 and CRP concentrations
were significantly correlated with disease severity. In nonimmune Dutch
volunteers which were experimentally infected by P. falciparum-infected
mosquitoes, sGranzyme A increment started 1-2 days prior to clinical symptoms and
microscopically detectable parasitaemia. This coincided with increases in
IFNgamma, IL-12p40 and IL-8, while sGranzyme B and IL-10 levels increased 24-48 h
later. The elevation of sGranzyme A and IFNgamma in nonimmune volunteers suggests
that NK cells are activated upon release of parasites by infected liver cells and
subsequently during blood stage infection; thus, NK cells are likely involved
innate immune human host resistance in the early phase of a malaria infection.
