Using an improved procedure of pulsed field gel electrophoresis, yeast
chromosomes were separated over a wide range of molecular size (250-4000 kbp) on 
single gels. The chromosomal DNA patterns of all the species belonging to the
genus Kluyveromyces were examined. Within the species K. marxianus, the varieties
lactis, drosophilarum and vanudenii showed closely related patterns: very
different from them, the varieties bulgaricus and marxianus were related to each 
other, forming a distinct group; the strains commonly called 'K. lactis' and 'K. 
fragilis' were unambiguously different from each other in chromosome patterns.
These differences were correlated with the presence of characteristic repetitive 
sequence elements in the mitochondrial DNA of the former group and not in the
latter. Analysis of Candida macedoniensis, which had been considered to be an
anamorph of K. marxianus var. marxianus, showed that these two yeast species were
indeed similar in chromosome patterns and in mitochondrial DNA restriction
patterns.
