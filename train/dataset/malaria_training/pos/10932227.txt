The parasite Plasmodium berghei imports the enzyme delta-aminolevulinate
dehydratase (ALAD), and perhaps the subsequent enzymes of the pathway from the
host red blood cell to sustain heme synthesis. Here we have studied the mechanism
of this import. A 65-kDa protein on the P. berghei membrane specifically bound to
mouse red blood cell ALAD, and a 93-amino-acid fragment (ALAD-DeltaNC) of the
host erythrocyte ALAD was able to compete with the full-length enzyme for binding
to the P. berghei membrane. ALAD-DeltaNC was taken up by the infected red blood
cell when added to a culture of P. falciparum and this led to a substantial
decrease in ALAD protein and enzyme activity and, subsequently, heme synthesis in
the parasite, resulting in its death.
