Administration of ground-up tick tissue stabilate (0.75 tick equivalent) by the
subcutaneous route to crossbred calves aged 1 week to 1 month led to the
development of acute theileriosis. Haematological studies revealed significant
progressive decreases in haemoglobin concentration, packed cell volume and red
blood cell count, whereas the total leukocyte count showed an initial
non-significant leukocytosis followed by a significant leukopenia. Analysis of
serum revealed significant increases in levels of alanine aminotransferase,
aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine kinase and
gamma-glutamyltransferase, and in the concentrations of uric acid, blood urea
nitrogen and bilirubin. The concentrations of total protein, albumin, glucose,
cholesterol and calcium showed non-significant decreases, while phosphorus
decreased significantly during the terminal stages of the disease.
