The role of calcium in the invasion of the human erythrocyte by the parasite
Plasmodium falciparum was studied. The intraerythrocytic and intraparasitic
concentrations of Ca2+ were modified using calcium-ionophore A23187 and the
chelator EGTA. The Ca2+ inside the parasite appeared to be necessary for the
normal completion of invasion. We determined that in recently invaded
erythrocytes (2 h), the Ca2+ concentration increased about 10 times. Merozoite
invasion produced a decrease in beta-spectrin phosphorylation and an increase in 
the phosphorylation of a protein with band 4.1 mobility. These changes were
similar to those produced by an ionophore-mediated Ca2+ influx in uninfected
erythrocytes. These facts support the idea that a calcium influx into
erythrocytes might precede or accompany merozoite invasion, triggering a series
of molecular events, including phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of
cystoskeletal proteins.
