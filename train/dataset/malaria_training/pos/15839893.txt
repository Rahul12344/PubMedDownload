We found that phoshatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3-K) markedly contributes to the
increased surface expression of bovine transferrin receptor (TfR) on
Theileria-infected lymphocytes. We observed that all aspects of TfR turnover are 
upregulated in parasitized B cells and we were able to detect TfR colocalizing
with EEA1 (early endosome antigen 1) and Rab11 at the ultrastructure level in
Theileria-infected B cells. We demonstrated recycling of TfR through Rab5- and
Rab11-positive compartments by transfection of dominant negative guanosine
diphosphate (GDP)-on mutants of the GTPases. Therefore, in Theileria-transformed 
B cells constitutive PI3-K activity leads to accelerated TfR recycling through
Rab5- and Rab11-positive compartments.
