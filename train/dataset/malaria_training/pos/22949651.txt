The host mechanisms responsible for protection against malaria remain poorly
understood, with only a few protective genetic effects mapped in humans. Here, we
characterize a host-specific genome-wide signature in whole-blood transcriptomes 
of Plasmodium falciparum-infected West African children and report a
demonstration of genotype-by-infection interactions in vivo. Several associations
involve transcripts sensitive to infection and implicate complement system,
antigen processing and presentation, and T-cell activation (i.e., SLC39A8, C3AR1,
FCGR3B, RAD21, RETN, LRRC25, SLC3A2, and TAPBP), including one association that
validated a genome-wide association candidate gene (SCO1), implicating binding
variation within a noncoding regulatory element. Gene expression profiles in mice
infected with Plasmodium chabaudi revealed and validated similar responses and
highlighted specific pathways and genes that are likely important responders in
both hosts. These results suggest that host variation and its interplay with
infection affect children's ability to cope with infection and suggest a
polygenic model mounted at the transcriptional level for susceptibility.
