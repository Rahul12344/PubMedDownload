Histidine-rich protein II (HRPII) is an abundant protein released into the
bloodstream by Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes the most severe
form of human malaria. Here, we report that HRPII binds tightly and selectively
to coagulation-active glycosaminoglycans (dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, and 
heparin) and inhibits antithrombin (AT). In purified systems, recombinant HRPII
neutralized the heparin-catalyzed inhibition of factor Xa and thrombin by AT in a
Zn(2+)-dependent manner. The observed 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) for
the HRPII neutralization of AT activity is approximately 30nM for factor Xa
inhibition and 90nM for thrombin inhibition. Zn(2+) was required for these
reactions with a distribution coefficient (K(d)) of approximately 7Î¼M.
Substituting Zn(2+) with Cu(2+), but not with Ca(2+), Mg(2+), or Fe(2+),
maintained the HRPII effect. HRPII attenuated the prolongation in plasma clotting
time induced by heparin, suggesting that HRPII inhibits AT activity by preventing
its stimulation by heparin. In the microvasculature, where erythrocytes infected 
with P falciparum are sequestered, high levels of released HRPII may bind
cellular glycosaminoglycans, prevent their interaction with AT, and thereby
contribute to the procoagulant state associated with P falciparum infection.
