Babesia rodhaini: requirement of complement for penetration of human
erythrocytes.

Chapman WE, Ward PA.

A system has been developed in vitro in which human red cells, in the presence of
fresh human (or rat) serum, are parasitized by the hemosporidian protozoan
Babesia rodhaini. The ability of B. rodhaini to penetrate red cells depends on
factors of the alternative complement pathway (properdin and factor B) as well as
ionic magnesium and the third (C3) and the fifth (C5) components of complement.
These data indicate a novel mechanism by which a parasite is able to utilize the 
complement system. The data are in accord with and further amplify earlier
observations that demonstrated a requirement for complement in the development of
babesial infection in rats.
