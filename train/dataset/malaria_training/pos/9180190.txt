Cerebral expression of c-fos protein was studied by immunocytochemistry in murine
cerebral malaria (CM) and malaria without cerebral involvement (non-CM). c-fos
expression, low in the brains of uninfected mice, increased in frequency,
intensity, and distribution during the course of fatal CM (e.g., a 70-fold
increase on day 7 after inoculation). These changes paralleled the timing and
degree of the neurologic complications and histopathologic changes. Only a slight
increase in c-fos expression was detectable in non-CM mice on day 7 after
inoculation. Dexamethasone treatment (days 0 and 1 after inoculation) of the CM
mice largely prevented the increased cerebral c-fos expression, histopathologic
changes, cerebral complications, and death. Increased c-fos expression may
indicate the specific neuronal pathways activated by the immunopathologic process
of fatal murine CM and could be associated with the behavioral changes and
neurologic complications in this model.
