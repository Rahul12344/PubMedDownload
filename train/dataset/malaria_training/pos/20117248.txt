adults.

To explore the hypothesis that angiotensin II may play a role in the
susceptibility to cerebral malaria (CM), we performed a genetic association study
of malaria patients in Orissa, India analyzing three SNPs (ACE2 C-->T, iNOS
C-->T, eNOS Glu-->Asp) and two I/D polymorphisms (ACE I/D and IL-4 B1/B2). Our
results showed that the 'D' allele of ACE I/D polymorphism, responsible for
increased Ang II production had a significant association with mild malaria and
the ACE2 C-->T substitution had gender specific effect of possibly reduced
expression of ACE2 in presence of 'T' allele in women leading to increased level 
of Ang II and hence protection against CM. Combined genotype analysis of eNOS
Glu-->Asp substitution responsible for increased NO production in Plasmodium
falciparum infected individuals and ACE I/D polymorphism also showed stronger
association of (Glu-Asp+Asp-Asp/ID+DD) genotypes with mild malaria (P<0.0001).
Whether by its antiplasmodial activity and/or by some unknown mechanisms, Ang II 
protects from susceptibility to cerebral malaria remains to be investigated.
These genetic findings may contribute to the understanding of malaria
pathogenesis.
