A genetic dissection approach was employed to determine whether the IL-2 receptor
complex (IL-2R) comprised of α, β and γ chains is required for the suppression of
Plasmodium chabaudi adami parasitemia. Blood-stage infections in IL-2Rγ(c)(-/y)
mice failed to cure with parasitemia remaining elevated for > 50 days indicating 
the IL-2Rγ(c) through which all members of the γ(c) family of cytokines signal
has an essential role in protective immunity against blood-stage malarial
parasites. In contrast, the curing of parasitemia in IL-2/15Rβ⁻/⁻ mice, deficient
in both IL-2 and IL-15 signalling was significantly delayed but did occur,
indicating that neither cytokine plays an essential role in parasite clearance.
Moreover, the observation that the time course of parasitemia in IL-15⁻/⁻ mice
was nearly identical to that seen in controls suggests that the
parasitemia-suppressing role of stimulating through the IL-2/15Rβ chain is owing 
to IL-2 signalling and not a redundant function of IL-15.
