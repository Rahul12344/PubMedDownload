Cerebral involvement during malaria is a complication that leads to seizure,
coma, and death. The effect of new neuroprotective therapies has not yet been
investigated, although cerebral malaria shares some features with neurological
stroke. Erythropoietin (EPO) is one of the more promising drugs in this area. We 
measured the effect of EPO on the survival of mice infected with Plasmodium
berghei ANKA and demonstrated that inoculations of recombinant human EPO at the
beginning of the clinical manifestations of cerebral malaria protect >90% of mice
from death. This drug has no effect on the course of parasitemia. The effect of
EPO was not related to either the inhibition of apoptosis in the brain or the
regulation of the increase and decrease of nitric oxide production in the brain
and blood, respectively. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma mRNA
overexpression was inhibited by EPO, and treated mice had fewer brain
hemorrhages. EPO has been used in patients with chronic diseases for years, and
more recently it has been used to treat acute ischemic stroke. The data presented
here provide the first evidence indicating that this cytokine could be useful for
the symptomatic prevention of mortality during the acute stage of cerebral
malaria.
