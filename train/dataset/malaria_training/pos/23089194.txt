The thymus plays a crucial role in the generation of T-cells, and so our
laboratory has been interested in the study of the intrathymic events that occur 
during infection diseases and may cause disruption in its functions. Previously, 
we showed that thymus from experimentally Plasmodium berghei-infected mice
present histological alterations with high levels of apoptosis, changes in cell
migration-related molecules, and premature egress of immature thymocytes to
periphery. In addition, parasites were found inside the thymus. In this work we
investigated alterations in the expression pattern and activity of matrix
metalloproteinases MMP-2 and -9, and their tissue inhibitors, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. 
Our results show enhanced expression and widespread distribution of these
molecules in thymus from infected animals. Also, the presence of active MMP-2 was
detected. These data are suggestive of MMPs and TIMPs importance in the earlier
observed changes in the extracellular matrix during thymic alterations after
plasmodium infection.
