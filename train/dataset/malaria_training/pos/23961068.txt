Babesia divergens is an intraerythrocytic parasite which is capable of infecting 
a wide range of vertebrates causing huge economic losses. Histopathological,
hematological and biochemical changes during B. divergens infection in female
Meriones ungliculatus were reported. Animals were challenged with 5 × 10(6) B.
divergens-infected erythrocytes. Parasitemia were maximum at day 5 postinfection 
where all gerbils died. Infection of gerbils with Babesia induced a significant
decrease in erythrocytic count as well as the hemoglobin concentration and
hematocrit percentage but leucocytes were increased significantly when compared
to uninfected gerbils. Liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and aniline
aminotransferase (ALT) were significantly increased while albumin and total
bilirubin were significantly decreased at day 5 postinfection with B.
divergens-infected erythrocytes. Histopathological scores of inflammation after
infection of gerbils were done using Ischak's activity index and indicated that
the liver was severely affected. In conclusion, the study indicated that the
course of infection by B. divergens-induced alternations in hematology,
biochemistry and histopathology of the hepatic tissue.
