In cerebral malaria (CM), pathologic cytokine expression patterns are thought to 
contribute to disruption of the blood-brain barrier, inflammation, and astrocytic
scar formation. Expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, -beta2, and
-beta3 was analyzed in the brains of 7 patients who died with CM and in 8 control
patients. In the brains of patients with CM, there were significantly (P=.0003)
more TGF-beta1-immunoreactive astrocytes adjacent to brain vessels with
deposition of malarial pigment, significantly (P=.0081) more TGF-beta2-expressing
macrophages/microglial cells in glioses of ring hemorrhages and Dürck's
granulomas, and significantly (P=.0022) more TGF-beta3-expressing smooth-muscle
cells and endothelial cells of brain vessels with sequestration. It is concluded 
that focal accumulation of TGF-beta1, -beta2, and -beta3 provides evidence for
their involvement in the reorganization process of the brain parenchyma,
immunologic dysfunction, and endothelial cell activation in patients with CM.
