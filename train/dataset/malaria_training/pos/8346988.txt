Vitamin B12 and its binding proteins were measured in the serum and urine of four
patients with Plasmodium falciparum who had renal insufficiency. The results
showed that these patients had elevated serum transcobalamin II (TCII) levels
which decreased to the normal level after recovery from azotaemia. There were
direct relationships between serum TCII levels and blood urea-nitrogen or
creatinine concentrations. The clearance and urinary excretion of vitamin B12 and
TCII were significantly lower in the patients' group than in normal subjects. All
these findings indicated that elevated serum TCII could occur in P. falciparum
patients with renal insufficiency. This is probably caused by a reduction in
renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), secondary to a low or
ineffective blood volume. The reduced GFR, in turn, reduces the TCII-B12 that
filters through the glomeruli, resulting in decreased TCII-B12 uptake by the
renal tubules, and thus slows down the TCII degradation by lysosomal enzymes. The
decreased TCII catabolism therefore prolongs the TCII survival in the circulation
and probably stimulates TCII synthesis and secretion in a feedback mechanism.
