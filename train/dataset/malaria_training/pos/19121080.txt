Antibodies and B cells are critical in the protective immune response to the
blood stage of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium chabaudi. However, little is
known about the development of memory B cells and their differentiation into
plasma cells during infection or after re-infection. Here we have shown that B
cells with phenotypic characteristics of memory cells (CD19(+)IgD(-) CD38(+),
IgG1(+)) are generated in a primary Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi infection of
mice. In addition, we observed that germinal centre cells (CD19(+), GL7(+),
MHCII(hi)) and Marginal Zone B cells (CD19(+)CD23(-)IgD(-)) show faster expansion
on re-infection than in the primary, though other subsets do not. Interestingly, 
though both IgM(-) and IgM(+) memory cells are produced, IgM(+) memory cells do
not expand on second infection. The second infection quickly produced mature bone
marrow plasma cells (intracellular Ig(hi), CD138(hi), CD9(+), B220(-)), compared 
to primary infection; which generates a very large population of immature splenic
plasma cells (B220+). This analysis suggests that a memory B cell population is
generated after a single infection of malaria, which on re-infection responds
quickly producing germinal centres and generating long-lived plasma cells making 
the second encounter with parasite more efficient.
