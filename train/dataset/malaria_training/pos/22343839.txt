OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship among the angiopoietin-Tie-2 system,
retinopathy, and mortality in children with cerebral malaria.
DESIGN: A case-control study of retinopathy-positive vs. retinopathy-negative
children with clinically defined cerebral malaria.
SETTING: Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi.
SUBJECTS: One hundred fifty-five children presenting with severe malaria and
meeting a strict definition of clinical cerebral malaria (Blantyre Coma Score â‰¤
2, Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia, no other identifiable cause for coma) were 
included in the study.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical and laboratory parameters were recorded
at admission and funduscopic examinations were performed. Admission levels of
angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, and a soluble version of their cognate receptor
were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We show that angiopoietin-1
levels are decreased and angiopoietin-2 and soluble Tie-2 levels are increased in
children with cerebral malaria who had retinopathy compared with those who did
not. Angiopoietin-2 and soluble Tie-2 were independent predictors of retinopathy 
(adjusted odds ratio [95% CI], angiopoietin-2, 4.3 [1.3-14.6], p = .019; soluble 
Tie-2, 9.7 [2.1-45.8], p = .004). Angiopoietin-2 and soluble Tie-2 were
positively correlated with the number of hemorrhages, the severity or retinal
whitening, and the extent of capillary whitening observed on funduscopic
examination (p < .05 after adjustment for multiple comparisons). Angiopoietin-2
and soluble Tie-2 levels were elevated in children with cerebral malaria who
subsequently died and angiopoetin-2 was an independent predictor of death
(adjusted odds ratio: 3.9 [1.2-12.7], p = .024). When combined with clinical
parameters, angiopoetin-2 improved prediction of mortality using logistic
regression models and classification trees.
CONCLUSIONS: These results provide insights into mechanisms of endothelial
activation in cerebral malaria and indicate that the angiopoietin-Tie-2 axis is
associated with retinopathy and mortality in pediatric cerebral malaria.
