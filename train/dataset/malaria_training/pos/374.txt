ligand.

A radioimmunoassay procedure for guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (CGMP) is
described. The procedure is based on competitive binding between [3H]CGMP and
non-radioactive CGMP, with separation of bound and unbound CGMP by Millipore
filtration. The binding reaction showed very high specificity to CGMP, had a
broad pH optimum, and reached equilibrium within a short time. A simple procedure
for the pruification of assay samples using Dowex AG 50W-X2 resin is also
described. CGMP contents in urine samples were assayed without purification.
Injection of glucagon into healthy human volunteers resulted in a small but
significant reduction in urinary CGMP level, whereas CAMP excretion increased
dramatically.
