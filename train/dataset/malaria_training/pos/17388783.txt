Lymphocyte transformation induced by Theileria parasites involves constitutive
activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the AP-1 transcription factor. We
found that JNK/AP-1 activation is associated with elevated levels of Rab11
protein in Theileria-transformed B cells. We show that AP-1 regulates rab11a
promoter activity in B cells and that the induction of c-Jun activity in mouse
fibroblasts also leads to increased transcription of the endogenous rab11a gene, 
consistent with it being an AP-1 target. Pharmacological inhibition of the JNK
pathway reduced Rab11 protein levels and endosome recycling of transferrin
receptor (TfR) and siRNA knockdown of JNK1 and Rab11A levels also reduced TfR
surface expression. We propose a model, where activation of the JNK/AP-1 pathway 
during cell transformation might assure that the regulation of recycling
endosomes is co-ordinated with cell-cycle progression. This might be achieved via
the simultaneous upregulation of the cell cycle machinery (e.g. cyclin D1) and
the recycling endosome regulators (e.g. Rab11A).
