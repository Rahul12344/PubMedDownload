cDNA sequence and chromosomal localization of the mouse parvalbumin gene, Pva.

Zühlke C, Schöffl F, Jockusch H, Simon D, Guénet JL.

In the homozygous condition, the mutation adr (arrested development of righting
response) of the mouse causes a myotonia and a drastic reduction of the
Ca2+-binding protein parvalbumin (PV) in fast muscles. Using a rat PV probe, a
mouse cDNA clone was isolated from a lambda gt11 wild-type fast-muscle library
and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The protein coding and the 3'
nontranslated regions of the mouse gene show extensive homology with the rat PV
gene. The result of Southern blot hybridization is consistent with a single copy 
gene for parvalbumin. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) between
Mus musculus domesticus (e.g. C57BL/6) and Mus spretus (SPE) were detected with
the enzymes Eco RI, Pst I, and Sst I. The restriction fragment patterns of DNA
samples from 65 individual offspring of (C57BL/6 x SPE)F1 x C57BL/6 backcrosses
were tested with the PV probe and matched, for linkage detection, to pre-existing
patterns established with various RFLP probes on the same samples. A
co-distribution of PV-RFLPs with Pvt-1 and Mlvi-2, which had been localized on
chromosome 15, was detected. Thus, the structural gene for PV, designated Pva,
maps to chromosome 15 of the mouse whereas the adr mutation shows no linkage with
markers on this chromosome. Gene locus homology between chromosome 15 of the
mouse and chromosome 22 of man (which carries the human PV gene) is discussed.
