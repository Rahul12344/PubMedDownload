Incidence of apoptosis was investigated in the spleen and lymph nodes of +/+,
CD18 -/- and urokinase receptor (uPAR, CD87) -/- mice, untreated or Plasmodium
Berghei Anka (PbA) infected. In non infected mice, incidence of apoptosis was
lower in the lymph nodes of CD18 -/- and uPAR -/- than in +/+ mice, as seen by
FACS analysis to count the number of hypodiploid and Annexin-V binding cells.
Infection of mice with PbA resulted in a marked increase in the size of spleen
and lymph nodes 7-8 days after infection, which was slightly higher in uPAR -/-
and CD 18 -/- than in +/+ mice. PbA infection increased about 7 fold the
incidence of apoptosis in the lymphoid organs of +/+, especially in the white
pulp and germinal centers of the spleen and lymph nodes, while in contrast it was
unchanged in PbA infected CD 18 -/- or uPAR -/- mice. Serum IgG levels, and
number of circulating leukocytes were significantly higher in both uPAR and CD18 
-/- than in +/+ mice. These results indicate that the CD18 and uPAR surface
molecules, which are known to be associated in the cell membrane, have an
important influence upon the incidence of cell survival in both normal or
stimulated lymphoid organs.
