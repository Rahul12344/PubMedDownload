The marine invertebrate-derived meridianin A, the originally proposed structure
for psammopemmin A, and several related 3-pyrimidylindole analogs were
synthesized and subsequently investigated for central nervous system,
antimalarial, and cytotoxic activity. A Suzuki coupling of an indoleborate ester 
to the pyrimidine electrophile was utilized to form the natural product and
derivatives thereof. The 3-pyrimidineindoles were found to prevent radioligand
binding to several CNS receptors and transporters, most notably, serotonin
receptors (<0.2 μM K(i) for 5HT(2B)). Two compounds also inhibited the human
malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (IC(50) <50 μM). Only the natural product 
was cytotoxic toward A549 cells (IC(50)=15 μM).
