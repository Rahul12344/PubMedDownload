Loss of matrix metalloproteinase 9 activity in Theileria annulata-attenuated
cells is at the transcriptional level and is associated with differentially
expressed AP-1 species.

The schizont stage of the protozoan parasite Theileria annulata reversibly
transforms bovine monocytes into an immortalised and metastatic state. We have
been studying T. annulata induction of host matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) which
are involved in parasite dissemination and pathogenesis. We have observed that
prolonged in vitro culture of T. annulata-infected cell lines results in their
attenuation and this process is associated with alterations in both host and
parasite gene expression. In particular, a loss in bovine MMP expression in later
passage cultures suggests that these parasite-induced MMPs are virulence factors.
As a means to further our understanding of the attenuation process we examine in 
detail the parasite-induced differential expression of one particular bovine
proteinase, MMP9, in non-attenuated (p58) and attenuated (p158) passage levels of
the Ode vaccine line. We show here that MMP9 expression is regulated at the
transcriptional level and we suggest that a particular parasite-induced AP-1
recognition transcription factor present in the Ode non-attenuated line may have 
a role to play in the expression of this host gene.
