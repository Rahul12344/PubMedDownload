What supplies the concepts in causal inferences in story comprehension? This
question was examined in 5 experiments. Elementary school children and college
students listened to stories containing a "premise" sentence describing a
character's intent in initiating a series of actions, followed by an unexpected
"outcome." After each story, the subjects were asked inference questions about
the reason for the outcome (Experiments 1-4) or asked to explain the outcome
(Experiment 5). In the various experiments, the availability of object concepts
for an inference was manipulated by providing 0 or 2 clues preceding the outcome,
additional filler information that diluted the clue information, a mention of an 
object in the premise or no mention, and an object title for each story or no
title. The results suggested that the availability of an object concept in
sentences prior to the outcome was a critical determinant of whether an object
inference occurred, especially for children. Given availability, the thematic
prominence of the object influences whether the object will be used in an
inference.
