The adhesion of infected red blood cells (IRBCs) to microvascular endothelium is 
critical in the pathogenesis of severe malaria. Here we used atomic force and
confocal microscopy to examine the adhesive forces between IRBCs and human dermal
microvascular endothelial cells. Initial contact of the cells generated a mean ± 
sd adhesion force of 167 ± 208 pN from the formation of single or multiple bonds 
with CD36. The strength of adhesion increased by 5- to 6-fold within minutes of
contact through a signaling pathway initiated by CD36 ligation by live IRBCs, or 
polystyrene beads coated with anti-CD36 or PpMC-179, a recombinant peptide
representing the minimal binding domain of the parasite ligand PfEMP1 to CD36.
Engagement of CD36 led to localized phosphorylation of Src family kinases and the
adaptor protein p130CAS, resulting in actin recruitment and CD36 clustering by
50-60% of adherent beads. Uninfected red blood cells or IgG-coated beads had no
effect. Inhibition of the increase in adhesive strength by the Src family kinase 
inhibitor PP1 or gene silencing of p130CAS decreased adhesion by 39 ± 12 and 48 ±
20%, respectively, at 10 dyn/cm(2) in a flow chamber assay. Modulation of
adhesive strength at PfEMP1-CD36-actin cytoskeleton synapses could be a novel
target for antiadhesive therapy.
