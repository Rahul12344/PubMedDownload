BACKGROUND: Severe malarial anaemia is a major cause of mortality from malaria.
Although of enormous relevance, its pathogenesis is largely unknown.
Interestingly, the extent of anaemia greatly exceeds the loss of erythrocytes due
to direct destruction by the pathogen Plasmodium falciparum. Immune response
against the parasite is partially mediated through the Fc receptor for
immunoglobulin (Ig) G IIa (FcgammaRIIa, CD32). The presence of an arginine
instead of a histidine residue at amino acid position 131 (H131R) in the
extracellular domain of FcgammaRIIa reduces the affinity of the receptor for
IgG(2) and IgG(3) isotypes but increases the binding activity for C reactive
protein (CRP).
METHODS: In Ghana, West Africa, 2504 children with severe malaria and 2027
matched healthy controls were studied for the FcgammaRIIa(H131R) polymorphism in 
order to ascertain its influence on major manifestations of the disease. The
study group included patients with partly overlapping symptoms of severe malaria,
among them 1591 cases with severe anaemia, 562 cases with cerebral malaria, and
497 cases with other malaria complications.
RESULTS: Analyses of the genotype distributions indicated that, under a recessive
model, FcgammaRIIa(131RR) was positively associated with severe malaria
collectively (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.38; p=0.007, p(corrected)=0.021) and,
after stratification for phenotypes, with severe anaemia (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13 to
1.57; p=0.001, p(corrected)=0.009), but not with cerebral malaria (OR 1.04, 95%
CI 0.82 to 1.33; p=0.733) or other malaria complications (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to
1.37; p=0.827). No association was found with levels of parasitaemia.
CONCLUSION: The positive association with a CRP binding variant of FcgammaRIIa
supports evidence for a role of CRP mediated defence mechanisms in the
pathogenesis of severe malarial anaemia.
