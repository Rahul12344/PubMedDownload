Cells involved in innate and adapted immunity produce cytokines capable of
orchestrating the immune response to Babesia and Theileria infections. Thus,
CD4-postive T cells recognise peptide fragments of the parasites in the context
of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen and produce gamma 
interferon (IFN-gamma) to activate macrophages for enhanced phagocytosis and
intracellular killing of the parasites. In addition, CD4-positive T cells produce
interleukin 2 (IL-2) which is essential for the clonal expansion of CD8-positive 
T cells. The latter cells kill Theileria-infected host leucocytes in an MHC class
I-dependent manner. On the other hand, the overproduction of proinflammatory
cytokines contributes to disease progress.
