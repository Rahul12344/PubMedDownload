falciparum malaria in India.

Cytoadherence of Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells (RBCs) in host
microvasculature and complex regulation of the immune response are important
contributors to the clinical outcome of disease. We tested the association of 23 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a microsatellite repeat in adhesion
molecule genes THBS1 and ESEL, and immune regulatory molecule genes NOSII, CRP,
and MBL2 with falciparum malaria in populations residing in a malaria-endemic and
a non-endemic region of India. The THBS1 haplotype CCCCA (rs1478604, rs7170682,
rs2664141, rs12912082, rs3743125) was a risk factor in the endemic region
(relative risk = 3.78) and an ESEL SNP (rs5368, His468Tyr) associated with
cerebral malaria (CM) [CM vs. non-cerebral malaria (NCM), odds ratio (OR) = 2.23,
p = 0.03]. In the non-endemic region, an ESEL 3'UTR SNP (rs5359) associated with 
enhanced risk of disease (OR = 3.62, p = 1 × 10(-4)) and the CT genotype of the
CRP promoter SNP (C/T/A) strongly associated with protection (severe vs. control,
OR = 0.29, p = 6 × 10(-5)). Long repeat alleles of the NOSII promoter
microsatellite (CCTTT)n exhibited strong association with protection and the
NOSII ATG haplotype (rs3729508, rs2297520, rs9282801) was strongly protective
against severe malaria in both regions (endemic, severe vs. control, OR = 0.05, p
= 0.0001; non-endemic, severe vs. control, OR = 0.3, p = 1 × 10(-5)). Our results
suggest differential contribution of variants of the investigated genes in
determining the outcome of malaria in Indian populations.
