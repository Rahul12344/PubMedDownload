BACKGROUND: Cerebral malaria (CM) is an acute encephalopathy with increased
pro-inflammatory cytokines, sequestration of parasitized erythrocytes and
localized ischaemia. In children CM induces cognitive impairment in about 10% of 
the survivors. Erythropoietin (Epo) has - besides of its well known
haematopoietic properties - significant anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and
anti-apoptotic effects in various brain disorders. The neurobiological responses 
to exogenously injected Epo during murine CM were examined.
METHODS: Female C57BL/6j mice (4-6 weeks), infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA,
were treated with recombinant human Epo (rhEpo; 50-5000 U/kg/OD, i.p.) at
different time points. The effect on survival was measured. Brain pathology was
investigated by TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated
deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP)-digoxigenin nick end labelling), as a marker of 
apoptosis. Gene expression in brain tissue was measured by real time PCR.
RESULTS: Treatment with rhEpo increased survival in mice with CM in a dose- and
time-dependent manner and reduced apoptotic cell death of neurons as well as the 
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain. This neuroprotective
effect appeared to be independent of the haematopoietic effect.
CONCLUSION: These results and its excellent safety profile in humans makes rhEpo 
a potential candidate for adjunct treatment of CM.
