introduction: wild migratory birds global distributors pathogens.
sardinia, italy, second largest island mediterranean land 
bridge europe africa.
methodology: designed surveillance protocol investigate wild migratory
birds presence, frequency, type avian influenza viruses. collected 
over 4,000 avian samples compared three sampling methods, fecal, cloacal, and
tracheal, determine productive virus identification. determine
frequency infection, rna extracted rt-pcrs avian influenza virus
genes run. positive samples cultivated live virus, sub typed and
sequenced.
results: forty-four samples positive influenza nucleoprotein gene. we
identified two previously unidentified h3 subtype strains found cloacae to
have highest rate virus identification fecal sampling provide
quality rna repeatable results determination virus presence.
conclusion: investigation provides information frequency of
mediterranean avian influenza viruses, validates initiation avian
influenza surveillance protocol.Â  taken together global avian influenza
findings, results give insight infectious disease distributions 
is important viral pandemic monitoring design preventative measures.
