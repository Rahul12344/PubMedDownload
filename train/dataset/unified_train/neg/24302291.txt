the gene, cloned mitochondria tumorous stem mustard
(brassica juncea var. tumida), cytoplasmic male sterility (cms)-related gene
that produce two transcripts, t1170 t1243. latter transcribed with
the uncleaved intron tinii. previous study, transgenic arabidopsis
thaliana plants over-expressing t1243 transcript (oe-t1243) showed severe
male-sterile phenotype, whereas oe-t1170 plants not. however, functional 
mechanism gene b. juncea remained unknown. study, microscopic
analyses paraffin sections anthers confirmed oe-t1243 plants not
produce normal pollen, whereas oe-t1170 plants did. analyzed transcription
of 15 anther development-related genes found transcript levels of
nozzle/sporocyteless barely meristem 1 2 markedly lower in
oe-t1243 plants wild type, transcript levels these
genes oe-t1170 plants unchanged. investigate potential roles of
tinii, inserted tinii sequence upstream minimal region (-60) the
cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter fused 5' end Î²-glucuronidase 
(gus) reporter gene. analysis transgenic plants suggested tinii acted
as enhancer significantly increase gus expression. potential action
mechanism tinii intron acts enhancer affect function 
the cms-related gene t.
