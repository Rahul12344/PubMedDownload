the genomic rna soybean mosaic virus (smv), member potyvirus group of
plant viruses, translated wheat germ reticulocyte cell free
systems identify viral encoded proteins approach determining
the translational strategy virus. rna translated same
specific set 10 12 polypeptides vitro systems. immunological
tests peptide analyses indicate six translation products related 
smv coat protein, one comigrated coat protein during
electrophoresis. two antigenically distinct classes polypeptides were
identified specific immunoprecipitation antibody smv
cytoplasmic inclusion body protein tobacco etch virus nuclear inclusion body
protein. determine products vitro translation reactions
resulted proteolytic processing precursor molecule, translation
reactions carried amino terminal label
n-formyl[35s]methionyl-trna(met)i (f-met), [35s]methionine, the
resultant products compared. putative smv coat protein translation
product related nuclear inclusion body protein labeled f-met
indicating generated proteolytic processing amino
termini. consistent finding accumulation new polypeptides 
greater apparent molecular weight amino acid analogs present during
translation.
