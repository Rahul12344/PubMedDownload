there increase severe fatal influenza cases greece the
2011-2015 post-pandemic period. investigate causality, determined
neuraminidase (na) inhibitor susceptibility resistance-conferring na and
hemagglutinin (ha) mutations circulating influenza type viruses the
pandemic (2009-2010) post-pandemic periods greece. one hundred thirty-four
influenza a(h1n1)pdm09 95 influenza a(h3n2) viruses submitted national
influenza reference laboratory southern greece tested susceptibility 
to oseltamivir zanamivir. antiviral resistance assessed neuraminidase 
sequence analysis, well fluorescence-based 50 % inhibitory
concentration (ic50) method. five influenza a(h1n1)pdm09 viruses (2.2 %) showed
significantly reduced inhibition oseltamivir (average ic50 300.60nm vs.
1.19nm) gaussian kernel density plot analysis. viruses isolated
from immunocompromised patients harbored h275y oseltamivir
resistance-conferring na substitution. a(h1n1)pdm09 viruses were
zanamivir-susceptible, a(h3n2) viruses susceptible drugs.
oseltamivir-resistant viruses form distinct cluster phylogenetic
analysis. permissive mutations detected immunogenic non immunogenic
na regions oseltamivir- resistant susceptible viruses the
post-pandemic seasons. several amino acid substitutions ha1 domain 
ha gene post-pandemic viruses identified. study indicated low
resistance nais among tested influenza viruses. antiviral resistance emerged
only immunocompromised patients long-term oseltamivir treatment.
sequential sample testing vulnerable group patients recommended 
characterise resistance reinfection viral evolution.
