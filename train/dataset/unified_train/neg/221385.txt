inhibition epstein-barr virus transformation: evidence block between
ebna production cell proliferation.

pope jh, moss dj.

non-adherent lymphocyte populations prepared donors previous ebv
infection transformed usual way response ebv. however,
transformation completely inhibited presence adult fetal
human fibroblasts. inhibition associated lymphocytes donors
with prior ebv infection, without, appears 
immunological basis inhibition. inhibition associated production 
ebna reversible. addition adult fibroblasts non-adherent
lymphocytes 2-4 days infection ebv also resulted inhibition
of transformation. results interpreted indicating ebv
transformation involves two recognizable phases, immunological block
between ebna production cell proliferation.
