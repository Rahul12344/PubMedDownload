bluetongue disease ruminants caused bluetongue virus (btv), is
spread culicoides biting midges. bluetongue outbreaks cause huge economic
losses death sheep several parts world. effective
measure control btv vaccination. however, commercially available
vaccines recently developed vaccine candidates several shortcomings.
therefore, generated tested next-generation vaccines bluetongue based 
on backbone laboratory-adapted strain btv-1, avirulent btv-6 or
virulent btv-8. vaccine candidates serotyped vp2 btv-8 did
not express ns3/ns3a non-structural proteins, due induced deletions the
ns3/ns3a orf. sheep vaccinated one vaccine candidates and
were challenged virulent btv-8 3 weeks vaccination. ns3/ns3a
knockout mutation caused complete avirulence three btv backbones,
including virulent btv-8, indicating safety associated the
ns3/ns3a knockout phenotype. viraemia vaccine virus detected using
sensitive pcr diagnostics. apparently, vaccine viruses replicated only
locally, minimize spread insect vector. particular, the
vaccine based btv-6 backbone protected disease prevented
viraemia challenge virus, showing efficacy vaccine candidate. 
lack ns3/ns3a expression potentially enables differentiation infected
from vaccinated animals, important monitoring virus spread in
vaccinated livestock. disabled infectious single-animal vaccine for
bluetongue presented promising subject future
studies.
