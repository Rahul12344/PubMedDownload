hepatitis c virus (hcv) global health concern cause severe liver
disease, cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma. control hcv requires 
vigorous t-cell responses, yet cd4+ cells chronic hcv patients are
dysfunctional. follicular regulatory (tfr) cells subset regulatory t
cells suppress follicular helper (tfh) cells generation high
affinity antibody-producing b cells. study, examined accumulation 
of tfr cells liver compartment chronic hcv infection defined
the cellular molecular mechanisms underlying expansion. analysis
revealed substantial population tfr cells livers chronic hcv patients 
that absent liver tissues nonviral hepatitis healthy subjects.
coculture pbmcs healthy subjects hcv-infected hepatoma cells
resulted preferential expansion circulating tfr cells, leading to
suppression tfh cells. additionally, coculture tonsillar cells with
infected hepatoma cells lead expansion germinal center tfr. notably,
expansion mediated transforming growth factor beta (tgf-β)-containing
exosomes released hcv-infected hepatocytes given blockade of
exosome-associated tgf-β inhibition exosome release abrogated tfr
expansion.conclusion: results show liver-derived exosomes play a
pivotal role accumulation tfr cells, likely leading suppression of
tfh responses hcv-infected patients. study identifies novel pathway in
which hcv infection hepatocytes exacerbates tfr cell responses subvert
antiviral immunity. (hepatology 2018;67:71-85).
