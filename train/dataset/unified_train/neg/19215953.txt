the interactions viral coat protein (cp) host factors play important
role viral replication and/or host defense mechanism. study, we
constructed nicotiana benthamiana cdna library find host factors interacting
with potato virus x (pvx) cp. using yeast two-hybrid assay, screened 3.3 x
10(6) independent yeast transformants n. benthamiana cdna library and
identified six positive clones. one positive clone, named pvx cp-interacting
protein 1 (nbpcip1), plant-specific protein homologue n. tabacum
(genbank accession no. ab04049). confirmed pvx cp-nbpcip1 interaction
using yeast-two hybrid assay yeast, protein-protein binding assay vitro,
and bimolecular fluorescent complementation assay planta. quantitative
real-time rt-pcr analysis showed mrna level nbpcip1 increased in
pvx-infected n. benthamiana plants compared healthy plants. the
green fluorescent protein (sgfp)-fused nbpcip1 (nbpcip1-sgfp) localized er
or er-associated granular-like structure cells. co-express
nbpcip1-sgfp red fluorescent protein (rfp)-fused pvx cp (pvx cp-rfp), which
were introduced transiently expressing proteins n. benthamiana
protoplasts epidermal cells, however, observed co-localization of
these proteins inclusion body-like complex areas surrounding nucleus.
transient over-expression transgene silencing nbpcip1 assay analysis
indicated nbpcip1 plays critical role viral replication pvx
infection host plant.
