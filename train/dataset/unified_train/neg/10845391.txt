we transduced highly tumorigenic t9 clone (t9.f), isolated rat t9
glioblastoma cell line, retroviral expression vector containing human 
il-6 cdna investigated effects il-6 secretion glioma formation in
the syngeneic fischer rat. two subclones producing high low levels (35 and
3.5 ng/10(6) cells/48 h) il-6 identified termed t9.f/il6/hi 
t9.f/il6/lo, respectively. subcutaneous (sc) injection 1 x 10(6) parental t9.f
cells resulted 100% tumor formation progression. 1 x 10(6) il-6
secreting t9.f cells injected sc, small palpable tumor formed which
sometimes regressed. regard, tumors detected 30 days 76%
(13/17) animals injected t9.f/il6/hi cells, whereas 10% (1/10) of
the rats injected t9.f/il6/lo cells completely rejected tumors within 
this time frame. addition il-6 neutralizing antibody t9.f/il6/hi
sc inoculum followed intratumoral injection il-6 neutralizing
antibody, seven days later, abrogated anti-tumor effects. animals that
rejected il-6 secreting tumors 100% protected subsequent
intracranial (ic) challenges parental t9.f glioma well the
original t9 glioblastoma; partially protected ic challenge the
unrelated, syngeneic rt-2 glioma; protected ic challenge
with syngeneic madb106 adenocarcinoma. 1 x 10(4) cells injected 
the brain naive animals, survival time significantly increased those
rats implanted t9.f/il6/hi cells, t9.f/il6/lo cells, compared 
animals implanted t9.f parental cells (p = 0.003). study demonstrates
that il-6 secretion attenuates sc ic glioma growth sc rejection il-6
secreting t9.f cells induces long-term glioma immunity effective 
brain.
