objective: determine antibody levels estimate incidence infection 
pandemic (h1n1) 2009 influenza children pregnant women 2009
winter western australia.
design, setting participants: two cross-sectional serosurveys using stored
specimens collected unrelated pathology testing, (3
august 30 november 2009) circulation pandemic virus, before
commencement pandemic vaccination program. specimens three
groups: children aged 1-4 years, older children teenagers aged 5-19 years,
and pregnant women aged 21-45 years. groups geographically
representative wa population.
main outcome measures: reactivity pandemic (h1n1) 2009 seasonal
a(h1n1) influenza viruses measured using haemagglutination inhibition (hi)
assays.
results: antibody titres determined 648 individuals prepandemic
period 736 postpandemic period. prepandemic period, hi titres â‰¥
40 pandemic virus found 0 (95% ci, 0.0%-1.6%) children aged
1-4 years, 8.3% (95% ci, 5.3%-12.7%) older children teenagers, 4.5%
(95% ci, 2.4%-8.3%) pregnant women. postpandemic specimens collected 1
september 2009 (when influenza activity declined near-baseline levels),
estimated infection rates (subtracting prepandemic levels) 25.4% (95% ci for
difference, 18.6%-33.4%) 1-4-year-old children, 39.4% (95% ci, 29.8%-48.5%) in
older children teenagers, 10.2% (95% ci, 4.1%-17.1%) pregnant women.
conclusions: quarter preschool children 40% school-aged
children older teenagers serological evidence pandemic influenza
infection winter 2009, indicating high levels mild asymptomatic
infection. infection rate pregnant women much lower. high
infection rates children help explain reduced impact pandemic virus
during 2010 winter. augmented vaccination, sufficiently
high levels immunity australian population significantly reduce 
impact virus future influenza seasons.
