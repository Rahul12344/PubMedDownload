detection anti-hepatitis b virus (hbv) drug resistance mutations critical
for therapeutic decisions chronic hepatitis b virus infection. describe 
real-time pcr-based assay using multicolor melting curve analysis (mmca) that
could accurately detect 24 hbv nucleotide mutations 10 amino acid positions in
the reverse transcriptase region hbv polymerase gene. two-reaction
assay limit detection 5 copies per reaction could detect minor 
mutant population (5% total population) reverse transcriptase
m204v amino acid mutation presence major wild-type population 
the overall concentration 104 copies/μl. assay could finished within 3
h, cost materials sample less $10. clinical
validation studies using three groups samples nucleos(t)ide
analog-treated -untreated patients showed results 99.3%
(840/846) samples 99.9% (8,454/8,460) amino acids were
concordant sanger sequencing pcr amplicon hbv
reverse transcriptase region (pcr sanger sequencing). hbv dna six samples with
mixed infections consisting minor mutant subpopulations undetected 
pcr sanger sequencing method detected mmca, results were
confirmed coamplification lower denaturation temperature-pcr sanger
sequencing. among treated patients, 48.6% (103/212) harbored viruses that
displayed lamivudine monoresistance, adefovir monoresistance, entecavir
resistance, lamivudine adefovir resistance. among untreated patients, 
the chinese group mutation-containing samples pakistani
group (3.3% versus 0.56%). accuracy, rapidness, wide-range
coverage, cost-effectiveness, real-time pcr assay could robust tool 
for detection anti-hbv drug resistance mutations resource-limited
countries.
