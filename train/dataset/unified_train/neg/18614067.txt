herpes simplex virus strain mpdk- causes disaggregation host polyribosomes 
both permissive (hep-2) nonpermissive (dk) cells first 3 hours
after infection. following findings discussed paper: (1) uv
light-irradiated virus cause disaggregation host polyribosome. (2) to
obtain equivalent disaggregation host polyribosomes, 1 hour infection
the nonpermissive dk cells must infected mpdk- virus multiplicity
twenty- thirty-fold higher permissive hep-2 cells. (3) actinomycin 
(0-20 microg/ml medium), 6-azauridine (0-10(-4) m), p-fluorophenylalanine
(0-10(-3) m) prevent disaggregation host polyribosomes hep-2
cells infected 60 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell mpdk- virus. however,
the drugs prevent disaggregation host polyribosomes dk cells
infected 1000 pfu/cell mpdk- virus. (4) differences hep-2 and
dk cells respect multiplicity requirements induce disaggregation and
the ability drugs prevent due property product
specified mpdk- cells. conclusion based finding that
in dk cells productively infected mpdk+sp, multistep mutant mpdk-
virus, equivalent disaggregation host polyribosomes achieved 40
pfu/cell cannot prevented actinomycin d. interpretation these
findings based data reported previously products specified by
mpdk- virus nonpermissive dk cells malfunction. conclude (1) in
permissive cells disaggregation host polyribosomes catalyzed a
highly efficient protein synthesized infection; (2) nonpermissive cells 
the protein malfunctions; obtain comparable reduction host functions the
concentration protein must higher nonpermissive cells. this
condition satisfied infecting nonpermissive cells high multiplicity. (3)
the reduction synthesis function protein various drugs is
sufficient prevent breakdown host polyribosomes nonpermissive cells 
but permissive cells.
