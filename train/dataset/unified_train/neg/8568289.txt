antibody responses gor epitope hepatitis c virus (hcv) core were
investigated 136 patients chronic hcv infection. patient age (p = .011)
and necroinflammatory activity (p < .001) significantly greater 92
(67.6%) patients anti-gor 44 (32.4%) patients without anti-gor. hcv 
rna concentration significantly higher patients anti-gor (p = .031). 
hcv 1a 1b genotypes also found according anti-gor status. gor hcv 
core (amino acids 5-19) antibody responses correlated significantly (rs = .615, p
< .001). anti-hcv core(5-19) detected 67 (73%) 92 patients 
14 (32%) 44 without anti-gor (p < .001). patients concurrent anti-gor and
anti-hcv core(5-19) significantly greater necroinflammatory activity (p =
.003). multivariate analysis, anti-hcv core(5-19), patient age, and
necroinflammatory activity correlated anti-gor response (p < .001).
reactivity gor autoepitope correlates hcv core response liver
necroinflammatory activity, thus suggesting immunopathogenic role chronic
hepatitis c.
