background objective: interferon-gamma (ifn-γ)-inducible protein-10 (ip-10), 
soluble (s) cd163 scd14 play important role pathogenesis hcv and
hiv infection involved inflammation liver fibrosis. aim the
present study evaluate single time point, plasma soluble biomarkers
and inflammatory monocytes subsets different groups subjects: (i) hiv
monoinfected patients suppressive art; (ii) hiv/hcv coinfected patients on
art, undetectable hiv viremia (including either subjects active hcv 
replication cleared hcv); (iii) hcv monoinfected individual with
active viral replication.
methods: hundred twenty-nine plasma samples analyzed including hcv and
hiv monoinfected patients, hiv/hcv coinfected patients, active hcv infection
(ahi) hcv viral clearance (vhc) healthy donors (hd). levels ip-10,
scd163 scd14 measured elisa. absolute cell counts monocyte
subpopulations enumerated whole blood using flow cytometric analyses.
results: ip-10 scd163 plasma levels higher hcv monoinfected in
ahi coinfected pts compared hiv monoinfected hd, whereas scd14 levels were
higher hiv monoinfected patients. considering degree fibrosis,
scd163 scd14 levels positively correlated kpa values (as assessed by
fibroscan) fib-4 hcv monoinfected group. hand, ip-10 
correlate fibrosis stage found increased also patients
with low fibrosis. moreover, found increase inflammatory ncm subset,
in non-cirrhotic hcv subjects, alterations observed hiv, ahi and
vhc.
conclusions: study suggests scenario active hcv infection is
associated strong pro-inflammatory state, even initial stage of
liver fibrosis, regardless presence hiv coinfection, thus underlying the
need early anti-hcv treatment.
