objectives: estimate direct health care costs continuing epidemic 
hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection among injecting drug users (idus) australia 
from formal health care system's perspective.
design: markov cohort model used map disease paths successive
hypothetical cohorts 1,000 patients develop sequelae hcv over
an extended period time.
patients setting: idus becoming infected hcv.
outcome measures: estimates number persons limited number 
of disease states used conjunction direct medical costs associated
with ambulatory visits inpatient hospital admissions course the
disease estimate long-term impact health care system hcv
infection among successive cohorts idus.
results: every 1,000 idus newly infected hepatitis c given year,
there implied $14.32 million health care spending years as
sequelae become manifest, cumulative total costs $0.5 billion (1994 
dollars) 60 years costs successive cohorts hcv-infected idus
are added prevalence pool. estimated 10,000 new hcv infections in
idus australia per year continue next 60 years, total direct health
care costs around $4 billion period.
conclusions: efforts prevent hiv transmission among idus shown be
clearly cost-effective. data imply even pressing need
to halt slow current epidemic hcv infection among idus fiscal
grounds alone.
