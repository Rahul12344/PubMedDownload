type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (aec2) regarded progenitor population
of alveolus responsible injury repair homeostatic maintenance.
depletion population hypothesized underlie various lung
pathologies. current models lung injury rely either uncontrolled,
nonspecific destruction alveolar epithelia targeted, nontitratable
levels fixed aec2 ablation. hypothesized discrete levels aec2
ablation would trigger stereotypical informative patterns repair. 
end, created transgenic mouse model surfactant protein-c
promoter drives expression mutant sr39tk herpes simplex virus-1 thymidine
kinase specifically aec2. sensitivity sr39tk, low doses of
ganciclovir administered animals induce dose-dependent aec2
depletion ranging mild (50%) lethal (82%) levels. demonstrate that
specific levels aec2 depletion cause altered expression patterns apoptosis

demonstrate utility cell-specific expression sr39tk transgene for
exerting fine control target cell depletion. data demonstrate, the
first time, specific levels type 2 alveolar epithelial cell depletion
