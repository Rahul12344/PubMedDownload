a sensitive reproducible method developed measurement the
silicon phthalocyanine pc 4 red blood cell concentrates (rbcc). procedure 
involves extraction rbcc acetonitrile, purification extracts
with reversed-phase sep-pak c18 cartridges determination pc 4 the
extracts high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) using reversed-phase 
c18 column. detection limit 1-ml rbcc samples 2 ng. method is
applicable monitoring pc 4 use photosensitizer the
inactivation viruses rbcc prior transfusion. potential 
adapted measuring pc 4 tissues use photodynamic therapy of
cancer.
