mda-7/il-24 noteworthy potential anticancer therapeutic 
diversity antitumor properties, lack toxicity toward normal cells and
tissues, safety efficacy evidenced phase clinical trial. in
a recent study, document ad.mda-7-induced er stress ceramide
production leads early autophagy subsequently switches apoptosis in
human prostate cancer cells. apoptotic phase, mda-7/il-24 protein 
physically interacts beclin 1 interaction might inhibit beclin 1
function culminating apoptosis. conversely, ad.mda-7 infection leads to
calpain-mediated cleavage atg5 protein might also facilitate a
biochemical switch autophagy apoptosis. recent paper reveals novel
aspects interplay autophagy apoptosis underlie the
cytotoxic action mda-7/il-24 prostate cancer cells. new insights into
mda-7/il-24 action provide intriguing leads developing innovative
combinatorial approaches prostate cancer therapy.
