liquid crystals play important role biology combination of
order mobility basic requirement self-organisation structure
formation living systems. cholesteric liquid crystals omnipresent in
living matter vivo vitro conditions address major
types molecules essential life. animal plant kingdoms, the
cholesteric structure recurring design, suggesting convergent evolution to
an optimised left-handed helix. herein, review recent advances the
cholesteric organisation dna, chromatin, chitin, cellulose, collagen, viruses,
silk cholesterol ester deposition atherosclerosis. cholesteric structures 
can found bacteriophages, archaea, eukaryotes, bacterial nucleoids,
chromosomes unicellular algae, sperm nuclei many vertebrates, cuticles of
crustaceans insects, bone, tendon, cornea, fish scales scutes, cuttlebone
and squid pens, plant cell walls, virus suspensions, silk produced spiders and
silkworms, arterial wall lesions. article specifically aims at
describing consequences cholesteric geometry living matter, which
are far fully defined understood, discusses various
perspectives. roles functions biological cholesteric liquid crystals
include maximisation packing efficiency, morphogenesis, mechanical stability, 
optical information, radiation protection evolution pressure.
