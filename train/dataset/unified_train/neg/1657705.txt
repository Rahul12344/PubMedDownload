poxviruses large dna viruses replicate cytoplasm infected
cells recombine high frequencies. calcium phosphate precipitates used
to cotransfect shope fibroma virus-infected cells different dna substrates
and recombinant products assayed genetic biochemical methods. 
shown previously bacteriophage lambda dnas used substrates in
these experiments recombinants assayed escherichia coli following dna
recovery vitro packaging. using assay observed 2-3% of
the phage recovered crosses point mutants retained heteroduplex at
at least one mutant sites. reliability genetic analysis was
confirmed using dna substrates permitted direct detection of
heteroduplex molecules denaturant gel electrophoresis southern blotting.
it noted heteroduplex formation coincided onset both
replication recombination suggesting poxviruses, like certain
bacteriophage, make clear biochemical distinction three
processes. fraction heteroduplex molecules peaked 12-hr
postinfection declined later infection. decline probably due
to dna replication rather mismatch repair because, high levels of
induced dna polymerase persisted beyond time maximal heteroduplex
recovery, unable detect type mismatch repair activity in
cytoplasmic extracts. results suggest that, although heteroduplex molecules
are formed progress poxviral infection, gene conversion through
mismatch repair probably produce recombinants. the
significance observations discussed considering unique
properties poxviral biology.
