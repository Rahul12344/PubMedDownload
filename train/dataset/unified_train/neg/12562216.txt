various methods developed transfer express genes mammalian
cells. method, whether virally, non-virally, physically-based, unique
favorable features, also drawbacks respect meeting desired and
specific needs. baculoviruses used since 1983 express recombinant
genes controlled strong insect-virus promoters natural host (insect) 
cells. today well-established easy handle system producing
large quantities recombinant proteins numerous purposes. 1995 was
first published recombinant baculoviruses able deliver genes into
mammalian cells. genes expressed provided controlled a
promoter active mammalian cells. since then, various vector variants 
have developed numerous potential meaningful applications 
described. surprising use baculovirus vectors mammalian 
cell gene delivery vectors constantly increasing system is
undergoing permanent improvements. based convenience system to
transfer genes mammalian cells, baculoviruses applied cell-based
assays drug screening overcome long periods time required to
generate stable cell lines. baculovirus vectors able deliver large
dna sequences mammalian cells vectors toxic gene products also
be generated. addition, baculoviruses valuable tools launching viral
infection cases appropriate cell culture system. moreover,
recent research shown vectors applied vivo. depending on
the design study, baculovirus vectors allow sustained gene expression 
or able induce immune response directed delivered and/or
displayed gene product. latter offers opportunity generate monoclonal 
antibodies certain proteins failed means. addition,
it points potential usefulness baculovirus vectors new kinds of
vaccines. baculovirus vectors therefore considered enabling technology for
various product opportunities.
