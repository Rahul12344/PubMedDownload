chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection cases resistant conventional
therapies might treated immunotherapy cytotoxic lymphocytes (ctl) 
the main mechanism viral infections cleared. hcv core gene,
with highest homology hcv types, deleted its
autoimmune-stimulating regions (pseudo-gor pseudo-p450), may an
appropriate antigen targeting hcv-infected cells. two recombinant
adeno-associated virus (raav) vectors, carrying either full length (aa 1-190)
or truncated (aa 49-180, deleted pseudo-gor pseudo-p450 sequences)
versions core, generated. aav/core (l-190) aav/core (49-180)
were used transduce/load dendritic cells (dc) high levels (88-95%). these
two genetically altered dc types stimulated anti-core ctl. dc ctl
were analyzed facs killing efficiency (percent target killing). the
raav-altered dc displayed higher levels cd80, cd83, cd86, cd 1a than
control dc. truncated core (aa 49-180) gene stimulated equivalent strong 
killing synthetic core-positive autologous peripheral blood lymphocyte (pbl)
targets stimulated full length core gene. however, smaller
core (49-180) antigen gene stimulated lower levels killing core-negative
"self" pbl targets (gor- p450-positive) (p = 0.002). aav/core:
dc-stimulated ctl displayed higher ifn-gamma expression, higher cd8:cd4 ratios,
and lower cd56:cd8 ratios controls. raav-loading derived cd8+ cells
had cd69+ cells cd4+ populations fewer cd25+ cells than
controls. conclude core (49-180) gene effect antigen, has
the advantage stimulating less self-recognition. thus, core (49-180) may be
useful translational immunotherapy studies hcv.
