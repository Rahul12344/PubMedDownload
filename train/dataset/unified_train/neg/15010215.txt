the replication phase bluetongue virus (btv) infection cycle initiated 
when virus core delivered cytoplasm susceptible host cell.
the 10 segments viral genome remain packaged within core throughout
the replication cycle, helping prevent activation host defence
mechanisms would caused direct contact dsrna host 
cell cytoplasm. however, btv core biochemically active 'nano-scale'
machine, simultaneously repeatedly transcribe mrna the
10 genome segments, packaged liquid crystal array within central
cavity. mrnas, also capped methylated within core, are
extruded cytoplasm pores vertices icosahedral
structure, translated viral proteins. one copy the
viral mrnas also assembled newly synthesised proteins form
nascent virus particles, mature process involves -ve rna strand
synthesis +ve stand template, thereby reforming dsrna genome segments
within progeny virus cores. structure btv core particle been
determined atomic resolution x-ray crystallography, revealing the
organisation interactions major protein components (vp3(t2)-subcore

of transcription reactions prior analysis x-ray crystallography, then
constructing difference maps, possible identify binding sites

btv solves many logistical problems multiple simultaneous

surface festooned dsrna. may represent protective strategy
adopted virus prevent host cell shut-off, sequestering dsrna
that may released damaged particles.
