objective: quantify liver damage using metavir score, chronic hepatitis c
patients normal alanine aminotransferase (alt) determine active disease
requiring treatment.
study design: analytical study.
place duration study: pakistan medical research centre, jpmc, karachi,
from january 2007 - december 2010.
methodology: patients suffering hepatitis c positive pcr, having
persistently normal alt 3 separate occasions 6 months period also
having normal platelets albumin included study. written
consent, patients underwent liver biopsy degree damage was
assessed using metavir scoring system.
results: total 99 patients suffering chronic hcv included the
study. majority patients (55.6%) females. using metavir score,
minimal fibrosis ² 1 seen majority (78.8%) patients. 21.2% 
patients fibrosis score ³ 2, 16 (47.1%) also having
inflammatory score ³ 2 (p < 0.001). age patients (mean 38.1 ± 10.2 years) 
had significant association severity liver damage (p < 0.001) as
compared younger age group (mean 33.1 + 9.8 years).
conclusion: large proportion patients normal alt insignificant
fibrosis indicating non active disease thus questions blanket use of
interferon hcv rna cases. strongly recommended liver biopsy
should done cases normal alt deciding antiviral therapy.
