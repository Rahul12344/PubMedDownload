influenza pandemics imminent represent major world health concern.
since vaccinations expected less efficient coming years due to
newly emerging influenza virus strains, novel antiviral therapies urgently
needed. here, show influenza-infected mice, capable clearing virus
in early stages infection, failed control inflammation death.
sequential administration interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) early stage the
infection protected infected mice death nk cell-dependent manner.
ifn-gamma treatment stimulated nk cell proliferation function increased
their number bone marrow, blood, spleen, infected lungs, keeping viral
clearance intact. parallel, ifn-gamma treatment significantly reduced the
number cells nkt cells lungs inflammatory phase following 
infection. thus, rapidly clearing virus reducing inflammation shaping 
the cellular cytokine profiles early stages infection may favorably
change fate influenza pathogenesis.
