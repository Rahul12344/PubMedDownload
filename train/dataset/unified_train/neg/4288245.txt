susceptibility human diploid fibroblast strains transformation sv40
virus.

todaro gj, green h, swift mr.

a quantitative system developed study transformation human
diploid fibroblasts culture two oncogenic viruses, sv40 e46 strain 
of adeno 7-sv40 "hybrid" virus. seven eleven cell strains derived from
human skin biopsies infected sv40 (10(9) tissue culture infective doses
per milliliter) gave rise transformed colonies approximately same
frequency (0.03 percent). two strains derived patients fanconi's
anemia, autosomal recessive disease associated high incidence of
chromosome abnormalities spontaneous neoplasms, gave values ten
times higher. two strains persons heterozygous gene also
considerably susceptible viral transformation.
