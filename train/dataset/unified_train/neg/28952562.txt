background: head neck squamous cell carcinomas (hnscc) major health
issue many parts world. recently, attention focused human
papilloma virus (hpv) potential causative agent hnscc. study aimed 
to survey hpv occurrence hnsccs part comprehensive molecular
epidemiology approach. methods: retrospective study, patients were
recruited hospitals affiliated iran university medical sciences,
tehran, iran. formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (ffpe) blocks subjected to
dna isolation qiaamp® dna ffpe tissue kit nested pcr, hpv-16 specific
conventional pcr, extra inno-lipa hpv genotyping assays subsequently
performed. pcr products purified high pure pcr product purification
kit sequenced abi 3730 xl sequencer. clc main workbench 5 mega5
bioinformatics software used analyze raw data create the
phylogenetic tree. spss v.20 applied statistical analysis. results: a
total 156 ffpe blocks collected 2011 2017. total mean age (y) 
participants 60.5 ± 12.6; 77.6 % (121/156) men 22.4% (35/156) e
women. overall, 5/156 (3.2%) patients (3 females 2 males) found be
hpv positive using three methods. hpv genotyping revealed hpv types 16, 2,
27, 43 malignancies. tumor location lymph node involvement
indicated significant differences sexes. conclusion: although high
risk hpv genotypes associated hnsccs, findings indicate a
potential low risk hpv types also contribute malignancies.
