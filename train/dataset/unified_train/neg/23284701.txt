introduction: transmission breastfeeding remains important for
mother-to-child transmission (mtct) resource-limited settings. quantify the
relationship cell-free (rna) cell-associated (dna) shedding hiv-1 
virus breastmilk risk postnatal hiv-1 transmission first 6
months postpartum.
materials methods: thirty-six hiv-positive mothers transmitted hiv-1 by
breastfeeding matched 36 non-transmitting hiv-1 infected mothers a
case-control study nested cohort hiv-infected women. rna dna were
quantified breastmilk sample taken 6 weeks 6 months. cox
regression analysis assessed association cell-free and
cell-associated virus levels risk postnatal hiv-1 transmission.
results: higher median levels cell-free cell-associated hiv-1 
virus (per ml) breastmilk 6 weeks 6 months. multivariably, adjusting
for antenatal cd4 count maternal plasma viral load, 6 weeks, 10-fold 
increase cell-free cell-associated levels (per ml) significantly
associated hiv-1 transmission stronger cell-associated than
cell-free levels [2.47 (95% ci 1.33-4.59) vs. ahr 1.52 (95% ci, 1.17-1.96),
respectively]. 6 months, cell-free cell-associated levels (per ml) in
breastmilk remained significantly associated hiv-1 transmission was
stronger cell-free cell-associated levels [ahr 2.53 (95% ci 1.64-3.92)
vs. 1.73 (95% ci 0.94-3.19), respectively].
conclusions: findings suggest cell-associated virus level (per ml) is
more important early postpartum hiv-1 transmission (at 6 weeks) than
cell-free virus. cell-associated virus levels consistently detected 
in breastmilk despite antiretroviral therapy, highlights potential
challenge resource-limited settings achieve unaids goal 2015 of
eliminating vertical transmission. studies would knowledge on
mechanisms hiv-1 transmission help develop effective drugs during
lactation.
