serially-sampled nucleotide sequences used infer demographic history of
evolving viral populations. shape phylogenetic tree often reflects the
interplay evolutionary ecological processes. several approaches exist
to analyze topology traits phylogenetic tree, means tree
balance, branching patterns comparative properties. temporal clustering
(tc) statistic new topological measure, based ancestral character
reconstruction, characterizes temporal structure phylogeny. here, 
phylotempo first implementation tc r language, integrating
several topological measures user-friendly graphical framework. the
comparison tc statistic measures provides multifaceted insights
on dynamic processes shaping evolution pathogenic viruses. the
features applicability phylotempo tested serially-sampled
intra-host human simian immunodeficiency virus population data sets.
