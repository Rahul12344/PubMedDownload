aid/apobec deaminases (aads) convert cytidine uridine single-stranded
nucleic acids. involved numerous mutagenic processes, including those
underpinning vertebrate innate adaptive immunity. using multipronged
sequence analysis strategy, uncover several aads across metazoa,
dictyosteliida, algae, including multiple previously unreported vertebrate
clades, versions urochordates, nematodes, echinoderms, arthropods,
lophotrochozoans, cnidarians, porifera. evolutionary analysis suggests a
fundamental division aads early metazoan evolution secreted deaminases
(snads) classical aads, followed diversification several clades
driven rapid-sequence evolution, gene loss, lineage-specific expansions, and
lateral transfer various algae. vertebrate aads, including aid and
apobecs1-3, diversified vertebrates, whereas apobec4-like clade 
deeper origin metazoa. positional entropy analysis suggests several aad
clades diversifying rapidly, especially positions predicted to
interact nucleic acid target motif, potential viral inhibitors.
further, several aads evolved neomorphic metal-binding inserts, especially
within loops predicted interact target nucleic acid. also observe 
polymorphisms, driven alternative splicing, gene loss, possibly intergenic
recombination paralogs. propose biological conflicts aads with
viruses genomic retroelements drivers rapid aad evolution, suggesting 
a widespread presence mutagenesis-based immune-defense systems. deaminases
like aid represent versions "institutionalized" broader array aads
pitted arms races mutagenesis self-dna, similar recruitment
might independently occurred elsewhere metazoa.
