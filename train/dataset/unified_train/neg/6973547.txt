the paramyxovirus newcastle disease (ndv) impairs contact sensitivity to
oxazolone cba/j mice: vitro treatment infectious virus inhibits
the passive transfer contact sensitivity. experiments performed three
different virus preparations demonstrate infectious virus able
to inhibit hypersensitivity reaction treatment virus heat or
ultraviolet irradiation wipes inhibitory activity. results suggest 
that i-ndv depresses response oxazolone action immunoblasts
which mediate response contactant.
