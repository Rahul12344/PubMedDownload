phenotypic genotypic analyses done 17 varicella-zoster virus (vzv)
isolates recovered 10 persons aids (mean cd4 cell count, 16.4/mm3) 
had chronic vzv lesions. eleven acyclovir-resistant isolates recovered 
10 patients mean 20.1 weeks therapy. six susceptible isolates 
recovered acyclovir treatment (n = 1), early therapy (n = 4; mean
time, 4.2 weeks), discontinuation acyclovir (n = 1).
acyclovir-resistant vzv isolates deficient thymidine kinase (tk) or
induced tk altered substrate specificity; isolates susceptible to
foscarnet. ten 11 acyclovir-resistant mutants contained tk gene mutations,
including single nucleotide substitutions highly conserved binding sites (n = 
2) well nucleotide deletions (n = 4) insertions (n = 4). findings
suggest multiple, nonuniform mutations within tk gene associated
with acyclovir-resistant vzv phenotypes.
