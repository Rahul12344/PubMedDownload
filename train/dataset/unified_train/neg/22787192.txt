mycobacteria features make attractive potential vaccine
vectors. nonpathogenic rapidly growing mycobacterium smegmatis can
express mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens heterologous antigens from
other pathogens, used viable vector development of
live vaccines. order improve antigen-specific immunogenicity m. 
smegmatis, screened random transposon mutant library mutants displaying 
enhanced efficiency protein secretion ("high secretors") isolated 61
mutants showing enhanced endogenic transgenic protein secretion. sequence
analysis identified total 54 genes involved optimal secretion insert
proteins, well multiple independent transposon insertions localized within 
the genomic loci operons. majority transposon insertions occurred
in genes known protein secretion function. transposon mutants 
were shown prime antigen-specific cd8(+) cell responses better the
parental strain. specifically, upon introducing simian immunodeficiency virus
(siv) gag gene transposon mutant strains, observed primed
siv gag-specific cd8(+) cell responses significantly better control
prime immunization heterologous prime/boost regimen. results reveal a
dependence bacterial secretion mycobacterial foreign antigens the
induction antigen-specific cd8(+) cells vivo. data also suggest 
these m. smegmatis transposon mutants could used novel live attenuated
vaccine strains express foreign antigens, human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1), induce strong antigen-specific cell 
responses.
