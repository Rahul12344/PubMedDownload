polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis visna virus polypeptides isolated by
agarose gel chromatography.

lin fh.

the proteins visna separated nine major peaks agarose gel
chromatography 6 guanidine hydrochloride (guhcl). polypeptides eack
peak isolated acid precipitation analyzed sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). patterns sds-page
show excluded material guhcl column contains aggregate 10
non-glycosylated polypeptides. shown aggregate represents virus
substructures completely solubilized guhcl. two glycoproteins,
gp175 gp115, isolated column eluate. major glycoprotein
gp115 coeluted p90, p68, p61 guhcl 4. four major
peaks (guhcl 5 8) contains one nonglycosylated polypeptide. however,
a small polypeptide, p12, isolated homogeneous form last peak,
guhcl 9. analysis virus proteins (100 microgram) sds-page shows 20
radioactive bands recognized. fractionation protein on
agarose gel columns followed analysis sds-page, number minor
polypeptides detected became clearly recognizable. thus, the
combined use column chromatography sds-page shows visna virus is
composed 25 proteins.
