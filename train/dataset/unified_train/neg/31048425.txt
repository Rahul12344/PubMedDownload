health priority national global levels. late diagnosis these
infections remains critical public health concern uk. recommendations
have issued expand blood-borne virus (bbv) testing alternative
settings. emergency departments (eds) offer potentially important point of
testing. paper presents findings qualitative study aimed to
explore acceptability feasibility routine opt-out combined bbv
testing intervention implemented inner london ed.
methods: conducted 22 semistructured interviews patients service
providers ed 4-month period intervention pilot. a
grounded analytical approach employed conduct thematic analysis of
qualitative study data.
results: core interrelating thematic areas, identified analytically developed
