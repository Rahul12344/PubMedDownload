coronavirus spike proteins different genera divergent, although all
mediate coronavirus entry cells binding host receptors fusing
viral cell membranes. here, determined cryo-electron microscopy
structure porcine deltacoronavirus (pdcov) spike protein 3.3-å resolution. 
the trimeric protein contains three receptor-binding s1 subunits tightly
pack crown-like structure three membrane fusion s2 subunits form 
a stalk. s1 subunit contains two domains, n-terminal domain (s1-ntd) 
c-terminal domain (s1-ctd). pdcov s1-ntd structural fold alpha-
and betacoronavirus s1-ntds well host galectins, recognizes sugar as
its potential receptor. pdcov s1-ctd structural fold as
alphacoronavirus s1-ctds, structure differs betacoronavirus 
s1-ctds. pdcov s1-ctd binds unidentified receptor host cell surfaces.
pdcov s2 locked prefusion conformation structural restraint s1
from different monomeric subunit. pdcov spike possesses several structural
features may facilitate immune evasion virus, compact
structure, concealed receptor-binding sites, shielded critical epitopes.
overall, study reveals deltacoronavirus spikes structurally and
evolutionally closely related alphacoronavirus spikes to
betacoronavirus spikes; also implications receptor recognition,
membrane fusion, immune evasion deltacoronaviruses well as
coronaviruses general. importance study, determined the
cryo-electron microscopy structure porcine deltacoronavirus (pdcov) spike
protein 3.3-å resolution. first atomic structure spike
protein deltacoronavirus genus, divergent amino acid
sequences well-studied alpha- betacoronavirus spike proteins. here, 
we described overall structure pdcov spike detailed structure 
of structural elements. moreover, analyzed functions each
of structural elements. based structures functions these
structural elements, discussed evolution pdcov spike protein in
relation spike proteins coronavirus genera. study combines
the structure, function, evolution pdcov spike protein provides many
insights receptor recognition, membrane fusion, immune evasion.
