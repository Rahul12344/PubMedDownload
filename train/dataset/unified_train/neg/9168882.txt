n-butyrate (butyrate) shown amplify transgene expression cells
infected e1-defective adenoviruses. present studies undertaken in
order better define actions butyrate context adenovirus gene 
expression, attempt elucidate mechanism butyrate mediates 
the transgene amplification. found butyrate amplified viral transgene
expression concentration range 0.5-5 mm, amplification
required exposure 12-24 hr maximal effect. western blot analysis of
representative viral proteins showed butyrate treatment amplified
dna-binding protein, fiber protein. transient adenoviral replication
system suggested butyrate modest inhibitory effect replication of
the e1-defective adenovirus. use specific inhibitor histone deacetylase, 
trichostatin (tsa), reproduced amplification viral transgene product
achieved butyrate. contrast, adenoviral transgene expression could
not amplified tsa treatment cell line known tsa-resistant
histone deacetylase. butyrate amplified steady-state gene expression viral
transgene, detectable effects either dna-binding protein fiber
steady-state gene expression. nuclear run-off experiments showed both
butyrate tsa caused increase viral transgene transcription. 
concluded inhibitors histone deacetylase amplify adenoviral transgene
expression transcriptional level.
