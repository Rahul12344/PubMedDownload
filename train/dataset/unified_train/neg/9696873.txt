coxsackievirus b3 (cvb3), enterovirus family picornaviridae, induces
cytopathic changes cell culture systems directly injures multiple
susceptible organs tissues vivo, including myocardium, early after
infection. biochemical analysis cell death pathway cvb3-infected hela
cells demonstrated 32-kda proform caspase 3 cleaved subsequent 
the degenerative morphological changes seen infected hela cells. caspase
activation assays confirm cleaved caspase 3 proteolytically active.
the caspase 3 substrates poly(adp-ribose) polymerase, dna repair enzyme, and
dna fragmentation factor, cytoplasmic inhibitor endonuclease responsible 
for dna fragmentation, degraded 9 h following infection, yielding their
characteristic cleavage fragments. inhibition caspase activation by
benzyloxycarbonyl-val-ala-asp-fluoromethylketone (zvad.fmk) inhibit the
virus-induced cytopathic effect, inhibition caspase activation by
zvad.fmk control apoptotic cells induced treatment porphyrin
photosensitizer benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid ring visible light
inhibited apoptotic phenotype. caspase activation cleavage substrates 
may responsible characteristic cytopathic effect produced by
picornavirus infection yet may related late-stage alterations cellular
homeostatic processes structural integrity.
