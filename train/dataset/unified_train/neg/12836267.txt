in chlorovirus infection, immediate-early gene expression occurs within 5-20 min 
post infection (p.i.). identified 16 major immediate-early transcripts. on
northern blot analysis, transcripts showed unusual behaviors: (i) 40 
min p.i., sizes reduced approximately 100 nt, likely caused loss
of poly(a) tail (ii) 40 min p.i., often appeared larger
additional transcripts may formed read-through upstream gene
or downstream gene. results indicate transcription the
viral genes changes drastically 40 min p.i.
