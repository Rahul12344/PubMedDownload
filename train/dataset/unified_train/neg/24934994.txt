insect bacterial symbionts contribute many essential biological functions of
their hosts also influence host fecundity fitness. physiological 
contribution symbionts provide aid immune response xenobiotic
detoxification. immune factors directly impact strategies aimed
at managing insect populations. one biological control strategy shows
promise insects use single-stranded rna viruses within group
dicistroviridae. solenopsis invicta virus (sinv; dicistroviridae), ssrna
virus, proposed potential biological control agent urban
pest s. invicta buren red imported fire ant (rifa). sinv shown 
prevalent rifa populations texas florida; however, mortality is
associated high viral load. insect microbe systems, presence of
particular bacteria induced resistance dicistrovirus. type of
relationship present rifa-sinv system, bacterial community could 
reduce effectiveness sinv biological control system. advantage of
454 pyro-sequencing enables classification unculturable bacteria.
this study examines bacterial community brood, workers, reproductive
cast members colonies without sinv infection. manipulation the
bacterial community may alter virus infection replication within mid-gut.
understanding differences microbial community ant colonies may
provide insights refine current efforts designing control strategies
for important urban pest.
