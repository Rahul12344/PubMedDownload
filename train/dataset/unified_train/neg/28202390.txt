bone marrow stem progenitor cells differentiate a range of
non-hematopoietic cell types, including retinal pigment epithelium (rpe)-like
cells. study, programmed bone marrow-derived cells (bmdcs) ex vivo 
inserting stable rpe65 transgene using lentiviral vector. tested the
efficacy systemically administered rpe65-programmed bmdcs prevent visual
loss superoxide dismutase 2 knockdown (sod2 kd) mouse model age-related
macular degeneration. here, present evidence rpe65-programmed bmdcs
are recruited subretinal space, repopulate rpe layer,
preserve photoreceptor layer, retain thickness neural retina,
reduce lipofuscin granule formation, suppress microgliosis. importantly,
electroretinography optokinetic response tests confirmed visual function
was significantly improved. mice treated non-modified bmdcs bmdcs
pre-programmed lacz exhibit significant improvement visual
deficit. rpe65-bmdc administration effective early disease, when
visual function retinal morphology returned near normal, less
effective late-stage disease. experimental paradigm offers minimally
invasive cellular therapy given systemically overcoming need 
invasive ocular surgery offering potential arrest progression early
amd rpe-based diseases.
