purpose: experimental initial clinical studies shown the
therapeutic potential mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) liver disease.
noninvasive tracking mscs could facilitate clinical translation. the
purpose study optimize mscs delivery dose route mice with
acute liver injury using bioluminescence imaging (bli) track cells.
procedures: mscs labeled luc2-mkate2 dual-fusion reporter gene
(mscs-r). fate mscs-r tracked vivo bli administration
of different doses delivery different routes.
results: delivered via superior mesenteric vein (smv), high-dose
(1.0 × 10(6) 5.0 × 10(5)) group mice demonstrated high liver bli signal but
also lethal portal vein embolization (pve). contrast, pve its
related death occurred low-dose (2.5 × 10(5)) group mice. thus,
2.5 × 10(5) optimal delivery dose. three delivery routes, i.e., inferior
vena cava (ivc), smv, intrahepatic (ih) injection, also systematically
compared. ivc infusion, mscs-r quickly trapped inside lungs, and
no detectable homing liver organs observed. ih injection,
lung entrapment bypassed, mscs-r distribution localized the
injection region liver. contrast, smv infusion, mscs-r were
dispersedly distributed stayed long 7-day posttransplantation the
liver. vivo imaging results validated ex vivo imaging,
digital subtraction angiography (dsa), tissue analysis. therefore, smv the
optimal mscs delivery route liver disease.
conclusions: collectively, bli, could dynamically quantitatively track 
cellular location survival, useful determining mscs transplantation
parameters.
