superantigens (sag) encoded endogenous mouse mammary tumor viruses (mtv)
interact v beta domain cell receptor (tcr-v beta). presentation
of mtv sag lead stimulation and/or deletion reactive cells, but
little known quantitative aspects sag presentation. although
monoclonal antibodies raised mtv sag, useful
in quantitating sag protein, present low amounts normal
cells. alternative attempts quantitate mtv sag mrna expression complicated
by fact mtv transcription occurs multiple loci different
overlapping reading frames. report describe novel competitive
polymerase chain reaction assay allows locus-specific quantitation of
sag expression mrna level lymphocyte subsets mouse strains with
multiple endogenous mtv loci. b cells well cells (cd4+ cd8+), mtv-6
sag expressed highest levels, followed mtv-7 sag (to much
lesser extent) mtv-8,9. consistent functional mtv-7 sag presentation
studies, find mtv-7 sag expression higher b cells cd8+ t
cells low cd4+ subset. overall hierarchy mtv sag
expression (i.e. mtv-6 > mtv-7 > mtv 8,9) also observed mrna isolated
from neonatal thymus. furthermore, kinetics intrathymic deletion the
corresponding tcr-v beta domains ontogeny correlated levels of
mtv sag expression. collectively data suggest cell responses mtv
sag largely controlled sag expression levels presenting cells.
