regulation differentiated cell-specific functions.

savageau ma.

the demand theory gene regulation predicts regulated cell-specific
functions high demand (i.e., high level gene expression frequently
required) influence positive regulatory element whereas 
in low demand (i.e., high level gene expression frequently required) are
under influence negative regulatory element. furthermore, during
differentiation, demand regimen cell-specific functions changes, a
switch regulatory mechanism predicted. case a
function regulated demand regimens, mode regulation switch
from positive (high demand) negative (low demand) vice versa. these
predictions compared published experimental evidence found 
good agreement.
