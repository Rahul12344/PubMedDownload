whiteflies cause considerable losses crops, directly feeding, and
indirectly transmission viruses. current control methods consist a
combination different control tactics, mainly still relying unsafe and
non-ecofriendly chemical control. rna interference (rnai) a
post-transcriptional gene-silencing strategy double-stranded rna
(dsrna), corresponding specifically target gene, introduced target
organism. research rnai previous decade shown success a
potential insect control strategy, highly species-specific and
environment friendly. whiteflies, success dsrna delivery the
oral route opened possibilities management plant-mediated rnai.
to date, several genes targeted whiteflies rnai these
assays demonstrated potential manage whiteflies lab level. however,
further research investments needed move toward application at
field level. review, first time, collected literature on
genes targeted silencing via rnai whiteflies discuss potential 
rnai whitefly pest control. also discuss likely delivery methods, including
transgenic planta delivery symbiont-mediated delivery, potential
for studying interfering insecticide resistance mechanisms virus
