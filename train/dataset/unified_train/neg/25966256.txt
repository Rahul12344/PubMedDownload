micrornas (mirnas) known play important role regulating both
adaptive innate immunity. pacific white shrimp (litopenaeus vannamei) 
most widely farmed crustacean species world. however, little known
about role mirnas play shrimp immunity. understand impact viral 
infection mirna expression shrimp, used high-throughput sequencing
technology sequence two small rna libraries prepared l. vannamei under
normal white spot syndrome virus (wssv) challenged conditions. approximately 
19,312,189 39,763,551 raw reads corresponding 17,414,787 28,633,379
high-quality mappable reads obtained two libraries, respectively.
twelve conserved mirnas one novel mirna highly expressed (>100 rpm)
in l. vannamei identified. identified mirnas, 8 differentially
expressed response virus infection, 1 upregulated 7
were downregulated. prediction mirna targets showed target genes 
of differentially expressed mirnas related immunity, apoptosis, and
development functions. study provides first characterization l.
vannamei mirnas response wssv infection, help reveal the
roles mirnas antiviral mechanisms shrimp.
