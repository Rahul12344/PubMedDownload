thirty-eight new nonsense mutants lipid-containing bacteriophage pr4 
isolated. mutants define seven new viral genes, including gene encoding
the terminal genome protein accessory lytic factor. defective gene
products produced uv-irradiated cells infected representative mutants
from new genetic groups identified using sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). extracts uv-irradiated 
cells infected nonsense mutants produce defective major capsid
protein, p2, also lacked two lower molecular weight proteins. synthesis of
all three protein species recovered cells infected one-step
revertants two independent major capsid protein mutants, suggesting the
possibility post-translational processing overlapping genes. time
course protein synthesis wild-type pr4-infected cells examined using
sds-page. analyses revealed least 34 proteins produced following phage
pr4 infection present uninfected control cultures.
