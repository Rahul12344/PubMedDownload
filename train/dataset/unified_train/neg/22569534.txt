vp22, encoded u(l)49 gene, one abundant proteins the
herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) tegument shown important
for virus replication spread. however, exact role(s) played vp22 in
the hsv-1 replication cycle yet delineated. lack procedure to
purify full-length vp22 limited molecular studies vp22 function. a
procedure developed purification soluble, full-length vp22 from
cells infected hsv-1. recombinant virus encoding his-tagged vp22 was
generated found express vp22 levels comparable wild type virus
upon infection vero cells. experimenting wide variety cell lysis 
buffer conditions, several buffers promote solubility full-length
vp22 identified. buffers gave highest levels solubility were
then used immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography experiments to
identify conditions provided greatest level vp22 binding recovery
from cobalt nickel affinity resins. using strategy soluble, full-length 
vp22 purified cells infected hsv-1.
