objective: improve understanding novel influenza (h1n1) virus
infection complicated pneumonia.
method: clinical presentations, radiological data, laboratory data treatments
of 2 patients pneumonia caused novel influenza (h1n1) virus were
retrospectively analyzed.
results: one patient middle-aged woman, young man 
a history asthma. patients fever (temperatures 39 degrees
c), cough, dyspnea. time admission, patients hypoxemia.
chest computed tomography (ct) scan showed patchy distribution consolidation
and ground-glass opacity mainly peripheral subpleural regions, well as
peribrochovascular lesions air-bronchogram. decreased lymphocytes,
elevated lactate dehydrogenase creatine kinase found patients.
after admission, patients received oseltamivir dose 75 mg twice a
day minimum 5 days. treatments included antibiotics and
methylprednisolone. one patient needed intermittent non-invasive ventilation 
respiratory distress. patients recovered opacities chest ct
were almost absorbed. wbc counts increased normal levels ldh ck
decreased.
conclusions: patients novel influenza (h1n1) virus infection may
develop pneumonia. manifestations non-specific. chest ct scan reveals
patchy distribution consolidation ground-glass opacity. addition to
antiviral therapy, glucocorticoids may effects pulmonary lesions
and useful improving clinical conditions.
