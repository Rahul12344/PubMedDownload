proteins synthesized er generally transported golgi complex and
beyond reached fully folded assembled conformation. 
analyze selective retention misfolded proteins works, monitored the
long-term fate membrane glycoprotein temperature-dependent folding
defect, g protein tso45 vesicular stomatitis virus. used indirect
immunofluorescence, immunoelectron microscopy, novel nycodenz gradient
centrifugation procedure separating er, intermediate compartment, and
the golgi complex. also employed folding recycling inhibitors
dithiothreitol aif4-, coimmunoprecipitation calnexin antibodies. the
results showed misfolded g protein retained er alone; it
can move intermediate compartment cis-golgi network then
recycled back er. er associated calnexin bip/grp78. 
of two chaperones, bip/grp78 seems accompany the
recycling circuit. thus, retention misfolded glycoprotein the
result multiple mechanisms including calnexin binding er selective 
retrieval intermediate compartment cis-golgi network.
