there need live diva (differentiating infected vaccinated animals) 
vaccines classical swine fever (csf). aim study to
investigate whether vaccination chimeric pestivirus vaccine cp7_e2alf is
efficacious protect young piglets born vaccinated sows, thus with
maternally derived antibodies (mdas). groups 10 piglets each, without 
mdas, vaccinated either intramuscularly (im), age 3 6 weeks, 
orally (or), age 6 weeks. five piglets group challenged
with csfv strain koslov protection clinical disease, virus shedding
and transmission studied. vaccination cp7_e2alf, presence
of mda's piglets without mda's, protected severe clinical signs,
but virus shedding inoculated piglets transmission contact pigs 
was observed. however, virus transmission vaccinated piglets was
significantly reduced compared non-vaccinated piglets, although the
reproduction ratio's r calculated results vaccinated pigs from
our study yet significantly 1. efficacy vaccination with
cp7_e2alf presence mdas (r imvac=0.8, r orvac=0.4) seemed be
slightly less compared vaccination absence mdas (r imvac=0.2, r
orvac=0). population level, results suggest cp7_e2alf vaccine
is effective tool control eradication csf and, moreover, 
applied im oral use young age groups, mdas limited
effect efficacy.
