[article chinese]

zhou x, wu y, lei l.

objective: summarize advances preclinical research xenogeneic
(porcine) cell transplantation recent years.
methods: literature preclinical research xenogeneic (porcine)
cell transplantation analyzed summarized.
results: application new immunosuppressive agents generation 
of transgenic pigs, great progress achieved xenogeneic
transplantation pig-derived nerve cells, islet cells, liver cells, various
types stem cells. survival time xenogeneic cell (porcine) significantly
prolonged, still long way go clinical application.
conclusion: source ofxenogeneic (porcine) cells abundant the
experiments reproducible. however, effectively prevent rejection and
prolong survival time host, avoid spread virus between
species still need solved future research.
