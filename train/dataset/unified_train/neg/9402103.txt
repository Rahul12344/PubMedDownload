ameboid microglia express human immunodeficiency virus 1 (hiv-1) frequently 
than ramified microglia. two microglial subtypes might also differ in
the frequency express transforming growth factor-beta1
(tgf-beta1), cytokine regulates hiv-1 expression monocytes. results
described show ameboid ramified microglia express tgf-beta1. in
brain tissues hiv-1-infected individuals compared seronegative
controls, ameboid rather ramified microglia frequently expressed
tgf-beta1. ameboid microglia, isolated cultured postmortem adult human
brain frequently expressed tgf-beta1 presence interleukin-1(il-1), a
cytokine elevated brains hiv-1-infected individuals compared
with seronegative controls. stimulation tgf-beta1 il-1 dose and
time dependent, occurring ameboid microglia isolated either frontal
cortex globus pallidus midbrain pons. ameboid microglia similar to
the rca-1-positive cells form clusters, called microglial nodules, the
brain hiv-1-infected individuals. pathologic conditions, disseminated 
microglial nodules, associated hiv-1 encephalitis, direct infection of
the brain, moderate severe neurologic impairment. tgf-beta1 expression 
ameboid microglia may play role hiv-1 neuropathogenesis.
