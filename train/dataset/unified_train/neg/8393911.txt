all herpes simplex virus (hsv) infected cell-specific polypeptides (icsps) were
synthesized presence lithium concentration (60 mm) inhibitory to
the production infectious virus. yields certain icsps increased and
others, particular glycoprotein c, decreased. hsv dna synthesis completely
inhibited; synthesis vitro activities hsv dna polymerase thymidine 
kinase decreased degree insufficient account complete
inhibition hsv dna synthesis. hsv dna synthesis inhibited equivalent
degree either incubation 60 mm-lithium potassium starvation; both
procedures decreased intracellular potassium equivalent amount adjudged 
by x-ray microanalysis. conclude lithium inhibits hsv dna synthesis by
displacement potassium potassium-dependent biochemical reaction by
other physiological changes brought loss cellular potassium. 
possibility lithium also directly inhibits virus replicative event cannot 
be excluded.
