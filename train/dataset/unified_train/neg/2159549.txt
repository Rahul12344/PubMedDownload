simian virus 40 (sv40)-containing dna rescued fusion of
sv40-transformed vlm cells permissive cos1 monkey cells cloned, and
prototype plasmid clones characterized. 2-kilobase mouse dna fragment
fused rescued sv40 dna, derived mouse dna flanking single
insert sv40 dna vlm cells, sequenced. insertion intact rescued
mouse sequence, two nonoverlapping fragments it, wild-type sv40
plasmid dna suppressed replication plasmid tc7 monkey cells, although
the plasmids expressed replication-competent antigen. rat cells were
transformed linearized wild-type sv40 plasmid dna without fragments 
of mouse dna cis. although rat cell lines expressed
approximately equal amounts antigen p53, transformants carrying sv40 dna
linked either two replication suppressor fragments produced
significantly less free sv40 dna fusion permissive cells those
transformed sv40 dna without cellular insert cellular insert
lacking suppressor activity. results suggest two independent segments of
cellular dna act cis suppress sv40 replication vivo, either plasmid
or integrated chromosomal dna.
