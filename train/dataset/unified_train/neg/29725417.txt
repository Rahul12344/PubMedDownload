hepatitis c virus (hcv)-induced human hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) progression 
may due complex multi-step processes. developmental mechanism of
these processes worth investigating prevention, diagnosis therapy 
of hcc. aim present study investigate molecular mechanism
underlying progression hcv-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. first, the
dynamic gene module, consisting key genes associated progression 
the normal stage hcc, identified using weighted gene co-expression
network analysis tool r language. defining genes module as
seeds, change co-expression differentially expressed gene sets two
consecutive stages pathological progression examined. finally, interaction
pairs hcv viral proteins directly targeted proteins the
identified module extracted literature comprehensive
interaction dataset yeast two-hybrid experiments. combining the
interactions hcv targets, protein-protein interactions in
the search tool retrieval interacting genes database (string), the
hcv-key genes interaction network constructed visualized using cytoscape 
software 3.2. result, module containing 44 key genes identified 
associated hcc progression, due dynamic features functions of
those genes module. several important differentially co-expressed gene
pairs identified non-hcc hcc stages. key genes, cyclin
dependent kinase 1 (cdk1), ndc80, cyclin a2 (ccna2) rac gtpase activating
protein 1 (racgap1) shown targeted hcv nonstructural proteins
ns5a, ns3 ns5b, respectively. four genes perform intermediary role
between hcv viral proteins dysfunctional module hcv key genes 
interaction network. findings provided valuable information for
understanding mechanism hcv-induced hcc progression seeking drug
targets therapy prevention hcc.
