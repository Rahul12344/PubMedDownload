tt virus (ttv) widespread throughout world detected 50-95%
of healthy individuals. however, chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infected
patients coinfected ttv, histological activity indices higher than
patients hcv infection alone. studies indicate ttv 
cause aplastic anemia thrombocytopenia. ttv known transmitted 
through blood transfusions fecal-oral route, published information on
transplasental transmission controversial. aims study to
detect frequency ttv infection among healthy pregnant women search 
whether ttv transmitted transplasentally pregnancy. purpose,
plasma samples collected 54 women newborns investigated by
polymerase chain reaction (pcr), viral loads determined infected
newborns, respective mothers. also, ten mothers whose newborns were
tested negative ttv-dna enrolled viral load tests comparison.
ttv-dna detected 49 (90.7%) 54 women. 49 newborns whose mothers were
infected ttv, 4 (8.2%) found positive ttv-dna. no
statistically significant difference ttv-dna loads mothers who
transmitted virus (mann-whitney u analysis z=-0.071,
p=0.944). result, transplasental transmission ttv possible occurs 
in low frequency independent viral load.
