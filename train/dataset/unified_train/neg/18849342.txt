the earliest steps nascent protein maturation greatly affect overall
efficiency. constraints placed maturing proteins early stages limit
available conformations help direct native maturation process. for
type ii membrane proteins, cotranslational constraints include n- and
c-terminal membrane tethering, chaperone binding, disulfide bond formation.
the cotranslational maturation process type ii membrane glycoprotein
influenza neuraminidase (na) investigated provide deeper understanding
of initial endoplasmic reticulum events. type ii orientation provides
experimental advantages monitor first maturation steps. calnexin shown
to cotranslationally interact na prior calreticulin. interactions
were required efficient maturation na prematurely formed
intramolecular disulfides aggregated calnexin calreticulin
interactions abolished. lectin chaperone binding slowed na maturation
process, increasing fidelity. carbohydrates required na maturation
in regio-specific manner. subset na formed intermolecular disulfides and
oligomerized cotranslationally. fraction increased absence of
calnexin calreticulin binding. na dimerization also occurred na mutant
lacking critical large loop disulfide bond, indicating dimerization 
not require proper na oxidation. strict evaluation proper maturation
carried quality control machinery instilled tetramerization
step. study illustrates type ii membrane protein maturation process 
shows important cotranslational events contribute proper cellular
maturation glycoproteins.
