tt virus small, circular dna virus, associated with
transfusion hepatitis. sought determine prevalence tt virus (ttv) in
patients human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection characterize
the virus terms genotypic variability relationship cd4+, hiv 
viral loads, hcv/hiv coinfection, alt abnormalities. cross-sectional
analysis hiv-infected patients united states, including 86 hiv-positive
subjects 118 hiv-negative controls performed. ttv detected using a
seminested pcr technique. samples underwent cloning sequence analysis and/or 
rflp determine genotype. thirty-eight percent hiv-positive patients ttv
infection versus 14.4% patients within matching cohort (p = 0.0009). the
highest rate ttv infection patients concurrent hcv/hiv infection
(54% vs 30%, p = 0.038). hiv-infected subjects ttv lower alt levels than
those without ttv (p = 0.036). intravenous drug use leading factor
associated ttv positivity among hiv-positive subjects. mixed genotypes 
more common hiv. therefore, ttv prevalence, alt levels, genomic
heterogeneity ttv seem altered patients hiv.
