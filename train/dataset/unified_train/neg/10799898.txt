virus infection host cells activates set cellular genes, including
cytokines, ifns, chemokines, involved antiviral defense immune
activation. previous studies demonstrated virus-induced transcriptional
activation member human cc-chemokine rantes required activation of
the latent transcription factors ifn-regulatory factor (irf)-3 nf-kappa b via
posttranslational phosphorylation. present study, characterized
the regulatory control rantes transcription virus infection using in
vivo genomic footprinting analyses. irf-3, related irf-7, nf-kappa b 
identified important vivo binding factors required cooperative
induction rantes transcription virus infection. using fibroblastic or
myeloid cells, demonstrate kinetics strength rantes
virus-induced transcription highly dependent preexistence irfs 
nf-kappa b. use dominant negative mutants either kappa b-alpha irf-3
demonstrate disruption either pathway dramatically abolishes ability 
of bind activate rantes expression. furthermore, coexpression of
irf-3, irf-7, p65/p50 leads synergistic activation rantes promoter
transcription. studies reveal model virus-mediated rantes promoter
activation involves cooperative synergism irf-3/irf-7 nf-kappa b
factors.
