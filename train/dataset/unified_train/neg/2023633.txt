permissiveness replication human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) differs 
lymphocytes macrophages. cells, hiv transcription poorly detected 
vivo. cloned, normal lymphocytes show little, any, basal activity of
the hiv enhancer low nuclear expression nf-kappa b, potent
transcriptional activator hiv enhancer. contrast, fixed tissue
macrophages express detectable hiv proteins, indicating permanent virus
transcription. one explanation perpetuation virus infection in
macrophages could sustained nuclear nf-kappa b expression. however, u937
monocytic cell line, fully permissive hiv replication, known to
express low levels nuclear nf-kappa b. show chronic hiv
infection results induction nuclear factor antigenic properties
indistinguishable nf-kappa b permanently increased hiv enhancer
activity. phenomenon, independent tumour necrosis factor, is
associated hiv replication, thus likely explain least part
the perpetuation hiv infection monocytes.
