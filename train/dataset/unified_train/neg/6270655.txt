the integrated dna provirus gardner-arnstein (ga) strain feline sarcoma
virus (fesv) molecularly cloned bacteriophage lambda vector. cloned 
dna fragment 14.4 kilobase pairs long contains 6.7-kilobase provirus
flanked cellular sequences derived nonproductively transformed mink
cells. transfection mouse nih/3t3 cells cloned dna fragment induced
foci transformation efficiencies 10(4) focus-forming units/pmol of
sarcoma virus dna. restriction endonuclease mapping heteroduplex analyses
were used compare ga-fesv provirus snyder-theilen (st)-fesv, 
a second strain contains homologous transformation-specific sequences
(v-fes). viruses general structure 5'-gag-fes-env-c region-3', each
having retained portions feline leukemia virus (felv) gag env genes.
in addition segments shared two sarcoma viruses, ga-fesv contains 1.7
kilobases extra sequences found st-fesv. these, least 400-500
base pairs located near 5' end v-fes encode portion ga-fesv
polyprotein; remaining 1.2 kilobases derived felv env gene but
do appear encode detectable product related felv envelope
glycoprotein. close homology v-fes sequences shows ga- and
st-fesv formed recombination felv similar portions cat
cellular gene (c-fes).
