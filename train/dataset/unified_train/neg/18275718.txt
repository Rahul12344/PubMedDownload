objective: explore role hepatitis c virus core protein the
infiltration metastasis cholangiocarcinoma tissues.
methods: january 2001 november 2006, 34 patients cholangiocarcinoma 
who intact follow-up data randomly chosen. expression hcvc
protein, epithelium markers mesenchymal markers cholangiocarcinoma tissues
were examined sp methods immunohistochemistry, clinical-pathological data
were recorded analyzed.
results: positive expression rate observed 47.1% hcvc protein, 50%
for n-cadherin, 44.1% vimentin, 55.9% fibronectin decreased
expression rate e-cadherin 55.9%, alpha-catenin 70.6%, beta-catenin
for 55.9%. positive expression hcvc protein associated the
decreased expression e-cadherin, alpha-catenin positive expression 
n-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin (chi(2) = 4.480, 4.163, 4.250, 7.438, 12.260, p
< 0.05). positive-correlation expression hcvc protein and
metastasis lymph nodes organs found (chi(2) = 5.708, 4.163, p <
0.05).
conclusion: hcvc protein might promote cholangiocarcinoma tissues' infiltration
and metastasis inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
