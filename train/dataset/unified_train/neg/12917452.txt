the hepatitis c virus (hcv) ns3 protein possesses protease helicase
activities essential virus replication maturation. specific
inhibition ns3 enzymatic activity achieved antibody binding.
transduction hepatocytes encoding cdna leading intracellular
expression antibody fragments expected terminate hcv replication in
infected cells. objective present study generation human
antibody fragments neutralize viral ns3 helicase activity gene
therapeutic applications drug design. human immunoglobulin phage-display
library cloned bone marrow aspirate patients infected hcv used
for affinity selection hcv ns3 helicase. antibody fragments high
affinity hcv helicase isolated. evaluate inhibitory potential of
isolated single-chain antibody fragments, helicase-mediated, dna-unwinding
enzymatic assay developed elisa format. recombinant protein comprising the
full-length hcv ns3 helicase domain expressed baculovirus expression
system. recombinant antibodies inhibit hcv helicase nanomolar
concentrations, efficacies ranging 20 % complete abrogation of
enzymatic unwinding activity, identified. antibody fragments may be
useful novel gene therapeutic strategies employ intracellular
immunization may provide new insights design small molecule
inhibitors essential hcv proteins.
