hepatitis c virus (hcv) emerging virus medical importance. majority of
hcv infections become chronic lead chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis 
hepatocellular carcinoma. hcv usually induces robust immune responses, it
frequently escapes immune defense establish persistent infection. fact
that hcv exists evolving quasispecies plays important role the
selection escape mutants. furthermore, several viral proteins interfere with
cellular functions, particular, involved immune response the
host. several hcv proteins also modulate cell signalling interaction with
different effectors involved cell proliferation apoptosis, the
interferon-signalling pathway. addition, hcv infects immune cells b
and cells, thus affects normal functions. various strategies
used hcv counter immune response host reviewed here. a
better understanding mechanisms would help design new therapeutic
targets.
