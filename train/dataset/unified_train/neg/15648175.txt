structural studies foot-and-mouth disease virus (fmdv) largely focused on
the mature viral particle, providing atomic resolution images spherical
protein capsid number sero- sub-types, structures highly
immunogenic surface loop, fab gag receptor complexes. additionally,
structures available non-structural proteins. chapter reviews
our current structural knowledge impact understanding virus
life cycle proceeding mature virus immune evasion/inactivation, 
cell-receptor binding replication alludes future structural targets.
