although promoter regions many plant nuclear genes sequenced,
identification active promoter sequence carried 
octopine synthase promoter. analysis callus tissue made use an
enzyme assay. analysed effects 5' deletions plant viral
promoter tobacco callus well regenerated plants, including different 
plant tissues. assayed rna transcription product allows more
direct assessment deletion effects. cauliflower mosaic virus (camv) 35s
promoter provides model plant nuclear promoter system, double-strand dna
genome transcribed host nuclear rna polymerase ii camv
minichromosome. sequences extending -46 sufficient accurate
transcription initiation whereas region -46 -105 increased
greatly level transcription. 35s promoter showed tissue-specificity
of expression.
