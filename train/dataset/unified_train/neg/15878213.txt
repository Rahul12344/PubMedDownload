we analyzed origin evolution viruses classical swine
fever (csf) epidemic affects cuba since 2001 nucleotide sequencing of
regions within e2 glycoprotein ns5b (polymerase) genes. sequence 
of 190 nucleotides e2 gene determined 10 csf viruses isolated at
different locations island, used phylogenetic analyses, including 
sequences viruses 1993--1997 epizootic, previously determined, as
well representatives different csfv genotypes. the
phylogenetic tree obtained indicates viruses circulating present belong
to subgroup 1.2 closely related isolated the
1993--1997 epizootic, including strain margarita used vaccine potency
tests cuba. however, pattern evolution revealed analyses was
different observed previously, western isolates almost
identical margarita strain, eastern isolates showed higher level of
genetic diversification. case, viruses analyzed grouped an
independent, define cluster closely related, albeit distinguishable, from
that margarita-related viruses previously circulated western part 
of cuba. addition, 2001--2003 viruses showed branched pattern a
level sequence diversification similar observed eastern
1993--1997 viruses. interestingly, significant fraction (about 54%) the
mutations found e2 sequence led amino acid replacements. high rate
of non-synonymous mutations found previous cuban epizootic has
not reported csf outbreaks. spite amino acid
replacements, antigenic changes observed reactivity different
isolates csfv-specific mabs polyclonal sera. phylogenetic tree
derived 409 nucleotides ns5b gene seven isolates margarita strain,
was consistent obtained e2 sequences. region, encoding a
non-structural protein, low level fixation non-synonymous mutations was
observed. results obtained suggests epidemiological factors affecting
csfv spread current epizootic cuba favour fixation of
non-synonymous mutation e2 gene, could associated lower
severity clinical signs developed affected animals.
