abundant bioinformatics resources available study complex
microbial metagenomes, however utility viral metagenomics limited.
holovir robust flexible data analysis pipeline provides an
optimized validated workflow taxonomic functional characterization of
viral metagenomes derived invertebrate holobionts. simulated viral
metagenomes comprising varying levels viral diversity abundance used 
to determine optimal assembly gene prediction strategy, multiple
sequence assembly methods gene prediction tools tested order to
optimize analysis workflow. holovir performs pairwise comparisons single
read predicted gene datasets viral refseq database assign
taxonomy additional comparison phage-specific cellular markers is
undertaken support taxonomic assignments identify potential cellular
contamination. broad functional classification predicted genes provided
by assignment cog microbial functional category classifications using eggnog
and higher resolution functional analysis achieved searching enrichment
of specific swiss-prot keywords within viral metagenome. application of
holovir viral metagenomes coral pocillopora damicornis sponge
rhopaloeides odorabile demonstrated holovir provides valuable tool to
characterize holobiont viral communities across species, environments, or
experiments.
