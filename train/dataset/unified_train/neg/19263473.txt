the impact hepatitis b virus (hbv) superinfection hepatitis c virus (hcv)
chronic carriers evaluated long-term follow-up study 29 chronic
anti-hcv carriers acute hepatitis b (avh-b) (case group bc) 29 anti-hcv 
negative patients avh-b (control group b), pair-matched age (+/-5
years), sex, risk factors acquisition hbv infection. patients in
case group bc control group b showed similar initial hbv viral load 
and similar trend becoming negative hbv-dna. avh-b showed severe
course frequently case group bc control group b (34.5% versus
6.9%, p < 0.05). 28 patients case group bc alive end the
acute illness (one death liver failure), 24 followed 2-6 years, 
median 5 years: 22 patients became hbsag-negative two progressed to
hbsag-positive chronic hepatitis. hcv-rna undetectable patients during
avh-b; 24 patients long-term follow-up, hcv-rna detected in
seven (29.2%) 1 year, 14 (58.3%) 2 years, 18 (75%) after
3-6 years. six patients eradicated chronic hcv infection, compared with
18 showing reactivation hcv replication, higher values aspartate
aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase higher prevalence cases
with severe avh-b (83.3% versus 22.2%, p < 0.05).conclusions: although 
life-threatening, hbv superinfection hcv chronic carriers may lead to
clearance chronic hcv infection, especially patients severe avh-b.
