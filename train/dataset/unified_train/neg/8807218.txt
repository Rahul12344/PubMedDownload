in response need simple rapid tests infectious diseases, we
have devised test antibodies human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1)
and hiv-2 resembles many contemporary strip-style pregnancy tests format
and ease use. test evaluated 2,928 serum specimens (1,541
reactive 1,387 nonreactive) collected tested mexico city hospital
clinic compared laboratory assay (abbott) performed
simultaneously. sensitivity specificity test using serum
specimens 99.68 99.71%, respectively (before code blinded
study broken). compares 100% sensitivity 97.55% specificity
with laboratory assay (specificity upon reassay code broken,
99.21%). survey hiv-2 specimens, reactive (positive) specimens were
detected 51 51 cases. test examined 21 commercially available 
(hiv-1) seroconversion panels. performance test comparable that
of group food drug administration-approved (antibody-based) hiv tests.

pip: simple rapid methods detecting infectious disease needed. the
authors therefore developed test antibodies hiv-1 hiv-2 which
resembles many contemporary strip-style pregnancy tests format ease
of use. test evaluated 1541 reactive 1387 nonreactive serum
specimens collected tested mexico city hospital clinic. laboratory
assay performed simultaneously. sensitivity specificity test
using serum specimens 99.68% 99.71%, respectively. laboratory 
assay 100% sensitive 97.55% specific. reactive hiv-2 specimens were
detected. test examined 21 commercially available hiv-1
seroconversion panels. performance authors' test comparable to
that group food drug administration approved hiv tests.
