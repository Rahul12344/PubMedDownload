nasal turbinates swabs collected wild ducks, geese, owls, sparrows, 
swallows, starlings sentinel ducks placed next turkey farms
experiencing avian pneumovirus (apv) infections analyzed apv genome 
and infectious particles. apv rna detected samples examined geese,
sparrows, starlings. apv rna antibodies also detected two
different groups sentinel ducks. infectious apv recovered sentinel
duck samples. apv gene isolated wild birds 96% predicted 
amino acid identity apv/minnesota 2a, isolated earlier from
domestic turkeys showing respiratory illness, suggesting wild birds may be
involved spreading apv infection.
