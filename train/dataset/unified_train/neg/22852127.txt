cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist (ltra) widely used medicine for
asthma. cysteinyl leukotrienes (cyslts) involved regulation of
dendritic cell (dc) function. however, effects ltra dc-related
antimicrobial immunity harmful respiratory pathogens remain unknown. 
purpose study examine effects ltra administered vivo 
dc function representative respiratory pathogens vitro. pulmonary dcs 
were isolated four groups mice: control, mite allergen sensitized (as),
and mice treated corticosteroid dexamethasone (dex) ltra 
pranlukast (prl). dcs incubated mite allergen, lipopolysaccharide
(lps), aspergillus fumigatus, respiratory syncytial virus (rsv). il-10 and
il-12 production determined. dex treatment significantly inhibited
lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced il-10 il-12 production well baseline
il-12 production mice. prl significantly inhibit lps-induced
il-10 il-12 production mice. importantly, prl significantly
increased il-10 il-12 mice rsv infection. study shows that
ltra used asthma potentially up-regulates antimicrobial immunity
through modulation dc function respiratory infections without
immunosuppression.
