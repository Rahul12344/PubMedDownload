since advent highly pathogenic variants avian influenza virus (hpaiv), 
the main focus avian influenza research characterization and
detection hpaiv hemagglutinin (ha) h5 h7 subtypes. however, due to
the high mutation reassortation rate influenza viruses, theory any
influenza strain may acquire increased pathogenicity irrespective subtype.
a comprehensive antigenic characterization influenza viruses encompassing 
16 ha 9 neuraminidase subtypes provide information useful design
of differential diagnostic tools, possibly, vaccines. expressed
recombinant ha proteins 3 different influenza virus ha subtypes the
baculovirus system. proteins used generate polyclonal rabbit
antisera, subsequently employed epitope scanning analysis using
peptide libraries spanning entire ha. here, report identification 
characterization linear, ha subtype-specific well inter
subtype-conserved epitopes along ha proteins. selected subtype-specific
epitopes shown suitable differentiation anti-ha antibodies 
in elisa.
