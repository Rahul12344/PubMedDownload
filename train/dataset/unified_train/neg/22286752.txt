background: patients, especially young children, atopic dermatitis an
increased risk developing eczema vaccinatum, severe reaction smallpox
vaccine, either direct vaccination indirect contact person
recently vaccinated.
methods: using mouse model infection, severity vaccinia-induced
lesions assessed appearance viral dna content. response to
vaccinia inoculation assessed young adult mice, allergen-sensitized
mice, mast cell-deficient mice.
results: young age, sensitization allergen prior infection, mast
cell deficit, accomplished using mast cell-deficient mice, resulted more
severe viral lesions site inoculation, according lesion appearance
and viral dna content. three factors combined demonstrated maximal
susceptibility, characterized severity primary lesions the
development secondary (satellite) lesions, occurs eczema vaccinatum in
humans. resistance appearance satellite lesions could restored by
adoptive transfer bone marrow-derived mast cells either wild-type or
cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide-deficient mice. primary lesions were
more severe following latter transfer, indicating cathelicidin-related
antimicrobial peptide contribute protective activity mast cells
against infection.
conclusions: combination young age, allergen sensitization mast cell
deficit resulted severe lesions, including satellite lesions.
understanding factors determining relative resistance/sensitivity to
vaccinia virus aid development strategies preventing and
treating adverse reactions occur smallpox vaccination.
