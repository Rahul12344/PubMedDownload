human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) large dna virus well equipped evade 
host immune responses able establish lifelong latency. able to
modulate innate adaptive immune reactivity, multiple effects 
the cell cycle apoptosis. major opportunistic pathogen in
immunocompromised hosts. reactivation latent virus may re-stimulate memory
t-cell responses sufficient re-establish control viral
replication degree immune suppression great. following
allogeneic transplantation immune responses often inadequate resulting in
progressive tissue damage manifesting hcmv disease usually presents 
as pneumonitis, colitis hepatitis. currently available antiviral
pharmacotherapies limited toxicities lack efficacy established
hcmv disease. efforts therefore focused molecular diagnostic surveillance
protocols allow earlier intervention, development adoptive
immunotherapeutic strategies hasten host immune reconstruction.
