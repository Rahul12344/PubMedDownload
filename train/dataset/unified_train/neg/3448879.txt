complementation two temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants adenovirus type 5
was attempted tumour extract hep-2 cell cultures permissive and
restrictive temperature. ts mutants successfully complemented with
adenovirus gene products extracted bladder kidney carcinoma cells. the
percentage incidence complementation appeared higher extracts
obtained female patients obtained males. gene 
sequences may occur penile carcinoma cells bladder carcinoma cells
showing early signs malignization. extracts seminoma cells cells
from prostatic hypertrophies contained adenovirus genes less frequently;
infectious virus never obtained them. applies cells the
non-tumourous ("control") patients tested. old age patients some
properties tumours examined suggest hormonal changes may contribute
to adenovirus gene expression and, indirectly, malignant process its
continuity.
