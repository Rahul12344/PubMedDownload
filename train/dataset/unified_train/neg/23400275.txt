given shared risk factors transmission, co-infection hepatitis b virus
(hbv) hepatitis c virus (hcv) and/or human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) is
quite common, may lead increases morbidity mortality. such, hbv 
vaccine recommended primary means prevent hbv super-infection in
hcv- and/or hiv-infected individuals. however, vaccine response (sero-conversion 
with hepatitis b surface antibody titer >10 iu/l) setting often
blunted, poor response rates standard hbv vaccinations virally
infected individuals compared healthy subjects. phenomenon
also occurs vaccines adults, pneumococcal influenza
vaccines, immunocompromised hosts really risk for
opportunistic infections, individuals hemodialysis, transplant, 
malignancy. review, summarize underlying mechanisms involving
vaccine failure conditions, focusing immune exhaustion immune
senescence--two distinct signaling pathways regulating cell function fate. we
raise possibility blocking negative signaling pathways might
improve success rates immunizations setting chronic viral infection.
