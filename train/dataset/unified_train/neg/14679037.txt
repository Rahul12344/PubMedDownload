viruses long considered among potential environmental triggers type 
1 diabetes mellitus. epidemiologic seroprevalence studies associated
enterovirus infection development prediabetic autoimmunity the
onset clinical diabetes. enterovirus infection also temporally
correlated disease onset virus isolation detection viral genome 
by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). large-scale 
prospective studies required firmly establish causal relationship
between enterovirus infection development prediabetic autoimmunity or
progression autoimmunity clinical diabetes, sensitive rt-pcr methods must
be used detect virus prior onset diabetic symptoms. have
developed rt-seminested pcr protocol detect enteroviruses clinical
specimens. method approximately 10,000-fold sensitive than
conventional, single-amplification pcr. further, developed molecular
methods rapidly reliably identify enterovirus serotype, bypassing the
cumbersome often problematic neutralization test. molecular serotyping
approach valuable examining relationships particular virus
serotypes genotypes specific diseases.
