growth factor receptors play important role hematopoiesis. order to
further understand mechanisms directing expression key
regulators hematopoiesis, initiated study investigating transcription
factors activating expression granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) receptor alpha gene. here, demonstrate that
the human gm-csf receptor alpha promoter directs reporter gene activity a
tissue-specific fashion myelomonocytic cells, correlates its
expression pattern analyzed reverse transcription pcr. gm-csf receptor 
alpha promoter contains important functional site positions -53 and
-41 identified deletion analysis reporter constructs. show the
myeloid b cell transcription factor pu.1 binds specifically site.
furthermore, demonstrate ccaat site located upstream pu.1 site
between positions -70 -54 involved positive-negative regulation 
gm-csf receptor alpha promoter activity. c/ebp alpha major
ccaat/enhancer-binding protein (c/ebp) form binding site nuclear
extracts u937 cells. point mutations either pu.1 site c/ebp site
that abolish binding respective factors result significant
decrease gm-csf receptor alpha promoter activity myelomonocytic cells only.
furthermore, demonstrate myeloid b cell extracts, pu.1 forms a
novel, specific, slowly migrating complex (pu-sf) binding gm-csf
receptor alpha promoter pu.1 site. first demonstration specific 
interaction pu.1 myeloid pu.1 binding site. novel complex is
distinct described previously binding b cell enhancer sites and
can formed addition pu.1 extracts certain nonmyeloid cell types 
which express pu.1, including cells epithelial cells, from
erythroid cells. furthermore, demonstrate pu-sf complex binds pu.1
sites found number myeloid promoters, formation requires an
intact pu.1 site adjacent single-stranded region. expression pu.1 in
nonmyeloid cells activate gm-csf receptor alpha promoter. deletion the
amino-terminal region pu.1 results failure form pu-sf complex 
in concomitant loss transactivation, suggesting formation pu-sf 
complex functional importance activity gm-csf receptor alpha
promoter. finally, demonstrate c/ebp alpha also active gm-csf
receptor alpha promoter nonmyeloid cells. results suggest pu.1 
c/ebp alpha direct cell-type-specific expression gm-csf receptor alpha,
further establish role pu.1 key regulator hematopoiesis, point
to c/ebp alpha additional important factor process.
