we previously shown local infection tobacco plants tobacco
mosaic virus (tmv) oilseed rape mosaic virus (ormv) results systemic
increase homologous recombination frequency (hrf). here, analyzed 
other changes genome triggered pathogen infection. analysis
of hrf, mutation frequency (mf) microsatellite instability (mi), used
three different transgenic arabidopsis lines carrying β-glucuronidase (gus)-based
substrates genome. found local infection arabidopsis with
ormv resulted increase three frequencies, albeit differing
degrees. prominent increase observed microsatellite instability. 
the increase hrf lowest, although still statistically significant. the
analysis methylation 35s promoter transgene expression showed 
the greater instability transgene attributed changes.
strand breaks brought significant increase non-treated tissues of
infected plants. expression genes associated various repair
processes, ku70, rad51, msh2, dna pol α dna pol δ, also
increased. summarize, data demonstrate local ormv infection
destabilizes genome systemic tissues arabidopsis plants various ways
resulting large rearrangements, point mutations microsatellite
instability.
