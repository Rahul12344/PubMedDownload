influenza viruses cause respiratory infections range asymptomatic 
deadly humans. widespread outbreaks (pandemics) attributable 'novel'
viruses possess viral hemagglutinin (ha) gene humans lack
immunity. pandemic, novel viruses form stable virus lineages in
humans circulate replaced novel viruses. factors 
and mechanisms facilitate virus transmission among hosts the
establishment novel lineages completely understood, ha and
basic polymerase 2 (pb2) proteins thought play essential roles these
processes enabling avian influenza viruses infect mammals replicate
efficiently new host. here, summarize current knowledge the
contributions ha, pb2, viral components virus transmission and
the formation new virus lineages.
