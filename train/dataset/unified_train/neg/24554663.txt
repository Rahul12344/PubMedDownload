cd4(+) cd8(+) memory cells stem cell-like properties (t(scm) cells)
have identified mice, humans, nonhuman primates being
investigated antitumor antiviral vaccines immunotherapies. whether
cd4(+) t(scm) cells infected human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) was
investigated using combination hiv reporter virus system vitro by
direct staining hiv p24 antigen ex vivo. proportion t(scm) cells were
found express hiv coreceptors ccr5 cxcr4 infected hiv both
in vitro vivo. analysis viral outcome following fusion using the
combination reporter virus system revealed t(scm) cells become
productively latently infected, although vast majority t(scm) cells are
abortively infected. knockdown hiv restriction factor samhd1 using
vpx-containing simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) virion-like particles enhanced
the productive infection t(scm) cells, indicating samhd1 contributes to
abortive infection cells. results demonstrate cd4(+) t(scm)
cells targets hiv infection, become productively latently
infected low levels, samhd1 expression promotes abortive infection of
this important memory cell subset.importance: demonstrate the
susceptibility cd4(+) memory stem cells (t(scm) cells) infection hiv 
vitro vivo, provide in-depth analysis coreceptor expression,
demonstrate infection na√Øve memory cd4(+) cell subsets both
ccr5- cxcr4-tropic hiv, also perform outcome analysis calculate the
percentage cells productively, latently, abortively infected.
through outcome studies, determined vast majority t(scm)
cells abortively infected hiv, demonstrate knockdown samhd1
significantly increases frequency infection cd4(+) cell subset, 
indicating samhd1 active restriction factor t(scm) cells.
