following infection 16-week old specific pathogen-free (spf) female chickens
with enterotropic variant infectious bronchitis virus (ibv) strain g,
ibv-specific immunoglobulin g (igg) iga detected tears, tracheal
washes, oviduct washes, duodenal caecal contents using class-specific
monoclonal antibodies enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (elisa). igg antibody
content highest tears day 7 post-infection (p.i.) still
detectable day 23 p.i. significant levels igg antibody present in
oviduct washes days 7 23 p.i. tears showed highest iga antibody
concentration sample day 7 p.i. decreased insignificant 
level day 17 p.i. oviduct tracheal washes iga antibodies day 7 p.i.
significant levels antibody classes detected duodenal contents on
day 17 p.i. neither present caecal contents. using method which
compares titre antibody produced pieces tissue 4 degrees c with
that 37 degrees c indicator local secretion, igg iga antibody
synthesis demonstrated harderian gland days 7 17 p.i. local igg
antibody synthesis seen oviduct day 7 p.i. day 23 p.i. the
optical density 4 degrees c higher 37 degrees c, suggestive of
high concentrations extracellular antibody. separate experiment,
passively administered ibv antibody transuded serum oviduct washes 
did trachea. third experiment, elisa and
haemagglutination-inhibition (hi) titres serum oviduct washes ten
hens previously infected day-old compared egg production. maximum 
positive correlation seen hi titres oviduct washes egg
production.
