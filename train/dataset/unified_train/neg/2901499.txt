we analyzed epstein-barr virus (ebv) genomes lymphoblastoid cell lines
isolated patients infectious mononucleosis healthy subjects
from california, hawaii, hong kong 1970 1987. using genetic
polymorphism epidemiological markers, found several genotypes ebv
cocirculate community although ebv strains isolated from
california southern china may differentiated genotypically, no
specific association genotype disease time isolation.
