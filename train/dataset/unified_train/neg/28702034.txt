rna silencing functions major natural antiviral defense mechanism plants.
rna-dependent rna polymerases (rdrs) catalyze synthesis of
double-stranded rnas, considered fundamental element rna silencing
pathways. arabidopsis thaliana, rdr1, 2 6 play important roles in
anti-viral rna silencing. expression rdr1 elevated following plant
treatment defense hormones virus infection. rdr1 studied in
several crop species, pepper (capsicum annuum l.). here, rdr1 gene
was isolated capsicum annuum l., designated cardr1. full-length cdna 
of cardr1 3,351 bp, encoding 1,116-amino acid protein, contains
conserved regions, remarkable motif dldgd. transcripts of
cardr1 could induced salicylic acid (sa), abscisic acid (aba), h2o2, and
tobacco mosaic virus (tmv). silencing cardr1 pepper resulted increased
susceptibility tmv evident severe symptom, increased tmv-cp
transcript, higher malondialdehyde (mda) content lower antioxidant enzymes
activities compared control plants. cardr1-overexpressing in
nicotiana benthamiana showed mild disease symptom reduced tmv-cp transcripts 
than empty vector (ev) following tmv inoculation. rna silencing
related genes, including nbago2, nbdcl2, nbdcl3, nbdcl4 elevated expression
in overexpressed plants. alternative oxidase (aox), terminal oxidase the
cyanide (cn)-resistant alternative respiratory pathway, catalyze oxygen-dependent
oxidation ubiquinol plants. important function plant defense
against tmv. addition, cardr1 overexpression promoted expression of
nbaox1a nbaox1b. conclusion, results suggest cardr1 plays a
positive role tmv resistance regulating antioxidant enzymes activities 
rna silencing-related genes expression suppress replication movement
of tmv.
