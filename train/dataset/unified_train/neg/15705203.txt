background: enteric subgroup f adenoviruses type 40 (ad40) 41 (ad41) 
the second important cause acute infantile gastroenteritis after
rotaviruses. repeated community outbreaks associated antigenic
changes among ad40 ad41 strains due host immune pressure. therefore
large field epidemiological surveys studies genetic variations in
different isolates ad40 ad41 important disease control programs,
the design efficient diagnostic kits vaccines subgroup f
adenoviruses. novel method using sodium dodecyl sulphate sds/edta-pretreated
chromatography paper strips evaluated collection, storage and
shipping ad40/41 contaminated stool samples.
results: study shows adenoviral dna successfully detected the
filter strips pcr four months storage -20 degrees c, 4 degrees c,
room temperature (20-25 degrees c) 37 degrees c. furthermore adenoviral
infectivity observed upon contact sds/edta-pretreated strips.
conclusions: collecting, storing transporting adenovirus type 40 41
positive stool samples sds/edta-pretreated chromatography filter strips a
convenient, biosafe cost effective method studying new genome variants
and monitoring spread enteric adenovirus strains outbreaks.
