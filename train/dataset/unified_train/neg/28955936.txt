intracellularlocation viral unspliced mrna host cell crucial factor 
for normal life virus. rex neucleo-cytoplasmic shuffling protein of
human t-cell leukemia virus-1(htlv-1)which important role active transport
of cargo-containing rna nucleus cytoplasm. therefore, plays crucial 
role disease development virus. spite importance, the
3d-structurephosphorylated unphosphorylated protein been
determined. study, first predicted whether rex protein ordered
or disordered protein. second step protein 3dstructure rex obtained.
the content disorder-promoting amino acids, flexibility, hydrophobicity, short
linear motifs (slims) protein binding regions probability rex
crystallization calculated various silico methods. the3d models rex
protein obtained various silico methods, homology modeling,
threading ab initio, including; i-tasser, lomets, sparsks, robbeta quark 
servers. comparing analyzing qmean, z-scores energy levels selected

confirms unphosphorylated rex protein htlv-1 rev protin hiv is
wholly disordered protein belongs class intrinsically disordered
proteins extended disorder (native coils, native pre-molten globules).
