the enigmatic methyltransferase, dnmt2 (dna methyltransferase 2), structurally
resembles dna methyltransferase, shown trna
methyltransferase targeting cytosine within specific cpg different trna
molecules. previously shown that, environmental stress conditions, 
dnmt2 re-localized nucleus cytoplasmic stress granules (sgs)
and associated rna-processing proteins. present study, show
that dnmt2 binds methylates various mrna species sequence-independent
manner gets re-localized sgs phosphorylation-dependent manner.
importantly, results indicate hiv-1 enhances survivability the
host cell utilizing rna methylation capability dnmt2 increase the
stability genome. upon infection, dnmt2 re-localizes nucleus 
to sgs methylates hiv-1 rna. dnmt2-dependent methylation provided
post-transcriptional stability hiv-1 rna. furthermore, dnmt2
overexpression increased hiv-1 viral titre. would suggest hiv
hijacks rna-processing machinery within sgs ensure survival in
the host cell. thus, findings provide novel mechanism virus
tries modulate host cell machinery advantage.
