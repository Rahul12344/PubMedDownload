objective: paper study influence hot spot mutation in
hepatitis b virus (hbv) basic core promotor (bcp) (nt1762 nt1764) hbeag
status asymptomatic hbv carriers.
methods: mismatched pcr used amplify fragment hbvbcp the
fragments analysed restrict enzyme assay. ninety cases hbv infection
were tested hot spot mutations hbvbcp.
results: twenty-six (43.3%) 60 asymptomatic hbv carriers hbeag negative
were found hot spot mutations hbvbcp, among 20 cases were
accompanied mutation nt 1896 hbv pre-c region. hot-spot mutation 
hbvbcp, however, occurred 3(10%) 30 asymptomatic hbv carriers with
hbeag positive. investigation hbvbcp hot spot mutations in
asymptomatic hbv carriers without mutation hbv pre-c region studied.
six(31.6%) 19 asymptomatic hbv carriers hbeag negative found have
hot spot mutation hbvbcp. two(7.1%) 28 asymptomatic hbv carriers hbeag
positive hot spot mutations hbvbcp, statistically
significant difference two groups.
conclusions: hot spot mutations hbvbcp common hbv carriers with
hbeag negative usually accompanies nt1896 mutation hbv pre-c region. 
it possible hot spot mutation hbvbcp new reason hbeag negative
hbv infection.
