human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) glycoprotein complex ii (gcii) consists two
glycoproteins, gm gn. although gcii specific igg purified hcmv positive 
patient sera neutralize hcmv, report describing the
generation virus-neutralizing antibodies immunization individual
recombinant gm gn antigens. current study, gm gn antigens were
expressed mammalian expression vector pjw4303 used dna vaccines 
determine immunogenicity proteins. sera mice rabbits
immunized individual combinations gm gn dna vaccines contained gm 
and gn specific antibodies confirmed elisa western blot analyses. the
combined gm gn antigens induced strongest antibody responses that
recognized gm gcii complex gm dna vaccine alone could elicit 
antibody specific gm antigen. given alone, gn dna vaccine not
induce detectable gcii specific antibody even though vitro gn expression was
confirmed formation gm/gn complex fsk cells using gn-specific
monoclonal antibody 14-16a. neutralizing antibody titer anti-gm/gn sera
(1:128) higher anti-gm sera (1:32) autologous virus,
hcmv ad169. heterologous hcmv strains including towne davis could also be
neutralized anti-gm/gn antisera. data supported rationale 
use hcmv gm/gn protein complex protective antigens subunit based
hcmv vaccine development. dna vaccination effective approach express the
gm/gn antigen complex vivo without need express purify highly
insoluble structurally complicated antigens.
