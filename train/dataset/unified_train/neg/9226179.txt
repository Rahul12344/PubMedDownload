the human t-cell leukemia virus type (htlv-i) regulatory protein, tax, been
speculated play major role htlv-i leukemogenesis. indeed, several studies
have suggested upregulation various cellular oncogenes cytokines by
tax may explain pathogenesis observed htlv-i-infected individuals, well
as several tax-transgenic animal models. report analysis cytokine 
expression tax-transgenic animal model large granular lymphocytic (lgl)
leukemia. two different transgenic mice showed identical expression of
interleukin-1alpha (il-1alpha), il-1beta, interferon gamma (ifngamma), and
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) peripheral tail
tumors. interestingly, lgl cell lines derived tumors expressed
high levels ifngamma gm-csf, correlated level tax
expression. lgl cell lines also expressed high levels lymphocyte
function-associated antigen-1 (lfa-1) intracellular adhesion molecule-1
(icam-1). engraftment lgl cell lines severe combined
immunodeficient (scid) mice led development leukemia lymphomas.
examination scid mice showed pathology nearly identical
to observed original tax-transgenic mouse model. the
tax-transgenic engrafted scid mouse models allow analysis cellular
events required tumor development associated htlv infection and
suggest tax expression may responsible upregulation certain
cytokines adhesion molecules affect infiltrating capabilities of
htlv-i-infected cells.
