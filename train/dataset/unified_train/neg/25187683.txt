the hbx protein hepatitis b virus (hbv) potential target anti-liver
cancer molecules. therefore, interest screen known natural compounds 
against hbx protein using molecular docking. however, structure hbx is
not yet known. therefore, predicted structure hbx using threading lomet
was used docking plant derived natural compounds (curcumin, oleanolic
acid, resveratrol, bilobetin, luteoline, ellagic acid, betulinic acid rutin) 
by molegro virtual docker. screening identified rutin binding energy 
-161.65 kcal/mol. thus, twenty derivatives rutin designed and
screened hbx. silico experiments identified compounds rutin01
(-163.16 kcal/mol) rutin08 (- 165.76 kcal/mol) consideration 
downstream validation.
