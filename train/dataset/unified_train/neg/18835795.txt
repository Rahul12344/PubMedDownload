the prevalence antibodies bovine coronavirus (bcv) bovine respiratory
syncytial virus (brsv) infections studied 20 conventional 20 organic
dairy herds. organic farms produced 'certified' milk least 2
years. two occasions, 1-year interval, 699 serum samples 624
peri-parturient cows tested elisa antibodies bcv brsv.
accompanying data relating sampled animals collected order to
identify potential factors associated increased antibody prevalence. the
antibody prevalence high sampling times approximately 85% and
80% animals positive antibodies bcv brsv, respectively.
conventional herds significantly higher mean antibody prevalence bcv and
brsv organically managed herds (p<0.01). animal age significantly
associated increased antibody prevalence (p<0.001). findings this
study suggest organic farm management may effective reducing the
seroprevalence viruses relative conventional farming methods.
