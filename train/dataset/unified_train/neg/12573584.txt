the effect thymidine kinase (tk) encoded herpes simplex virus type 1(hsv-1)
strain kos dna replication fidelity examined two different mutagenesis 
assays. mutagenesis assay lacz reporter gene present recombinant
tkltrz1, contained integrated lacz gene tk locus, revealed a
less 0.05% mutation frequency lacz gene regardless whether the
viruses propagated tk-expressing cells control cells, conflicting an
earlier report hsv-1 tk(+) strain replicated 0.5% mutation frequency 
the lacz gene (r. b. pyles r. l. thompson, 1994, j. virol. 68, 4514-4524).
furthermore, tk-proficient -deficient recombinant viruses replicated with
similar mutation frequencies (0.027 0.026%, respectively) lacz gene,
which integrated polymerase locus. results supf mutagenesis assay
demonstrated neither spectra mutation mutation frequencies of
supf gene, integrated tk locus recombinant, were
significantly different (p > 0.05) progeny viruses grown tk-expressing
cells control cells. therefore, lacz supf mutagenesis assays
demonstrated tk hsv-1 strain kos detectable mutator
activity.
