alterations plasma membrane function induced many cytopathic viruses,
including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1). alterations can
result changes intracellular content ions small molecules 
and contribute cytolysis death infected cell. ph-sensitive 
fluorescent probe 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein-acetoxymethyl 
ester used quantitate intracellular ph (phi) hiv-1-infected cells.
infection cells cd4+ t-lymphoblastoid line hut-78 (rh9 subclone) with
hiv-1 strain lai resulted significant decrease phi, approximately
7.2 mock-infected cells 6.7 day 4 infection, cells were
undergoing acute cytopathic effects. phi persistently infected cells 
survived acute cytopathic effects hiv-1 approximately 6.8 7.0.
studies amiloride, inhibitor na+/h+ exchange system, suggest 
hiv-1-induced intracellular acidification lymphocytes due, part, to
dysfunction plasma membrane ion transport system. alterations phi 
may mediate certain cytopathic effects hiv-1, thereby contributing to
depletion cd4+ lymphocytes patients aids.
