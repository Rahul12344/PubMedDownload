background aim: mechanisms ribavirin immune modulator not
been fully revealed, contrary clinical benefit chronic hepatitis c.
recently, host immune defense, especially cytotoxic lymphocytes helper
cells, considered closely related pathophysiology of
chronic viral hepatitis. aim present study evaluate the
function ribavirin cellular immunity.
methods: peripheral blood mononuclear cells total rna prepared from
chronic hepatitis c patients. evaluate polarization helper cells, 
performed intracellular cytokine assay quantified production key
cytokines. mrna levels interleukin-12 receptor (il-12r), interferon
(ifn)-gamma interleukin-4 (il-4) measured real time reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr).
results: population helper 1 cells increased significantly in
mitogen hepatitis c virus (hcv) core protein stimulated cells 0.1
microg/ml ribavirin. however, population helper 2 cells seem 
to affected ribavirin. level il-12r beta2 chain mrna also
upregulated 130% 24 h incubation 0.1 microg/ml ribavirin (p =
0.037), whereas beta1 chain change significantly these
conditions. addition, 0.1 microg/ml ribavirin could upregulate levels of
ifn-gamma il-4 mrna cases.
conclusion: ribavirin, perhaps acting directly cd4+ cells, induces cell
differentiation towards type 1, depending upregulated signal the
il-12/il-12r pathway.
