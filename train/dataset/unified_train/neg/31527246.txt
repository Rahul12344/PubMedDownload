viral cancers show oncogene addiction viral oncoproteins, required
for survival proliferation dedifferentiated cancer cell. human merkel 
cell carcinomas (mccs) harbor clonally integrated merkel cell polyomavirus
(mcv) genome low mutation burden require viral antigen expression 
tumor growth. here, showed mcv+ mcc cells cocultured keratinocytes
undergo neuron-like differentiation neurite outgrowth, secretory vesicle
accumulation, generation sodium-dependent action potentials, hallmarks
of neuronal cell lineage. cocultured keratinocytes essential induction 
of neuronal phenotype. keratinocyte-conditioned medium insufficient to
induce phenotype. single-cell rna sequencing revealed antigen
knockdown inhibited cell cycle gene expression reduced expression key
merkel cell lineage/mcc marker genes, including hes6, sox2, atoh1, krt20 of
these, antigen knockdown directly inhibited sox2 atoh1 expression. mcv
large up-regulated sox2 retinoblastoma protein-inhibition domain,
which turn activated atoh1 expression. knockdown sox2 mcv+ mccs
mimicked antigen knockdown inducing mcc cell growth arrest neuron-like
differentiation. results show sox2-dependent conversion an
undifferentiated, aggressive cancer cell differentiated neuron-like
phenotype suggest ontology mcc arises neuronal cell
precursor.
