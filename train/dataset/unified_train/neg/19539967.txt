the membrane-proximal external region (mper) gp41 considered prime
target induction neutralizing antibodies, since contains the
epitopes three broadly neutralizing antibodies (2f5, 4e10 z13). we
present novel gp41 construct (ha-gp41) comprising gp41 hr2 mper fused to
two triple-stranded coiled-coil domains ends. ha-gp41 trimeric, 
high helical content solution forms rod-like structures revealed by
negative staining electron microscopy. immunization rabbits ha-gp41
induced antibodies directed mper, failed exert significant
neutralization capacity envelopes primary isolates. thus
trimerisation mper regions suffice induce potent neutralizing
antibody response specific conserved regions within gp41.
