here, report diversity amantadine-resistant mutants among avian
influenza viruses pandemic potential (h5, h6, h7, h9 hemagglutinin
subtypes). drug-resistant variants detected among 1979--83 isolates,
whereas 31.1% h5 10.6% h9 strains southeast asia isolated in
2000-04 carried mutations m2 protein. north america, resistant variants
occurred among h7 viruses (16.4% tested). h6 viruses were
amantadine-sensitive. findings prompt concern regarding control of
pandemic influenza, possibility next pandemic virus be
amantadine-resistant need monitor use drug poultry.
