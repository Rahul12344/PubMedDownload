background aims: majority cases anal squamous cell carcinoma human 
papilloma virus (hpv)-induced result anal intraepithelial neoplasia
(ain). study conducted examine methods may enable routine
diagnosis hpv-induced changes anal rim consequences such
detection especially view sensitive diagnosis ain. results were
clinically correlated.
methods: study included biopsy samples 87 patients been
diagnosed following disease patterns: 47 invasive anal carcinoma, 33 ain
of varying severity seven condylomatous lesions. 52 cases, a
tumour clinically suspected. biopsies retrospectively examined for
microscopic indications hpv infection. microdissection, additional hpv
analysis via pcr carried out.
results: 38 47 cases anal carcinoma, hpv dna could detected via pcr
(80.9%), majority hpv 16 (33/38=86.8%). 29 33 cases
of ain, hpv dna detected (87.9%), iii (15/16=93.8%).
histological markers hpv infection detected 87 cases.
discussion: series, clinical diagnosis invasive anal carcinoma 
had high sensitivity 93.6%, specificity 80%. positive
predictive value 84.6%, negative predictive value 91.4%. contrast,
ain detected clinically none cases. situation,
especially high-risk patients, findings recommend anal hpv screening 
combination anal cytology anoscopy.
conclusion: based results, urgently recommend histological
report excision anal lesions include statement whether histological
markers hpv infection detected. individual cases, validation via hpv
