the use reduced intensity regimens decreased early mortality following
stem cell transplantation. however, increased immunosuppression following
these protocols results profound often prolonged lymphopenia, resulting in
an increased incidence viral reactivation. others observed high 
incidence ebv viraemia post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (ptld) 
following reduced-intensity conditioning regimens, reflecting delayed
recovery ebv-specific immunity transplants. clinical and
histological features presentation similar seen conventional
intensity conditioning. given increasing use reduced intensity
conditioning (ric) transplants, review risk factors ebv related
disease following transplantation ric, potential pre-emptive therapy
of ptld based monitoring ebv viraemia management options patients.
