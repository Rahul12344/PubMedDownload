evaluated treatment chronic hdv infection standard pegylated
interferon least 48 weeks identified. inclusion criteria were
positive anti-hdv antibody 6 months positive hdv-pcr start of
study. performed meta-analysis proportions using arcsine
transformation random effects model. sustained virological response (svr) rate
(negative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) 6 months cessation therapy)
was end point interest.
results: data abstracted 14 studies containing 227 chronic hdv-infected
patients received standard pegylated interferon alpha-2a -2b.
twenty-one 30 patients 71 156 received standard peginterferon, 
respectively, beyond 48 weeks achieved svr. pooled svr rates 29% [95%
confidence interval (ci) 19; 41] 19% (95% ci 10; 29), respectively. rates
of treatment withdrawal similar.
