our earlier study demonstrated hepatitis c virus (hcv)-associated
cholesterol plays key role virus infectivity. study, structural 
requirement sterols infectivity, buoyant density apolipoprotein
association hcv investigated further. removed cholesterol virions 
with methyl β-cyclodextrin, followed replenishment 10 exogenous
cholesterol analogues. among sterols tested, dihydrocholesterol and
coprostanol maintained buoyant density hcv infectivity, and
7-dehydrocholesterol restored physical appearance hcv, suppressed 
infectivity. sterol variants 3β-hydroxyl group aliphatic 
side chain restore density infectivity. also provide evidence 
virion-associated cholesterol contributes interaction hcv
particles apolipoprotein e. molecular basis effects different 
sterols hcv infectivity discussed.
