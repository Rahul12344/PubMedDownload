background: goal antiretroviral therapy (art) suppress virus
replication limit immune system damage. proposed combining art 
immune therapies boost antiviral immunity. successful, art must
not impair physiological immune function.
methods: studied impact art (tenofovir emtricitabine) systemic
and mucosal immunity uninfected simian immunodeficiency (siv)-infected
chinese rhesus macaques. subcutaneous art initiated 2 weeks tonsillar
inoculation sivmac239.
results: evidence immune dysregulation result art in
either infected uninfected animals. early virus-induced alterations in
circulating immune cell populations (decreased central memory cells myeloid
dendritic cells) detected, normalized shortly art initiation.
art-treated animals showed marginal siv-specific t-cell responses during
treatment, increased art discontinuation. elevated expression of
cxcl10 oral, rectal, blood samples apobec3g mrna oral rectal
tissues observed acute infection regulated starting
art. art impact ability animals respond tonsillar
application polyiclc increased cxcl10 expression oral fluids cd80 
expression blood myeloid dendritic cells.
conclusion: early initiation art prevented virus-induced damage not
impede mucosal systemic immune functions.
