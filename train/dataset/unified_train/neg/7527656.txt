nitric oxide synthase (nos) catalyzes conversion l-arginine citrulline 
and nitric oxide (.no). baculovirus overexpression system developed
for constitutive nos isoform, cloned originally rat cerebellum (b-nos).
recombinant virus used multiplicity infection 5 infect
spodoptera frugiperda cells culture, nos expressed 10% total
soluble protein 48 h postinfection. order express catalytically active
enzyme, necessary supplement culture media hemin. this
increased activity enzyme 7-fold. two column affinity purification
was developed recombinant enzyme, gave homogeneous protein that
migrated 150 kda denaturing polyacrylamide gel. km l-arginine was
determined 2.0 +/- 0.4 microm. isolated, recombinant b-nos exhibited a
soret maximum 402 nm, shifted 394 nm presence l-arginine.
the soret maximum reduced enzyme presence co 444 nm. initial
rate steady-state kinetic analysis recombinant b-nos showed evidence of
substrate inhibition l-arginine, could also seen partially
purified preparation b-nos rat cerebella. substrate inhibition was
not observed inducible isoform nos, purified immunostimulated
murine macrophages. c415h mutant overexpressed purified using 
conditions established wild-type recombinant b-nos. c415h mutant
exhibited activity bind heme, providing first experimental
evidence support previously reported primary amino acid comparisons which
suggest c415 provides coordinating thiolate heme moiety b-nos.
