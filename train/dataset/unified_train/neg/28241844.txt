background: effective therapeutic management elderly patients cancer, 
an individual basis, remains clinical challenge. here, identify novel
biomarkers assess elderly patients (≥70 years age) breast cancer
undergoing treatment without chemotherapy.
methods: performed comprehensive geriatric assessment measured markers
sensitive alteration ageing, including leukocyte telomere length, cmv
serostatus, levels circulating growth factors cytokines, immune
profiling cell myeloid populations blood 3 months and
12 months initiation therapy, using flow cytometry.
results: observed changes immune profiles time specific to
patients receiving chemotherapy; patients elevated cd4+ effector
memory re-expressing cd45ra (temra) cells relatively lower cd8+ central
memory cells 3 months, normalized levels 12 months. patients'
baseline immune profiles correlated markers telomere length,
cytomegalovirus (cmv) serostatus levels circulating cytokines. also
identified correlations baseline immune profile geriatric assessment,
i.e. frail patients higher levels granulocytic cells lower levels
of cells suppressor phenotypes including myeloid-derived suppressor cells
and regulatory cells, although none examined immune populations
correlated chronological age. importantly, immune profiles prior therapy 
predicted unexpected hospitalizations patients receiving chemotherapy.
conclusion: findings suggest immune profiling may represent novel
complementary approach accurately assess global health status 
elderly patient breast cancer select appropriate individual
treatment option.
