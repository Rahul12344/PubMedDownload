the ts cb1200 (antimutator) mutation bacteriophage t4 dna polymerase increases
the accuracy dna replication since results decrease frequency
of mutations phage genes. cb120 polymerases differs wild
type enzyme slow rate copies templates primer extension 
requries displacement polynucleotides base-paired template strand, even
in presence t4 dna unwinding protein (gene 32-protein). ratio of
nucleotides turned (dna-dependent conversion deoxynucleoside triphosphate
to deoxynucleoside monophosphate) nucleotides stably incorporated product
is 10 100 times higher mutant wild type enzyme, depending the
dna used template. high turnover rate may increase efficiency

antimutator t4 dna polymerases. since 3'- 5'-exonuclease activity the
cb120 mutant polymerase higher wild type enzyme, is
suggested high turnover rate may result increased opportunity to
remove newly incorporated nucleotides due slow rate mutant
enzyme moves next template nucleotide. accompanying paper show
that cb120 antimutator polymerase also initially selects incorrect
nucleotides incorporation less frequently wild type enzyme. thus
this antimutator polymerase appears greater accuracy nucleotide
selection enhanced ability remove incorrect nucleotides.
