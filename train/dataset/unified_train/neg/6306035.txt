conventional enhanced plaque neutralization assay polio antibody.

hep-2 cells suitable cell substrate vero cells plaque
assay wild attenuated strains poliovirus. polio antibody titration by
plaque neutralization average 3.4 4.8 times sensitive than
antibody titration virus cpe assay. pronounced effect virus
neutralization achieved extending time serum-virus interaction.
incubating virus-antiserum mixture 20 h instead 1 h 36 degrees c
increased antibody titer three poliovirus types 11- 28-fold.
potentiation poliovirus neutralization heterologous antiglobulin was
considerably less effective virus-antibody systems. virus
plaque neutralization technique described capable measuring minute
amounts antibody required special circumstances.
