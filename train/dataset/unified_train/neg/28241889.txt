background: purpose present study explore novel biomarkers that
can predict clinical outcome patients treatment during
vaccination. would useful selection appropriate patients 
would expected exhibit better treatment outcomes vaccination, 
facilitating development cancer vaccine treatments.
methods: single-arm, non-randomized, human leukocyte antigen
(hla)-a-status-blind phase ii trial vaccine treatment using three
hla-a*2402-restricted peptides advanced pancreatic cancer (pc), obtained
peripheral blood samples 36 patients hla-a*2402-matched group 27
patients hla-a*2402-unmatched group.
results: multivariate analysis (hr = 2.546; 95% ci = 1.138 5.765; p = 0.0231) 
and log-rank test (p = 0.0036) showed high expression level programmed 
death-1 (pd-1) cd4+ cells negative predictive biomarker overall
survival hla-a*2402-matched group . moreover, high expression level of
pd-1 cd4+ cells negative predictor induction cytotoxic t
lymphocytes (p = 0.0007). treatment, found upregulation pd-1
and cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (tim-3) expression cd4+ cd8+ cells was
significantly associated poor clinical outcome hla-a*2402-matched
group (p = 0.0330, 0.0282, 0.0046, 0.0068, respectively). contrast, 
was significant difference factors hla-a*2402-unmatched
group.
conclusions: results indicate upregulation pd-1 tim-3
expression cd4+ cd8+ cells may restrict cell responses advanced pc 
patients; therefore, combination immunotherapy blockade pd-1 tim-3 to
restore cell responses may potential therapeutic approach advanced pc 
patients.
