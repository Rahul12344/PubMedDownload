participatory systems surveillance acute respiratory infection give
real-time information infections circulating community, yet to-date 
are limited self-reported syndromic information lacking methods of
linking symptom reports infection types. developed goviral platform 
evaluate whether cohort lay volunteers could, and would find it useful to,
contribute self-reported symptoms online and compare specimen types for
self-collected diagnostic information sufficient quality respiratory
infection surveillance. volunteers recruited, given kit (collection
materials customized instructions), instructed report symptoms
weekly, sick cold flu-like symptoms, requested collect
specimens (saliva nasal swab). compared specimen types respiratory
virus detection sensitivity (via polymerase-chain-reaction) ease of
collection. participants surveyed determine receptivity participating 
when sick, receiving information type pathogen causing their
infection types circulating near them. december 1 2013 march 1
2014, 295 participants enrolled study received kit. who
reported symptoms, half (71) collected sent specimens analysis.
participants submitted kits average 2.30 days (95 ci: 1.65 2.96) after
symptoms began. found good concordance nasal saliva specimens 
multiple pathogens, discrepancies. individuals report saliva
collection easiest report receiving information pathogen
they, near them, valued shape public health behaviors. 
community-submitted specimens used detection acute respiratory 
infection individuals showing receptivity participating interest
in a real-time picture respiratory pathogens near them.
