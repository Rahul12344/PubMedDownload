background: active immunotherapy targeting amyloid-β (aβ) promising
treatment alzheimer's disease (ad). numerous preclinical studies clinical
trials demonstrated safe effective ad vaccine induce high
titers anti-aβ antibodies avoiding activation cells specific to
aβ.
results: untagged aβ1-6 chimeric protein vaccine ad based norovirus
(nov) p particle expressed escherichia coli obtained sequential
chromatography. analysis protein characteristics showed untagged
aβ1-6 chimeric protein expressed soluble form exhibited highest particle
homogeneity, highest purity minimal host cell protein (hcp) residual
dna content. importantly, untagged aβ1-6 chimeric soluble protein could
induce strongest aβ-specific humoral immune responses without activation of
harmful aβ-specific cells mice.
conclusions: untagged aβ1-6 chimeric protein vaccine safe highly
immunogenic. research determine efficacy cognitive
improvement disease progression delay.
