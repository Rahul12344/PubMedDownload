transduction extrachromosomal markers resistance penicillin and
erythromycin staphylococcal strains isolated patients studied. two
transduction methods compared, i. e. transduction phage filtrate of
the donor culture resistant erythromycin transduction mixed cultivation
of donor recipient. higher transduction rate observed the
latter method. mixed cultivation donor cultures resistant penicillin or
erythromycin recipient strains wild type sensitive these
antibiotic resulted transduction respective markers. transductants
which acquired prophage 6 simultaneously marker egg became donors of
