human adenoviruses (hadv), particular types 4 7, frequently cause acute
respiratory disease (ard) basic military training. hadv4 hadv7
vaccines reduced ard risk u.s. military. important identify other
respiratory pathogens assess potential impact military readiness. in
2002, period hadv vaccines available, throat swabs
were taken trainees (n = 184) respiratory infections fort jackson,
south carolina. viral etiology investigated initially viral culture 
neutralization assay recently study sequencing viral isolates.
viral culture neutralization assays identified 90 hadv4 isolates 27
additional cultures showed viral cytopathic effects (cpe), including some
with picornavirus-like cpe. next-generation sequencing confirmed results
and determined viral genotypes, including 77 hadv4, 4 hadv3, 1 hadv2, 17
coxsackievirus a21 (cav21), 1 enterovirus d68. two samples positive 
both hadv4 cav21. identified genotypes phylogenetically close 
distinct found years military/non-military
sites. hadv4 predominant respiratory pathogen unvaccinated military
trainee. hadv4 temporal demographic variability. cav21 significant
respiratory pathogen needs evaluated current significance in
military basic trainees.
