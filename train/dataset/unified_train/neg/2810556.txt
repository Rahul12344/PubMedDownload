prior limited field application orally-administered vaccinia-rabies
glycoprotein (v-rg) recombinant virus vaccine wildlife, background data 
obtained proposed site parramore island, virginia (usa). mammalian
target nontarget species, potentially risk exposure vaccine were
inventoried. placebo baiting trials fishmeal polymer bait resulted high
bait disturbance (88 100%), primarily raccoons (procyon lotor), with
infrequent visitation evidence bait consumption deer (odocoileus
virginianus), small mammals avian species. definitive bait acceptance rates by
raccoons (indicative bait ingestion) difficult accurately determine
based exclusively premolar vibrissae samples collected antemortem from
live-trapped raccoons tetracycline rhodamine b biomarker analyses,
respectively. bait acceptance rate accurately determined pilot 
baiting trial conducted north island, south carolina, mandibles
(postmortem samples) examined tetracycline incorporation. parasitologic 
findings raccoons parramore island included hepatozoan procyonis, phagicola
angrense physaloptera rara variety incidental microscopic lesions,
and provided baseline pathological data comparison subsequent v-rg vaccine
application. population density estimate one raccoon/2.7 ha calculated
using mark-recapture data comparison vaccine deployment. limited
reproductive data, including estimates pregnancy rates palpation, the
number live kits/litter live-trapped previously pregnant raccoons or
observed dens radio-collared raccoons, gathered assess the
effect proposed oral vaccination v-rg vaccine. home ranges assessed 
by radio-telemetry 15 raccoons; radio-collared raccoons currently reside
on parramore island.(abstract truncated 250 words)
