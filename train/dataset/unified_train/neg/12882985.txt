apolipoprotein j/clusterin enigmatic protein highly regulated in
inflammation, apoptosis, cancer. despite extensive studies, biological
function remained obscure. show apolipoprotein j inhibits
neuroblastoma cell invasion. since function regulated nf-kappab,
we explored possibility apolipoprotein j might interfere nf-kappab 
signaling. ectopic apolipoprotein j expression strongly inhibited nf-kappab
activity human neuroblastoma cells murine embryonic fibroblasts by
stabilizing inhibitors nf-kappab (ikappabs). steady state levels ikappab
proteins drastically reduced mouse embryo fibroblasts disruption 
the apolipoprotein j gene. absence apolipoprotein j causes reduction of
ikappab stability, tumor necrosis factor-dependent increase nf-kappab
activity, increased transcription nf-kappab target gene c-iap and
down-modulation p53 protein. results suggest unexpected
physiological role apolipoprotein j inhibit nf-kappab signaling 
stabilization ikappabs activity may result suppression of
tumor cell motility.
