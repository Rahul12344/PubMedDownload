fam134b (family sequence similarity 134, member b)/retreg1 its
functional roles relatively new human diseases. review aimed to
summarize various functions fam134b since first discovery gene in
2001. protein encoded fam134b reticulophagy receptor regulates
turnover endoplasmic reticulum (er) selective phagocytosis. absence 
non-functional expression fam134b protein impairs er-turnover thereby is
involved pathogenesis human diseases. fam134b inhibition
contributes impair proteostasis er due accumulation misfolded
or aggregated proteins, turn leads compromised neuronal survival 
progressive neuronal degenerative diseases. mutations fam134b associated 
hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy type iib (hsan iib). selective
cleavage fam134b dengue, zika, west nile virus encoded protease ns2b3
leads increased production infection units, whereas upregulation of
fam134b inhibits viral replication. cancer, fam134b acts tumor suppressor
and inhibit cancer growth in-vitro in-vivo. pharmacological upregulation
of fam134b resulted reduced cancer cell growth proliferation. addition,
fam134b mutations common patients colorectal adenocarcinoma, and
oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. mutations expression changes of
fam134b associated biological aggressiveness cancers.
fam134b also plays role allergic rhinitis, vascular dementia, and
identification stem cells. taken together, information available the
literature suggests fam134b plays critical roles human diseases, by
interacting different biological chemical mediators, primarily
regulated er turnover.
