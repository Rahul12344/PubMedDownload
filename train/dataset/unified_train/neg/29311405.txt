introduction: host lipid metabolism influences viral replication lifecycle of
hepatitis c virus. aim evaluate changes glucose lipid
metabolism patients chronic hepatitis c therapy direct acting 
antivirals (daa).
material methods: considered patients consecutively treated between
january november 2015 recording clinical data baseline week 24 of
follow-up. frozen serum samples used apolipoprotein a1 (apoa1),
apolipoprotein b (apob) lipoprotein (a) [lp(a)]. wilcoxon test utilized
to estimate trends logistic regression predictors lipid changes.
results: enrolled 100 patients, mostly cirrhotic (81%) genotype 1b
(59%). ninety-three patients achieved sustained virological response (svr), while
7 relapsed. homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance declined (from 3
to 2.7, p &lt; 0.001); non-high density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol increased
from 102 ± 29 116 ± 35 (p &lt; 0.001), lp(a) 5.6 ± 6.5 9.8 ± 11.5 
mg/dl (p &lt; 0.001). rise low-density lipoprotein/hdl apob/apoa1 ratio
were registered (from 1.79 ± 1.10 2.08 ± 1.05 0.48 ± 0.18 0.53 ±
0.18 mg/dl, p &lt; 0.001). conducted subanalysis patients relapse.
in subgroup, change lipid profile recorded. multivariate
analysis emerged addition ribavirin daa, represented an
independent predictor increased lp(a) (or 3.982, 95% ci 1.206-13.144, p =
0.023).
conclusion: daa therapy led reduction insulin resistance. contrast,
pro-atherogenic lipid changes observed patients svr. studies
will necessary evaluate cardiovascular balance amelioration 
glucose metabolism negative changes lipid profile.
