fibrin glue produced zlb central laboratory, bern, consisting 4
different in-process samples (taken first second precipitation
step, lyophilization, dry-heat treatment) studied vitro. focused
our attention effect anti-viral treatment lyophilized
product dry heat 1 h 100 degrees c. slight reduction maximal
turbidity heat-treated samples observed clotting assay
compared nontreated samples. treatment dry heat result in
generation fibrinogen fragments might accelerate
tissue-plasminogen-activator (t-pa)-enhanced plasminogen plasmin conversion.
the time course fibrin cross-linking factor xiii showed differences
between heated unheated samples. result indicates exposure the
fibrinogen component severe heat neither reduced activity factor xiiia 
affected correct alignment cross-linking sites polymerized fibrin.
incubation fibrinogen thrombin, plasminogen, t-pa resulted a
slightly enhanced degradation fibrin derived heat-treated samples.
the amount residual moisture, determined within range 0.6-2.1%
before heat treatment, influence clotting, cross-linking, and
fibrinolysis parameters. conclusion, virus inactivation treatment dry
heat 1 h 100 degrees c induces significant alterations vitro
