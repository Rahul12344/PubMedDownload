most peripheral t-cell lymphomas (ptcl) express alphabeta t-cell receptor
(tcr) whereas rare ptcl express gammadelta tcr. gammadelta
ptcl extranodal lymphomas among them, hepatosplenic gammadelta ptcl
constitute distinct clinicopathological entity. besides alphabeta and
gammadelta ptcl, recently recognized group extranodal, mainly nasal
tumours, display, instances, phenotypic genotypic features of
natural-killer cell non-hodgkin's lymphomas (nk-nhl). cytotoxic cells, including 
nk cells cytotoxic alphabeta gammadelta lymphocytes may induce lysis of
the target using granule-associated cytotoxic proteins t-cell
intracellular antigen-1 (tia-1), perforin granzyme b. expression tia-1 can
be detected cytotoxic cells whereas granzyme b perforin expression can
be detected high levels activated cytotoxic cells. recently, several
studies showed expression cytotoxic proteins tumour cells of
ptcl nk-nhl associated a) extranodal site clinicopathological
presentation b) nk tgammadelta-cell phenotype c) cd30 expression cutaneous 
t-cell lymphoproliferations d) anaplastic morphology nodal ptcl. this
latter finding contrasts data rare hodgkin lymphomas (hl)
express cytotoxic proteins hodgkin reed-sternberg cells. altogether the
data literature indicate extranodal nk-nhl activated
cytotoxic lymphomas notable exception hepatosplenic gammadelta ptcl
which represent tumours non-activated cytotoxic cells. basis, is
suggested expression cytotoxic proteins may useful the
identification classification extranodal nk-cell lymphomas and, to
some extent, differential diagnosis hl cd30+ anaplastic large
cell lymphomas. cytotoxic lymphomas preferentially localized extranodal
sites skin, lung, upper respiratory gastrointestinal tracts, which
are continuously exposed various antigens. since cytotoxic nk cells 
regarded first line defense sites, cytotoxic tumours such
as nasal lymphomas enteropathy-type intestinal lymphomas associated 
ebv gliadin, respectively, likely chronic antigen exposure may
play role pathogenesis cytotoxic lymphomas occurring mucosa and/or
skin. besides chronic antigenic stimulation, chronic immunosuppression may also
have pathogenetic significance cytotoxic lymphomas view increased 
incidence immunocompromised patients.
