most neural cells constitutively lack major histocompatibility complex (mhc)
class beta 2-microglobulin gene expression. cytokines viruses may,
however, induce expression genes neural cells, this
correlates factor binding nf-kappa b interferon stimulated
response elements genes. here, demonstrate nf-kappa b capable
of inducing mhc class beta 2-microglobulin gene expression transiently
co-transfected chp-126 neuroblastomas, irf-2 represses this
induction. interferon regulatory factor-2 (irf-2) repression mhc class and
beta 2-microglobulin gene expression chp-126 neuroblastomas may demonstrate 
mechanism virus persists neural cells. show irf-2
physically interacts vitro nf-kappa b. interaction may contribute to
the repression expression genes. demonstration irf
family members, addition irf-2, physically interact vitro nf-kappa 
b (p50 p65), provides general mechanism transcription
factors may, concert, regulate expression variety genes involved
in immune responses brain.
