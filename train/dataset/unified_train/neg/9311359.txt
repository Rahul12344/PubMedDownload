objective: determine association human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv) infection stroke among young persons.
design: retrospective case-control study.
setting: large, inner-city public hospital.
participants: patients aged 19 44 years diagnosis stroke, whose 
hiv status determined, admitted january 1990 june 1994. controls
matched age sex selected patients admitted 
same period status asthmaticus whose hiv status known.
main outcome measure: associations hiv infection strokes with
cerebral infarction, adjustment cerebrovascular risk factors,
were evaluated mantel-haenszel stratified analyses. subtypes causes of
stroke hiv-infected patients compared hiv-seronegative patients.
results: hiv infection associated stroke (odds ratio [or], 2.3; 95% 
confidence interval [ci], 1.0-5.3) cerebral infarction (or, 3.4; 95% ci,
1.1-8.9), adjustment cerebrovascular risk factors. among patients
with stroke, cerebral infarction frequent hiv-infected patients 
in hiv-seronegative patients (20 [80%] 25 vs 48 [56%] 88, p = .04). the
frequency cerebral infarctions associated meningitis (p < .001) and
protein deficiency (p = .06) higher hiv-infected patients in
seronegative patients.
conclusions: study suggests hiv infection associated an
increased risk stroke, particularly cerebral infarction young patients.
this risk probably mediated increased susceptibility hiv-infected
patients meningitis protein deficiency.
