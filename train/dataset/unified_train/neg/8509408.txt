the high affinity ige receptor multisubunit complex participates in
ige-dependent activation mast cells basophils. ige-binding portion 
the receptor resides exclusively alpha-subunit specifically within the
180 residues mature extracytoplasmic portion. study contiguous
two-domain human alpha-subunit displayed surface filamentous
bacteriophage form specifically binds human murine ige not
other isotypes. phage display individual immunoglobulin-like domains
reveals ige-binding portion resides exclusively cooh-terminal
domain domain appears bind ige lower affinity the
comparably displayed two-domain fragment. phage display results using chimeric 
rat-human alpha-subunit fragment suggest structural elements within the
nh2-terminal domain necessary impart high affinity ige binding activity to
the alpha-chain ectodomain. two-domain human receptor fragment also
expressed soluble form escherichia coli purified one step by
affinity chromatography. solution binding purified receptor fragment
to ige measured fluorescence quench afforded approximate
equilibrium affinity constant 2 x 10(9) m-1 together stoichiometry 1
receptor molecule/molecule ige. complementary approach phage display
and e. coli expression used study represents useful strategy for
further analysis discrete receptor epitope(s) contribute ige binding
activity.
