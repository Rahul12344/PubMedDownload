we previously reported monoclonal antibody (mab) targeted amyloid beta 
(aß) protein. repeated injection mab reduced accumulation aß
protein brain human aß transgenic mice (tg2576). present study, 
cdna encoding heavy light chains mab subcloned an
adeno-associated virus type 1 (aav) vector 2a/furin adapter. single
intramuscular injection 3.0×10(10) viral genome aav vectors into
c57bl/6 mice generated serum anti-aß ab levels 0.3 mg/ml. anti-aß ab levels
in excess 0.1 mg/ml maintained 64 weeks. effect aav
administration aß levels vivo examined. significant decrease aß
levels brain tg2576 mice treated 5 months (prophylactic) 10
months (therapeutic) age observed. results support use aav
vector encoding anti-aß ab prevention treatment alzheimer's
disease.
