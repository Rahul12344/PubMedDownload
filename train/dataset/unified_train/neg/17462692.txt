a myristate linked n-terminus large hepatitis b virus (hbv)
envelope protein found required infectivity hepatitis delta 
virus (hdv). myristoylation large hbv envelope protein known as
indispensable hbv infectivity, result demonstrates the
similarities hbv hdv entry pathways. addition, transfer of
the n-myristoylation signal large middle small hbv
envelope protein led cases loss hdv infectivity. hence, is
suggested viral entry could depend physical link, spatial
association, n-terminal receptor-binding polypeptide large
protein myristoyl anchor linked glycine-2.
