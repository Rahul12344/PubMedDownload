epitope mapping outer structural protein vp1 three different serotypes 
of foot-and-mouth disease virus.

meloen rh, barteling sj.

all overlapping hexapeptides outer structural protein vp1 type o1, type
a10, type c1 reacted appropriate anti-virus, anti-viral subunit
and anti-vp1 sera. results suggest anti-virus sera may contain
activities viral subunit vp1 well virus. furthermore
the antigenic peptides associated intact virion three serotypes
are found similar locations respective vp1s, produced
neutralizing activities used vaccination. results offer an
explanation often observed cross-reactions serotypes, especially 
at level viral subunit vp1. reliability predictions of
useful peptides hydrophilicity profiles secondary structure predictions 
is questioned. predictions based variation profiles appear useful.
