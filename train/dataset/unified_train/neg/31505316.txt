background: pathogenicity two initially identified human
polyomaviruses (hpyvs), bk virus (bkpyv) jc virus (jcpyv) intensely 
studied, limited data, whether occurrence recently
discovered hpyvs correlates high level bkpyv replication progression
towards polyomavirus associated nephropathy (pvan).
methods: therefore, performed comprehensive longitudinal genoprevalence
analysis 13 hpyvs using novel multiplex assay including 400 serum 388
urine samples obtained 99 kidney transplant recipients (ktrs), grouped by
quantitative bkpyv dna loads evidence manifest bkpyv associated disease
(histologically verified pvan, high urinary decoy cell levels concurrent
decrease renal function).
results: total, 3 different non-bkpyv/jcpyv hpyvs, human polyomavirus 9,
merkel cell polyomavirus (mcpyv) trichodysplasia spinulosa associated
polyomavirus detected 11 blood 21 urine samples 21 patients.
although dnaemia viruses occurred frequently high level
bkpyv dnaemia pvan, increase detection frequency due to
progression bkpyv replication reach statistical significance blood
samples. positive detection rate mcpyv urine, however, was
significantly higher bkpyv dnaemia 19 ktrs cohort suffered
from histologically verified pvan (p = 0.005). one individual pvan,
continuous long-term shedding mcpyv urine observed.
conclusion: cohort recently discovered hpyvs hpyv9, tspyv mcpyv
emerged blood ktrs variable kinetics, detection mcpyv
dnauria occurred frequently bkpyv dnaemia patients pvan.
