in central nervous system, neural stem cells proliferate ventricular
zone (vz) sequentially give rise neurons glial cells a
temporally spatially regulated manner, suggesting stem cells may differ 
from one another different brain regions different developmental
stages. purpose marking purifying neural stem cells ascertain
whether differences exist, generated transgenic mice using promoters from
hes genes (phes1 phes5) drive expression destabilized enhanced green
fluorescent protein. developing brains transgenic mice, gfp
expression restricted undifferentiated cells vz, could
asymmetrically produce numb-positive neuronal daughter gfp-positive
progenitor cell clonal culture, indicating retain capacity to
self-renew. results suggest phes-egfp transgenic mice used to
explore similarities differences among neural stem cells development.
