a 70-year-old man presented clonal large granular lymphocytosis of
t-suppressor/cytotoxic immunophenotype, neutropenia, paraproteinemia, and
proneness infection. patient became severely leukopenic 14 days 
chemotherapy low-dose cyclophosphamide, remained after
discontinuation drug. clinically, thought prolonged
chemotherapy-induced marrow hypoplasia. death, 16 days last dose 
chemotherapy, autopsy confirmed bone marrow hypoplasia revealed that
well-differentiated, polymorphous, (immunophenotypically genotypically)
polyclonal b-lymphocytes predominated normal hematopoietic lymphoid
organs. similar lymphoid infiltrate intimately associated multiple
ulcers smooth muscle necrosis stomach. terminal findings
resemble b-lymphoproliferative conditions described certain forms immune
deficiency.
