plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pdcs) unique dendritic cell subset are
specialized type interferon (ifn) production. pdcs key players the
antiviral immune response serve bridge innate adaptive
immunity. although pdcs represent main reservoir human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv), crucial subset hiv infection 
influence viral transmission, target cell infection antigen presentation.
pdcs act inflammatory immunosuppressive cells, thus contributing hiv
disease progression. review provides state art analysis the
interactions hiv pdcs potential roles hiv transmission, 
chronic immune activation immunosuppression. thorough understanding 
roles pdcs hiv infection help improve therapeutic strategies to
fight hiv infection, increase knowledge important
immune cell subset.
