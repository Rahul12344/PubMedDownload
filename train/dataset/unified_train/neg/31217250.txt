chronic viruses herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) evade hosts' immune
system inducing exhaustion antiviral cells. present study, 
found exhausted hsv-specific cd8+ cells, elevated expression of
programmed death ligand-1 (pd-1) lymphocyte activation gene-3 (lag-3)
receptors frequent symptomatic patients, history numerous
episodes recurrent corneal herpetic disease, compared asymptomatic patients
who never corneal herpetic disease. subsequently, using rabbit model of
recurrent ocular herpes, found combined blockade pd-1 lag-3
pathways antagonist antibodies significantly restored function of
tissue-resident antiviral cd8+ trm cells cornea trigeminal
ganglia (tg). increased number functional tissue-resident hsv-specific cd8+
trm cells latently infected rabbits associated protection against
recurrent herpes infection disease. compared pd-1 lag-3 blockade
alone, combined blockade pd-1 lag-3 appeared synergistic
effect generating frequent polyfunctional ki-67+, ifn-γ+, cd107+, cd8+ t
cells. moreover, using human leukocyte antigen (hla) transgenic rabbit model,
we found dual blockade pd-1 lag-3 reinforced effect a
multiepitope vaccine boosting frequency hsv-1-specific cd8+ trm cells
and reducing disease severity. thus, pd-1 lag-3 exhaustion
pathways play fundamental role ocular herpes cell immunopathology and
provide important immune checkpoint targets combat ocular herpes.importance
hsv-specific tissue-resident memory cd8+ trm cells play critical role in
preventing virus reactivation latently infected tg subsequent virus
shedding tears trigger recurrent corneal herpetic disease. this
report, determined dual blockade pd-1 lag-3 immune checkpoints,
combined vaccination, improved function cd8+ trm cells associated
with significant reduction recurrent ocular herpes hla transgenic (tg)
rabbit model. combined blockade pd-1 lag-3 appeared a
synergistic effect generating frequent polyfunctional cd8+ trm cells that
infiltrated cornea tg. preclinical findings using the
established hla tg rabbit model recurrent herpes highlight blocking
immune checkpoints combined cell-based vaccine would provide an
important strategy combat recurrent ocular herpes clinic.
