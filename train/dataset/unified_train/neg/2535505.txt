in paper demonstrate rna sequences present upstream downstream
of reporter gene coding region play important role determining amount
of protein produced mrna. translational enhancer, omega, derived from
tobacco mosaic virus, present 5'-end beta-glucuronidase mrna
increased efficiency translation 16-fold 18-fold electroporated
tobacco carrot protoplasts, threefold 11-fold maize rice
protoplasts. presence omega alter half-life mrna in
vivo. also demonstrate first time minimum polyadenylated tail
length 25 adenylate residues sufficient substantially increase the
expression half-life reporter mrna plants. vitro-produced
mrnas synthesized extra sequence added 3'-end the
poly(a) tail, however, final level expression decreased 80%.
omega, translational enhancer, poly(a) tail function independently of
each other; combined effect translation, present an
mrna, multiplication individual effects. histochemical analysis
for presence beta-glucuronidase tobacco established virtually 
viable cells receive mrna electroporation. video image analysis tobacco
protoplasts electroporated luciferase mrna demonstrated wide
range level expression marker. carrier rna, present during
electroporation, modest effect increasing mrna uptake. reporter
mrna expression electroporated protoplasts directly proportional the
input mrna least 30 micrograms/ml.
