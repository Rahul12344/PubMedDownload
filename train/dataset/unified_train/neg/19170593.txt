transactivator protein c bacteriophage mu essential transition from
middle late gene expression phage life cycle. unusual,
multistep activation mom promoter (p(mom)) c protein involves
activator-mediated promoter unwinding recruit rna polymerase subsequent
enhanced promoter clearance enzyme. achieve this, c binds site
overlapping -35 region mom promoter high affinity, in
mg(2+)-dependent fashion. mg(2+)-mediated conformational transition c is
necessary dna binding transactivation. determined the
residues c coordinate mg(2+), induce allosteric transition the
protein, required specific interaction dna. residues e26 d40 
the putative metal binding motif (e(26)x(10)d(37)x(2)d(40)) present toward the
n-terminus protein found important mg(2+) ion binding.
mutations residues lead altered mg(2+)-induced conformation,
compromised dna binding, reduced levels transcription activation. although
mg(2+) widely used various dna transaction reactions, report provides 
the first insights importance metal ion-induced allosteric
transitions regulating transcription factor function.
