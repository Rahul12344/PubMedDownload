respiratory diseases.

muldoon rl, mezny l, jackson gg.

the antiviral activity isoprinosine tested tissue cultures mice. in
tissue cultures, concentrations 25 100 mug/ml inhibited infectivity 
influenza herpes hominis viruses parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, 
adenovirus. among different strains influenza a, considerable
variability inhibitory concentration isoprinosine. influenza b, a
zone effect observed inhibitory drug concentration. oral prophylactic 
administration isoprinosine beginning 24 hr infection an
intermediate challenge dose influenza continued treatment 5 days 
produced significant reduction mortality. protection provided against
a high dose challenge. oral intraperitoneal treatment mice beginning 24 hr 
after infection influenza b viruses significantly delayed prevented 
death drug administered 10 days, treatment was
limited 4 days. increased fatality rate occurred treated mice
given virus dose low lethality could attributed drug toxicity.
