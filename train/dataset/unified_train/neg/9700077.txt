cassava vein mosaic virus (csvmv) pararetrovirus infects cassava plants
in brazil. promoter fragment isolated csvmv, comprising nucleotides -443
to +72, previously shown direct strong constitutive gene expression in
transgenic plants. report functional architecture csvmv
promoter fragment. series promoter deletion mutants fused coding
sequence uida reporter gene chimeric genes introduced into
transgenic tobacco plants. promoter activity monitored histochemical and
quantitative assays beta-glucuronidase activity (gus). found the
promoter fragment made different regions confer distinct
tissue-specific expression gene. region encompassing nucleotides -222 
to -173 contains cis elements control promoter expression green tissues
and root tips. results indicate consensus as1 element gata motif
located within region essential promoter expression those
tissues. expression csvmv promoter vascular elements directed by
the region encompassing nucleotides -178 -63. elements located between
nucleotides -149 -63 also required activate promoter expression in
green tissues suggesting combinatorial mode regulation. within latter
region, 43 bp fragment extending nucleotide -141 -99 shown to
interact protein factor extracted nuclei tobacco seedlings. this
fragment showed sequence homology pararetrovirus promoters and
hence may contain csvmv-specific regulatory cis elements.
