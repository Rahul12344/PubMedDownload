using cluster analysis techniques, identified two distinct clusters newly
homeless adolescents los angeles (n = 261): protected 
relatively well home protective risk factors, and
those risky risk protective factors. objective this
study examine trajectories human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) risk 
behaviors exiting homelessness among protected newly homeless adolescents,
compared classified risky. hiv risk behavior included
unprotected sex, multiple sex partners hard drug use. logistic
regression mixed-effects models used evaluate trajectories hiv
risk behaviors exiting homelessness time. adolescents the
protected group reported significantly less unprotected sex ( p = 0.0156), 
abstinent monogamous ( p < 0.0001) less hard drug use ( p < 0.0001)
compared adolescents risky group. addition, protected group 
reported "exiting homelessness", compared risky group ( p = 0.0007). 
however, differences level unprotected sex protected
and risky groups decreased time. findings confirm notion newly 
homeless adolescents indeed heterogeneous. given risk behavior
profiles protected group merges risky group time, findings
underscore need mount tailored interventions designed the
protected group early process.
