objective: although many hiv-infected (hiv+) hiv-exposed uninfected (heu)
infants received live rotavirus vaccines since recommended universal
administration vaccines infants, limited prospective
information safety immunogenicity either group infants.
design/methods: performed randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled
trial safety immunogenicity oral pentavalent rotavirus vaccine
(rv5) administered hiv+ heu infants four african countries.
ninety-three percent hiv+ infants receiving antiretroviral therapy prior 
to vaccination. participants followed safety. immune responses were
measured 14 days three doses rv5, including serum antirotavirus
neutralizing iga antibodies, iga antibody stool, antirotavirus memory 
b t-cell fluorospot. shedding rv5 stool monitored.
results: total 76 hiv+ 126 heu infants enrolled 2009 2013. 
no significant differences found adverse event rates, including grade 3
events, rv5 placebo recipients, either hiv+ heu infants. the
proportion antirotavirus iga responders (at least three-fold increase from
baseline) rv5 administration 81% hiv+ heu infants, which
was approximately 2.5-fold higher placebo recipients (p < 0.001).
neutralizing antibody responses three five serotypes significantly
higher rv5 regardless hiv status, hiv+ infants equal
or greater responses heu infants five serotypes. one hiv+ rv5
recipient rv5 isolated stool.
conclusion: rv5 immunogenic hiv+ heu infants safety
signals observed.
