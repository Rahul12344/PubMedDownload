primary combined hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) neuroendocrine carcinoma a
rare entity, hypercalcemia due ectopic parathyroid hormone (pth)
secretion tumor. 44-year old man hepatitis b virus associated chronic
liver disease presented hepatic mass. hemihepatectomy discovered mass 
as combined hcc poorly differentiated cholangiocarcinoma. adjuvant
chemoradiation therapy, presented nausea, multiple systemic
metastases found. laboratory tests revealed hypercalcemia markedly
elevated pth neuron specific enolase. parathyroid scan showed normal uptake
in parathyroid glands, suggestive ectopic pth secretion. subsequently,
immunohistochemistry neuroendocrine marker performed primary
lesion, confirmed neuroendocrine differentiation non-hcc component.
the patient died 71 days surgery. report may suggest possibility
of ectopic pth secretion neuroendocrine carcinoma hepatic origin causing
hypercalcemia. caution neuroendocrine differentiation exercised
when diagnosing poorly differentiated hcc.
