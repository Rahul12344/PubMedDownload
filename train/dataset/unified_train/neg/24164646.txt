a key stage hiv-1 maturation toward infectious virion requires sequential
proteolytic cleavage gag polyprotein leading formation conical
capsid core encloses viral rna genome small complement of
proteins. final step process involves severing sp1 peptide from
the ca-sp1 maturation intermediate, triggers condensation ca
protein capsid shell. details overall mechanism, including
the conformation sp1 peptide ca-sp1, still intense debate. in
this report, examine tubular assemblies ca ca-sp1 maturation
intermediate using magic angle spinning (mas) nmr spectroscopy. magnetic
fields 19.9 above, outstanding quality 2d 3d mas nmr spectra were
obtained tubular ca ca-sp1 assemblies, permitting resonance assignments
for subsequent detailed structural characterization. dipolar- scalar-based
correlation experiments unequivocally indicate sp1 peptide random
coil conformation mobile assembled ca-sp1. analysis two ca protein 
sequence variants reveals that, unexpectedly, conformations sp1 tail, 
the functionally important cypa loop, loop preceding helix 8 are
modulated residue variations distal sites. findings provide support
for role sp1 trigger disassembly immature ca capsid for
its subsequent de novo reassembly mature cores establish importance 
of sequence-dependent conformational plasticity ca assembly.
