antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (adcc) potentially effective
adaptive immune response hiv infection. however, little understood about
the role adcc controlling chronic infection small number of
long-term slow-progressors (ltsp) maintain relatively normal immunological 
state prolonged periods time. analysed hiv-specific adcc responses in
sera 139 hiv(+) subjects antiretroviral therapy. sixty-five subjects 
were ltsp, maintained cd4 t-cell count > 500/μl 8 years after
infection without antiretroviral therapy 74 non-ltsp individuals. the
adcc responses measured using natural killer cell activation assay to
overlapping hiv peptides allowed us map adcc epitopes. found that
although magnitude adcc responses ltsp cohort higher and
did correlate cd4 t-cell depletion rates, ltsp cohort had
significantly broader adcc responses compared non-ltsp cohort.
specifically, regulatory/accessory hiv-1 proteins targeted frequently
by ltsp. indeed, three particular adcc epitopes within vpu protein hiv
were recognized ltsp individuals. study provides evidence that
broader adcc responses may play role long-term control hiv progression
and suggests novel vaccine targets.
