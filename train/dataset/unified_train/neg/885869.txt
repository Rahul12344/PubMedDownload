in vitro synthesis dna probe antisense globin sequences.

orkin sh.

a dna probe specific sequences complementary globin rna prepared 
in vitro globin complementary dna (cdna). globin cdna used the
template synthesis complementary strand (ccdna) avian
myeloblastosis virus dna polymerase. treatment single strand-specific 
s1 nuclease, double-stranded globin dna denatured presence vast
excess globin rna. hybridization cdna globin rna, ccdna 
was isolated hydroxyapatite chromatography. ccdna probe hybridized
efficiently globin cdna, globin rna. probe prove
useful assessing asymmetry gene expression cell-free transcriptional
systems.
