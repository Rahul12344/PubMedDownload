in study, developed composite chitosan beads combining various metal
ions, including ni(2+), cu(2+), zn(2+), fe(2+), direct adsorption of
enterovirus 71 (ev71). metal-ion species significant effects the
adsorption capacity beads. among metal ion-composite chitosan beads,
ni(2+)-chitosan beads exhibited best adsorption capacity ev71. using a
concentration 0.01-m ni(2+) found best provide bead formation and
ev71 adsorption. adsorption ev71 ni(2+)-chitosan beads neutral or
alkaline ph favored. competitive condition albumin proteins,
ni(2+)-chitosan beads exhibited significant capacity ev71 adsorption in
culture media. adsorption ev71 ni(2+)-chitosan beads attributed
to strong binding ni(2+) ions chelated surface amino acid of
ev71 capsids ni(2+) ions chelated chitosan materials. moreover, the
adsorbed ev71 retained antigenicity infectivity desorption. the
ni(2+)-chitosan beads exhibit promising application ev71 adsorption and
removal.
