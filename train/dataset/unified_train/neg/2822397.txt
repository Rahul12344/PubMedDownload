to evaluate non-marketed research prototype solid-phase enzyme immunoassay
for detection herpes simplex virus genital lesions, 154 clinical specimens 
were collected 127 men 27 women symptoms suggestive herpes
simplex virus infection (erythema, vesicles, ulcers crustae). samples
were tested using assay cultures four monolayers human embryonic
lung fibroblasts vero cells. culture used reference method,
sensitivity 76.9% specificity 100% (prevalence 42.4%). comparison of
results patient group showed sensitivity highest material from
patients vesicles ulcers. highest sensitivity obtained in
specimens developed cytopathological effect within 48 h specimens 
with three four positive cell cultures. findings suggest assay 
is successful specimens high virus titres. enzyme immunoassay
was found rapid, moderately sensitive, highly specific test detection
of herpes simplex virus genital lesions, usefulness assay 
limited culture methods preferred.
