porcine circovirus 2 (pcv2), causative agent postweaning multisystemic
wasting syndrome (pmws), detected north american european wild
boars prevalences arguing high circulation rates among populations.
systematic data qualitative distribution pcv2 infections pcvd
(pcv2 diseases) wild boars rare, however, quantitative data about
viral loads missing. able judge pcv2/pcvd situation wild
boars, evaluation nationwide qualitative quantitative distribution 
pcv2 pcvd germany objective present study. wild boar
samples compared domestic pig samples greater areas,
including tonsils, lungs, spleen, lnn. bronchiales lnn. mesenterici 349
wild boars 348 domestic pigs. wild boars 308 domestic
pigs apparently free pcvd, 40 domestic pigs rejected
from slaughter due health problems (i.e. wasting). tissues examined by
pathohistology, immunohistology (ihc), nested pcr (npcr quantitative pcr
(qpcr). one wild boar (0.3%) 8.7% domestic pigs classified as
pcvd-affected, based pathohistology ihc. pcv2 dna detected 63.1%
and 45.4% wild boars npcr qpcr, respectively, 100% 98.8%
of domestic pigs. pcv2 loads differed significantly wild boars
(average: 10(2.8) pcv2 genomes/microg extracted sample dna) domestic pigs
(average: 10(4.2) pcv2 genomes/microg sample dna). qualitative detection
of pcv2 dna tissues wild boars domestic pigs abundant of
any pathological relevance. overall load pcv2 domestic pigs was
relatively high borderline respect pcvd, difference 
between apparently healthy pigs pigs rejected slaughter respect.
most wild boars infected pcv2 loads less relevant pcvd.
