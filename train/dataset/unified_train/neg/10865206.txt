osteoclast formation hemopoietic precursors induced trance (also
called rankl, odf, opgl), membrane-bound ligand expressed bone marrow
stromal cells. soluble recombinant trance suboptimal
osteoclastogenic stimulus, eliminate need dependence on
stromal cells, membrane-bound trance expressed hematopoietic precursors
using retroviral gene transfer. four trance-expressing osteoclast cell lines were
established continuously generate large numbers multinucleated cells 
express tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase calcitonin receptors. the
multinuclear cells long-lived either fuse continuously other
and mononuclear cells form enormous syncytia, separate form
daughter multinuclear cells. formed bone, plastic, the
majority multinuclear cells develop actin rings bone, resorb bone,
suggesting bone matrix may provide additional signals facilitate
osteoclastic functional maturation. surprisingly, multinuclear cells originate
from fusion proliferating mononuclear cells strongly express mature
macrophage markers f4/80 fc receptor, expressed osteoclasts.
these results indicate osteoclasts derived f4/80-positive fc
receptor-positive cells, trance induces osteoclastic differentiation
partly suppressing macrophage phenotype.
