adoptive transfer cells engineered express hepatitis b virus-specific
(hbv-specific) cell receptor (tcr) may supplement hbv-specific immune responses
in chronic hbv patients facilitate hbv control. however, risk of
triggering unrestrained proliferation permanently engineered cells raises
safety concerns hampered testing approach patients. aim 
of present study generate cells transiently express
hbv-specific tcrs using mrna electroporation assess antiviral and
pathogenetic activity vitro hbv-infected human liver chimeric mice. 
assessed virological gene-expression changes using quantitative
reverse-transcriptase pcr (qrt-pcr), immunofluorescence, luminex technology. 
hbv-specific cells lysed hbv-producing hepatoma cells vitro. vivo, 3
injections hbv-specific cells caused progressive viremia reduction within 12
days treatment animals reconstituted haplotype-matched hepatocytes,
whereas viremia remained stable mice receiving irrelevant cells redirected
toward hepatitis c virus-specific tcrs. notably, increases alanine
aminotransferase levels, apoptotic markers, human inflammatory cytokines
returned pretreatment levels within 9 days last injection. cell
transfer trigger inflammation uninfected mice. data support 
feasibility using mrna electroporation engineer hbv tcr-redirected cells 
in patients chronic hbv infection.
