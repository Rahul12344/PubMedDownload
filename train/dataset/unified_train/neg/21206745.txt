background: recent studies shown high expression levels class i
histone deacetylases (hdacs) correlate malignant phenotype poor
prognosis human tumors. however, expression patterns prognostic
role class hdac isoforms hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) remain unclear.
methodology/principal findings: expression patterns clinical significance
of class hdac isoforms assessed immunohistochemistry cohort 43 
hepatitis b virus-associated hcc patients treated liver transplantation. 
addition, effects hdac inhibition hcc cell behavior investigated
by knockdown hdac isoform short interfering rna. class hdacs were
highly expressed subset hccs positivity hdac1 51.2%, hdac2 in
48.8%, hdac3 32.6% cases. expression levels hdac isoforms were
significantly associated proliferation index hcc. kaplan-meier curves
showed high expression level hdac2 hdac3 implicated significantly
reduced recurrence-free survival. cox proportional hazards model analysis
revealed hdac3 overexpression unfavorable independent prognostic factor
(p = 0.002; hr 3.907). vitro, inhibition hdac2 hdac3, hdac1,
suppressed proliferation invasiveness liver cancer cells.
conclusions/significance: findings demonstrate hdac3 plays significant
role regulating tumor cell proliferation invasion, could served 
as candidate biomarker predicting recurrence hepatitis b
virus-associated hcc following liver transplantation potential therapeutic 
target.
