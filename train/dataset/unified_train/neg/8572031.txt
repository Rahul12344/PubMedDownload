objective: retrospective study designed determine incidence of
b19 associated idiopathic nonimmune hydrops fetalis use sensitive
molecular tool, polymerase chain reaction assay.
study design: placental fetal tissues 57 cases nonimmune hydrops
fetalis analyzed b19 deoxyribonucleic acid. thirty-four cases
were classified idiopathic. remaining 23 cases known,
noninfectious-based causes.
results: eighteen percent cases (6/34) idiopathic nonimmune hydrops
fetalis contained b19 deoxyribonucleic acid. contrast, none 23 cases of
known, noninfectious-based nonimmune hydrops fetalis examined contained b19
deoxyribonucleic acid. presence virus confirmed six
cases either b19-specific deoxyribonucleic acid situ hybridization or
immunocytochemistry. however, histologic examination unsuccessful at
detecting characteristic viral-like inclusions one third cases.
conclusion: eighteen percent cases idiopathic nonimmune hydrops fetalis
contained b19 deoxyribonucleic acid. significant finding demonstrates the
usefulness polymerase chain reaction aid differential diagnosis of
this disease.
