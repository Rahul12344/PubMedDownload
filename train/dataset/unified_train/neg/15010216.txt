genome replication transcription riboviruses catalyzed an
rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp). rdrps normally associated other
virus- or/and host-encoded proteins modulate rna polymerization activity and
template specificity. polymerase complex double-stranded dsrna viruses 
a large icosahedral particle (inner core) containing rdrp minor constituent.
in phi6 dsrna bacteriophages cystoviridae family, inner
core composed four virus-specific proteins. these, protein p2, pol
subunit, tentatively identified rdrp sequence comparisons, the
role protein viral rna synthesis studied recently. 
here, overview work pol subunits phi6 related viruses from
the standpoints function, structure evolution.
