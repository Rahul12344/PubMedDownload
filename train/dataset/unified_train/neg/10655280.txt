the vaccination route may influence success immunization against
pathogens. conventional intramuscular (i.m.) application vaccine
containing hepatitis b virus (hbv) surface antigen (hbsag) led protective 
anti-hbs antibody levels majority vaccine recipients. study, we
vaccinated healthy volunteers group i.m. vaccine nonresponders via the
intradermal (i.d.) route analyzed hbv-specific b-cell response well as
class-ii- class-i-restricted t-cell responses (3)h-thymidine uptake,
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) enzyme-linked immunospot assay
(elispot). results compared i.m. vaccinated controls. i.d.
vaccinations well tolerated induced neutralizing anti-hbs antibodies 
all naive vaccine recipients and, importantly, one former i.m.
nonresponder developed protective anti-hbs serum antibody levels 2 3
i.d. immunizations. cellular level, i.d. vaccine recipients showed
significantly higher anti-hbs producing b-cell frequencies vigorous
class-ii-restricted t-helper (th) cell responses i.m. controls. however,
although hbsag-specific cells characterized cytokine release 
as th1-like cells groups, human leukocyte antigen (hla)-a2+ individuals
who received soluble hbsag via i.d. route developed higher
peptide-specific cytotoxic cd8+ cell precursor (ctlp) frequencies. in
conclusion, i.d. hbsag vaccination effective even former i.m. vaccine 
nonresponders respect antibody induction specific b- t-cell
responses. induction virus-specific ctlp may provide rationale to
study i.d. hbsag vaccine treatment chronic hepatitis b.
