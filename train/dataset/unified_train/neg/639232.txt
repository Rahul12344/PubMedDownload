an ultrastructural basis electrocardiographic alterations associated with
duchenne's progressive muscular dystrophy.

sanyal sk, johnson ww, thapar mk, pitner se.

electrocardiographic abnormalities identified 63 (84%) 75 patients
with duchenne's progressive muscular dystrophy. tall r wave v1 an
abnormal r/s ratio seen 64% patients, deep narrow q wave
greater 4 mm leads i, v5, v6 44%, sinus tachycardia 32% and
right axis deviation 16%. ecg abnormalities included abnormal pv1
index 14% patients short p-r interval 6%. ultrastructural
characteristics heart determined two patients characteristic
electrocardiographic abnormalities. common hearts total loss of
thick well thin myofilaments, gave "moth-eaten" appearance the
myofiber. feature, combined preservation transverse tubular
system, formed characteristic ultrastructural finding seen 
consistently posterobasal area left ventricle. alterations of
z-band material; accumulation mitochondria, occasionally containing
electron-dense bodies showing loss discontinuity cristae; dilatation of
sarcoplasmic reticulum striking ectasia cisternae; depletion glycogen 
particles; paucity lipoid lipochrome granules; absence of
virus-like particles consistent ultrastructural features. comparison
of skeletal cardiac muscle disclosed identical subcellular changes. these
observations support contention distinctive ecg pattern associated
with duchenne's dystrophy results multifocal degenerative changes involving 
myocardium, predominantly posterobasal region left ventricle the
posterior papillary muscle.
