in present experiments, two groups balb/c mice (five individuals each
group) hyperimmunized four consecutive immunizations either bk 
virus (group 1) bk dsdna complexed methylated bsa (group 2). immune
sera taken fourth immunization groups reacted strongly with
polyomavirus bk dsdna well calf thymus dsdna, sera contained
antibodies bound crithidia luciliae assay. indicates that
polyomavirus bk able induce antibodies binding characteristics
similar sle anti-dna antibodies. characterize induced
anti-dna responses, 10 monoclonal anti-dna antibodies (four group 1, six
from group 2) generated selected reactivity s1-nuclease
digested ct dsdna. specificity bk ct dsdna molecules, well as
their light heavy chain variable region cdna nucleotide sequences were
analysed compare known sle derived anti-dna antibodies. the
10 antibodies bound strongly bk dsdna, seven also bound ct dsdna in
competitive elisa experiments. v-region analysis revealed induced
antibodies resembled anti-dna antibodies characteristic murine sle, all
but one contained arginine vh cdr3 region. arginines present the
monoclonal antibodies originated either rf shift rf1-->rf3 the
d-genes n-sequence additions. taken together, data demonstrate that
anti-dna antibodies response hyperimmunization polyomavirus bk have
the characteristics occurring spontaneously sle. virus
infection/replication vivo implies expression immunogenic (non-self)
dna-binding proteins may render dna immunogenic, present results may
therefore suggest one physiological mechanism production sle-related
anti-dna antibodies.
