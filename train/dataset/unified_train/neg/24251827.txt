cationic nanoparticles (nps) cell-penetrating peptides (cpps) enter cells
in energy-independent fashion, escaping traditional endocytosis route,
which known direct translocation. unconventional entry, usually
complementary endocytosis, features rapid uptake thus makes cationic 
nps cpps fascinating intracellular delivery agents. however, mechanisms
of direct translocation cationic nps cpps across cell membranes
into cytosol understood. moreover, relationship direct
translocation endocytosis also unclear. here, using coarse-grained
molecular dynamics simulations show model cell membrane generates a
nanoscale hole assist spontaneous translocation cationic gold
nanoparticles (aunps) well hiv-1 tat peptides cytoplasm side a
transmembrane (tm) potential. translocation, aunps/tat peptides move
freely "cytoplasm" region membrane reseals within a
microsecond, tm potential strongly diminished. furthermore, show 
that shape cationic object crucial determining can
translocate across. results provide insights uptake kinetics 
of cationic nps/cpps, features relationship direction
translocation endocytosis. mechanism put forward establishes
fundamental principles intracellular delivery cationic nanocarriers.
