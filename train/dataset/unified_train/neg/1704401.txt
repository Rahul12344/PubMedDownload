the induction memory immune response hiv, mediated kind of
effector mechanism, requires induction cell help. previous studies
performed different murine mhc haplotypes, three immunodominant cell
epitopes (t1, t2, th4.1) identified hiv envelope
glycoprotein. moreover, peptides proliferative cell epitopes in
humans. study, rhesus monkeys, macaca mulatta, primed these
three peptides either combination given separately. half monkeys had
a proliferative response one priming peptide(s). monkeys 
who cell proliferative response also high antibody response after
one boost suboptimal dose native protein gp 160, whereas three of
four control monkeys received native protein immunization gave
no detectable antibody response, one displayed weak response. for
reasons unclear, antibodies gp41 portion gp 160 could 
detected sera. thus, peptides prime th cells primates an
enhanced antibody response first exposure whole protein. three
peptides belong highly conserved nonglycosylated regions envelope
protein. fact peptides acted immunogenic cell proliferative and
helper epitopes nonhuman primates encouraging including in
future vaccine studies humans.
