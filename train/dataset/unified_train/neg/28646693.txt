objective: enterococcus faecalis gram-positive facultative anaerobic
bacterium, present 30-89% teeth postendodontic treatment
failures. e. faecalis capable penetrating dentinal tubules surviving as
a monoculture conventional endodontic therapy, indicating is
resistant commonly used endodontic disinfection protocols. different e.
faecalis strains shown resistance several antibiotics, been
associated dental pathology systemic infections. aim this
study evaluate efficacy genetically engineered bacteriophage to
disinfect dentin infected antibiotic resistant strains e. faecalis.
methods: extracted human dentin root segments cemented sealable
two-chamber devices, fabricated syringe needle caps form vitro
infected-dentin models. models inoculated overnight suspension
of either e. faecalis v583 (vancomycin resistant strain) e. faecalis jh2-2
(fusidic acid rifampin resistant, vancomycin sensitive strain). 7days
of incubation 37°c, suspension genetically engineered phage,
ϕef11/ϕfl1c(δ36)pnisa, added root canal infected dentin
segment, incubation continued additional 72-h. dentin was
harvested walls root canal assayed residual titer of
e. faecalis cells.
results: recovered e. faecalis titer reduced 18% jh2-2
infected models, 99% v583 infected models.
conclusion: treatment: e. faecalis-infected dentin bacteriophage
ϕef11/ϕfl1c(δ36)pnisa consistently resulted decrease residual
bacterial population vancomycin-sensitive resistant strains.
