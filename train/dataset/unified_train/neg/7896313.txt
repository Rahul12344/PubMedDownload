structural polypeptides ivri vaccine strain two field isoaltes fowlpox 
virus (bareilly isolate panchmahal isolate) analysed sds-page 
immunoblotting technique. 5%-20% gradient acrylamide gel 31, 29 31
polypeptide bands 7.5%-15% gradient gel 45, 37 39 polypeptide bands
were detected coomassie blue staining respectively bareilly isolate,
panchmahal isolate ivri vaccine strain. molecular weight (mw) the
polypeptides ranged 226.10 10.30 kda total mw 2650.12, 2259.50,
and 2378.68 kda respectively three viruses. immunoblot revealed 35,
29 30 immunogenic polypeptides indicating virion polypeptides be
immunogenic nature. although polypeptides similar electrophoretic
pattern sds-page immunoblotting, still three viruses could be
differentiated. viruses found antigenically different with
panchmahal isolate lacking polypeptides 81.15, 76.33, 39.30, 37.50 29.35 
kda vaccine strain lacking 76.33, 37.50 29.35 kda polypeptides as
were present bareilly isolate.
