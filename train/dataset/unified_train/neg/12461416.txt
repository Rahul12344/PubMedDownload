objective: investigate association cervical shedding herpes
simplex virus (hsv) hiv-1.
design: cross-sectional study 200 women seropositive hsv-2 and
hiv-1 conducted family planning clinic coast provincial general
hospital, mombasa, kenya.
main outcome measures: quantities hsv dna (types 1 2) hiv-1 rna as
well presence absence hiv-1 proviral dna cervical secretions were
determined compared.
results: significant correlation quantities hsv dna
and hiv-1 rna cervical secretions hsv-shedding women (pearson's r =
0.24, p = 0.05). 10-fold increase quantity cervical hsv dna was
associated 1.35-fold higher cervical hiv-1-rna levels (95% ci 1.00-1.81; p =
0.05), 1.36-fold greater odds detection hiv-1 proviral dna (95% ci
1.05-1.75; p = 0.02).
conclusion: higher levels cervical hsv associated higher levels of
expressed hiv-1 frequent detection hiv-1-infected cells in
cervical secretions. prospective studies needed explore the
association non-ulcerative cervical hsv reactivation hiv-1 shedding. 
such relationship may important implications interventions designed to
slow spread hiv-1.
