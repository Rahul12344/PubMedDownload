agents effective resistant virus, use novel
cellular targets, essential. large studies progress examining 
safety efficacy nrti-sparing regimens, results currently
available. nrtis may lose relevance distant future unless steps are
put place reduce development spread nrti-resistant viruses, 
new nrtis minimal toxicity developed novel resistance
profile. article describes principal nrtis, mechanism action,
and resistance selected toxicities class individual drugs.
