the induction interferon-alpha (ifn-alpha) ifn-beta mrna natural ifn
producing (nip) cells cultures human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(pbmcs), stimulated glutaraldehyde-fixed herpes simplex virus type 1
(hsv)-infected wish cells, studied. protein synthesis inhibitor
cycloheximide (chx) totally prevented appearance ifn-alpha and
ifn-beta mrna, also cultures supplemented conditioned medium (cm)
assumed contain soluble factors necessary ifn induction. however, when
pbmcs preincubated 4 h medium supplemented fetal bovine serum
(fbs) without addition cm, subsequent induction ifn-alpha/beta 
mrna became partially resistant chx. serum-free medium containing
interleukin-3 (il-3) granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(gm-csf), early induction ifn-alpha mrna became resistant chx, and, 
contrast fbs cm supplemented medium, observed also without a
preincubation pbmcs. contrast, il-1, il-2, il-4, il-6, tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), ifn-alpha, ifn-gamma effects. our
results suggests de novo synthesis proteins normally required 
induction ifn-alpha/beta mrna. proteins might cytokines, possibly
csfs, turn also may require protein synthesis actions. in
contrast, actual triggering signal provided hsv-inducer independent
of protein synthesis.
