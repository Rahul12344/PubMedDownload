eukaryotic initiation factor 5a (eif-5a) cellular protein known to
contain unusual amino acid hypusine. exact vivo function eif-5a,
however, date unknown. finding eif-5a essential cofactor 
the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) rev rna transport factor
suggested eif-5a part specific nuclear export pathway. study
we used indirect immunofluorescence immunogold electron microscopy to
demonstrate eif-5a accumulates nuclear pore-associated intranuclear
filaments mammalian cells xenopus oocytes. able show eif-5a
interacts general nuclear export receptor, crm1. furthermore,
microinjection studies somatic cells revealed eif-5a transported 
the nucleus cytoplasm, nuclear export blocked by
leptomycin b. data demonstrate eif-5a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle
protein.
