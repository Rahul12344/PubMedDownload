the striped bass (sbr) virus, member recently described aquareoviruses, 
infected, caused cytopathic effects (cpe), replicated mammalian cells. the
virus caused cpe 7 mammalian cell lines investigated. sbr virus
functioned best lower temperatures lower temperatures that
appeared restricting factors growth mammalian cells. 22
degrees c sbr virus grew similar titers chinook salmon embryo
(chse) cells mammalian cells. analysis viral polypeptide rna
synthesis suggests restriction viral growth higher temperatures
occurs adsorption transcription translation viral genes. 
the fact sbr virus grow 37 degrees c implies aquareoviruses 
are unlikely human pathogens.
