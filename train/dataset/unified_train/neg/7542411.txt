dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea) steroid hormone produced adrenal cortex
that serves intermediary sex steroid synthesis. dhea produced in
abundance humans warm-blooded animals. based upon previous
reports demonstrating antiviral immunostimulatory activities dhea 
dhea-sulfate (dheas) sought determine whether introduction these
compounds would affect replication feline immunodeficiency virus (fiv) in
chronically infected cells. cell number, cell viability, cellular dna
synthesis, levels fiv reverse-transcriptase (rt) measured cell
cultures treated various dilutions dhea dheas found the
production fiv rt inhibited dhea levels cellular viability and
dna synthesis affected. concentrations tested dheas not
inhibit fiv replication impact cellular viability proliferation.
