virus infections initiated adsorption virions target cells. this
step mediated viral attachment proteins interact specific
cellular receptors. previously shown alphaherpesvirus
pseudorabies virus (prv) attaches cells way process involves 
viral envelope glycoprotein giii (gc) heparin-like cellular surface moiety 
(t. c. mettenleiter, l. zsak, f. zuckermann, n. sugg, h. kern, t. ben-porat
(1990) j. virol. 64, 278-286). gain insight adsorption prv

mutants analyzed. show attachment wildtype prv target
cells divided three distinct stages: primary adsorption, virus 
cannot removed thorough wash pbs displaced exogenous
heparin defining heparin-sensitive adsorption step. primary adsorption 
0 degrees converts half-time approximately 20 min a
heparin-resistant binding attached virus longer sensitive to
exogenous heparin. presence heparin adsorption process leads to
a heparin-independent basal virus binding cells. analysis null mutants in
six prv glycoproteins confirmed nonessential glycoprotein giii (gc) a
major determinant primary adsorption. presence giii the
essential glycoprotein gp50 (gd) shown critical heparin-resistant
binding. importance gp50 process demonstrated two isogenic
wildtype prv gp50- mutant pairs. similar results obtained mutant 
bovine herpesvirus 1 lacking gd-homologous glycoprotein giv, indicating a
general role gd-homologous proteins stable attachment of
alphaherpesviruses. since gd-homologs also involved penetration they
might link processes viral attachment entry.
