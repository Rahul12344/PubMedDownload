diagnosis basaloid squamous carcinoma (bscc) currently relies mainly on
histological criteria, variable immunohistochemical results reported in
small series. explored use battery immunohistochemical stains to
elucidate diagnosis 45 cases bscc. elucidate the
immunohistochemical profile bscc, explore potential genetic pathways of
malignant transformation using proliferation markers, investigate a
possible link human papillomavirus (hpv). forty-five cases bscc 34
site-matched cases squamous cell carcinoma (scc) obtained the
archives pathology department institution. extensive literature
review undertaken utilizing medline. ber-ep4 useful diagnostic marker
for bscc, positive 82% (37/45) cases 68% (23/34) scc. an
alternative combination cytokeratins ck14 ck7, known be
negative, ck1, known positive, achieves accuracy 73%
(33/45) bscc 88% (30/34) scc. two diagnostic approaches in
agreement 66% cases; methods equally accurate the
divergent cases. increased expression proliferation markers supports the
concept bscc rapidly growing tumor. results p16 stains support an
etiological link bscc hpv; interestingly, hpv present
significantly bscc (71% (32/45)), scc (59% (20/34)) study
(p=0.02).
