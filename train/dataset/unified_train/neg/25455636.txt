merkel cell carcinoma (mcc) rare, malignant primary neuroendocrine cancer of
the skin, usually affecting elderly, white people sun-exposed areas. a
highly aggressive tumor strong propensity metastasize. surgery and
radiation therapy remain mainstay treatment, curative treatment in
case disseminated metastases. 2008, mcc thought caused 
malignant transformation resident merkel cells, investigation a
predominant molecular pathway could involved mcc pathogenesis was
successful. real revolution mcc understanding management occurred in
2008, new human polyomavirus (mcpyv) found main etiological 
agent skin cancer. following discovery mcpyv, association of
mcpyv mcc confirmed worldwide, detection mcpyv 80%
of mccs. time shown mcpyv infection almost
ubiquitous healthy subjects, mcpyv thought persistent resident of
the skin microbiome although route transmission, host cell, viral 
cycle and/or latency remain unknown. studies suggest may two
subtypes mcc: mcpyv-positive (80%) mcpyv-negative (20%) mccs, various 
studies reported better prognosis associated mcpyv infection. the
discovery mcpyv mcc patients opens new therapeutic insights. the
necessity persistence expression mcpyv oncoproteins mcc
development make proteins promising therapeutic targets.
