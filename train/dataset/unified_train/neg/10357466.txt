hiv-1 group epicenter cameroon neighboring countries is
responsible 3 5% hiv infections region. believed that
hiv-1 group introduced human population separate
cross-species transmission, occurring independently hiv-1 (group and
group n) hiv-2 transmissions. studied coreceptor requirements 
12 primary hiv-1 o-type isolates individuals different clinical
symptoms. 2 12 viruses showed syncytium-inducing phenotype 
infection primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were
infectious cell line c8166. isolates used cxcr4 coreceptor
for entry, whereas remaining isolates used ccr5 efficiently. one isolate
was able use bob ccr8 coreceptors addition cxcr4. group o
isolates tested efficiently inhibited sdf-1 rantes, natural
ligands cxcr4 ccr5, respectively. results indicate cxcr4 and
ccr5 principal coreceptors hiv-1 o-type viruses. hiv-1
group isolates studied derived patients later stages the
disease. although hiv-1 group group infections differ their
pathogenesis, studied isolates evolve use broad range of
coreceptors described hiv-1 group hiv-2.
