cytology-based cervical cancer screening restricted lack of
cytologists. thus, hpv-based instead cytology-based screening may more
suitable strategy china. here, assessed effectiveness hpv testing
(cobas® 4800 test, roche) hpv-based programs detect high-grade cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) cancer compared cytology (thinprep,
hologic) cytology-based programs cross-sectional study 11,064
chinese women aged 21-65 years enrolled longyou county zhejiang 
province, china. rates hpv positivity cytology abnormality 9.8%
and 6.1%, respectively. hpv positivity rate two age peaks, 21-24 (15.4%) 
and 60-65 (14.4%) years. according adjusted data, hpv testing demonstrated
significantly higher sensitivity negative predictive value (npv) than
cytology detecting cin2 worse (90.0% vs. 66.7%, 99.9% vs. 99.5%), and
there acceptable specificity (91.3%) positive predictive value (ppv,
12.5%). furthermore, primary hpv testing type 16/18 genotyping showed the
highest sensitivity (78.6%) npv (99.7%) among four screening strategies, 
there similar specificity (96.8%) ppv (23.9%) compared co-testing
screening detect cin2+, fewer colposcopies (4.2) tests
(106.3) performed co-testing primary cytology screening detect a
case high-grade cin. differences effectiveness approximately
similar cin3+ identifying target. findings suggest primary 
hpv testing type 16/18 genotyping higher sensitivity npv,
possesses optimal cost/effectiveness first round screening a
feasible strategy cervical cancer screening chinese women.
