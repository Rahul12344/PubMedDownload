aim: study carried assess presence anti-bluetongue (bt)
antibodies sheep, goat cattle different agro-climatic zones of
jharkhand.
materials methods: serum samples collected apparently healthy as
well suspected sheep, goat cattle different districts jharkhand
covering different agro-climatic zones. serum samples screened indirect
enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ielisa) detecting anti-bt antibodies.
results: total 480 animal serum samples (sheep-190, goats-210 and
cattle-80) screened, 83 (43.68%) sheep, 91 (43.33%) goat 46 (57.50%) of
cattle sera found positive. % positivity ranged 41% 51% in
different agro-climatic zones. results showed slight higher seroprevalence,
although significantly, cattle sheep goats different
agro-climatic zones jharkhand.
conclusions: data indicate widespread prevalence bt virus antibodies
in studied areas. incidence bt detected officially, far. the
present seroprevalence status bt jharkhand indicates presence bt
infection state first time.
