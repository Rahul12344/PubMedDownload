to maximize production progeny virions, several viruses evolved
mechanisms promote selective nuclear export viral mrna transcripts
while, cases, inhibiting export cellular mrnas. achieve this
goal, viruses evolved regulatory proteins cis-acting rna elements that
selectively interact key cellular nuclear export factors. efforts to
identify cellular targets viral proteins rna elements led
to identification crm1 tap essential human nuclear rna-export
factors continue provide insights mrnas selected export
