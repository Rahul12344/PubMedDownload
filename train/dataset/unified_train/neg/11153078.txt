in neurodegenerative diseases associated aids, reactive astrocytosis plays a
central role neurotoxicity brain parenchyma. whereas hiv-1 nef 
gene overexpressed restricted hiv-1 infection human astrocytes, 
previous results demonstrated nef expressed human u251mg glial cells
activates sphingomyelin pathway triggered tnf-alpha, increasing ceramide
production. since ceramide important regulatory molecule programmed cell
death induced tnf-alpha, examined whether nef could alter tnf-alpha-induced
apoptosis u251mg human astrocytoma cell line. transfection studies
indicated nef could prevent apoptosis promote cell proliferation in
response tnf-alpha stimulation. mapk jnk activities analyzed 
in order elucidate signaling cascades subsequent upregulation of
ceramide production. tnf-alpha treatment, kinases shown be
preferentially activated presence nef. experiments strongly
suggest hiv-1 nef protein might modulate sensitivity astrocytes
to inflammatory molecules, thus contributing development of
neurodegenerative diseases associated aids.
