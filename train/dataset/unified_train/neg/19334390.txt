laboratory diagnosis hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection based the
detection anti-hcv antibodies enzyme immunoassay (eia) chemiluminescence
immunoassay (cia) techniques. however, consensus related problem low 
titer (serum/cut-off; s/c= 1.0) anti-hcv antibodies still lacking. study 
was aimed evaluate clinical status patients low titer anti-hcv
antibodies detected third generation anti-hcv tests january
2007-december 2007. two hundred fifteen sera anti-hcv s/c values between
1-5, detected commercial test system (vitros ec immunodiagnostic system, 3rd
generation anti-hcv test, ortho-clinical diagnostics, usa) sensitivity 
100% specificity 99.7%, indicated supplier, included the
study. alanine aminotransferase (alt) aspartate aminotransferase (ast) levels
were determined using chemiluminescence assay (roche diagnostics, germany) and
hcv-rna detected real-time pcr (flurion hcv qnp 2.1). hundred thirty
six (63.3%) patients female 79 (36.7%) male. mean age of
the patients 50.2 +/- 18.9 years. 18 (8.3%) patients alt and/or ast levels
were high two infected hepatitis remaining two 
with hepatitis b virus. hcv-rna positivity (15.6 x 10(6); 4.3 x 10(5) 2.6 x
10(3) iu/ml, respectively) detected three patients (1.4%) s/c values 
of 3.69, 4.46 4.59, respectively. three patients older 50
years, high alt levels chronic renal failure patients undergoing
dialysis least one year. observed 4-6 weeks anti-hcv
titers increased (s/c values 15.1, 6.5 11.8, respectively) serum 
samples patients. data obtained study emphasizes the
problem low titer positive anti-hcv results. could concluded in
case low titer anti-hcv values, result confirmed riba,
although use matter debate due low sensitivity, hcv-rna
tests. based data seemed changing anti-hcv s/c ratio would
not solution problem low titer anti-hcv positive results.
