gene 1 bacteriophage t7 early region--the rna polymerase gene--is very
actively translated infectious cycle phage. 29 base pair
fragment ribosome binding site containing initiation triplet, the
shine-dalgarno sequence (s-d), 10 nucleotides (nt) upstream 6 nt downstream
of central elements cloned vector control expression of
the mouse dihydrofolate reductase gene (dhfr). although essential parts of
this translation initiation region (tir) present, fragment showed 
only low activity. computer analysis revealed potentially inhibitory
hairpin binding s-d sequence stem base paired vector-derived
upstream sequences. mutational alterations demonstrated hairpin not
responsible low activity. however, addition 21 nt t7 gene 1
upstream sequence 29 base pair fragment capable increasing the
translational efficiency one order magnitude. computer analysis this
sequence, including nucleotide shuffling, revealed contains highly
unstructured region lacking mrna secondary structures hairpin its
5' end, formed solely t7 sequences. much difference in
activity whether mrna included lacked vector-derived sequences upstream of
the hairpin. highly unstructured mrna regions found very
efficiently expressed t7 genes without obvious sequence homologies. delta
g values regions higher, i.e. potential secondary structural
elements fewer, tir genes e. coli. likely due the
fact t7 lytic phage relying successful infection much
stronger signals cell cannot afford indispensable balanced
equilibria interdependent biochemical processes. 5' ends of
efficient t7 gene mrna formed action rnase iii generally start
with unstructured region. efficiently expressed t7 genes within a
polycistronic mrna, however, always contain hairpin preceding structure
free sequence. suggest formation 5' hairpin releasing
enough energy keep unstructured regions free secondary rna structures
for sufficient time give ribosomes factors good chance binding to
the tir. addition, sequences downstream start codon give rise
to additional increase efficiency tir almost two orders of
magnitude.
