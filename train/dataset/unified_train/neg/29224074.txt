the emergence high-throughput sequencing technologies deepened our
understanding complex microbial communities greatly facilitated study 
of as-yet uncultured microbes viruses. studies complex microbial
communities require high-quality data generate valid results. here, detail 
current methods microbial viral community sample acquisition, dna
extraction, sample preparation, sequencing illumina high-throughput
platforms. using appropriate analytical tools important, must not
overshadow need establishing proper experimental design obtaining
sufficient numbers samples statistical purposes. researchers must also
take care sample biologically relevant sites control potential
confounding factors (e.g., contamination).
