the human respiratory syncytial virus (hrsv) fusion (f) protein important 
hrsv infection, studies examined genetic diversity f gene
from chinese samples. study, total 330 hrsv f sequences collected
from different regions china 2003 2014 analyzed understand
their genetic characteristics. addition, sequences compared with
1150 hrsv f sequences genbank 18 countries. phylogenetic
analysis, chinese hrsv f sequences sorted number clusters containing
sequences china well countries. f sequences different
genotypes (as determined based g gene sequences) within hrsv subgroup
could found clusters phylogenetic trees generated based f
gene sequences. amino acid analysis showed hrsv f sequences china and
other countries highly conserved. interest, f protein sequences 
chinese samples completely conserved palivizumab binding site, thus
predicting susceptibility strains neutralizing antibody. 
conclusion, hrsv f sequences china 2003 2014, similar those
from countries, highly conserved.
