svehag se.

rabbits injected intravenously single high dose poliovirus (type 1)
produced two major 19s two 75 type neutralizing antibody populations, with
different electrophoretic mobilities. first 2 2(1/2) days after
immunization antibody 19s type migrated single component 
in beta-region. contrast, major 19s antibody synthesized day 3 on
was gamma(1)-globulin. 7s type antibody, appearing day 4, contained only
in gamma(1)-region, 10 14 days following immunization 7s
antibody associated gamma(1)- gamma(2)-globulins. the
electrophoretic distribution antibody 2-week sera revealed presence 
at least four antibody populations (19s beta, 19s gamma(1), 7s gamma(1), 7s
gamma(2)). serum samples collected 1 2 weeks following antigenic stimulation
often contained small amounts antibody sedimented rate (11s 15s)
intermediate 7s 19s antibodies. neutralizing activity the
19s type antibodies intermediately sedimenting antibody destroyed 
incubation 0.1 (5 days) 0.2 (1 day) 2-mercaptoethanol 3 degrees c.
