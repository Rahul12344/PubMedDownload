the ferret commonly used model studies infectious diseases. the
genomic sequence animal model yet characterized, a
limited number fully annotated cdnas currently available genbank. the
majority genes involved innate adaptive immune response still
lacking, restricting molecular genetic analysis host response ferret
model. enable de novo identification transcriptionally active ferret genes 
in response infection, performed de-novo transcriptome sequencing of
animals infected h1n1 a/california/07/2009. also included splenocytes
induced bacterial lipopolysaccharide allow identification of
transcripts specifically induced gram-negative bacteria. pooled and
normalized cdna library order delimit risk sequencing only
highly expressed genes. normalization cdna library removes the
possibility assessing expression changes individual animals, has
been shown increase identification low abundant transcripts. study,
we identified 19,000 partial ferret transcripts, including than
1000 gene orthologs known involved innate adaptive immune
response.
