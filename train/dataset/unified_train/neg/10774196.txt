herpes simplex virus type 1(hsv-1), type 2(hsv-2) varicella-zoster virus
(vzv) belong alphaherpesvirus family. herpesviruses large dna
genomes contain least 69 genes. viral genes divided two
groups based whether essential dispensable virus growth in
cell culture. essential gene products include transcriptional factor, viral
dna replication, dna cleavage/packaging virion components, the
dispensable gene products include deoxyribonucleotides metabolism, protein
kinases, tegument proteins. article briefly reviews functions of
alphaherpesvirus gene products, particularly roles viral encoded protein
kinases, tegument proteins host immune evasion.
