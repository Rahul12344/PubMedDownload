enteric illness contributes significant burden illness canada and
globally. understanding sources critical step identifying and
preventing health risks. expert elicitation powerful tool, used previously, 
to obtain information enteric illness source attribution information 
is difficult expensive obtain. thirty-one experts estimated transmission of
28 pathogens via major transmission routes (foodborne, waterborne, animal
contact, person-to-person, other) point consumption. the
elicitation consisted (snowball) recruitment phase; administration a
pre-survey collect background information, introductory webinar, an
elicitation survey, 1-day discussion, survey readministration, feedback
exercise, surveys administered online. experts prompted quantify
changes contamination point entry kitchen versus point of
consumption. estimates combined via triangular probability distributions,
and medians 90% credible-interval estimates produced. transmission was
attributed primarily food bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens,
cyclospora cayetanensis, trichinella spp., three vibrio spp. categories
explored, yersinia enterocolitica. multisource pathogens (e.g., transmitted
commonly water food) campylobacter spp., four
escherichia coli categories, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., and
staphylococcus aureus also estimated mostly foodborne. water the
primary pathway giardia spp. cryptosporidium spp., person-to-person
transmission dominated six enteric viruses shigella spp. consideration of
the point attribution highlighted importance food handling and
cross-contamination transmission pathway. study provides source
attribution estimates enteric illness canada, considering possible
transmission routes. research necessary improve understanding
of poorly characterized pathogens sapovirus e. coli subgroups in
canada.
