the effect interferon-tau vitro development bovine embryos was
investigated. vitro fertilization, embryos developed morula stage
were cultured 3 days tcm-199 cr1 medium containing bsa fcs
supplemented without recombinant ifn-tau produced baculovirus
expression system. addition baculovirus-expressed ifn-tau (100 ng/ml)
significantly promoted development blastocyst stage culture media.
addition e. coli expressed ifn-tau (2 microg/ml) also significantly promoted
the embryonic development. supplementation bsa fcs affect the
growth-promoting effect ifn-tau. determine whether growth-promoting
effect ifn-tau related interferon type receptors bind type
i interferon ifn-alpha, embryos cultured ifn-alpha. although
ifn-alpha significantly promoted development, much higher concentration (25
microg/ml) required ifn-tau. reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction analysis revealed expression mrna encoded type-i ifn receptor
subunit morula blastocyst stage embryos. overall results suggest a
novel function ifns promoting embryonic development effect may 
related type-i ifn receptor expressed early stages preimplantation
embryos.
