natural infection mouse hepatitis virus (mhv) affect interpretation of
immunological studies mice. mhv, collective term describing group of
corona viruses, found natural infections 70% laboratory mouse
populations u.s.a. canada. natural outbreaks mhv animal
colony afforded us opportunity study mhv-induced immunosuppression well
as effects mhv infection neurotransmitter immunomodulation.
concanavalin (con a)-stimulated dna synthesis spleen lymphocytes from
mhv-infected mice 20-50% non-infected mice. mhv infection also
altered neurotransmitter modulation spleen t-lymphocyte activation. in
contrast noradrenaline ablation con a-activated dna synthesis spleen
lymphocytes non-infected mice, dna synthesis infected group not
inhibited noradrenaline dibutyryl-camp. effects mhv infection were
specific spleen lymphocytes since mhv infection alter con a
stimulation thymocytes, lipopolysaccharide stimulation spleen b
lymphocytes, noradrenaline inhibition thymocyte b-cell dna synthesis.
mhv infection also alter spleen t-lymphocyte subset proportions. thus,
mhv infection inhibits spleen t-lymphocyte activation blocks vitro
catecholamine camp regulation spleen t-cell activation affect
activation thymic cells spleen b cells.
