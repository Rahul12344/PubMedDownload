in broiler breeder flocks one broiler integration hungary, new syndrome
appeared january 2005 initially four successive post-peak flocks
experiencing significant decreases egg production. clinically birds became
depressed small increase mortality rate. postmortem
examinations revealed enlarged livers 19% birds dying, enlarged
spleens some. also observed birds either clotted blood or
serosanguineous fluid abdomen subcapsular haemorrhages liver.
histopathology polymerase chain reaction excluded tumours presence of
common tumour-associated viruses. chronic bacterial infections (especially
causing hepatitis, peritonitis airsacculitis) common many enlarged
livers obvious bacterial involvement. 9-month period 
a majority flocks became affected, newly affected flocks occurred.
investigations showed tested affected flocks seropositive the
big liver spleen (bls) agar gel immunodiffusion test. subsequent flocks
without post-peak egg-production drops shown seronegative bls
agid test, parent flocks contributing affected flocks.
liver samples cloacal swabs positive polymerase chain reaction (ahev 
helicase target), calicivirus-like particles demonstrated bile
samples affected birds. observations similar to
hepatitis-splenomegaly syndrome described north america bls syndrome as
described australia. histopathological features non-specific chronic
hepatitis similar described bls hepatitis-splenomegaly syndrome. 
immunohistochemistry using bls-specific monoclonal antibody confirmed the
presence avian hepatitis e virus antigen livers spleen.
