the relevance autophagy neuronal health extensively reported 
plethora conditions affecting nervous system, neurodegenerative
diseases, cancer, diabetes, tissue injury, altered autophagic activity 
may contribute pathological process. autophagy dynamic pathway
involving formation membrane surrounding enclosing cargoes 
delivered lysosomal compartments degradation. cargoes include large
protein aggregates, organelles, even pathogens. traditionally, autophagy
assessment relies measurement lc3-ii protein levels the
visualization lc3-positive puncta. however, approaches represent a
static measurement autophagy markers, making difficult dissection the
actual changes autophagy process (activation, inhibition, effects), 
due dynamic regulation lc3 viral levels. circumvent limitation,
we previously developed adeno-associated vector (aav) deliver molecular
autophagy sensor neuronal compartment vivo. here, describe the
detailed design methods use engineered aav harboring monomeric
tandem mcherry-gfp-lc3 determine autophagic fluxes nervous system. key 
methodological details succeed use reporter provided.
