hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection associated tremendous morbidity and
mortality due liver complications. hcv infection also associated many 
extrahepatic manifestations including cardiovascular diseases, glucose metabolism
impairment, cryoglobulinemia vasculitis, b cell non-hodgkin lymphoma chronic 
kidney disease (ckd). many studies shown strong association hcv
and ckd, reporting (i) increased prevalence hcv infection patients on
haemodialysis, (ii) increased incidence ckd proteinuria hcv-infected
patients, (iii) development membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
secondary hcv-induced cryoglobulinemia vasculitis. hcv seropositivity found
to associated increased relative risk all-cause cardiovascular
mortality dialysis population. hcv seropositivity linked lower
patient graft survival kidney transplantation. poor hcv-associated
prognosis encouraged clinicians treat hcv ckd patients.
however, due frequent side effects poor efficacy interferon-based
treatments, hcv dialysis patients received hcv medications until
now. emergence new direct acting, interferon-free antiviral treatment,
leading hcv cure cases satisfactory safety profile, will
shortly modify management hcv infection ckd patients. patients 
a glomerular filtration rate (gfr) >30ml/min, choice daa not
restricted. gfr <30 >15ml/min, only
paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir/dasabuvir grazoprevir plus elbasvir
regimen approved. patients end stage renal disease (gfr <15ml/min 
dialysis), current data allows use grazoprevir plus elbasvir
combination. doubt data modified future advent
of new studies including larger cohorts hcv patients renal impairment.
