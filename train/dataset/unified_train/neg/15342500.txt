card reported prokaryotic protein showing structural functional
features typical eukaryotic high-mobility group transcription factors. in
prokaryotes, proteins similar card appear confined primarily to
myxobacteria. myxococcus xanthus, card previously shown act a
positive element two different regulatory networks: one light-induced
synthesis carotenoids starvation-induced fruiting body
formation. tested effect loss-of-function mutation the
card gene (card1) expression random collection lacz-tagged genes, 
which normally expressed dark vegetative growth rich medium.
our results indicate card plays significant role transcriptional
regulation various indicated genes. card1 mutation downregulates some
genes upregulates others. also reported isolation several
mutations suppress strong effect card1 expression a
particular vegetative gene. one (sud-2) also suppresses effect of
card1 vegetative genes fruiting-body formation. thus, card and
the sud-2 gene product appear participate single mechanism, which
underlies various apparently diverse regulatory phenomena ascribed card.
