influenza virus infections occur different species, causing mild severe
respiratory symptoms lead heavy disease burden. eurasian avian-like
swine influenza a(h1n1) viruses (eas-h1n1) predominant pigs and
occasionally infect humans. influenza a(h1n1) virus isolated boy
who suffering fever headache designated as
a/tianjin-baodi/1606/2018(h1n1). full-genome sequencing phylogenetic analysis
revealed a/tianjin-baodi/1606/2018(h1n1) novel reassortant eas-h1n1
containing gene segments eas-h1n1 (ha na), classical swine h1n1(ns) 
a(h1n1)pdm09(pb2, pb2, pa, np m) viruses. isolation analysis of
a/tianjin-baodi/1606/2018(h1) provide evidence eas-h1n1 poses a
threat human health greater attention paid surveillance of
influenza virus infection pigs humans.
