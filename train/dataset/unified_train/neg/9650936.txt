an inherent problem diagnostic pcr assay presence ill-defined
inhibitors amplification may cause false-negative results. addition of
an amplifiable fragment foreign dna pcr serve hybrid internal
control (hic) would allow simple way identify specimens containing
inhibitors. two oligonucleotide hybrid primers synthesized contain
nucleic acid sequences chlamydia pneumoniae 16s rrna primers position
flanking two primers target sequences 650-bp lambda phage dna
segment. using hybrid primers, hybrid dna comprising large sequence of
lambda phage dna flanked short pieces chlamydia dna subsequently
generated pcr, cloned plasmid vector, purified. plasmids containing
the hybrid dna diluted used hic adding c.
pneumoniae pcr test. consequently, c. pneumoniae primers able amplify
both chlamydia dna hic dna. production 689-bp hic dna band an
acrylamide gel indicated specimen contained inhibitors that
internal conditions compatible pcr. subsequently, biotinylated rna
probe hic transcribed nested sequence hic used 
for hybridization. detection hic dna-rna hybrid achieved enzyme
immunoassay (eia). pcr-eia system hic initially tested 12
previously pcr-positive 14 previously pcr-negative specimens. 12
pcr-positive specimens, 11 reconfirmed positive; 1 negative hic
value, indicating inhibition. 14 previously pcr-negative specimens, 13
were confirmed true negative; 1 negative hic value, indicating
inhibition. assay used 237 nasopharyngeal specimens from
patients pneumonia. twenty-one 237 (8.9%) positive c.
pneumoniae, 42 (17.7%) found inhibit pcr. specimens showing
inhibitory activity diluted 1:10 retested. ten specimens still
inhibitory pcr required dna purification. additional
positive samples detected 3 nasopharyngeal specimens remained inhibitory
to pcr. coamplification hic dna help confirm true-negative pcr results
by ruling presence inhibitors dna amplification.
