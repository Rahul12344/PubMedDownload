we report use west nile virus armored rna internal positive
control (ipc) extraction reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) rna
extracted field-collected mosquitoes multiplex real-time taqman
rt-pcr simultaneously detect 3' noncoding region west nile virus and
the west nile virus ns5-2 region comprising ipc. mosquito pools the
province british columbia, canada (n = 635), tested duplicate and
found negative west nile virus positive ipc. known west
nile virus-positive supernatants mosquito pools provinces of
alberta manitoba tested duplicate found positive both
regions west nile virus genome. mean cycle threshold (ct) value for
the ipc batch extraction controls +/- 2 standard deviations found be
36.43 +/- 1.78 cycles. ipcs 98.4% (624) west nile virus-negative pools fell
within range, indicating reproducibility rna extraction rt-pcr
for pools varying mosquito genus number. comparison mosquito pool
genera revealed significant genus effect ct value ipc. the
incorporation west nile virus armored rna ipc allows monitoring rna
extraction rt-pcr detection false-negative results due failures 
these processes pcr inhibition, respectively.
