neural stem cells (nscs) respond inflammatory cues induced brain injury
and thought involved recovery brain damage. little known
about nsc response brain infections. present study evaluated nsc
proliferation herpes simplex virus-1 brain infection. total numbers of
nestin(+) nscs increased significantly infected brains 6 days post
infection (p.i.). however, 15 days p.i. nestin(+) population decreased
significantly levels observed uninfected brains remained depressed
through 30 days p.i. initial increase nsc population occurred
concurrently increased brain cell proliferation, peaked 3 days p.i.
on closer examination, found actively proliferating sox2(+) nscs
increased number 6 days p.i., proliferating dcx(+) neuroblasts contributed 
to increased response 3 days p.i. however, overall proliferation decreased
steadily 15 days p.i. control levels. determine mechanisms
involved altering nsc proliferation, neurotrophin growth factor expression
profiles assessed. fgf-2 gene expression increased 5 days p.i. was
robustly down-regulated 15 days p.i. (>1000-fold), confirmed
by increased fgf-2 immunostaining around lateral ventricles. furthermore,
supplementing infected animals recombinant fgf-2, 15 days p.i.,
significantly increased number proliferating brain cells. findings
demonstrate temporal changes nsc proliferation mediated through
the regulation fgf-2 nsc niche may benefit supplementation
with fgf-2 hsv-1 brain infection.
