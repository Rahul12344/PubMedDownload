responsiveness human cells trisomic chromosome 21 antiviral action 
of human immune interferon.

de ley m, billiau a.

seven human diploid cell strains (three disomic four trisomic chromosome 
21) tested sensitivity preparations three types human
interferon (ifn). relative disomic control strains, trisomic-21 cells 
strains found sensitive leukocyte (huifn-alpha) to
fibroblast ifn (huifn-beta). chromosome 21-controlled increase in
sensitivity huifn-alpha -beta, always accompanied parallel
increase sensitivity huifn-gamma. fact, d21/t21 comparisons 
sensitivity huifn-gamma huifn-alpha -beta diverged, suggesting
that cellular receptor site(s) different ifn types may different. 
the presence high concentration (greater 2%) bovine serum the
culture medium inhibited responsiveness cells huifn-gamma not
to huifn-alpha huifn-beta.
