mice immunized plasmid dna encoding nef regulatory protein human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 developed high levels anti-nef antibodies. after
4 intramuscular injections 100 microg plasmid dna, anti-nef antibodies reached
titers 2 x 10(4). significant specific antibody response maintained
for least 16 months. using set seven 31-66 mer synthetic peptides
covering entire sequence nef, analysed specificity ant-nef
antibodies. interestingly, specific antibodies produced response nef
expressing plasmid dna recognize linear peptides except long
c-terminal peptide (aa 141-205) 3 10 sera. anti-nef antibodies
produced mice immunized protein nef without adjuvant, same
restraint epitope binding found. 3 5 nef positive sera reacted
with c-terminal peptide. suggests specific antibodies induced by
plasmid dna well non-denatured protein recognize
conformation-dependent epitopes. contrary, anti-nef antibodies mice
immunized protein freund's adjuvant showed broader epitope
reactivity pattern. interestingly, analysis immunoglobulin isotype
profiles antibodies generated different protocols immunization
showed plasmid dna immunization induced predominantly igg2a, whereas
immunization nef protein, without adjuvant, yielded preponderance 
of igg1 antibodies.
