phage holins endolysins long known play key roles lysis of
the host cell, disrupting cytoplasmic membrane peptidoglycan (pg) layer, 
respectively. phages gram-negative hosts, third class proteins, the
spanins, involved disrupting outer membrane (om). rz rz1, the
components lambda spanin, are, respectively, class ii inner membrane
protein om lipoprotein, thought span entire periplasm virtue
of c-terminal interactions soluble domains. here, periplasmic
domains rz rz1 purified shown form dimeric monomeric 
species, respectively, solution. circular dichroism analysis indicates rz
has significant alpha-helical character, much less predicted, whereas
rz1, 25% proline, unstructured. mixture two proteins leads 
complex formation increase secondary structure, especially
alpha-helical content. moreover, transmission electron-microscopy reveals that
rz-rz1 complexes form large rod-shaped structures which, although heterogeneous, 
exhibit periodicities may reflect coiled-coil bundling well long
dimension matches width periplasm. model proposed suggesting
that formation bundles depends removal pg underlies
the rz-rz1 dependent disruption om.
