we found transcription pregenome avian hepadnavirus, duck 
hepatitis b virus (dhbv), dependent presence small element 
5' transcribed region pregenome-encoding sequence. element, 
have named pet (positive effector transcription), exerts effect cis 
a position orientation-dependent manner, suggesting may function as
part nascent pregenome transcript. requirement pet depends 
presence transcription unit region dhbv genome located
upstream envelope promoters, specifically suppresses transcription
of templates lacking pet. presence region, deletion pet
activates transcription downstream promoters, suggesting pregenome
transcription complexes fail reach downstream promoters. vitro
transcription experiments support model pet required for
transcription elongation dhbv template. speculate pet required 
to suppress transcription termination first passage pregenome
transcription complexes viral termination region circular viral 
dna.
