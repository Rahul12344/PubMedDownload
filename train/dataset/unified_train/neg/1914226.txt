the levels soluble cd4 (scd4) scd8 serum correlate cell
subset activation may important monitoring characterizing disease
processes immunological diseases. compared acute kawasaki disease (kd) 
with anaphylactoid purpura (ap) acute febrile viral infections, as
measles infectious mononucleosis (im), terms serum scd4 scd8
levels. levels serum scd4 scd8 measured sandwich enzyme
immunoassay. addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cell subsets analysed
by single two-colour flow-cytometric analyses kd im patients. the
levels serum scd4 scd8 significantly elevated patients during
acute stages kd, measles im, ap. peripheral blood cd4+, cd8+ and
also hla-dr+ cells count increase acute stage kd;
however, peripheral blood cd8+ hla-dr+ cell counts increased during
the acute stage im. results suggest low level of
activation peripheral blood cells acute kd, infiltrated t
cells local tissues kd patients contribute elevated levels of
serum scd4 scd8.
