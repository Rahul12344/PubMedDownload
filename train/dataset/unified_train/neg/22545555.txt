summary. isolation molecular characterization pigeon paramyxovirus
type 1 (ppmv-1) sick racing pigeon uruguay reported first
time. hemagglutination inhibition (hi) tests performed detect antibodies 
against avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (apmv-1), hi titer 1/32 was
obtained. tracheal cloacal swabs processed real-time reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rrt-pcr) use national
veterinary services laboratory-u.s. department agriculture validated matrix
(m) gene assay positive apmv-1. viral isolation embryonated
chicken eggs confirmed molecular detection isolate. fragment
corresponding 3' region fusion (f) protein gene amplified by
rt-pcr, subsequently sequenced. deduced amino acid sequence f
protein cleavage site displayed motif 112rrqkr/f117. phylogenetic analysis of
this part genome allowed isolated virus grouped lineage
vib/ 4b, suggests shares ecologic niche ppmv-1 
that found region, imported european north 
american viruses.
