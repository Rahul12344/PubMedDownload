moroccan pepper virus (mpv) lettuce necrotic stunt virus (lnsv) been
steadily increasing prevalence central asia western north america,
respectively, past decade. recent sequence analysis lnsv demonstrated
a close relationship coat proteins lnsv mpv. determine 
full extent relationship lnsv mpv, genomes three mpv
isolates sequenced compared lnsv. sequence analysis
demonstrated genomic nucleotide sequences well virus-encoded proteins 
of three mpv isolates lnsv shared 97% greater identity. full-length 
clone california lnsv isolate developed virus derived from
infectious transcripts used evaluate host plant reactions controlled
conditions. symptoms lnsv matched described previously mpv most
of select series host plants, although differences observed.
collectively, molecular biological results demonstrate lnsv should
be classified mpv within family tombusviridae, genus tombusvirus, and
confirm presence mpv north america.
