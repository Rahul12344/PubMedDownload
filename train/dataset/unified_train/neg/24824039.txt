current dogma favors elimination therapy-resistant cancer stem cells for
chemoprevention breast cancer. showed recently mammary cancer
development transgenic mouse model (mouse mammary tumor virus-neu; mmtv-neu)
was inhibited significantly upon treatment withaferin (wa), steroidal
lactone derived medicinal plant. herein, demonstrate mammary
cancer prevention wa accompanied vivo suppression breast cancer
stem cells (bcsc). vitro mammosphere formation dose-dependently inhibited 
by wa treatment mcf-7 sum159 human breast cancer cells. markers of
bcsc, including aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (aldh1) activity and
cd44(high)/cd24(low)/epithelial-specific antigen-positive (esa+) fraction, were
also decreased significantly presence plasma achievable doses wa.
however, wa exposure resulted cell line-specific changes oct4, sox-2, and
nanog mrna expression. wa administration mmtv-neu mice (0.1 mg/mouse, 3
times/week 28 weeks) resulted inhibition mammosphere number aldh1
activity vivo. mechanistic studies revealed although urokinase-type
plasminogen activator receptor overexpression conferred partial protection
against bcsc inhibition wa, notch4 largely dispensable response. 
wa treatment also resulted sustained (mcf-7) transient (sum159)
downregulation bmi-1 (b-cell-specific moloney murine leukemia virus insertion 
region-1) protein. ectopic expression bmi-1 conferred partial significant 
protection aldh1 activity inhibition wa. interestingly, wa treatment
caused induction kruppel-like factor 4 (klf4) knockdown augmented bcsc
inhibition wa. conclusion, study shows vivo effectiveness wa
against bcsc.
