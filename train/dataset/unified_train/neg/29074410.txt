background: people inject drugs (pwid) key population affected the
global hiv hepatitis c virus (hcv) epidemics. hiv hcv prevention
interventions pwid include needle syringe programmes (nsp), opioid
substitution therapy (ost), hiv counselling testing, hiv antiretroviral
therapy (art), condom distribution programmes. aimed produce
country-level, regional, global estimates coverage nsp, ost, hiv
testing, art, condom programmes pwid.
methods: completed searches peer-reviewed (medline, embase, psycinfo), 
internet, grey literature databases, disseminated data requests via
social media targeted emails international experts. programme survey
data named interventions collected. programme data used 
to derive country-level estimates coverage interventions accordance 
with indicators defined who, unaids, un office drugs crime.
regional global estimates nsp, ost, hiv testing coverage also
calculated. protocol registered prospero, number crd42017056558.
findings: 2017, 179 countries evidence injecting drug use, some
level nsp services available 93 countries, 86 countries
with evidence ost implementation. data estimate nsp coverage available
for 57 countries, 60 countries estimate ost coverage. coverage varied 
widely countries, often low according indicators
(<100 needle-syringes distributed per pwid per year; <20 ost recipients per pwid 
per year). data hiv testing sparser nsp ost, few
data available estimate art access among pwid living hiv. globally, 
we estimate 33 (uncertainty interval [ui] 21-50) needle-syringes
distributed via nsp per pwid annually, 16 (10-24) ost recipients per 100
pwid. less 1% pwid live countries high coverage nsp and
ost (>200 needle-syringes distributed per pwid >40 ost recipients per 100
pwid).
interpretation: coverage hiv hcv prevention interventions pwid remains
poor likely insufficient effectively prevent hiv hcv
transmission. scaling interventions pwid remains crucial priority for
halting hiv hcv epidemics.
