elite controllers (ec) human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) maintain
viremia limit detection without antiretroviral treatment.
virus-specific cytotoxic cd8(+) lymphocytes believed play crucial role
in viral containment, degree immune imprinting compensatory
mutations ec unclear. obtained plasma gag, pol, nef sequences from
hla-diverse subjects found 30 40% predefined hla-associated
polymorphic sites show evidence immune selection pressure ec, compared to
approximately 50% sites chronic progressors. data indicate
ongoing viral replication escape cytotoxic lymphocytes present
even strictly controlled hiv-1 infection.
