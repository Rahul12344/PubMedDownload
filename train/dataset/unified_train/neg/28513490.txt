background: microsporidial stromal keratitis poses several diagnostic challenges.
patients may present corneal ulceration, marked stromal thinning, even as
a quite corneal scar. presentation microsporidial stromal keratitis
commonly mimics viral keratitis. microbiology scrapings usually helpful;
however, scraping culture-negative cases pose significant diagnostic
dilemma. histopathological examination diagnostic shows varying degree 
inflammation, predominantly composed polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
granulomatous inflammation, microsporidial stromal keratitis, never well
described, authors article aim describe presence of
granulomatous inflammation microsporidial stromal keratitis, patients 
associated herpes simplex virus (hsv) keratitis.
methods: retrospective observational study conducted tertiary
eye care center.
results: 263 patients underwent therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty for
infectious keratitis, 2011-2013, seven patients diagnosed as
microsporidial stromal keratitis. microsporidial spores could demonstrated 
microbiological scrapings 5/7 (71%) cases, identified on
histopathological examination also confirmed polymerase chain reaction
(pcr) microsporidium 100% cases. evidence diffuse stromal 
necrosis markedly severe degree polymorphonuclear leukocytic infiltrates,
with granulomatous inflammation 42% cases. interestingly, were
positive hsv-1 dna pcr. review medical records revealed much severe
clinical presentations patients granulomatous inflammation, comparison
to cases without granulomatous inflammation.
conclusions: authors hereby recommend severe clinical presentation in
patients microsporidial stromal keratitis, markedly dense polymorphonuclear 
leukocytic infiltrates presence granulomatous inflammation the
histopathological examination, investigated presence of
hsv-1 dna better patient management good visual outcome.
