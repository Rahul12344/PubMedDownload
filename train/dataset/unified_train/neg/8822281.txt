objectives: determine prevalence acquired deficiency protein s, a
coagulation inhibitor, children infected human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv) identify clinical laboratory features associated this
coagulation abnormality.
methods: convenience sample hiv-infected children, ages 2 18 years, was
evaluated total, free functional protein s; total functional protein 
c; prothrombin activated partial thromboplastin times; fibrinogen;
antithrombin iii activity; dilute russell viper venom time; igg anticardiolipin
antibodies; von willebrand factor antigen; c4b-binding protein; cd4+ lymphocyte
counts; hiv p24 antigen concentration; serum beta 2-microglobulin
concentrations.
results: thirty-four subjects evaluated. twenty-four subjects infected 
perinatally 10 transfusion. nine subjects cdc class n
(asymptomatic), 13 class a/b (symptomatic without aids-defining condition)
and 12 class c (aids). none previously documented thrombosis, nephrosis 
or significant hepatic dysfunction. twenty-six subjects (76.5%) decreased
free protein s, 19 (55.9%) functional protein < 2 sd mean 
laboratory controls. decreased functional protein seen 33.3% class n,
53.8% class a/b 75.0% class c subjects. prevalence decreased
total functional protein greater absolute cd4+ t
lymphocyte counts < 200/mm3 compared cd4+ counts > = 200/mm3
(75.0% vs. 38.9%; chi square, 4.48, p = 0.034). trend toward negative
correlation observed protein duration hiv infection for
class n subjects. linear correlation seen protein cd4+ t
lymphocyte counts; significant relationships observed protein
s values cmv status, hiv p24 antigen, c4b-binding protein, von willebrand
factor antigen, igg anti-cardiolipin antibodies serum beta 2-microglobulin
values.
conclusions: acquired protein deficiency common hiv-infected children.
the high prevalence anticoagulant abnormality suggests increased risk 
for thrombotic complications population.
