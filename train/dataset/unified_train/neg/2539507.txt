a myc-containing recombinant feline leukemia provirus, designated ftt, was
molecularly cloned cat t-cell lymphoma line f422. transforming
activity, well nucleotide sequence 3' 2.7 kilobases ftt,
including v-myc, determined. predicted v-myc protein differs feline 
c-myc three amino acid changes truncated two amino acids the
carboxyl terminus. comparison feline leukemia virus (felv), feline c-myc,
and felv proviruses indicates recombination junctions involved 
generation felv-onc viruses occur preferred locations within virus.
they usually follow occur within sequence acccc 5' junctions may
result homologous recombination sequences marked
purine-pyrimidine strand bias, especially 3' junctions. recombination
sites also resemble recombinase recognition sequences utilized immunoglobulin 
and t-cell receptor variable-region joining. transfection primary rat embryo
fibroblasts subsequent vivo analysis revealed morphologic and
tumorigenic transformation require cotransfection ftt human ej-ras dna;
neither gene alone sufficient. ftt v-myc expressed transformed rat
cells 3.0-kilobase subgenomic rna; however, contrast depressed
level c-myc expression v-myc-involved feline tumors, steady-state levels of
rat c-myc rna protein apparently unaltered.
