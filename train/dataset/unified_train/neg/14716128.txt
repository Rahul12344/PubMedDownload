background: bethesda system reporting cervico-vaginal smears, equivocal
epithelial cell abnormalities categorised "atypical squamous and
glandular cells undetermined significance" (ascus agus). these
abnormalities may harbour minor lesions attributed mere inflammatory changes
to potentially serious high grade lesions. recommended qualify
these lesions according whether favor reactive neoplastic outcome.
aims: undertook present study assess significance ascus
qualifiers.
material methods: total 12071 women screened early detection of
cancer cervix. women ascus diagnosis qualified ascus
favor reactive ascus favor sil (squamous intraepithelial lesion) according
the bethesda 1991 system reporting. ascus-reactive cases followed a
repeat smear examination persistent ascus cases taken colposcopy 
and biopsy indicated. ascus-sil cases taken immediate
colposcopy.
results: pick rate high grade lesions significantly different
(p=0.47; chi square test) follow ascus-reactive (2/222) and
ascus-sil (2/130) groups. low grade lesions picked 10/222
ascus-reactive 58/130 ascus-sil, statistically significant (p < 
0.001).
conclusions: results study indicate worthwhile to
qualify lesions majority ascus-sil also revealed low grade
epithelial benign biological behaviour.
