the long-term duration recombinant hepatitis b vaccine-induced immunity among 
persons vaccinated starting birth still well understood. waning of
vaccine-induced immunity could leave young adults risk hepatitis b virus
infection due behavioral occupational exposures. followed cohort of
children immunized starting birth 3-dose regimen recombinant
hepatitis b vaccine (5 mcg, 2.5 mcg, 2.5 mcg). challenged a
booster dose hepatitis b vaccine 10 15 years vaccination to
assess anamnestic response measure persistence protection. among 108
participants lost protective antibody levels hepatitis b, the
majority (>70%) anamnestic response booster dose; response rates
did decline significantly 10 15 years follow-up periods. high
antibody concentration following primary vaccination independently associated
with anamnestic response later life. nonetheless, ~20-30% of
participants unable mount immune response boosting. hepatitis b 
revaccination might required persons vaccinated starting birth if
opportunities hepatitis b virus exposure exist. future vaccine
recommendations based studies ascertaining protection against
clinically significant disease.
