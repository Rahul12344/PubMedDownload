we used dicistronic vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) minigenomes dissect 
the functional importance nontranscribed intergenic dinucleotide the
conserved transcription start sequence found beginning vsv genes.
the minigenomes generated entirely cdna contained g m
protein genes, flanked leader trailer regions indiana
serotype vsv. mutations made either within nontranscribed m-g
intergenic dinucleotide within transcription start sequence the
downstream g gene. immunofluorescence microscopy immunoprecipitation analysis
of mutated minigenomes indicated first three nucleotides the
transcriptional start sequence critical efficient vsv gene
expression, whereas nontranscribed, intergenic dinucleotide other
conserved nucleotides found 5' mrna start sequence tolerate
significant sequence variability without affecting g protein production. rna
analysis indicated nucleotide changes transcriptional start sequence 
which resulted reduced g protein expression correlated amount of
transcript present. therefore, conserved sequence appears required for
efficient transcript initiation following polyadenylation upstream mrna.
while minimum sequence efficient transcription (3'-uygnn-5') similar
to rhabdoviruses, homologous start sites for
viruses paramyxoviridae filoviridae families. using northern blot
analysis, also found nucleotide changes nontranscribed
intergenic region resulted higher levels read-through transcription.
therefore, nontranscribed intergenic dinucleotide plays role transcript 
termination.
