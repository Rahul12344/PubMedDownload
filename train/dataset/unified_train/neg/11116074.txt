the increased expression plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (pai-1) is
associated increased concentrations fatty acids blood may
accelerate atherogenesis diabetes. present study designed define
mechanisms nonesterified (free) fatty acids (ffas) augment the
expression pai-1. ffas increased pai-1 protein mrna expression hepg2
cells. identify potential regulatory elements, constructed chimeric genes
by fusing 1313, 853, 610, 328 bp human pai-1 5'-flanking dna a
luciferase reporter (pai-luc). 2-fold increase luciferase activity seen 
when cells transfected pai-luc 1313, 863, 610 exposed ffas.
no response ffas seen pai-luc 328 deletion 72-bp (-599
to -528) fragment pai-luc 1313. 72-bp fragment conferred ffa
responsiveness different (simian virus 40) promoter. two footprinted regions
were demonstrated dnase analysis. gel mobility shift assays indicated
specific binding extracted proteins ffa response element:
5'-tg(g/c)(1-2)ctg-3'. sequence repeated 4 times similar an
sp1-binding site. sp1 consensus oligonucleotides inhibited binding extracted
proteins regulatory elements. accordingly, ffa-induced increased
expression pai-1 hepg2 cells mediated binding transcription 
factor factors repeated fatty acid response element,
5'-tg(g/c)(1-2)ctg-3', highly homologous sp1-binding site.
