setting: prospective cohort study, ethiopia.
objective: study changes biological markers hiv infection progression
before development tb disease.
design: longitudinal study 804 adult factory workers (95 hiv-positive, 709
hiv-negative), followed every 6 months median 3.8 years.
results: overall, incidence rate tb 10/222 = 45.1 (95%ci 24.3-83.9)
per 1000 person-years observation (pyo) among hiv-1-positive participants,
compared 14/2054 = 6.8 (95%ci 4.0-11.5) per 1000 pyo among hiv-1-negative
participants (incidence rate ratio 6.62, 95%ci 2.94-14.9). among 10
hiv-positive participants subsequently developed tb disease, cd4 count
was low (median 201/microliter, range 45-419), viral load high (median 4.97
log copies/ml, range 3.70-5.58), routine follow-up visit prior tb
diagnosis. following tb treatment, plasma viral load remained persistently
elevated despite clinical resolution tb disease, seven 10 patients 
died within median time 8 months.
conclusion: cohort, hiv-infected ethiopians developed tb disease
already low cd4 counts high viral load prior diagnosis tb.
viral load decrease following tb treatment, leading poor overall
prognosis patients.
