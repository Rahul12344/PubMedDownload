three subtypes, defined hindiii restriction endonuclease (re) analysis
patterns, bovine herpesvirus 1 (bhv 1) used inoculate seronegative,
bhv 1-free cattle. included: infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus
(ibrv), subtype 1.1; infectious pustular vulvovaginitis virus (ippv) isolate k22,
subtype 1.2b; ipvv isolate fi, subtype 1.2a. nasal, vaginal, buffy coat
samples taken virus isolation animal. analysis done 
virus isolates collected acute infection, reactivation latency,
and reactivation followed superinfection subtype bhv 1 that
differed primary inoculation virus. changes occurred bhv 1 genome
after 1 passage host animal, varied tissue tissue within 
the animal. viruses reactivated latency also displayed genome
variability. animals received ipvv primary inoculation virus
were successfully superinfected. superinfection, cattle shed both
superinfecting reactivated viruses, genome variability observed.
these data suggest application analysis diagnostic and
epidemiologic studies bhv 1 limited analysis types subtypes,
and applicable examination isolates within bhv 1
subtype.
