cytopathic effects oat sterile dwarf virus enation cells oat leaves.

brcák j, králík o.

a czechoslovak isolate oat sterile dwarf virus caused thickening distortion
of cell walls induced formation viroplasms containing incomplete virus
particles gall phloem. effects similar caused other
plant reoviruses tubular structures containing rows virions found.
dense bodies similar diameter virions occasionally seen inside
mitochondria. complete virions distributed random cytoplasm but
clusters virions sometimes enclosed within membrane. crystalline
arrays virions seen. late infection parenchyma cells contained
membranous structures formed membranes 11 nm thick, close viroplasms.
as cells degenerated further, occurred scrolls membranes, 150 
nm diameter. unbound masses fine fibrous tubular structures, strongly
resembling p-protein, occurred cytoplasm. fibrils 5 nm in
diameter unbranched tubes 21 nm wide. complete virions seen 
these structures.
