background: pregnant women prioritized seasonal influenza vaccination,
but evidence risk influenza pregnancy used inform
these policies limited.
methods: individual-level administrative data sets active surveillance data
were joined estimate influenza-associated hospitalization outpatient visit
rates pregnancy, postpartum, trimester status.
results: 2012-2015, 46 260 (17.7%) influenza-confirmed hospitalizations
for acute respiratory infection 13 294 (4.4%) influenza-confirmed
outpatient visits among pregnant postpartum women. pregnant and
postpartum women experienced higher rates influenza-associated hospitalization
than nonpregnant women overall (rate ratio [rr], 3.4; 95% confidence interval
[ci], 2.5-4.7) trimester (first, 2.5 [95% ci, 1.2-5.4]; second, 3.9 [95%
ci, 2.4-6.3]; third, 4.8 [95% ci, 3.0-7.7]); rr postpartum period
was 0.7 (95% ci, 3.0-7.7). influenza viruses associated increased 
risk (rr 2009 pandemic influenza a[h1n1] virus, 5.3 [95% ci, 3.2-8.7]; rr for
influenza a(h3n2) virus, 3.0 [95% ci, 1.8-5.0]), influenza b virus not
(rr, 1.8; 95% ci, .7-4.6). influenza-associated hospitalization rates in
pregnancy significantly higher māori women (rr, 3.2; 95% ci, 1.3-8.4),
compared women european ethnicity. similar risks for
influenza-confirmed outpatient visits observed.
conclusion: seasonal influenza poses higher risks hospitalization among
pregnant women trimesters, compared nonpregnant women.
hospitalization rates vary influenza virus type ethnicity among pregnant
women.
