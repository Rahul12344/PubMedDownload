human t-cell lymphotropic virus type (htlv-i), cause adult t-cell
leukemia, also associated neurological disease, tsp/ham (tropical
spastic paraparesis/htlv-i associated myelopathy). htlv-i genome encodes a
protein, tax, trans activates viral cellular gene transcription. to
understand mechanisms production cytokines htlv-i nervous
tissue, examined expression glial cells carried the
tax-expressing vector. demonstrated tax expression enhanced the
production glial cells interleukin (il)-1, il-6, granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) transforming growth factor (tgf) beta. 
suggest excessive production cytokines nervous tissue may play a
role pathogenesis tsp/ham. glial cells carry tax gene may provide 
a model useful vitro study mechanism production cytokines 
the nervous system.
