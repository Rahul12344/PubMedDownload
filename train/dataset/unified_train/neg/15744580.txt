pneumonia virus mice (pvm) enveloped rna-containing virus family
paramyxoviridae. sequences determined previously number pvm
genes, although represented cloned cdnas rather consensus sequences.
sequences available 3' -leader 5' -trailer regions that
constitute genome termini large polymerase l gene accounts
for 43% genome. also, available sequences attenuated
variant strain 15, whereas present study analyzed version strain 15
that available american type culture collection (atcc) highly 
virulent mice. analysis unclosed rt-pcr products yielded complete
consensus sequence 14,886 nt (genbank accession number ay729016). the
regions sequences previously reported non-pathogenic
strain, 13 nucleotide differences 10 amino acid differences
compared present consensus sequence virulent isolate. various 
genes pvm shared 29-62% nucleotide sequence identity 10-60% amino acid
sequence identity human bovine respiratory syncytial virus (hrsv and
brsv), closest relatives.
