murine gamma-herpesvirus 68 (mhv-68) model study pathogenesis
of gamma-herpesviruses. epstein-barr virus (ebv) highly related
gamma-herpesvirus causes significant disease humans. major membrane
antigen gp350 ebv candidate vaccine antigen protection against
ebv-related disease. mhv-68 glycoprotein, gp150, significant homology to
ebv gp350. therefore used mhv-68 gp150 model potential
efficacy ebv gp350 protecting virus-associated disease. recombinant 
vaccinia virus expressing mhv-68 gp150 constructed. recombinant vaccinia
virus used infect mice via subcutaneous route. vaccination
resulted production mhv-68-neutralising antibodies. mice then
challenged intra-nasally mhv-68. mhv-68-associated mononucleosis was
virtually abrogated immunised mice. however, mice establish mhv-68
latency. results suggest gp350 may effective immunogen to
prevent ebv-associated infectious mononucleosis humans are
ebv-seronegative.
