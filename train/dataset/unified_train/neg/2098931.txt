this paper presents novel entirely hypothetical concept pathogenesis
of shock syndrome (dss) associated dengue hemorrhagic fever (dhf).
antibody-dependent enhancement (ade) widely thought central the
development clinical entities. current views mechanisms
underlying ade centre two major lines thought: 1) non-neutralizing
antibodies dengue virus (dv) enhance viral uptake replication in
target cells (monocytes). 2) dhf/dss consequences enhanced viral
replication, paired immunopathological processes evoked monocyte
dysfunction detrimental reactions caused activated t-lymphocytes. the
present hypothesis proposes, contrast, central role following
processes: 1) secondary infection individual sub or
non-neutralizing antibody titers dv leads booster antibody response 
and steep rise antibody levels. 2) antibodies dv bind direct 
a selective attack complement system onto cells expressing viral antigens 
on surface. dhf/dss direct indirect consequences complement 
activation cells. advanced hypothesis, departs the
mainstream "immune enhancement" concepts, easily tested by
experimentation.
