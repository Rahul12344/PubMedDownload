injury central nervous system (cns) either trauma due to
demyelinating/degenerating diseases results typical response astrocytes, 
termed astrogliosis. reaction characterized astrocyte proliferation,
extensive hypertrophy nuclei, cell body, cytoplasmic processes an
increase immunodetectable glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap). gfap
accumulation may cause physical barrier preventing reestablishment a
functional environment. studies aimed modulating astrogliosis by
inhibiting delaying gfap synthesis damaged reactive astrocytes. the
present study investigates use recombinant retrovirus expressing
antisense gfap rna controlling response mechanically injured
astrocytes. 650 bp fragment coding region mouse gfap cdna was
cloned antisense orientation control long terminal repeat
(ltr) promoter moloney murine leukemia virus. increase gfap detected 
immunocytochemical staining injured astrocytes inhibited treatment with
retrovirus expressing antisense gfap rna. also, astrocytes site injury 
in scratched cultures show cell body hypertrophy compared to
control cultures. observations demonstrate increase gfap the
site injury inhibited using retroviral treatment indicate the
potential retrovirus-mediated gene transfer modulating scar formation in
the cns vivo. studies also shed light role gfap maintaining
the morphology astrocytes.
