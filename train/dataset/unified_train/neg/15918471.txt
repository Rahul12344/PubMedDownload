a taura syndrome virus (tsv) isolate cultured penaeus vannamei grown in
belize, central america characterized shown unique isolate.
mortality rates laboratory infections specific pathogen-free (spf) p.
vannamei, reactivity virus monoclonal antibody (mab) 1a1 and
phylogenetic analysis demonstrated belize isolate (blz02tsv) new
valiant tsv. hawaiian 1994 tsv isolate (hi94tsv, genbank af277675) was
used reference isolate studies. laboratory infections spf p. 
vannamei blz02tsv demonstrated higher mortalities earlier onset of
mortalities compared infections hi94tsv. shrimp tissues infected with
blz02tsv reacted tsv-specific gene probe situ hybridization were
positive rt-pcr using tsv diagnostic primers, thus indicating isolate
was tsv. however, western blot analysis immunohistochemistry using mab 1a1
demonstrated blz02tsv react antibody, suggestive changes
in vp1 region genome codes polypeptide mab 1a1
binds. phylogenetic analysis 1.3 kbp fragment tsv vp1 capsid region
revealed blz02tsv represents distinct group among 29 isolates of
tsv studied thus far. research demonstrates blz02tsv unique
isolate tsv reiterates problem related use mab 1a1 for
detection tsv clinical specimens.
