the results one- two-dimensional echocardiography 128 patients (117
males, 11 females; median age 37 years) seropositive hiv-1 were
analyzed addition clinical, electrocardiographic, laboratory data.
follow-up controls available 51 patients observation period 1 
to 24 months, median 9.5 months. probably hiv-related echocardiographic
abnormalities identified 36 patients (28%): small moderate pericardial
effusions (n = 34) left ventricular dilation (n = 5). pericardial effusions
resolved seven patients follow-up, three cases tuberculostatic
chemotherapy. compared patients without cardiac involvement patients with
hiv-related echocardiographic abnormalities showed lower cd4-lymphocyte counts
(143 +/- 138 vs 289 +/- 219/microliters, p less equal 0.01), left 
ventricular endsystolic dimensions increased (34.2 +/- 4.5 vs 32.6 +/- 3.0
mm, p less equal 0.05). cardiac involvement occurred predominantly 
the advanced stages hiv-1 infection unclear etiology majority 
of cases, even though active concomitant diseases could frequently
demonstrated. clinical course patients might consistent with
intercurrently completed perimyocarditis, probably viral genesis.
cd4-lymphocyte counts less equal 100/microliters could identified
as risk factor development cardiac manifestations. significance 
of demonstrated involvement heart regard therapeutic
consequences prognosis appeared slight. use echocardiography a
routine method detection cardiac involvement hiv-1 infection has
proved valuable, since indicative clinical symptoms lacking almost 
all cases.
