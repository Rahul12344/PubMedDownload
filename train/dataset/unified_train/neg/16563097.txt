cancer thought arise consequence multiple insults cell.
mutations lead increased expression activity proto-oncogenes or
decreased expression tumor suppressors common insults been
identified date. however, considering tumor viruses, viral proteins 
modify cellular gene expression, alter host immune surveillance, affect
signaling pathways also common players. notably, several tumor
viruses encode proteins containing immunoreceptor-associated tyrosine-based
activation motif (itam), signaling motif recently implicated epithelial cell
oncogenesis. expression proteins bearing motif normally restricted 
to hematopoietic cells, recent work highlighting consequences itam
expression epithelial cells suggests may play role solid tumor
formation.
