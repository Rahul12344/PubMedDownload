rationale: molecular mimicry theory (mmt) suggests epitope mimicry between
pathogens human proteins activate autoimmune disease. group a
streptococci (gas) mimics human cardiac myosin rheumatic heart disease (rhd)
and coxsackie viruses (cx) mimic actin autoimmune myocarditis (am). myosin
and actin immunologically inaccessible unlikely initial targets.
extracellular cardiac proteins mimic gas cx would likely.
objectives: determine whether extracellular cardiac proteins coxsackie
and adenovirus receptor (car), beta 1 adrenergic receptor (b1ar), cd55/daf,
laminin, collagen iv mimic gas, cx, and/or cardiac myosin actin.
methods: blast 2.0 lalign searches uniprot protein database were
employed identify potential molecular mimics. quantitative enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay used measure antibody cross-reactivity.
measurements: similarities considered significant sequence
contained least 5 identical amino acids 10. antibodies considered to
be cross-reactive binding constant k less 10(-9) m.
main results: group streptococci mimics laminin, car, myosin. cx mimics
actin collagen iv b1ar. similarity search results mirrored by
antibody cross-reactivities. additionally, antibodies laminin recognize
antibodies collagen iv; antibodies actin recognize antibodies
against myosin, antibodies gas recognize antibodies cx. thus,
there mimicry extracellular proteins antigenic complementarity
between gas-cx rhd/am.
conclusion: rheumatic heart disease/am may due combined infections gas
with cx localized cardiomyocytes may produce synergistic,
hyperinflammatory response cross-reacts laminin, collagen iv, car,
and/or b1ar. epitope drift shifts immune response myosin actin after
cardiomyocytes become damaged.
