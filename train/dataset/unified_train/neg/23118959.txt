predicting mirnas arduous task, due diversity precursors 
complexity enzyme processes. although several prediction approaches have
reached impressive performances, could achieve full-function
recognition mature mirna directly candidate hairpins across species. 
therefore, researchers continue seek powerful model close biological
recognition mirna structure. report, describe novel mirna
prediction algorithm, known fommir, using fixed-order markov model based 
the secondary structural pattern. training dataset containing 809 human
pre-mirnas 6441 human pseudo-mirna hairpins, model's parameters were
defined evaluated. results showed fommir reached 91% accuracy the
human dataset 5-fold cross-validation. moreover, independent test
datasets, fommir presented outstanding prediction human other
species including vertebrates, drosophila, worms viruses, even plants, in
contrast well-known algorithms models. especially, fommir 
only able distinguish mirna precursors hairpins, also locate 
the position strand mature mirna. therefore, study provides new
generation mirna prediction algorithm, successfully realizes a
full-function recognition mature mirnas directly hairpin
sequences. presents new understanding biological recognition
based strongest signal's location detected fommir, might be
closely associated enzyme cleavage mechanism mirna
maturation.
