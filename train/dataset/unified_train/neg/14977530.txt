we determined extent expression three cytokines (ifn-gamma, il-4, and
tnf-alpha ) brain tissue infected human immunodeficiency virus-1 (hiv-1).
the selections ifn-gamma th1 cytokine, il- 4 th2 cytokine, and
tnf-alpha pro-inflammatory cytokine (and prior implication in
brain tissue damage due hiv-1 infection). based current models for
pathogenesis hiv-1-associated dementia (had), periphery, th1 cytokines 
are considered salutary, whereas th2 cytokines regarded deleterious.
however, hypothesized cns roles reversed. post-mortem
temporal lobe tissue specimens 16 hiv-1-seropositive patients 11
hiv-1-seronegative controls stained ifn-gamma, il-4, tnf-alpha
utilizing immunohistochemistry alkaline phosphatase. hiv-1 infection causes
alterations brain cytokine expression include increased ifn-gamma
expression hiv-1-seropositive vs. hiv-1-seronegative individuals. was
increased expression ifn-gamma hiv-1-seropositive individuals or
without had, without broader category neuropsychiatric impairment 
(npi), without opportunistic infections (ois) compared to
hiv-1-seronegatives. significant inverse correlation ifn-gamma vs. il-4
in hiv-1-seropositives seronegative individuals observed.
there inverse correlation seropositives ifn-gamma vs.
tnf-alpha, positive trend had, significant without had, significant with
npi significant without ois. il-4 vs. tnf-alpha a
correlation (trend) seropositives, trend npi, significant without npi, 
and trend without oi. due hiv-1 infection brain neurological
disease prominent increased expression ifn-gamma, inverse
expression ifn-gamma vs. tnf-alpha, tnf-alpha vs. il-4. inverse
correlation increased ifn-gamma decreased il-4 expression is
consistent stimulation activated macrophages, cells, greater
toxicity hiv-1-infected brain, supportive significance of
ifn-gamma hiv-1-infected patients.
