recent studies shown gram-positive bacterium lactococcus lactis can
be exploited expression heterologous proteins; however, versatile
set vectors suitable inducible extracellular protein production and
subsequent purification expressed proteins immobilized metal affinity
chromatography far lacking. describe three novel vectors that,
respectively, facilitate nisin-inducible production n- c-terminally
hexa-histidine (his6)-tagged proteins l. lactis. one vectors also
encodes tobacco etch virus (tev) protease cleavage site allowing removal the
n-terminal his6-tag expressed proteins. successful application the
developed vectors protein expression, purification and/or functional studies 
is exemplified six different cell wall-bound secreted proteins from
staphylococcus aureus. results show secretory production s. aureus
proteins affected position, n- c-terminal, his6-tag. this
seems due influence his6-tag protein stability.
intriguingly, s. aureus isdb protein, phosphorylated s. aureus,
was also found phosphorylated heterologously produced l. lactis,
albeit tyr residue. implies particular
post-translational protein modification extent conserved s. aureus 
and l. lactis. altogether, confident present vector set combined 
with l. lactis expression host potential become useful tool
in optimization expression, purification functional analysis of
extracytoplasmic bacterial proteins.
