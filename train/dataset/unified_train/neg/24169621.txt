more 170 million people worldwide infected hepatitis c virus
(hcv), future therapies expected rely upon combination oral
antivirals. rapidly evolving virus like hcv, host-targeting antivirals 
an attractive option. decipher role novel hcv-host interactions, we
used proteomics approach combining immunoprecipitation viral-host protein
complexes coupled mass spectrometry identification functional genomics rna
interference screening hcv partners. here, report proteomics analyses
of protein complexes associated core, ns2, ns3/4a, ns4b, ns5a, ns5b
proteins. identified stringent set 98 human proteins interacting
specifically one viral proteins. overlap previous virus-host
interaction studies demonstrates 24.5% shared hcv interactors overall (24/98),
illustrating reliability approach. identified human proteins show 
enriched gene ontology terms associated endoplasmic reticulum, transport
proteins major contribution ns3/4a interactors, transmembrane
proteins core interactors. interaction network emphasizes high degree
distribution, high betweenness distribution, high interconnectivity of
targeted human proteins, agreement previous virus-host interactome
studies. set hcv interactors also shows extensive enrichment known
targets viruses. combined proteomic gene silencing study
revealed strong enrichment modulators hcv rna replication, the
identification 11 novel cofactors among set specific hcv partners.
finally, report novel immune evasion mechanism ns3/4a protein based on
its ability affect nucleocytoplasmic transport type interferon-mediated
signal transducer activator transcription 1 nuclear translocation. the
study revealed highly stringent association hcv interactors their
functional contribution viral replication cycle pathogenesis.
