alterations microrna (mirna) expression human animal models have
been linked many forms cancer. mirnas, act directly as
repressors gene expression, found frequently reside fragile
sites genomic regions associated cancer. study describes mirna
signature human primary hepatitis b virus-positive human hepatocellular
carcinoma. moreover, two known oncomirs--mirnas known roles cancer--the
mir-17-92 polycistron mir-21, exhibited increased expression 100% of
primary human woodchuck hepatocellular carcinomas surveyed. determine 
importance mirnas tumorigenesis, vitro antisense
oligonucleotide knockdown model evaluated ability reverse the
malignant phenotype. human woodchuck hcc cell lines, separate
treatments antisense oligonucleotides specific either mir-17-92
polycistron (all six members) mir-21 caused 50% reduction hepatocyte
proliferation anchorage-independent growth. combination assays
presented supports role mirnas maintenance the
malignant transformation hepatocytes.
