objective: observe anti-proliferative effect herpes simplex virus thymidine
kinase gene system (hsv-tk) human tenon capsule fibroblasts (htfs) it's
mechanism.
methods: retroviral vector constructed containing hsv-tk gene transfer to
packaging cell line pt67. positive clones selected g418 the
supernatant collected contains virus particles. titer virus 
was also calculated. virus particles verified transmission electron
microscope (tem). pcr carried detect integrity tk gene into
viral dna genome. htfs cells infected virus positive clones
were selected propagation culture. rt-pcr western blot used to
detect tk gene expression. anti-proliferative effect tk gene htfs cells
was determined mtt. apoptosis cells detected hoechst 33258 dna
staining flow cytometry. morphologic changes cell observed by
tem.
results: retroviral vector pl (tk) sn constructed successfully 
verified enzyme cutting. shape virus particles derived package
cells appeared oval spherical tem diameter around 100 nm.
the tk gene detected viral dna genome pcr. virus titer 4 x 
10(7) cfu/ml. expression tk gene detected rt-pcr western blot
both mrna protein level. anti-proliferative effect tk gene htfs 
cells dose-dependent, cells died 5 days 5 x 10(-3) g/l gcv
being added, ic50 = 6 x 10(-4) g/l. necrosis apoptosis observed 
this study apoptosis rate increased increasing dose gcv.
conclusions: proliferation htfs cells vitro could effectively
inhibited killing effect hsv-tk-gcv system pathway of
necrosis apoptosis.
