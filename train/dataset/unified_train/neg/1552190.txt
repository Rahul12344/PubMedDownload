recent studies using biotinylated situ hybridization (ish) utilized a
wide range detection protocols biotinylated hybrids, leading to
conflicting reports literature regarding sensitivity. study we
compared 11 different detection protocols biotinylated ish using measles
virus-specific rna probe formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded central nervous
system tissue infected measles virus. maximum sensitivity achieved 
five-step detection protocols incorporating use monoclonal antibody to
biotin. single-step detection protocols found insensitive, shown by
their failure detect viral nucleic acid infected white-matter cells. only
by increasing number steps detection protocols infected 
cells demonstrable. unless pre-hybridization, hybridization, detection
protocols optimized, results obtained pathogenicity studies using ish 
could misinterpreted, leading false conclusions nucleic acid
distribution. also applies ever-increasing use ish diagnostic 
purposes.
