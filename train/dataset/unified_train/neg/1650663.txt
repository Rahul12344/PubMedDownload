the acquisition drug resistance vivo investigated 7 serial passages 
(from p0 p7) herpes simplex virus (hsv-1) rabbit cornea treated with
either iudr (idoxuridine), idc (idoxycytidine), acv (acyclovir), tft
(trifluridine), ara (adenine arabinoside). therapeutic failure acquired 
gradually: p3 iudr, p4 acv p5 tft. p7, viral
thymidine kinase (tk) activity reduced 5.6% parental strain for
iudr, 7.5% acv 4.6% tft treatment. signs clinical
unresponsiveness occurred idc ara a. vitro determination of
antiviral drug sensitivity performed dye-uptake assay hsv isolates at
each passage showed correlation increase 50% effective dose 
(ed50) increase ulcer area grade passage antiviral drug 
(p less 0.1). iudr- tft-resistant hsv1 developed cross-resistances 
to tk dependent drugs. however acv-resistant hsv1 show cross-resistance
to antiviral tk dependent drugs. acquisition cross-resistances
is discussed, practical implications case therapeutic failures 
suggested.
