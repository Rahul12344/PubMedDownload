highly purified chicken progesterone receptor (cpr) shown stimulate rna
synthesis directly vitro transcription assay. stimulation of
transcription cpr requires presence progesterone response elements
(pres) template specifically inhibited addition of
competitor oligonucleotides containing pres. binding receptor two pres is
cooperative leads synergistic (27-fold) stimulation transcription. a
purified fusion protein containing dna binding domain cpr linked yeast 
ubiquitin produced e. coli also functions transcription assay. 
using vitro transcription system, demonstrate hormone-free cpr
activated salt treatment induces transcription test gene a
hormone-independent manner. finally, present evidence progesterone
receptor acts facilitating formation stable preinitiation complex 
the target gene promoter thus augments initiation transcription rna
