frequently population density 200 inhabitants/km(2) this
density (relative risk 2.50, 95% confidence interval 1.18-5.32). analysis of
the receiver-operating characteristic curve, diagnostic performance the
share system classifier seasonal influenza determined. the
sensitivity 83% specificity 79% sickness absence rates
exceeded 5%. performance share system correlated size
