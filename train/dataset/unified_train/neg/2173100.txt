cytomegalovirus (cmv) ubiquitous agent rarely causes disease in
immunocompetent humans important cause morbidity mortality in
the immunocompromised. number host viral factors associated with
pathology following cmv infection. cmv found many sites body but
only causes disease certain patient
populations. situations mechanism underlying disease direct viral 
replication, others, particularly cmv pneumonitis allogeneic transplant
recipients, immunopathologic basis strongly implicated. important factor
in pathogenesis infection expression symptomatic disease the
source cmv infection-whether arises exogenous source due to
reactivation latent endogenous virus. exogenous infection occur in
previously seronegative individuals prior exposure virus.
in renal transplant recipients types exogenous infection been
associated disease. another factor affects interaction cmv 
and host modulating effect virus host immune response,
the mechanism remains unknown.
