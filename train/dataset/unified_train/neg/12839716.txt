objective: evaluate modified microplate method, utilizing hef, hep-2, vero, 
mdck newly introduced rd-18s gmk cell lines, virus isolation.
methods: june october 2001, 723 throat swab specimens taken children
with acute respiratory infections (aris) inoculated onto cells. to
analyze cell sensitivity, also inoculated 20 serotypes stocked
enteroviruses.
results: period, isolated 40 coxsackie a2 (coxa2), 13 coxa4, 16
coxa16, 1 coxb2, 11 coxb3, 2 coxb5, 54 echo16, 2 entero71 1 polio2. by
observing cell sensitivity pattern hef, hep-2, vero, rd-18s, gmk, we
could finally differentiate five enterovirus groups: coxa except coxa16,
coxa16/entero71, coxb, echovirus, poliovirus.
conclusions: system, rd-18s cell line enabled us isolate coxa
virus, except coxa16, first time. differentiation five enterovirus
groups cell sensitivity simplified specific identification by
neutralization test presumptive identification. modified microplate method
may appropriate cell combination virus isolation, especially for
enteroviruses, expected used routinely virologic diagnosis and
to clarify epidemiology ari children.
