organotypic spinal cord cultures infected west nile virus (wnv) exhibited 
remarkable arrangement virions among lamellae myelin sheath. virions
were first observed neurons day 4 infection appeared within 
the myelin lamellae. virions observed central myelin, aligned
along interperiod lines therefore attached outer side the
oligodendrocyte membrane. spite peculiar location virions,
their presence associated severe damage axon myelin
sheath. causes formation viral pattern, morphological
features, role might viral infection vivo are
considered.
