strategies aimed invoking synaptic plasticity therapeutic potential for
several neurological conditions. human retinal synaptic disease x-linked
retinoschisis (xlrs) characterized impaired visual signal transmission
through retina progressive visual acuity loss, mice lacking
retinoschisin (rs1) recapitulate human disease. here, demonstrate that
restoration rs1 via retina-specific delivery adeno-associated virus type
8-rs1 (aav8-rs1) vector rescues molecular pathology the
photoreceptor-depolarizing bipolar cell (photoreceptor-dbc) synapse restores 
function adult rs1-ko animals. initial development photoreceptor-dbc
synapse normal rs1-ko retina; however, metabotropic glutamate
receptor 6/transient receptor potential melastatin subfamily member 1-signaling
(mglur6/trpm1-signaling) cascade properly maintained. specifically, the
trpm1 channel g proteins gαo, gβ5, rgs11 progressively lost from
postsynaptic dbc dendritic tips, whereas mglur6 receptor rgs7 maintained 
proper synaptic position. postsynaptic disruption differed murine
night-blindness models electronegative electroretinogram response, 
is also characteristic murine human xlrs disease. upon aav8-rs1 gene
transfer retina adult xlrs mice, trpm1 signaling molecules
returned proper dendritic tip location, dbc resting membrane
potential restored. findings provide insight molecular
plasticity critical synapse visual system demonstrate potential
therapeutic avenues diseases involving synaptic pathology.
