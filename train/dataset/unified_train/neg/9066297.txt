concentration effects methylene blue (mb) oxygen photoinactivation 
rate q beta bacteriophage examined. effect initial virus
concentration verified similar f2 phage. inactivation rate, kappa,
is increasing function mb o2 concentration shows saturation with
respect mb concentration. thus results suggest mb must adsorb q
beta sites oxygen must present photoinactivation occur. the
inactivation rate independent initial number phage particles present
before inactivation, indicating inactivation depend upon
interaction among viral particles surface effects. results indicate
that least two different viral phenotypes exist within wild-type q beta
and f2 populations: one susceptible resistant.
