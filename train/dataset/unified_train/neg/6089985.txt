prevalence rotavirus coronavirus antigens feces normal cows.

crouch cf, acres sd.

the prevalence rotavirus coronavirus shedding adult cows was
investigated using capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. fecal samples from
121 cows single herd tested presence rotavirus and
coronavirus, either free complexed immunoglobulin. free rotavirus not
detected samples rotavirus-immunoglobulin complexes detected in
53 121 (44%) samples tested. contrast, free coronavirus detected six
(5%) samples coronavirus-immunoglobulin complexes detected 85 (70%)
of samples tested. thus appears subclinical infection cows by
either viruses common, possibly providing source infection of
the neonate. assays may therefore provide important information regarding
the epidemiology enteric virus infections suggest means improving
management prevent epidemics neonatal diarrhea.
