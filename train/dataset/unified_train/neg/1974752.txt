objective: determine time relation viral burden and
immunologic decline patients asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv) infection.
design: blind analysis cell samples matched cohorts hiv proviral dna 
by polymerase chain reaction, retrospective analysis clinical data on
patients, prospective follow-up patients seropositive human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1).
setting: national research clinic academic medical centers.
patients: cohort 1 included 12 healthy hiv-1-seropositive patients (average
follow-up, 14 months): six patients stable disease 6 developed rapidly
progressive disease. cohort 2 included 15 healthy hiv-1-seropositive patients
from multi-center aids cohort study (average follow-up, 32 months): eight
patients stable disease 7 developed rapidly progressive disease.
laboratory studies: quantitative polymerase chain reaction done determine 
the hiv-1 viral burden sort-purified cd4+ cells obtained patients at
various timepoints.
measurements main results: patients remained asymptomatic, frequencies
of hiv-infected cd4+ cells low (less 1/10,000 1/1000) study
entry increased minimally (none higher 1/1000). contrast, among 
patients developed hiv-related symptoms including acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (aids) despite similar cd4 counts, frequencies
of hiv-infected cd4+ cells higher entry (greater 1/1000) and
increased substantially (greater 1/100) within 3 months of
developing progressive disease. increase hiv burden coincided a
significant decline time percent t4 cells (31% 16%), whereas
the percent t4 cells unchanged persons remained asymptomatic (33%
to 34%).
conclusions: increasing viral burden peripheral blood cd4+ t-cells directly
associated progressive decline cd4+ cells deteriorating clinical 
course hiv-infected patients.
