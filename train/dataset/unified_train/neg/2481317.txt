we used technique reverse transcription coupled polymerase
chain reaction detect mrna precursors [heterogeneous nuclear rna (hnrna)]
transcribed thymidine kinase (tk) gene human diploid fibroblasts.
with method, amplification products hnrna (containing the
introns) mature mrna detected southern blots appropriate
hybridization probes. experimental conditions used, sensitivity of
the technique tk mrna detected 20 s-phase cells.
tk hnrna maximally expressed early phase cell cycle after
quiescent human fibroblasts stimulated proliferate. point, the
ratio tk hnrna tk mrna 1:155. small amount tk hnrna detected
in populations cells appear quiescent. however, presence the
precursor populations correlates number cells still cycling.
no tk hnrna detected truly quiescent human diploid fibroblasts,
suggesting cells, tk gene transcribed g0.
