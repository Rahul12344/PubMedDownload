the efficacy sodium lauryl sulfate (sls), sulfated anionic chaotropic
surfactant, dextran sulfate (ds), polysulfated carbohydrate, herpes
simplex virus (hsv) human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infections was
evaluated cultured cells different murine models hsv infection.
results showed sls ds potent inhibitors infectivities
of various hsv-1 hsv-2 strains. pretreatment hiv-1 (strain nl4-3) sls
also reduced infectivity 1g5 cells. ds prevented binding hsv to
cell surface receptors therefore entry cells. pretreatment hsv-1 
(strain f) 50 microm sls resulted complete loss virus infectivity to
vero cells. however, viruses able enter cells produce 
nuclei capsid shells devoid dna core. amount glycoprotein gene 
produced cells remained unchanged compared controls, suggesting 
sls could interfere maturation virus. higher sls
concentration (100 microm), hsv highly damaged sls pretreatment a
few viral particles could enter cells produce abnormal capsids. although 
ds potent inhibitor hsv infectivity vitro, unable to
provide protection murine models hsv infection. however, sls conferred 
a complete protection animals infected cutaneously pretreated viruses. in
addition, skin pretreatment mice polymer formulation containing sls
completely prevented development cutaneous lesions. interestingly,
intravaginal pretreatment mice sls buffered solution also completely
protected lethal hsv-2 infection. taken together, results suggest
that sls could thus represent candidate choice microbicide prevent
the sexual transmission hiv, hsv, possibly pathogens cause
sexually transmitted diseases.
