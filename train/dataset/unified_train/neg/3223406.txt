infection balb/c mice rlv-a virus normally induces erythropoietic 
dysplasia characterized hepatosplenomegaly, erythroblastosis, erythroblastemia
and severe anemia without reticulocytosis. time death varies 20-30
weeks. mice inoculated rlv-a hypertransfused 75%
packed red cells 42 days shown eliminate erythropoiesis and
modify microenvironment favor granulopoiesis. following rlv-a inoculation,
one group receive transfusion (short-term) another group
continued hypertransfusion weekly (long-term). pathogenesis rlv-a 
the short-term group paralleled characteristic rlv-a response. the
long-term group however, characteristic rlv-a response never observed.
instead, granulocytic leukemia developed. continued hypertransfusion
presumably establishment altered microenvironment resulted a
completely different viral pathogenesis development transplantable
myeloid leukemia.
