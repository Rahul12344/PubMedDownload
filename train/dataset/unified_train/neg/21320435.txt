a theory calculating proton flux influenza virus m2 channel
is tested extensive set conductance data. flux is
determined rate constants binding his(37) tetrad two
sides membrane corresponding unbinding rate constants. rate
constants calculated explicitly treating structure dynamics the
protein. important features revealed previous studies, gating role
for val(27) entrance channel pore, channel activation viral 
exterior ph, incorporated theory. study demonstrates the
conductance function m2 proton channel quantitatively
rationalized structure dynamics protein.
