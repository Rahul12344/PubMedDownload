elephant endotheliotropic herpesviruses (eehvs) cause lethal hemorrhagic
disease african asian elephants. least seven eehv types 
described, sensitive real-time pcr tests developed eehv1a and
1b, associated majority characterized asian elephant
deaths. despite growing knowledge different eehv types, prevalence 
each type within african asian elephants remains determined there
is considerable need diagnostic tests detect discriminate each
eehv species clinical management african asian elephants develop 
illness one viruses. begin address issues, we
developed real-time pcr assays eehv2, 3, 4, 5, 6. overall, assay had
robust pcr efficiency, dynamic linear range 5log(10) concentrations, a
limit detection 10 copies/test reaction 100% sensitivity, low
intra- inter-assay variability. assay proved specific eehv
targets designed, exception eehv3 eehv4, which
was expected greater dna sequence similarity two eehv
species others. new tools useful conducting surveys of
eehv prevalence within captive range country elephants, diagnostic
testing elephants suspected eehv-associated disease, managing the
treatment elephants eehv-induced illness.
