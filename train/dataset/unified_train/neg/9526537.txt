we sequenced nib coding region sugarcane mosaic potyvirus strain sc
(scmv-sc) eight field isolates scmv australia. region comprised 
1563 nucleotides encoded putative protein 521 amino acids containing the
consensus motif gdd. protease cleavage sites nia/nib the
nib/coat protein found q/c q/a, respectively. scmv sequences
were similar sorghum mosaic potyvirus identities 70% 78% at
the nucleotide amino acid levels, respectively. sequences were
compared other, maximum 3.3% variation isolates at
the nucleotide level maximum 0.8% amino acid level. phylogenetic 
analysis sequences indicated field isolates grouped according 
their geographical location. scmv sequence homology other
isolates selected generate constructs replicase-mediated
resistance.
