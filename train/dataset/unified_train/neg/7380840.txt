the mrna coding pre-prolactin (pprl) adult bovine anterior pituitary
was purified 85% homogeneity used template cdna synthesis with
reverse transcriptase avian myeloblastosis virus. cdna sequences
complementary pprl mrna purified employing limited
back-hybridization step treatment s1 nuclease. pprl cdna preparation
was judged homogeneous comparing hybridization kinetics 
ovalbumin globin mrna standards thermal melt analysis pprl
mrna:cdna hybrids. total cellular rna extracted individual bovine fetal 
pituitaries either sex, ranging 90 200 days gestation, examined
for pprl mrna concentration hybridization excess pprl cdna. the
hybridization assay capable detecting picogram amounts pprl mrna, e.g. 
amounts less 0.002% input total cellular rna. results indicated
that 90 200 days gestation, levels pprl mrna relative total 
cellular rna bovine fetal pituitaries increase exponentially. increase in
pprl mrna occurs extent either sex, dramatic shift
(over 10-fold) occurring 120 145 days gestation.
