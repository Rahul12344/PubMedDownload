new human norovirus strains emerge every 2 3 years, partly due mutations in
the viral capsid allow escape antibody neutralization herd
immunity. understand noroviruses evolve antibody resistance, we
investigated structural basis escape murine norovirus (mnv) from
antibody neutralization. identify specific residues mnv-1 protruding
(p) domain capsid play role escape neutralizing
monoclonal antibody (mab) a6.2, 22 recombinant mnvs generated amino
acid substitutions a'b' e'f' loops. six mutations e'f' loop
(v378f, a382k, a382p, a382r, d385g, l386f) mediated escape mab a6.2
neutralization. elucidate underlying structural mechanisms results, 
the atomic structure a6.2 fab determined fitted the
previously generated pseudoatomic model a6.2 fab/mnv-1 virion complex.
previously, two distinct conformations, b, atomic structures 
mnv-1 p domain identified due flexibility two p domain loops. a
superior stereochemical fit a6.2 fab conformation mnv p
domain observed. structural analysis observed escape mutants indicates
changes toward less-preferred b conformation p domain. shift in
the structural equilibrium p domain toward conformation poor
structural complementarity antibody strongly supports unique mechanism
for antibody escape occurs via antigen flexibility instead direct
antibody-antigen binding.importance: human noroviruses cause majority 
nonbacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. new epidemic strains arise part by
mutations viral capsid leading escape antibody neutralization.
herein, identify series point mutations norovirus capsid that
mediate escape antibody neutralization determine structure a
neutralizing antibody. fitting antibody structure virion/antibody
complex identifies two conformations antibody binding domain viral 
capsid: one superior fit inferior fit the
antibody. data suggest unique mode antibody neutralization. in
contrast viruses largely escape antibody neutralization through
direct disruption antibody-virus interface, identify mutations that
acted indirectly limiting conformation antibody binding loop the
viral capsid drive antibody binding domain conformation unable
to bound antibody.
