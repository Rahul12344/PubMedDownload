extensive evidence available show human cd36 antigen a
cellular receptor thrombospondin, collagen, modified low-density
lipoproteins, long-chain fatty acids. moreover, cd36 functions one 
receptors mediates adhesion plasmodium-falciparum-infected
erythrocytes microvascular endothelium. attempt identify new
functional sites surface glycoprotein, anti-cd36 monoclonal antibodies
were prepared using vaccinia cd36 recombinant virus highly efficient
immunization vector. functional studies, one antibodies (clone 10/5) 
strongly inhibited adhesion p. falciparum-infected erythrocytes to
purified cd36. antibody also potentiated adp-induced platelet activation. in
contrast, second antibody (clone 13/10) affect cytoadherence of
infected erythrocytes platelet functions. previous structural work performed
on antibodies shown clone 10/5 directed epitope
within cd36 domain 155-183, whereas clone 13/10 interacts another
antigenic determinant defined amino acids 30-76 [daviet, l., buckland, r.,
puente navazo, m. d. & mcgregor, j. l. (1995) biochem. j. 305, 221-224]. taken
together, current studies show that: (a) methodology immunization
using recombinant vaccinia virus powerful tool generation of
monoclonal antibodies directed polyimmunogenic membrane glycoproteins
such cd36; (b) cd36 domain, recognized clone 10/5 13/10, 
functionnally important regarding adhesion p. falciparum-infected
erythrocyte cd36-dependent platelet activation.
