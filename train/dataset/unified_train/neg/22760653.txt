progression cirrhosis occurs faster whereas response to
peginterferon/ribavirin therapy lower patients chronic hepatitis c
coinfected human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), compared hepatitis c 
virus (hcv) monoinfected individuals. use antiretroviral therapy may
ameliorate poor outcomes hiv/hcv coinfected patients. however, best
scenario peginterferon/ribavirin therapy provides cure 30% patients
harboring hcv genotypes 1 4 70% hcv genotypes 2 3 carriers, a
rate lower seen hcv monoinfection. moreover, substantial
proportion hiv/hcv coinfected patients treated due to
contraindications, complete therapy due serious adverse events, or
just wish receive poorly tolerated medication. these
reasons, advent direct acting antivirals (daa) eagerly awaited
for treating hiv/hcv coinfected patients. however, new challenges arisen,
including potential harmful drug interactions antiretroviral agents,
poor drug adherence due polymedication, increased risk selection of
drug-resistant hcv mutants, unaffordable coverage environment of
economic constraints. use noninvasive tools measure liver fibrosis
(i.e., elastometry) pharmacogenomics (testing il28b perhaps itpa
polymorphisms), along consideration early viral kinetics guide length 
and drugs needed could help individualize improve cost effectiveness
of therapeutic decisions using daa hiv-infected patients chronic
hepatitis c.
