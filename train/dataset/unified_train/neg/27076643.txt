infection adenovirus, nonenveloped dna virus, induces antiviral innate and
adaptive immune responses. studies transformed human murine cell lines
using short hairpin rna (shrna) knockdown strategies identified cyclic guanine
adenine synthase (cgas) pattern recognition receptor (prr) contributes 
to antiadenovirus response. demonstrate cgas/sting cascade
influences antiviral innate adaptive immune responses murine
knockout model. using knockout bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (bmdcs) and
bone marrow-derived macrophages (bmmos), determined cgas sting are
essential induction antiadenovirus response these
antigen-presenting cells (apcs) vitro next determined cgas/sting
cascade impacts antiviral response following systemic administration a
recombinant adenovirus type 5 vector (rad5v). infection cgas(-/-) and
sting(-/-) mice results compromised early antiviral innate response compared
to wild-type (wt) controls: significantly lower levels beta interferon
(ifn-β) secretion, low levels proinflammatory chemokine induction, reduced
levels antiviral transcript induction hepatic tissue. 24 h
postinfection, levels viral dna reporter gene expression liver were
similar strains. 28 days postinfection, clearance infected
hepatocytes cgas sting knockout mice comparable wt c57bl/6
mice. levels neutralizing anti-ad5v antibody modestly reduced infected
cgas mice. data support dominant role cgas/sting cascade the
early innate antiviral inflammatory response adenovirus vectors. however, loss
of cgas/sting pathway affect viral clearance, cgas deficiency had
a modest influence magnitude antiviral humoral immune response to
adenovirus infections.importance: detection viral infection host
sentinel immune cells contributes activation complex varied
antiviral innate adaptive immune response, limits virus replication,
spread, susceptibility infection. study, characterized how
the cgas/sting dna-sensing cascade contributes early detection adenovirus
infections. cgas influences apc activation early innate antiviral
inflammatory immune responses, adaptive immune pathways associated virus
clearance anti-ad antibody production minimally influenced loss
of cgas prr signaling cascade.
