measles virus (mv) tropism restricted humans primates uses the
human cd46 molecule cellular receptor. mv adapted grow in
chicken embryonic fibroblasts (cef) gave rise attenuated live vaccine. 
hallé schwarz mv strains compared ability infect simian
vero cells cef. whereas strains infected vero cells, the
cef-adapted schwarz strain able efficiently infect cef. since the
expression human mv receptor cd46 rendered chicken embryonic cell line
tcf permissive infection hallé mv strain, mv entry into
cef appeared limiting step absence prior mv adaptation. cef
lacked reactivity anti-cd46 antibodies found express another
protein allowing mv binding alternative receptor cd46.
