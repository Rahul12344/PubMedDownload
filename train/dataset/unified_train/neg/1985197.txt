the v3 loop, located near middle surface envelope glycoprotein gp120, 
is major neutralizing domain human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1). 
although majority v3 loop highly variable different strains
of hiv-1, gly-pro-gly-arg motif tip loop highly conserved. 
determine whether region plays role fusion mediated hiv-1
envelope glycoproteins, introduced seven single-amino-acid changes v3
loop. mutant envelope glycoproteins expressed hiv-1 envelope
expression vector analyzed ability induce cell fusion the
absence virus replication. results indicated single-amino-acid
changes v3 loop capable completely abolishing greatly reducing 
the ability hiv-1 envelope glycoproteins induce cell fusion, thereby
identifying v3 loop fusion domain hiv-1. mutations highly
conserved tip loop nonconserved region flanking highly
conserved tip effect envelope glycoprotein synthesis, processing,
transport, binding cd4 receptor molecule. mutation putative
disulfide bridge-forming cys residue 336 blocked gp160 cleavage cd4
binding.
