the selection chromosomal targets retroviral integration varies markedly, 
tracking genus retrovirus, suggestive targeting binding 
cellular factors. Î³-retroviral murine leukemia virus (mlv) dna integration into
the host genome favored transcription start sites, underlying
mechanism preference unknown. here, identified bromodomain
and extraterminal domain (bet) proteins (brd2, -3, -4) cellular-binding
partners mlv integrase. show purified recombinant brd4(1-720) binds
with high affinity mlv integrase stimulates correct concerted integration 
in vitro. jq-1, small molecule selectively inhibits interactions bet
proteins modified histone sites impaired mlv hiv-1 integration in
infected cells. comparison distribution bet protein-binding sites
analyzed using chip-seq data mlv-integration sites revealed significant
positive correlations. antagonism bet proteins, via jq-1 treatment rna
interference, reduced mlv-integration frequencies transcription start sites.
these findings elucidate importance bet proteins mlv integration
efficiency targeting provide route developing safer mlv-based
vectors human gene therapy.
