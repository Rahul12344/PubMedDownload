retinoic acid-inducible gene (rig-i)-like receptors (rlrs) recently been
identified cytoplasmic sensors rna virus. recent research shown that
rig-i, member family, play important role innate immunity. in
this study, cloned rig-i gene jinding duck reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) rapid amplification cdna ends (race).
we determined cdna durig-i contains 14-bp 5' utr, 2802-bp open
reading frame, alternative 3' utrs (295-bp 927-bp) encodes a
polypeptide 933 amino acids. based sequence, durig-i protein is
predicted conserved domains typical rlrs. addition, durig-i was
found distributed throughout df1 cells indirect immunofluorescence, as
predicted. durig-i mrna scarcely detected healthy tissues by
semi-quantitative rt-pcr (sqrt-pcr). study role rig-i innate
immunity, used synthetic double-stranded rna mimic viral infection vivo 
and detected durig-i transcripts spleen liver quantitative real-time
pcr (qrt-pcr). expression durig-i mrna significantly elevated 8h
post-injection (p < 0.05) indistinguishable control levels 
time points (p > 0.05). results suggest durig-i plays important
role innate immune responses double-stranded rna viruses warrant
further studies reveal possible mechanism.
