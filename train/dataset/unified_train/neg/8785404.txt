recent studies showed contradictory results concerning efficacy oral
acyclovir prevention amelioration cytomegalovirus (cmv) disease
after renal transplantation (tx). study evaluated incidence severity
of cmv disease within first year tx high-risk renal transplant
recipients (cmv-seropositive donor, seronegative recipient) treated
prophylactically oral acyclovir (800 3200 mg/day) period 12 wk 
(acy, n = 22), compared high-risk patients randomly assigned controls
(co, n = 10). follow-up cmv infection included serological determination of
cmv-specific immunoglobulin g immunoglobulin antibodies, antigen detection 
in peripheral blood leukocytes (pp 65), shell vial culture (blood), virus
isolation/early antigen detection (urine). severity cmv disease quantified
by scoring system cmv-related symptoms. nine patients (40.1%) the
acyclovir group four patients (40%) control group developed cmv
disease. neither severity (acy, 11.4 versus co; 12.5 points score), duration 
of disease (acy, 21 days; co, 22 days), transplant function end the
observation period differed significantly. onst cmv disease not
delayed significantly acyclovir-treated patients compared controls (acy, 
47 +/- 34 days versus co, 27 +/- 14 days tx, significant). results 
show beneficial effect oral acyclovir prophylaxis cmv high-risk renal
transplant recipients.
