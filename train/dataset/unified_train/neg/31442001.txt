background: paucity data evaluating antibiotic use anterior
skull-base surgery (asbs). goal study determine antibiotic
prescribing patterns factors influence antibiotic use asbs.
methods: online-based survey distributed membership north
american skull base society 2018. outcomes included practitioner preference
regarding intraoperative postoperative antibiotic use, practice location 
environment, surgeon experience, patient factors influencing antibiotic use.
results: 208 respondents (25.6% response rate) 182 (87.5%)
performed asbs; 60.4% academic institutions. respondents were
neurosurgeons (59.3%) otolaryngologists (40.7%), 75.3% were
fellowship-trained asbs. surgeons (95.0%) gave intraoperative
antibiotics. academic surgeons 4 times likely prescribe
intraoperative antibiotics private practitioners (odds ratio [or] 3.98; 95% 
confidence interval [ci], 1.53 10.36; p = 0.005). among surgeons not
routinely prescribe intraoperative antibiotics, regression analysis indicated
that presence actively infected sinuses, transplantation, diabetes, human 
immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (hiv/aids), and
pulmonary disease influenced decision-making (p < 0.03). postoperative
antibiotics prescribed 73.6% respondents. european surgeons 3
times less likely prescribe postoperative antibiotics (or 0.34; 95% ci, 0.15
to 0.80; p = 0.01). regression modeling indicated hiv/aids, cystic fibrosis,
diabetes, transplantation, pulmonary disease, well use of
absorbable packing influenced decision use postoperative antibiotics (p < 
0.003).
conclusion: study demonstrates significant variation intra- and
postoperative antibiotic use among surgeons performing asbs. prospective
randomized studies necessary establish evidence-based practice guidelines 
for perioperative antibiotic use asbs.
