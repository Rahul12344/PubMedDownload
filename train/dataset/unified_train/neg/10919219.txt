the five available p24 ag/anti-hiv combined tests compared six
third-generation anti-hiv assays mainly used blood transfusion centers. among 
70 selected hiv-1 positive samples (12 samples early infected blood donors
and 58 ten commercial panels), 59 positive least one assay.
false negative results observed zero six samples p24 ag/ab
assays versus seven 19 antibody (ab) tests. five cases, one more
combined assays gave positive signal later sensitive ab screening
test. one sample high p24 ag titer missed one combined test. the
mean time delay sensitive test second one 0.3 2
days. p24 ag limit detection investigated seven dilutions 
hiv ag reference. threshold p24 ag detection found between
65 250 pg/ml hiv ag. four five combined assays, p24 ag
detectability assessed dilutions infected culture cell supernatants
from 13 hiv-1 different genotype strains exhibiting hiv ag titers 300 450
pg/ml. one four combined assays gave negative results close the
cut-off three supernatant dilutions (1 b, 1 f, 1 hiv-1/o) one missed 
hiv-1/o dilution. p24 ag/ab combined assays permit earlier diagnosis of
hiv infection third generation assays even yield terms of
reduction window period moderate. less sensitive p24 ag
screening assays detection marker. consequently, p24 ag/ab
assays used diagnosis primary infection instead p24
ag screening tests. must considered good tools detection 
of hiv infection.
