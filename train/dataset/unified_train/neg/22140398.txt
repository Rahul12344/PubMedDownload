this review focuses current developments field nanostructured bulk
polymers application bioengineering therapeutic sciences. in
contrast well-established nanoscale materials, nanoparticles and
nanofibers, bulk nanostructured polymers combine nanoscale structure a
macroscopic construct, enables unique application materials.
contemporary fabrication processing techniques capable producing
nanoporous polymer films reviewed. focus placed techniques capable of
sub-100 nm features since range approaches size scale biological
components, proteins viruses. attributes techniques 
compared, emphasis characteristic advantages limitations of
each method. finally, application materials biofiltration,
immunoisolation, drug delivery reviewed.
