background: fractalkine/cx3cl1 cognate receptor cx3cr1 abundantly
expressed cns. fractalkine unusual c-x3-c motif chemokine is
important neuron-microglial communication, co-receptor hiv infection,
and neuroprotective. assess effects fractalkine opiate-hiv
interactive neurotoxicity, wild-type murine striatal neurons co-cultured
with mixed glia striata wild-type cx3cr1 knockout mice ± hiv-1 tat
and/or morphine. time-lapse digital images continuously recorded 20 min
intervals 72 h using computer-aided microscopy track cells 
repeatedly.
results: co-exposure tat morphine caused synergistic increases neuron
death, dendritic pruning, microglial motility previously reported.
exogenous fractalkine prevented synergistic tat morphine-induced dendritic
losses neuron death even though inflammatory mediator tnf-α remained
significantly elevated. antibody blockade cx3cr1 mimicked toxic effects of
morphine plus tat, add toxicity; fractalkine failed to
protect wild-type neurons co-cultured cx3cr1-/--null glia morphine
and tat toxicity. exogenous fractalkine also normalized microglial motility,
which elevated tat morphine co-exposure, presumably limiting microglial
surveillance may lead toxic effects neurons. fractalkine
immunofluorescence expressed neurons lesser extent cell 
types, whereas cx3cr1 immunoreactivity gfp fluorescence cells cultured from
the striatum cx3cr1-/- (cx3cr1gfp/gfp) mice associated microglia.
immunoblotting shows fractalkine levels unchanged following tat and/or 
morphine exposure increase released fractalkine determined
by elisa. contrast, cx3cr1 protein levels markedly downregulated.
conclusions: results suggest deficits fractalkine-cx3cr1 signaling
contribute synergistic neurotoxic effects opioids tat. importantly,
exogenous fractalkine selectively protect neurons injurious effects 
of chronic opioid-hiv-1 tat co-exposure, suggests potential
therapeutic course neuroaids. although cellular mechanisms underlying
neuroprotection certain, findings exogenous fractalkine reduces
microglial motility fails protect neurons co-cultured cx3cr1-/- mixed
glia suggest fractalkine may act interfering toxic microglial-neuron
interactions.
