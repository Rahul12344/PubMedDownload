the complete nucleotide sequence genomic rna korean isolate of
cymbidium mosaic virus (cymmv-k2) determined. genomic rna 6227
nucleotides length, excluding poly(a) tail. contains 5'-noncoding
region (ncr) 73 nucleotides, five open reading frames (orfs 1 5) which
encode proteins m(r) 160 kda rna-dependent rna polymerase (orf1), 26 kda
movement protein 1 (orf2), 13 kda movement protein 2 (orf3), 10 kda movement
protein 3 (orf4), 24 kda coat protein (ofr5), 3' ncr 76 nucleotides. the
5'-end cymmv-k2 genome initiates ggaaaa contrasts gaaaa at
the 5'-ends potexviruses, including singapore isolate cymmv
(cymmv-s2). compared cymmv-s2, 171 base substitutions observed 
the cymmv-k2 genome. substitutions overlapping orfs (orfs 2 4) occurred
more frequently 5' ncr, orf1, 3' ncr. addition to
substitutions, two single-base deletions, one intercistronic region
between orf1 orf2 orf2, found cymmv-k2
genome. deletion orf2 induced frameshift altered the
c-terminal domain movement protein 1. orf3 orf4 cymmv-k2 genome are
partially different another singapore cymmv genome (cymmv-s1) which
has four frameshifts due nucleotide deletions within orfs.
interestingly, frameshifts resulted change conserved sequences
of movement proteins reconstructed transmembrane domains.
