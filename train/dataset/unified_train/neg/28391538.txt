respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) prophylaxis high-risk infants an
effective intervention prevention severe disease. aim this
study determine ideal target preterm population might benefit
from palivizumab prophylaxis establishing main risk factors acute
rsv-related infections. former premature infants born gestational age
≤37 weeks ≤1 year age beginning rsv season admitted with
respiratory infection included. rsv status evaluated rsv strip test
in infants. rsv-positive -negative infants compared terms of
demographic features, risk factors, requirement hospitalisation and
palivizumab administration. total 202 preterm infants 1 year age
were enrolled. rsv test positive 34 (16.8%) infants. maternal age 
significantly lower rsv-positive infants compared rsv-negative infants
(p = 0.03). rsv-positive infants found significantly discharged during
the rsv season (p = 0.03). rsv-positive infants required significantly higher
rates hospitalisation need mechanical ventilation. rsv-positive
infants, 28 (82%) gestational age ≥29 weeks. seventeen (77%) rsv-positive
infants required hospitalisation ≥29 weeks gestation. infants
with gestational age ≥29 weeks without palivizumab prophylaxis developed
rsv infection. palivizumab prophylaxis implemented guidelines to
cover preterm infants gestational age >29 weeks. palivizumab prophylaxis
should also considered high-risk infants ≤6 months age rsv
season.
