the hepatitis c virus (hcv) rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) plays an
essential role replication hcv key target novel antiviral 
therapies. several rdrp inhibitors clinical trials increased
response rates combined current interferon-based therapies genotype
1 (g1) hcv patients. inhibitors, however, show poor efficacy non-g1
genotypes, including g3a, represents ~20% hcv cases globally. here, we
used commercially available fluorescent dye characterize g3a hcv rdrp in
vitro. rdrp activity assessed via synthesis double-stranded rna the
single-stranded rna poly(c) template. assay miniaturized 384-well
microplate format pilot high-throughput screen conducted using 10,208
"lead-like" compounds, randomly selected identify inhibitors hcv g3a rdrp. 
of 150 compounds demonstrating greatest inhibition, 10 confirmed using 
fluorescent radioactive assays. top two inhibitors (hac001 hac002)
demonstrated specific activity, ic(50) 12.7 µm 1.0 µm,
respectively. conclusion, describe simple, fluorescent-based
high-throughput screening (hts) identification inhibitors de novo
rdrp activity, using hcv g3a rdrp target. hts system could used
against positive-sense rna virus cannot cultured.
