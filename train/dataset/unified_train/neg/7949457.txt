recent advances made treatment chronic viral hepatitis,
mainly recombinant interferon (ifn) alpha. however, present treatment of
chronic viral hepatitis entirely satisfactory efficacy is
inconstant and/or incomplete. chronic hepatitis b ifn-alpha induces a
sustained interruption hepatitis b virus (hbv) replication, hbeag to
anti-hbe seroconversion 30% patients. patients likely respond
are immunosuppression, hbv infection acquired adulthood or
active liver disease low hbv replication. responders usually show a
significant decrease serum hbv dna levels first 2 months of
therapy, followed significant increase level aminotransferases.
new nucleoside analogues might useful combination ifn-alpha the
treatment respond ifn therapy. chronic hepatitis b-d,
the rate sustained response ifn-alpha therapy low. effective,
ifn-alpha must used high dosage (9-10 mega units) long duration (1
year). chronic hepatitis c, ifn-alpha dosage 3 mega units 6
months, induces sustained response 20% patients. higher dosage of
ifn (5-10 mega units) longer duration treatment increases rate of
sustained response associated poor tolerance. non-responders a
first course ifn respond second course treatment. patients
who respond relapse treatment, rate sustained response a
second course ifn needs assessed. ribavirin, significant
antiviral effect hepatitis c virus, might useful combination with
ifn-alpha. dosage (3-6 mega units) usually used, ifn-alpha relatively
well tolerated. 10% patients therapy interrupted, mainly
because severe fatigue, thyroid dysfunction depression.
