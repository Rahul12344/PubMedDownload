setting: pulmonary tuberculosis (tb) patients reported north carolina (nc),
usa, 1996 2008 (inclusive).
objective: compare prevalence cavitary tb surrogate marker for
advanced disease low-caseload counties high-caseload counties.
design: multivariate log binomial regression model used estimate
prevalence ratios (prs) cavitary tb.
results: proportion tb cases low-caseload counties vs. total number
of tb cases nc study period increased 10% 1996 20% in
2008. adjusting human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) status, excess
alcohol use report year, patients rural areas low-caseload counties had
greater prevalence (pr 1.40, 95%ci 1.19-1.64) cavitary disease compared with
patients rural areas high-caseload counties. prevalence cavitary
tb differ urban residents high- low-caseload counties (pr
1.00, 95%ci 0.86-1.16) adjusting hiv status, excess alcohol use and
report year.
discussion: tb patients rural areas low-caseload counties presented with
more advanced tb disease compared patients urban and/or high-caseload
counties. barriers timely recognition tb rural low-caseload settings
must considered tb control programs.
