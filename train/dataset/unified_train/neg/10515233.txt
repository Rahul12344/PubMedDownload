previous studies demonstrated transgenic mice overexpressing human
neurofilament heavy (hnf-h) protein develop progressive motor neuron disease
characterized perikaryal accumulations neurofilaments resembling 
found amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als). investigate this
neurofilament-induced pathology, generated transgenic mice expressing, solely 
or concomitantly, hnf-h human neurofilament light (hnf-l) proteins.
we report motor neuron disease caused excess hnf-h proteins 
be rescued overexpression hnf-l dosage-dependent fashion. hnf-h
transgenic mice, additional hnf-l led reduction perikaryal swellings,
relief axonal transport defect restoration axonal radial growth. gene
delivery approach based recombinant adenoviruses bearing hnf-l gene also
demonstrated possibility reduce perikaryal swellings formation
in adult mice. finding extra nf-l protect nf-h-mediated
pathogenesis potential importance als, particularly cases nf-h
abnormalities.
