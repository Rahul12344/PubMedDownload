the regulation cancerous tumor development converged upon multiple
pathways factors. besides environmental factors, gastrointestinal (gi) tract 
cancer caused chronic inflammation, generally induced by
bacteria, viruses, parasites. role inducers cancer
development, cell differentiation transformation, cell cycle deregulation,
and expression tumor-associated genes cannot ignored. although
helicobacter pylori activates many oncogenic pathways, particularly in
gastric colorectal cancers, role viruses tumor development also 
significant. viruses possess significant oncogenic potential interfere with
normal cell cycle control genome stability, stimulating growth of
deregulated cells. increasing amount recent data also implies the
association gi cancers bacterial colonization viruses. review
focuses host-cell interactions facilitate primary mechanisms of
tumorigenesis provides new insights novel gi cancer treatments.
