ebola virus disease (evd) caused ebola virus (ebov) characterized in
humans hemorrhagic fever high fatality rates. human-to-human ebov
transmission occurs physical contact infected body fluids, indirectly 
by contaminated surfaces. sexual transmission route infection only
recently documented despite isolating ebov virus genome semen since
1976. data dissemination ebov survivors remain limited ebov
pathogenesis humans following sexual transmission unknown. vitro
antiviral efficacy polyphenylene carboxymethylene (ppcm) ebov was
investigated considering limited countermeasures available block infection
through sexual intercourse. ppcm vaginal topical contraceptive microbicide
shown prevent sexual transmission hiv, herpes virus, bacterial
infections several different models. demonstrate antiviral
activity ebov. viral replication detected presence ppcm 
in cell culture, including vaginal epithelial (vk2/e6e7) cells. specifically,
ppcm reduced viral attachment cells interfering ebov glycoprotein, and
possibly binding cell surface glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate
important infection process. ebov-infected vk2/e6e7 cells found to
secrete type iii interferon (ifn), suggesting activation distinct prrs or
downstream signaling factors required type ii ifn. the
addition ppcm following cell infection prevented notably increase these
inflammation markers. therefore, ppcm could potentially used topical
microbicide reduce transmission ebov-positive survivors sexual
intercourse.
