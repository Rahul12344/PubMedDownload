in experimental study tested survival hog cholera virus (hcv)
contained pieces muscular tissue organs experimentally infected
swine incubation silage. big (diameter greater 20 cm) muscular
pieces hcv survived even excellent mineral acid silage (ph 3.8-4.0) a
storage 5 months. hand smaller parts (musculature tissue,
organs less 20 cm diameter) never found virulent hcv 3 months of
incubation. independent size tested organs find any
virulent hcv silage ph 5.2 3 months. results our
investigations show, feeding green silage areas hog cholera
among wild boar potential risk domestic swine population. in
conclusion propose feed green silage unvaccinated pigs areas
only storage 9 month.
