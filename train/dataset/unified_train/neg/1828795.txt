between 1980 1985, 16,000 immigrants ethiopia, population high
risk hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection, arrived israel. present study 
was designed provide epidemiological information necessary developing
prevention strategies hbv infection. among 144 subjects studied an
absorption center israel, 32% detectable hbv markers were
therefore susceptible infection. prevalence rate hbsag 19% compared
with 42% anti-hbs 7.6% anti-hbc alone. percentage subjects
with hbv marker decreased sharply age, similarly an
age-linked increase anti-hbs, indicating importance horizontal
transmission hbv infection. distribution hbv markers similar in
both sexes. evidence mild liver disease found three subjects. 
newborns new arrivals less 2 years age ethiopian community are
vaccinated hbv infection prevent vertical early horizontal
transmission. data obtained study suggest means of
prevention hbv infection insufficient. suggest vaccination of
all children aged 2-7 without prevaccination screening, vaccination of
children aged 8-18 found susceptible anti-hbc screening, would
substantially lower hbv transmission community.
