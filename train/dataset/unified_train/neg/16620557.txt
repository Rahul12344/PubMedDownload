objective: explore killing effect mutant herpes simplex virus
thymidine kinase (hsv-sr39tk) wild-type (hsv-tk) mediated lentiviral
vector lymphocytes vitro compare cell survival rate gcv or
acv treatment.
methods: three-plasmid lentiviral vector system including packaging plasmid
deltanrf, envelope plasmid vsv-g vector plasmid (ptk151 + hsv-sr39tk or
ptk151 + hsv-tk) cotransfected human embryonic kidney 293t cells using 
modified calcium phosphate precipitation methods. packaged virus was
harvested 72 h later. survival cells expressing hsv-sr39tk hsv-tk was
measured mtt assay 4 day-culture gradient gcv acv
concentrations.
results: three plasmids effectively cotransfected high titre of
lentivirus obtained (2 x 10(6) iu/ml). 39tk(+) cell survival rates declined
promptly prodrug gcv/acv concentrations increased 0 micromol/l to
10 micromol/l. cell survival rates gcv group declined (96.04 +/-
3.23)% (36.76 +/- 4.38)% acv group (97.31 +/- 4.61)% (43.75
+/- 8.99)%. however, gcv/acv concentrations 10 micromol/l,
further decline 39tk(+) cell survival rates became unobvious. growth
rate 39tk(+) cell exposed gcv acv obviously lower in
un-transfected cells (p < 0.05). tk(+) cells sensitive gcv (p <
0.05), acv (p > 0.05). significant difference killing
effects 39tk(+) cell + gcv group tk(+) cell + gcv group (p <
0.05).
conclusion: lentiviral vectors containing hsv-sr39tk gene could infect t
lymphocytes effectively stably without affecting proliferation the
transduced cell. contrast hsv-tk gene, cells infected hsv-sr39tk were
more sensitive gcv also acv.
