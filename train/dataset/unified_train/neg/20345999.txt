background: epidemiological studies point inverse relationship between
microbial exposure prevalence allergic diseases. underlying
mechanism observation remains largely unknown, well nature 
the microbes involved.
objective: investigate effects early infection human herpesviruses
(hhvs) ige formation t-helper type 2 (th2) development infants.
methods: serum collected children aged 18 months assessed ige to
common allergens igg five common herpesviruses. cord blood plasmacytoid
dendritic cells (pdc) exposed hhv type 6 vitro mixed with
allogeneic cord blood cd4(+) cells. cytokine levels determined elisa
and flow cytometry.
results: found children seropositive 18 months age hhv type 6
were significantly less often ige sensitized seronegative children [odds
ratio (or): 0.08, 95% confidence interval (ci): 0.009-0.68]. hhv type 6 also
decreased production th2-associated cytokines il-5 il-13 cd4(+)
t cells co-cultured allogeneic cord blood pdc. associated with
an increased production ifn-alpha pdc exposed hhv type 6.
conclusion: data indicate early childhood infection hhv type 6
could down-regulate th2 responses reduce ige formation common allergens in
a young child.
