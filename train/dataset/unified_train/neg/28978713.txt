hiv-1-infected macrophages participate virus dissemination establishment
of virus reservoirs host tissues, mechanisms virus cell-to-cell
transfer macrophages remain unknown. here, reveal mechanisms for
cell-to-cell transfer infected cells macrophages virus spreading
between macrophages. show contacts infected lymphocytes and
macrophages lead cell fusion fast massive transfer ccr5-tropic 
viruses macrophages. merge viral material cells and
macrophages, newly formed lymphocyte-macrophage fused cells acquire the
ability fuse neighboring noninfected macrophages. together, these
two-step envelope-dependent cell fusion processes lead formation highly
virus-productive multinucleated giant cells reminiscent infected
multinucleated giant macrophages detected hiv-1-infected patients simian
immunodeficiency virus-infected macaques. mechanisms represent original 
mode virus transmission viral spreading new model formation 
of macrophage virus reservoirs infection.importance reveal very
efficient mechanism involved cell-to-cell transfer infected cells to
macrophages subsequent virus spreading macrophages two-step cell
fusion process. infected cells first establish contacts fuse with
macrophage targets. newly formed lymphocyte-macrophage fused cells then
acquire ability fuse surrounding uninfected macrophages, leading to
the formation infected multinucleated giant cells survive long 
time, evidenced vivo lymphoid organs central nervous system.
this route infection may major determinant virus dissemination and
the formation macrophage virus reservoirs host tissues hiv-1
infection.
