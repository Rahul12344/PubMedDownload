zika virus (zikv), mosquito-borne flavivirus discovered 1947, only
recently caused large outbreaks emerged significant human pathogen. in
2015, zikv detected brazil, resulting epidemic spread
throughout western hemisphere. severe complications zikv infection
include neurological disorders guillain-barré syndrome adults a
variety fetal abnormalities, including microcephaly, blindness, placental
insufficiency, fetal demise. urgent need tools reagents
to study pathogenesis epidemic zikv testing vaccines and
antivirals. using reverse genetics platform, generated six zikv infectious
clones derivative viruses representing diverse temporal geographic
origins. include three versions mr766, prototype 1947 strain (with
and without glycosylation site envelope protein), h/pf/2013, 2013 
human isolate french polynesia representative virus introduced to
brazil. course synthesizing clone circulating brazilian strain, 
phylogenetic studies identified two distinct zikv clades brazil. we
reconstructed viable clones strains sph2015 beh819015, representing
ancestral members clade. assessed recombinant virus replication,
binding monoclonal antibodies, virulence mice. panel molecular 
clones recombinant virus isolates enable targeted studies viral
determinants pathogenesis, adaptation, evolution, well rational 
attenuation contemporary outbreak strains facilitate design vaccines
and therapeutics.importance viral emergence poorly understood process as
evidenced sudden emergence zika virus latin america the
caribbean. malleable reagents predate span expanding epidemic
are key understanding virologic determinants regulate pathogenesis
and transmission. generated representative cdna molecular clones and
recombinant viruses span known zikv family tree, including early
brazilian isolates. recombinant viruses replicated efficiently cell culture
and pathogenic immunodeficient mice, providing genetic platform for
rational vaccine therapeutic design.
