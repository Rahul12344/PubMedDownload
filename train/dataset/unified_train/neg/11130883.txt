mechanisms determining chronicity pattern clinical course of
hepatitis c virus (hcv) infections clarified. recently, cd81 was
reported bind e2 protein hcv suggested function a
cellular receptor hcv. accordingly, hypothesis examined cd81
polymorphism, exists, might correlate certain clinical courses hcv 
infection. cd81 cdna sequences determined peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (pbmcs). twenty-four japanese subjects enrolled initially follows: 
patients chronic hepatitis c without cirrhosis (n = 3), patients with
cirrhosis (n = 3), patients cirrhosis complicated hepatocellular
carcinoma (hcc) (n = 3), patients persistent hcv viremia without alt
elevation (n = 3), positive anti-hcv antibodies without evidence of
hcv viremia (n = 3), healthy volunteers (n = 9). pbmcs samples
analyzed, polymorphism found cd81 cdna sequence. sequence was
different, however, one reported previously three nucleotide
positions: transversion thymine instead cytosine nt 1130, deletion
at nt 1206, guanine insertion nt 71. subsequently, cd81 cdna sequences
from pbmcs hcc tissue compared among 6 patients chronic
hepatitis c bearing hcc. comparative study cd81 sequences hcc and
pbmcs revealed various nucleotide mutations existed hcc samples 
in 3 6 patients. several mutations 3' non-coding region cd81
cdna observed exclusively hcc tissue suggesting possible role in
hepatocarcinogenesis. absence polymorphisms, however, cd81 is
unlikely affect progression chronic hepatitis c terms chronicity,
hepatitis activity, disease stage.
