the objective study determine interleukin (il)-12 focus 
antigen specific type 1 immune response characterized activation th1
lymphocytes production igg2 antibodies vivo. saanen goats co-immunized 
with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing caprine il-12 (rrb-il12) the
caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus (caev) envelope (env) gene (rwr-63) were
evaluated development immune responses caev env encoded surface
glycoprotein (su). immune responses defined by: (i) su antibody titers; (ii)
the ratio su igg1 igg2 antibodies; (iii) interferon gamma (ifngamma) and
il-4 gene expression proliferative response su stimulated lymph node
mononuclear cells (lnmc). apart enhancement ifngamma il-4 gene
expression su stimulated lnmc, rrb-il12 affect immune response 
rwr-63 encoded su. thus, localized production exogenous species specific il-12
at site immunization focus initial priming antigen reactive th 
lymphocytes. results contrast previous studies using inbred mice 
and raise questions regarding use cytokine adjuvants focus immune
responses outbred animals.
