west nile virus (wnv; flavivirus; flaviviridae) cause most
widespread arthropod-borne viral disease world largest outbreak of
neuroinvasive disease ever observed. mosquito-borne outbreaks influenced by
intrinsic (e.g., vector viral genetics, vector host competence, vector
life-history traits) extrinsic (e.g., temperature, rainfall, human land use) 
factors affect virus activity mosquito biology complex ways. the
concept vectorial capacity integrates factors address interactions of
the virus arthropod host, leading clearer understanding their
complex interrelationships, affect transmission vector-borne disease,
and impact human health. vertebrate factors including host competence,
population dynamics, immune status also affect transmission dynamics. the
complexity interactions exacerbated fact not
only divergent hosts differentially alter virus, virus also can
affect vertebrate invertebrate hosts ways significantly alter
patterns virus transmission. chapter concentrates selected components 
of virus-vector-vertebrate interrelationship, focusing specifically how
interactions vector, virus, environment shape patterns and
intensity wnv transmission.
