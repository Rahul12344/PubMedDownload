gelatin-siloxane nanoparticles (gs nps) considered good gene
carrier candidate vitro, since several advantages low
toxicity, easy preparation surface modification. study, the
tat-peg-gs nps synthesized gelatin-siloxane, surface-modified with
the polyethylene glycol (h2 n-peg-cooh) tat peptide (kygrrrqrrkkrgc) thus
constructed delivery system cross bbb (blood-brain barrier). the
morphology, diameter, zeta potential tat-peg-gs nps carrier system were
characterized transmission electron microscopy (tem) nano-zs zetasizer
dynamic light scattering detector. organ distribution dynamic evolution
localized brain parenchyma tat-peg-gs nps vivo investigated with
cri vivo imaging system tem. obtained tat-peg-gs nps were
approximately spherical shape average particle size 150-200 nm and
zeta potentials (32.27 +/- 2.47) mv. vivo imaging results showed the
accumulation tat-peg-gs nps higher brain accumulation of
peg-gs nps, accumulation tat-peg-gs nps lower liver than
the accumulation peg-gs nps. differences statistically significant. 
the nanocomplex could cross bbb reach neural tissues tested tem.
the tat-peg-gs nps could cross bbb escape arrest the
reticuloendothelial system (res), would potential nano-carrier systems 
for central delivery.
