purpose: anti-hepatitis c virus (hcv) antibodies (abs) screening blood donors 
has introduced france march 1st, 1990. last years, new
agent named hepatitis g virus (hgv) described. tested different 
groups blood donors aim establishing prevalence hgv.
methods: two hundred forty-three donors negative anti-hcv abs, other
viral markers normal alanine amino transferase (alt) control [group
1], 91 elevated alt [group 2], 72 abs directed hepatitis b 
virus core (anti-hbc) [group 3], 3 elevated alt anti-hbc abs [group 4]
and 70 positive anti-hcv abs [group 5] evaluated. hcv-rna tested 
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) (amplicor, roche) hgv-rna house pcr and
abbott kit. anti-hgv abs tested boehringer and/or abbott tests.
results: among group 1, none subject found hcv-rna positive. seven (2.9%) 
hgv viremic 19 positive anti-hgv abs (7.8%). four (4.4%) 5 (6.9%)
donors hgv-rna positive 15 (16.5%) 16 (22.2%) anti-hgv abs positive 
in group 2 3 respectively. group 4, 2 donors anti-hgv abs positive.
furthermore, group 5, 52 subjects (74.3%) hcv-rna positive 9 hgv-rna
positive (12.9%). six donors viremic viruses. lastly, 26 donors 
have anti-hgv abs (37.1%). none subject five groups hgv-rna and
anti-hgv abs.
conclusion: prevalence hgv-rna anti-hgv high among control donors. 
in donors one two hepatitis surrogate markers (alt and/or anti-hbc abs), 
the prevalence hgv viremia anti-hgv abs increased well among
donors hcv infection.
