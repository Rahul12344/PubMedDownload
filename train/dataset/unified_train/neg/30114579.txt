this study investigated potential raman spectroscopy, differentiate
between two different types human pathological conditions symptom
similarity; typhoid dengue. raman spectra recorded 20 salmonella
typhi infected 22 dengue virus (denv) infected sera samples using laser
wavelength 785 nm. raman spectrum (540 1830 cm-1) serum samples was
compared showed significant variations. twelve characteristic raman bands at
562, 649, 716, 780, 838, 1099, 1144, 1156, 1260, 1386, 1556 1746 cm-1 were
recorded specifically case typhoid infected samples, whereas four raman
bands 756, 1218, 1672 1686 cm-1 found specifically denv
infected samples. statistical differentiation principal component analysis
(pca) linear discriminant analysis (lda) applied successfully
separated two sets data. disease specific raman signatures may be
labeled biomarkers identification well differential diagnosis of
typhoid dengue infection. hence propose raman spectroscopy the
potential identify also differentiate different
pathological conditions, similar symptoms like high grade fever in
this case.
