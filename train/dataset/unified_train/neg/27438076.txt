avian leukosis virus (alv) avian oncogenic retrovirus induce
various clinical tumors. capsid protein p27 group-specific antigen 
alv many viral antigen sites easy detect. study, we
produced monoclonal antibody (mab), 3a9, specific p27 protein. 
a series partially overlapping peptides screened define
(181)ppsar(185) minimal linear epitope recognized mab 3a9. the
identified epitope could recognized chicken anti-alv mouse anti-alv p27
sera. epitope highly conserved among number alv-a, alv-b alv-j
strains. mab 3a9 might valuable tool development new
immunodiagnostic approaches alv, defined linear epitope might help
further understanding antigenic structure p27 protein.
