west nile virus (wnv) neurotropic flavivirus emerged globally 
significant cause viral encephalitis humans. wnv-induced innate immune 
response, including production antiviral cytokines, critical for
controlling virus infection. adaptor protein asc mediates critical step 
innate immune signaling bridging interaction pathogen
recognition receptors caspase 1 inflammasome complexes, role in
wnv immunopathogenesis defined. here, demonstrate asc essential
for interleukin-1β (il-1β) production development effective host immunity 
against wnv. asc-deficient mice exhibited increased susceptibility wnv
infection, reduced survival associated enhanced virus replication in
the peripheral tissues central nervous system (cns). infection cultured
bone marrow-derived dendritic cells showed asc essential the
activation caspase 1, key component inflammasome assembly. asc(-/-) mice 
exhibited attenuated levels proinflammatory cytokines serum.
intriguingly, infected asc(-/-) mice also displayed reduced levels alpha
interferon (ifn-α) igm serum, indicating overall protective role
of asc restricting wnv infection. however, brains asc(-/-) mice displayed
unrestrained inflammation, including elevated levels proinflammatory cytokines
and chemokines, ifn-γ, ccl2, ccl5, correlated more
pronounced activation astrocytes, enhanced infiltration peripheral
immune cells cns, increased neuronal cell death. collectively, our
data provide new insights role asc essential modulator of
inflammasome-dependent -independent immune responses effectively control
wnv infection.
