viral infections cause many serious human diseases high mortality rates. new
drug-resistant strains continually emerging due high viral mutation
rate, makes necessary develop new antiviral agents. compounds of
plant origin particularly interesting. pentacyclic triterpenoids (pts)
are diverse class natural products plants composed three terpene
units. exhibit antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antiviral activities.
oleanolic, betulinic, ursolic acids representative pts widely present 
nature broad antiviral spectrum. review focuses recent
