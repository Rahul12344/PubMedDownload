in cats, infection t-lymphotropic retroviruses cause t-cell
proliferation leukemia t-cell depletion immunosuppression. humans, 
some highly t4 tropic retroviruses called htlv-i cause t-cell proliferation
and leukemia. subgroup htlv-ii also induces t-cell proliferation vitro,
but role disease unclear. viruses third subgroup human
t-lymphotropic retroviruses, collectively designated htlv-iii, isolated
from cultured cells 48 patients acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(aids). biological properties htlv-iii immunological analyses its
proteins show virus member htlv family, more
closely related htlv-ii htlv-i. serum samples 88 percent of
patients aids 79 percent homosexual men signs symptoms 
that frequently precede aids, less 1 percent heterosexual
subjects, antibodies reactive antigens htlv-iii. major immune
reactivity appears directed p41, presumed envelope antigen of
the virus.
