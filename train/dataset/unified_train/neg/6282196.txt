furman pa, de miranda p, st clair mh, elion gb.

the metabolism acyclovir mono-, di-, triphosphate derivatives was
examined uninfected virus-infected cells. level phosphorylation 
acyclovir dependent upon virus type, cell line, exogenous drug concentration,
and exposure time. acyclovir phosphorylation inhibited exogenously added
nucleosides. order inhibition deoxythymidine greater than
deoxycytidine greater guanosine greater equal deoxyguanosine.
acyclovir triphosphate persisted infected cells removal drug from
the medium. initial half-life triphosphate 1.2 h absence of
the drug medium, triphosphate levels reached plateau 6 h. 
presence low concentrations drug medium resulted longer
persistence intracellular triphosphate higher plateau level.
