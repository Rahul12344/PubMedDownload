we generated replication-competent (vsv-c/e1/e2) nonpropagating
(vsvdeltag-c/e1/e2) vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) contiguously expressing 
structural proteins hepatitis c virus (hcv; core [c] glycoproteins e1 
e2) report immunogenicity murine models. vsv-c/e1/e2 and
vsvdeltag-c/e1/e2 expressed high levels hcv c, e1, e2, were
authentically posttranslationally processed. vsv-expressed hcv e1-e2
glycoproteins found form noncovalently linked heterodimers appeared
to correctly folded, confirmed coimmunoprecipitation analysis using
conformationally sensitive anti-hcv-e2 monoclonal antibodies (mabs). intravenous 
or intraperitoneal immunization balb/c mice vsv-c/e1/e2 or
vsvdeltag-c/e1/e2 resulted significant surprisingly comparable hcv core or
e2 antibody responses compared control mice. addition, virus 
types generated hcv c-, e1-, e2-specific gamma interferon
(ifn-gamma)-producing cd8(+) cells, determined enzyme-linked immunospot
(elispot) analysis. mice immunized vsvdeltag-c/e1/e2 also protected
against formation tumors expressing hcv e2 (ct26-hghe2t) exhibited
ct26-hghe2t-specific ifn-gamma-producing e2-specific cd8(+) t-cell activity. 
finally, recombinant vaccinia virus (vvhcv.s) expressing hcv structural
proteins replicated significantly lower levels inoculated mice
immunized vsv-c/e1/e2 vsvdeltag-c/e1/e2, control viruses.
our data therefore illustrate potentially safer replication-defective vsv
can successfully engineered express high levels antigenically authentic 
hcv glycoproteins. addition, strategy may therefore serve effective
vaccine immunotherapy-based approaches treatment hcv-related
disease.
