the prevalence hiv drug resistance varies geographic location, year, 
treatment exposure. study generated yearly estimates nonnucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nnrti) resistance treatment-naive (tn) and
treatment-experienced (te) patients united states (us), europe (eu), and
canada. studies reporting nnrti resistance identified electronic databases and
11 conferences analyzed three groups: (1) tn patients one four
geographic regions [us, canada, eu countries larger surveillance networks
("eu1"), eu countries fewer data ("eu2")]; (2) te patients any
region; (3) tn patients failing nnrti-based treatments clinical trials.
analysis data included 158 unique studies 22 countries representing 84
cohorts tn patients, 21 cohorts te patients, 8 trials reporting
resistance failure. 1995 2000, resistance prevalence tn patients
increased us eu1 3.1% 7.5% 0.8% 3.6%, respectively.
resistance regions stabilized 2006 onward. little resistance was
identified eu2 2000, increased 2006 (5.0%) 2010 (13.7%).
one tn canadian study identified reported resistance 8.1% 2006.
half tn clinical trial patients resistance treatment failure at
weeks 48-144. resistance te patients increased 1998 (10.1%) 2001
(44.0%), decreased 2004. trends nnrti resistance among tn patients 
show increased burden us eu countries compared others.
these findings signify need alternate first-line treatments some
regions.
