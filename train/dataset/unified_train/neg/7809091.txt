the human t-cell leukemia virus type tax protein transforms cells through
induced expression many cellular genes, including encoding the
growth-related proteins interleukin 2 alpha chain receptor.
induction genes mediated, least part, tax-dependent
posttranslational activation nf-kappa b, typically heterodimers p50
(nf-kappa b1) p65 (rela). preexisting nf-kappa b proteins retained in
the cytoplasm cells association inhibitory ankyrin-motif-containing 
kappa b proteins, primarily kappa b-alpha also including precursor
proteins p105 (nf-kappa b1) p100 (nf-kappa b2). demonstrate the
existence previously undescribed multimeric cytoplasmic complex which
nf-kappa b dimers associated p100 inhibitor manner dependent on
the precursor protein's ankyrin domain. also demonstrate antagonistic
effect tax protein cytoplasmic sequestration function p100; this
in turn leads nuclear translocation nf-kappa b dimers liberated from
multimeric complexes. tax may exert effects physical
association p100. tax also relieves p100-mediated inhibition dna
binding p50-p65 heterodimers vitro. results demonstrate mechanism 
which tax may activate nf-kappa b cells.
