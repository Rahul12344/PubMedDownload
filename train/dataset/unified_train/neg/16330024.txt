clade b serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins) intracellular proteins,
whereas identified targets extracellular. proposed
intracellular role inhibitors protection apoptosis. we
investigated contribution serpinb2 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-2,
pai-2) activity tnf-alpha-induced apoptosis. pai-2 expressed many normal
and transformed cell types, particularly stimulation inflammatory
cytokines. pai-2 linked protection tnf-alpha-induced apoptosis, 
and stabilizing interaction retinoblastoma protein (rb1) been
proposed. examined activity pai-2 tnf-alpha-induced apoptosis using 
hela, isreco-1 ht1080 cell lines. stimulation tnf-alpha protected each
cell type apoptosis induced tnf-alpha cycloheximide. protection
correlated increase pai-2 expression is-1 ht1080 cells 
in hela cells pai-2 mrna protein undetectable. pai-2 was
overexpressed cell type gave protection tnf-alpha-induced
apoptosis measured cell viability, annexinv binding caspase-3/7 activity. 
we detected wild-type rb1, unchanged tnf receptor levels induction other
apoptosis-protective factors cell types. conclusion, elevated pai-2
levels protect cells tnf-alpha-induced apoptosis, protective 
effect prior stimulation tnf-alpha require pai-2.
