background: sequencing hybridisation effective method obtaining
large amounts dna sequence information low cost. efficiency sbh
depends design probe library provide maximum information for
minimum cost. long probes provide higher probability non-repeated sequences 
but lead increase number probes required whereas short probes may
not provide unique sequence information due repeated sequences. have
investigated effect probe length, use reference sequences, thermal 
filtering design probe libraries several highly variable target dna
sequences.
results: designed overlapping probe libraries range highly variable
drug target genes based known sequence information develop formal
terminology describe probe library design. find targets these
libraries provide good coverage previously unseen target whereas for
others coverage less 30%. optimal probe length varies as
short 12 nt large 19 nt depends sequence, variability,
and stringency thermal filtering. cannot determined inspection 
of example gene sequence.
conclusions: optimal probe length optimal number reference sequences
used design probe library highly target specific highly variable
sequencing targets. optimum design cannot determined simply inspection 
of input sequences alignments detailed analysis each
specific target. highly variable sequences, shorter probes cases 
provide better information longer probes. probe library design would benefit
from general purpose tool analysing issues. formal terminology
developed analysis approaches used describe contribute
to development tools.
