the attenuated equine infectious anemia virus (eiav) vaccine first
attenuated lentivirus vaccine used large-scale application has
been used successfully control spread equine infectious anemia (eia) in
china. better understand potential role cytokines pathogenesis
of eiav infection resulting immune response, used branched dna technology 
to compare mrna expression levels 12 cytokines chemokines, including
il-1α, il-1β, il-4, il-10, tnf-α, ifn-γ, ip-10, il-8, mip-1α, mip-1β, mcp-1, 
mcp-2, equine monocyte-derived macrophages (emdms) infected the
eiav(dlv121) vaccine strain parental eiav(dlv34) pathogenic strain.
infection eiav(dlv34) eiav(dlv121) caused changes mrna
levels various cytokines chemokines emdms. early stage of
infection eiav(dlv34) (0-24h), expression pro-inflammatory
cytokines tnf-α il-1β significantly up-regulated, with
eiav(dlv121), expression anti-inflammatory cytokine il-4 markedly
up-regulated. effects expression cytokines chemokines
were similar two strains virus. first 4 days after
infection, expression level il-4 cells infected pathogenic
strain significantly higher cells infected vaccine
strain, expression il-1α il-1β induced vaccine strain was
significantly higher observed pathogenic strain. addition, 
after 4 days infection pathogenic strain, expression levels 5 
chemokines, ip-10, markedly increased emdms. contrast, the
vaccine strain up-regulate chemokines level. contrary to
our expectation, induced apoptosis emdms infected vaccine strain 
significantly higher infected pathogenic strain 4 days 6
days infection. together, results contribute greater
understanding pathogenesis eiav mechanisms the
immune response induced eiav infection.
