epicutaneous application contact sensitizer 2, 4-dinitro-1-chlorobenzene
(dncb) known cause inflammatory response hapten-specific cell
activation. developed highly stable gel formulation dncb easy
to apply skin. present study focused whether topical application of
dncb gel produced immunomodulation prophylactic effects lethal
herpes simplex virus infection (hsv) type 1. results indicated topical
treatment dncb gel induced proliferation lymph node cells, cells as
well antigen presenting cells, production cytokines, especially
ifn-gamma, cutaneous inflammatory response comparable freshly
prepared dncb olive oil. repeated topical treatment dncb gel resulted in
prophylactic effect lethal infection herpes simplex virus type 1
(hsv-1). mice repeatedly treated dncb gel infected hsv, a
significant increase serum ifn-gamma observed. results suggest 
topical dncb functions potent immunomodulator, activating anti-viral defense
mechanisms.
