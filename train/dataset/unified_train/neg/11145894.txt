molecular diagnosis human papillomaviruses (hpvs) cervicovaginal samples
reveals plethora known novel hpv genomes. describe use an
overlapping pcr method clone analyze complete genome hpv 84 from
cervicovaginal cells obtained 21-year-old caucasian female normal
pap smear. 7948-bp complete nucleotide sequence hpv 84 determined from
five overlapping pcr products sequence walking. blast homology search
demonstrated hpv 84 closely related hpv 61 (89%), hpv 72 (86%), 
and hpv 83 (85%) nucleotide sequence analysis l1 open reading frame,
placing hpv genome homology group a3. previously, virus been
identified pap155. based extensive epidemiological data, hpv 84 highly
prevalent genital papillomavirus primarily detected normal hiv-infected
women.
