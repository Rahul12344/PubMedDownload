to define predictive contributory risk factors pancreatitis human
immunodeficiency virus-infected children receiving dideoxyinosine (ddi), the
authors evaluated 95 children, 3 months 18 years age, received ddi 
at 60 540 mg/m2 per day mean 56 weeks. pancreatitis developed 7
patients (7%) resolved upon withdrawal ddi. neither age, sex, nor
cd4 count study entry predictive pancreatitis, pancreatitis
appeared likely develop hemophiliacs patients (4 23
vs 3 72). pancreatitis developed patients received ddi the
highest dose levels (7 60 patients received ddi dose > = 360 mg/m2
per day vs 0 35 patients received < = 270 mg/m2 per day). patients in
whom pancreatitis developed received higher mean daily dose ddi than
patients normal amylase lipase levels throughout study (348 mg/m2 vs
282 mg/m2), relationship cumulative dose duration ddi
therapy observed. although statistically significant relationship between
ddi plasma concentration (area curve) pancreatitis not
conclusively demonstrated, number patients pancreatitis
actually developed small, relationship may been
obscured.(abstract truncated 250 words)
