public health measures successfully identified contained outbreaks of
the severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) coronavirus (sars-cov), concerns
remain possibility future recurrences. finding vaccine this
virus therefore remains high priority. here, show dna vaccine
encoding spike (s) glycoprotein sars-cov induces cell and
neutralizing antibody responses, well protective immunity, mouse
model. alternative forms analysed dna immunization. expression
vectors induced robust immune responses mediated cd4 cd8 cells, well as
significant antibody titres, measured enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
moreover, antibody responses mice vaccinated expression vector
encoding form includes transmembrane domain elicited neutralizing
antibodies. viral replication reduced six orders magnitude in
the lungs mice vaccinated plasmid dna expression vectors, and
protection mediated humoral t-cell-dependent immune mechanism.
gene-based vaccination sars-cov elicits effective immune responses that
generate protective immunity animal model.
