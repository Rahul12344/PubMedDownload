to virologically assess efficacy interferon therapy chronic hepatitis
c, either 5 10 mu/day natural interferon-alpha (ifn alpha) administered to
57 patients chronic hepatitis c 38 weeks. complete sustained
response (cr-sr), evidenced absence serum hepatitis c virus
(hcv)-rna administration period 6 months final
administration ifn alpha normal gpt level 6 months final
administration, occurred 42.6% (23/54) subjects. liver tissue was
histologically evaluated using histological activity index (hai) score before
and administration period. cr-sr cases, significant improvements (p 
< 0.01) occurred periportal necrosis, intralobular necrosis, portal
inflammation total score. comparison, hcv genotypes, revealed cr-sr
occurred 60% (9/15) subjects type 2a 30.3% (10/33) subjects
with type 1b. comparison virus concentration revealed cr-sr occurred in
71.4% (15/21) subjects virus concentration < 10(5)
copies/ml, 24.2% (8/33) virus concentration >
10(5) copies/ml. analysis multiple logistic model revealed strong
correlation therapeutic effect interferon therapy the
pre-administration virus concentration (p = 0.0061) genotype (p = 0.0015).
these results suggest pre-administration virus concentration and
genotype key factors affecting therapeutic effect interferon
therapy chronic hepatitis c therapeutic effect interferon is
satisfactorily high, irrespective virus concentration, subjects type
2a hcv, varies depending virus concentration subjects type 1b.
