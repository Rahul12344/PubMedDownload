alpha thalassemia common genetic disease world the
prevalence carriers ranging 5-50% several populations. coinheritance
of two defective α-globin genes usually gives rise symptomatic condition,
hemoglobin (hb) h disease. previously, suggested several studies
in different populations nondeletional hb h disease (--/α(t)α --/αα(t))
is generally severe deletional type (--/-α). report, we
describe four rare nondeletional α-thalassemia mutations thai individuals,
including initiation codon mutation (hba2:c.1dela), donor splice site mutation
(ivsi-1, hba1:c.95 + 1g>a), hb queens park (hba1:c.98t>a) [α32(b13)met>lys], 
hb westmead (hba2:c.369c>g) [α122(h5)his>gln]. interactions first three
mutations α(0)-thalassemia resulted nondeletional hb h disease;
however, clinical presentations rather mild detected
accidentally. suggests genotype-phenotype correlation of
α-thalassemia syndrome might heterogeneous type mutation
does simply imply prediction resulting phenotype. data be
of use future genetic counseling conditions increasingly
identified thanks improvement molecular analysis routine
laboratories.
