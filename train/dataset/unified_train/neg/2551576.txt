the corneal migration topographic distribution langerhans cells (lc) in
relation herpes simplex virus antigens studied course of
dendritic keratitis inbred mice. corneal epithelial sheets infected mice 
at selected time points "double stained" ia-positive langerhans cells
and hsv antigens, using sequential avidin biotin immunoperoxidase glucose
oxidase technique. amount hsv antigen maximum day 2 paralleling the
clinical time course, corneal epithelium hsv antigen negative day 8.
lc seen peripheral corneas day 2 paracentral central cornea
by day 8, peak numbers detected days 8 11 post-infection.
although hsv antigens lc simultaneously detected within corneal
epithelium, lc observed anatomic juxtaposition hsv antigens, even 
after reinoculation infected corneas hsv day 14 following primary 
infection. data suggest local factors corneal epithelium 
than hsv antigens per se may chemotactic lc course dendritic
keratitis.
