comparison tissue distribution reverse transcriptase, p30 type-c
virus gibbon ape lymphocytic leukemia.

saxinger c, schetters h.

tissues obtained necropsy 7 year old male gibbon ape malignant
lymphoma leukemia analyzed electron microscopic, immunological and
enzymological techniques determine comparative localization tumor cells
and virus throughout body. general, different assays correlated well; 
the reverse transcriptase (rt) assay p30 radioimmunoassay (ria) the
most sensitive, although rt assay able detect activity one tissue
scored negative p30 ria. tissues infiltrated tumor cells varying 
degrees correlated well level virus markers cases 
the exception liver kidney. 2 organs marked
infiltration free virus tumor cells evidence virus
infection production cells.
