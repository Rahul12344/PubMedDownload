the ability manipulate expression genes within neurons provides unique 
opportunities study role individual gene products nervous system
function. virus vectors potentially rapid tool experimental
manipulation gene expression mammalian nervous system. however, block
to use virus vector systems neurobiology often lack of
cell-specific expression gene within nervous system, immune
and inflammatory responses virus vector delivered gene. we
have generated adeno-associated virus vector exploits restricted
expression pattern rat preprotachykinin-a promoter support reporter
gene expression. demonstrate virus neuronal-specific
expression pattern. moreover, shown first time proximal
rat preprotachykinin-a promoter nerve growth factor inducible. virus will
be useful tool (i) modify neuronal phenotype expressing therapeutic
molecules antisense nucleic acid (ii) dissect signal transduction
pathways regulate promoter function vivo.
