purpose: transfer prodrug activation systems tumors using
replication-deficient viruses suggested effective method for
achieving high local low systemic anticancer drug concentrations. however,
most current suicide gene therapy strategies still hindered poor
efficiency vivo gene transfer, inefficient tumor penetration, limited
bystander cell killing effect, need large prodrug doses. hypothesized
that local amplification provided replication competent platform would help 
overcome limitations.
experimental design: generated transductionally transcriptionally
targeted oncolytic adenovirus ad5/3-delta24fcu1 expressing fusion suicide
gene fcu1. fcu1 encodes bifunctional fusion protein efficiently catalyzes 
the direct conversion 5-fc, relatively nontoxic antifungal agent, the
toxic metabolites 5-fluorouracil 5-fluorouridine monophosphate, bypassing the
natural resistance certain human tumor cells 5-fluorouracil.
results: examined efficacy ad5/3-delta24fcu1 the
replication-defective control ad5/3-fcu1 without 5-fc. fcu1 expression
was confirmed western blot, whereas enzymatic conversion levels vitro and
in vivo determined high-performance liquid chromatography separation.
significant antitumor effect observed vitro vivo murine model 
of head neck squamous cell carcinoma. although observed decrease in
viral dna copy number vitro tumors treated ad5/3-delta24fcu1 and
5-fc, suggesting effect virus replication, highest antitumor effect was
observed combination.
conclusions: seems feasible efficacious combine adenovirus replication 
to fcu1 prodrug activation system.
