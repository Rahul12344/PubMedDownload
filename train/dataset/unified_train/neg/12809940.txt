monitoring hepatitis b virus (hbv) levels serum plays important role 
the management chronic hepatitis b patients receiving lamivudine. we
evaluated usefulness real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(taqman pcr) measurement hbv dna. subjects 22 patients with
chronic hepatitis b treated lamivudine 4-12 months. hbv dna measured
by taqman pcr. comparison, hbv dna also measured 88 sera branched
dna (bdna) assay, transcription-mediated amplification (tma) assay, amplicor 
monitor test. correlation significant results taqman pcr and
those three assays (r=0.630, 0.681, 0.715, respectively;
p<0.05). 22 patients, hbv dna beneath detection limit start
of therapy 4 (18%) bdna assay, 3 (14%) tma assay, 2 (9%) 
amplicor test, 0 (0%) taqman pcr. 19 patients sera were
available 12 weeks therapy, hbv dna detected 16 (84%) the
bdna assay, 12 (63%) tma assay, 6 (32%) amplicor test, 2 (11%) 
on taqman pcr. tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (ymdd) variants emerged in
three patients; taqman pcr detected hbv dna throughout treatment revealed
significantly increased viral loads biochemical breakthrough. conclude 
that monitoring hbv taqman pcr useful evaluating response to
lamivudine treatment early detection drug-resistant variants.
