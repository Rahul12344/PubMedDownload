background: kim-1 staining upregulated proximal tubule-derived renal cell
carcinoma (rcc) including clear renal cell carcinoma papillary renal cell
carcinoma, chromophobe rcc (distal tubular tumor). study was
designed prospectively examine urine kim-1 level 1 month after
removal renal tumors.
patients design: total 19 patients eventually enrolled study
based pre-operative imaging studies. pre-operative follow-up (1 month)
urine kim-1 levels measured. urine kim-1 levels (ukim-1) then
normalized urine creatinine levels (ucr). renal tumors also stained for
kim-1 using immunohistochemical techniques.
results: kim-1-negative staining group included 7 cases, the
kim-1-positive group consisted 12 cases. percentage kim-1-positive
staining rcc cells ranged 10 100 %, staining intensity ranged
from 1+ 3+. groups, serum creatinine levels significantly
elevated nephrectomy. kim-1-negative group, ukim-1/ucr remained a
similar level (0.37 ± 0.1 ng/mg cr) nephrectomy (0.32 ± 0.01
ng/mg cr). however, kim-1-positive group, elevated ukim-1/ucr 1.20 ±
0.31 ng/mg cr significantly reduced 0.36 ± 0.1 ng/mg cr, similar
to pre-operative ukim-1/ucr (0.37 ± 0.1 ng/mg cr) kim-1-negative
group.
conclusion: small prospective study showed significant reduction in
ukim-1/ucr nephrectomy kim-1 positive group, suggesting urine
kim-1 may serve surrogate biomarker kidney cancer non-invasive
pre-operative measure evaluate malignant potential renal masses.
