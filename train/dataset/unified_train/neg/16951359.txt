hemopoietic stem cell-derived mature langerhans-type dendritic cells (lc) are
susceptible productive infection human cmv (hcmv). investigate the
impact infection cell type, examined hla-dr biosynthesis and
trafficking mature lc cultures exposed hcmv. found decreased surface
hla-dr levels viral ag-positive well ag-negative mature lc.
inhibition hla-dr independent expression unique short us2-us11
region gene products hcmv. indeed, exposure uv-inactivated virus, not
to conditioned medium infected cells, sufficient reduce hla-dr on
mature lc, implicating particle binding/penetration effect. reduced
surface levels reflected altered distribution hla-dr total cellular
hla-dr diminished. accumulation hla-dr explained altered
cathepsin activity. mature, peptide-loaded hla-dr molecules retained
within cells, assessed proportion sds-stable hla-dr dimers. block 
in egress implicated, endocytosis surface hla-dr increased.
immunofluorescence microscopy corroborated intracellular retention hla-dr 
and revealed markedly fewer hla-dr-positive dendritic projections infected
mature lc. unexpectedly, light microscopic analyses showed dramatic loss the
dendrites immunofluorescence revealed cytoskeletal elements
crucial formation maintenance dendrites disrupted viral
ag-positive cells. consistent dendrite effects, hcmv-infected mature
lc exhibit markedly reduced chemotaxis response lymphoid chemokines. thus, 
hcmv impedes mhc class ii molecule trafficking, dendritic projections, and
migration mature lc. changes likely contribute reduced activation
of cd4+ cells hcmv-infected mature lc.
