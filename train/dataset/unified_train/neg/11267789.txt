the reproduction effects bovine viral diarrhea virus type-2 (bvdv-2) infection
were investigated ewes inoculated non-cytopathic bvdv-2 isolate at
three stages gestation. virus inoculation followed transient viremia,
accompanied transient mild hyperthermia nasal discharge few
animals. ewes sacrificed different time-points virus
inoculation study kinetics fetal infection. infectivity viral
antigens detected placentomes day 7 36 post-inoculation (pi) 
in fetal fluids tissues days 10 28 pi. cardiac petechial
hemorrhages hemoperitoneum accompanied severe fibrinous ulcerative
placentitis observed fetuses examined days 21, 28 36 pi.
inoculation ewes days 55-60 gestation resulted prolonged virus
replication placentomes fetal tissues; ewes allowed proceed
with pregnancy 77% abortions fetal perinatal deaths. seven
stillbirths, unviable viable lambs born ewes virus-positive 
birth. infectious virus repeatedly isolated leukocytes two lambs up
to 2 6 months age, indicating persistently infected. ewes
inoculated days 65-70 gestation 66.6% fetal perinatal losses.
three viable lambs born ewes healthy, bvdv antibody-positive and
virus-negative. transient viral replication placentomes fetal
tissues, followed rise fetal neutralizing antibodies virus
clearance result inoculating ewes days 120-125 gestation. lambs 
born ewes healthy, antibody-positive virus-negative. these
results demonstrate biology bvdv-2 infection pregnant sheep is
essentially similar bvdv-1 pregnant cattle sheep. these
features make species attractive animal model studying the
pathogenesis congenital bvdv-2 infection.
