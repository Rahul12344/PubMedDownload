swine influenza acute respiratory disease pigs caused influenza a
virus (iav) characterized fever followed lethargy, anorexia, serous
nasal discharge. disease progresses rapidly may complicated when
associated respiratory pathogens. iav one prevalent
respiratory pathogens swine, resulting substantial economic burden pork 
producers. past 10-15 years, dramatic evolution iav u.s. swine
has occurred, resulting co-circulation many antigenically distinct iav 
strains, derived 13 phylogenetically distinct hemagglutinin clusters h1
and h3 viruses. vaccination common strategy prevent influenza in
pigs, however, current diverse iav epidemiology poses challenge the
production efficacious protective vaccines. concern regarding use of
traditional inactivated vaccines possibility inducing
vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (vaerd) vaccine virus
strains mismatched infecting strain. review, discuss 
current epidemiology pathogenesis swine influenza united states,
different vaccines platforms potential control influenza pigs, the
factors associated vaccine-associated disease enhancement.
