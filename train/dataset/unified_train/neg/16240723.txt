viruses genus carlavirus encode small cysteine-rich protein (crp) unknown
function. investigate role crp carlavirus chrysanthemum virus b
(cvb), recombinant potato virus x (pvx) genome constructed, carried
the cvb crp gene. expression cvb crp pvx genetic background drastically
changed pvx symptom phenotype n. benthamiana. instead symptomless
infection mild mosaic, characteristic pvx plant host,
the recombinant virus expressing cvb crp induced formation necrotic local
lesions inoculated leaves necrosis apical leaves. n. tabacum,
the infection pattern depended host genotype: recombinant pvx able
to spread systemically n gene-carrying plants. in
agroinfiltration-mediated transient expression assay, cvb crp exhibit the
properties avirulence factor n. benthamiana unable suppress
post-transcriptional gene silencing. thus, cvb crp viral pathogenicity
determinant controlling virus interaction plant hosts manner 
depends plant defense mediated resistance genes n gene.
