anti-poxvirus therapies currently limited cidofovir
[(s)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine], drug-resistant strains
have already characterized. aim finding new target, the
thymidylate (tmp) kinase vaccinia virus, prototype orthopoxvirus, has
been overexpressed escherichia coli cloning gene (a48r). specific
inhibitors alternative substrates pox tmp kinase contribute to
virus replication inhibition. biochemical characterization enzyme revealed
distinct catalytic features compared human counterpart. sharing 42%
identity human tmp kinase, vaccinia virus enzyme assumed adopt
the common fold nucleoside monophosphate kinases. enzyme purified to
homogeneity behaves homodimer, like known tmp kinases. initial
velocity studies showed km atp-mg2+ dtmp 0.15 mm 20
microm, respectively. vaccinia virus tmp kinase found phosphorylate dtmp, 
dump also dgmp purine pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphate.
5-halogenated dump 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate (5i-dump) 
5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate (5br-dump) also efficient
alternative substrates. using
thymidine-5'-(4-n'-methylanthraniloyl-aminobutyl)phosphoramidate fluorescent
probe dtmp binding site, detected adp-induced conformational change 
enhancing binding affinity dtmp analogues. several thymidine dtmp 
derivatives found bind enzyme micromolar affinities. present
study provides basis design specific inhibitors substrates 
poxvirus tmp kinase.
