preparation double-stranded (replicative form) bacteriophage m13 dna.

green mr, sambrook j.

the double-stranded, closed-circular, replicative form (rf) m13 dna present
in high copy numbers infected cells, physical characteristics are
essentially identical closed-circular plasmid dnas. the
methods commonly used purify plasmid dna therefore used isolate m13 
rf dna. protocol describes isolation m13 rf dna alkaline lysis
from small volumes (1-2 ml) infected bacterial cultures. yield dna (1-4
mg, depending size m13 clone) enough purposes
in molecular cloning. however, dna needed, procedure can
easily scaled up.
