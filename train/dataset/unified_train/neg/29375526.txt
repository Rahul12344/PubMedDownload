ebola virus (ebov) causes severe hemorrhagic fevers humans, approved
therapeutics vaccine currently available. glycoprotein (gp) major
protective antigen ebov, generate virus-like particles (vlps) by
co-expression matrix protein (vp40). study, constructed a
recombinant alphavirus semliki forest virus (sfv) replicon vector drep express
ebov gp matrix viral protein (vp40). ebov vlps successfully generated
and achieved budding 293 cells co-transfection drep-based gp 
vp40 vectors (drep-gp+drep-vp40). vaccination balb/c mice drep-gp,
drep-vp40, drep-gp+drep-vp40 vectors, followed immediate electroporation
resulted mixed igg subclass production, recognized ebov gp and/or vp40
proteins. vaccination regimen also led generation th1 th2
cellular immune responses mice. notably, vaccination drep-gp and
drep-vp40, produces gp vp40 antigens, induced significantly
higher level anti-gp igg2a antibody increased ifn-Î³ secreting cd8+ t-cell 
responses relative vaccination drep-gp drep-vp40 vector alone. our
study indicates co-expression gp vp40 antigens based sfv
replicon vector generates ebov vlps vitro, vaccination recombinant
drep vectors containing gp vp40 antigens induces ebola antigen-specific
humoral cellular immune responses mice. novel approach provides a
simple efficient vaccine platform ebola disease prevention.
