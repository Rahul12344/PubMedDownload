rationale: hiv-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) likely 
prevalent noninfectious complication aids previously recognized.
furthermore, majority hiv-pah cases occur individuals history of
intravenous drug use. study used simian immunodeficiency (siv)
macaque model primary cell-culture system investigate association
between drug abuse hiv infection hiv-pah development.
methods: archival lung tissues macaques previously used study the
effect morphine siv infection-associated neuropathogenesis analyzed
for pulmonary vascular changes. direct effect hiv proteins illicit
drugs investigated oxidative stress, survival, proliferation human 
pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells.
measurements main results: sivmacr71/17e-infected rhesus macaques treated
with morphine (vm group) demonstrated significant pulmonary vascular remodeling, 
including presence early advanced complex (plexiform) lesions, when
compared either siv-infected (v group) morphine-treated uninfected (m
group) macaques. however, v (two five) vm (two six) groups
included animals pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. endothelial
cells lining vessels medial hypertrophy initial-stage intimal lesions
in lung sections vm macaques demonstrated increase positivity both
terminal dutp nick-end labeling ki67. oxidative stress-mediated enhanced
apoptosis followed enhanced proliferation endothelial cells observed on
simultaneous treatment viral proteins drugs abuse compared with
either treatment alone.
conclusions: findings suggest siv/hiv protein(s) morphine interact
to cause proliferation apoptosis-resistant endothelial cells leading to
angio-obliteration.
