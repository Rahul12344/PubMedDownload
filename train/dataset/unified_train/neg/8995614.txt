the infection cells moloney murine leukemia virus (m-mulv) causes an
increase specific cellular gene products, including major
histocompatibility complex (mhc) class antigens. upregulation occurs
through transactivation process mediated long terminal repeat (ltr) of
m-mulv, show gene activation response ltr requires at
least one specific cis element within mhc proximal promoter region. nested
deletions mhc class h-2kb gene promoter sequence subcloned a
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) reporter vector transiently
introduced balb/c-3t3 cells expressing m-mulv cotransfected into
balb/c-3t3 cells vector containing subgenomic portions virus,
including ltr. cat activity assays demonstrated minimal h-2kb gene
promoter (-64 +12) contained elements sufficient transactivation.
dnase footprinting assays located protein-binding site region -64
to -34 bp transcriptional start site, point mutation analysis
confirmed location cis-acting element, designated let response
element (lre), defined binding motif. lre distinct binding
sites currently known transcription factors class mhc gene promoter 
and conserved promoters human murine mhc class genes. mutation
of lre resulted dramatic reduction dna-protein binding activity in
electrophoretic mobility shift assay ability mutated promoter
to respond retroviral transactivation. addition lre heterologous
promoter conferred ability respond retroviral transactivation.
