the laterodorsal tegmentum (ldt) brain structure involved distinct
behaviors including arousal, reward, innate fear. environmental stimuli
and top-down control high-order sensory limbic cortical areas converge
and coordinate region modulate diverse behavioral outputs remains
unclear. using modified rabies virus, applied monosynaptic retrograde
tracing whole brain examine ldt cell type specific upstream nuclei.
the ldt received strong midbrain hindbrain afferents moderate
cortical hypothalamic innervation weak connections thalamus. the
main projection neurons cortical areas restricted limbic lobe,
including ventral orbital cortex (vo), prelimbic, cingulate cortices.
although different cell populations received qualitatively similar inputs,
primarily via afferents periaqueductal gray area, superior colliculus,
and ldt itself, parvalbumin-positive (pv+) gabaergic cells received
preferential projections local ldt neurons. regard different
subtypes gabaergic cells, considerable number nuclei, including 
the ventral tegmental area, central amygdaloid nucleus, vo, made
significantly greater inputs somatostatin-positive cells pv+ cells.
diverse inputs ldt system-wide level revealed.
