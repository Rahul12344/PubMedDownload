one first generation assay (manufactured ortho, test i) 3 second
generation anti-hcv elisas (manufactured ortho, abbott, ubi, tests ii-iv) 
were compared. sera 4 different sources used: (1) intravenous
drug-users (ivdus, n = 50), (2) blood donors (n = 1055), (3) clinical samples
from one day routine anti-hcv testing (n = 89), (4) hemodialysis patients
previously found negative test clinically suspected hcv
infection (n = 11). confirmatory anti-hcv tests carried second
generation recombinant immunoblot assay (riba ii). sera positive exclusively
by test iv, one antibody consumption test (ubi hcv neutralization eia) one
further immunoblot assay (inno-lia hcv ab) used. pcr hcv rna carried
out hemodialysis patient sera riba ii positive blood donor
sera. second generation elisas discriminated 11 positive samples than
the first generation test (2 ivdus, 5 blood donors, 4 clinical samples). 9
sera blood donors clinical samples riba ii positive or
indeterminate. second generation tests thus showed increased sensitivity. the
second generation tests also showed increased specificity 4 samples 
were positive test negative second generation tests, also
negative riba ii. exceptions, riba ii-positive the
indeterminate samples positive second generation elisas. few
exceptions, riba ii-negative samples negative second
generation elisas. eleven blood donor sera positive test iv exclusively
where riba ii supplementary assays negative. recently
introduced second generation anti-hcv elisas found higher
sensitivity first generation test. tests also showed good
concordance exception test iv group blood donor sera.
