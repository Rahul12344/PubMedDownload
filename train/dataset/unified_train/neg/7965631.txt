recombinant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) integrase shown to
bind atp nucleoside triphosphates nucleotide analogs vitro.
cross-linking atp photoaffinity analog 8-azido-atp integrase
occurred uv dose-dependent manner. covalent binding atp integrase 
also achieved without uv irradiation nucleotide oxidized the
2',3'-dialdehyde derivative (oxidized atp) prior incubation protein, 
indicating presence reactive lysine residue nucleotide binding
region protein. number experimental observations indicate that
nucleotides dna substrates bind overlapping site(s) the
integrase protein. example, binding nucleotides nucleotide analogs 
to integrase blocked prior incubation dna substrates, the
covalent cross-linking 8-azido-atp integrase inhibited dna binding 
oligonucleotide cleavage activities protein. oxidized atp inhibited the
oligonucleotide cleavage activity integrase concentrations no
effect dna binding, suggesting oxidized nucleotides may specifically
target catalytic center enzyme. studies indicate nucleotide
analogs may serve probes dna binding catalytic sites enzyme
and may serve models design active site inhibitors retroviral
integrase.
