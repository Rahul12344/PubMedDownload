to develop safe method target gene delivery intrahepatic tumors, we
examined toxicity intrahepatic (ih) injection retroviral vector
producer cells (vpc) canine liver. vpc demonstrated to
effectively transfer genes vivo. evaluate adverse effects form
xenogeneic cell transplantation, mongrel dogs injected ih 1 x 10(9)
murine ltkosn.2 vpc divided three aliquots. animals monitored 
for acute toxicity induced vpc. intraoperative ih injections the
cells tolerated without difficulty. starting 7 days ih injection, 
dogs received intravenous ganciclovir (gcv) twice daily (5 mg/kg) 7
days. gcv treatment cause significant toxicities. dogs underwent serial
blood tests evaluate bone marrow, renal, liver immunological function.
complete blood counts, electrolytes, liver function renal function tests
remained normal except mild elevations alkaline phosphatase. histologic
examination liver tissues ih injection site revealed apparent
normal tissue destruction induced vpc. two four treated dogs
underwent liver biopsy day 3. biopsy specimens cultured and
persistent, viable vpc recovered. dogs mounted antibody response to
the murine vpc first demonstrated 5 days post injection. pcr analysis
demonstrated low level gene transfer dog liver tissue. overall, results 
demonstrate ih xenogeneic vpc injections accompanied significant 
adverse effects 1 month period following administration canine
liver. data support safety aspects using murine vpc phase i
clinical trials.
