the genomes two closely related lytic thermus thermophilus siphoviruses with
exceptionally long (approximately 800 nm) tails, bacteriophages p23-45 and
p74-26, sequenced completely. p23-45 genome consists 84,201 bp with
117 putative open reading frames (orfs), p74-26 genome 83,319 bp 
116 putative orfs. two genomes 92% identical 113 orfs shared. only
25% phage gene product functions predicted similarities to
proteins protein domains known functions. structural genes of
p23-45, similarity sequences public databases, were
identified mass spectrometric analysis virions. unusual feature the
p23-45 p74-26 genomes presence, largest intergenic regions,
of long polypurine-polypyrimidine (r-y) sequences mirror repeat symmetry.
such sequences, abundant eukaryotic genomes rare prokaryotes, known
to form stable triple helices block replication transcription induce
genetic instability. comparative analysis two phage genomes shows the
area around triplex-forming elements enriched mutational variations. in
vitro, phage r-y sequences form triplexes block dna synthesis taq dna
polymerase orientation-dependent manner, suggesting may play a
regulatory role p23-45 p74-26 development.
