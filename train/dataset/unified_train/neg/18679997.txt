the presence herpesvirus turkeys (hvt) dna feather tips chickens 
vaccinated hvt assessed dot blot hybridisation probe specific 
for hvt lacking homology mdv dna. small amounts hvt dna were
detected feather tips chickens vaccinated left contact 
with hvt vaccinated chickens. however chickens challenged virulent
mdv, hvt dna detected feather tips vaccinated chickens the
largest amount detected 35 days vaccination. hvt dna recovered in
significantly higher quantities mdv-infected chickens 
those infected contact. suggests mdv infection may provide helper
functions hvt. mdv dna identified feather tips mdv-challenged
chickens 25 45 days challenge. thus, immunisation chickens 
hvt prevent replication mdv feather tips only
diminished it.
