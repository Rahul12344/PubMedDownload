to investigate origin human t-lymphotropic virus (htlv-i), strains of
diverse geographical origin analysed. sequenced ltr env genes 
htlv-i strains brazil, central african republic, taiwan zaire, the
simian t-lymphotropic virus type (stlv-i) strain phsu1 baboon the
sukhumi primate centre. performed phylogenetic analyses using
neighbour-joining, parsimony maximum likelihood methods. three separate
htlv-i clusters identified interspersed stlv-i clusters. the
brazilian taiwanese strains within first well-supported cluster 
containing cosmopolitan htlv-i strains flanked west african stlv-i
strains. htlv-i strains central african republic zaire fell a
central african cluster close chimpanzee stlv-i isolates. third
well-supported cluster included melanesian htlv-i strains indonesian 
stlv-i strains closest neighbours. therefore, currently known htlv-i strains
represent three htlv-i subtypes probably originated three
geographically distinct interspecies transmission events. highly divergent
phsu1, isolated papio hamadryas, closely related pcy-991, isolated
from papio cynocephalus, sukhumi primate centre. clustered
together asian wild-caught rhesus macaque stlv-i strains suggesting recent
interspecies transmission virus rhesus macaques colony-bred african
baboons sukhumi primate centre. rooted env trees obtained using the
stlv strain ph969 outgroup, asian strains branched the
african strains, implying asian origin htlv/stlv type based presently
available strains.
