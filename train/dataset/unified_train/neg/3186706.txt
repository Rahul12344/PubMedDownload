in paper mechanically permeabilized cells used dissect the
transport semliki forest virus glycoproteins trans-golgi network to
the plasma membrane. transport golgi complex monitored measuring 
the proteolytic cleavage semliki forest virus p62 glycoprotein e2
and e3 polypeptide chains. cell surface appearance measured exposure
of exoplasmic domain antibodies directed viral glycoprotein.
both cleavage p62 protein transport glycoprotein the
cell surface reconstituted permeabilized bhk cells calcium and
glucose present medium. detailed analysis showed cleavage of
the p62 protein occurred arrival plasma membrane.
