objectives: chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection common patients who
receive hemodialysis (hd). aim study determine natural
history hepatitis c viremia clinical utility quantitation and
genotyping hcv population patients.
methods: consecutive sera two groups hd patients hcv rna
positive, group 33 patients treated interferon alfa (5 mu, three times 
a week 4 months) group 31 untreated patients, analyzed by
qualitative polymerase chain reaction, quantitative polymerase chain reaction,
and line probe assay genotyping.
results: serum hcv rna detected continuously 20 31 untreated patients
(65%), 11 patients (35%) showed fluctuating pattern viremia with
virus-free intervals 4 wk. twenty-five 33 patients (76%) treated with
interferon alfa became hcv rna negative therapy; eight 25
patients breakthrough, transient seven patients persistent
in one. remaining 24 end-of-treatment responders, 17 relapsed after
completion therapy, seven (21%) sustained response undetectable
serum hcv rna 1 yr follow-up. initial serum hcv rna levels hd patients 
were generally low (median, 1 x 10(5) genome eq/ml). sustained responders had
significantly lower median levels viremia (4 x 10(4) eq/ml) relapsers and
nonresponders (9 x 10(4) 1.8 x 10(5) eq/ml, respectively). genotyping
revealed predominance genotype 1a (33%) 1b (48%).
conclusions: study documents fluctuating hepatitis c viremia with
periods undetectable hcv rna common low viral load predicts a
sustained response interferon therapy hd patients. diagnosis chronic
hepatitis c monitoring interferon therapy hd patients include
initial hcv rna quantitation repeated qualitative measurements hcv rna.
