the aligned restriction endonuclease maps three sequenced maize streak virus
isolates, three restriction-mapped southern african maize streak virus isolates, 
and two sequenced geminiviruses used means calculating the
sequence divergence viruses. degree divergence used to
construct phylogenetic tree viruses; tree agrees well with
predictions sequence comparisons, method used study the
relationship geminivirus isolates without labor expense sequencing 
each one.
