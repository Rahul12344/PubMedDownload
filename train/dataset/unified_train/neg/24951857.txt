orexin neurons hypothalamus regulate energy homeostasis coordinating
various physiological responses. past studies shown role orexin
peptide itself; however, orexin neurons contain orexin also other
neurotransmitters glutamate dynorphin. study, examined the
physiological role orexin neurons feeding behavior metabolism by
pharmacogenetic activation chronic ablation. generated novel orexin-cre
mice utilized cre-dependent adeno-associated virus vectors express
gq-coupled modified gpcr, hm3dq diphtheria toxin fragment orexin neurons.
by intraperitoneal injection clozapine-n oxide orexin-cre mice expressing
hm3dq orexin neurons, could selectively manipulate activity orexin
neurons. pharmacogenetic stimulation orexin neurons simultaneously increased
locomotive activity, food intake, water intake respiratory exchange ratio
(rer). elevation blood glucose levels rer persisted even locomotion 
and feeding behaviors returned basal levels. accordantly, 83% ablation of
orexin neurons resulted decreased food water intake, 70% ablation
had almost effect parameters. results indicate orexin
neurons play integral role regulation feeding behavior and
metabolism. regulation robust greater 80% orexin neurons 
were ablated significant changes feeding behavior emerged.
