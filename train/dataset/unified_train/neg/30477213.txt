the use mycoviruses manipulate virulence entomopathogenic fungi
employed biocontrol agents may lead development novel methods to
control attacks insect pests. approaches urgently required, as
existing agrochemicals withdrawn market due environmental
and health concerns. aim work investigate presence and
diversity mycoviruses large panels entomopathogenic fungi, mostly from
spain denmark. total, 151 isolates belonging genera beauveria,
metarhizium, lecanicillium, purpureocillium, isaria, paecilomyces were
screened presence dsrna elements 12 spanish b. bassiana isolates
were found harbor mycoviruses. identified mycoviruses belong three
previously characterised species, officially recognised beauveria bassiana
victorivirus 1 (bbvv-1) proposed beauveria bassiana partitivirus 2
(bbpv-2) beauveria bassiana polymycovirus 1 (bbpmv-1); individual b. bassiana
isolates may harbor three mycoviruses. notably, mycovirus
species distinct selection pressures, recombination viral
genomes increases population diversity. phylogenetic analysis the
rna-dependent rna polymerase gene sequences revealed current population 
structure spain potentially result vertical horizontal
mycovirus transmission. finally, pathogenicity experiments using the
mediterranean fruit fly ceratitis capitata showed direct correlation between
the presence particular mycovirus virulence b. bassiana
isolates, illustrated potentially interesting isolates exhibit
relatively high virulence, used detailed virulence
experimentation future.
