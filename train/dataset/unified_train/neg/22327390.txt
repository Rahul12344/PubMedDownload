we determined entire rna1, 2 3 sequences two prunus necrotic ringspot 
virus (pnrsv) isolates, chr3 cherry pch12 peach, obtained an
orchard niagara fruit belt, canada. rna1, 2 3 two isolates 
share nucleotide sequence identities 98.6%, 98.4% 94.5%, respectively.
their rna1- 2-encoded amino acid sequences 98% identical the
corresponding sequences cherry isolate, ch57, pnrsv isolate
with complete rna1 2 sequences available. phylogenetic analysis coat
protein movement protein encoded rna3 pch12 chr3 published
pnrsv isolates indicated chr3 belongs pv96 group pch12 belongs to
the pv32 group.
