hiv infection associated immune dysfunction, perturbation immune-cell 
subsets opportunistic infections. cd161++ cd8+ cells a
tissue-infiltrating population produce il17a, il22, ifn, tnfα, cytokines

semi-invariant tcr vα7.2, canonical feature mucosal associated invariant t
(mait) cells recently implicated host defense pathogens.
we analyzed frequency function cd161++ /mait cells peripheral blood
and tissue patients early stage chronic-stage hiv infection. show
that cd161++ /mait cell population significantly decreased early hiv
infection fails recover despite otherwise successful treatment. provide
evidence cd161++ /mait cells preferentially infected may be
depleted diverse mechanisms including accumulation tissues and
activation-induced cell death. loss may impact mucosal defense could
