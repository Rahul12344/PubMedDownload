the probability detecting influenza virus (iav) virus isolation (vi),
point-of-care (poc) antigen detection, real-time reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction (rrt-pcr) estimated pen-based oral fluid (of)
and individual pig nasal swab (ns) specimens. piglets (n=82) isolated 30
days confirmed negative porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome
virus, mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, iav infections. subset (n=28) was
vaccinated day post inoculation (dpi) -42 -21 commercial
multivalent vaccine. dpi 0, pigs intratracheally inoculated with
contemporary isolates h1n1 (n=35) h3n2 (n=35) served negative
controls (n=12). (n=370) collected dpi 0-16 ns (n=924) dpi 0-6, 8, 10,
12, 14, 16. association iav detection variables interest
(specimen, virus subtype, assay, vaccination status, dpi) analyzed by
mixed-effect repeated measures logistic regression results used to
calculate probability (pˆ) detecting iav ns dpi assay.
vaccination (p-value<0.0001), dpi (p-value<0.0001), specimen-assay
interaction (p-value<0.0001) significant iav detection, virus subtype
was (p-value=0.89). vaccination and/or increasing dpi reduced pˆ all
assays. vi successful using ns of, vi poc were
generally unsuccessful dpi 6. overall, rrt-pcr specimens provided the
highest pˆ dpis, yet significantly different results observed
between two laboratories independently performing rrt-pcr testing.
