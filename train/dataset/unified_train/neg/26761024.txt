viral communities two different salt pans located namib desert, hosabes
and eisfeld, investigated using combination multiple displacement
amplification metaviromic dna deep sequencing, provided comprehensive 
sequence data ssdna dsdna viral community structures. read contig
annotations online pipelines showed salt pans harbored largely
unknown viral communities. network analysis, able assign a
large portion unknown reads diverse group ssdna viruses. contigs
belonging subfamily gokushovirinae common environmental
datasets. analysis haloarchaeal virus contigs revealed presence three
contigs distantly related his1, indicating possible new lineage of
salterproviruses hosabes playa. based viral richness read mapping
analyses, salt pan metaviromes novel closely related each
other showing low degree overlap environmental viromes.
