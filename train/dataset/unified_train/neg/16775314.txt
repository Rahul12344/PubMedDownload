the p6 domain human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) gag long been
known monoubiquitinated. previously shown ma, ca, nc
domains also monoubiquitinated low levels (e. gottwein h. g.
krausslich, j. virol. 79:9134-9144, 2005). several lines evidence
support role ubiquitin virus release, relevance gag
ubiquitination unclear. directly address function gag
ubiquitination, constructed gag variants lysine residues nc,
sp2, p6 domains mutated arginine either individual domains in
combination. using mutants, showed addition ma, ca, nc, and
p6, sp2 also mono- di-ubiquitinated levels comparable the
other domains. replacement lysine residues one domains 
minor effects virus release, cumulative mutations nc sp2 nc
and p6 resulted accumulation late budding structures, observed by
electron microscopy analysis. strikingly, replacement lysine residues
downstream ca led significant reduction virus release kinetics a
fivefold accumulation late viral budding structures compared wild-type
levels. results indicate ubiquitination lysine residues gag in
the vicinity viral late domain important hiv-1 budding, no
specific lysine residue may needed individual domains functionally
substitute. consistent gag ubiquitination functionally
involved transient protein interaction network virus budding site.
