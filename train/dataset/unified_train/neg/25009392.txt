aim: evaluate predictive effect baseline hepatitis b surface antigen
(hbsag) response pegylated interferon (peg-ifn)-α2b hepatitis b e
antigen (hbeag)-positive chronic hepatitis b (chb) patients.
methods: retrospective analysis compared treatment efficacy of
peg-ifn-α2b alone 55 hbeag-positive chb patients different baseline hbsag
levels. serum hbv dna load measured baseline, 12, 24 48 wk of
therapy. virological response defined hbv dna < 1000 iu/ml. serum hbsag
titers quantitatively assayed baseline, 12 24 wk.
results: eighteen patients baseline hbsag > 20 000 iu/ml, 26 patients had
1500-20000 iu/ml, 11 patients < 1500 iu/ml. three (16.7%), 11 (42.3%) and
seven (63.6%) patients group achieved virological response week 48, 
with significant difference groups baseline hbsag levels > 20000
or < 20000 iu/ml (p = 0.02). thirteen patients hbsag decline > 0.5 log10
and 30 patients < 0.5 log10 week 12; 6 (46.2%) 10 (33.3%) each
group achieved virological response week 48, significant difference
between two groups (p = 0.502). eighteen patients hbsag decline > 1.0 
log10 30 patients < 1.0 log10 week 24, 8 (44.4%) 11 (36.7%)
achieved virological response week 48, significant difference
between two groups (p = 0.762). none 16 patients hbsag > 20000
iu/ml week 24 achieved virological response week 48.
conclusion: baseline hbsag level combination hbv dna may become an
effective predictor guiding optimal therapy peg-ifn-α2b against
hbeag-positive chb.
