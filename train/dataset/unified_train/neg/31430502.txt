in study, pathogenic avian infectious bronchitis virus (ibv) qx-type
strain yn successfully rescued vaccinia virus based reverse genetic
technology. ten fragments contiguously spanning complete ibv genome were
amplified cloned vaccinia virus genome homologous recombination. 
the full-length genomic cdna transcribed vitro, transcript was
transfected bhk-21/n cells could stably express ibv n protein. 48 h 
post transfection, culture medium harvested inoculated into
10-day-old specific-pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs replicate the
rescued virus. strategy chosen facilitate rescue procedure to
ensure recombinant ryn virus require cell culture
adaptations. one ovo passage, recombinant yn virus (ryn) was
successfully recovered confirmed possess introduced silent marker
mutation genome. biological characteristics ryn eid50,
tcid50, replication ovo, replication kinetcs vitro tested 
were similar parental strain yn. findings demonstrate successful
construction highly-pathogenic qx-type ibv using modified rescue procedure, 
allowing future studies molecular biology pathogenicity ibv
field strains.
