despite accepted role cd4+ cells immune control, little known
about development ag-specific cd4+ cell immunity upon primary infection.
here use mhc class ii tetramer technology directly visualize the
ag-specific cd4+ cell response upon infection mice moloney murine
sarcoma leukemia virus complex (momsv). significant numbers ag-specific
cd4+ cells detected lymphoid organs retrovirus-induced
lesions early infection, express 1b11-reactive
activation-induced isoform cd43 recently shown define effector
cd8+ cell populations. comparison kinetics momsv-specific cd4+
and cd8+ cell responses reveals pronounced shift toward cd8+ cell immunity 
at site momsv infection progression immune response.
consistent important early role ag-specific cd4+ cell immunity
during momsv infection, cd4+ cells contribute generation of
virus-specific cd8+ cell immunity within lymphoid organs required
to promote inflammatory environment within virus-infected tissue.
