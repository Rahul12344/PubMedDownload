in report 1995 who/isfc task force definition and
classification cardiomyopathies new entity within dilated
cardiomyopathies introduced "inflammatory cardiomyopathy". defined
as myocarditis associated cardiac dysfunction. idiopathic, autoimmune and
infectious forms inflammatory cardiomyopathy recognized this
definition. dilated cardiomyopathy inflammation (dcmi, chronic myocarditis) 
was also defined recent isfc task force > 14 lymphocytes/macrophages/mm3.
enteroviruses, adenoviruses cytomegaloviruses considered main
etiopathogenetic factors pathogenesis inflammatory heart disease and
have demonstrated important trigger inflammatory cardiac disease.
they may also cause dilated cardiomyopathy viral persistence secondary
immunopathogenesis due antigenic molecular mimicry. detection of
viral persistence investigation endomyocardial biopsies patients with
cardiomyopathy use polymerase chain reaction southern blot analysis
is important step standardization diagnostic criteria virally
induced inflammatory cardiomyopathy. present studies indicate incidence of
cytomegalovirus-dna patients inflammatory cardiomyopathy 10%,
adenoviral-dna 17% borreliosis rare cases (< 1%). dilated
cardiomyopathy without inflammation respective incidences for
cytomegalovirus 12%, 15% adenovirus 0.5% cases borreliosis.
in addition results immunohistochemical analysis molecular biological 
investigations endomyocardial biopsies may implications future
therapeutic studies. depending etiology disease, immunosuppression 
may benefit patients virus-negative cardiomyopathy with
inflammation contrast patients cytomegalo-, adenovirus-dna or
enteroviral persistence, immunomodulation hyperimmunoglobulins or
immunoglobulins may feasible therapeutic option. patients positive
