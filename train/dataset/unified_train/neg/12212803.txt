the mass spectrometric analysis immunodominant epitope region (273-284) of
herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) glycoprotein (gd) showed favoured fission
at asp-pro peptide bond. fast atom bombardment collision induced
dissociation (fab-cid) study closely related x-pro peptides documented that
neither length amino acid composition peptide a
significant influence preferential cleavage. time dp bond
proved sensitive acidic conditions course peptide synthesis.
these observations prompted us compare chemical mass spectrometric
stability new set nonapeptides related 273-284 epitope region of
gd, i.e. salledpvg sallexpvg peptides, x = a, k, i, s, f, e d,
respectively. chemical stability peptides acidic hydrolysis
was investigated electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (esi-ms) the
products identified esi-ms on-line high performance liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (hplc-ms). mass spectrometric fragmentation 
and bond stability untreated peptide samples also studied using
esi-ms liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry (lsims). chemical
hydrolysis mass spectrometric fragmentation showed asp-pro bond 
could easily cleaved, kp bond proved stable both
circumstances. hand, xp bond (x = a, i, s, f e) fragmented
easily mass spectrometric conditions, sensitive the
acidolysis.
