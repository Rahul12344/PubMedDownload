vesicular stomatitis virus matrix protein (vsv m) shown inhibit 
transcription nucleocytoplasmic transport. isolated mutant form 
m, termed m(d), lacking inhibitory activities. hela cells expressing m, 
not m(d), accumulate polyadenylated rnas within nucleus. concomitantly, a
fraction m, m(d) mutant, localizes nuclear rim.
additionally, nucleoporin nup98 specifically interacts with
m(d). nup98(-/-) cells, levels nuclear envelope its
inhibitory effects host cell-directed expression reporter genes were
significantly reduced. together, data demonstrate vsv inhibits host
cell gene expression targeting nucleoporin primarily blocking nuclear
export.
