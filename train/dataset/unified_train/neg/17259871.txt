background: prior reports frequency circulating
influenza-specific, interferon gamma-producing memory cd4+ cd8+ t-cells in
healthy children received multiple influenza immunizations.
methods: evaluated 21 previously immunized children, ages 3 9 years, before
and 1 month administration trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine.
frequencies influenza-specific cd4+ cd8+ t-cells stimulated trivalent
inactivated influenza vaccine a/panama (h3n2) virus determined flow
cytometry, antibody responses vaccine strains drifted h3n2 strain
were measured hemagglutination inhibition assay neutralizing antibody
assays.
results: mean change cd4+ cd8+ t-cell frequencies immunization
was 0.01% (p > 0.39) postimmunization cd4+ frequencies higher cd8+
frequencies. children previous vaccinations higher baseline
frequency cd4+ t-cells (p = 0.0002) smaller increase even decline
from baseline immunization (p = 0.003). association age and
change frequency detected. baseline geometric mean titers (gmts) and
seroprotection rates significantly higher older children a/panama
(neutralizing baseline gmt, p = 0.0488) a/new caledonia (hemagglutination
inhibition baseline gmt seroprotection, p < 0.0297). baseline gmts against
b/hong kong associated age quantity prior vaccinations.
conclusions: findings suggest children may plateau cd4+ t-cell
responses influenza antigens repeated exposures number of
exposures may play large role building memory cd4+ t-cell response to
influenza a, perhaps independently age.
