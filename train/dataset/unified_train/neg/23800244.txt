background: advanced data mining techniques decision trees been
successfully used predict variety outcomes complex medical
environments. furthermore, previous research shown combining results
of set individually trained trees ensemble-based classifier can
improve overall classification accuracy. paper investigates effect of
data pre-processing, use ensembles constructed bagging, simple
majority vote combine classification predictions routine pathology
laboratory data, particularly overcome large imbalance negative hepatitis
b virus (hbv) hepatitis c virus (hcv) cases versus hbv hcv immunoassay
positive cases. methods illustrated using never analysed data
set act pathology (canberra, australia) relating hbv hcv patients.
results: easier predict immunoassay positive cases negative cases 
of hbv hcv. applying ensemble-based approach rather single
classifier small positive effect accuracy rate, also varied
depending virus analysis. finally, scaling data prediction
also small positive effect accuracy rate dataset. a
graphical analysis distribution accuracy rates across ensembles
supports findings.
conclusions: laboratories looking include machine learning part their
decision support processes need aware infection outcome, the
machine learning method used virus type interact affect enhanced
laboratory diagnosis hepatitis virus infection, determined primary
immunoassay data concert multiple routine pathology laboratory variables.
this awareness lead informed use existing machine learning
methods, thus improving quality laboratory diagnosis via informatics
analyses.
