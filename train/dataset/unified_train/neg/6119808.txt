inactivation infectivity human cytomegalovirus (cmv) herpes simplex
virus type 1 (hsv-1) type 2 (hsv-2) observed following exposure to
4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (nqo) metabolite, 4-hydroxyaminoquinoline 1-oxide
(haqo). present study specificity chemical structure of
4-nitroquinolines demonstrated 4-nitro 1-oxide groups were
required inactivation virus infectivity. reduction 4-nitro group to
a 4-hydroxyamino group enhanced activity, reduction amino
group resulted loss activity virus infectivity. capacity to
inactivate virus also lost substitution pyridine ring the
quinoline nucleus nqo. relationship chemical structure the
ability inactivate viruses studied correlates well earlier vivo
carcinogenicity studies group chemicals.
