previous evidence presence chicken anemia virus (cav) gonads of
immune specific-pathogen-free chickens raised question whether occurs
also commercial breeders. presence cav investigated nested pcr
in gonads spleens hens two 55- 59-week-old, cav-vaccinated
(flocks 2 3), two 48- 31-week-old non-vaccinated broiler breeder
flocks (flocks 1 4). addition, lymphoid tissues 20-day-old embryos from
these hens also investigated presence cav. cav detected in
the gonads 5/6 11/22 vaccinated hens hens also in
the spleen alone. embryos 7/8 5/18 hens positive. the
non-vaccinated flocks, cav detected gonads 11/34 10/10 hens 
flocks 1 4, respectively. addition, 11 birds flock 1 positive
spleens. cav dna detected 3/11 2/10 embryos. cav-positive
gonads embryos detected samples hens moderate well as
high vn antibody titers. vaccinated chickens positive cav gonads and
in embryos vn titers ranging >1:512 <1:2048. non-vaccinated 
chickens, vn titers cav positive chickens ranged 1:128 1:4096.
these results demonstrate cav genome remain present gonads of
hens commercial broiler breeder flocks even presence high
neutralizing antibody titers associated protection against
cav vertical transmission. also suggests transmission progeny may 
occur irrespectively level humoral immune response hens.
