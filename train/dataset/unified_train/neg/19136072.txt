human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) env genes cloned blood
samples hiv-1-infected thai patients, 35 infectious crf01_ae envelope
glycoprotein (env)-recombinant viruses established. report, we
examined neutralization susceptibility viruses human monoclonal
antibodies, 2g12, igg1 b12, 2f5 4e10, pooled patient plasma, coreceptor
antagonists fusion inhibitor, t-20. neutralization susceptibility of
crf01_ae env-recombinant viruses 2f5, 4e10, patient plasma, coreceptor
antagonists t-20 varied, viruses showed low susceptibility 2g12
and igg1 b12. several dual-tropic viruses showed lower susceptibility 2f5 
4e10 cxcr4- ccr5-tropic viruses. neutralization susceptibility the
crf01_ae env-recombinant virus pooled patient plasma negatively correlated
with length v1/v2 region number potential n-linked
glycosylation sites conserved regions gp120. correlation found
between coreceptor usage neutralization susceptibility virus to
t-20, whereas several dual-tropic viruses showed higher susceptibility to
coreceptor antagonists cxcr4- ccr5-tropic viruses. propose 
crf01_ae env-recombinant viruses useful study molecular
mechanism susceptibility crf01_ae env neutralizing antibodies and
viral entry inhibitors.
