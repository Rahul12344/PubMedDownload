background: fibropapillomatosis (fp) neoplastic disease characterized by
cutaneous tumours documented infect sea turtle species.
chelonid fibropapilloma-associated herpesvirus (cfphv) believed the
aetiological agent fp, based principally consistent pcr-based detection 
herpesvirus dna sequences fp tumours. used recently described pcr-based
assay targets 3 conserved cfphv genes, survey 208 green turtles (chelonia
mydas). included fp tumour exhibiting clinically healthy
individuals. additional 129 globally distributed clinically healthy individual
sea turtles; representing four species also screened.
results: cfphv dna sequences obtained 37/37 (100%) fp exhibiting green 
turtles, 45/300 (15%) clinically healthy animals spanning five species.
although frequency infected individuals per turtle population varied
considerably, global populations contained least one cfphv positive
individual, exception various turtle species arabian gulf,
northern indian ocean puerto rico. haplotype analysis different gene
markers clustered cfphv dna sequences two markers (ul18 ul22) 
in turtles turks caicos separate others, regardless host
species geographic origin.
conclusion: presence cfphv dna within globally distributed samples all
five species sea turtle confirmed. 100% fp exhibiting green
turtles yielded cfphv sequences, surprisingly, 15% clinically
healthy turtles. hypothesize turtle populations zero (0%) cfphv
frequency may attributed possible environmental differences, diet and/or
genetic resistance individuals. results provide first data the
prevalence cfphv among seemingly healthy turtles; factor may be
directly correlated disease incidence, may suggest long-term
co-evolutionary latent infection interaction cfphv turtle-host
across species. finally, computational analysis amino acid variants within the
turks caicos samples suggest potential functional importance a
substitution marker ul18 encodes major capsid protein gene, which
potentially could explain differences pathogenicity. nevertheless, a
theory remains validated research.
