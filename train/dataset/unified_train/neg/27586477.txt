background objective: salmonella escherichia coli different types 
bacteria cause food poisoning humans. elderly, infants people 
with chronic conditions, dangerous salmonella e. coli gets 
the bloodstream must treated phage therapy. treating
salmonella e. coli phage therapy affects gut flora. research
paper presents system detecting effects virulent e. coli and
salmonella bacteriophages human gut.
methods: method based domain-domain interactions (ddis) model implemented
in proposed system determine interactions proteins of
human gut bacteria proteins bacteriophages infect virulent e.
coli salmonella. system helps gastroenterologists realize effect
of injecting bacteriophages infect virulent e. coli salmonella the
human gut.
results: testing system enterobacteria phage 933w, enterobacteria
phage vt2-sa enterobacteria phage p22, resulted four interactions
between proteins bacteriophages infect e. coli o157:h7, e. coli
o104:h4 salmonella typhimurium proteins human gut bacterium
strains.
conclusion: several effects detected as: antibacterial activity against
a number bacterial species human gut, regulation cellular
differentiation organogenesis gut, lung, heart development,
ammonia assimilation bacteria, yeasts, plants, energizing defense system
and function detoxification lipopolysaccharide, the
prevention bacterial translocation human gut.
