it proposed constitutive, physical association met
receptor alpha(6)beta(4) integrin exists surface invasive
carcinoma cells hepatocyte growth factor (hgf)-mediated invasion is
dependent alpha(6)beta(4) (trusolino, l., bertotti, a., comoglio, p. m.
(2001) cell 107, 643-654). potential significance results prompted
us re-examine hypothesis. using three different carcinoma cell lines that
express met alpha(6)beta(4), unable detect constitutive
association receptors co-immunoprecipitation. moreover, carcinoma
cells lacked expression alpha(6)beta(4) exhibited met-dependent invasion 
toward hgf, increasing met expression viral infection cells
enhanced invasion without inducing alpha(6)beta(4) expression. although
expression alpha(6)beta(4) cells enhanced invasion hgf, it
also enhanced ability invade toward chemoattractants as
lysophosphatidic acid, latter invasion inhibited a
function-blocking met antibody. finally, depletion beta(4) rna interference
in invasive carcinoma cells express receptors reduced ability of
these cells invade toward hgf approximately 25%, abrogate
their invasion. data argue invasive function met be
independent alpha(6)beta(4) alpha(6)beta(4) generic influence
on invasion carcinoma cells specific met.
