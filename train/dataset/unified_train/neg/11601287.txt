objective: obtain full-length sequence chinese hepatitis g virus (hgv)
strain (hgvch) investigate genetic characteristic hgvch its
identity isolates.
methods: reverse transcription (rt) nested-pcr used screen hgv rna
positive serum amplify cdna fragments. positive serum without known
hepatitis virus markers selected isolating hgv rna template. hgv
genome divided 12 overlapping fragments directly cloned pgem-t 
vector. sequences determined dideoxy terminus-end method dna
sequencing analyzed computer.
results: twelve fragments hgvch cover 9213 nucleotides length,
containing large open reading frame (orf) encoding 2873 animo acids polyprotein
that began methonine residue ended termination codon. hgvch is
about 86.5%-89.5% identical known hgv isolates nucleotide level
and 93.9%-96.2% deduced animo acid level.
conclusion: hgv non-a-e hepatitis causal agent, proved related with
posttransfusion hepatitis world. chinese hgv isolate very
close relationship isolates africa, europe, japan, without
significant difference across entire genome. suggested the
sequences hgv isolates conservative evolution slow.
