noncytopathic viruses use multiple strategies evade immune detection,

mice coincident accelerated recruitment memory cd8+ cells enhanced 
effector function compared primary cd8+ cell responses. contrast to
primary effectors, reactivated memory cells persisted cns higher
frequencies retained ex vivo cytolytic activity. nevertheless, despite
earlier prolonged cell-mediated control cns vaccinated mice,
virus ultimately reactivated. apparent loss memory cd8+ effector function in
vivo supported prominent decline mhc expression cns resident

virus window opportunity escape immune surveillance. studies

persisting virus tissue strict ifn-dependent mhc regulation, evident
in immune privileged sites.
