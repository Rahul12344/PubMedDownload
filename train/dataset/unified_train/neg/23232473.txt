the guatemala potato tuber moth tecia solanivora (povolny) (lep. gelechiidae) 
an invasive species mesoamerica considerably extended its
distribution area recent decades. species considered a
major potato pest venezuela, colombia, ecuador, currently specific
control methods available farmers. address issue developed a
biopesticide formulation used integrated pest management t.
solanivora, following three steps. first, search entomopathogenic viruses
were carried extensive bioprospections 12 countries worldwide. 
a result, new phthorimaea operculella granulovirus (phopgv) isolates found
in t. solanivora five gelechid species. second, twenty phopgv isolates,
including previously known newly found isolates, genetically and/or
biologically characterized order choose best candidate a
biopesticide formulation. sequence data obtained ecdysteroid
udp-glucosyltransferase (egt) gene, single copy gene known play role in
pathogenicity. three different sizes (1086, 1305 1353 bp) egt found
among virus isolates analyzed. unexpectedly, obvious correlation between
egt size pathogenicity found. bioassays t. solanivora neonates showed 
a maximum 14-fold difference pathogenicity among eight phopgv
isolates tested. pathogenic phopgv isolate, jlz9f, medium lethal
concentration (lc(50)) 10 viral occlusion bodies per square mm consumed
tuber skin. third, tested biopesticide dust formulations mixing dry
carrier (calcium carbonate) different adjuvants (magnesium chloride an
optical brightener soya lecithin) different specific amounts jlz9f.
during laboratory experiments, satisfactory control pest (>98% larva
mortality compared untreated control) achieved formulation
containing 10 macerated jlz9f-dead t. solanivora larvae per kg calcium
carbonate mixed 50 ml/kg soya lecithin. final product provides an
interesting alternative chemical pesticides andean farmers affected by
this potato pest.
