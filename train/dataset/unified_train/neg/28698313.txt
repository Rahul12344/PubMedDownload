monocyte-derived mϕs (mdms) hiv-infected patients mdm infected vitro 
with hiv exhibit reduced ability secrete various cytokines, including il-12.
recently, il-27, il-12 family cytokine, shown inhibit hiv replication
in mϕ. whether hiv infection hiv accessory protein(s) impact il-27 production 
in mϕs remains unknown. herein, show vitro hiv infection, well as
intracellular hiv-tat (tat) tat peptides, inhibit lps-induced il-27
production human mdms, suggesting impairment tlr4 signaling pathway. to
understand signaling pathways governing hiv tat-mediated inhibition of
lps-induced il-27 production, first demonstrated p38 mapk, pi3k,
src-homology region 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 1 (shp-1), src
kinases regulate lps-induced il-27 production mdms. tat caused down-regulation
of tnfr-associated factor (traf)-6 inhibitor apoptosis 1 (ciap-1) and
subsequently decreased phosphorylation downstream pi3k p38 mapks, which
were implicated lps-induced il-27 production. whereas shp-1 src kinases
regulated lps-induced il-27 production, tat inhibit kinases,
suggesting involved tat-mediated inhibition lps-induced 
il-27 production. contrast tat, vitro hiv infection mdm inhibited
lps-induced il-27 production via inhibition p38 mapk activation. overall, hiv 
and tat inhibit lps-induced il-27 production human macrophages via distinct
mechanisms: tat inhibition ciap-1-traf-6 subsequent inhibition
of pi3k p38 mapks, whereas hiv inhibition p38 mapk activation.
