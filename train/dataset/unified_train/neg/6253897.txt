cleavage dna.rna hybrids type ii restriction enzymes.

molloy pl, symons rh.

the action number restriction enzymes dna.rna hybrids been
examined using hybrids synthesised rnas cucumber mosaic virus as
templates. enzymes ecori, hindii, sali, mspi, hhai, alui, taqi haeiii
cleaved dna strand hybrids (and possible also rna strand) into
specific fragments. four enzymes, hhai, alui, taqi haeiii,
comparison restriction fragments produced known sequences 
viral rnas confirmed recognising cleaving dna strand of
the hybrids correct recognition sequences. likely ability
to utilise dna.rna hybrids substrates general property type ii
restriction enzymes.
