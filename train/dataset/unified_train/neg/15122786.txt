the changes viral load cd4(+) count 3 6 months group 166
hiv-infected patients evaluated. new therapy chosen based the
medical history procedures 70 patients, 96 patients guided by
the partial complete result line probe assay (lipa) hiv rt protease
resistance tests. absolute difference baseline log viral load
at 3 6 months significantly different two groups when
adjusted baseline viral load (p < 0.0001) stayed significant when
intention-to-treat analysis carried (p < 0.001). absolute difference 
of cd4(+) count significantly different adjusted baseline
cd4(+) (p = 0.854, 3 months; p = 0.06, 6 months). proportion patients with
a viral load </=200 cp/ml medical history group (14.5%, 3 months; 15.2%, 6
months) significantly different proportion responders lipa
group (28.7%, 3 months, p = 0.03; 34.7%, 6 months, p = 0.008). the
intention-to-treat population, difference two groups remained
significant (p = 0.01). statistical difference two
groups terms adherence (p = 0.88), number drug failures (p = 0.12) and
for time since starting treatment (in years) (p = 0.48), a
significant difference number new drugs new regimen (p <
0.0001) pill burden treatment (p = 0.0006). higher
antiretroviral hiv treatment success guided lipa hiv genotyping system
than based medical history reported. note, study
reached conclusions previous studies, used sequencing.
