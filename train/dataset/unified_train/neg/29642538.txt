asp-glu-ala-asp (dead)-box polypeptide 5 (ddx5), also called p68, a
prototypical member large atp-dependent rna helicases family known 
to participate aspects rna metabolism ranging transcription to
translation, rna decay, mirna processing. roles ddx5 cell cycle
regulation, tumorigenesis, apoptosis, cancer development, adipogenesis,
wnt-Î²-catenin signaling, viral infection established. several rna
viruses reported hijack ddx5 facilitate various steps their
replication cycles. furthermore, ddx5 bounded viral proteins of
some viruses unknown functions. interestingly, antiviral function ddx5
has reported hepatitis b virus myxoma virus infection. thus, 
precise roles apparently multifaceted protein remain largely obscure.
here, provide rapid critical overview structure functions 
ddx5 particular emphasis role virus infection.
