objective: purpose study report experience the
implementation thinprep imaging system (tis) tertiary hospital in
korea evaluate effectiveness tis compared manual methods 
the screening cervical cytology.
study design: detection rates cervical abnormalities pre- post-tis 
periods (january 2009 february 2010 march 2010 december 2010,
respectively) compared. follow-up cytological histological results 
concurrent subsequent human papillomavirus (hpv) tests retrieved.
results: asc-us, asc-h, lsil, hsil frequently detected the
post-tis period pre-tis period (p < 0.005). proportions of
correlated cases asc-us 42.2 40.4% pre- post-tis periods, 
respectively. detection rates high-risk types hpv asc-us not
significantly different two groups. proportion correlated
biopsy asc-h, lsil, hsil similar periods. hpv positivity 
asc-h, lsil, hsil showed significant change two periods.
conclusion: tis potentially useful detection abnormal cervical 
cytology basis increased detection rate squamous cell
abnormalities, relatively similar proportion correlated cases compared 
to manual screening method.
