purpose: examine nature dynamics gene transfer human retinal
pigment epithelium (rpe) using adenoviral vector adjuvants may
enhance uptake recombinant adenoviruses.
methods: human rpe cultures (hrpe7) transfected vitro varying
concentrations (4, 20, 40, 120, 200 pfu/microliter) varying periods
(1, 2, 4, 16, 24, 48, 72 hours) replication-deficient adenovirus
(ad.rsv. beta gal) containing bacterial beta-galactosidase transgene (beta
gal). expression beta gal monitored counting x gal staining. 
the transgene expression profiles compared human f2000
fibroblasts conditions. adjuvant effect sodium hyaluronate 
(ha) expression beta gal tested f2000 early late passage
human rpe cells differing concentrations ha, viral titers, incubation 
times. immunofluorescent cytochemistry carried hrpe7 f2000 cells for
the ha receptors, homing receptor cd44 (cd44), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 
(icam-1), receptor hyaluronan mediated motility (rhamm).
results: number hrpe7 f2000 cells expressing adenoviral transgene 
increased consistently increasing incubation time viral titer. was
a higher uptake ad.rsv. beta gal hrpe7 cells compared f2000
fibroblasts conditions. increase 28.1% 41.4%
in number rpe7 cells expressing adenoviral transgene 16.2% 15.8%
f2000 fibroblast cells expressing adenoviral transgene presence of
0.001% 0.005% ha, respectively. significant adjuvant effects transgene
expression also shown hrpe51 cells. appears effects of
increasing viral titer, length incubation, presence ha transgene
expression least additive. appearance cd44 icam receptors on
rpe7 f2000 cells rhamm receptors f2000 cells similar. rhamm
receptors hrpe7 cells, however, shown preferentially nucleus.
conclusions: basis results, authors propose adenovirus
transgene expression increases increasing incubation time viral titer in
cell culture. rate increase expression differs human rpe cells 
and f2000 fibroblast cells, may offer targeting opportunity. the
authors propose use ha offer adjuvant effect a
targeting advantage terms transferring adenoviral transgenes human rpe
in culture.
