human noroviruses cause acute foodborne gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. in
this study, highly sensitive selective electrochemical biosensor was
fabricated detection human norovirus using novel peptides as
recognition elements. electrochemical biosensor fabricated assembling 
of eight novel peptides separately gold electrode investigated their
efficiencies sensing human noroviruses. among eight peptides, norobp peptide 
coated onto gold electrode exhibited high binding affinity towards human
noroviruses, resulting progressive decrease current signals increasing 
concentration human norovirus (0-105 copies/ml). result,
norobp-nonfoul(flexl)2-coated gold electrode acts efficient electrochemical
biosensor highly selective detection human norovirus detection
limit 1.7 copies/ml, 3-fold lower reported methods. the
developed electrochemical biosensor successfully applied detect human
norovirus prepared standard procedure oyster, suggests the
developed biosensor used sensitive selective point-of-care
bioanalytical platform detection human norovirus various food
samples.
