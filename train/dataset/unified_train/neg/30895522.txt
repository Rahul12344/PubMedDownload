salivirus newly discovered virus seems related acute
gastroenteritis children. salivirus may infect susceptible children by
fecal-oral route exposure contaminated water. present study aims 
evaluate occurrence quantity salivirus treated untreated sewage
water river water samples collected city karaj, iran reverse
transcription-quantitative pcr assay. total 50 samples collected from
environmental waters containing 22 treated untreated sewage water volume
of 1 l 28 river water samples volume 5 l included study.
after viral rna extraction, real-time pcr performed amplify 5'utr 
sequence salivirus genome viral load assessed. 50 samples
tested, salivirus genomic rna identified 5/12 (41.6%) treated and
3/10 (30%) untreated sewage samples 8/28 (28.5%) river water
samples. maximum viral load 4.8 × 106 copies/l treated sewage water
sample september lower viral load 4 × 105 copies/l related to
treated sewage water taken december. first report salivirus
occurrence environmental waters iran. viral prevalence salivirus
in three sets tested samples within low moderate range.
