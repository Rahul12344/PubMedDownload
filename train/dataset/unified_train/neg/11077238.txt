the objective study assess prevalence underlying cervical
and endometrial lesions among patients atypical glandular cells of
undetermined significance (agcus) cytologic smear. eighty-six patients
with agcus, without evidence squamous intraepithelial lesions, underwent
coloposcopy endocervical curettage (ecc) within 6 months initial
finding. endometrial samplings performed 25 patients. coloposcopy,
endocervical curettage, endometrial biopsy results reviewed. a
significant lesion defined cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and/or any
structural histologic abnormality cervix uterus (i.e., polyp).
statistical analyses performed using test, chi-square, fisher's
exact tests comparing patients underlying lesions without. a
significant lesion(s) identified 21 (24.4%) patients, 8 (9.3%) the
lesions high-grade cervical neoplasias. additional 14 (16.3%) patients, 
with negative initial work-ups, underlying lesions major cytologic
abnormalities diagnosed subsequent follow-up. endometrial findings 
were benign. none following statistically significant predictors of
underlying pathology: age, gravidy, parity, medications, medical history, tobacco
use, history sexually transmitted diseases including human immunodeficiency
virus, previous abnormal cytologic smear, concurrent diagnosis atypical
squamous cells undetermined significance, evidence human papillomavirus.
agcus often associated clinically important underlying lesions. patients 
should therefore undergo colposcopy ecc. endometrial sampling possible
cervical conization performed coloposcopic evaluation is
nondiagnostic.
