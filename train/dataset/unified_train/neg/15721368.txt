cytological, immunological, mutagenesis approaches used identify 
viral factors associated formation plasmalemma deposits (plds) in
whole plants protoplasts infected lettuce infectious yellows virus (liyv).
transmission electron microscopy immunogold labeling using polyclonal
antibodies four five liyv rna 2-encoded large proteins, capsid protein 
(cp), minor capsid protein (cpm), hsp70 homolog (hsp70h), p59, showed
specific labeling liyv virions virion aggregates around vesiculated
membranous inclusions, plds liyv-infected nicotiana benthamiana,
nicotiana clevelandii, lactuca sativa, chenopodium murale plants, and
nicotiana tabacum protoplasts. contrast, antibodies rna 2-encoded p26
showed specific labeling plds virions liyv-infected plants and
protoplasts. virion-like particles (vlps) seen protoplasts infected by
all liyv rna 2 mutants except cp (major capsid protein) mutant. plds were
more difficult find protoplasts, seen protoplasts infected by
the cp cpm mutants, protoplasts infected p26, hsp70h, or
p59 mutants. interestingly, although cpm mutant showed vlps plds, the
plds show associated virions/virion-like particles always observed
for plds seen protoplasts infected wild-type liyv. immunoblot analyses
performed purified liyv virions showed p26 detected purified
virions, detected cell wall, 1000 g 30,000 g pellet fractions 
of liyv-infected plants. data suggest p26 associated the
liyv-induced plds, contrast rna 2-encoded large proteins, p26
is virion protein.
