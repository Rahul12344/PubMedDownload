the progress treatment hepatitis b virus (hbv) substantially
improved outcome hbv-infected patients. systematically reviewed the
existing data management hbv transplant patients order assess the
optimal regimen pretransplant setting, post-transplant prophylaxis and
for therapy hbv recurrent infection. data suggest effective
pretransplant anti-hbv therapy prevents post-transplant hbv recurrence.
pretransplant therapy based lamivudine addition adefovir upon
lamivudine resistance, use newer, potent high-genetic barrier agents
is expected improve long-term efficacy. moreover, may lead improvement
of liver function, sometimes removes need transplantation, although
more objective criteria removal waiting lists required. liver 
transplantation, combination hbv immunoglobulin one nucleos(t)ide
analogue, mostly lamivudine, currently best approach, almost eliminating
the probability hbv recurrence. treatment post-transplant hbv recurrence
has mainly studied lamivudine, effective with
entecavir tenofovir, low risk resistance. conclusion, 
newer anti-hbv agents improve treatment hbv pretransplant and
post-transplant. hbv immunoglobulin still used combination anti-hbv
agent post-transplant prophylaxis. monoprophylaxis one new
anti-hbv agents might possible, particularly patients preselected having
a low risk hbv recurrence, data needed strategies to
ensure compliance must used.
