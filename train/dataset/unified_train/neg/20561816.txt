background: interpretation positive igm antibody result human
cytomegalovirus (hcmv) pregnant woman major importance correct
management pregnancy. determination hcmv-specific igg avidity is
considered useful approach distinguishing igm antibody due primary hcmv
infection igm antibody elicited non-primary infection.
objective: comparative evaluation eight commercial hcmv igg avidity assays
currently available europe.
study design: panel 198 sequential samples collected 65 pregnant women 
at 0-90, 91-180, >180 days onset primary hcmv infection was
retrospectively tested abbott, biomÃ©rieux, bio-rad, diasorin, diesse,
euroimmun, radim, technogenetics hcmv igg avidity assays according the
manufacturer's instructions.
results: none 198 samples tested yielded identical scores kits
under evaluation. euroimmun radim assays showed best correlation with
expected results terms low (0-90 days), intermediate (90-180 days) high
(>180 days) avidity results, respectively. best accuracy diagnosing a
recent (<90 days onset) non-recent (>180 days onset)
primary hcmv infection shown radim followed euroimmun diesse. the
best correlation well established in-house developed hcmv igg avidity
assay shown radim.
conclusions: hcmv igg avidity kits need improved standardized. the
meantime, highly specific igm assays preferable screening purposes in
pregnant women.
