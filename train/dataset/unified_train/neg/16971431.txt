acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus largest known virus particle size
and genome complexity. 1.2-mb genome encodes 911 proteins, among only
298 predicted functions. composition purified isolated virions was
analyzed using combined electrophoresis/mass spectrometry approach allowing 
the identification 114 proteins. besides expected major structural
components, viral particle packages 12 proteins unambiguously associated with
transcriptional machinery, 3 proteins associated dna repair, 2
topoisomerases. main functional categories represented virion
include oxidative pathways protein modification. half the
identified virion-associated proteins correspond anonymous genes unknown
function, including 45 "orfans." demonstrated western blotting and
immunogold staining, "orfans," lack convincing similarity
in sequence databases, endowed antigenic properties. thus, anonymous
and unique genes constituting majority mimivirus gene complement
encode bona fide proteins likely participate well-integrated
processes.
