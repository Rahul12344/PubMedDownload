immune responses initiated hla-dr+ cells, present antigen t
cells. observations hla-dr may experimentally induced thyroid
epithelium hla-dr occurs thyrocytes autoimmune thyroid diseases
suggest mechanism autoimmunity special relevance organ-specific
diseases. involves local aberrant expression hla-dr antigens by
epithelial cells subsequent capacity present autoantigens occurring 
on surfaces lymphocytes. autoantigens cells recognise
infrequently restricted tissue location low concentration in
the circulation, t-cell tolerance unlikely, induction autoreactive t
cells would occur. interferon best known inducer dr antigen
expression viral infections may predate endocrine autoimmunity, following
sequence seems likely: local viral infection causes interferon production, 
or local environmental factors would induce dr expression,
presentation autoantigens, subsequent autoimmune t-cell induction. t
cells would activate effector b cells. whether initial induction of
autoimmune cells leads autoimmune disease would depend factors as
abnormalities suppressor t-cell pathway, reported coexist with
autoimmunity necessary induce autoimmune disease mice. mechanism
of autoimmune disease induction explains vague associations viral infections
and long latency periods disease becomes manifest gives simple
explanation well-documented association hla-dr autoimmune
diseases man.
