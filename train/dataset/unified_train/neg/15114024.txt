fusion mediated human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (hiv-1) envelope (env)
glycoprotein cellular cd4/chemokine receptor complex first step in
entry often analyzed cell-cell fusion assays require env
expression recombinant vaccinia viruses and/or target cell transfection.
primary lymphocytes macrophages principal targets hiv-1 vivo, 
but poor substrates transfection, constructing recombinant vaccinia
viruses expressing every novel mutant env gene laborious. chapter
describes fusion assay using two recombinant vaccinia viruses express
distinct rna polymerases suitable transfection-resistant targets, as
primary human lymphocytes macrophages. also uses env genes contained in
plasmid vectors, eliminating need construct recombinant vaccinia viruses
to analyze construct. effector 293t cells cotransfected sp6-driven 
reporter gene t7-driven env plasmids, infected recombinant vaccinia
virus expressing t7 polymerase. primary lymphocyte macrophage targets are
infected recombinant vaccinia virus expressing sp6 polymerase. fusion
mediated effector cell env endogenous cd4/coreceptors target
lymphocytes macrophages enables sp6 polymerase-mediated reporter gene
transactivation. approach provides efficient tool study fusion
mediated multiple-cloned primary isolate mutant hiv-1 env genes the
primary target cell types relevant infection vivo.
