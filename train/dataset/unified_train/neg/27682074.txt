virology probably rapidly developing field within clinical laboratory
medicine. adequate diagnostic methods exist diagnostics acute
viral infections. however, emergence pathogenic viruses virus strains and
new disease associations known viruses require establishment new
diagnostic methods, sometimes rapidly. field chronic persistent
viral diseases, particularly involving potential malignant fatal
development, constant need improved differential diagnostics,
monitoring, prognosis risk assessment. increasing understanding disease
pathogenesis also enables better patient management personalized medicine,
where companion diagnostics offer precise specific tools individual
care. often new tools offered molecular diagnostic techniques,
and includes detection micrornas (mirnas). mirnas small
regulatory rna molecules, regulate expression target genes.
they encoded viruses host, target either viral
or cellular gene expression. review diagnostic possibilities offered 
by mirna discussed. focus selected viral human mirnas 
in viral diseases, examples mirnas putative diagnostic potential will
be presented.
