hostas (hosta spp.) one widely grown economically important
landscape perennials nursery industry north america. several viruses
including hosta virus x (hvx), tobacco rattle virus (trv), tobacco ringspot virus
(torsv), tomato ringspot virus (tomrsv), impatiens necrotic spot virus (insv),
and tomato spotted wilt virus (tswv) known occur hostas (4). this
report confirms occurrence additional virus, arabis mosaic virus
(armv), hostas north america. virus first identified the
summer 2004 hosta fortunei 'sharmon' several garden centers in
minneapolis st. paul, mn. entire lots variety, numbering several
dozen plants, showed symptoms consisting blanching foliage similar to
those caused torsv tomrsv infection (4). symptoms persisted throughout the
growing season. virus-like particles, 28 30 nm diameter, observed by
electron microscopy partially purified extracts symptomatic leaf tissue
following fixation 5% glutaraldehyde negative staining 2% sodium
phosphotungstate, ph 7.0. particles angular outline were
penetrated stain. virus-like particles observed these
extracts. particles identified armv. identification made
using double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (das-elisa) 
immunosorbent electron microscopy (isem) antiserum armv (pvas-587)
obtained american type culture collection, manassas, va. spring
and summer 2005, armv identified described 'sharmon', h.
undulata 'albomarginata' samples minnesota, michigan, nebraska, h.
'marion bachman' h. 'touch class' two wholesale nurseries in
minnesota. symptoms hosta cultivars similar observed in
'sharmon' accompanied stunting leaf deformation. portion the
coat protein (cp) gene armv isolate 'sharmon', designated armv-h, was
amplified using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) with
armv-specific cp primers (3) total rna extracted rneasy plant mini kit
(qiagen inc., valencia, ca). amplicons expected size (220 bp) cloned 
and five clones sequenced. nucleotide sequence identities armv-h cp
sequence corresponding armv databank entries varied 94 88% (genbank
accession nos. ay017339 d10086 x55460 x81815, respectively).
interestingly, hosta armv isolate transmitted mechanical
inoculation diagnostically susceptible indicator plants (cucumber, tobacco,
and petunia) (2) hosta (h. undulata 'albormarginata', h. 'honeybells', 
h. 'royal standard'). testing using elisa isem showed 'sharmon'
source plants contained high levels armv antigen virions, high
percentage virions penetrated negative stain, indicating they
were empty (i.e., devoid rna). appears armv-h may transmitted
only vertically, (i.e., clonal propagation) raises interesting
questions molecular basis anomaly. isolate armv hops
was similarly reported restricted host range (1) suggesting a
possibility common mechanism host range restriction. references: (1) k.
