quantification adducts formed dna treated with
n-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene n-hydroxy-2-aminofluorene: comparison of
trifluoroacetic acid enzymatic degradation.

tang m, lieberman mw.

we examined two methods preparation dna adducts phi x174 rf dna
modified [3h]n-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene ([3h]na-aaf) or
n-hydroxy-2-aminofluorene ([3h]n-oh-af). hydrolysis enzymes (dnase i, snake
venom phosphodiesterase alkaline acid phosphatase) subsequent reverse 
phase h.p.l.c. phi x174 rf dna treated [3h]na-aaf yielded 73%
n-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-acetylaminofluorene (dg-c8-aaf), 7%
3-(deoxyguanosin-n2-yl)-2-acetylaminofluorene (dg-n2-aaf), peak of
unidentified radioactivity (13%). [3h]n-oh-af modified phi x174 dna was
analyzed, n-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-aminofluorene (dg-c8-af) large
percentage imidazole ring-opened derivative unidentified products were
found. contrast, anhydrous trifluoroacetic acid (tfa) used degrade
these dnas, found [3h]na-aaf modified dna 86%
n-(guanin-8-yl)-2-acetylaminofluorene (g-c8-aaf) 6%
3-(guanin-n2-yl)-2-acetylaminofluorene (g-n2-aaf), [3h]n-oh-af modified
dna n-(guanin-8-yl)-2-aminofluorene (g-c8-af) found. dna was
prepared human fibroblasts treated [3h]na-aaf, g-c8-af product
was obtained. thus, anhydrous tfa solvolysis followed reverse phase h.p.l.c.
is rapid convenient method obtain quantitative yields dna adducts
formed acetylaminofluorene related compounds: quantification this
method prevents loss g-n2-aaf adducts, conversion aaf adducts af
adducts, production ring opened products guanine residue.
