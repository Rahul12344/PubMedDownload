peginterferon-alpha-2a (40 kd) [pegasys] conjugate recombinant
interferon-alpha-2a 40 kd branched polyethylene glycol (peg) moiety is
highly active hepatitis c virus (hcv). ribavirin (copegus) synthetic
nucleoside analogue acts synergy antiviral activity of
peginterferon-alpha-2a (40 kd). combination subcutaneous
peginterferon-alpha-2a (40 kd) weekly plus oral ribavirin twice daily is
widely approved use adult patients chronic hepatitis c, including
those persistently 'normal' alt activity hiv-hcv co-infection, is
recommended first-line treatment option patients chronic hepatitis 
c compensated liver disease. randomized, phase iii trials, combination
has consistently demonstrated good therapeutic efficacy (i.e. high sustained
virological response [svr] rates) generally well tolerated both
treatment-naive treatment-experienced patients chronic hepatitis c,
including compensated advanced liver disease. several baseline and
dynamic (on-treatment) predictors svr used guide optimize
therapy also determined trials subsequent analyses. by
utilizing predictors, therapy peginterferon-alpha-2a (40 kd) plus
ribavirin individualized achieve optimal balance efficacy
and tolerability, increasing usefulness drug combination.
thus, peginterferon-alpha-2a (40 kd) plus ribavirin remains valuable therapy in
patients chronic hepatitis c, first-line option with
compensated liver disease second-line therapy advanced
liver disease.
