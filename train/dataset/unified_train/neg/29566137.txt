incarcerated populations experience elevated burdens infectious diseases,
which exacerbated limited access prevention measures. dynamic models
are used assess spread control diseases within correctional
facilities repercussions general population. systematic review 
dynamic models infectious diseases within correctional settings identified 34 
studies published 1996 2017. these, 23 focused disease dynamics
and intervention prison without accounting subsequent spread the
community. main diseases modeled studies human immunodeficiency
virus (hiv; n = 14, 41%), tuberculosis (tb; n = 10, 29%), hepatitis c virus
(hcv; n = 7, 21%). models fitted epidemiologic data 14 studies;
uncertainty sensitivity analyses conducted 8, validation model
projection empirical data done 1 study. according models,
prison-based screening treatment may highly effective strategies for
reducing burden hiv, tb, hcv, sexually transmissible infections 
among prisoners general community. decreasing incarceration rates were
projected reduce hiv hcv infections among people inject drugs tb
infections among prisoners. limitations modeling studies and
opportunities using dynamic models develop quantitative evidence for
informing prison infection control measures discussed.
