we examined levels delta-aminolevulinate synthase (alas) mrnas
encoding erythroid-specific (alas-e) nonspecific (alas-n) alas
isozymes murine friend virus-transformed erythroleukemia (mel) cells. both
alas-e alas-n mrnas detected clone dimethyl sulfoxide
(me2so)-sensitive mel cells, termed ds-19, without cross-hybridization. untreated
ds-19 cells contained approximately 10-fold alas-e mrna alas-n mrna.
when ds-19 cells treated me2so hemin, alas-n mrna declined rapidly, 
which followed marked increase alas-e mrna. similarly, the
immunoquantifiable alas-n protein decreased, alas-e protein increased
upon me2so treatment. clone me2so-resistant cells, termed dr-1, fails 
to undergo erythroid differentiation, found lack alas-e mrna, whereas it
showed significant induction responses mrnas heme pathway enzymes by
me2so treatment. dr-1 cells contained similar level erythroid-specific
transcription factor, gata-1, ds-19 cells, neither major deletion 
nor rearrangement alas-e gene. findings indicate genes
encoding two alas isozymes separate controls suggest that
alas-e mrna accumulation responsible increased heme synthesis mel cells
undergoing erythroid differentiation.
