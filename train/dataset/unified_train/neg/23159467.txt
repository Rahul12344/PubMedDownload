ability cocktail five lytic vibriophages combatting vibrio cholerae o1
infection rabbit model examined. one group, rabbits administered 1
× 10(8) plaque forming unit phage cocktail 6 12 h prior the
administration v. cholerae o1, group, procedure was
applied 6 12 h post infection. observed oral administration of
the phage cocktail oral bacterial challenge lowered shedding of
bacteria significantly (p < 0.01). contrast phage treatment prior bacterial
challenge effect (p > 0.05). results suggest oral administration
of phage subsequent v. cholerae challenge could provide possible means of
combatting v. cholerae infection.
