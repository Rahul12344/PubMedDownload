aberrant microrna expression involved regulation various cellular
processes, proliferation metastasis multiple diseases including
cancers. microrna-30e-5p (mir-30e) previously reported oncogenic or
tumour suppressing mirna malignancies, function lung
adenocarcinoma (lac) remains largely undefined. study, found 
expression mir-30e increased lac tissues cell lines, associated
with tumour size represented independent prognostic factor overall
survival recurrence lac patients. functional experiments showed
that knockdown mir-30e suppressed cell growth overexpression
promoted growth lac cells xenografts vitro vivo.
mechanistically, ptpn13 identified direct target mir-30e lac, in
which ptpn13 expression down-regulated lac tissues showed inverse 
correlation mir-30e expression. overexpression ptpn13 inhibited cell
growth rescued proliferation-promoting effect mir-30e through
inhibition egfr signalling. altogether, findings suggest mir-30e 
could function oncogene lac via targeting ptpn13 act potential 
therapeutic target treating lac.
