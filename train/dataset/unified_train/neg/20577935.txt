hematopoietic cell transplantation (hct) involves intravenous infusion of
hematopoietic progenitor cells hla-matched donor (allogeneic) the
patient (autologous). prior hct, recipient prepared (conditioning) with
high-dose chemotherapy radiotherapy (or both) destroy defective bone marrow
or residual cancer cells. allogeneic hct, need chronic
immunosuppression prevent graft rejection graft-versus-host disease
(gvhd). frequency type neurologic complications depends type of
hct, underlying disease, case ascertainment. review, the
neurologic complications presented according stage hct they
are likely occur: (1) conditioning-drug-related encephalopathies and
seizures complications secondary medical procedures; (2) bone marrow
depletion-metabolic drug-related encephalopathies seizures, septic
cerebral infarctions, hemorrhages; (3) chronic immunosuppression-infections
by viruses opportunistic organisms; (4) late events-central nervous
system (cns) relapses original disease, neurologic complications gvhd, 
and second neoplasms.
