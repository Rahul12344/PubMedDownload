herpes simplex virus type 1 purified density gradient centrifugation, 
the virion-associated proteins resolved sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. western blot (immunoblot) analysis
with anti-icp4 monospecific serum, results indicated icp4, one the
five immediate-early proteins herpes simplex virus type 1, associated with
the purified virions. define location icp4 within virion, trypsin
digestion experiments performed. purified virions treated trypsin 
in presence absence detergent. virus envelope appeared protect
icp4 trypsin, since virus-associated icp4 sensitive digestion
only detergent treatment. addition, icp4 remained associated the
virus particle virion-specific glycoproteins removed after
detergent treatment. finally, icp4 detected purified preparations of
type b capsids isolated nuclear fraction virus-infected cells. 
the above-mentioned data suggest detectable amounts icp4 present
within tegument region virion.
