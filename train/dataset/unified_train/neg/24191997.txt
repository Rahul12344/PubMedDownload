we provide first description virus responsible systemic
hemorrhagic disease causing high mortality farmed rice field eels monopterus
albus china. typical signs exhibited diseased fish extensive
hemorrhages skin viscera neurological signs, loss 
equilibrium disorganized swimming. histopathological examination revealed
various degrees necrosis within spleen liver. virus isolation was
attempted visceral tissues diseased fish inoculation 6 fish cell
lines. typical cytopathic effects (cpe) produced bluegill fry (bf2)
cells, cell line chosen isolation propagation 
virus. electron microscopy observation showed negative stained viral
particles characteristic bullet shape rhabdoviruses estimated
size 60 Ã— 120 nm. therefore tentatively refer virus monopterus
albus rhabdovirus (moarv). molecular characterization moarv, including
sequence analysis nucleoprotein (n), phosphoprotein (p), glycoprotein 
(g) genes, revealed 94.5 97.3% amino acid similarity siniperca
chuatsi rhabdovirus. phylogenetic analysis based amino acid sequences n
and g proteins indicated moarv member genus
vesiculovirus. koch's postulates fulfilled infecting healthy rice field
eels moarv, produced acute infection. rt-pcr analysis demonstrated 
that moarv rna could detected naturally experimentally infected
fish. data suggest moarv causative pathogen disease.
