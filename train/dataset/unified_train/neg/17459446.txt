infection primary cultures human immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells 
(modc) paramyxovirus simian virus 5 (sv5) results extensive
cytopathic effect (cpe) induction apoptosis, dc maturation pathways
are activated. study, investigated relationship between
sv5-induced apoptosis lack dc maturation. reducing cpe apoptosis
in sv5-infected immature dc addition pancaspase inhibitor resulted in
only low level expression maturation markers cd40, cd80 cd86, suggesting
that sv5 infection either actively blocked maturation pathways failed to
provide sufficient signals activate maturation. distinguish these
hypotheses, sv5-infected immature dc challenged agonists stimulate
toll-like receptors (tlrs). treatment tlr-4 agonist lps tlr-6 agonist
fsl1 enhanced cell surface expression cd40, cd80 cd86 sv5-infected
cells levels approaching mock-infected tlr-treated modc, treatment
with agonists tlr-2, -3, -5 -8 little effect. addition tlr-4 -6 
agonists sv5-infected dc also dramatically reduced cpe apoptosis, 
levels viral protein virus yield affected. similarly,
sv5-infected immature modc matured treatment il-1beta, these
mature infected cells also showed reduced cpe apoptosis. presence of
nfkb inhibitors, tlr-4 -6 agonists promote maturation reduce
apoptosis sv5-infected dc, indicating maturation cell survival were
both dependent signaling nfkb-dependent pathways. results suggest 
a model whereby sv5 replication induces apoptosis immature dc fails to
provide strong maturation signals, activation nfkb-dependent pathways by
exogenous ligands lead modc maturation override sv5-induced cell
death.
