to generate sufficient clinical-grade vector support phase i/ii clinical
trial adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (aav8)-mediated factor ix (fix) gene
transfer hemophilia b, developed large-scale, good manufacturing
practice (gmp)-compatible method vector production purification. used 
a 293t-based two-plasmid transient transfection system coupled a
three-column chromatography purification process produce high-quality
self-complementary aav2/8 fix clinical-grade vector. two consecutive production
campaigns using total 432 independent 10-stack culture chambers produced a
total ∼2 × 10(15) vector genomes (vg) dot-blot hybridization.
benzonase-treated microfluidized lysates generated pellets transfected
cells purified group separation sepharose beads followed by
anion-exchange chromatography. virus-containing fractions further
processed gel filtration ultrafiltration, using 100-kda membrane. the
vector formulated phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.25% human serum
albumin. spectrophotometric analysis suggested ∼20% full particles, low
quantities nonviral proteins visible silver-stained sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. sensitive assay detection of
replication-competent aav developed, reveal trace quantities of
such contaminants final product. additional studies confirmed the
long-term stability vector -80°c least 24 months at
least 24 hr formulated clinical diluent stored room temperature
within intravenous bags. material approved use clinical
trials united states united kingdom.
