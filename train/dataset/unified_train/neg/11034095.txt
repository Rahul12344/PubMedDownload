ctls specific p53 previously shown efficiently eradicate
p53-overexpressing tumor cells vitro well vivo. report, we
demonstrate ctls also eliminate tumors display moderate or
even low levels p53. neither high steady-state levels p53 elevated p53 
synthesis prerequisite recognition tumors p53-specific ctls.
instead, data show high p53 turnover rate important factor in
determining sensitivity tumor cells p53-specific ctls. data suggest
that p53 turnover related mhc class i-restricted presentation of
p53-derived epitopes tumor cell surface indicate ctl-mediated
immunotherapy targets p53 applied wider range tumors has
thus far anticipated.
