lymphocyte g0/g1 switch genes (g0s genes) potential oncogenes may
regulate, regulated by, coordinately regulated with, latent lymphotropic
viruses. identify genes, cdna library prepared blood
mononuclear cells cultured 2 hr t-cell mitogen (lectin) 
and cycloheximide. eight differentially hybridizing recombinants were
characterized rna dna blotting sequencing. one cdna (g0s7)
corresponded oncogene c-fos. another cdna (g0s19) homologous (70%) 
a cdna encoding murine inhibitor stem cell proliferation (the cytokine mip1 
alpha) and, less closely, members "small inducible" secreted
protein-encoding gene family. whereas cdna hybridization genomic dna blots
indicated small subfamily g0s19 genes, simple patterns bands indicated
that cdnas, including g0s30 cdna, corresponded single-copy genes. 3' 
noncoding sequence g0s30 cdna homologous (87-89%) 3' noncoding
sequences certain rodent genes (ngfi-a, krox24, egr1) encode zinc finger 
proteins (putative transcriptional regulators). degree evolutionary
conservation suggests important function 3' noncoding region. 3'
noncoding regions cdnas contained ttatttat (mrna destabilization)
element. corresponding rnas formed doublets agarose gels. previous
studies c-fos rna hela cells indicate due to
cycloheximide-dependent stabilization poly(a) tails. results reveal the
power cycloheximide enrichment isolating would appear be
significant low-abundance mrnas.
