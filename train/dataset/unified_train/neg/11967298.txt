there currently intensive research design novel human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) vaccine immunogens elicit potent
neutralizing antibodies. prerequisite comparing optimizing these
strategies ability precisely measure neutralizing antibody responses.
to end, sought develop assay directly quantifies single-round 
hiv-1 infection peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc). initial experiments
demonstrated essentially productively infected pbmc could identified 
by flow cytometric detection intracellular p24 antigen (p24-ag). after
infection pbmc hiv-1, p24(+) lymphocytes could distinguished beginning
1 day postinfection, majority cd8(-) cells p24-ag positive 3
to 4 days postinfection. directly quantify first-round infection, included 
a protease inhibitor pbmc cultures. resulting 2-day assay highly
sensitive specific detection hiv-1-infected pbmc. serial dilutions
of virus stocks demonstrated number target cells infected was
directly related amount infectious virus input assay. in
neutralization assays, flow cytometric enumeration first-round infection
of pbmc provided quantitative data number target cells infected 
the inactivation infectious virus due reaction antibody. also used 
this single-round assay compare percentage cells expressing p24-ag to
the number copies hiv-1 gag per 100 pbmc. precision reproducibility
of assay facilitate measurement hiv-1 neutralization,
particularly incrementally improved neutralizing antibody responses generated 
new candidate vaccines.
