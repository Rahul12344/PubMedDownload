circular rnas (circrnas) noncoding single-stranded rna transcripts able
to form covalently circular-closed structures. generated through
alternative splicing events widely expressed human viruses. circrnas 
have appointed potential regulators micrornas (mirnas), rna-binding
proteins (rpbs), lineal protein-coding transcripts. although mechanism 
of action remains unclear, deregulation circular rnas confirmed
in different diseases alzheimer cancer.the introduction of
high-throughput next-generation sequencing (ngs) technology provides millions 
short rna sequences single-nucleotide level, allowing accurate and
proficient method measure circular rnas. novel protocols based on
non-polyadenylated rnas, rrna-depleted, rna exonuclease-based enrichment
approaches (rnase r) taken even possibility detecting
circrnas.besides, identification circrnas presence requires the
development specific bioinformatics tools detect junction-spanning
sequences transcriptome deep-sequencing samples. thus, recently established 
bioinformatics' approaches permitted discovery elevated number 
different circrnas diverse organisms. sense, recent studies have
compared different methods advocate simultaneous use one
prediction tool. reason, want highlight pipelines as
miarma-seq able execute various circular rna identification algorithms
in easy way, without tedious installation third-party prerequisites.
