vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) proven one most
effective growth factors therapeutic angiogenesis. biological efficacy of
the adeno-associated virus (aav) vector recently demonstrated muscle 
tissues, including heart. apart promising insights vegf and
the aav vector, studies vegf gene transfer using aav vector been
limited. here, evaluate aav-mediated vegf gene transfer, vitro 
vivo, using aav-mvegf vector contains cdna murine vegf(120) within
an hcmv-driven expression cassette. transient transfection aav-mvegf plasmid
significantly increased mvegf expression 293t cells. secreted vegf 
conditioned medium strong biological activity, confirmed miles'
vascular permeability assay. transduction 293t hela cells aav-mvegf
stock high titer, essentially adenovirus-free, showed significantly
increased mvegf expression aav-egfp-transduced cells. human
umbilical vein endothelial cells transduced, higher level mvegf
expression, together higher cell counts, observed compared to
aav-egfp-transduced cells. vivo transduction mouse tibialis anterior muscle
resulted increased level mvegf expression, higher
capillary-to-myofibre ratio, 8 weeks post-transduction. rat hindlimb
ischemia model, regional blood flow, well capillary-to-myofibre ratio, 
was significantly increased 4 weeks post-transduction. findings
demonstrate efficient delivery vegf gene using aav vector, which
has implications angiogenic gene therapy ischemic diseases.
