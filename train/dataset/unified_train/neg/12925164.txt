since introduction mandatory hcv rna testing plasma pools for
fractionation nucleic acid amplification technology, organised
external quality assessment studies (eqas) addressed blood products
manufacturers blood centres. report results new eqa, the
first one include six major hcv genotypes. results, reported by
laboratories worldwide, showed genotypes 1, 2 3 correctly
identified 100% tests, genotype 4 96.7% genotypes 5 6 in
98.3% assays. detection hcv genotypes critical for
laboratories involved testing plasma hcv, six genotypes should
continue included next eqa studies.
