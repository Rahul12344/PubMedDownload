diagnosis nervous necrosis virus (nnv) infection susceptible fish species
is mostly performed post-mortem due neurotropism causative agent
and validated diagnostic assays require samples brain retinal
tissue. however, non-lethal alternative test exposure fish nnv 
needed. indirect elisa detection anti-nnv antibodies was
recently developed evaluated detect responses sera immunized
fish. study, assessed accuracy assay detecting specific
antibodies naturally exposed fish using field samples populations 
differing infection status. applied bayesian model, using rtqpcr second
test. median estimates diagnostic sensitivity specificity vnn
elisa 81.8% 86.7%, respectively. concluded assay fit for
the purpose identifying animals naturally exposed populations. further
evaluation larger populations test might used inform implementation 
of control measures, estimating infection prevalence facilitate risk
analysis. knowledge first report diagnostic accuracy of
an antibody elisa infectious disease finfish.
