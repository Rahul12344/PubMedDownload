rotavirus entry cell complex multistep process different
domains rotavirus surface proteins interact different cell surface
molecules, act attachment entry receptors. recently described 
molecules include several integrins heat shock protein, been
found associated cell membrane lipid microdomains. requirement
during viral entry several cell molecules, might required be
present organized precise fashion, could explain selective cell 
tissue tropism viruses. review focuses recent data describing
the virus-receptor interactions, role lipid microdomains rotavirus
infection mechanism rotavirus cell entry.
