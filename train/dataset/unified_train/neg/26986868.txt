the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection shows variable rate disease
progression. underlying biological molecular mechanisms involved in
determining progression hiv infection fully understood. aims of
this study determine plasma concentrations active tgf β 1, th1 th2
cytokines patients non-progressive progressive hiv-1
infection, well determine association cytokines 
to disease progression. cross-sectional study 61 hiv-1 infected
individuals categorized according disease progression having
non-progressive hiv-1 infection (n=14) progressive infection (n=47), plasma
levels active tgf β 1, inf-γ, tnf-α, il-10, il-1β, il-12p70 il-13 were
compared hiv uninfected healthy controls (n=12). plasma concentration of
these cytokines measured using highly sensitive luminex200 xmap assay.
pearson correlation test used assess correlation cytokines with
cd4+ cd8+ cells, cd4:cd8 ratio plasma hiv-1 rna different study 
groups. plasma concentrations tgf β 1 il-10 significantly decreased
while il-1β, il-12p70 tnf-α increased patients non-progressive
hiv-1 infection compared patients progressive infection. plasma levels of
tgf β 1 il-10 showed inverse correlation cd8+ cell counts and
cd4:cd8 ratios patients non-progressive hiv-1 infection, plasma
hiv-1 rna positively correlated cd4+ cell counts. plasma levels tnf-α, 
il-1β, il-12p70 il-13 positively correlated cd4+ cell counts and
inversely correlated plasma hiv-1 rna, cd8+ cell count cd4:cd8 ratio
in patients non-progressive infection. correlation cytokines the
state t-lymphocyte plasma hiv-1 rna found study may provide
insight role cytokines progressive non-progressive hiv-1 
infection. additionally, findings may implications systemic
cytokine-based therapies hiv-1 infection.
