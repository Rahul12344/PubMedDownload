simultaneous detection identification multiple pathogens required in
many diagnostic fields. study novel method based multiplex ligase 
detection (ld)-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) microarray (mlpm) described
to detect simultaneously several swine viruses involved reproductive and/or
respiratory problems. multiplex diagnostic system validated using
standard plasmids, clinical samples. using strategy 10 copies 
of target plasmids detected successfully. probe pair yielded specific
positive signal target site. addition, six target plasmids
were present simultaneously sufficient robust signals generated their
corresponding sites six plasmid templates obvious signals detected
in non-target sites. compared real-time pcr, mlpm showed specificities and
sensitivities 95.7-100% 100% 47 clinical samples tested, respectively.
the results demonstrate novel assay specific, sensitive, and
multiplex diagnostic method detection multiple pathogens also be
adapted easily diagnostic purposes.
