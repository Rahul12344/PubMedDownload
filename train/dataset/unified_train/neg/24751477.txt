thrombocytopenia altered coagulation characterize hantavirus infections. 
to assess newly discovered predictive biomarkers disease severity 
during acute puumala virus (puuv) infection, studied associations 
them variables reflecting coagulation, fibrinolysis endothelial
activation. nineteen hospital-treated patients serologically confirmed acute
puuv infection included. acutely, plasma levels pentraxin-3 (ptx3),
cell-free dna (cf-dna), complement components sc5b-9 c3 interleukin-6
(il-6) recorded well platelet ligands markers coagulation and
fibrinolysis. high values plasma ptx3 associated thrombin formation
(prothrombin fragments f1+2; r = 0.46, p = 0.05), consumption platelet ligand 
fibrinogen (r = -0.70, p < 0.001) natural anticoagulants antithrombin (at) (r
= -0.74, p < 0.001), protein c (r = -0.77, p < 0.001) protein free antigen 
(r = -0.81, p < 0.001) decreased endothelial marker adamts13 (a disintegrin
and metalloproteinase thrombospondin type 1 domain 13) (r = -0.48, p =
0.04). plasma level associated c3 (r = 0.76, p < 0.001), il-6 (r =
-0.56, p = 0.01) cf-dna (r = -0.47, p = 0.04). high cf-dna coincided with
increased prothrombin fragments f1+2 (r = 0.47, p = 0.04). low c3 levels
reflecting activation complement system alternative route
predicted loss natural anticoagulants (for protein c r = 0.53, p = 0.03
and protein free antigen r = 0.64, p = 0.004). variables depicting altered 
coagulation follow new predictive biomarkers disease severity, especially 
ptx3, acute puuv infection. findings consistent previous
observations biomarkers also predictive low platelet count and
underline cross-talk inflammation coagulation systems acute puuv
infection.
