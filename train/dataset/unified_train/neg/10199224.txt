objectives: use follow-up untreated hiv-positive men assess the
prognostic information provided baseline data plasma hiv rna, cd4 cell
count, age, hiv-related symptom status, separately three specific
aids-defining illnesses: pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (pcp), cytomegalovirus
(cmv), mycobacterium avium complex (mac).
methods: study population 734 hiv-positive homosexual men enrolled in
the multicenter aids cohort study, follow-up (1984-1985 mid-1988)
restricted antiretroviral treatment-free prophylaxis-free era.
baseline marker values categorized assessed predictor variables in
separate time-to-event analyses three specific outcomes.
results: total 138 cases pcp, 25 cases cmv, 25 cases mac were
observed. pcp cmv, higher categories hiv rna lower categories of
cd4 cell count associated increased risk relative respective
reference groups. mac, oral candidiasis fever elevated hiv rna at
baseline primary risk factors. analysis highlighted the
importance monitoring hiv rna levels addition cd4 cell counts when
evaluating patients' risk developing pcp.
conclusions: absence treatment, plasma hiv rna levels provide
prognostic information risk three specific aids-defining
illnesses, independently cd4 cell count. data provide useful
reference researchers investigate changing patterns incidence and
predictors opportunistic infections era increasingly active
antiretroviral therapies.
