protein glycosylation regulates externalization two distinct classes of
glucocorticoid-induced glycoproteins rat hepatoma cells.

the relationship protein glycosylation externalization of
glucocorticoid inducible alpha1-acid glycoprotein mouse mammary tumor virus
glycoproteins examined m1.54, clonal population mouse mammary tumor
virus-infected rat hepatoma cells. multiple freeze-thaw isolated microsomes
revealed alpha 1-acid glycoprotein carried cell a
soluble component vesicles, extracellular viral glycoproteins initially
membrane-associated. concentrations tunicamycin specifically inhibited
n-linked protein glycosylation, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein fractionated between
the cellular extracellular compartments. thus, approximately one half 
newly synthesized, nonglycosylated (22,000 mr) alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was
rapidly secreted kinetics similar glycosylated counterpart (release
half-time 60 min), remaining species first localized undefined
intracellular compartment prior slow secretion (release half-time 24
h). distribution nonglycosylated alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was
observed various absolute levels polypeptide, suggesting 
due simply saturation efficient secretory pathway high
polypeptide levels. contrast alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, labeled viral
antigens released tunicamycin-treated m1.54, nonglycosylated
viral precursor glycopolyprotein expressed intracellularly. taken together,
these results suggest carbohydrate attachment strongly regulates the
externalization alpha 1-acid glycoprotein mouse mammary tumor virus
species, represent two distinct classes extracellular glycoproteins.
