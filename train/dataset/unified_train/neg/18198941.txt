background: worldwide, vaginal transmission accounts half of
newly acquired hiv-1 infections. despite urgency develop implement
novel approaches capable preventing hiv transmission, process been
hindered lack adequate small animal models preclinical efficacy and
safety testing. given importance route transmission, we
investigated susceptibility humanized mice intravaginal hiv-1
infection.
methods findings: show female reproductive tract humanized
bone marrow-liver-thymus (blt) mice reconstituted human cd4+ 
relevant human cells, rendering humanized mice susceptible intravaginal 
infection hiv-1. effects hiv-1 infection include cd4+ cell depletion in
gut-associated lymphoid tissue (galt) closely mimics observed in
hiv-1-infected humans. also show pre-exposure prophylaxis with
antiretroviral drugs highly effective method preventing vaginal hiv-1
transmission. whereas 88% (7/8) blt mice inoculated vaginally hiv-1
became infected, none animals (0/5) given pre-exposure prophylaxis of
emtricitabine (ftc)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tdf) showed evidence of
infection (chi square = 7.5, df = 1, p = 0.006).
conclusions: fact humanized blt mice susceptible intravaginal
infection makes system excellent candidate preclinical evaluation 
both microbicides pre-exposure prophylactic regimens. utility of
humanized mice study intravaginal hiv-1 transmission particularly
highlighted demonstration pre-exposure prophylaxis prevent
intravaginal hiv-1 transmission blt mouse model.
