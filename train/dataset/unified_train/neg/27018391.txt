the βc1 protein encoded tomato yellow leaf curl china virus-associated
betasatellite functions pathogenicity determinant. better understand 
molecular basis whereby βc1 functions pathogenicity, yeast two-hybrid screen
of tobacco cdna library carried using βc1 bait. the screen
revealed βc1 interacts tobacco ring-finger protein designated ntrfp1,
which confirmed bimolecular fluorescence complementation and
co-immunoprecipitation assays nicotiana benthamiana cells. expression of
ntrfp1 induced βc1, in vitro ubiquitination assays showed ntrfp1 
is functional e3 ubiquitin ligase mediates βc1 ubiquitination. in
addition, βc1 shown ubiquitinated in vivo degraded plant 26s
proteasome. viral infection, plants overexpressing ntrfp1 developed
attenuated symptoms, whereas plants silenced expression ntrfp1 showed
severe symptoms. lines evidence showed ntrfp1 attenuates
βc1-induced symptoms promoting degradation 26s proteasome.
taken together, results suggest that tobacco ring e3 ligase ntrfp1 attenuates
disease symptoms interacting βc1 mediate ubiquitination and
degradation via ubiquitin/26s proteasome system.
