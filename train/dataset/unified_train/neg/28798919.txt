modern swine production facilities typically house dense populations pigs 
may harbor variety potentially zoonotic viruses pass one pig
generation another periodically infect human caretakers. bioaerosol
sampling common technique used conduct microbial risk
assessments swine production, similar settings, number of
years. however, much work seems focused detection 
non-viral microbial agents (i.e., bacteria, fungi, endotoxins, etc.), efforts
to detect viral aerosols pig farms seem sparse. data generated studies
would particularly useful assessments virus transmission ecology.
here, summarize results literature review conducted identify
published articles related bioaerosol generation detection within swine
production facilities, focus airborne viruses. identified 73
scientific reports, published 1991 2017, included 
review. these, 19 (26.7%) used sampling methodology detection of
viruses. findings show bioaerosol sampling methodologies swine
production settings predominately focused detection bacteria and
fungi, apparent standardization different approaches.
information, specifically regarding virus aerosol burden swine production
settings, appears limited. however, number viral aerosol studies has
markedly increased past 5â€‰years. advent new sampling
technologies improved diagnostics, viral bioaerosol sampling could a
promising way conduct non-invasive viral surveillance among swine farms.
