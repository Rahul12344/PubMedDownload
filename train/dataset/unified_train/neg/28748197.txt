background: despite advent combination antiretroviral therapy (cart),
patients human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) continue develop late-stage
complications including acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids), disseminated 
mycobacterium avium complex (dmac), death.
methods: performed observational retrospective cohort study hiv-infected
adults developed dmac duke university health system 1992 2015 
to determine incidence, long-term outcomes, healthcare utilization of
this population high risk poor outcomes. findings stratified the
"pre-cart" era (before january 1, 1996) "post-cart" thereafter.
results: identified 330 adult hiv-infected patients newly diagnosed dmac,
the majority (75.2%) male non-hispanic black (69.1%), with
median age 37 years. incidence dmac declined significantly 65.3/1000
in 1992 2.0/1000 2015, proportion females non-hispanic
blacks significantly higher post-cart era. standardized mortality 
ratios dmac patients received cart 69, 58, 27, 5.9, 6.8 years
1-5, respectively, dmac diagnosis. patients diagnosed dmac 2000
or later (n = 135), 20% newly diagnosed hiv 3 months preceding
presentation dmac. established hiv median time hiv
diagnosis dmac diagnosis 7 years likely black,
rehospitalized 6 months dmac diagnosis, die long term.
conclusions: disseminated mycobacterium avium complex continues lethal
diagnosis cart era, disproportionately afflicts minority populations, 
reflects delayed entry care failure consistently engage care.
