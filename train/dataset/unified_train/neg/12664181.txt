the glycoalkaloid content transgenic potatoes evaluated optimised
method based non-aqueous capillary electrophoresis coupled on-line with
electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (nace-esi-ms). potato material
consisted tubers conventional cv. désirée three lines of
modified plants resistant, intermediate susceptible infection potato
virus (pvy). main glycoalkaloids confirmed alpha-solanine and
alpha-chaconine parent ion masses m/z 852 868, respectively. in
addition, unknown minor peak m/z 850.6 found conventional
(control) susceptible line potato tubers. compound exhibited ms(2) 
spectrum fragments ions 704 396 m/z derived loss two ions, i.e.
m/z 146 307, likely corresponding rhamnose unit a
[glucose-(rhamnose)(2)] moiety, respectively. 30-80-fold higher
concentrations total glycoalkaloids found peel compared flesh
samples tubers examined. tga content nearly doubled peel samples of
resistant compared control lines, levels lower limit
recommended food safety, i.e. 20-60 mg tga per 100 g fresh weight.
moreover, established tubers produced virus-resistant clones are
substantially equivalent glycoalkaloid contents produced by
conventional potato varieties.
