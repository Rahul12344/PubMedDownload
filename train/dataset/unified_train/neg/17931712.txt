we describe paper synthetic chloroxoquinolinic ribonucleoside
6-chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-1-(beta-d-ribofuranosyl) quinoline-3-carboxylic acid
(compound a) free aglycogene base (compound b) inhibit, low
cytotoxicity, replication herpes simplex virus type 1 2 (hsv-1 and
hsv-2). compound inhibited hsv-1 replication vero cells ec(50) of
1.3 1.4 microm acyclovir (acv)-sensitive strain acv-resistant
strain virus, respectively. additionally, inhibited hsv-2 replication 
with ec(50) 1.1 microm. compound b also inhibited acv-sensitive and
-resistant hsv-1 strains, hsv-2 ec(50) values 1.7, 1.9 1.6 microm, 
respectively. time-of-addition assays, performed compound a, suggested 
this molecule early time point hsv replication cycle. kinetic assays
demonstrated compounds b inhibit hsv dna polymerase activity 
noncompetitive fashion, k(i) equal 0.1 0.2 microm, respectively.
taken together, results suggest compounds b represent promising
lead molecules anti-hsv drug design.
