an intragenic enhancer pol gene human immunodeficiency virus type 1 has
previously identified (verdin et al., proc. natl. acad. sci. usa
87:4874-4878, 1990). element composed two subdomains exhibiting
phorbol ester-inducible enhancing activity viral thymidine kinase promoter
in hela cells. examination nucleotide sequence one domains
(nucleotides 4079 4342, hxb2 isolate) revealed presence three short dna
regions highly homologous recognition site cellular transcription
factor ap-1. two short oligonucleotides containing ap-1 sites each
functioned phorbol ester-inducible enhancer cloned upstream the
thymidine kinase promoter transfected hela cells. gel mobility shift
assays competition experiments using two oligonucleotides
demonstrated bound affinity-purified ap-1 ap-1 present uninduced 
and 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced hela nuclear extracts.
footprinting experiments confirmed three predicted sites bound purified 
ap-1. results suggest ap-1 factor could play role the
transcriptional regulation human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gene
expression.
