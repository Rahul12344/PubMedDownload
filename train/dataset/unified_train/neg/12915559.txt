the moloney murine leukemia virus (mlv) repressor binding site (rbs) major
determinant restricted expression mlv undifferentiated mouse embryonic
stem (es) cells mouse embryonal carcinoma (ec) lines. show the
rbs repressed expression placed outside normal mlv genome context 
a self-inactivating (sin) lentiviral vector. lentiviral vector genome
context, rbs repressed expression modified mlv long terminal repeat
(mndu3) promoter, simian virus 40 promoter, three cellular promoters:
ubiquitin c, mpgk, hef-1a. addition repressing expression in
undifferentiated es ec cell lines, show rbs substantially
repressed expression primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts, primary mouse bone
marrow stromal cells, whole mouse bone marrow differentiated progeny
after bone marrow transplant, several mouse hematopoietic cell lines. using
an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, show binding factor a, the
trans-acting factor proposed convey repression interaction the
rbs, present nuclear extracts mouse cells analyzed where
expression repressed rbs. addition, show rbs partially 
repressed expression human hematopoietic cell line du.528 primary
human cd34(+) cd38(-) hematopoietic cells isolated umbilical cord blood.
these findings suggest retroviral vectors carrying rbs subjected 
high rates repression murine human cells mlv vectors with
primer binding site substitutions remove rbs may yield more-effective
gene expression.
