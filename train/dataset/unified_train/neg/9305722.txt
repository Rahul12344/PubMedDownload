human antibodies specific digoxigenin, estradiol, testosterone and
progesterone isolated small combinatorial igm repertoire (4 x
10(7)) single chain antibodies (scfv). affinities the
anti-estradiol antiprogesterone scfv approximately 10(8) m(-1). naive
igm genes appeared highly represented, since heavy chain variable 
domain anti estradiol antibody contained differences corresponding
germline sequences. light chain variable domain progesterone receptor 
was also identical germline sequence, showing possible for
completely naive antibodies bind steroids affinities comparable 
obtained secondary immune response.
