to determine optimal conditions preparation serum specimens for
quantitative hepatitis c virus rna determination, patient samples processed 
such differences time clot formation centrifugation,
centrifugation separation serum collection serum freezing
could independently assessed. effects multiple cycles freezing and
thawing also determined. progressive significant loss of
hepatitis c virus rna activity time formation clot until
centrifugation longer 2 hr. reduction reached 32% 6 hr and
49% 24 hr. centrifugation performed immediately formation of
the clot, loss hepatitis c virus rna activity reduced less 10%
even though serum remained unseparated clot 6 hr.
centrifugation blood paraffin plug (serum separator tube) prevented 
loss hepatitis c virus rna activity 24 hr. loss of
hepatitis c virus rna activity three freeze-thaw cycles. patient 
specimens prepared optimal conditions, sensitivity the
quantitative branched dna signal amplification assay patients hepatitis c
virus infection 83% specificity patients liver disease was
100%. fluctuations hepatitis c virus rna levels shown correlate with
biochemical changes observed patients treated recombinant
interferon-alpha 2b. data demonstrate improper inconsistent methods
of serum preparation may result falsely low unreliable levels hepatitis
