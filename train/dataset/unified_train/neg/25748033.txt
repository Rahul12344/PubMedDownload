a novel avian influenza (h7n9) virus causes severe human infections was
first identified march 2013 china. h7n9 virus exhibited two
epidemiological peaks infection, occurring week 15 2013 week 5 of
2014. taiwan, geographically adjacent china, faces large risk of
being affected virus. extensive surveillance, launched april
2013, four laboratory-confirmed h7n9 cases imported china been
identified taiwan. h7n9 virus isolated imported case 1 may 2013
(during first wave) found closest genetically virus wild 
birds differed prototype virus, a/anhui/1/2013, mp gene. 
other three imported cases detected december 2013 april 2014 (during 
the second wave). viruses isolated cases 2 4 similar the
compositions 6 internal genes distinct a/anhui/1/2013 the
pb2 mp genes, whereas virus isolated case 3 exhibited novel
reassortment identified previously different from
a/anhui/1/2013 pb2, pa mp genes. four imported h7n9 viruses share 
similar antigenicity a/anhui/1/2013, ha na genes grouped
together respective phylogenies. contrast ha na genes,
which exhibited smaller degree diversity, internal genes were
heterogeneous provided potential distinctions transmission sources in
terms geography hosts. important strengthen surveillance 
influenza share viral genetic data real-time reducing threat of
rapid continuing evolution h7n9 viruses.
