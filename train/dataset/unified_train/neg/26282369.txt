the objective study determine abundance distribution γδ
t lymphocytes lymphoid tissue acute infection high (hv) low
virulence (lv) non-cytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus (bvdv) beef calves. 
this study performed using tissue samples previous experiment which
thirty beef calves randomly assigned 1 3 groups: lv [n=10; animals
inoculated intranasally (in) lv bvdv-1a (strain sd-1)], hv [n=10; animals
inoculated hv bvdv-2 (strain 1373)], control (n=10; animals
inoculated cell culture medium). day 5 post inoculation, animals were
euthanized, samples spleen mesenteric lymph nodes (mln) were
collected assess abundance wc1(+) γδ cells. higher proportion of
calves challenged bvdv showed signs apoptosis cytophagy mln and
spleen samples compared control group. significantly lower number γδ 
t cells observed spleen mln calves hv lv groups in
the control calves (p<0.05). conclusion, acute infection hv lv bvdv
resulted depletion wc1(+) γδ cells mucosal systemic lymphoid
tissues five days challenge beef calves. reduction γδ cells
in studied lymphoid tissues could also due lymphocyte trafficking to
other tissues.
