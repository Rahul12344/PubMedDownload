objective: construct recombinant adenovirus vector bearing dual-survivin
short hairpin rna (shrna).
methods: dual-survivin shrna designed synthesized respectively, both
inserted adenovirus dna. recombinant adenovirus vector confirmed via
both sequencing restriction digestion analysis, linearized and
transfected hek 293 cell line generate recombinant adenoviruses.
results: recombinant adenovirus vector constructed target
sequence obtained.
conclusion: construction recombinant adenovirus vector provides a
basis research potential gene therapy prostate cancer.
