we evaluated use cobas taqman hiv-1 highly pure system (cobas taqman) 
recently developed second-generation quantification human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) rna. linearity, sensitivity,
reproducibility, effects possibly interfering materials examined 
results compared amplicor hiv-1 monitor test version 1.5 (amplicor)
using 6 virus isolates different subtypes. excellent linearity 
obtained 1.67 x 10(2)-1.73 x 10(6) copies/ml (r2 = 0.991). sensitivity 40 
copies/ml 100% hit rate. intraexperimental cvs 27.4-50.8%, and
interexperimental cvs 29.3-81.5%. although cobas taqman showed excellent 
titer correlation amplicor (r2 = 0.960), mean titer obtained cobas
taqman 3.1 times higher amplicor (p = 0.002), 7.1 times
higher sample subtype c, suggesting discrepancies hiv-1 rna
quantification two kits. point noted amplicor 
replaced cobas taqman.
