we obtained 190 active herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase mutants 
by substituting 33 nucleotide sequence 20% degeneracy portion the
nucleotide sequence encodes putative thymidine binding site [k.m. munir,
d.c. french, d.k. dube l.a. loeb (1992) j. biol. chem., 167, 6584-6589]. in
order classify mutants respect thymidine kinase activity we
determined ability escherichia coli harboring mutants form
colonies presence varying concentrations thymidine. escherichia coli
harboring one mutant enzymes able form colonies concentration 
of thymidine lower wild type. able phosphorylate thymidine
more rapidly wild type vivo vitro. increased
thymidine kinase activity manifested (i) 42% enhanced uptake of
[methyl-3h]thymidine e. coli, (ii) 2.4 times higher rate of
[methyl-3h]thymidine incorporation acid-insoluble material (iii) a
5-fold increase kcat purified enzyme compared wild type.
herpes thymidine kinase purified mutants formed colonies at
higher thymidine concentrations wild type exhibited decrease
in kcat. kcat one mutant thymidine kinases 10(-4) 
the wild type enzyme. study demonstrates spectrum mutant enzymes
with different catalytic properties obtained selection plasmid
with random sequence substitutions done absence of
rational protein design.
