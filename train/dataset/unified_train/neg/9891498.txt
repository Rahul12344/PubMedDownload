background: malignancies oral cavity oropharynx account 31% all
diagnosed cancers india. cases, patients present tumours are
clinically stage iii/iv surgery, radiotherapy chemotherapy not
been effective. hence, urgent need alternate treatment
modalities. gene therapy recent development shown effective various
malignancies. study attempted cause bulk reduction tumour
volume using hsvtk/ganciclovir strategy, solely basis the
'bystander' effect.
methods: nude mouse xenograft tumours human head/neck cancer engrafted
with cells expressing viral thymidine kinase. treatment 8 mm
ganciclovir 14 days, treatment efficacy monitored. novel method has
been devised evaluate cell kill microscopically whole tumour.
results: 11 mice included study, 9 showed significant reduction
in total tumour volume treated versus control tumours (p = 0.015).
conclusions: bulk reduction tumour load brought without use of
viral vectors gene transfer solely bystander effect.
