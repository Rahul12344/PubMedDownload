enteric adenoviruses 40 41 (ad40 ad41) prominent cause of
gastroenteritis young children. diagnosis enteric types by
conventional means complicated fastidious growth characteristics.
enteric adenovirus growth enhanced cocultivation. typing enteric
isolates currently entails analysis extracted viral dna restriction
enzymes. restriction endonuclease fragments ad41 strain tak genome were
ordered (i) double digestion, (ii) release restriction fragments from
plasmids containing 84% ad41 genome ecori fragments a, b c, (iii)
hybridization southern blotted ad41 fragments ecori fragment containing
plasmids various segments ad2 genome, (iv) sequential reduction the
genome beginning terminal restriction fragments exonuclease iii s1 
nuclease. termini adenovirus genomes difficult clone use of
exonuclease iii useful alternative conventional restriction mapping. dna 
restriction patterns, fragment sizes restriction maps ad4 1 strain tak
with enzymes bamhi, bglii, clai, ecori, hindiii, psti, sali, smai xhoi are
presented. prototype strain restriction maps enable better understanding
of adenovirus type 41 epidemiology.
