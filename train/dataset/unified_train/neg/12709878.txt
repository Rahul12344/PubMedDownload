there need consistent definition human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv)-associated cases progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml),
especially following profound disease changes resulted use
of highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart). according criteria used
for diagnosis, pml cases either referred "histology-confirmed,"
with evidence jc virus (jcv) infection brain, "laboratory-confirmed," 
detection jcv dna cerebrospinal fluid (csf), "possible," presence
of typical clinical radiological picture, demonstration jcv
infection. disease outcome defined evidence lack evidence 
of disease activity, rather using survival variables. disease
activity based clinical (scored neurological examination),
radiological (magnetic resonance imaging), virological (jcv dna levels in
csf) indicators, assessed regularly, e.g., every 3 months evidence of
disease arrest death. furthermore, parallel assessments other
hiv-associated manifestations, including cd4+ cell counts viral load, are
required. standard patient classification would helpful clinical
management pml patients, inclusion clinical studies, also
will increase current knowledge pml evolution relation with
haart.
