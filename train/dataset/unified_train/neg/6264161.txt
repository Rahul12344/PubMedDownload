rearrangement integrated viral dna sequences mouse cells transformed by
simian virus 40.

bender ma, brockman ww.

the organization viral dna sequences several cell lines derived a
primary colony simian virus 40 (sv40)-transformed mouse cells analyzed 
examine origin various distinctive patterns sv40 sequence
arrangement present transformed cells. analysis revealed complex
arrangement viral sequences uncloned transformed cells simplified
arrangements cloned derivatives primary transformant. cell lines
studied certain sv40 sequence arrangements common, cloned lines
had lost parental arrangements acquired new arrangements. results 
indicate arrangement viral sequences sv40-transformed cells
is fixed alterations occur integration, creating a
heterogeneous population transformants. process, expression viral
genes may altered. possible causes implications genetic
instability discussed.
