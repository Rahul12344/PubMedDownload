antiretroviral treatment zidovudine (zdv) 14th week end
of pregnancy markedly reduced vertical transmission rate hiv-1 in
europe north america. shorter duration treatment reduced rate
in africa southeast asia lesser degree. southeast asia, subtype e 
the major subtype rather subtype b western countries. goals of
this study determine optimal duration zdv prophylaxis subtype 
e confirm effectiveness histologic level. fifty pregnant women 
seropositive hiv-1 subtype e given zdv prophylaxis consisting 300 mg 
administered twice daily, switching 300 mg administered every 3 hours the
onset labor delivery. twenty-seven received "short-term" zdv lasting 14 
to 35 days delivery, whereas 23 received "long-term" zdv lasting
62 92 days. effectiveness zdv prophylaxis assessed detection 
hiv-1 placenta using situ polymerase chain reaction (pcr). babies
in study tested one year age. three positive until
after one month age, one positive neonate. four neonates were
positive hiv-1 detected pcr peripheral blood, including one the
neonatal period. cases short-term prophylaxis group. decidual
glandular epithelial cells cell type placenta expressed
hiv proviral dna zdv prophylaxis. sixty-seven percent placentas the
short-term zdv group showed occasional positive cells compared 22%
in group receiving long-term zdv prophylaxis (p < 0.02). first study 
to compare effectiveness short-term long-term zdv prophylaxis with
respect presence hiv placenta. study shows longer (at
least 60 days) prophylaxis effective reducing hiv expression the
placenta associated reduced transmission neonates.
