molecular diversity within six viroid species different molecular variants,
in species infecting fruit trees first estimated single-strand
conformation polymorphism (sscp) technique direct sequencing
analysis. different variants studied three australian grapevine
viroids(agvd), four citrus dwarfing viroids (cdvd), eleven grapevine yellow
speckle viroids type-1 (gysvd-1), four hop stunt viroids (hsvd), seven peach
latent mosaic viroids (plmvd), eight pear blister canker viroids (pbcvd).
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) conditions compared optimized 
to improve sensitivity existing sscp parameters. relationships
among various sscp profiles observed variation nucleotide
sequences studied. results indicate variations some
parameters electrophoresis species allowed higher resolution and
hence detection single nucleotide variations among clones initially clustered 
into group.
