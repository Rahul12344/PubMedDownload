in study investigated lysis system lipid-containing
double-stranded dna bacteriophage pm2 infecting gram-negative marine
pseudoalteromonas species. analysed wt lysis-deficient phage-induced
changes host physiology ascribed functions two pm2 gene products
(gp) involved lysis. show bacteriophage pm2 uses novel system to
disrupt infected cell. novelty based following findings: (i) gp
k needed permeabilization cytoplasmic membrane appears to
play role typical holin. however, unique primary structure [53 aa, 1
transmembrane domain (tmd)] places new class holins. (ii) have
proposed that, unlike bacteriophages studied, pm2 relies lytic factors
of cellular origin digestion peptidoglycan. (iii) gp l (51 aa, 
tmds) needed disruption outer membrane, highly rigidified 
by divalent cations abundant marine environment. gp l no
precedent phage lytic systems studied far. however, presence of
open reading frame l-like genes genomes bacterial viruses suggests
that system might used phages unique pm2.
