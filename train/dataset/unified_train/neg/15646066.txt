it proposed host factors may affect intracellular drug
concentration leading inability drug regimens inhibit human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) replication cells. among them, two factors, whose
description main aim review, considered last 
years particular emphasis. are: i) altered uptake reduced
activation nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nrtis) target
cells, ii) efflux nrtis protease inhibitors (pis) cellular
transporter molecules. fact, several authors shown that: changes the
activity various purine pyrimidine biosynthetic enzymes may occur in
lymphocytes hiv-infected patients; hiv-infected patients prolonged
treatment nucleoside analogs, zidovudine, show significantly
decreased activity thymidine kinase compared untreated hiv-infected
persons; nrti pis substrates so-called multidrug membrane
transporters. regard latter issue, known atp-binding
cassette transporter proteins p glycoprotein, newly
discovered family multidrug resistance-associated proteins (mrp 1-9) promote
the active extracellular efflux wide variety therapeutics and
overexpression lowers intracellular concentration pis. 
very near future mechanisms, called authors "cellular
drug-resistance", might taken account, together immunological,
virological behavioral factors, explain "drug failure" and/or the
variability response hiv patients undergoing antiretroviral treatment.
