in initial attempts define molecular events responsible latent
state herpes simplex virus, situ hybridization utilized search for
virally encoded rna transcripts latently infected sensory neurons. use 
cloned probes representing entire viral genome indicated transcripts
encoded within terminal repeats present. alpha genes encoding
icp-0, icp-4, icp-27 gamma 1 gene encoding vp-5 employed, only
rna transcripts hybridizing icp-0 probe detected. latently
infected cells, icp-0--related transcripts localized principally 
nucleus; case acutely (productively) infected neurons in
neurons probed rna transcripts coding actin. northern blotting
experiments, rna 2.6 kilobases detected icp-0 probe. when
single-stranded dnas icp-0 region used probes, rna the
strand complementary encoding icp-0 messenger rna (mrna) major
species detected. rna species may play significant role maintaining the
latent infection.
