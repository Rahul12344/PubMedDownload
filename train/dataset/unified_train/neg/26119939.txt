virus (kshv) causative agent pel. pel incurable malignancy and
has extremely poor prognosis treated conventional chemotherapy.
immunomodulatory drugs (imids) lenalidomide pomalidomide food drug
administration-approved drugs treatment various ailments. imids
display pronounced antiproliferative effect majority pel cell lines
within clinically achievable concentrations, arresting cells g0/g1

although microarray examination pel cells treated lenalidomide revealed
activation interferon (ifn) signaling, blocking ifn pathway block 
the anti-pel activity imids. anti-pel effects imids involved

ikzf3. small hairpin rna-mediated knockdown myc enhanced cytotoxicity of
imids. bromodomain (brd) extra-terminal domain (bet) proteins epigenetic

bet family proteins, shown co-occupy super enhancers
associated myc. specific brd4 inhibitors developed, suppress myc 
transcriptionally. lenalidomide displayed synergistic cytotoxicity several
structurally distinct brd4 inhibitors (jq-1, ibet151 pfi-1). furthermore,
combined administration lenalidomide brd4 inhibitor jq-1 significantly
increased survival pel bearing nod-scid mice orthotopic xenograft
