muscular dystrophies (mds) caused genetic mutations 30 different
genes, many encode proteins essential integrity muscle
cell structure membrane. deficiencies cause muscle vulnerable to
mechanical biochemical damages, leading membrane leakage, dystrophic
pathology, eventual loss muscle cells. recent studies report mg53, 
muscle-specific trim-family protein, plays essential role sarcolemmal
membrane repair. here, show systemic delivery muscle-specific
overexpression human mg53 gene recombinant adeno-associated virus (aav)
vectors enhanced membrane repair, ameliorated pathology, improved muscle 
heart functions δ-sarcoglycan (δ-sg)-deficient to-2 hamsters, animal model 
of md congestive heart failure. addition, mg53 overexpression increased
dysferlin level facilitated trafficking muscle membrane through
participation caveolin-3. mg53 also protected muscle cells activating cell 
survival kinases, akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (erk1/2),
and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (gsk-3β) inhibiting proapoptotic protein bax.
our results suggest enhancing muscle membrane repair machinery could 
a novel therapeutic approach md cardiomyopathy, demonstrated in
the limb girdle md (lgmd) 2f model.
