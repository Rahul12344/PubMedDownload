recombinant adeno-associated virus (aav) represents efficient system for
neuronal transduction. however, potential drawback aav restricted
packaging capacity approximately 5 kb. bypass limitation, number 
dual- triple-vector strategies divide transgene(s) two three
aavs. success approaches relies directly efficient cotransduction
of component aavs. although proof concept stratagems been
demonstrated, underlying cotransduction rate analyzed
quantitatively. study, cotransduction efficiencies retina and
hippocampus investigated, using two reporter aavs expressing either a
green (gfp) red (dsr) fluorescent protein. transduction efficiencies were
monitored via microscopy, flow cytometry, quantitative pcr. viral
transduction 1.5Ã—10(9) viral particles reporter aavs,
approximately one-third retinal cells expressed one transgenes 
levels detectable native fluorescence. notably, majority remaining 
retinal cells also transduced expressed reporters lower levels,
which detectable immunolabeling. flow cytometric analysis
demonstrated cotransduction rates 55% two reporter aavs in
retinal cells. modifying ratio two coadministered aavs resulted in
altered mrna expression levels two reporter genes cotransduced cell
populations. study suggests codelivery aav efficient means of
expanding therapeutic application aav neurons.
