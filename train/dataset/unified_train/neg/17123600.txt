calcium phosphate (cap) based approaches remain attractive option for
delivering plasmid dna (pdna) cultured cells. however, despite appeal,
current synthesis methodologies typically yield lower, less consistent
transfection efficiencies compared viral approaches. therefore, report
here novel method consistently synthesize efficient, nano-sized,
mono-dispersed cap-pdna particles; accomplished optimizing the
stoichiometry (ca/p ratio) cap particles well mode 
calcium phosphate precursor solutions mixed. results indicate that
calcium phosphate precursors mixed controlled regulated manner 
reproducibly result nano-sized particles consistently yield higher
transfection efficiencies compared particles synthesized via manual
mixing (a two-fold increase observed). also, maximum transfection
efficiencies hela mc3t3-e1 cells lines obtained ca/p
ratio 100 300 used. particles synthesized within optimum
ca/p ratio range 25 50 nm. data suggests these
maximized transfection efficiencies obtained particles not
only effectively condensed (70% efficient) also efficiently bound (90%
efficient) pdna. addition, x-ray diffraction fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy analyses confirmed synthesized cap
structures exhibited hydroxyapatite phase.
