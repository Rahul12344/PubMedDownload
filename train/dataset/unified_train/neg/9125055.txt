the 5' terminal region genomic rna grapevine virus (gva), tentative
member trichovirus genus, encompassing 5466 nucleotides, sequenced.
evidence obtained rna capped. two putative open reading frames
(orf) identified: orf 1 codes 194 kda polypeptide conserved 
motifs replication-related proteins positive-strand rna viruses, orf 2 
that encodes 19 kda polypeptide significant homology protein
sequences databases. polypeptide, however, showed 44% similarity with
the product expressed comparable orf present grapevine virus b (gvb). gva
genome size structural organization gvb. also 
the size genome apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (aclsv), type 
species trichovirus genus, differed substantially number (5
versus 3), size, order genes. differences existed also degree of
sequence homology polymerases, cluster together in
phylogenetic trees. definitive (aclsv, pvt) tentative (gva, gvb) trichovirus 
species differ molecularly, biologically epidemiologically extent 
warrants taxonomic revision genus.
