tert-azido amino substituted penciclovir analogs, 1-3 synthesized the
purpose improving efficacy bioavailability penciclovir and
searching novel antiviral agents. among several methods attempted insert
an azido group alpha,beta-unsaturated ester 6, bronsted
acid-catalysed 1,4-conjugate addition conditions (nan3, 75% acetic acid, 80
degrees c) gave desired tert-azido product 7. synthesized final
penciclovir analogs 1-3 evaluated vitro several viruses as
hiv-1, hsv-1 2, poliovirus, vzv, vsv. compound 2 showed weak
antiviral activity hsv-1 without cytotoxicity. although synthesized
compounds exhibit excellent antiviral activity, successful method 
used introducing tert-azido group expected generally utilized for
the synthesis nucleoside analogs tert-azido substituent.
