hepatitis derived hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection endemic throughout
the world, particularly prevalent asia africa. areas,
demographic studies show strong coincidence hbv infection (assayed by
hbv antigenic markers) incidence primary liver cancer. these
grounds, causal link hbv infection primary hepatocellular cancer
has proposed. recently, human hepatoma cell line (plc/prf/5; alexander
cells) shown produce hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag). show
here alexander cell line contains least six (four complete two
partial) hepatitis b viral genomes integrated high molecular weight host
dna. analysis using specific probes fragments hbv genome suggests
that integration virus cases occurs nicked cohesive end
region virus. expression viral sequences using northern blots
demonstrates presence rna transcripts specific surface antigen
sequences hbv dna absence detectable transcripts corresponding to
the hepatitis b core antigen.
