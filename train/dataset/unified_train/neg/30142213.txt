protein production, genomic rna replication, virion assembly infection
by picornaviruses like human rhinovirus poliovirus take place the
cytoplasm infected human cells, making quintessential cytoplasmic
pathogens. however, growing body evidence suggests picornavirus
replication promoted number host proteins localized normally within
the host cell nucleus. systematically identify nuclear proteins, we
focused appear re-equilibrate nucleus cytoplasm 
during infection hela cells human rhinovirus via quantitative protein
mass spectrometry. analysis revealed highly selective re-equilibration of
proteins known mrna splicing transport-related functions nuclear
proteins functional classes. multifunctional splicing factor
proline glutamine rich (sfpq) identified one protein. found
that sfpq targeted proteolysis within nucleus viral proteinase
3cd/3c, fragment sfpq shown migrate cytoplasm at
mid-to-late times infection. cells knocked sfpq expression showed
significantly reduced rhinovirus titers, viral protein production, viral rna 
accumulation, consistent sfpq pro-viral factor. sfpq fragment
that moved cytoplasm able bind rhinovirus rna either directly 
indirectly. propose truncated form sfpq promotes viral rna
stability replication, virion morphogenesis. broadly, findings
reveal dramatic changes protein compartmentalization human rhinovirus
infection, allowing virus systematically hijack functions proteins 
not normally found cytoplasmic site replication.
