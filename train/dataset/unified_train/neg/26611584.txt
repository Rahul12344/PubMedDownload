more one hundred naturally occurring variants adeno-associated virus
(aav) identified, library expanded an
array techniques modification viral capsid. aav capsid variants
possess unique antigenic profiles demonstrate distinct cellular tropisms
driven differences receptor binding. aav capsids chemically modified
to alter tropism, produced hybrid vectors combine properties
of multiple serotypes, carry peptide insertions introduce novel
receptor-binding activity. furthermore, directed evolution shuffled genome
libraries identify engineered variants unique properties, rational
modification viral capsid alter tropism, reduce blockage by
neutralizing antibodies, enhance transduction efficiency. large number of
aav variants engineered capsids provides varied toolkit gene delivery
to cns retina, specialized vectors available many applications, 
but selecting capsid variant array available vectors be
difficult. chapter describes unique properties range aav
variants engineered capsids, provides guide selecting the
appropriate vector specific applications cns retina.
