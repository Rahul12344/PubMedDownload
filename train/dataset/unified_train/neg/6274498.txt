modification poliovirus capsid ultraviolet light.

de sena j, jarvis dl.

ultraviolet (uv) irradiation type poliovirus resulted modified (m)
particle lost infectivity, lacked ability adsorb hela cells,
lacked vp4, reduced value. additional irradiation resulted loss
of vp2, reduction value, permeability capsid rnase,
this particle (c) well contain genome. acid ph (5.5-65) and
sulfhydryl-reducing substances (dithiothreitol. reduced glutathione, and
l-cysteine) inhibited uv-induced modification capsid. uv irradiation at
alkaline ph (7.5-8.5) resulted extensive modification capsid 
irradiation neutral ph. ionic compounds found inhibit modifying
reaction.
