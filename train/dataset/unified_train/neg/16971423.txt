foot-and-mouth disease virus (fmdv) thought evolve largely genetic 
drift driven inherently error-prone nature rna polymerase. there
is, however, increasing evidence recombination important mechanism 
the evolution related picornoviruses. here, use an
extensive set recombination detection methods identify 86 unique potential 
recombination events among 125 publicly available fmdv complete genome sequences.
the large number events detected members different serotypes
suggests horizontal flow sequences among serotypes relatively
common incur severe fitness costs. interestingly, distribution
of recombination breakpoints found largely nonrandom. whereas are
clear breakpoint cold spots within structural genes, two statistically
significant hot spots precisely separate nonstructural genes. very
similar breakpoint distributions found picornovirus species the
genera enterovirus teschovirus. results suggest genome regions
encoding structural proteins fmdv picornaviruses are
functionally interchangeable modules, supporting recent proposals the
structural nonstructural coding regions picornaviruses evolving
largely independently one another.
