porcine sapoviruses (savs) genetically diverse widely distributed in
pig-producing countries. eight genogroups porcine sav identified,
and genogroup iii predominant type. eight genogroups of
porcine sav circulating united states. present study, report
detection porcine savs pigs different ages clinical diarrhoea using
next-generation sequencing genetic characterization. seven cases have
porcine sav giii strains detected one pooled case found porcine
sav gvi strain ia27912-b-2018. sequence analysis showed seven giii isolates 
were genetically divergent formed four different lineages trees of
complete genome, rdrp, vp1 vp2. addition, seven giii isolates had
three different deletion/insertion patterns identified variable region
close 3' end vp2. gvi strain ia27912-b-2018 closely related 
strains previously detected united states japan. 3-nt deletion in
vp1 region gvi ia27912-b-2018 identified. study showed that
genetically divergent savs different genogroups co-circulating pigs 
the united states. future studies comparing virulence different
genogroups pigs needed better understand virus determine if
surveillance vaccine development needed monitor control porcine
savs.
