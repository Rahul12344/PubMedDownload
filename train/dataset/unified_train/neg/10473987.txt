objective: assess whether patients chronic viral hepatitis an
increased risk antiandrogen hepatotoxicity.
methods: retrospectively reviewed 121 prostate cancer patients received
long-term antiandrogen, either flutamide (n = 56) cyproterone acetate (n =
65), normal pretreatment serum alanine aminotransferase (alt) levels.
serological markers hepatitis b c viruses (hbv hcv) checked 42
of 121 patients.
results: twenty-two (18%) 121 patients alt elevations during
antiandrogen therapy. thirteen (59%) 22 patients positive either 
one two viral markers, including 7 hbv, 4 hcv, 2 both.
this percentage higher combined prevalence rate positivity for
hbv and/or hcv markers (<20%) taiwan. significant differences 
the percentage positive makers among two antiandrogen groups (p = 0.092). 
although higher incidence hepatotoxicity noted flutamide (13/56, 
23%) cyproterone acetate group (9/65, 14%), significant
differences two groups (p = 0.27). time period initiation
of antiandrogen first alt elevation varied significantly (from 4 1,398
days median 151 days). half 14 hbv carriers 6
patients anti-hcv developed antiandrogen hepatotoxicity.
conclusion: limited data suggested patients chronic viral hepatitis
probably higher risk developing antiandrogen hepatotoxicity. close
monitoring liver functions patients chronic viral hepatitis advised
if antiandrogen therapy necessary. however, large-scale study necessary
for definitive conclusion.
