insulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cell lines represent promising approach for
treatment insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. cell lines provide 
abundant reproducible source beta-cell material transplantation. a
number highly differentiated beta-cell lines developed using
transgenic mice. cells produce insulin amounts comparable normal
pancreatic islets release response physiological insulin
secretagogues. laboratory employed reversible transformation approach
to tightly regulate cell replication beta-cell lines, culture
and vivo. beta-cell lines modulated gene transfer improve their
function survival. utilized adenovirus genes, downregulate
antigen presentation increase cell resistance cytokines, facilitate
transplantation mouse beta cells across allogeneic barriers. approaches 
could applied development human beta-cell lines genetic
engineering isolated human islets.
