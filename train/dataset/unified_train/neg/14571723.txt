background/aims: hepatitis c virus major causative agent chronic liver
disease hepatocellular carcinoma considered hepatotropic
virus. remains controversial whether hepatitis c virus exists peripheral
blood mononuclear cells replicates there. order resolve issue, 
performed nested rt-pcr (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) and
rt-pcr situ hybridization peripheral blood mononuclear cells patients
with chronic hepatitis c.
methodology: collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells patients with
chronic hepatitis c, extracted total rna samples, performed nested
rt-pcr detect hepatitis c virus rna peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
lysates. also fixed peripheral blood mononuclear cells patients 4%
paraformaldehyde performed rt-pcr situ hybridization a
digoxigenin-labeled rna probe detect hepatitis c virus rna cells.
results: using methods, detected positive- negative-stranded
hepatitis c virus rna peripheral blood mononuclear cells hepatitis c
patients. determine cell population peripheral blood mononuclear
cells hepatitis c virus present, performed pcr situ hybridization 
incubation fluorescent latex microbeads could phagocytozed by
monocytes. obtained positive signals replicative hepatitis c virus
genome lymphocytes also monocytes.
conclusions: rt-pcr situ hybridization nonradioactive probe found
to useful situ detection hepatitis c virus rna. findings suggest
that peripheral blood mononuclear cells may extrahepatic replication sites for
hepatitis c virus.
