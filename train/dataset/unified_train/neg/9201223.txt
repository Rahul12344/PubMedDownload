phage phi sfi21, temperate streptococcus thermophilus phage our
phage collection, showed extensive dna homology virulent phages lytic
group i. southern blot hybridizations demonstrated phi sfi21-specific
dna clustered approximately 6.6-kb-long region, putative lysogeny
module. sequence analysis database research identified integrase within
this module; orf 203 homology anonymous orf 258 temperate
lactococcal phage bk5-t; orf 127 orf 122 weak homology n- and
c-terminal parts, respectively, cl-like repressor lactococcal phages 
tuc2009 bk5-t; orf 75 homology repressor protein lambdoid
phage 434 anti-repressor ant homology phage p1. molecular
arrangement predicted orfs phage phi sfi21 similar 
the lactococcal phage bk5-t. transition phi sfi21-specific dna dna 
shared virulent phages abrupt flanked one side notable dna
repeats. sequence analysis identified holin protein left lysogeny
module. site-specific deletion 2.4 kb, reproducibly transformed phi
sfi21 lytic phage, localized lysogeny module. flanked at
both sides conspicuous dna repeats. one repeat region reflected dna around
the attp site, reflected putative genetic switch region
between repressor anti-repressor genes. s. thermophilus host sfi1 transformed
with plasmid containing int orf 203 showed resistance superinfection 
heterologous phages, homologous phi sfi21. part int gene
could deleted without loss activity, deletion orf 203
resulted loss phage resistance. speculate possibility a
bipartite immunity system control lysogeny phi sfi21.
