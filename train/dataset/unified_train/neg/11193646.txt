cattle immunotolerant persistently infected (pi) bovine viral
diarrhea (bvd) virus (bvdv) constitute mechanism bvdv persists in
and spreads among cattle herds. detection elimination pi cattle are
necessary control bvd. serum excellent specimen bvd pi testing
because high survivability bvdv serum ease collection, storage,
and handling. currently, microtiter virus isolation (vi) employing serum and
sandwich elisas (s-elisa) tissues leukocytes used bvdv pi
screening. paper evaluates new s-elisa kit uses serum the
diagnostic sample. cattle sera (n = 408) tested using vi s-elisa.
the vi detected 172 bvdv-positive sera. these, 18 confirmed pi cattle.
the s-elisa positive pi samples. considering pi animals, 
using vi gold standard, relative sensitivity s-elisa 100%. 
overall relative sensitivity 93.6% agreement quotient (kappa) was
0.94. relative specificity kit, based 236 vi-negative sera, was
100%. data indicate new kit adequate detection bvdv
pi cattle.
