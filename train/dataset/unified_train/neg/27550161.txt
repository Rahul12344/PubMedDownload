a viral gene, cpbv-cst1, identified polydnavirus cotesia plutellae
bracovirus (cpbv). protein product significantly toxic lepidopteran
insects. study generated transgenic tobacco plant expressing cpbv-cst1
expression transgene cpbv-cst1 confirmed t1 generation (second
generation transgenesis) mrna protein levels. young larvae of
spodoptera exigua (hübner) suffered high mortalities feeding transgenic 
tobacco. 10 t1 transgenic tobacco plants significant variation in
speed-to-kill. order explore insect resistance transgenic 
tobaccos, bioassays performed assessing antixenosis antibiosis. s.
exigua larvae significantly avoided t1 plants choice test. larvae fed with
t1 plant exhibited significant decrease protease activity midgut due to
consuming cpbv-cst1 protein produced transgenic plant. furthermore, the
transgenic tobacco exhibited similar insect resistance tobacco-infesting
insects, including leaf-feeding insect, helicoverpa assulta, sap-feeding 
insect, myzus persicae results demonstrate viral cystatin gene can
be used develop insect-resistant transgenic plant, suggesting prospective
possibility expanding current transgenic approach high-valued crops.
