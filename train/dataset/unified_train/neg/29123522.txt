existing models ebola virus disease (evd) suggest antigen-presenting cells are
initial targets zaire ebolavirus (zebov). vitro studies shown that
zebov infection monocytes macrophages results production of
inflammatory mediators, may cause lymphocyte apoptosis. however, these
findings corroborated vivo studies. study, report 
the first longitudinal analysis transcriptional changes purified monocytes,
t-cells, b-cells isolated cynomolgus macaques following infection with
zebov-makona. data reveal monocytes one major immune cell subsets
that supports zebov replication vivo. addition, report marked increase
in transcription genes involved inflammation, coagulation, vascular
disease within monocytes, suggesting monocytes contribute evd
manifestations. further, genes important antigen presentation regulation 
of immunity downregulated, potentially subverting development adaptive
immunity. contrast, lymphocytes, support zebov replication,
showed transcriptional changes limited small number interferon-stimulated
genes (isgs) failure upregulate genes associated antiviral
effector immune response. collectively, data suggest zebov-infected
monocytes play significant role zebov-makona pathogenesis strategies 
suppress virus replication modify innate responses infection cells
should priority therapeutic intervention.
