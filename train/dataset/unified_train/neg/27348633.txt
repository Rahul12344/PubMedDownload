the iifn1a (intracellular ifn-a1), one ifn-a1 variants, shown 
to functional intracellularly act novel defense infectious
hematopoietic necrosis virus (ihnv). determine antiviral properties, a
recombinant iifn1a generated escherichia coli. antiviral activity
against ihnv 1.69×10(7)u/mg chse-214 cells. additionally, iifn1a was
capable inducing comparable levels irf-1, irf-2, ifn-i, ifn-γ mx
transcription head kidney, spleen liver tissues early time point
(6h), followed rapid decline 24h induction. recombinant
protein also elicited protection ihnv vivo. 6 24h after
induction 100% protection virus, however, 48 72h the
protection decreased 57 40%, respectively. vivo protection kinetics
correlated kinetics gene expression. results study
provide details antiviral state induced iifn1a vivo the
first time. additionally, information facilitate development of
this recombinant protein potential anti-viral treatment and/or adjuvant.
