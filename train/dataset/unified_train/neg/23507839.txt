this review focuses significance deregulation epigenetic mechanisms 
by hepatitis b virus (hbv) x protein hepatocarcinogenesis hbv
replication. epigenetic mechanisms, dna methylation, specific histone
modifications, e.g., trimethylation h3 lysine-27 lysine-4, maintain
'cellular memory' silencing expression lineage-inducing factors stem
cells conversely, pluripotency factors differentiated cells. x
protein reported induce expression dna methyltransferases (dnmts),
likely promoting epigenetic changes hepatocarcinogenesis. furthermore, 
cellular animal models x-mediated oncogenic transformation, protein levels
of chromatin modifying proteins suz12 znf198 down-regulated. suz12 is
essential polycomb repressive complex 2 (prc2) mediating repressive
trimethylation h3 lysine-27 (h3k27me3). znf198, stabilizes the
lsd1-corest-hdac complex removes, via lysine demethylase1 (lsd1), the
activating trimethylation h3 lysine-4 (h3k4me3). down-regulation suz12
also occurs liver tumors woodchucks chronically infected woodchuck
hepatitis virus, animal model recapitulating hbv-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis
in humans. significantly, subgroups hbv-induced liver cancer re-express
hepatoblast fetal markers, imprinted genes, suggesting hepatocyte
reprogramming oncogenic transformation. lastly, down-regulation suz12
and znf198 enhances hbv replication. collectively, observations suggest
deregulation epigenetic mechanisms hbv x protein influences viral 
cycle host cell.
