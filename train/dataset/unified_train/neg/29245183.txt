objective: immune dysfunction important component disease process
underlying systemic sclerosis (ssc), mechanisms contributing altered
immune cell function ssc remain poorly defined. study undertaken to
measure expression function coinhibitory receptors (co-irs)
programmed cell death 1 (pd-1), cell immunoglobulin itim domain (tigit), 
cell immunoglobulin mucin domain 3 (tim-3), lymphocyte activation gene 3 
(lag-3) lymphocyte subsets peripheral blood patients ssc.
methods: co-ir expression levels subsets immune cells analyzed using a
16-color flow cytometry panel. functional role co-irs determined by
measuring cytokine production vitro stimulation ssc healthy
control peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) presence of
co-ir-blocking antibodies. supernatants cultures stimulated pbmcs were
added ssc fibroblasts, impact fibroblast gene expression was
measured. mathematical modeling used reveal differences co-ir
functions ssc patients healthy controls.
results: levels co-irs pd-1 tigit increased, was
coexpressed, distinct cell subsets ssc patients compared healthy
controls. levels tim-3 increased ssc natural killer cells. pd-1,
tigit, tim-3 antibody blockade revealed patient-specific roles of
these co-irs modulating activation-induced cell cytokine production. in
contrast healthy subjects, blockade tigit tim-3, pd-1, failed
to reverse inhibited cytokine production ssc patients, indicating that
enhanced cell exhaustion present ssc. finally, cytokines secreted in
anti-tim-3-treated pbmc cultures distinctly changed gene expression profile
in ssc fibroblasts.
conclusion: altered expression regulatory capacity co-irs ssc
lymphocytes may contribute disease pathophysiology modulating the
cytokine-mediated cross-talk immune cells fibroblasts sites of
inflammation and/or fibrosis.
