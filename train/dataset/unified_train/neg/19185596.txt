a purified recombinant spike (s) protein studied effect on
stimulating human peripheral blood monocyte macrophages (pbmc). examined
inflammatory gene mrna abundances found protein-treated pbmc using gene
arrays. identified differential mrna abundances genes functional
properties associated antiviral (cxcl10) inflammatory (il-6 il-8)
responses. confirmed cytokine mrna increases real-time quantitative(q)
rt-pcr elisa. analyzed sensitivity specificity the
prominent il-8 response. real-time qrt-pcr, protein shown stimulate
il-8 mrna accumulation dose dependent manner treatment e protein 
did not. also, titration protein-specific production secretion il-8
by elisa showed dose 5.6nm produced significant increase in
il-8 (p=0.003) compared mock-treated controls. increase il-8 stimulated
by concentration 5.6nm comparable concentrations seen s
protein binding ace2 neutralizing monoclonal antibody suggesting a
physiological relevance. nf-kappab inhibitor, tpck (n-tosyl-l-phenylalanine
chloromethyl ketone) could suppress il-8 production secretion response 
s protein pbmc thp-1 cells hcov-229e virus-infected pbmc.
activation translocation nf-kappab shown occur rapidly following
exposure pbmc thp-1 cells protein using highly sensitive assay for
active nuclear nf-kappab p65 transcription factor. results suggested 
that released secreted protein could activate blood monocytes through
recognition toll-like receptor (tlr)2 ligand.
