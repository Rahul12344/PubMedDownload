the etiology subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (sat) obscure, although 
is postulated associated viral infections genetic factors. 
present study, possibility infectious etiology prospectively
studied 27 consecutive patients sat. special emphasis put role
of enteroviruses. coupled sera (interval one month) taken patients 
and single sera 29 control subjects virus antibody determinations. stool
samples collected virus isolation fine-needle aspiration samples
from thyroid gland detection enterovirus rna using rt-pcr taken
from sat patients. enteroviral antibodies tested using three different
methods: indirect eia, heavy chain capture ria, standard complement fixation 
(cf) test. antibodies common viral pathogens, including
enteroviruses, screened using cf test mycoplasma
pneumoniae chlamydia pneumoniae using eia microimmunofluorescence
techniques, respectively. common respiratory viruses also screened from
nasopharyngeal suction samples antigen detection eia. based serological
findings, one patient acute cytomegalovirus infection. patients
were negative antibody tests, virus isolation, rt-pcr, antigen detection. 
enterovirus rna detected pcr thyroid tissue the
fine-needle aspiration samples. evidence recent enteroviral
infections sat patients. results suggest sat usually
associated acute infections. evidence obtained support the
proposed role enteroviruses important etiologic agent sat.
