the endogenous production enzymes zymogens provides means control
catalytic activities. here, describe heterologous production of
ribonuclease 1 (rnase 1), prevalent secretory ribonuclease in
humans, zymogen. folded rnase 1, n c termini flank enzymic
active site. using intein-mediated cis-splicing, created circular proteins 
in access active site rnase 1 obstructed amino-acid
sequence recognized hiv-1 protease. installing sequence that
does perturb rnase 1 fold led modest inactivation. contrast,
the ancillary truncation residues terminus led substantial
decrease catalytic activity zymogen maintenance of
thermostability. optimized zymogens, activation hiv-1 protease led to
a > 104 -fold increase ribonucleolytic activity rate comparable that
for cleavage endogenous viral substrates. molecular modeling indicated
that zymogens inactivated conformational distortion addition to
substrate occlusion. protease levels elevated many disease states 
and ribonucleolytic activity cytotoxic, rnase 1 zymogens potential as
generalizable prodrugs.
