the development anti-human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) microbicides for
either topical ex vivo use considerable interest, mainly due the
difficulties creating vaccine would active multiple clades
of hiv. cyanovirin-n (cv-n), 11-kda protein cyanobacterium
(blue-green algae) nostoc ellipsosporum potent virucidal activity, was
identified search antiviral agents. binding cv-n the
heavily glycosylated hiv envelope protein gp120 carbohydrate-dependent. since 
previous cv-n-dimannose structures could fully explain cv-n-oligomannose
binding, determined crystal structures recombinant cv-n complexed to
man-9 synthetic hexamannoside, 2.5- 2.4-a resolution, respectively. 
cv-n three-dimensional domain-swapped dimer crystal structures with
two primary sites near hinge region two secondary sites opposite
ends dimer. binding interface constituted three stacked
alpha1-->2-linked mannose rings man-9 two stacked mannose rings for
hexamannoside rest saccharide molecules pointing solution.
these structures show unequivocally binding geometry high mannose sugars
to cv-n, permitting better understanding carbohydrate binding this
potential new lead design drugs aids.
