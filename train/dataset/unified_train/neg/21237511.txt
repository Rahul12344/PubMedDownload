murine noroviruses (mnv) currently prevalent viruses infecting mouse
research colonies. concurrent infection research mice viruses can
dramatically alter experimental outcome research models, not
others. report, investigated effect mnv1 mnv4 murine
model intestinal inflammation fibrosis induced salmonella typhimurium
infection c57bl/6 mice. subsequent co-infection mice mnv1 or
mnv4 lead major changes histopathology, inflammatory response, 
or fibrotic response. thus, mnv substantially alter all
gastrointestinal research models, highlighting importance investigating
potential alterations research outcome mnv individual basis. we
hypothesize particularly important cases research models 
use immunocompromised mice, could sensitive mnv
infection-induced changes.
