the family mimiviridae contains uncommonly large viruses, many were
isolated using free-living amoeba host. although genomes 
other mimivirids infect marine heterokont haptophyte protists now
been sequenced, yet genomic investigation mimivirid that
infects member viridiplantae lineage (green algae land plants). here
we characterize 668-kilobase complete genome tetv-1, mimivirid that
infects cosmopolitan green alga tetraselmis (chlorodendrophyceae). the
analysis revealed genes previously seen viruses, mannitol
metabolism enzyme mannitol 1-phosphate dehydrogenase, saccharide degradation 
enzyme alpha-galactosidase, key fermentation genes pyruvate formate-lyase
and pyruvate formate-lyase activating enzyme. tetv genome largest
sequenced date virus infects photosynthetic organism, its
genes reveal unprecedented mechanisms viruses manipulate host's
metabolism.
