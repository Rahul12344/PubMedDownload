we previously described human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) envelope
mutant introduces disulfide bridge gp120 surface proteins 
gp41 transmembrane proteins (j. m. binley, r. w. sanders, b. clas, n. schuelke,
a. master, y. guo, f. kajumo, d. j. anselma, p. j. maddon, w. c. olson, j. p.
moore, j. virol. 74:627-643, 2000). produced pseudovirions bearing the
mutant envelope reporter gene examine mutant's infectious
properties. pseudovirions attach cells expressing cd4 coreceptor but
infect triggered reducing agent, implying gp120-gp41
dissociation necessary infection. studies suggested virus
entry arrested cd4 coreceptor engagement. measuring the
activities various entry inhibitors arrested intermediate, we
found gp120-targeting inhibitors typically act prior virus attachment,
whereas gp41 inhibitors able act postattachment. unexpectedly, a
significant fraction antibodies hiv-1-positive sera neutralized virus
postattachment, suggesting downstream fusion events structures figure
prominently host immune response. overall, disulfide-shackled virus
is unique tool potential utility vaccine design, drug discovery, and
elucidation hiv-1 entry process.
