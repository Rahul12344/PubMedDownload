innate antiviral immunity, particularly mucosal surfaces, critical role 
in early control viral infections. type interferons (ifns) and
interleukin-15 (il-15) essential components innate antiviral immunity. 
has shown toll-like receptor (tlr) ligand-induced innate antiviral
immunity requires ifn-α/β -λ receptor signaling. however, known 
il-15 role tlr ligand-mediated antiviral responses. here, report that
ligands tlr-3 tlr-9 cannot confer protection genital herpes
simplex virus-2 (hsv-2) absence il-15 vivo. interestingly, wild-type
mice depleted natural killer (nk) cells treated tlr ligands are
protected upon hsv-2 challenge, suggesting critical role il-15 is
independent nk cell-mediated activity. examine cytokine response the
absence il-15, investigated tlr ligand-induced ifn-β -λ production in
the vaginal washes, found impairment il-15(-/-) mice. finally, we
report impairment expression ifn-stimulated genes il-15(-/-) 
mice. collectively, data suggest tlr ligands induce ifn-mediated
response vaginal tract wild-type il-15(-/-) mice, its
induction insufficient providing protection hsv-2 absence
of il-15.
