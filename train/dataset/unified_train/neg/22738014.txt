treatment hiv infection conventional antiretroviral therapy (art) a
lifelong challenge significant long-term risks adverse events and
treatment failure-induced hiv resistance major concerns. one potential
alternative standard treatment use viral decay accelerators,
antiviral agents theoretically drive rate viral mutation beyond
the compensatory capacity virus, thereby inducing viral extinction. one
such drug, kp-1461, tested population hiv-infected persons not
receiving art assess safety, tolerability, efficacy strategy in
vivo. 24 highly treatment-experienced hiv-infected patients received at
least one dose kp-1461, 13 completed planned 4 months monotherapy. 
drug generally well tolerated; significantly affect either hiv
viral load cd4 lymphocyte count period dosing. pharmacokinetic
sampling suggested adequate drug exposure achieved. new
mutations induced kp-1461 changed viral susceptibility standard
antiretroviral agents. study completed, analysis 7
million base pairs hiv samples study patients controls demonstrated
changes pattern viral mutations differed significantly what
would encountered naturally. identified alterations consistent with
an effect resulting kp-1461's proposed mechanism action. findings
suggest novel antiretroviral approach illustrated study should
be investigated, particularly given relatively good tolerability 
the demonstrated excellent safety limited cohort study.
