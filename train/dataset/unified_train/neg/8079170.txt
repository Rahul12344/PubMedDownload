the transcription factor pu.1 hematopoietic-specific member ets
family. mice carrying mutation pu.1 locus generated gene
targeting. homozygous mutant embryos died late gestational stage. mutant
embryos produced normal numbers megakaryocytes erythroid progenitors, 
some showed impairment erythroblast maturation. invariant consequence of
the mutation multilineage defect generation progenitors b and
t lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes. thus, developmental programs of
lymphoid myeloid lineages require common genetic function likely acting 
the level multipotential progenitor.
