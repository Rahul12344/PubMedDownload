a detailed sequence analysis herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) hsv-2
dna encoding alkaline exonuclease mrna clusters completed. three
partially colinear mrnas (2.3, 1.9, 0.9 kilobases) completely encoded
within dna sequence presented. putative promoter regions the
transcripts inserted upstream plasmid-borne chloramphenicol acetyl
transferase (cat) gene assayed ability induce transcription of
the cat gene upon low multiplicity infection hsv transient expression 
assays. conclude expression three transcripts appear be
controlled individual promoters. 2.3-kilobase mrna contains open
translational reading frame sufficient encode 626 amino acids hsv-1
alkaline exonuclease enzyme; value 620 amino acids hsv-2. a
comparison predicted amino acid sequences hsv-1 hsv-2 alkaline 
exonuclease enzymes revealed significant amino acid differences n-terminal
portions two proteins; however, computer analyses suggest the
three-dimensional structures hsv-1 hsv-2 nuclease enzymes very
similar. 0.9-kilobase mrna contains open reading frame shares a
small amount out-of-phase overlap c-terminal portion alkaline 
nuclease open reading frame. open reading frame capacity encode a
96-amino-acid polypeptide (10,500 daltons).
