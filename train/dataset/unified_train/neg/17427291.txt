elevated mistranslation induces mutator response termed translational
stress-induced mutagenesis (tsm) mediated unidentified modification
of dna polymerase iii. address two questions: (i) tsm result from
direct polymerase corruption, indirect pathway triggered increased 
protein turnover? (ii) homologous recombination functions required for
the expression tsm certain conditions, others? show that
replication bacteriophage t4 cells expressing muta allele the
glyvtrna gene (asp-gly mistranslation), leads increased mutagenesis, 
to altered mutational specificity, results strongly support
mistranslational corruption dna polymerase. also show expression of
muta, confers reca-dependent mutator phenotype, leads increased
lambdoid prophage induction (selectable vivo expression technology assay),
suggesting replication fork collapse occurs frequently muta cells
relative control cells. increase prophage induction seen in
cells expressing alavglu trna (glu-->ala mistranslation), mutator
phenotype reca-independent. propose replication fork collapse
accompanies episodic hypermutagenic replication cycles muta cells, requiring
homologous recombination functions fork recovery, therefore, mutation
recovery. findings highlight hitherto under-appreciated links among
translation, replication recombination, suggest translational
fidelity, affected genetic environmental signals, key
modulator replication fidelity.
