weeks following introduction cells. ebna-1-positive 143b h1299 
cells, plasmids containing region dyad symmetry (ds) orip
replicated lost rapidly cells orip plasmids,
demonstrating family repeats (fr) orip acts cis stimulate
replication cells. unexpectedly, found ds plasmid was
established efficiently 293/ebna-1 cells, lost rate 8% per 
cell generation 24 days posttransfection. however, plasmids containing the
fr addition ds orip replicated lost rate of
approximately 30% per cell generation 293/ebna-1 cells, indicating fr
inhibits orip's establishment cell line. fr's enhancement of
transcription promoter cis fr's ability inhibit replication fork

dna looping fr ds neither stimulates inhibits replication.

sequences, however, overcome inhibitory activity fr, thereby
allowing efficient establishment orip derivative 293/ebna-1 cells.
