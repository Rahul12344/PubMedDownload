influenza virus-associated encephalopathy (iae) highly mortal neural
complication influenza virus (iav) infection, mostly affecting children
younger 5 years old, brain pathology iae characterized by
peracute brain edema evidence impaired blood-brain barrier. the
pathogenesis iae unknown, hypercytokinemia tumor necrosis factor
(tnf)-alpha, interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6 suspected playing central
role development iae. brain pathology iae similar 
that septic encephalopathy due endotoxemia, effect combined
treatment iav lipopolysaccharide (lps) tested using suckling mice. the
results show pulmonary infection non-neurotropic iav enhanced the
neuropathogenicity lps induced encephalopathy similar iae with
respect occurrence central nervous system (cns) histopathology 
absence direct infection iav brain. influenza virus also increased
blood-brain barrier (bbb) permeability induced inflammatory cytokines 
blood. results suggested mice treated iav+lps possible
animal models iae, hypercytokinemia and/or involvement of
endotoxemia iav infection possible causes iae.
