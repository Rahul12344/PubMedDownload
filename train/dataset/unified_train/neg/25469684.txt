objective: telomere length marker biological aging linked
to cardiovascular disease risk. black south african population witnessing 
a tremendous increase prevalence cardiovascular disease, part 
might explained urbanization. compared telomere length between
black south africans white south africans examined biological and
psychosocial variables played role ethnic difference telomere length.
methods: measured leukocyte telomere length 161 black south african
teachers 180 white south african teachers aged 23 66 years without a
history atherothrombotic vascular disease. age, sex, years lived the
area, human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection, hypertension, body mass
index, dyslipidemia, hemoglobin a1c, c-reactive protein, smoking, physical
activity, alcohol abuse, depressive symptoms, psychological distress, work
stress considered covariates.
results: black participants shorter (median, interquartile range) relative
telomere length (0.79, 0.70-0.95) white participants (1.06, 0.87-1.21; p
< .001), difference changed little adjusting covariates. 
in fully adjusted models, age (p < .001), male sex (p = .011), hiv positive
status (p = .023) associated shorter telomere length. ethnicity not
significantly interact covariates determining telomere length,
including psychosocial characteristics.
conclusions: black south africans showed markedly shorter telomeres did
white south african counterparts. age, male sex, hiv status associated
with shorter telomere length. interactions ethnicity biomedical or
psychosocial factors found. ethnic difference telomere length might
primarily explained genetic factors.
