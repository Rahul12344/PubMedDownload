bluetongue virus serotype 8 (btv-8) emerged north-western europe 2006. in
2007, one affected countries (the netherlands) implemented sentinel
network dairy cattle. data offered opportunity estimate
transmission parameters. field data, number secondary infected
cows became infected one infectious cow completely susceptible herd 
through bites infectious culicoides i.e. basic reproduction ratio
(r(0)) calculated. information, r(0) btv-8 estimated
using formulae general sir model. 2007, btv-8 epidemic started 
the south spread northwards following months. r(0) could estimated 
for 197 herds transmission occurred. median r(0) 2.3 the
mean r(0) 3.7 (5th percentile=1.8; 95th percentile=11.0). northern
region btv-8 transmission occurred later season less favorable 
conditions transmission, r(0) remained significantly lower south.
our model differed earlier published theoretical models btv-8
transmission estimated transmission serological field data 
other models used literature based assumptions majority parameters
included models. although many differences model 
and previously developed theoretical models, results showed similar 
ranges r(0) btv-8. reasons similarity results may 
be that, although part vector included parameters 
model, transmission based serological field data cows represented 
btv-8 transmission influenced cows vector, culicoides. furthermore,
in earlier models assumptions made vector part, although derived
from literature, probably gave good representation true behavior 
culicoides species associated btv-8 transmission north-western 
europe.
