the hepatitis e virus (hev) described humans various animal
species different regions world. however, knowledge natural hev 
infection non-human primates corresponding risk zoonotic
transmission scarce. determine whether primates captivity affected
by hev infection, investigated 259 individual sera clinically healthy
non-human primates 14 species nine german zoos. using commercial
double-antigen-sandwich elisa commercial igg elisa, 10 animals (3·9%)
reacted positive least one assay. three ape species one old world
monkey species among seropositive animals: bonobo (pan paniscus),
gorilla (gorilla gorilla gorilla), lar gibbon (hylobates lar) drill
(mandrillus leucophaeus). testing anti-hev-igm antibodies commercial elisa
and viral rna reverse-transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction
resulted negative results animals indicating absence acute hev 
infections. past, clinical signs hepatitis recorded the
seropositive animals. results suggest non-human primates zoos get
naturally subclinically infected hev related hepeviruses. future
studies evaluate potential sources transmission routes these
infections impact human health.
