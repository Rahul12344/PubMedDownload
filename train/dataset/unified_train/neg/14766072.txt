objective: investigate role interleukin-10 (il-10) herpetic stromal 
keratitis (hsk).
methods: eighty balb/c mice divided two groups infected hsv-1 
mckrae strain corneal scarification. murine ril-10 (20 ng/ml) inoculated
intracorneally 6 h days 0, 2 4 topical hsv-1
corneal infection. ril-10 (500 ng) given intraperitoneally treated mice
simultaneously. amount saline injected control mice. the
effects il-10 hsk evaluated.
results: il-10-treated animals, onset hsk delayed, corneal
stromal opacification neovascularization reduced, extensive cellular
infiltrates cornea prevented delayed type hypersensitivity (dth) 
was weakened. examination pro-inflammatory cytokine levels cornea 10
days infection revealed amounts il-2 il-6 lower
than found controls. il-10 suppress viral replication
nor eliminate virus il-10-treated eyes, compared the
controls.
conclusions: il-10 treatment suppress dth responsiveness production
of certain cytokines corneal cells. delays onset decreases the
severity hsk.
