background: use hepatitis b core antibody (hbcab+) hepatitis c
antibody (hcv ab+) positive donors represents one strategy increase available 
donor organs, remains controversial concern viral
transmission recipients. hypothesized isolated hbcab+ donors represent
minimal risk viral transmission vaccinated lung transplant (ltx)
recipients.
methods: retrospective study performed ltx recipients received
hbcab+ hcv ab+ pulmonary allografts. analyzed liver function studies, viral
hepatitis screening tests, quantitative polymerase chain reaction hepatitis b
viral dna (hbv dna) hepatitis c viral rna (hcv rna), freedom from
bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, acute rejection, survival.
results: april 1992 august 2003, 456 ltx operations performed.
twenty-nine patients (hb group) received hbcab+ allograft transplants a
median posttransplant follow-up 24.5 months. three critically ill patients (hc
group) received hcv ab+ allografts median follow-up 21.5 months.
one-year survival hb group 83% versus 82% patients who
received non-hb organs (p=0.36). patient hb group developed clinical
liver disease viral hepatitis, patients alive (n=21) at
follow-up are, date, hbv dna and/or hbcab negative. patients hc
group tested hcv rna positive; one patient died liver failure 22 months.
conclusions: risk viral transmission hcv ab+ allografts seems high 
ltx. however, use hbcab+ pulmonary allografts recipients prior
hepatitis b vaccination seems safe effective strategy increase
organ availability.
