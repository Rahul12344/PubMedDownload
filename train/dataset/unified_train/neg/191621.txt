human cells transformed vitro human cytomegalovirus: tumorigenicity in
athymic nude mice.

geder l, kreider j, rapp f.

athymic nude mice inoculated human embryo lung cells transformed in
vitro human cytomegalovirus (cmv). inoculated animals, 62% developed
tumors average latent period 19 days. tumors composed of
small, polygonal cells large nulei scanty cytoplasm embedded an
abundant collagenous matrix. cells poorly differentiated may have
been epithelial origin. adjacent structures rarely invaded. cmv-related
intracellular membrane antigens detected indirect anticomplement 
immunofluorescence techniques cells cultured vitro tumors.
