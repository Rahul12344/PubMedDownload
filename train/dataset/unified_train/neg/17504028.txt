in recent years, micrornas (mirnas), class 19-25 nucleotides noncoding rnas,
have shown play major role gene regulation across broad range of
metazoans important diverse biological functions. mirnas 
involved regulation protein expression primarily binding one or
more target sites mrna transcript causing cleavage repression of
translation. computer-based approaches mirna gene identification mirna
target prediction considered indispensable mirna research.
similarly, effective experimental techniques validating silico predictions are
crucial testing finetuning computational algorithms. iterative
interactions silico experimental methods playing central
role biology mirnas. review, summarize various
computational methods identification mirnas targets well as
the technologies developed validate predictions.
