purpose: determined ultrastructure mouse adenovirus keratitis, model 
for human adenovirus keratitis.
methods: adenovirus keratitis induced c57bl/6j mice intrastromal
injection human adenovirus species type 37 (hadv-d37) heat-pulled,
glass, micropipette needle compressed air. select time points after
infection, mice euthanized corneas removed, fixed, sectioned
at 70-nm thickness electron microscopy.
results: injection hadv-d37 mouse corneal stroma placed virus
predominantly pericellular corneal stromal matrix. virus seen bound to
and entering stromal cells 1 2 hours infection, respectively. cell
membrane transit virus seen involve two distinct structures resembling 
caveolae macropinosomes. however, later infection intracellular virus 
was seen within membrane-bound organelles. 8 hours infection,
intracellular virus accumulated densely packed, perinuclear arrays.
virus disassembly obvious time point infection. infiltrating
neutrophils seen one day infection engulfed degraded stromal cells
by 4 days infection.
conclusions: transmission electron microscopy, injected hadv-d37 readily
enters stromal cells c57bl/6j mouse cornea induces stromal
inflammation, shown previously light microscopy. however, electron
microscopy also revealed dense, static arrays intracytoplasmic virus,
suggesting block viral capsid disassembly viral dna nuclear entry. these
findings may explain human adenoviruses replicate mouse corneal
stroma.
