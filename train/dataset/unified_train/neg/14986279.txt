human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected patients frequently present with
elevated levels serum transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [alt] and/or
aspartate aminotransferase [ast]). often attributed hepatic 
effects antiretroviral (arv) drugs, including nonnucleoside
reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (nnrtis). review cohort studies
investigating incidence hepatotoxicity among patients receiving arv
therapy suggests overall rate alt and/or ast elevations similar
among arvs. rate severe hepatotoxicity, alt and/or astlevels >5 times 
the upper limit normal (uln), therapy nnrtis relatively low but
may significantly higher patients concurrent chronic viral hepatitis
(hepatitis b c). comprehensive analysis 17 randomized clinical trials 
nevirapine demonstrated 10% nevirapine-treated patients developed
elevated levels alt and/or ast >5 times uln; however, almost two-thirds
(6.3% nevirapine-treated patients) elevations asymptomatic.
symptomatic hepatic events seen 4.9% (3.2%-8.9%) nevirapine-treated
patients.
