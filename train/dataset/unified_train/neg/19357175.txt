human metapneumovirus (hmpv) identified worldwide agent serious 
upper lower respiratory tract infections infants young children. hmpv 
is second respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) leading cause of
bronchiolitis, and, like rsv, consists two major genotypes cocirculate
and vary among communities year year. children experienced acute hmpv
infection may develop sequelae wheezing asthma; however, features
contributing pathology remain unknown. possible mechanism for
postbronchiolitis disease hmpv might persist lung providing a
stimulus could contribute wheezing asthma. using immunohistochemistry
to identify hmpv-infected cells lungs mice, show hmpv mediates 
biphasic replication respiratory epithelial cells infection migrates to
neuronal processes innervate lungs virus persists no
detectable infection epithelial cells. glucocorticoid treatment, the
virus reactivated neural fibers reinfects epithelial cells. the
findings show hmpv persists neural fibers suggest mechanism for
disease chronicity important implications hmpv disease intervention 
strategies.
