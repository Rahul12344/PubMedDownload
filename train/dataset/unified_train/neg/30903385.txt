background: glecaprevir pibrentasvir (gle/pib) potent antiviral agents
for hepatitis c virus (hcv) pan-genotypic infections; however, clinical
effectiveness safety remain limited real-world. study aimed to
evaluate viral responses safety gle/pib patients chronic
hcv-1/2/3 infections initial- (arm a) re-treatment (arm b) with
all-oral direct-acting antiviral agents (daas).
methods: prospective-observational cohort study included japanese patients
with chronic hcv-1/2/3 infections (n = 271: 183 arm 83 arm b), who
had started receiving gle/pib. primary end point sustained virological
response (svr) rate week 12 (svr12) end gle/pib treatment (eot).
results: svr12 achieved 99.4% patients (180/181: modified
intention-to-treat (mitt) analysis excluding 2 patients lost follow-up) arm
a. one patient hcv-3b infection discontinued week 8 failed to
achieve svr12. svr12 achieved 97.7% patients (85/87: mitt excluding 1
patient lost follow-up) arm b. virological relapse occurred 2 patients
with hcv-1b, presenting common 5 loci resistance-associated substitutions
(rass) including a92 rass ns5a lesion baseline. adverse events
(aes) (grade ≥ 3) occurred 8 patients (3.0%). 8 patients (3.0%) discontinued
due aes, however, achieved svr12.
conclusions: initial re-treatment gle/pib effective safe for
japanese patients hcv-1/2/3 real-life settings. studies are
required elucidate mechanism underlying treatment failures gle/pib to
completely eradicate hcv worldwide.
