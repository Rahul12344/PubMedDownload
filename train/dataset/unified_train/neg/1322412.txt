analysis vaccinia topoisomerase mutants impaired dna relaxation
has allowed identification amino acid residues required the
transesterification step catalysis. missense mutations wild-type residues
gly-132----asp arg-223----gln rendered protein inert formation 
covalent enzyme-dna complex hence completely inactive dna relaxation.
mutations thr-147----ile gly-132----ser caused severe defects covalent 
adduct formation correlated extent inhibition relaxation.
none point mutations effect noncovalent dna binding sufficient
to account defect relaxation. deletion amino- carboxyl-terminal 
portions polypeptide abrogated noncovalent dna binding. two distinct
topoisomerase-dna complexes resolved native gel electrophoresis. one
complex, unique proteins competent covalent adduct
formation, contained topoisomerase bound 5'-portion incised dna
strand. 3'-segment cleaved strand dissociated spontaneously. 
complex isolated shown catalyze transfer covalently bound dna
to heterologous acceptor oligonucleotide, thereby proving covalent
adduct protein duplex dna true intermediate strand breakage
and reunion. role active site region eukaryotic topoisomerase in
determining sensitivity resistance camptothecin examined converting 
the active site region resistant vaccinia enzyme (skray274) the
drug-sensitive yeast enzyme (skiny). skiny mutation alter the
resistance vaccinia enzyme cleavage-enhancing effects of
camptothecin.
