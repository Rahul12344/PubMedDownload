infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (ihnv) outbreaks significant
negative impact atlantic salmon salmo salar production british columbia,
canada, since first outbreak reported 1992. 2005, apex-ihn®
vaccine approved use canada prevention ihn. vaccine was
proven safe efficacious prior approval; however, unknown to
whether apex-ihn®-vaccinated atlantic salmon infected ihnv support
replication virus shedding sufficient quantities provide infectious 
dose nearby susceptible host. determine whether vaccinated, infected fish
are able transmit infectious dose ihnv, vaccinated atlantic salmon 
injected ihnv (104 plaque-forming units per fish) cohabitated with
either naïve atlantic salmon naïve sockeye salmon oncorhynchus nerka.
apex-ihn®-vaccinated fish significantly protected ihnv with
mortality occurring 2.6% population opposed 97% in
unvaccinated controls. vaccination ihnv-infected atlantic salmon completely
abolished disease transmission cohabitating naïve sockeye salmon reduced
virus spread among cohabitating naïve atlantic salmon. 7 mo post-vaccination, 
ihnv-neutralizing antibodies detected nearly vaccinated fish (94%)
with similar titer occurring vaccinated, infected fish vaccinated,
uninfected fish, indicating apex-ihn® vaccination induces robust seroconversion
response. taken together, results demonstrate vaccination greatly
reduces infectious load potential ihnv transmission. such,
apex-ihn® included fish health management strategies culturing 
atlantic salmon ihnv endemic areas.
