background hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection metabolic diseases including
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nash) exhibit complex interplay. although free
fatty acid-mediated apoptosis prominent feature nash, impact hcv
infection hepatocyte lipotoxicity remained largely unexplored. study
aimed identifying whether infection hcv affected apoptotic pathway in
hepatocytes fatty acid assault. material methods or6 cells, 
derived human hepatocellular carcinoma huh-7 cells harbor full-length 
hcv rna genome replication system, treated palmitate. apoptosis was
examined 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. activation expression 
jnk, bim, ciap-1, mcl-1 examined immunoblotting. mrna expression of
chop, major player endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis, was
assessed real-time pcr. results palmitate-induced hepatocyte apoptosis was
significantly enhanced or6 cells compared cured cells, hcv
genome eradicated treatment interferon-Î±. although basal
expression chop mrna enhanced or6 cells compared cured cells, was
similarly upregulated cell lines following palmitate treatment. notably, 
palmitate-induced jnk phosphorylation accentuated or6 cells compared to
cured cells. inhibition jnk sp600125 attenuated palmitate-induced
apoptosis. palmitate-mediated upregulation bh3-only protein bim, acts
downstream jnk, also enhanced or6 cells compared cured cells. in
contrast, mcl-1 ciap-1 equally reduced or6 cells cured cells
following palmitate treatment. conclusions findings suggest during
lipoapoptosis, hcv infection may enhance hepatocyte toxicity increasing jnk
phosphorylation.
