based description outbreak foot-and-mouth disease (fmd), a
particle model developed describing important properties this
epidemic. also control measures (mass ring vaccination) implemented. this
model shows expected behavior simulations. since impossible treat
this model analytically, use ideas branching processes two levels to
derive caricature particle model. simulations shown this
caricature exhibits similar behavior particle system. possible to
analyze caricature and, way, obtain expressions most
important quantities like reproduction number expected final number of
infected individuals etc. way mass vaccination ring vaccination can
be compared control strategies optimized.
