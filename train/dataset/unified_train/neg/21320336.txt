background: twenty-nine marek's disease virus (mdv) strains isolated 
a 3 year period (2007-2010) vaccinated infected chicken flocks in
poland. strains caused severe clinical symptoms lesions. spite
of proper vaccination mono- bivalent vaccines marek's disease
(md), chickens developed symptoms md paralysis.because we
decided investigate possible changes mutations field strains that
could potentially increase virulence. supposed mutations may
have caused recombination retroviruses poultry - especially
reticuloendotheliosis virus (rev).
methods: order detect possible reasons recent changes virulence
of mdv strains, polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analyses meq oncogene for
long-terminal repeat (ltr) region rev conducted. obtained pcr
products sequenced compared mdv rev strains isolated
worldwide accessible genebank database.
results: sequencing meq oncogene showed 68 basepair insertion frame 
shift within 12 24 field strains. interestingly, analyses also showed
0.78, 0.8, 0.82, 1.6 kb random ltr-rev insertions mdv genome
in 28 29 strains. genetic inserts present passage in
chicken embryo kidney cells suggesting ltr integration non-functional
region mdv genome.
conclusion: results indicate presence recombination mdv 
rev field conditions polish chicken farms. genetic changes within
the mdv genome may influence virus replication features vivo.
however, evidence meq alteration rev insertions related 
to strains' virulence.
