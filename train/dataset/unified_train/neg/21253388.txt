aim: develop hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) xenograft model studying
hepatitis c virus (hcv) replication mice, antiviral treatment.
methods: developed stable s3-green fluorescence protein (gfp) cell line that
replicated gfp-tagged hcv sub-genomic rna derived highly efficient
jfh1 virus. s3-gfp replicon cell line injected subcutaneously into
γ-irradiated scid mice. showed s3-gfp replicon cell line formed human
hcc xenografts scid mice. cells isolated subcutaneous tumors and
then serially passaged multiple times scid mice culturing growth medium 
supplemented g-418. mouse-adapted s3-gfp replicon cells implanted
subcutaneously also liver scid mice via intrasplenic infusion 
study replication hcv hcc xenografts. tumor model validated
for antiviral testing intraperitoneal injection interferon-α (ifn-α).
results: highly tumorigenic s3-gfp replicon cell line developed formed
subcutaneous tumors within 2 wk diffuse liver metastasis within 4 wk scid 
mice. replication hcv subcutaneous liver tumors confirmed by
cell colony assay, detection viral rna ribonuclease protection assay
and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
high-level replication hcv sub-genomic rna tumor could visualized by
gfp expression using fluorescence microscopy. ifn-α cleared hcv rna replication
in subcutaneous tumors within 2 wk 4 wk liver tumor model.
conclusion: non-infectious mouse model allows us study replication hcv in
subcutaneous metastatic liver tumors. clearance hcv ifn-α supports use 
of model test anti-hcv drugs.
