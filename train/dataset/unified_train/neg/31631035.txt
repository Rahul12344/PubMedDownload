background: ebola virus (ebov), variant makona, causative agent the
2013-2016 west african epidemic responsible almost 30,000 human infections
and 11,000 fatalities. epidemic, development several
experimental vaccines accelerated human clinical trials. one them,
the vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv)-based vaccine vsv-ebov, showed promising
efficacy phase 3 clinical trial guinea currently used the
ongoing ebov outbreak northeastern part democratic republic 
congo (drc). vaccine expresses ebov-kikwit glycoprotein 1995
outbreak immunogen.
methods: generated vsv-based vaccine expressing contemporary
ebov-makona glycoprotein. characterized vaccine tissue culture and
analyzed vaccine efficacy cynomolgus macaque model. subsequently, we
determined dose-dependent protective efficacy nonhuman primates against
lethal ebov challenge.
findings: observed complete protection disease vsv-ebov doses
ranging 1 × 107 1 × 101 plaque-forming units. protected animals
receiving lower vaccine doses developed temporary low-level ebov viremia. control
animals developed classical ebov disease reached euthanasia criteria within a
week challenge. study demonstrates low doses vsv-ebov
uniformly protect macaques lethal ebov challenge.
interpretation: study provides missing pre-clinical data supporting use
of reduced vsv-ebov vaccine doses without decreasing protective efficacy at
the time increase vaccine safety availability - two critical concerns in
public health response.
