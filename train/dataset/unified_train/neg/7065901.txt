incomplete avian influenza virus contains defective non-interfering component.

carter mj, mahy bw.

incomplete avian influenza (fowl plague) virus derived undiluted egg passage, 
displayed increased capacity promote synthesis intracellular
virus-specific proteins compared standard virus. vitro
virion-bound rna polymerase activity incomplete virus also greater than
could explained presence residual infectious virus. titres 
of infectious interfering virus species determined directly, did
not account virus present. existence defective non-interfering
(dni) virus, even standard virus preparations, inferred. dni virus is
capable initiating infection, synthesis mrna proteins cannot
complete productive replication cycle, interfere with
multiplication standard virus. dni virus could exaggerate true extent
of di virus formation lowering pfu:hau ratio account the
failure correlate infectivity rna composition rna polymerase activity.
