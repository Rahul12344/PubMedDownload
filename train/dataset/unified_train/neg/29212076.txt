objectives: resistance-associated mutations (rams) integrase different 
hiv-1 subtypes investigated cohort patients never exposed to
integrase strand transfer inhibitors (instis).
methods: viral rna extracted plasma samples 53 insti-naïve
patients, integrase genetic region sequenced analyzed subtype
assignment drug resistance.
results: median viral load sampling 5.28 × 104 rna copies/ml. bayesian
phylogenetic analysis showed 85% hiv-1 isolates non-b subtypes, 
a predominance subtypes c (22.6%) crf01_ae (26.4%). total 52 110 
mutations found integrase region hiv-1 b non-b subtypes,
respectively. nonpolymorphic insti-rams detected study. however,
the accessory mutation e157q found 1 patient crf02_ag, the
polymorphic mutations l74m/i may contribute reduced susceptibility to
instis presence major mutations observed 6 (13.3%) patients
with non-b subtypes 1 (12.5%) patient b subtype. polymorphic
mutations positions known harbor primary accessory rams also
detected study.
conclusion: results highlight importance monitoring emergence of
insti-rams initiation insti-based therapy.
