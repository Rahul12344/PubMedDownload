western blot analysis 16 serum specimens seminole indians demonstrated
that 14 reacted type-specific recombinant epitope (rgp46ii+) human 
lymphotropic virus type ii (htlv-ii), whereas remaining 2 specimens not
(rgp46ii-). rgp46ii- specimens demonstrated presence htlv-ii genome by
polymerase chain reaction analysis. culture 1 specimens demonstrated 
presence type c retrovirus particles electron microscopy, p24gag
antigens detectable culture supernatant. nucleotide sequence analysis 
557 bp env gene (position 5405-5961) 2 rgp46ii- and
rgp46ii+ specimens demonstrated sequence conservation rgp46ii epitope
(k-55(162-205)). thus, lack immune reactivity rgp46 due sequence 
variation within epitope. observation suggests immunodominant env 
epitopes may universally recognized. therefore, specimens p24gag 
r21eenv reactivity modified western blot assays tested by
more sensitive techniques.
