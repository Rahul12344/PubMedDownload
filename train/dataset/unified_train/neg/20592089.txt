three-dimensional (3d) porcine nasal mucosal tracheal mucosal epithelial cell
cultures developed analyze foot-and-mouth disease virus (fmdv)
interactions mucosal epithelial cells. cells cultures
differentiated polarized closely resemble epithelial layers
seen vivo. fmdv infected cultures predominantly apical side,
primarily binding integrin alphav beta6, arg-gly-asp (rgd)-dependent 
manner. however, fmdv replicated transiently without visible cytopathic 
effect (cpe), infectious progeny virus could recovered the
apical side. infection induced production beta interferon (ifn-beta)
and ifn-inducible gene mx1 mrna, coincided disappearance of
viral rna progeny virus. induction ifn-beta mrna correlated the
antiviral activity supernatants apical basolateral
compartments. ifn-alpha mrna constitutively expressed nasal mucosal
epithelial cells vitro vivo. addition, fmdv infection induced
interleukin 8 (il-8) protein, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(gm-csf), rantes mrna infected epithelial cells, suggesting it
plays important role modulating immune response.
