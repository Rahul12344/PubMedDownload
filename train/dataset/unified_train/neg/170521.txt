virus infections.

because photodynamic inactivation herpes simplex virus infections may be
free hazard, efficacy photodynamic inactivation neutral red and
light evaluated placebo-controlled study 170 episodes recurrent
herpes simplex virus infection 96 patients. preparation neutral red
that used shown photoinactivate herpes simplex virus vitro, had
no significant effect rate resolution herpetic lesions (p greater
than 0.10) frequency subsequent recurrences (p greater 0.10),
except orolabial lesions, adverse effect rate of
subsequent recurrences observed (p less 0.05). absence of
demonstrated efficacy, routine use neutral red light patients 
recurrent herpes simplex virus infections discontinued. furthermore,
other photoactive dyes used efficacy been
demonstrated suitably controlled clinical trials.
