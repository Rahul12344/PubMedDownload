purpose: determine subcellular localization 18 kda fgf-2 after
synthesis secretion extracellular matrix.
methods: corneal endothelial cells (cec) transfected expression
vector coding green fluorescent protein (gfp) 18 kda fgf-2. expression of
the fusion protein determined immunoblot analysis subcellular
localization fusion protein examined immunocytochemical analysis.
results: expression fusion protein determined immunoblot
analysis, expressed fusion protein molecular weight 45 kda,
resulting 27 kda gfp 18 kda fgf-2. following 90 min exposure of
cells vector, expressed 18 kda fgf-2 completely translocated to
the nucleus within 24 h incubation. cells incubated for
another 24 h, one-half fusion protein retro-transported the
nucleus cytoplasm, largely membrane focal adhesion site, 
the half remained nucleus. 72 h incubation, fusion
protein completely translocated cytoplasm, diffusely
distributed staining potential greatly lost. transfected cells showed
both slight increase cell proliferation down-regulation the
expression high affinity receptors fgf.
conclusions: results indicate 18 kda fgf-2 directly
translocated synthetic site nucleus. nuclear 18 kda fgf-2 
then retro-transported membrane/focal adhesion sites, molecule
may secreted. 18 kda fgf-2 remains nucleus, slight
stimulatory activity cell proliferation down-regulation receptor.
these data suggest intracellular action 18 kda fgf-2 mechanisms
independent receptor-mediated signaling pathways.
