objective: investigate hiv-1 nef specific cd8(+) cell responses in
long-term nonprogressor (ltnp) aids patient china.
methods: peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected 7 ltnps 9
aids patients, 12 males 4 females, aged 37 (27 approximately 55). panel 
26 overlapping peptides spanning hiv-1 nef constituting 3 peptide pools used 
as antigens. hiv-1 nef specific cd8(+) cell responses ltnps aids
patients examined ifn- elispot assay. amount cd4(+) cell and
viral load detected. relationships hiv-1 nef specific cd8(+) t
cell responses cd4(+) cell counts viral loads studied.
results: strength hiv-1 nef specific cd8(+) cell responses ltnp group
was 404 +/- 33 sfc/10(6) pbmcs, significantly higher aids group 
(59 +/- 121 sfc/10(6) pbmcs). strength hiv-1 nef specific cd8(+) cell
responses positively correlated cd4(+) cell count. relationship
between strength cd8(+) cell responses viral load found.
conclusion: hiv-1 nef specific cd8(+) cell responses may play important role
in preventing disease progression hiv infection. cross immune
response major hiv-1 strains europe china.
