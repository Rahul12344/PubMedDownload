we recently isolated r7, spontaneous moloney murine sarcoma virus (momusv)
124 variant. molecular cloning sequence analysis showed that, relative to
momusv 124, r7 extra repeat enhancer truncated mos gene in
frame truncated gag coding sequence. report presents detailed
study pathology induced r7. r7 induced sarcomas well
developed angiomatous components also brain lesions. brain lesions were
observed less-than-48-hour-old balb/c mice inoculated greater 2 
x 10(5) r7 focus-forming units (ffus). r7 detected brains examined 
day 9 inoculation, brain lesions observed two four mice
examined day 14 inoculation. light microscopy brains revealed that
approximately 15% lesions unenclosed blood pools varying sizes
containing red blood cells inflammatory cells spreading surrounding
brain tissues. remainder brain lesions tumor cells. lesions 
ranged enlarged vascular endothelial cells intermixed blood cells
to large circumscribed lesions consisting well developed tangled masses of
vessels surrounded blood pools. activated astrocytes surrounded and
infiltrated tumors. addition, thymus r7-infected mice regressed
significantly precipitously due apoptosis (especially cortical
thymocytes) end stage disease.
