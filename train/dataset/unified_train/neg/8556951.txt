the ortho cytoronabsolute flow cytometer designed provide direct absolute
counts lymphocytes subsets single instrument. study 
designed determine performance four geographically separated
cytoronabsolute instruments using 24-h-old, shipped, whole blood samples to
compare results obtained cytoronabsolute obtained using
combinations hematology instruments flow cytometers. absolute
count feature cytoronabsolutes located four sites cross
calibrated gave across-site coefficients variation (cvs) <4.0% for
absolute count 8.2% absolute lymphocyte count. calibration stable
for least 2 months. absolute lymphocyte counts lymphocyte percentage
immunophenotypes determined blood 50 healthy human immunodeficiency 
virus (hiv)-seronegative donors. significant site-to-site
differences (each p > .05) cd3+/cd4+ absolute lymphocyte counts determined 
the cytoronabsolute. contrast, significant site-to-site difference
(p < .001) sites 2 3 sites 3 4 absolute cd3+/cd4+
lymphocyte counts determined via conventional method combining flow
cytometry-derived percentage hematology instrument-derived lymphocyte
count. significant difference (p = .388) cd3+/cd4+ lymphocyte
percent determinations cytoronabsolute facscan profile ii 
flow cytometers used study. results demonstrate different
operators cross calibrate cytoronabsolutes absolute cd3+/cd4+ lymphocyte 
subset determinations, even large geographic distances.
