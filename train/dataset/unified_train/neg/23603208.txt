we review mathematical modeling related statistical issues hiv dynamics
primarily response antiretroviral drug therapy article. start
from basic model virus infection review number advanced
models consideration pharmacokinetic factors, adherence drug
resistance. specifically, illustrate mathematical models developed 
and parameterized understand effects long-term treatment different 
treatment strategies disease progression. addition, discuss variety of
parameter estimation methods differential equation models applicable
to either within- between-host viral dynamics.
