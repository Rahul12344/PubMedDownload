a molecular hybridization technique developed detect bunyavirus rna in
cells. complementary dnas (cdnas) small (s) rna segment la crosse (lac)
virus portion middle (m) rna segment snowshoe hare (ssh) virus
were used probes detect lac ssh viral rna situ hybridization.
protocols developed standardized using radiolabeled dna probes, and
adapted use biotin labeled probes. situ hybridization procedure
detected estimated 3,600 copies viral rna/cell 24 hr postinfection. in
growth curve studies, lac nucleocapsid antigen detectable slightly s
rna. lac rna synthesis first seen nucleus. 12 hr
postinfection, hybridization signal detected throughout cytoplasm 
cell. lac rna probe group-specific cross-hybridized 5 other
california group viruses. ssh rna probe type-specific.
