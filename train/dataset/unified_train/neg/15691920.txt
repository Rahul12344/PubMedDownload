the accumulation fate model microbial "pathogens" within drinking-water 
distribution system investigated naturally grown biofilms formed a
novel pilot-scale water distribution system provided chlorinated and
uv-treated water. biofilms exposed 1-mum hydrophilic hydrophobic
microspheres, salmonella bacteriophages 28b, legionella pneumophila bacteria,
and fate monitored 38-day period. accumulation model
pathogens generally independent biofilm cell density shown 
be dependent particle surface properties, hydrophilic spheres
accumulated larger extent hydrophobic ones. higher accumulation of
culturable legionellae measured chlorinated system compared the
uv-treated system increasing residence time. fate spheres and
fluorescence situ hybridization-positive legionellae similar and
independent primary disinfectant applied water residence time. the
more rapid loss culturable legionellae compared fluorescence situ
hybridization-positive legionellae attributed loss culturability
rather physical desorption. loss bacteriophage 28b plaque-forming ability
together erosion may affected fate within biofilms the
pilot-scale distribution system. current study demonstrated that
desorption one primary mechanisms affecting loss microspheres, 
legionellae, bacteriophage biofilms within pilot-scale distribution
system well disinfection biological grazing. general, two primary
disinfection regimens (chlorination uv treatment) shown a
measurable impact accumulation fate model microbial pathogens
within water distribution system.
