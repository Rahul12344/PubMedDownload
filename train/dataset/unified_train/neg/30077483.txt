the aim study develop test optimal vaccination strategy
against bovine viral diarrhea virus (bvdv) based e2 glycoprotein the
bj1305 strain. achieve higher e2-specific antibody titers broaden the
cellular immune response, plasmid encoding e2 protein (pcdna3.1-e2) was
constructed purified recombinant e2 protein generated. e2 protein
was emulsified adjuvant isa 61 vg prior administration. immunized
mice three times pcdna3.1-e2 recombinant e2 protein primed twice
with pcdna3.1-e2 boosted e2 protein. evaluate protection
against bvdv conferred vaccines, mice challenged bvdv strain
oregon c24v third immunization. although immunized mice developed
humoral cellular immune responses, e2-specific antibody titers dna
prime-protein boost group significantly higher elicited either
the dna protein vaccine. addition, vaccination e2 dna vaccine 
induced higher percentages cd4+ifn-γ+ cells cd8+ifn-γ+ cells among
total cd3+ cells regimens. predominant antibody subclass 
the vaccinated mice igg1. serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α) levels in
the dna prime-protein boost group significantly higher third
immunization groups. moreover, mice treated dna
prime-protein boost vaccination regimen acquired protection bvdv
challenge, shown significant reduction viremia, minor
pathological changes, lower viral antigen burden control and
solo vaccinated mice. results demonstrate potential advantage dna 
prime-protein boost vaccination approach solo vaccination the
prevention bvdv. ability vaccine strategy control eradicate
bvd herds warrants investigation.
