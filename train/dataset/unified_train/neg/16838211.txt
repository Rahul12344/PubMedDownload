repeated titrations strains newcastle disease virus (ndv) more
conveniently undertaken cell cultures rather embryonated eggs. is
relatively easy mesogenic velogenic strains cytopathic to
various cell lines, difficult avirulent australian isolates 
poorly cytopathic. strain v4 example shown pathogenic iin
vitro chicken embryo liver cells. strain i-2 reported produce
cytopathic effect (cpe) chicken embryo kidney (cek) cells. present studies
confirmed observation developed quantal assay. cek cells infected with
strain i-2 developed cpe characterized degeneration, rounding, granularity and
vacuolation, formation synctia. end points readily established by
microscopic examination fixed stained cells. virus infectivity studies 
on strain i-2, multiple titrations required large numbers 
samples used, titration using cek cell grown microtitre plates is
recommended. studies may feasible embryonated eggs.
