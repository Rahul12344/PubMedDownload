the 2-5a/rnase l pathway belongs antiviral system induced interferon
(ifn). rnase l inactive endoribonuclease activated 2'-5'
oligoadenylate (2-5a) synthesized 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetases. once
activated, rnase l cleaves mrna, inhibiting protein synthesis, well 28s
and 18s ribosomal rna (rrna), leading ribosomal inactivation. study,
we investigate role rnase l pathway cell defence mechanism during
varicella-zoster virus (vzv) replication, importance 68-kda protein 
named rnase l inhibitor (rli), specifically inhibits rnase l. we
demonstrate rnase l rli transcripts levels remain constant in
vzv-infected cells 24 h 12 h, respectively, decrease
until end viral cycle. vzv significantly modulate protein
level rnase l course infection. using rrna cleavage assay 
analyse rnase l catalytic activity, demonstrate vzv replication leads
to minimal cleavage rrna. moreover, overexpression rli a
permissive cell line significant effect vzv replication. we
conclude rnase l constitute major cell defence mechanism 
the vzv infection.
