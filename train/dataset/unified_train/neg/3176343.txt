rnas 13 strains cucumber mosaic virus (cmv) divided two groups 
on basis ability hybridize cdna either fny-cmv rna or
wl-cmv rna. extent cross-hybridization within one groups 
analyzed rna protection assay. cdna clone rna 3 fny strain of
cmv placed transcription vector bacterial promoters t3 t7.
labeled, minus-sense rna transcripts prepared part cdna rna
3 fny-cmv annealed genomic rna number of
cucumoviruses digested rnases. patterns rna fragments protected
from digestion specific cmv strain revealed extent and
location heterogeneity among viruses well within fny-cmv natural
population. approach allow differences host range disease
processes correlated variations genomic rnas.
