nicotiana benthamiana plants transformed coat protein gene tomato
bushy stunt virus (tbsv) failed elicit effective virus resistance when
inoculated wildtype virus. subsequently, r1 r2 progeny 13
transgenic lines inoculated tbsv mutant containing defective coat
protein gene. mild symptoms typical elicited nontransformed plants
infected tbsv mutant initially appeared. however, within 2 4 weeks,
up 20% transgenic plants sporadically began develop lethal
syndrome characteristic wild-type virus infections. rna hybridization and
immunoblot analyses plants nontransformed n. benthamiana inoculated 
with virus transgenic lines indicated wild-type virus been
regenerated double recombination event defective virus the
coat protein transgene. similar results obtained tbsv deletion mutant
containing nucleotide sequence marker, chimeric cucumber necrosis
virus (cnv) containing defective tbsv coat protein gene. cases,
purified virions contained wild-type tbsv rna cnv chimeric rna derived by
recombination transgenic coat protein mrna. results thus
demonstrate recombinant tombus-viruses arise frequently viral genes
expressed transgenic plants.
