diverse species rodents shrews, abundant worldwide, harbor a
variety viruses; closely related human viruses and
possess zoonotic potential. previously studies demonstrated the
mammarenavirus hantavirus carried rodents shrews could cause diseases
in human population. determine distribution zoonotic viruses in
shenzhen city, major city southern china high population density,
we analyzed 225 rodents (rattus norvegicus rattus flavipectus) 196 shrews
(suncus murinus) urban rural districts presence of
mammarenavirus, hantavirus, hepatitis e virus (hev) rt-pcr targeting the
conserved regions. infection rates mammarenavirus, hantaviruses, hev 
in rodents shrews 3.56%, 6.89%, 1.66%, respectively. partial genome 
fragment analysis indicated mammarenavirus hantavirus strains more
than 90% 99% nucleic acid identity cardamones virus seoul virus,
respectively, cause diseases humans. although present hev strains
identified typically found worldwide, phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a
divergence 16%. knowledge, present work first report 
prevalence mammarenavirus, hantaviruses, rat hev strains rodents and
shrews shenzhen city, china. findings highlight zoonotic potential
of rodent- shrew-borne mammarenavirus hantavirus, biodiversity of
rat hev isolates shenzhen city. present work suggests utilization 
good hygiene habits important minimize risk zoonosis.
