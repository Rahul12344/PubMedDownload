objectives: circulating cell-free dna (cfdna) potential biomarker tumor 
diagnosis. hepatocyte damage characteristic component pathobiology of
hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc), would expected result substantial 
leakage cfdna circulation. however, diagnostic value cfdna
levels hcc remains unclear.
methods: plasma samples collected 24 hcc patients 62 hepatitis b
virus-related liver fibrosis patients. plasma cfdna levels quantified by
qubit method.
results: plasma cfdna levels associated degree liver
inflammation, body mass index, alpha-fetoprotein (afp) level, not
associated fibrosis stages. plasma cfdna levels significantly higher in
hcc patients non-hcc patients. multivariate analysis revealed age
and cfdna, rather afp, independent predictors hcc. hcc index, 
combination model including age, cfdna, afp, area 0.98 (95%
confidence interval 0.92-1.00) receiver operating characteristics curve
for diagnosis hcc cut-off value 0.61, 87.0% sensitivity and
100% specificity. diagnostic power hcc index superior of
cfdna alone afp alone.
conclusions: results suggest combination cfdna age afp
could improve diagnostic performance hcc.
