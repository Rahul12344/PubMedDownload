the frequencies dna methylation certain tumor-related genes higher in
epstein-barr virus (ebv)-associated gastric carcinomas ebv-negative
gastric carcinomas. ebv-associated gastric carcinomas distinct
clinicopathological features; however, case-control studies
comparing methylation frequency ebv-associated gastric carcinomas and
controls adjusted according clinicopathological features of
ebv-associated gastric carcinomas. study evaluated 25 ebv-associated gastric
carcinomas positive ebv-encoded small rna 1 (eber-1) situ
hybridization 50 ebv-negative gastric carcinomas matched the
ebv-associated gastric carcinomas age, sex, histology, depth tumor
invasion, stage. methylation status 16 loci associated tumor-related 
genes analyzed methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to
identify genes dna methylation specifically occurred ebv-associated
gastric carcinomas. methylation frequencies 12 16 genes higher 
ebv-associated gastric carcinomas ebv-negative controls, the
frequency methylation 6 specific loci (mint2, mint31, p14, p16, p73, and
runx3) significantly higher ebv-associated gastric carcinomas in
ebv-negative controls. significant differences methylation
frequencies genes. mean methylation index ebv-associated
gastric carcinomas significantly higher ebv-negative controls.
dna methylation tumor suppressor genes regulate cell cycle and
apoptosis specifically occurred ebv-associated gastric carcinomas. aberrant
dna methylation might lead development progression ebv-associated
gastric carcinoma.
