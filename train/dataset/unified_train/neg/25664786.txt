influenza viruses remain persistent challenge human health owing their
inherent ability evade immune response antigenic drift. however, the
discovery broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnabs) divergent viruses
has sparked renewed interest universal influenza vaccine novel
therapeutic opportunities. here, crystal structure 1.70 Ã¥ resolution is
presented fab human antibody ch65, broad neutralizing
activity range seasonal h1 isolates. previous studies proposed 
affinity maturation antibody lineage pre-organizes the
complementarity-determining region (cdr) loops energetically favorable
ha-bound conformation. indeed, structural comparisons free and
ha-bound ch65 presented here, cdr loops, particular heavy-chain
cdr3, adopt conformations free bound forms. thus, these
findings support notion affinity maturation ch65 lineage
favorably preconfigures cdr loops high-affinity binding influenza
hemagglutinin.
