pegylation effective strategy reducing biospecific interactions for
pharmaceuticals. plant virus cowpea mosaic virus (cpmv) studied 
potential nanobiomedical applications virtue natural interactions 
mammalian endothelial cells. investigate degree pegylation required 
retarget cpmv-based formulations destinations, two cpmv-peg
formulations, cpmv-peg1000 (p1) cpmv-peg2000 (p2) tested. modeling
suggested peg chains displayed flattened mushrooms the
particle estimated surface grafting area 0.53% p1 0.83% for
p2. p2 formulation effectively shielded particles interacting
with cells tissues, suggesting either key interacting regions the
particle surface blocked sufficient hydration shell been
generated inhibit cellular interactions. large cpmv surface area available
after pegylation allows attachment imaging therapeutic molecules
to particle generate multifunctionality.
