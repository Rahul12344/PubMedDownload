viral promoters yield high gene expression levels yet tend attenuated
in vivo host proinflammatory cytokines. prolonged transgene expression 
obtained using constitutive cellular promoters. however, levels transgene
expression driven cellular promoters insufficient effective therapy.
we designed novel self-augmenting gene expression cassette the
transgene product induce endogenous transcription factor enhance the
activity weak cellular promoter driving expression. using cellular
major histocompatibility complex class (h-2k(b)) promoter drive the
interferon (ifn-gamma) cytokine gene, show h-2k(b) promoter, although
exhibiting much lower basal activity, yields higher ifn-gamma production the
cmv promoter 2 days transfection. ifn-gamma expression driven the
h-2k(b) promoter also lasts longer driven cytomegalovirus
promoter. data demonstrate self-augmenting strategy provides a
promising approach achieve high sustained transgene expression vivo.
