a chimeric tomato golden mosaic virus (tgmv) component dna, results 
replacement coding region viral coat protein gene (cp) the
larger bacterial beta-glucuronidase coding sequence (gus), replicate in
agroinoculated leaf discs unstable systemically infected plants (1). we
have made similar replacements tgmv cp gene gus coding sequence
in sense antisense orientations. derivatives replicated leaf
discs inoculated via agrobacterium. however, systemic movement gus
substituted vectors detected agroinoculated nicotiana benthamiana
plants. tgmv derivatives detected systemically infected leaves of
inoculated plants similar size wild type viral component. sequence
analysis derivatives six independently inoculated plants revealed that
they result internal deletions larger replicons detected in
leaf discs but, instead, generated fusion events occuring within the
original t-dna insert. results indicate systemic movement tgmv in
n. benthamiana plants provides strong selective pressure favoring viral
derivatives similar size wild type virus components.
