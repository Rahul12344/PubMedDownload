until recently uk treatment hcv depended combination regimes 
interferon (ifn) antiviral drug ribavirin. regimes required regular
injections variable duration (generally minimum 12 weeks),
and use ifn often caused unacceptable side effects (thrombocytopenia,
leukopenia depression). common hcv genotypes uk, genotype 1
responded relatively poorly regimes (50-60% viral clearance), most
(80% plus) genotype 3 patients responded sustained viral clearance.
patients severe liver disease (decompensated cirrhosis) tolerated these
regimens poorly often liver function deteriorated. recent
introduction series direct anti-viral agents (daas) offers potential 
to revolutionise treatment, particularly genotype 1 patients with
advanced liver disease, drug regimens avoiding ifn developed, and
can curative in, example, 95% genotype 1 patients. daas are
currently evaluated introduced uk clinical practice. choice of
drug regime, strategies identifying patient groups suitable for
treatment, discussed, prospects eventual complete control of
the hcv epidemic.
