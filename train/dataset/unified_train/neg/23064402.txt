viperin, evolutionarily highly conserved interferon-inducible multifunctional 
protein, previously reported exhibit antiviral activity a
wide range dna rna viruses. utilizing complete nucleotide coding
sequence data fish viperin antiviral genes, employing maximum
likelihood-based codon substitution models, present study reports the
pervasive role positive selection evolution viperin antiviral
protein fishes. overall rate nonsynonymous (dn) synonymous (ds)
substitutions (dn/ds) three functional domains viperin (n-terminal,
central domain c-terminal) 1.1, 0.12, 0.24, respectively.
codon-by-codon substitution analyses revealed the
positively selected sites located n-terminal amphipathic Î±-helix
domain, amino acid residues c-terminal domain positive
selection. however, none sites central domain positive
selection. results indicate that, although viperin evolutionarily highly
conserved, three functional domains experienced differential selection
pressures. taken together results previous studies, present study
suggests persistent antagonistic nature surrounding infectious viral 
pathogens might likely cause adaptive evolutionary changes of
certain amino acids fish viperin antiviral protein.
