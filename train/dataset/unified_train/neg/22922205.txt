the influenza virus respiratory pathogen negative-sense, segmented
rna genome. construction recombinant influenza viruses laboratory was
reported starting 1980s. within short period time, pioneer
researchers devised methods made possible construct influenza
viral vectors cdna plasmid systems. herein, discuss evolution of
influenza virus reverse genetics, helper virus-dependent systems, helper 
virus-independent 17-plasmid systems, way 3- 1- plasmid
systems. successes modification different gene segments various
applications, including vaccine gene therapies highlighted.
