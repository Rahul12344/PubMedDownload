alterations glucose metabolism chick-embryo cells transformed rous
sarcoma virus: intracellular levels glycolytic intermediates.

singh vn, singh m, august jt, horecker bl.

chick-embryo cells, transformed rous sarcoma virus, show enhanced rates of
sugar transport glycolysis. determination intracellular concentrations 
glycolytic intermediates suggests enhanced glycolytic flux due to
increased activities hexokinase (atp:d-hexose 6-phosphotransferase, ec
2.7.1.1), phosphofructokinase, (atp:d-fructose-1-phosphate 6-phosphotransferase, 
ec 2.7.1.56), pyruvate kinase (atp:pyruvate 2-o-phosphotransferase, ec
2.7.1.40), directly increased glucose transport. conclusion
is supported finding intracellular concentration free glucose 
is decreased, rather increased, transformed cells. present
observations suggest increased glycolytic flux related an
increased rate phosphorylation glucose, hexokinase the
transformed cells least partly released normal control mechanism
involving feedback inhibition glucose-6-p.
