the replication type influenza viruses infant rat: marker virus
attenuation.

jennings r, potter cw, teh cz, mahmud mi.

twenty recombinant influenza virus strains bearing hsw1n1, h1n1 h3n2 surface
antigens, together respective wild-type laboratory-propagated
parent viruses, inoculated 2 day-old infant rats replication 
in turbinates lungs animals observed period 5 days. in
addition, ability recombinant parent viruses enhance 
subsequent infection infant rats haemophilus influenzae type b was
determined. results showed parent recombinant viruses
replicated less well lungs turbinates infant rats, 
titres tissues generally lower recombinant strains. the
capacity majority recombinant influenza viruses promote
bacterial infection infant rats, determined incidence h.
influenzae bacteraemia meningitis, also markedly less 
parent viruses. correlation virulence man replication 
in infant rat turbinates ability enhance h. influenzae infection, 
established virus strains studied. data discussed relationship
to value infant r-h influenzae system laboratory marker the
determination virulence influenza virus strains.
