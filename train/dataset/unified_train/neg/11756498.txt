the neurotrophin receptor p75 induce apoptosis vitro vivo. the
mechanisms p75 induces apoptosis remained mostly unknown. here, 
report p75 activates rac gtpase, turn activates c-jun n-terminal
kinase (jnk), including injury-specific jnk3, ngf-dependent manner.
n17rac blocks jnk activation subsequent ngf-dependent apoptosis,
indicating activation rac gtpase required jnk activation and
apoptosis induced p75. addition, p75-mediated rac activation modulated
by coactivation trk, identifying rac gtpase one key molecules whose 
activity critical cell survival death neurotrophin signaling. the
crucial role jnk pathway p75 signaling confirmed the
results blocking p75 signaling via jnk pathway suppressing the
jnk activity led inhibition ngf-dependent death. together, these
results indicate apoptotic machinery p75 comprises rac gtpase and
jnk.
