in october 2011, fatal disease outbreak occurred 3 civet species farmed 
their use coffee industry thailand. disease quickly killed 20
animals mixed population asian palm civets (paradoxurus hermaphroditus; n
= 18), masked palm civet (paguma larvata; n = 1), small indian civet
(viverricula indica; n = 1). clinical signs consisted severe lethargy,
weakness, vomiting, diarrhea associated dehydration, dyspnea, nasal 
footpad hyperkeratosis, seizures. civets positive canine
morbillivirus using commercial canine distemper virus (cdv) antigen test kit.
consistently observed necropsy findings consisted severe pneumonia and
hemorrhagic enteritis. microscopic examination revealed severe gastroenteritis,
bronchointerstitial pneumonia, lymphadenitis, necrotizing dermatitis,
nonsuppurative polioencephalitis, characteristic
intranuclear/intracytoplasmic eosinophilic viral inclusions multiple tissues. 
immunohistochemical analysis revealed immunoreactivity varying intensity,
while virus isolation demonstrated typical cytopathic effects. confirm cdv
infection, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction fusion (f),
phosphoprotein (p), hemagglutinin (h) genes showed bands expected size
using conjunctival swabs (9 civets, 1 dog [canis lupus familiaris] living 
farm). phylogenetic analyses restriction fragment length polymorphism results
indicated civets infected asia-1 strain cdv commonly
found dogs thailand. deduced amino acid sequences signaling
lymphocyte activation molecule binding region cdv-h proteins revealed a
y549h mutation cdv-infected asian palm civets (n = 4) co-located
dog. report canine distemper outbreak civet colony lineage
classification y549h mutation noncanid species thailand.
