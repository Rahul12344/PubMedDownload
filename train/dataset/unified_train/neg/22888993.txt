helix-helix interactions fundamental many biological signals systems
and found homo- heteromultimerization signaling molecules well as
in process virus entry host. hiv, virus-host membrane fusion
during infection mediated formation six-helix bundles (6hbs) from
homotrimers gp41, number synthetic peptides derived 
as antagonists virus entry. using yeast surface two-hybrid (ys2h) system, 
platform designed detect protein-protein interactions occurring a
secretory pathway, reconstituted 6hb complexes yeast surface,
quantitatively measured equilibrium kinetic constants soluble 6hb, and
delineated residues influencing homo-oligomeric hetero-oligomeric
coiled-coil interactions. hence, present ys2h platform facile
characterization design antagonistic peptides inhibition hiv and
many enveloped viruses relying membrane fusion infection, well as
cellular signaling events triggered hetero-oligomeric coiled coils.
