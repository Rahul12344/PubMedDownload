effects bacteriophage m13 infection upon phospholipid fatty acid
compositions escherichia coli.

chattopadhyay pk, dutta j.

escherichia coli k38 grown infected wild type amber mutants 
bacteriophage m13 early log phase. lipid compositions infected 
healthy cultures, grown identical conditions, determined 2 hr after
infection. results, observed total lipid total
phospholipid content remained nearly constant, suggesting cell membrane 
which contained maximum phospholipids damaged infection.
moreover, percentage diphosphatidylglycerol lyso- compounds
corresponding phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylglycerol increased,
while phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylglycerol decreased. increase
in lyso- compounds may due relase phospholipase a2 (a periplasmic
enzyme) cell wall damage infection. bacteriophage m13
infection effect fatty acid compostion phospholipids.
