plaque assays used measure infectious titer viral samples. these
assays multi-day low-throughput may subject analyst variability
from biased subjective manual plaque counting. typically, day 1, cells 
adhered plates overnight. day 2, cells infected virus. 3
additional days, plaques fixed, stained horseradish peroxidase
(hrp)-conjugated antibody hrp substrate, counted eye. manual-based
visual counting plaques time-consuming laborious may subject 
variability analysts. also, assay must proceed several days to
allow plaques increase sufficiently large sizes manual
identification. here, integrate fluorescent detection automated plaque
counting increase sensitivity speed assay. first, stain
plaques fluorescent-labeled antibody. second, implement plate-based
cell imager perform non-biased, non-subjective plaque counting. the
integration two technologies decreases assay length 40%, from
5 days 3 days, plaque size, plaque signal noise, manual
visualization longer limiting. optimized plaque assay sensitive,
fast, robust expands throughput usage method for
measuring plaque formation.
