we shown previously ebna 1 latent membrane protein encoding
regions epstein-barr virus (ebv) genome highly methylated ccgg
sequences burkitt's lymphoma (bl)-derived cell line rael, are
unmethylated lymphoblastoid cell line (lcl) harbouring virus. to
examine whether regular phenomenon, compared methylation
patterns selected regions (bamhi c, w, h, m, e, k n fragments) ebv dna 
in representative ebv-carrying cell types normal neoplastic origin.
analysis hpaii mspi cleavage patterns showed probed regions 
highly methylated six bl biopsy samples, hypomethylated four
lcls immortalized virus. ebv dna also highly methylated nude
mouse-passaged c15 nasopharyngeal carcinoma strain partially methylated in
the c18 strain. eight bl lines propagated vitro, ranging typical bl
group lcl-like group iii phenotype, showed heterogeneous levels of
methylation. rael, stable group cell line, carried highly methylated
viral genomes. cell lines, drifted lcl-like blastic
phenotype various degrees, showed moderate low viral dna methylation. 
two sublines bl cell line jijoye, could classified groups ii
and iii, respectively, showed corresponding difference ebv dna
methylation.(abstract truncated 250 words)
