fgl2 prothrombinase, ability generate thrombin, shown be
pivotal pathogenesis viral-induced hepatitis, cytokine-induced fetal
loss syndrome, xeno- allograft rejection. study, molecular
basis fgl2 prothrombinase activity examined detail. purified fgl2
protein generated baculovirus expression system measurable
prothrombinase activity, whereas activity restored purified
protein reconstituted phosphatidyl-l-serine-containing vesicles.
reconstituted fgl2 catalyzed cleavage human prothrombin thrombin with
kinetics consistent first order reaction, apparent v(max) value of
6 mol/min/mol fgl2 apparent k(m) value prothrombin 8.3 microm. 
catalytic activity totally dependent calcium, factor va (500 nm)
enhanced catalytic efficiency fgl2 increasing apparent v(max) value
to 3670 mol/min/mol fgl2 decreasing apparent k(m) value prothrombin
to 7.2 microm. combination site-directed mutagenesis production of
truncated proteins, clearly shown residue ser(89) critical for
the prothrombinase activity fgl2. furthermore, fgl2 prothrombinase activity
was inhibited antithrombin iii, soybean trypsin inhibitor,
4-aminobenzamidine, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, whereas
diisopropylfluorophosphate completely abrogated activity. work we
provide direct evidence fgl2 cleaves prothrombin thrombin consistent with
serine protease activity requires calcium, phospholipids, factor va for
its full activity.
