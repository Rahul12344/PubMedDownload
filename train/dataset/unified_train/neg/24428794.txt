united states guidelines endorse one-time hcv antibody screening hiv
diagnosis. rescreening hcv-seronegative patients regular basis still 
policy, although hiv-infected persons reasonably substantial hcv incidence. 
we evaluated routine risk factor-independent hcv antibody re-testing rhode
island hiv clinic. instituted annual hcv antibody testing hcv-seronegative
patients rescreened year more. testing based clinical
suspicion continued. conducted chart review new antibody-positive cases
in first year rescreening, july 2006 june 2007. 245 rescreened
patients, 11 (4.5%) seroconverted. five (45%) female. median time between
last negative first positive result 32 months (range 8-98 months). six
(55%) documented risk factors 6 (55%) elevated alt (> 45  iu/l) between
antibody tests; none prompted re-testing. one seroconverter died of
hepatocellular carcinoma 3.7 years hcv diagnosis. twelfth rescreened 
for suspected acute hcv based alt 515  iu/l. newly detectable hcv
rna seroconversion, achieved svr following 6 months treatment 
acute phase genotype 1 infection. incident hcv uncommon among
hiv-infected patients care. rescreening identified undiagnosed hcv this
population. hcv rna checked promptly hcv-seronegative persons with
alt elevation. observed consequences late diagnosis (hepatocellular
carcinoma) benefits early diagnosis (cure treatment acute hcv).
adding annual rescreening ryan white program would facilitate earlier
identification undiagnosed hcv create instant widespread surveillance
system, providing hcv incidence data.
