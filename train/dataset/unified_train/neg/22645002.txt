there increased attentions hev associated diseases recent
years result increased number reports autochthonous patients
from many developed countries. vaccine development better disease management 
are expected protective immunity increased knowledge the
pathogenesis virology hev. review summarizes current
understanding hev virology, key neutralization sites (epitopes) the
surface viral capsid, host humoral immune responses hev infection,
and protective immunity conferred natural infection vaccination.
recombinant vlps prepared mimic protective neutralizing epitopes 
on virion surface, thus capable eliciting protective immunity when
injected nonhuman primates human volunteers preclinical tests and
clinical trials. four markers-viral rna, anti-hev igm, anti-hev igg, low
avidity anti-hev igg-are important diagnosis hev infection,
particularly patients presenting acute hepatitis symptoms. toolbox 
of genomic immunological assays valuable furthering understanding
of time course hev infection subsequent hepatitis during
preclinical clinical development efficacious vaccine. two vaccine
candidates shown good tolerability, high immunogenicity, high efficacy
against symptomatic and/or asymptomatic hev infection. one been
licensed china recently. however, many issues need resolved new
technological progresses benefit people need most.
