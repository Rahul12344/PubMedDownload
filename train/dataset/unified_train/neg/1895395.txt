the derivation characterization neuroattenuated reassortant clone (rfc
25/b.5) california serogroup bunyavirus described previously (m. j.
endres, a. valsamakis, f. gonzalez-scarano, n. nathanson, j. virol.
64:1927-1933, 1990). map rna segment responsible attenuation, a
panel reassortants constructed attenuated clone b.5 (genotype 
tll) virulent clone (b1-1a) reciprocal genotype (ltt). parent viruses
and clones representing six possible reassortants examined for
neurovirulence intracerebral injection adult mice. reassortants bearing the
large rna segment virulent parent almost virulent the
virulent parent virus, reassortants bearing large rna segment 
avirulent parent virus exhibited low intermediate virulence. results
indicate large rna segment major determinant neuroattenuation 
of clone b.5. addition neuroattenuation, clone b.5 temperature
sensitive exhibited altered plaque morphology. phenotypes also
segregated large rna segment. importance large rna segment
(which encodes viral polymerase) neurovirulence contrasts prior
studies indicate ability cause lethal encephalitis after
peripheral injection suckling mice (neuroinvasiveness) primarily determined
by middle-sized rna segment, encodes viral glycoproteins.
