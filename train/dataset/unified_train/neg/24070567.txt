introduction: adenovirus causing severe fatal pneumonia well described
in infants, children, patients immunocompromised function, reports
in previously healthy adults rare. report 3 cases severe adenovirus
pneumonia conventional mechanical ventilation failed required
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support.
methods: retrospective case records review 3 patients admitted medical 
intensive care unit, singapore general hospital, tertiary care
university-affiliated hospital, severe adenovirus pneumonia requiring
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support february march 2013.
results: 3 patients previously healthy immunocompetent adults the
community negative hiv serology. duration prior development of
respiratory failure requiring intubation invasive mechanical ventilation 
2, 8 3 days. veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo) support
as rescue ventilation instituted 3 patients 2, 16, 5 days of
conventional mechanical ventilator support. duration ecmo support 16, 22, 
and 9 days mechanical ventilation 18, 62, 19 days respectively.
length stay intensive care unit 18, 68, 21 days, length stay
in hospital 20, 70, 31 days respectively. two 3 patients died.
conclusion: mainstay treatment patients severe adenovirus
pneumonia still supportive, use antivirals apparently
effective. whilst ecmo support rescue ventilation may considered, the
outcomes appear promising viral pneumonias, mirroring that
previously described paediatric population.
