tpl-2 rat gene encodes serine/threonine protein kinase act
as novel mitogen-activated protein (map) kinase kinase kinase. tpl-2 is
activated moloney murine leukemia virus-induced rat lymphomas, due a
truncation c-terminal region protein. cot closely related
gene, human homologue. truncated form cot shown to
have higher transforming activity nontruncated form. paper 
show increase truncated cot kinase expression correlates an
increase il-2 production anti-cd3-treated jurkat cells. truncated cot
expression also cooperates pha phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (pdbu) and
calcium ionophore il-2 production jurkat cells. truncated and
nontruncated cot forms increased il-2 transcription enhanced
transcription reporter gene linked il-2 promoter. expression a
dominant negative form cot inhibits transcription directed il-2
promoter jurkat cells stimulated pdbu ionophore. data suggest a
role tpl-2/cot kinase il-2 production lymphocyte activation and
could also explain role moloney murine leukemia virus-induced
lymphomagenesis.
