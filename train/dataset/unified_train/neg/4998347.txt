viscerotropic virulence asibi strain yellow fever virus (yfv) for
monkeys known lost serial passage hela cell monolayers.
this phenomenon investigated several mammalian insect tissue
cell lines. assay monkeys original seed virus virus 7 11
passages porcine kidney cell line (pk) indicated essentially equal
infectivity mortality. moreover, monkeys receiving passaged virus
exhibited rapid onset disease death animals infected with
original seed virus. histological changes animals inoculated passaged
virus identical animals receiving seed virus. virus from
later passages pk cells also lethal approximately 50% monkeys; 
however, evidence progressive attenuation seen preparations.
similar results obtained mosquito (aedes aegypti) cell line. in
contrast results obtained pk mosquito cells, yfv became essentially
avirulent (nonlethal less infective) monkeys seven passages in
hela cell cultures.
