we report investigation much protein structural information could be
obtained using site-directed fluorescence labeling (sdfl) strategy. our
experiments, used 21 consecutive single-cysteine substitution mutants t4
lysozyme (residues t115-k135), located helix-turn-helix motif. mutants
were labeled fluorescent probe monobromobimane subjected array
of fluorescence measurements. thermal stability measurements show that
introduction label substantially perturbing located 
buried residue sites. buried sites (solvent surface accessibility <40
a(2)), destabilizations 3 5.5 kcal/mol, whereas more
exposed sites, deltadeltag values < = 1.5 kcal/mol obtained. the
fluorescence parameters explored (excitation lambda(max), emission
lambda(max), fluorescence lifetime, quantum yield, steady-state anisotropy), 
the emission lambda(max) steady-state anisotropy values accurately
reflect solvent surface accessibility site calculated the
crystal structure cysteine-less t4 lysozyme. parameters identify allow 
the classification site buried, partially buried, exposed. find 
that variations parameters function residue number reflect
the sequence-specific secondary structure, determination key
step modeling protein unknown structure.
