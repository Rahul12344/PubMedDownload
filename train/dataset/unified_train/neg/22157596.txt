maraviroc (mvc) first licensed antiretroviral drug class of
coreceptor antagonists. binds host coreceptor ccr5, used by
the majority hiv strains order infect human immune cells (fig. 1).
other hiv isolates use different coreceptor, cxcr4. receptor used,
is determined virus env protein (fig. 2). depending the
coreceptor used, viruses classified r5 x4, respectively. mvc binds 
to ccr5 receptor inhibiting entry r5 viruses target cell.
during course disease, x4 viruses may emerge outgrow r5 viruses.

is rather low outside u.s.a., since european physicians rather tend to
work decentralized expert laboratories, also provide concomitant
resistance testing. laboratories undergone several quality assurance
evaluations, last one presented 2011. several years now, have
performed tropism determinations based sequence analysis hiv env-v3
gene region (v3). region carries enough information perform reliable
prediction. genotypic determination coreceptor usage presents advantages
such as: shorter turnover time (equivalent resistance testing), lower costs,
possibility adapt results patients' needs possibility of
analysing clinical samples low even undetectable viral load (vl),
particularly since number samples analysed vl < 1000 copies/μl
