this study carried aim developing production process for
the manufacture highly purified factor viii concentrate virus
inactivated pasteurization liquid phase. beside standard plasma protein
separation techniques, procedure uses chromatographic step anion
exchanger, whose selectivity increased using high, destabilizing
salt concentrations. final product stabilization specific
activity higher 300 iu/mg protein, namely highest specific activity
reported human factor viii concentrates purified without use of
immunoadsorbents.
