effects transformation rous sarcoma virus sugar uptake activity 
the subcellular distribution hexokinase isozymes chick embryo fibroblasts
were examined. transformation caused several-fold increase maximum
velocity uptake 2-deoxyglucose without significant change km.
cytochalasin b (cb), used differentiate effects of
transformation facilitated diffusion nonsaturable (cb-insensitive)
mode. transformation found stimulate 2-deoxyglucose transport both
mechanisms, increase transport cb-insensitive mode greater.
transformation enhances activity hexokinase, enhancement being
confined particulate fraction enzyme. heat-inactivation and
electrophoretic mobility studies showed although hexokinase type the
major form normal transformed fibroblasts, significant
increase proportion type ii isozyme transformed cells.
