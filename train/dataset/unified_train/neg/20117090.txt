we developed continuous fluorescence assay based fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (fret) monitoring rna helicase activity vitro. 
assay tested using hepatitis c virus (hcv) ns3 helicase model. we
prepared double-stranded rna (dsrna) substrate 5' fluorophore-labeled
strand hybridized 3' quencher-labeled strand. dsrna unwound by
helicase, fluorescence fluorophore emitted following separation
of strands. unlike conventional gel-based assays, new assay
eliminates complex time-consuming steps, used simply
measure real-time kinetics single helicase reaction. results
demonstrate alexa fluor 488 bhq1 effective fluorophore-quencher
pair, assay suitable quantitative measurement rna
helicase activity hcv ns3. moreover, found several extracts marine 
organisms exhibited different inhibitory effects rna dna helicase
activities hcv ns3. propose assay useful monitoring
the detailed kinetics rna unwinding mechanisms screening rna helicase
inhibitors high throughput.
