background/aims: recent studies shown genotype hepatitis b virus
(hbv) may correlate disease natural history treatment outcome.
however, several studies used low sensitivity assays small number
of patients, precluded accurate evaluation korean hbv
genotypes. analyzed korean hbv genotypes large population employing 
new technology, restriction fragment mass polymorphism (rfmp) using maldi-tof
mass spectrometry, sensitive specific manner.
methods: february 1995 december 2003, total 475 patients with
chronic hbv infection enrolled. assay based mass measurement
of oligonucleotides genotypic variations gene. clinical features 
including virologic status disease progression also evaluated.
results: median age total patients 35.5 years. 475
patients, 162 (34.1%) inactive carriers, 172 (36.2%) chronic
hepatitis, 77 (16.2%) liver cirrhosis 64 (13.5%) hepatocellular
carcinoma (hcc). 454 patients (95.6%) genotype c, 4 patients
(0.8%) genotype a, 16 patients (3.4%) mixed c genotype [7
patients (1.4%) a<c versus 9 patients (2.0%) c>a], 1 patient (0.2%)
with b genotype. comparing genotype c, genotype patients all
inactive carriers without hcc, whereas genotype c patients included with
chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis hcc.
conclusions: hbv genotype c highly prevalent korea. although small 
percentage, genotype also exists seems take benign clinical
course genotype c. studies necessitated assess the
relationship hbv genotypes various aspects diseases'
clinical course.
