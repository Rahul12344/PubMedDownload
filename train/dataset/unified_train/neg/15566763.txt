background: diagnosis respiratory infections detecting viral antigens
has received considerable attention using immunofluorescent assays (ifa) and
enzyme immunoassays (eia). time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (tr-fia) been
developed several viruses.
objectives: prepare monoclonal antibodies coronavirus strains, to
incorporate tr-fia, test assay clinical specimens.
study design: monoclonal antibodies prepared n nucleoprotein the
two human respiratory coronaviruses, hcv strains 229e oc43. monoclonals to
both viruses completely type-specific; cross-react between
themselves multiple strains respiratory viruses. these
antibodies configured optimized eia tr-fia tests. the
all-monoclonal tests compared polyclonal eia tests terms their
ability detect virus clinical specimens.
results: all-monoclonal tr-fia uniformly sensitive, detecting
virus 13 229e-positive specimens compared 69% monoclonal eia
and 54% polyclonal eia test. similar results obtained 10
oc43-positive specimens: 100% tr-fia, 90% monoclonal eia, 80% in
polyclonal eia. 229e tr-fia, mean positive/negative (p/n) ratios 143 
for 229e-positive human embryonic lung fibroblast (hlf) cell culture fluids and
10 positive nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens; oc43 tr-fia, mean p/n
values 964 oc43-positive rhabdomyosarcoma (rd) cell culture fluids and
174 positive npa specimens. sensitivities tr-fia determined
with purified virions 0.308 ng virus per well hcv-229e 0.098 ng
virus per well hcv-oc43.
conclusions: rapid sensitive test appears much sensitive than
traditional antigen detection assays require extensive field
testing clinical specimens.
