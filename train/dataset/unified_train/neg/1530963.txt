we investigated possible involvement oxidative mechanisms the
pathogenesis influenza a/pr8/34 virus infection mice. biochemical
marker oxidative stress, determined endogenous concentrations the
antioxidants glutathione vitamins c e reduced oxidized forms
in lungs, liver blood plasma control infected animals. following
intranasal infection 8 10 ld50, influenza virus detected the
lungs, plasma, liver organs. infection resulted a
decrease total concentration glutathione vitamins c e, whereas 
no relevant change ratio oxidized total concentration of
antioxidants observed. changes concentration hepatic antioxidants
were significant early stages infection. results suggest that
hepatic alterations may caused indirectly mechanisms related host
response virus infection. observed general decrease antioxidant
buffering capacity may reduce ability tissues protect potential
oxidative stress. stress occur bacterial superinfections, which
are common influenza, thereby rendering host susceptible the
pathogenic effects agents. addition, reactive oxygen species produced 
in lung may inactivate protease inhibitors, resulting increased protease
activity. using vitro system consisting alpha 1-antiprotease, trypsin
and hocl oxidant, shown infectivity influenza viruses 
can increased 10,000-fold proteolytic cleavage haemagglutinin,
leading activation fusogenic properties protein.
