the loss cochlear hair cells, loss capacity transduce
acoustic signals, believed underlying mechanism many forms of
hearing loss. develop viral vectors allow introduction genes
directly cochleae adult animals, replication-deficient (e1(-), e3(-))
and replication-defective (e1(-), e3(-), pol(-)) adenovirus vectors used 
transduce bacterial beta-galactosidase gene hair cells guinea
pig cochlea vivo. distortion product otoacoustic emissions, monitor 
functional status outer hair cells, measured throughout viral
infection periods identify hair cell ototoxicity. results demonstrated
that use (e1(-), e3(-)) adenovirus vectors containing cmv-driven lacz,
compromised cochlear function gradually introduced scala tympani via an
osmotic pump. however, (e1(-), e3(-), pol(-)) adenoviral vectors containing 
cmv-driven lacz used transduce cochlear hair cells, loss 
cochlear function frequency regions tested, beta-galactosidase
(beta-gal) detected 80% hair cells. development viral
vector infects cochlear hair cells without virus-induced ototoxic effects is
crucial gene replacement strategies treat certain forms inherited
deafness otoprotective strategies prevent hair cell losses treat
progressive hearing disorders. moreover, vivo (e1(-), e3(-), pol(-))
adenovirus mediated gene-transfer techniques applied adult guinea pig cochleae
may useful testing several hypotheses concerning roles specific genes 
play normal cochlear function.
