reexamination association melting point, buoyant density, and
chemical base composition deoxyribonucleic acid.

de ley j.

the equations currently used calculation chemical base composition
of deoxyribonucleic acid (dna), expressed moles per cent guanine plus cytosine
(% gc), either buoyant density (rho) midpoint thermal denaturation
(t(m)) recalculated using sets data dna determined the
same strains. available information literature screened and
supplemented unpublished data. results calculated regression and
correlation analysis treated statistically. data 96 strains of
bacteria, calculated that% gc = 2.44 (t(m) - 69.4). t(m) appears be
unaffected substitution cytosine hydroxymethylcytosine. this
equation also valid nonbacterial dna. data 84 strains of
bacteria, relation% gc = 1038.47 (-1.6616) calculated. constants in
this equation slightly modified data nonbacterial dna included.
both correlations differ slightly currently used, they
lean statistically sound basis. control, relation rho and
t(m) calculated data 197 strains; agrees excellently the
above two equations.
