using technique situ hybridisation, extended initial studies 
the occurrence canine distemper measles virus paget's disease. bone
samples untreated patients patients treated with
3-amino-hydroxypropylidene 1,1 bisphosphonate pamidronate (apd) examined for
canine distemper nucleocapsid (cdv-n), measles nucleocapsid (mv-n), respiratory
syncytial virus fusion (rsv-f), simian virus 5 haemoglutinin-neuraminidase
(sv5-hn) sequences using 35s-labelled sense antisense riboprobes. cdv-n 
mrna detected osteoclasts, osteoblasts, mononuclear cells. in
untreated paget's patients, 63.5% found cdv sequences residing in
bone cells, 48.2% undergoing apd treatment still found 
the viral sequences. rsv-f mrna found one patient. none 
paramyxoviruses tested detected. study shows cdv infect a
human host may aetiological agent paget's disease bone.
