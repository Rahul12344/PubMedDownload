sex reported influence rates viral clearance hepatitis c
virus (hcv)-infected patients. however, little known regarding influence
of sex host genetic response hcv, mediated expression
of interferon (ifn)-stimulated genes (isgs) activation janus kinase 
(jak)/signal transducer activator transcription (stat) pathway ifn.
thus, investigated gender differences mxa genetic profile, a
downstream reliable marker jak/stat pathway activation. all, 40 untreated 
hcv-infected patients subclassified premenopausal, postmenopausal, 
male patients. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) premenopausal 
women showed highest mxa gene expression compared postmenopausal
females males ifn stimulation. prestimulation pbmcs
with 17beta-estradiol prior ifn treatment resulted decrease mxa
expression groups patients. confirmed reversal 
effect using estrogen antagonist ici182/780. study demonstrates the
first time presence gender variations genetic response chronic
hcv infection interferon treatment. also clarifies estrogen not
the key player enhancing jak/stat pathway.
