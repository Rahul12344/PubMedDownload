background: need systematic reviews meta-analyses to
synthesize epidemiology, riskfactors hepatitis c virus (hcv)
among hiv-coinfected hiv negative men sex men (msm).
methods: meta-analysis 28 studies carried pooling hcv incidence
data hiv-coinfected hiv negative msm. differences incidence outcome
depending prospective retrospective nature individual studies
were investigated.
results: pooled incidence hcv msm 6.3 per 1000 person-years (95% ci
5.0-7.5). overall estimated incidence 19-fold higher hiv positive
compared hiv negative msm living resource-rich countries. result was
confirmed analysis restricted high-quality studies. factors
associated increased risk incident hcv included behavioural factors
(sexual risk behaviour recreational drug use) well biological
characteristics (hiv coinfection recent history syphilis).
conclusion: conclusion, incident hcv predominantly affects hiv positive msm.
the incidence rate varied largely studies, factors study design
might play important role.
