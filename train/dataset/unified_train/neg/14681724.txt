adenoviral gene expression repressed p53 nontransformed cells could
provide tumor-specific gene therapy approach large subset tumors.
adenoviral infection vivo induces stabilization p53, utilized 
for strategy includes p53-dependent expression transcriptional
repressor target promoter,which highly susceptible transcriptional
repression. therefore, constructed different versions cmv-promoters
(cmvgal) binding sites gal4-dbd investigated 11 gal4-dbd fusion
proteins elucidate effective repressor domain silence cmvgal
activity. transcriptional repressor gal4-krab-a control a
p53-dependent promoter facilitates strong cmvgal-mediated gene expression
specifically p53 mutant cells double-recombinant adenoviral vector
(ad-rgcdr). gal4-krab-a mediates strong transcriptional repression ad-rgcdr in
p53 wild-type cells, could enhanced preactivation of
p53-signalling following low-dose chemotherapy prior adenoviral infection. 
utilizing p53 signalling involved chemotherapy adenoviral infection, 
than 99% ad-rgcdr gene expression could repressed p53 wild-type cells.
controlled gene expression cmvgal promoters transcriptional repression
utilizing functional p53 signalling thus provides effective tool for
tumor-specific adenoviral gene therapy.
