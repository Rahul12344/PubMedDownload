a simple, nondestructive pcr-based screening method developed for
identifying putative transgenic soft white winter wheat (triticum aestivum l.)
carrying coat protein gene wheat streak mosaic virus. removal the
endosperm end individual seed provided sufficient material dna extraction 
and pcr. dna seed free secondary, metabolites found leaf
tissue inhibit pcr restriction digests required southern
analysis. half-seed pcr assay comparable accuracy leaf-tissue pcr 
assay hence used accurate rapid method identifying
transformed lines planting. germination remaining seed portion
showed germination rates comparable whole-seed controls. slight delay in
growth first-leaf first-tiller stage observed the
half-seed-derived plants, compared plants grown whole seed.
