il-12 inducer type 1 cell responses, essential host
defense herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) infection. however, type 1 
cell responses elicited il-12 thermally injured mice (ti-mice) that
routinely predominance burn-associated type 2 cell responses. 
previous studies, benzoylmesaconine (ben, aconitine derivative extracted 
heated-aconiti tuber) induced generation cd4+ cells antagonistic type
2 cells (ben-cd4+ cells). present study, effects combination 
therapy using il-12 ben treat severe hsv-1 infection ti-mice were
investigated. ti-mice treated either il-12 (500 u per mouse) or
ben (1 microg/kg) alone, resist hsv-1 infection. however, 60-80% 
ti-mice exposed hsv-1 survived received il-12 ben ben-cd4+ t
cells combination. stimulation anti-cd3 mab vitro, ifn- 
produced cultures splenic cells ti-mice exposed hsv-1 treated
with either il-12, ben ben-cd4+ cell alone. however, ifn- production was
induced mab stimulation cultures cells infected mice
treated il-12 ben ben-cd4+ cells combination. results
suggest combination therapy il-12 (an inducer type 1 cell
responses) ben (an inhibitor type 2 cell responses) may protect ti-mice 
from severe hsv-1 infection.
