objective: identify risk factors residual lesion hysterectomy
specimens loop electrosurgical excision procedure (leep) cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia (cin).
methods results: retrospectively analyzed clinical data 594
patients underwent total hysterectomy leep cin international
peace maternity child health hospital affiliated shanghai jiaotong
university july 2006 june 2015. among 594 patients, no
residual lesions uterine specimens 409 (68.9%) patients; residual cin1 
found 24 (4%) patients, cin2 cin3 142 (23.9%) patients, cervical
cancer 19 (3.2%) patients. univariate analysis age, menopausal status,
margin involvement, lesion grade, abnormal endocervical curettage (ecc) result,
and persistent human papillomavirus (hpv) infection post operation were
significantly associated residual lesions leep (p < 0.05).
multivariate regression analysis using logistic regression model showed
abnormal ecc result persistent hpv positivity independent risk factors 
for residual lesions leep. leep positive margins persistent hpv
infection also associated high risk invasive cervical cancer in
cin2+ patients.
conclusions: abnormal ecc result post-treatment hpv infection predictors 
of residual lesion leep. combination, could useful risk
stratification selection management approach. postmenopausal cin2+
patients positive margins persistent postoperative hpv infection may
have high risk cervical invasive cancer.
