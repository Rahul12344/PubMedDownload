administration protease inhibitors, epsilon-aminocaproic acid or
aprotinins, mice infected mouse-adapted influenza virus strain a/pr/8/34 
(hon1) a/aichi/2/68 (h3n2) reduced virus replication lungs. to
100-fold reduction virus titre virus-induced neuraminidase activity were
revealed mouse lungs protease inhibitor treatment. result,
drug-treated mice rapidly cleared virus lungs. predominant
synthesis non-infectious virions uncleaved haemagglutinin the
lungs drug-treated mice, contrast production highly infectious
virions proteolytically cleaved haemagglutinin untreated mice. these
observations suggest protease inhibitors suppress influenza virus
replication mouse lungs due prevention haemagglutinin cleavage virus
proteolytic activation.
