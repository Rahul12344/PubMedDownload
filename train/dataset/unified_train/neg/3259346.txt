immunocompetent adult mice mount vigorous cytotoxic lymphocyte (ctl) response
against armstrong (arm) 53b strain lcmv primary inoculation. in
contrast, clone 13 variant arm 53b, originally isolated spleen of
a persistently infected mouse, suppresses lcmv-specific ctl responses (r. ahmed
et al. (1984) j. exp med 60, 521). induction generation ctl maps to
the short (s) rna segment long (l) rna segment lcmv (y. riviere et
al. (1986) j. immunol. 136, 304). ctl recognition epitope, expressed in
virus-infected target cells, also maps segment lcmv arm genome,
and structurally functionally intact clone 13-infected target cells.
here report rna sequences arm 53b variant clone 13.
comparison reveals single amino acid difference. however, sequence divergence
at position also occurs among strains lcmv (pasteur, traub, we)
which elicit ctl responses. hence, (1) amino acid difference unrelated 
to phenotypic divergence clone 13, (2) suppression ctl response 
clone 13 linked ctl recognition epitope, (3) structure or
function responsible ctl immunosuppression clone 13 likely maps to
the l rna segment. further, availability complete rna sequence for
lcmv arm arm clone 13 variant allows detailed comparison (v.
romanowski et al. (1985) virus res. 3, 110-114), lcmv rna far
sequenced.
