the records 96 pediatric patients aplastic anemia malignancy who
underwent bone marrow transplantation 1979 1986 children's
hospital philadelphia reviewed laboratory evidence viral
infections. common viral diseases identified herpes simplex virus
(hsv), cytomegalovirus adenoviruses, found 19 (20%), 17 (18)
and 17 (18) patients, respectively. hsv common patients than
without graft vs. host disease (gvhd) (9 30; 30% vs. 10 66; 15%), the
difference reach statistical significance. late prolonged isolation of
hsv occurred patients chronic gvhd. cytomegalovirus significantly
more common patients without gvhd (10 30; 33% vs. 7 66; 11%). 
the presence pretransplant antibody cytomegalovirus hsv good
predictor subsequent infection. adenoviruses isolated 3 patients
with burkitt's lymphoma. adenovirus type 12, serotype uncommon man known
to highly tumorigenic young hamsters, recovered 4 patients.
adenoviruses notably common patients gvhd (6 30; 20% vs.
