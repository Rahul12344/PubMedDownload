background: conserved neutralizing epitopes considered key role for
eliciting broadly neutralizing antibody (nab). previously, two conserved
neutralizing epitopes hiv-1 crf01_ae envelope identified amino acid
93-112 c1 (c1e) 218-239 c2 (c2e) regions. access the
potency antibody directed conserved epitopes, monoclonal antibody
(mab) specific c2e region developed characterized.
methods: immunogenicity two epitopes examined immunizing balb/c
mice matching synthetic peptides. one mab, c2eb5, directed against
peptide c2e, generated conventional methods, c1e1 c1e2 peptides 
induced slight antibody response mice. neutralizing activity mab c2eb5 
was examined using peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) based method and
various hiv-1 subtypes including a, b, c, d, crf01_ae; c2eb5 compared
with known neutralizing mabs (4e10, 447-52d) scd4. exposure of
the c2 epitope native virus investigated using virus capture these
mabs.
results: mab c2eb5 demonstrated cross-neutralization various hiv-1
subtypes. overall potency mab c2eb5 5 subtypes ranked the
following order: subtype c> crf01_ae> subtype d> subtype a> subtype b. the
epitope exposure mab c2eb5 also correlated neutralization
properties subtype.
conclusion: study demonstrates cross-clade neutralizing activity a
mab directed epitope located c2 region hiv-1 env and
highlights differences exposure antigenic epitopes surface of
various hiv-1 subtypes. epitope newly identified neutralizing mab
made subtype crf01_ae peptide particularly exposed subtype c
viral isolates.
