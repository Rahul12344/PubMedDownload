background: vaccinating infants first dose measles-containing vaccine
(mcv1) 9 months age high-risk settings potential reduce
measles-related morbidity mortality. however, concern early
vaccination might blunt immune response subsequent measles vaccine doses. 
we systematically reviewed available evidence effect mcv1
administration infants younger 9 months immune responses to
subsequent mcv doses.
methods: systematic review meta-analysis, searched randomised
and quasi-randomised controlled trials, outbreak investigations, cohort and
case-control studies without restriction publication dates, mcv1 
administered infants younger 9 months. literature search on
june 2, 2015, updated jan 14, 2019. included studies reporting data 
on strength duration humoral cellular immune responses, vaccine 
efficacy vaccine effectiveness two-dose three-dose mcv schedules. our
outcome measures proportion seropositive infants, geometric mean titre,
vaccine efficacy, vaccine effectiveness, antibody avidity index, t-cell
stimulation index. used random-effects meta-analysis derive pooled
estimates outcomes, appropriate. assessed methodological
quality included studies using grading recommendation assessment,
development evaluation (grade) guidelines.
findings: search retrieved 1156 records 85 excluded due to
duplication. 1071 records screened eligibility, 351 were
eligible full-text screening 21 eligible inclusion the
review. 13 studies, pooled proportion infants seropositive two 
mcv doses, mcv1 administered 9 months age, 98% (95% ci 96-99; 
i2=79·8%, p<0·0001), significantly different seropositivity
after two-dose mcv schedule starting later (p=0·087). one four studies 
found geometric mean titres mcv2 administration significantly lower
when mcv1 administered 9 months age 9 months age or
later. insufficient evidence determine effect age mcv1
administration antibody avidity. pooled vaccine effectiveness estimate
derived two studies two-dose mcv schedule mcv1 vaccination 
9 months age 95% (95% ci 89-100; i2=12·6%, p=0·29). seven studies
reporting measles virus-specific cellular immune responses found t-cell
responses t-cell memory sustained, irrespective age mcv1
administration. overall, quality evidence moderate low.
interpretation: findings suggest administering mcv1 infants younger
than 9 months followed additional mcv doses results high seropositivity,
vaccine effectiveness, t-cell responses, independent age 
mcv1, supporting vaccination young infants high-risk settings.
however, also found evidence mcv1 administered infants younger
than 9 months resulted lower antibody titres one two subsequent doses
of mcv measles vaccination started age 9 months older. the
clinical public-health relevance immunity blunting effect are
uncertain.
