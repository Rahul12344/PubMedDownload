lentiviral based constructs represent recent development generation of
transgenic animals. ease use, fact backbone vectors 
can used down-modulate endogenous gene expression produce transgenic
animals overexpressing gene interest, fuelled growing interest 
technology. study, used lentiviral delivery system generate 
transgenic mice expressing altered levels (up downregulated) gene of
interest. although lentiviral-based approach led high levels of
transgenesis germ line transmission, wide variation transgene expression
was observed first second generation mouse lines. particular,
despite segregation integrants single-copy expressing mouse lines,
transgene expression appeared target epigenetic regulatory
mechanism, often causing coexistence high low transgene expressing
cells within given tissue blood peripheral lymphocytes. the
establishment analysis large number mouse lines may therefore be
required select stable transgenic line pancellular expression gene
of interest using lentiviral-based approach.
