anal squamous cell carcinoma precursor lesions increasing in
incidence united states europe. trend predates human
immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome been
associated persistent high-risk human papilloma virus (hpv) genotype
infection, previous lower genital tract dysplasia/carcinoma, high frequency
anoreceptive intercourse, heavy cigarette smoking, immunosuppression solid
organ transplant immune disorders, human immunodeficiency virus
seropositivity. screening protocols at-risk patients active
investigation pathologists often asked assess anal canal perianal 
biopsies presence dysplasia and/or invasive carcinoma. because
underdiagnosis overdiagnosis anal cancer precancer may lead to
inappropriate treatment, important pathologist aware of
current screening strategies, specific risk lesions, role pathology in
initial diagnosis evaluation anal biopsy and/or resection specimens.
standardized histologic criteria uniform terminology used for
reporting anal canal perianal squamous intraepithelial lesions. hpv
subtyping, anal cytology, recently identified biomarkers, p16 and
becton dickinson proex c may provide additional information problematic cases,
but important aware limitations assays. hpv 
linked major histologic subtypes anal carcinoma (eg, basaloid,
cloacogenic, transitional, etc.) association strongest anal canal
lesions. possible exception microcystic pattern, histologic
subtype seem predict prognosis; anal squamous cell carcinomas
should classified either keratinizing nonkeratinizing. poorly
differentiated squamous cell carcinomas worse prognosis be
distinguished poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, melanoma, and
neuroendocrine tumors. well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with
pushing margins (so-called giant condyloma buschke lowenstein) be
classified verrucous carcinoma; tumor shows aggressive local infiltration
but metastasize. anal condylomata may harbor foci high-grade
dysplasia invasive carcinoma, careful sectioning complete histologic
examination required.
