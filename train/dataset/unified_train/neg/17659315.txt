mass spectrometry analysis ebola virus soluble glycoprotein sgp identified
a rare post-translation modification, c-mannosylation, found on
tryptophan (w) 288. modification described viral 
protein; however, many viral transmembrane glycoproteins contain one of
the recognition motifs (w-x-x-w). elimination c-mannose sgp not
significantly alter protein biosynthesis, processing structure. furthermore,
the protective effect sgp endothelial barrier function, currently 
known activity sgp, unaltered. possible c-mannosylation may 
a common post-translational modification viral transmembrane glycoproteins
where could play role particle maturation and/or entry stabilizing the
structure proteins. regard, c-mannosylation sgp may an
anomaly resulting unique manner protein generated as
the product unedited transcripts glycoprotein gene ebola.
