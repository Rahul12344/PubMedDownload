the objective present study investigate association between
human t-lymphotropic virus type-1 (htlv-1) infection cancer risk a
longitudinal study. study population consisted 2729 atomic bomb survivors 
in nagasaki prefecture, japan, previous history cancer baseline.
the baseline survey, including analysis antibody htlv-1, took place 
1985-1987 follow-up performed end 2001. 553
incident cases malignant neoplasms observation period. after
adjustment sex, age variables, htlv-1 infection associated 
with risk developing cancers sites, excluding adult t-cell leukemia
(rate ratio 1.0, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.76-1.4), stomach, colon and
rectum, lung, female breast minor sites, associated with
increased risk liver cancer (rate ratio 2.1, 95%ci 1.0-4.6). point
estimate rate ratio thyroid cancer 3.0, not
significantly higher 1 small number events (n = 11) and
low prevalence htlv-1 seropositivity. findings support idea that
htlv-1 infection associated increased general cancer risk.
confounding hepatitis c virus (hcv) interaction htlv-1 hcv
may explain increased risk liver cancer among htlv-1 carriers. further
follow-up may required determine htlv-1 carriers increased risk
of thyroid cancer.
