model systems study restricted primate retrovirus expression established 
by de novo infection canine foetal thymus cells (cf-2th) superinfection of
hel-12 cells hel-12 virus. resulting cf-2th/hel-12v cells and
hel-12/hel-12v cells, four sequential stages virus infection defined by
the production reverse transcriptase (rt)-containing particles expression 
of virus antigens detected radioimmunoassays. stage 1 cells not
synthesize virus antigens produce rt-containing particles. stage 2 cells
synthesized virus antigen rt-containing particles. stage 3 cells
synthesized antigen produced rt-containing particles, stage 4 cells
synthesized virus antigens longer produced rt-containing particles. the
duration four stage infection 2 3 weeks cell types.
monospecific competition radioimmunoassays detect hel-12v p30 gp70 antigen 
showed high levels virus antigen throughout stages 2 4 infection.
analysis immunoprecipitates formed conditions detect either p30- or
or gp70-containing proteins cells pulsed pulsed--chased [3h]leucine
showed spectrum virus precursor polyproteins, intermediates and
mature virion components stage 2 4 cells canine human infections.
spent culture fluids collected stage 3 stage 4 cf-2th/hel-12v cells
failed reveal inhibitors rt activity. stage 4 cf-2th/hel-12v or
hel-12/hel-12v cells labelled [3h]uridine produced virions which
incorporated [3h]uridine rt activity, suggesting restricted
infection characterized production hel-12v defective rt activity.
