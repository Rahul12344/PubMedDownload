monoclonal antibodies ipo-1--ipo-8 surface antigens b-lymphoblastoid
cell line rpmi-1788 prepared. murine hybridomas obtained fusion of
immune spleen cells myeloma cells. screening specific antibody production 
was carried indirect immunofluorescence. expression antibodies
against panel 11 human cell lines carried indirect
immunofluorescence. expression antigens detected ipo-1--ipo-8 were
investigated peripheral blood cells healthy individuals patients with
cll, all, myeloma lymph node cells patients hodgkin's disease.
specificity moabs discussed. ipo-5 shown react the
hla-related determinant. antibody ipo-3 appears recognize a
differentiation antigen human b cells.
