human monoclonal antibodies: methods production aspects their
application oncology.

olsson l.

the currently available methods production human monoclonal antibodies
(mabs) are: mouse-human hybrids, human-human hybrids, ebv transformation, and
fusion ebv-transformed specific b-lymphocytes malignant cell line. each
method advantages drawbacks, inferior optimal 
functioning mouse hybridoma system. significant obstacle lack a
reproducible method obtain high amounts antigen-specific b-lymphocytes.
however, seems newly developed vitro antigen-priming methods may 
significant aid solution problem. human mabs already been
obtained types human cancer, reactivity pattern has
provided biological information seems obtainable with
non-human mabs. furthermore seems technology production human 
mabs progressed stage permits realistic hope 
soon applied diagnosis treatment human cancer.
