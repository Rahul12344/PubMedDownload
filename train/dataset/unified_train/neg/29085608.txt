bovine ephemeral fever acute arthropod-borne viral disease cattle
and water buffalo occurs seasonally world tropical and
subtropical regions. epizootic feature disease reported in
iran serious economic consequences. surface glycoprotein g bovine
ephemeral fever virus (befv) composed 4 antigenic sites (g1-g4) plays
the main role eliciting neutralizing antibodies protective immunity. 
g1 - epitope linear antigenic site conserved among befv strains. in
order develop elisa test based g1-epitope coating antigen, study
was carried express recombinant g1-epitope befv prokaryotic
system. using pcr specific primers, length 88 amino acid g
glycoprotein befv including g1- epitope amplified cloned the
expression vector pgex-4t-1, gst moiety. recombinant plasmid
(pgex-4t-1-g1) transformed escherichia coli bl21 expression 
fusion protein induced 0.10 mm iptg. maximum expression fusion 
protein obtained 16 hr post induction verified sds-page
electrophoresis, also confirmed protein bearing g1- epitope 
is sufficiently biologically active bind anti-befv serum western blot
experiment.
