a single real-time multiplex reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (rt-qpcr) assay simultaneous detection citrus tristeza virus 
(ctv), citrus psorosis virus (cpsv), citrus leaf blotch virus (clbv) was
developed validated using three different fluorescently labeled minor groove 
binding qpcr probes. increase detection reliability, coat protein (cp)
genes large number different isolates ctv, cpsv clbv were
sequenced multiple sequence alignment generated corresponding cp
sequences genbank robust multiplex rt-qpcr assay designed. the
capacity multiplex rt-qpcr assay detecting viruses compared 
singleplex rt-qpcr designed specifically virus assessed using
multiple virus isolates diverse geographical regions citrus species as
well graft-inoculated citrus plants infected various combination the
three viruses. significant difference detection limits found and
specificity affected inclusion three assays multiplex 
rt-qpcr reaction. comparison viral load virus using singleplex
and multiplex rt-qpcr assays, revealed significant differences two
assays virus detection. significant difference cq values detected
when using one-step two-step multiplex rt-qpcr detection formats. optimizing 
the rna extraction technique citrus tissues testing quality the
extracted rna using rt-qpcr targeting cytochrome oxidase citrus gene an
rna specific internal control proved generate better diagnostic assays.
results showed developed multiplex rt-qpcr streamline viruses
testing citrus nursery stock replacing three separate singleplex assays,
thus reducing time labor retaining sensitivity and
specificity. three targeted rna viruses regulated pathogens for
california's mandatory "section 3701: citrus nursery stock pest cleanliness
program". adopting compatible multiplex rt-qpcr testing protocol these
viruses well rna dna regulated pathogens provide valuable 
alternative tool virus detection efficient program implementation.
