background: gene transfer malignant sites using human adenoviruses (hads) 
been limited immunogenic nature host specificity. murine
cells often lack receptors needed hads attachment, thus murine
cells generally non-permissive human adenoviral infection and
replication, limits translational studies.
methods: developed gene transfer method uses combination of
lipid-encapsulated perfluorocarbon microbubbles ultrasound protect and
deliver hads target tissue, bypassing requirement specific receptors.
results: vitro model, showed murine tramp-c2 human du145
prostate cancer cells display comparable expression pattern receptors
involved hads adhesion internalization. also demonstrated murine
and human cells showed dose-dependent increase percentage cells
transduced had-gfp (green fluorescent protein) 24 h gfp
transgene efficiently expressed 48 72 h post-transduction. assess
if image-guided delivery system could effectively protect hads the
immune system vivo, injected healthy immunocompetent mice (c57bl/6) mice
bearing syngeneic prostate tumor (tramp-c2) had-gfp/mb complexes. notably,
we observe activation innate (tnf-α il-6 cytokines), adaptive
immune response (neutralizing antibodies, inf-γ+ cd8+ cells).
conclusions: study brings us step closer demonstrating feasibility 
of murine cancer models investigate clinical translation image guided
site-specific adenoviral gene therapy mediated ultrasound-targeted microbubble
destruction.
