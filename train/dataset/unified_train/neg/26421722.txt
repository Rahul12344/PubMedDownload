people inject drugs (pwid) high risk blood-borne pathogens
transmitted sharing contaminated injection equipment, particularly 
hepatitis c virus (hcv). hcv prevalence influenced complex interplay of
drug-use behaviors, social networks, geography, well availability
of interventions, needle exchange programs. adequately address this
complexity hcv epidemic forecasting, developed computational model, 
the agent-based pathogen kinetics model (apk). apk simulates pwid population 
in metropolitan chicago, including social interactions result hcv
infection. used multiple empirical data sources chicago pwid build a
spatial distribution silico pwid population modeled networks among
the pwid considering geography city suburbs. apk was
validated 2012 empirical data (the latest available) shown agree
with network epidemiological surveys within 1%. period 2010-2020, 
apk forecasts decline hcv prevalence 0.8% per year 44(± 2)% 36(± 
5)%, although sub-populations would continue relatively high
prevalence, including non-hispanic blacks, 48(± 5)%. rate decline 
lowest non-hispanic whites find, reversal historical trends,
that incidence among non-hispanic whites would exceed incidence among
non-hispanic blacks (0.66 per 100 per years vs 0.17 per 100 person years). apk
also forecasts increase pwid mean age 35(± 1) 40(± 2) a
corresponding increase 59(± 2)% 80(± 6)% proportion the
population >30 years old. studies highlight importance analyzing
subpopulations disease predictions, utility computer simulation for
analyzing demographic health trends among pwid serve tool for
guiding intervention prevention strategies chicago, major
