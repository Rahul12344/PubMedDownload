background: objective assess trends prevalence hepatitis b
virus (hbv) infection united states widespread hepatitis b
vaccination.
methods: prevalence hbv infection immunity determined a
representative sample us population periods 1999-2006 and
1988-1994. national health nutrition examination surveys participants 6 years
of age tested antibody hepatitis b core antigen (anti-hbc), hepatitis
b surface antigen (hbsag), antibody hepatitis b surface antigen
(anti-hbs). prevalence estimates weighted age-adjusted.
results: period 1999-2006, age-adjusted prevalences anti-hbc (4.7%)
and hbsag (0.27%) statistically different during
1988-1994 (5.4% 0.38%, respectively). prevalence anti-hbc decreased
among persons 6-19 years age (from 1.9% 0.6%; p < .01) 20-49 years of
age (from 5.9% 4.6%; p < .01) among persons 50 years age (7.2% vs
7.7%). 1999-2006, prevalence anti-hbc higher among non-hispanic
blacks (12.2%) persons "other" race (13.3%) among non-hispanic
whites (2.8%) mexican americans (2.9%), higher among foreign-born
participants (12.2%) among us-born participants (3.5%). prevalence
among us-born children 6-19 years age (0.5%) differ race or
ethnicity. disparities us-born foreign-born children smaller
during 1999-1996 (0.5% vs 2.0%) 1988-1994 (1.0% vs 12.8%). among
children 6-19 years age, 56.7% markers vaccine-induced immunity.
conclusions: hbv prevalence decreased among us children, reflected the
impact global domestic vaccination, changed little among adults,
and approximately 730,000 us residents (95% confidence interval, 550,000-940,000)
are chronically infected.
