monoclonal antibodies herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoproteins show that
epitope location influences virus neutralization.

la thangue nb, chan wl, almeida jd.

three monoclonal antibodies, g8d1 , c2d2 , ti57 , reacting herpes
simplex virus type 1 glycoproteins characterised according the
location epitope ability neutralize infective virus. immune
electron microscopy blocking radioimmunoassay used locate the
epitopes. results indicate epitope recognised g8d1 located 
the surface glycoprotein fringe, whereas recognized c2d2 ti57
are interior respect this. g8d1 neutralizing activity alone,
whereas c2d2 neutralize antiglobulin added. thus, epitope location
and density determine neutralizing capacity individual antibody molecules.
