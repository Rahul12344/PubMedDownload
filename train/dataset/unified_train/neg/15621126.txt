plasma cell proliferative disorder (pcpd) developed two patients actively
replicating hepatitis c virus (hcv) neoplastic plasma cells orthotopic
liver transplantation hcv-related end-stage liver disease. pcpd confined 
to transplanted liver associated monoclonal proteins blood.
bone marrow biopsy show evidence pcpd. epstein-barr virus 
detected situ hybridization either case. situ hybridization hcv
rna sense antisense probes liver biopsy specimens showed signals in
neoplastic plasma cells well hepatocytes. suggest patients
had posttransplant pcpd resulting hcv. may represent new posttransplant
disease entity different previously described posttransplant
lymphoproliferative disorder. findings raise intriguing questions the
role hcv pcpds patients chronic hcv infection.
