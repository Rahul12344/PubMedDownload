from concentrated samples analyzed rt-pcr sequencing. nv 
commonly detected pathogen tested samples (14%). rv hav detected 
in 9% 7% samples, respectively. study first detect enteric 
viral genes flood water thailand. furthermore, first detect an
nv gene type environmental water thailand. results provide
