background: increased travelling countries endemic dengue fever (df)
demands efficient laboratory diagnostics. nucleic acid amplification techniques
(nat) frequently used rapid diagnosis imported viral diseases.
different pcr systems available.
objectives: order assess quality molecular diagnostics dengue
virus infections, external quality assurance (eqa) pcr diagnostics was
conducted.
study design: panel 10 human plasma samples prepared spiked with
dengue virus types den-1 den-4. addition, 10-fold dilution series
(1:10-1:10(4) ) den-3 virus included. panel pre-tested nested
rt-pcr, in-house real-time pcr, commercial real-time pcr kit. samples
were inactivated gamma irradiation shipped freeze dried state. thirteen
laboratories, within european network diagnostics imported viral
diseases (enivd) took part using either single-round, nested, real-time rt-pcr
methods. two laboratories used two methods parallel, summarising 15
comparable results.
results: 33-100% correct results achieved. laboratories detected den-2
correctly, followed den-1 (14 positive results 15), den-3 (12/15) den-4
(11/15). testing serial dilution revealed low sensitivity many labs,
with results ranging 33 80% correctly tested samples.
conclusion: eqa gives feedback quality rt-pcr system used 
each respective laboratory. different test systems amplification
conditions demonstrate importance external quality control measures.
