the 2014 outbreak ebola virus (ebov) western africa highlighted need
for anti-ebov therapeutics. clomiphene u.s. food drug administration
(fda)-approved drug blocks ebov entry infection cells and
significantly protects ebov-challenged mice. provided, clomiphene is,
approximately, 60:40 mixture two stereoisomers, enclomiphene and
zuclomiphene. pharmacokinetic properties two isomers vary, both
accumulate eye male reproductive tract, tissues ebov can
persist. compared ability clomiphene isomers inhibit
ebov using viral-like particle (vlp) entry and
transcription/replication-competent vlp (trvlp) assays. clomiphene its
isomers inhibited entry infection vlps trvlps similar
potencies. demonstrated vlps bearing glycoproteins three
filoviruses (ebov mayinga, ebov makona, marburg virus) two cell lines 
(293t/17 vero e6). visual problems noted ebov survivors, and
viral rna isolated semen nine months post-infection. since
the clomiphene isomers accumulate affected tissues, clomiphene one of
its isomers warrants consideration anti-ebov agent, example, to
potentially help ameliorate symptoms ebov survivors.
