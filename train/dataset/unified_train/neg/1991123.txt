substitution thr26 gln lysozyme bacteriophage t4 produces an
enzyme greatly reduced activity essentially unaltered stability relative
to wild type. spontaneous second-site revertants mutant selected
genetically; two chosen structural biochemical
characterization. one revertant bears (in addition primary mutation) the
substitution tyr18----his, other, tyr18----asp. primary mutant both
revertant lysozyme genes reconstructed plasmid-based expression system,
and proteins produced purified. two revertant lysozymes exhibit 
enzymatic activities intermediate wild type primary mutant; 
also exhibit melting temperatures approximately 3 degrees c lower either the
wild type primary mutant. crystals suitable x-ray diffraction analysis
were obtained revertant lysozymes, primary mutant.
structures double mutant lysozymes refined 1.8-a resolution to
crystallographic residuals 15.1% (tyr18----his) 15.2% (tyr18----asp).
model building suggests side chain gln26 primary mutant is
forced protrude active site cleft, resulting low catalytic
activity. contrast, crystal structures revertants reveal the
double substitutions (gln26 his18, gln26 asp18) fit same
space occupied thr26 tyr18 wild-type enzyme; effect 
a restructuring surface active site cleft, essentially no
perturbation polypeptide backbone. restructuring effected a
novel series hydrogen bonds electrostatic interactions apparently
stabilize revertant structures.
