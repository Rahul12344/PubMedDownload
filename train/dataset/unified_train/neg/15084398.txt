for past three decades cold-adapted (ca) temperature sensitive (ts)
master donor strain, a/leningrad/134/17/57 (h2n2) successfully used as
the basis live attenuated reassortant influenza vaccine. donor
strain developed a/leningrad/134/57 (h2n2) wild-type (wt) virus
following 17 passages eggs 25 degrees c. detailed investigation has
revealed a/leningrad/134/17/57 (len/17) master donor stock mixed
population comprised numerous variants ca/ts len/17 influenza virus. we
have identified variants exhibit broad range temperature
sensitive phenotype assayed madin-darby canine kidney (mdck) cells 37 
degrees c. selection variant clones fully characterized by
sequencing order understand variability ts phenotype. study
has also addressed feasibility using cell culture technology the
propagation subsequent manufacturing cold-adapted influenza vaccine
(caiv), particularly respect retaining defined mutations that
contribute toward ca/ts phenotype.
