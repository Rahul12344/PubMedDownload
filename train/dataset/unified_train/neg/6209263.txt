assays.

smit j, agabian n.

a precisely ordered crystalline array found surface bacterium
caulobacter crescentus cb15. using immunological assay, identified
recombinant bacteriophage clones expressing predominant protein this
structure lambda 1059 library c. crescentus cb15 dna. single
4.4-kilobase hindiii fragment encoded polypeptide whose antigenic determinants,
molecular weight, peculiar solubilization properties identical with
those authentic predominant polypeptide (130k) surface array. the
130k protein produced discrete product result gene transcription
initiated lambda promoter; several experiments suggested the
caulobacter promoter gene efficiently recognized the
escherichia coli transcription machinery. genomic southern analysis revealed a
single copy 130k protein gene per genome. 130k protein gene was
hybridized dna two closely related laboratory strains c. crescentus
which lost ability produce surface array. one strains,
cb2, possesses homologous copy 130k gene, whereas dna other
strain, cb13b1a, showed lesser degree hybridization 130k gene probe; 
genomic fragments hybridize different sizes cb13 compared
with cb15. findings discussed relation studies the
surface array function role cellular morphogenesis this
stalk-forming bacterium.
