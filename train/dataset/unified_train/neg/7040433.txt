changes expression membrane antigens differentiation of
chicken erythroblasts.

hayman mj, beug h, savin kw.

chicken erythroblasts transformed avian retrovirus, avian
erythroblastosis virus (aev). earlier studies shown mechanism of
transformation appears involve "block" differentiation, when
erythroblasts transformed temperature-sensitive mutant ts34 aev and
incubated nonpermissive temperature, cells start differentiate 
produce hemoglobin. decided use system isolate pure
populations chicken erythroblasts raise monoclonal antibodies against
their cell surface proteins. three monoclonal antibodies isolated tested
for ability bind various hematopoietic cell types; two shown 
be erythroid-specific, whereas antibody bound proliferating cells
but erythrocytes granulocytes. erythroid-specific antibodies,
one precipitated 94,000 molecular weight protein, whereas other
precipitated 11,000 molecular weight protein tentatively identified as
hemoglobin. use system approach identify evaluate changes 
that occur differentiation discussed.
