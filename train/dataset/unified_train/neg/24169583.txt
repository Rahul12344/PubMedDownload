oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (opscc) associated human
papillomavirus (hpv). hpv-positive opscc considered distinct molecular
entity better prognosis hpv-negative cases opscc. however, the
exact pathogenic mechanisms underlying differences clinical molecular 
behavior hpv-positive hpv-negative opscc remain poorly understood.

epigenetic changes frequently observed human cancers. is
suggested heterogeneous epigenetic changes play role clinical and
biological differences hpv-positive hpv-negative tumors. unraveling
the differences methylation profiles hpv-associated opscc may provide for
promising clinical applications may pave road personalized cancer
treatment. systematic review aims assess current state knowledge
regarding differences promoter hypermethylation global methylation between
hpv-positive hpv-negative opscc.
