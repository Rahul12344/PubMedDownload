this study evaluates enhancement immune response birds newcastle
disease (nd) vaccine encapsulated 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane
(dotap)-based liposomes. vesicles liposomal nd vaccine physically
characterized shape, particle size zeta potential. results the
analyses showed vesicles liposomal nd vaccine spherical and
tightly packed. mean size distribution 100 nm. mean zeta
potential 24 mv. sixty experimental birds divided an
unvaccinated group, liposomal nd vaccine group live la sota(®) vaccine
group. liposomal nd vaccine live la sota(®) vaccine groups were
vaccinated orally 3 6 weeks age. mean antibody titres, total and
differential white blood cell count, blood chemistry, respectively, were
assessed. ten birds group challenged oral administration 0.2
ml virulent herts 33 strain 9 weeks age. log(2) mean antibody titre
induced liposomal nd vaccine secondary immunization birds was
9.60±0.95 live la sota( (®) ) vaccine 6.00±0.63. nine of
the 10 challenged birds unvaccinated group died none died the
liposomal nd vaccine group live la sota(®) vaccine group. boost 
vaccination, chickens vaccinated liposomal nd vaccine higher
mean antibody titre, indicating encapsulating nd vaccine dotap-based
liposome induced significantly higher immunity live la sota(®) vaccine.
