to compare gene expression profiles uninfected bombyx mori
nucleopolyhedrovirus (bmnpv)-infected bmn cells, constructed four cdna
libraries mock-infected cells, cells 2, 6, 12 h postinfection
(h.p.i.). total 2645 partial sequences obtained expressed-sequence-tags 
(ests) libraries categorized using blast searches public
database bmnpv genome sequence. following proportions of
bmnpv-derived ests observed: 0.4, 4.5, 57% 2, 6, 12 h.p.i,
respectively. moreover, 31 bmnpv open reading frames (orfs) newly identified
for transcripts baculovirus-repeated orfs (bro) showed highest levels
of expression 12 h.p.i. library. host genes decreased in
number infection progressed. however, several, including cytochrome c
oxidase 1, increased late stages infection. two apoptosis-related host 
genes also identified.
