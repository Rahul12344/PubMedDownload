there currently unmet need development small-molecule
therapeutics norovirus infection. piperazine scaffold, privileged
structure embodied many pharmacological agents, used synthesize an
array structurally-diverse derivatives screened anti-norovius
activity cell-based replicon system. studies described herein
demonstrate first time functionalized piperazine derivatives possess
anti-norovirus activity. furthermore, studies led the
identification two promising compounds (6a 9l) used a
launching pad optimization potency, cytotoxicity, drug-like
characteristics.
