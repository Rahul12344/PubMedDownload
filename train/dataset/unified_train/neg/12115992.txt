hepatitis b virus (hbv) classified seven genotypes, designated a-g.
the hbv genotype characteristic geographical distribution. republic 
uzbekistan located heart asia considered region
with high endemicity hepatitis viruses. however, present distribution of
hepatitis virus infection region unknown. aim study to
investigate distribution hbv genotypes elucidate validity of
two genotyping systems uzbekistan. fifty-four patients hepatitis b
surface antigen investigated. hbv genotypes determined two methods: 
one based restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) targeting s
region, another enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), using
monoclonal antibodies pre-s2 region. seven (13%) 47 (87%) 54
subjects classified genotypes d, respectively. dual infection 
two viral populations genotype observed one subject. no
significant difference alt level (203.3 +/- 244.7 vs. 190.6 +/- 39.5) and
hbeag (42.9% vs. 42.6%) found genotypes d. study, 
validity genotyping systems region confirmed.
