seventeen monoclonal antibodies raised bovine viral diarrhoea virus 
divided three groups basis radioimmunoprecipitation results. seven
monoclonal antibodies precipitated polypeptide 80kd defined four
domains, showed considerable conservation amongst 180 pestivirus
strains isolates examined. nine monoclonal antibodies, including six with
virus neutralizing activity, precipitated 53kd polypeptide appeared 
be directed towards single domain clustered epitopes. several these
epitopes present many ruminant virus strains isolates, hog
cholera viruses. single monoclonal antibody precipitated 48kd polypeptide,
defining epitope also present many ruminant viruses, hog
cholera viruses. pestiviruses cattle sheep shared a
number epitopes located three different proteins.
