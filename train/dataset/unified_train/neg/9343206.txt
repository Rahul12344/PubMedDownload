in previous studies, c-terminal r peptide murine leukemia virus (mulv)
env protein shown potent inhibitor viral fusion activity. the
present study, investigated molecular determinants mulv env protein
cytoplasmic tail important fusion inhibition activity r 
peptide. constructed series mutant mulv env genes express env
proteins serial truncations, internal deletions, amino acid substitutions
in cytoplasmic tail. analyze cell fusion activity, employed a
quantitative fusion assay. found truncations 7 amino acids 
the c terminus cytoplasmic tail detectable effect lack of
fusion activity full-length env protein; however, truncations
resulted progressive increase cell fusion activity. studies mutant
proteins amino acid substitutions cytoplasmic tail showed that
leu-627 plays important role fusion inhibition r peptide, most
of amino acids r peptide essential fusion
inhibition. studies mutant proteins internal deletions upstream the
cleavage site cytoplasmic tail showed region also involved in
fusion inhibition r peptide, although limited extent. the
results consistent model mulv r peptide exhibits its
fusion inhibition activity interaction cellular factor(s).
