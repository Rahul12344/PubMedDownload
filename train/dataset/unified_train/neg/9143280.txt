the recent emergence spread dengue hemorrhagic fever americas 
been major source concern. efforts control disease dependent 
understanding pathogenicity dengue viruses transmission
dynamics. pathogenicity studies hampered lack vitro 
vivo models severe dengue disease. alternatively, molecular epidemiologic
studies associate certain dengue virus genetic types severe dengue
outbreaks may point strains increased pathogenicity. comparison of
nucleotide sequences (240 bp) e/ns1 gene region dengue virus
genome shown reflect evolutionary relationships geographic
origins dengue virus strains. approach used demonstrate an
association introduction two distinct genotypes dengue type 2
virus appearance dengue hemorrhagic fever americas.
phylogenetic analyses suggest genotypes originated southeast asia
and displaced native, american genotype least four countries.
vaccination control efforts therefore directed decreasing 
the transmission "virulent" genotypes.
