human immunodeficiency viruses 321 samples tenofovir-naÃ¯ve patients 
retrospectively evaluated resistance nucleotide analogue. virus
strains insertions amino acids 67 70 reverse
transcriptase (n = 6) highly resistant. virus strains q151m
mutation divided susceptible (n = 12) highly resistant (n = 8)
viruses. difference due absence presence k65r mutation,
which confirmed site-directed mutagenesis. viral clones various
combinations mutations m41l, k70r, l210w, t215f t215y analyzed
for cross-resistance induced thymidine analogue mutations (tams). levels
of increased resistance induced single, double, triple mutations the
indicated positions could ranked follows: mutants single
mutations, mutations positions 41 > 215 > 70; mutants double
mutations, mutations positions 41 215 > 70 215 = 210 215 > 41 
70; mutants triple mutations, mutations positions 41, 210, 215 > 
41, 70, 215. viral clones m184v m184i exhibited slightly increased
susceptibilities tenofovir (0.7-fold). almost clones tam-induced
resistance resensitized m184v present (p < 0.001). among the
viruses clinical samples, rate tenofovir resistance significantly
increased number tams samples 184m with
184v (p = 0.005 p = 0.003, respectively). resensitizing effect m184v was
confirmed samples exhibiting least one tam (p = 0.03). however,
accumulation least two tams resulted 2.0-fold reduced
susceptibility tenofovir, irrespective presence m184v. decision tree
building, classical machine learning technique, used generate models for
the interpretation mutations respect tenofovir resistance. the
application previously proposed cutoffs reduced response therapy 
treatment failure demonstrated central roles positions 215 65 1.5-
and 4.0-fold reduced susceptibilities, respectively. thus, clinically relevant
resistance may conferred accumulation tams, resensitizing
effect m184v considered minor.
