objective: construct identify recombinant adenovirus of
muramidase-released protein (mrp) gene fragment streptococcus suis type 2
(ss2).
methods: specific primers designed based sequence mrp gene
fragment. mrp gene fragment (467-1351 bp) amplified pcr method with
genomic dna ss2 template. pcr products cloned pmd18-t vector.
then mrp gene fragment linked adenovirus shuttle plasmid
(pshuttle-cmv) construct recombinant shuttle plasmid (pshuttle-cmv-mrp). after
pmei digestion, transformed bj5183-ad-1 competent cells containing
adenoviral backbone plasmid padeasy-1 construct homogeneous recombinant
adenovirus plasmid (padeno-cmv-mrp). recombinant adenovirus plasmid 
linearized pmei transfected ad-293 cells viral packaging.
finally, virus liquid tested pcr western blotting.
results: cytopathic effect (cpe) observed 8 transfection linear
padeno-cmv-mrp ad-293 cells. mrp gene fragment protein expression were
also detected virus liquid.
conclusion: recombinant adenovirus mrp gene fragment (radeno-mrp) ss2
was constructed successfully.
