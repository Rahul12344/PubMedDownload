this study investigated clonal nature cold agglutinin disease series 
of nine patients, included benign idiopathic form well cases
with underlying lymphoma. surface marker phenotyping karyotypic analysis
were performed peripheral blood lymphocytes. increased proportion b
cells found four cases three patients monoclonal b cell 
population identified mu, kappa phenotype. three cases, as
well additional patient, aberrant karyotype demonstrated. the
cytogenetic abnormality present four cases included trisomy 3; two
patients also trisomy 12. one four patients a
well-differentiated lymphoma underwent splenectomy. splenic lymphocytes
were transformed epstein-barr virus cultured en masse. eight clones were
established producing cold agglutinin identical specificity that
present patient's plasma. five clones studied
cytogenetically, abnormal karyotype
(51,xx,+3,+9,+12,+13,+18) found peripheral blood splenic lymphocytes.
thus, case, cold reactive autoantibody produced the
chromosomally abnormal, neoplastic clone lymphocytes. findings support the
view cold agglutinin disease represents spectrum clonal disorders.
