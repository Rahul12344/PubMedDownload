background/aims: study examined correlates brain's neurocognitive
performance among clinically biochemically normal adult patient with
hepatitis c virus (hcv). hypothesized anti-hcv positive individuals would
demonstrate structural brain abnormalities neurocognitive dysfunction well
as changes cell component extracellular space white matter
regions brain asymptomatic hcv infection using diffusion tensor
tractrography (dtt) metrics.
methods: anti-hcv positive patient (n = 40), healthy controls (n = 31),
fulfilling inclusion criteria (incidentally detected anti-hcv positive) able 
to provide informed consent screened recruited study. 
subjects controls underwent subjective assessment quality life
related symptoms, neuropsychometric tests (npt) magnetic resonance imaging.
results: patients subjected neuroimaging well psychological
testing. significant difference basic laboratory parameters in
these two groups. independent t-test reveals significantly lower
neuropsychological functioning compared healthy control. significantly
decreased fa values myoinsitol observed hcv subjects sensory,
inferior longitudinal fascicules, str fiber bundles compared healthy
control. bivariate correlation analysis reveals neuropsychological scores
are significantly positive.
conclusion: result show hcv positive individuals would demonstrate
structural brain abnormalities neurocognitive dysfunction well the
changes cell component extracellular space white matter regions 
brain asymptomatic hcv infection using dtt metrics.
