a surveillance method able differentiate vaccinated infected
poultry required countries practice vaccination highly 
pathogenic avian influenza h5n1. external domain m2 protein (m2e) of
influenza virus potentially useful differentiating-infected vaccinated 
animals (diva) antigen little known m2e antibody response and
factors influencing detection. study, m2e antibody response was
characterized layer birds vaccinated challenged indonesian h5n1
virus isolate, using single m2e peptide four-branched multiple antigenic
peptide form m2e (map-m2e) antigens two separate elisas. anti-m2e
antibodies absent chicks high level maternal haemagglutination
inhibition antibodies also layers vaccinated once, twice three
times inactivated commercial h5n1 vaccine. contrast, anti-m2e
antibodies detected vaccinated layers challenged h5n1 virus and
their presence associated virus isolation increase in
haemagglutination inhibition titres. number birds developed m2e
antibodies, well strength duration m2e antibody response
were strongly influenced length interval vaccination and
challenge. birds challenged six weeks vaccination developed m2e
antibodies 14 days lasted least 56 days infection. in
birds challenged two weeks vaccination, proportion birds
developed m2e antibodies 14 days lasted 28 days
post-infection. single m2e peptide map-m2e elisas high diagnostic
specificity diagnostic sensitivity map-m2e elisa significantly
higher effective detecting m2e antibody immune infected birds.
the results show map-m2e elisa would useful surveillance countries
using vaccination control highly pathogenic avian influenza h5n1.
