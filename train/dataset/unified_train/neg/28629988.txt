the henipaviruses nipah virus hendra virus highly pathogenic zoonotic
paramyxoviruses caused fatal outbreaks encephalitis respiratory
disease humans. despite availability licensed equine hendra virus
vaccine neutralizing monoclonal antibody shown efficacious against
henipavirus infections non-human primates, remains approved
therapeutics vaccines human use. explore possibility developing 
small-molecule nucleoside inhibitors henipaviruses, evaluated the
antiviral activity 4'-azidocytidine (r1479), drug previously identified to
inhibit flaviviruses, henipaviruses along representative
members family paramyxoviridae. observed similar levels r1479
antiviral activity across family, regardless virus genus. brief study 
expands documented range viruses susceptible r1479, provides the
basis future investigation development 4'-modified nucleoside analogs 
as potential broad-spectrum antiviral therapeutics across positive and
negative-sense rna virus families.
