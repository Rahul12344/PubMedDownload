interferon-inducible protein 56 (ifi56, also known isg56/ifit1,
interferon-induced protein tetratricopeptide repeats 1) strongly induced 
in response interferon potent inhibitor viral replication and
translational initiation. here, describe identification ifi56 (ofifi56)
in olive flounder, characteristic features, expression levels various 
tissues viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (vhsv) infection. the
full-length ofifi56 sequence identified rapid amplification cdna ends
pcr. complete coding sequence ofifi56 1971 bp length encodes 431
amino acids. putative ofifi56 protein multiple tetratricopeptide (tpr)
motifs, regulate diverse biological processes, organelle targeting,
protein import, vesicle fusion. based sequence analysis, larimichthys 
crocea ifi56 protein (61%) highest sequence homology ofifi56. in
healthy olive flounder, ofifi56 mrna expression detected many tissues such
as intestine, gill, head kidney, heart, spleen, trunk kidney tissues. after
vhsv challenge, ofifi56 mrna significantly up-regulated tissues.
additionally, ofifi56 expression induced poly i:c streptococcus
parauberis s. iniae infection lipopolysaccharide injection kidney and
spleen tissues olive flounder. results demonstrate piscine ofifi56 
expression induced bacterial infection selectively induced by
viral infection, especially vhsv, ofifi56 may play important role 
the host response vhsv infection.
