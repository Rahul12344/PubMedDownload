iron-chelating agent picolinic acid.

spontaneously transformed (tumorigenic) chinese hamster cells (line cho) not
exhibit picolinic acid-sensitive g1 g2 cell cycle arrest points observed in
normal virus-transformed cells. rather, picolinic acid arrests cho cells s
phase produces culture growth behaviour similar produced by
hydroxyurea. prolonged treatment picolinic acid permits slow but
significant traverse cells phase. thus, like hydroxyurea, picolinic 
acid useful agent synchronizing exponential cho cells, be
used resynchronize cultures early phase previous synchronization
procedure (such isoleucine deprivation) used. iron chelating properties
of picolinic acid, similarities effects cultured cells those
of hydroxyurea iron-chelating drug desferrioxamine, suggest that
picolinic acid inhibits dna synthesis interfering iron-dependent
production stable free organic radical essential the
