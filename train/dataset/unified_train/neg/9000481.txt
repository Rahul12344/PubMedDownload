the 26-kda membrane tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) expressed on
activated cd4(+) cells novel candidate functional membrane
molecule t-b cell interactions. found normal human cells, when
infected human cell lymphotropic virus type (htlv-i) vitro, were
induced express 26-kda membrane tnf-alpha. infected cells, through
this molecule, activated autologous b cells produce immunoglobulin (ig)m 
contact-dependent manner, partially inhibited anti-tnf-alpha
antibody (ab). igg synthesis stimulated, however, probably of
lack cd40 ligand expression infected cells. anti-tnf-alpha ab
treatment stimulated secretion interleukin (il)-2 interferon gamma
(ifn-gamma) infected cells. effects induced anti-tnf
receptor ab treatment. anti-tnf-alpha ab also induced elevation of
intracellular calcium concentration infected cells. results
suggest cells expressing membrane tnf-alpha directly stimulated
through molecule. thus, suggested 26-kda membrane tnf-alpha
on htlv-i-infected cells plays role polyclonal b cell activation may
be involved pathogenesis htlv-i-associated diseases. additionally,
our results suggest novel mechanism cytokine production be
modulated cells membrane tnf-alpha surface.
