background & aims: hepatitis virus (hdv) infection associated more
severe outcome patients chronic hepatitis b (chb); however, little is
known presence hdv sub-saharan africa. aimed determine 
prevalence hdv infection, well clinical, biological virological 
characteristics, large chb cohort ethiopia.
methods: total, 1267 hiv-negative chb patients st. paul's hospital
millennium medical college addis ababa screened anti-hdv antibodies
using elisa assays. confirmed positive samples tested hdv rna
using consensus commercial real-time rt-pcr assay. hdv genotypes also
determined rna-positive samples nucleotide sequencing followed by
phylogenetic analyses. demographical, clinical biological data patients 
were recorded compared based hdv rna results.
results: patients (n = 748, 59.0%) men, median age 31 years
(interquartile range 26-40). anti-hdv antibodies detected 19 individuals 
(1.5%), 12 hdv rna-positive viral load ranging <2 >8 
log 10 iu/ml. strains genotype 1. hdv rna-positive patients more
likely significant liver fibrosis (63.6% vs 24.7%, p = .007) and
cirrhosis (45.5% vs 16.4%, p = .024).
conclusions: hdv infection rare ethiopia associated more
advanced liver fibrosis.
