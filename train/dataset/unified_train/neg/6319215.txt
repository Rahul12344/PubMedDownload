the binding insulin mouse leucocytes viral infections.

shimizu f, kahn cr, garzelli c, hooks jj, notkins al.

the effect viral infections insulin binding vivo evaluated by
measuring binding 125i-insulin several different tissues. found that
splenic leucocytes mice infected either diabetogenic (d) or
non-diabetogenic (b) variants encephalomyocarditis virus, herpes simplex
virus, lactic dehydrogenase virus showed 130% increase insulin
binding. much 300% increase binding 125i-insulin splenic
leucocytes observed mice given bacterial lipopolysaccharide. neither
virus-infected lipopolysaccharide-treated mice substantial
change insulin receptors thymocytes, liver membranes, peripheral
erythrocytes. thus, increased binding insulin appears limited to
leucocytes appear represent generalized metabolic alteration.
these experiments suggest infection, binding insulin to
leucocytes, widely used measure insulin receptors, may always
accurately reflect insulin receptor status tissues.
