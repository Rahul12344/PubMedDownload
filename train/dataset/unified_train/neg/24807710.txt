the development immunization strategies protect ocular infection
with herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) must address issue effects 
strategy establishment latency trigeminal ganglia (tg). is
the reactivation latent virus cause recurrent disease and
corneal scarring. cd8(+) cells dendritic cells (dcs) implicated
in establishment maintenance latency several lines inquiry.
the objective current study use cd8α(-/-) cd8β(-/-) mice to
further evaluate contributions cd8(+) cells cd8α(+) cd8α(-) 
subpopulations dcs protection afforded ocular infection by
immunization hsv-1 potential increase latency. neutralizing 
antibody titers similar immunized cd8α(-/-), cd8β(-/-), wild-type
(wt) mice, virus replication eye. however, day 3 postinfection
(p.i.), copy number hsv-1 glycoprotein b (gb) higher corneas
and tg cd8α(-/-) mice wt mice, whereas day 5 p.i. was
lower. would anticipated, lack cd8α(+) cd8β(+) cells affected the
levels type type ii interferon transcripts, effects were
markedly time dependent tissue specific. levels latent virus the

reactivation assays, lower immunized, ocularly challenged cd8α(-/-)
and wt mice cd8β(-/-) counterparts. immunization reduced the
expression pd-1, marker t-cell exhaustion, tg ocularly
challenged mice, mock-immunized cd8α(-/-) mice lower levels pd-1
expression latency mock-immunized wt cd8β(-/-) mice. expansion of
the cd8α(-) subpopulation dcs injection wt mice with
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) dna reduced amount 
of latency pd-1 expression tg infected mice. contrast, injection
of fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (flt3l) dna, expanded both
subpopulations, less effective. results suggest absence 
cd8α(+) cells cd8α(+) dcs reduce vaccine efficacy, either directly
or indirectly, challenged mice administration gm-csf appears to
play beneficial role reducing latency t-cell exhaustion. importance: 
the past 2 decades, two large clinical hsv vaccine trials performed, but
both vaccine studies failed reach goals. thus, alternative to
conventional vaccine studies, used different strategy manipulate the
host immune responses effort induce greater protection hsv

this report, show absence cd8α(+) cells cd8α(+) dcs no
adverse effect vaccine efficacy. line hypothesis, found that
pushing dc subpopulations cd8α(+) dcs toward cd8α(-) dcs injection of
gm-csf reduced amount latent virus t-cell exhaustion tg. while
these studies point lack role cd8α(+) cells vaccine
efficacy, turn point role gm-csf reducing hsv-1 latency.
