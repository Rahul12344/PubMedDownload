thirteen crossbred heifers seronegative bovine herpesvirus-1 (bhv-1) were
bred naturally seronegative bull. eight heifers inoculated bhv-1, 
iv, postbreeding day (pbd) 7 14. viremia detected heifers 1 
7, virus also isolated nasal vaginal secretions heifers 2, 3,
4, 6, 7. pregnancy status heifers monitored pbd 14 pbd
35 determining plasma progesterone concentrations 1- 3-day intervals.
decreased progesterone values indicated pregnancy maintained in
bhv-1-inoculated heifers 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8. postbreeding interestrual
period 6 heifers normal slightly longer would be
expected absence conception. 5 noninoculated heifers pregnant 
on pbd 35. three 4 months acute infection, bhv-1 inoculated heifers 
were treated dexamethasone 5 days euthanatized. nasal and
vaginal swab specimens tested daily dexamethasone treatment for
excreted bhv-1, reproductive tissues adrenal glands collected at
necropsy virologic tests histopathologic examination. virus reactivation 
was demonstrated heifers 2 8. bhv-1 isolations made from
adrenal glands heifers 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, vaginal swab specimens heifers
2, 3, 4, 6, 7, nasal swab specimens heifers 2, 3, 6. heifer 3
had virus reproductive tissues; isolations made ovary,
infundibulum, uterine tube, endometrium.(abstract truncated at
