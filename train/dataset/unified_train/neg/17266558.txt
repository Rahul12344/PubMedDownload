the hiv-1 spacer peptide p1 located c-terminus gag polyprotein
and separates nucleocapsid (nc) p6(gag). research centered p1 been
limited yet function ascribed spacer peptide. 
previously found conserved p1 proline residues (position 7 13) are
critical replication hiv-1 strain hxb2-bh10. study have
focused proline rich p1-p6(gag) c-terminus hiv-1. individually
examined role p1 proline's multiple strains hiv-1 investigated
the role three proline residues p6(gag) (p24, p25 p30). assessment of
the hxb2-bh10 based mutants revealed gag-pol incorporation relative gag
decreased p1 mutant virions, double proline mutant most
impaired. mutating p1 proline residues found abolish infectivity in
multiple strains hiv-1. independent mutation p1 proline position 7
resulted strain-dependent suppression viral infectivity. defect
correlates presence tyrosine residue position 9 p1 occurs
in early phase hiv-1 replication cycle. p1 proline residues were
found functionally distinct p24, p25 p30 p6(gag). work
affords novel insights understanding role p1 hiv-1
replication.
