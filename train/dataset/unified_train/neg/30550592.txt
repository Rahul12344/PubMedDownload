the effectiveness rabies vaccination humans animals determined 
by presence virus neutralizing antibodies (vnas). rapid fluorescent
focus inhibition test (rffit) method traditionally used detection 
quantification vnas. functional vitro test assessing the
ability antibodies serum bind prevent infection cultured cells
with rabies virus (rabv). rffit labor intensive, low throughput and
semi-quantitative assay performed trained laboratorians. requires staining 
of rabv-infected cells rabies specific fluorescent antibodies manual
quantification fluorescent fields titer determination. although the
quantification fluorescent fields observed sample recorded, the
corresponding images stored captured used future analysis.
to circumvent several disadvantages, developed alternative,
automated high throughput neutralization test (htnt) determination rabies 
vnas based green fluorescent protein (gfp) expression recombinant rabv
and compared rffit. htnt assay utilizes recombinant rabv era
variant expressing gfp nuclear localization signal (nls) efficient
quantification. htnt quantitative method number of
rabv-infected cells determined images stored future analysis.
both rffit htnt results correlated 100% panel human animal
positive negative rabies serum samples. although, vna titer values are
generally agreeable, htnt titers tend lower rffit, probably
due differences quantification methods. data demonstrates the
potential htnt assays determination rabies vna titers.
