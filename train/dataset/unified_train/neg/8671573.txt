background: general, information causes adult deaths developing
countries scarce. specifically, relatively little known the
effect hiv-1 associated disease adult mortality general populations. 
this study used verbal autopsy technique ascertain whether adult
deaths associated hiv-1 rural population prevalence of
hiv-1 infection 8%, used hiv-1 antibody status validate verbal
autopsy findings.
methods: adult deaths population cohort occurred december
1990 november 1993 identified monthly death registration
system. approximately 2 months death, relative deceased was
interviewed trained nurse, questionnaires assessed least two 
independent clinicians; unaware hiv serostatus deceased.
results: total 155 adult deaths assessed, i.e. 53% recorded adult
deaths. assessed half hiv-1 positive. 47% deaths were
classified hiv-related. overall specificity positive predictive value 
of verbal autopsy tool 92%; aged 13-44 years (83 adults)
the corresponding values 85% 95% respectively. verbal autopsy
estimated hiv-1 attributable mortality fraction similar calculated
fraction based prospective data.
conclusions: results study suggest verbal autopsy studies may
assist providing data hiv-associated mortality general populations and
may useful surveillance tools.

pip: verbal autopsy technique represents means increasing accuracy 
of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids)-related mortality statistics in
sub-saharan africa, many deaths occur home. structured interview,
adapted local disease perceptions, administered lay personnel to
relatives friends deceased. technique evaluated rural
area uganda's masaka district human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-1
seroprevalence rate 8%. adult deaths occurring 15 index villages
from december 1990 november 1993 identified monthly
village-based death registration system. nurse paid initial condolence visit
to bereaved family returned two months later the
questionnaire. interviews conducted families friends 155 (53%) of
the 293 adult deaths hiv serostatus known. least two clinicians 
unaware serostatus results assessed questionnaire indicated the
likely causes death. agreement whether death not
hiv-related 141 (91%) deaths. 14 cases discordant
assessments reviewed third clinician. overall, 73 (47%) deaths 
attributed hiv-related causes. using hiv serostatus standard of
comparison, overall specificity predictive value verbal autopsy
were 92%. findings suggest method relied upon to
estimate hiv-associated mortality populations relatively high hiv
prevalence.
