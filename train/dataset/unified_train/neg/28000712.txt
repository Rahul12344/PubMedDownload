this study meta-analyzed literature possible association polymorphisms 
-137 (rs187238) -607 (rs1946518) interleukin-18 (il-18) promoter 
risk hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). analysis included 8 case-control
studies -137 polymorphism (1,318 cases, 2,254 controls) 7 case-control
studies -607 polymorphism (1,262 cases, 1,696 controls). none five 
genetic models suggested significant association -137 polymorphism 
and hcc risk: allelic model, 0.99, 95% ci 0.74-1.34, p = 0.97; recessive
model, 0.98, 95% ci 0.65-1.46, p = 0.91; dominant model, 1.35, 95% ci
0.73-2.52, p = 0.34; homozygous model, 0.99, 95% ci 0.65-1.49, p = 0.95;
heterozygous model, 0.99, 95% ci 0.66-1.48, p = 0.94. similar results were
obtained subgroup analyses asian patients, chinese patients, patients
with hepatitis b virus (hbv)-related hcc. similar results also obtained 
the -607 polymorphism across entire study population well three 
subgroups. available evidence suggests significant association -137
or -607 polymorphisms risk hcc general specifically hbv-related 
hcc. conclusions verified large, well-designed studies.
