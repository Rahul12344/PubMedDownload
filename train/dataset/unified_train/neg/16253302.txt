hiv-1 nef affects trafficking numerous cellular proteins optimize viral
replication evade host defenses. adaptor protein (ap) complexes, which
form part cytoplasmic coat endosomal vesicles, key cellular
co-factors nef. nef binds complexes alters physiologic cycle 
of attachment release membranes. specifically, ap-1 normally
becomes cytosolic attachment events blocked inhibition gtpase 
cycle adp-ribosylation factor-1 (arf1), complex remains
membrane-associated nef-expressing cells. investigate mechanism this
effect, used permeabilized cell system detect de novo attachment of
exogenous ap-1 endosomal membranes. nef mediate de novo attachment
independently arf1, despite ability maintain association ap-1
with endosomal membranes activity arf1 blocked. conclude 
nef stabilizes ap complexes endosomal membranes arf1-dependent
attachment. stabilization may facilitate coat formation stimulate the
trafficking multiple cellular proteins.
