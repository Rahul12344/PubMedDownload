pigs united states exposed african swine fever (asf) virus
isolated pigs brazil dominican republic. former examined
for clinical response, lesions, viremia, antibody response. sequential blood 
samples tested presence asf virus hemadsorption test (in
swine buffy coat cell culture) antibody asf virus enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay. incubation period 3 5 days; inoculated pigs had
fever 8 16 days (mean 12.5 days) viremia 3 35 days after
inoculation died. inoculated pigs developed antibodies 7 days after
inoculation detectable termination experiment (10th
month). reinoculation surviving pigs homologous isolate
at approximately 6 months exposure induce clinical response,
viremia, anamnestic antibody response. contrast, challenge exposures of
convalescent pigs lisbon-60 viral strain approximately 5 weeks after
exposure brazilian strain produced death, spite anamnestic
antibody response.
