introduction middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov)
infection cause transmission clusters high mortality hemodialysis
facilities. attempted develop risk-prediction model assess early
risk mers-cov infection dialysis patients. methods two-center
retrospective cohort study included 104 dialysis patients suspected of
mers-cov infection diagnosed rrt-pcr september 2012 june
2016 king fahd general hospital jeddah king abdulaziz medical city in
riyadh. retrieved data demographic, clinical, radiological findings,
and laboratory indices patient. findings risk-prediction model to
assess early risk mers-cov dialysis patients developed.
independent predictors mers-cov infection identified, including chest
pain (or = 24.194; p = 0.011), leukopenia (or = 6.080; p = 0.049), elevated
aspartate aminotransferase (ast) (or = 11.179; p = 0.013). adequacy this
prediction model good (p = 0.728), high predictive utility (area under
curve [auc] = 76.99%; 95% ci: 67.05% 86.38%). prediction model 
optimism-corrected bootstrap resampling auc 71.79%. youden index yielded a
value 0.439 greater best cut-off high risk mers infection.
discussion risk-prediction model dialysis patients appears depend
markedly chest pain, leukopenia, elevated ast. model accurately
predicts high risk mers-cov infection dialysis patients. could 
clinically useful applying timely intervention control measures prevent
clusters infections dialysis facilities health care settings. 
predictive utility model warrants validation external samples
and prospective studies.
