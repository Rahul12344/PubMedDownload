background: novel influenza (h1n1) acute respiratory infectious disease. 
animal experiments indicated h1n1 virus infected early hosts, showed
strong cd4(+), cd8(+), cd4(+)cd25(+) cell reactions. aim study 
was investigate dynamic fluctuations peripheral blood lymphocyte
subgroups patients infected h1n1 swine-origin influenza virus (s-oiv).
methods: frequency cells, b cells, natural killer (nk) cells, and
regulatory cells (treg) 36 severe h1n1 40 moderate h1n1 patients were
detected different periods flow cytometry. parallel, serum cytokines
were detected enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay c-reactive protein (crp)
was analyzed image-type automatic biochemical analyzer. addition,
20 healthy volunteers, infected 2009 h1n1 virus, selected 
as controls.
results: frequency nk cells decreased cases cd19(+) b
cells increased severe cases controls. 1-2d from
onset, frequency cd4(+) cd4(+)cd25(+) cells moderate cases was
higher severe cases. serum cytokines, specifically il-2, il-4, il-6, 
il-10, ifn-Î³ exhibited significant change moderate the
severe cases whole monitoring process. early stage the
disease, serum crp levels severe moderate groups significantly
higher control group.
conclusions: patients showed different lymphocyte subgroup distributions 
mild severe cases, might affect incidence development 2009
h1n1.
