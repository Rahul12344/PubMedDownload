newcastle disease virus (ndv) field strain sqz04 isolated broiler
flock typical symptoms lesions, cloned plaque-purification three 
times. ndv sqz04 determined virulent strain mdt 50.5h 51.2h,
icpi 2.0 1.92, ivpi 2.8 2.68 respectively after
plaque-purification. analysis f gene indicated sqzo4 determined 
virulent gene type ii , protein amino acid sequence homologies of
99.3% , 98.7% 96.9% published gene type ii vaccine strains lasota, b1,
virulent strain taxas48,much higher homologies 88.3% - 88.6% 91.3% -
92.1% published gene types vi ix. first virulent field
strain gene type ui reported china. more, amino acid sequence
111 ggrqgrl117 f protein cleavage site sqz04 strain identical to
lentogenic strains ndv, vaccine strains lasota, b1. first 
report virulent ndv could lentogenic amino acid sequence the
cleavage site f protein, hn genes compared sqz04 higher
homologies 95.3%- 97.3% known velogenic strains, lower homologies 
87.8% - 89.5% published lentogenic strains.
