patients chronic hepatitis c sustained hepatitis c virus 
(hcv)-rna response serum alanine transaminase (alt) response 6-month
course interferon (ifn) may respond higher dose retreatment consensus 
interferon (cifn). nonresponders initial ifn treatment transient
response defined undetectable hcv rna normalization alt during
treatment, subsequently "breakthrough" still treatment. the
aim study determine nonresponders breakthroughs
responded differently cifn retreatment nonresponders without
breakthroughs using data large, multicenter trial. alt hcv rna were
monitored frequently initial ifn therapy (either 9 mcg cifn 3 mu
ifn-alpha2b 3 times per week). hcv-rna breakthroughs observed 86 467
(18%) treated patients, alt breakthroughs observed 90 467
(19%) treated patients. association breakthroughs and
the presence either binding neutralizing anti-ifn antibodies. the
patients nonresponders initial ifn treatment retreated cifn
(15 mcg) 12 months, 27% viral breakthroughs sustained
viral response compared 8% prior nonresponders without breakthroughs (p
=.102). sustained alt responses observed 39% breakthroughs compared 
with 10% without breakthroughs (p =.014). data suggest prior
nonresponders breakthroughs greater chance responding to
retreatment nonresponders without breakthroughs. however, most
breakthrough patients would missed unless repeated hcv-rna testing were
conducted therapy.
