context: population migration endemic areas newly instituted 
blood bank screening, us clinicians likely see increasing number of
patients suspected confirmed chronic trypanosoma cruzi infection (chagas 
disease).
objective: examine evidence base provide practical recommendations for
evaluation, counseling, etiologic treatment patients chronic cruzi 
infection. evidence acquisition literature review conducted based systematic
medline search available years 2007; review additional
articles, reports, book chapters; input experts field.
evidence synthesis: patient newly diagnosed chagas disease should
undergo medical history, physical examination, resting 12-lead
electrocardiogram (ecg) 30-second lead ii rhythm strip. evaluation
is normal, testing indicated; history, physical examination, and
ecg repeated annually. findings suggest chagas heart disease, a
comprehensive cardiac evaluation, including 24-hour ambulatory ecg monitoring,
echocardiography, exercise testing, recommended. gastrointestinal tract
symptoms present, barium contrast studies performed.
antitrypanosomal treatment recommended cases acute congenital
chagas disease, reactivated infection, chronic cruzi infection in
individuals 18 years younger. adults aged 19 50 years without advanced
heart disease, etiologic treatment may slow development progression of
cardiomyopathy generally offered; treatment considered optional 
for older 50 years. individualized treatment decisions adults
should balance potential benefit, prolonged course, frequent adverse
effects drugs. strong consideration given treatment of
previously untreated patients human immunodeficiency virus infection or
those expecting undergo organ transplantation.
conclusions: chagas disease presents increasing challenge clinicians in
the united states. despite gaps evidence base, current knowledge is
sufficient make practical recommendations guide appropriate evaluation,
management, etiologic treatment chagas disease.
