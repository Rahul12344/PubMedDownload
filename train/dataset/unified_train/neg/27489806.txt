purpose: development genetically modified live rabies vaccine applicable
to wild raccoon dogs necessary eradication rabies korea. thus,
we constructed recombinant rabies virus (rabv) called erags strain, using a
reverse genetic system evaluated safety efficacy mice its
safety immunogenicity raccoon dogs.
materials methods: erags, asn194ser arg333glu substitutions 
the glycoprotein, constructed using site-directed mutagenesis. mice were
inoculated erags strain (either 10(5.0) 10(7.0) faid50/ml) via
intramuscular (im) intracranial injections challenged virulent
rabv. raccoon dogs administered erags strain (10(8.0) faid50/ml) either 
orally via im route immunogenicity strain evaluated
using fluorescent antibody virus neutralization tests.
results: erags strain inoculated murine neuroblastoma cells reached
10(7.8) faid50/ml 96-hour post-inoculation. virus pathogenic and
induced complete protection virulent rabv immunized 4- 6-week-old
mice. korean raccoon dogs immunized erags strain via im oral route
were also safe virus developed high titer levels (26.4-32.8 iu/ml)
of virus-neutralizing antibody (vna) 4 weeks post-inoculation.
conclusion: erags rabv strain effectively protective rabies in
mice produced high vna titer raccoon dogs.
