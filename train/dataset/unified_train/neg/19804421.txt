interaction eph family receptor protein tyrosine kinases their
ligands, ephrin family members, induces bidirectional signaling cell-cell
contacts. high expression b-type ephrin associated high invasion
potential tumors, previously observed signaling the
c-terminus ephrin-b1 mediates migration invasion cells, is
involved promotion carcinomatous peritonitis vivo. show that
the intracellular introduction synthetic peptide derived ephrin-b1
c-terminus blocks ephrin-b1 mediated signaling scirrhous gastric cancer cells.
treatment cancer cells fusion peptide consisting hiv-tat amino
acids 331-346 ephrin-b1 (ptd-efnb1-c) suppressed activation rhoa,
mediated association ephrin-b1 adaptor protein dishevelled, and
also inhibited extracellular secretion metalloproteinase. moreover, injection 
of ptd-efnb1-c peptide peritoneal cavity nude mice suppressed
carcinomatous peritonitis intraperitoneally transplanted scirrhous gastric
cancer cells. results indicate possible application ephrin-b1
c-terminal peptide develop novel protein therapy scirrhous gastric
carcinoma, especially stage tumor progression, including peritoneal
dissemination.
