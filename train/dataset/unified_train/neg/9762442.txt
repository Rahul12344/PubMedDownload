a pyz series fission yeast expression vectors, derivatives prep series,
was designed allow positive identification cloned gene insertion fusion
to green fluorescent protein (gfp) gene vivo analysis gene
expression. validate new vector system, human immunodeficiency virus 
type 1 (hiv-1) vpr gene viral isolate pnl4-3 expressed pyz1n
vector. vpr-induced phenotypic changes observed vpr
expressed prep1n. consistent observations mammalian cells, vpr-gfp
fusion protein localizes nuclear membrane fission yeast cells.
additionally, able detect naturally occurring mixture vpr genes
from plasma sample hiv-infected pediatric long-term surviving patient.
these pyz vectors expedite gene cloning general purposes particularly
suited largescale random gene screening.
