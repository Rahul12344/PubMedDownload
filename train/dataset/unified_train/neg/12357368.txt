we studied eight patients characteristic features angio-immunoblastic t
cell lymphoma (aild-tl) associated 25% large b cells.
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis showed clonal rearrangement t
cell receptor (tcr)-gamma chain gene cases. one additional case showed a
clonal rearrangement tcr-beta chain gene southern blot hybridization.
pcr analysis showed clonal immunoglobulin rearrangement three cases
presenting 50% large b cells whereas cases a
germline configuration. 6/8 cases, double-labeling immunohistochemistry in
situ hybridization demonstrated epstein-barr virus (ebv) mostly present 
in large b cells also detected cells. evaluated 
frequency aild-tl 25% large b cells 106 cases

these patients differ significantly less 25% b

the possible association substantial numbers cd20(+), ebv(+) large b
cells. propose denominate cases 'aild-tl rich large b cells'
and consider different entity misdiagnosed a
reactive process cell rich b cell lymphoma.
