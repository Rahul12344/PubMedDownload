natural killer cell cytotoxicity (nkc) nonspecific, primary immunodefense
system active variety pathogens, including herpes simplex virus
(hsv). evidence suggests pregnancy, nkc attenuated. regulatory
mechanisms immune attenuation yet defined. examined two
cytokines (interleukin-2 [il-2] alpha interferon [ifn]) ability 
alter nkc responsiveness pregnancy, utilizing hsv-infected target cell 
model. peripheral mononuclear effector cells isolated 19 pregnant and
19 nonpregnant subjects ficoll-paque separation. cells incubated
with ifn, il-2, media alone, analyzed %nkc 18 h chromium release
assay. percentage nkc lower using effector cells pregnant
subjects compared nonpregnant controls. incubation either ifn il-2 
resulted significant augmentation nkc pregnant and
nonpregnant derived cells. differences il-2 dose requirements or
levels cytotoxicity achieved (43.1 +/- 6.8% vs. 44.4 +/- 6.8%, respectively)
between pregnant nonpregnant derived cells. ifn-mediated augmentation 
nkc somewhat blunted pregnancy terms absolute levels of
cytotoxicity achieved (26.1 +/- 3.9% vs. 37.2 +/- 4.9%, respectively) dose
response curves generated. results demonstrate nkc hsv
infected cells attenuated pregnancy immunoregulated the
use either ifn il-2. restoration nkc responsiveness ifn,
however, remains incomplete pregnancy, suggesting cytokine's
mechanism action differs il-2.
