background: many applications, efficient gene therapy require long-term,
organ-specific therapeutic gene expression. lentiviral vectors based hiv-1 are
promising gene delivery vehicles due ability integrate transgenes
into non-dividing cells. many experimental vectors express transgenes the
control cytomegalovirus (cmv) immediate-early gene promoter. although this
promoter directs strong gene expression vitro, may shut rapidly in
vivo. study explores potential hiv-1-based vectors transduce
hepatocytes compares gene expression different promoters integrated
vectors.
methods: hiv-1-based vector plasmids expressing green fluorescent protein
(gfp) control cmv promoter, alpha-1 antitrypsin gene
promoter promoters derived hepatitis b virus (hbv) genome used
to compare expression transfected transduced cell lines.
results: hepatocyte cell lines differed strikingly transfectability.
transduction replication-deficient hiv-1-based vector particles
incorporating different promoter elements uniformly effective in
hepatocyte non-hepatocyte lines. however, hepatocytes, cmv,
alpha-1 antitrypsin hbv core hbv surface promoters able to
produce gfp expression. addition hbv enhancer 2 element improved the
transducing ability hbv surface promoter suppressed expression in
non-hepatocytes increasing specificity hepatocytes.
conclusions: integrated lentiviral vectors used direct transgene
expression liver cells promiscuously specifically. promoters derived 
from alpha-1 antitrypsin gene hbv alternatives cmv promoter.
inclusion hbv enhancer 2 permits strong liver-specific gene expression 
vitro.
