this study aimed explore contribution high-mannose glycans the
masking conserved v3 crown (gpg) v2i epitopes hypervariable loops
of exposed distal surface hiv-1 env. using lectins specific manα1-2man
residue containing man6-9glcnac2 glycans extensively decorating hiv-1 env, we
found manα1-2man-binding lectins enhance exposure partially and
transiently exposed epitopes consequentially increase neutralization
strength antibodies epitopes.
