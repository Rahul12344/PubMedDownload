background: single-dose nevirapine (sd nvp) birth plus nvp prophylaxis the
infant 6 weeks age superior sd nvp alone prevention of
vertical transmission human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) through
breastfeeding. analyzed nvp resistance hiv-infected ugandan infants who
received either sd nvp extended nvp prophylaxis.
methods: tested plasma hiv using genotyping assay (viroseq; celera
diagnostics), phenotypic resistance assay (phenosense; monogram biosciences),
and sensitive point mutation assay (ligamp, k103n, y181c, g190a).
results: infants 6 weeks old, viroseq detected nvp resistance a
higher proportion infants extended nvp arm sd nvp arm (21
of 25 [84%] vs. 12 24 [50%]; p = .01). similar results obtained with
ligamp phenosense. study arms, infants hiv infected birth
frequently nvp resistance detected. contrast, infants extended nvp 
arm hiv infected birth likely resistance
detected 6 weeks, compared infants sd nvp arm. use extended
nvp prophylaxis also associated detection nvp resistance viroseq
at 6 months (7 7 [100%] infants extended nvp arm resistance
detected, compared 1 6 [16.7%] infants sd nvp arm; p = .005).
conclusions: use extended nvp prophylaxis associated increased
selection persistence nvp resistance hiv-infected ugandan infants.
