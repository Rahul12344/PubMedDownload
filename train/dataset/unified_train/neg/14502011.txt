objectives: investigate molecular epidemiology genetic structure of
hiv-1s causing epidemic central myanmar explore genesis hiv 
epidemic area.
design: molecular epidemiological investigation conducted 1999-2000 in
the city mandalay among high-risk populations structural features of
circulating hiv-1s analyzed.
methods: hiv-1 genotypes 59 specimens screened based gag (p17) env
(c2/v3) regions. near full-length nucleotide sequences hiv-1 isolates with
subtype discordance determined recombinant structures were
characterized.
results: three lineages hiv-1 strains, including crf01_ae (27, 45.8%), subtype
b' (thailand variant subtype b) (15, 25.4%) subtype c (8, 13.6%), were
distributed mandalay, substantial portions (9, 15.3%) specimens
showed various patterns subtype discordance different regions hiv-1
genomes. study six hiv-1 isolates subtype discordance revealed that
they highly diverse types unique recombinant forms (urfs) comprised of
various combinations three circulating subtypes. one urf particularly
complex mosaic contained 13 recombination breakpoints three hiv-1
subtypes. approximately half recombinants showed 'pseudotype' virion
structures, external portions envelope glycoproteins were
exchanged different lineages hiv-1 strains, suggesting potential
selective advantage 'pseudotype' viruses parental strains.
conclusion: study revealed unique geographical hot spot central
myanmar extensive recombination events appeared taking place
continually. reflects presence highly exposed individuals social 
networks hiv-1 transmission.
