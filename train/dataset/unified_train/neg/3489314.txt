inhibition cleavage moloney murine leukemia virus gag env coded
precursor polyproteins cerulenin.

cerulenin, inhibitor de novo fatty acid (and cholesterol) biosynthesis, has
been shown significantly decrease (greater 75%) amount moloney
murine leukemia virus (mmulv) released culture medium chronically
infected mouse fibroblasts (i. katoh, y. yoshinaka, r.b. luftig, 1986, virus 
res., press). order clarify mechanism decrease in
virus production occurs, analyzed kinetics gag env coded protein
synthesis m-mulv infected, cerulenin-treated cells immunoprecipitation with
monospecific antisera p30, p12, p10, gp70, p15(e). found pulse 
(15 min-2 hr)-chase (0-4 hr) experiments cleavage pr65gag p30 
and gag coded proteins pr80env gp70 pr15(e) well, greatly
reduced cerulenin treatment. further, since total amount label the
pr65gag pr80env bands remained slightly decreased in
2-hr pulsed, cerulenin-treated cells, suggests cerulenin decreases
virus production, part, inhibiting cleavage precursor gag and
env coded polyproteins virus assembly budding cell membrane. we
also observed longer chase periods (4 hr), effect cerulenin could 
be partially overriden minor amounts cleaved gag env coded
polyproteins produced assembled virion particles. however, these
particles contained abnormally large amounts uncleaved precursor pr65gag, 
suggesting maturation incomplete. results suggest two
independent, exclusive, possible mechanisms cerulenin action block 
m-mulv production, viz. cerulenin decreases pool fatty acids, thereby
inhibiting fatty acid acylation pr65gag, well pr80env, thus
preventing interaction gag (the p15 antigenic determinant pr65gag)
and env [the p15(e) antigenic determinant pr15(e)] coded gene products 
cell membrane needed efficient virus assembly (m. satake r. b. luftig,
1983, virology 124, 259-273), cerulenin inhibits one proteolytic
enzymes responsible cleavage pr65gag pr80env.
