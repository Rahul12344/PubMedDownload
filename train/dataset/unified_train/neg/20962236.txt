human immunodeficiency virus-associated neurological disease (hand) still causes 
significant morbidity, despite success reducing viral loads combination
antiretroviral therapy. dopamine (da) system particularly vulnerable in
hand. hypothesize early, "reversible" daergic synaptic dysfunction occurs
long daergic neuron loss. such, aging human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv)-infected individuals may vulnerable age-related
neurodegenerative diseases like parkinson's disease (pd), underscoring need
to understand shared molecular targets hand pd. previously, reported
that neurotoxic hiv-1 transactivating factor (tat) acutely disrupts
mitochondrial endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis via ryanodine
receptor (ryr) activation. here, report tat disrupts da
transporter (dat) activity function, resulting increased plasma membrane
(pm) dat increased dat v(max), without changes k(m) total dat protein. 
tat also increases calpain protease activity pm, demonstrated total
internal reflection fluorescence microscopy cleavable fluorescent calpain
substrate. tat-increased pm dat calpain activity blocked ryr
antagonists ryanodine dantrolene, calpain inhibitor calpastatin, a
specific inhibitor gsk-3β. conclude tat activates ryrs via calcium- 
and calpain-mediated mechanism upregulates dat trafficking pm, is
independent dat protein synthesis, reinforcing feasibility ryr and
gsk-3β inhibition clinical therapeutic approaches hand. finally, we
provide key translational relevance findings highlighting published 
human data increased dat levels striata hand patients by
demonstrating similar findings tat-expressing transgenic mice.
