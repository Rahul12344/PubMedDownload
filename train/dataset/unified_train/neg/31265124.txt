kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) epstein-barr virus (ebv) are
prevalent sub-saharan africa, together hiv; consequent burden of
disease grave. cofactors driving transmission two viruses and
pathogenesis associated malignancies well understood. measured kshv
and ebv dna whole blood saliva well serum antibodies levels 175
cameroonians kaposi's sarcoma 1,002 age- sex-matched controls with
and without hiv. kshv seroprevalence high (81%) controls, ebv
seroprevalence 100% overall. kshv dna detectable blood 36-46%
of cases 6-12% controls; ebv dna detected participants
(72-89%). saliva, cases (50-58%) controls (25-28%) shed kshv,
regardless hiv infection. ebv shedding common (75-100%); hiv+ than
hiv- controls shed ebv. cases higher kshv ebv vl blood saliva then
controls, among hiv+ participants. kshv ebv vl also higher hiv+ 
than hiv- controls. cases (but controls) likely have
detectable kshv blood also ebv, whereas shedding virus 
saliva independent. ebv vl saliva blood modestly
correlated, correlation existed kshv. numerous factors, several related to
parasitic coinfections, associated detection either virus with
vl. findings may help better understand interplay two
gammaherpesviruses generally among copathogens contributing cancer burden 
in sub-saharan africa.
