although efficiency retrovirus-mediated gene delivery enhanced by
several physicochemical approaches reported (e.g., addition polycations and
spinoculation), systematic analysis retroviral transduction combined with
experimental data remains challenged. aid reasonable
mathematical description experimental system, therefore predict 
optimize retroviral gene delivery quantitative basis understanding.
in study, formulated mathematical model involved diffusion, decay 
and uptake retroviral vectors onto target cells resided solid culture
surface. model solved analytically laplace transform method. the
analytical solutions fitted experimental data compute two
unknown parameters: concentration infectious retrovirus transduction rate 
constant. results showed concentration infectious retrovirus
determined titration method approximately hundred-fold lower 
one calculated fitting experimental data mathematical solutions. more
importantly, effects polycation (i.e., polybrene) ex vivo retroviral
transduction illustrated quantitative way estimating the
transduction rate constant, represents reliable parameter to
determine degree transduction retroviral vector given target
cell.
