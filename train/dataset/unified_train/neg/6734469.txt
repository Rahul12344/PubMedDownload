the entity chronic hepatitis long enigma, treatment
confusing. recent studies indicated importance excluding causes 
as drugs, wilson's disease alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. excluding
such causes, 3 major groups--'autoimmune', hepatitis b, non-a,
non-b (nanb) immunological basis pathogenesis exists. 
autoimmune group subdivided milder type (chronic persistent
hepatitis) severe type (chronic active hepatitis) histological
grounds. corticosteroids indicated chronic active hepatitis cirrhosis
or bridging necrosis present. however, corticosteroids contraindicated 
disease due hepatitis b virus chronic active hepatitis correlates
with presence replicating virus (serum positive e antigen, dna
polymerase hbv-dna), cases antiviral agents immunomodulation 
are studied. little known nanb hepatitis absence an
assay may single agent. hepatitis b, development 
of serological markers, molecular probes (hbv-dna), natural animal hepatitis with
near-identical viruses, delta antigen (a virus requiring co-infection with
hepatitis b) extended knowledge dramatically hoped
that enigma chronic hepatitis solved assay nanb
hepatitis becomes available.
