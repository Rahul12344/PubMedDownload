cell counts > =300 cells/mm3 randomly assigned receive
antiretroviral therapy without intermittent subcutaneously administered
recombinant interleukin-2 (ril-2). identify factors associated response
to il-2, secondary analysis performed included subset ril-2
recipients able complete 3 initial treatment cycles. predictors
of change cd4+ cell count baseline 1 month start of
treatment cycle 3 examined multivariate model included sex, race, 
body surface area, ril-2 dose, hiv load, baseline nadir cd4+ cell
count. combination race sex (p=.027) nadir cd4+ cell count

cd4+ cell count cd4+ cell count response suggests immunologic losses
resulting hiv-mediated cd4+ cell depletion may irreversible.
