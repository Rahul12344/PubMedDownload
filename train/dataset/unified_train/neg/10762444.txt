the ability japanese encephalitis virus (jev) jev-induced macrophage
derived neutrophil chemotactic factor (mdf) produce nitric oxide (no), the
possible antiviral effect jev infection, investigated. splenic
macrophages jev infected mice produced maximum vivo day 7 post
infection, vitro 24 h jev stimulation. mdf-induced production 
was dose dependent maximal 60 min mdf treatment. response was
sensitive anti-mdf antibody treatment nitric oxide synthase inhibitor 
ng-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-nmma). pretreatment mice l-nmma increased the
mortality 100% jev infected mice vivo inhibited production in
vitro, mdf stimulated macrophages inhibited virus replication high
levels production. mdf treatment increased survival rate jev
infected mice. findings thus demonstrate mdf induces production no
during jev infection, antiviral effect. may one the
important mechanisms natural immunity controlling initial stages jev
infection.
