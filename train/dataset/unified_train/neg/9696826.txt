replication-defective adenovirus (ad) vectors used gene transfer to
the respiratory epithelium experimental animals individuals cystic
fibrosis. studies several laboratories suggested administration of
first-generation ad vectors results transient gene expression the
lung, due least part destruction vector-transduced cells host
cellular immune responses directed viral proteins and/or immunogenic
transgene products. constructed new ad2-based, e1-deleted vectors
encoding weakly immunogenic transgene, human cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (hcftr) control cytomegalovirus
enhancer-promoter. vectors contain wild-type e2 e4 regions. new
ad/cftr vectors instilled lungs immunocompetent c57bl/6, balb/c,
and c3h mice. vitro cytotoxic lymphocyte (ctl) analysis indicated the
presence ad-specific ctls treated mice. however, able to
demonstrate ctl response specific hcftr. reverse transcriptase pcr analysis
demonstrated hcftr mrna expression continued three strains mice
for least 70 days, last time point analyzed. e3 region play 
significant role persistence ad/cftr vectors mouse lung.
functional hcftr expression also observed nasal epithelia cf mutant
mice. results suggest long-term expression hcftr possible the
airway epithelia immunocompetent mice without radical modification ad
