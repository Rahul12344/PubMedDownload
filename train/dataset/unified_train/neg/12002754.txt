early epidemiologic studies shown increased risk kaposi sarcoma (ks)
in recipients solid organ transplants, ks exceptional setting 
of autologous allogeneic bone marrow (bm) peripheral blood stem cell
(pbsc) transplant patients. recent discovery human herpesvirus 8 (hhv-8)
as necessary etiologic agent ks stimulated studies assess whether
ks result hhv-8 transmission donor reactivation a
pre-existing hhv-8 infection recipient host. association hhv-8
infection lymphoid neoplasias also observed, identifying this
herpesvirus possible causal agent epstein-barr virus negative
post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases. recent description of
non-neoplastic complications associated hhv-8 reactivation autologous

pbsc transplantation. issue hhv-8 transmission grafts, the
problems inherent diagnosis monitoring active viral infection,
