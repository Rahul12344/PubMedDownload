six vitro-fertilized ova cultured 10 13 days vitro. six had
formed blastocysts cavities, five hatched zona pellucida, and
one attached substrate. fixation preparation examination
by light electron microscopy, determined youngest
blastocysts developed substantial amounts syncytial trophoblast, which
morphologically resembled syncytial trophoblast present first 2 days
of implantation vivo. one smaller blastocysts developed syncytial
trophoblast hatched zona. blastocysts showed
indications loss inadequate development inner cell mass
constituents, indicating culture conditions suboptimal these
constituents. apparent c-type virus particles abundant, budding the
basal surface syncytial trophoblast. type trophoblast
formed normally associated epithelial invasion formation the
trophoblast plate, suggested blastocysts would useful in
vitro implantation studies well studies formation syncytial
trophoblast. however, methods developed study of
postimplantation embryo development. also noted inadequate
differentiation epiblast endoderm would apparent without
microscopic examination.
