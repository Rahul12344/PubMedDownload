infection t-lymphocytes macrophages human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) 
is mediated binding hiv envelope glycoprotein cell-surface
receptor glycoprotein cd4. soluble, recombinant cd4 molecule (rcd4), produced
by expression truncated cd4 gene chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells [smith
et al. (1987) science 238, 1704-1707], clinical trials potential
therapeutic agent treatment acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). 
in present study, structures asn-linked oligosaccharides of
soluble rcd4 elucidated. rcd4 molecule two potential sites 
n-glycosylation, asn-271 asn-300. tryptic glycopeptides containing either 
the sites purified reversed-phase hplc, oligosaccharides were
released enzymatically. structures oligosaccharides determined by
methylation analysis, high-ph anion-exchange chromatography, fast-atom
bombardment mass spectrometry, 1h nmr spectroscopy 500 mhz. asn-271 was
found carry diantennary n-acetyllactosamine-type ("complex") oligosaccharides,
of 8% asialo, 55% monosialyl, 37% disialyl.
approximately 18% structures contained fucose alpha(1-->6) linked the
reducing glcnac residue. two different hybrid structures found account
for 34% oligosaccharides attached asn-300. remainder the
oligosaccharides attached asn-300 diantennary n-acetyllactosamine-type,
of 10% asialo, 61% monosialyl, 29% disialyl.
approximately 9% hybrid structures 40% n-acetyllactosamine
structures asn-300 found contain fucose alpha(1-->6) linked the
innermost glcnac residue.
