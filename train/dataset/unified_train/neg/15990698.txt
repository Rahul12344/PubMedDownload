cachexia, loss skeletal muscle, adipose tissue immunological
competence, common systemic condition advanced cases cancer, 
frequent cause death. many reports small peptides
isolated tumors induce systemic effects correlated cachexia upon
injection mice addition cell cultures. recently evidence been
presented origin peptides large increase proteolytic
enzymes found tumors. additional evidence presented major role
of tumor peptides producing effects associated cachexia. peptides of
low molecular weight found produce lipolysis adipose tissue.
fibrinogen degradation products plasma cancer patients other
chronic diseases suppress activation immune response. proteases of
the cathepsin class occur high concentration surface transformed
cells ph low enough allow digestion pericellular proteins;
other cathepsins elevated tumors highly active physiological ph.
cathepsin l major excreted protein cultured cells transformed by
viruses chemicals likely form toxic peptides digestion of
extracellular proteins. even normal liver skeletal muscle cancer
patients tumor-bearing animals exhibit significant increases cathepsins
and components ubiquitin-proteasesome pathway would add to
circulating peptides. observations argue central role multiple
proteases proteolytic products producing debilitating systemic
effects cancer.
