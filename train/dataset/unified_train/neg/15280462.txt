enveloped viruses enter cells fusion membrane cellular
membrane. incorporation inverted-cone-shaped lipids as
lysophosphatidylcholine (lpc) outer leaflet target membranes been
shown previously impair fusion mediated class viral fusion proteins,
e.g., influenza virus hemagglutinin. suggested results
provide evidence stalk-pore model fusion, involves hemifusion 
intermediate (stalk) highly bent outer membrane leaflets. here, we
investigated effect inverted-cone-shaped lpcs cone-shaped oleic
acid (oa) membrane fusion activity virus class ii fusion
protein, flavivirus tick-borne encephalitis virus (tbev). study included
an analysis lipid mixing, well steps preceding accompanying
fusion, i.e., binding target membrane lipid-induced conformational
changes fusion protein e. show presence lpc outer
leaflet target liposomes strongly inhibited tbev-mediated fusion, whereas oa
caused slight enhancement, consistent fusion mechanism involving 
lipid stalk. however, lpc also impaired low-ph-induced binding soluble
form e protein liposomes conversion trimeric postfusion 
structure requires membrane binding low ph. inhibition already
observed lipid-mixing step, cannot determined whether impairment
of stalk formation contributing factor inhibition fusion lpc.
these data emphasize, however, importance composition target
membrane interactions fusion peptide crucial the
initiation fusion.
