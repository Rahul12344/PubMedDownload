purpose: investigate cytokines chemokines involved the
immunopathogenesis acute retinal necrosis (arn), whether cytokine profiles
are associated clinical manifestations, visual outcome.
methods: serum aqueous humor (ah) samples 19 patients arn were
analyzed multiplex immunoassay. infectious controls consisted 18 patients
with rubella virus-associated fuchs' uveitis 20 patients ocular
toxoplasmosis confirmed intraocular fluid analyses. control group
consisted seven paired ah serum samples seven noninflammatory control
patients age-related cataract. sample, 4 anti-inflammatory, 12
proinflammatory, 2 vascular, 4 immune mediators measured. in
addition, various clinical characteristics assessed.
results: arn, 10 22 mediators, including proinflammatory and
vascular mediators il-6, il-8, il-18, mif, mcp-1, eotaxin, ip-10, il-15, 
sicam-1, svcam-1, significantly elevated compared controls. 
in addition, one anti-inflammatory mediator (il-10) significantly elevated in
arn compared controls. association found time of
sampling extent levels immune mediator expression.
conclusions: pathogenesis arn characterized presence of
predominantly proinflammatory cytokines chemokines high expression
levels compared infectious causes uveitis. no
indications obvious th-1 th-17 pathway. combined data suggest 
immune mediator expression related severity disease, more
fulminant arn, rather specific uveitis entity.
