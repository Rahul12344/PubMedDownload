background: elite controllers suppressors remarkable capacity to
maintain hiv-1 plasma rna levels limit detection clinical assays 
(<50 copies/ml) without therapy lower frequency latently infected
cells compared chronic progressors. unclear reduced
seeding reservoir achieved, possible effective ctl responses
play important role limiting size latent reservoir.
results: herein, demonstrate primary cd8+ cells hla-b*57/5801
elite suppressors able efficiently eliminate resting activated
primary cd4+ cells shortly viral entry prior productive infection.
cd8+ cells elite suppressors significantly effective at
eliminating cells cd8+ cells chronic progressors.
conclusions: nonproductively infected cd4+ cells may represent subpopulation 
of cells precursors latently infected cells; therefore, effective
elimination cells may partially explain elite suppressors a
much lower frequency latently infected cells compared chronic progressors. 
thus, vaccine strategy elicits early potent cd8+ cell responses may 
have capacity limit seeding latent reservoir hiv-1
infection.
