background: range nucleic acid-based technologies molecular
detection pathogens grown rapidly recent years. influx new
testing methods clinical laboratory, demands evaluation and
standardisation methods, interpretation results evaluation of
laboratory performance highlighted need internal external
quality assessment (eqa) systems ever before. external quality
assessment panels demand reproducible, stable specimens consistent form,
suitable transportation.
objectives: determine stability freeze-dried viral specimens terms
of molecular detection.
study design: eqa specimens prepared, undergo long-term storage and
testing part quality control (qc) process. frequency nature 
testing dependent resources methodologies available time. 
range virus preparations used eqa monitored period months to
years retrospective study; available quality monitoring data the
five viruses, including storage temperature method detection were
analysed.
results: nucleic acid (dna rna) freeze-dried viruses included in
the study readily detectable long period time. quantitative
analysis indicated detectable concentrations nucleic acid post-freeze
drying similarly maintained. storage temperature important factor 
the stability hcv, viruses unaffected storage different
temperatures.
conclusions: summary, molecular detection nucleic acid (dna rna) 
freeze-dried specimens hsv1, hsv2, hbv, hcv hiv possible even after
prolonged storage, cases range temperatures. freeze drying allows
large-scale production viral specimens high quality eqa, are
stable varying storage shipment conditions. furthermore, detection each
virus possible range commonly used molecular diagnostic methods.
