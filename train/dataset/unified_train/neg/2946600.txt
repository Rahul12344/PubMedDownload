the prevalence serologic evidence hepatitis b virus infection various
populations greece examined provide data formulating cost-effective
strategies prevaccination screening. markers detected 17.5% 320
healthy persons, 73.3% 273 multiply transfused patients 61.0% 146
haemodialysis patients. multiply transfused patients, antibody hepatitis b 
surface antigen (anti-hbs) significantly common antibody core
antigen (anti-hbc) (67.0%, 44.3%), opposite true haemodialysis 
patients (43.8%, 57.5%). data suggest may cost-effective to
screen anti-hbs multiply transfused patients anti-hbc in
haemodialysis patients. vaccination without screening may cost-effective 
for healthy persons. anti-hbs anti-hbc detected similar frequencies
(14.7%, 15.9%), thus neither offers advantage screening healthy persons,
although use anti-hbc may facilitate detection chronic carriers. data
indicate choice marker pre-vaccination screening depend on
the population consideration.
