objectives/background: sequence variants hpv16 confer differences oncogenic
potential; however, date hpv sequence studies
performed nepal. objective study characterize hpv16 viral
genome sequences nepal compared reference sequence order to
determine lineages. additionally, sought determine five high-grade
squamous intraepithelial lesion (hsil) subjects genetically distinct from
the non-hsil subjects.
methods: dna isolated exfoliated cervical cells 17 individuals in
nepal previously identified hpv16-positive. custom hpv16 ion
ampliseq panel multiplexed degenerate primers designed generated 47
overlapping amplicons covered 99% viral genome known hpv16
variant lineages. sequence data processed custom quality
control analysis pipeline sequence comparisons phylogenetic analysis.
results: high similarities across genomes, two major indels
observed non-coding region e5 l2. compared pave
reference hpv16 genome, 9, 4, 38, 27, 8, 7, 52, 32
nucleotide variants e6, e7, e1, e2, e4, e5, l2, l1 genes the
nepalese samples, respectively. based sequence variation, hpv16 nepal
falls across a, c, lineages study. found evidence of
genetic distinctness hsil non-hsil subjects.
conclusions: evolutionary pathological characteristics the
representative hpv16 genomes nepal seem similar results parts 
of world provide basis studies.
