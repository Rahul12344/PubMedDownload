phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type iiia (pi4kiiiα) one four mammalian pi
4-kinases catalyzes first committed step polyphosphoinositide
synthesis. pi4kiiiα linked regulation er exit sites the
synthesis plasma membrane phosphoinositides recent studies also
revealed importance replication hepatitis c virus liver. two
isoforms mammalian pi4kiiiα described annotated genbank: 
a larger, ~230kda (isoform 2) shorter splice variant containing the
~97kda c-terminus includes catalytic domain (isoform 1). however,
northern analysis human tissues cancer cells showed single
transcript ~7.5kb exception proerythroleukemia line k562,
which contained significantly higher level 7.5kb transcript along with
smaller ones 2.4, 3.5 4.2kb size. bioinformatic analysis also confirmed
the high copy number pi4kiiiα transcript k562 cells along several
genes located region chr22, including two pseudogenes cover
most exons coding isoform 1, consistent chromosome amplification. a
panel polyclonal antibodies raised peptides within c-terminal half
of pi4kiiiα failed detect shorter isoform 1 either cos-7 cells k562 
cells. moreover, expression cdna encoding isoform 1 yielded protein of
~97kda showed catalytic activity failed rescue hepatitis c virus
replication. data draw attention pi4kiiiα one genes found in
chr22q11, region affected chromosomal instability, substantiate
the existence functionally relevant short form pi4kiiiα.
