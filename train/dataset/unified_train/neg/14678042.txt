post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (ptld) grave complication of
transplantation result uncontrolled proliferation b lymphocytes
infected epstein-barr virus (ebv). herein assess whether ebv infects
renal grafts whether relationship ebv kidney infection and
ptld. allograft biopsies 23 patients ptld studied presence
of ebv dna rna (eber-1, -2) situ hybridization cd21 by
immunohistochemistry. results compared 43 transplants people without
ptld. ebv dna rna detected 11/43 patients without ptld (26%), 
15/23 (65%) patients ptld (p = 0.004). ebv dna rna localized proximal
tubular cells cells showed up-regulation ebv receptor cd21.
ebv-infected allografts noted 12/12 patients ptld located near the
allograft 3/11 (27%) patients ptld distant graft.
multiple biopsies eight patients showed graft ebv infection precede
the diagnosis ptld long 42 months. concluded ebv can
infect kidney allografts, appears relationship this
infection presence ptld near graft.
