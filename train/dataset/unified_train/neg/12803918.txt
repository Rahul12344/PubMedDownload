numerous cell membrane associated processes, including signal transduction,
membrane sorting, protein processing virus trafficking take place membrane
subdomains. protein-protein interactions provide frameworks necessary to
generate biologically functional membrane domains. example, coat proteins
define membrane areas destined sorting processes, viral proteins
self-assemble generate budding virus, adapter molecules organize
multimolecular signalling assemblies, catalyse downstream reactions. the
concept raft lipid-based membrane domains provides different principle for
compartmentalization segregation membrane constituents. accordingly, rafts
are defined physical properties lipid bilayer function by
selective partitioning membrane lipids proteins membrane domains of
specific phase behaviour lipid packing. here, discuss interplay of
these independent principles protein scaffolds raft lipid microdomains
leading generation biologically functional membrane domains.
