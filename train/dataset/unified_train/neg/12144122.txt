infectious agents, herpesviruses, hypothesized involved
in development atheromatous plaque. study aim evaluate the
possibility hhv-8 infection could additional risk factor the
establishment cardiovascular disease. hhv-8 seroprevalence determined by
immunofluorescence population cardiovascular disease patients (n=50) as
compared age- sex-matched group control subjects (n=47); hhv-8
genome detected dna extracted circulating pbmc atheromatous 
lesions pcr primers specific minor virus capsid gene (orf 26).
the seroprevalence hhv-8 significantly increased patients as
compared control population, presence hhv-8 genome was
observed pbmc 2 patients 1 control. virus-specific dna found 2
out 4 atheromatous plaques. higher seroprevalence patients suffering
from vascular diseases compared age-and sex-matched controls suggests 
hhv-8 infection could additional risk factor establishment of
cardiovascular disease, although data persistence viral dna pbmc
or arterial lesions exiguous definitively support this
hypothesis. extensive studies needed define exact role hhv-8
infection establishment progression atheromatous lesions.
