simultaneous initiation synthesis bacteriophage t4 dna of
deoxyribonucleotides.

chiu cs, tomich pk, greenberg gr.

in earlier reports suggested bacteriophate t4 dna replication occurs
in complex composed proteins required polymerization system 
of enzymes synthesizing deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate precursors dna.
t4-induced dcmp hydroxymethylase dtmp synthetase, though demonstrable in
extracts soon infection, active vivo 5 min. in
vivo activities increase exponentially approximately 15 min become
constant. suggested exponential period represents formation 
of complexes. paper shows initiation dna synthesis of
the two deoxyribonucleotide-synthesizing activities occurs simultaneously and
with coinciding exponential kinetics. vivo activities two enzymes
were tested infection number t4 amber dna- mutants. their
activities essentially unchanged compared wild-type phage, except 
infection mutants gene 43 (t4 dna nucleotidyltransferase dna
polymerase). mutants rate increase dtmp synthetase dcmp 
hydroxymethylase activities always substantially lower infection
by wild-type phage. proposed intimate interaction occurs between
t4-induced dna polymerase complex enzymes forming 5-hydroxymethyl-dcmp
and dtmp.
