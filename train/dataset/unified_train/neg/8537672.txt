disseminated mycobacterium avium complex (mac) infection associated with
considerable morbidity mortality patients aids. tumor
necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 (1,25d) may be
involved normal control mac infection, parameters studied in
aids patients disseminated mac infection. 53 aids patients studied, 24
had clinical events, 11 disseminated mac infection, 18 other
clinical events. patients disseminated mac infection significantly
higher serum levels tnf-alpha soluble tnf receptors compared with
other aids patients; almost half mac-infected patients tnf bioactivity
in serum. mac-infected patients also severely decreased serum 1,25d levels
compared aids patients. activation tnf system was
significantly correlated degree 1,25d deficiency. findings may 
reflect interaction vitamin tnf system pathophysiology
of disseminated mac infection aids.
