milk fat encapsulated milk fat globule membrane (mfgm) contains
bioactive glycoproteins glycolipids. mfgm inhibits infectivity of
rotavirus (rv), activity attributed glycoprotein and
carbohydrate components. however, previous studies proteins and
oligosaccharides mgfm accounted bioactivity
associated complete mfgm. lipid fraction mfgm accounts for
half composition weight, postulate fraction 
tested determine plays role antiviral activity. herein,
the anti-rv activity organic extract mfgm tested. natural whey
buttermilk powders containing bovine mfgm enriched polar lipids prepared 
by microfiltration supercritical fluid extraction treatment reduce the
triglyceride content powders. lipid fractions extracted the
mfgm using single- dual-phase extraction methods. whole mfgm organic
extracts screened ma-104 cells anti-infective activity a
neuraminidase-sensitive rotavirus using focus-forming unit assay.
dose-dependent inhibition observed whole buttermilk cheese whey mfgm 
against rotavirus. general, buttermilk mfgm exhibited greater rv
percentage inhibition cheese whey mfgm. organic-soluble anti-rv compounds
were identified bovine mfgm. active fraction, isolated dual-phase 
extraction iatrobead chromatography, free proteins highly
nonpolar. separation fraction less polar solvent (30:1
chloroform:methanol) resolved least 5 lipid-containing compounds, likely
contribute anti-rv activity associated bovine mfgm. summary, lipid
components associated mfgm appear contribute large part anti-rv
activity associated bovine mfgm.
