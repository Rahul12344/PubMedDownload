in patients infected hiv, high-grade b-cell non-hodgkin's lymphomas (nhl),
including small noncleaved cell (sncc) category, exhibit pleomorphic
features, makes precise definition difficult. sixty-nine pathologic
specimens hiv-related systemic lymphomas, including 42 sncc, 20
immunoblastic lymphomas (ibl), 7 cases features "intermediate" between
sncc ibl morphologically immunophenotypically investigated. host
immune status also analyzed 57 69 patients. 29 representative sncc
lymphomas, 9 ibl cases, additional 3 intermediate lymphomas, p53
protein overexpression association epstein-barr virus (ebv) genetic
information assessed. small noncleaved cell lymphomas included tumors
exhibiting features 2 established subtypes (27 burkitt's 15
non-burkitt's). seven intermediate cases, cells showed features
intermediate sncc plasmablastic differentiation immunoblasts
plasmacytoid. immunoblast-like cells also present. p53 protein
overexpression ebv association found proportion sncc (14 29; 
7 29) intermediate (3 3; 2 3) lymphomas. conversely, ibl cases 
consistently p53 negative, showed high ebv association (7 9). the
evaluated patients intermediate lymphomas considerably lower mean
(76.6 per mm3 +/- 77.4 sd) median (54 per mm3) number cd4+ lymphocyte
count sncc patients (mean 227.9 per mm3 +/- 186.9 sd, median 193 per mm3),
thus mirroring ibl patients (mean 95.3 per mm3 +/- 82.8 sd, median 81 per mm3).
all data provide evidence lymphomas showing intermediate features constitute
a distinct subgroup either sncc ibl.
