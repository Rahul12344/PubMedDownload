drug abuse major comorbidity hiv infection cognitive disorders are
often severe drug abusing hiv infected population. cd14+cd16+
monocytes, mature subpopulation peripheral blood monocytes, key
mediators hiv neuropathogenesis. infected cd14+cd16+ monocyte transmigration
across blood brain barrier mediates hiv entry brain establishes 
a viral reservoir within cns. despite successful antiretroviral therapy,
continued influx cd14+cd16+ monocytes, infected uninfected,
contributes chronic neuroinflammation development hiv associated
neurocognitive disorders (hand). drug abuse increases extracellular dopamine in
the cns. brain, cd14+cd16+ monocytes exposed extracellular 
dopamine due drug abuse. direct effects dopamine cd14+cd16+
monocytes contribution hiv neuropathogenesis known. 
study, showed cd14+cd16+ monocytes express mrna five dopamine
receptors qrt-pcr d1r, d5r d4r surface protein flow cytometry.
dopamine d1-like dopamine receptor agonist, skf38393, increased
cd14+cd16+ monocyte migration characterized chemokinesis. to
determine whether dopamine affected cell motility adhesion, live cell imaging
was used monitor accumulation cd14+cd16+ monocytes surface 
tissue culture dish. dopamine increased number rate which
cd14+cd16+ monocytes suspension settled dish surface. spreading
assay, dopamine increased area cd14+cd16+ monocytes early
stages cell adhesion. addition, adhesion assays showed overall
total number adherent cd14+cd16+ monocytes increased presence of
dopamine. data suggest elevated extracellular dopamine cns of
hiv infected drug abusers contributes hiv neuropathogenesis increasing 
accumulation cd14+cd16+ monocytes dopamine rich brain regions.
