hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hct) survivors less likely than
matched healthy controls mount strong immune response trivalent
inactivated influenza vaccine (tiv). high-dose (hd) standard-dose (sd) tiv
were given adult hct subjects 18 years older least 6 months after
transplantation. subjects randomized 2:1 receive either hd (60 μg
hemagglutinin [ha]/strain/dose) sd (15 μg ha/strain/dose) tiv.
injection-site systemic reactions documented vaccination 
immune responses measured vaccination. total 44
subjects enrolled (25 year 1 19 year 2), 15 sd group
and 29 hd group. median time vaccination transplantation 
7.9 months (range, 6 106 months), median age 50 years (range, 19.6 
73 years), 61% male. differences demographic lab data were
noted groups; however, hd group higher median baseline total igg 
level (676 versus 469 mg/dl, p = .025). differences individual
injection-site systemic reactions noted groups; however, more
events injection-site symptom combined reported hd group. no
serious adverse events attributed vaccination. vaccination, hd 
group higher percentage individuals titers ≥1:40 higher
geometric mean titer (gmt) h3n2 strain compared sd
group. hd sd tiv found safe well tolerated adult hct
recipients. however, hd group higher frequency injection-site
reactions majority reactions mild resolved. hd group 
had higher percentage individuals post-vaccination titer ≥ 1:40 gmt
for h3n2 antigen, indicating better immunogenicity. data support need
for phase ii immunogenicity trial hct recipients.
