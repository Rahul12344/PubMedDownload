genetic variation dengue 2 isolates various geographic areas examined
by oligonucleotide fingerprinting 40 genome rna. oligonucleotide maps of
geographically isolated epidemiologically unrelated viruses very
distinct. direct comparison oligonucleotide map dengue 2 prototype 
new guinea 2 virus, isolated 1944, fingerprints recent
isolates south pacific indicated genome dengue 2 virus had
undergone extensive change although viruses serologically
indistinguishable. oligonucleotide map isolate recent case in
jamaica mosquito isolate upper volta, africa, recognized be
almost identical, suggesting virus may introduced the
caribbean west africa. likewise, fingerprints isolates puerto
rico south pacific shared 80 95% large oligonucleotides,
suggesting virus involved epidemics may spread throughout 
tahiti, american samoa, fiji, puerto rico caribbean vice versa. 
on basis studies, five genetic variants topotypes dengue 2
virus established: (1) puerto rico-south pacific, (2) burma-thailand,
(3) seychelles, (4) philippines, (5) jamaica-west africa.
oligonucleotide fingerprinting offers highly sensitive reproducible
technical approach investigation dengue 2 virus intratypic variation
and possibly understanding biological variation associated with
dengue fever hemorrhagic disease.
