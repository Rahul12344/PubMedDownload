use perfluorochemical liquids intratracheal vector administration
enhances recombinant adenovirus adeno-associated virus (aav)-mediated lung
epithelial gene expression. hypothesized inhalation nebulized
perfluorochemical vapor would also enhance epithelial gene expression after
subsequent intratracheal vector administration. freely breathing adult c57bl/6
mice exposed selected times nebulized perflubron sterile saline in
a sealed plexiglas chamber. recombinant adenoviral vector administered by
transtracheal puncture selected times afterward mice killed 3 days
after vector administration assess transgene expression. mice tolerated the
nebulized perflubron without obvious ill effects. vector administration 6 hr
after nebulized perflubron exposure resulted average 540% increase gene 
expression airway alveolar epithelium, compared vector
alone saline plus vector control (p<0.05). however, vector administration 1
hr, 1 day, 3 days perflubron exposure different either
nebulized saline vector vector alone 60-min exposure nebulized
perflubron required. parallel pilot studies macaques, inhalation of
nebulized perflubron enhanced recombinant aav2/5 vector expression throughout the
lung. serial chest radiographs, bronchoalveolar lavages, results complete 
blood counts serum biochemistries demonstrated obvious adverse effects 
nebulized perflubron. further, one macaque receiving nebulized perflubron only
was monitored 1 year obvious adverse effects exposure. these
results demonstrate inhalation nebulized perflubron, simple, clinically
more feasible technique intratracheal administration liquid perflubron,
safely enhances lung gene expression.
