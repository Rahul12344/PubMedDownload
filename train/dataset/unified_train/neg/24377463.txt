the present study found supercritical fluid extract "guangchenpi"
possessed vitro antiviral activity respiratory syncytial virus (rsv). 
bioassay-guided isolation identification extract led obtain five
active polymethoxylated flavones (1-5). cytopathic effect (cpe) reduction assay
exhibited tangeretin (2) nobiletin (3), two major polymethoxylated
flavones extract, possessed better anti-rsv effect comparable the
positive control ribavirin. plaque reduction assay revealed tangeretin
dose-dependently inhibited rsv-induced plaque formation hep-2 cells. 
polymethoxylated flavone mainly affected intracellular replication rsv,
and also could inhibit rsv entry hep-2 cells. investigations 
with quantitative real-time pcr confocal western blot assays indicated
that tangeretin downregulated expression rsv phosphoprotein (p protein).
results suggest potential application supercritical fluid extract of
"guangchenpi" tangeretin treatment prevention rsv
infection.
