infections human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) closely related monkey
viruses simian-human immunodeficiency virus (shiv) simian immunodeficiency
virus (siv) characterized progressive waves immune responses, followed 
by viral mutation "immune escape." however, escape mutation usually leads 
lower replicative fitness, absence immune pressure, escape
mutant (em) virus "reverts" wild-type phenotype. analysis dynamics 
of immune escape reversion suggested mechanism identifying
the immunogens best capable controlling viremia. analyzed modeled 
data dynamics wild-type (wt) em viruses shiv infection of
macaques. modeling suggests dynamics reversion immune escape
should determined availability target cells infection.
consistent suggestion, find rate reversion cytotoxic 
t-lymphocyte (ctl) em virus strongly correlates number cd4(+) cells
available infection. phenomenon also affects rate immune escape, 
since rate determined balance ctl killing wt fitness
advantage. analysis predicts optimal timing selection of
immune escape variants immediately peak viremia the
development escape variants later times lead slower selection. this
has important implications comparative studies immune escape reversion
in different infections identifying epitopes high fitness cost for
use vaccine targets.
