objective: obesity common risk factor insulin resistance and
cardiovascular diseases. although hypoadiponectinemia associated with
obesity-related metabolic vascular diseases, role adiponectin in
thrombosis remains elusive.
methods results: investigated platelet thrombus formation adiponectin
knockout (apn-ko) male mice (8 12 weeks old) fed normal diet. was
no significant difference platelet counts coagulation parameters between
wild-type (wt) apn-ko mice. however, apn-ko mice showed accelerated
thrombus formation carotid arterial injury he-ne laser (total thrombus 
volume: 13.36+/-4.25 x 10(7) arbitrary units apn-ko 6.74+/-2.87x10(7)
arbitrary units wt; n=10; p<0.01). adenovirus-mediated supplementation of
adiponectin attenuated enhanced thrombus formation. vitro thrombus
formation type collagen shear rate 250 s(-1), well platelet 
aggregation induced low concentrations agonists, enhanced apn-ko
mice, recombinant adiponectin inhibited enhanced platelet aggregation. in
wt mice, adenovirus-mediated overexpression adiponectin additionally
attenuated thrombus formation.
conclusions: adiponectin deficiency leads enhanced thrombus formation and
platelet aggregation. present study reveals new role adiponectin an
endogenous antithrombotic factor.
