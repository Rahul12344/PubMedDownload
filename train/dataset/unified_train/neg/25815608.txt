molecular dynamics simulation atom-resolved bacteriophage p22 capsid model 
is used delineate underlying mechanism early stage p22 self-assembly. a
dimer formed c-terminal fragment scaffolding protein new
conformation demonstrated catalyze capsomer (hexamer pentamer)
aggregation efficiently. effects scaffolding protein/coat protein binding
patterns scaffolding protein concentration efficiency, fidelity, and
capsid curvature p22 self-assembly identified.
