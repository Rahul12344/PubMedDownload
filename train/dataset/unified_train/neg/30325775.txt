objectives: msm comprise ∼30% new hiv infections israel, country with
mixed jewish arab populations. molecularly characterized hiv-1 arab
and jewish msm (amsm, jmsm) populations reveal possible interethnical
connections.
design: cross-sectional study.
methods: israeli-born, hiv-1-infected msm diagnosed 2005 2016
(n = 1143) cross-matched national civil registry identify
religion (jews/muslims/christians). transmitted drug-resistance mutations (tdrm) 
and hiv-1 subtypes determined first partial protease reverse
transcriptase sequences treatment-naive patients phylogenetic trees were
constructed.
results: among msm, 6.4% (73/1143) arabs 93.6% (1070/1143) jews.
interestingly, higher proportion arabs identified among non-msm (19%,
46/247 versus 6.4%, 73/1143, p < 0.01). subtype analysis 62 hiv-1 amsm 440
randomly selected hiv-1 jmsm sequences revealed 80.6, 8.1, 4.8 6.5% amsm
and 82.3, 9.5, 4.1 4.1% jmsm b, a, c non-a/b/c, respectively.
overall, 13.1% (66/502) tdrm; reverse transcriptase-k103n/s, m184 v, t215s
and protease-l90m common. tdrm prevalence significantly
higher jmsm compared amsm (p = 0.1) temporal changes observed
in frequency. phylogenetic analysis demonstrated amsm jmsm clusters
including l90m, k103n/s t215s tdrm.
conclusion: intermingling amsm jmsm hiv-1 clusters hiv-1 sequences
suggest interethnical sexual contacts among msm. interventions aiming to
prevent hiv-transmission msm similarly address populations groups.
the high tdrm frequency requires continuation resistance testing.
