background: aim study investigate differences hiv disease
progression patients infected hiv subtype b gpgr motif v3
loop region (b-gpgr) versus brazilian subtype b variant gwgr motif
(b'-gwgr).
materials methods: patients enrolled ongoing cohort study the
university são paulo dermatology clinic sao paulo, brazil. v3 serology 
performed enzyme immunoassay peptides representing two hiv subtype b
strains, mn sf2, two brazilian variant b'-gwgr strains. incidence 
aids-defining events calculated, cox proportional hazards regression 
used estimate adjusted risk ratios.
results: samples 114 patients studied, 23 (20%) classified as
b'-gwgr motif, 91 (80%) b-gpgr motif. patients cd4+ cell counts
less 200 cells/mm3 200-400 cells/mm3 experienced increased incidence
of aids-defining events compared patients entered cohort cd4+
cell counts greater 400 cells/mm3. proportional hazard model including 
age, gender, cd4+ cell count entry cohort, v3 serology, gwgr
reactivity associated decreased hazard rate presenting an
aids-defining condition follow-up. three patients group gpgr
serology died experiencing aids-defining event. none patients
with gwgr serology died follow-up.
discussion: survival analysis showed patients infected brazilian
subtype b variant gwgr motif v3 loop lower risk, adjusted for
initial cd4+ cell count, aids-defining events patients infected with
subtype b-gpgr strains.
