progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml) serious opportunistic
infection brain caused jc polyomavirus (jcpyv). pml occurs when
immune control persistent infection jcpyv fails, virus mutates and
changes cellular tropism, enters brain infects astrocytes,
oligodendrocytes and, particular cases, also neurones. currently, 
therapy often fatal disease. number approaches failed, and
only restoration protective immunity, possible, lead clearance
of virus pml occurred. last two decades, investigators
have attempted understand factors contributing development pml, 
which immune mechanisms involved immune surveillance, in
clearing jcpyv brain pml occurred. recent data suggest that
both cd4+ cd8+ cells cellular immune system, also jcpyv-specific
antibodies, involved protection pml resolving the
opportunistic infection. based current immunological data, prophylactic
and therapeutic vaccination strategies proposed, first treatment
attempts pml patients provided promising results indicate
therapeutic vaccination may feasible.
