data antiretroviral drug resistance among drug-naive persons important 
developing sentinel surveillance policies. study conducted to
determine prevalence antiretroviral drug resistance mutations among
drug-naïve hiv-infected individuals attending voluntary testing counselling
centre mankweng hospital northeastern south africa. total, 79
drug-naïve hiv-positive individuals sequentially recruited february
2008-december 2008. drug resistance mutations determined using the
calibrated population resistance tool available stanford hiv drug
resistance database. viral dna obtained 57 (72%) 79 individuals. 
reliable nucleotide sequences obtained 54 reverse transcriptase (rt) and
54 protease (pr) gene regions 54 individuals. overall, five sequences (9.3%)
harboured drug resistance mutations (95% confidence interval -1.53 16.99).
four (7.4%) nucleoside rt inhibitor mutations (d67g, d67e, t69d,
and t215y), one (1.9%) pr inhibitor mutation (m46i). major
non-nucleoside rt resistance mutation detected. several minor resistance
mutations polymorphisms common subtype c viruses observed pr
and rt genes. phlyogenetic analysis partial pol sequences showed 52
(96%) 54 isolates hiv-1 subtype c. one isolate (08mb08za) hiv-1
subtype b another (08mb26za) related hiv-1 subtype j. hiv-1 subtype 
recombination analysis rega assigned pol sequence hiv subtype j
(11_cpx) bootstrap value 75%. prevalence drug resistance
mutations observed population studied relatively higher than
previously reported parts south africa. addition, is
apparently first report hiv-1 subtype j-like virus northeastern
south africa.
