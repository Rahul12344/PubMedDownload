the atomic force microscope (afm) important tool studying biological
samples due ability image surfaces liquids. afm operates by
physical interaction cantilever tip molecules cell surface. 
adhesion forces tip cell surface molecules detected as
cantilever deflections. thus, cantilever tip used image live cells 
with atomic resolution probe single molecular events living cells under
physiological conditions. currently, technique available that
directly provides structural, mechanical, functional information high
resolution. unit presents basic afm components, modes operation,
useful tips sample preparation, short review afm applications in
microbiology.
