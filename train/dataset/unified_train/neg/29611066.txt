the purpose present study investigate use laser doppler
flowmetry (ldf) signals coupled spectral wavelet analysis detect
endothelial link dysfunction autoregulation cerebral blood flow 
setting hyperhomocysteinaemia (hhcy). fifty-one rats assigned three
groups (intact, control, hhcy) according results biochemical assays
of homocysteine level blood plasma. ldf signals rat brain recorded
by lakk-02 device measure microcirculatory blood flow. laser operating
wavelength output power density were1064 nm 0.051 w/mm2, respectively. 
morlet mother wavelet transform applied measured 8-min ldf signals,
and periodic oscillations five frequency intervals identified
(0.01-0.04 hz, 0.04-0.15 hz, 0.15-0.4 hz, 0.4-2 hz, 2-5 hz) corresponding 
endothelial, neurogenic, myogenic, respiratory, cardiac origins,
respectively. initial state, amplitude oscillations decreased by
38% (p < 0.05) endothelial range hhcy rats control rats.
cerebral autoregulation challenged hemorrhagic hypotension. lower
limit autoregulation raised rat model chronic hhcy (71.5 ± 0.7 mmhg in
hhcy vs. 62.3 ± 0.5 mmhg control). data obtained indicate laser
doppler method wavelet analysis may successfully applied detect the
dysfunction endothelial link cerebral vessel tone reveal the
pathological shift lower limit autoregulation.
