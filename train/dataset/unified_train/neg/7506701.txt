papaverine hydrochloride (pap) previously shown potent
inhibitory effect replication viruses cytomegalovirus (cmv) and
measles. report effect pap human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)
replication lymphocyte cell function examined. mt4 cells infected with
hiv strain 3b incubated serial dilutions pap (1-30 microm). at
selected times postinfection hiv replication measured reverse
transcriptase activity (rt) hiv p24 ag. pap significantly inhibited hiv
replication 99% doses 30 microm cd50 ed50 32
microm 5.8 microm respectively. mechanism inhibition hiv caused 
pap appeared independent form ability increase intracellular levels of
camp mediated via direct effect rt activity. examine cell
function, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) normal donors were
stimulated phytohemagglutinin (pha) cmv ag presence absence 
pap (1-30 microm). selected times proliferative response pha cmv ag
were determined [3h]thymidine uptake. addition, interferon (ifn) gamma 
interleukin 2 (il2) response mitogens measured radioimmunoassay (ria).
pap enhanced pha induced ifn production doses 1-10 microm cmv ag
induced ifn production doses 1-3 microm. higher doses inhibitory. pap 
did affect il-2 production il2 receptor expression inhibitory
effect mitogenic responses.
