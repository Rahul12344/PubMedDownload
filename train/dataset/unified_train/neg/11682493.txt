the published genome sequence campylobacter jejuni strain nctc 11168 used 
to model accurate highly reproducible fluorescent amplified fragment
length polymorphism (faflp) analysis. predicted experimentally observed
amplified fragments (afs) generated primer pair hindiii+a hhai+a
were compared. one 61 predicted afs reproducibly detected,
and unpredicted fragments amplified. faflp analysis used to
genotype 74 c. jejuni strains belonging nine heat-stable (hs) serotypes
most prevalent human disease england wales. 74 c. jejuni strains
exhibited 60 faflp profiles, cluster analysis yielded radial tree
showing genetic relationships within 13 major clusters. clusters
were related, others unrelated, single hs serotype. example,
all strains belonging serotypes hs6 hs19 grouped corresponding single
genotypic clusters, strains serotypes hs11 hs18 grouped into
two genotypic clusters. strains hs50, prevalent serotype infecting
humans, found one large (multiserotype) cluster complex and
dispersed throughout tree. strain genotypes within faflp cluster
were characterized particular combination afs, among cluster
there additional differential afs. identification afs could act a
search tool look potential associations disease animal hosts, when
applied large number human isolates. genome-sequence based faflp, thus, has
the potential establish genetic database epidemiological investigations 
of campylobacter.
