plasmid proviral molecular clones lai isolate hiv-1 rod isolate
of hiv-2 originally prepared moderate copy number plasmids derived from
pbr322, contains cole1 origin replication. plasmid vectors,
the hiv sequences stable continuous passage bacteria. however, the
cole1 origin replaced mutant origin puc18, pgem, pbluescript
plasmids, replicates much higher copy numbers bacteria, then
deletions hiv sequences occurred even reca defective strains. deletions
occurred two different media, room temperature 37 degrees c, with
or without plasmid amplification presence chloramphenicol. these
results raise cautionary note cloning immunodeficiency viral sequences
into plasmid vectors containing high copy number origin replication.
