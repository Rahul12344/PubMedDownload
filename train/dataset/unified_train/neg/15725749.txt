the combination unique single nucleotide polymorphisms ccr5 regulatory 
and ccr2 ccr5 coding regions, defined nine ccr5 human haplogroups
(hh): hha-hhe, hhf*1, hhf*2, hhg*1, hhg*2. examined distribution 
of ccr5 hh association hiv infection disease progression 36
hiv-seronegative 76 hiv-seropositive whites north america spain [28 
rapid progressors (rp) 48 slow progressors (sp)]. although analyses revealed 
that hhe frequencies similar hiv-seronegative hiv-seropositive
groups (25.0% vs. 32.2%, p > 0.05), hhe frequency rp significantly higher 
than sp (48.2% vs. 22.9%, p = 0.002). survival analysis also showed 
hhe heterozygous homozygous associated accelerated cd4 cell
count decline less 200 cells/microl (adjusted rh 2.44, p = 0.045;
adjusted rh = 3.12, p = 0.037, respectively). data provide evidence
that ccr5 human haplogroups influence hiv-1 disease progression hiv-infected
persons.
