retinoic acid-inducible gene (rig-i), pivotal cytosolic sensor, recognizes
viral rnas initiate antiviral innate immunity. however, posttranslational
regulation rig-i signaling well understood. report nuclear
dbf2-related kinase 2 (ndr2) functions crucial positive regulator the
rig-i-mediated antiviral immune response. overexpression ndr2 its
kinase-inactive mutants potentiates rna virus-induced production type i
interferons proinflammatory cytokines dampens viral replication. ndr2
conditional knockout mice (lysm+ndr2f/f) show impaired antiviral immune
response. mechanistically, ndr2 directly associates rig-i trim25, thus
facilitating rig-i/trim25 complex enhancing trim25-mediated
k63-linked polyubiquitination rig-i, required rig-i-mediated 
antiviral immune response. furthermore, ndr2 expression notably down-regulated
in peripheral blood respiratory syncytial virus-infected patients in
virus-infected macrophages. collectively, findings provide insights into
the function ndr2 antiviral immunity related clinical significance.
