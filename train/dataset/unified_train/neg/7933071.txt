measles virus (mv)-specific transcription human brain cells characterized
by particularly low abundances distal mrnas encoding mv envelope
proteins. similar transcriptional restrictions closely related vesicular
stomatitis virus observed mouse fibroblasts constitutively
expressing interferon-inducible mxa protein (p. staeheli j. pavlovic, j. 
virol. 65:4498-4501, 1991). found mv infection human brain cells is
accompanied rapid induction high-level expression endogenous mxa
proteins. stable transfection mxa, human glioblastoma cells (u-87-mxa)
released 50- 100-fold less infectious virus expression viral proteins
was highly restricted. overall mv-specific transcription levels reduced 
by 90%, accompanied low relative frequencies distal mv-specific
mrnas. restrictions linked inhibition viral rna synthesis and
not decreased stability viral rnas. results indicate that
expression mxa associated transcriptional attenuation mv brain
cells, thus probably contributing establishment persistent mv central
nervous system infections. addition, mechanism mxa-dependent resistance
against mv infection, contrast vesicular stomatitis virus, cell 
type specific, inhibition mv glycoprotein synthesis independent 
transcriptional alterations observed mxa-transfected human monocytes (j.
