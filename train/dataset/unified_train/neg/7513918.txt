the feline parvovirus subgroup comprised viruses isolated various
carnivores, including dog, cat, mink, raccoon, arctic fox, raccoon dog.
those viruses > 98% identical dna sequences similar
antigenically. shown although canine parvovirus (cpv) replicates 
numerous feline cell lines vitro infect cats parenteral
inoculation (u. truyen c. r. parrish, (1992) j. virol. 66, 5399-5408). here
we use recombination mapping locate viral determinants required for
feline host range, show ability replicate cats determined 
by right-hand 45% genome, likely function capsid protein
gene. efficient replication cat appeared require feline panleukopenia
virus sequences ends vp2 molecule, contained differences
of vp2 amino acid residues 80, 564, 568. difference amino acid 80 
also associated expression fpv-specific antigenic epitope. the
differences affected feline host range located region 
capsid structure three vp2 molecules interact, mutations gave rise 
to changes conformation loops three adjoining vp2 monomers. 
mechanism(s) vivo feline host range restriction defined, and
we unable show vitro inhibition virus infectivity feline serum
components erythrocytes.
