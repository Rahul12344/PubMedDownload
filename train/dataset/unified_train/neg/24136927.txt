current clinically assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and
chemiluminescence immunoassay, hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag) are
inferior terms either sensitivity accuracy rapid high-throughput
analysis. novel assay based magnetic beads time-resolved
fluoroimmunoassay developed quantitative determination hbsag in
human serum. hbsag captured using two types anti-hbsag monoclonal
antibodies (b028, s015) immobilized magnetic beads detected using
europium-labeled anti-hbsag polyclonal detection antibody. finally, assay
yielded high sensitivity (0.02 iu/ml) wide dynamic range (0.02-700 iu/ml)
for hbsag performed optimal conditions. satisfactory accuracy,
recovery specificity also demonstrated. intra- interassay
coefficients variation 4.7-8.7% 3.8-7.5%, respectively. the
performance assay assessed well-established
commercial chemiluminescence immunoassay kit 399 clinical serum samples. 
was revealed test results two methods good correlation
(y = 1.182x - 0.017, r = 0.989). current study, demonstrated 
novel time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay could used: highly sensitive,
automated high-throughput immunoassay diagnosis acute chronic
hepatitis b virus infection; screening blood organ donors; 
the surveillance persons risk acquiring transmitting hepatitis b
virus.
