hepatitis c virus (hcv) translation mediated highly conserved internal
ribosome entry site (ires), mainly located 5'untranslatable region (5'utr)
of viral genome. viral protein synthesis clearly differs used by
most cellular mrnas, rendering ires attractive target novel antiviral 
compounds. engineering rna compounds effective strategy for
targeting conserved functional regions viral rna genomes. present work
analyses anti-hcv potential hh363-24, vitro selected molecule
composed catalytic rna cleaving domain extension 3' end 
acts aptamer viral 5'utr. engineered hh363-24 efficiently cleaved 
the hcv genome bound essential iiid domain ires region. this
action interfered proper assembly translationally active
ribosomal particles 48s 80s, likely leading effective inhibition the
ires function hepatic cell line. hh363-24 also efficiently reduced hcv rna
levels 70% subgenomic replicon system. findings provide new
insights development potential therapeutic strategies based rna
molecules targeting genomic rna structural domains highlight feasibility 
of generating novel engineered rnas potent antiviral agents.
