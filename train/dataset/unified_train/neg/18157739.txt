the plant used characterization fragaria chiloensis latent virus
(fcllv) contained double-stranded rna (dsrna) bands correspond in
size genomic subgenomic rnas known strawberry viruses. using shotgun
cloning, sequences cryptic virus, named fragaria chiloensis cryptic virus
(fccv), obtained. communication presents complete genome sequence
of fccv. genome fccv consists three monocistronic rnas, unusual
feature cryptic viruses normally bipartite. largest molecule
encodes rna-dependent rna polymerase, two encode closely
related proteins predicted coat proteins virus. phylogenetic
analysis showed fccv related closely members the
fungi-infecting partitivirus genus rather members plant-infecting
alphacryptovirus, providing possible insight evolution cryptic
viruses. 300 strawberry plants north south america tested
for fccv, virus detected plants south america.
