several steps hiv-1 replication critically depend cholesterol. hiv
infection associated profound changes lipid lipoprotein metabolism
and increased risk coronary artery disease. whereas numerous studies have
investigated role anti-hiv drugs lipodystrophy dyslipidemia, the
effects hiv infection cellular cholesterol metabolism remain
uncharacterized. here, demonstrate hiv-1 impairs atp-binding cassette
transporter a1 (abca1)-dependent cholesterol efflux human macrophages, a
condition previously shown highly atherogenic. hiv-1-infected cells,
this effect mediated nef. transfection murine macrophages nef
impaired cholesterol efflux cells. least two mechanisms found 
to responsible phenomenon: first, hiv infection transfection with
nef induced post-transcriptional down-regulation abca1; second, nef caused
redistribution abca1 plasma membrane inhibited internalization of
apolipoprotein a-i. binding nef abca1 required down-regulation 
redistribution abca1. hiv-infected nef-transfected macrophages accumulated
substantial amounts lipids, thus resembling foam cells. contribution of
hiv-infected macrophages pathogenesis atherosclerosis supported 
the presence hiv-positive foam cells atherosclerotic plaques of
hiv-infected patients. stimulation cholesterol efflux macrophages
significantly reduced infectivity virions produced cells, and
this effect correlated decreased amount virion-associated cholesterol, 
suggesting impairment cholesterol efflux essential ensure proper
cholesterol content nascent hiv particles. results reveal previously
unrecognized dysregulation intracellular lipid metabolism hiv-infected
macrophages identify nef abca1 key players responsible this
effect. findings implications pathogenesis hiv disease and
atherosclerosis, reveal role cholesterol efflux impairment in
hiv infectivity suggest possible mechanism hiv infection of
macrophages may contribute increased risk atherosclerosis hiv-infected
patients.
