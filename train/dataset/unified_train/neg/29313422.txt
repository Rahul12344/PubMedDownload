human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) powerful target cancer
immune therapy. development anti-her2 monoclonal antibodies targeting
different domains her2 quite effective. however, selection and
production multivalent antibodies complicated. study, a
mimivirus-based designed ankyrin repeat protein (darpin) targeting her2 was
selected artificial library bacteria surface display. selection
was performed her2-positive b16bl6/e2 melanoma cells her2-nagative cells. 
darpin selected library could expressed soluble form yield 
of 70 mg/l. purified two continuous easy steps, purity darpin
was 90% established sds-page rp-hplc. selected darpin showed
significant her2-targeting ability affinity 1.05 ± 0.47 µm. mtt assay 
demonstrated concentration 640 nm, selected darpin dimer could
inhibit sk-br-3 growth rate 36.63 46.34% 48 72 hr
incubation separately, similar trastuzumab (43.12 49.14%
separately). findings suggested effective method select
antibody mimetic darpin bacteria surface display combined live cells
sorting provided drug candidate cancer therapy.
