objectives: aim study investigate prevalence renal
function liver enzyme abnormalities among hiv-infected children, changes in
prevalence time combination antiretroviral therapy (cart), the
factors associated abnormalities.
methods: prospective cohort study conducted among hiv-infected children <
18 years old (n = 705) first-line cart. liver enzymes, renal
function, haematology, immunology virological response assessed at
enrolment followed bi-annually 18 months. liver fibrosis cirrhosis
were assessed using noninvasive markers including aspartate aminotransferase 
(ast) platelet ratio index (apri) fibrosis score (fib-4).
results: median age 12 [interquartile range (iqr) 8-14] years; 53.3% of
patients male. enrolment, median cart duration 3.3 (iqr 1.1-6.1) 
years; 177 (25.1%) 83 (11.8%) patients elevated ast alanine
aminotransferase (alt), respectively. tenth children apri score >
0.5, suggesting liver fibrosis. zidovudine (zdv)- nevirapine
(nvp)-based regimen viral load > 1000 hiv-1 rna copies/ml were
significantly associated elevated alt. twenty-four (3.4%) 84 (12.1%)
patients elevated creatinine blood urea nitrogen (bun), respectively. 
cart duration increased 6 months, median bun increased 1.6 [95% confidence 
interval (ci) 0.4-2.7] mg/dl (p = 0.01); glomerular filtration rate (gfr)
decreased 35.6 (95% ci 17.7-53.4) ml/min/1.73 m2 (p < 0.0001); ast alt
decreased 1.4 (95% ci 0.4-2.5) iu/l (p = 0.01) 1.4 (95% ci 0.2-2.6) iu/l
(p = 0.01), respectively.
conclusions: high prevalence liver enzyme renal function abnormalities
was observed enrolment. decreasing liver enzyme levels follow-up are
possibly reassuring, progressive reduction gfr increase in
bun worrisome require study.
