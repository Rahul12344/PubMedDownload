background: noroviruses leading cause acute gastroenteritis outbreaks 
worldwide. clarifying viral, host, environmental factors (epidemiologic
triad) associated severe outcomes help target public health
interventions.
methods: acute norovirus outbreaks reported national outbreak reporting
system (nors) 2009-2016 linked laboratory-confirmed norovirus
outbreaks reported calicinet. outbreaks analyzed differences in
genotype (gii.4 vs non-gii.4), hospitalization, mortality rates timing,
setting, transmission mode, demographics, clinical symptoms, health outcomes.
results: total 3747 norovirus outbreaks matched nors and
calicinet. multivariable models showed gii.4 outbreaks (n = 2353) were
associated healthcare settings (odds ratio [or], 3.94 [95% confidence
interval {ci}, 2.99-5.23]), winter months (november-april; 1.55 [95% ci,
1.24-1.93]), older age cases (≥50% aged ≥75 years; 1.37 [95% ci,
1.04-1.79]). severe outcomes likely among gii.4 outbreaks
(hospitalization rate ratio [rr], 1.54 [95% ci, 1.23-1.96]; mortality rr, 2.77
[95% ci, 1.04-5.78]). outbreaks healthcare settings also associated 
higher hospitalization (rr, 3.22 [95% ci, 2.34-4.44]) mortality rates (rr,
5.65 [95% ci, 1.92-18.70]).
conclusions: severe outcomes frequently occurred norovirus outbreaks
caused gii.4 healthcare settings. results help guide
preventive interventions targeted populations, including vaccine development.
