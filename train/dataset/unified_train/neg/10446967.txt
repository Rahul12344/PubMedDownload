adeno-associated virus (aav) nonpathogenic, single-stranded dna virus
belonging parvoviridae family. onco-suppressive properties aav 
adenovirus, dna tumor virus, well documented. rep78, major
regulatory protein aav, believed responsible antioncogenic
properties. dna tumor viruses disturb cell cycle pathways essentially
abrogating functions p53. present evidence aav acts an
antiproliferative agent adenovirus protecting adenoviral-mediated 
degradation p53 confirmed western blot analysis and
immunoprecipitation analysis anti-p53 antibody. coimmunoprecipitation
experiments revealed aav rep78 physically bound p53 vivo.
furthermore, binding purified p53 aav rep78 affinity column
confirms interaction. results document first time the
antiproliferative effects aav adenovirus mediated, least in
part, interaction aav rep78 p53.
