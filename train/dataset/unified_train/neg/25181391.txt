matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
(maldi-tof ms) emerging technique rapid high-throughput
identification microorganisms. remains dearth studies a
large number pathogenic microorganisms particular country region are
utilized systematic analyses. study, peptide mass reference spectra
(pmrs) constructed evaluated numerous human pathogens (a total of
1019 strains 94 species), including enteric (46 species), respiratory (21
species), zoonotic (17 species), nosocomial pathogens (10 species), using a
maldi-tof ms biotyper system (mbs). pmrs 380 strains 52 species were
new contributions original reference database (ord). compared the
ord, new reference database (nrd) allowed 28.2% (from 71.5% 99.7%) and
42.3% (from 51.3% 93.6%) improvements identification genus and
species levels, respectively. misidentification rates 91.7% 57.1% lower 
with nrd ord genus species identification,
respectively. eight genera 25 species misidentified. genera and
species challenging accurately identify, identification results must 
be manually determined adjusted accordance database parameters.
through augmentation, mbs demonstrated high identification accuracy and
specificity human pathogenic microorganisms. study sought provide
theoretical guidance using pmrs databases various fields, clinical
diagnosis treatment, disease control, quality assurance, food safety
inspection.
