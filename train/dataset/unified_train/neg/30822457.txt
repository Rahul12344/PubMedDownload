h7n9, novel strain avian origin influenza first recorded incidence
where human transited n9 type influenza virus. effective vaccination
against influenza (h7n9) major concern, since emerged life
threatening viral pathogen. here, silico reverse vaccinology strategy was
adopted design unique chimeric subunit vaccine avian influenza a
(h7n9). induction humoral cell-mediated immunity prime concerned
characteristics peptide vaccine candidate, hence cell b cell
immunity viral proteins screened. antigenicity testing, transmembrane
topology screening, allergenicity toxicity assessment, population coverage
analysis molecular docking approach adopted generate most
antigenic epitopes avian influenza (h7n9) proteome. further, novel subunit
vaccine designed combination highly immunogenic epitopes along with
suitable adjuvant linkers. physicochemical properties secondary structure
of designed vaccine assessed ensure thermostability, h
ydrophilicity, theoretical pi structural behavior. homology modeling,
refinement validation designed vaccine allowed construct three
dimensional structure predicted vaccine, employed molecular
docking analysis different mhc molecules human immune tlr8 receptor
present lymphocyte cells. moreover, disulfide engineering employed to
lessen high mobility region designed vaccine order extend its
stability. furthermore, investigated molecular dynamic simulation the
modeled subunit vaccine tlr8 complexed molecule strengthen prediction.
finally, suggested vaccine reverse transcribed adapted e. coli
strain k12 prior insertion within pet28a(+) vector checking translational 
potency microbial expression.
