in recent years become clear cell-mediated immunity playing role
in control lentivirus infections. particular, cytotoxic lymphocyte
responses associated improved outcome infection, especially
those directed regulatory proteins like rev tat, are
expressed early infection. therefore, considerable interest in
lentiviral vaccine candidates induce types immune responses. in
the present study, describe construction characterisation of
expression vectors based recombinant semliki forest virus system modified 
vaccinia virus ankara expression feline immunodeficiency virus (fiv)
accessory proteins rev orfa. recombinant viral vectors used to
immunize cats using prime-boost regimen protective efficacy this
vaccination strategy assessed challenge infection immunized cats
with fiv.
