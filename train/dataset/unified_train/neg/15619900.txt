we set competitive pcr assay obtain simultaneously quantitative
estimation hbv wild type (m0) precore mutant (m1 m2) genomes sera of
patients hbeag negative chronic hepatitis b evolution during
antiviral therapy. results showed amount hbv dna declined to
undetectable levels rapidly beginning therapy responders,
while non responders, amount viral genomes decreased without
becoming negative. wild type viral strains (m0) seemed sensitive to
interferon compared precore mutant strains (m2). method may useful 
to study course viral infection evaluate efficacy antiviral 
therapy.
