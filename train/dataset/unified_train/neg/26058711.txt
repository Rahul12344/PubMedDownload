the continued spread newly emerged h7n9 viruses among poultry china,
together emergence drug-resistant variants possibility of
human-to-human transmission, spurred attempts develop effective
vaccine. mf59-adjuvant h7n9 inactivated vaccine reported be
well-tolerated immunogenic humans; however study ferrets indicated
that single dose inactivated h7n9 vaccine reduced disease
severity, prevent virus replication transmission. study,
we used reverse genetics produce cold-adapted, live attenuated h7n9 vaccine 
(h7n9/aaca) contains wild-type ha na genes ah/1, backbone
of cold-adapted influenza h2n2 a/ann arbor/6/60 virus (aaca). h7n9/aaca was
attenuated mice ferrets, induced robust neutralizing antibody
responses rhesus mice, ferrets, guinea pigs immunized twice
intranasally. animals immunized twice completely protected h7n9
virus challenge. importantly, animals vaccinated fully protected
from transmission exposed contact h7n9 virus-inoculated
animals. results demonstrate cold-adapted h7n9 vaccine prevent
h7n9 virus transmission; provide compelling argument testing
of vaccine human trials.
