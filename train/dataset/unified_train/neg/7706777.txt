a quantitative culture method used test serial blood specimens 28
lung transplant recipients risk cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection (donor [d] 
or recipient [r] seropositive cmv). viremia occurred 26 (93%) 28
patients. highest levels seen donor seropositive. median of
individual maximum levels 2.13 infectious centers (ics/10(5) leukocytes for
d+/r- patients (interquartile range [iqr], 0.12-21.77), 1.01 d+/r+ (iqr,
0.3-2.32), 0.10 d-/r+ (iqr, 0.07-0.36; p = .030, kruskal-wallis test).
higher levels seen patients biopsy-proven cmv pneumonitis compared
with negative biopsies (mean, 0.24 [sd 0.51] ics/10(5) leukocytes vs. 
0.01 [sd 0.03]; p = .039, wilcoxon test) symptomatic cmv episodes
compared asymptomatic episodes (median, 0.34 ics/10(5) [iqr, 0.11-0.61] vs. 
0.08 ics/10(5) [iqr, 0.03-0.13]; p = .045, wilcoxon test). studies are
required determine whether quantification cmv viremia method will
be practical value recognition significant cmv infection lung
transplant recipients.
