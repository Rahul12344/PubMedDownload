the role direct virus infection determining factor acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (aids) dementia investigated using situ
hybridisation human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) human cytomegalovirus
(hcmv). four five aids dementia patients series demonstrated hiv
infected cells distributed widely different parts brain, one
case showed hcmv infected cells. greater abundance hiv subcortical 
white matter nodular areas consisting monocyte/macrophage infiltrates. 
cells occasionally arranged multinucleated syncitium. two cases, a
few large cells appearance neurons positive hiv
hybridisation. appropriate treatment ribonuclease, shown that
hybridisation primarily hiv rna. hcmv infected cells observed in
small numbers one positive cases, suggesting hcmv a
determining factor aids dementia. hcmv positive cells located grey
matter, appearance suggestive neurons. cells expressing mhc-class 
ii antigen hla-dr, marker reactive microglia macrophages, observed 
to extensive affected brain sections one case examined. cells 
were present greater number hiv infected cells. case, extensive
numbers hiv infected cells noticed along peripheral margin the
substantia innominata. could indicate infection case critical
