motivation: animal toxins operate binding receptors ion channels. these
proteins short vary sequence, structure function. sporadic
discoveries also revealed endogenous toxin-like proteins non-venomous
organisms. viral proteins largest group quickly evolving proteomes. we
tested hypothesis toxin-like proteins exist viruses act
to modulate functions hosts.
results: updated improved classifier compact proteins resembling
short animal toxins based machine-learning method. applied 
a large-scale setting identify toxin-like proteins among short viral proteins.
among approximately 26 000 representatives short proteins, 510
sequences positively identified. focused 19 highest scoring
proteins. among them, identified conotoxin-like proteins, growth factors
receptor-like proteins anti-bacterial peptides. predictor shown to
enhance annotation inference many 'uncharacterized' proteins. conclude
that protocol expose toxin-like proteins unexplored niches including
metagenomics data enhance systematic discovery novel cell modulators
for drug development.
