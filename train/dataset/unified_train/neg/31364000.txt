purpose: assess association benign ovarian tumors subsequent
risk breast cancer, examine association according type of
benign ovarian tumors.
methods: nationwide cohort study comprised danish women diagnosed a
benign ovarian tumor 1978-2016 (n = 158,221) identified danish
national patient register. cohort linked danish cancer registry to
identify cases breast cancer, standardized incidence ratios (sir) 
95% confidence intervals (ci) calculated.
results: overall, women benign ovarian tumor significantly
increased risk breast cancer. risk confined women solid
ovarian tumor (sir 1.09; 95% ci 1.05-1.13), particularly women ≥ 50 years at
benign tumor diagnosis (sir 1.19; 95% ci 1.12-1.26). risk remained increased 
up 20 years diagnosis solid ovarian tumor (sir 1.11;
95% ci 1.04-1.18), women solid tumor increased risk ductal,
lobular, types breast cancer, although consistent the
lobular subtype. cystic tumors, association confined ductal
breast cancer women tumor diagnosed age ≥ 50 years.
conclusions: women benign ovarian tumor increased risk breast
cancer. association largely confined women solid ovarian
tumor, excess risk present 20 years ovarian tumor
diagnosis. underlying mechanism unknown investigated
further.
