peripheral blood lymphocytes chimpanzees infected 3 months 
3 years human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) normal t-cell proliferative
responses stimulation variety recall antigens mitogens,
indicating hiv infection cause detectable immunological impairment 
in chimpanzees. finding contrasts obtained hiv-infected humans,
who often impaired t-cell reactivity. peripheral blood lymphocytes most
hiv-infected chimpanzees studied also strong proliferative
responses purified hiv well hiv envelope glycoproteins isolated 
the virus, recombinant hiv envelope glycoproteins gp120 gp41, hiv
gag protein p24. hiv-specific t-cell responses hiv-infected chimpanzees
may contribute prevention development acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome species.
