inhibition polyclonally induced immunoglobulin secretion aurothiomalate.

petersen j.

the influence sodium aurothiomalate secretion immunoglobulins by
normal human lymphocytes vitro investigated means reverse
hemolytic plaque forming cell (pfc) assay. aurothiomalate inhibited pfc
response induced pokeweed mitogen (pwm) epstein-barr virus (ebv) a
dose dependent manner. inhibition irreversible, pre-incubation 2 h
with drug followed extensive washing culture gold salt-free
medium still caused inhibition pfc response pwm ebv. cell
proliferation significantly affected, suggesting inhibition of
pfc formation due cytotoxicity. pre-incubation of
monocytes/macrophages (mø's), lymphocytes b lymphocytes gold
compound prior culture pwm showed mø's b cells highly
sensitive, whereas lymphocytes resistant drug. findings
indicate aurothiomalate inhibits polyclonally induced pfc response by
interfering accessory mø function affecting b lymphocyte itself.
