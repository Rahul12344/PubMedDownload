the genetic variability infectious bronchitis virus (ibv) one main
challenges control, hindering development effective
vaccination strategies also classification and, consequently,
epidemiology understanding. 624/i q1 genotypes, recognized part
of gi-16 lineage, represent excellent example practical
consequences ibv molecular epidemiology limited knowledge. fact, being
their common origin unrecognized long time, independent epidemiological
pictures drawn two genotypes. fix misinterpretation, the
present study reconstructs history, population dynamics spreading
patterns gi-16 lineage whole using phylodynamic approach. collection 
of worldwide available hypervariable region 1 2 (hvr12) 3 (hvr3)
sequences s1 protein analysed together 258 hvr3 sequences
obtained samples collected italy (the country genotype was
initially identified) since 1963. results demonstrate its
emergence beginning xx century, gi-16 able persist until
present days italy. approximately late 1980s, migrated asia,
which became main nucleus spreading middle east, europe and
especially south america, likely multiple introduction events. a
remarkable among-country diffusion also demonstrated asia south
america. interestingly, although recent italian gi-16 strains
originated ancestral viruses detected country, couple were
closely related chinese ones, supporting backward viral flow china to
italy. besides specific case-study results, work highlights the
misconceptions originate lack unified nomenclature poor
molecular epidemiology data generation sharing. shortcoming appears
particularly relevant since described scenario could likely shared many
other ibv genotypes pathogens general.
