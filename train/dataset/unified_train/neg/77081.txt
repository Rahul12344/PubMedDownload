comparative radioimmunoassays (ria) hemagglutinin influenza type viruses 
were carried out. ria shown detect definite type differences of
influenza b virus hemagglutinin subtype differences (ho h3), as
well determine qualitative quantitative characteristics renewal
of determinants within antigenic drift. a/victoria/3/75 strain found 
to renewed determinants a/scotland/870/74 strain less than
the a/victoria/112/76 strain could considered next drift variant.
the epidemic strains circulating 1972 10% antigenic
determinants characteristics original a/hong kong/1/68 strain. one 
advantages ria demonstrated high sensitivity economy 
the specific antiserum used dilutions 1:20,000 higher. test
antigens may freshly isolated strains virus-containing fluids showing
no hemagglutinating activity (a titer ha test 1:0).
