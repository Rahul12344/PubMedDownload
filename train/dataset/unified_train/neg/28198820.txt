to compare performance eight score systems (meld, umeld, meld-na. imeld,
ukeld, meld-as, ctp, mctp) predicting post-transplant mortality, we
analyzed data 6,014 adult cirrhotic patients underwent liver
transplantation january 2003 december 2010 china liver
transplant registry database. hepatitis b virus (hbv) group, meld, umeld and
meld-as showed good predictive accuracies 3-month mortality liver
transplantation; comparison five models, meld presented best
ability predicting 3-month, 6-month 1-year mortality, showing a
significantly better predictive ability ukeld imeld. hepatitis c
virus alcohol groups, predictive ability differ significantly
between meld models. patient survivals different meld categories
were statistically significant difference. among patients meld score >35,
a new prognostic model based serum creatinine, need hemodialysis and
moderate ascites could identify sickest one. conclusion, meld superior 
to score systems predicting short-term post-transplant survival in
patients hbv-related liver disease. among patients meld score >35, a
new prognostic model identify sickest patients excluded
from waiting list prevent wasteful transplantation.
