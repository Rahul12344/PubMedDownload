objectives: insecticides reduce vector-borne pathogen transmission also pose 
health risks. august 2005, sacramento county, california, underwent emergency 
aerial ultralow-volume (ulv) application pyrethrin insecticide reduce the
population west nile virus (wnv)-infected mosquitoes thereby interrupt
enzootic tangential transmission. assessed association between
aerially applied pyrethrin insecticide patterns emergency department (ed) 
visit diagnoses.
methods: used geographic information systems software determine zip
code-level exposure pyrethrin. used logistic regression models examine
the relationship exposure status three-digit international
classification diseases, ninth edition, clinical modification (icd-9-cm) codes
(785 total) ed visits (n=253,648) within sacramento county 2005 and
for specific diagnostic clusters (e.g., respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin, eye,
and neurologic). models adjusted age, gender, race/ethnicity
(individual level), median income, ozone, temperature (zip code level).
results: exposure aerially applied insecticide associated with
clusters respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin, eye, neurologic complaints
in adjusted models inversely associated icd-9-cm code 799 ("other
ill-defined morbidity mortality"), adjusted odds ratios (aors) ranging
from 0.31 0.36 0-3 lag days (95% confidence interval 0.17, 0.68). spraying
was also directly associated icd-9-cm code 553 ("other abdominal hernia"),
with aors ranging 2.34 2.96 2-3 lag days.
conclusions: observed significant icd-9-cm code associations likely
represented chance findings. aerial ulv pyrethrin applications not
associated ed visits specific diagnoses clusters diagnoses.
