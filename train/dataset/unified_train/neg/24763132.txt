background objective: precore (pc) variant (g1896a) basal core promoter
(bcp) variant (a1762t/g1764a) hbv associated risk hepatocellular
carcinoma hbv carriers. however, little known impact the
adverse outcomes hepatitis b e antigen (hbeag)-negative hepatitis liver
cirrhosis.
methods: 251 spontaneous hbeag seroconverters genotype b c infection
and received long-term follow-up enrolled. pc bcp mutants were
determined qualitatively quantitatively correlate adverse
outcomes. findings validated independent case-control study, which
included 184 patients biopsy-proven liver fibrosis stages.
results: longitudinal cohort study, bcp mutant possibly pc wild type
were associated cirrhosis development, hbeag-negative hepatitis.
multivariable analysis showed bcp mutant independent risk factor
for cirrhosis development. using quantitative analysis bcp mutant, higher
proportion bcp mutant, defined continuous variable, dichotomous
variable ordinal variable, associated higher risk cirrhosis. 
if chose 45% bcp mutant cut-off, risk cirrhosis higher in
patients bcp mutant â‰¥45% compared <45% longitudinal cohort; this
finding validated case-control study (adjusted or: 2.81, 95% ci 1.40
to 5.67).
conclusions: higher proportion bcp mutant increases risk liver
cirrhosis development hbv carriers genotype b c infection.
