the aim paper combine different complementary approaches to
check neutrality given locus selected population. analysis was
undertaken polymorphism's evolution compared predicted
under effect drift analysis variance components 
the measured traits, considering effect locus either fixed a
random effect. study deals case mhc locus, using data
from experimental lines chicken selected three different criteria of
immune response, frequencies genotyped haplotypes time. 
evolution polymorphism variance components approach led to
the conclusion mhc locus effect trait affecting antibody
production newcastle disease virus. results also highlighted the
interest using various methods case low allelic frequencies.
however, none common hypotheses, overdominance frequency-dependent
selection, sufficient explain observed variation mhc
polymorphism, displayed temporal variation allelic
frequencies.
