chemokines important mediators inflammation. demonstrated that
there increase chemokine expression sera brain of
individuals infected human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1). hiv-1 
viral protein, tat, transcriptional regulator, detected central
nervous system (cns) infected individuals, demonstrated induce
chemokines various cells within brain. authors show the
interaction human microglia, resident phagocytes brain, tat
leads dramatic increases secretion chemokines ccl2, cxcl8,
cxcl10, ccl3, ccl4, ccl5. treatment microglia tat plus specific
inhibitors signal transduction pathways demonstrated induction of
each chemokine regulated differently. tat-induced expression ccl2 ccl4 
was mediated activation extracellular regulated kinase (erk)1/2
mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) pathway phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (pi3k) pathway, whereas induction cxcl8 ccl3 mediated
only p38 mapk pathway. tat-induced cxcl10 expression mediated, some
extent, activation erk1/2 mapk pathway, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
pathway, p38 mapk pathway, whereas ccl5 expression mediated by
any pathway tested. western blot analysis demonstrated phosphorylation erk 1/2
and akt upon stimulation microglia tat. data suggest soluble
hiv-1 viral protein alter chemokine balance brain, 
lead influx inflammatory cells contribute neuropathogenesis
of hiv-1 infection.
