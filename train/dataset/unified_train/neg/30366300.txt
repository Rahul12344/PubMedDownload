recombination driving force emergence, evolution and
virulence/epidemics viruses, comprising enterovirus genus the
picornaviridae family, important human animal health. analyzing 2949
complete genomes/coding sequences, provide thorough up-to-date overview 
of genome-wide patterns hotspots intertypic recombination 
genogroups genus. two prominent recombination hotspots are
identified/verified, 5'utr-capsid region junction, beginning of
the p2 region. general, p2 enriched recombination events. key
phylogenetic groups implicated recombination events e71 cva6 in
enterovirus species, e30 e6 enterovirus b species, polioviruses 1 2 
in enterovirus c species. addition, many events involve recombination partners
that sequenced yet, thus strongly suggesting large environmental 
reservoir genetic variation high potential emergence new
modified pathogens recombination.
