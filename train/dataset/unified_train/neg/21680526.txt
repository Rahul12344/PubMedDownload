recent studies shown ubiquitin (ub) proteasome pathway (upp) is
closely related immune defense. identified ubiquitin-conjugating
enzyme, e2, chinese white shrimp, fenneropenaeus chinensis (fcubc).
injection recombinant fcubc protein (rfcubc) reduced mortality shrimp
infected white spot syndrome virus (wssv) inhibited replication wssv.
rfcubc, mutant fcubc (mfcubc), bound wssv ring domains (wrds) from
four potential e3 ligase proteins wssv vitro. importantly, rfcubc could
ubiquitinate ring domains (named wrd2 wrd3) wssv277 wssv304
proteins vitro two proteins wssv-infected drosophila melanogaster
schneider 2 (s2) cells. furthermore, overexpression fcubc increased
ubiquitination wssv277 wssv304 wssv infection. summary, our
study demonstrates fcubc chinese white shrimp inhibited wssv
replication could ubiquitinate wssv ring domain-containing proteins. 
the first report antiviral function ubc e2 shrimp.
