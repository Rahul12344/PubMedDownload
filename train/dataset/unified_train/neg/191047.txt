a serological study determine prevalence infections caused human
polyoma-virus (bk strain) among healthy population rome been
performed. virus originally isolated patient undergoing kidney 
transplantation, later found patients undergoing immunosuppressive
therapy. previous serological studies showed high incidences infections,
caused virus, human populations. viruses, antigenically related,
were found patients suffering progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
serum samples coming 482 healthy subjects classified age 100 cord
blood serum samples analyzed antibody titers using
haemoagglutination-inhibition complement fixation tests. high incidence of
infection caused bk virus roman population found: specifically 
haeomagglutination-inhibition test resulted positive 65.2% samples. a
remarkable similar trend results obtained techniques
was observed, although differences antibody serum levels present. the
infections, transmitted intrauterine life, first
