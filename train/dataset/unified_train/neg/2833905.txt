hiv-1 infected molt4-t4 cells provide efficient system production of
cellular precursor gp160 hiv envelope glycoproteins, gp120 gp41. the
precursor gp160 purified immuno-affinity column containing antibodies
from sera hiv-1-seropositive patients. precursor gp160 isolated
by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. two four balb/c mice,
immunized purified preparations gp160, developed specific
circulating antibodies. hybridoma cell line subsequently isolated producing
monoclonal antibody kl49/19 (igg1, k) specific gp160. monoclonal
antibody specifically immunoprecipitate gp160, existing hiv-1-infected
cells. immunoblotting assay, identifies mainly gp160 shows slight 
affinity mature glycoprotein, gp120. monoclonal antibody probably 
directed epitope polypeptide residue gp160 since can
recognize deglycosylated polypeptide molecular weight 90,000, product of
gp160 digestion endoglycosidase h (endo h). cross-react any
protein hiv-2 immunoblot immunoprecipitation assays. virtue its
specificity, monoclonal antibody kl49/19 might provide powerful probe 
which detect gp160 cells might partially express hiv-1 genes.
