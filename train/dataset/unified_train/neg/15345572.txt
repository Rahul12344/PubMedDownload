in eukaryotes, genomic processes like transcription, replication, repair, and
recombination typically require alterations nucleosome structure specific
dna regions operate. atp-dependent nucleosome remodeling complexes provide a
major mechanism carrying alterations vivo. learn about
the action important complexes, utilized atomic force
microscopy situ technique permits comparison individual
molecules activation particular process, case
nucleosome remodeling. direct approach used look changes induced 
by action human swi-snf remodeling complex individual, single-copy 
mouse mammary tumor virus promoter nucleosomal arrays. using technique, we
detect variety changes remodeling. many changes larger in
scale suggested previous studies involve number dna-mediated
events, including preference removal complete turn (80 basepairs) 
of nucleosomal dna. latter result raises possibility unanticipated 
mode human swi-snf interaction nucleosome, namely via 11-nm
histone surface.
