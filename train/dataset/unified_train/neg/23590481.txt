peste des petits ruminants (ppr) endemic disease small ruminants, and
vaccination method control outbreaks continuously
occurring pakistan. following study presents detailed investigation of
an outbreak, suspected ppr, probably introduced pprv-infected sheep 
goats sindh province (north-west) punjab province (central) pakistan
during flood relief campaign 2011. total 70 serum samples 28
different flocks tested competitive elisa (h antibodies), which
detected 24 (34.2%) samples positive pprv antibodies. nasal swabs faeces 
were tested immunocapture elisa (n antigen), detected 18 (25.7%)
samples positive pprv antigen. rna detected positive (n = 28, 40%) using 
real-time pcr subjected conventional pcr amplification the
fusion nucleoprotein genes. sequencing genes subsequent
phylogenetic analysis indicated grouping sequences in
lineage iv along asian isolates pprv. however, sequences both
genes divided two groups within lineage iv. one group viruses
clustered previously characterized pakistani isolates, whereas other
group distinctly clustered isolates middle east india. the
sequence identity indicated introduction least one population pprv
from different source circulation local flocks small ruminants,
which emphasized need obtain health clearance certificate movement 
of animals. results study provide baseline data genetic
characterization different pprv populations pakistan.
