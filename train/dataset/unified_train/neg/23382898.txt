objective: define population-level cohort individuals infected the
human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) province british columbia from
available registries administrative datasets using validated case-finding
algorithm.
methods: individuals identified possible cohort inclusion bc
centre excellence hiv/aids (cfe) drug treatment program (antiretroviral
therapy) laboratory testing datasets (plasma viral load (pvl) cd4
diagnostic test results), bc centre disease control (cdc) provincial hiv 
surveillance database (positive hiv tests), well databases held bc
ministry health (moh); discharge abstract database (hospitalizations), the
medical services plan (physician billing) pharmanet databases (additional
hiv-related medications). validated case-finding algorithm applied to
distinguish true hiv cases likely misclassified. the
sensitivity algorithms assessed proportion confirmed cases
(those records cfe, cdc moh databases) positively identified by
each algorithm. priori hypotheses generated tested verify excluded 
cases.
results: total 25,673 individuals identified least one
hiv-related health record. among 9,454 unconfirmed cases, selected
case-finding algorithm identified 849 individuals believed hiv-positive.
the sensitivity algorithm among confirmed cases 88%. excluded
from cohort likely female (44.4% vs. 22.5%; p<0.01), a
lower mortality rate (2.18 per 100 person years (100py) vs. 3.14/100py; p<0.01), 
and lower median rates health service utilization (days medications
dispensed: 9745/100py vs. 10266/100py; p<0.01; days inpatient care: 29/100py
vs. 98/100py; p<0.01; physician billings: 602/100py vs. 2,056/100py; p<0.01).
conclusions: application validated case-finding algorithms subsequent 
hypothesis testing provided strong framework defining population-level
cohort hiv infected people bc using administrative databases.
