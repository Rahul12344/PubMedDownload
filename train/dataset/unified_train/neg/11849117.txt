treatment options recurrent refractory head neck cancer limited.
the goal gene therapy introduce new genetic material cancer cells
without affecting toxicity surrounding malignant cells. common
vehicles delivery genes adenoviruses. adenoviruses gain access to
malignant normal cell cytoplasm via viral ligand binding unique cell
surface receptor (the coxsackie adenovirus receptor [car]). however, this
receptor cancer specific. genetic modification adenoviral dna can
create cancer specific targeting. adenoviruses modified express cancer 
specific ligands thereby focusing binding malignant tissue. furthermore,
adenoviral delivered genes put cancer specific promoter control to
further limit gene expression malignant tissue. increased antitumour activity 
from modifications demonstrated preclinically several clinical 
trials completed demonstrating safety clinical activity of
non-replicating conditional replicating adenoviral vector thereby opening the
door gene delivery cancer specific targeting.
