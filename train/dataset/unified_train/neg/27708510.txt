hepatitis c recurrence continues present major challenge liver
transplantation (lt). approximately 10% hepatitis c virus (hcv)-positive
recipients develop fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis (fch) lt. fch is
clinically characterized marked jaundice cholestatic hepatic dysfunction 
and high titers viremia. pathologically, fch manifests marked hepatocyte
swelling, cholestasis, periportal peritrabecular fibrosis mild
inflammation. progressive form usually involves acute liver failure, and
rapidly results graft loss. real-time precise diagnosis based on
histopathological examination viral measurement indispensable the
adequate treatment fch. typical pathological findings fch shown.
currently, carefully selected combinations direct-acting antivirals (daas)
offer potential highly effective safe regimens hepatitis c, 
in pre- post-transplant settings. here, review fch caused hcv lt
recipients, current strategies sustained virological responses lt. 
only cases successfully treated fch c lt daas been
reported. diagnostic findings therapeutic dilemma discussed based 
a literature review.
