background: hiv-1 p6 gag protein regulates final abscission step of
nascent virions cell membrane action two late assembly (l-)
domains. although p6 located within one polymorphic regions the
hiv-1 gag gene, 52 amino acid peptide binds least two cellular budding 
factors (tsg101 alix), substrate phosphorylation, ubiquitination,
and sumoylation, mediates incorporation hiv-1 accessory protein
vpr viral particles. expected, known functional domains mostly overlap
with several conserved residues p6. study, investigated the
importance highly conserved serine residue position 40, now
has assigned known function p6.
results: consistently previous data, found mutation ser-40 no

feasible s40f mutation preserves overlapping pol open reading frame

cultivated ex vivo. intriguingly, l-domain mediated virus release not
dependent integrity ser-40. however, s40f mutation significantly
reduces specific infectivity released virions. further, observed
that mutation ser-40 selectively interferes cleavage capsid
(ca) spacer peptide sp1 gag, without affecting cleavage gag
products. deficiency processing ca, consequence, led an

can rescued a1v mutation sp1 generally enhances processing of
the ca-sp1 cleavage site.
conclusions: overall, data support far unrecognized function p6
mediated ser-40 occurs independently l-domain function, but
selectively affects ca maturation virus core formation, consequently 
infectivity released virions.
