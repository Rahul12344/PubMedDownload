viperin known play important role innate immune antiviral
mechanisms well demonstrated mammals. fish viperin mediates antiviral
activity several viruses. however, little done underlying
mechanism. here, discovered novel viperin splice variant named viperin_sv1
from viral-infected fhm cells. spring varimia carp virus (svcv) able to
increase mrna levels viperin viperin_sv1, poly(i:c) only
has effect viperin. viperin functions antiviral protein 24 h
post-svcv infection, antiviral activity dramatically declined late
infection stages. however, viperin_sv1 inhibited svcv replication significantly
at tested time. viperin_sv1, viperin facilitate the
production type ifn ifn stimulate genes (isgs) activation of
rig-1, irf3 irf7 signaling cascades. hand, svcv down-regulated
viperin_sv1 protein level proteasome pathway keep itself
away immune system monitoring. taken together, findings provide
new insights regulation viperin posttranscriptional
modification perspective role splicing variant viperin_sv1 in
virus-host interaction.
