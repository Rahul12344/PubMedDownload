avian oncornavirus group-specific antigen: detection quantification by
radioimmunoassay.

fritz rb, qualtiere lf.

a double-antibody competitive-inhibition radioimmunoassay avian
group-specific antigen described. viral protein preparation, consisting
primarily gs-1, labeled radioiodine. hamster rabbit antisera were
reacted labeled antigen, resultant antibody-antigen complexes
were precipitated appropriate antiglobulin. standard curves based the
inhibition binding labeled antigen antibody preincubation with
unlabeled antigen prepared. showed lower limit sensitivity to
be 2 10 ng unlabeled protein labeled antigen 2,000 5,000 counts 
per min per ng specific activity used assay. extracts avian
oncornavirus-infected cells, likewise, able inhibit binding labeled
antigen. technique useful quantification small
amounts oncornavirus group-specific protein.
