objective: qinba mountain area shanxi province, china, one poorest, 
culturally backward regions china high incidence mental retardation.
to investigate whether cytomegalovirus (cmv) plays role high incidence
of mental retardation region, studied incidence cmv infection
during pregnancy possible risk factors associated cmv infection.
methods: 386 consecutive pregnant women qinba mountain area monitored for
the level cmv-specific igm antibody. polymerase chain reaction used to
detect cmv breast milk obtained within 2 weeks postpartum urine samples of
newborn infants born actively cmv-infected mothers. serum levels tnf-alpha,
il-6, zinc, copper, iron selenium analyzed cmv-infected pregnant
women.
results: incidence cmv-active infection pregnancy, intrauterine
transmission excretion breast milk 15.03, 33.33, 39.58%,
respectively. active cmv infection pregnancy correlated maternal 
age, education economic status, parity, history obstetric
complications. women active cmv infection, intrauterine
transmission, cmv excretion milk showed higher values tnf-alpha and
il-6, lower values zinc compared health age-matched controls (p <
0.05). differences identified studied cases controls the
level copper, iron, selenium (p > 0.05).
conclusion: incidence cmv-active infection pregnancy high in
qinba mountain area shanxi province. zinc deficiency may risk factor 
the development cmv infection. tnf-alpha il-6 may involved the
pathophysiologic process.
