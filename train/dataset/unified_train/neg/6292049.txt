the human serum albumin gene: structure unique locus.

hawkins jw, dugaiczyk a.

the entire gene human serum albumin (hsa) isolated genomic
dna library, carried lambda charon 4a vector. six independent isolates
have found hybridize cloned hsa cdna probe, six clones share
restriction site sequence homology overlapping portion dna. these
results seem indicate albumin gene single-copy, unique, within 
the human haploid genome. measuring "cap" site "poly(a)" addition
site, albumin gene comprises 16.5 kb dna.
