there emerging evidence people successfully treated hiv infection
age prematurely, leading progressive multi-organ disease, reasons 
this known. show patients treated commonly used
nucleoside analog anti-retroviral drugs progressively accumulate somatic
mitochondrial dna (mtdna) mutations, mirroring seen much later life
caused normal aging. ultra-deep re-sequencing synthesis, combined with
single-cell analyses, suggests increase somatic mutation not
caused increased mutagenesis might instead caused accelerated mtdna 
turnover. leads clonal expansion preexisting age-related somatic
mtdna mutations biochemical defect affect 10% cells.
these observations add weight role somatic mtdna mutations aging
process raise specter progressive iatrogenic mitochondrial genetic
disease emerging next decade.
