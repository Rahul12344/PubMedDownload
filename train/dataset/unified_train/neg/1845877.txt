the cylindrical inclusion protein potyviruses contains so-called
nucleoside triphosphate binding motif, amino acid sequence motif present in
proteins encoded positive-strand rna viruses, double-strand rna
viruses, apparently groups double-strand dna viruses, also several
single-strand dna viruses. sequence analysis allowed include the
cylindrical inclusion protein potyviruses member superfamily of
helicaselike proteins. paper show purified cylindrical
inclusion protein plum pox potyvirus interacts rna atp copurifies
with nucleic acid-stimulated atpase activity. knowledge, the
first time kind enzymatic activity experimentally
associated positive-strand rna virus-encoded protein.
