micrornas (mirnas) one family short (21-23 nt) regulatory non-coding rnas 
processed long (70-110 nt) mirna precursors (pre-mirnas). identifying true
and false precursors plays important role computational identification of
mirnas. numerical features extracted precursor sequences 
their secondary structures suit classification methods; however, may
lose usefully discriminative information hidden sequences structures.
in study, pre-mirna sequences secondary structures directly
used construct exponential kernel based weighted levenshtein distance
between two sequences. string kernel combined support vector
machine (svm) detecting true false pre-mirnas. based 331 training
samples true false human pre-mirnas, 2 key parameters svm selected 
by 5-fold cross validation grid search, 5 realizations different
5-fold partitions executed. among 16 independent test sets 3 human, 8
animal, 2 plant, 1 virus, 2 artificially false human pre-mirnas, method
statistically outperforms previous svm-based technique 11 sets, including 
3 human, 7 animal, 1 false human pre-mirnas. particular, premirnas with
multiple loops usually excluded previous work correctly
identified study accuracy 92.66%.
