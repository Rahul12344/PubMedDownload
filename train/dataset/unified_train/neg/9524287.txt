hepatitis c virus (hcv) often causes prolonged persistent infection, an
association hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) hcv infection been
noted. recent experimental evidence using cloned genomic region suggests that
the putative core protein hcv numerous biological properties is
implicated viral factor hcv mediated pathogenesis. waf1/cip1/sid1 (p21) 
is prototype family proteins inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases
(cdk) regulate cell cycle progression eukaryotic cells. study, 
have observed hcv core protein represses transcriptional activity of
the p21 promoter tested separately in-vitro transient expression assay
using murine fibroblasts (nih3t3), human hepatocellular carcinoma (hepg2), and
human cervical carcinoma (hela) cells. deletion analysis p21 promoter
suggested hcv core responsive region located downstream p53
binding site. gel mobility shift analysis showed hcv core protein does
not bind directly p21 regulatory sequences. thus, hcv core protein appears
to act effector promotion cell growth repressing p21
transcription unknown cellular factor(s).
