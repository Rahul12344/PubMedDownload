bats crucial proper functioning ecosystem. provide various
important services ecosystem environment. while, bats well-known
carrier pathogenic viruses, possible role potential carrier of
pathogenic bacteria under-explored. here, using culture-based approach,
employing multiple bacteriological media, thousand bacteria cultivated 
and identified rousettus leschenaultii (a frugivorous bat species), the
majority family enterobacteriaceae putative pathogens.
next, pathogenic potential frequently cultivated component microbiome 
i.e. escherichia coli assessed identify known pathotypes which
revealed presence virulent factors many cultivated e. coli isolates.
applying in-depth bacterial community analysis using high-throughput 16â€‰s rrna
gene sequencing, high inter-individual variation observed among studied
guano samples. interestingly, higher diversity bacterial communities was
observed decaying guano representative. search human pathogenic
bacteria database 97% identity, small proportion sequences found
associated well-known human pathogens. present study thus indicates that
this bat species may carry potential bacterial pathogens advice study 
effect pathogens bats probable mode transmission to
humans animals.
