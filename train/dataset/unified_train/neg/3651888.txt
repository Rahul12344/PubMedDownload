in attempt elucidate mechanism whereby dexamethasone could reactivate
bovine herpesvirus type-1 effect dexamethasone virus replication and
leukocyte functions assessed. effect detectable either virus yield 
or vitro replication kinetics. contrast, dexamethasone influenced several
leukocyte functions thought importance antiviral defense and
maintenance latency. vitro exposure peripheral blood polymorphonuclear
neutrophilic granulocytes normal animals dexamethasone depressed their
migratory cytotoxic activities, effect fc- complement
receptor expression. dexamethasone also depressed lectin-induced lymphocyte
proliferation interleukin-2 generation dose-dependent manner. cows 
were treated repeatedly dexamethasone leukocytes assayed,
suppression phytohemagglutinin-induced lymphocyte proliferation, interleukin-2
generation, natural cytotoxicity mononuclear cells polymorphonuclear
neutrophilic granulocyte functions observed. contrast, concanavalin a
induced lymphocyte proliferation increased following treatment.
