viruses belonging genus megalocytivirus cause diseases marine fishes
primarily east southeast asian countries. rock bream iridovirus (rbiv),
which member megalocytivirus genus, causes severe mass mortalities in
rock beam (oplegnathus fasciatus) korea. study, assessed
apoptosis-related gene expression patterns megalocytivirus-infected rock bream
in high mortality low mortality conditions determine important
apoptosis-related factors, may affect fish survival/or death. high
mortality group (100% mortality 15 dpi), significantly high levels of
perforin, granzyme, fas ligand caspase 9 expression (5.6-, 10.2-, 13.4- and
4.2-fold, respectively) observed kidney 8 dpi. basal expression
levels fas caspase 3 observed 8 d (1.5-/0.7-fold) 10 dpi
(1.3-/0.6-fold), accompanied heavy viral loads (8.12 × 10(6)-2.21 × 10(7)/μl).
inhibitor apoptosis 1 (iap1) highly expressed (3.5- 4.8-fold) 1 d
and 4 dpi; however, iap1 reduced fish died 8 d 10 dpi (1.7- to
2.0-fold), significantly different control group. 
a similar expression pattern observed low mortality group (18%
expected mortality 30 dpi), characterised delayed lower
magnitude expression lower viral loads high mortality group.
perforin, granzyme fas ligand expression significantly higher low 
mortality group control group several sampling points until
30 dpi. fas caspases 8, 9 3 expression levels showed statistical
significance 30 dpi. low mortality group, significantly higher iap1 
expression compared control observed 10 d (2.2-fold), 20 d
(3.6-fold) 22 dpi (2.0-fold). summary, perforin- granzyme-related
apoptosis initiation signals activated; however, fas-induced apoptosis
pathway efficiently respond. upregulated iap1 rbiv-infected rock
bream, reported first time study, exhibited inhibited
apoptotic responses rbiv-infected fish. although remains unclear whether
apoptosis inhibition aids impedes fish survival, data clearly show that
the apoptotic response inhibited rbiv-infected rock bream.
