escherichia coli gal operon proteins made prophage lambda induction.

expression escherichia coli gal operon control prophage
lambda promoter pl leads gross discoordinacy gal expression. expression 
the promoter-distal cistron galk much greater expression the
promoter-proximal cistron gale. previously shown transcription the
gal operon coordinate prophage induction. survey protein
synthesized prophage induction indicated lack expression gale is
due failure translation gale sequence pl-gal transcript.
this failure translation gale sequence may due extensive dyad
symmetry present vicinity gal promoter region pl-gal
transcript. symmetry could result ribonucleic acid stem-loop structure,
blocking attachment ribosomes shine-dalgarno sequence gale. to
test model, strains bearing is1 is2 insertion, deletion, new
promoter mutation within symmetrical region constructed. restoration
of gale expression disruptions symmetrical region
indicated ribonucleic acid stem-loop structure play role the
discoordinate expression gal pl. however, failure obtain gale
expression coordinated high levels galk expression suggested other
components involved, perhaps symmetries gale pl
transcript.
