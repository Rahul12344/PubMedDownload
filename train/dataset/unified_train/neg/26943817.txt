fatal ebola virus infection characterized systemic inflammatory response 
similar septic shock. ebola glycoprotein (gp) involved process
through activating dendritic cells (dcs) macrophages. however, mechanism 
is unclear. here, showed lsectin (also known clec4g) plays an
important role gp-mediated inflammatory responses human dcs. anti-lsectin
mab engagement induced tnf-α il-6 production dcs, whereas silencing of
lsectin abrogated effect. intriguingly, pathogen-derived ligand, ebola 
gp could trigger tnf-α il-6 release dcs lsectin. mechanistic
investigations revealed lsectin initiated signaling via association a
12-kda dnax-activating protein (dap12) induced syk activation. mutation of
key tyrosines dap12 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif
abrogated lsectin-mediated signaling. furthermore, syk inhibitors significantly
reduced gp-triggered cytokine production dcs. therefore, results
demonstrate lsectin required gp-induced inflammatory response,
providing new insights ebov-mediated inflammatory response.
