nowadays, prevalence atopic diseases so-called developed countries is
estimated exceed 30%. furthermore, may reach 50% two generations.
based facts, so-called "atopic predisposition" defined 
an abnormal genotype consisting certain "atopic gene(s)" possessed a
minority unfortunate people. rather, gene(s) cause atopic diseases
reside common human gene repertoire, several environmental factors
would cause overexpression constitutive gene(s), leading the
development atopic diseases. author considers overexpression and
production th2 cytokines, especially il-5, may key event. recent
prevalence atopic diseases developed countries may mediated change 
of th2 polarization due modern retrogression environmental factors 
bacterial viral infections favor th1 polarization. "atopic trait"
might actually "atopic phenotype" rather "atopic genotype". in
other words, atopic trait seems genotype decides the
development atopic disease nothing basis, phenotype that
determines susceptibility disease. course, familial nature of
atopic diseases undeniable, necessarily indicate genetic
nature atopic diseases. example, parent suffers tuberculosis,
the possibility children develop tuberculosis markedly increased.
however, tuberculosis truly infectious disease. article, several
environmental factors may affect recent sharp increase atopic
diseases discussed.
