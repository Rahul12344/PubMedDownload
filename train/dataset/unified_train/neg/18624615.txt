since impressive reduction transfusion-transmitted virus infections,
bacterial infections blood transfusion represent important infection 
risk. platelet concentrates current focus attention, are
stored temperature conditions allow growth contaminating bacteria 
up 10(10) microbes per platelet bag. paper consider the
pathogen reduction methods assess suitable screening methods. beside
conventional microbiological approaches surrogate markers, several efficient
methods able detect bacterial contamination platelets available 
market. need divided two different methodological principles: the
cultivation methods rapid methods. cultivation incubation methods require 
some time signal production depend growth microbes. thus, 
have combined early sampling, i.e., sample examined to
be drawn blood component 1 day donation. advantage the
relatively uncomplicated implementation logistics blood banks.
because initially low count bacteria donation, certain
small sampling error application strategy remains. rapid methods are
able produce diagnosis within short time. therefore, allow
postponing sample drawing, ideally time immediately before
transfusion. however, procedure causes logistic complications. 
hand, late sampling combined rapid method prevent transfusion 
highly contaminated platelet concentrates leading acute septic shock the
death patient. considering sum different aspects including the
supply patients, potential improvement microbial safety platelet
concentrates comparable strategies.
