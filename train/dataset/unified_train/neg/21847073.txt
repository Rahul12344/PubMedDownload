wild birds implicated spread highly pathogenic avian
influenza (hpai) h5n1 subtype, prompting surveillance along migratory
flyways. sampling wild birds avian influenza virus (aiv) often
conducted remote regions, results often delayed need to
transport samples laboratory equipped molecular testing. real-time
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rrt-pcr) molecular
technique offers one accurate sensitive methods for
diagnosis aiv. previously strict lab protocols needed rrt-pcr 
being adapted field. development freeze-dried (lyophilized) reagents
that require cold chain, sensitivity level wet reagents has
brought on-site remote testing practical goal. present method 
the rapid diagnosis aiv wild birds using rrt-pcr unit (ruggedized
advanced pathogen identification device rapid, idaho technologies, salt lake
city, ut) employs lyophilized reagents (influenza target 1 taqman;
asay-asy-0109, idaho technologies). reagents contain necessary
components testing appropriate concentrations single tube: primers,
probes, enzymes, buffers internal positive controls, eliminating errors
associated improper storage handling wet reagents. portable unit
performs screen influenza targeting matrix gene yields results
in 2-3 hours. genetic subtyping also possible h5 h7 primer sets 
target hemagglutinin gene. system suitable use cloacal and
oropharyngeal samples collected wild birds, demonstrated the
migratory shorebird species, western sandpiper (calidrus mauri) captured in
northern california. animal handling followed protocols approved animal
care use committee u.s. geological survey western ecological research 
center permits u.s. geological survey bird banding laboratory. the
primary advantage technique expedite diagnosis wild birds,
increasing chances containing outbreak remote location. on-site
diagnosis would also prove useful identifying studying infected
individuals wild populations. opportunity collect information host
biology (immunological physiological response infection) spatial
ecology (migratory performance infected birds) provide insights 
extent wild birds act vectors aiv long distances.
