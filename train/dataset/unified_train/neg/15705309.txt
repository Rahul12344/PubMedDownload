the purpose study evaluate treatment efficacy using
ivf-intracytoplasmic sperm injection (icsi) hiv serodiscordant couples
interested children minimizing risk viral transmission.
this study reviews cases hiv serodiscordant couples (n = 142) seeking
fertility treatment assisted reproductive centre. main outcome measures
were successful pregnancy rate hiv seroconversion rate. calculating crude 
pregnancy rates, patients actually treated taken account.
to compensate cancelled patients, patient drop-out, lifetable analysis
was performed. life-table analysis demonstrated 37.0 +/- 5.0% couples
attain successful pregnancy one completed ivf-icsi embryo transfer
(ivf-embryo transfer) cycle. following two three ivf-embryo transfer cycles, 
the pregnancy rates rose 56.8 +/- 6.0 73.4 +/- 6.9% respectively. overall 
pregnancy rates inversely related age. hiv seroconversions 
in treated patients delivered babies. concluded use of
ivf-icsi avoid disease transmission hiv-1 serodiscordant couples desiring
children appears safe yields high rates pregnancy. however, success 
is influenced woman's age.
