[the selection surveillance cadaver kidney recipients. recent development 
in graft immunology (author's transl)].

[article french]

descamps b.

this study, based results 252 cadaver kidney transplantations, shows that
some factors reflect individual immune response capacity, ability
to produce anti-hla antibodies, sex response hepatitis b virus, appear,
along hla compatibility, markedly influence renal graft survival and
leads us propose following new guide-line cadaver kidney recipient
selection: "good responders" (i.e., patients anti-hla antibodies,
females hbs ag negative individuals) close hla compatibility donor
(3 4 antigens common) necessary, need observed for
"non-responders" (i.e., patients without preformed anti-hla antibodies, males and
hbs ag persistent carriers). furthermore, review recent methods proposed for
detecting early cellular humoral manifestations rejection leads to
proposal following immunological monitoring transplant recipient.
systematic frequent testing circulating cytotoxic cells antibodies
against donor antigens, regular dosage complement factors nephretic
factor, investigations migration leukocyte inhibiting factor and
macrophage arming factor, possibly produced vitro lymphocytes. these
protocols recipient selection immunological monitoring henceforth 
applied may contribute improve cadaver kidney transplantation prognosis.
