as scientific community scrambles define ancestry lineages 
eight segments new pandemic h1n1 strain, looked unique genetic events
in virus's genome explain newly found enhanced virulence and
transmissibility among humans. genome annotations virus identified stop
mutation replacing serine codon 12 (s12stop) pb1-f2 protein, a
virulence factor influenza viruses. here, discuss significance of
this finding may contribute host specialization, explaining the
virtual absence h1n1 influenza virus strain pig populations. this
finding expected lead better understanding transmission and
pathogenesis 2009 pandemic strain.
