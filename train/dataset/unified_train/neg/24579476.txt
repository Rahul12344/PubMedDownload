objective: explore relationship effect lamivudine treatment 
of cirrhotic patients uncompensated hepatitis b hepatitis b virus
(hbv)genotypes hbv specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (ctl).
methods: 80 cases uncompensated cirrhotic hepatitis b (40 cases genotype 
b 40 genotype c), hbv dna positive, hbeag positive human leukocyte
antigen (hla)-a2 positive,were treated lamivudine 100 mg/d, one year later, 
its effect relationship hbv genotypes hbv specific ctl were
observed.
results: hbv dna turned negative:40 cases genotype b turned negative (100%).
in 9th 10th month treatment, one case genotype c had
ymdd variation respectively adefovir dipivoxil used treatment, the
rest 38 cases, hbv dna 26 cases (68.42%) turned negative,hbv dna negative rate
of patients genotype lower patients genotype b, chi2 = 
14.91, p < 0.01. hbeag turned negative: 18 cases genotype b (45%) turned
negative, patients genotype c (7 cases, 18.42%), chi2 =
6.32, p < 0.05. peripheral blood hbv specific ctl level: treatment, was
(0.33 +/- 0.03)% patients genotype b,higher patients with
genotype c [(0.11 +/- 0.02)%], = 8.12, p < 0.001. 1 year treatment: it
was (0.44 +/- 0.04)% patients genotype b, higher before
treatment, = 4.01, p < 0.001, also higher patients with
genotype c 1 year treatment [(0.23 +/- 0.03)%], = 5.63, p < 0.01, alanine
amino-transferase (alt) returned normal: 38 cases genotype b (95%)
returned normal, patients genotype c (28 cases,
73.68%), x2 = 6.79, p < 0.01.
conclusion: effect lamivudinein treatment cirrhotic patients with
uncompensated hepatitis b better patients genotype b patients
with genotype c, mechanism may related lower level hbv specific ctl 
in patients genotype c patients genotype b.
