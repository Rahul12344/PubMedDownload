the ≥ 10³⁰ bacteriophages earth relentlessly drive adaptive coevolution,
forcing generation protective mechanisms bacterial hosts. one
such bacterial phage-resistance system, toxin, consists protein toxin (toxn)
that inhibited vivo specific rna antitoxin (toxi); however, the
mechanisms toxicity inhibition defined. we
present crystal structure toxn-toxi complex pectobacterium
atrosepticum, determined 2.75-å resolution. toxi 36-nucleotide noncoding 
rna pseudoknot, three toxi monomers bind three toxn monomers generate a
trimeric toxn-toxi complex. assembly complex mediated entirely through
extensive rna-protein interactions. furthermore, 2'-3' cyclic phosphate 
3' end toxi, catalytic residues, identify toxn endornase that
processes toxi repetitive precursor regulated catalytic 
product.
