the influenza m2 (22-46) proton channel therapeutically targetable a
prototype proton transport across membranes. conduction initiation, requiring
a hydronium formed exceptionally high pka, remains nebulous. tackle the
problem focusing dynamic interplay protein structure and
solvent interface. identify two packing defects protein subunits that
predict exactly low high-affinity drug-binding sites. latter defect
frustrates water coordination, enhancing water basicity stabilizing the
nearby hydronium forms upon proton penetration channel. thus, the
trigger proton conduction directly related high-affinity binding
site. findings, quantitative agreement affinity measurements, are
consistent targetable functional nature protein packing defects.
these findings enable design proton-conducting biomimetic materials, where
the epistructure may engineered tune basicity interfacial water.
