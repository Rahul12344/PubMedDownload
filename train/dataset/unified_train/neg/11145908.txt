a characteristic feature hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection high frequency
of persistence progression chronic liver diseases. recent data suggest
that prevalent helper (th) 2 immunity well weak hcv-specific t-cell
response associated viral persistence. here, showed the
production interleukin 12 (il-12) nitric oxide (no) critical for
the induction th1 innate immunity, tumor necrosis factor
alpha (tnf-alpha), significantly suppressed hcv core-expressing
macrophage cell lines mouse peritoneal macrophages treated recombinant
core protein. addition, il-12 p40 promoter activity repressed the
presence hcv core macrophages stimulated lipopolysaccharride (lps)
following ifn-gamma treatment, indicating il-12 production may be
downregulated transcriptional level. also found proliferation t
cells ifn-gamma production mixed lymphocyte reactions (mlr) with
core-expressing cells inhibited. taken together, results suggest that
hcv core protein could play roles suppressing induction th1 immunity
through inhibition il-12 production.
