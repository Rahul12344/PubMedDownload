sixteen monoclonal antibodies (mabs) immunoprecipitated haemagglutinin 
neuraminidase (hn) chorio-allantoic membrane-grown avian paramyxovirus-3
(pmv-3) british turkeys produced. thirteen pmv-3 specific. three
were nonspecific also bound viral proteins bovine
kidney cells treated neuraminidase enzyme infected influenza virus. 
the thirteen specific mab defined four antigenic regions a-d competition and
variant selection assays. region subdivided five epitopes region b
into two epitopes. thirteen mab neutralized active in
haemagglutination inhibition (hi) twelve active haemolysis inhibition
(hli) tests. neuraminidase inhibition (ni) epitope-dependent. mabs five of
the epitopes a1, a2, a3, a5, c bound 1981 british turkey isolates 
not 1968 american turkey isolate. mab epitope a4 bound both
viruses. mabs epitopes b1, b2, also bound parakeet isolate of
pmv-3 third pmv-3 tested. mab b2 gave identical titres to
all three viruses hi, hli, ni activities. made potential
diagnostic reagent avian pmv-3 viruses. one nonspecific mabs bound 
lactose-like moieties reported influenza virus one maltose-like
moieties retroviruses. immunoglobulin three nonspecific mab had
some hi activity.
