purpose: complete digeorge syndrome (cdgs) describes subset patients with
digeorge syndrome thymic aplasia, thus risk severe
opportunistic infections. patients cdgs mycobacterial infection not
previously described. present case illustrate patients 
cdgs risk nontuberculous mycobacterial infections discuss
further antimicrobial prophylaxis prior thymic transplantation.
methods: 13-month old male identified cell deficient cell
receptor excision circle (trec) assay newborn screening, subsequently 
confirmed cdgs. presented fever cough, treated for
chronic aspiration pneumonia well pneumocystis jirovecii infection without 
significant improvement. biopsy mediastinal lymph nodes seen
on ct diagnosis disseminated mycobacterium kansasii made. we
reviewed literature regarding atypical mycobacterial infections and
prophylaxis used immunocompromised patients, well current data
regarding cdgs detection trec newborn screening.
results: multiple cases cdgs diagnosed via trec newborn screening,
however first patient cdgs disseminated mycobacterial
infection reported literature. thymic transplantation definitive 
treatment choice cdgs. prophylaxis either clarithromycin or
azithromycin shown reduce mycobacterial infections children with
advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection.
conclusions: children cdgs receive thymic transplantion soon as
possible, prior risk nontuberculous mycobacterial
infections. severe, opportunistic infections may require invasive testing for
diagnosis patients cdgs. antimicrobial prophylaxis considered
to prevent disseminated mycobacterial infection patients.
