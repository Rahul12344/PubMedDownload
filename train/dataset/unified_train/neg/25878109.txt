dynasore, small-molecule inhibitor gtpase activity dynamin, inhibits 
the entry several viruses, including herpes simplex virus (hsv), its
impact steps viral life cycle delineated. the
current study designed test hypothesis dynamin required for
viral protein trafficking thus pleiotropic inhibitory effects hsv
infection. dynasore inhibited hsv-1 hsv-2 infection human epithelial and
neuronal cells, including primary genital tract cells human fetal neurons and
astrocytes. similar results obtained cells transfected a
plasmid expressing dominant negative dynamin. kinetic studies demonstrated that
dynasore reduced number viral capsids reaching nuclear pore added
at time viral entry that, added late 8 h postentry,
dynasore blocked transport newly synthesized viral proteins the
nucleus cytosol. proximity ligation assays demonstrated treatment
with dynasore prevented colocalization vp5 dynamin. resulted a
reduction number viral capsids isolated sucrose gradients. fewer
capsids observed electron microscopy dynasore-treated cells in
control-treated cells. also reductions infectious progeny released 
into culture supernatants cell-to-cell spread. together, findings
suggest targeting dynamin-hsv interactions may provide new strategy for
hsv treatment prevention.importance: hsv infections remain global health
problem associated significant morbidity, particularly neonates and
immunocompromised hosts, highlighting need novel approaches treatment 
and prevention. current studies indicate dynamin plays role in
multiple steps viral life cycle provides new target antiviral
therapy. dynasore, small-molecule inhibitor dynamin, pleiotropic effects
on hsv-1 hsv-2 infection impedes viral entry, trafficking viral
proteins, capsid formation.
