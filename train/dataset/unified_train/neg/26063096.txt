the noroviruses considered leading cause outbreaks non-bacterial 
gastroenteritis worldwide. vaccine strategies norovirus currently
under consideration depend detailed knowledge capsid genotypes.
this study examined incidence norovirus outbreaks victoria 1 year 
(2013) documented genotypes occurring different outbreak settings 
(healthcare non-healthcare) age groups. found 63.1% of
gastroenteritis outbreaks associated norovirus, thereby showing
norovirus major viral cause illness gastroenteritis outbreaks.
sixteen capsid genotypes identified included gi.2, gi.3, gi.4, gi.6,
gi.7, gi.8, gi.9, gii.1, gii.2, gii.3, gii.4, gii.5, gii.6, gii.7, gii.13 
as yet unclassified gii genotype. genotypes found study, the
exception gi.9, detected elderly, indicating prior exposure a
norovirus genotype appear confer long term immunity many cases. the
incidence genotypes gii.1, gii.4 gii.7 linked setting age. as
setting age correlated possible determine variable
was critical exception gii.7, appeared linked age. the
findings indicate norovirus vaccine strategies encompass broad
range genotypes and, setting age may important determining
genotype incidence, taken account well.
