the envelope proteins hepadnaviruses highly cross-linked disulfide
bonds complete virions 20 nm subviral envelope particles. have
previously shown cysteines envelope proteins human
hepatitis b virus (hbv) essential assembly secretion 20 nm
particles structure major antigenic determinants (hbsag). 
we analyzed intermolecular disulfide bonds proteins. have
constructed mutants lacking cysteines analyzed capacity for
oligomerization cos-7 cells. demonstrate c121 c147 located 
second hydrophilic region carrying major antigenic determinants hbv 
protein participate intermolecular disulfide bonding. disulfide bond
involving c124 blocks accessibility arginine/lysine position 122, as
shown trypsin digestion cysteine mutants. alkylation studies using
n-ethyl-maleimide indicate c76, c90, and/or c221 carry free
sulfhydryl group(s) present 20 nm particles secreted cell lines.
