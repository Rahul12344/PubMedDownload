since hepatitis c virus (hcv), major causative agent posttransfusional
non-a, non-b hepatitis, positive stranded rna virus, supposed to
replicate via negative rna strand. although strand specific reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) method recently developed to
detect strand hcv rna, specificity strategy remained be
determined. study, using vitro transcribed positive negative
stranded hcv rnas mixed hepatic cellular rna normal liver, found
that strategy distinguish two rna strands, that
chemical modification rna samples 3' end followed strand specific
rt-pcr made specific detection possible. liver tissues, sera peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (pbmc) ten patients chronic hcv infection were
analyzed novel strategy rt-pcr combined rna modification.
positive negative strands hcv rna detected liver tissues ten
(100%) nine (90%) cases, respectively. negative rna strand detected also 
in sera five cases (50%), positive strand detected nine cases (90%). 
in pbmc, positive strand hcv rna detected eight cases (80%), whereas
negative strand one case (10%), suggesting hcv much less
cellular tropism pbmc hepatocytes.
