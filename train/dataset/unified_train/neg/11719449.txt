the ns1 protein influenza virus virulence factor counteracts the
pkr-mediated antiviral response host. consequence, influenza ns1 gene
knockout virus delns1 (an influenza virus lacking ns1 open reading frame)
fails replicate normal cells produces infectious particles in
pkr-deficient cells. known oncogenic ras induces inhibitor 
of pkr, addressed question whether delns1 virus selectively
replicates cells expressing oncogenic ras. show upon transfection 
expression oncogenic n-ras, cells become permissive productive delns1
virus replication, suggesting delns1 virus specific oncolytic
properties. viral growth oncogenic ras-transfected cells associated
with reduction pkr activation infection. moreover, treatment s.c. 
established n-ras-expressing melanomas severe combined immunodeficiency mice
with delns1 virus revealed virus tumor-ablative potentials. the
delns1 virus replicate nonmalignant cell lines melanocytes,
keratinocytes, endothelial cells. apathogenic nature delns1 virus
combined selective replication properties virus oncogenic
ras-expressing cells renders virus attractive candidate therapy
of tumors activated ras-signaling pathway.
