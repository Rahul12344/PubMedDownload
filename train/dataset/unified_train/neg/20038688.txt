we investigated potential niche separation two closely related (99.1% 16s rrna
gene sequence similarity) syntopic bacterial strains affiliated r-bt065 
cluster, represents subgroup genus limnohabitans. two strains,
designated b4 d5, isolated concurrently freshwater reservoir.
differences strains examined monitoring interactions
with bacterial competitor, flectobacillus sp. (fl), virus- and
predator-induced mortality. batch-type cocultures, designated b4+fl d5+fl,
were initiated similar biomass ratio among strains. proportion 
each cell type present cocultures monitored based clear differences
in cell sizes. following exponential growth 28 h, cocultures amended
by addition two different concentrations live heat-inactivated
viruses concentrated reservoir. half virus-amended treatments were
inoculated immediately axenic flagellate predator, poterioochromonas sp. 
the presence predator, live viruses, competition the
strains significantly affected population dynamics experimentally
manipulated treatments. strains b4 fl appeared vulnerable to
environmental viruses, strain d5 not. predator-induced mortality the
greatest impact fl, followed d5 b4. virus-vulnerable
b4 strain smaller cells lower biomass yield, less subject to
grazing. contrast, seemingly virus-resistant d5, slightly larger
grazing-vulnerable cells, competitive fl. overall, data suggest
contrasting ecophysiological capabilities partial niche separation two
coexisting limnohabitans strains.
