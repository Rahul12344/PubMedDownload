mosquitoes natural vectors many etiologic agents human viral diseases.
mosquito-borne flaviviruses persistently infect mosquito central nervous 
system without causing dramatic pathology influencing mosquito behavior
and lifespan. mechanism mosquito nervous system resists
flaviviral infection still largely unknown. report aedes
aegypti homologue neural factor hikaru genki (aahig) efficiently restricts
flavivirus infection central nervous system. aahig predominantly
expressed mosquito nervous system localized plasma membrane 
neural cells. functional blockade aahig enhanced dengue virus (denv) and
japanese encephalitis virus (jev), sindbis virus (sinv), replication in
mosquito heads consequently caused neural apoptosis dramatic reduction 
in mosquito lifespan. consistently, delivery recombinant aahig to
mosquitoes reduced viral infection. furthermore, membrane-localized aahig
directly interfaced highly conserved motif surface envelope
proteins denv jev, consequently interrupted endocytic viral entry into
mosquito cells. loss either plasma membrane targeting virion-binding
ability rendered aahig nonfunctional. interestingly, culex pipien pallens hig
also demonstrated prominent anti-flavivirus activity, suggesting functionally
conserved function hig. results demonstrate evolutionarily
conserved antiviral mechanism prevents lethal flaviviral infection central
nervous system mosquitoes, thus may facilitate flaviviral transmission
