human t-lymphotropic viruses type 1 (htlv-1) type 2 (htlv-2) present very
similar genomic structures htlv-1 pathogenic htlv-2. this
difference due transactivating tax proteins, tax-1 tax-2, 
responsible viral cellular gene activation? tax-1 tax-2 differ 
their cellular localization interaction pattern cellular
factors? review, summarize tax-1 tax-2 structural phenotypic
properties, interaction factors involved signal transduction and
their localization-related behavior within cell. special attention be
given distinctions tax-1 tax-2 likely play important
role transactivation activity.
