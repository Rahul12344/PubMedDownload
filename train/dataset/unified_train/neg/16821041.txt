we developed cucumber mosaic virus (cmv) plant virus vector especially 
for production pharmaceutical proteins. cmv vector vector modifiable 
for different host plants require engineering steps. cmv
contains three genomic rna molecules (rnas 1-3) necessary infectivity. with
this system, instead creating different vector constructs plant we
use, take advantage formation pseudrecombinants two cmv
isolates simply reassembling vector construct (rna 2 base) rna
molecule containing host determinant (mostly rna 3). study, gene 
for acidic fibroblast growth factor (afgf), one human cytokines, was
cloned control subgenomic promoter rna 4a cmv-based
vector, c2-h1. infected nicotiana benthamiana plants produced afgf levels up
to 5-8% total soluble protein. tobacco-produced afgf purified, and
its biological activity confirmed. using system, provides a
versatile viable strategy production therapeutic proteins in
plants, also demonstrated high level afgf glycine max (soybean) and
arabidopsis thaliana.
