the serial interval (si) human influenza virus infections often described
by single distribution. understanding sources variation si could
provide valuable information understanding influenza transmission dynamics.
using data randomized household study nonpharmaceutical interventions
to prevent influenza transmission bangkok, thailand, 34 months between
2008 2011, estimated influence influenza virus type/subtype and
other characteristics 251 pediatric index cases 315 infected
household contacts estimates household si. mean si households
was 3.3 days. relative influenza a(h1n1)pdm09 (3.1 days), si influenza
b (3.7 days) 22% longer (95% confidence interval: 4, 43), half a
day. sis influenza viruses a(h1n1) a(h3n2) similar for
a(h1n1)pdm09. sis shortest older index cases (age 11-14 years) for
younger infected household contacts (age ≤15 years). greater time spent in
proximity index child associated shorter sis. differences 
si might reflect differences incubation period, viral shedding, contact, or
susceptibility. findings could improve parameterization mathematical
models better predict impact epidemic pandemic influenza mitigation 
strategies.
