background: investigate expression il-6 non?replicating vaccinia virus
and immune effects recombinant virus.
methods: recombinant non replicating vaccinia virus rvj123 delta ck11 beta
75il6 constructed non?replicating vaccinia virus vector
pneock11beta75il6 replicating vaccinia virus rvj123. animal model,
immunization recombinant virus carried immune response
was studied.
results: recombinant virus could express il-nd hbsag simultaneously. southern
blot analysis demonstrated genes vaccinia virus hind? c k
fragments deleted il-6 gene integrated stably. given intranasal
inocula virus immunize balb/c mouse new zealand rabbit, the
elevated anti-hbsag iga igg antibody secreting cells mouse lung lymphoid
to vectors expressing il-6 two?fold higher level elicited
by control virus day 14 immunization. authors also could detect elevated
anti-hbsag iga igg antibody conversion mouse serum lung fluid, rabbits
serum, lung fluid, saliva, vagina nasal washing samples.
conclusions: il-6 expressed non-replicating recombinant vaccinia virus could
enhance induced?immune effects, could serve effective adjuvant 
recombinant vector vaccine.
