increasingly mechanistic virology studies require dependable sensitive
methods isolating purified organelles containing functional cellular
sub-domains. mitochondrial network is, part, closely apposed the
endoplasmic reticulum (er). mitochondria-associated membrane (mam) fraction
provides direct physical contact er mitochondria.
characterization dual localization trafficking human
cytomegalovirus (hcmv) ul37 proteins required establishing protocols the
er mitochondria could reliably separated. documented role
in lipid ceramide transfer er mitochondria, method purify
mam infected cells also developed. two robust procedures developed 
to efficiently isolate mitochondria, er, mam fractions providing
substantial protein yields hcmv-infected primary fibroblasts from
transfected hela cells. furthermore, unit includes protocols isolation
of detergent resistant membranes subcellular fractions well techniques
that allow visualization mitochondrial network disruption occurs in
permissively infected cells optimal resolution percoll gradients.
