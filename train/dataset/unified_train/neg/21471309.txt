equine sarcoids represent common skin tumours equids worldwide,
characterized extensive invasion infiltration lymphatics, rare
regression high recurrence surgical intervention. bovine papillomavirus
type-1 (bpv-1) less commonly bpv-2 causative agents diseases. 
it demonstrated bpv-1 viral gene expression necessary for
maintaining transformation phenotype. however, underlying mechanism for
bpv-1 transformation remains largely unknown, cellular factors involved
in transformation fully understood. previously mitogen-activated protein 
kinase (mapk) signalling pathway shown important cellular
transformation. study investigated role p38 mapk (p38) the
transformation equine fibroblasts bpv-1. elevated expression of
phosphorylated p38 observed bpv-1 expressing fibroblasts due the
expression bpv-1 e5 e6. phosphorylation mk2 kinase, substrate
of p38, also enhanced. inhibition p38 activity selective inhibitor 
sb203580 changed cell morphology, reduced proliferation sarcoid
fibroblasts inhibited cellular invasiveness, indicating indispensable
role p38 bpv-1 transformation equine fibroblasts. findings provide
new insights pathogenesis equine sarcoids suggest p38 could 
be potential target equine sarcoid therapy.
