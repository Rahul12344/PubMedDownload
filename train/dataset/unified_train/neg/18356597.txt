objectives: toll-like receptors (tlr) important pathogen recognition and
may play role hiv disease. evaluated effect chronic untreated 
treated hiv-1 infection systemic tlr expression tlr signalling.
methods: two hundred hiv-infected uninfected women kenya cohort
participated studies. tlr1 tlr10 messenger rna expression was
determined quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc). tlr ligand responsiveness was
determined using ex-vivo pbmc cytokine production culture
supernatants.
results: chronic, untreated hiv-1 infection significantly associated with
increased mrna expression tlr6, tlr7, tlr8 analysis limited
to advanced disease (cd4 cell count < 200 cells/ml) tlr2, tlr3, and
tlr4 additionally elevated. tlr expression correlated plasma
hiv-rna load, significant tlr6 tlr7. vitro hiv
single-stranded rna alone could enhance tlr mrna expression. pbmc hiv-infected
subjects also demonstrated profoundly increased proinflammatory responsiveness to
tlr ligands, suggesting sensitization tlr signalling hiv. finally, viral
suppression haart associated normalization tlr levels.
conclusion: together, data indicate chronic viraemic hiv-1 is
associated increased tlr expression responsiveness, may perpetuate
innate immune dysfunction activation underlies hiv pathogenesis, and
thus reveal potential new targets therapy.
