the development hcmv vaccines prevention congenital hcmv been
identified top priority institute medicine (usa), virus
infection important endpoint efficacy evaluation candidate
vaccines. however, technically difficult capture hcmv viremia or
uremia infected individuals viremia uremia detected only
transiently acute infection, people infected are
asymptomatic. thus, much desired develop serological assay for
effectively distinguishing anti-hcmv antibodies result natural infection 
from elicited subunit antigen vaccination. study, five hcmv
proteins antigens commonly used subunit vaccine candidates were
expressed escherichia coli purified, them, hcmv tegument
protein pp150 exhibited robust reactivity seropositive sera the
faintest cross reaction seronegative sera. coefficient variability
less 15%, elisa based pp150 antigen (pp150-elisa) showed 100%
(366/366) sensitivity 100% (77/77) specificity (using neutralizing activity
as gold standard) good quantitative correlation in-house elisa
based virus lysate antigens. taken together, results indicate that
pp150-elisa, comparable performance generally used assays based on
virus lysate antigens, might provide simple method detect hcmv infection 
reactivation could useful future hcmv subunit vaccine efficacy trials.
