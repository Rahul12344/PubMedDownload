background: human enterovirus d68 (ev-d68) first isolated 1962 has
aroused public concern recently nationwide outbreak among children
in 2014-2015 usa. symptoms include fever, runny nose, sneezing, cough 
and muscle pains. might associated severe respiratory illness in
individuals pre-existing respiratory conditions potential
association acute flaccid myelitis investigation. asia, ev-d68
cases reported several countries.
the study: aimed understand ev-d68 prevalence genetic
diversity hong kong children.
methods: total 10â€‰695 nasopharyngeal aspirate (npa) samples from
hospitalised patients aged <18 years collected september 2014 to
december 2015 two regional hospitals. npas tested positive for
enterovirus/rhinovirus (ev/rv) selected genotyping. identified
as ev-d68, complete coding sequences (cdss) obtained sanger
sequencing. maximum-likelihood phylogeny constructed using ev-d68
complete coding sequences available genbank (n=482).
results: 2662/10 695 (24.9%) tested positive ev/rv 882/2662 (33.1%)
were selected randomly subjected molecular classification. ev-d68 was
detected 15 (1.70%) samples patients clinical presentations ranging 
from wheezing pneumonia belonged subclade b3. eight cdss were
successfully obtained. total 10 amino acid residue polymorphisms were
detected viral capsid proteins, proteases, atpase rna polymerase.
conclusion: b3 subclade subclade found locally. surveillance of
ev-d68 raises public awareness provides information determine most
relevant genotypes vaccine development.
