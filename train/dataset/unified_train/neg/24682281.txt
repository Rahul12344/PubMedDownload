a central question protein molecular evolution whether amino acid that
occurs given site makes independent contribution fitness whether
its contribution depends amino acid sites protein sequence, a
phenomenon known intragenic epistasis. absence intragenic epistasis,
natural selection acts protein mutation independent genetic
background, experimentally determined fitness mutation be
the across genetic backgrounds. tested hypothesis using
site-directed mutagenesis introduce well-characterized deleterious single
amino acid substitution 56 different hepatitis c virus ns3 protease variants. 
the catalytic efficiency mutated proteases determined compared
with corresponding wild-type protein. fitness effects ranged lethality
to significantly beneficial. although primarily deleterious lethal effects
were observed (41 5 56 tested variants, respectively), deleterious
effects ranged near neutral (-26.7% reduction fitness) near lethal
(-98.5%). findings demonstrate introduced amino acid substitution
has different fitness effects different protein variants provide
independent support relevant role intragenic epistasis protein
evolution.
