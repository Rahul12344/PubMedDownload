new hits hiv-1 wild-type y181c drug-resistant reverse transcriptases 
were predicted taking account possibility known
metabolism interactions. silico hits set antitargets (i.e.,
proteins nucleic acids off-targets desired pharmaceutical
target objective) used predict simple, visual measure possible
interactions ligands, helps introduce early safety
considerations design compounds lead optimization. this
combined approach consists consensus docking scoring: cross-docking a
group wild-type drug-resistant mutant proteins, ligand efficiency (also
called binding efficiency) indices new ranking measures, pre- postdocking 
filters, set antitargets estimation, minimization atomic clashes.
diverse, small-molecule compounds new chemistry (such triazine core
with aromatic side chains) well known drugs different applications
(oxazepam, chlorthalidone) highly ranked targets binding
interactions functional group spatial arrangements similar known 
inhibitors, moderate low binders antitargets. results
are discussed basis relevance medicinal computational
chemistry. optimization ligands targets off-targets antitargets is
foreseen critical compounds directed several simultaneous sites.
