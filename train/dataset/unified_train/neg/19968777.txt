background/aims: transcription factors coupled cyclic adenosine mono phosphate
(camp) signalling camp-responsive elements binding (creb)/atf family
constitute family activators repressors bind camp-responsive
promoter elements (cres) regulatory regions camp-inducible genes. a
role creb/atf family advocated control hepatocellular
carcinoma progression. creb appears activated x protein hepatitis
b virus, links unphosphorylated form creb activates
transcription, thus obviating otherwise indispensable ser-133 phosphorylation.
identification factors capable triggering transcription via camp-responsive
elements modulator (crem)/creb signalling absence ser phosphorylation
will improve knowledge molecular mechanism liver cell
proliferation.
methods: isolate study proteins binding activating creb and/or crem in
the liver, performed screening mouse liver cdna library using the
two-hybrid system.
results: report identification characterization novel peptide,
vtip-peptide (vtip-p), binds enhances activation crem/creb,
obviating need transcription factor phosphorylation. demonstrated that
vtip-p physically interacts activation domain (ad) transcription 
factors creb/crem activates transcription modifying phosphorylation 
pattern hepatoma cells. data allowed conclusion vtip-p binds 
ad creb crem stabilizing phosphorylation.
conclusion: characterization molecules capable interfering liver
with important pathway creb could significant designing and/or
developing new therapeutic approaches control liver cell proliferation.
