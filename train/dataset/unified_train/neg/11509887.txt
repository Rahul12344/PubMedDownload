a hepatitis b virus (hbv) carrier positive hepatitis b surface (hbs)
antigen negative hepatitis b core (hbc) antibody despite persistent hbv
infection, designated hepatitis b virus 2 (hbv2). hbv2 reported
to induced mild-grade hepatitis. patients hbv2 reported in
taiwan senegal. present study, determined nucleotide (nt)
sequence precore/core gene coding region x gene region hbv dna 
sequence 7 subjects positive hbs antigen negative hbc
antibody. hbv dna detected nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr). nested 
pcr carried amplify precore/core x open reading frames (orfs) 
of hbv dna. second pcr products sequenced, followed investigation 
nt homology. deletions insertions nt sequence the
precore/core x orfs hbv dna 7 patients, mutations were
found sporadically 7 patients. also, common amino acid 
substitutions examined regions amino acid sequence hbv 7 
patients, could find common mutation examined regions hbv 
dna could potentially contribute development negativity hbc
antibody. thus, suggested negativity hbc antibody patients with
hbv2 due immune response abnormality host.
