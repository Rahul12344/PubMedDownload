a method screening recombinant lambda libraries devised select phage
containing genomic regions containing provirus insertions retroviruses that
carry kanamycin g418 resistance factor neo origin replication 
derived pbr322 (oripbr). recombinants phagemids, able replicate 
as bacteriophages plasmids lambda repressor control. lambda repressor
was cloned plasmid derived psc101 compatible with
pbr322-derived phagemids. strain carrying plasmid may used select
phagemids derived single proviral insertion 100% efficiency from
complex recombinant libraries. homologous recombination proviral long
terminal repeats observed rate 10(-4)/plaque-forming unit recabc+ 
strains. despite frequency, intact phagemids easily recovered phage
after temperature shift 42 degrees c. since oripbr selectable
marker system, method could applied recover sequence
carrying ori sequence pbr322.
