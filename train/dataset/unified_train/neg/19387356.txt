introduction: advances laboratory methods capable detecting recent hiv
infection offer promise quickly efficiently measuring hiv incidence in
cross-sectional surveys, thereby greatly expanding capabilities of
surveillance programs. compared hiv-1 incidence estimates derived 3
different methods: vironostika-less sensitive, bed capture enzyme immuno assay
(bed-ceia), repeat testing history.
methods: cross-sectional analysis performed using hiv testing data the
population men sex men presenting serological hiv
voluntary counseling testing largest testing programs san francisco
from 2000 2004 (n = 15,010). specimens evaluated recent hiv-1
infection using vironostika-ls bed-ceia. concordance 2 assays was
assessed using kappa statistic.
results: bed-ceia vironostika-ls concurred 90% specimen
classifications (kappa = 0.77; "good" strength agreement). predictors of
recent hiv-1 infection common methods unprotected receptive anal
intercourse (p < 0.001), sex known hiv-positive partner (p < 0.001), and
amphetamine use (p < 0.01). temporal trends hiv-1 incidence also
consistent stable.
conclusions: good concordance classification recent hiv-1
infection bed-ceia vironostika-ls correlates of
acquisition infection. findings suggest incidence assays be
used basic epidemiological purposes measuring hiv-1 incidence,
identifying populations risk infection, tracking leading edge of
the epidemic time.
