tomato spotted wilt virus (tswv) transmitted persistent propagative
manner frankliniella occidentalis, western flower thrips. well
established vector competence depends tswv acquisition young larvae
and virus replication within insect, biological factors associated with
frequency transmission well characterized. hypothesized 
the number transmission events single adult thrips determined, in
part, amount virus harbored (titer) insect. transmission
time-course experiments conducted using leaf disk assay determine the
efficiency frequency tswv transmission following 2-day inoculation access 
periods (iaps). virus titer individual adult thrips determined by
real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-pcr (qrt-pcr) end the
experiments. average, 59% adults transmitted virus first iap
(2 3 days post adult-eclosion). male thrips efficient at
transmitting tswv multiple times compared female thrips cohort. 
however, females harbored two three times copies tswv-n rna per
insect, indicating factors absolute virus titer insect
contribute successful transmission event. examination virus titer in
individual insects end third iap (7 days post adult-eclosion)
revealed significant consistent positive associations frequency of
transmission virus titer. data support hypothesis viruliferous
thrips likely transmit multiple times harbors high titer of
virus. quantitative relationship provides new insights biological
parameters may influence spread tswv thrips.
