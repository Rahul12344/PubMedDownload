background: treatment chronic hepatitis c (chc) evolved rapidly due the
invention interferon-free direct antiviral agents. previous clinical trials
showed combination therapy paritaprevir/ritonavir, ombitasvir, dasabuvir
(prod) without ribavirin (rbv) cure 95% genotype 1 chc
patients, regardless cirrhosis not. however, real-world data regarding
the efficacy safety prod-based therapy asian hcv genotype 1 chc
patients limited, especially advanced-fibrotic patients failed
previous therapy pegylated interferon (peg-ifn) plus rbv.
methods: january october 2017, 60 advanced fibrotic (≥f3) genotype 1 
chc patients failed previous therapy peg-ifn received prod-based
therapy 12 weeks retrospectively enrolled. weight-based rbv 800 to
1200 mg/d added genotype 1b patients cirrhosis genotype 1a
patients. sustained virological response (svr) defined undetectable hcv
rna end 12 weeks completion therapy.
results: mean age 63.2 ± 9.3 years, 26 (43.3%) males 20 
(33.3%) diagnosed liver cirrhosis. mean baseline hcv rna level
was 6.19 ± 0.88 log10 iu/ml 86.7% (52/60) patients infected hcv
genotype 1b. prod-based therapy, rates undetectable hcv rna (<15 iu/ml)
at week 2, 4, 12 61.7%, 90.0%, 100%, respectively; 69.6% (16/23) 
patients detectable hcv rna week 2 < 100 iu/ml. pruritus, fatigue,
headache, insomnia, dizziness common patient-reported adverse
events. grade 2 hyperbilirubinemia found 21.6% (13/60) patients during
study period belonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. after
posttherapy follow up, 60 patients (100%) achieved svr.
conclusion: real-world data taiwan revealed prod-based rescue therapy
is well-tolerated highly effective genotype 1 chc patients advanced 
fibrosis failing previous therapy peg-ifn plus rbv.
