setting: adult human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) clinics affiliated the
university cape town, south africa.
objective: assess impact tuberculosis hiv-1 disease progression in
an area high tuberculosis prevalence minimal antiretroviral therapy use.
design: prospective patient cohort study.
methods: age, race, risk status, cd4+ t-lymphocyte count, history aids,
prophylactic co-trimoxazole antiretroviral therapy controlled a
time-dependent cox proportional hazards regression model.
results: tuberculosis fulfilling case definition developed 158/609
patients 5-year observation period. tuberculosis associated an
increased risk aids (adjusted risk ratio [rr] = 1.60, 95% confidence interval 
[ci] 1.08-2.41; p = 0.02) death (adjusted rr = 2.16, 95% ci 1.29-3.59; p =
0.003). stratified analysis, increased mortality associated with
tuberculosis observed patients cd4+ t-lymphocyte count > 200
cells/microliter without aids baseline.
conclusion: onset tuberculosis hiv-infected patients associated with
an increased risk aids death. although causal link cannot established
in observational study, findings support view prolonged immune
activation induced tuberculosis leads prolonged increased hiv replication
and consequent accelerated disease progression.
