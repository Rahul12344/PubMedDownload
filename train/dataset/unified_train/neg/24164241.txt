although pharmacologic therapies provided gains reducing mortality of
heart failure, rising incidence disease requires new approaches to
combat health burden. twenty-five years ago, abnormal calcium cycling was
identified characteristic failing human myocardium. sarcoplasmic
reticulum calcium atpase (serca2a), sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump, 
found key factor alteration calcium cycling. the
advancement gene vectors, serca2a emerged attractive clinical target for
gene delivery purposes. using adeno-associated virus constructs, serca2a
upregulation found improve myocardial function animal models. 
clinical benefits overexpressing serca2a demonstrated phase i
study calcium upregulation percutaneous administration gene therapy in
cardiac disease (cupid). study demonstrated persistent expression
of transgene serca2a associated significant improvement in
associated biochemical alterations clinical symptoms heart failure. the
coming years, additional targets likely emerge amenable genetic 
manipulations along development advanced vector systems with
safer delivery approaches.
