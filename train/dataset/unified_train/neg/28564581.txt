the nf-κb family transcription factors regulate wide spectrum biological
processes, particular immune responses. studies human suggest 
nf-κb repressing factor (nkrf) negatively regulates activity nf-κb through
a direct protein-protein interaction. however, function nkrf 
studied outside mammals now. current study identified nkrf gene
(lvnkrf) pacific white shrimp, litopenaeus vannamei, showed
homology nkrfs insects, fishes mammals. lvnkrf high expressed
in intestine, stomach muscle tissues localized nucleus. lvnkrf
could interact dorsal relish, two members shrimp nf-κb
family. interestingly, although sharing similar protein structure 
human nkrf, lvnkrf showed inhibitory instead enhancing effects on
activities dorsal relish, contrary mammalian nkrfs. 
the expression lvnkrf could induced gram-positive -negative
bacteria immunostimulants lipopolysaccharide (lps) poly (i:c) was
significantly up-regulated white spot syndrome virus (wssv) infection.
silencing lvnkrf significantly decreased mortalities shrimp caused by
wssv infection down-regulated wssv copies expression wssv
structural gene tissues. suggested lvnkrf could facilitate the
infection shrimp wssv, may additional strategy wssv to
hijack host nf-κb pathway favor replication. current study
could provide valuable context investigating evolutionary
derivation nkrfs facilitate study regulatory mechanisms of
invertebrate nf-κb pathways.
