transcription adenovirus 2 major late peptide ix genes conditions of
in vitro nucleosome assembly.

matsui t.

plasmid dna containing adenovirus 2 major late peptide ix genes assembled
into nucleosomes vitro, assembled nucleosomes used template 
to study regulatory mechanism transcription initiation these
conditions. neither major late peptide ix genes transcribed the
already-assembled nucleosomes. however, major late gene, peptide 
ix gene, transcribed efficiently dna incubated hela cell
extracts prior assembly nucleosomes. results indicate that
prebinding component cell extracts dna essential activate
transcription major late gene nucleosomes assembled the
conditions used here. since gene ix nucleosomes transcriptionally 
active regardless preincubation dna extracts, component
or another, different template structure able identified an
in vitro system deproteinized dna template might required activation 
of peptide ix gene transcription. know function upstream sequences 
of major late gene, effects deletion transcription nucleosomes
were compared deproteinized dna. result showed depression
of transcription deleting upstream sequences effect on
nucleosomes deproteinized dna.
