the rotavirus genome codes two glycoproteins: outer capsid structural
glycoprotein (vp7, apparent molecular weight 38,000 (38k)) nonstructural
glycoprotein (ns28k). synthesis glycoproteins analyzed in
infected cells cell-free system derived rabbit reticulocyte lysates
supplemented dog pancreatic microsomes. data showed 37k product
synthesized cell-free system precursor 38k glycoprotein 
that 37k polypeptide contains cleavable signal sequence (apparent molecular
weight 1.5k). 37k polypeptide glycosylated vitro presence of
microsomal membranes polypeptide 38k immunoprecipitated by
monospecific antiserum vp7. endo h digestion 38k polypeptides from
either infected cells cell-free system produced polypeptides identical 
molecular weight, 35.5k (the glycoprotein precursor lacking signal sequence).
these results confirmed comparative studies variant sa11 that
is defective glycosylation vp7. similar experiments 20k precursor 
to 29k nonstructural glycoprotein showed 20k polypeptide contains a
noncleavable signal sequence. glycoproteins inserted microsomal
membranes processed via oligosaccharide trimming.
