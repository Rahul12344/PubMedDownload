we assayed presence human polyomaviruses urine autoimmune
disease patients, systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), sjogren's syndrome 
(ss), rheumatoid arthritis (ra), dermatomyositis/polymositis (dm/pm), pcr. 
the results indicate approximately 40% patients jcv positive 15%
of jcv positive patients also infected bkv time according
to southern blot dna sequencing pcr products. interestingly, jcv
present autoimmune diseases patients taiwan-1, taiwan-2, taiwan-3
strains pentanucleotide-a (gggaa) and/or -b (aaagc) deletions within the
regulatory region. addition, bkv found examined samples taichung-1
and taichung-2 strains. taichung-1 two nucleotide alterations taichung-2 
had six nucleotide differences within regulatory region compared ww
bkv archetype. although examined autoimmune diseases patients included ra,
sle, pm, dm, ss patients, appears correlation disease 
and virus strains. however, taiwan-2 strain jcv two copies of
pentanucleotide-a deletion present patient longest period 
immunosuppressive medication.
