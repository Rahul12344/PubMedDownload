host antibody response toxin molecules major obstacle use of
immunotoxins efficacious agents treatment human cancer other
diseases. study, genetic form immunotoxin designed which
should eliminate toxin immunogenicity replacing toxin protein moiety 
weakly immunogenic nonimmunogenic plasmid dna. recombinant bifunctional
fusion protein, consists human antibody fab targeting moiety [directed
against gp120, envelope glycoprotein human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-1]
and human dna binding moiety (protamine), used gene carrier. toxin
plasmid dnas expressing catalytic fragment pseudomonas exotoxin (pea)
statically interact fusion proteins form soluble protein-dna
complexes. complexes specifically transferred hiv-1-infected cells
by receptor-mediated endocytosis, resulting selective killing target
cells. 'genetic immunotoxins' may significant advantages protein 
immunotoxins treatment variety human diseases.
