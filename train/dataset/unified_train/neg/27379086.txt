pathogens, especially viruses, evolve abilities utilize cellular machineries
to facilitate survival propagation. post-translational modifications
(ptms), especially phosphorylation sumoylation, reversibly modulate 
function interactions target proteins among important
features cell signaling pathways. ptm-dependent events also serve one of
the favorite targets viruses. among seven unambiguous human oncogenic
viruses, hepatitis b virus (hbv), hepatitis c virus (hcv), epstein-barr virus
(ebv), kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv), human papillomavirus
(hpv), human lymphotrophic virus-1 (htlv-1), merkel cell polyomavirus
(mcpyv), two herpesviruses. life cycle herpesviruses consists of
latent lytic phases rapid switch states includes global
remodeling viral genome heterochromatin-to-euchromatin. balance
between lytic replication latency essential herpesvirus maintain 
persistent infection combination viral propagation evasion of
the host immune response, consequently may contribute tumorigenesis. 
is surprise swift reversibility ptms, especially sumoylation, a
modification epigenetically regulates chromatin structure, major hijack
target host oncogenic herpesviruses. brief review, we
summarize varied ways herpesviruses engage host immune
components ptms, focusing phosphorylation sumoylation.
