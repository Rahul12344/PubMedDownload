aims: dendritic cell (dc)-based cancer immunotherapy requires immunogenic
tumor associated antigen (taa) effective strategy presentation 
lymphocytes. here, explored whether transduction dcs lentiviruses
(lvs) expressing fusion protein secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine (slc)
and mucin 1 (muc1) could stimulate antigen-specific cytotoxic cells (ctls) to
human cancer cells vitro.
materials methods: hla-a2+ peripheral blood monocyte-derived dcs were
transduced recombinant lentiviruses lv different multiplicities of
infection (moi), muc1, slc slc-muc1 mrna protein detected by
rt-pcr western blotting, respectively. transduction efficiencies and
phenotypes dcs evaluated flow cytometry. induction lymphocyte
proliferation dcs examined cell count kit-8 (cck-8). ctl activities
against tumor cells analyzed lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) cytotoxicity and
enzyme-linked immunospot (elispot) assays.
results: stable expression muc1, slc slc-muc1 obtained dcs
transduced recombinant lvs, transduction efficiencies were
dose-dependent. transduction lvs appreciably change dc
phenotype. ctl induced lv muc1 dcs potently specifically lysed the
hla-a2+, muc1+colon cancer cell line hct-116. moreover, cytolytic activity
against hct-116 enhanced ctl stimulated lv slc-muc1 dcs.
conclusions: dcs transduced muc1 could induce effective cytolytic activity
against tumor cells antigen-specific hla-restricted fashion vitro,
and slc promoted muc1-specific anti-tumor activity. transduction dcs 
lv slc- muc1 may promising strategy dc-based cancer immunotherapy.
