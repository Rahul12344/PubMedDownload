transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (irf3) nuclear factor κb
(nfκb) activated external stimuli, including virus infection, to
translocate nucleus bind genomic targets important immunity and
inflammation. investigate rna polymerase ii (pol ii) recruitment and
elongation human antiviral gene regulatory network, comprehensive
genome-wide analysis conducted initial phase virus infection.
results reveal extensive integration irf3 nfκb pol ii associated 
machinery implicate partners antiviral transcription. analysis indicates 
that de novo polymerase recruitment stimulated release paused
polymerase work together control virus-induced gene activation. addition to
known messenger-rna-encoding loci, irf3 nfκb stimulate transcription at
regions previously associated antiviral transcription, including
abundant unannotated loci encode novel virus-inducible rnas (nvirnas). these
nvirnas widely induced virus infections diverse cell types and
represent previously overlooked cellular response virus infection.
