canine parvovirus (cpv) type-2 emerged new virus infecting dogs 1978, and
it probably derived variant feline panleukopenia virus a
closely related virus infecting another carnivore. cpv type-2 subsequently
replaced nature antigenically variant viruses (cpv type-2a cpv type-2b)
which coexist dog populations worldwide. show cpv type-2 isolates 
did replicate cats, cpv type-2a cpv type-2b isolates
replicated efficiently. 10% viruses isolated cats natural 
parvovirus disease antigenically indistinguishable cpv type-2a or
type-2b. capsid protein gene sequence 1990 feline parvovirus isolate
("fpv-24") essentially identical sequence cpv type-2b viruses 
dogs. loss reacquisition feline host range cpv likely 
due case small numbers changes region virus capsid
where three protein monomers interact.
