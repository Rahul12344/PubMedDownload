background: influence tobacco smoking immune system hiv infected
individuals largely unknown. investigated impact tobacco smoking 
immune activation, microbial translocation, immune exhaustion t-cell function
in hiv infected individuals.
method: hiv infected smokers non-smokers (n = 25 each) documented viral 
suppression combination antiretroviral therapy hiv uninfected smokers 
non-smokers (n = 15 each) enrolled. markers immune activation (cd38 and
hla-dr) immune exhaustion (pd1, tim3 ctla4) analyzed peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) flow cytometry. plasma markers microbial
translocation (soluble-cd14 - scd14 lipopolysaccharide - lps) measured. 
antigen specific functions cd4+ cd8+ t-cells measured, flow
cytometry, pbmcs 6 hours stimulation cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr 
virus influenza virus (cef) peptide pool.
results: compared non-smokers, smokers hiv infected uninfected groups
showed significantly higher cd4+ cd8+ t-cell activation increased
frequencies cd38+hla-dr+ cells higher magnitude hiv infected
smokers. expressions immune exhaustion markers (pd1, tim3 ctla4) either
alone combinations significantly higher smokers, especially cd4+
t-cells. compared hiv uninfected non-smokers, microbial translocation (scd14
and lps) higher smokers groups directly correlated cd4+
and cd8+ t-cell activation. antigen specific t-cell function showed significantly
lower cytokine response cd4+ cd8+ t-cells cef peptide-pool stimulation 
in smokers hiv infected uninfected groups.
conclusions: results suggest smoking hiv infection independently
influence t-cell immune activation function together present the
worst immune profile. since smoking widespread among hiv infected individuals,
studies warranted evaluate cumulative effect smoking on
impairment immune system accelerated disease progression.
