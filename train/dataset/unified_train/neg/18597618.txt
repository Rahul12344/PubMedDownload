background: intermittent administration interleukin-2 (il-2) human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv)- infected patients antiretroviral therapy (art)
is capable inducing significant increases cd4 cell counts result 
increased cell survival decreased cell turnover. however, role the
setting art interruptions (sti) less well characterized. sought to
compare effect continuous (c) versus intermittent (p) art cd4 responses
in patients undergoing il-2 therapy.
methods: cd4 cell responses compared 25 patients underwent il-2
therapy periods continuous art (n = 90 cycles) well sti (n
= 45 cycles). sti, patients resumed art 10 days surrounding 
il-2 cycle.
results: c cycles resulted significantly greater cd4 gain p cycles
(delta156 cells/microl, 95% ci = 68-243). multivariate analyses, baseline
cd4/cd25 expression treatment arm remained strong predictors cd4 gain
while cd8/cd38+, cd8/dr+, cd4 ki67+ phenotype predictive.
conclusions: continuous art associated statistically significantly
greater cd4 cell response il-2 therapy intermittent art. these
observations may important implications appropriate integration of
il-2 therapy sti strategies.
