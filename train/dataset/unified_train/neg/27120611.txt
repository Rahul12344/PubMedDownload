pseudovirion-based neutralization assay considered gold standard method
for evaluating immune response human papillomavirus (hpv) vaccines. in
this study, developed multicolor neutralization assay simultaneously
detect neutralizing antibodies different hpv types. fluorospot was
used interpret fluorescent protein expression instead flow cytometry.
the results fluorospot flow cytometry showed good consistency, rÂ² >
0.98 log-transformed ic50 values. regardless reporter color, the
single-, dual-, triple-color neutralization assays reported identical results
for samples. low-titer samples naturally hpv-infected
individuals, strong agreement single- triple-color
assays, kappa scores 0.92, 0.89, 0.96 hpv16, hpv18, hpv58,
respectively. good reproducibility observed triple-color assay, 
coefficients variation 2.0%-41.5% within assays 8.3%-36.2% 
the assays. three triple-color systems, hpv16-18-58, hpv6-33-45, hpv11-31-52,
were developed could evaluate immunogenicity nonavalent vaccine 
three rounds assay. advantages easy-to-use procedure and
less sample consumption, multiple-color assay suitable classical
assays large sero-epidemiological studies clinical trials more
amenable automation.
