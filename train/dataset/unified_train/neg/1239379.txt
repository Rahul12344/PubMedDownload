cellular rna influenza-virion rna synthesized different
pyrimidine-nucleoside-triphosphate pools chick-embryo cells.

d√§mmgen jw, scholtissek c.

chick embryo cells infected influenza (fowl plague) virus been
labelled (3h)-uridine different lengths time. virion rna cellular
rna separated specific hybridization surplus unlabelled
viral complementary rna rnase digestion. ratio specific
radioacticity ump cmp moieties types rna been
determined. since rate approach equilibrium cmp ump labelling 
both types rna completely different concluded cellular and
virion rna synthesized using different pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphate
pools.
