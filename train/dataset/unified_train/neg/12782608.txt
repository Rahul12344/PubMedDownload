overexpression c-met, protein tyrosine kinase receptor hepatocyte 
growth factor/scatter factor, implicated progression and
metastasis human colorectal carcinoma. examine role c-met in
vitro vivo growth human colon tumor cell lines, stable subclones the
high metastatic human colorectal carcinoma cell line, km20, isolated a
dukes' patient, reduced c-met expression obtained transfection 
with c-met-specific targeting ribozyme. subclones modestly
reduced c-met expression c-met playing important role in
cellular survival. however, 60-90% reduction basal c-met autophosphorylation
and kinase activity observed. correlating reduction c-met kinase
activity, subclones reduced c-met expression significantly reduced in
vitro growth rates soft-agar colony-forming abilities. vivo growth 
these cells examined ectopic sq site orthotopic site of
metastatic growth, liver. sq growth delayed significantly c-met
down-regulated clones compared controls, tumors growing loss 
ribozyme construct. contrast, tumor incidence significantly reduced when
the c-met down-regulated cells grown orthotopic liver site. thus,
c-met activation may important metastatic growth colon tumor cells in
the liver. collectively data demonstrate small reduction c-met
protein levels leads profound biological effects, potential c-met
inhibitors may therapeutic value treatment colon cancer.
