background objectives: kidney injury molecule-1 (kim-1) suggested as
a clinically relevant highly specific biomarker acute kidney tubular damage.
however, community-based data association urinary levels kim-1 
and risk cardiovascular mortality lacking. study aimed to
investigate association urinary kim-1 cardiovascular mortality.
design, setting, participants, & measurements: prospective study,
using community-based uppsala longitudinal study adult men (n=590; mean
age 77 years; baseline period, 1997-2001; median follow-up 8.1 years; end of
follow-up, 2008).
results: follow-up, 89 participants died cardiovascular causes
(incidence rate, 2.07 per 100 person-years risk). models adjusted for
cardiovascular risk factors (age, systolic bp, diabetes, smoking, body mass
index, total cholesterol, hdl cholesterol, antihypertensive treatment,
lipid-lowering treatment, aspirin treatment, history cardiovascular
disease) markers kidney dysfunction damage (cystatin c-based egfr 
and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio). higher urinary kim-1/creatinine (from
24-hour urine collections) associated higher risk cardiovascular
mortality (hazard ratio per sd increase, 1.27; 95% confidence interval [95% ci], 
1.05 1.54; p=0.01). participants combination high kim-1/creatinine
(upper quintile, ≥175 ng/mmol), low egfr (≤60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)), and
microalbuminuria/macroalbuminuria (albumin/creatinine ratio≥3 g/mol) a
>8-fold increased risk compared participants low kim-1/creatinine (<175
ng/mmol), normal egfr (>60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)), normoalbuminuria
(albumin/creatinine ratio<3 g/mol) (hazard ratio, 8.56; 95% ci, 4.17 17.56;
p<0.001).
conclusions: findings suggest higher urinary kim-1 may predispose a
higher risk cardiovascular mortality independently established
cardiovascular risk factors, egfr, albuminuria. additional studies needed
to assess utility measuring kim-1 clinical setting.
