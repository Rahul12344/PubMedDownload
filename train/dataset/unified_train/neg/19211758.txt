respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) leading cause respiratory failure and
viral death infants. abundant airway mucus contributes airway obstruction
in rsv disease. interleukin-13 (il-13) mediator pulmonary mucus
secretion. shown infection balb/c mice rsv line 19
strain rsv a2 laboratory strain results lung il-13 mucus 
expression. here, sequenced rsv line 19 genome compared the
commonly used a2 long strains. six amino acid differences 
the line 19 strain a2 long rsv strains, five the
fusion (f) protein. long strain, like a2 strain, induce lung
il-13 mucus expression balb/c mice. hypothesized f protein 
rsv line 19 mucogenic f proteins a2 long. generated
recombinant, f-chimeric rsvs replacing f gene a2 f gene of
either line 19 long. infection balb/c mice rsv ra2 line 19f resulted
in lower alpha interferon lung levels 24 h postinfection, higher lung viral load,
higher lung il-13 levels, greater airway mucin expression levels, greater
airway hyperresponsiveness infection ra2-a2f ra2-longf. we
identified f protein rsv line 19 factor plays role in
pulmonary mucin expression setting rsv infection.
