given global impact persistent infections human population, is
of utmost importance devise strategies noncytopathically purge tissues 
of infectious agents. central nervous system (cns) poses unique challenge
when considering strategies, immunologically specialized
compartment contains nonreplicative cell population. administration of
exogenously derived pathogen-specific memory cells (referred adoptive
immunotherapy) mice burdened persistent lymphocytic choriomeningitis
virus (lcmv) infection birth results eradication pathogen all
tissues, including cns. study, sought mechanistic insights into
this highly successful therapeutic approach. monitoring migration of
traceable lcmv-specific memory cd8+ cells immunotherapy, revealed 
that cytotoxic lymphocytes (ctls) distributed widely throughout cns
compartment early immunotherapy, resulted dramatic elevation 
the activity cns antigen-presenting cells (apcs). immunotherapy induced
microglia activation well recruitment macrophages dendritic
cells (dcs) brain parenchyma. however, dcs emerged cns apc
population capable inducing memory ctls preferentially produce the
antiviral cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha, cytokine demonstrated be
required successful immunotherapeutic clearance. dcs also found an
essential element immunotherapeutic process absence,
memory cells failed undergo secondary expansion, viral clearance not
attained cns. experiments underscore importance dcs the
immunotherapeutic clearance persistent viral infection suggest that
strategies elevate activation/migration dcs (especially within cns)
may facilitate pathogen clearance.
