a general mathematical model viral infections inside spherical organ is
presented. transported quantities used represent external cells viral
particles penetrate organ surface either promote combat the
infection. diffusion mechanism considered migration transported
quantities organ inner tissue. cases include effect of
penetration, diffusion proliferation immune system cells, generation
of latently infected cells delivery antiviral treatment analyzed. 
different antiviral mechanisms modeled context spatial variation.
equilibrium conditions also calculated determine radial profile 
the infection progresses antiviral therapy delivered long period 
time. dynamic equilibrium solutions obtained paper provide
insight temporal spatial evolution viral infections.
