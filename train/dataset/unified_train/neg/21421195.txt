endemic areas assess associated risk factors hcc development the
community. april 2004 november 2005, 4,127 residents tainan county, 
aged 40 years older, participated comprehensive health examination.
among them, residents hbv hcv infection; platelet count less or
equal 150×10(9)/l; hepatic tumor, liver ultrasonography, were
invited study. alpha-fetoprotein (afp) screening ultrasonography 
hcc surveillance performed. hepatic tumor detected, subjects
were referred medical centers confirmation treatment. total 
of 1,133 residents eligible study, 413 (36.5%), including 197
men 216 women, mean age 64.5 years, enrolled. 21
cases suspected hcc. 21 cases, 18 (85.7%) accepted studies
and 11 (52.4%) confirmed affected hcc. hccs unifocal
with diameter less equal 4 cm. kaplan-meier survival
analysis, 2-year cumulative incidence hcc 4.7%. based same
analysis log rank test, afp greater equal 20 ng/ml (p=0.007),
platelet count less equal 100×10(9)/l (p<0.001), liver cirrhosis
(p<0.001) found associated risk factors hcc development. in
summary, 2-year cumulative incidence hcc 4.7% among adult residents
with chronic hbv hcv infection dual hbv hcv endemic area. platelet
