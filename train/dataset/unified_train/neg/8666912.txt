accumulating evidence implicated proteasome processing protein 
along major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class presentation pathway.
the availability potent proteasome inhibitors provides opportunity to
examine role proteasome function antigen presentation mhc class i
molecules cd8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes (ctls). investigated the
processing presenting antigenic epitopes influenza hemagglutinin in
target cells treated inhibitor proteasome activity mg132. the
absence proteasome activity, processing presentation the
full-length hemagglutinin abolished, suggesting requirement for
proteasome function processing presentation hemagglutinin
glycoprotein. epitope-containing translation products short 21 amino acids 
when expressed target cells required proteasome activity processing and
presentation hemagglutin epitope ctls. however, endogenous
peptides 17 amino acids shorter expressed target cells, the
processing presentation epitopes contained peptides were
insensitive proteasome inhibitor. results support hypothesis 
proteasome activity required generation peptides presented mhc
class molecules requirement proteasome activity dependent
on size translation product expressed target cell. the
implications findings discussed.
