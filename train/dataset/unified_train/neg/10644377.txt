gene 50 immediate-early gene appears conserved among the
characterized gammaherpesviruses. recently demonstrated human
viruses epstein-barr virus (ebv) kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus
(kshv) ectopic expression gene 50-encoded product latently
infected cell lines lead induction virus replication, indicating
that gene 50 likely play pivotal role regulating gammaherpesvirus
reactivation. demonstrate murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (gammahv68)
gene 50 immediate-early gene transcription gammahv68 gene 50
leads production spliced unspliced forms gene 50
transcript. splicing transcript near 5' end serves extend gene 
50 open reading frame, observed gene 50 transcripts encoded
by kshv herpesvirus saimiri (whitehouse et al., j. virol. 71:2550-2554, 1997;
lukac et al., virology 252:304-312, 1998; sun et al., proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 
95:10866-10871, 1998). reverse transcription-pcr analyses, coupled s1
nuclease protection assays, provided evidence gene 50 transcripts initiate
at several sites within region bp 66468 66502 gammahv68
genome. functional characterization region upstream putative gene
50 transcription initiation site demonstrated orientation-dependent promoter
activity identified 110-bp region (bp 66442 66552) encoding putative
gene 50 promoter. finally, demonstrate gammahv68 gene 50 can
transactivate gammahv68 gene 57 promoter, known early gene target the
gene 50-encoded transactivator gammaherpesviruses. studies show
that gammahv68 gene 50 shares several important molecular similarities with
the gene 50 homologs gammaherpesviruses thus provides impetus for
future studies analyzing role gammahv68 gene 50-encoded protein in
acute virus replication reactivation latency vivo.
