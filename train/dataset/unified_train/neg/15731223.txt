the spike (s) protein severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(sars-cov) interacts cellular receptors mediate membrane fusion, allowing
viral entry host cells; hence recognized primary target of
neutralizing antibodies, therefore knowledge antigenic determinants that
can elicit neutralizing antibodies could beneficial development a
protective vaccine. here, expressed five different fragments s, covering
the entire ectodomain (amino acids 48 1192), glutathione s-transferase
fusion proteins escherichia coli used purified proteins raise
antibodies rabbits. western blot analysis immunoprecipitation
experiments, showed antibodies specific highly sensitive 
to native denatured forms full-length protein expressed 
virus-infected cells transfected cells, respectively. indirect
immunofluorescence performed fixed unpermeabilized cells showed these
antibodies recognize mature form cell surface. the
antibodies also able detect maturation 200-kda form to
the 210-kda form pulse-chase experiments. antibodies tested 
their ability inhibit sars-cov propagation vero e6 culture, found
that anti-sdelta10 antibody, targeted amino acid residues 1029
to 1192 s, include heptad repeat 2, strong neutralizing activities, 
suggesting region carries neutralizing epitopes very
important virus entry cells.
