exosomes extracellularly secreted vesicles ranging 40 100Â nm in
diameter thought play important roles intercellular communication.
exosomes contain numerous proteins, rna, lipids affect status of
recipient cells various pathological conditions. micrornas (mirnas) are
small non-coding rnas play major role post-transcriptional gene
silencing interacting 3'-untranslated regions target genes.
epstein-barr virus (ebv) reported induce sustained elevation of
cellular mirnas mir-155. hypothesized mirnas delivered by
exosomes might affect angiogenesis retinal pigment epithelial (rpe) cells.
here, demonstrated co-culture ebv-positive burkitt's lymphoma (bl)
cells (raji) retinal pigment epithelial (arpe-19) cells increased level 
of mir-155 recipient cells whereas major difference detected for
co-culture ebv-negative bl cells (ramos). isolated raji exosomes increased
transcriptional translational levels vegf-a arpe-19 cells, was
reversely correlated von hippel-lindau expression. human umbilical vein
endothelial cell tube formation assay showed delivery ectopic mir-155
rendered arpe-19 cells proangiogenic. results demonstrate sustained
accumulation mir-155 mediated exosomes might affect remote recipient cells 
such retinal pigment epithelial cells.
