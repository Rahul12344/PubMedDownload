objective: investigated efficacy interferon regimen characterized by
an early virological response patients chronic hepatitis c evaluated 
whether patient's virological status therapy would useful for
predicting complete response.
methods: treated 62 patients chronic hepatitis c 6 million units
(mu) human lymphoblastoid interferon daily 4 wk. serum hcv rna was
assayed week 2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. hcv
rna-negative patients (group a) received 6 mu interferon three times weekly
for additional 22 wk (total dose, 564 mu). hcv rna-positive patients were
randomly assigned group b-1, received regimen group a, to
group b-2, received 6 mu interferon daily 4 wk followed 6 mu
three times weekly 18 wk (total dose, 660 mu).
results: complete responses achieved 19 (63.3%) 30 group patients,
compared one (6.3%) 16 group b-1 patients none 16 group b-2
patients. virological response week 2 pretreatment serum hcv rna
level independent significant predictors complete response.
conclusion: patients still hcv rna-positive week 2 unlikely to
achieve complete response interferon therapy. increase total
dose interferon failed yield benefit patients.
