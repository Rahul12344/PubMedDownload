between 40% 80% patients treated monoclonal antibody okt3 develop
blocking antibody idiotypic region. thus major concern use
of okt3 part baseline immunosuppressive regimen formation of
blocking antibodies might preclude subsequent use. 7/86 2/87, 32 
patients received prophylactic okt3 addition low-dose prednisone,
azathioprine, cyclosporine. prophylactic okt3 prevent rejection, as
21 32 patients studied developed rejection. retreatment 13 patients with
okt3 successfully reversed 12 rejections lowered number t3-positive
cells spite low level blocking antibody two patients group.
of patients analyzed, 38% developed blocking antibody initial exposure 
okt3, okt3 reuse denied 4 patients due presence these
antibodies. three rejections reversed steroids alone; other
patient lost allograft. high frequency infectious complications occurred
in retreatment group, viral infections predominating. one patient
in retreated group developed antibodies second use. appearance of
blocking antibodies use okt3 part base-line prophylactic
immunosuppressive regimen significantly compromise access okt3 for
treatment subsequent rejection episodes, multiple exposures okt3 did
increase frequency infectious complications.
