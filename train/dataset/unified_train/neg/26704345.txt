background: intestinal helminths cause severe diseases general,
however, combined diseases immunodeficiency diseases,
there would massive complications. infections hepatitis b virus (hbv) may
lead immunological disturbances defects cellular immunity 
a need clarification whether hbv infections associated infections
with intestinal helminths.
methods: community-based cross sectional study conducted tezi town, puge
county liangshan prefecture, southwestern china october 23rd to
november 3rd, 2014. four hundred thirty eight people (median age = 37 years, 
iqr = 22-49) enrolled study. modified kato-katz thick smear used
to detect intestinal helminths. hbv dna quantified confirm hbv infection.
results: among 438 participants, 9.1%, 13.5% 30.6% infected with
hbv, a. lumbricoides (l., 1758) t. trichiura (l., 1771), respectively; 7.1%
(30/438) infected a. lumbricoides t. trichiura 2.3%
(10/438) co-infected hbv a. lumbricoides. multivariate logistic
regression analysis showed age (21-30 years versus >50 years: or = 6.66, 95%
ci = 2.15-20.68), drug abuse (or = 6.96, 95% ci = 1.11-43.90), a. lumbricoides
infection (or = 3.60, 95% ci = 1.48-8.75), fertilization faeces after
disposal (or = 0.15, 95% ci = 0.04-0.47) working farm (or = 4.59, 95%
ci = 1.44-14.63) significantly associated hbv infection. toilets
at home negatively related a. lumbricoides infection (or = 0.52, 95%
ci = 0.27-0.98) t. trichiura infection (or = 0.48, 95% ci = 0.28-0.80).
conclusions: ascaris lumbricoides independently associated hbv
infection, faeces might medium hbv transmission. improving hygiene 
conditions habits essential reduce risks a. lumbricoides t.
trichiura infections.
