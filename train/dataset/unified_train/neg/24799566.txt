polyomaviruses encode large ag (lt), multifunctional protein essential 
the regulation viral host cell gene expression productive viral
infection. previously, shown stable expression lt protein results
in upregulation genes involved ifn induction signaling pathway. 
this study, focus cellular signaling mechanism leads the
induction ifn responses lt. results show ectopic expression of
sv40 lt results induction ifn-stimulated genes (isgs) human
fibroblasts confers antiviral state. describe lt-initiated dna damage
response (ddr) activates ifn regulatory factor 1, causing ifn-β production
and consequent isg expression human cells. ifn-β isg induction is
dependent ataxia-telangiectasia mutated rad3-related (atr) kinase, but
independent atm. atr kinase inhibition using selective kinase inhibitor
(etp-46464) caused decrease ifn regulatory factor 1 stabilization isg
expression. furthermore, expression mutant lt induce ddr also 
does induce ifn-β isgs. results show that, absence viral 
infection, lt-initiated activation atr-dependent ddr sufficient the
induction ifn-β-mediated innate immune response human cells. thus, we
have uncovered novel critical role atr mediator antiviral
responses utilizing lt.
