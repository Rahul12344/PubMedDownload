the antiviral drug used treatment acquired immunodeficiency syndrome,
zidovudine, proved effective ameliorating morbidity mortality
associated human immunodeficiency virus infection. however, associated 
zidovudine development severe bone marrow toxicity manifested by
anemia, neutropenia, occasionally thrombocytopenia. report results 
studies demonstrate ability basic fibroblast growth factor (b-fgf) to
reduce zidovudine toxicity several classes hematopoietic progenitors
(granulocyte-macrophage, cfu-gm; megakaryocyte. cfu-meg; erythroid, bfu-e)
from normal murine, human, murine retrovirus-infected bone marrow cells 
cocultured zidovudine vitro. optimal response b-fgf observed 
dose concentration 10 ng/ml. specificity b-fgf demonstrated 
presence protamine sulfate, effective inhibitor b-fgf mitogenic
activity. addition, synergistic activity b-fgf zidovudine-induced
hematopoietic stem cell toxicity observed presence interleukin 1
(il-1) (30 ng/ml). studies demonstrate b-fgf capable reducing
the hematopoietic toxicity associated zidovudine effect can
be amplified presence il-1.
