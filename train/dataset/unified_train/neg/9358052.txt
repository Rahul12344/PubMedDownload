the genome bacillus subtilis bacteriophage b103 consists double-stranded
linear dna 18,630 bp long. dna sequenced, sequence compared
with dna sequences closely related phages, namely members phage
phi29 family. among them, phage nf shown closely related to
b103. comparisons several open reading frames (orfs) among family members 
helped identify genes 1 5. cluster orfs genes 16 17
contains two orfs partial homology two phi29 orfs located same
region. three orfs region b103 good ribosome
binding sites (rbs) optimal codon usage homologous the
phi29 orfs. function five orfs remains unexplained. shown
that major promoters characterized phi29 retained b103. many
substitutions occur vicinity promoter, least -10 -35 boxes
are conserved.
