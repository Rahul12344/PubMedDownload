bacillus sphaericus neide, recently renamed lysinibacillus sphaericus meyer
and neide, spore-forming bacterium possesses various levels of
larvicidal activity, depending strains, mosquito species.
products based active strains 2362, 2297, 1593, c3-41 bear
binary toxins, well mosquitocidal toxins various levels, been
developed combat mosquito larvae worldwide. resistance wild culex mosquito 
populations reported since 1994 france, brazil, india, china,
thailand, tunisia. laboratory studies evaluate resistance development risk
have conducted many groups scientists worldwide. products based l. 
sphaericus strain 2362 registered united states 1990s, their
use mosquito control increased considerably since invasion west
nile virus. report documents first occurrence high-level resistance
to l. sphaericus natural population culex pipiens l. chico, ca, 
resistance ratio 537.0 lc50 9,048.5 lc90 compared with
susceptible laboratory colony species. susceptibility profile to
other groups pesticides different modes action also determined.
various levels resistance tolerance noticed abamectin,
pyriproxyfen, permethrin, indoxacarb. resistance management and
susceptibility monitoring strategies discussed recommended.
