samples collected wild domestic suids nigeria, 3-year period
(2003-2006), evaluated african swine fever (asf) virus genome presence
by targeting three discrete genome regions, namely 478-bp c-terminal p72 gene
region advocated genotype assignment, 780-bp region spanning 5'-ends of
the pb125r pb646l (p72) genes hypervariable central variable region
(cvr) encoded within 9rl orf (pb602l). asf virus (asfv) presence was
confirmed 23 26 wild domestic pigs evaluated. evidence asf
infection found two warthogs adamawa state; however, one bushpig from
plateau state positive. nucleotide sequences 478-bp 780-bp
amplicons identical across asfv-positive samples sequenced. however,
five discrete cvr variants recovered, bringing total number identified
to date, nigeria, six. largest cvr variants, termed 'tet-36'
was identical virus causing outbreaks neighbouring benin 1997,
indicating prolonged persistence virus type nigeria. co-circulation 
of three tetramer types (tet-36, tet-27 tet-20) found plateau state in
july 2004, whilst benue state, two tetramer types (tet-20 tet-21) were
present august 2005. despite simultaneous field presence, individual
co-infection observed. study reaffirmed epidemiological
utility cvr genome region distinguishing geographically and
temporally constrained genotype viruses, revealed presence of
multiple asfv variants nigeria.
