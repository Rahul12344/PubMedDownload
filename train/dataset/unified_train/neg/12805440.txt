the development cancer vaccines requires approaches induce expansion and
functional differentiation tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic lymphocyte (ctl)
effectors posses cytolytic capability produce cytokines. efficient
induction cells hindered poor immunogenicity tumor antigens 
and poor transduction efficiency dendritic cells (dcs) current
nonreplicating vectors. investigated use influenza virus, a
potent viral inducer ctls, vector expressing immunodominant her-2 ctl
epitope kif (e75). purpose, attenuated influenza a/pr8/34 virus 
a truncated nonstructural (ns1) gene generated containing e75 epitope 
its neuraminidase protein (kif-ns virus). stimulation peripheral blood
mononuclear cells healthy donors tumor-associated lymphocytes from
ovarian breast cancer patients dcs infected kif-ns virus (kif-ns
dc) induced ctls specifically recognized peptide kif and
her-2-expressing tumors cytotoxicity assays secreted gamma interferon
(ifn-gamma) interleukin-2 recall peptide. priming kif-ns dcs
increased number e75(+) cd45ro(+) cells 10-fold compared to
nonstimulated cells. addition, kif-ns virus induced high levels ifn-alpha
in dcs. first report demonstrating induction human
epitope-specific ctls tumor-associated antigen live attenuated
recombinant influenza virus vector. vectors may provide novel approach for
tumor antigen delivery, lymphocyte activation, differentiation human
cancer vaccine development.
