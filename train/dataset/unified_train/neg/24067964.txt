the p9-1 protein rice black-streaked dwarf virus (rbsdv) essential part 
of viroplasm. however, little known nature biological
function viroplasm. study, structure function p9-1 were
analyzed vitro binding nucleic acids. found p9-1 protein
preferentially bound single-stranded versus double-stranded nucleic acids;
however, protein displayed preference rbsdv versus non-rbsdv
single-stranded ssrna (ssrna). gel mobility shift assay revealed rna
gradually shifted increasing amounts p9-1 added, suggesting that
multiple subunits p9-1 bind ssrna. using discontinuous blue native gel
and chromatography analysis, found p9-1 protein capable of
forming dimers, tetramers, octamers. strikingly, demonstrated p9-1
preferentially bound ssrna octamer, rather dimer, form.
deletion c-terminal arm resulted p9-1 longer forming octamers;
consequently, deletion mutant protein bound ssrna significantly lower
affinity fewer copies bound per ssrna. alanine substitution analysis
revealed electropositive amino acids among residues 25 44 important
for rna binding map central interior structure formed by
p9-1 octamers. collectively, findings provide novel insights the
structure function rbsdv viroplasm protein p9-1 binding rna.
