to investigate mechanism functional significance infection cd8+
lymphocytes human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) vivo, determined
frequencies infection, proviral conformation, genetic relationships
between hiv-1 variants infecting naive (cd45ra+) memory (cd45ro+) peripheral 
blood cd4+ cd8+ lymphocytes. infection cd3+ cd8+ cd45ra+ cells was
detected 9 16 study subjects frequencies ranging 30 1,400
proviral copies/10(6) cells, frequently cd3+ cd8+ lymphocytes
expressing ro isoform cd45 (n = 2, 70 260 copies /10(6) cells). in
agreement previous studies, evidence similar preferential
infection cd4+ naive lymphocytes. proviral sequences cd4+ cd8+
lymphocyte subsets complete, assessed quantitation using primers 
the long terminal repeat region spanning trna primer binding site. six 
the seven study subjects investigated, variants infecting cd8+ lymphocytes were
partially completely genetically distinct v3 region those
recovered cd4+ lymphocytes showed greater degree of
compartmentalization observed naive memory subsets cd4+
lymphocytes. two study subjects, arginine substitutions position 306,
associated use chemokine coreceptor cxcr4, preferentially found 
in cd4 lymphocytes. population differences may originated through
different times infection rather necessarily indicating difference in
their biological properties. preferential distribution hiv-1 naive cd8+
lymphocytes indeed suggests infection occurred early t-lymphocyte
ontogeny, maturation thymus. destruction cells destined 
to become cd8+ lymphocytes may major factor decline cd8+
lymphocyte frequencies function disease progression may contribute
directly observed immunodeficiency aids.
