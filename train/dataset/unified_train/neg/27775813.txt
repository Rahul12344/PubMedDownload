objectives: determine whether immune phenotypes associated with
immunosenescence predictive frailty mortality within 1-year elderly
nursing home residents.
design: cross sectional study frailty; prospective cohort study mortality.
setting: thirty-two nursing homes four canadian cities september 2009 
and october 2011.
participants: nursing home residents aged 65 older (n = 1,072, median age 86,
72% female).
measurements: enrollment, peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained 
and analyzed using flow cytometry cd4+ cd8+ t-cell subsets (naïve, memory
(central, effector, terminally differentiated, senescent), regulatory
t-cells) cytomegalovirus (cmv)-reactive cd4+ cd8+ t-cells. multilevel
linear regression analysis performed determine relationship between
immune phenotypes frailty; frailty measured time enrollment
using frailty index. cox proportional hazards model used determine
the relationship immune phenotypes time death (within 1 year).
results: mean frailty index 0.44 ± 0.13. multilevel regression analysis
showed higher percentages naïve cd4+ t-cells (p = .001) effector
memory cd8+ t-cells (p = .02) associated lower mean frailty index,
whereas higher percentage cd8+ central memory t-cells associated 
higher mean frailty index score (p = .02). one hundred fifty one (14%) members of
the cohort died within 1 year. multivariable analysis showed significant
negative multiplicative interaction age percentage cmv-reactive
cd4+ t-cells (hazard ratio = 0.87, 95% confidence interval = 0.79-0.96). other
significant factors identified.
conclusion: immune phenotypes found predictive frailty mortality 
this study help understanding immunosenescence may provide a
rationale future intervention studies designed modulate immunity.
