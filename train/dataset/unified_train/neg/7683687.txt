a series monoclonal antibodies p51/p66 human immunodeficiency virus-1 
(hiv-1) reverse transcriptase (rt) prepared immunizing mice the
native enzyme immobilized nitrocellulose. one antibodies, designated 
1e8, found inhibit rna-dependent dna-dependent polymerase
activities rt effect rnase h activity enzyme. this
inhibition noncompetitive respect primer/template competitive
with respect deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dntp). extent 1e8 inhibition
of rt polymerase activity decreased increasing concentrations dntp the
incubation affected changes primer/template concentration. 1e8 
bound equally well solution free rt rt-primer/template
complex. however, binding latter significantly reduced addition
of increasing concentrations dntp. ability dntp inhibit the
interaction 1e8 rt-primer/template complex dependent the
identity homopolymeric primer/template used; dntp complementary 
to template effective respect. 1e8 bound p51/p66 reverse
transcriptase heterodimer solution reacted p51 p66 subunits 
of reverse transcriptase western blots. antibody therefore presumed 
recognize linear surface epitope enzyme. 1e8 found specifically
recognize peptide sequence kkdstkwrk. sequence corresponds to
residues 65-73 hiv-1 reverse transcriptase, region identified highly
antigenic several computer algorithms. two mutations within sequence have
been identified resistance 3'-azido,3'-deoxythymidine. conclude that
residues 65-73 hiv-1 reverse transcriptase may near polymerase
active site enzyme, may form part deoxynucleoside triphosphate 
binding domain enzyme.
