adeno-associated virus nonpathogenic human virus developed
into gene-delivery vector due high efficiency infection many
different cell types ability persist lead long-term gene
expression. unit describes efficient methods generate high-titer,
research-grade, adenovirus-free recombinant single-stranded and
self-complementary adeno-associated virus various serotypes, along with
methods quantify viral vectors. two detailed methods provided for
viral vector delivery rodent brain spinal cord, histological
detection transgene expression gfp.
