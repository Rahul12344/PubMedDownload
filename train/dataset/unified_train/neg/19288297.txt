in recent years, human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected patients under
highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart) regimens shown markedly
improved general clinical status; however, prevalence mild cognitive
disorders increased. propose increased longevity hiv-mediated
chronic inflammation combined secondary effects haart may increase
the risk early brain aging shown intraneuronal accumulation abnormal 
protein aggregates like amyloid beta (abeta), might participate in
