a novel class cationic block copolymers constituted neutral hydrophilic
poly(ethylene glycol) (peg) block positively charged
poly(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate block prepared delivery dna.
these block copolymers spontaneously assemble dna give aqueous medium 
micellar-like structures. five novel block copolymers (k1-5), differing 
in length peg chain linear charge density the
poly(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate block, prepared analyzed gene 
delivery, gene expression safety. five block copolymers protected dna
from dnase digestion delivered dna cell. however, three
of (k1, k2 k5) released dna level allowing efficient gene
expression cells. toxic effects copolymers alone dna
complexes observed vitro mice. addition, copolymers were
scarcely immunogenic. results indicate novel class cationic
block copolymers safe possesses biological characteristics required
for dna delivery, thus, representing promising vehicles dna vaccination.
