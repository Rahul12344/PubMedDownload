pneumonia, accomplished serological tests bacteria viruses, were
included study. five etiological groups analysed: children with
bacterial etiology only, viral etiology only, mixed bacterial viral
etiology, mycoplasma only, children etiology.
results: chest films etiological group analysed findings
were correlated children's age. radiological findings differ
between etiological groups. radiological findings correlated significantly
