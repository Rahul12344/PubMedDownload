ribosomal rna homologies among distantly related organisms.

bendich aj, mccarthy bj.

the similarity base sequences ribosomal rna (rrna) widely divergent
organisms compared. hybrids prepared escherichia coli pea
rrna one hand dna several organisms other. varying
thermal stabilities hybrids taken evidence hierarchy of
rrna relatedness among higher plants, phylogenetic relationships
among species bacteria, protozoa, fungi, plants, animals. large
rrna molecule appears evolved faster small rrna molecule.
