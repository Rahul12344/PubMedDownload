antibody human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-1 principal neutralizing
determinant (v3 loop) measured peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(elisa) cerebrospinal fluid (csf) paired serum samples 21
hiv-seropositive patients. patients normal neurologic examinations 
were without neurologic symptoms. peptide elisa demonstrated intrathecal antibody
synthesis v3 loop hivmn, v3 loop hivny5, v3 loop of
hivlai, entire recombinant hiv-1mn gp120 21 21, 10 21, one of
21, 12 21 patients, respectively. biospecific interaction analysis
(biacore), requires small amounts csf, also used detect
anti-v3 csf antibody. fine mapping linear epitopes within v3 region was
successful three five patients geysen pin (pepscan) elisa and
discordance epitope specificity csf serum antibody found.
while detection csf antibody v3 loop hivmn peptide elisa has
been recently reported, add finding using peptide elisa, pepscan
and biacore methodologies well measuring intrathecal antibody synthesis
against v3 loops hiv strains. application techniques future
studies anti-v3 antibody csf persons receiving anti-hiv-1
immunizations may provide insight immunoregulation virus the
nervous system.
