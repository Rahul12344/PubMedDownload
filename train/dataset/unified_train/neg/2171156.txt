the article reviews present knowledge molecular mechanisms involved 
herpes virus latency. work herpes virus latency created foundation
for much knowledge viral latency general. herpes simplex virus is
perhaps best known respect. virus resides latently sensory
ganglia. herpes simplex-specific proteins found, specific rna 
transcript identified. varicella-zoster virus latency several
latency-associated transcripts known and, herpes simplex virus,
sensory ganglia harbour latent infection. still dispute to
whether epstein-barr virus truly latent not. however, evidence specific
proteins associated latency accumulating. little known about
cytomegalovirus latency.
