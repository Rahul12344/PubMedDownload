study objective: investigate predictive value assays human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) p24 antigen, p24 antibody, gp120 antibody
compared t4 cell counts.
design: prospective cohort selected persons hiv-antibody
seroconversion.
patients: eighty-seven persons hemophilia actuarial cumulative
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids) incidence 26% (ci, 12% 40%), 8
years hiv-antibody seroconversion.
intervention: none.
measurements main results: human immunodeficiency virus p24 antigen was
detected 8 74 (11%) patients without aids 7 13 (54%) the
patients aids. 2-year actuarial incidence aids 24% (ci, 0% to
48%) detection p24 antigen, 16% (ci, 0% 34%) loss p24
antibody, 20% (ci, 0% 45%) loss gp120 antibody, 31% (ci, 15% 47%) 
after t4 count less 200 cells/microl, 67% (ci, 31% 100%) a
t4 count less 200 cells/microl among patients positive p24
antigen. low numbers t4 t8 lymphocytes, presence p24 antigen in
serum, absence p24 antibody predictive value. however, only
p24 antigen (relative hazard 6.0, p = 0.008) t4 counts (relative hazard 5.3, 
p = 0.002 t4 count less 200 cells/microl) independently predicted aids 
up 12 months diagnosis.
conclusions: strong predictors aids p24 antigenemia low t4 counts.
detection p24 antigen highly specific complementary greater
sensitivity low t4 counts. findings important implications
regarding prognosis, counseling, planning clinical trials.
