the membrane lipids fast-elongating wild-type cotton (gossypium hirsutum)
fibers 10 days post-anthesis, wild-type ovules fiber cells removed, and
ovules fuzzless-lintless mutant harvested age, were
extracted, separated, quantified. fiber cells contained significantly higher 
amounts phosphatidylinositol (pi) ovule samples pi 34:3 being
the predominant species. genes encoding fatty acid desaturases
(δ(15)ghfad), pi synthase (pis) pi kinase (pik) expressed a
fiber-preferential manner. analysis phosphatidylinositol monophosphate
(pip) indicated elongating fibers contained four- five-fold higher
amounts pip 34:3 ovules. exogenously applied linolenic acid (c18:3), 
soybean l-α-pi, pips containing pip 34:3 promoted significant fiber growth,
whereas liver pi lacking c18:3 moiety, linoleic acid, pip 36:2 were
completely ineffective. growth inhibitory effects carbenoxolone,
5-hydroxytryptamine, wortmannin reverted c18:3, pi, pip,
respectively, suggesting pip signaling essential fiber cell growth.
furthermore, cotton plants expressing virus-induced gene-silencing constructs
that specifically suppressed ghδ(15)fad, ghpis, ghpik expression, resulted 
significantly short-fibered phenotypes. data provide basis in-depth
studies roles pi pip mediating cotton fiber growth.
