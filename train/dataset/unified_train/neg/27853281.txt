culex pipiens mosquito vectors west nile virus other
human-pathogenic flavivruses north america. response shortened day
length lower temperatures, female cx. pipiense prepares diapause by
actively feeding carbohydrates increase biosynthesis glycogen and
lipid store energy overwintering. effect feeding different
carbohydrates glycogen lipid biosynthesis diapausing mosquitoes was
investigated vivo using 13c solid-state nmr. diapause-destined adult females
and nondiapausing counterparts adult eclosion fed three different
carbohydrate sources 7 days: 1) 10% sucrose, 2) 10% d-[13c6]glucose, 3)
1% d-[13c6]glucose co-provisioned 10% sucrose. nmr measurements show that
sucrose glucose metabolized differently diapausing mosquitoes.
mosquitoes fed sucrose primarily accumulate glycogen increased branching 
structures, less lipids. contrast, mosquitoes fed exclusively on
glucose show accumulation glycogen lipid increased aliphatic
chain length. glucose exclusively metabolized biosynthesis of
triacylglyceride mosquitoes co-fed sucrose. findings provide
novel insights insect carbohydrate metabolism governs glycogen 
lipid biosynthesis diapause, fundamental insect survival 
during inimical environments.
