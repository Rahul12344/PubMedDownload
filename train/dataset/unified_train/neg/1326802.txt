the ul13 open reading frame herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) been
expressed insect cells recombinant baculovirus escherichia coli.
in latter case, ul13 gene fused gene glutathione
s-transferase (gst) allow high-level expression 80-kda gst-ul13 fusion
protein. antibody raised fusion protein reacted specifically the
55-kda ul13 gene product expressed recombinant baculovirus. antibody 
also recognized late phosphoprotein hsv-1-infected cell lysates a
component purified hsv-1 virions, electrophoretic mobility 
as baculovirus-expressed protein. virion component efficiently
phosphorylated vitro virion-associated protein kinase. using same
antibody, probable homolog ul13 gene product identified in
hsv-2-infected cells purified virions.
