rotavirus infection major cause severe dehydrating diarrhea infants
younger 5Â y old particular cases immunocompromised patients
irrespective age patients. although vaccines developed,
antiviral therapy important complement cannot substituted. 
of lack specific approved treatment, urgent facilitate the
cascade understanding infection biology, identification of
druggable targets final development effective antiviral therapies.
pi3k-akt-mtor signaling pathway plays vital role regulating infection
course many viruses. study, dissected effects of
pi3k-akt-mtor signaling pathway rotavirus infection using conventional
cell culture models 3d model human primary intestinal organoids. we
found pi3k-akt-mtor signaling essential sustaining rotavirus
infection. thus, blocking key elements pathway, including pi3k, mtor 
and 4e-bp1, resulted potent anti-rotavirus activity. importantly, a
clinically used mtor inhibitor, rapamycin, potently inhibited experimental
and patient-derived rotavirus strains. effect involves 4e-bp1 mediated
induction autophagy, turn exerts anti-rotavirus effects. these
results revealed new insights rotavirus-host interactions provided new
avenues antiviral drug development.
