we demonstrate s4 genome segment baboon reovirus (brv) contains two
sequential partially overlapping open reading frames (orfs), are
functional vitro virus-infected cells. 15-kda gene product (p15) of
the 5"-proximal orf induces efficient cell-cell fusion expressed itself
in transfected cells, suggesting p15 viral protein required 
induction syncytium formation brv. p15 protein small, hydrophobic,
basic, integral membrane protein, properties shared p10
fusion-associated small transmembrane (fast) proteins encoded avian reovirus
and nelson bay reovirus. p10, brv p15 protein also nonstructural
protein and, therefore, involved virus entry. sequence analysis
indicates p15 shares significant sequence similarity p10 fast
proteins contains unique repertoire arrangement sequence-predicted
structural functional motifs. motifs include functional n-terminal
myristylation consensus sequence, n-proximal proline-rich motif, two potential
transmembrane domains, intervening polybasic region. unique structural
properties p15 suggest protein novel member new family
of fast proteins.
