hepatitis virus: virologic, clinical, epidemiologic studies.

dienstag jl.

the last decade borne witness accelerated expansion understanding
of hepatitis virus. agent type hepatitis rna virus mean
diameter 27 nm. biochemical-biophysical properties enterovirus. a
variety sensitive specific serologic techniques developed which
to identify hepatitis virus antibody, chimpanzees marmosets
have studied extensively experimental animal models. result these
studies, vitro cultivation hepatitis virus finally accomplished,
and commercial radioimmunoassay igm antibody hepatitis virus 
developed rapid diagnosis hepatitis virus infection acute
illness. clinically illness caused hepatitis virus relatively mild,
often subclinical, limited duration progress chronic liver
disease. relative clinical benignity reflected, according preliminary 
histologic observations, sparing centrozonal area liver
lobule. rarely, however, hepatitis virus cause fulminant hepatitis. type 
hepatitis transmitted almost exclusively fecal-oral route, its
spread enhanced epidemiologic settings favoring dissemination enteric
infections. hepatitis virus contribute transfusion associated or
other types percutaneously transmitted hepatitis. exposure virus
increases function age decreasing socioeconomic class, the
incidence hepatitis virus infection urbanized societies decreasing.
there evidence existence chronic hepatitis virus carriage;
natural perpetuation hepatitis virus urban communities appears depend 
on reservoir nonepidemic, clinically inapparent cases. vaccine, 
being developed, becomes available, prevention hepatitis virus infection
will continue depend maintenance high standards environmental and
personal hygiene timely administration immune serum globulin. such
prophylaxis may confer long lasting passive-active immunity frequently
prevents infection entirely.
