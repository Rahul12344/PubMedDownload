phase clones affinity polystyrene/polyurethane magnetic particles were
isolated 10-men peptide display library. sequence analysis revealed that
40 80 clones contained consensus wxxwxxxw. selected phages
showed high surface activity adsorbed plastic surfaces even the
presence blocking agents surfactants. covalent attachment synthetic
peptide (kg), carrying one selected sequences alkaline phosphatase (ap)
or bovine serum albumin (bsa) enhanced binding ap wide range materials
and improved ability bsa prevent binding antibodies phages to
polystyrene. interestingly, wxxw/xxxw motif occurs beta- and
gamma-chains natural "adhesive" protein fibrinogen, synthetic
peptide carrying gamma-chain 369-376 sequence turned essentially 
the binding properties kg peptide. furthermore, adsorption in
different types polystyrene similar ap carrying either kg or
gamma-chain peptide intact fibrinogen plasmin-generated fragment d1. the
latter fragment contains two copies wxxwxxxw motif lacks the
alpha-chain: protuberances previously implicated fibrinogen adsorption. thus, 
our study may revealed hitherto unknown structural determinant for
fibrinogen's adsorptivity, located 13-kda c terminal region the
gamma-chain.
