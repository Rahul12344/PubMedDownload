purpose: treatment patients chronic hepatitis c alpha-interferon and
ribavirin usually produces adverse events within first 3 months. aimed 
assess safety predictors discontinuation dose modification these
drugs.
methods: observational study 312 patients predominantly genotype 1
chronic hepatitis c treated openly along 5 years clinical practice setting.
results: eighty-four percent patients experienced least one adverse event
(853 events total, 3.3 per patient average). incidence rate higher
during first 90 days decreased thereafter (<5%). discontinuation rates at
30 90 days end treatment 2, 4 8%, respectively. seventy
percent discontinuation cases due adverse events rather to
laboratory abnormalities. serious adverse events rare (<1%). dose
modifications made 158 patients (51%) 237 occasions. adjusting
for covariates, older age predictor early discontinuation, whereas hcv
genotypes 1-4 daily ribavirin dose 1000 mg predictors dose
modification.
conclusions: majority real-world patients chronic hepatitis c
tolerate acceptably dual therapy discontinue it. subjective
decisions dose reduction either compound appears major impact 
adherence patients. need better define, collect analyse
clinical features may predict adverse events safety-related decisions
during therapy chronic hepatitis c.
