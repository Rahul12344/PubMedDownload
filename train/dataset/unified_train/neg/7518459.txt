n-chimaerin recently described phorbol ester receptor shares homology
in n-terminal region cysteine-rich zinc finger domain protein
kinase c. expressed n-chimaerin insect cells using baculovirus
system used isolated, recombinant n-chimaerin characterize
phorbol ester binding structure-activity relations, lipid requirements, and
inhibitor sensitivity. find n-chimaerin expressed baculovirus
system bound [3h]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate high affinity (0.17 +/- 0.01 nm). 
although single cysteine-rich zinc finger region compared two
for protein kinase c, n-chimaerin thus closely resembled protein kinase c alpha. 
n-chimaerin likewise virtually indistinguishable protein kinase c alpha 
in phorbol ester structure-activity relations, phospholipid requirements, 
in inhibition binding sphingosine calphostin c, protein kinase c
inhibitors acting regulatory domain. conclude number typical 
approaches used implicate protein kinase c biological function cells 
not discriminate n-chimaerin protein kinase c classes phorbol 
ester receptors.
