human lymphotropic virus type (htlv-1) etiological agent of
htlv-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (ham/tsp). cd8+ cells
may contribute protection development ham/tsp. study used
sage methodology screen differentially expressed genes cd8+ cells
isolated htlv-1 asymptomatic carriers (hac) ham/tsp patients to
identify genes involved ham/tsp development. sage analysis conducted by
pooling samples according clinical status. comparison gene expression
profiles hac ham/tsp libraries identified 285 differentially
expressed tags. focus cytotoxicity cytokine-related genes due 
potential biological role htlv-1 infection. results showed patients
with ham/tsp high expression levels degranulation-related genes, namely
gzmh prf1, cytoskeletal adaptor pxn. found gzmb zap70 
were overexpressed htlv-infected patients compared noninfected group.
we also detected ccl5 higher ham/tsp group compared hac
and ct groups. findings showed cd8+ cells ham/tsp patients 
inflammatory active profile. pxn zap70 overexpression htlv-1-infected 
patients described first time reinforces concept.
however, although active abundant, cd8+ cells able completely
eliminate infected cells prevent development ham/tsp and, moreover,
these cells might contribute pathogenesis disease migrating to
the central nervous system (cns). results tested with
biological functional assays increase understanding role these
molecules development htlv-1-related diseases.
