aids one multifaceted diseases underlying complexity hampers
its complete cure. toxicity existing drugs emergence of
multidrug-resistant virus makes treatment worse. development effective,
safe low-cost anti-hiv drugs among top global priority. exploration of
natural resources may give ray hope develop new anti-hiv leads. among the
various therapeutic targets hiv treatment, reverse transcriptase, protease,
integrase, gp120, ribonuclease prime focus. present study, 
predicted potential plant-derived natural molecules hiv treatment using
computational approach, i.e. molecular docking, quantitative structure activity
relationship (qsar), admet studies. receptor-ligand binding studies were
performed using three different software precise prediction - discovery
studio 4.0, schrodinger molegrow virtual docker. docking scores revealed that
mulberrosides, anolignans, curcumin chebulic acid promising candidates
that bind multi targets hiv, neo-andrographolide, nimbolide and
punigluconin target-specific candidates. subsequently, qsar performed
using biologically proved compounds predicted biological activity of
compounds. identified anolignans, curcumin, mulberrosides, chebulic acid and
neo-andrographolide potential natural molecules hiv treatment results
of molecular docking 3d-qsar. silico admet studies showed drug-likeness of
these lead molecules. structure similarities identified lead molecules were
compared identified marketed drugs superimposing molecules.
using silico studies, identified best fit molecules natural
origin identified targets may give new drugs combat hiv
infection wet lab validation.
