since discovery 1976, ebolavirus caused periodic outbreaks viral
hemorrhagic fever associated severe often fatal disease. ebolavirus is
endemic central africa philippines. although currently no
approved treatment available, past 10 years seen remarkable progress in
our understanding pathogenicity ebolavirus development of
prophylactic post-exposure therapies it. vitro vivo
experiments shown ebolavirus pathogenicity multifactorial, including
viral host determinants. besides function virus replication
cycle, viral glycoprotein, nucleoprotein, minor matrix protein polymerase
cofactor viral determinants pathogenicity, evasion host innate
and adaptive immune responses main mechanism. although licensed
ebolavirus vaccines currently available, vaccine research non-human
primates, 'gold standard' animal model ebolavirus, produced several
promising candidates. combination dna vaccination recombinant
adenovirus serotype 5 boost resulted cross-protective immunity non-human
primates. recombinant vesicular stomatitis vaccine vector protected non-human
primates pre- post-exposure challenge studies. several antiviral therapies
are currently investigation, tested in
non-human primate models. antisense therapies, oligonucleotides inhibit 
viral replication, shown promising results non-human primates following
post-exposure treatment. light severity ebolavirus disease the
observed increase ebolavirus outbreaks past decade, expedited
translation potential candidate therapeutics vaccines bench to
bedside currently challenging task field. here, review the
current state ebolavirus research, emphasis prophylactic and
therapeutic intervention strategies.
