a series 1-isopropylsulfonyl-2-amine benzimidazole derivatives were
synthesized evaluated anti-hepatitis b virus (hbv) activity and
cytotoxicity hepg2.2.15 cell line. general, derivatives are
potent hbv inhibitors (ic(50)<4 microm) high selectivity indices (sis>40).
compounds 5b-e, g, j, 9a among prominent compounds, with
ic(50)s 0.70-2.0 microm sis 41-274. potent anti-hbv activity and
safety profiles promising compounds 5d j (ic(50)s=0.70 microm,
sis>120) demonstrate potential series benzimidazoles the
development new anti-hbv drugs.
