to fully characterize relationship clinical manifestations of
human immunodeficiency virus infection t4+ cell defects, determined t4+
cell number interferon gamma (ifn-gamma) production 238 patients. for
asymptomatic homosexuals, patients acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(aids)-related complex (arc), patients fully established aids, clinical 
status correlated linearly t4+ cell number t4+ cell-derived
(antigen-stimulated) ifn-gamma secretion. asymptomatic homosexuals,
abnormalities t4+ cell number ifn-gamma generation similar
irrespective human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity. patients with
arc, lymphadenopathy (la) alone la plus zoster thrombocytopenia 
displayed t4+ cell defects similar observed asymptomatic homosexuals.
patients arc la plus constitutional symptoms and/or oral thrush,
however, fewer t4+ cells, strikingly deficient ifn-gamma
production, closely resembled aids. among patients aids,
certain individuals kaposi's sarcoma (ks) alone sufficiently less
cytopenic less immunodeficient patients opportunistic infections
(ols) suggest immune impairment predisposes ks may differ. at
the time patients ks developed ols, however, t4+ cell number and
ifn-gamma-generating capacity declined remarkably low levels observed 
in virtually patients ols alone.
