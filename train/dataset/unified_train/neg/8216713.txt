using polyethylene glycol (peg) precipitation found hiv-1
seropositive patients igg containing-circulating immune complexes (cic). 
addition cic sometimes contain iga, igm, c3, and/or hiv p24 antigen.
previous work demonstrated patients plasma viremia, cd4 cell
counts less 170/mm3, symptomatic apt hiv is
precipitable peg. study report infectious hiv found in
the plasma patients plasma viremia could found 2% peg
precipitates, i.e., peg supernatants never contained infectious hiv, although
they often contained noninfectious p24 antigen. results suggested at
least infectious hiv circulating plasma infected patients
is form immune complexes. support idea also demonstrated
that infectious hiv could precipitated antiserum raised either
immunogloblins complement components.
