the rna replication complexes small positive-strand rna viruses as
poliovirus known form surfaces membranous vesicles the
cytoplasm infected mammalian cells. membranes resemble cellular
autophagosomes double-membraned morphology, cytoplasmic lumen,
lipid-rich composition presence cellular proteins lamp 1 lc3.
furthermore, lc3 protein covalently modified poliovirus infection 
manner indistinguishable observed bona fide autophagy. this
covalent modification also induced expression viral protein 2bc 
in isolation. however, differences poliovirus-induced vesicles and
autophagosomes also exist: viral-induced membranes smaller, 200-400 nm
in diameter, induced combination two viral proteins, termed 
2bc 3a. experimental suppression expression proteins autophagy
pathway found reduce viral yield, arguing pathway facilitates
viral infection, rather clearing it. hypothesized that, addition 
to providing membranous surfaces assembly viral rna replication complexes,
double-membraned vesicles provide topological mechanism deliver cytoplasmic 
contents, including mature virus, extracellular milieu without lysing 
cell.
