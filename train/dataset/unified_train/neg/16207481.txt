to better understand mechanisms transformation oncogene her-2, we
transduced human mammary epithelial (hme) cell line mcf-10a her-2 and
developed cell line appeared moderately overexpress her-2. these
mcf-10her-2 cells unable grow absence epidermal growth factor
(egf). however, coexpression her-2 hpv-16 oncoproteins e6 e7
resulted egf-independent cells expressed high levels of
constitutively activated her-2. interestingly, coexpression e7 her-2
resulted cells egf-independent growth express her-2 
to high levels, coexpression e6 her-2 resulted cells expressing
higher levels her-2, still dependent egf growth and
survival. mcf-10her-2e7 her-2/e6e7 cells exhibited constitutive
activation form epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) faster
electrophoretic mobility egfr activated exogenous growth factors.
exposure cells egfr activation zd1839 (iressa), concentrations
specific egfr, little influence proliferation cells with
amplified her-2 little egfr. results indicate her-2, e6, and
e7 cooperate endogenous egfr yield fully transformed cells.
