adenovirus infection inhibits synthesis processing rrna redistributes 
nucleolar antigens. adenovirus protein v associates nucleoli infected
cells. study delineates regions protein v independently capable of
nucleolar targeting. also, evidence presented protein v unique
property relocating nucleolin b23 cytoplasm transiently
expressed uninfected cells. point mutation analysis indicates a
role c terminus protein v redirection nucleolin b23 to
the cytoplasm. first time adenovirus protein shown to
have direct effect nucleolar antigens isolation viral infection.
moreover, adenovirus protein v first protein demonstrated capable of
redirecting nucleolin b23 cytoplasm.
