citrobacter freundii, gram-negative bacterium, causes many opportunistic
infections. bacteriophage phicfp-1 isolated characterized ability 
to lyse multidrug-resistant clinical c. freundii strain p10159. transmission 
electron microscopy showed phage icosahedral head short
tail, making podoviridae family member. single-step growth experiment, 
phicfp-1 exhibited eclipse period 20 min burst size 100 particles 
per cell. genome assembled circular molecule genomic sequencing was
completed. however, based genome content organization, categorized 
as classic t7-related phage, phages known linear genomes
with direct terminal repeats. quick simple method established
herein, 38,625-bp linear double-stranded dna 229-bp direct terminal
repeats accurately identified. genome contained 43 putative open reading 
frames trna genes. using proteomics-based approach, seven viral two 
host proteins purified phicfp-1 particles identified. comparative
genomics recombination analyzes revealed close genetic relatedness among
phicfp-1, phiyeo3-12/vb_yenp_ap5 (from yersinia enterocolitica o3), phisg-jl2
(from salmonella enterica).
