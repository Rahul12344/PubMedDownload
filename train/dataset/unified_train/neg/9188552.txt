to assess role equine herpesvirus type 1 (ehv-1) icp0 protein (eicp0) 
in gene regulation, variety molecular studies eicp0 gene gene
products attenuated cell culture-adapted kentucky (kya) strain 
the ab4p strain conducted. investigations revealed (i) icp0
open reading frame (orf) kya virus strain 1,257 bp size would
encode protein 419 amino acids, comparison icp0 gene (orf63)
of ab4p strain 1,596 bp (e. a. telford, m. s. watson, k. mcbride, a.
j. davison, virology 189:304-316, 1992), internal in-frame deletion 
339 bp; (ii) one early transcript 1.4 kb predicted encode eicp0 protein
and late transcript 1.8 kb detected northern blot analyses using
probes containing eicp0 orf; (iii) kya eicp0 protein (50 kda) the
ab4p eicp0 protein (80 kda) expressed several species early proteins
that first detected 3 4 h postinfection western blot analyses of
infected-cell polypeptides, using antiserum generated trpe fusion protein
that harbors amino acids 46 153 eicp0 protein; (iv) eicp0
protein ehv-1 strains potent transactivator ehv-1 genes.
transient expression assays using simian virus 40 expression construct the
eicp0 protein kya strain showed eicp0 protein independently
transactivated chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter constructs the
control immediate-early promoter (3.9-fold), early thymidine kinase
promoter (95-fold), late (gamma1) ir5 promoter (85-fold), late
(gamma2) glycoprotein k promoter (21-fold). finding eicp0 protein of
the kya virus function activator gene expression indicates that
amino acids corresponding residues 319 431 ab4p eicp0 protein are
not essential eicp0 transactivation ehv-1 promoters.
