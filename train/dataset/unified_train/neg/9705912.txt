acute infection cd4+ lymphoid cells human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(hiv-1) induces increase intracellular concentration potassium (k+).
media containing reduced elevated concentrations k+ used to
investigate role ion hiv-1 production cytopathology.
incubation cd4+ lymphoblastoid cells acutely infected hiv-1 (strain lai) in
low k+ medium resulted approximately 50% decrease hiv-1 production and
markedly diminished hiv-1 induced cytopathic effects (cpe) relative cells
incubated medium containing normal k+ concentration (approximately 5 mm).
incubation hiv-1 infected cells media containing elevated concentrations of
k+ medium. cells mm) increased hiv-1 production two- fivefold the
amount produced cells incubated normal k+ medium. cells incubated high
k+ media also displayed enhanced hiv-1-induced cytopathology. decrease in
hiv-1 production low k+ medium increase high k+ media could a
accounted effects hiv-1 reverse transcription. however, low k+ medium
inhibited hiv-1 protein synthesis high k+ media increased hiv-1 protein
synthesis. results suggest hiv-1-induced increase intracellular
is required efficient viral replication induce cytopathology.
