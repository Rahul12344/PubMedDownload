background: diagnosis pneumocystis pneumonia requires morphological
demostration p. carinii (now re-named p. jiroveci). although
bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) fluid cytology constitutes formidable tool for
detecting infection, studies utility bal cytology in
diagnosing pcp available india. present study reports clinical
spectrum, cytomorphological features utility bal cytology in
diagnosing pneumocystis infection tertiary care centre india.
methods: retrospective study 13 patients pcp, diagnosed examination of
bal fluid.
results: mean age patients 41.2 years. one patient human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection, 10 renal transplant 
receipients immunosuppressive therapy. immune status two patients was
unknown. fever, cough shortness breath main presenting symptoms. 
radiological diagnosis pneumocystis pneumonia offered one case.
foamy alveolar casts present cases. silver methanamine stain enhanced
the rounded, helmet cleft forms sporozoites. inflammatory infiltrate was
mainly polymorphonuclear.
conclusions: bal cytology, thus, constitutes useful diagnostic modality for
morphological documentation reliable diagnosis pneumocystis pneumonia in
an immunocompromised host. pneumocystis pneumonia appears common
opportunistic infection renal transplant receipients india.
