for diagnosis hiv-1 infection, attempts made detect anti-hiv-1 igg 
urine sensitive enzyme immunoassay (immune complex transfer enzyme
immunoassay) using recombinant reverse transcriptase (rt) p17 antigens.
anti-hiv-1 igg urine reacted simultaneously 2,4-dinitrophenyl-bovine 
serum albumin-recombinant protein conjugate recombinant protein-enzyme
conjugate. enzymes used labels horseradish peroxidase rt and
escherichia coli beta-d-galactosidase p17. complex formed, consisting 
the three components, trapped onto polystyrene balls coated with
affinity-purified (anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl group) igg, eluted epsilon
n-2,4-dinitrophenyl-l-lysine transferred polystyrene balls coated with
affinity-purified (anti-human igg gamma-chain) igg. finally, bound enzyme
activity assayed fluorometry. urine samples collected 100
seronegative subjects 70 seropositive subjects. sensitivity and
specificity 100% unconcentrated urine samples. positivity 
confirmed preincubation urine samples excess antigens. the
positivity negativity one two antigens could confirmed with
the antigen. positivity low signals could confirmed by
concentration urine samples. detection anti-hiv-1 igg urine the
immune complex transfer enzyme immunoassay using different antigens would make
diagnosis hiv-1 infection possible.
