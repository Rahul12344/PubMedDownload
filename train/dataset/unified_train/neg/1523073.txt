this study analyzes correlation basic laboratory test results with
clinical outcome 94 children perinatally acquired human immunodeficiency 
virus 1 infection receive zidovudine study period 1983 
to 1988. two life-threatening conditions highly correlated survival,
opportunistic infection severe encephalopathy, end points the
study. median age 25 months 30 (32%) 94 children developed
such conditions (group i), survival 3 years age 48% (95%
confidence interval, 24 72%), contrasting 97% survival rate (95%
confidence interval, 94 100%) remaining 64 (68%) children not
developed conditions age 25 months. (group ii). compared children in
group ii, children life-threatening complications likely the
onset symptoms younger lower cd4 count, impaired vitro 
lymphocytic proliferation lack p18 p25 antibodies western blot
profile and, progression disease, negative slope the
subsequent cd4 counts. results highlight need early diagnosis of
the human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection children demonstrate 
is possible determine prognosis disease early first 
year life.
