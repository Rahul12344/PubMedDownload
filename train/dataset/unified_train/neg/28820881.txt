background: april, 2004, chikungunya virus (chikv) re-emerged kenya and
eventually spread islands indian ocean basin, south-east asia, 
the americas. virus, often associated high levels viremia in
humans, mostly transmitted urban vector, aedes aegypti. expansion
of chikv presents public health challenge locally internationally. 
this study, investigated ability ae. aegypti mosquitoes three
distinct cities kenya; mombasa (outbreak prone), kisumu, nairobi (no
documented outbreak) transmit chikv.
methodology/principal findings: aedes aegypti mosquito populations exposed
to different doses chikv (105.6-7.5 plaque-forming units[pfu]/ml) an
infectious blood meal. transmission ascertained collecting testing
saliva samples individual mosquitoes 5, 7, 9, 14 days post exposure. 
infection dissemination estimated testing body legs,
respectively, individual mosquitoes selected days post exposure. tissue
culture assays used determine presence infectious viral particles 
in body, leg, saliva samples. number days post exposure no
effect infection, dissemination, transmission rates, rates
increased increase exposure dose three populations. although
the rates highest ae. aegypti mombasa titers ≥106.9 pfu/ml, the
differences observed statistically significant (χ2 ≤ 1.04, df = 1, p ≥
0.31). overall, 71% infected mosquitoes developed disseminated
infection, 21% successfully transmitted virus capillary tube,
giving estimated transmission rate 10% mosquitoes ingested
≥106.9 pfu/ml chikv. three populations ae. aegypti infectious as
early 5-7 days post exposure. average, viral dissemination occurred
when body titers ≥104 pfu/ml populations.
conclusions/significance: populations ae. aegypti mombasa, nairobi, and
kisumu competent laboratory vectors chikv. viremia infectious 
blood meal important factor ae. aegypti susceptibility transmission
of chikv. addition viremia levels, temperature feeding behavior ae. 
aegypti may also contribute observed disease patterns.
