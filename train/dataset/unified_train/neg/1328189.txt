to investigate role protein-binding sites mu ends dna 
strand transfer reaction, constructed mutant mini-mu molecules 
sites deleted (l3 r3) substituted (l2 r2) conserve spacing
arrangements adjacent sites. single site mutants poor substrates
for phosphodiester bond hydrolysis mu ends type 1 reactions the
absence escherichia coli integration host factor (ihf). addition ihf the
reaction stimulates type 1 cleavage 10 times delta-r3,
delta-l3, s-l2 mutants five times case s-r2 mutant
under alternate conditions. site ihf stimulation resides within the
transpositional enhancer implicates end-binding sites l2, l3, r2, and
r3 interactions enhancer. least two l2, l3, r3 sites
are required proficient reaction presence ihf. combining the
single site mutants o1 o2 partially deleted enhancer elements, have
tentatively localized interactions side functional
enhancer revealing complex circuit end-enhancer interactions. r3 site is
suggested involved interactions o2 l3 site with
o1. data also suggest possibility l2 r2 may involved in
interactions o1 o2. finally, working model predicts the
l3-o1 r3-o2 interactions may required contacts discriminating 
the mu left right ends transpososome formation.
