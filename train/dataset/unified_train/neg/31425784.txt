apoptosis universal cellular defense mechanism senescent, damaged,
genetically mutated, virally-infected cells. also critical the
maintenance liver health. fas fasl system act major death pathway
that triggers apoptosis cascade liver. systematic review and
meta-analysis, aimed investigate relationship four major
polymorphisms fas fasl genes susceptibility clearance hbv
infection. eligible studies extracted pubmed scopus no
date language restriction. ors 95% cis used evaluate the
strength association based following genetic models: (1) the
allelic, (2) homozygote, (3) dominant, (4) recessive models.
totally 7 related articles included meta-analysis; 5 studies 7
related articles investigated fasl -844c/t (rs763110) polymorphism, 4 studies
investigated fasl ivs2nt-124, 6 studies investigated fas -670 a/g (rs1800682),
and 4 studies investigated fas -1377 a/g (rs2234767) polymorphism. this
meta-analysis showed statistically significant association
between risk clearance hbv infection four studied fas fasl
polymorphisms allelic comparison genetic models. fas -670, fas -1377,
fasl -124, fasl -844 polymorphisms show significant association
with clearance risk hbv infection. therefore, seems that
susceptibility hbv infection clearance affected fas and
fasl genetic polymorphisms. but, reach definitive conclusion, further
studies larger sample size different ethnicity still needed.
