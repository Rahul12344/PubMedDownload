immunization mice dna encoding influenza virus hemagglutinin (ha)
affords complete protection lethal influenza virus infection the
means investigate mechanisms b-cell responsiveness virus challenge. 
using single-cell enzyme-linked immunospot assay, sought determine the
localization ha-specific antibody-forming cells (afcs) development 
of humoral immunity mice given ha dna vaccine gene gun. 33 days
postvaccination, populations afcs maintained spleen bone
marrow. response lethal challenge influenza virus, afcs became
localized site antigenic challenge, i.e., within draining lymph
nodes lung compartment. immunoglobulin g (igg)- iga-producing afcs
were detected lymph nodes upper lower respiratory tracts,
underscoring importance clearing virus lungs. response to
challenge required competent cd4+ cells, without afcs generated, 
even producing igm. contrast, mice vaccinated ha-containing
subunit vaccine, fewer afcs generated response challenge, these
animals less capable resisting infection. findings demonstrate the
comparable localization afcs response challenge mice vaccinated 
either ha dna live virus. moreover, former strategy generates igg-
and iga-producing plasma cells.
