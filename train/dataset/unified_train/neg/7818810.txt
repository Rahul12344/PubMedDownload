objectives: study effects microbial superantigens, staphylococcal
exotoxins (se), hiv replication monocytes following binding and
signalling major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class ii molecules.
methods: investigated effects se hiv replication monokine
production three different vitro models monocyte culture: chronically
infected monocytic cell line u1, acute infection normal monocytes different
hiv-1 strains, naturally-infected monocytes seropositive patients. p24
antigen, interleukin (il)-6 tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha production was
measured specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa).
results: staphylococcal enterotoxin b toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (1-1000
ng/ml) powerful inducers hiv-1 expression u1 cells pretreated with
granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor. se induce viral replication 
short-term cultures (days 6-21) monocytes infected vitro hivba-l,
hivlai, naturally infected vivo. induction hiv expression requires
direct interactions se mhc class ii molecules t-cell receptor
binding t-cell-monocyte contact. anti-tnf-alpha anti-il-6 neutralizing
monoclonal antibodies inhibit 61% se-induced hiv replication.
conclusions: using se linked two important pathways regulation of
hiv replication monocytes, namely signalling mhc class ii molecules
and monokine production potentially mediated induction pleiotropic
cellular transcription factor nf-kappa b. hiv-infected patients bacterial
infections common could important cofactor the
immunopathogenesis aids inducing hiv replication latently infected
monocytes. prevention might emerge beneficial patients.
