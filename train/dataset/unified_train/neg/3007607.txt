monoclonal antibody-mediated inhibition interferon-gamma-induced macrophage
antiviral resistance surface antigen expression.

vogel sn, havell ea, spitalny gl.

a monoclonal antibody (mab) specificity murine interferon-gamma
(ifn-gamma) used probe studying effect recombinant ifn-gamma 
(rifn-gamma) antiviral activity, fc receptor expression, ia antigen
induction macrophages. cultures c3h/hej peritoneal exudate macrophages were
used allow direct comparison three functions target cell
system. data provide two major findings: efficacy mab very
different depending whether murine fibroblasts macrophages used 
target cell antiviral assay, i.e., greater 20 100 times mab
was required block antiviral activity macrophage cultures; 10 50
times mab required inhibit fc receptor vs ia antigen expression in
response rifn-gamma. latter findings confirm extend previous
observations, indicate induction pathways two important
differentiation markers ifn-gamma may dissociable.
