phase trials conducted human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(hiv-1)-infected children examine pharmacokinetics, safety, and
antiretroviral activity nevirapine, nonnucleoside hiv-1 reverse
transcriptase inhibitor. nevirapine rapidly absorbed, time peak
plasma concentrations increased higher doses. clearance rapid in
chronic dosing studies predicted single-dose studies rapid
in younger children adolescent children. rash, occurred 1 the
21 study participants, single toxicity regarded nevirapine-related. at
doses > = 240 mg/m2/day, 5 10 children experienced durable suppression of
plasma p24 antigen < 50% baseline values 8 weeks nevirapine
monotherapy. viruses resistant nevirapine isolated children
during therapy, isolation always predict loss antiviral
activity. evaluation nevirapine combination therapy trials underway
