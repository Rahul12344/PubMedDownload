monoclonal antibodies (mabs) produced variant subtype of
infectious bursal disease virus (ibdv) delaware variant isolate (var-a).
splenocytes immunized mice fused myeloma cells, and
antibody-producing hybridomas screened dot-blot enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (elisa) indirect immunofluorescence (if) the
homologous isolate. specificity mabs tested viral isolates
representing six serologic subtypes ibdv three untyped ibdvs--gls,
ark, miss--found serotype 1 dot-blot elisa if. mab g11
recognized isolates, whereas h7 recognize two viruses subtype 1,
the lukert strain aphis. mabs g11 h7 neutralizing identified
both precursor proteins (vp2a) protein product (vp2b vp2) western
immunoblots. results showed antigenic determinant ibdv isolates and
antigenic variation subtype 1 viruses subtypes. confirms
and extends previous work showed ibdvs evolved subtype 1 by
alteration substitution antigenic sites.
