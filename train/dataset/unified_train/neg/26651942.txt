the 2013-present western african ebola virus disease (evd) outbreak the
largest ever recorded >28,000 reported cases. ebola virus (ebov) genome
sequencing played important role throughout outbreak; however,
relatively sequences determined patients liberia, the
second worst-affected country. here, report 140 ebov genome sequences the
second wave liberian outbreak analyze combination 782
previously published sequences throughout western african outbreak.
while multiple early introductions ebov liberia evident, majority
of liberian evd cases consistent single introduction, followed by
spread diversification within country. movement virus within
liberia widespread, reintroductions liberia served important
source continuation already ongoing evd outbreak guinea.
overall, little evidence found incremental adaptation ebov the
human host.
