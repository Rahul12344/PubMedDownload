background: etiology bacterial vaginosis (bv) poorly understood, but
better definition risk factors associated acquisition should
improve understanding complex disease entity.
methods: longitudinal cohort study young sexually active women conducted
to identify variables associated bv acquisition. seven hundred seventy-three
women without bv enrollment followed 4-month intervals 1 year. 
each visit, demographic behavioral interview data, vaginal smear the
gram stain diagnosis bv, serum sample detection herpes simplex
virus type 1 (hsv-1) hsv-2 type-specific antibodies collected.
results: overall incidence bv acquisition 36 cases/100 woman-years
(223 acquisitions bv 619 woman-years follow-up). acquisition bv
was independently associated black race, cigarette smoking, vaginal
intercourse, receptive anal sex vaginal intercourse, sex an
uncircumcised male partner, lack vaginal h2o2-producing lactobacilli, 
detection hsv-2 serum antibodies visit bv acquisition.
longitudinal analyses revealed hsv-2 serum antibodies independently
associated loss h2o2-producing lactobacilli.
conclusions: findings suggest multiple diverse risk factors can
contribute bv acquisition. also illustrate complete
understanding bv pathogenesis formulation effective bv prevention
strategies elusive. work needed determine the
specific effects hsv-2 infection vaginal flora composition the
acquisition bv.
