aim:   non-hepatitis b virus/non-hepatitis c virus-related hepatocellular
carcinoma (nbnc-hcc) often detected advanced stage, pathology
associated staging nbnc-hcc remains unclear. data mining set 
statistical techniques uncovers interactions meaningful patterns of
factors large data collection. aims study reveal
complex interactions risk factors clinical feature profiling
associated staging nbnc-hcc using data mining techniques.
methods:   database created 663 patients nbnc-hcc 20
institutions. milan criteria used staging hcc. complex
associations variables clinical feature profiling milan criteria 
were analyzed graphical modeling decision tree algorithm methods,
respectively.
results:   graphical modeling identified six factors independently associated
with milan criteria: diagnostic year hcc; diagnosis liver cirrhosis;
serum aspartate aminotransferase (ast); alanine aminotransferase (alt);
α-fetoprotein (afp); des-γ-carboxy prothrombin (dcp) levels. decision
trees created five variables classify six groups patients.
sixty-nine percent patients within milan criteria, patients 
showed afp level 200 ng/ml less, diagnosis liver cirrhosis ast
level less 93 iu/ml. hand, 18% patients within
the milan criteria, patients showed afp level 200 ng/ml 
alt level 20 iu/ml more.
conclusion:   data mining disclosed complex interactions risk factors 
clinical feature profiling associated staging nbnc-hcc.
