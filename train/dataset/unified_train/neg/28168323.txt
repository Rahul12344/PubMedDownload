the appearance single cell microorganisms earth dates back 3.5
billion years ago, ultimately leading development multicellular
organisms approximately 3 billion years later. evolutionary burst species 
diversity "struggle existence", proposed darwin, generated a
complex host defense system. host survival infection vital organs, such
as lung, requires delicate balance host defense, essential
for detection elimination pathogens host tolerance, is
critical minimizing collateral tissue damage. whereas cellular and
molecular mechanisms host defense many invading pathogens been
extensively studied, understanding host tolerance key mechanism in
maintaining host fitness extremely limited. may also explain current 
therapeutic preventive approaches targeting host defense mechanisms have
failed provide full protection severe infectious diseases, including
pulmonary influenza virus mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. this
review, aim outline various host strategies resistance tolerance for
effective protection acute chronic pulmonary infections.
