influenza causes high morbidity mortality young elderly
individuals, controlled antivirals and/or vaccines. success
of therapeutic measures predicated rapid precise diagnosis the
infection. compared three rapid influenza immunoassay (riia) kits the
diagnosis influenza virus b using 178 respiratory specimens submitted
for routine testing. bd directigen flu a+b (directigen), directigen ez flu a+b
(ez), flu flu b (now; binax) tests comparable combined
influenza virus b specificities, varying 94 98%. contrast, the
sensitivity ez significantly lower (39%) (76%) and
marginally lower directigen (56%). differences sensitivity
were evident patients >9 years old (directigen, 53%; ez, 32%;
and now, 69%). among specimens, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids yielded most
discrepant results, sensitivities varying 0 (ez) 100% (now),
followed nasopharyngeal swabs (sensitivities 27 100%) nasal washes
(50 81%). directigen kit format allowed faster completion more
cumbersome performance difficult interpretation compared 
two kits. overall, provided accurate diagnoses user-friendly
technical characteristics. however, low overall sensitivity riias
indicates used screening tools only.
