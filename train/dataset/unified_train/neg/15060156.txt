we developed model system study glucocorticoid receptor (gr)-mediated
chromatin remodeling brg1 complex. introduction brg1 atpase into
the sw-13 cell line initiates formation functional remodeling complex.
this complex able induce transcriptional activation transiently
transfected promoter wild-type chromatin-remodeling-deficient brg1
mutants, suggesting complex possesses coactivator function independent
from remodeling. transactivation chromatin template requires brg1
remodeling function, induces regions hypersensitivity transcription 
factor loading onto integrated mmtv promoter. report brg1 remodeling 
activity required gr-mediated transactivation activity
cannot replaced atp-dependent remodeling proteins. further
characterization brg1-associated factors (bafs) present cells
(for example, expression baf250 baf180) reveals baf
complex rather polybromo-associated baf complex necessary and
sufficient chromatin-remodeling component receptor functions in
vivo. results conjunction previous findings demonstrate gr
functions multiple forms swi/snf complex vivo.
