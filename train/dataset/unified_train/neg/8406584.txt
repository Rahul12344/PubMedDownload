interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) important cytokine regulates
inflammatory immune response mechanisms. ifn-gamma enhances presentation 
and recognition antigens inducing expression major
histocompatibility complex (mhc) proteins, activating effector cells and
mononuclear phagocytes, modulating immunoglobulin production class
selection b cells. inappropriate production ifn-gamma implicated
in pathogenesis several autoimmune inflammatory diseases graft 
rejection. here, describe recombinant inhibitor ifn-gamma, termed murine 
ifn-gamma receptor immunoadhesin (mifn-gamma r-igg). constructed this
immunoadhesin linking extracellular portion mouse ifn-gamma r to
the hinge fc region igg1 heavy chain. murine ifn-gamma r-igg is
secreted transfected cells disulphide-bonded homodimer binds
ifn-gamma bivalently, high affinity species-specific manner. in
vitro, mifn-gamma r-igg block mifn-gamma-induced antiviral activity and
expression class mhc antigen h-2kk cultured cells. vivo,
mifn-gamma r-igg block function endogenous mifn-gamma mouse models 
of infection listeria monocytogenes contact sensitivity. these
results show mifn-gamma r-igg effective specific inhibitor of
mifn-gamma vitro vivo. thus, general, ifn-gamma receptor
immunoadhesins may useful investigating biological functions of
ifn-gamma well preventing deleterious effects ifn-gamma human
disease.
