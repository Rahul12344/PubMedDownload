sexually transmitted infections affect hundreds millions people worldwide. 
both human immunodeficiency virus (hiv-1 -2) herpes simplex virus-2
(hsv-2) remain incurable, urging development new prevention strategies.
while current prophylactic technologies dependent strict user adherence to
achieve efficacy, dearth delivery vehicles provide discreet
and convenient administration, combined prolonged-delivery active agents.
to address needs, created electrospun fibers (efs) comprised of
fda-approved polymers, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (plga) and
poly(dl-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) (plcl), provide sustained-release in
vitro protection hiv-1 hsv-2. plga plcl efs, incorporating the
antiretroviral, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tdf), exhibited sustained-release 
for 4 weeks, provided complete vitro protection hsv-2 and
hiv-1 24h 1 wk, respectively, based doses tested. vitro cell
culture epivaginal tissue tests confirmed safety fibers vaginal and
cervical cells, highlighting potential plga plcl efs multipurpose
next-generation drug delivery vehicles.
