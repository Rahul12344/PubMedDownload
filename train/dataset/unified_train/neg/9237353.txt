a strong promoter bacteriophage mb78 minus 35 consensus sequence
although tgn motif immediately upstream minus 10 sequence well 
the rich element. efficiently recognised sigma 70 rna
polymerase, however, phage-specific factor competes sigma 70 rna
polymerase binding region, binding factor stronger
than polymerase. contrary reports literature the
polymerase appears bind element whereas phage-specific
factor does. latter seems involved regulation promoter
activity.
