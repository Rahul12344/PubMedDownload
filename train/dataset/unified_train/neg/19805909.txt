the development highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) treat
individuals infected hiv-1 dramatically improved patient outcomes, but
haart still fails cure infection. latent viral reservoir resting
cd4+ cells major barrier virus eradication. elimination this
reservoir requires reactivation latent virus. however, strategies for
reactivating hiv-1 nonspecific cell activation clinically
unacceptable toxicities. describe development believe to
be novel vitro model hiv-1 latency used search compounds
that reverse latency. human primary cd4+ cells transduced the
prosurvival molecule bcl-2, resulting cells shown recapitulate
the quiescent state resting cd4+ cells vivo. using model system, 
screened small-molecule libraries identified compound reactivated
latent hiv-1 without inducing global cell activation,
5-hydroxynaphthalene-1,4-dione (5hn). unlike previously described
latency-reversing agents, 5hn activated latent hiv-1 ros nf-kappab
without affecting nuclear factor activated cells (nfat) pkc,
demonstrating tcr pathways dissected utilized purge latent
virus. study expands number classes latency-reversing therapeutics 
and demonstrates utility vitro model finding strategies to
eradicate hiv-1 infection.
