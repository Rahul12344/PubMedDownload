the rna synthesis machinery non-segmented negative-sense rna viruses comprises
a ribonucleoprotein complex genomic rna coated nucleocapsid protein
(n) associated polymerase. work vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv), a
prototype, supports model rna synthesis whereby n displaced the
template allow catalytic subunit polymerase, large protein (l) 
to gain access rna. consistent model, purified l copy
synthetic rna contains requisite promoter sequences. full processivity l 
requires phosphoprotein cofactor template-associated n. we
demonstrate importance 2' position rna template the
substrate nucleotide triphosphates initiation elongation l. vsv
polymerase initiate dna rna incorporate dntps. during
elongation, polymerase sensitive 2' modifications, although dntps can
be incorporated, mixed dna-rna templates function. modifications the
2' position ntp, including 2',3'-ddctp, arabinose-ctp, and
2'-o-methyl-ctp, inhibit polymerase, whereas 2'-amino-ctp incorporated. the
inhibitory effects ntps pronounced authentic n-rna the
exception dgtp, incorporated. work underscores sensitivity
of vsv polymerase nucleotide modifications initiation and
elongation highlights importance 2'-hydroxyl template 
substrate ntp. moreover, study demonstrates critical role the
template-associated n protein architecture rna-dependent rna
polymerase domain l.
