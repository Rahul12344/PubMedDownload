background. 1.45 million deaths tuberculosis 2011. a
substantial proportion active pulmonary tuberculosis cases countries 
tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection, aids highly
endemic remain undiagnosed reliance sputum-smear microscopy.
this study evaluated performance xpert mtb/rif assay tertiary
care referral center zambia, country burden tuberculosis and
hiv infection high. methods. total 881 adult inpatients admitted to
university teaching hospital lusaka able produce sputum were
enrolled analyzed study, irrespective admission diagnosis. sputum
specimens analyzed fluorescence smear microscopy, xpert mtb/rif
assay, mycobacterial growth indicator tube (mgit) culture,and mgit
drug-susceptibility testing. sensitivity specificity xpert mtb/rif
assay evaluated using culture gold standard. results.
culture-confirmed tuberculosis found 201 881 patients (22.8%). the
specificity xpert mtb/rif assay 95.0% (95% confidence interval [ci],
92.4%–96.8%),and sensitivity 86.1% (95% ci, 80.3%–90.4%). sputum
smear–negative, culture-positive cases, assay 74.7% sensitive (95% ci,
64.6%–82.8%), identifying 71 additional tuberculosis cases detected
by smear microscopy.a total 18 111 patients tuberculosis were
tested (16.2%) multidrug-resistant (mdr) tuberculosis.the sensitivity and
specificity xpert mtb/rif assay detecting culture-confirmed,
rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis 81.3% (95% ci, 53.7%–95.0%) 97.5% (95% 
ci,90.4%–99.6%), respectively. conclusions. xpert mtb/rif assay performs
better smear microscopy inpatient setting country where
tuberculosis hiv infection highly endemic. assessment usefulness
and cost-effectiveness increased detection tuberculosis cases missed by
sputum smear concomitant screening mdr tuberculosis among adult
inpatients attending tertiary care referral centers countries a
high burden tuberculosis hiv infection warranted [corrected].
