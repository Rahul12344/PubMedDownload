the prefemoral efferent lymphatics sheep persistently infected (pi) with
border disease virus (bdv) cannulated order study effects the
virus cells immune system. efferent lymphocytes recovered pi sheep
were phenotyped using panel monoclonal antibodies (moab) specific ovine 
cell-surface markers compared lymphocytes recovered normal, healthy
controls. pi sheep increased percentage cells expressing t
cell-associated molecules cd5, cd4, cd8 t19, also increase cells
expressing cd1 population cells expressing low levels t19
molecule present control sheep. lymphocytes examined
for presence bdv using virus-specific moab. average 8.5% the
efferent lymphocytes pi sheep carried virus antigen. bdv antigen also
found mononuclear cells connective tissue lymph nodes indicating
widespread virus dissemination within lymphoid system pi sheep.
