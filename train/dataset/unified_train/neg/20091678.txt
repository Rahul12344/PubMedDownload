we aimed determine antiviral activity safety new nucleotide
analogue, lb80380, chronic hepatitis b (chb) patients with
lamivudine-resistant virus. sixty-five patients lamivudine-resistant virus
were randomized receive five ascending daily doses (30, 60, 90, 150, 240 mg)
of lb80380. lb80380 given together lamivudine first 4 weeks,
followed 8 weeks lb80380 monotherapy. followed 24 weeks of
adefovir. hepatitis b virus (hbv) dna levels, serology, liver biochemistry, and
safety monitored. extent hbv dna reduction week 12 was
dose-dependent. mean reduction baseline 2.81, 3.21, 3.92, 4.16, 
4.00 log(10) copies/ml five ascending dose groups. dose-proportionate
effect statistically significant (p < 0.001) decrease hbv dna
levels average 1.54 log(10) copies/ml every 1-unit increase in
log(10) dose lb80380. 93.4% patients, hbv dna decreased >2 log(10)
copies/ml, 11.5% patients undetectable hbv dna levels (<300 copies/ml)
by week 12. hbv dna suppression maintained 24 weeks adefovir
treatment. hepatitis b e antigen seroconversion normalization alanine
aminotransferase seen 14.6% 24.6% patients, respectively, week 
12; 44.6% patients experienced mild self-limiting adverse events, none 
which attributed study drug.conclusion: lb80380 doses 240
mg safe, well tolerated, effective reducing viral load chb patients 
with lamivudine-resistant virus period 12 weeks.
