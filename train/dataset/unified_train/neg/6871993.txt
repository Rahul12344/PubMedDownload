small genome segment.

nucleotide sequencing demonstrated small genome segment of
bunyaviruses contains genetic information two viral proteins (n nss) 
in overlapping reading frames (akashi bishop, 1983; cabradilla et al., in
press). using 3' end-labeled genome probes, la crosse virus (lac) infected cells 
were shown contain three leader rnas, start position 1 terminate 
at approximate positions 74, 95, 115 3' end genome. primer
extension s1 mapping studies shown lac-infected cells contain seven
mrnas, five initiate positions 1, 74, 101, 117, 123 two 
which initiate approximate positions 147 159 3' end small 
genome segment. existence multiple leader rnas mrnas small
genome segment may allow access overlapping reading frames ribosomes
that still initiate 5' proximal augs, without need splice the
mrna.
