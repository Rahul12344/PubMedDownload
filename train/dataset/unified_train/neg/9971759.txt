human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) exclusively uses trna3lys initiate
reverse transcription. novel hiv-1 mutant stably utilizes trnamet rather 
than trna3lys primer previously identified [hxb2(met-ac] (s.-m. kang, z.
zhang, c. d. morrow, j. virol. 71:207-217, 1997). comparison rna secondary
structures unique sequence (u5)-primer binding site (pbs) viral rna genome
alone complexed trnamet hxb2(met-ac) revealed structural motifs in
common u5-pbs wild-type virus. current study, mutations
were constructed alter u5-pbs structure disrupt u5-pbs-trnamet
interaction virus derived hxb2(met-ac). mutant viruses
were infectious following transfection coculture supt1 cells. analysis
of initiation reverse transcription revealed mutants were
impaired compared hxb2(met-ac). genetic stability pbs each
virus determined following vitro culture. two mutant proviral constructs, 
one predicted completely disrupt stem-loop structure u5 other
predicted destabilize contact regions u5 trnamet, reverted back to
contain pbs complementary trna3lys. mutants maintained pbs
complementary trnamet vitro culture, although contained multiple 
nucleotide substitutions within u5-pbs starting proviral clones.
most interestingly, viral mutant containing 32-nucleotide deletion between
nucleotides 142 173, encompassing regions u5 interact trnamet, 
maintained pbs complementary trnamet following vitro culture. 
proviral clones recovered mutant, however, contained additional
19-nucleotide insertion u5. rna modeling u5-pbs mutant
demonstrated additional mutations present u5 following culture
restored rna structures similar modeled hxb2(met-ac). results
provide strong genetic evidence multiple sequence structural elements in
u5 addition pbs involved interaction trna used 
initiation reverse transcription.
