childhood morbidity mortality diarrhoeal diseases high, particularly
in low-income countries noroviruses sapoviruses among most
frequent causes worldwide. epidemiology diversity remain well
studied many african countries. assess positivity rate the
diversity sapoviruses noroviruses northwest ethiopia, november
2015 april 2016, total 450 faecal samples collected outpatient
children aged &lt;5 years presented diarrhoea. samples screened for
noroviruses sapoviruses real-time rt-pcr. partial vp1 genes were
sequenced, genotyped phylogenetically analysed. norovirus sapovirus stool
positivity rate 13.3% 10.0%, respectively. noroviruses included gii.4
(35%), gii.6 (20%), gii.17 (13.3%), gii.10 (10%), gii.2 (6.7%), gii.16 (5%),
gii.7 (3.3%), gii.9, gii.13, gii.20 gi.3 (1.7% each) strains. for
sapoviruses, gi.1, gii.1 (20.0% each), gii.6 (13.3%), gi.2 (8.9%), gii.2 (11.1%),
gv.1 (8.9%), giv.1 (6.7%), gi.3 gii.4 (2.2% each) genotypes detected.
this study demonstrates high genetic diversity noroviruses sapoviruses
in northwest ethiopia. positivity rate stool samples young children
with diarrhoea high caliciviruses. continued monitoring is
recommended identify trends genetic diversity seasonal variations.
