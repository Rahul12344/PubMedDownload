in report, anti-hepatitis b virus (hbv) activity of
dehydrocheilanthifoline (dhch), quaternary ammonium alkaloid isolated 
traditional chinese medicine corydalis saxicola bunting (papaveraceae), was
determined vitro. following six days treatment, dhch efficiently suppressed
the secretions hbsag hbeag hepg2.2.15 cell cultures, a
half-maximal inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) 15.84 17.12 μm, 
therapeutic index (ti) 7.32 6.77, respectively. studies revealed
that dhch reduced levels extracellular dna, intracellular dna and
covalently closed circular dna (cccdna) hbv dose-dependent and
time-dependent manner, ic(50) values 15.08, 7.62 8.25 μm,
respectively six days treatment. contrast, level viral
pre-genomic rna (pgrna) increased 6.13-fold treatment dhch. together, 
it demonstrated first time dhch could significantly inhibit 
replication hbv, warrants studies antiviral mechanisms of
dhch, suggests may promising candidate therapy hbv
infection.
