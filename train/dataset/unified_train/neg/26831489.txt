background: fatigue common symptom liver disease well
characterized patients chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv).
aims: assessed rate fatigue using validated instrument patients
with hbv identified demographic, virologic, clinical features associated 
with fatigue cross-sectional cohort study hepatitis b research
network.
methods: participants english- spanish-speaking adults chronic hbv 
who pregnant treatment. fatigue measured using promis®
fatigue 7-item short form.
results: sample included 948 adults: median age 42; 51 % female; 71 % asian; 
74 % college educated; 77 % employed; 41 % inactive hbv carriers; 36 % with
active chronic disease; 2 % advanced fibrosis, defined ast-platelet
ratio index (apri) > 1.50. patients chronic hbv mean fatigue t-score
of 46.8 ± sd = 7.9, compared mean fatigue t-score 50.0 ± 10 us
general population (p < .0001). univariate analyses, greater fatigue was
associated demographic clinical features female sex, lower
income, comorbidities, higher apri score, poorer mental health (p <
0.05). multivariate analysis, female sex (p < .001), poorer mental health (p <
.001), apri score (p = .005), history diabetes (p = .039) the
strongest independent predictors.
