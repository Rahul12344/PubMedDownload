background: data etiology chronic enteropathy aids patients are
scarce dependent upon geographical area. aim study
was detect microorganisms potentially associated chronic enteropathy in
aids patients diarrhoea one month, initial negative
routine stool bacterial cultures examinations ova parasites. the
degrees associated intestinal malabsorption immunodeficiency also
analysed.
patients methods: forty consecutive patients recruited january 1993
to december 1994. following studies performed: intestinal absorption
tests (d-xylose 14c-triolein), cd4/cd8 cell counts, microbiological studies
(standard stool cultures detection bacteria examinations ova and
parasites including detection enterocitozoon bieneusi spores the
weber's stain), upper gastrointestinal endoscopy colonoscopy intestinal
biopsies blood cultures cmv mycobacteria.
results: median duration diarrhoea 4 months mean weight loss
was 8.4 kg. ninety percent patients less 0.1 x 10(9) cd4+ cells/l,
with mean cd4+ cell count 0.035 x 10(9)/l. malabsorption found 84% of
patients. etiological diagnosis chronic enteropathy reached 60% of
the patients. yield pathological examination 37% the
microbiological test using samples faeces blood positive 45% and
20% cases respectively. frequently identified microorganisms cmv
(10 cases), e. bieneusi (9), enterobacteria (8), cryptosporidium parvum (5),
leishmania donovani (2). patients enteropathy caused e. bieneusi had
lower count cd4 cells (p = 0.005) higher serum levels alkaline
phosphatase (p = 0.02) patients cmv enteropathy.
conclusions: stool weber's stain cmv mycobacterial blood cultures 
be added standard work-up diagnosis patients chronic diarrhoea and
a cd4+cells count 0.1 x 10(9) l. upper and/or lower gastrointestinal
endoscopies intestinal biopsies performed patients with
persistent diarrhea without microbiological diagnosis lack response to
treatment.
