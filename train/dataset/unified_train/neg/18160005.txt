this study analyzed genes pol env determine genetic variability of
hiv-1 central brazil. forty-one isolates hiv-1-infected individuals had
protease, reverse transcriptase, c2c3/ env amplified nested pcr and
sequenced. subtype determined program rega phylogenetic
analyses. samples identified putative recombinant forms analyzed by
simplot. high prevalence subtype b (95.1%) observed, followed mosaic 
viruses b/f (4.9%). amino acid sequences 30 hiv-1 isolates analyzed
for antigenic intrasubtype diversity. prevalent gp120 v3 loop motif 
was gpgr (united states/europe) (43.3%), described b f subtypes,
followed gpgk tetrapeptide (10%). brazilian variant b" (gwgr), gfgr,
and glgr tetrapeptides found 6.7%. v3 variants found eight 
isolates (26.7%). phylogenetic tree analysis also performed order to
verify relationship hiv-1 samples central brazil hiv-1
sequences circulate brazil. subtype b sequences central brazil
formed polyphyletic cluster tree, indicating strains are
similar geographic regions. results contribute the
understanding hiv brazil, may prove useful development of
vaccine candidates.
