sciatic nerves rhesus monkeys infected cam wis. '45 strains human 
poliomyelitis virus fixed formalin, sectioned, fragmented, examined
in electron microscope. neurotubules nerves infected 
cam strain normal appearance small number show presence of
dense particles irregularly aligned within edges neurotubules. the
diameters particles range 160 500 a, mean 330 a. the
particles found regions along nerve varied time 
infection, indicating central movement morphological alteration the
order 2 mm. per hour. relatively abundant dense particulate material found
in nerves infected wis. '45 strain virus particles chiefly
attached edges neurotubules adjacent areas field.
the dense particles appear associated virus infection no
further characterization possible time.
