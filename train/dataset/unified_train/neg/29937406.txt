viral envelope proteins required productive viral entry initiation of
infection. although humoral immune system provides ample evidence for
targeting envelope proteins antiviral strategy, few
pharmacological interventions mode action. contrast to
classical antiviral targets viral proteases polymerases, viral
envelope proteins class well-conserved active site be
rationally targeted small molecules. previously identified compounds that
inhibit dengue virus binding envelope protein, e. here, show that
these small molecules inhibit dengue virus fusion map binding site of
these compounds specific pocket e. demonstrate inhibition of
zika, west nile, japanese encephalitis viruses compounds, providing 
pharmacological evidence pocket target developing broad-spectrum
antivirals multiple, mosquito-borne flavivirus pathogens.
