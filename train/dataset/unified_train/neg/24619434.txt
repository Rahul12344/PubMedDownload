simultaneous infection multiple parasite species (viruses, bacteria,
helminths, protozoa fungi) commonplace. reports show co-infected
humans worse health single infections. however, have
little understanding co-infecting parasites interact within human hosts.
we used data 300 published studies construct network offers
the first broad indications groups co-infecting parasites tend to
interact. network three levels comprising parasites, resources they
consume immune responses elicit, connected potential, observed
and experimentally proved links. pairs parasite species potential 
interact indirectly shared resources, rather immune
responses parasites. addition, network comprised 10 tightly knit 
groups, eight associated particular body parts, seven of
which dominated parasite-resource links. reported co-infection humans 
is therefore structured physical location within body, bottom-up,
resource-mediated processes often influencing how, which
co-infecting parasites interact. many indirect interactions show treating
an infection could affect infections co-infected patients, the
compartmentalized structure network limit far indirect
effects likely spread.
