the glycoprotein b (gb) highly conserved among distinct human herpesvirus 7
(hhv-7) strains. similarly herpesvirus glycoproteins, gb been
assumed induce specific human immune response. however, appear as
an immunodominant protein conventional immunoblot assays. recombinant gb,
obtained either escherichia coli baculovirus expression systems, did
react specifically hhv-7-seropositive sera, main corresponding
epitopes located n-terminal part. 24-amino-acid peptide,
corresponding predicted hydrophilicity peak presenting extensive
homology betaherpesvirus glycoproteins, selected region at
positions 129 152 gb sequence. tested enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (elisa), peptide specifically reacted with
hhv-7-seropositive sera. reactivity significantly inhibited the
preincubation sera peptide itself, lysates gb-expressing cells, or
lysates hhv-7-infected cells. reactivity significantly modified
when sera preincubated lysates either human cytomegalovirus (hcmv)- 
or hhv-6-infected cells. cross-sectional studies including children and
adults, 49 61 serum samples (80%) found positive hhv-7
elisa, independent reactivity hcmv. longitudinal serological study 
of 17 children first 4 years life showed level of
elisa-detected antibodies significantly decreased within weeks birth 
and increased following months, likely reflecting, respectively, 
loss maternal antibodies occurrence seroconversion. results
demonstrate gb peptide elisa might useful tool serological
study hhv-7 infection.
