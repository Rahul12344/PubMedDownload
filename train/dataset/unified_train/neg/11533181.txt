human immunodeficiency virus-type (hiv-1) infection elicits antibodies (abs)
directed several regions gp120 gp41 envelope glycoproteins.
many abs able neutralize t-cell-line-adapted strains (tcla) of
hiv-1, effectively neutralize primary hiv-1 isolates. nature
of hiv-1 neutralization carefully studied using human monoclonal abs
(mabs), ability mabs act synergy neutralize hiv-1 has
also extensively studied. however, synergy studies conducted 
using tcla strains. determine nature ab interaction hiv-1 primary
isolate neutralization, panel 12 anti-hiv-1 human immunoglobulin g (igg)
mabs, specific epitopes gp120 gp41, used. initial tests showed
that six mabs, well scd4, used individually, able to
neutralize dualtropic primary isolate hiv-1(89.6); mabs giving significant
neutralization 2 10 microg/ml included 2f5 (anti-gp41), 50-69 (anti-gp41), 
igg1b12 (anti-gp120(cd4bd)), 447-52d (anti-gp120(v3)), 2g12 (anti-gp120), and
670-d (anti-gp120(c5)). studies reagent interaction, 16 binary
combinations reagents tested ability neutralize hiv-1(89.6).
reagent combinations tested included one neutralizing mab scd4, six pairs
consisting two neutralizing mabs, nine pairs consisting one
neutralizing mab another non-neutralizing mab. assess interaction 
the latter type combination, new mathematical treatment reagent
interaction developed since previously used methods could used when
both reagents neutralize. synergy noted scd4 neutralizing
anti-gp120(v3) mab. antagonism noted two pairs anti-gp41 mabs (one
neutralizing one non-neutralizing). 13 pairs mabs tested 
displayed additive effects. studies suggest abs rarely act in
synergy neutralize primary isolate hiv-1(89.6); many anti-hiv-1 abs act
additively mediate biological function.
