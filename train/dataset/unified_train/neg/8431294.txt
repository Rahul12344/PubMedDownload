expression foreign proteins baculovirus-insect cell expression system
has limited difficulties rapid identification purification of
recombinant virus. although process identifying recombinant virus been
greatly facilitated introduction vectors lead insect cell
co-expression beta-galactosidase foreign genes interest, isolation 
pure recombinant virus using plaque purification may still take several weeks 
months accomplish. using fluorescent beta-galactosidase substrate, have
established insect cells harboring recombinant virus rapidly isolated
using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. pure recombinant virus be
readily obtained using cellular fraction, pure viral culture
generally obtained within 2-3 weeks insect cell transfection.
