papillomavirus transforming functions.

howley pm, yang yc, spalholz ba, rabson ms.

the bovine papillomavirus type 1 (bpv-1) served model unravelling
the molecular genetics papillomaviruses. bpv-1 transformation rodent
cells tissue culture provided means study viral functions
involved latent infection cells induction cellular
proliferation functions. bpv-1 shown encode two independent
transforming genes, induce cellular transformation in
susceptible rodent cells. two genes apparently act synergistically in
transforming mouse c127 cells. deletion mutagenesis studies shown the
expression one genes (e6) required efficient tumorigenesis and
anchorage independence. bpv-1 also encodes functions may act indirectly 
affect transformation. bpv-1 contains transcriptional enhancers act 
a position-independent orientation-independent manner increase the
transcriptional activity heterologous gene. one elements, 
located non-coding region genome, trans-activated a
specific viral gene product encoded e2 open reading frame. mutations which
eliminate trans-activation function also dramatic effect on
transformation stable plasmid maintenance.
