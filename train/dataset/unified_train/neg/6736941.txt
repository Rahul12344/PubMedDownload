live attenuated mumps virus vaccine formalin-inactivated mumps vaccine were
compared ability induce antibody responses cell-mediated immune 
responses measured lymphocyte blast transformation test (lbt). the
subjects studied conscripts finnish defense forces. seronegative
subjects antibody levels induced attenuated virus variable than
those induced inactivated virus, including one failure live vaccine
out total nine subjects. igm antibody class response seen in
four nine subjects vaccinated live virus--in subjects the
highest post-vaccination antibody levels strongest lbt responses. increases
of antibody levels originally seropositive subjects higher subjects
vaccinated inactivated virus. cell-mediated immunity induced both
vaccines relatively poor measured lbt test. time 6-8
months vaccination, lbt responses originally seronegative subjects 
not observed.
