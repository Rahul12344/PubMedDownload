a bacterial mutation blocking p2 phage late gene expression.

sunshine mg, sauer b.

a mutant escherichia coli strain c isolated, called gro109, that
blocks bacteriophage p2 propagation interfering late gene expression. dna
replication proceeds normally p2+-infected gro109 cells, late phage
proteins made. early p2 mrna made normal amounts, little
late mrna detected. p2 mutants (p2 ogr) able overcome gro109 block 
have isolated synthesis late p2 mrna phage proteins is
restored. gro109 mutation closely linked cluster ribosomal genes
at 64 min recessive wild-type (gro+) allele. p2 ogr mutation 
been mapped left arm p2 genome, right-most known late
gene (d) phage attachment site. p2 ogr complement p2+ gro109
cells, indicating ogr codes diffusible product.
