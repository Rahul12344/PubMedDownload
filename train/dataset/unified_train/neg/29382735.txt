receptor-mediated endocytosis cellular process commonly hijacked viruses 
to enter cells. stages entry well described certain viruses, but
the host factors mediate step less well characterized. we
previously identified endosomal cation channel mucolipin-2 (mcoln2) host
factor promotes viral infection. here, assign role mcoln2 in
modulating viral entry. show mcoln2 specifically promotes viral vesicular
trafficking subsequent escape endosomal compartments. mechanism
requires channel activity, occurs independently antiviral signaling, and
broadly applies enveloped rna viruses require transport late endosomes
for infection, including influenza virus, yellow fever virus, zika virus.
we identify rare allelic variant human mcoln2 a
loss-of-function phenotype respect viral enhancement. findings
establish mechanistic link endosomal cation channel late stages 
of viral entry.importance viruses must co-opt cellular processes complete
their life cycle. enter cells, viruses frequently take advantage cellular
receptor-mediated endocytosis pathways. growing number host proteins are
implicated viral uptake pathways. here, describe new role the
gated cation channel mcoln2 viral entry. endosomal protein modulates
viral entry enhancing efficiency viral trafficking the
endosomal system. thus, mcoln2-mediated enhancement infection may represent 
key vulnerability viral life cycle could targeted therapeutic 
intervention.
