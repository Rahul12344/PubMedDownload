the interaction human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) gag protein the
plasma membrane cell critical event assembly hiv particles.
the matrix protein region (ma) hiv type 1 (hiv-1) pr55gag previously 
demonstrated confer membrane-binding properties precursor polyprotein. 
both myristic acid moiety additional determinants within essential
for plasma membrane binding subsequent particle formation. study, 
demonstrated myristylation-dependent membrane interaction vivo
membrane-binding assay. expressed within mammalian cells, found 
in association cellular membranes membrane-free form. contrast, 
the intact precursor pr55gag molecule analyzed identical manner found
almost exclusively bound membranes. membrane-bound membrane-free
forms myristylated phosphorylated. differential membrane binding
was due formation multimers, dimeric trimeric forms ma
were also found membrane-bound membrane-free fractions. define the
requirements membrane binding ma, analyzed membrane binding a
series deletion mutants. surprisingly, deletions within alpha-helical
regions forming globular head led dramatic increase overall
membrane binding. stability ma-membrane interaction affected
by deletions, deletion eliminated membrane binding molecule. 
these results establish myristic acid primary determinant the
stability gag protein-membrane interaction provide support the
hypothesis significant proportion hiv-1 molecules may adopt a
conformation myristic acid hidden unavailable membrane
interaction.
