despite high degree hiv-1 protease reverse transcriptase (rt) mutation
in setting antiretroviral therapy, spectrum possible virus variants
appears limited patterns amino acid covariation. analyzed patterns
of amino acid covariation protease rt sequences 7,000
persons infected hiv-1 subtype b viruses obtained stanford hiv drug
resistance database (http://hivdb.stanford.edu). addition, examined the
relationship conditional probabilities associated pair of
mutations order mutations developed viruses which
longitudinal sequence data available. patterns rt covariation were
dominated distinct clustering type type ii thymidine analog
mutations q151m-associated mutations. patterns protease covariation
were dominated clustering nelfinavir-associated mutations (d30n and
n88d), two main groups protease inhibitor (pi)-resistance mutations associated
either v82a l90m, tight cluster mutations associated with
decreased susceptibility amprenavir recently approved pi
darunavir. different patterns covariation frequently observed for
different mutations position including rt mutations t69d versus
t69n, l74v versus l74i, v75i versus v75m, t215f versus t215y, k219q/e versus 
k219n/r, protease mutations m46i versus m46l, i54v versus i54m/l, and
n88d versus n88s. sequence data persons correlated mutations whom
earlier sequences available confirmed conditional probabilities
associated correlated mutation pairs could used predict order in
which mutations likely developed. whereas accessory nucleoside
rt inhibitor-resistance mutations nearly always follow primary nucleoside rt
inhibitor-resistance mutations, accessory pi-resistance mutations often preceded 
primary pi-resistance mutations.
