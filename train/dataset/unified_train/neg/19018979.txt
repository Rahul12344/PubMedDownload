background: liver stiffness measurement (lsm) using fibroscan accepted a
highly reproducible accurate technique assessment liver fibrosis.
however, several studies indicated lsm value significantly
influenced major changes aminotransferases patients chronic viral
hepatitis lsm unreliable diagnosing underlying liver cirrhosis in
patients acute liver damage. aimed determine biochemical factors
influencing lsm value patients acute hepatitis.
methods: july december 2007, total 60 patients acute hepatitis 
of varying aetiologies recruited prospectively. lsm biochemical tests
were performed diagnosis recovery acute hepatitis.
results: mean age patients (38 men 22 women) 40.7+/-15.4
years. aetiology acute hepatitis included hepatitis virus 31
patients, drug induced 19 hepatitis b virus 10. mean lsm value 
19.6 kpa diagnosis 15.9 kpa recovery. correlation analysis showed 
the lsm value diagnosis significantly associated platelet count
(p=0.023), alanine aminotransferase (p=0.045), albumin (p<0.001), total bilirubin
(p=0.004) prothrombin time (p=0.005). however, additional correlation
analysis changes lsm value biochemical factors diagnosis 
to recovery showed change total bilirubin found only
factor associated change lsm value (p<0.001).
conclusions: data suggest lsm value might influenced serum
total bilirubin patients acute hepatitis without pre-existing underlying 
chronic liver disease.
