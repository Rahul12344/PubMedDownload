induction antitumor immunity involves presence cd8(+) ctls and
cd4(+) th cells specific tumor-associated ags. attempts eradicate cancer
by adoptive cell transfer limited due difficulty generating
t cells defined ag specificity. current study focuses generation 
of ctl th cells tumor-associated ag her2 using autologous
dendritic cells (dc) derived cd34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells which
have retrovirally transduced human epidermal growth factor receptor
2 (her2) gene. her2-transduced dc elicited her2-specific cd8(+) ctl lyse
her2-overexpressing tumor cells context distinct hla class alleles. the
induction hla-a2 -a3-restricted her2-specific ctl verified a
clonal level. addition, retrovirally transduced dc induced cd4(+) th1 cells
recognizing her2 context hla class ii. hla-dr-restricted cd4(+) cells
were cloned released ifn-gamma upon stimulation dc pulsed the
recombinant protein extracellular domain her2. data indicate that
retrovirally transduced dc expressing her2 molecule present multiple peptide 
epitopes subsequently elicit her2-specific ctl th1 cells. method of
stimulating her2-specific cd8(+) cd4(+) cells retrovirally transduced 
dc successfully implemented generating her2-specific ctl th1 clones
from patient her2-overexpressing breast cancer. ability generate
and expand her2-specific, hla-restricted ctl th1 clones vitro facilitates 
the development immunotherapy regimens, particular adoptive transfer of
both autologous her2-specific cell clones patients her2-overexpressing 
tumors without requirement defining immunogenic peptides.
