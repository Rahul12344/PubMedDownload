antiviral drugs alone unsuccessful treatment epstein-barr
virus (ebv)-associated malignancies virus maintains latent state of
replication tumors. recent years, novel therapeutic approaches are
being investigated wherein lytic replication virus induced prior the
use cytotoxic antiviral drugs. choice suitable agents induce lytic
replication critical step novel approach. previously
demonstrated butyrate derivatives induce lytic pattern ebv gene
expression patient-derived ebv-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines and,
together nucleoside analogue ganciclovir, effectively reduce eliminate
tumor growth humans. butyrate drawbacks therapeutic agent, however,
as constant intravenous infusion required achieve detectable plasma levels 
of drug. study, investigated whether discontinuous exposure to
butyrate capable initiating lytic phase gene expression thymidine
kinase induction, sensitizing ebv-positive lymphoma cells to
ganciclovir-mediated cell growth arrest apoptosis. demonstrate that
multiple daily 6-h exposures ebv-positive burkitt's lymphoma cell line
p3hr1 butyrate induced sustained expression ebv lytic phase protein
bmrf. viral thymidine kinase also induced intermittent exposure, although 
to lower level continuous exposure treatment. however, discontinuous 
exposure butyrate combination ganciclovir induced similar level of
tumor cell growth inhibition continuous treatment, measured serial
enumeration viable cells, mtt cell proliferation assays measurement of
cellular dna content. demonstrated cells survived
initial exposure butyrate plus ganciclovir remained susceptible further
cycles combination treatment. findings suggests continuous infusion
of butyrate may necessary maintaining viral thymidine kinase gene
expression sensitization antiviral agents ebv-associated tumors, and
that therapeutic regimens employ convenient, discontinuous exposure to
butyrate may also effective clinically.
