to evaluate potential impact strongly neurotropic virus matricial
fibronectin (fn) given neural cell type, first subculture rat astrocytes 
were inoculated either low (0.1-0.5) high moi (10-100) herpes
simplex virus-type 1 (hsv-1). infected samples, well matched controls, were
harvested 12 72 h post-inoculation processed extracellular fn
labeling peroxidase-antiperoxidase (pap) method. following low moi,
multinucleated cell formation syncytial development drastically modified
peripheral fn, since typical loose network largely replaced a
patch-like appearance. high moi, viral action caused cytoplasmic 
retraction leading rounded stellate cells, fn pattern remarkably
altered, even total fn loss around highly retracted cells. may be
concluded virus hsv-1, capable modifying astrocyte morphology, 
induces redistribution loss pericellular fn.
