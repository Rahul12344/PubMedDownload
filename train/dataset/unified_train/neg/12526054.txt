ebv infects global population, small percentage of
infected individuals develop ebv-associated malignancies. host viral factors 
may play role determining clinical outcome. ebna-1 functions 
an orip binding protein links episomal viral dna metaphase
chromosomes, variation ebna-1 suggested contribute determining 
the tissue tropism ebv development various ebv-associated diseases.
five subtypes described, according amino acid residue 487:
p-ala (b95-8 prototype), p-thr (aa 487 ala thr), v-val, v-pro v-leu. other
studies, however, concluded ebna-1 sequence variation simply reflects the
geographical distribution ebv. clarify possibilities, collected
dna samples healthy individuals patients various ebv-associated
diseases taiwan pcr amplification dna sequencing. results indicate
that: 1) v-val ebna-1 detected patients nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(npc) ebv-associated malignant diseases; 2) prototype p-ala strain 
was detected peripheral blood lymphocytes; 3) mixed populations of
different subtypes n-terminal c-terminal sequences observed in
samples one patient nasopharyngeal carcinoma, one lymphoma and
one infectious mononucleosis sample; 4) intermediate variations between
p-ala v-val observed t-lymphoma, hodgkin disease infectious
mononucleosis samples; 5) comparison major sequences identified
in healthy carriers, ebna-1 sequences peripheral lymphocytes from
nasopharyngeal carcinoma mixed types 4 5 patients, implying increasing
frequency v-val might correlate progression nasopharyngeal
carcinoma.
