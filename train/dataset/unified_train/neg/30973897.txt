emerging viruses severe fever thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (sftsv)
and ebola virus (ebov) responsible significant morbidity mortality.
host cell proteases process glycoproteins viruses potential
targets antiviral intervention. aspartyl protease signal peptide
peptidase (spp) recently shown required processing the
glycoprotein precursor, gn/gc, bunyamwera virus viral infectivity.
here, investigated whether spp also required infectivity particles
bearing sftsv-gn/gc. entry driven ebov glycoprotein (gp) lassa
virus glycoprotein (lasv-gpc) depends cysteine proteases cathepsin b l
(catb/catl) serine protease subtilisin/kexin-isozyme 1 (ski-1),
respectively, examined parallel control purposes. found that
inhibition spp ski-1 interfere sftsv gn + gc-driven entry
but, unexpectedly, blocked entry mediated ebov-gp. inhibition occurred 
the stage proteolytic activation spp inhibitor found block
catl/catb activity. contrast, ski-1 inhibitor interfere with
catb/catl activity disrupted catb localization endo/lysosomes, site of
ebov-gp processing. results underline potential protease inhibitors 
for antiviral therapy also show previously characterized compounds might
exert broader specificity initially appreciated might block viral entry 
via diverse mechanisms.
