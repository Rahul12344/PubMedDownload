in effort validate previous research suggesting remarkable resistance of
norovirus free chlorine disinfection, characterized disinfection
response purified dispersed norwalk virus (nv) bench-scale free
chlorine disinfection using rt-pcr virus assays. inactivation nv by
two doses free chlorine (1 5mg/l) ph 6 5 degrees c based two
rt-pcr assays similar coliphage ms2, much faster 
poliovirus 1. despite underestimation virus inactivation rt-pcr assays,
the predicted ct values nv based rt-pcr assays lower ones for
most important waterborne viruses ct guidelines chlorine
disinfection viruses surface water treatment rule united
states environmental protection agency. overall, results study
indicate nv highly resistant free chlorine disinfection as
suggested previous research likely nv contamination drinking
water controlled adequate free chlorine disinfection practices with
provision proper pre-treatment processes chlorination.
