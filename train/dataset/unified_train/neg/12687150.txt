immunological interrelations one important factors, forming all
the periods ontogenetic body development. early ontogenesis organism
of mammals, including humans, immunological tolerance induced own
(self) antigens prevents development autoimmune reactions adult
life. system immune recognition reaches fine discriminative capacity
in mammals humans background recognition self hla class (ctl
of cd8(+) phenotype) class ii (t helpers cd4(+) phenotype). phenomenon 
of major histocompatibility complex (mhc) restriction reactivity cytotoxic t
lymphocytes (ctl) makes difficult recognition changes mutations hla 
system. natural killers (nk) control constantly structure self mhc class i
molecules, contrast ctl may recognize small antigenic changes mhc
molecules, induced viruses, mutations transformation. immune system aging 
is displayed quantitative, functional changes lymphocyte
subpopulations prevalence helpers type 2 type 1 cells, responsible
for development dth. according immunological theory aging, role 
of immune system cells taken consideration relation the
synthesis activated oxygen forms bactericidal properties monocytes and
neutrophils. overproduction activated oxygen radicals may result in
destruction proteins, lipids, dna, body aging. activated oxygen
radicals one events lymphocyte apoptosis aerobic conditions.
