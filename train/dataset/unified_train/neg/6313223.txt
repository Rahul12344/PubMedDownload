rnp template vesicular stomatitis virus regulates transcription and
replication functions.

perrault j, clinton gm, mcclure ma.

small leader rnas, copied extreme 3' ends minus plus strands 
of vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) genome, thought play central
role regulation viral transcription replication. describe a
novel class vsv mutants, denoted pol r, termination leader sites
in vitro specifically suppressed. assayed presence leader
rnas readthrough transcripts reaction products standard virion
templates (plus leader) defective interfering particle templates (minus
leader). cases, mutant virions gave rise much higher proportion of
readthrough transcripts wild type (greater 80% vs approximately 10%).
reconstitution experiments separated ribonucleoprotein (rnp) templates and
polymerase protein fractions revealed, surprisingly, n protein moiety of
the rnp template responsible readthrough. conclusion further
supported protein analyses showed similar charge change n
protein two independently isolated pol r vsv mutants. results lead us to
propose modification n protein may regulate termination leader rna
sites.
