objective: construct display keratinocyte growth factor (kgf) phage
active peptides detect promoting effects epidermal cell.
methods: kgf sequences chosen primers designed. selected 
genes p1, p2 p4 obtained reverse transcription (rt)-pcr. p3 was
obtained direct synthesis. kgf genes subcloned pcomb3
vector. technique phage display employed display genes phage
surface. methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (mtt) assay used evaluate the
promoting effects kgf phage active peptides proliferation epidermal 
cell. optical density (a) determined 570 nm. immunofluorescent assay was
employed evaluate cell affinity kgf phage active peptides.
results: four kgf genes obtained subcloned pcomb3 vector. the
proteins kgf genes expressed surface pcomb3 vector. the
mtt data optical density (a) showed significant differences existed
between negative control kgf control (0.293 ± 0.017 vs 0.520 ± 0.043) and
kgf phage active peptide groups (0.293 ± 0.017 vs 0.469 ± 0.057, 0.441 ± 0.048,
0.438 ± 0.035, 0.446 ± 0.037) (all p < 0.01). results immunofluorescent
assay indicated kgf kgf phage active peptides excellent cell
affinity.
conclusion: kgf phage active peptides successfully constructed displayed 
and may promote proliferation epidermal cell.
