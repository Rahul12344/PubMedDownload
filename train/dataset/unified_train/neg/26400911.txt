in immunocompromised individuals, jc polyomavirus (jcpyv) may mutate gain
access central nervous system resulting progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy (pml), often fatal opportunistic infection no
treatments currently available. despite recent progress, contribution 
jcpyv-specific humoral immunity controlling asymptomatic infection throughout 
life eliminating jcpyv brain poorly understood. examined
antibody responses jcpyv major capsid protein vp1 (viral protein 1)
variants serum cerebrospinal fluid (csf) healthy donors (hds),
jcpyv-positive multiple sclerosis patients treated anti-vla-4 monoclonal
antibody natalizumab (nat), patients nat-associated pml. and
during pml, csf antibody responses jcpyv vp1 variants show "recognition
holes"; however, upon immune reconstitution, csf antibody titers rise, then
recognize pml-associated jcpyv vp1 variants, may involved elimination
of virus. therefore reasoned memory b cell repertoire of
individuals recovered pml could source molecular cloning of
broadly neutralizing antibodies passive immunization. generated series
of memory b cell-derived jcpyv vp1-specific human monoclonal antibodies hds 
and patient nat-associated pml-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome
(iris). antibodies exhibited diverse binding affinity, cross-reactivity
with closely related bk polyomavirus, recognition pml-causing vp1
variants, jcpyv neutralization. almost antibodies exquisite
specificity jcpyv, neutralizing activity, recognition tested jcpyv pml
variants, high affinity derived one patient recovered 
pml. antibodies promising drug candidates development a
