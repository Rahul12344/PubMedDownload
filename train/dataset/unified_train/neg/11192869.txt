objectives: characterize antiviral response tolerability a
multi-drug rescue therapy (mdrt) among heavily pretreated patients.
methods: observational study conducted single, university-based tertiary
referral clinic. patients (n = 106) failed several prior regimens started
mdrt including least five antiretroviral (arv) drugs august 1997 and
june 1998. common starting regimen included three nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors two protease inhibitors, prescribed 45 
(42.5%) patients. virologic response defined plasma viral load < 400
copies/ml least two consecutive visits.
results: median prior arv exposure seven drugs median time 43
months. fifty-nine percent patients phenotypically (virco
antivirogram) resistant baseline seven arv. median plasma viral
load change following initiation mdrt -1.04 log10 copies/ml median 
of 15 months. using intention-to-treat analysis 40% patients plasma viral 
load values < 400 copies/ml weeks 47 57 follow-up. twenty-six
patients (25%) experienced severe laboratory abnormalities subjective adverse 
drug effects six participants discontinued therapy.
conclusion: mdrt induced substantial antiviral response heavily
pretreated group patients despite extensive phenotypic resistance baseline.
adverse effects frequent generally manageable. data suggest that
relying exclusively historical, clinical laboratory evidence may be
sufficient rule possible antiviral response multiple drug regimens 
are used heavily pretreated patient population.
