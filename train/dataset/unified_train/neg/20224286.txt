background: alpha-synuclein (as) abundant neuronal protein predominantly
localized presynaptic terminals central nervous system. aggregation 
is molecular hallmark several neurodegenerative diseases, including
parkinson's disease, thought play significant role etiology of
the disease. recent experimental evidence indicates exists two forms, 
a membrane-bound form disordered cytosolic form. much effort dedicated
to prevent dissolve aggregates, specifically oligomers and
protofibrils, thought toxic form aggregates.
methods: effect filamentous phages aggregation sh-sy5y cells
overexpressing wild-type quantified elisa designed detect and
quantify oligomers.
results: found reduced levels oligomers membrane fraction in
cells treated filamentous phages compared nontreated cells.
conclusion: reduction oligomers plasma membrane treated
cells may suggest therapeutic application.
