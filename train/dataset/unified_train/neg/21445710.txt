to date, suitable vaccine specific antiviral drug available treat
chikungunya viral (chikv) fever. hence, essential identify drug
candidates could potentially impede chikv infection. here, present the
development homology model nsp2 protein based crystal structure of
the nsp2 protein venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (veev). protein
modeled optimized using molecular dynamics simulation; junction peptides 
of nonstructural protein complex docked order investigate the
possible protein-protein interactions nsp2 proteins cleaved by
nsp2. modeling studies conducted shed light binding modes, the
critical interactions peptides provide insight chemical
features needed inhibit chik virus infection. energy-optimized
pharmacophore mapping performed using junction peptides. based the
results, propose pharmacophore features must present an
inhibitor nsp2 protease. resulting pharmacophore model contained an
aromatic ring, hydrophobic three hydrogen-bond donor sites. using these
pharmacophore features, screened large public library compounds (asinex, 
maybridge, toslab, binding database) find potential ligand could
inhibit nsp2 protein. compounds yielded fitness score than
1.0 subjected glide htvs glide xp. here, report best
four compounds based docking scores; compounds ids 27943, 
21362, asn 01107557 asn 01541696. propose compounds could bind 
to active site nsp2 protease inhibit enzyme. furthermore, the
backbone structural scaffolds four lead compounds could serve as
building blocks designing drug-like molecules treatment of
chikungunya viral fever.
