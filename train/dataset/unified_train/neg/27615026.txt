background: advances therapy hepatitis b virus (hbv) hepatitis c virus
(hcv) ushered new era chronic hepatitis treatment. maximise the
effectiveness medicines, individuals must engaged retained in
care. analysed operational interventions enhance chronic viral hepatitis
testing, linkage care, treatment uptake, adherence, viral suppression or
cure.
methods: systematic review operational interventions, did
meta-analyses sufficiently comparable data. searched pubmed, embase, who
library, international clinical trials registry platform, psycinfo, cinahl
for randomised controlled trials controlled non-randomised studies that
examined operational interventions along chronic viral hepatitis care
continuum, published english dec 31, 2014. included
non-pharmaceutical intervention studies primary secondary outcomes of
testing, linkage care, treatment uptake, treatment adherence, treatment
completion, treatment outcome, viral endpoints. excluded dissertations 
studies children only. data extracted two independent reviewers, 
disagreements resolved third reviewer. studies assessed bias. data 
from similar interventions pooled quality evidence assessed using
grade. study registered prospero (42014015094).
findings: identified 7583 unduplicated studies, included 56 studies that
reported outcomes along care continuum (41 hcv 18 hbv). all
studies except one high-income countries. lay health worker hbv test
promotion interventions increased hbv testing rates (relative risk [rr] 2·68, 95%
ci 1·82-3·93). clinician reminders prompt hcv testing clinical visits
increased hcv testing rates (3·70, 1·81-7·57). nurse-led educational
interventions improved hcv treatment completion (1·14, 1·05-1·23) cure (odds 
ratio [or] 1·93, 95% ci 1·44-2·59). coordinated mental health, substance misuse, 
and hepatitis treatment services increased hcv treatment uptake (or 3·03,
1·24-7·37), adherence (rr 1·22, 1·05-1·41), cure (rr 1·21, 1·07-1·38)
compared usual care.
interpretation: several simple, inexpensive operational interventions can
substantially improve engagement retention along chronic viral hepatitis 
care continuum. operational research inform scale-up hepatitis
services needed low-income middle-income countries.
