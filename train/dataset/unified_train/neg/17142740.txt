pulmonary airways vulnerable infection exposure ag during
respiration. innate, antiviral response must activated rapidly after
pathogen recognition, alveolar macrophages (amphi) play role this
response. tlr3 protein kinase r (pkr) recognize dsrna, replication
intermediate rna viruses, initiate transcription ifn-alphabeta. this
study, synthetic dsrna poly(i:c) used investigate innate responses of
porcine amphi compared responses peritoneal macrophages (pmphi).
poly(i:c) triggered ifn-alphabeta amphi pmphi, levels amphi were
higher. contrast, mrna levels ifn-stimulated genes, mx pkr, were
greater pmphi amphi. low levels mx pkr transcription amphi were
not due deficient type ifn receptor signaling, exogenous ifn-alpha
induced nuclear translocation phosphorylated stat1. investigate the
differential mechanism ifn-alphabeta transcription activated amphi
and pmphi, 2-aminopurine (2-ap) used block dsrna-mediated activation of
pkr. ifn-alphabeta, mx, pkr mrna levels amphi poly(i:c) treatment
were unaffected 2-ap; conversely, transcription ifn-alphabeta, mx, pkr
remained baseline levels pmphi. phosphorylated pkr detected pmphi,
but amphi, poly(i:c) treatment. addition ifn-alphabeta gene
induction, mrna levels tnf-alpha rantes higher amphi pmphi
after poly(i:c) stimulation. summary, differential dsrna-induced cytokine
expression patterns amphi pmphi provide evidence dsrna
recognition subsequent signaling likely mediated via tlr3 amphi pkr
in pmphi.
