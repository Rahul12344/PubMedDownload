background: bone marrow transplantation (bmt) may represent novel mechanism 
deliver functional gene deficient liver. bone marrow-derived hepatocytes
are rare without defined contribution liver function. consequently, 
clinical significance bmt treat liver disease unclear. sought to
quantify bone marrow-derived hepatocyte protein expression bmt and
determine whether process inducible liver injury.
methods: mice transgenic human alpha-1 antitrypsin (haat) a
hepatocyte-specific promoter used bone marrow donors. adenoviral
transduction modified urokinase plasminogen activator (ad-mupa) used to
induce liver injury. eight weeks lethal irradiation bmt, recipients
were stratified two groups: bmt alone (n = 5) bmt + ad-mupa (n= 10).
both groups animals bled (t = 0) 2, 4, 8, 16 weeks
after ad-mupa administration, serum samples assessed haat by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
results: transgenic donor mice expressed 5 10 mg/ml haat. recipients bmt
alone expressed less 80 ng/ml haat time periods. animals
receiving bmt + ad-mupa showed sustained stable haat expression of
approximately 200 ng/ml. differences statistically significant time 
point.
conclusion: serum protein levels liver-specific transgene expression are
detectable persist bmt. expression low, inducible liver
injury. currently developing strategies augment donor-derived,
liver-specific protein expression bmt.
