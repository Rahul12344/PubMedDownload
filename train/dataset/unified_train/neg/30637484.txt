objective: sought develop nomogram prediction tumor recurrence
after resection hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) within milan criteria.
method: consecutive hcc patients admitted hepatectomy 1994 2014
were enrolled study. patients excluded recurrent hcc 
tumors beyond milan criteria. patients randomized assigned the
derivation validation sets 1:1 ratio. independent factors for
disease-free survival identified using cox regression model. nomogram 
was derived validated receiver-operating characteristic (roc) and
calibration curves.
results: 617 eligible patients included analysis. median
age 59 years, 481 male, 87.8% patients hepatitis b virus
carriers. median follow-up 68.7Â months. 5-year overall survival rate 
was 73.3% hcc recurrence detected 55% patients. the
derivation set, nomogram constructed based seven independent factors
for disease-free survival: age, alpha-fetoprotein, preoperative prothrombin time,
magnitude hepatectomy, postoperative complication, number tumor nodules,
and presence microvascular invasion. satisfactory discrimination ability was
observed derivation validation sets (c-stat 0.672 0.665,
respectively). calibration plot yielded agreement predicted and
observed outcomes, using derived nomogram.
conclusion: validated nomogram quantifies risk recurrence after
hepatectomy hcc within milan criteria, assists planning of
individual postoperative surveillance protocols.
