human hepatitis b virus genome encodes protein, termed hbx, widely
recognized transcriptional transactivator. hbx directly bind 
cis-acting transcriptional control elements, shown associate 
cellular proteins bind dna. hbx transactivated large number of
viral/cellular transcriptional control elements, looked targets within
the components basal transcriptional machinery. search led the
identification interactions tfiih. here, show hbx interacts
with yeast mammalian tfiih complexes vitro vivo. these
interactions hbx components tfiih supported several
lines evidence including results immunoprocedures direct methods of
measuring interactions. identified ercc3 ercc2 dna helicase subunits 
of holoenzyme tfiih targets hbx interactions. furthermore, dna helicase
activity purified tfiih rat liver and, individually, ercc2 component 
of tfiih stimulated presence hbx. observations suggest role 
for hbx transcription dna repair.
