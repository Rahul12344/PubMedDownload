replicating recombinant vector vaccines consist fully competent viral vector
backbone engineered express antigen foreign transgene. the
perspective viral replication, transgene dispensable may
even detrimental. thus vaccine revertants delete inactivate the
transgene may evolve dominate vaccine virus population the
process manufacture vaccine well course host
infection. particular concern vaccine evolution could reduce its
antigenicity-the immunity elicited transgene. use mathematical and
computational models study vaccine evolution immunity. models
include evolution arising process manufacture, dynamics of
vaccine revertant growth, plus innate adaptive immunity elicited during
the course infection. although selective basis vaccine evolution is
easy comprehend, immunological consequences not. one complication is
that opportunity vaccine evolution limited short period of
within-host growth viral population cleared. even less obvious,
revertant growth may weakly interfere vaccine growth host and
thus limited effect immunity vaccine. overall, find that
within-host vaccine evolution sometimes compromise vaccine immunity, only
when extent evolution vaccine manufacture severe, this
evolution easily avoided mitigated.
