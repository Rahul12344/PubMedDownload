objectives: tested hypothesis multiple toxic infectious
stressors combine adverse effects produce higher tissue responses 
metallothioneins (mts) birds.
methods: used japanese quails model avian species. study based 
data obtained single combined exposures japanese quails to
cyanobacterial biomass containing microcystins, lead live newcastle disease
vaccination virus. eight groups 5 birds exposed single, double and
triple combinations stressors compared controls. birds were
euthanized 30-day exposure collect brain, liver, kidney, and
pectoral muscle mts measurement.
results: baseline levels mts differed avian tissues. gradient mts in
control quails pectoral muscle < liver < brain < kidney. double triple
exposures induced higher levels mts. increases mts driven mainly
by dietary exposure cyanobacterial biomass and/or lead, newcastle disease
vaccination induced least response. induction brain mts dominated by
exposure lead. patterns mts responses similar liver and
pectoral muscle well kidney brain.
conclusions: understanding better responses birds oxidative stress induced 
by toxic infectious stressors may implications avian conservation
issues disease risk assessment.
