mtv antigens demonstrable radioimmunoassay milk samples from
individual dbaf mice, samples (male balb/c x female dbaf) f1 mice.
although samples collected first lactation periods mice 
were virus-negative, samples later lactation periods virus-positive. 
from 75 mice [ male balb/c x female (male balb/c x female dbaf)]bc i
population, milk samples collected one lactation periods 
tested presence viral antigens; samples 42 mice were
virus-positive. ([balb/c x (balb/c x dbaf)] x balb/c)bc ii population two 
groups distinguished. first group, progeny virus-positive bc i
mothers, 37 62 mice detectable levels viral antigen milk.
none 43 samples mice second group, derived mtv-negative
bc females, virus-positive. data suggest presence viral 
antigens milk dbaf mice controlled single dominant gene;
evidence linkage gene albino locus obtained
(recombination percentage: 20).
