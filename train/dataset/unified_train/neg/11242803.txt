background: transforming growth factor beta-1 (tgf beta 1) suggested 
play role development, growth progression hepatocellular carcinoma
(hcc). genotype serum titer hcv also affect occurrence hcc in
chronic hepatitis c. study, evaluate effects genotype
or serum titer hcv expression tgf beta 1. also intended to
examine correlation up-regulation tgf beta 1 the
association hcc patients chronic hepatitis c.
methods: studied 19 patients chronic hepatitis c 18 hcc
associated hcv infection. hcv genotype determined line probe reverse 
hybridization assay amount hcv-rna quantitated branched dna
signal amplification assay. serum tgf beta 1 level measured enzyme linked 
immunosorbent assay.
results: hcv genotypes patients hcc similar without it.
serum hcv-rna titer higher genotype 1b non-1b (p < 0.05). serum
tgf beta 1 levels higher hcc chronic hepatitis (p < 0.05).
however, significant difference serum tgf beta 1 level
between genotype 1b non-1b. also, correlated serum
hcv-rna titer alanine aminotransferase levels.
conclusion: tgf beta 1 seems overexpressed hcc compared of
chronic hepatitis c: affected serum alt levels, genotype serum
hcv titer. suggested tgf beta 1 may associated malignant
transformation hepatocyte progression hcv-associated hcc.
