myxovirus-resistance (mx) proteins produced host cells response type
i interferons, members mx gene family mammals shown 
to limit replication influenza viruses. according early
report, chicken mx1 variants encoding asn position 631 antiviral
activity, whereas variants ser 631 lack activity experiments
evaluating mx1 complementary dna (cdna) expressed ectopically cell line. 
evaluated whether mx1 631 dimorphism influenced pathogenesis highly
pathogenic avian influenza virus (hpaiv) infection chickens two commercial 
broiler lines, segregating asn631 ser631 variants. following
intranasal infection hpaiv strain a/chicken/queretaro/14588-19/1995 h5n2,
chickens homozygous asn631 allele significantly resistant to
disease based early mortality, morbidity, virus shedding ser631
homozygotes. higher amounts splenic cytokine transcripts observed 
ser631 birds infection, consistent higher viral loads seen this
group perhaps contributing higher morbidity. nucleotide sequence
determination mx1 cdnas demonstrated asn631 variants two
chicken lines differed several amino acid positions outside 631. vitro
experiments different influenza strain (low pathogenicity) failed to
demonstrate effect mx1 asn631 viral replication suggesting vivo 
responses may differ markedly vitro, choice virus strain may
be critical demonstrating effects chicken mx1. overall, studies
provide first evidence mx1 antiviral effects chickens infected
with influenza virus.
