human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) gives rise chronic infection
that progressively depletes cd4(+) lymphocytes. cd4(+) lymphocytes play a
central coordinating role adaptive cellular humoral immune responses, 
to migrate interact within lymphoid compartments effector
sites mount immune responses. cell-free virus serves excellent
prognostic indicator patient survival, interactions infected cells or
virus-scavenging immune cells uninfected cells greatly enhance viral
spread. hiv induce interactions infected uninfected cells 
are triggered cell surface expression viral env, serves cell
adhesion molecule interacts cd4 target cell, acts as
the viral membrane fusion protein. interactions called virological
synapses promote replication face selective pressure humoral
immune responses antiretroviral therapy. infection-enhancing cell-cell 
interactions occur virus-concentrating antigen-presenting cells and
recipient cells, called infectious synapses. exact roles these
cell-cell interactions play stage infection, viral acquisition,
systemic dissemination, chronic persistence still determined.
infection-promoting immune cell interactions likely contribute viral
persistence enhance ability hiv-1 evade adaptive immune responses.
