we investigated influence transient treatment corticosteroid cd8+ 
t cells herpesvirus infection. dexamethasone, synthetic corticosteroid, 
induced apoptosis naïve memory cd8+ cells virus-specific effector
cells spared. cd8+ cell susceptibility directly correlated the
expression nr3c1. α-(hsv1) γ-(mhv68) herpesvirus infection expanded
cd8+ cells regulated nr3c1 indicating corticosteroid-mediated effects were
not limited one pathogen specific clonotype. dexamethasone compromised 
anti-viral immunity subsequent infections, likely reductions the
naïve cell pool. dexamethasone augmented function inflammatory tissue
homing potential effector cells via upregulation cxcr3. accordingly, an
antibody neutralization cxcr3 diminished dexamethasone-induced migration of
cd8+ cells tissues resulting increased virus burden. study therefore 
suggests even transient corticosteroid therapy influences ongoing
cd8+ cell responses well size naïve memory repertoire.
