despite recent advances curative therapy, hepatitis c virus (hcv) still
remains global threat. order achieve global elimination, prophylactic
vaccine considered high priority. previous immunogens used induce
broad neutralising antibodies (bnabs) met limited success. to
improve immunogen design, factors associated early development bnabs 
in natural infection must first understood. study, 43 subjects
identified acute hcv analysed longitudinally using panel of
heterogeneous hcv pseudoparticles (hcvpp), understand emergence bnabs. 
compared infected single genotype, early bnab development was
associated subjects co-infected least 2 hcv subtypes acute
infection. mono-infected, bnabs seen emerge with
increasing viral persistence. subjects acquired secondary infection, nab
breadth seen boost upon viral re-exposure. importantly, data
highlights potential multivalent prime-boost vaccine strategies to
induce bnabs hcv humans. however, data also indicate the
infecting genotype may influence development bnabs. therefore, choice 
of antigen need carefully considered future vaccine trials.
