the capacity bone marrow reconstituted chimeric mice mount sendai virus
specific h-2 restricted well alloreactive cytotoxic t-cell responses has
been investigated. chimeras type leads (a x b)f1 (a x b)f1 leads 
to used. addition chimeras produced (a x b)f1 mice grafted under
the kidney capsula type parental thymus, thymectomised, lethally
irradiated reconstituted either a, (a x b)f1 b type bone marrow cells
were tested. agreement data zinkernagel bevan noted
that virus specific cells semi-allogeneic chimeric mice able to
recognise virus antigens context mhc thymus they
have maturated. unexpected finding fully allogeneic chimeras were
able mount alloreactive ctl h-2 restricted, virus specific ctl. the
h-2 restricted ctl detected preferentially restricted mhc type.
in animals also virus specific ctl restricted allogeneic thymus mhc
type observed. data also presented indicate longterm cultured
bone marrow cells potential repopulate lethally irradiated mice.
