background: bacteriophage could alternative conventional antibiotic
therapy multidrug-resistant bacteria. however, emergence resistant
variants phage treatment limited therapeutic application.
methodology/principal findings: study, approach, named "step-by-step" 
(sbs), established. method takes advantage occurrence of
phage-resistant bacteria variants ensures phages lytic wild-type
strain phage-resistant variants selected. phage cocktail lytic 
klebsiella pneumoniae established sbs method. phage cocktail
consisted three phages (gh-k1, gh-k2 gh-k3) different but
overlapping host strains. several phage-resistant variants klebsiella
pneumoniae isolated different phages treatments. virulence of
these variants much weaker [minimal lethal doses (mld)>1.3×10(9) cfu/mouse]
than wild-type k7 countpart (mld = 2.5×10(3) cfu/mouse). compared with
any single phage, phage cocktail significantly reduced mutation frequency
of klebsiella pneumoniae effectively rescued klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia
in murine k7 strain challenge model. minimal protective dose (mpd) the
phage cocktail sufficient protect bacteremic mice lethal k7
infection 3.0×10(4) pfu, significantly smaller (p<0.01) of
single monophage. moreover, delayed administration phage cocktail was
still effective protection k7 challenge.
conclusions/significance: data showed phage cocktail more
effective reducing bacterial mutation frequency rescue murine
bacteremia monophage suggesting phage cocktail established sbs
method great therapeutic potential multidrug-resistant bacteria
infection.
