attenuation murine coronavirus infection ammonium chloride.

ammonium chloride concentration 20 mm delayed 4-5 hr production of
virus progeny mouse l-2 cells infected high multiplicity mouse
hepatitis virus (mhv). delay seen production both
intracellular extracellular virus. however, final titers similar 
those produced mhv-infected cells maintained normal medium. the
manifestation virus-induced cell fusion similarly found delayed, but
not otherwise decreased severity, ammonium chloride present the
culture medium. ammonium chloride caused similar delays production of
virus-specific, positive-sense rnas viral polypeptides. relative
proportions apparent molecular weights viral rnas polypeptides were
similar found mhv-infected cells cultured normal medium. vitro 
translation endogenously produced viral rnas cell extracts, prepared from
mhv-infected cells, inhibited ammonium chloride. thus, ammonium
chloride specific, inhibitory effect viral protein synthesis. ammonium 
chloride reduce number virus-infected cells culture, as
monitored infectious center assay. analysis early events mhv infection
showed ammonium chloride affect adsorption internalization mhv
by l-2 cells. however, subsequent eclipse phase, monitored decline in
infectivity internalized virus inoculum proceeded less efficiently the
presence ammonium chloride. basis known inhibitory effects of
ammonium chloride lysosomal/endosomal functions, results suggest an
endosomal mechanism mhv uncoating. thus primary effect ammonium
chloride mhv infection l-2 cells attenuate virus uncoating, thereby
chronologically displacing subsequent virus-encoded functions.
