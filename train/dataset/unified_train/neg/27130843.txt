background & aims: universal one-time antibody testing hepatitis c virus
(hcv) infection recommended centers disease control (cdc) and
the united states preventative services task force (uspstf) americans born
1945-1965 (birth cohort). limited data exists addressing national hcv testing
practices. studied patterns predictors hcv testing across u.s.
within birth cohort utilizing data national corporate data warehouse
of u.s. veterans administration (va) health system.
methods: testing defined hcv test including antibody, rna genotype 
performed 2000-2013.
results: 6,669,388 birth cohort veterans, 4,221,135 (63%) received care within
the va 2000-2013 two visits. group, 2,139,935 (51%) had
hcv testing 8.1% hcv antibody 5.4% rna positive. significant variation
in testing observed across centers (range: 7-83%). older, male,
african-americans, established risk factors receiving care urban
centers excellence likely tested. among veterans free other
established risk factors (hiv negative, hbv negative, alt ⩽40u/l, fib-4 ⩽1.45, or
apri <0.5), hcv antibody rna positive 2.8% 0.9%, respectively,
comparable established national average. least 2.4-4.4% veterans had
scores suggesting advanced fibrosis (apri ⩾1.5 fib-4 >3.25) >30-43%
having positive hcv rna >16-20% yet undergo testing hcv.
conclusions: significant disparities observed hcv testing within the
united states va health system. examination predictors testing hcv 
positivity may help inform national screening policies.
lay summary: analysis united states veterans administration data show
significant disparities hepatitis c virus testing veterans born 1945-1965
(birth cohort). fifth tested evidence advanced liver
fibrosis. data suggests predictors disparity will
potentially help inform future policy measures era universal birth
cohort testing hcv.
