heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) attracted great attention recently hypoxia
injury close link recovery hypoxic-ischemic damage in
organs. however, cellular mechanism underlying protective roles remains
unclear. study, developed recombinant adenovirus containing
hsp70-gfp (vad-hsp70-gfp) studied effect virus-mediated expression 
exogenous hsp70 gene neurons response hypoxia-reoxygenation injury.
virus-mediated expression hsp70 detected early 24 hr lasted
until 10 days infection. neurons 48 hr vad-hsp70-gfp infection were
exposed 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 hr hypoxia followed 1 hr reoxygenation. the
mrna protein levels hsp70 neurons exposed different lengths of
hypoxia compared using rt-pcr western blotting (wb). 1-hr hypoxia
exposure showed significant increases hsp70 mrna protein
level compared exposure durations. mtt assay showed hsp70
overexpression significantly increased neuronal viability, accompanied by
decreased lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) activity culture medium after
hypoxia-reoxygenation. neurons vad-hsp70-gfp exhibited increased levels of
mitochondrial cytochrome c (cyt-c) decreased levels cytoplasmic cyt-c
compared vad-gfp-infected cells. results suggest neuroprotective
role exogenous hsp70 hypoxia-reoxygenation injury, possibly via
preventing initiation mitochondrial apoptosis.
