chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection frequently leads end-stage liver
diseases extrahepatic complications. combination therapy with
interferon-alpha (ifn-alpha) ribavirin recommended first-line
therapy patients chronic hepatitis c adults. however, benefit 
such combination therapy children hepatitis c still under
investigation. report 6-year-old boy admitted chronic active
hepatitis c infection treated interferon-alpha ribavirin. after
treatment 12 months, serum showed negative hcv rna, normal alanine
aminotransferase, sustained response. patient's serum soluble
cd30 (scd30) level higher controls (>100 u/ml vs 46 +/- 11 u/ml)
before combination therapy difference soluble cd26 (scd26)
[103 ng/ml vs 119 +/- 28 ng/ml]. scd30 decreased scd26 increased 6
months (45 u/ml 188.3 ng/ml, respectively) using combined therapy well 
at 4 months discontinuing (33 u/ml 167.8 ng/ml, respectively) our
patient. results indicate combined treatment ifn-alpha and
ribavirin may used first-line treatment children chronic
hepatitis c. changes scd30 scd26 may helpful estimating hcv
infection activity.
