objective: investigate presence human herpesvirus 8 (hhv-8) lesional
skin german patients large-plaque parapsoriasis (lpp) mycosis
fungoides (mf). pathogenetic relevance hhv-8 cutaneous t-cell lymphoma 
is controversial. recently, highly significant association hhv-8 lpp 
found, suggests role pathogenesis disease.
design: retrospective study presence hhv-8 german patients with
lymphoproliferative diseases.
setting: dermatologic clinic university hospital ruhr university
bochum, bochum, germany.
patients: fifty-three patients treated lymphoproliferative skin diseases were
included study, including 14 patients lpp, 31 different stages
of mf, 8 lymphomatoid papulosis (lyp). twenty-three patients kaposi
sarcoma (ks) made positive control group, 10 patients atopic
dermatitis served negative controls.
main outcome measures: presence hhv-8 analyzed paraffin-embedded 
lesional tissue samples using nested polymerase chain reaction open
reading frame (orf) 26 immunohistochemical staining the
latency-associated nuclear antigen (lana) encoded orf 73.
results: high association hhv-8 infection lymphoproliferative skin
diseases observed: 87% lpp 70% mf tissue samples tested positive
for hhv-8 dna orf 26. however, hhv-8 detectable lpp mf by
using immunohistochemical marker lana.
conclusions: virus unambiguously associated ks, hhv-8 frequently
detected low amounts lpp mf specimens. however, based methods of
hhv-8 detection used study, conclusion drawn etiologic
and pathogenetic role hhv-8 diseases.
