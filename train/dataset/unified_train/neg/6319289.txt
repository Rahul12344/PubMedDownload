nine human rotavirus strains stools infants gastroenteritis were
serially propagated ma-104 cell cultures. strains identified as
subgroup 2 rotaviruses rna gel electrophoresis, complement fixation, and
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. human rotavirus strains propagated
for 15 20 passages used immunization guinea pigs rabbits. 
animal antisera also raised subgroup 1 human strain purified 
stools cell culture-adapted wa strain, reference subgroup 2
rotavirus human origin. cross-neutralization studies revealed existence of
two distinct serotypes within cell culture-adapted subgroup 2 human
rotaviruses: strains related unrelated strain wa classified as
serotypes 1 3, respectively. results convalescent-phase sera from
infants primary rotavirus infections confirmed existence two
serotypes within subgroup 2, serotypes responsible primary subgroup 2
infections could determined basis neutralizing reactivity of
convalescent sera.
