oncolytic viral therapy attractive novel strategy cancer therapy. 
natural alphavirus, oncolytic virus m1 able infect kill various zinc
finger antiviral protein (zap)-deficient tumor cells selectively, leaving
normal cells undamaged. however, m1 trigger production neutralizing
antibodies dramatically weaken antitumor effect. order attenuate
immunogenicity therapeutic m1 virus, encapsulated liposomes
(referred m-lpo) using thin-film hydration method. effect of
anti-m1 neutralizing antibody m-lpo examined lovo hep 3b cell
lines. absence neutralizing antibodies, treating cells naked m1,
blank liposomes (lpo), m-lpo, simple mixture m1 liposomes (lpo+m1)
inhibited cell growth. presence neutralizing antibodies, m-lpo
inhibited cell growth. intravenous administration, m-lpo reduced the
production m1-neutralizing antibody corresponding immune response.
analysis m-lpo uptake cells examined confocal microscopy using
m1 labeled fitc liposomal shells labeled rhb. results suggest
that m1 may released liposomes m-lpo internalization.
taken together, results suggest encapsulating oncolytic virus m1 in
liposomes may reduce intrinsic viral immunogenicity improved anticancer
therapy.
