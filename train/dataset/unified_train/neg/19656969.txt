the innate immune response critical host defence respiratory
coronaviruses (covs). study demonstrated ongoing respiratory virus
infection compromises innate immune responses affects pathogenesis a
respiratory cov co-infection. innate immunosuppressive respiratory virus
infection established infecting weaned pigs porcine reproductive 
respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv); 10 days later, pigs exposed to
porcine respiratory coronavirus (prcv). prrsv/prcv dual-infected pigs had
reduced weight gains, higher incidence fever severe pneumonia
compared either single infection. significant suppression innate immune
responses [reduced alpha interferon (ifn-alpha) levels lungs reduced
blood natural killer cell cytotoxicity] ongoing prrsv infection was
observed dual-infected pigs, coincided exacerbated pneumonia during
early prcv infection. subsequent prcv infection led enhanced prrsv
replication lungs trend towards increased serum t-helper type 1
(th1) (ifn-gamma) decreased th2 [interleukin (il)-4] responses, further
exacerbating prrsv pneumonia. following prcv infection, severe prrsv-related
pulmonary alveolar macrophage (pam) apoptosis occurred, determined in
situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dutp nick end labelling
assay, suggesting increased prrsv replication pams. collectively, these
observations suggest interactive effects prcv prrsv via early innate 
(ifn-alpha) later adaptive th1 (ifn-gamma) th2 (il-4) immune responses.
these findings imply existing immunomodulating respiratory viral
co-infection may contributing factor severe pneumonia respiratory
cov disease. study provides new insights host-pathogen interactions
