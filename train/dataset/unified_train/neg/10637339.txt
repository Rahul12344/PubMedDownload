the sequence specificity '10-23' rna-cleaving dna enzyme (deoxyribozyme)
was utilised discriminate subtle differences nucleic acid sequence 
in relatively conserved segment l1 gene number different human
papilloma virus (hpv) genotypes. dna enzymes specific different hpv types
were found cleave respective target oligoribonucleotide substrates 
high efficiency compared unmatched counterparts, usually
not cleaved cleaved low efficiency. specificity achieved
despite existence small differences sequence one
binding arm. example methodology may applied mutation
analysis tissue samples, type-specific deoxyribozyme cleavable substrates were
generated genomic pcr using chimeric primer containing three bases rna.
the rna component enabled amplicon cleavable presence its
matching deoxyribozyme. format, specificity deoxyribozyme cleavage
is defined watson-crick interactions one substrate-binding domain (arm
i) polymorphic sequence amplified pcr.
deoxy-ribozyme-mediated cleavage amplicons generated method used
to examine hpv status genomic dna derived caski cells, are
known positive hpv16. method applicable many types of
nucleic acid sequence variation, including single nucleotide polymorphisms.
