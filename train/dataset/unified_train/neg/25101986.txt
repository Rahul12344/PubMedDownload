error metabolism, characterized high levels glycine, epilepsy,
spasticity, cognitive impairment, admitted emergency department
with respiratory failure days fever cough. boy was
unconscious admittance acute renal hepatic failure.due the

patient status epilepticus.the patient intubated mechanically
