gene therapy duchenne muscular dystrophy require methods deliver gene
constructs encoding functional versions dystrophin vast majority a
patient's musculature. obstacles achieving goals include identifying
which forms dystrophin would effective clinical setting developing
gene delivery shuttles capable carrying expressing dystrophin cassettes
without toxic adverse immunologic consequences. review recent work
from laboratory identify sequences within dystrophin required 
prevent development dystrophic changes muscle might able to
correct pre-existing damage. also describe work aimed developing viral
shuttle vectors able carry express dystrophin cassettes high
levels muscle-specific fashion. great challenges remain in
developing methods systemic gene delivery, show variety viral
vectors able carry express therapeutic levels dystrophin when
delivered directly mouse skeletal muscle.
