we retrospectively studied 89 patients chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv)
infection, including 50 chronic hepatitis (ch) cases, 18 liver cirrhosis (lc)
cases, 21 lc hepatocellular carcinoma (lc + hcc) cases, regard to
various factors related thrombocytopenia. platelet count decreased 
the stage advancement liver diseases. multiple regression analysis revealed
that splenomegaly von willebrand factor (vwf) explanatory variables that
correlated thrombocytopenia. splenomegaly appears responsible
factor, although considerable number thrombocytopenic cases
without splenomegaly, suggesting factors may also responsible. vwf
level inversely correlated platelet count. soluble thrombomodulin, 
marker endothelial dysfunction, increases advancement liver
fibrosis. positively correlated vwf inversely platelet
count. present results imply vascular endothelial dysfunction also
involved thrombocytopenia chronic hcv infection.
