multiple sclerosis (ms) autoimmune disease associated abnormal
expression subset cytokines, resulting inappropriate t-lymphocyte
activation uncontrolled immune response. key issue field need
to understand cytokines transcriptionally activated the
patients. here, examined several transcription units subject to
pathological reactivation ms, including tnfα il8 cytokine genes and
also several human endogenous retroviruses (hervs). find immune 
genes hervs require heterochromatin protein hp1α their
transcriptional repression. show peptidylarginine deiminase 4
(padi4), enzyme suspected role ms, weakens binding hp1α to
tri-methylated histone h3 lysine 9 citrullinating histone h3 arginine 8. the
resulting de-repression cytokines hervs reversed the
padi-inhibitor cl-amidine. finally, show peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (pbmcs) ms patients, promoters tnfα, several hervs share 
deficit hp1α recruitment augmented accumulation histone h3 a
double citrulline 8 tri-methyl lysine 9 modifications. thus, study provides
compelling evidence hp1α padi4 regulators immune genes and
hervs, multiple events transcriptional reactivation ms patients
can explained deficiency single mechanism gene silencing.
