because increasing emphasis placed upon land application means of
wastewater disposal, important evaluate influences different
factors upon virus survival soil. objective study measure
the effects various environmental variables virus persistence. test samples
of soil placed vials, soil wetted suspensions virus
in either distilled water, unchlorinated secondary sewage effluent, mixtures
of effluent water. viruses used coxsackieviruses a9 b3,
echovirus 1, poliovirus 2, rotavirus sa11, bacteriophages t2 ms2. the
rate virus inactivation evaluated statistically regard conditions 
under vials incubated soil characteristics. factors
that found influence virus survival temperature, soil moisture
content, presence aerobic microorganisms, degree virus adsorption the
soil, soil levels resin-extractable phosphorus, exchangeable aluminium, and
soil ph. overall, temperature virus adsorption soil appeared the
most important factors affecting virus survival.
