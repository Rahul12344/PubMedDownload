vaccinia virus (vacv) poxvirus, vacv d4 protein serves a
uracil-dna glycosylase essential component required processive dna 
synthesis. vacv a20 protein known catalytic function but
associates d4 form d4-a20 heterodimer functions poxvirus 
dna processivity factor. heterodimer enables dna polymerase to
efficiently synthesize extended strands dna. upon characterizing the
interaction d4 a20, observed c terminus d4 is
susceptible perturbation. analysis demonstrated conserved
hexapeptide stretch extreme c terminus d4 essential maintaining 
protein integrity, assessed requirement production soluble
recombinant protein functional processive dna synthesis. the
known crystal structures d4, c-terminal hexapeptide shown make
intramolecular contact residues spanning inner core protein. 
mutational analysis revealed tripeptide motif (215gfi217) within the
hexapeptide comprises apparent residues necessary contact. prediction 
protein disorder identified hexapeptide several regions upstream of
gly215 comprise residues interface surfaces d4-a20
heterodimer. study suggests 215gfi217 anchors potentially dynamic 
upstream regions protein maintain protein integrity. unlike uracil-dna 
glycosylases diverse sources, c termini disordered 
form comparable intramolecular contacts, feature may unique to
orthopoxviruses.
