alzheimer's disease (ad) common devastating neurodegenerative disease in
which cases unknown, sporadic origin. addition age, most
prevalent known risk factor developing ad carriage epsilon4 allele 
of apolipoprotein e (apoe). carriage epsilon2 epsilon3 allele apoe
confers protection change risk ad, respectively. latent herpes
simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) infection brain concurrent apoe4
carriage exacerbates risk ad, suggesting two factors interact to
promote neuronal dysfunction degeneration selective brain areas. indeed,
hsv-1 dna found regions primarily affected ad, the
temporal lobes, hippocampus, neocortex. hypothesize hsv-1 infection
in background apoe4, apoe2 apoe3, promotes environment 
conducive neuronal degeneration. investigate idea, utilized
transgenic mice express human apoe2, 3, 4 alleles astrocytes a
murine apoe -/- background. find carriage different apoe alleles
dramatically affects hsv-1 immediate early gene expression well the
establishment latency. factors poised impact neuronal
viability, inflammation, viral spread. data support concept that
hsv-1 apoe4 interact provide environment conducive development
and/or spread ad.
