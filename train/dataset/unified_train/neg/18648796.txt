climate change west nile fever (wnv) subjects global importance. 
many mosquitoes diseases carry, including west nile virus (wnv), are
sensitive temperature increase. current study analyzes lag
correlations weather conditions (especially air temperature) 1) culex
pipiens mosquito population abundance, 2) wnf frequency humans, between
2001 2005 israel. 5 years follow long period documented
tendency temperature increase hot season country. monthly
anomalies minimum maximum temperatures, relative seasonal rainfall
contribution, mosquito samplings (hazard level), wnf cases (hospital
admission dates patients' addresses) analyzed. logistic regression was
calculated climatic data mosquito samples, spearman
correlations pearson cross-correlations calculated daily
temperature values (or daily precipitation amounts) hospital admission
dates. found disease appearance reflects population
distribution, risk tends escalate around metropolis
characterized urban heat island. positive anomalies temperature
during study period appear facilitated mosquito abundance and,
consequently, disease emergence humans. important finding the
potential influence extreme heat early spring vector population 
increase disease's appearance weeks later. awareness such
situations beginning spring may help authorities reduce the
disease risk becomes real danger.
