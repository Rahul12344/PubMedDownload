cellular motility important biological process unicellular and
multicellular organisms. essential movement unicellular organisms
towards source nutrients away unsuitable conditions, well in
multicellular organisms tissue development, immune surveillance wound
healing, mention roles(1,2,3). deregulation process can
lead serious neurological, cardiovascular immunological diseases, well 
as exacerbated tumor formation spread(4,5). molecularly, actin polymerization
and receptor recycling shown play important roles creating
cellular extensions (lamellipodia), drive forward movement the
cell(6,7,8). however, many biological questions cell migration remain
unanswered. central role cellular motility human health disease
underlines importance understanding specific mechanisms involved in
this process makes accurate methods evaluating cell motility particularly
important. microscopes usually used visualize movement cells.
however, cells move rather slowly, making quantitative measurement cell
migration resource-consuming process requiring expensive cameras software
to create quantitative time-lapsed movies motile cells. therefore, ability
to perform quantitative measurement cell migration cost-effective,
non-laborious, utilizes common laboratory equipment great need 
many researchers. phagokinetic track motility assay utilizes ability a
moving cell clear gold particles path create measurable track on
a colloidal gold-coated glass coverslip(9,10). use freely available
software, multiple tracks evaluated treatment accomplish
statistical requirements. assay utilized assess motility many
cell types, cancer cells(11,12), fibroblasts(9), neutrophils(13),
skeletal muscle cells(14), keratinocytes(15), trophoblasts(16), endothelial
cells(17), monocytes(10,18-22). protocol involves creation slides 
coated gold nanoparticles (auÂ°) generated reduction of
chloroauric acid (au(3+)) sodium citrate. method developed by
turkevich et al. 1951(23) improved 1970s frens et
al.(24,25). result chemical reduction step, gold particles (10-20 nm
in diameter) precipitate reaction mixture applied glass
coverslips, ready use cellular migration analyses(9,26,27).
in general, phagokinetic track motility assay quick, quantitative and
easy measure cellular motility. addition, utilized simple
high-throughput assay, use cell types amenable to
time-lapsed imaging, well uses depending needs the
researcher. together, ability quantitatively measure cellular motility 
multiple cell types without need expensive microscopes software,
along use common laboratory equipment chemicals, make the
phagokinetic track motility assay solid choice scientists interest 
in understanding cellular motility.
