background: hiv-associated neurocognitive disorder (hand) remains common, despite
antiretroviral therapy (art). hiv dysregulates iron metabolism, cerebrospinal
fluid (csf) levels iron iron-transport proteins hiv-infected (hiv+)
persons largely unknown. objectives study characterize
csf iron-related biomarkers hiv+ adults explore relationships to
known predictors hand.
methods: quantified total iron, transferrin heavy-chain (h)-ferritin by
immunoassay csf sampled lumbar puncture 403 hiv+ participants a
multi-center, observational study evaluated biomarker associations with
demographic hiv-related correlates hand [e.g., age, sex, self-reported
race/ethnicity, art, detectable plasma virus csf viral load (vl)] by
multivariable regression. subset (n = 110) existing csf: serum albumin 
(qalb) measurements, qalb comorbidity severity also included as
covariates account variability blood-csf-barrier.
results: among 403 individuals (median age 43 years, 19% women, 56% non-whites,
median nadir cd4+ t cell count 180 cells/µl, 46% undetectable plasma virus),
men 25% higher csf transferrin (median 18.1 vs. 14.5 µg/ml), 71% higher
h-ferritin (median 2.9 vs. 1.7 ng/ml) women (both p-values ≤0.01). csf iron 
was 41% higher self-reported hispanics 27% higher (non-hispanic) whites
than (non-hispanic) blacks (median 5.2 4.7 µg/dl hispanics whites, 
respectively, vs. 3.7 µg/dl blacks, p ≤ 0.01); findings persisted
after adjustment age, sex, hiv-specific factors. median h-ferritin was
25% higher (p < 0.05), transferrin 14% higher (p = 0.06), whites than
blacks. transferrin h-ferritin 33 50% higher, respectively, older
(age > 50 years) younger persons (age ≤ 35 years; p < 0.01), but
these findings lost statistical significance subset analyses adjusted for
qalb comorbidity. additional adjustments, associations were
observed csf iron transferrin race/ethnicity well csf vl, 
transferrin sex art, h-ferritin plasma virus detectability 
and significant comorbidity (all p < 0.05).
conclusions: csf iron biomarkers associated demographic factors, art,
and csf vl hiv+ adults. future studies investigate role cns iron 
dysregulation, altered blood-csf barrier may contribute, hand.
