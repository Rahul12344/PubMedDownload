immunohistochemical studies one typical two atypical cases molluscum
contagiosum anti-cd34 monoclonal antibodies showed tightly enclosing fine 
vasculature around lesional masses disease. thin interstitial
septa lobules molluscum lesions also contained abundant
endothelium. electron microscopic study pinched-off lesion common
molluscum contagiosum demonstrated tightly enclosing blood vessels
lacked muscle layers, suggesting capillaries, distance 
several hundred nanometers basal cells molluscum mass. 3d
constructed image vasculature confirmed network vessels. these
tightly enclosing vascular networks around lesions molluscum contagiosum
support rapid growth disease.
