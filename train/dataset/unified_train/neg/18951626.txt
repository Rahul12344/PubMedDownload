mononuclear phagocytes (mp; monocytes, tissue macrophages, dendritic cells)
are reservoirs, vehicles dissemination, targets persistent hiv
infection. however, mp population equally support viral growth. such
differential replication typified greater ability placental
macrophages (pm), compared blood borne monocyte-derived macrophages (mdm), 
to restrict viral replication. since cytosolic protein patterns differentiate
macrophage subtypes, used proteomics approach consisting surface-enhanced
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (seldi-tof), tandem mass spectrometry,
and western blots identify differences uninfected hiv-infected
pm mdm protein profiles linked viral growth. performed proteome
analysis pm molecular range 5-20kda. found seldi-tof
protein peak m/z 11,100, significantly lower uninfected
and hiv-infected pm mdm, identified cystatin b (cstb). studies 
sirna cstb treatment mdm associated expression hiv
replication. data demonstrate low molecular weight placental
macrophage cytosolic proteins differentially expressed hiv-infected pm and
mdm identify potential role cstb hiv replication. work also
serves elucidate mechanism placenta protects fetus hiv
transmission.
