antigenic relationship human simian rotaviruses.

schoub bd, lecatsas g, prozesky ow.

the simian rotavirus, sa 11, murine rotavirus, edim, investigated
for antigenic relatedness human rotavirus, immunoelectron-microscopy.
these studies led recognition two types rotavirus antibody. one
agglutinated "rough" virus particles group-reactive; appears to
be widely distributed various animal species, including human infants. the
second antibody agglutinated "smooth" virus particles more
species-specific, demonstrating one-way cross-reaction simian 
and human viruses; found convalescent-phase human sera in
hyperimmune rabbit sera probably protective. simian rotavirus easy 
to propagate primary cell culture cell lines prove useful
for serodiagnosis human gastroenteritis. may candidate for
immunoprophylaxis.
