an indirect immunogold staining technique used identification of
hepatitis virus poliovirus types 1,2 3 electron microscopy. human
convalescent antisera hepatitis virus three poliovirus types
were used primary antibodies goat anti-human igg gold complexes, an
approximate gold granule size 15 nm, secondary antibody. hepatitis virus 
was specifically labelled homologous antiserum. labelling was
observed antiserum poliovirus negative control sera were
used primary antibody. poliovirus types 1, 2 3 specifically labelled 
with human serum high titres antibody three virus types.
the use type-specific antisera made possible distinguish types 1, 2 
3 other, although slight cross-reactions occurred. results indicate
that gold igg complexes conjunction human antisera may used for
identification small spherical viruses.
