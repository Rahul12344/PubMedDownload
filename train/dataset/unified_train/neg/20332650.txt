objectives: characterize morphological, physicochemical genomic features
of novel virulent coliphage isolated engineered escherichia
coli culture termed engineered e. coli phage (eep).
methods results: electron microscopy revealed eep icosahedral
head (62 nm diameter) long, flexible tail (138 nm length). eep was
able infect 10 engineered e. coli strains kept laboratory, showing 
a strong ability lyse engineered e. coli. sequencing eep genome
revealed double-stranded dna (39.8 kb) 54.72% gc content. fifty-two open
reading frames predicted coding sequences, 18 were
functionally defined organized modular format, includes modules
for dna replication, dna packaging, structural proteins host cell lysis. this
phage could inactivated 90 degrees 45 min resistant to
ethanol alkali treatment. eep assigned siphoviridae family based on
its morphological, genomic physicochemical properties.
conclusions: novel coliphage isolated engineered e. coli strains, 
its morphological, genomic physicochemical properties characterized,
which improve knowledge bacteriophage diversity.
