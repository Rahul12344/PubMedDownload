detection infectious bovine rhinotracheitis bovine viral diarrhea viruses 
in nasal epithelial cells direct immunofluorescence technique.

silim a, elazhary ma.

nasal epithelial cells collected cotton swabs diagnosis in
experimental field cases infectious bovine rhinotracheitis field cases
of bovine viral diarrhea calves. portion cells washed twice in
phosphate buffered saline 25 microl drop placed microscope slides.
the cells dried, fixed stained according direct fluorescent
antibody technique. another portion specimen inoculated onto
primary bovine skin cell cultures virus isolation. experimental
studies infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, 29/35 specimens positive by
fluorescent antibody technique 32/35 cell culture field cases, 
22/119 positive fluorescent antibody technique 19/119 cell
culture. field cases bovine viral diarrhea, 28/69 samples positive
by fluorescent antibody technique 14/69 cell culture. fluorescent
antibody technique performed inoculated cell cultures total 24/69
specimens positive bovine viral diarrhea. sensitivity fluorescent
antibody technique thus comparable cell culture method for
infectious bovine rhinotracheitis bovine viral diarrhea.
