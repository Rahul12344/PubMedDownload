objective: examine potential contribution thymus cd4+
t-lymphocyte increases hiv-infected patients receiving intermittent
interleukin-2 (il-2) therapy.
design: fifteen hiv-infected patients treated antiretroviral regimens who
were enrolled study intermittent il-2 therapy willing undergo
serial thymic computed tomography (ct) prospectively studied.
methods: thymic ct performed approximately 6 12-17 months
after intermittent il-2 therapy started. scans graded blinded
manner. changes lymphocyte subpopulations determined flow cytometry.
results: statistically significant increases cd4+ lymphocytes occurred 
il-2 administration, preferential increase naive relative memory
cd4+ cells. despite increase naive cd4+ cells, overall a
modest decrease thymic volume observed study period. correlation
was found changes thymic volume indices total, naive, memory
cd4+ t-lymphocyte counts.
conclusions: findings demonstrate profound cd4+ t-lymphocyte
increases seen intermittent il-2 administration associated with
increases thymic volume likely due peripheral expansion rather
than increased thymic output.
