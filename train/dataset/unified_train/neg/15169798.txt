purpose: phase ii clinical trial conducted evaluate feasibility 
tolerability prime/boost vaccine strategy using vaccinia virus fowlpox
virus expressing human prostate-specific antigen (psa) patients with
biochemical progression local therapy prostate cancer. induction of
psa-specific immunity also evaluated.
patients methods: randomized clinical trial conducted eastern
cooperative oncology group 64 eligible patients randomly assigned to
receive four vaccinations fowlpox-psa (rf-psa), three rf-psa vaccines
followed one vaccinia-psa (rv-psa) vaccine, one rv-psa vaccine followed 
three rf-psa vaccines. major end point psa response 6 months, and
immune monitoring included measurements anti-psa anti-vaccinia antibody
titers psa-specific t-cell responses.
results: prime/boost schedule well tolerated adverse events. 
the eligible patients, 45.3% men remained free psa progression 19.1
months 78.1% demonstrated clinical progression-free survival. a
trend favoring treatment group received priming dose rv-psa.
although significant increases anti-psa antibody titers detected, 46% 
of patients demonstrated increase psa-reactive t-cells.
conclusion: therapy poxviruses expressing psa delivered prime/boost
regimen feasible associated minimal toxicity cooperative
group setting. significant proportion men remained free psa clinical 
progression 19 months follow-up, nearly half demonstrated increase
in psa-specific t-cell responses. phase iii studies needed define role
of vaccination men prostate cancer risk the
disease.
