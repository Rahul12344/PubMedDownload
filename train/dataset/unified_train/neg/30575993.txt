salivary glands (sgs) represent permissive site several sialotropic viruses
whose persistence linked development autoimmunity. natural killer
(nk) cells play key role viral clearance involvement viral
infection control tertiary lymphoid structures (tls) development within
sgs unknown. using inducible model tls sgs wild-type
c57bl/6 mice, induced local delivery replication-defective adenovirus
(adv), demonstrated circulating nk cells rapidly recruited sgs and
highly enrich early inflammatory infiltrate prior tls development. nk
cells migrating sgs response adv infection up-regulate nkp46, undergo
proliferation, acquire cytotoxic potential, produce granzyme-b ifn-γ, and
reduce viral load acute phase infection. nonetheless, selective
depletion circulating infiltrating nk cells adv-infected mice
neither affect development frequency tls onset of
autoimmunity. data demonstrate that, upon local viral delivery adv,
peripheral nk cells homing sgs exert early control viral
infection dispensable formation tls breach immunologic 
tolerance.
