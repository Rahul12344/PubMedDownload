currently, clinical gene therapy experiencing renaissance, new products
for clinical use approved europe clinical trials multiple diseases
reporting positive results, especially using recombinant adeno-associated
viral (raav) vectors. amid new success, prudent recall the
field gene therapy experienced tragic setbacks 1999 2002 the
serious adverse events related retroviral adenoviral gene delivery two 
clinical trials resulted death two patients. cases, the
toxicity observed humans documented occur animal models.
however, toxicities either undetected underappreciated 
arose humans. raavs tested extensively animals animal models 
of disease, largely without adverse events, except transient elevation in
liver enzymes patients. however, small growing number murine
studies documented adeno-associated viral gene delivery result in
insertional mutagenesis. herein, aggregate data reviewed multiple
murine studies genotoxicity associated raav treatment been
observed. data emphasize need proactive position evaluate the
potential risks possible solutions associated aav-mediated gene therapy.
