merkel cell polyomavirus (mcpyv) recently discovered merkel cell carcinoma
(mcc), clinically pathologically heterogeneous malignancy dermal
neuroendocrine cells. investigate heterogeneity, developed tissue
microarray (tma) characterize immunohistochemical staining candidate tumor 
cell proteins quantitative pcr assay detect mcpyv measure viral
loads. mcpyv detected 19 23 (74%) primary mcc tumors, 8 these
had less 1 viral copy per 300 cells. viral abundance 0.06-1.2 viral
copies/cell directly related presence retinoblastoma gene product (prb)
and terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (tdt) immunohistochemical
staining (p < = 0.003). higher viral abundance tumors tended associated 
with less p53 expression, younger age diagnosis longer survival (p < = 
0.08). data suggest mcc may arise different oncogenic
pathways, including ones independent prb mcpyv.
