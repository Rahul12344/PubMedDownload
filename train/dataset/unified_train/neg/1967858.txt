an unusual posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder reported occurring
within 6 weeks heart-lung transplantation, patient primary
exposure epstein-barr virus. tumor presented primarily lung
allograft rapidly fatal bronchopneumonia refractory antimicrobial
therapy. viral genome detected within lesion southern blot
analysis, primary infection confirmed serologic studies. restriction
fragment length polymorphism analysis using lam 4-1214 probe demonstrated
that tumor infiltrate allograft lung derived donor's 
bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue recipient lymphocytes trafficking
through allograft.
