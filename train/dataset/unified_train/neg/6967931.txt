serotonin precursors modulators immunological responsiveness in
mice.

bliznakov eg.

central nervous system regulation endocrine functions mediated by
neurotransmitters, via hypothalamic hypophysiotropic factors turn
control anterior pituitary functions. evidence serotonergic-endocrine
interrelations regard adrenal, thyroid, gonadal prolactin functions
is fast accumulating. study extends importance interrelations to
some functions immune system. multiple administration of
5-hydroxytryptamine(serotonin) precursor, 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan(5-htph), 
produces marked depression cell dependent, humoral, hemolytic, primary
immune response mice. l-tryptophan, distant serotonin precursor,
produces slight significant depression immune response. multiple
treatment mice infected friend leukemia virus (flv) serotonin or
5-htph alone combination cyclophosphamide (cytoxan) results in
significant delay clinical progression infection. l-tryptophan
produces modest significant improvement. administration serotonin or
5-htph causes marked reduction thymus weight. reasonable to
postulate described effects result thymus involution which
affects cell compartment immune system. consequence of
hormonal imbalance caused alteration serotonin biosynthetic pathway
in brain. adrenal cortex implicated mediation this
effect. since many clinically used drugs affect serotonin metabolism, the
clinical consequences resulting alteration immunological
responsiveness considered.
