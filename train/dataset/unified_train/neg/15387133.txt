land application animal manure important means utilization of
nitrogen phosphorus. however, presence pathogens manure their
occasional leaching subsurface water become topic concern during
the past years. study undertaken determine extent which
salmonella anatum may leach tile-drained clay loam soil swine
manure applied. purpose, swine manure experimentally
contaminated s. anatum applied three tile-drained plots winter 
2001 another three plots served negative controls. following rainfall
events spring 2002 tiles started flow leachate samples of
subsurface water collected various time intervals tested s.
anatum. salmonella anatum found leach subsurface drainage
water indicating either retained upper layers soil did
not survive winter. leaching faecal coliforms coliphages also
tested. faecal coliforms coliphages detected subsurface water
from manure control plots, indicating ability tile drainage
system transport organisms groundwater water percolates
through soil. additional temporal studies longer time period are
needed determine survival leaching pathogens indicators into
subsurface water.
