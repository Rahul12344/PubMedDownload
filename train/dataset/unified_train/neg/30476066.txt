background: poxviruses large dna viruses infect humans animals.
vaccinia virus (vacv) applied live vaccine immunization against
smallpox, eradicated 1980 result worldwide vaccination. vacv
is prototype poxviruses investigation molecular pathogenesis
of virus. short-read sequencing methods revolutionized transcriptomics; 
however, efficient distinguishing rna isoforms and
transcript overlaps. long-read sequencing (lrs) much better suited solve
these problems also allow direct rna sequencing. despite scientific
relevance vacv, lrs data generated viral transcriptome to
date.
findings: deep characterization vacv rna profile, various lrs
platforms library preparation approaches applied. raw reads were
mapped vacv reference genome also host (chlorocebus sabaeus)
genome. study, applied pacific biosciences rsii sequel
platforms, altogether resulted 937,531 mapped reads inserts (1.42
gb), obtained 2,160,348 aligned reads (1.75 gb) different
library preparation methods using minion device oxford nanopore
technologies.
conclusions: applying cutting-edge technologies, able generate a
large dataset serve valuable resource investigation 
dynamic vacv transcriptome, virus-host interactions, rna base
modifications. data provide useful information novel gene
annotations vacv genome. dataset also used analyze the
currently available lrs platforms, library preparation methods, and
bioinformatics pipelines.
