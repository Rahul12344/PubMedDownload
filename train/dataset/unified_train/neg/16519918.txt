during latency herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1), major viral transcript
that detected latency-associated transcript (lat) 2-kb intron. this
intron excised larger (approximately 10 kb) primary transcript.
infection cells hsv expressing lats showed presence increased 
accumulation hsp70 protein specifically cold shock. transfection of
cells plasmid, expressing 2-kb lat intron, showed increased
translation compared cells transfected plasmids deleted regions the
intron. cold shock cells expressing intron resulted up-regulation of
hsp70 protein, hsp70 mrna. furthermore, cells showed increased cell
viability. using plasmid deletion mutants lat gene sequence, shown
that effect requires full-length lat intron. findings show a
function stable 2-kb lat intron protect cells cold-induced
stress may mediated via hsp70.
