several peptides specifically bind hiv-1 integrase (in) either
inhibit stimulate enzymatic activity developed laboratories.
kinetic studies using 3'-end processing strand-transfer assays performed
to study mode action peptides. effects various
peptides interaction substrate dna also studied by
fluorescence anisotropy. basis results, divided these
in-interacting peptides three groups: (a) in-inhibitory peptides, whose
binding decrease affinity substrate dna - peptides
increased k(m) in-dna interaction, thus inhibitory; (b)
peptides slightly increased k(m) in-dna interaction, in
addition modified v(max) k(cat) values in, thus stimulated 
inhibited activity, respectively; (c) peptides bound no
effect enzymatic activity. elucidated approximate binding sites 
the peptides structure in, providing structural insights their
mechanism action. in-stimulating peptide bound several specific
sites bind inhibitory peptides. may account 
unique activity.
