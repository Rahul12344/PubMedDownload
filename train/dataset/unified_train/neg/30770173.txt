venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (veev) known biological defense threat.
a live-attenuated investigational vaccine, tc-83, available, high
non-response rate also cause severe reactogenicity. generated two
novel vee vaccine candidates using self-amplifying mrna (sam). lav-cne a
live-attenuated vee sam vaccine formulated synthetic cationic nanoemulsion
(cne) carrying rna genome tc-83. iav-cne irreversibly-attenuated
vee sam vaccine formulated cne, delivering tc-83 genome lacking capsid
gene. lav-cne launches tc-83 infection cycle vaccinated subjects but
eliminates need live-attenuated vaccine production potentially
reduces manufacturing time complexity. iav-cne produces single cycle rna
amplification antigen expression without generating infectious viruses in
subjects, thereby creating potentially safer alternative live-attenuated
vaccine. here, demonstrated mice vaccinated lav-cne elicited immune 
responses similar tc-83, providing 100% protection aerosol
veev challenge. iav-cne also immunogenic, resulting significant protection
against veev challenge. studies demonstrate proof concept using 
the sam platform streamline development effective attenuated vaccines
against veev closely related alphavirus pathogens western eastern
equine encephalitis chikungunya viruses.
