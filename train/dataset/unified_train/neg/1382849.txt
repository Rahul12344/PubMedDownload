mucins among best described human tumor-associated antigens. least 73 
tumor-reactive anti-mucin antibodies described; addition, have
previously demonstrated existence tumor-specific cytotoxic t-lymphocyte
epitopes mucin produced breast pancreatic tumors. determine
whether appearance tumor-associated mucin epitopes explained by
altered post-translational modification mucin tumors, whether the
generation epitopes requires changes mucin gene itself, we
studied four burkitt's lymphomas six epstein-barr virus-immortalized b-cell
lines transfected expression construct containing mucin complementary
dna. transfected cell lines showed stable maintenance mucin gene, which
comprises 20 tandem repeats 60-nucleotide sequence. transfected
cells expressed many tumor-associated mucin epitopes, suggesting changes
in mucin synthesis seen breast pancreatic tumors present other
malignant cell types well. furthermore, even though cell line was
transfected identical mucin construct, expressed different subset
of tumor-associated mucin epitopes. suggests specificity these
epitopes tumors due genetic alterations mucin gene in
tumors. incubating transfected cells phenyl-n-acetyl-alpha-galactosaminide, 
an inhibitor o-linked glycosylation, altered cell surface carbohydrate
structures resulted increased expression tumor-associated epitopes,
implicating incomplete glycosylation mucin generation these
epitopes. findings suggest alterations posttranslational
modification normal gene products result expression novel
epitopes. furthermore, ability transfect cancer patients' epstein-barr
virus-immortalized b-cell lines mucin provide unlimited supply of
autologous, mucin-bearing cells study patients' t-cell
response mucin.
