chikungunya virus (chikv) mosquito-borne alphavirus re-emerged 2004 
and caused massive outbreaks recent years. lack licensed vaccine 
or treatment options emphasize need obtain insight viral
life cycle chikv-host interactions. infectious cdna clones important
tools studies, mechanism action studies antiviral
compounds. existing chikv cdna clones based single genome an
individual clinical isolate, expected evolved specific
characteristics response host environment, possibly also during
subsequent cell culture passaging. obtain virus expected general
characteristics recent e1-226v chikv isolates, constructed new
chikv full-length cdna clone, chikv ls3, based consensus sequence their
aligned genomes. report characterization synthetic virus 
a green fluorescent protein-expressing variant (chikv ls3-gfp). their
characteristics compared natural strain ita07-ra1, was
isolated 2007 outbreak italy. cell culture synthetic viruses
displayed phenotypes comparable natural isolate, mouse model they
caused lethal infections indistinguishable infections a
natural strain. compared ita07-ra1 clinical isolate nl10/152, the
synthetic viruses displayed similar sensitivities several antiviral compounds.
3-deaza-adenosine identified new inhibitor chikv replication.
cyclosporin effect chikv replication, suggesting cyclophilins
-opposite found +rna viruses- play essential role
in chikv replication. characterization consensus sequence-based
synthetic viruses comparison natural isolates demonstrated that
chikv ls3 ls3-gfp suitable representative tools study chikv-host
interactions, screen antiviral compounds unravel mode action.
