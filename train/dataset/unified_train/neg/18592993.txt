lipoid pneumonia usually presents chronic recurrent ingestion oily
substances accidental aspiration "fire-eating" demonstrations. massive 
exposure near drowning extremely rare potentially fatal. present a
case survival total immersion oil workplace. 66-year-old
woman nearly drowned vat vegetable oil admitted emergency
case severe hypoxia rescue. chest computed tomography (ct) findings
showed bilateral ground-glass opacity, consolidation, case fulfilled 
criteria acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). bronchoscopy and
bronchoalveolar lavage performed admission indicated oil droplets marked
neutrophilia (67%), made us diagnose ards induced lipoid pneumonia. we
commenced treatment pulsed steroids strictly managed fluid balance under
mechanical ventilation. despite immediate improvement oxygenation, value
of extravascular lung water index (evlwi) measured picco system
consistently remained 30 ml/kg clinical course. concluded
that lipoid pneumonia characterized prolonged elevatation pulmonary
vascular permeability.
