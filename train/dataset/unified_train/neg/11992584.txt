specific types human papillomavirus (hpv) known play causal role in
the development cervical cancer, human papillomavirus type 16 (hpv-16)
identified predominant type. despite this, little known cervical 
immune responses pathogen. aim study assess the
feasibility cervical cytobrush sampling single-cell cytokine staining to
investigate cervical lymphocyte-specific cytokine responses hpv-16 antigens.
of eighteen women recruited study, five hpv dna positive the
cervix (current exposure) five circulating antibodies hpv-16
(previous exposure). cervical lymphocytes, isolated five hpv
dna-positive women, two hpv dna-negative controls, one woman circulating
hpv-16 antibodies assessed hpv-specific responses using intracellular
staining interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) interleukin-4 (il-4). we
demonstrate cd4(+) cd8(+) cervical lymphocytes, harvested from
noninfected infected subjects, produce cytokines response to
nonspecific stimulation. however, antigen-specific (hpv-16 l1) ifn-gamma
production cd4(+) cd8(+) cervical lymphocytes detectable in
women exposed currently previously hpv-16. first time that
antigen-specific cytokine responses mucosal lymphocytes, obtained site 
of hpv infection, demonstrated. finding clearly illustrates the
use intracellular cytokine staining investigation low precursor
frequency single-cell antigen-specific responses lymphocytes harvested from
mucosal sites hpv infection.
