existence extra-genetic (epigenetic) codes postulated since 
discovery primary genetic code. evident effects histone
post-translational modifications dna methylation efficiency the
regulation dna processes supporting postulation. emdecode an
original algorithm approximate genomic distribution given dna
features (e.g. promoter, enhancer, viral integration) identifying relevant
chipseq profiles post-translational histone marks dna binding proteins 
combining supermark. emdecode kernel essentially two-step
procedure: (i) expectation-maximization process calculates mixture of
epigenetic factors maximize sensitivity (recall) association with
the feature study; (ii) approximated density recursively
trimmed respect control dataset increase precision reducing
the number false positives. emdecode densities improve significantly the
prediction enhancer loci retroviral integration sites respect to
previous methods. importantly, also used extract distinctive factors
between two arbitrary conditions. indeed emdecode identifies unexpected
epigenetic profiles specific coding versus non-coding rna, pointing towards a
new role h3r2me1 coding regions.
