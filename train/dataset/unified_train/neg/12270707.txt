we applied phage display technology dna-protein interaction studies. cdna
expression library displayed surface bacteriophage lambda generated
from highly differentiated mmh e14 murine hepatic cell line. selection of
this library using promoter sequence liver-enriched transcription
factor hnf1alpha gene ligate identified dna-binding domains specifically
interacting different regions regulatory sequence. one the
selected phage showed 100% identity dna-binding domain shared by
differentiation specific element-binding protein, vasoactive intestinal peptide
receptor-repressor protein replication factor c investigated.
specific binding selected protein domain confirmed a
phage-independent context. combining elisa south-western assays using 
selected phage bacterially expressed glutathione-s-transferase protein
fused encoded dna-binding domain, array multiple adjacent
dna-binding sites sharing common consensus motif identified. strategy
described represents powerful tool identify proteins bind dna
regulatory elements.
