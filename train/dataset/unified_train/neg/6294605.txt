mutations gene g.

a previously constructed escherichia coli transformant carrying functional copy
of bacteriophage phi x174 gene g plasmid, p phi xg, used isolate gene
g mutants carrying temperature sensitive lethal missense mutations. two of
the mutations characterized sequencing: one carries g --> a
transition residue 2821 producing gly --> ser change codon 143 g
spike protein; carries --> g transition residue 2678 producing 
glu --> gly change codon 95. sequencing dna 2 mutants carrying
lethal mutations rescued p phi xg reveal changes the
coding sequence. lesion believed intercistronic region
between genes f g. adsorption kinetics mutants appear be
normal. burst size 25% wild type phi x174 host
carrying p phi xg. results along previous results senior
author's laboratory demonstrate p phi xg used rescue gene g
mutant phi x174 regardless nature mutation involved.
