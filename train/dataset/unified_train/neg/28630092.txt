cmv reactivation major complication allogeneic stem cell
transplantation (sct). immune reconstitution cmv-specific ctls (cmv-ctls) is
essential virus control. cmv-ctl monitoring using mutated hla/cmv
tetramers selectively detecting high-avidity cells, observed coappearance of
cmv-ctls low (cmv tetlow ctls) high tetramer binding (cmv tethigh ctls) 
in 53/115 cmv igg+ patients stem cell transplanted cmv igg+ donors. however,
the relevance coappearing differentially tetramer binding ("dual")
cmv-ctls unclear. study, investigated kinetics, properties,
and clinical impact coappearing cmv tetlow tethigh ctls allogeneic
sct. patients dual cmv-ctls cmv tethigh tetlow ctls. chimerism
analysis isolated cmv tetlow tethigh ctls revealed exclusive donor
origin. cmv tetlow tethigh ctls identical effector memory cd45ra-ccr7-
and cd45ra+ccr7- cell distribution, equal differentiation, senescence, and
exhaustion marker expression negative regulatory cd8+ cell
markers. isolated cmv tetlow tethigh ctls equally sensitive cmv
peptides ifn-γ release cytotoxicity assays. however, cmv tethigh ctls
proliferated response low cmv peptide concentrations tetlow ctls.
tcr repertoire analysis revealed cmv tetlow tethigh ctls use different
tcrs. finally, dual cmv-ctls associated cmv antigenemia. in
conclusion, data show first time, knowledge, cmv
tetlow tethigh ctls functional effector cells differing by
proliferation, numbers peripheral blood, probably precursors
without increasing cmv reactivation risk allogeneic sct.
