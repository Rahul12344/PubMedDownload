breda breda-like viruses: diagnosis, pathology epidemiology.

woode gn.

breda virus serotype 1 (iowa) isolated severe outbreak neonatal
calf diarrhoea 15% diarrhoeic animals died. two isolates,
one iowa one ohio, antigenically related first isolate
but belong breda virus serotype 2 group haemagglutination inhibition
and immuno-electron microscopy (iem). majority (88.5%) cattle are
serologically positive breda virus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(elisa). diagnostic methods choice include combination of
electron microscopy, iem, haemagglutination inhibition elisa, order to
identify serotypes breda virus. serotypes 1 2 infect replicate 
crypt epithelial cells small intestine, mid jejunum region
posteriorly descending colon. virus replicates released 
from cells appearance microscopic lesions clinical signs.
diarrhoea starts within 24-72 hours infection death occur within 36-48
hours onset diarrhoea. morphology breda virus, determined 
negative staining ultrastructural studies infected cells, unique
and probably diagnostic. little known epidemiology, 
transmission faecal-orally may require close contact. large quantities 
virus released faeces.
