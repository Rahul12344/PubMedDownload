conventional wastewater treatment completely remove and/or inactive
viruses; consequently, viruses excreted population detected 
environment. study undertaken investigate distribution and
seasonality human viruses faecal indicator bacteria (fib) river
catchment located typical mediterranean climate region discuss future
trends relation climate change. sample matrices included river water,
untreated treated wastewater wastewater treatment plant within the
catchment area, seawater potentially impacted bathing water. five
viruses analysed study. human adenovirus (hadv) jc polyomavirus
(jcpyv) analysed indicators human faecal contamination human
pathogens; reported urban wastewater (mean values 10(6) 10(5)
gc/l, respectively), river water (10(3) 10(2) gc/l) seawater (10(2) and
10(1) gc/l). human merkel cell polyomavirus (mcpyv), associated with
merkel cell carcinoma, detected 75% raw wastewater samples (31/37) 
and quantified newly developed quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr)
assay mean concentrations 10(4) gc/l. virus related skin
cancer susceptible individuals found 29% 18% river water and
seawater samples, respectively. seasonality observed norovirus
genogroup ii (nov ggii), abundant cold months levels to
10(4) gc/l river water. human hepatitis e virus (hev) detected 13.5% of
the wastewater samples analysed nested pcr (npcr). secondary biological
treatment (i.e., activated sludge) tertiary sewage disinfection including
chlorination, flocculation uv radiation removed 2.22 4.52 log10

areas selected river catchment estimate general warming changes in
precipitation distribution. persistent decreases precipitation summer
can lead higher presence human viruses river sea water
