the currently used standard treatment chronic hepatitis c using dual
combination ifnalpha/rbv successful 50% cases. exception
of clinical biochemical factors, degree inflammation (grading) and
degree fibrosis (staging), known markers may serve as
valid predictors response therapy. interference hepatitis c virus (hcv) 
with signaling pathways modulated jak-stat, erk 1/2, nfkappab map proteins
is one mechanism may influence interaction hcv ifnalpha.
these proteins regulate different cell processes activation cytokines,
activation apoptosis, regulation cell proliferation etc. therefore, is
possible impaired signaling inhibition/dysregulation these
proteins hcv infection may cause resistance ifnalpha treatment. review
is completed results preliminary study aim was
immunohistochemical assessment analysis expression stat 2, 3 proteins, 
their inhibitors socs 2, 3 pias 3 proteins jak 1 erk 1/2 liver
biopsies 26 patients chronic hepatitis c treated dual combination
ifnalpha/rbv subsequent correlation results immunohistochemical
analysis (histoscore) histological picture clinical response to
treatment. results shows increased expression stat 3, stat 2 erk 1
proteins decreased expression socs 3 socs 2 hepatocytes patients
with marked inflammation fibrosis. patients sustained
virological response increased expression socs 3 jak 1 and
decreased expression socs 2. relapse associated increased expression 
of socs 3 pias 3. however, owing small sample size, results only
approximated statistical significance, suggest proteins stat
family inhibitors socs pias probably play important regulatory
role response treatment chronic hepatitis c.
