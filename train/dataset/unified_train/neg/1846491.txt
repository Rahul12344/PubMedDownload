nucleotide sequencing data region extending 35 kb inward right
inverted terminal repeat (itr) vaccinia virus (vv) genome established 
presence vv homologues shope fibroma virus (sfv) itr proteins. the
nucleotide sequences, comprising total 8.6 kb, amino acid
translations nine predicted open reading frames (orfs) (designated salf4l,
salf 19r, salf21r, b4r, b8r, b9r, b10r, b14r) presented. eight the
nine vv genes sfv orfs transcribed towards genomic termini.
however, relative positions vv genes (genus orthopoxvirus) are
different corresponding orfs sfv (genus leporipoxvirus),
indicating complex rearrangements dna genome one these
viruses subsequent divergence common ancestor. several other
features vv orfs noted. salf4l, b7r, b8r, b9r hydrophobic
amino-terminal signal sequences lack discernible membrane anchor domains
suggesting proteins may secreted. vv orf salf19r single
cysteine-rich region homologous multiple domains nerve growth factor
receptor (ngfr), cd40, ox40 (a glycoprotein surface activated murine 
t lymphocytes), recently described tumor necrosis factor receptors. 
downstream orf salf19r different reading frame, another
two related cysteine-rich domains, indicating salf19r larger
gene. b4r homology host range gene cowpox virus related
genes near opposite end vaccinia virus genome, contains regions
homologous repeat domains erythrocyte ankyrin. addition, several 
the vv orfs homology orfs near opposite end vv genome,
thus increasing number known vv gene families.
