the use affinity chromatography methods purify proteins complex
solutions well established. specific use immuno-affinity
chromatography, wherein antibody directed toward target protein utilized,
has proven particularly effective purification method. application of
immuno-affinity chromatography methods isolation plasma derivatives
has established purity products truly
remarkable. studies conducted baxter compared effect of
immuno-affinity chromatography separation plasma protein contaminants
and model viruses factor viii:c. results studies indicated
that plasma protein contaminant (eg. fibrinogen) reduction process 
factor viii:c immuno-affinity chromatography occurs gradually does
virus reduction. using residual plasma protein contamination factor viii:c 
preparations, general effectiveness immuno-affinity chromatography
step removing virus routinely evaluated. determinations made baxter 
have indicated greater 4 logs reduction protein contamination 
routinely achieved factor viii:c immuno-affinity chromatography at
manufacturing scale. bench scale studies confirmed result well as
showing reduction model viruses. viral safety plasma
derivatives dependent overall manufacturing process, clear that
immuno-affinity chromatography offers powerful means reducing product
contamination enhancing safety.
