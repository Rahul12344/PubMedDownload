we investigated ability sf-caspase-1 two mammalian caspases,
caspase-1 caspase-3, induce apoptosis spodoptera frugiperda sf-21
insect cells. transient expression pro-sf-caspase-1 not
induce apoptosis, expression pro-domain deleted form, p31, coexpression
of two subunits mature sf-caspase-1, p19 p12, induced apoptosis in
sf-21 cells. behavior sf-caspase-1 resembled closely related
mammalian caspase, caspase-3, contrasted mammalian
caspase-1, pro-form active inducing apoptosis sf-21 cells.
the baculovirus caspase inhibitor p35 blocked apoptosis induced active forms
of three caspases. contrast, members baculovirus inhibitor of
apoptosis (iap) family failed block active caspase-induced apoptosis. however,
during viral infection, expression opiap cpiap blocked activation of
pro-sf-caspase-1 associated induction apoptosis. thus, mechanism
by baculovirus iaps inhibit apoptosis distinct mechanism by
which p35 blocks apoptosis involves inhibition activation of
pro-caspases like sf-caspase-1.
