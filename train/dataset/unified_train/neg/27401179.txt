the implementation variety immunosuppressive therapies made
drug-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml) increasingly 
prevalent clinical entity. purpose study investigate its
diagnostic characteristics determine whether differences herein exist
between multiple sclerosis (ms), neoplasm, post-transplantation, and
autoimmune disease subgroups. reports possible, probable, definite pml
according current diagnostic criteria obtained systematic search
of pubmed dutch pharmacovigilance database. demographic, epidemiologic,
clinical, radiological, cerebrospinal fluid (csf), histopathological features
were extracted report differences compared disease
categories. 326 identified reports, pml onset occurred on average
29.5 months drug introduction, varying 14.2 37.8 months the
neoplasm ms subgroups, respectively. common overall symptoms were
motor weakness (48.6 %), cognitive deficits (43.2 %), dysarthria (26.3 %), and
ataxia (24.1 %). former two also constituted prevalent
manifestations subgroup. lesions often localized
supratentorially (87.7 %) infratentorially (27.4 %), especially the
frontal (64.1 %) parietal lobes (46.6 %), revealed enhancement 27.6 % 
of cases, particularly ms (42.9 %) subgroup. positive jc virus results 
the first csf sample obtained 63.5 %, conversion one 
negative outcomes occurred 13.7 % cases. 52.2 % patients died, ranging
from 12.0 83.3 % ms neoplasm subgroups, respectively. in
conclusion, despite heterogeneous nature underlying diseases, motor
weakness cognitive changes two common manifestations of
drug-associated pml subgroups. frontal parietal lobes invariably
constituted predilection sites drug-related pml lesions.
