we conducted systematic review scientific literature 1966 2005
to determine whether animals could provide early warning bioterrorism
attack, serve markers ongoing exposure risk, amplify propagate a
bioterrorism outbreak. found evidence that, certain bioterrorism agents,
pets, wildlife, livestock could provide early warning other
agents, humans would likely manifest symptoms illness could detected in
animals. acute attack, active surveillance wild domestic animal
populations could help identify many ongoing exposure risks. certain
bioterrorism agents found way animal populations, could spread
widely animal-to-animal transmission prove difficult control. 
public health infrastructure must look beyond passive surveillance acute
animal disease events build capacity active surveillance intervention 
efforts detect control ongoing outbreaks disease domestic wild
animal populations.
