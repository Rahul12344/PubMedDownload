background: detectable hiv-1 rna delivery strongest predictor of
mother-to-child transmission. risk factors detectable hiv, including type
of regimen, unknown. evaluated factors, including highly active
antiretroviral (haart) regimen, associated detectable hiv-1 rna delivery 
in women infants transmission study (wits).
methods: data 630 hiv-1-infected women enrolled 1998 2005 and
received haart pregnancy analyzed. multivariable analyses examined
associations regimens, demographic factors, detectable hiv-1 rna
(>400 copies/milliliter) delivery.
results: overall, 32% women cohort detectable hiv-1 rna at
delivery. among subset 364 haart-experienced women, lower cd4 cell count
at enrollment [adjusted odds ratio (aor) = 1.20 per 100 cells/microl, confidence 
interval (ci) 1.04 1.37] higher hiv-1 rna enrollment (aor = 1.52 per
log10 copies/milliliter, ci 1.32 1.75) significantly associated with
detectable hiv-1 rna levels delivery. 266 haart-naive women, both
lower cd4 cell count enrollment (aor = 1.24 per 100 cells/microl, ci 1.05 to
1.48) higher hiv-1 rna enrollment (aor = 1.35 per log10 copies/milliliter,
ci 1.12 1.63) associated detectable hiv-1 rna delivery. in
addition, age delivery (aor = 0.92 per 10 years older, ci 0.86 0.99) and
maternal illicit drug use (aor = 3.15, ci 1.34 7.41) significantly
associated detectable hiv-1 rna delivery among haart-naive women. type of
haart regimen significant either group.
conclusions: lack viral suppression delivery common wits cohort,
but differences antiretroviral regimen identified. despite a
transmission rate 1% last 5 years wits cohort, improved
measures maximize hiv-1 rna suppression term among high-risk women are
warranted.
