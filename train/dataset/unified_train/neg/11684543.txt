with success organ transplantation, liver disease emerged an
important cause morbidity mortality renal transplant (rt) recipients.
numerous studies performed 1990s shown hepatitis c virus
(hcv) infection leading cause chronic liver disease among rt
recipients. transmission hcv renal transplantation kidney 
hcv-infected organ donor shown unequivocally. liver biopsy essential 
in evaluation liver disease rt recipients, histological studies
have shown hcv-related liver disease renal transplantation is
progressive. outcome hcv-related liver disease probably aggressive
in rt recipients immunocompetent individuals. various factors affect the
progression hcv rt population: coinfection hepatitis b virus, time
of hcv acquisition, type immunosuppressive treatment, concomitant alcohol 
abuse. role virological features hcv remains unclear. natural
history hcv infection renal transplantation evaluation;
however, recent surveys long follow-ups documented adverse effects of
hcv infection patient graft survival rt recipients. use renal grafts
from hcv-infected donors recipients hcv infection appear to
result greater burden liver disease, least short period. the
association hcv de novo recurrent glomerulonephritis rt
