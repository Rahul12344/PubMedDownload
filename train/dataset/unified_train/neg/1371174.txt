a novel, sequence-independent strategy developed amplification
of full-length cdna copies genes double-stranded rna (dsrna) viruses.
using human (bristol) group c rotavirus example, single amino-linked
modified oligonucleotide (primer 1) ligated either end dsrna
genome segment using t4 rna ligase. following reverse transcription,
annealing, repair cdna strands, amplification viral dsrna genome
was accomplished polymerase chain reaction using single complementary
oligonucleotide (primer 2). northern (rna) hybridization cdna virus dsrna
indicated possible generate cdna representing complete genome 
from small clinical samples. technique used determine the
complete nucleotide sequence (728 bp) coding assignment gene 10, which
revealed open reading frame 212 amino acids limited homology ns26
from human group rotavirus. contrast previous tailing methods, the
addition one defined primer allowed unequivocal identification terminal
nucleotides generally applicable viruses segmented dsrna
genomes especially analysis clinical samples, limited
quantities biological material available.
