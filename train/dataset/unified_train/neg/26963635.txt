the spread cotton leaf curl disease china, india pakistan recent
phenomenon. analysis available sequence data determined a
substantial diversity cotton-infecting geminiviruses pakistan. phylogenetic
analyses indicated recombination two major groups viruses, cotton
leaf curl multan virus (clcumuv) cotton leaf curl kokhran virus (clcukov),
led emergence several new viruses. recombination detection programs and
phylogenetic analyses showed clcumuv clcukov highly recombinant
viruses. indeed, clcukov appeared major donor virus coat protein 
(cp) gene, clcumuv donated rep gene majority recombination
events. using recombination free nucleotide datasets substitution rates for
cp rep genes determined. inferred similar nucleotide substitution
rates clcumuv-rep gene (4.96x10-4) clcukov-cp gene (2.706x10-4),
whereas relatively higher substitution rates observed clcumuv-cp and
clcukov-rep genes. combination sequences equal relatively low
substitution rates, seemed result emergence viral isolates that
caused epidemics pakistan india. findings also suggest clcumuv is
spreading alarming rate, potentially threat cotton
production indian subcontinent.
