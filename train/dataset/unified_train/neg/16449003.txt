hiv-1 viral load falls rapidly initiation haart. phase decreasing
yet substantial viral production presence antiretroviral drugs could
generate resistant hiv-1. whether switching drug failing regime changes 
the demography mutations associated cd4+ t-cell compartment
is well-defined. investigated presence/absence quantity 184m
and 184v cd4+ t-cell compartment naïve patients initiated haart
(group i), patients shifted non-lamivudine therapy (group ii). we
initiated prospective 90 follow-up study 11 patients detect and
quantity proviral hiv-1 184m 184v cd4+ t-cell compartment a
sensitive real time pcr assay. results showed 184v detected in
the cd4+ t-cell compartment 7 naïve patients started haart. 
three 4 patients group ii experienced fall percentage of
184v, reduction detection limits 2 patients. concluded
that initiation haart allow archiving lamivudine
associated mutation, 184v, cd4+ t-cell compartment. reduction the
quantity 184v therapy switched effective non-lamivudine regime
indicates mutation compartment dynamic.
