phage phic31 integrase recombinase expressed mammalian cells 
to integrate plasmids carrying attb sequence genome specific
pseudo attp locations. show immunofluoresence wild-type phic31
integrase cytoplasmic addition sv40 nuclear localization
signal (nls) localized phic31 integrase nucleus. unexpectedly, nls
depressed integration efficiency hela cells provided benefit used 
to integrate human factor ix (hfix) gene mouse liver. breakdown of
the nuclear membrane mitosis could allow cytoplasmic integrase access to
the chromosomes, analyzed whether cell division required integration
into liver cells vivo. hepatocytes labeled iododeoxyuridine mark 
cells underwent dna replication week hydrodynamic
injection. hydrodynamic delivery led dna replication one-third of
hepatocytes. approximately three four cells phic31
integrase-mediated stable hfix expression undergo replication, indicating
that cell division required integrase function liver. therefore,
although bulk phic31 integrase protein seems cytoplasmic in
mammalian cells, integration still occur nucleus, even without cell
division.
