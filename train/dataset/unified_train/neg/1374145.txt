s-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (adohcy-nase) key enzyme in
transmethylation reactions. objective present study examine the
potential antiretroviral activities novel mechanism-based irreversible
adohcy-nase inhibitors. (z)-4',5'-didehydro-5'-deoxy-5'-fluoroadenosine (zddfa), 
(e)-4',5'-didehydro-5'-deoxy-5'-fluoroadenosine (eddfa),
(z)-4',5'-didehydro-5'-deoxy-5'-chloroadenosine (zddca) and
5'-deoxy-5'-acetylenic adenosine (daa) inhibited adohcy-nase activity ki
values 0.55, 1.04, greater 10.0 3.30 microm, respectively. four
compounds tested antiviral activity vitro moloney leukemia
virus (molv) xc-plaque assay. molv replication murine fibroblasts
(sc-1) inhibited zddfa, eddfa daa ic50 values 0.05, 0.25 and
3.30 micrograms/ml, respectively. zddca inhibit molv infection the
concentrations tested. antiviral activity correlated ability the
individual compounds maintain sustained elevations intracellular
s-adenosylhomocysteine (adohcy) concentrations sc-1 cells. zddfa, most
potent inhibitor adohcy-nase molv also active maintaining 
sustained elevations intracellular adohcy levels. antiviral activity of
zddfa also examined murine c3h1ot1/2 fibroblasts constitutively
produce molv. pretreatment zddfa (1.0 microgram/ml) 24 hr inhibited
virus production 88%. similar sc-1 cells, concomitant enzyme
inhibition, 300-fold increase adohcy levels zddfa (1.0
microgram/ml) treated c3h1ot1/2 cells. incorporation [3h]methyl group from
tritiated s-adenosylmethionine total rna c3h1ot1/2 cells inhibited by
zddfa without affecting cell viability. results suggest that
mechanism-based inhibitors adohcy-nase, zddfa, may potential as
antiretroviral agents.
