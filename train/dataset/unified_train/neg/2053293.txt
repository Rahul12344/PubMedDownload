the influenza a/chicken/pennsylvania/1/83 (h5n2) virus first known example
of influenza virus isolated natural infection contained primarily
defective interfering particles (t. m. chambers r. g. webster, j. virol. 61, 
1517-1523, 1987). chickens, coinoculation virus together the
closely related highly virulent influenza a/chicken/pennsylvania/1370/83
virus results reduced mortality compared virulent virus infection alone
(bean et al., j. virol. 54, 151-160, 1985). biological basis this
protective effect established. protective activity required greater 
than equal 100-fold excess input protecting virus virulent virus,
functioned effectively first generations virulent virus
multiplication, also functioned antigenically heterologous (h7n7) 
virulent influenza virus. protection correlated complete inhibition 
of virulent virus spread brain infected chickens. plaque-purified
chicken/pennsylvania/1/83 virus depleted defective interfering particles, 
beta-propiolactone-inactivated virus, protective effect. these
characteristics consistent hypothesis protection result
of defective interfering particle-mediated interference virulent virus
multiplication within respiratory tract chicken.
