nucleic acids (combined protein molecules) essential constituents the
living systems playing important role early evolution life well. 
a specific feature molecules found directly confirmed
recently: influence short-wavelength uv radiation bipyrimidine
photoproducts (cyclobutane dimers 6-4 bipyrimidines) induced the
reversion provoked photons. however, reversion is
preferred shorter wavelengths. increasing ratio longer
wavelength components radiation (using artificial uv sources solar
light earth's surface) impact reversible photoproducts the
harmful biological effect decreases photoproducts dominant.
assuming photoinduced reactions (dimerisation reversion) statistical 
events, irradiation chance number nucleoprotein molecules
to survive radiation damage reality. theoretical experimental 
basis assumptions discussed case bacteriophage t7
nucleoprotein.
