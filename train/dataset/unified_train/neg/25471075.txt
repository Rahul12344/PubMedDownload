little research done changes serum ferritin (s-ferritin) levels
and clinical implications following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation
(hct). retrospectively evaluated correlation s-ferritin levels after
hct survival 203 patients. s-ferritin level significantly
elevated, 75% patients showing peak levels 90 days hct. the
level >10,000 ng/ml total 43% patients, finding was
associated febrile neutropenia infection. s-ferritin level day 30 
and 1 year hct significantly associated prognosis. however,
this statistically significant relationship lost adjusting for
acute-phase reactants. conclude hyperferritinemia common 
degree influence red blood cell transfusion vary depending the
phase hct. prospective study needed determine iron load and
of contributes worse prognosis hct.
