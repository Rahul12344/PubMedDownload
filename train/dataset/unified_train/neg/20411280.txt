background: carried study evaluate association between
regulatory cells (treg) prognosis progression cryoablation in
patients hepatitis-b virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma.
methods: peripheral treg frequency 111 patients hepatocellular carcinoma 
(hcc) detected flow cytometry. treg frequency function were
re-examined patient follow up. possible association treg and
Î±-fetoprotein (afp) also analyzed, distribution resident cd4(+)
and cd8(+) cells foxp3(+) cells liver tissue patients hcc 
was examined immunohistochemistry.
results: treg frequency significantly increased disease progression. our
longitudinal study showed treg frequency significantly decreased 17
patients hcc regression following cryoablation, frequency had
dramatically increased 14 patients hcc recurrence progression.
furthermore, afp levels varied way comparable treg frequency in
patients elevated afp recorded therapy. significantly increased
suppressive effects treg proliferation cytokine secretion cd8(+) and
cd4(+) cells observed follow patients tumor progression,
but patients tumor response. moreover, numbers cd8(+), cd4(+),
and foxp3(+) cells infiltrating tumors around cryotherapeutic zones 
significantly decreased argon-helium cryoablation, associated 
with reduction foxp3/cd8 ratio. importantly,increased quantities of
circulating cd4(+)cd25(+)foxp3(+) treg tumor infiltrating foxp3(+) cells
before cryoablation associated high recurrence risk progression
in hcc patients cryoablation.
conclusions: treg variation associated tumor regression progression in
hcc following cryoablation may used marker estimate hcc
progression.
