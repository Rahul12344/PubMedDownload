responsiveness boosting, relative residual susceptibility infectiousness, 
and degree morbidity among vaccine breakthrough cases. age-structured
theoretical transmission model used, values vaccine efficacy based
on review literature expert panel. although implementation a
vaccination program resulted shift age distribution remaining
varicella cases toward older ages higher complication rates, overall
reduction cases resulted decreased morbidity measured overall number 
of hospitalizations number primary cases. routine immunization with
live-virus varicella vaccine would probably result substantial reduction

the vaccine. vaccine efficacy studies field designed obtain
better estimates residual susceptibility, residual infectiousness, duration of
protection, effects boosting wild-type reinfection.
