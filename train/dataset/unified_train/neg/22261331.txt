gene therapy important means comprehensive treatment pancreatic 
cancer. challenges associated gene therapy include control vector
security effective genetic screening. paper, cea promoter-regulated
oncolytic adenovirus vector constructed. reporter gene assay demonstrated
that viral vector confirmed tumor-specific replication features. 
in vitro cytology studies showed cea promoter regulated the
proliferation adenovirus vector carrying hsp70 gene (adceap-hsp70),
which significantly increased expression levels hsp70 cea-positive 
pancreatic cancer cells, resulting overall reduction survival of
cancer cells. human pancreatic cancer panc-1 xenograft model immune
deficient nude mice, cea promoter-regulated adenovirus adceap-hsp70
significantly inhibited tumor growth. rat pancreatic cancer dsl-6a/c1
xenograft model rats, viral proliferation high expression levels of
hsp70 promoted interstitial infiltration cd4+, cd8+ gamma/delta t
cells tumors, induced host secretion cytokines tgf-β, inf-γ, il-6
and dual anti-tumor effects completely inhibited growth of
pancreatic cancer. results demonstrated oncolytic adenovirus under
the control cea promoter provides additional assurances regarding safety
and efficiency cancer gene therapy. gene therapy model improves
anti-cancer efficiency broad applications developmental prospects.
