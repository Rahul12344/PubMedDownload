h-2riibp (rxr beta) member nuclear hormone receptor superfamily 
activates transcription mhc class genes response retinoic acid (ra).
using chemical cross-linking, co-immunoprecipitation, gel mobility shift and
streptavidin-biotin dna precipitation assays, show h-2riibp formed
heterodimers thyroid hormone (t3) ra receptors (t3r alpha rar
alpha). h-2riibp heterodimer formation required conserved sub-domain its
c-terminal region, occurred independently target dna much more
efficient either t3r alpha/rar alpha heterodimer h-2riibp homodimer
formation. heterodimers displayed enhanced binding target dna elements and
contacted dna manner distinct homodimers. functional role for
heterodimers vivo demonstrated synergistic enhancement mhc class i
transcription following co-transfection h-2riibp t3r alpha rar alpha. 
we provide biochemical evidence h-2riibp formed heterodimers several
naturally occurring nuclear proteins. results suggest h-2riibp, by
virtue ability heterodimerize, enhances combinatorial diversity and
versatility gene regulation mediated nuclear hormone receptors.
