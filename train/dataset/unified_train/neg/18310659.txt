gastric cancer cells often show altered ras signaling, though underlying
molecular mechanism fully understood. examined expression profile
of eight ras-association domain family (rassf) genes plus mst1/2 found that
rassf2a frequently downregulated gastric cancer. rassf2a was
completely silenced 6 10 gastric cancer cell lines result promoter 
methylation, expression restored treating cells with
5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. introduction rassf2a non-expressing cell lines
suppressed colony formation induced apoptosis. effects associated 
with cytoplasmic localization rassf2a morphological changes the
cells. complementary dna microarray analysis revealed rassf2a suppresses the
expression inflammatory cytokines, may turn suppress angiogenesis and
invasion. primary gastric cancers, aberrant methylation rassf2a was
detected 23 78 (29.5%) cases, methylation correlated significantly with
an absence lymphatic invasion, absence venous invasion, absence of
lymph node metastasis, less advanced stages, epstein-barr virus, absence p53
mutations presence cpg island methylator phenotype-high. these
results suggest epigenetic inactivation rassf2a required for
tumorigenesis subset gastric cancers.
