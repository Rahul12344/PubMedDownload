human kidney injury molecule-1 (hkim-1), type transmembrane glycoprotein
expressed injured renal proximal tubules, also found renal cell
carcinoma (rcc). current study attempts evaluate diagnostic utility of
hkim-1 large series 480 neoplasms including defined subtypes renal
cell tumors, metastatic rccs, nonrenal tumors. tissue microarray (tma)
sections containing 179 renal cell tumors (73 clear cell rcc, 30 papillary rcc,
16 chromophobe rcc, 15 oncocytoma, 45 metastatic rcc) included this
study. addition, 80 cases renal cell neoplasm 221 nonrenal tumors in
routine tissue sections also included. tma routine sections were
incubated anti-hkim-1 monoclonal antibody using envision-hrp kit. the
results demonstrated membranous/cytoplasmic staining pattern hkim-1
was observed 54 73 (74%) clear cell rccs 28 30 (93%) papillary rccs 
on tma sections. zero 54 chromophobe rccs 4 41 (9.75%) oncocytomas were
positive hkim-1 combining tma routine sections. similar staining
results observed 35 45 (78%) metastatic rccs. data cdna
microarray expression western blot demonstrated similar findings. fifteen 
16 cases (93.8%) clear cell carcinoma ovary demonstrated positive
reactivity hkim-1. data indicate hkim-1: (1) relatively
sensitive specific marker papillary, clear cell, metastatic rccs, (2)
can used distinguish clear cell chromophobe rcc, (3) may serve 
a diagnostic marker clear cell carcinoma ovary.
