blockage induction type interferons (ifns) essential the
success influenza virus proliferation host cells. several molecular
mechanisms influenza viruses inhibit ifn induction been
characterized. report potentially new strategy influenza viruses employ
to inhibit ifn production viral infection. two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis based proteomic approach, found expression iκb
kinase-gamma (ikkγ) suppressed influenza virus infection human lung
epithelial a549 cells. silencing cellular ikkγ small interfering rna led to
enhanced replication influenza viruses. concomitantly, overexpression ikkγ 
resulted increased production ifnα/β, whereas influenza virus infection
completely eliminated ikkγ-overexpression-induced production ifnα/β. our
results suggest ikkγ influenza virus mutually inhibitory, and
influenza viruses may inhibit ifn production suppressing expression
of ikkγ viral infection.
