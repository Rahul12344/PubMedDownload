we previously reported increased adherence cells human endothelial cells 
(ec) patients htlv-i-associated myelopathy (ham). define the
immunological function ec-adherent cells ham patients, investigated 
the degree spontaneous proliferation production inflammatory
cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), interferon-gamma
(ifn-gamma) granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm-csf). both
the degree spontaneous proliferation production tnf-alpha,
ifn-gamma, gm-csf ec-adherent cells ham patients significantly
increased, compared anti-htlv-i seronegative controls. furthermore, ham
patients, spontaneous proliferation production inflammatory cytokines by
ec-adherent cells significantly higher ec-non-adherent t
cells. conversely, functions ec-non-adherent cells significantly 
lower unseparated cells, cells application to
ec. demonstrated ec-adherent cells qualitatively and
quantitatively hyperactive anti-htlv-i seronegative controls
and population activated cells ham patients concentrated in
ec-adherent cells rather ec-non-adherent cells. results suggest
that ec-adherent cells peripheral blood ham intimately involved
in immunopathogenesis ham.
