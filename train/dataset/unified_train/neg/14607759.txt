background objectives: chemotherapy cause hepatitis flare-up through
viral reactivation patients contact hepatitis viruses. few
data available genotype reactivated viruses.
design methods: 40 consecutive adult patients indolent non-hodgkin's 
lymphoma (nhl) receiving fludarabine-based front-line chemotherapy, performed 
a prospective study viral hepatitis reactivation analyzed genotype 
the reactivated viruses. chemotherapy, 4 patients healthy carriers of
hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag), 2 hb core antigen antibodies (anti-hbc),
6 anti-hbs 6 anti-hcv; 22 seronegative.
results: hepatitis flare-up occurred 4 hbsag-positive patients 1
anti-hbc-positive patient median 1 month (range 1-4) chemotherapy, 
when cd4/cd8 ratio still inverted. hbv reactivation documented all
5 instances (hbv-dna 2-8 x 10(6) copies/ml). two 5 patients responded to
lamivudine, whereas 1 died acute liver failure 2 persistent severe
hepatitis. hbv genome sequencing hepatitis flare-up showed deviation from
the closest related published sequences 1.0% 1.1% 2
lamivudine-responsive patients, 1.5%, 1.8% 1.7% 3
lamivudine-resistant patients. polymerase open reading frame (orf) the
hbs orf lamivudine-resistant strains contained several novel amino acid
substitutions.
interpretation conclusions: results suggest fludarabine treatment 
of hbv-infected patients frequently associated acute hepatitis due to
viral reactivation, lamivudine may less effective situation
than settings immunocompromised hosts emergence of
resistant mutant strains.
