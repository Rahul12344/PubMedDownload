objective: liver increasingly recognized significant target
organ pathogenesis dengue virus infection. however, two
contradictory studies examined binding dengue virus liver
cells. study therefore sought investigate binding dengue virus
to hepg2 cells.
methods: radiolabeled dengue virus serotypes 1 2 prepared viral 
propagation vero cells. increasing amounts virus incubated with
hepg2 cells determine ability virus achieve saturation of
binding hepg2 cells.
results: results indicated possible reach saturation of
binding experimentally achievable conditions. sought determine
whether possible reach state saturation infection, using
increasingly high titers virus constant number cells. dengue serotype 
1 showed evidence saturation infection, even titers 5,000 viruses 
per cell. contrast, dengue serotype 2 became saturated levels of
approximately 3,000 viruses per cell.
conclusions: results consistent proposals dengue virus
binding cells mediated initially low-affinity interaction an
abundant molecule surface cell secondly interaction
with less commonly expressed molecule, required viral
internalization.
