adenovirus potential probe identifying understanding drug
sensitivity primary, nonproliferating cultures human normal tumour
cells scope limitations approach first need be
evaluated established cell lines. purpose identified an
ovarian tumour cell line (ci-80-13s) natural resistance adriamycin,
etoposide crosslinking agents compared human tumour lines.
resistance adriamycin correlated poorly resistance etoposide 
cell lines (r = 0.05). adenovirus replication drug-treated cells (viral
capacity) found differentially inhibited sensitive cells the
drug administered cells simultaneously infection (adriamycin) 20
hr infection (etoposide). viral capacity could inhibited more
than 90% sensitive cells. contrast, plateau exhibited the
dose-responses cell survival inhibition cellular dna synthesis, 
which distinguished sensitive resistant cells. adenovirus not
inactivated preincubation high doses adriamycin etoposide, thus
confirming functionally-relevant damage directly induced these
agents dna. uptake adriamycin etoposide similar sensitive and
resistant cells agents blocked cells g2 phase cell cycle. 
protein-linked dna induced sensitive cells. results indicate (a) 
these drugs two dose-dependent effects cells, one not
inhibit replication adenovirus; (b) inhibition adenovirus replication
could principle used predict sensitivity adriamycin etoposide.
