egypt highest prevalence chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection and
seropositivity worldwide, proposed enhanced
susceptibility hcv related coinfection schistosomiasis. although
currently, studies regarding actual prevalence human
schistosomiasis schistosomiasis/hcv coinfection evidences strongly support
that eliminating human schistosomiasis egypt necessary reduce hcv
prevalence liver pathology. present review highlights significant
impact neglected tropical disease human schistosomiasis both
susceptibility egyptians hcv coinfection, severity resulting liver
pathology, poor response antiviral therapy. immune evasion mechanisms 
exerted hcv-ns3/4a protease domain, possible impact immune
evasion mechanisms exerted proteases larval, worm egg stages the
parasite schistosoma human susceptibility hcv infection discussed. in
addition, schistosome immune evasion mechanisms may include immunosuppression
that turn prevents clearance hcv viremia leads relapsing hcv
infection severe liver pathology. propose generation replicon
system prevailing genotype (hcv-4a) egypt establishing its
replication hepatoplastoma immune cells presence bilharzial antigens.
finally, use humanized small animal model acquire hcv 
s. mansoni infections important understand real time the
impact coinfection immune system liver pathology.
