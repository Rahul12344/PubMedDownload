plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pdcs) play central role innate adaptive
immune responses viral infections. pdcs secrete type ifns and
proinflammatory cytokines upon stimulation either tlr7 tlr9. throughout the
course hiv infection, production type-i ifns profoundly impaired,
and total pdc cell counts peripheral blood correlates inversely viral
load positively cd4(+) cell count. origin defects is
unclear. pdcs express cd4, ccr5, cxcr4, primary receptor coreceptors,
respectively, hiv envelope; yet little known concerning effects of
the viral envelope cells. here, show exposure pdcs gp120
results suppression activation cells. suppression is
specific tlr9-mediated responses, tlr7-mediated responses are
unaffected gp120. gp120 also suppressed tlr9-mediated induction of
proinflammatory cytokines expression cd83, marker dc activation.
finally, gp120 suppressed pdc-induced cytolytic activity natural killer cells.
taken together, data demonstrate direct interaction hiv-1 gp120
with pdcs interferes tlr9 activation resulting decreased ability of
pdcs secrete antiviral inflammatory factors play central role in
initiating host immune responses invading pathogens.
