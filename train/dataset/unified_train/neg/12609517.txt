juvenile hormone esterase (jhe) selective enzyme hydrolyzes methyl 
ester juvenile hormone. enzyme plays important role regulation 
of metamorphosis caterpillars, implicated additional roles in
development reproduction orders insect. full length 
coding region jhe cdna manduca sexta subcloned the
baculovirus acmnpv genome control p10 promoter. recombinant 
virus demonstrated expression high levels jhe activity infected
into hi5 cells trichoplusia ni. recombinant protein partially
purified anion exchange chromatography biochemical characterization
showed similar features wild type protein. recombinant jhe an
estimated mw 66500 da. heterogeneity enzyme observed when
analyzed isoelectric focusing, although peak jhe activity observed 
at pi=6.0. highly sensitive trifluoroketone inhibitors certain
phosphoramidothiolates, relatively insensitive common esterase
inhibitors. incubating enzyme various organic solvents detergents
showed enzyme activated lower concentrations of
solvents/detergents remains significantly active even high concentrations.
the high tolerance organic solvents may make jhe enzyme useful future 
applications synthetic catalyst.
