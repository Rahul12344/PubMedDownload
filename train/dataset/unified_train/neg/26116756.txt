human respiratory syncytial virus (hrsv) highly contagious paramyxovirus
that infects children age two, generating estimated 75,000-125,000
hospitalizations u.s. annually. hrsv common cause of
bronchiolitis pneumonia among infants children 1year age, with
significant mortality among high-risk groups. regulatory agency-approved
vaccine available, existing prophylaxis therapies limited to
use high-risk pediatric patients; thus additional therapies sorely needed.
here, identify series benzimidazole analogs inhibit hrsv infection
in vitro high potency, using previously-reported high-throughput screening
assay. lead compound, sri 29365
(1-[6-(2-furyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazol-3-yl]methyl-1h-benzimidazo
le), ec50 66μm selectivity >50. identified additional
compounds varying potencies testing commercially-available chemical
analogs. time-of-addition experiments indicated sri 29365 effectively
inhibits viral replication present early stages viral
infection. isolated virus resistance sri 29365 identified
mutations transmembrane domain viral g protein genomic sequence
that suggested compound inhibits g-protein mediated attachment hrsv
to cells. additional experiments multiple cell types indicated sri
29365 antiviral activity correlates binding cell surface heparin by
full-length g protein. lastly, sri 29365 reduce hrsv titers or
morbidity/mortality efficacy studies using cotton rat model. although sri
29365 analogs inhibit hrsv replication vitro, work suggests 
g-protein may valid drug target vivo.
