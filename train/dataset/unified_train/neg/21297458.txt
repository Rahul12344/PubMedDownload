context: critical care faces challenges aspects healthcare
in developing world. however, critical care faces additional challenge 
that often deemed costly complicated resource-poor
settings. lack prioritization justified. hospital care the
sickest patients affects overall mortality, public health interventions
depend community confidence healthcare ensure participation and
adherence. effective critical care interventions, including
rapid fluid resuscitation, early antibiotics, patient monitoring, are
relatively inexpensive. although cost-effectiveness studies critical care in
resource-poor settings done, evidence surgical literature 
suggests even resource-intensive interventions cost effective in
comparison immunizations human immunodeficiency virus care. the
developing world, many critically ill patients younger fewer
comorbidities, critical care presents remarkable opportunity provide
significant incremental benefit, arguably much developed
world.
essential considerations: key areas consideration developing critical care 
in resource-poor settings include: personnel training, equipment support 
services, ethics, research. strategies training retaining skilled
labor include tying education service commitment developing protocols 
even complex processes. equipment support services need focus on
technologies affordable sustainable. ethical decision making must be
based data possible transparent articulated policies always.
research performed resource-poor settings focus needs
assessment, prognostication, cost effectiveness.
future directions: development critical care resource-poor settings
will rely stepwise introduction service improvements, leveraging human 
resources training, focus sustainable technology, ongoing analysis
of cost effectiveness, sharing context-specific best practices.
although prevention, public health, disease-specific agendas dominate many
current conversations global health, nonetheless time ripe the
development critical care. leaders global health funding hope improve
quality length life. critical care integral part continuum of
care necessary make possible.
