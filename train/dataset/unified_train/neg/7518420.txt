to study mechanism(s) responsible appearance epstein-barr virus
(ebv)-induced anti-histone autoantibodies, peripheral blood b lymphocytes from
healthy donors infected ebv resulting lymphoblastoid cell lines
were tested secretion antibodies reacting histones. found that
ebv-transformed cells produce igm antibody reactive histones the
frequency ebv-inducible circulating b lymphocytes produce antibodies to
histones least 10(-5). moreover, cultures tonsillar lymphoid cells,
the enrichment cd5+ b lymphocytes increases percentage ebv-transformed 
cultures making anti-histone igm antibodies. ebv may therefore, also vivo,
induce natural anti-histone antibody polyclonal b-cell activation without 
requirement antigen trigger antibody response.
