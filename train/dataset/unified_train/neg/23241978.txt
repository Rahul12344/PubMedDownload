human adenoviruses (hadv) important pathogens industrialized and
developing nations. hadv shown relatively resistant to
monochromatic uvc light. polychromatic uvc light, contrast, more
effective means disinfection, presumably due involvement viral
proteins inactivation mechanism. solar disinfection hadv, finally, is
only poorly understood. paper, kinetics mechanism hadv
inactivation uvc light direct indirect solar disinfection are
elucidated. pcr mass spectrometry employed quantify extent of
genome protein degradation localize affected regions hadv
proteins. purpose, used first time approach involving
stable isotope labeling amino acids cell culture (silac) human virus. 
inactivation uvc light full sunlight spectrum found to
efficiently inactivate hadv, whereas uva-visible light caused inactivation
in presence external sensitizers (indirect solar disinfection). genome
damage significant uvc less important solar disinfection. 
contrast, indirect solar disinfection exhibited extensive protein degradation. in
particular, fiber protein amino acids responsible host binding
within fiber protein shown degrade. addition, central domain
of penton protein damaged, may inhibit interactions fiber 
protein lead disruption initial stages infection. damage to
the hexon protein, however, appeared affect regions directly involved
in infectious cycle.
