caprine arthritis encephalitis (cae) lentiviral infection goats
characterized mononuclear cell infiltration various tissues, most
prominently joints, mammary glands and, young animals, brain. 
investigated early stages arthritis induced intracarpal intravenous
infection molecularly cloned cae virus. analysis synovial membranes
by immunohistological methods showed proportion cd8+ cells peaked
around day 12 post-infection. cd4+ cells increased lesser degree. the
relative proportion b cells rose steadily post-infection. 33 days
post-infection, plasma cells accounted one third inflammatory
cells inflamed synovium. histopathologically, arthritic lesions the
synovial membranes closely resembled membranes animals 2-year 
history chronic arthritis. observations indicate type of
short-term experimental infection particularly suitable studying the
pathogenesis goat lentiviral infection. addition, observations support 
the view predominantly humoral (type 2) immune response may contribute 
the pathogenesis cae.
