hepatitis c virus (hcv) transmission decreased adoption universal
blood donor screening social policies reduce risk infection in
intravenous drug users, remains worldwide health problem. objective 
this study evaluate phylogenetic relationships among sequences from
different hcv genomic regions sexual partners infected patients. nine
couples stable relationship without risk factors hcv
infection 42 control patients selected, ns3 ns5b regions
were analysed. phylogenetic analysis showed viruses five couples
had common origin, clustering monophyletic group, bootstrap
values greater 70. couples, monophyletic groups observed,
but without bootstrap support. thus, using two different viral genome regions, 
common source infection observed members five couples. these
data strongly support hcv transmission within couples.
