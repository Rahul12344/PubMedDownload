the cp gene variability among 21 olive latent virus 1 (olv-1) isolates obtained
from different hosts locations different times assessed. amplicons
obtained rt-pcr cloned, least 10 sequences isolate 
analyzed compared. olv-1 sequences available genbank included. the
encoded cps consisted 270 amino acids, except isolates g1s c7
(269 aa) g6 (271 aa). comparison cp genomic sequences isolates
under study showed low values nucleotide diversity, 0.02, maximum
nucleotide distances (0.087) within isolates (0.001). although very
few nucleotide sequence differences observed among isolates, olive
isolates exhibited lower diversity (0.012). addition, position 158 (157 
c7 g1s 159 g6) deduced aa sequences, alanine residue was
found conserved among olive isolates. citrus tulip isolates, a
threonine residue present position 158, whereas valine present at
this position tomato isolates. phylogenetic analysis indicated olv-1
isolates clustered five groups according original host. however, g6,
originally recovered olive repeatedly inoculated maintained n.
benthamiana plants 8 years laboratory, separated other
isolates. may attributable adaptation experimental host over
time. correlation phylogenetic grouping isolates based on
geographical location year collection. strong negative selection may have
contributed low diversity among olv-1 cp isolates.
