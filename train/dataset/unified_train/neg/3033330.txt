cell-free translation rna encephalomyocarditis virus examined after
hybridization chemically synthesized cdna fragments different sites 
5' noncoding region viral rna. following results obtained. the
binding cdna fragments first 41 nucleotides, poly(c) tract
(between nucleotides 149 263), sequence nucleotides 309
and 338 affect translation viral rna; binding cdna
fragments sequence nucleotides 420 449 caused slight
inhibition; binding fragments eight different sites between
nucleotides 450 initiator aug codon (nucleotide 834) caused high degrees 
of inhibition. results suggest first part 5' untranslated
region, least nucleotide 338, may required encephalomyocarditis 
viral rna translation; however, region near nucleotide 450 important for
translation viral rna. possibility initiation occurs an
internal site discussed.
