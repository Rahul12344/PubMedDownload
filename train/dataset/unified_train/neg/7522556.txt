during dna synthesis, binding human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) reverse
transcriptase (rt) template-primer precedes binding nucleotide
triphosphates. interaction oligonucleotide dna hiv-1 rt was
investigated using gel retardation assay. homodimeric (p66/p66) and
heterodimeric (p66/p51) isoforms hiv-1 rt capable binding dna
oligomers. thus, studies interaction hiv-1 rt dna were
done heterodimeric rt. studied conditions optimal binding.
the formation rt-dna complex primer-independent, extent dna
binding indistinguishable single-stranded double-stranded dna
(either blunt-ended recessed). dna binding activity rt found to
be dependent oligonucleotide length. hiv-1 rt binds dna apparent
sequence specificity. hence, enzyme belongs sequence nonspecific dna 
binding proteins. interaction found independent dna synthesis.
the formation rt-dna complex influenced presence either 
template-complementary noncomplementary dntps, indicating neither dna
polymerization binding rt dntp affects stability the
complex. gel retardation assay utilized examine also effect of
various hiv-1 rt inhibitors (i.e., azt-tp, ddttp, tibo, and
3,5,8-trihydroxy-4-quinolone) enzyme-dna interaction. results indicate
differences modes action compounds.(abstract truncated 250
