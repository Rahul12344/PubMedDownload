the overall promise breast cancer chemoprevention exemplified clinical
success selective estrogen receptor modulators aromatase inhibitors.
despite clinical efficacy, interventions limitations, including rare
but serious side effects lack activity estrogen receptor-negative 
breast cancers. shown previously dietary administration benzyl
isothiocyanate (bitc), occurs naturally thioglucoside conjugate in
edible cruciferous vegetables, inhibits development estrogen receptor-negative
breast cancer mouse mammary tumor virus-neu (mmtv-neu) transgenic mice. this
study demonstrates akt-mediated sugar addiction breast cancer chemoprevention 
by bitc. bitc-treated mmtv-neu mice exhibited increased 2-deoxy-2-(18
f)-fluoro-d-glucose (18 f-fdg) uptake mammary tumors vivo comparison
with mice fed basal diet. cellular studies using mda-mb-231 sum159 human
breast cancer cell lines revealed bitc-mediated induction punctate
localization glucose transporter glut-1, accompanied increase 
in intracellular pyruvate levels. bitc treatment resulted increased s473
phosphorylation (activation) akt cells vitro well mammary
tumors mmtv-neu mice vivo. increased glucose uptake, punctate pattern of
glut-1 localization, intracellular pyruvate levels resulting bitc
exposure significantly attenuated presence pharmacological
inhibitor akt (mk-2206). inhibition akt augmented bitc-mediated inhibition 
of cell migration colony formation. bitc-induced apoptotic cell death was
also increased pharmacological inhibition akt. results indicate
increased glucose uptake/metabolism bitc treatment breast cancer cells
suggesting breast cancer chemoprevention bitc may augmented by
pharmacological inhibition akt.
