the hiv-1 glycoprotein, gp41, mediates fusion virus lipid envelope with
the target cell membrane virus entry cells. despite extensive studies
of protein, inconsistent contradictory structural information abounds in
the literature c-terminal membrane-interacting region gp41. this
c-terminal region contains membrane-proximal external region (mper), which
harbors epitopes four broadly neutralizing antibodies, the
transmembrane domain (tmd), anchors protein virus lipid
envelope. due difficulty crystallizing solubilizing mper-tmd,
most structural studies functionally important domain carried out
using truncated peptides either absence membrane-mimetic solvents or
bound detergents lipid bicelles. determine structural architecture 
of mper-tmd native environment lipid membranes, carried
out solid-state nmr study full mper-tmd segment bound to
cholesterol-containing phospholipid bilayers. 13c chemical shifts indicate that
the majority peptide α-helical, except c-terminus tmd,
which moderate β-sheet character. intermolecular 19f-19f distance
measurements singly fluorinated peptides indicate mper-tmd is
trimerized virus-envelope mimetic lipid membrane. intramolecular 13c-19f
distance measurements indicate presence turn mper helix 
the tmd helix. supported lipid-peptide water-peptide 2d 1h-13c
correlation spectra, indicate mper binds membrane surface
whereas tmd spans bilayer. together, data indicate full-length
mper-tmd assembles trimeric helix-turn-helix structure lipid membranes.
we propose turn mper tmd may important inducing
membrane defects concert negative-curvature lipid components as
cholesterol phosphatidylethanolamine, surface-bound mper helix may 
interact n-terminal segments protein late stages membrane
fusion.
