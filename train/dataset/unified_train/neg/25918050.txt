we evaluated whether phospholemman (plm) regulates l-type ca(2+) current (ica) in
mouse ventricular myocytes. expression α1-subunit l-type ca(2+) channels
between wild-type (wt) plm knockout (ko) hearts similar. compared wt
myocytes, peak ica (at -10 mv) ko myocytes ~41% larger, inactivation
time constant (τ(inact)) ica ~39% longer, deactivation time constant
(τ(deact)) similar. presence isoproterenol (1 μm), peak ica was
~48% larger τ(inact) ~144% higher ko myocytes. ba(2+) the
permeant ion, plm enhanced voltage-dependent inactivation effect on
τ(deact). dissect molecular determinants plm regulated ica, we
expressed plm mutants adenovirus-mediated gene transfer cultured ko
myocytes. 24h culture, ko myocytes expressing green fluorescent protein 
(gfp) significantly larger peak ica longer τ(inact) ko myocytes
expressing wt plm; thereby independently confirming observations freshly
isolated myocytes. compared ko myocytes expressing gfp, ko myocytes expressing
the cytoplasmic domain truncation mutant (tm43), non-phosphorylatable s68a
mutant, phosphomimetic s68e mutant, signature pfxyd alanine (all5)
mutant resulted lower peak ica. expressing plm mutants alter
expression α1-subunit l-type ca(2+) channels cultured ko myocytes. our
results suggested extracellular pfxyd motif transmembrane
domain plm cytoplasmic tail necessary regulation peak 
ica amplitude. conclude plm limits ca(2+) influx cardiac myocytes by
reducing maximal ica accelerating voltage-dependent inactivation.
