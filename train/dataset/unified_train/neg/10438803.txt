retroviral particles contain two positive-strand genomic rnas linked together 
noncovalent bonds dissociated mild conditions. studied
genomic rnas wild-type mutant avian leukosis viruses (alvs) attempt 
to (i) better understand site(s) rna dimerization, (ii) examine whether
the primer binding site (pbs) trna primer involved dimerization, and
(iii) determine structure genomic rna protease-deficient (pr(-))
mutants. showed extensively nicked wild-type alv genomic rnas melt
cooperatively. implies complex secondary and/or tertiary structure for
these rnas extends well beyond 5' dimerization site. investigate 
role pbs-trna complex dimerization, analyzed genomic rnas from
mutant viruses trna(trp) pbs replaced sequences
homologous 3' end six chicken trnas. found genomic rnas of
these viruses dimers dissociate temperature wild-type
viral rna, suggests identity pbs trna primer not
affect dimer stability. studied two alv pr(-) mutants: one containing large 
(>1.9-kb) inversion spanning 3' end gag much pol, rendering it
deficient pr, reverse transcriptase, integrase, another point
mutation pr. mutant viruses, genomic rna appears be
either primarily exclusively monomeric. data suggest alv can
package rna monomers subsequently dimerize.
