to characterize responses raccoons west nile virus (wnv) infection, 
subcutaneously exposed wnv. moderately high viremia titers (â‰¤ 10(4.6)
plaque forming units [pfu]/ml serum) noted select individuals;
however, peak viremia titers variable viremia detectable some
individuals late 10 days post-inoculation (dpi). addition, fecal
shedding prolonged animals (e.g., 6 13 dpi one
individual), 10(5.0) pfu/fecal swab detected. west nile virus 
detected tissues collected 10 16 dpi, histologic lesions
attributable wnv infection observed. overall, viremia profiles suggest
that raccoons unlikely important wnv amplifying hosts. however, this
species may occasionally shed significant quantities virus feces.
considering behavioral ecology, including repeated use same-site
latrines, high levels fecal shedding could potentially lead interspecies
fecal-oral wnv transmission.
