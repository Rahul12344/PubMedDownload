we developed vitro reconstructed vaginal mucosa integrating langerhans
cells (lcs), obtained differentiation umbilical cord blood cd34(+)
hematopoietic progenitor cells, and, model, investigated the
infection lcs human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1). proviral dna 
x4 (lai nl4-3) r5 (ba-l) hiv-1 strains detected lcs integrated in
the reconstituted mucosa. infection lcs could specifically inhibited the
chemokines stromal cell-derived factor 1 (sdf-1) rantes (regulated on
activation, normally cell-expressed -secreted), confirming presence 
functional coreceptors lcs generated vitro. complete inhibition lcs,
by use azidothymidine, reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, also observed.
moreover, hiv-1-infected lcs reconstructed mucosa able transmit r5
or x4 hiv-1 strains activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. model
could useful tool study mechanisms involved transmission hiv in
the female genital tract.
