for patients local recurrence prostate cancer definitive
irradiation therapy treatment widely considered safe effective.
after extensive preclinical testing prodrug gene therapy vitro vivo,
we conducted phase dose escalation clinical trial intraprostatic injection
of replication-deficient adenovirus (adv) containing herpes simplex virus
thymidine kinase gene (hsv-tk) injected directly prostate, followed by
intravenous administration prodrug ganciclovir (gcv). goal to
determine safe dose levels vector future trials efficacy. patients 
with rising serum prostate-specific antigen (psa) level biopsy confirmation
of local recurrence prostate cancer without evidence metastases one more
years definitive irradiation therapy eligible trial. after
giving informed consent, patients received injections increasing
concentrations adv/hsa-tk 1 ml prostate ultrasound guidance.
ganciclovir given intravenously 14 days (5 mg/kg every 12 hr).
patients monitored closely evidence toxicity response to
therapy. eighteen patients treated 4 escalating doses: group 1 (n = 4)
received 1 x 10(8) infectious units (iu); group 2 (n = 5) received 1 x 10(9) iu; 
group 3 (n = 4) received 1 x 10(10) iu; group 4 (n = 5) received 1 x 10(11) iu.
vector detected pcr urine samples treatment, increasing in
frequency duration (up 32 days) dose increased. cultures of
blood urine specimens negative growth adenovirus. minimal
toxicity (grade 1-2) encountered four patients. one patient highest
dose level developed spontaneously reversible grade 4 thrombocytopenia grade 
3 hepatotoxicity. three patients achieved objective response, one 
three highest dose levels, documented fall serum psa levels 50% or
more, sustained 6 weeks 1 year. study first demonstrate the
safety adv/hsv-tk plus gcv gene therapy human prostate cancer first
to demonstrate anticancer activity gene therapy patients prostate
cancer. trials underway identify optimal distribution of
vector within prostate explore safety repeat courses gene
therapy.
