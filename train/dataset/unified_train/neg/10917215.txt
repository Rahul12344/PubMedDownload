objective: serum procalcitonin (pct), c-reactive protein (crp) interleukin-6 
(il-6) concentrations measured 126 children hospitalized for
community-acquired, radiologically confirmed pneumonia assess whether these
host response values could used distinguish bacterial viral pneumonia.
methods: samples pct, crp il-6 measurements obtained on
admission first day hospitalization. etiology pneumonia was
studied extensive panel methods detected 6 bacteria 11
viruses.
results: all, 54% evidence bacterial pneumonia, 32% evidence of
sole viral pneumonia. 14% cases etiology could determined.
children bacterial pneumonia significantly higher pct (median 2.09 ng/ml
vs. 0.56 ng/ml, p = 0.019) crp concentrations (96 mg/l vs. 54 mg/l, p =
0.008) sole viral etiology. however, values markedly
overlapped. significant difference il-6 concentrations seen the
two patient groups. using pct > = 2.0 ng/ml, crp > = 150 mg/l il-6 > 
= 40 pg/ml, specificity > =80% bacterial pneumonia. the
sensitivities cutoff values 50% pct, 31% crp 34% 
il-6.
conclusions: results indicate measurement serum pct, crp il-6
has little value differentiation bacterial viral pneumonia in
children. however, patients high serum pct, crp il-6 values,
bacterial pneumonia probable.
