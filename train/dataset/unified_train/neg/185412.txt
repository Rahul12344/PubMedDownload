sequence arrangement herpes simplex virus type 1 dna: identification of
terminal fragments restriction endonuclease digests evidence for
inversions redundant unique sequences.

it proposed sheldrick berthelot (1974) terminal
sequences herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) dna repeated internal 
inverted form inverted redundant sequences delimit separate two 
unique sequences, l. study sequence arrangement hsv-1 dna
has investigated restriction endonuclease cleavage, end-labeling
studies, molecular hybridization experiments. terminal fragments in
digests restriction endonucleases hind iii, hpa-1, ecori bum were
identified shown consistent sheldrick berthelot model.
inverted fragments contain unique sequences well redundant sequences,
and model predicts, identified dna-dna hybridization studies.
further cleavage bum fragments hpa-1 also revealed inversions the
terminal sequences contained unique sequences. results obtained showed
that unique sequences l relatively inverted different dna
molecules population, resulting presence four related genomes
with rearranged sequences apparently equal amounts. redundant sequences
bounding share complete sequence homology bounding l, but
hybridization studies presented show terminal 0.3% the
genome repeated every redundant sequence.
