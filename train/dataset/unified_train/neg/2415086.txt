homologous interference foot-and-mouth disease virus strain attenuated for
cattle.

polacino p, kaplan g, palma el.

an attenuated strain foot-and-mouth disease virus (fmdv) a24 cruzeiro
subtype grew less well wild-type virus primary bovine fetal kidney (pbk) 
cells resulting 4-log lowered efficiency plaque formation. wild-type
and attenuated virus grew equally well baby hamster kidney (bhk) cells 
suckling mice. using pbk cells, virus-specific rna wild-type accumulated
up 6 hours infection. contrast, pbk cells infected the
attenuated strain made less 20 per cent rna synthesized wild-type 
virus. infection cell wild-type virus followed superinfection with
attenuated virus led almost complete inhibition viral rna synthesis, an
effect dependent concentration input attenuated virus. three
subsequent undiluted successive passages attenuated virus resulted a
preparation longer interfered wild-type rna synthesis which
induced viral rna synthesis pbk cells. basis this
interference considered. interference occurred intracellularly was
directed viruses within genus fmdv. role interferon was
ruled out. attempts demonstrate physical presence defective interfering
(di) particles fmdv attenuated strain failed; but, cyclic patterns of
infectivity produced successive undiluted passages.
