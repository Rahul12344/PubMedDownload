the coronavirus spike protein assumed mediate essential biological
functions, including recognition target cells. earlier studies and
other groups identified two regions tgev (220k) protein possibly
implicated functions. first corresponds 224 amino
acid n-terminal region deleted prcv, respiratory variant tgev.
we examined pathogenicity newborn piglet series of
neutralization escape mutants encoding protein mutated region.
several amino acid changes correlated dramatic loss of
enterovirulence, thus indicating crucial determinants associated with
this domain s. second region potential relevance major
neutralization domain. baculovirus-vectored expression 150 220 amino
acid-long stretches encompassing region, encoded tgev and
prcv, performed. resultant recombinant proteins shown react 
the cognate antibodies bind apn specifically, thus localizing the
receptor-binding site primary structure. altogether data lend
support view domain protein structurally distinct the
receptor binding site required virus express enteric tropism.
