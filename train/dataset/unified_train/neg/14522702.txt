the abilities massachusetts-type vaccine virus virulent infectious
bronchitis (ib) field virus increase colibacillosis susceptibility were
compared. four experiments, 29-day-old female commercial broilers housed in
isolators, infected intratracheally oculonasally ib vaccine strains
(h120 h52) virulent ib field strains (d387 m41) (4.8 6.8 log(10)
median embryo infective dose, per broiler). five days later, escherichia coli 506
strain given intratracheally (5.6 8.8 log(10) colony forming
units/broiler). incidence nasal discharge 3 5 days ib virus
infection used assess clinical effect ib infection, while
mortality, body weight uniformity e. coli lesions 7 days following e. coli
inoculation used parameters colibacillosis. nasal discharge was
observed 6/117 (5%), 26/119 (22%), 35/119 (29%) 115/120 (96%) broilers 
infected h120, h52, d387 m41 virus, respectively. apart h52 and
d387, differences ibv strains significant. ib vaccine virulent
ib viruses generally differ significantly ability induce
colibacillosis susceptibility. mean colibacillosis lesion scores h52-infected 
birds even significantly exceeded birds infected ib
viruses. ability h120 virus induce colibacillosis susceptibility tended
to weakest. practical consequences findings discussed.
