the 2a region foot-and-mouth disease virus (fmdv) encodes short sequence
that mediates self-processing novel translational effect. translation
elongation arrest leads release nascent polypeptide re-initiation
at next in-frame codon. way discrete translation products derived
from single open reading frame. active 2a-like sequences found in
(many) viruses trypanosome non-ltr retrotransposons. exponential growth
of 2a technology within last decade lead many
biotechnological/biomedical applications including generation transgenic
plants/animals genetic manipulation human embryonic stem cells (hescs).
