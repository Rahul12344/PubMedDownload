it found dna molecules often hooked around obstacles a
u-shaped configuration gel electrophoresis. understand dynamics 
unhooking u-shaped dna molecules undergoing gel electrophoresis, have
examined length changes longer shorter arms u-shape a
function time. two types unhooking found. one type, length
changes arms expontential time different time constants. 
in another type, length changes shorter arm exponential of
the longer one linear time. interpretation extent of
stretch spring-like dna chain decreases length difference between
the two arms increases unhooking processes, frictions 
the pivot point relatively large depending upon local structure the
gel. friction coefficient pivot point estimated nu 0 = (2.98 
+/- 1.42)x10(-5) g/sec.
