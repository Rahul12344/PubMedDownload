equine herpesvirus type 1 (ehv-1) possesses sole, diploid immediate-early (ie) 
gene encodes major regulatory protein 1487 amino acids capable of
modulating expression early late ehv-1 promoters capable of
trans-repressing promoter. study, rabbit kidney cell line
(ie13.1) constitutively expresses ehv-1 ie protein generated by
cotransfection rabbit kidney (rk-13) cells viral ie gene a
neomycin resistance marker. ie protein expressed cell line shown 
(1) expressed localize nucleus virtually cells as
demonstrated indirect immunofluorescence, (2) full-size ie
polypeptide judged western immunoblot analyses anti-ie
protein-specific antibody, (3) functional shown the
transactivation two representative ehv-1 early promoters linked the
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene transient transfection assays.
the ie13.1 cell line able complement recombinant virus both
copies ie gene replaced insertion escherichia coli lacz
gene. ie deletion mutant, designated kyadeltaie, able replicate
in equine, rabbit, mouse cells capable replication ie13.1
cells provided ie protein trans. rescue kyadeltaie virus was
achieved recombination marker plasmid harbors wild-type ie
gene, rescued virus (kyadeltaier) able grow noncomplementary
cells. overall, results offer direct evidence ie gene essential
for ehv-1 replication provide reagents useful analysis ie protein 
function.
