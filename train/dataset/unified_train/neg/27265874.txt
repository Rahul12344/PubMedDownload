although antiretroviral therapy (art) successful controlling hiv
infection, provide permanent cure, requires lifelong treatment, and
hiv-positive individuals left social concerns stigma. recent
application cells treat cancer viral reactivations post-transplant
offers potential strategy control hiv infection. known naturally 
occurring hiv-specific cells inhibit hiv initially, response is
not sustained majority people living hiv. genetically modifying 
cells target hiv, resist infection, persist immunosuppressive
environment found chronically infected hiv-positive individuals might provide 
a therapeutic solution hiv. review focuses successful preclinical
studies current clinical strategies using t-cell therapy control hiv
infection mediate functional cure solution.
