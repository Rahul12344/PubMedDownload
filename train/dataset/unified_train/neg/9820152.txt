recently novel dna virus, designated tt virus (ttv), possibly accounts for
some cases liver disease unknown aetiology, identified in
japanese patients. using specific primer pairs conserved regions, detected
ttv dna pcr 16/84 (19%) german patients awaiting orthotopic liver
transplantation decompensated liver cirrhosis (of diverse causes); 
4/25 (16%) patients non-a-g hepatitis; 1/7 patients autoimmune
hepatitis; one intravenous drug user. sequence analysis showed in
contrast findings japanese patients 37% ttv sequences
belonged genomic group 1 58% belonged group 2, including several 
sequences belonging subgroup tentatively designated group 2c.
further studies clarify whether novel virus hepatitis-inducing
capacity clinical significance needed.
