adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ascs) increasingly studied for
their usefulness regenerative medicine. however, limited life span and
donor-dependent variation primary cells ascs present major hurdles 
controlled reproducible experiments. therefore aimed establish
immortalized asc cell lines provide steady supply homogeneous cells for
in vitro work retain essential features primary cells. end,
combinations human telomerase reverse transcriptase (htert), murine bmi-1, and
sv40 large antigen (sv40t) introduced lentiviral transduction into
ascs. resulting cell lines asc(htert), asc(bmi-1), asc(bmi-1+htert) and
asc(sv40t+htert) tested transgene expression, telomerase activity,
surface immunomarkers, proliferation, osteogenic adipogenic differentiation, 
karyotype, tumorigenicity, cellular senescence. cell lines have
maintained expression characteristic surface immunomarkers, none was
tumorigenic. however, asc(bmi-1) limited replicative potential, the
rapidly proliferating asc(sv40t+htert) acquired chromosomal aberrations, departed
from msc phenotype, lost differentiation capacity. asc(htert) and
asc(htert+bmi-1), hand, preserved essential msc features did
not senesce 100 population doublings. notably, subpopulation of
asc(htert) also acquired aberrant karyotype showed signs transformation
after long-term culture. conclusion, htert alone sufficient extend 
life span human asc, asc(htert) prone transformation during
extensive subculturing. combination bmi-1 htert successfully
immortalized human ascs without significantly perturbing phenotype or
biological behavior.
