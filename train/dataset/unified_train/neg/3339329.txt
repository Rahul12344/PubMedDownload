the morphogenesis yellow fever virus replication examined infected vero
cell cultures. penetration uncoating occurred endocytosis the
formation coated vesicles, similar demonstrated enveloped
and unenveloped viruses. inclusion bodies associated newly formed
nucleocapsids evident perinuclear region growth cycle. 
evidence rna synthesis vicinity inclusion bodies obtained by
autoradiography, suggesting genome replication assembly viral
nucleocapsids occur separate cytoplasmic sites. excessive proliferation 
membrane-bound organelles involving vacuoles endoplasmic reticula was
the striking feature virus-infected cells late infection. no
morphological changes appearance nuclei mitochondria detected. 
virus release appeared occur movement nascent virions the
proliferated endoplasmic reticula followed exocytic fusion virus-containing
vesicles plasmalemma. possible mechanism whereby internal
nucleocapsid acquires outer envelope discussed.
