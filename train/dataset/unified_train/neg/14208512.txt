factors. j. bacteriol. 88:716-726. 1964.-naturally occurring r factors are
classified two types, fi(+) fi(-), depending fi characters. the
term fi abbreviation fertility inhibition fi(-) fi(-) mean,
respectively, presence absence suppression functions sex
factor f escherichia coli k-12. found fi(-) r factors reduce the
efficiency plating phages lambda t(1) k-12; fi(+) r factors 
have inhibitory action. one fi(-) r factors reduced efficiency of
plating phage t(7) well. phages lambda t(1) underwent host-induced
modifications host carrying fi(-) r factors. least two types of
fi(-) r factors recognized types restriction and
host-induced modification phages. cacl(2) exhibited antagonistic actions
against restrictions phages lambda t(1) fi(-) r factors.

reduced fi(-) r factors. ultraviolet induction lambda affected by
any r factors. furthermore, adsorption phages lambda t(1) altered 
by presence r factors. results, concluded the

but fi(+) fi(-) r factors. two different fi(-) r factors were
frequently genetically recombined. fi(+) fi(-) r factors not
genetically recombined, indicated findings independent transfer these
