prevention hiv acquisition replication requires long lasting effective
immunity. given state hiv vaccine development, innovative vectors and
immunization strategies urgently needed generate safe efficacious hiv 
vaccines. here, developed novel lentivirus-based dna vector not
integrate host genome undergoes single-cycle replication. viral
proteins constitutively expressed control tat-independent ltr
promoter goat lentivirus. immunized six macaques with
cal-shiv-in- dna using combined intramuscular intradermal injections plus
electroporation. antigen-specific cell responses monitored 47 weeks
post-immunization (pi). pbmcs assessed directly ex vivo 6 12
days vitro culture using antigenic and/or homeostatic proliferation. ifn-γ 
elispot used measure immediate cytokine secretion antigen specific
effector cells memory precursors high proliferative capacity
(phpc). memory phenotype functions (proliferation, cytokine expression,
lytic content) specific cells tested using multiparametric facs-based
assays. immunized macaques developed lasting peripheral cd8+ cd4+ cell 
responses mainly gag nef antigens. primary expansion
phase, immediate effector cells well increasing numbers proliferating
cells limited effector functions detected expressed markers of
effector (em) central (cm) memory phenotypes. responses contracted 
then reemerged later absence antigen boost. strong phpc responses
comprising vaccine-specific cm em cells readily expanded acquired 
immediate effector functions detected 40/47 weeks pi. altogether, our
study demonstrated single immunization replication-limited dna
vaccine elicited persistent vaccine-specific cm em cd8+ cd4+ cells with
immediate readily inducible effector functions, absence ongoing
antigen expression.
