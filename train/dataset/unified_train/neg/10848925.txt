background: rhinovirus infections airway epithelial cells vitro been
shown upregulate intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1) expression.
epithelial icam-1, dual role major rhinovirus receptor as
adhesion molecule inflammatory cells may involved pathogenesis of
rhinovirus-induced exacerbations asthma.
objective: aimed investigate effect experimental rhinovirus 16
(rv16) infection icam-1 expression bronchial mucosal biopsies asthma. in
addition, effect 2 weeks pretreatment inhaled budesonide (800 microg 
b.d.) rv16-associated changes icam-1 expression studied.
methods: study parallel, placebo-controlled design 25 steroid-naive 
nonsmoking atopic asthmatic subjects. 2 weeks budesonide (bud) placebo
(plac) pretreatment bronchoscopy performed 2 days (day -2) 6 days 
after (day 6) rv16 inoculation (on days 0 1). immunohistochemical staining
for icam-1 performed snap-frozen bronchial biopsies. icam-1 staining
intensity basal epithelial cells scored semiquantitatively 1
(weak) 3 (intense). similarly, epithelial intactness noted (1 = basal
cells only, 2 = basal parabasal cells, 3 = intact epithelium).
results: icam-1 scores significantly different groups day
-2 (p > = 0.08). subsequent rv16 infection associated trend towards
an increase icam-1 expression bud-group (p = 0.07), whereas the
increase significant plac-group (p = 0.03). however, increase 
not significantly different groups (p = 0.74). epithelial intactness 
score different groups rv16 infection (p > = 0.07),
and significant changes observed either group (p > = 0.59).
moreover, icam-1 score correlate significantly epithelium score in
either group, time-point (p > = 0.27).
conclusion: conclude rv16 common cold atopic asthmatic subjects 
associated increased icam-1 expression bronchial epithelium, is
not related epithelial intactness. glucocorticoid treatment appear to
prevent rv16-associated increased icam-1 expression. suggests other
treatment modalities required protect spreading infection
during rhinovirus-induced exacerbations asthma.
