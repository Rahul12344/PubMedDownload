the phenol-soluble proteins leaves healthy viroid-infected plants
were compared separation sds-polyacrylamide gels. staining with
coomassie blue, alterations protein patterns infected plants found
which resulted increase decrease certain protein bands. after
infection viroid, different hosts show characteristic changes in
the protein pattern suggest alterations host-specific rather
than pathogenspecific. infection tomato plants different viroid
"species" protein apparent mw 14,000 (p14 tom) found to
accumulate dramatically. protein also accumulates tomato plants after
viral fungus infections rate accumulation directly related 
to severity symptoms developed diseased plants. assumed,
therefore, response tomato plants infection general.
