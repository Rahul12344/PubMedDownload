purpose review: effective antiretroviral therapy, cardiovascular disease 
has gained importance cause morbidity mortality hiv-infected
persons. review risk cardiovascular disease hiv-infected persons
compared uninfected persons discuss relative contributions
of host, hiv, antiretroviral therapy light current knowledge.
recent findings: incidence cardiovascular disease hiv-infected patients
receiving antiretroviral therapy low. however, risk cardiovascular
disease increased compared uninfected persons. fact is
substantially due higher prevalence underlying traditional cardiovascular
risk factors mostly host dependent. hiv may additionally contribute both
directly immune activation inflammation, indirectly through
immunodeficiency. modest way hiv infection, type of
antiretroviral therapy may also contribute impact metabolic and
body fat parameters, possibly factors currently
unclear.
summary: prevention cardiovascular disease hiv-infected patients 
standard care. traditional risk factors investigated and
aggressively treated possible. antiretroviral therapy initiated
earlier patients high cardiovascular risk. purely cardiovascular
perspective, benefits antiretroviral therapy clearly outweigh any
potential risk.
