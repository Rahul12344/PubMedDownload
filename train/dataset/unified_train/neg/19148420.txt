as many areas brazil, aids epidemic curitiba relatively stable,
but surveillance important support public policy. molecular
characteristics hiv may instrumental monitoring epidemic trends. we
evaluated plasma hiv-1 rna (n = 37) 38 cases presenting positive
serology, among 820 consenting volunteers visiting downtown
counselling serology testing centre. seroprevalence 4.6% (ci 95% 3.2-6.3)
and estimated hiv incidence, defined bed assay, 2.86
persons/years (ci 95% 1.04-4.68). additional set contemporaneous, anonymous
samples local laboratory also analysed (n = 20). regions hiv-1 
polymerase (n = 57) envelope (n = 34) evaluated subtyping,
determination mosaic structure, primary drug resistance mutations (pdrm),
envelope v3 loop motifs amino acid signatures related viral tropism. hiv-1
clade b observed 53% cases; hiv-1c 30% bc mosaics 14%, with
one f genome one cf mosaic. clade c infection associated recent
infections among males (p < 0.03). stanford surveillance pdrm observed in
8.8% sequences, 7% showing high level resistance least one
antiretroviral drug. tropism cxcr4 co-receptor predicted 18% of
envelope sequences, exclusively among clade b genomes cases with
serological reactivity chronic infection.
