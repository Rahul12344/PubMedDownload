a detailed study made nature variables inherent the
chicken red cell agglutination test influenza virus effort obtain 
method measurement biological activity sufficient accuracy might
be employed reliable index chemical purity preparations virus. 
it found temperature test conducted marked
effect titer, whereas within range ph 6-8 ph negligible
effect. also found variation results may encountered due a
variation specific behavior red cells different chickens an
instability red cells themselves. preparations purified influenza virus
held 4 degrees c., hand, found stable respect 
chicken red cell agglutinating activity several months. fact, together
with fact duplicate measurements upon different samples accuracy 
was chances 19 20 differences 8.4 per cent in
the mean end points significant, made possible establish a
reproducible standard cca activity based unit weight purified virus
material. result, possible devise standardized procedure for
carrying high accuracy quantitative measurements influenza virus.
