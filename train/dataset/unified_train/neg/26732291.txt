this study aimed evaluate use routinely collected reproductive milk
production data early detection emerging vector-borne diseases in
cattle netherlands flanders region belgium (i.e., northern 
part belgium). prospective space-time cluster analyses residuals a
model milk production carried detect clusters reduced milk
yield. cusum algorithm used detect temporal aberrations model
residuals reproductive performance models two indicators gestation
length. bluetongue serotype-8 (btv-8) epidemics 2006 2007 the
schmallenberg virus (sbv) epidemic 2011 used case studies evaluate 
the sensitivity timeliness methods. methods investigated this
study result timely detection btv-8 sbv the
netherlands btv-8 belgium given surveillance systems place when
these viruses emerged. could due (i) large geographical units used
in analyses (country, region province level), (ii) high level 
sensitivity surveillance systems place viruses emerged.
nevertheless, might worthwhile use syndromic surveillance system based
on non-specific animal health data real-time alongside regular surveillance,
to increase sense urgency provide valuable quantitative information
for decision makers initial phase emerging disease outbreak.
