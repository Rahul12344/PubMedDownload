background: polymyositis (pm) dermatomyositis (dm) associated high
risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma (npc) asian countries. epstein-barr virus
(ebv) might induce autoimmunity malignancies susceptible individuals.
objectives: investigate association ebv pm/dm npc pm/dm
patients.
study design: serum levels anti-ebv viral capsid antigens (vca) and
anti-ebv-coded nuclear antigens-1 (ebna-1) antibodies measured elisa, and
ebv dna loads determined using real-time pcr 98 pm/dm patients, 94
systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) patients 370 healthy controls (hc).
anti-transfer-rna synthetase antibodies (asa) determined by
radioimmunoprecipitation pm/dm patients.
results: thirteen (13.3%) pm/dm patients vs. none sle patients had
detectable npc. asa detectable 31.7% pm/dm without malignancy, while
lack asa pm/dm patient npc. iga anti-ebna-1 detectable in
30.6% pm/dm patients 31.9% sle patients, 4.1% hc (odds
ratio [or] 10.44 11.12 respectively, p<0.001). significantly higher
positivity iga anti-ebna-1 observed pm/dm npc those
without malignancy (or 44.7, p<0.01). significantly higher positivity ebv
genome observed pm/dm npc without malignancy (or 43.9,
p<0.01), sle patients (or 13.2, p<0.05) hc (or 99.4, p<0.001). ebv dna 
loads significantly higher pm/dm npc compared without
malignancy hc.
conclusions: results showed positive association ebv pm/dm npc.
pm/dm patients iga anti-ebna-1 increased ebv dna loads be
highly suspected occult npc.
