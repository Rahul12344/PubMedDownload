cardiotoxicity main dose-limiting side effect doxorubicin the
clinic. free radical producer, doxorubicin affects heart specifically
because low antioxidant capacity. among antioxidants, catalase is
present low levels heart compared organs. since catalase 
is essential enzyme detoxifying hydrogen peroxide, aim present
study investigate protective effect catalase delivered an
adenovirus vector doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity cultured neonatal
rat cardiac myocytes (nercams). 7-monohydroxyethylrutoside (monoher), potent
cardioprotector currently clinical investigations, included the
study reference. neonatal rat cardiac myocytes infected different 
multiplicity infections (mois) adenovirus encoding catalase (adcat). a
control infection adenovirus vector encoding nonrelated protein was
included. activity content catalase infected cells determined 
during 3 days postinfection. one group nercams infected adcat 
treatment doxorubicin (0-50 microm). second third group treated
with doxorubicin (0-50 microm) without 1 mm monohydroxyethylrutoside
(monoher), respectively. ldh release viability treated cells were
measured 24 48 h doxorubicin treatment. beating rate followed
in three groups cells receiving treatments within 3 days 
doxorubicin (0-100 microm) treatment. catalase activity increased in
adcat-infected cells, different mois, starting second day after
infection compared mock-infected cells (p<0.03). third day of
infection, moi 50 caused cytopathic effects, hampered the
use higher viral titres. moi 50, catalase activity increased
3.5-fold adcat-infected cells 3 days postinfection (p=0.021) compared to
mock-infected cells. beating rate survival nercams decreased a
concentration time-dependent manner doxorubicin treatment (p<0.0005).
this cytotoxicity associated increase ldh release the
treated cells (p<0.0005). cells stopped beating 24 h treatment >50
microm doxorubicin. 3.5-fold increase activity catalase not
protect nercams cytotoxic effects doxorubicin nercams.
in contrast, monoher (1 mm) significantly protected nercams lethal
effects doxorubicin survival, ldh release beating rate of
nercams (p<0.004) 48 h doxorubicin treatment. protection
resulted prolongation beating doxorubicin-treated cells 
end experiment (i.e. >72 h). present study (1) illustrates the
cytotoxicity high moi adcat (>50) limited possibility increase
catalase activity 3.5-fold, enough protect infected
nercams doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (2) confirms efficacy 
of monoher cardioprotector. thus, use monoher proves suitable
for prevention doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity catalase gene
transfer employing adenovirus vectors.
