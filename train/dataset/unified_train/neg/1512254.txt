candida albicans cryptococcus neoformans major causes systemic fungal 
infections, particularly patients acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
metabolic labeling studies revealed organisms synthesize small
number n-myristoylproteins, prominent 20-kda adp-ribosylation
factors (arfs). c. albicans arf approximately 80% identity essential

with oxygen -ch2- substitutions c4, c6, c11, c13 incorporated into
cellular n-myristoylproteins, phospholipids, neutral lipids produced these
