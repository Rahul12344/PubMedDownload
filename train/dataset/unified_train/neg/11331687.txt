objective: determine effect varying dosing schedules predictor
variables seroprotection rates geometric mean titer levels resulting
from hepatitis b vaccination series among adolescents.
methods: adolescents received hepatitis b vaccination series varying
schedules according natural adherence patterns. data collected included 
participants' medication use; chronic illness; use cigarettes, alcohol, and
marijuana; age; race/ethnicity; body mass index. participants' dates of
vaccinations recorded titer levels hepatitis b surface antibody were
drawn ~12 24 months study enrollment. data 498 participants
were analyzed using chi(2) tests, student tests, logistic regression models,
and analysis variance.
results: seroprotection rates among adolescents affected late
vaccinations. factors affecting achievement seroprotection ~12
and 24 months first vaccination body mass index number 
immunizations received. increased time doses 1 2 doses 2 3
showed trend toward correlating increasing titer levels.
conclusions: although adolescents risk acquiring hepatitis b receive
the hepatitis b vaccination series timely fashion, late doses not
detrimental, may beneficial, achieving high antibody levels the
hepatitis b virus.
