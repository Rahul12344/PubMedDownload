amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) fatal neurodegenerative disease caused
by progressive loss upper lower motor neurons. mutations superoxide
dismutase 1 (sod1) leading cause als, responsible 20% of
familial cases. although exact mechanism mutant sod1 causes disease 
remains unknown, multiple studies shown reduction mutant species
leads delayed disease onset extension lifespan animal models. this
makes sod1 ideal target gene therapy coupling adeno associated virus
vector (aav) gene delivery rnai molecules. review summarize the
studies done thus far attempting decrease sod1 gene expression, using aav
vectors delivery tools, rnai therapeutic molecules. current hurdles 
be overcome, need widespread gene delivery entire
central nervous system (cns), discussed. continued efforts improve current
aav delivery methods capsids accelerate application these
therapeutics clinic.
