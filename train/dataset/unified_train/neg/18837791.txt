summary: vaccines vaccination emerged past two decades as
essential tools avian influenza (ai) control poultry, they
increase resistance infection, prevent illness death, reduce virus
replication shed respiratory alimentary tracts, reduce virus
transmission birds mammals, including humans. protection birds 
primarily mediated homosubtypic humoral immunity hemagglutinin
protein, cell-mediated innate immunity contribute protection some
bird species. immune response neuraminidase protein contribute 
protection, immunity viral internal proteins generally not
protective. although, preliminary studies m2e protein chickens
suggest partial protection may achievable. historically, h5 subtype ai
vaccines demonstrated broad homosubtypic protection, primarily h5
high-pathogenicity (hp) ai viruses isolated early stages outbreaks.
however, h5 viruses become endemic outbreaks prolonged, drift
variants resistance earlier h5 ai vaccines emerged central
america, china, egypt, indonesia. widespread drift variants will
remain unknown detailed genetic antigenic analyses conducted
on field isolates. future vaccines utilize biotechnology produce new ai
vaccine seed strains using ha genes closely matching circulating field
viruses. addition, newer technologies ai vaccines improve vaccine
coverage using mass application technologies example drinking water, by
spray, via injection ovo hatchery.
