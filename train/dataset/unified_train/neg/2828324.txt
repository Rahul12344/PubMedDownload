the spovh locus, involved sporulation bacillus subtilis, cloned 
derivatives temperate bacteriophage luminal diameter 105. two recombinant 
phages obtained contained 4.2 kilobases chromosomal dna. both
phages partially complemented mutation spovh operon, spovh516.
nevertheless, analysis cloned locus integrational plasmids showed
that complete operon cloned. spovh'-lacz transcriptional fusion
was constructed, indicated spovh operon expressed 2.25 h
after start sporulation. distribution beta-galactosidase in
sporulating cells containing spovh'-lacz fusion showed spovh expressed
in spore compartment; lac fusion experiments also used study spovh
expression presence sporulation mutations. expression spovh
was prevented mutations stage 0 stage ii loci also by
mutations spoiiia, spoiiib, spoiiie. similar pattern dependence was
found previously expression spova, also expressed the
spore compartment.
