a nonradioactive, biotinylated herpes simplex virus (hsv) dna probe, shell vial
(rabbit kidney cell) culture assay enhanced direct fluorescent (hsv
monoclonal)-antibody stain 16 20 h postinoculation, conventional tube
cultures confirmation via hsv-specific (polyclonal antibody)
immunoperoxidase assay compared 199 specimens. predictive values 
the positive results 54.5% probe, 95.9% shell vial assay,
and 100% conventional culture methods, predictive values the
negative tests 68.1, 84.0, 98.4%, respectively. conclude dna
probe (sensitivity, 24.5%; specificity, 88.3%) shell vial assay
(sensitivity, 66.2%; specificity, 98.4%) cannot substituted conventional
tube culture techniques (sensitivity, 97.1%; specificity, 100%) routine
identification hsv laboratory.
