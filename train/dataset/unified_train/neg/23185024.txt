filoviruses, marburgvirus (marv) ebolavirus (ebov), causative agents of
highly lethal hemorrhagic fever humans. marv ebov share common genome
organization show important differences replication complex formation,
cell entry, host tropism, transcriptional regulation, immune evasion.
multifunctional filoviral viral protein (vp) 35 proteins inhibit innate immune
responses. recent studies suggest double-stranded (ds)rna sequestration a
potential mechanism allows ebov vp35 antagonize retinoic-acid inducible
gene-i (rig-i) like receptors (rlrs) activated viral
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps), double-strandedness and
dsrna blunt ends. here, show marv vp35 inhibit ifn production at
multiple steps signaling pathways downstream rlrs. crystal
structure marv vp35 iid complex 18-bp dsrna reveals despite the
similar protein fold ebov vp35 iid, marv vp35 iid interacts dsrna
backbone blunt ends. functional studies show marv vp35 can
inhibit dsrna-dependent rlr activation interferon (ifn) regulatory factor 3
(irf3) phosphorylation ifn kinases traf family member-associated nfkb
activator (tank) binding kinase-1 (tbk-1) ifn kb kinase e (ikke) in
cell-based studies. also show marv vp35 inhibit rig-i and
melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (mda5) activation double
strandedness rna pamps (coating backbone) unable inhibit activation 
of rlrs dsrna blunt ends (end capping). contrast, ebov vp35 inhibit
activation pamps. insights differential pamp recognition and
inhibition ifn induction similar filoviral vp35 fold, shown here,
reveal structural functional plasticity highly conserved virulence
