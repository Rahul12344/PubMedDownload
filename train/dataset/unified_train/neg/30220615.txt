rate postexposure interventions 13% 2008 92.6% 2016 (p < .0001; 
χ2 = 82.866). nsi rates also show number applications nsis
increased years. occupational blood exposure examined, the
number bloodborne pathogens 50 (9.3%) cases hepatitis b virus, 30
(5.6%) cases hepatitis c virus, 3 cases crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever, 1
