influenza virus infections cause yearly epidemics major cause lower 
respiratory tract illnesses humans worldwide. influenza virus long been
recognized associated higher morbidity mortality diabetic
patients. vaccination effective tool prevent influenza virus infection
in group patients. vaccines employing recombinant-dna technologies an
alternative inactivated virus live attenuated virus vaccines. internal
highly conserved viral nucleoprotein (np) delivered dna vaccine to
provide heterosubtypic immunity, offering resistance various influenza
virus strains. study, investigated efficacy np dna vaccine
for induction cell-mediated immune responses protection influenza 
virus infection mouse model diabetes. healthy diabetic balb/c mice
were immunized days 0, 14, 28 injection np dna vaccine. two weeks
after last immunization, cellular immune response evaluated gamma 
interferon (ifn-gamma), lymphocyte proliferation, cytotoxicity assays. the
mice challenged influenza virus, viral titers lungs were
measured day 4. diabetic mice showed significantly smaller amounts of
ifn-gamma production, lymphocyte proliferation, cytotoxicity responses than
nondiabetic mice. furthermore, higher titers influenza virus detected
after challenge lungs diabetic mice. present data suggest 
the np dna vaccine protocol immunization described able
to induce efficient cellular immune responses influenza virus infection
in diabetic mice.
