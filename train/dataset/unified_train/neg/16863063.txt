a total 114 male chickens three sire families commercial cross of
white leghorn chickens infected rb-1b marek's disease (md) virus 21 
days age exposing chickens previously inoculated md virus. the
presence virus feather tips, feather pulp, md viral antibodies
indicated chickens became infected. first virus-positive chickens were
observed 12 days postexposure (dpe). frequency reached maximum 27 dpe
and decreased. 80 dpe, experiment terminated, viral dna
was detected feather pulp surviving chickens (82%). death md
was first observed 38 dpe reached 18% end experiment, with
spleen lesions major md lesion. viral genome titers spleen
extracts chickens md lesions negatively correlated time of
death, and, similar feather pulp, none surviving chickens virus
positive end experiment. quantization viral genome titers in
feather tip extracts 27 38 dpe revealed positive correlation the
presence md lesions, declining phase (38 dpe) the
peak (27 dpe) viral titer. sire effects significant, indicating the
presence genetic factors affect viral proliferation. again, significance 
was observed 38 dpe 27 dpe. results indicate that, this
commercial line, 1) chickens susceptible infection via contact
exposure, 2) surviving chickens recovered viral infection, 3) it
is sufficient measure viral titers single time point using viral
titers endpoint md susceptibility.
