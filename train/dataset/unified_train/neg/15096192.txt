polymorphism amongst human leucocyte antigen (hla) class ii genes could
influence antigen presentation ability control human immunodeficiency 
virus (hiv)-1 modulating virus specific cd4 immune response. examine
the effect polymorphisms disease progression, studied cohort of
46 hiv-1 infected long-term non-progressors (ltnps), 87 intermediate progressors 
(ips) 26 rapid progressors. kaplan-meier survival analysis patients in
the cohort time cd4 count less 350 cells/ micro l, showed trend
for slower rate cd4 decline patients with, compared without, the
drb1*15-dqb1*06 haplotype (hazard ratio (hr) 0.69, 95% ci 0.46-1.01, p = 0.06). a
similar effect observed drb1*13-dqb1*06 haplotype (hr 1.18, 95% 
ci 0.75-1.88, p = 0.46), observed dqb1*06 alleles considered
irrespective dr association (hr 0.74, 95% ci 0.52-1.05, p = 0.06). major
hla-dq6 alleles encode aspartate (asp) position 57 dqbeta chain, a
phenotype associated protection immune disorders. therefore
examined frequency dqbeta57 asp+ alleles, could detect a
significant effect rate cd4 decline. examine whether genotype
associated slower cd4 decline over-represented patients slow
rate disease progression, conducted categorical analysis subset of
patients extended follow-up 14+years. found higher proportion 
ltnps 14+ years possessed drb1*15-dqb1*06 haplotype compared ips 14+
years (38.46 versus 18.18%), though difference reach statistical
significance. dqb1*06 alleles irrespective dr association were
considered, protective effect greater (76.9% ltnps versus 18.18% ips, p =
0.04). results highlight potential protective effect hla dqb1*06
alleles course hiv disease.
