the orf5-encoded major envelope glycoprotein (gp5) porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) one three major structural proteins 
of virus. porcine convalescent sera monoclonal antibodies
directed gp4 gp5 capacity neutralize virus vitro, 
the protein specificity porcine neutralizing sera yet been
established. dna immunization plasmid encoding gp5 prrsv, the
control human cytomegalovirus promoter, induced anti-gp5-specific
neutralizing antibodies pigs balb/c mice. gp5 protein specificity of
neutralizing sera confirmed immunoblotting elisa. peripheral blood
mononuclear cells obtained dna-vaccinated pigs underwent blastogenic
transformation presence e. coli-expressed recombinant orf5-encoded
protein, indicating specificity cellular immune response gp5.
following massive intratracheal challenge virulent iaf-klop strain 
prrsv, dna-vaccinated pigs protected generalized viraemia the
development typical macroscopic lung lesions observed in
unvaccinated, virus-challenged controls, well pigs immunized
with e. coli-expressed gst-orf5 recombinant fusion protein. interstitial
pneumonitis broncho-alveolitis remarkably milder dna-vaccinated
animals. results suggest gp5 prrsv good candidate a
subunit recombinant-type vaccine.
