to determine whether similar dissimilar molecular features class i
molecules involved presentation structurally distinct peptides, 
have investigated influence different pockets hla-a2.1 molecule 
the presentation three different viral peptides. htlv-i tax peptide 12-19,
hcmv gb 619-628, influenza m1 58-66 minimal peptides induce
hla-a2.1-restricted noncross-reactive ctl. detailed analysis structural 
features hla-a2.1 involved peptide presentation undertaken
using panel 11 hla-a2 mutants single amino acid substitutions within
pockets present peptide binding site. nine 11 mutants affected
presentation three peptides, whereas two mutants had
negative effects presentation two viral peptides. these
results indicate common structural features hla-a2 determine binding 
of different peptides, help provide plausible explanation how
structurally diverse peptides bind hla-a2.
