a dna vaccine foot mouth disease (fmd) based mannosylated chitosan
nanoparticles evaluated guinea pigs. dna construct comprised of
fmd virus full length-vp1 gene outer membrane protein (omp a) gene of
salmonella typhimurium toll-like receptor (tlr)-ligand pvac vector.
groups guinea pigs immunized either intramuscularly intra-nasally were
evaluated induction virus neutralizing antibodies, th1(igg2) th2
(igg1) responses, lymphocyte proliferation, reactive nitrogen intermediate
production, secretory iga naso-mucosal immune response protection upon
homotypic type virulent fmd virus challenge. results indicate the
synergistic effect ompa immunogenic potential fmd dna vaccine
construct delivered using mannosylated chitosan nano-particles different
routes administration. observations suggest substantial improvement 
in immunological parameters enhanced protection guinea pigs.
