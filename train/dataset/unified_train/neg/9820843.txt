the occurrence subclinical reactivation varicella-zoster virus (vzv) in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) immunocompetent subjects >60 years
old without signs vzv-caused illnesses, immunocompromised
patients investigated. altogether, 223 samples tested nested orf 63
pcr assay. addition, positive samples tested orf 14, orf 29 and
orf 63 pcr assays, well orf 63 orf 68 nucleic acid sequence-based
amplification assays. 5 samples, vzv-specific dna, transcripts, could
be detected. three belonged group >60-year-olds, 1 hiv
positive, treated chemotherapy. results confirm 
observation authors subclinical reactivation occurs both
immunocompromised healthy individuals. failure detect dna samples
taken 2 individuals several weeks later excludes long-lasting infection of
vzv pbmc.
