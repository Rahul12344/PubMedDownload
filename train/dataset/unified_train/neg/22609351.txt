miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine, hepc), first orally active drug
successful leishmaniasis, especially active visceral form of
the disease. resistance mechanisms almost exclusively associated to
dysfunction hepc uptake systems. order evade requirements its
cognate receptor/translocator, hepc-resistant leishmania donovani parasites (r40 
strain) challenged constructs consisting ω-thiol-functionalized
hepc analogue conjugated cell-penetrating peptide (cpp) tat(48-60), either
through disulfide thioether bond. conjugates enter kill both
promastigote intracellular amastigote forms r40 strain. intracellular 
release hepc reduction disulfide-based conjugate confirmed by
means double tagging cpp (quasar 670) hepc (bodipy) moieties. 
scission conjugate, however, mandatory, metabolically more
stable thioether conjugate retained substantial activity. disulfide conjugate
is highly active bloodstream form trypanosoma b. brucei, naturally
resistant hepc. results provide proof-of-mechanism use cpp
conjugates avert drug resistance faulty drug accumulation parasites, 
well possibility extend chemotherapy parasites intrinsically
devoid membrane translocation systems.
