objective: determine whether transfusion-transmitted virus (ttv) is
hepatotropic.
methods: total dna extracted various tissues 5 experimentally
infected rhesus monkeys viremic period. dot hybridization done
with viral double stranded dna probes single antisense probes.
results: double-stranded probe hybridized dna liver, bone
marrow, spleen,stomach, small intestine colon. single-stranded antisense 
probe hybridized dna liver, small intestine bone marrow 
all 5 monkeys, tissues.
conclusions: viral genome negative polarity, plus-stranded
fragment identified study might replicative intermediate, was
only demonstrated liver, small intestine, bone marrow dot blot
hybridization single-stranded antisense probes. suggested ttv
replicates liver, bone marrow small intestine, ttv might be
hepatotropic.
