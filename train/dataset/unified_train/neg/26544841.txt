background: estimated annual rotavirus-related mortality among
children 5 years old egypt 2004 30 deaths per 100 000, out
of estimated 2616 deaths, 3.9% rotavirus infection. aim of
this article study epidemiology circulating genotypes of
rotaviruses cairo 2011 2012.
materials methods: total 197 stool samples collected 130
inpatient children cairo university children hospital 67 outpatient
children al-saff children clinic. collected stool samples then
screened rotavirus using enzyme immunoassay, followed screening for
g-type p-type using rt-pcr, confirmation sequence analysis.
results: rotavirus detected 39.1% (77/197) children, higher 
rate inpatients (43.9%, 57/130) outpatients (29.9%, 20/67). 
an increase rotavirus infection winter season. majority of
rotavirus cases (85.7%) occurred first year life. predominant
genotypes identified study g3p[8] (37.7%) g1p[8] (19.5%),
but uncommon genotypes g1p[6] (3.9%), g9p[6] (1.3%), g8p[14] (1.3%), g12p[6] 
(2.6%) also detected.
conclusion recommendations: change genotype distribution, compared
with previous studies, along high burden rotavirus-associated
diarrhea among egyptian children 2 years old, emphasizes importance 
continuing strain surveillance need developing introducing
rotavirus vaccine egypt.
