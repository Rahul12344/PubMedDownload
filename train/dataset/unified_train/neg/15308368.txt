swine influenza virus (siv), subtype h3n2, recent reassortant virus that
emerged 1998 north american swine causing severe respiratory and
reproductive disease. study, two replication-defective adenovirus
recombinants developed potential vaccines h3n2 influenza viruses.
three groups 3-week-old pigs (10 pigs per group) vaccinated
intramuscularly (im) recombinants; one group vaccinated the
recombinant adenovirus expressing influenza virus h3 hemagglutinin (ha)
protein, one group vaccinated recombinant adenovirus expressing 
nucleoprotein (np), one group vaccinated recombinants a
mixture. two additional control groups (10 pigs per group) included the
animal trial. one control group challenged virulent h3n2 field strain 
and one control group remained unchallenged. results showed pigs 
groups given recombinant adenovirus expressing ha alone ha plus np
developed high levels virus-specific hemagglutination-inhibition (hi) antibody
by 4 weeks post vaccination. pigs group vaccinated recombinant
viruses mixture completely protected. complete protection shown 
the lack nasal shedding virus following challenge lack lung
lesions 1 week following challenge infection. thus,
replication-incompetent adenovirus vaccines given simultaneously pigs are
efficacious siv additional advantage commercial vaccines
that suckling piglets pre-existing maternally-derived antibody block
early life vaccination.
