during july-october 2017 wnv outbreak took place peloponnese, southern
greece five confirmed deaths. routine monitoring survey the
peloponnese, supported local prefecture, confirmed presence of
all three culex pipiens biotypes region, high percentage culex
pipiens/molestus hybrids (37.0%) considered highly competent vector
of wnv. kdr mutations related pyrethroid resistance found relatively
low levels (14.3% homozygosity) mosquitoes harboring recently
identified chitin synthase diflubenzuron-resistance mutations detected in
the region. immediate action, following disease outbreak (within days),
we collected large number mosquitoes using co2 cdc traps villages
in argolis area peloponnese, high incidence wnv human
infections reported. wnv lineage 2 detected 3 47 cx. pipiens
mosquito pools (detection rate = 6.38%). virus detected 
mosquito species, aedes albopictus, sampled region time
of disease outbreak. results show detection wnv lineage 2 cx. 
pipiens pools spatially chronologically associated human clinical
cases, thus implicating cx. pipiens mosquitoes likely wnv vector. the
absence diflubenzuron resistance mutations low frequency pyrethroid
(kdr) resistance mutations indicates suitability insecticides for
cx. pipiens control, format larvicides and/or residual spraying
applications respectively, indeed main (evidence based) response,
following disease outbreak.
