background: human apolipoprotein e (apoe) exists three major isoforms: apoe2, 
apoe3 apoe4. brain, apoe produced mostly astrocytes and
transports cholesterol neurons via apoe receptors. among gene alleles
encoding three isoforms, apoe4 allele strongest genetic risk
factor late-onset alzheimer's disease (ad), whereas apoe2 protective.
apoe4 confers gain toxic function, loss neuroprotective function a
combination ad pathogenesis. given therapeutic impacts of
modulating apoe expression may isoform-dependent, sought investigate the
relationship overexpressing apoe isoform apoe-related functions in
apoe-targeted replacement (tr) mice. specifically, apoe isoform expression driven
by astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap) promoter was
built adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (aav8) vector injected into
the ventricles postnatal day 2 (p2) apoe3-tr apoe4-tr mice. upon
confirmation apoe isoform expression, effects apoe lipidation the
levels amyloid-β (aβ) brain assessed.
results: aav8-gfap-apoe isoforms specifically expressed astrocytes
throughout brain regions, led overall increased apoe levels the
brain. viral mediated overexpression apoe4 apoe4-tr background
increased poorly-lipidated apoe lipoprotein particles decreased
apoe-associated cholesterol apoe4-tr mice. conversely, apoe2 overexpression in
apoe4-tr mice enhanced apoe lipidation associated cholesterol. furthermore,
overexpression apoe4 elevated levels endogenous aβ, whereas apoe2
overexpression trended lower endogenous aβ.
conclusions: overexpression apoe isoforms induces differential effects 
apoe4-tr background: apoe4 decreases apoe lipidation enhances aβ
accumulation, whereas apoe2 opposite effects. findings suggest that
increasing apoe2 apoe4 carriers beneficial strategy treat ad, whereas 
increasing apoe4 apoe4 carriers likely harmful. also established
novel methods express apoe isoforms mouse brain study apoe-related
pathways ad related dementia.
