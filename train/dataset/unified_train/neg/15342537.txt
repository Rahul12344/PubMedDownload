the impact adaptation persistence balanced polymorphism was
explored using lactose operon escherichia coli model system.
competition chemostats two substitutable resources, methylgalactoside 
lactulose, generates stabilizing frequency-dependent selection two different
naturally isolated lac operons (td2 td10) used. fate balanced
polymorphism tracked evolutionary time monitoring frequency of
fhua-, linked neutral genetic marker confers resistance the
bacteriophage t5. four nine chemostats lac polymorphism persisted
for 400-600 generations experiments terminated. five
chemostats fhua polymorphism, consequently lac operon polymorphism,
was lost 86 219 generations. four 13 chemostat cultures
monomorphic lac operon retained neutral fhua polymorphism 450-550
generations terminated; remainder became monomorphic fhua 
between 63 303 generations. specialists galactoside isolated
from chemostats maintained fhua polymorphism, whether polymorphic or
monomorphic lac operon. strains isolated three four chemostats 
which lac polymorphism preserved switched galactoside
preference. chemostats fhua polymorphism lost also
contained specialists. results demonstrate initial polymorphism at
lac little consequence outcome long-term adaptive evolution.
instead, fitnesses evolved strains dominated mutations arising
elsewhere genome, fact confirmed showing operons isolated from
their evolved backgrounds alone unable explain presence both
specialists. results suggest that, stabilized, ecological specialization
prevented selective sweeps entire population, thereby promoting the
maintenance linked neutral polymorphisms.
