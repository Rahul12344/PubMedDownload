background: dengue, mosquito-borne febrile viral disease, found tropical 
and sub-tropical regions extending range temperate regions. the
spread dengue viruses mainly depends vector population (aedes aegypti
and aedes albopictus), influenced changing climatic conditions and
various land-use/land-cover types. spatial display relationship between
dengue vector density land-cover types required describe near-future 
viral outbreak scenario. study aimed exploring land-cover types
are linked behavior dengue-transmitting mosquitoes.
methods: surveys conducted 92 villages phitsanulok province thailand. 
the sampling conducted three separate occasions months march,
may july. dengue indices, i.e. container index (c.i.), house index (h.i.) and
breteau index (b.i.) used map habitats conducible dengue vector
growth. spatial epidemiological analysis using bivariate pearson's correlation
was conducted evaluate level interdependence larval density and
land-use types. factor analysis using principal component analysis (pca) with
varimax rotation performed ascertain variance among land-use types.
furthermore, spatial ring method used visualize spatially referenced,
multivariate temporal data single information graphic.
results: results dengue indices showed settlements around gasoline
stations/workshops, vicinity marsh/swamp rice paddy appeared 
favorable habitat dengue vector propagation highly significant and
positive correlation (p = 0.001) month may. settlements around the
institutional areas highly significant positively correlated (p = 0.01) 
with h.i. month march. moreover, dengue indices month march
showed significant positive correlation (p <= 0.05) deciduous forest. 
the h.i. people living around horticulture land significantly and
positively correlated (p = 0.05) month may, perennial
vegetation showed highly significant positive correlation (p = 0.001) in
the month march c.i. significant positive correlation (p <= 0.05)
with b.i., respectively.
conclusions: study concluded gasoline stations/workshops, rice paddy,
marsh/swamp deciduous forests played highly significant role dengue vector
growth. thus, spatio-temporal relationships dengue vector larval density
and land-use types may help predict favorable dengue habitat, thereby
enables public healthcare managers take precautionary measures prevent
impending dengue outbreak.
