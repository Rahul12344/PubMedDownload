the acoustic biological sensor analysis bacterial cells in
conducting suspension developed. sensor represented two channel delay
line based piezoelectric plate y-x lithium niobate thick 0.2mm. two 
pairs interdigital transducers (idt) excitation reception of
shear horizontal acoustic wave zero order (sh0) channel deposited
by method photolithography. one channel delay line electrically
shorted deposition thin aluminum film idts. second channel 
remained electrically open. liquid container volume 5ml was
fixed plate surface idts glue, cause the
additional insertion loss. first time influence conductivity
of cell suspension registration specific nonspecific
interactions bacterial cells phage-antibodies (phage-abs) studied
by means developed sensor. dependencies change insertion
loss phase output signal conductivity buffer solution at
specific/nonspecific interactions electrically open shorted channels 
of delay line obtained. shown sensor successfully
registered interactions microbial cells phage-abs range the
conductivity 2-20 μs/cm model samples a. brasilense sp245 - specific
phage-abs. sensor time regime operation fast reacted the
specific/nonspecific interaction time stabilization output 
parameters exceed 10min.
