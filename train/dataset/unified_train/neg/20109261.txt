this study assessed changes prevalence distribution hiv-1 non-subtype b
viruses italian immigrant patients two decades province in
italy. hiv-positive patients underwent genotypic resistance testing 
selected. prevalence non-subtype b viruses 3-year periods calculated.
all sequences non-subtype b provided rega unassigned were
analysed phylogenetic relationships. total, 250/1563 (16%) individuals
were infected non-subtype b virus. prevalence increased time,
reaching peak (31.5%) 2004-2006. italian patients, frequent
subtypes b (92.5%) f1 (4%). f1 subtype also prevalent patients
from south america (13.6%); patients african origin, crf02_ag (54.9%) g
(12.3%) frequent. hiv-1 non-subtype b infections italians were
mostly found patients acquired hiv sexually. phylogenetic relationship
between f subtypes italian representative hiv-1 sequences brazil 
found. c subtypes italians phylogenetically related subtypes
circulating brazil. inter-subtype recombinants also found latest
years. hiv-1 epidemic brescia province evolved point about
1/3 patients recently diagnosed harboured non-b hiv subtypes. distribution of
hiv-1 non-b subtypes italian patients resembled south american
patients phylogenetic relatedness italian south american
hiv-1 strains found. possible epidemiological link two
populations would missed looking risk factors hiv
acquisition declared patients. evidence inter-subtype recombinants
points significant genetic assortment. overall results support
phylogenetic analysis tool epidemiological investigation order to
guide targeted prevention strategies.
