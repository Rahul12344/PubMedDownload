relaxin-3 neuropeptide abundantly expressed discrete brainstem
neuron populations broadly innervate forebrain areas rich relaxin-3
g-protein-coupled-receptor, rxfp3. acute subchronic central administration of
synthetic relaxin-3 rxfp3-selective agonist peptide, r3/i5, increase
feeding body weight rats. intrahypothalamic injection relaxin-3 also
increases feeding. study, developed recombinant adeno-associated
virus 1/2 (raav1/2) vector drives expression constitutive secretion of
bioactive r3/i5 assessed effect intrahypothalamic injections daily 
food intake body weight gain adult male rats 8 weeks. vitro
testing revealed vector raav1/2-fibronectin (fib)-r3/i5 directs the
constitutive secretion bioactive r3/i5 peptide. bilateral injection of
raav1/2-fib-r3/i5 vector paraventricular nucleus produced increase in
daily food intake body weight gain (p<0.01, ~23%, respectively), relative 
control treatment. separate cohort rats, quantitative polymerase chain
reaction analysis hypothalamic mrna revealed strong expression r3/i5
transgene 3 months post-raav1/2-fib-r3/i5 infusion. levels mrna transcripts
for relaxin-3 receptor rxfp3, hypothalamic 'feeding' peptides
neuropeptide y, agrp pomc, reproductive hormone, gnrh, all
similar control, whereas vasopressin oxytocin (ot) mrna levels were
reduced ~25% (p=0.051) ~50% (p<0.005), respectively, in
raav1/2-fib-r3/i5-treated rats (at 12 weeks, n=9/8 rats per group). data
demonstrate first time r3/i5 effective modulating feeding in
the rat chronic hypothalamic rxfp3 activation suggest potential
underlying mechanism involving altered ot signalling. importantly, no
desensitization feeding response treatment period apparent
deleterious health effects, indicating targeting relaxin-3-rxfp3 system 
may effective long-term therapy eating disorders.
