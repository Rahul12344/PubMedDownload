the coding region avian reovirus s1133 genomic segment s4, encoding non
structural protein sigmans, inserted expression vector pet28a the
protein expressed escherichia coli bl21(de3) fusion protein
containing c-terminal peptide six tandem histidines (his-tag). the
expressed protein (esigmans) consistent expected molecular size the
avian reovirus protein sigmans synthesized infected cells readily purified
by his-bind resin. esigmans confirmed indistinguishable
from viral sigmans immunoblot analysis. esigmans binds 32p-labeled ssrna
probe produced run-off transcription clone pgem-3zf(+)s4. binding
activity blocked heterologous yeast rrna, homologous avian
reovirus dsrna heterologous infectious bursal disease virus dsrna salmon 
sperm dsdna. therefore, ssrna-binding activity expressed protein
sigmans non sequence-specific, similar previously described viral 
sigmans purified avian reovirus infected cell extracts. addition, the
recent data also show optimal salt (nacl) concentration ph its
binding 100-150 mm 7.0, respectively, terms uv cross-linking
and rnase treatment reaction mixtures prior denaturing gel
analysis.
