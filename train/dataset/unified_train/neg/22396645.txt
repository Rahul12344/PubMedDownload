vaccination highly effective preventing various infectious diseases,
whereas constant threat new emerging pathogens necessitates the
development innovative vaccination principles also confer rapid
protection case emergency. although increasing evidence points cell 
immunity playing critical role vaccination viral diseases, vaccine
efficacy mostly associated induction antibody responses. we
analyze immunological mechanism(s) rapidly protective vaccinia virus
immunization using mousepox surrogate model human smallpox. found 
fast protection lethal systemic poxvirus disease solely depended cd4
and cd8 cell responses induced vaccination highly attenuated modified
vaccinia virus ankara (mva) conventional vaccinia virus. note, cd4 cells 
were critically required allow mva induced cd8 cell expansion and
perforin-mediated cytotoxicity key mechanism mva induced protection. 
contrast, selected components innate immune system b cell-mediated
responses fully dispensable prevention fatal disease immunization 
given two days challenge. conclusion, data clearly demonstrate that
perforin-dependent cd8 cell immunity plays key role mva conferred short
term protection lethal mousepox. rapid induction cell immunity might
serve new paradigm treatments need fit scenario of
protective emergency vaccination.
