using nationwide danish registries examined long-term risk cervical
cancer women diagnosed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (cin3) 
(including adenocarcinoma situ (ais)) cone compared women a
normal cytology test. initially, identified women born 1918-1990, were
recorded living denmark january 1, 1978 december 31, 2012. from
the pathology data bank information cin3 cone, margins status,
histological type cin3 cervical cytology results extracted. cox
proportional hazard model used estimate relative risk subsequent
cervical cancer. included 59,464 women cin3 cone 1,918,508
women normal cytology test. overall, women diagnosed cin3 a
higher risk subsequent cervical cancer compared women normal cytology 
(hr = 2.06; 95%ci: 1.81-2.35). analyses according time since conization showed
elevated risks time periods, 25 years conization the
relative risk significantly increased (hr = 2.56; 95%ci: 1.37-4.77). twenty
years conization, also women negative margins increased
relative risk (hr = 2.49; 95%ci: 1.12-5.57). addition, long-term relative 
risk cervical cancer varied different histological types cin3 
was highest ais (hr = 7.50; 95%ci: 1.87-30.01, 10-14 years conization).
in conclusion, women diagnosed cin3 cone long-lasting
increased risk cervical cancer even margins cone negative.
