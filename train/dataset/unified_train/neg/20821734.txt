the transactivator protein tat human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) 
known suppress microtubule dynamics thereby trigger apoptosis t
lymphocytes. actions tat constitute one major mechanisms 
massive destruction lymphocytes associated acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome. herein, show tat acetylation lysine-28
(k28) enhances interaction microtubules increases activity to
promote microtubule assembly, lowering critical concentration tubulin
for polymerization microtubules. addition, k28 acetylation enhances the
ability tat stabilize microtubules, leading increased apoptosis t
lymphocytes. data reveal tat acetylation k28 stimulates its
activity induce translocation bim, pro-apoptotic protein bcl-2
family, microtubules mitochondria. findings provide first
evidence tat acetylation regulates actions microtubule dynamics and
apoptosis, addition regulation transactivation activity.
