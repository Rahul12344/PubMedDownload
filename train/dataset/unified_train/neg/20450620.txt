objective: explore whether hbx protein induce
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt) liver cancer cell smmc-7721.
methods: recombinant adenovirus vector containing hbx gene constructed 
introduced smmc-7721 cell. morphological changes observed. the
expression changes epithelial mesenchymal markers investigated by
rt-pcr, western blot immunohistochemistry. invasive metastatic capacity
of transfected smmc-7721 cell evaluated transwell migration assay.
results: recombinant adenovirus vector containing hbx gene constructed
and transfected successfully smmc-7721 cell. day 7 post-transfection, the
transfected smmc-7721 cell underwent morphological change classic
epithelial morphology spindle-like shape. addition, hbx protein
significantly increased expressions n-cadherin, vimentin fibronectin, 
but decreased expressions e-cadherin alpha-catenin smmc-7721 cell. 
the cellular invasion assay indicated transfection hbx drastically
enhanced invasive potential smmc-7721 cell.
conclusion: hbx protein may induce emt enhance invasive potential of
smmc-7721 cell.
