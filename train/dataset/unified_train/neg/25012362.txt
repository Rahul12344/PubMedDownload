background: tetraspanins transmembrane proteins serve scaffolds for
multiprotein complexes containing, example, integrins, growth factor
receptors matrix metalloproteases, modify functions cell
adhesion, migration transmembrane signaling. cd151 part tetraspanin
family forms tight complexes β1 β4 integrins, 
been shown required tumorigenesis and/or metastasis transgenic mouse
models breast cancer. high levels tetraspanin cd151 linked to
poor patient outcome several human cancers including breast cancer. in
addition, cd151 implicated promoter tumor angiogenesis and
metastasis various model systems.
methods: investigated effect cd151 deletion mammary
tumorigenesis crossing cd151-deficient mice spontaneously metastasising
transgenic model breast cancer induced polyoma middle antigen (pymt) 
driven murine mammary tumor virus promoter (mmtv).
results: cd151 deletion affect normal development differentiation
of mammary gland. trend towards delayed tumor onset in
cd151-/- pymt mice compared cd151+/+ pymt littermate controls, result was
only approaching significance (log-rank test p-value =0.0536). interestingly,
cd151 deletion resulted significantly reduced numbers size primary
tumors appear affect number size metastases the
mmtv/pymt mice. intriguingly, differences expression markers cell
proliferation, apoptosis blood vessel density observed primary
tumors.
conclusion: findings study provide additional evidence cd151
acts enhance tumor formation initiated range oncogenes strongly
support relevance potential therapeutic target delay breast cancer
progression.
