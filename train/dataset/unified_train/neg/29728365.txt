in mouse embryonic stem cells (mescs), expression provirus endogenous 
retroelements epigenetically repressed. although many cellular factors
involved retroelement silencing identified, complete molecular
mechanism remains elusive. study, performed genome-wide crispr
screen advance understanding retroelement silencing mescs. the
moloney murine leukemia virus (mlv)-based retroviral vector mscv-gfp, is
repressed setdb1/trim28 pathway mescs, used reporter provirus,
and identified 80 genes involved process. particular,
atf7ip baf complex components linked repression of
the setdb1 targets. characterized two factors, morc2a resf1, which
resf1 novel molecule retroelement silencing. although factors are
recruited repress provirus, roles repression different. morc2a
appears function dependent repressive epigenetic modifications, resf1
regulates repressive epigenetic modifications associated setdb1. our
genome-wide crispr screen cataloged genes function different levels in
silencing setdb1-target retroelements provides useful resource for
further molecular studies.
