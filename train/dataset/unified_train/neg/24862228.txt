infectious spleen kidney necrosis virus (isknv) belongs genus
megalocytivirus family iridoviridae. virus etiological agent
of serious pandemic disease fish. cells infected isknv undergo
apoptosis. study, isknv orf005l gene characterized and
functionally investigated. bioinformatics analysis revealed orf005l
protein contains region similar catalytic domain ctd-like
phosphatases. real-time quantitative-pcr results showed transcription profile
of orf005l isknv-infected cells; cells, orf005l initially
transcribed 24Â h post-infection. green fluorescent protein-tagged orf005l 
protein localized mitochondria. sub-mitochondrial fractions were
subjected western blot, results showed orf005l specifically
located inner membrane mitochondria. orf005l fathead minnow 
cells transiently expressed, resulting decrease mitochondrial
transmembrane potential, induced cell apoptosis. orf005l knocked down
by specific dsrna, thereby significantly reducing apoptosis mandarin fish 
fry-1 cells induced isknv infection. results indicated orf005l 
of isknv could disrupt mitochondrial function cause apoptosis. study may
provide novel insights pathogenesis megalocytivirus infection.
