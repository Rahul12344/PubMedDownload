laryngeal carcinomas aggressive neoplasms controversial association with
the human papillomavirus (hpv) epstein-barr virus (ebv). far, the
impairment p53 protein function impact cellular proliferation has
not studied adequately tumors. work, molecular biologic
techniques used assess frequency hpv ebv 110 squamous cell 
carcinomas larynx. addition, accumulation p53 ki-67 cell
proliferation antigen expression malignant cells assessed by
immunohistochemical analysis. high-grade hpv found 37.3% cases, and
none demonstrable ebv infection. accumulation p53 found 78.2% of
the cases, related high ki-67 labeling index higher
histologic grade. results demonstrate association hpv one
third laryngeal carcinomas studied, mainly glottic tumors. tumors with
increased cell proliferation frequently high grade, p53
accumulation lymph node metastasis.
