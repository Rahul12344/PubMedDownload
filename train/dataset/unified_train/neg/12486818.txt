using experimental model demonstrate need th1 immune responses for
recovery influenza virus infection. inoculation il-4 concurrent with
infection significantly delays virus clearance converts immune response
to th2 response. immunization using live virus presence il-4 leads to
generation th2 memory cells fail facilitate recovery upon subsequent
virus infection. inactivated virus expands th2 cells, leading responses
similar observed following il-4 infusion. immunization using cultured
dendritic cells incubated live inactivated virus mimics results
observed direct virus injection. demonstrate contrast live
virus-infected dendritic cells, inactivated virus fails elicit th1 immunity.
this failure correlates inactivated viruses' inability induce
dendritic cell maturation. thus, data suggest polarity immune
response dictated nature antigen, trigger influenza 
virus-induced dc maturation leading th1 immunity dependent virus
replication.
