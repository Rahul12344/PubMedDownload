oncogenic human papillomavirus (hpv) types 16 18 commonly associated with
cervical cancer found many epithelial malignancies extra-genital sites 
including breast. transforming gene products hpv also shown to
immortalize breast epithelial cells vitro. findings hpv dna in
breast carcinoma found contradictory. present study fine needle 
aspirate cell (fnac) samples 26 breast cancer patients four breast
tumour biopsies analysed presence hpv 16 18 dna sequences 
both polymerase chain reaction (pcr) southern blot hybridization. 26 fine 
needle aspirate cell samples four breast cancer biopsies, single sample
was found positive either pcr southern blot hybridization. the
observation complete absence hpv dna sequences breast cancer refute 
possibility role oncogenic genital hpv types 16 18 the
