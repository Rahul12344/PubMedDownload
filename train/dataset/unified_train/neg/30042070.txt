the prognostic significance clinical characteristics neuroimaging
features, especially cranial magnetic resonance imaging (mri)-based neuroimaging 
features, patients human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-negative
cryptococcal meningitis (cm) rarely examined literature. we
analyzed clinical characteristics mri findings 65 hiv-negative
patients (43 men, 22 women, age 19-86 years) collected study period of
15 years (january 2001-december 2015). underlying conditions included
diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, hematologic disorders, autoimmune disorders, 
malignancy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, adrenal insufficiency and
organ transplantation, clinical presentations included headache,
altered consciousness, fever, seizure, visual disturbance hearing impairment.
the main cranial mri findings basal meningeal enhancement (44.6%, 29/65),
dilated virchow-robin space/pseudocyst (43.1%, 28/65), "dirty" cerebrospinal
fluid sign (38.5%, 25/65), hydrocephalus (36.9%, 21/65), acute/subacute cerebral 
infarct (asci, 21.5%, 14/65), cryptococcoma (9.2%, 6/65), hazy brain base
(1.5%, 1/65). therapeutic results 65 patients evaluated using the
glasgow outcome scale (gos). comparison good outcome group (gos
score = 4-5, n = 37) poor outcome group (gos score = 1-3, n = 28) revealed
that presence seizures asci significantly associated with
the prognosis. comparison groups asci (n = 14) without asci
(n = 51) revealed presence basal meningeal enhancement a
significant factor development asci, correlation may 
associated intense basal meningeal inflammation adjacent small vessels.
