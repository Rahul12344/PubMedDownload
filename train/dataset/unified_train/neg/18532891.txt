background: human bocavirus (hbov) recently discovered children with
respiratory tract disease gastroenteritis. causative role hbov in
human gastroenteritis remains uncertain, and, knowledge, previous
case-control study studied relationship hbov gastroenteritis.
methods: conducted case-control study examined stool samples 397
children diarrhea 115 asymptomatic control subjects. hbov was
detected using polymerase chain reaction. real-time polymerase chain reaction was
used quantify hbov loads case control groups. common enteric
viruses examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, polymerase chain 
reaction, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.
results: least 1 viral agent discovered 60.2% cases. hbov was
detected 14 samples, 9 coinfected either rotavirus (7 14
samples) human calicivirus (2 14). many (8 [57.1%] 14) hbov
infections occurred september-december 2006. (12 [85.7%]) the
hbov-infected children 7-18 months age. percentage children with
hbov infection differ significantly case patients control
subjects (3.5% vs. 3.5%), statistical analysis support a
correlation hbov infection more-severe clinical symptoms. viral
load differences 2 groups statistically significant (p =
.09, log-normal student's test). addition, vp1/vp2 partial gene of
hbov case patients control subjects showed minimal sequence variation.
conclusions: single genetic lineage hbov revealed persons china.
despite high prevalence stool samples, study support a
causative role hbov gastroenteritis.
