attachment hepatitis b virus hepatoblastoma cell line (hepg2) was
examined using synthetic peptide corresponding pre-s1 (21-47) region 
the envelope protein. scatchard analysis revealed single class binding site 
kd 104 +/- 27 nm/l 5.4 +/- 1.2 x 10(5) sites per cell. competition hbv
with pre-s1 peptides dose dependent, demonstrated dominant
binding site. view suggested sequence homology peptide 
iga, cross-competition studies carried out. results indicate direct
role iga receptor hbv binding. receptor pre-s1 peptide was
identified single major peptide molecular weight 31 kd using in-situ
ligand receptor crosslinking.
