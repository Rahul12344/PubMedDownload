skeletal mineralization important step regulating mechanical properties
of calcified tissues, molecular events underlying mineralization still
remain elusive. examined role extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(erk) pathways matrix mineralization osteogenic cells vitro 
vivo. matrix mineralization preosteocytic mlo-a5 cells osteoblastic
mc3t3-e1 cells increased either pd98059 mek inhibitor treatment or
adenovirus vector-mediated dominant negative ras (ras(dn)) expression was
suppressed erk activation platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf) treatment
or constitutively active mek1 (mek(ca)) expression. administration adenovirus 
vectors carrying ras(dn) gene onto calvaria 1-day-old mice increased the
mineralization tissues, mek(ca) adenovirus suppressed
it. results suggest erk pathway negative regulator the
matrix mineralization vitro vivo.
