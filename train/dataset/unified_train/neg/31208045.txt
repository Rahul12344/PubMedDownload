consisting nearly 60 functional genes, porcine interferon (ifn)-complex
represents evolutionary surge ifn evolution domestic ungulate species.
to compare humans mice, species contains 20 ifn
functional genes, better characterized using conventional ifn-α/β
subtypes examples. porcine ifn-complex thus represents optimal model for
studying ifn evolution resulted increasing viral pressure during
domestication industrialization. hypothesize justify porcine
ifn-complex may extend functionality antiviral immunomodulatory
activity due superior molecular diversity. furthermore, these
unconventional ifns could even confer functional signaling novelty
beyond well-studied ifn-α/β subtypes. investigations porcine
ifn-complex understanding ifn biology promote ifn-based
therapeutic designs confront swine viral diseases.
