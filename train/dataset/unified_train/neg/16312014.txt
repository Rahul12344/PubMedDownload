in italy, fortunately clinical neurological manifestations, typical 
more serious phase disease, rarely observed. behaviour is
different endemic euroasiatic areas numerous cases of
encephalitis described. however tbe transmission widely
investigated italy available epidemiological data obtained 
by studies performed central northern regions country. addition 
seroepidemiological researches made prevalently subjects high risk 
tick bite, hunters forest guards trentin central italy. no
precise information tbe virus diffusion available piedmont
before investigations. found hunters wild boar breeders seem to
be particularly exposed risk tbe virus infection turin province 
in particular susa valley, although neurological involvement was
observed population. particular seroprevalence 5% was
detected use purified antigens elisa test, amongst subjects high
risk tick bite. moreover low risk individuals showed seroprevalence below
2%. addition parallel seroepidemiological study performed turin
province borrelia burgdorferi, aetiological agent lyme disease, also
transmitted tick bite (e.g. ixodes ricinus), dengue toscana (tos)
arboviruses, respectively transmitted aedes mosquitoes phlebotomes. data
reported demonstrate sporadic presence population of
antibodies borrelia dengue infection. moreover using elisa test
performed viral purified nucleoprotein, reported total percentage of
