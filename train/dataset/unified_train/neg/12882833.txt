lymphotoxin (lt) tumor necrosis factor (tnf) important immune system
development function. lt consists soluble lt-alpha(3), binds to
tnf-r1 tnf-r2, membrane lt-alpha(1)beta(2), binds lt-beta-r. 
investigated role lt tnf disease induced daniel's (da) strain of
theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (tmev) since immune response is
believed important resistance da infection well mediation 
of virus-induced demyelination. da persisted induced inflammatory
demyelination lt-alpha(-/-) (but tnf(-/-)) weanling mice normally
resistant haplotype (c57bl/6), suggesting lt, tnf, critical for
resistance da infection. activity lt depends membrane
lt-alpha(1)beta(2) soluble lt-alpha(3), since da virus persisted and
induced inflammatory demyelination lt-beta-r(-/-), tnf-r1(-/-) or
tnf-r2(-/-), mice. lt-alpha(-/-) lt-beta-r(-/-) mice failed mount a
virus-specific cytotoxic cell response. treatment weanling c57bl/6 mice with
lt-beta-r-ig, blocks membrane lt activity, failed increase
susceptibility, suggesting lt effect related action immune 
system development fixed 3 weeks age. data suggest that
membrane lt important resistance da infection (possibly through
interference cd8+ cell development function). relatively
little demyelination associated inflammation lt-alpha(-/-) and
lt-beta-r(-/-) mice compared susceptible sjl mice, suggesting possibility 
that lt plays role mediating demyelination.
