to explore mechanisms influenza h7n9 virus pathogenesis, influenza h7n9
virus h1n1 influenza virus(h1n1pdm09)-infected a549 cellular models were
established, differential protein expression a549 cells infected 
two strains investigated.a549 cells infected h7n9 and
h1n1pdm09influenza virus multiplicity infection(moi)of 0.001.the temporal
response a549 cells infected two strains evaluated using the
proteomics approaches(2ddige combined maldi-tof-ms/ms)at 24,48 72hours
post infection(hpi).there 11,12 33proteins significantly different 
expression 24,48 72hpi,respectively.compared h1n1pdm09 infection,
functional analysis revealed down-regulation proteins h7n9
infection including f-actin-capping protein subunit alpha-1(capz-Î±1), ornithine
aminotransferase(oat),poly(rc)-binding protein 1(pcbp1)and eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 5a-1(eif5a)produced cytopathic effects. down-regulation 
platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolaseib subunit beta(pafah1b2)in
h7n9-infection may related clinical symptoms patients infected by
the influenza h7n9 virus.
