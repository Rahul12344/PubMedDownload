several glycoprocessing enzymes glycoreceptors recognized as
important targets therapeutic intervention. concept inspired the
development important classes therapeutics, anti-influenza drugs
inhibiting influenza virus neuraminidase, anti-inflammatory drugs targeting
lectin-sialyl-lewis x interaction glycosidase inhibitors hiv,
gaucher's disease, hepatitis cancer. therapeutics mainly
carbohydrate mimics proper modifications permit stronger interactions
with target protein, higher stability, better pharmacokinetic properties 
easier synthesis. furthermore, conformational rigidity polyfunctionality 
of carbohydrates stimulate use scaffolds generation libraries
by combinatorial decoration different pharmacophores. mini-review 
present examples exploit carbohydrates mimics scaffolds drug
research.
