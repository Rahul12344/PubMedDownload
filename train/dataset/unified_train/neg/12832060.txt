two tandem cassettes, one containing telomerase reverse transcriptase gene
(htert) promoter upstream constitutively activated form heat shock
transcription factor 1 (chsf1) followed containing heat
shock protein 70b (hsp70b) promoter (hse) upstream cytosine deaminase (cd)
gene, could greatly enhance efficiency cd gene therapy retaining
tumor specificity vitro vivo. htert-chsf1/hse promoter could
restrict gene expression tumor cells 1.5-3-fold potent than
the cytomegalovirus (cmv) promoter. htert-chsf1/hse-cd transfection led tumor 
cells sensitive 5-fluorocytosine compared htert-cd toxicity 
was comparable cmv-cd. besides enhancement promoter activity, chsf1
overexpression could enhance bystander effect cd gene therapy 
could reversed anti-fas antibody. system also led activation of
stress-related genes hsp70 tumor cells, presence cell 
killing cytotoxic gene highly immunostimulatory event. furthermore, a
more potent anti-tumor effect htert-chsf1/hse-cd observed nude mice
inoculated bcap37 cells. obvious activity htert-chsf1/hse promoter
was observed normal tissues intravenous administration. results
indicate htert-chsf1/hse promoter highly tumor-specific strong
with potential application targeted gene therapy, therefore may useful 
for construction vectors systemic therapy.
