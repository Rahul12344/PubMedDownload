porcine circovirus type 2 (pcv2) primary causative agent emerging
swine disease, postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome. previously showed
that newly identified protein, orf3, plays major role virus-induced
apoptosis involved viral pathogenesis vitro vivo. to
characterize role orf3 protein modulation cellular function, a
yeast two-hybrid system used screen porcine cdna library find its
interacting partner. isolated characterized ppirh2 (for "porcine
p53-induced ring-h2"), e3 ubiquitin ligase, specifically interacts 
the orf3 protein pcv2. interaction confirmed orf3
protein coimmunoprecipitated colocalized ppirh2 pk15 cells. the
orf3 protein found interact p53 binding domain ppirh2 
yeast cells. expression protein results less ppirh2 expression in
pcv2-infected cells. furthermore, increases p53 expression observed in
pcv2-infected orf3 (alone)-transfected cells. phosphorylation p53 at
ser-46, related p53-induced apoptosis, also time-dependently
activated pcv-infected orf3-transfected cells. taken together, results
show pcv2 orf3 protein specifically interacts ppirh2 inhibits
its stabilization; may lead increasing p53 expression, resulting in
apoptosis.
