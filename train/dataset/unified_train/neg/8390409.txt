occurrence antibodies human papillomavirus (hpv) 16 proteins e4
and e7 specifically independently associated cervical cancer. to
correlate hpv dna antibody data, examined biopsy specimens sera,
by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) elisa, respectively, 51 patients
with cervical cancer (including 3 recurrent cases) 22 cervical
intra-epithelial neoplasia. consensus primers l1 region used pcr
and bacterially expressed, purified fusion protein hpv-16 e4 non-fusion
protein hpv-16 e7 used elisa. hpv-16 dna hpv types were
detected 17 25, respectively, 51 cases cervical cancer. ten 
of 17 hpv-16-dna-positives positive either anti-e4 anti-e7:
positivities anti-e4, anti-e7, 6/17, 5/17 1/17
respectively. three anti-e7-positives consisted hpv-33, -52 -58 
dna, suggesting limited cross-reaction occurred hpv types. among
the hpv-16-dna-positive cases cancer, lymph-node distant metastasis was
recorded frequently seropositives seronegatives. our
results show hpv-16 anti-e4 anti-e7 occurs some, all,
of hpv-16-dna-positive cases, support hypothesis presence of
the hpv-16 antibodies used marker possible metastasis.
