hybridization rna double-stranded dna: formation r-loops.

thomas m, white rl, davis rw.

rna hybridize double-stranded dna presence 70% formamide by
displacing identical dna strand. resulting structure, called r-loop,
is formed formamide probably greater thermodynamic stability of
the rna-dna hybrid near denaturation temperature duplex dna.
the rate r-loop formation maximal temperature half the
duplex dna irreversibly converted single-stranded dna (the strand
separation temperature tss) duplex dna falls precipitously few
degrees temperature. maximal rate similar rate
of hybridization rna single-stranded dna conditions. at
temperatures tss rate proportional rna concentration.
however, temperatures tss rate r-loop formation less dependent
upon rna concentration. formed, r-loops display considerable
stability; formamide removed dna cleaved with
restriction endonucleases without loss r-loop structures.
