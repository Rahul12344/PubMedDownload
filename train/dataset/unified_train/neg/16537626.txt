structural transitions viral capsids play critical role virus life
cycle, including assembly, disassembly, release packaged nucleic acid.
cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (ccmv) undergoes well-studied reversible
structural expansion vitro capsid expands 10%. swollen
form particle completely disassembled increasing salt
concentration 1 m. remarkably, single-residue mutant ccmv n-terminal 
arm, k42r, susceptible dissociation high salt (salt-stable ccmv
[ss-ccmv]) retains 70% wild-type infectivity. present combined
structural biophysical basis chemical stability viability 
ss-ccmv particles. 2.7-a resolution crystal structure ss-ccmv capsid
shows addition 660 new intersubunit interactions per particle center
of 20 hexameric capsomeres, direct result k42r mutation.
protease-based mapping experiments intact particles demonstrate 
swollen closed forms wild-type ss-ccmv particles highly
dynamic n-terminal regions, yet ss-ccmv particles resistant to
degradation. thus, increase ss-ccmv particle stability result of
concentrated tethering subunits local symmetry interface (i.e.,
quasi-sixfold axes) interfere function key
symmetry interfaces (i.e., fivefold, twofold, quasi-threefold axes). result
is particle still dynamic insensitive high salt due new
series bonds resistant high ionic strength preserve the
overall particle structure.
