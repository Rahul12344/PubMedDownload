objective: determine ability intermediate plasma viral load (pvl)
measurements predict virologic outcome 52 weeks follow-up clinical
trials antiretroviral therapy.
methods: individual patient data three clinical trials (incas, avanti-2 
avanti-3) combined single database. virologic success defined 
be plasma viral load (pvl) <500 copies/ml week 52. sensitivity and
specificity intermediate pvl measurements limit detection, 100,
500, 1000, 5000 copies/ml predict virologic success calculated.
results: sensitivity, specificity, positive negative predictive
values pvl measurement <1000 copies/ml week 16 predict virologic
outcome week 52 74%, 74%, 48%, 90%, respectively, patients on
double therapy. patients triple therapy, sensitivity, specificity, and
positive negative predictive values pvl measurement <50 copies/ml at
week 16 predict virologic outcome 68%, 68%, 80%, 47%, respectively.
conclusions: patients receiving double therapy, poor virologic result an
intermediate week follow-up strong indicator virologic failure 52
weeks whereas intermediate virologic success guarantee success 1
year. patients triple therapy, disappointing intermediate results not
preclude virologic success 1 year intermediate successes likely
to sustained.
