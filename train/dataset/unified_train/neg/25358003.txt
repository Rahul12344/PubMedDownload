part g protein (3094-4170 bp) spring viremia carp virus (svcv) was
expressed escherichia coli purified dialysis study. two clones
of monoclonal antibodies (mabs 1h11 4b8) g protein generated 
fusion mouse myeloma cell line sp2/0 spleen lymphocytes part g
protein (3094-4170 bp) immunized mice. results elisa (enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay), ifa (indirect immunofluorescent assay), western blot
assay demonstrated characterizations two mabs. 1h11 and
4b8 specific svcv g protein. ten pairs synthesized overlapping
peptides used identify epitope mabs. mabs useful in
the development svcv diagnostic methods.
