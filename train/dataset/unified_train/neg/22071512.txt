jc virus (jcv) aetiological agent demyelinating disease progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy, aids defining illness serious complication
of mab therapies. initial infection probably occurs childhood. working 
model dissemination, virus persists kidney lymphoid tissues until
immune suppression/modulation causes reactivation trafficking brain
where jcv replicates oligodendrocytes. jcv infection regulated through
binding host factors spi-b to, sequence variation the
non-coding control region (nccr). although nccr sequences differ sites of
persistence pathogenesis, evidence suggests virus initiates
infection brain disseminates via b-cells derived latently infected
haematopoietic precursors bone marrow. spi-b binds adjacent tata boxes 
in promoter/enhancer pml-associated jcv mad-1 mad-4 viruses but
not non-pathogenic, kidney-associated archetype. spi-b-binding site of
mad-1/mad-4 differs archetype single nucleotide, aaaagggaaggga 
to aaaagggaaggta. point mutation mad-1 spi-b site reduced early viral
protein large t-antigen expression fourfold. strikingly, reverse
mutation archetype nccr increased large t-antigen expression 10-fold.
interestingly, spi-b protein binds nccr sequence flanking viral
promoter/enhancer, sites essential early viral gene
expression. effect mutating spi-b-binding sites within jcv
promoter/enhancer early viral gene expression strongly suggests role for
spi-b binding viral promoter/enhancer activation early viral
gene expression.
