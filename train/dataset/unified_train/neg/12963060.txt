in paper report novel application single-chain antibody fragments
(scfv) protein identification utilizing inherent information the
paratope primary structure analysis. combining potential antibody
phage display peptide phage display, selected scfvs employed select
phage-displayed peptides mimicking epitope protein interest. proof
of principle demonstrated identification neuroblastoma protein
nb-p260. protein recognized apoptosis-inducing igm antibodies present 
in sera healthy individuals. identification nb-p260 hindered
by high molecular weight range 260-280kda instability in
purified protein preparations. employing approach, subjected human
synthetic scfv library selection using sodium dodecyl sulfate-denatured
nb-p260. specific scfvs used selection heptapeptide phage
display library. analyzed clones, peptide sequences identified, two 
which could related known proteins conservative amino acid
replacement one which, obtained several clones, could related to
the actin-binding protein abp278 two conservative amino acid replacements. 
the identity nb-p260 abp278 verified specific antibodies directed 
against n c termini abp278.
