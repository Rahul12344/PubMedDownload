moderate elevations serum transaminases frequently found patients 
diabetes mellitus often attributed fatty infiltration liver
without investigation. recent studies patients end-stage liver
disease suggested possible association hepatitis c virus (hcv)
antibody positivity development diabetes (mostly type 2). first
step examination potential association hcv type 2
diabetes subjects without overt liver disease, examined 200 british
patients type 2 diabetes (100 white caucasians, 50 asians, 50
afro-caribbeans), recruited united kingdom prospective study of
diabetes, half significant elevation alanine aminotransferase
(alt) least two occasions half consistently normal alt
levels. afro-caribbean type 2 diabetic subjects 7/25 (28%) patients with
abnormal alt 1/25 (4%) normal alt hcv antibody positive. among
white caucasian subjects 6/50 (12%) patients abnormal lfts 0/50 with
normal lfts hcv antibody positive asians prevalence 2/25 (8%)
and 0/25, respectively. study suggests persistent mild moderate
elevation serum transaminases patient type 2 diabetes not
automatically attributed metabolic disturbances diabetes.
particularly afro-caribbean subjects, hcv infection major diagnostic
consideration. question whether hcv infection may a
diabetogenic action worthy investigation.
