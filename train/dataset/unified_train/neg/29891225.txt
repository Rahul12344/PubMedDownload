and associated increased morbidity mortality. literature aki after
pediatric cardiac surgery comprehensively reviewed terms incidence, risk
factors, biomarkers, treatment prognosis. novel rifle (pediatric rifle
for pediatrics), acute kidney injury network (akin) kidney disease improving 
global outcomes (kdigo) criteria brought unified diagnostic standards 
and comparable results aki cardiac surgery. numerous risk factors,
either renal extrarenal, responsible development aki after
cardiac surgery, low cardiac output syndrome pronounced
predictor. early fluid overload also crucial occurrence aki and
prognosis pediatric patients. three sensitive biomarkers, neutrophil
gelatinase-associated lipocalin, cystatin c (cysc) liver fatty acid-binding
protein, regarded earliest (increase 2-4 h), another two,
kidney injury molecule-1 interleukin-18 represent intermediate
respondents (increase 6-12 h surgery). ameliorate cardiopulmonary
bypass techniques, improve renal perfusion eradicate causative risk
factors imperative prevention aki pediatric patients. early
and intermediate biomarkers helpful early judgment occurrence of
postoperative aki. improved survival achieved prevention, renal
support modifications hemofiltration techniques. development is
anticipated small children.
