only minority exposed human papillomavirus (hpv) develop
hpv-related cervical oropharyngeal cancer. host immunity affects
infection progression cancer, tested hypothesis genetic
variation immune-related genes determinant susceptibility to
oropharyngeal cancer hpv-associated cancers performing multitier
integrative computational analysis oropharyngeal cancer data head and
neck cancer genome-wide association study (gwas). independent analyses, including
single-gene, gene-interconnectivity, protein-protein interaction, gene
expression, pathway analysis, identified immune genes pathways
significantly associated oropharyngeal cancer. tgfβr1, intersected all
tiers analysis thus selected validation, replicated significantly in
the head neck cancer gwas limited hpv-seropositive cases an
independent cervical cancer gwas. tgfβr1 containing p38-mapk pathway was
significantly associated oropharyngeal cancer cervical cancer, and
tgfβr1 overexpressed oropharyngeal cancer, cervical cancer, hpv(+)
head neck cancer tumors. concordant analyses implicate tgfβr1 signaling
as process dysregulated across hpv-related cancers. study demonstrates
that genetic variation immune-related genes associated susceptibility 
to oropharyngeal cancer implicates tgfβr1/tgfβ signaling development
of oropharyngeal cancer cervical cancer. better understanding the
immunogenetic basis susceptibility hpv-associated cancers may provide
insight host/virus interactions immune processes dysregulated the
minority hpv-exposed individuals progress cancer.
