background: seroprevalence rates herpesvirus 8 (hhv 8) antibodies were
determined general czech population hiv-positive individuals.
objectives: six hundred sixty six serum samples general czech
population 129 serum samples hiv-positive persons tested the
presence antibodies hhv 8 lytic latent antigens.
study design: hhv 8 antibodies detected indirect immunofluorescence
test.
results: general czech population, 2.4 0.3% serum samples 
tested positive antibodies lytic latent hhv 8 antigens,
respectively. many 34.9 10.9% hiv positive individuals antibodies
to hhv 8 antigens, respectively. three developed kaposi's
sarcoma (ks) date. time ks diagnosis, three patients had
antibodies hhv 8 antigens. hiv-positive homo/bisexuals at
significantly higher risk acquiring hhv 8 infection compared hiv-positive
heterosexuals. increase hhv 8 seroprevalence associated with
progression hiv infection stage stage b. correlation was
found hhv 8 seroprevalence cd 4+t-lymphocytes counts hiv
viral load.
conclusions: among general czech population, hhv 8 seroprevalence as
low west european countries. mean hhv 8 seroprevalence rate in
hiv-positive individuals 34.9% comparable reported in
other low seroprevalence countries.
