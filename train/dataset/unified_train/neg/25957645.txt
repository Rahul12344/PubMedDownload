key message: wheat yellow mosaic virus resistance madsen governed two
complementary qtls, qym1 qym2 , located chromosome arms 2dl 3bs. wheat
yellow mosaic, caused wheat yellow mosaic virus (wymv), one most
serious wheat diseases east asia. study, recombinant inbred lines
(rils, f9) cross cultivars madsen (resistant) hokushin
(susceptible) grown wymv-infected nursery field tested presence
of wymv leaves enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) genotyped by
using genome-wide molecular markers. two major qtls detected: qym1 located
between xgwm539 xgwm349 chromosome 2dl qym2 located xbarc147
and xwmc623 chromosome 3bs. resistance alleles qtls originated
from madsen. third qtl qym3 located near xwmc457 chromosome 4d, 
resistant allele qtl originated hokushin. although qym3 was
rather minor, essential complement qym1 qym2 complete avoidance
of wymv infection. near-isogenic lines carrying resistance qtls were
developed repeated backcrosses using madsen donor parent hokushin
as recurrent parent. lines resistant wymv (as tested by
elisa) homozygous madsen alleles qym1 qym2. qym1
dominance partial, whereas qym2 nearly complete. qym1 closely
linked xwmc41; qym2 closely linked xwmc754. markers be
useful marker-assisted selection wheat breeding wymv resistance; this
study facilitate cloning wymv resistance genes.
