viruses genomes greater 300 kb 1200 kb discovered
with increasing frequency. large viruses (often called giruses) encode 
up 900 proteins also many trnas. consequently, viruses more
protein-encoding genes many bacteria, concept small
particle/small genome defined viruses longer valid. giruses
infect bacteria animals although recently discovered ones infect 
protists. thus, genome gigantism restricted specific host or
phylogenetic clade. date, giruses associated aqueous
environments. many large viruses (phycodnaviruses mimiviruses)
probably common evolutionary ancestor poxviruses, iridoviruses,
asfarviruses, ascoviruses, recently discovered marseillevirus. one issue
that perhaps appreciated microbiology community large
viruses, even ones classified family, differ significantly in
morphology, lifestyle, genome structure. review focuses these
differences extensive details individual viruses.
