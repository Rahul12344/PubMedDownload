kaposi's sarcoma (ks) spindle-shaped vascular cell tumor occurs 
skin, lymphoid, respiratory gastrointestinal tissues. may resemble
aggressive malignant neoplasm hiv-related post-transplant types but
classic form may behave benign, potentially controllable reversible
hyperplasia. ks lesions onset dispersed multicentric. ks
probability increases solid organ transplant recipients (approximately 3/1000 
patients). ks occurrence associated with: type dose immunosuppression, 
chronic stimulation foreign allograft antigens, viral infections (herpes virus
8), anti rejection induction therapy, etc. 90% ks cases appear dark
blue purplish macular lesions may form nodular tumors. histological
picture shows networks spindle shaped cells vascular spaces surrounded 
an endothelial cell layer. uniform schema ks treatment renal
transplant recipients. immunosuppression must reduced lowest levels
which preserve allograft function. csa converted mofetil
mycophenolate mtor-inhibitors. conversion mmf regression ks was
observed, although low therapeutic mmf doses seem appropriate. sirolimus
seems inhibit growth established vascularized tumors effect is
best realized relatively low immunosuppressive doses drug.
