the flavivirus genus includes widespread severe human pathogens like four
serotypes dengue virus (denv1 denv4), yellow fever virus, japanese
encephalitis virus west nile virus. domain iii (ed3) viral envelope
protein interacts cell receptors contains epitopes recognized virus
neutralizing antibodies. structural, antigenic immunogenic properties
have thoroughly studied contrary physico-chemical properties. here,
the ed3 domains pathogenic flaviviruses produced the
periplasm escherichia coli. thermodynamic stabilities measured 
compared experiments unfolding equilibriums, induced chemicals heat
and monitored protein fluorescence. designed ed3 domain, the
consensus sequence denv strains serotypes, highly stable. low
stability ed3 domain denv3 increased three changes residues
in protein core without affecting reactivity towards denv-infected human 
serums. additional changes showed stability ed3 varied denv3
genotype. t(m) ed3 higher 69°c tested viruses and
reached 86°c consensus ed3. latter, deprived disulfide bond by
mutations, predominantly unfolded 20°c. results help better
understand design properties ed3 use diagnostic, vaccine or
therapeutic tools.
