background: limited photoinactivation kinetics, use low-volume 30 percent hct 
rbcs, hemolysis restricted practicality use of
dimethylmethylene blue (dmmb) light rbc decontamination. flow-cell
system developed rapidly treat larger volumes oxygenated 45 percent hct
rbcs high-intensity red light.
materials methods: cpd-whole blood wbc reduced, rbcs diluted in
additive solutions (either adsol erythrosol), suspensions were
subsequently oxygenated gas overlay. intracellular extracellular vsv and
dmmb sequentially added. vsv-infected rbc suspensions (45% hct) passed 
through 1-mm-thick flow cells illuminated. samples titered vsv,
stored 42 days, assayed hb, supernatant potassium, atp, and
mcv.
results: use oxygenated rbcs resulted rapid reproducible
photoinactivaton > = 6.6 log extracellular approximately 4.0 log
intracellular vsv independent additive solution. phototreated adsol rbcs
exhibited 10 times greater hemolysis 30 percent greater mcv 
storage identically treated erythrosol rbcs. phototreatment caused rbc
potassium leakage rbcs additive solutions. atp levels better
preserved erythrosol adsol rbcs.
conclusion: rapid, reproducible, robust method photoinactivating model 
virus rbc suspensions developed. despite improved hemolysis atp levels
in erythrosol-phototreated rbcs, storage properties maintained 42
days.
