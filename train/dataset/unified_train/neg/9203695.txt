patterns poliovirus circulation, partial nucleotide sequences the
poliovirus isolates compared. isolates remarkably diverse. two
isolates closely related viruses isolated the
1988 epidemic oman. two isolates similar viruses found in
egypt. fifth isolate distantly related latter pair. molecular 
data suggest 10 cases represented three separate outbreaks. the
virologic findings underscore potential saudi arabia, receives
