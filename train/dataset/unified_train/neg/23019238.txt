background: smoking associated cervical cancer. examined whether
smoking increases risk high-grade cervical lesions women with
high-risk human papillomavirus (hpv) infection.
methods: population-based cohort study, 8,656 women underwent structured
interview, subsequently cervical cells obtained hpv dna testing.
women high-risk hpv infection prevalent cervical disease baseline 
(n = 1,353) followed pathology data bank cervical lesions
for 13 years. separate analyses women persistent high-risk hpv
infection (n = 312) also conducted. hrs diagnosis cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 worse/high-grade squamous intraepithelial
lesions worse (cin3+) corresponding 95% confidence intervals (ci) were
calculated two groups.
results: among high-risk hpv-positive women, increased risk cin3+ was
associated long-term smoking (≥10 years) heavy smoking (≥20
cigarettes/d). subgroup women persistent hpv infection, heavy
smoking also associated statistically significantly higher risk for
cin3+ never smoking (hr, 1.85; 95% ci, 1.05-3.22, adjusted length of
schooling, parity, hpv type baseline). average number cervical
cytology screening tests per year follow-up explain the
differences risk relation smoking (p = 0.4).
conclusions: smoking associated increased risk subsequent
high-grade cervical lesions women persistent high-risk hpv infection.
impact: study adds understanding role smoking natural
history hpv cervical carcinogenesis.
