objective: investigate clinical outcomes hepatic histology patients
with hepatitis c.
methods: nine patients hepatitis, 4 males 5 females, aged 44 +/- 7, 
were infected transfusion blood donation underwent follow-up 13
approximately 14 years: liver histological examination biopsy,
ultrasonography, biochemical examination alanine transaminase (alt), apartate 
aminotransferase (ast), total bilirubin (tbil), serum anti-hcv elisa, 
hcv rna quantification pcr.
results: alt higher normal value every time point hcv rna
remained positive (3.57 x 10(8) approximately 7.21 x 10(9) copies/l) all
patients. ultrasonography showed mild moderate hepatitis (3 6 cases
respectively). modified histological activity indices (hai) 5.0
approximately 8.5 fibrosis scores 1 approximately 4. alt value
was higher moderate cases mild cases, higher with
higher hai. viral load higher patients infected virus of
the genotype 1b patients infected virus genotype 2.
conclusion: clinical outcomes hepatic histology patients with
hepatitis c seem severe.
