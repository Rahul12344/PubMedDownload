we investigated short-term persistence human papillomavirus (hpv) infection
among 2,408 women low-grade equivocal cytological abnormalities followed 
for 24 months. odds ratios (ors) persistence next 6-month visit were
estimated discrete time survival model. prevalent hpv infections persisted
longer older women, association age found incident hpv
infections. increased likelihood persistence found among current smokers
of >20 cigarettes per day compared smokers <or=10 cigarettes per day
(or=1.43; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.02-2.01) among current injectable
contraceptive users (or=1.15; 95% ci: 1.01-1.32). persistence likely
among infections higher viral load (or=2.05; 95% ci: 1.65-2.53) with
concurrent cytological abnormalities (or=1.19; 95% ci: 1.03-1.39 1.29; 95%
ci: 0.99-1.70 ascus/lsil asc-h/hsil, respectively). conclude new 
hpv infections older women riskier metric viral persistence 
than younger women. risk factors oral contraceptive use
and multiparity associated cervical cancer cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 associated short-term hpv
persistence.
