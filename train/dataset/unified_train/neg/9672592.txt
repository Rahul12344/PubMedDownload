full-length cdna clones coding matrix (m) fusion (f) proteins of
equine morbillivirus (emv) isolated rt-pcr, expressed escherichia 
coli using two different expression systems. western blot analysis indicated that
the f proteins, expressed either fusion proteins with
glutathione s-transferase (gst), insoluble degraded expression.
analysis degradation pattern recombinant protein suggested the
n-terminus matrix protein might stable antigenic the
c-terminal region. therefore third system used express truncated m
protein, composed n-terminal amino acid residues 1-197, (his)6-tag 
attached n-terminus. recombinant protein [(his)6-mtr], stable but
was also insoluble. one-step affinity purification denaturing
conditions, (his)6-mtr used monitor antibody response emv infection
by western blot elisa. obtained 100% correlation western blot
and virus neutralisation testing although number positive sera available
for testing limited, included seven horse, two rabbit one
human sera.
