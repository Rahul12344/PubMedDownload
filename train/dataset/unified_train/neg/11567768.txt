in order investigate changing levels measles antibody women
resulting extensive vaccination programs influence susceptibility of
children, measured seroprevalence measles virus antibody children in
the first year life mothers. compared maternal antibody decay 
of two groups children: whose mothers 25 years old (mothers
born pre-vaccination era), less 25 years old (mothers born the
vaccination era). therefore, 25-year-age cut-off chosen distinguish
between vaccinated non-vaccinated mothers. also compared the
immunogenicity measles vaccine children 6 12 months age, in
these two groups also according mother's serostatus. optimal age
of vaccination routine program estimated means mathematical
models. study carried sample 1216 mothers their
respective children. results indicate optimal age vaccination of
the whole sample 15 months, 17 months children born older mothers,
14 months children born younger mothers, 17 months children born
from seropositive mothers 12 months children born seronegative
mothers. therefore, change earlier age routine vaccination not
justified results.
