the role antibody cell-mediated immunity resistance japanese
encephalitis virus (jev) infection studied adult mice. passively
transferred antibodies obtained 2 weeks primary infection protected
the recipient mice challenge infection jev. antibody obtained 4
or 5 weeks failed protect despite presence high titres neutralizing 
antibody. protection abrogated pretreatment early serum with
2-mercaptoethanol remove igm. similarly, adoptive transfer immune spleen
cells obtained 2 weeks immunization provided protection. the
protective effect abolished pretreatment immune spleen cells with
anti-thy 1.2 antiserum complement. findings suggest role t
lymphocytes igm antibody recovery jev infection.
