hydrogen sulfide-producing bacteria (spb) spoil raw animal materials and
release harmful hydrogen sulfide (h2s) gas. objective study to
apply spb-specific bacteriophage cocktail control h2s production spb in
different raw poultry by-products laboratory (20, 30, 37°c) and
greenhouse (average temperature 29 31°c, humidity 34.8 59.8%, light
intensity 604.8 wm(2)) simulating transportation rendering facility. the
amount h2s production determined using either test strips impregnated with
lead acetate h2s monitor. laboratory, phage treatment applied to
fresh chicken meat inoculated spb, spoiled chicken meat, chicken guts, and
chicken feathers reduced h2s production approximately 25 69% at
temperatures 20 37°c. greenhouse, phage treatment achieved
approximately 30 85% reduction h2s yield chicken offal feathers.
among phage treatments, multiplicity infection (moi) 100 exhibited 
highest inhibitory activities spb h2s production. several factors such
as initial spb level, temperature, moi affect lytic activities of
bacteriophages. study demonstrated phage cocktail effective to
reduce production h2s spb significantly raw animal materials. this
biological control method control spb raw poultry by-products ambient
temperatures, leading safer working environment high quality product
with less nutrient degradation rendering industry.
