neuroleukin lymphokine product lectin-stimulated cells induces
immunoglobulin secretion cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
neuroleukin acts early vitro response leads formation of
antibody-secreting cells, continued production immunoglobulin by
differentiated antibody-secreting cells neuroleukin-independent. although 
factor directly mitogenic, cellular proliferation late component of
the response neuroleukin. neuroleukin b-cell growth factor
(bcgf) b-cell differentiation factor (bcdf) activity defined assays.
neuroleukin-evoked induction immunoglobulin secretion monocyte- and
t-cell-dependent.
