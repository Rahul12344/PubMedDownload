whether polyoma virus (pv) infection renal allografts induces antiviral 
antigraft immune reaction unclear. examination relationships of
tubular pv graft inflammation scarring, study sought histological
evidence viral interstitial nephritis allograft biopsies untreated pv 
infection compared inflammatory indices controls acute rejection 
(ar). morphological features including viral cytopathic changes (vccs) and
modified banff 97 histological indices evaluated sections 28
diagnostic biopsies group patients receiving prednisone, tacrolimus,
and mycophenolate mofetil constant dosage biopsy. two-micrometer
paraffin sections stained pv large antigen (tag) c4d, by
immunohistochemistry. tubular profiles 1 nuclei expressing tag per
x200 field scored using interval scale (0-10; none 91-100%) 2
observers. controls ar (n = 38, tag negative) matched time after
transplantation severity banff 97 interstitial inflammation (i) and
tubulitis (t) scores. median scores tubules vcc tag both
exceeded scores tubules without vcc tag (3 versus 0, p = .001). tubular
tag score correlated score (r = 0.58, p < .01) sum ct + ci score (r = 
0.61, p < .001). atrophic tubules scars persistent vcc and/or tag.
interstitial plasma cells (75% versus 21%) neutrophils (32% versus 0%) were
more frequent, interstitial fibrosis severe (ci >1 54% versus
21%) polyoma virus nephropathy (pvn) group ar (p < .01).
intimal arteritis (0% versus 35.7%), peritubular capillary c4d (0% versus 47.4%),
and interstitial hemorrhage (4% versus 37%) almost exclusively found ar
(p < .01). tubular inflammation untreated pvn involves infected tubular
profiles greater severity without evidence infection. the
extent tubular pv infection proportional interstitial inflammation and
scarring. tubulointerstitial inflammation pv infection significant
qualitative differences ar. observations examples untreated pvn 
suggest allograft inflammatory reaction may exhibit features viral
tubulointerstitial nephritis distinct ar.
