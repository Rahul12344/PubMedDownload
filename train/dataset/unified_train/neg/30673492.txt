grapevine red blotch virus (grbv) recently described virus infects
grapevine. little information available possible occurrence and
distribution outside north america. therefore, surveyed commercial vineyards
from three major grape-growing regions switzerland determine the
presence absence grbv. total, 3,062 vines analyzed polymerase
chain reaction. none vines tested positive grbv, suggesting the
absence grbv swiss vineyards. also investigated whether grbv was
present 653 grapevine accessions agroscope grapevine virus collection
at nyon, including dominantly swiss (457) also international accessions. only
six referential accessions infected grbv, originating united
states, whereas others 10 european 8 non-european origins tested
negative. high-throughput sequencing analysis zinfandel a2v13, the
collection since 1985, confirmed close similarity grbv isolate z_a2v13 to
american isolates according genomes deposited genbank. the
zinfandel a2v13 reference also maintained grafted leafroll virus
indicator vitis vinifera 'gamay', evaluated effect grbv viticultural
performance 3-year period. results showed clear detrimental effects of
grbv grapevine physiology (vine vigor, leaf chlorophyll content, gas
exchange) fruit quality. findings underscore importance of
implementation grbv testing worldwide certification quarantine programs
to prevent dissemination virus.
