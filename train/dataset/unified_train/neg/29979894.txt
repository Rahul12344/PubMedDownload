infection hepatitis b virus (hbv) major problem worldwide. major
histocompatibility complex plays essential role host immunity help 
eliminate hbv infected hepatocytes. study aimed determine role 
of certain human leukocyte antigen (hla) class ii molecules (i.e. hla-drb1 and
hla-dqb1) persistence removal hbv. sixty patients confirmed be
hbv-positive via real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr), i.e. people with
chronic active hepatitis, included study along control group
of 100 healthy individuals without evidence hbv infection. dna was
subsequently used determine hla-drb1 hla-dqb1 low-resolution typing
genetic profile via pcr amplification. univariate analysis performed revealed
significant association hla-drb1*03 hla-dqb1*05 alleles the
infected persons (study group), hla-drb1*01 shown protective
against hbv infection. knowledge, first romanian study
associating hla hbv, provide valuable insight concerning the
relationship genetic factors immune response sampled
population.
