influenza attaches host cells via hemagglutinin binding cell-surface
glycans. relatively low-affinity interactions involving flexible ligands
are critical determining tissue host specificity, dynamic nature
complicates structural characterization hemagglutinin-receptor complexes.
molecular simulation assist analyzing glycan protein flexibility in
crystallized complexes, assessing binding might change mutation or
altered glycosylation patterns, evaluating soluble ligands may relate 
physiological presentation plasma membrane. molecular dynamics simulation 
also potential help integrate structural dynamic data sources.
here review recent progress analysis molecular dynamics simulation and
outline challenges future.
