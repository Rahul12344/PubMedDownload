background: determining timing first virus detection episodes (fvdes) for
different respiratory viruses infants identifies risk periods informs
preventive interventions, including vaccination. describe ages nature 
of fvdes infant birth cohort explore factors associated increased 
odds symptomatic fvdes.
methods: observational research childhood infectious diseases (orchid)
study community-based birth cohort describing acute respiratory infections
in infants second birthday. parents recorded daily symptoms and
collected nose swabs weekly, batch-tested using polymerase chain
reaction assays 17 respiratory viruses.
results: one hundred fifty-eight infants participated orchid. median age
for fvdes 2.9 months human rhinovirus (hrv) ≥13.9 months for
other respiratory viruses. overall, 52% hrv fvdes symptomatic, compared
with 57%-83% fvdes. respiratory syncytial virus human
metapneumovirus fvdes severe hrv fvdes. older age winter
season associated symptomatic episodes.
conclusions: infants always experience respiratory symptoms their
fvde. predominance early hrv detections highlights need timing any
intervention early life. fvdes respiratory viruses commonly
occur maternal vaccines may longer provide protection.
