cervical carcinogenesis multistep process appears initiated by
infection squamous epithelial cells cervix one limited number
of human papillomavirus (hpv) types. however, mechanisms involved the
evolution benign, hpv-induced lesions malignancy yet fully
elucidated. transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-beta), multifunctional growth 
factor produced cells skin, inhibits proliferation foreskin 
cervical keratinocytes vitro. examined effects tgf-beta growth
and virus early-gene expression cell lines immortalized two hpv types

that normal hpv-positive cells expressed similar levels tgf-beta 1 mrnas
and exhibited similar patterns responsiveness three isoforms tgf-beta in

hpv-immortalized cells selected resistance vitro differentiation
signals remained sensitive tgf-beta-mediated growth inhibition. results,
showing growth virus gene expression hpv-transformed cells 
responsive tgf-beta, suggest endogenous growth factors produced by
different cell types squamous epithelium may play role progression of
cervical neoplasia.
