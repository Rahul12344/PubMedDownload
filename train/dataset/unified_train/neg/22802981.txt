phlebotomine sand flies transmit leishmania, phlebo-viruses bartonella to
humans. prominent gap knowledge sand fly biology remains ecology 
of immature stages. sand flies, unlike mosquitoes breed water and
only small numbers larvae recovered diverse habitats that
provide stable temperatures, high humidity decaying organic matter. we
describe studies designed identify characterize sand fly breeding habitats
in judean desert focus cutaneous leishmaniasis. detect breeding habitats 
we constructed emergence traps comprising sand fly-proof netting covering defined
areas cave openings. large size horizontal sticky traps within confined
spaces used trap sand flies. newly eclosed male sand flies were
identified based un-rotated genitalia. cumulative results show that
phlebotomus sergenti vector leishmania tropica rests breeds inside
caves also home rock hyraxes (the reservoir hosts l. tropica) 
several rodent species. emerging sand flies also trapped outside covered
caves, probably arriving caves smaller, concealed cracks in
the rocky ledges close by. man-made support walls constructed large boulders
were also identified breeding habitats ph. sergenti albeit less important 
than caves. soil samples obtained caves burrows rich organic
matter salt content. study developed put practice a
generalized experimental scheme identifying sand fly breeding habitats and
for assessing quantities flies emerge them. improved
understanding sand fly larval ecology facilitate implementation 
effective control strategies sand fly vectors leishmania.
