cdnas two distinct type iii cgmp-inhibited (cgi) cyclic nucleotide
phosphodiesterases (pde), designated cgip1 cgip2, previously cloned from
rat adipose human cardiac cdna libraries, respectively. study,
another cdna (approximately 4.0 kilobase (kb)) encoding cgi-pde 74 kda (658 
amino acids) isolated human placental cdna library. nucleotide
sequence open reading frame virtually identical corresponding
region 3' portion cardiac cgip2 cdna (approximately 7.6 kb) which
encoded approximately 125-kda cgi-pde (1141 amino acid). northern blots and
rnase protection assays revealed prominent 4.4-kb transcript 7.6-kb
transcript human placenta. transcription start site 4.4-kb
transcript assigned cardiac cdna nucleotide 1292, putative beginning
of exon 3 human cgip2 gene, potential translation initiation site
183 bases downstream, determined rnase protection assay. 5'-flanking
region 4.4-kb transcript exhibited promoter activity hela cells which
expressed 4.4-kb transcript, contained tataa sequence 35 base pairs
upstream tentative transcription start site. recombinant cgi-pdes,
expressed sf9 cells 7.6- 4.0-kb cdna, exhibited differences in
their subcellular localization km cgmp. thus, human tissues,
alternative transcription may contribute generating least two cgip2
isoforms, cytosolic membrane-associated cgi-pdes different km values for
cgmp.
