background: aim study assess relationship il-18
gene polymorphisms hbv-related diseases whether polymorphisms
influence expression guangxi zhuang population.
materials methods: enrolled 129 chronic hbv infected (chb) patients, 86
hbv-related liver cirrhosis (lc) patients 160 healthy controls study. 
polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods were
used detect il-18 gene -607c/a, -137g/c polymorphisms, elisa kit was
employed determine serum il-18 levels.
results: correlation found -607c/a polymorphism risk of
hbv-related disease. -137g/c polymorphism, gc genotype c allele
were associated significantly lower risk chb (95%ci: 0.32-0.95, p=0.034
and 95%ci: 0.35-0.91, p=0.018) hbv-related lc (95%ci: 0.24-0.89, p=0.022 
95%ci: 0.28-0.90, p=0.021). similar decreased risk also found the
a-607c-137 haplotype. respect il-18 expression, significantly
lower patient groups, association noted two
polymorphisms il-18 gene expression.
conclusions: study indicated -137c allele il-18 gene may a
protective factor hbv-related disease, serum il-18 level may inversely
associated chb hbv-related lc.
