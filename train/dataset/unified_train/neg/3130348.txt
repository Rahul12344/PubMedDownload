the effect culture supernatant mt-2 cells human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv)-producing cells, molt-4/hivhtlv-iiib cells, examined. compared to
the effect molt-4 cells, parent cells infected hiv, selective
cytotoxic/cytostatic effect molt-4/hivhtlv-iiib cells observed 4 days
after treatment 640-fold-diluted mt-2 supernatant. furthermore, 
similar conditions, 2- 6-fold increase number hiv particles was
detected culture molt-4/hivhtlv-iiib cells 6 hr treatment.
complete blocking effects anti-lymphotoxin monoclonal antibody, but
not anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody, indicates effects mt-2 
supernatant molt-4/hivhtlv-iiib cells attributable a
lymphotoxin-related cytotoxic factor.
