the immune control hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection essential viral
clearance. therefore, restoring functional anti-hbv immunity promising
immunotherapeutic approach treatment chronic infection. plasmacytoid
dendritic cells (pdcs) play crucial role triggering antiviral immunity
through ability capture process viral antigens subsequently
induce adaptive immune responses. investigated potential pdcs to
trigger antiviral cellular immunity hbv. used human leukocyte
antigen (hla-a)*0201(+) pdc line loaded hla-a*0201-restricted peptides
derived hepatitis b core/hepatitis b surface (hbc/hbs) antigens amplify
specific cd8 cells ex vivo chronic hbv patients established a
hepato-hupbl mouse model address therapeutic potential strategy 
vivo. stimulation pbmcs liver-infiltrating lymphocytes hla-a*0201(+)
chronic hbv patients hbc peptide-loaded pdcs elicited 23.1% 76.1%
hbv-specific cd8 cells 45.8% cases. specific cells the
"responder" group secreted interferon-γ, expressed cd107 upon restimulation, 
efficiently lysed hbv antigen-expressing hepatocytes. circulating hepatitis b e
antigen (hbeag) found distinguish group patients responding 
the pdc stimulation. therapeutic efficacy pdc vaccine evaluated in
immunodeficient nod-scid β(2) m(-/-) mice reconstituted hbv patients' pbmcs 
and xenotransplanted human hbv-transfected hepatocytes. vaccination of
hepato-hupbl mice hbc/hbs peptide-loaded pdcs elicited hbv-specific t
cells able specifically lyse transfected hepatocytes reduce the
systemic viral load.conclusion: pdcs loaded hbv-derived peptides elicit 
functional virus-specific cells. hbeag appears critical determining
the outcome immunotherapies chronic hbv patients. pdc-based
immunotherapeutic approach could interest attempts restore functional
antiviral immunity, critical control virus chronic hbv
patients.
