we established quantitative flow cytometric method determination herpes 
simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) susceptibility acyclovir (acv), ganciclovir, 
foscarnet vitro. susceptibility defined terms drug concentration
which reduced number cells expressing hsv-1 glycoprotein c (gpc) a
fluorescence intensity > =10(2) 50% (ic50). flow cytometry allowed us to
use high (1.0) well low (0.005) multiplicity infection, and
determination ic50 possible one viral replicative
cycles. ic50s dependent virus input time postinfection. mixture
experiments, 1 2% resistant viruses added sensitive strain could be
detected. results obtained flow cytometry showed good qualitative
correlation achieved cytopathic effect inhibitory assay. however,
flow cytometry might detect quantitative differences drug susceptibility,
especially among resistant strains, confirmed also determination of
intracellular drug phosphorylation. mean ic50s acv-sensitive strains were
0.45 1.47 microm, acv-resistant strains 140 and
3,134 microm. flow cytometric analysis fast accurate, automatizable, 
highly reproducible. flow cytometry may powerful tool standard
cytopathic effect-based assays could advantages detection low
levels drug resistance mixtures sensitive resistant virus strains.
