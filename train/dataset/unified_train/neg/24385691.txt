objective: intratumoral administration adenoviral vector encoding herpes
simplex virus (hsv) thymidine kinase (tk) gene (ad-tk) followed systemic
ganciclovir (gcv) effective approach treating experimental
hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). however, hepatotoxicity due unwanted vector
spread suicide gene expression limited application therapy.
mir-122 abundant, liver-specific microrna whose expression decreased 
human primary hcc hcc-derived cell lines. different expression profiles
provide opportunity induce tumor-specific gene expression mir-122
regulation.
methods: inserting mir-122 target sequences (mir-122t) 3' untranslated 
region (utr) tk gene, constructed adenovirus (ad) vectors expressing
mir-122-regulated tk (ad-tk-122t) report genes. intratumoral
administration ad vectors orthotopic mir-122-deficient hcc mouse
model, observed mir-122-regulated transgene expression assessed the
antitumor activity safety ad-tk-122t.
results: insertion mir-122t specifically down-regulated transgene expression
in vitro selectively protected mir-122-positive cells killing by
tk/gcv treatment. insertion mir-122t led significant reduction tansgene 
expression liver without inhibition expression tumors vivo,
resulting 11-fold improvement tumor-specific transgene expression.
intratumoral injection ad vectors mediated tk/gcv system led vector
dosage-dependent regression tumor. insertion mir-122t not
influence antitumor effects suicide gene therapy. whereas mice
administrated ad-tk showed severe lethal hepatotoxicity effective
therapeutic dose, liver damage found ad-tk-122t group.
conclusions: mir-122-regulated tk expression achieved effective anti-tumor
effects increased safety intratumoral delivery adenovirus-mediated 
tk/gcv gene therapy mir-122-deficient hcc.
