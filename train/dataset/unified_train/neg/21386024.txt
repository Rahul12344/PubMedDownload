objective: determine adherence levels needed hiv virologic suppression
with newer antiretroviral (arv) medications, including darunavir, etravirine, and
raltegravir.
data sources: literature searches pubmed, medline (1950-october 2010), and
google scholar performed using following key words multiple
combinations: antiretroviral, hiv, aids, adherence, darunavir, raltegravir, and
etravirine. review bibliographies retrieved articles performed to
identify additional references.
study selection data extraction: articles english identified from
the data sources evaluated. studies state names medications
or drug classes studied excluded.
data synthesis: differing levels adherence needed maintain
virologic suppression, depending arv class used. adherence level
needed unboosted protease inhibitors (pis) established greater
than 95%, recent studies shown greater 80% adherence to
boosted pis may sufficient. nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
(nnrtis) could require lower adherence rates boosted pis; however, study
results varied nnrtis carry potential developing resistance with
nonadherence. studies assessing adherence needed raltegravir yet 
be performed.
conclusions: studies shown differing levels adherence needed among arv
classes medications. advent boosted pis potent medications,
the amount adherence needed dropped since 1990s. although current 
data useful, discrepancies results due methods of
adherence measurement. knowing adherence levels needed valuable in
helping determine optimal arv regimen patients, given adherence 
barriers. knowledge also help determine patients require in-depth 
adherence counseling. research reliable method measuring
adherence essential determine adherence levels needed newer arv
medications, including darunavir, etravirine, raltegravir.
