cucumber mosaic virus important plant pathogen broad host range
encompassing many plant species. study demonstrates production of
transgenic potato lines exhibiting complete resistance cucumber mosaic virus
strain post transcriptional gene silencing. two constructs used, 
one, pekh2in2cmvai, contains inverted repeat 1,138 bp fragment defective 
cmv replicase gene derived rna2 cucumber mosaic virus strain (cmv-o),
while other, trv-based vigs vector (ptrv2cmvai), contains fragment
of replicase gene, without inverted repeat. constructs used to
produce transgenic potato lines cultivar 'danshaku', susceptible genotype to
cmv. transgenic lines derived pekh2in2cmvai accumulated small interfering
rna (sirna) virus challenge, whereas derived from
ptrv2cmvai showed sirna expression virus challenge. transgenic lines
were challenged cmv-o cmv-y, four lines exhibited complete (100%)
resistance strains, whereas lines high levels of
resistance. infectivity cmv-o lower cmv-y highly
resistant plants. significant differences regard resistance
between plants derived pekh2in2cmvai obtained ptrv2cmvai. the
presence cmv-specific sirna resistant phenotypes indicates the
resistance acquired rna silencing.
