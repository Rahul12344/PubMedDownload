a peptide reproducing g-h loop amino acid sequence foot-and-mouth disease 
virus vp1 protein fused solvent-exposed c-terminus the
bacteriophage p22 tailspike protein [carbonell villaverde (1996) gene, in
press], homotrimeric polypeptide strong beta-helical structure. this
fusion interfere biological activities phage tail. the
antigenic profile complex antigenic site within g-h loop been
determined competitive elisa panel monoclonal antibodies directed
against different overlapping b-cell epitopes. antigenic data been
compared obtained set 12 chimeric beta-galactosidases
displaying g-h loop different exposed regions. high coincidence been
evidenced antigenicity viral peptide fused phage
protein peptides inserted exposed loop activating
interface beta-galactosidase. indicates completely different
structural frameworks carrier proteins provide similar constraints that
allow recombinant peptide successfully mimic antigenicity, and
probably conformational features, natural peptide virion surface.
