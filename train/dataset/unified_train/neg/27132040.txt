the glycoprotein (g) surface protein lyssavirus particle and
the viral product known capable eliciting production of
neutralizing antibodies. study, isolation escape mutants resistant
to monoclonal antibody (mab) neutralization attempted selection strategy
employing four distinct rabies virus strains: extensively passaged evelyn
rokitnicki abelseth (era) strain three field isolates representing two
bat-associated variants western canada skunk variant (wskv). escape
mutants generated either bat-associated viral variants two
neutralization mutants derived wskv isolate. seven independent era 
mutants recovered using mabs directed antigenic sites (four
mutants) iiia (three mutants) glycoprotein. cross-neutralization
patterns viral mutants used determine precise location and
nature g protein epitopes recognized mabs. nucleotide sequencing 
of g gene indicated mutants derived using mabs directed to
antigenic site (as) iii contained amino acid substitutions site.
however, four mutants selected mabs, two bore mutations within
as expected remaining two carried mutations ii. wskv mutants
exhibited mutations sites appropriate mabs used their
selection. era mutant preparations cytopathogenic parental
virus propagated cell culture; vivo pathogenicity mice was
examined, three mutants exhibited reduced pathogenicity the
remaining four mutants exhibited comparable pathogenic properties the
parent virus.
