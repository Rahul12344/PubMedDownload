use adjuvant containing pathogen pattern recognition receptor agonists one 
of effective strategies enhance efficacy licensed vaccines. this
study, investigated efficacy avian influenza vaccines containing an
adjuvant (cvcva5) composed polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic,
resiquimod, imiquimod, muramyl dipeptide levomisole. avian influenza vaccines
adjuvanted cvcva5 found induce significantly higher titers of
hemagglutiniton inhibition antibodies (p≤0.01) commercial vaccines 
at 2-, 3- 4-week post vaccination specific pathogen free (spf)
chickens field application. furthermore, virus shedding reduced spf
chickens immunized h9-cvcva5 vaccine h9 subtype heterologous virus
challenge. ratios cd3(+)cd4(+) cd3(+)cd8(+) lymphocytes were
slowly elevated chickens immunized h9-cvcva5 vaccine. lymphocytes
adoptive transfer study indicates cd8(+) lymphocyte subpopulation might
have contributed improved protection heterologous virus challenge.
results study suggest adjuvant cvcva5 capable enhancing
the potency existing avian influenza vaccines increasing humoral and
cellular immune response.
