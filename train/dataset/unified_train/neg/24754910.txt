a conceptually new idea quantitative structure-activity relationships (qsar)
which makes use ensembles molecular dynamics (md) trajectories and
information retrieved enzyme-inhibitor binding thermodynamics presented
in study. new methodology, termed ensemble comparative residue
interaction analysis (ecoria), attempts overcome current one chemical-one 
structure-one parameter value dogma computational chemistry modeling the
biological activity function molecular descriptors derived an
ensemble conformers enzyme-inhibitor complexes. approach distinctly 
different standard qsar methodology uses single low-energy
conformation properties averaged set conformers correlate
with activity. conformational ensemble derived md simulations is
analyzed distribution non-bonded interaction energies (steric,
electrostatic, hydrophobic) along solvation, strain, entropic energy
of inhibitors individual amino acid residues receptor and
these correlated activity qsar model. scope new
method demonstrated three diverse enzyme-inhibitor data-sets - glycogen
phosphorylase b, human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease cyclin-dependent
kinase 2. qsar equations derived methodology revealed the
structure activity relationships previously reported classes of
molecules well uncovered features hitherto unknown may
have hidden role driving ligand-receptor-binding process. impressive
improvements predictions affinity achieved compared 
qsar formalisms namely comfa, comsia (receptor-independent qsar techniques), 
coria (a receptor-dependent qsar technique). ecoria could provide an
understanding thermodynamic properties influencing ligand-receptor
binding time scale sampled md simulation. advantage of
analyzing enzyme-inhibitor interaction energies statistical domain that
the noise due inaccuracies potential energy functions reduced
and mechanistically important interaction terms related protein-ligand binding
specificity identified assist medicinal chemists in
designing new molecules biologists studying influence of
position-specific mutations receptor ligand binding.
