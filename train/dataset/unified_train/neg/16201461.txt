objective: construct infectious japanese encephalitis virus (jev) based the
in vitro-ligated cdna template vaccine strain sa14-14-2, identify 
virus.
methods: full-length genomic cdna jev sa14-14-2 strain ligated then
rna transcribed vitro, infective virus obtained transfecting
the rna vero cells identified.
results: infective clone jev constructed, virulence weaker
than wild virus.
conclusion: possible construct infectious clone production
strain live attenuated japanese b encephalitis vaccine.
