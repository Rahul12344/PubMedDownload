objectives: hepatitis c virus (hcv) f protein newly identified protein
encoded alternative open reading frame +1 overlaps core-encoding gene.
it found regulation c-myc p53 genes hcv core protein is
involved liver cancer genesis. wondered whether hcv f protein exerts
similar adverse regulatory effects transcription c-myc p53
genes.
methods: hcv f gene-containing, plasmid pcdna3.1-f hcv core gene-containing
pcdna3.1-c constructed transiently transfected hepg(2) cells.
real-time quantitative pcr western blotting used determine changes 
at transcription translation levels c-myc p53 genes.
results: transcription level c-myc much higher pcdna3.1-f
transfected cells without plasmid transfected. whereas level of
p53 transcription pcdna3.1-f transfected cells lower the
parental cells. moreover, levels c-myc expression up-regulated 
of p53 expression down-regulated hcv f protein.
conclusions: hcv f protein regulatory properties cellular oncogene c-myc
and anti-oncogene p53, may implicated formation hepatocellular
carcinoma.
