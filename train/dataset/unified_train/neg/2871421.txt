lymphadenopathy (pgl), 13 (40%) remained symptom-free. 15 men
seroconverted study (7% per annum), 8 progressed pgl.
serial estimations lymphocyte subsets showed progressive reduction t4
numbers seropositive groups, indices also varied widely the
seronegative group. counts t4 t8 cells t4/t8 ratio entry of
prognostic value. seronegative subjects likely seropositives have
abnormal immunological tests. serial measurement lymphocyte subsets seems to
be little prognostic clinical value monitoring populations
infected htlv-iii/lav virus. strongest association prognosis
was episode sexually transmitted disease six months entry

important co-factor acquisition htlv-iii/lav infection, in
subsequent disease progression.
