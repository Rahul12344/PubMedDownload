the reliability hybrid capture ii (hc-ii; digene, silver spring, md,
u.s.a.) assay tested detecting 18 human papillomavirus (hpv) types the
screening cervical lesions. cytology, hpv testing, colposcopy, biopsy were
used monitor 204 women normal smears first entry. median
follow-up 15 months (range, 4-27 months). primary endpoint clinical
progression defined presence cervical intraepithelial lesion the
biopsy. patient population 204 hpv-infected women, 81 (39.7%) a
persistent hpv infection two three examinations final histologic
diagnosis 14 high-grade 13 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions
(sil) within 4 22 months. women regressive hpv infection develop 
any lesion period. evaluation viral load high-risk 
hpv hc-ii represent sensitive approach predict the
persistence apparition high-grade lesions. thus, persistent high-risk
hpv infection detected hc-ii represents reliable tool select
populations risk development high-grade cervical lesions.
