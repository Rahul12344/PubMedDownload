by capitalizing initially puzzling observations unpredictable transgene
silencing variable expression, plant scientists pioneered research 
a novel type epigenetic regulation, termed homology-dependent gene silencing. 
this silencing process implications natural mechanisms gene expression
in plants eukaryotes, branched studies reversible
dna modifications; rna metabolism, transport processing; host responses
to plant viruses, viroids transposable elements. analysis transgene
silencing systems enriched understanding epigenetic phenomena,
including paramutation, well heterosis genome evolution. research 
is also highly relevant biotechnology industry, interested in
avoiding unwanted transgene silencing genetically engineered lines in
exploiting various types silencing inactivate specific genes.
homology-dependent gene silencing also used high-throughput approaches 
for functional genomics.
