bluetongue virus tubules purified spodoptera frugiperda cells infected 
with recombinant baculovirus containing ns1 gene bluetongue virus
serotype 10, expressed control autographa californica nuclear
polyhedrosis virus polyhedrin promoter. tubules subjected variety
of chemical physical treatments resulting effects tubule
morphology examined electron microscopy. number morphological
similarities noted bluetongue virus tubules cellular
microtubules despite lack homology component proteins the
primary sequence level. possible multistranded helical configuration is
proposed tubule structure.
