background: reversing immune exhaustion anti-pd-l1 antibody may improve
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1)-specific immunity increase
clearance hiv-1-expressing cells.
methods: conducted phase i, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
dose-escalating study bms-936559, including hiv-1-infected adults aged >18 
<70 years suppressive antiretroviral therapy cd4+ counts >350 cells/μl
and detectable plasma hiv-1 rna single-copy assay. data single infusions of
bms-936559 (0.3 mg/kg) versus placebo described. primary outcomes were
safety defined grade 3 greater immune-related adverse event (ae) and
the change hiv-1 gag-specific cd8+ cell responses baseline day 28
after infusion.
results: eight men enrolled: 6 received 0.3 mg/kg bms-936559, 2 received
placebo infusions. bms-936559-related grade 3 greater aes. 1 
participant, asymptomatic hypophysitis (a protocol-defined immune-related ae) was
identified 266 days bms-936559 infusion; resolved time. mean
percentage hiv-1 gag-specific cd8+ cells expressing interferon γ increased
from baseline (0.09%) day 28 (0.20%; p = .14), driven substantial
increases 2 participants received bms-936559.
conclusions: first evaluation immunologic checkpoint inhibitor in
healthy hiv-1-infected persons, single low-dose bms-936559 infusions appeared 
enhance hiv-1-specific immunity subset participants.
