the currently used vaccine strain rinderpest virus derived serial
passage highly virulent kabete 'o' strain (ko). full-length cdna copy of
the ko strain made virus identical pathogenicity the
wild-type virus rescued. series chimeric viruses prepared which
the coding sequences n, p, f, h l proteins replaced the
corresponding sequences vaccine strain. ko-based virus the
vaccine strain h gene carboxy-terminal half l gene
replaced corresponding sequence vaccine strain retained 
almost virulence original ko virus. animals infected the
ko-based virus containing vaccine strain n, p f gene, the
amino-terminal half l gene, developed high prolonged pyrexia and
leukopenia, reduced absent lesions clinical signs; although
partially attenuated, none nearly attenuated vaccine strain itself.
these data indicate high attenuation stability current
vaccine due accumulation number separate mutations, none of
which sufficiently debilitating strong selective
pressure favour revertant.
