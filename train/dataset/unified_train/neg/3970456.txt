granulocyte membrane perturbation activates oxidative metabolism release
of highly reactive species (o2-, h2o2, oh., 'o2) emission light
(chemiluminescence (cl)). using cl response measure oxidative
metabolism, assayed effects influenza granulocyte respiratory 
burst. human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) isolated ficoll-hypaque 
cushioning dextran sedimentation. isolated pmns incubated with
egg-grown influenza (h3n2) virus, medium control, presence 1
microm luminol fresh autologous serum (10%). light emission occurred
during incubation pmns medium control. influenza (33 50%
egg-infective-doses (eid50):1 pmn) stimulated pmn light emission maximal
response (48,386 +/- 10,764 cpm/10(6) pmn) occurring 37 degrees cl was
dependent virus dose diminished response (6,041 +/- 3,200 cpm/10(6)
pmn) occurring lower infectivity 10 eid50:1 pmn. chemiluminescence
responses similar infective noninfective virus particles (heat
inactivated, 56 degrees c x 2 h). fresh serum necessary influenza
virus cause cl response. significant correlation (p less 0.01)
existed level light emission hemagglutination-inhibiting
(hi) antibody titer influenza autologous serum. virus absence 
of detectable antibody stimulate cl. virus-associated cl was
completely inhibited autologous serum heated (56 degrees c x 30 min) if
the pmns pretreated cytochalasin b (5 mcg/ml x 5 min). findings
suggest influenza a-associated pmn cl requires antibody, complement, and
phagocytosis.(abstract truncated 250 words)
