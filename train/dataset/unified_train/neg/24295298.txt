the ability deplete specific proteins cells transformed cell biology.
targeting gene transcripts using rna interference allowed highly
refined approach analysis gene function applied all
aspects cell biology. developments technology reached point
where relatively trivial task assess role individual
protein particular cell function. rnai also allows genome-wide screening
as discovery step toward identification new components cellular
pathways machines. technique applied extensively analysis
of golgi complex function, leading significant insight biology of
this complex organelle. here, describe commonly used options targeting
individual genes transient stable knockdown. consider the
alternative methods introducing reagents cells outline methods
that others used widely validation specificity efficacy of
gene targeting.
