atp binding cassette (abc) transporters transfer variety antiviral
agents cytoplasm body fluid, results reduced intracellular
concentration drugs. proteins hiv-1, e.g., tat gp120, altered 
types abc transporter expression brain microvascular endothelial cells 
astrocytes. however, effect tat abc transporters lymphocytes is
unclear. study status breast cancer resistance protein (bcrp) in
tat expressing cell lines examined real-time pcr flow cytometry. 
was found hiv-1 tat protein upregulated bcrp expression enhanced efflux 
mediated bcrp significantly, could inhibit antiviral drugs entering
infected cells interfere therapeutic effect haart.
