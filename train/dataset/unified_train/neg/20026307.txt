viperin interferon-inducible protein inhibiting many dna rna viruses.
it contains n-terminal transmembrane helix, highly conserved c-terminus 
a middle region carrying cx3cx2c motif, characteristic radical
s-adenosyl-l-methionine (sam) enzymes. far structural characterization 
been reported reconstitution [4fe-4s] cluster viperin failed.
here, dissecting 361-residue human viperin 12 fragments, followed 
extensive cd nmr characterization, viperin (45-361) identified be
soluble structured buffers. importantly, successfully
reconstituted [4fe-4s] cluster viperin (45-361), thus providing first 
experimental evidence confirming viperin indeed radical sam enzyme.
furthermore, c-terminus viperin (214-361) insoluble buffers but
again solubilized salt-free water appears partially folded. 
our results thus imply radical sam enzyme activity may play key role
in broad antiviral actions viperin.
