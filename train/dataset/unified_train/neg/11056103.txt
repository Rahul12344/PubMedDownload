background: gene transfer vessel wall may provide new possibilities for
the treatment vascular disorders, postangioplasty restenosis. 
study, analyzed effects adenovirus-mediated vascular endothelial growth
factor (vegf)-c gene transfer neointima formation endothelial denudation
in rabbits. comparison, second group treated vegf-a adenovirus and
a third group lacz adenovirus. clinical-grade adenoviruses used the
study.
methods results: aortas cholesterol-fed new zealand white rabbits were
balloon-denuded, gene transfer performed 3 days later. animals were
euthanized 2 4 weeks gene transfer, intima/media ratio (i/m),
histology, cell proliferation analyzed. two weeks gene
transfer, i/m lacz-transfected control group 0. 57+/-0.04. vegf-c gene
transfer reduced i/m 0.38+/-0.02 (p:<0.05 versus lacz group). i/m in
vegf-a-treated animals 0.49+/-0.17 (p:=ns). tendency vegf
groups smaller i/m persisted 4-week time point, lacz group
had i/m 0.73+/-0.16, vegf-c group 0.44+/-0.14, vegf-a group 0. 
63+/-0.21 (p:=ns). expression vegf receptors 1, 2, 3 detected the
vessel wall immunocytochemistry situ hybridization. additional
control, effect adenovirus cell proliferation analyzed by
performing gene transfer intact aorta without endothelial denudation. no
differences seen smooth muscle cell proliferation i/m lacz
adenovirus 0.9% saline-treated animals.
conclusions: adenovirus-mediated vegf-c gene transfer may useful the
treatment postangioplasty restenosis vessel wall thickening vascular
manipulations.
