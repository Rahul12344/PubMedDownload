background/aims: hepatitis virus superinfection hepatitis b virus carriers
produces additional damage already injured liver. earlier reports noted
that development hepatocellular carcinoma may accelerated hepatitis 
d virus-superinfected patients. study aimed investigate impact of
hepatitis virus clinical course hepatitis b virus-associated
hepatocellular carcinoma.
methods: total 42 consecutive hepatocellular carcinoma cases seropositive
for antibody hepatitis virus antigen (anti-hdv) found 1986 to
1994; clinical manifestations, treatment outcomes compared 255 
consecutive hepatocellular carcinoma cases seropositive hepatitis b virus
surface antigen seronegative anti-hdv.
results: mean age 60 years groups patients. features,
including sex, duration follow-up, presence cirrhosis ascites, serum
biochemistry, status hbv-e antigen, gross microscopic tumor
appearance, significantly different two groups. though 
patients anti-hdv-positive group underwent active treatment (operation 
transcatheter arterial chemoembolization) anti-hdv-negative
group (54.8% 42 versus 34.9% 255 cases, p = 0.02), cumulative 4-year
survival rates (9.5% versus 9.8%) similar. anti-hdv-positive
hepatocellular carcinoma patients, tumor size < 5 cm active treatment were
favorable prognostic predictors associated survival > 18 months.
conclusion: hepatitis virus superinfection accelerate development 
of hepatocellular carcinoma. clinical manifestations similar, the
outcome anti-hdv-positive patients worse general
hbv-associated hepatocellular carcinoma patients, long diagnosed 
at early stage actively treated.
