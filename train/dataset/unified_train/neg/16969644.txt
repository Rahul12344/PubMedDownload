aims/hypothesis: enterovirus infections long suspected be
environmental factors may cause type 1 diabetes, pathways leading
from infection beta cell destruction still unknown. therefore examined 
whether enterovirus infection human islets leads upregulation of
interferon-gamma-inducible protein (ip-10, known chemokine [c-x-c motif]
ligand 10 [cxcl10]), chemokine important induction insulitis.
methods: isolated human islets infected three different strains of
coxsackie b4 virus. ip-10 expression secretion infected human islets
were measured using rt-pcr elisa several time points.
results: ip-10 clearly upregulated secreted human islets during
enterovirus infection. demonstrated three different strains of
coxsackie b4 virus, two lytic islets one non-lytic
and establish persistent infection human islets.
conclusions/interpretation: propose enterovirus-induced upregulation of
ip-10 infection islets vivo first step towards
destructive insulitis. findings support idea enterovirus infection
triggers immune-mediated beta cell destruction, first time suggest 
possible mechanism behind enterovirus-induced diabetes.
