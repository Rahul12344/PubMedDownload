a sensitive method detection isolation recombinants of
foot-and-mouth disease virus.

recombination temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants foot-and-mouth
disease (fmd) virus examined, using infectious centre technique was
more sensitive (approx. 30-fold) conventional virus yield test. test
involved brief incubation mixedly infected cells permissive
temperature allow recombination occur followed assay restrictive 
temperature select cells recombination occurred. with
crosses involving widely separated mutations, many 28% infected
cells produced presumptive recombinant plaques. since plaque result 
of independent event, large numbers different presumptive recombinants
could isolated study. analysis presumptive recombinant plaques 
from variety crosses showed that, general, virus produced the
properties expected recombinants. approximate correlation found between
genetic distance, determined yield recombination test, the
percentage recombinant infectious centres observed. phenomenon very
sensitive balance input multiplicities two parent
viruses occurred early virus replication. test considerable
potential study genetic interactions fmd virus, would be
surprising potential limited picornaviruses.
