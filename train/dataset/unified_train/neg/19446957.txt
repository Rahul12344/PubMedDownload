a recent study described first time patient group suffered from
spontaneous chronic pain recurrent herpes simplex virus (hsv)
infections. patients pain widespread areas one side body and
were--due subtle immunological abnormalities--susceptible hsv infections.
although clinical features pain suggested involvement central
nervous system, supporting evidence lacking. objective this
study search changes central nervous system could account 
for chronic pain patients. monitored central processing of
pain touch eight patients 11 healthy control subjects, received
painful heat innocuous tactile stimuli hands functional
magnetic resonance imaging. possible changes gray matter density the
brain assessed voxel-based morphometry. found functional changes 
the patients' central pain circuitry: activation heat pain weaker 
control subjects insular cortices, anterior cingulate cortex (acc), and
thalamus, activations innocuous tactile stimuli similar both
groups. gray matter density decreased patients' frontal prefrontal
cortices acc. observed functional structural changes the
central pain circuitry, together clinical features chronic pain
support hypothesis central involvement development chronic pain
in patients.
