immunity induced influenza vaccines following hematopoietic stem-cell
transplantation (hsct) poorly understood. here, 14 pediatric recipients (mean 
age: 6 years) received h1n1 (n=9) h1n1/h3n2 (n=5) vaccines median 5.7 
months post-hsct (hla-identical related bone-marrow graft: 10/14). fourteen
clinically-matched non-vaccinated recipients included controls. cellular 
response vaccination assessed t-cell proliferation assay. humoral
response assessed h1n1-specific antibody titration. il2 ifnγ responses
to influenza also evaluated intracellular cytokine accumulation method
for recipients. higher proliferative responses h1n1 (p=0.0001) and
higher h1n1-specific antibody titers (p<0.02) observed vaccines opposed
to non-vaccinated recipients. cases, proliferative responses h1n1
developed time antibody titers reach protective (≥1:40)
levels. recipients vaccinated h1n1 strain proliferative
responses h1n1 h3n2 (median stimulation index h1n1: 96, h3n2: 126 
responders). finally, il2 responses predominated ifnγ responses (p<0.02) 
influenza viruses responders. conclusion, h1n1 vaccination induced
substantial cell-mediated immunity, lesser extent, humoral immunity at
early times post-hsct. h1n1/h3n2 t-cell cross-reactivity protective (il2)
rather effector (ifnγ) cytokinic profiles elicited.
