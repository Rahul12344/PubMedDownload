study provide overview activities pwud decentralised
vaccination program netherlands explore determinants associated
with completing standard hepatitis b vaccination series.
methods: used data behavioural risk groups register the
national vaccination program. data concerned pwud immunised 
hepatitis b netherlands 2002 2011. standard series three 
vaccinations (at 0, 1, 6 months) offered inclusion continued
if serological markers past chronic hbv infection absent. completion 
of vaccination series (at least three vaccinations, irrespective timing) was
a dependent variable logistic regression analysis.
results: program reached 18,054 pwud. 15,746 participants eligible for
vaccination (i.e. neither carriers hepatitis b immune to
hepatitis b), 9089 (58%) completed series three hepatitis b vaccinations.
factors associated higher completion rate vaccination series
(p < 0.01) were: starting vaccination earlier years program, older 
age pwud, intravenous drug use, vaccine administration addiction care
centres, flexibility location vaccine delivery.
conclusion: despite using standard hbv vaccination schedule financial
incentives, vaccination completion among pwud relatively high. results
suggest flexibility vaccination location administration vaccines
by healthcare workers sustainable contact pwud could improve
vaccination programs risk group.
