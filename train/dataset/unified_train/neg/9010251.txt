this study performed analyse correlates viral escape aids patients. 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) hiv- donors inoculated with
aids patients' serum detect neutralization-resistant cell-free virus.
infectious virus detected polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysed 
sequencing v3 region. escaped virus species compared v3
virus variants found patients' pbmc plasma. one patient escaped
virus also compared variants found cd4+ cells isolated facs from
blood, spleen lymph node. frequency virus variants determined 
by cloning sequence analysis 20 v3 clones pcr amplification. to
monitor anti-v3 antibodies elisa, v3 sequence expressed fusion
with glutathione s-transferase (gst-v3). aids patients, v3-directed
antibody response infectious virus v3 loop detectable. in
contrast, virus variants unable infect donor pbmc vitro well
recognized homologous v3-directed antibody. interval 1 year the
frequency variants clearly decreased, time escaped
variants grew finally represented predominant viral species in
plasma pbmc. infectious variants lacking v3 antibody response also
predominant cd4+ cells spleen lymph node. data indicate 
escape virus variants closely related lack v3-directed antibody.
