brazil. htlv-1 prevalence 3.85%, 1.56%, 1.23% three villages.
phylogenetic analysis ltr region demonstrated positive samples
analyzed belonged transcontinental subgroup htlv-1 cosmopolitan
subtype. three new htlv-1 sequences formed well-supported clade within
one latin american clusters contain south african sequence. this
latin american cluster segregated ancestor clade 
contained central african sequence. ancestral relationship could support
