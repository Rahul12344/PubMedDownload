the study objectives determine effect oral hydration therapy and
bovine respiratory disease (brd) rumination behavior, rumen ph, rumen
temperature. random subset high-risk, auction-sourced bulls 3 truckload
blocks (initial bw = 188.9 ± 19.1 kg) fitted collar containing a
3-axis accelerometer quantify rumination time activity (n = 58) and
administered rumen ph temperature data logging bolus (n = 33). arrival, 
subset calves (n = 2 per pen) balanced across treatment pens (n = 15 per
treatment; n = 10 animals per pen) randomized receive 0.57 l water/45.4 kg
bw modified oral drenching apparatus (h2o) water administration
(con). standard arrival processing procedures implemented including surgical
castration. modified-live virus respiratory vaccination delayed day 28.
technicians assigned clinical illness score (cis) daily; calves cis ≥ 2
and rectal temperature ≥ 40 °c considered brd case (rcase) treated
with antimicrobial. fixed effect brd cases vs. nontreated cohorts
(rcon) determined retrospectively using data accelerometer collar (n
= 19 29) rumen bolus (n = 12 21, rcase rcon, respectively).
daily means hourly means across days throughout 56-d observation period
were generated. fixed effects analyzed using mixed model procedure 
repeated measures. daily rumen temperature altered (p = 0.04) peak 
rumen temperature occurred earlier h2o, whereas con increased (p ≤ 0.01) 
rumen temperature following delayed vaccination day 28. calves diagnosed 
brd transiently decreased (p = 0.04) active minutes days 9 32, 
decreased (p < 0.01) active minutes 0800 2000 h, decreased (p < 0.01)
rumination time 2000 0400 h, greater (p < 0.01) rumen temperature
until delayed vaccination day 28, greater (p < 0.01) hourly rumen
temperature 0900 0300, altered (p < 0.01) rumen ph. earlier peak 
rumen temperature observed h2o may indicate physiological modification
enabling pronounced inflammatory response. differences rumination
behavior activity may useful early brd detection.
