we determined nucleotide deduced amino acid sequences vp4 genes of
five equine, two feline, two canine rotavirus strains. high degree of
homology (> 97.0%) found among vp4 amino acid sequences equine
strains h2, fi-14, fi23. equine strain l338 distinct vp4 amino acid
sequence equine strains (78.1% less homology), the
l338 vp4 exhibited 17.0% divergence amino acid level 
of rotavirus strains published far. vp4 amino acid sequence equine
strain h1, showed low homology equine strains, shares >
95.4% homology porcine strains osu ym. vp4 amino acid sequences
of feline strain cat97 canine strains cu-1 k9 showed high degree of
homology (96.8 97.2%) one another, found quite similar
(96.0-97.0% homology) human hcr3 strain recently characterized.
feline strain cat2, whose vp4 sequence distinct strain cat97, has
a vp4 similar human strains k8 au-1 (97.8 97.5% homologies at
amino acid level, respectively). thus, vp4 sequences rotaviruses showed
species specificity interspecies relatedness.
