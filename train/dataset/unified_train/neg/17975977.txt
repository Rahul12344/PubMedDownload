objective: determine proviral load bovine leukemia virus (blv)-infected
cattle without persistent lymphocytosis assess potential of
transmitting virus.
animals: cattle 6 dairy herds.
procedures: blood samples infected cows evaluated 3 times 6-month
intervals determination proviral load via pcr assay, serologic results via
elisa, hematologic status via differential cell counts.
results: infected cattle classified lymphocytotic nonlymphocytotic 
groups. lymphocytotic cattle consistently > 100,000 copies integrated
provirus/mug dna (ie, high proviral load) peripheral blood leukocytes.
titers antibodies blvgp51 blvp24 indicated strong immune
response. nonlymphocytotic cattle comprised 2 subgroups: group high
proviral load strong immune response, group weaker immune
response, mostly blvp24, proviral load < 100 copies/microg of
dna (ie, low proviral load).
conclusions clinical relevance: results emphasized importance of
characterizing nonlymphocytotic blv-infected cattle eradication programs. 
the risk transmitting blv infection nonlymphocytotic cattle may differ
depending proviral load. nonlymphocytotic cattle high proviral load
could efficient transmitters (as efficient lymphocytotic cattle), whereas
nonlymphocytotic cattle low proviral load could inefficient transmitters 
under standard husbandry conditions. cattle low proviral load
do develop anti-blvp24 antibodies, appears lack anti-blvp24
antibody response may good marker condition.
