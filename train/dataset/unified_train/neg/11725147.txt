variations major surface proteins (hbsag) hepatitis b virus (hbv) 
been implicated high rate reinfection hbv-infected recipients of
orthotopic liver transplantations (olt). sera 6 olt patients positive for
hbsag 3 recipients negative prior transplantation were
analyzed several years, 39 hbsag sequences compared. despite
anti-hbs immunoprophylaxis resulting disappearance hbsag, hbv dna was
detectable sensitive nested pcr almost sera. 1 patient, a
significant temporary shift hbv subtypes observed, indicating mixed
infection presence multiple hbv populations patient; was
also true patients. amino acid substitutions compared wild-type hbv 
subtypes 7 patients variations within patients 5 patients were
detectable time; 'escape mutation' amino acid position 145 was
detected 2 patients. data suggest high rate reinfection olt
recipients seems associated specific sequence variations the
major hbs gene, shows remarkable inter- intraindividual variability.
obviously, correlation heterogeneity gene clinical outcome
