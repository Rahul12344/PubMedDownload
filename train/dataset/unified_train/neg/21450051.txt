aims: cannabinoids proposed treating various neurodegenerative
disorders adjunct therapy hiv+ patients neurologic sequelae. 
expression cannabinoid receptors (cb1 cb2) reported in
neurodegenerative diseases simian immunodeficiency virus encephalitis, yet
the receptor expression central nervous system hiv+ individuals 
known.
methods: anti-cb1 antibody two anti-cb2 antibodies employed for
immunohistochemistry cerebral cortex white matter hiv encephalitis 
(hive) hiv-associated comorbidities, well control brains (hiv- and
hiv+).
results: quantitative image analysis, observed cb1 increased in
hive brains comorbidities, cb2 significantly increased
in white matter hive. morphologically, cb1 present neurones, and
both cb1 cb2 present meningeal macrophages subpial glia all
brains. hive, cb1 found white matter microglia perivascular cells, 
while cb2 increased microglia, astrocytes perivascular macrophages.
double immunofluorescence cell-specific markers immunoblots primary
cultured microglia astrocytes substantiated glial localization the
cannabinoid receptors specificity antibodies.
conclusions: study indicates cannabinoid receptor expression occurs in
glia hive brains, may ramifications potential use of
cannabinoid ligands hiv-infected patients.
