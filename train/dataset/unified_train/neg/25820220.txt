one nine african-american men ages 20 34 behind
bars, resulting many african-american women losing primary romantic
partners incarceration. research suggests partner incarceration may
contribute increased risk sexually transmitted infections (stis)/human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv); however, factors associated women's decisions 
to begin new sexual partnerships following partner incarceration (i.e.,
separational concurrency) well studied. study examined the
social context relevant initiating separational concurrency, following
incarceration primary male partner. cross-sectional secondary data analysis 
of 6-month follow-up data chat project, social-network based
hiv/sexually transmitted disease (std) prevention study baltimore, md, usa.
participants n = 196 african-american women, reported ever 
partner incarcerated least 6 months relationship. the
majority (81.5%) women unemployed mean age 41.7 years. over
half sample (59.5%) reported used crack heroin least 
the previous 12 months; 48.5% women experienced physical abuse, with
over half sample reporting lifetime history emotional abuse (54.6%). 
separational concurrency, defined answering yes item, "while [your]
partner incarcerated, sexual partners?," the
primary outcome measure. adjusting age, drug use unemployment the
multiple logistic regression model found women reported history of
physical emotional abuse two times likely report separational 
concurrency women without abuse history [adjusted odds ratio (aor), 2.24;
95% ci, 1.24, 4.05; p = .007 aor, 2.44; 95% ci, 1.33, 4.46; p = .004,
respectively]. individuals reported higher number drug-using sex
partners (aor, 2.49; 95% ci, 1.4, 4.5; p = .002), sex exchange partners (aor,
4.0; 95% ci, 1.8 8.9; p = .001), sexual partners engaged concurrency
(aor: 2.67; 95% ci: 1.5, 4.8; p = .001) significantly likely report 
separational concurrency. conversely, participants reported female kin
in social networks (aor, .808; 95% ci, .67, .97; p = .025), known
network members longer time (aor, .997; 95% ci, .993, .999; p = .043), and
higher levels trust network members (aor, .761; 95% ci, .63, .92;
p = .005) significantly less likely report separational concurrency.
results study demonstrate social network characteristics may be
crucial understanding separational concurrency among african-american urban
women lost partner incarceration. social network other
resource-based interventions, provide instrumental, social, economic
resources women experienced loss partner incarceration,
may important tools empowering women helping reduce the
disproportionate burden stis/hiv among low income, african-american women.
