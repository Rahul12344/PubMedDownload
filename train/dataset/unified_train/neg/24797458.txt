avian influenza viruses represent growing threat influenza pandemic. the
currently licensed influenza vaccines inherent drawbacks led many 
research groups explore different approaches vaccine development among
which virus like particles (vlps) seem like promising alternative near
future. although known matrix 1 protein (m1) influenza plays an
essential role vlp formation documented m1 able form
dimers, clear m1 capable forming higher order structures
without interference influenza proteins cell derived envelope.
here, first time demonstrated expression m1 alone is
enough form capsid like particle (clp) without requirement 
external factor.
