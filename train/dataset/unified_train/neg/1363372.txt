the evaluation presence p24 antigen membrane peripheral blood
mononuclear cells 31 hiv infected individuals presented. study was
performed indirect immunofluorescence flow cytometry data were
analyzed kolmogorov-smirnov test. values obtained [d/s(n)] result the
comparison fluorescence histograms sample control one.
cases showing p24 ag peripheral blood mononuclear cells also presented
percentages cd3, hla-dr positive cells significantly higher p24 negative 
ones. addition, d/s(n) values superior symptomatic patients in
asymptomatic ones, indicate existence correlation flow
cytometry results, viral replication clinical course. nevertheless this
study, well previous ones, high degree cross reactivity between
the anti-p24 monoclonal antibody employed normal lymphocytes been
observed. reactivity localized preferentially cd4 positive subset.
