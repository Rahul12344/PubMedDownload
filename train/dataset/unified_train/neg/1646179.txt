gp350, late epstein-barr-virus (ebv) glycoprotein expressed the
envelope viral particles ebv-producing cells, also candidate for
the development anti-ebv subunit vaccine. glycoprotein thought to
play important role anti-ebv immunity. however, studies role this
viral antigen cellular cytotoxicity immune functions been
hampered lack suitable model expressing gp350. describe a
study successfully transfected gp350-negative cell line resistant
to natural-killer(nk)-cell activity (i.e., raji) recombinant plasmid
(pzip-ma) containing ebv-gp350 neomycin resistance gene. three clones
with stable strong expression gp350 surface membrane, as
demonstrated using gp350-specific (i.e., 2li0) monoclonal antibody (mab) were
isolated, characterized used targets antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity (adcc) assay. however, gp350 expression 2 3 isolated
clones recognized anti-gp350 mab (72ai) specific a
unique gp350 epitope dual function (i.e., involved ebv binding 
its target cell receptors inducing virus-neutralizing antibody). have
also found gp350 expression 3 selected clones affect
ebv-receptor (cr2) density. model gp350-expressing,
nk-cell-activity-resistant targets revealed useful determining gp350
serves target antigen ebv-specific adcc. gp350-expressing cell
clones appear represent valuable tool diagnostic purposes (i.e., for
detecting titrating gp350 antibodies patients ebv-associated
diseases). approach also prove useful studying expression of
other cell-surface-associated viral tumor antigens role specific
cellular immunity immunosurveillance.
