ricin plant derived protein toxin produced castor bean plant (ricinus
communis). centers disease control (cdc) classifies ricin category b
biological agent. currently, neither effective vaccine be
used protect ricin exposure therapeutic reverse effects
once exposed. quantitatively characterize interactions catalytic 
ricin a-chain (rta) viral genome-linked protein (vpg) turnip mosaic
virus (tumv). vpg n-terminal truncated variant, vpg1-110, bind rta and
abolish ricin's catalytic depurination 28s rrna vitro cell-free
rabbit reticulocyte translational system. rta vpg bind 1 1
stoichiometric ratio, binding affinity increases ten-fold as
temperature elevates (5 °c 37 °c). rta-vpg binary complex formation is
enthalpically driven favored entropy, resulting overall favorable
energy, δg = -136.8 kj/mol. molecular modeling supports experimental
observations predicts major contribution electrostatic interactions,
suggesting allosteric mechanism downregulation rta activity through
conformational changes rta structure, and/or disruption binding the
ribosomal stalk. fluorescence anisotropy studies show heat affects rate 
constant activation energy rta-vpg complex, ea = -62.1 kj/mol.
the thermodynamic kinetic findings presented initial lead study
with promising results provides rational approach synthesis of
therapeutic peptides successfully eliminate toxicity ricin, other
cytotoxic rips.
