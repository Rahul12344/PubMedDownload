h9n2 influenza viruses circulating china since 1994, a
systematic investigation h9n2 shanghai previously undertaken. 
here, using 14 viruses isolated poultry pigs shanghai 2002 
and 2006-2014, together commercial vaccine a/chicken/shanghai/f/1998
(ck/sh/f/98), analyzed evolution h9n2 influenza viruses shanghai and
showed 14 isolates originated ck/sh/f/98 antigenically. we
evaluated immune protection efficiency vaccine. findings
demonstrate h9n2 viruses shanghai undergone extensive reassortment. 
various genotypes emerged 2002, 2006 2007, 2009-2014 one
genotype found. four antigenic groups, a-d, could identified among 14 
isolates variety antigenically distinct h9n2-virus-derived avian
influenza viruses (aivs) circulated simultaneously shanghai this
period. challenge experiments using vaccinated chickens indicated the
vaccine prevented shedding antigenic group b viruses, of
the recent groups c d. genetic analysis showed compared the
vaccine strain, representative viruses antigenic groups c possess
greater numbers amino acid substitutions hemagglutinin (ha) protein
than viruses antigenic groups b. many substitutions located
in antigenic sites. results indicate persistence h9n2 aiv in
china might due incomplete vaccine protection avian influenza 
vaccine regularly evaluated updated maintain optimal protection.
