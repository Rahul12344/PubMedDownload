carrageenan polysaccharide reported able inhibit infection 
and replication many different kinds viruses. here, demonstrated 
2 kda κ-carrageenan oligosaccharide (co-1) derived carrageenan
polysaccharide, effectively inhibited influenza (h1n1) virus replication in
mdck cells (selectivity index >25.0). moreover, 2 kda co-1 inhibited
influenza virus (iav) replication better 3 kda 5 kda
κ-carrageenan oligosaccharides (co-2 co-3). iav multiplication suppressed
by carrageenan oligosaccharide treatment dose-dependent manner. carrageenan 
oligosaccharide co-1 bind cell surface mdck cells but
inactivated virus particles pretreatment. different actions of
carrageenan polysaccharide, co-1 could enter mdck cells not
interfere iav adsorption. co-1 also inhibited iav mrna protein
expression internalization cells. moreover, carrageenan
oligosaccharide co-1 antiviral effect iav replication subsequent to
viral internalization prior virus release one replication cycle.
therefore, inhibition iav intracellular replication carrageenan
oligosaccharide might alternative approach anti-influenza virus
therapy.
