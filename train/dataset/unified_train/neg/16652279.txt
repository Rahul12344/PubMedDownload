to differentiate effects antiretroviral drugs the
endothelium secondary effects immune function, viral
load, dyslipidemia, 6 non-human immunodeficiency virus-infected human
subjects treated lopinavir-ritonavir 1 month and, basis of
forearm blood flow, treatment's effects endothelial cell function were
measured. surprisingly, exposure lopinavir-ritonavir, absolute forearm
blood-flow responses endothelium-dependent vasodilator, acetylcholine,
increased significantly (p=.03), forearm blood flow decreased greater
extent specific inhibition synthase n(g)-monomethyl-l-arginine.
thus, small cohort subjects, short-term treatment with
lopinavir-ritonavir appear directly promote endothelial cell
dysfunction.
