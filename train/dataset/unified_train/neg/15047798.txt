human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) causes adult t-cell leukemia (atl).
although viral transactivation factor, tax, known apparent
transforming ability, exact function tax atl development still not
clear. understand role tax atl development, introduced
short-interfering rnas (sirnas) tax rat htlv-1-infected t-cell line.
our results demonstrated expression sirna targeting tax successfully
downregulated tax expression. repression tax expression associated with
resistance htlv-1-infected cells tax-specific cytotoxic-t-lymphocyte 
killing. may due direct effect decreased tax expression,
because tax sirna alter expression mhc-i, cd80, cd86.
furthermore, cells tax downregulation appeared lose ability to
develop tumors t-cell-deficient nude rats, parental
htlv-1-infected cells induce atl-like lymphoproliferative disease. results 
indicated importance tax activating host immune response 
the virus maintaining growth ability infected cells vivo. our
results provide insights mechanisms host immune system can
survey inhibit growth htlv-1-infected cells long latent
period onset atl.
