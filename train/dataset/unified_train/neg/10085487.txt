background: direct association human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) infection
and development restenosis coronary angioplasty suggested. 
the aim prospective study evaluate value hcmv serology in
predicting clinical outcome percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty (ptca).
methods results: 112 patients undergoing elective ptca included the
study. hcmv antibody levels measured elisa. cardiac events within a
follow-up period 6 months ptca defined (1) progression or
recurrence anginal complaints and/or positive exercise test; (2) restenosis 
that required repeat revascularization. 73% ptca patients seropositive
for hcmv. successful ptca achieved total 94 patients, were
followed 6 months. 31/94 patients (33%) cardiac events occurred in
15/94 (16%), could related restenosis. found statistically
significant difference seropositive negative patients respect to
anginal complaints need revascularization. evidence of
acute reactivation, since titers anti-hcmv antibodies increase after
ptca.
conclusion: study shows clinical outcome ptca related 
to hcmv serostatus patient. therefore, data support the
hypothesis serological markers hcmv infection clinical importance 
for assessment patient's individual risk ptca. not
preclude role local reactivation hcmv site angioplasty.
