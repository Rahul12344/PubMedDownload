infections influenza c virus causing respiratory symptoms common,
particularly among children. since isolation detection virus are
rarely performed, compared influenza b viruses, small number of
available sequences virus makes difficult analyze evolutionary
dynamics. recently, reported full genome sequence 102 strains the
virus. here, exploited data elucidate evolutionary characteristics 
and phylodynamics virus compared influenza b viruses. along
with data, obtained public sequence data hemagglutinin-esterase
gene virus; dataset consists 218 unique sequences virus
collected 14 countries 1947 2014. informatics analyses revealed 
that (1) multiple lineages circulating globally; (2) been
weak infrequent selective bottlenecks; (3) evolutionary rate low
because weak positive selection low capability induce mutations; 
(4) significant positive selection although mutations affecting
its antigenicity induced. unique evolutionary dynamics the
influenza c virus must shaped multiple factors, including virological,
immunological, epidemiological characteristics.
