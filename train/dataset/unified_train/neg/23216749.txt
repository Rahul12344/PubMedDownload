background: small rnas (srna) regulatory class rna mainly
represented 21 24-nucleotide size classes. cellular srnas are
processed rnase iii family enzyme dicer (dicer like plant) a
self-complementary hairpin loop type rna duplexes. papaya genome 
has sequenced, micrornas regulatory rnas yet be
analyzed.
results: analyzed genomic features papaya srna population from
three srna deep sequencing libraries made leaves, flowers, leaves
infected papaya ringspot virus (prsv). also used deep sequencing data
to annotate micro rna (mirna) papaya. identified 60 mirnas, 24 which
were conserved species, 36 novel mirnas specific to
papaya. contrast chargaff's purine-pyrimidine equilibrium, cellular
srna significantly biased towards purine rich population. two purine
bases, higher frequency adenine present 23nt longer srnas, while
22nt shorter srnas represented guanine bases. however, bias 
was observed annotated mirnas plants. 21nt species were
expressed fewer loci expressed higher levels relative 24nt
species. highly expressed 21nt species clustered isolated
locations genome. prsv infected leaves showed higher accumulation of
21 22nt srna compared uninfected leaves. observed higher accumulation
of mirna* seven annotated mirnas virus-infected tissue, indicating the
potential function mirna* stressed conditions.
conclusions: identified 60 mirnas papaya. study revealed the
asymmetric purine-pyrimidine distribution cellular srna population. 21nt
species srnas higher expression levels 24nt srna. mirna* some
mirnas shows higher accumulation prsv infected tissues, suggesting 
strands totally functionally redundant. findings open new avenue
for investigation srna silencing pathway plants.
