human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) primarily infects destroys
cd4-positive lymphocytes, leading acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(aids). 20 drugs, small orally bioavailable, approved,
and include reverse transcriptase protease inhibitors. 2003, us-fda
approved enfuvirtide (t-20), 36-amino acid peptide derived c-terminal 
heptad repeat hiv-1 gp41 ectodomain. t-20 initially identified 1992
from biological studies, effectively suppress hiv-1 infection with
multi-drug resistance. currently, numerous fusion inhibitory peptides been
designed synthesized. peptides show strong inhibition even
towards hiv-1 strains resistant t-20. developments also facilitate basic
research mechanisms hiv-1 fusion, peptide inhibition
resembles process viral fusion cellular membrane. review,
we focus hiv-1 fusion inhibitors application development 
clinical findings concept "biology chemistry" support rational
drug design small bioavailable compounds.
