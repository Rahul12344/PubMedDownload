catalytic oligonucleotides, known dnazymes, new class nucleic
acid-based gene therapy recently used preclinical animal
studies treat various cancers. study systemic distribution,
pharmacokinetics, safety intravenously administered anti-mmp (matrix
metalloproteinase)-9 dnazyme (am9d) determined healthy fvb in
mmtv-polyoma virus middle (pymt) transgenic mice bearing mammary tumors. mmp-9 
is known involved tumor cell development, angiogenesis, invasion, and
metastasis. sulfur-35 ((35)s) labeled ([(35)s]-am9d) administered intravenously, 
without use carrier molecules, healthy mammary tumor bearing
mmtv-pymt transgenic mice distributed major organs. order of
percentages [(35)s]-am9d accumulation different organs healthy and
mmtv-pymt mice blood>liver>kidney>lung>spleen>heart mammary
tumor>blood≈liver>kidney>spleen>lung>heart, respectively. amount am9d
accumulated mammary tumors 2 hours post injection 0.6% 0.2% higher
than either blood liver, respectively, rate initial clearance
from mammary tissue least 50% slower organs. approximately 
43% delivered dosage [(35)s]-am9d cleared system via feces
and urine period 72 hours. evidence acute chronic
cytotoxicity, local widespread, associated am9d treatment (up 75 mg
am9d /kg body weight) observed organs examined. data suggest 
that dnazyme general am9d particular used systemically a
therapeutic agent treat patients breast cancer metastatic and
surgically inaccessible tumors.
