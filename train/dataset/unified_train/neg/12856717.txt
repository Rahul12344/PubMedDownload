a number studies emphasized role pai-1 important regulator
of tumor cell invasion metastasis. hallmark primary tumors the
central nervous system glioblastomas particular diffuse invasion
into normal brain tissue. since pai-1 expressed tumors, studied
the effect adenoviral-mediated transfer pai-1 gene regulating in
vitro invasiveness d54mg glioma cells matrigel, fetal rat brain 
aggregates. treatment d54mg cells 50 moi (multiplicity infection) of
the replication defective vector adcmvpai-1 increased pai-1 expression 23-fold
compared control vectors, invasion matrigel reduced by
67%. motility cells reduced 58% compared controls
(indicating inhibition motility principal effect pai-1 in
these cells). ability d54mg tumor spheroids invade fetal rat brain
aggregates reduced pai-1 gene transfer. results show that
overexpression pai-1 inhibit glioma cell motility invasion through
extracellular matrix (ecm) components, like laminin collagen, not
inhibit tumor cell invasion three-dimensional invasion assay, simulating
normal brain tissue different ecm interstitial composition. the
different results obtained two invasion assays reflect complex
biological effects upa/pai-1 system, questions simplistic view of
pai- inhibitor brain tumor invasion.
