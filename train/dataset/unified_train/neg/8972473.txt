reports connect kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) various types
of kaposi's sarcoma (ks) body-cavity-based lymphomas (primary effusion
lymphomas). kshv dna sequences also detected non-ks malignant 
vascular tumors. determine whether kshv associated malignant vascular 
tumors involving body cavities, 11 primary vascular tumors serous
membranes (4 angiosarcomas, 7 hemangioendotheliomas) tested kshv
sequences polymerase chain reaction southern blot hybridization. the
tumors patients known immunocompromised. kshv
sequences detected penile ks control absent 11
specimens studied. results consistent previous reports kshv
sequences rarely detected non-ks vascular lesions. results also
suggested although kshv sequences might present primary effusion
tumors primary effusion lymphoma, might found tumors
related body cavities serous membranes.
