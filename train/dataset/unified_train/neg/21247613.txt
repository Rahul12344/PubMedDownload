it known time retroviruses disseminate immune 
cells either conventional cell-free transmission directed cell-to-cell
spread. past years increasing interest how
retroviruses may use cell-to-cell spread promote rapid infection kinetics
and circumvent humoral immunity. effective humoral immune responses are
intimately linked innate immunity interplay retroviruses and
innate immunity rapidly expanding area research advanced
considerably identification cellular restriction factors provide
barriers retroviral infection. effect innate immunity restriction
factors retroviral cell-to-cell spread comparatively little studied; 
however recent work suggests maybe changing. review recent 
advances budding area retroviral research.
