equid herpesvirus type 1 (ehv-1) causes outbreaks abortion neurological
disease horses. one main causes clinical syndromes is
thrombosis placental spinal cord vessels, however mechanism for
thrombus formation unknown. platelets form part thrombus amplify
and propagate thrombin generation. here, tested hypothesis ehv-1
activates platelets. found two ehv-1 strains, racl11 ab4 0.5 or
higher plaque forming unit/cell, activate platelets within 10 minutes, causing
α-granule secretion (surface p-selectin expression) platelet
microvesiculation (increased small events double positive cd41 annexin
v). microvesiculation pronounced racl11 strain. virus-induced
p-selectin expression required plasma 1.0 mm exogenous calcium. p-selectin
expression abolished microvesiculation significantly reduced in
factor vii- x-deficient human plasma. p-selectin expression and
microvesiculation re-established factor vii-deficient human plasma with
added purified human factor viia (1 nm). glycoprotein c-deficient mutant the
ab4 strain activated platelets effectively non-mutated ab4. p-selectin
expression abolished microvesiculation significantly reduced by
preincubation virus goat polyclonal anti-rabbit tissue factor antibody.
infectious virus could retrieved washed ehv-1-exposed platelets,
suggesting direct platelet-virus interaction. results indicate ehv-1
activates equine platelets α-granule secretion consequence of
virus-associated tissue factor triggering factor x activation thrombin
generation. microvesiculation partly tissue factor and
thrombin-dependent, suggesting virus causes microvesiculation other
mechanisms, potentially direct binding. findings suggest that
ehv-1-induced platelet activation could contribute thrombosis occurs 
in clinically infected horses provides new mechanism viruses
activate hemostasis.
