objectives: compare immunogenicity safety bivalent human
papillomavirus (hpv)16/18 vaccine female patients juvenile
idiopathic arthritis (jia) healthy female adolescents.
methods: 68 patients 55 healthy girls aged 12-18 years included a
prospective controlled observational cohort vaccinated 0, 1 and
6 months. primary outcomes immunogenicity expressed seropositivity rate
after three vaccine doses 7 12 months hpv-specific geometric mean
antibody concentrations. secondary outcomes hpv16/18-specific memory b cell 
responses subset participants safety, defined adverse events and
the effect vaccination jia disease activity.
results: participants seropositive hpv16 hpv18 7 months. one 
patient turned seronegative 12 months hpv16/18. significant differences
were found patients controls hpv-specific antibody concentrations;
however, antibody concentrations consistently lower patients. effect
of methotrexate hpv16 antibodies (p=0.79) hpv18 antibodies (p=0.37) was
detected. patients anti-tnfα treatment seropositive after
vaccination. kinetics hpv16/18 memory b cell responses comparable
between patients controls, magnitude b cell responses 7 and
12 months appeared lower patients. relevant differences adverse events
were found. hpv vaccination aggravate jia disease.
conclusions: bivalent hpv16/18 vaccine immunogenic well tolerated in
jia patients. however, hpv-specific antibodies b cell responses tended 
lower patients compared healthy controls.
