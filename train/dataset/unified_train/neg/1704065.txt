aurintricarboxylic acid (ata) fractionated combination dialysis,
ultrafiltration, gel permeation chromatography. number average weight
average molecular weights ata fractions determined universal
calibration method. sulfonic acid analogue ata prepared separated 
in high low molecular weight fractions. phosphonic acid analogue ata
was also synthesized. ata fractions tested prevention 
cytopathic effect hiv-1 hiv-2 mt-4 cell culture well against
hiv-1 cem cell culture. abilities fractions analogues to
inhibit syncytium formation hiv-1- hiv-2-infected hut-78 cells and
uninfected molt-4 cells evaluated. addition, fractions analogues 
were tested cytotoxicity mock-infected mt-4 cells, prevention the
binding okt4a monoclonal antibody cd4 receptor, inhibition the
binding anti-gp120 monoclonal antibody gp120, inhibition attachment of
hiv-1 virions mt-4 cells, inhibition hiv-1 reverse transcriptase. in
all assays except cytotoxicity, correlation potency 
molecular weight. higher molecular weight, higher activity.
several lower molecular weight fractions ata, bound gp120 
not cd4, prevented hiv-1 hiv-2 cytopathicity. similar profile was
observed phosphonic acid analogue ata lower molecular weight
fraction sulfonic acid analogue. results ata fractions indicate
that binding ata gp120 absence cd4 binding sufficient 
anti-hiv activity. active compounds bind avidly gp120 cd4.
the anti-hiv activity ata fractions due inhibition virus binding 
due interference gp120-cd4 interaction.
