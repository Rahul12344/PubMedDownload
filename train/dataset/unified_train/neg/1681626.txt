mhc antigens positioned centre interactions enterocytes
and lymphocytes pathogenesis coeliac disease. disease is
associated presence specific alleles mhc-class ii genes.
class-ii-gene products present also enterocytic membranes play an
important role presentation antigens might lead coeliac patients
to extraordinarily effective stimulation cd4+ and/or cd8+ cells which
induce damage intestinal epithelium various mechanisms. additionally
so-called cd4-cd8-gamma/delta + lymphocytes might act cytotoxically on
enterocytes. typical hla-haplotype, however, found also many healthy
persons. thus presence specific mhc molecules requirement 
for susceptibility gliadins. furthermore, virus infection (cross reactivity 
with gliadins?) additional factor considered sufficient
for expression coeliac disease. results presented demonstrating that
gliadins affect undifferentiated enterocytes arguing role additional
enterocytic factors pathogenesis disorder. findings suggest
that gliadins interfere late post-translational processes the
biosynthesis sucrase-isomaltase. integration effect the
pathogenetic mechanism coeliac disease remains clarified.
