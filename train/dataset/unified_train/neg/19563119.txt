recent advances optical imaging molecular manipulation techniques have
made possible observe activity individual enzymes study the
dynamic properties processes challenging elucidate using
ensemble-averaging techniques. use single-molecule approaches proven
to particularly successful study dynamic interactions between
the components replication fork. section, describe methods 
necessary vitro single-molecule studies ofprokaryotic replication systems.
through experiments, accurate information obtained rates 
processivities dna unwinding polymerization. ability monitor in
real time progress single replication fork allows detection of
short-lived, intermediate states would difficult visualize in
bulk-phase assays.
