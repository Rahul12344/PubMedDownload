the peritrophic matrix (pm) extracellular, semi-permeable biocomposite that
lines midgut insects. pm serves first defense the
midgut resist microorganisms viruses, bacteria pathogens,
and protect epithelial cells mechanical damage. pm also separates the
midgut lumen different compartments, play important roles nutrient 
ingestion digestion. pm highly dynamic structure consists
mainly chitin fibers cross-linked proteins, glycoproteins, and
proteoglycans. pm continuously biosynthesized, assembled, degraded 
response feeding development. chitin chains synthesized several
enzymes organized several hierarchical levels, various
pm-associated proteins appear essential maintaining structural
integrity physiological function pm. review summarizes research
advances molecular components pm functions, well as
related proteins enzymes contribute pm formation modification.
crucial gaps current understanding pm also addressed.
