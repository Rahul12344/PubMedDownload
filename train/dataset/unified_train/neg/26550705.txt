crimean-congo haemorrhagic fever (cchf)Â is highly contagious tick-borne disease
that impacts many countries parts africa, europe, asia, middle
east. outbreaks episodic, deadly. due highly contagious nature 
this disease, suspected cases taken extremely serious, strong
control measures implemented almost immediately. primarily living 
farms, livestock workers, medical workers risk. virus
responsible cchf transmitted asymptomatically transiently to
livestock, symptomatically humans. fatality rate human cases be
very high. number methods directions viral transmission large,
including tick-to-tick, tick-to-livestock, tick-to-human, livestock-to-tick,
livestock-to-human, human-to-human. model cchf using deterministic
system nonlinear differential equations. compartment model allows us to
analyse threshold parameters equilibria describing magnitude and
progression cases disease hypothetical outbreak.
