upon sequencing spv4 genome, eight putative open reading frames (orfs)
including 65-kilodalton (kda) capsid protein detected. they
involve three reading frames. three promoter sequences found, well as
a transcription terminator initiation site complementary strand
synthesis. ribosome binding sites regulatory sequences closely related to
those eubacteria. codon usage analysis showed terminated codons
are preferably used. uaa major termination codon. upon cloning the
full-size spv4 replicative form, capsid protein gene could expressed
in escherichia coli, whereas spiralin gene cloned bacterium is
expressed. results suggest spiroplasmas, mycoplasma
capricolum, uga termination codon, probably codes for
tryptophan. spiralin contains tryptophan. hence, gene contains uga
codons thus expressed e. coli. hand, gene for
capsid protein nine uga codons cannot fully expressed the
bacterium. results fully support bacterial origin spiroplasmas.
