implications viral architecture.

the orientation location 240 hexons comprising outer protein shell
of adenovirus determined. electron micrographs capsid its
fragments inspected features hexon known x-ray
crystallographic model described accompanying paper. capsid model 
proposed facet comprising small p3 net 12 hexons, arranged a
triangular sextet three outer hexon pairs. sextet centrally placed
about icosahedral threefold axis, edges parallel the
facet. outer pairs project facet edges one side the
icosahedral twofold axes edge. model capsid defined the
underlying icosahedron, edge 445 a, upon hexons arranged. hexons
are thus bounded icosahedra insphere radii 336 452 a. quartet 
of hexons forms asymmetric unit icosahedral hexon shell, be
closed addition pentons 12 vertices. considering hexon
trimer complex structure unit, interactions four topologically
distinct environments similar, conservation least two-thirds 
of inter-hexon bonding. crystal-like construction explains flat
facets sharp edges characteristic adenovirus. larger "adenovirus-like"
capsids size could formed using one additional topologically
different environment. construction adenovirus illustrates an
impenetrable protein shell formed, highly conserved intermolecular
bonding, using geometry oligomeric structure unit symmetry
additional icosahedral point group. contrasts manner
suggested caspar & klug (1962), polypeptide structure
unit, number possible bonding configurations required a
structure unit tends infinity continuously curved capsid increases in

evidence presented existence larger subunits polypeptide

exact icosahedral symmetry relates structure units sub-assemblies, would
themselves formed self-limiting closed interactions. without such
symmetry, presence scaffolding proteins nucleic acid necessary to
limit aggregation.
