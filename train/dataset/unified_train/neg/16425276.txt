patients adult t-cell leukemia/lymphoma (atll) severely
immunocompromised state. therefore, assumed atll cells either express 
particular cytokines induce expression host immune cells, disrupting 
the balanced production cytokines causing host's immune system to
break down. examined levels serum cytokines including helper type 1- 
(th1-) associated cytokines [ifn-gamma, tnf-alpha, interleukin (il)-2],
th2-associated cytokines (il-4, -5 -6) regulatory cell-associated
cytokines (il-10 tgf-beta1) 94 atll patients, 39 asymptomatic human t-cell
lymphotropic virus type-1 (htlv-1) carriers 50 healthy adult volunteers, to
clarify whether elevated levels particular cytokines associated the
prognosis atll patients. multivariate analysis, high il-5 il-10 levels 
were independent significant unfavorable prognostic factors among atll
patients. il-10 level significantly increased disease progression at
each step asymptomatic htlv-1 carrier atll indolent variant
(chronic smoldering subtypes) atll aggressive variant (acute and
lymphoma subtypes). furthermore, high il-10 significantly associated with
high lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), indicating il-10 level reflects the
tumor burden. il-5 level associated disease progression ldh.
among atll patients aggressive variant, high il-5, high il-10,
was independent significant unfavorable prognostic factor multivariate 
analysis. measurement serum il-5 il-10 levels useful predicting the
prognosis determining suitable treatment strategy atll patients.
