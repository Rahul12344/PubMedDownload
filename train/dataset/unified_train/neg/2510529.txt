ribavirin evaluated potential therapeutic crimean-congo hemorrhagic 
fever (cchf). viral yields strains cchf virus europe, asia, and
africa african green monkey kidney (vero) cells markedly reduced 
drug. cchf viral strains appeared sensitive others, in
general, ribavirin doses low 5 micrograms/ml caused transient reduction
of viral yields. reduction viral yields induced dose 25 
micrograms/ml, evidence viral replication demonstrated cells
treated 50 250 micrograms/ml. contrast, dose ribavirin least 9
times greater required induce comparable inhibitory effect yields
of rift valley fever virus, drug shown inhibit
replication monkeys rodents.
