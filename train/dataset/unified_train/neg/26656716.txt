human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hpiv3) belongs paramyxoviridae family.
its three internal viral proteins, nucleoprotein (n), phosphoprotein (p),
and polymerase (l), form ribonucleoprotein (rnp) complex, which
encapsidates viral genome associates matrix protein (m) for
virion assembly. previously showed protein expressed alone is
sufficient assemble release virus-like particles (vlps) mutant 
the l305a point mutation protein (ml305a) vlp formation ability
similar wild-type protein. addition, recombinant hpiv3 (rhpiv3)
containing ml305a mutation (rhpiv3-ml305a) could successfully recovered.
in present study, found titer rhpiv3-ml305a least
10-fold lower titer rhpiv3. using vlp incorporation and
coimmunoprecipitation assays, found vlps expressing protein
(m-vlps) efficiently incorporate n p via n-m p-m interaction and
ml305a-vlps ability incorporate p via p-m interaction similar that
of m-vlps unable incorporate n longer interacted n.
furthermore, found incorporation p ml305a-vlps m-vlps
was inhibited presence n. addition, provide evidence the
c-terminal region p involved interaction n n
binding c-terminal region p inhibits incorporation p into
ml305a-vlps. findings provide new molecular details support idea 
the n-m interaction p-m interaction critical packaging n p
into infectious viral particles.importance: human parainfluenza virus type 3
(hpiv3) nonsegmented, negative-sense, single-stranded rna virus belongs
to paramyxoviridae family cause lower respiratory tract infections in
infants young children well elderly immunocompromised individuals.
however, effective vaccine developed licensed. used virus-like 
particle (vlp) incorporation coimmunoprecipitation assays determine how
the protein assembles internal viral proteins. demonstrate both
nucleoprotein (n) phosphoprotein (p) incorporate m-vlps n
inhibits m-p interaction via binding n c terminus p. also
provide additional evidence n-m interaction p-m interaction 
is critical regulation hpiv3 assembly. studies provide more
complete characterization hpiv3 virion assembly substantiation n
interaction regulates internal viral organization.
