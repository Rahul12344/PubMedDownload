in underdeveloped countries, initial contact epstein barr virus
(ebv) usually happens first decade life results asymptomatic 
infection, whereas developed areas, primary infection adolescence or
adulthood accompanied infectious mononucleosis 50% cases. although is
generally harmless passenger, individuals, associated b-cell
lymphoma. argentina, ebv primary infection shows classical pattern
observed developing populations, given nearly 70% patients are
seropositive age 2 years. however, ebv association pediatric
hodgkin burkitt lymphoma resembles observed developed regions.
concerning diffuse large b-cell lymphoma, series demonstrated higher ebv
association adult ones either developed underdeveloped
countries. interestingly, early ebv primary infection observed,
characteristic underdeveloped population, together statistically
significant ebv association patients ≤ 10 years old demonstrated all
types lymphoma studied, suggest relationship low age ebv
seroconversion b-cell lymphoma development risk.
