several groups reported results clinical trials gene augmentation 
therapy leber congenital amaurosis (lca) mutations rpe65
gene. studies used subretinal injection adeno-associated virus
(aav) vectors deliver human rpe65 cdna retinal pigment epithelial
(rpe) cells treated eyes. studies reported date, this
approach shown safe effective. successful clinical
trials gene augmentation therapy retinal degeneration caused mutations 
in rpe65 gene sets stage broad application gene therapy treat
retinal degenerative disorders.
