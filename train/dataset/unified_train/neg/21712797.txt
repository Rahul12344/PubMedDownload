to understand relationship mitochondrial transport neuronal
function, critical observe mitochondrial behavior live cultured
neurons extended durations(1-3). possible use of
vital dyes fluorescent proteins cytoskeletal components,
organelles, structures living cells labeled then
visualized via dynamic fluorescence microscopy. example, embryonic chicken
sympathetic neurons, mitochondrial movement characterized using vital dye
rhodamine 123(4). another study, mitochondria visualized rat forebrain
neurons transfection mitochondrially targeted eyfp(5). however, imaging 
primary neurons minutes, hours, even days presents number issues.
foremost among are: 1) maintenance culture conditions as
temperature, humidity, ph long imaging sessions; 2) strong, stable
fluorescent signal assure quality acquired images accurate
measurement signal intensity image analysis; 3) limiting exposure
times image acquisition minimize photobleaching avoid
phototoxicity. here, describe protocol permits observation,
visualization, analysis mitochondrial movement cultured hippocampal
neurons high temporal resolution optimal life support conditions. 
we constructed affordable stage-top incubator provides good
temperature regulation atmospheric gas flow, also limits degree of
media evaporation, assuring stable ph osmolarity. incubator is
connected, via inlet outlet hoses, standard tissue culture incubator,
which provides constant humidity levels atmosphere 5-10% co(2;)/air.
this design offers cost-effective alternative significantly expensive
microscope incubators necessarily assure viability cells over
many hours even days. visualize mitochondria, infect cells a
lentivirus encoding red fluorescent protein targeted the
mitochondrion. assures strong persistent signal, which, conjunction
with use stable xenon light source, allows us limit exposure times
during image acquisition precludes photobleaching phototoxicity. 
two injection ports top stage-top incubator allow acute
administration neurotransmitters reagents intended modulate
mitochondrial movement. sum, lentivirus-mediated expression an
organelle-targeted red fluorescent protein combination stage-top
incubator, conventional inverted fluorescence microscope, ccd camera, xenon
light source allow us acquire time-lapse images mitochondrial transport 
living neurons longer durations possible studies deploying
conventional vital dyes off-the-shelf life support systems.
