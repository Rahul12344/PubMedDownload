although influence chicken classical mhc resistance many
diseases well established, role recently identified, genetically
independent, mhc-like region known rfp-y unclear. objectives this
study analyze frequencies dna polymorphisms rfp-y region in
white leghorn lines, divergently selected replicate multitrait 
immunocompetence, determine association polymorphisms with
marek's disease (md) resistance. chicks, either without herpes virus of
turkey (hvt) vaccination, challenged 500 ffu virulent marek's
disease virus (md5) 2 age. md-related data collected 10 wk. 
pvuii-digested genomic dna hybridized rfp-y region-specific probe,
18.1. three rfp-y polymorphisms observed. frequency one rfp-y
polymorphism significantly different divergently selected multitrait 
immunocompetence lines one replicate only; therefore, impact multitrait
immunocompetence selection rfp-y polymorphisms inconclusive. pvuii
defined rfp-y region polymorphisms association either innate or
vaccine-induced md resistance md5 virus challenge.
