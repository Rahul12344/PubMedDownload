pneumocystis pneumonia (pcp) potentially life-threatening fungal infection
usually seen immunocompromised patients. pneumocystis jirovecii easily 
detected oral rinse samples hiv patients suspected pcp. this
study, quantitative real-time pcr assay used establish frequency 
detection p. jirovecii oral rinses hiv patients without respiratory
symptoms suspicion pcp. two saline oral rinses collected 100
ambulant hiv patients 60 copd patients (comparator group). four hiv
patients positive p. jirovecii. three patients, first sample 
positive one second one positive. one patients pcp
prophylaxis cd4+ count 76 cells/mm3. mean cd4+ count all
patients 527 cells/mm3. qrt-pcr test results copd patients were
negative. patient developed pcp six months follow-up. qrt-pcr assay can
be used detect p. jirovecii dna oral rinse samples hiv patients
without evident clinical symptoms, however oral carriage fungus was
rare cohort patients. conclusion, although rare, positive oral
rinse p. jirovecii result may reflect colonisation, particular patients
with hiv. needs kept mind using oral rinses qrt-pcr the
diagnosis p. jirovecii infection.
