based literature data experiences author gives outlook about
pathogenicity avian mycoplasmas. chickens turkeys m. gallisepticum 
m. synoviae (in addition m. meleagridis exclusively turkeys) the
most important mycoplasmas producing respiratory disease, inflamation synovial
membranes lesions. pathogenic effect much influenced by
dose agent, route entry microorganism, age birds, virulence and
tropism organism well associated mycoplasma virus bacterial 
or fungal infections conditions environment. facts rise difficulties
in serological diagnostic erradication program. recently ureaplasma infection
was also established chickens turkeys also associated with
respiratory disease. ducks a. laidlawii, m. anatis various unclassified 
strains isolated, among m. anatis unclassified arginine splitting 
mycoplasma strains proved pathogenic. geese m. gallinarum, a. laidlawii 
and a. axanthum detected. a. axanthum showed pathogenicity goslings 
goose embryos. effect exacerbated associated parvovirus infection.
