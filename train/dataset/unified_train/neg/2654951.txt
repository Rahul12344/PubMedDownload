transplantation el-4 lymphoma syngeneic recipients caused significant
endocrine changes occurred early well late after
transplantation. among hormonal changes induced biphasic increase in
the level serum corticosterone, biphasic decrease serum insulin levels,
an early decrease prolactin terminal severe deficiency thyroxine. the
mechanism corticosterone levels increased immediately following
tumor transplantation appears involve post-thymic cells. addition, the
corticosterone response tumor transplantation seems restricted to
syngeneic recipients seem occur allogeneic tumor
transplantation. further, phenomenon may require immunogenic tumor since
the relatively nonimmunogenic mammary tumor virus (mtv) induced adenocarcinoma
did increase corticosterone syngeneic c3h/he mice. data are
consistent proposition recognition tumor antigen mature t
cells occurs within hours tumor transplantation. recognition appears to
be mhc restricted. whereas mitogen stimulation cells produces a
glucocorticoid increasing factor designated gif (besedovsky et al., 1985b), is
reasonable suggest gif produced vivo part cell response
to tumor antigen. gif turn stimulates hypophyseal release acth a
subsequent release corticosterone adrenal gland. biological
relevance physiological increase serum levels corticosterone was
examined respect anti-inflammatory phenomenon often observed after
tumor transplantation. first, concordance noted following tumor
transplantation elevated corticosterone levels anti-inflammation.
similarly, transplantation mtv induced mammary adenocarcinoma failed
to increase serum levels corticosterone exhibit anti-inflammation.
consistent concept corticosterone levels increase following cell 
recognition tumor antigens, known anti-inflammation occur 
with weakly immunogenic tumors follow transplantation moderately
immunogenic tumors (normann, 1985b; normann et al., 1985a). second, adrenalectomy
prevented corticosterone response tumor transplantation eliminated
tumor associated anti-inflammation. additional studies necessary determine
if increase serum levels corticosterone alters parameters 
host response tumors. anti-inflammation shown occur following tumor
transplantation via corticosterone dependent pathway.(abstract truncated 400
