alpha-l-iduronidase activity determined established lymphoblastoid cells, 
which transformed vitro epstein-barr virus, lymphocytes-rich cell
populations isolated peripheral blood patients hurler scheie
syndromes. alpha-l-iduronidase activities established lymphoblastoid cells
from patients undetectable, activities control subjects were
clearly detected. results suggest established lymphoblastoid cells are
useful enzymatic study genetic mucopolysaccharidoses.
