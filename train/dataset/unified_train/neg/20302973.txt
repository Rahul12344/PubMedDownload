the 3a region foot-and-mouth disease virus implicated host range
and virulence. example, amino acid deletions porcinophilic strain
(o/taw/97) 93-102aa 153 codons long 3a protein recognized 
the determinant species specificity. present study, 18 type fmdv
isolates india adapted different cell culture systems 3a
sequence analyzed. isolates complete 3a coding sequence (153aa) and
did exhibit growth restriction cells based species origin. 3a
region found highly conserved n-terminal half (1-75aa) exhibited
variability substitutions towards c-terminal region (80-153). moreover the
amino acid substitutions frequent recent indian buffalo isolates but
none indian isolates showed deletion 3a protein, may the
reason absence host specificity vitro. inclusive analysis
of 3a region reveal interesting facts variability fmd virus 3a 
region endemic environment.
