dissecting mechanisms cell-mediated immunity requires identification
of functional characteristics surface markers distinguish between
activated memory lymphocytes. study, compared rates of
cytokine production virus-specific primary memory cd8+ cells directly ex
vivo. ag-specific ifn-gamma tnf-alpha production primary and
long-term memory cells observed </=60 min peptide stimulation.
although on-rate kinetics cytokine production nearly identical,
activated cells produced ifn-gamma, less tnf-alpha, memory t
cells. ag-specific cytokine synthesis constitutive process and
terminated immediately following disruption contact peptide-coated cells,
demonstrating continuous antigenic stimulation required cell
populations maintain steady-state cytokine production. upon re-exposure ag,
activated cells resumed cytokine production whereas subpopulation of
memory cells reinitiated cytokine synthesis. analysis cytokine profiles 
levels cd8, lfa-1, ctla-4 together revealed pattern expression that
clearly distinguished vivo-activated cells memory cells.
surprisingly, ctla-4 expression highest early stages immune
response fell background levels soon viral clearance. study 
the first show memory cells ag-specific on/off regulation
of cytokine production activated cells demonstrates memory cells 
can clearly discriminated activated cells directly ex vivo their
cytokine profiles differential expression three well-characterized t
cell markers.
