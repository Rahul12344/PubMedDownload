eleven german laboratories one swiss laboratory initiated quality
assessment study evaluate specificity sensitivity polymerase 
chain reaction (pcr) detection hiv-1 dna. following pcr protocols,
each laboratory tested panel ten coded samples consisting cell pellets
containing 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 10(2), 10(3) 10(4) ach-2 cells per 1.5 x 10(5)
uninfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells. twelve participating
laboratories, three reported correct results dilution series well as
for uninfected specimens. one classification errors recorded 12%
of samples diagnosis expected positive negative.
samples containing 10 copies target template correctly reported by
eleven twelve participants. average sensitivity 97%. results
of study revealed significant differences amplicor kit and
in-house procedures. classification errors occurred specimens from
hiv-negative samples. 36 negative samples, 5 reported false positive,
showing contamination remains problem laboratories, regardless of
the pcr test performed. careful laboratory techniques internal well as
external quality control procedures help avoiding carryover contamination.
