of total 17 monoclonal antibodies (mab) directed structural proteins
of lymphocytic choriomeningitis (lcm) virus, 3 specific viral
nucleoprotein (p63) attached plasma membrane infected cells, as
disclosed indirect immunofluorescence procedure complement-mediated
cytolysis. previously demonstrated portion nucleoprotein
(p63e) part envelope intact virion (m. bruns, w. zeller, h.
rohdewohld, f. lehmann-grube (1986) virology 151, 77-85), show
that external iodination virions followed limited proteolysis the
label attached smallest peptide thus obtained. purified
nucleocapsids labeled 125i, digested before, incubated an
anti-p63 mab ability bind surface infected cell, a
similarly small peptide precipitated; antibody specific p63 not
recognizing cell surface precipitated largest peptide failed to
bring small one. conclude epitopes complementary of
our anti-p63 mab represented virion surface of
virus-infected cells.
