the discovery xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (xmrv) human
tissue samples shown due virus contamination recombinant
murine retrovirus. however, due unknown pathogenicity novel
retrovirus broad host range, including human cell lines, important 
to understand modes virus transmission develop mitigation and
management strategies reduce risk human exposure infection. xmrv
transmission evaluated whole-blood transfusion rhesus macaques. monkeys
were infected xmrv serve donor monkeys blood transfers weeks 1,
2, 3 naïve animals. donor recipient monkeys evaluated for
xmrv infection nested pcr assays nucleotide sequence confirmation,
western blot assays development virus-specific antibodies, coculture
of monkey peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) sensitive target cell
line virus isolation. xmrv infection demonstrated virus-injected
donor monkeys, evidence virus transmission whole-blood
transfusion naïve monkeys based upon pcr analysis pbmcs using xmrv-specific
gag env primers, western blot analysis monkey plasma 31 32 weeks 
after transfusion, coculture studies using monkey pbmcs various times
after transfusion. study demonstrates lack xmrv transmission by
whole-blood transfusion acute phase infection. furthermore,
analysis pbmc viral dna showed extensive apobec-mediated g-to-a hypermutation 
in donor animal week 9, corroborating previous results using macaques and
supporting possible restriction xmrv replication humans similar
mechanism.
