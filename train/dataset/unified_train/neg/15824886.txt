an adult mouse model studies latency recurrence vaginal hsv-2
infection available present, largely infection kills most
mice within 14 days. describe antiviral therapy rescues most
vaginally infected mice death. vaginally infected mice nearly all
rescued combined treatment one dose monoclonal anti-hsv glycoprotein d
3 days infection plus valacyclovir drinking water days 3, 4, 5,
7, 9, 11, 13, 15 infection. 60 days infection, pcr
measurements revealed rescued mice viral dna lumbosacral
dorsal root ganglia, lumbosacral spinal cords, paracervical autonomic
ganglia, consistent possibility latent infections established.
at time, immunolabeling revealed cd45+ lymphoid cells neural
tissues rescued mice normal control mice. vivo depletion t
lymphocytes monoclonal antibodies caused recurrence herpes illness
symptoms earlier larger proportion rescued mice observed 
non-depleted rescued mice. interestingly, many rescued mice (46/114)
spontaneously developed syndrome typical herpes illness symptoms began 
with ruffled fur mouse previously sleek fur progressed to
arched backs, feeble gait, hindlimb paralysis, death euthanasia, in
some cases recovery health. high incidence apparent spontaneous
recurrence hsv-2 infection rescued mice suggests may possible,
with refinement procedure, obtain effective adult mouse model
for studies therapeutic vaccination inhibit prevent hsv-2 recurrence
after genital tract infection.
