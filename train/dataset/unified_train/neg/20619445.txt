objective: prognostic value dysplastic lesions uterine cervix
cannot adequately determined pap cytology alone. detection hpv dna
increases diagnostic sensitivity. however, due high prevalence of
transient hpv infections, hpv dna testing suffers poor diagnostic
specificity. biomarkers highlight shift self limited transient to
potentially dangerous transforming hpv infections may improve accuracy of
cervical cancer screening. evaluated hpv e6/e7 mrna detection (aptima),
p16(ink4a)-immunocytology (cintec), hpv dna testing (hc2) identify women
with high grade cervical neoplasia disease-enriched cross-sectional cohort.
methods: liquid based cytology specimens collected 275 patients. all
assays performed vials. detection rates test were
evaluated conventional h&e based histopathology alone stratified by
p16(ink4a)-immunohistochemistry (ihc).
results: assays yielded high sensitivity detection cin3+ (96.4% 
(95% ci, 90.4-98.8) hc2, 95.5% (89.2-98.3) aptima cintec) cin2+
(91.5% (85.8-95.1) hc2, 88.4% (82.3-92.7) aptima, 86.6% (80.2-91.2) for
cintec). specificity detect high grade dysplasia highest cintec
p16(ink4a)-cytology (60.6% (52.7-68.0) cin3+ 74.8% (65.5-82.3) cin2+), 
followed aptima (56.4% (48.4-64.0) cin3+ 71.2% (61.7-79.2) cin2+)
and hc2 (49.1% (41.3-56.9) cin3+ 63.4% (53.7-72.1) cin2+). tests
had higher sensitivity using p16(ink4a)-ihc-positive cin2+ lesions endpoint.
conclusions: biomarkers detect hpv induced dysplastic changes the
transforming stage promising tools overcome current limitations of
cervical cancer screening.
