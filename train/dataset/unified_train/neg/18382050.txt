objective: construct genomic library raji cells screen ebv
dna probe.
methods: high molecular weight genomic dna raji cells digested by
restriction enzyme bamhi. dna fragments ranging 9 23 kb recovered by
agarose gel electrophoresis, ligated lambda dash ii vector bamhi 
arms pre-treated calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (ciap). ligated dna was
packed vitro using gigapack iii gold packaging extract. library plated
on xl1-blue mra (p2) host strain.titering screening raji genomic
library performed.
results: primary titer raji genomic library 1.8 x 10(5) pfu/ml,
while amplified library 2.8 x 10(8) pfu/ml. plaques (1 x 10(5))
were screened (32)p-labeled ebv dna probe(ebv genome 5-3271), 4 positive
clones obtained, 1 4 positive clones picked randomly 
the second round plaque screening. phage plaques positive. dna of
the positive clone extracted digested bamhi. length the
inserted fragment 8.5 kb. sequencing blast analysis revealed the
inserted fragments consisted bamhi-w fragment one end clone
rp11-665a22 chromosome 15 end.
conclusion: successfully established genomic library raji cells will
provide basis cloning sequences ebv junction sites and
interpreting mechanism oncogenesis ebv integration.
