the cbl e3 ligase linked down-modulation surface signaling
responses inducing internalization surface receptors. adaptor protein
cin85 partner cbl augments many interactions. previously,
an interaction demonstrated icp0 cin85, results the
removal epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) surface the
infected cells concomitant attenuation egfr signaling. here, we
examined whether cbl mediates removal herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1)
entry receptor nectin-1 surface infected cells. found the
following: (i) cbl, nectin-1, viral glycoprotein (gd) form a
complex infected cells; (ii) infection nectin-1 removed from
the surface infected cells retained surface cells that
have depleted cbl; (iii) cells infected δicp0 mutant
virus, nectin-1 remained cell surface. thus, cbl necessary not
sufficient removal nectin-1 cell surface. addition, we
observed cbl-depleted cells enhanced entry infection.
these cells susceptible secondary infections hsv-1. viral entry in
cin85-depleted cells moderately enhanced compared the
cbl-depleted cells, suggesting cbl-nectin-1 interaction likely the
key downregulation surface nectin-1. removal hsv-1 entry
receptor nectin-1 surface infected cells may part the
strategy virus efficiently spread uninfected cells.importance the
cbl e3 ligase suppresses surface signaling responses inducing internalization 
of surface components. targets cbl include components immune
system receptors, growth factor receptors, adhesion, cell-to-cell contact
molecules. immediate early protein icp0 herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1)
interacts cin85, adaptor protein augments cbl functions. the
consequence interaction removal epidermal growth factor
receptor (egfr) surface infected cells concomitant
suppression egf ligand signaling. viral entry receptor nectin-1 is
also internalized hsv-1 infection cbl-dependent mechanism, that
increases opportunity virus spread uninfected cells. the
diversion cbl/cin85 endocytic machinery may strategy utilized 
virus alter cell surface pattern prevent detrimental host responses.
