large amounts factor viii concentrates required treatment of
haemophiliacs. two batches nine commercial preparations examined for
their vitro properties. parameters studied factor viii coagulation
activity (f viii: c), ristocetin cofactor activity (f viii r: cof), factor
viii antigen content (f viii r: ag), fibrinogen, fibronectin immunoglobulins.
the preparations also tested determine hepatitis b marker
content. none investigated concentrates compared data given by
the manufacturers marked f viii: c deficit. preparations showed
higher values f viii r: ag f viii: c. factor viii concentrate hs was
the concentrate fibrinogen concentration the
detection limit small amounts fibronectin immunoglobulins were
detected. two nine preparations tested possible contamination with
hepatitis b viruses less ruled means hepatitis serology.
