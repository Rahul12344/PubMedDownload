the catalytic properties hammerhead ribozyme embedded (+) strand of
the satellite tobacco ringspot viral genome analyzed goal of
obtaining elemental rate constants cleavage (k(2)) ligation
(k(-)(2)) steps. two different chimeras combining strsv (+) hammerhead and
the well-characterized hammerhead 16 used measure cleavage rate
constant (k(2)), rate approach equilibrium (k(obs) = k(2) + k(-)(2)),
and fraction full-length hammerhead equilibrium (k(-)(2)/k(2) +
k(-)(2)). compared minimal hammerheads lack recently discovered 
loop i-loop ii interaction, extended format hammerhead derived strsv
studied shows least 20-fold faster k(2) 1300-fold faster k(-)(2) 
at 10 mm mgcl(2). however, magnesium dependence cleavage rate not
significantly changed. thus, enhanced cleavage hammerhead observed in
vivo due higher intrinsic rate due tighter binding of
magnesium ions. faster k(-)(2) hammerhead suggests ligation may 
be used form circular rna genomes. vitro system valuable for
experiments directed understanding hammerhead mechanism role of
the loop i-loop ii interaction.
