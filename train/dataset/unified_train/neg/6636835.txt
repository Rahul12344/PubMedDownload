oncogenic genes human malignancy.

lebowitz p.

all vertebrates possess series genes homologs oncogenic
genes acute transforming retroviruses. two lines evidence suggest that
these genes may play role development human malignancy: (1) dna 
a variety human tumors transforms nih 3t3 mouse fibroblasts the
transforming genes number carcinomas, sarcomas, hematological
malignancies identified members family genes, ras
family, closely related oncogenic genes harvey kirsten murine
sarcoma viruses; (2) correlations exist chromosomal localizations
of certain oncogenes chromosomal breakpoints specific translocations
and deletions certain human malignancies. three separate hematological
malignancies, alterations one oncogenic gene may involved 
neoplastic process.
