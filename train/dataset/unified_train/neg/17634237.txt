plant viruses act triggers targets rna silencing evolved
proteins suppress plant defense response infection. although
tobacco mosaic tobamovirus (tmv) triggers production virus-specific small 
interfering rnas (sirnas), lead efficient silencing tmv nor
is tmv-green fluorescent protein (gfp) hybrid able induce silencing a
gfp-transgene nicotiana benthamiana, indicating tmv silencing
suppressor active acts downstream sirna production. hand, 
tmv-gfp unable spread cells gfp silencing established,
suggesting viral silencing suppressor cannot revert silencing is
already established. although previous evidence indicates tobamovirus
silencing suppressing activity resides viral 126-kda small replicase
subunit, mechanism silencing suppression virus family not
known. here, connect silencing suppressing activity protein with
our previous finding oilseed rape mosaic tobamovirus infection leads to
interference hen1-mediated methylation sirna micro-rna (mirna). we
demonstrate tmv infection similarly leads interference hen1-mediated
methylation small rnas interference formation of
virus-induced disease symptoms linked silencing suppressor activity of
the 126-kda protein. moreover, show also turnip crinkle virus interferes 
with methylation sirna but, contrast tobamoviruses, the
methylation mirna.
