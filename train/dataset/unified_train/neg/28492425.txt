goals: examine patient, provider, health system barriers clinical
follow-up among us veterans chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv).
background: studies demonstrated deficiencies clinical care follow-up
in hbv; however, patient, provider, health-system barriers non-asian
populations understudied.
study: retrospective cohort 517 us veterans chronic hbv 3 diverse
veterans affairs sites 1999 2015. laboratory testing completion of
clinical appointments collected 2 years following initial presentation.
results: among hbv patients, 36% drug abuse, 41% alcohol misuse, 45% 
psychiatric disorders. patients average 4.4 primary care visits within 
2 years index hepatitis b surface antigen positive result, 38% had
psychiatry visits, 21% psychiatric hospitalization; 26% saw
gastroenterology/hepatology specialists. within 1 year index hepatitis b
surface antigen positive result, 75% alanine aminotransferase testing, 14%
had hbv entered problem list, 8% serologic confirmation. in
multivariable analyses, cirrhosis [odds ratio (or)=3.42; 95% confidence interval 
(ci), 1.84-6.36] associated higher odds appropriate laboratory
testing, alcohol misuse (or=0.45; 95% ci, 0.29-0.80) associated lower odds.
cirrhosis (or=2.03; 95% ci, 1.11-3.72) ≥2 primary care visits per year
(or=1.06; 95% ci, 1.01-1.11) associated higher odds completing
gastroenterology/hepatology consultation, whereas ≥1 psychiatric hospitalization 
in 2 years associated lower odds (or=0.53; 95% ci, 0.34-0.82).
conclusions: diverse cohort veterans high psychiatric comorbidity
and substance abuse, important patient provider factors influence appropriate
follow-up care. future studies evaluate impact provider education
and care coordination strategies hbv.
