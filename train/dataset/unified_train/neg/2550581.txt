seven temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants abelson murine leukaemia virus
(a-mulv) isolated basis temperature dependence soft
agar colony-forming ability. seven ts mutants exhibited similar
characteristics ts morphological transformation and
autophosphorylation p120gag-abl protein. dissociation properties of
morphology, soft agar colony formation tyrosine kinase activity might suggest
that v-abl product one primary intracellular target.
