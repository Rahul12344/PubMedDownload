purpose: compare changes health-related quality life (hr-qol) 3
months cohort patients initiating first antiretroviral
therapy (naive patients) patients previously treated two
nucleoside analogues switched haart (pretreated patients).
method: one hundred thirty-eight patients initiating changing haart
(indinavir plus two nucleoside analogues) recruited 23 spanish
hospitals. patients' hr-qol evaluated administering medical outcome
study hiv health survey (mos-hiv) questionnaire baseline 3 months of
treatment. clinical changes changes hr-qol measured 3 months of
treatment. size changes hr-qol scores calculated 3 months using 
the effect size (es).
results: entering study, groups showed similar characteristics except
in viral load number symptoms. naive group presented average viral 
load 2.5 times greater pretreated group 1.5 symptoms per
patient. pretreated group began treatment higher scores (better qol)
than naive group 7 11 hr-qol dimensions two health
summary scores (p <.05). 3 months treatment, significant differences
appeared groups terms percentage patients viral
loads decreased 1 log (78.9% naive group, 54.3% pretreated
group; p <.01); plasma hiv-1 viral load detectable 33.3% naive
patients versus 13.5% pretreated patients (p <.01). 3 months, no
statistically significant differences changes hr-qol found between
naive pretreated patients.
conclusion: 3 months therapy haart regimen, including two
nucleoside analogues plus indinavir, naive patients presented greater
virological response significant differences changes hr-qol when
compared pretreated patients. naive patients patients previously
treated two nucleoside analogues showed improvement clinical variables
and hr-qol period time.
