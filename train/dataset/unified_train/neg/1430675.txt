we studied impact influenza vaccine outbreak influenza a
989-student boarding school january march, 1989. february 6, 120 (17%)
of 690 students completing survey questionnaires ill fever and
respiratory symptoms. eighty-seven students received influenza vaccine the
previous 18 months; students attack rate half the
unvaccinated students (9% v 19%; vaccine efficacy = 50%, confidence interval =
0%-70%). estimate that, entire student body vaccinated,
influenza-like illness could prevented 162 students (16% the
school), preventing illness could avoided least 482
student-days missed classes, approximately one student-day 1.8
additional doses vaccine given. study suggests that, feasible, a
broad influenza immunization policy healthy students residential schools
should substantially decrease disruption school activities caused by
influenza.
