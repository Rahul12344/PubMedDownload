the age genomics dawned gradually bacteriophages. 1977 when
the genome phage phi x174 published 1983 "large" genome of
phage lambda hit streets. recently, pace quickened, we
now 100 complete phage genomes expect thousands few
years. sequences marvelously informative biology the
individual phages, advent high volume sequencing technology, 
real excitement phage biology possible analyze the
sequences together thereby address--for first time whole genome
resolution--a set fundamental biological questions related populations:
what structure global phage population? dynamics? 
do phages evolve? comparative genomics capital "c".
