miniature electromechanical systems form class biomems provide
appropriate sensitivity. research, thermo-electro-mechanical model is
presented detect biological particles microscale. identification the
model based analyzing pull-in instability parameters frequency shifts. 
here, governing equations derived via extended hamilton's principle. 
coupled effects system parameters surface layer energy, electric field
correction, material properties incorporated thermosensitive
model. afterward, accuracy present model obtained results are
validated experimental, analytical, numerical data several cases.
performing parametric study reveals mechanical properties biosensors
can significantly affect detection sensitivity actuated ultra-small
detectors taken account. furthermore, shown the
number dimension deposited particles sensing zone estimated
by investigating changes threshold voltage, electrode deflection, 
frequency shifts. present analysis likely provide pertinent guidelines 
to design thermal switches miniature detectors desired performance. 
the developed biosensor appropriate detect characterize viruses in
samples different temperatures.
