objective: examine prospectively porphyrin metabolism human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-positive population.
setting: specialist referral unit department genitourinary medicine, st
james's hospital, dublin, ireland.
patients: twenty-eight men 5 women (age range, 18-35 years). twenty-nine were
current previous intravenous drug abusers. four thought sexually 
acquired hiv infection. history acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome-defining illnesses. patients selected consecutive sample
from inpatient department. eligibility criteria cooperation urine
and stool collection confirmed hiv seropositivity. patients matched 
to 2 groups: 1 normal results porphyrin studies with
abnormal findings porphyrin studies.
intervention: none.
main outcome measures: plasma, urine, stool porphyrin excretion patterns.
results: 33 patients study, 13 (40%) increased urinary
porphyrin excretion. 2 patients seropositive hepatitis 
c virus. study patient clinical evidence porphyria. four patients
(12%), however, urine stool porphyrin excretion patterns were
classic porphyria cutanea tarda. 4 patients hepatitis c
virus-positive. patients porphyrinuria greater degree of
immunosuppression (p = .002) normal porphyrin metabolism, and
they likely taking zidovudine (p = .009).
conclusions: commonly, porphyrin metabolism abnormal persons with
established hiv infection. hepatitis c may contribute abnormal porphyrin
metabolism. unexpected number patients studied porphyrin excretion
patterns characteristic porphyria cutanea tarda, these
were hepatitis c virus-positive. diagnosis porphyria cutanea tarda,
especially young patient, prompt investigation underlying hiv and
hepatitis c virus infections. dermatologists aware infectious
risk associated vesicles erosions patients. porphyrin
studies performed patient hiv photosensitivity.
