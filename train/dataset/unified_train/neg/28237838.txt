olfactory dysfunction pervasive underappreciated health concern that
affects personal safety quality life. patients olfactory dysfunctions
have limited therapeutic options, particularly involving congenital
diseases. bardet-biedl syndrome (bbs) one disorder, olfactory loss 
and symptoms manifest defective cilium morphology and/or function in
various cell types/tissues. olfactory sensory neurons (osns) bbs mutant mice
lack capacity build/maintain cilia, rendering cells incapable odor 
detection. examined osn cilium defects bbs1 mutant mice assessed
the utility gene therapy restore ciliation function young adult 
mice. bbs1 mutant mice possessed short residual osn cilia bbsome protein
trafficking odorant detection defective. gene therapy an
adenovirus-delivered wild-type bbs1 gene restored osn ciliation, corrected bbsome
cilium trafficking defects, returned acute odor responses. finally, using
clinically approved aav serotypes, demonstrate, the first time, the
capacity aavs restore ciliation odor detection osns bbs1 mutants.
together, data demonstrate osn ciliogenesis promoted in
differentiated cells young adult bbs1 mutants highlight potential 
of gene therapy viable restorative treatment congenital olfactory
disorders.
