many viruses alter intracellular calcium homeostasis. rotavirus nonstructural
protein 4 (nsp4), endoplasmic reticulum (er) transmembrane glycoprotein,
increases intracellular levels cytoplasmic ca(2+) ([ca(2+)]cyto) a
phospholipase c-independent pathway, required virus replication 
morphogenesis. however, nsp4 domain mechanism increases [ca(2+)]cyto
are unknown. identified nsp4 domain (amino acids [aa] 47 90) that
inserts membranes structural characteristics viroporins, class 
of small hydrophobic viral proteins disrupt membrane integrity ion
homeostasis facilitate virus entry, assembly, release. mutational analysis 
showed nsp4 viroporin activity mediated amphipathic Î±-helical
domain downstream conserved lysine cluster. lysine cluster directed
integral membrane insertion viroporin domain critical for
viroporin activity. epithelial cells, expression wild-type nsp4 increased
the levels free cytoplasmic ca(2+) 3.7-fold, nsp4 viroporin mutants
maintained low levels [ca(2+)]cyto, retained er, failed to
form cytoplasmic vesicular structures, called puncta, surround viral
replication assembly sites rotavirus-infected cells. [ca(2+)]cyto was
increased pharmacologically thapsigargin, viroporin mutants formed puncta,
showing elevation calcium levels puncta formation distinct
functions nsp4 indicating nsp4 directly indirectly responds to
elevated cytoplasmic calcium levels. nsp4 viroporin activity establishes the
mechanism nsp4-mediated elevation [ca(2+)]cyto, critical event that
regulates rotavirus replication virion assembly.
