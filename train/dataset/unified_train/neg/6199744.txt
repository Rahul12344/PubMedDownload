different restriction enzyme-generated sticky dna ends joined vitro.

hung mc, wensink pc.

we describe simple method joining 5'-protruding, single-stranded dna
ends generated restriction enzymes. method allows ends different
sequences joined prevents identical ends joined. is
accomplished partially filling single strands controlled reverse
transcriptase reaction. partial filling create new single-stranded ends 
can ligated different, partially filled ends. almost useful cases,
partial filling simultaneously eliminates self-complementarity identical
ends thus prevents joined dna ligase. although all
possible combinations partially filled ends tested, tests
performed indicate method fairly general. demonstrate ends of
the length ligated useful efficiency are: 1) one
nucleotide long complementary; 2) two nucleotides long complementary or
have mismatch (da:dc) one position; 3) three nucleotides long and, our
test, dt:dc mismatch middle position.
