genetic interactions among viruses bunyamwera complex.

iroegbu cu, pringle cr.

seventy-seven temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants belonging three antigenically
distinct geographically isolated members bunyamwera complex--batai
virus, bunyamwera virus, maguari virus--have isolated after
5-fluorouracil treatment. high-frequency recombination observed, the
mutants virus classified two groups, shown be
equivalent heterologous recombination experiments. combinations
heterologous recombination less efficient homologous recombination, 
all crosses group ii mutants yielded viable recombinants. recombination 
was early event. analysis polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the
proteins wild-type viruses recombinant clones obtained six
possible heterologous combinations group ii mutants indicated that
recombination occurred reassortment genome subunits. group appeared to
correspond genome subunit coding n protein, group ii
corresponded g1/g2 determinant. g1 (or g2 both) protein was
associated neutralization specificity plaque diameter, n protein
was associated plaque opacity. complementation observed two
nonrecombining mutants maguari virus belonging group i, may indicate 
that n genome subunit codes additional protein. appeared be
no genetic barrier exchange genetic material batai, bunyamwera, and
maguari viruses vitro, concluded bunyamwera complex is
potentially single gene pool geographical ecological constraints are
discounted.
