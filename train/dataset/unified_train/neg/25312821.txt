micrornas class endogenous non-coding rnas regulate gene expression
at post-transcriptional level, thus participating diverse biological pathways.
increasing mirnas found dysregulate hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) are
involved liver tumorigenesis. study, mir-429 found obviously
downregulate much hepatitis b virus (hbv)-related hepatocellular
carcinoma. evaluate effects mir-429, mir-429 over-expressed in
hepg2.2.15 cells. results proved overexpression mir-429
decreased cell proliferation induced cell apoptosis. further, overexpression 
of mir-429 suppress secretion hbsag hbeag. concordance this,
the level notch1 expression high human hbv-related hcc tissues and
hepg2.2.15 cells. mir-429 directly targeted notch1 reduced mrna and
protein levels notch1 stimulated proliferation suppressed apoptosis 
in hcc cells. results provide new insight function mir-429 in
hbv-related hcc. beneficial insight mechanism hbv infection 
and pathophysiology hbv-related hcc.
