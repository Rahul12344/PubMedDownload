most human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) acquired sex, across mucosal 
membrane. despite many advances understanding hiv pathogenesis, the
initial events mucosal transmission poorly characterized, 
better understanding events probably key development of
successful microbicide(s) and/or preventative hiv vaccine. vast
majority mucosal hiv exposures result productive infection, implying
that innate mucosal immune defenses highly protective, failure these
mucosal defenses resulted 3 million new hiv infections 2006. review
recent findings regarding hiv mucosal immunopathogenesis, emphasizing the
importance innate immunity natural protection infection, examine
how natural induced perturbations mucosal innate system may underpin
hiv transmission. given great challenges development hiv
microbicides vaccines, identification enhancement 'natural' innate
immune defenses present attractive avenues development safe, non-toxic
microbicides.
