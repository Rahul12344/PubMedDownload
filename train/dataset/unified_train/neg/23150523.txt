neurosteroids cholesterol-derived molecules synthesized within brain,
which exert trophic protective actions. infection human feline
immunodeficiency viruses (hiv fiv, respectively) causes neuroinflammation and
neurodegeneration, leading neurological deficits. secretion of
neuroinflammatory host viral factors glia infiltrating leukocytes
mediates principal neuropathogenic mechanisms lentivirus infections,
although effect neurosteroids processes unknown. we
investigated interactions neurosteroid-mediated effects and
lentivirus infection outcomes. analyses hiv-infected (hiv(+)) uninfected
human brains disclosed reduction neurosteroid synthesis enzyme expression.
human neurons exposed supernatants hiv(+) macrophages exhibited
suppressed enzyme expression without reduced cellular viability. hiv(+) human
macrophages treated sulfated dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea-s) showed
suppression inflammatory gene (il-1β, il-6, tnf-α) expression. fiv-infected
(fiv(+)) animals treated daily 15 mg/kg body weight. dhea-s treatment
reduced inflammatory gene transcripts (il-1β, tnf-α, cd3ε, gfap) brain
compared vehicle-(β-cyclodextrin)-treated fiv(+) animals similar levels
found vehicle-treated fiv(-) animals. dhea-s treatment also increased cd4(+)
t-cell levels prevented neurobehavioral deficits neuronal loss among
fiv(+) animals, compared vehicle-treated fiv(+) animals. reduced neuronal
neurosteroid synthesis evident lentivirus infections, treatment with
dhea-s limited neuroinflammation prevented neurobehavioral deficits.
neurosteroid-derived therapies could effective treatment virus- or
inflammation-mediated neurodegeneration.
