chikungunya virus (chikv) recently re-emerged public health problem many 
countries bordering indian ocean elsewhere. chikungunya fever a
relatively self limiting febrile disease, consequences chikungunya
fever include long lasting, debilitating arthralgia, occasional
neurological involvement reported. macrophages implicated as
an important cell target chikv regards role immune
mediator, well evidence pointing long term viral persistence these
cells. microglial cells resident brain macrophages, study
sought define proteomic changes human microglial cell line (chme-5)
in response chikv infection. gelc-ms/ms analysis chikv infected mock
infected cells identified 1455 individual proteins, 90 proteins,
belonging diverse cellular pathways, significantly regulated a
significance level p<0.01. analysis protein profile response to
infection support global inhibition either normal ires-mediated
translation, consistent targeting specific cellular pathways 
including regulating innate antiviral mechanisms.
