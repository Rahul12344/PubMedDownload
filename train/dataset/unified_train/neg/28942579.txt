vertical horizontal pollen transmission important efficient infection 
by viroids. vertical pollen transmission viroids attributed the
infection viroid embryo sac infected pollen. identify the
viroid infection pollen pollen tubes elongating transmitting
tract, used situ hybridization histochemically analyze distribution 
of tomato planta macho viroid (tpmvd) pollen grains, stigma, style 
petunia plants. tpmvd present generative nucleus vegetative
nucleus mature infected pollen grains germinating pollen grains. during
pollen tube growth, tpmvd present vegetative nucleus two sperm
nuclei, generated division generative nucleus style
transmitting tract. findings indicated viroid infection sperm
nuclei responsible vertical pollen transmission viroids. tpmvd
infection tpmvd-infected pollen tubes transmitting tract not
observed. addition, tpmvd signals confirmed stigma and
transmitting tract tpmvd-infected petunia plants, suggesting viroids may 
not replicate tissues stage mature style. therefore, tpmvd may
leak pollen tube somewhere ovary, except transmitting
tract, horizontal transmission tpmvd.
