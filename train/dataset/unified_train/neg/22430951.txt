indirect immunofluorescence techniques targeting rotavirus (rv) protein vp6
are used differentiate rv species. ictv recognizes rv species e and
two tentative species, f g. potential new rv species, adrv-n, been
described. phylogenetic trees pairwise identity frequency graphs were
constructed 400 available vp6 sequences seven newly determined
vp6 sequences rvd strains. rv species separated distinct
phylogenetic clusters. amino acid sequence cutoff value 53% firmly
permitted differentiation rv species, adrv-n tentatively assigned a
novel rv species h (rvh).
