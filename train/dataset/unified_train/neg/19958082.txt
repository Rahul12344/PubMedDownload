viruses exploit host transcription translation mechanisms to
replicate hostile host cellular environment, therefore, likely
that infected host may impose pressure viral evolution. study, 
investigated differences codon usage preferences among highly mutable
single strain rna viruses infect vertebrate invertebrate hosts,
respectively. incorporate principal component analysis (pca) k-mean
methods clustering viruses infected different type hosts. relative
synonymous codon usage (rscu) indices genes 32 rna viruses were
calculated, correlation rscu indices among different viruses was
analyzed pca. results show positive correlation codon usage
preferences among viruses target host category. results k-means 
clustering analysis confirmed statistical significance study,
demonstrating viruses infecting vertebrate hosts different codon usage 
preferences invertebrate viruses. based analysis the
effective number codons (enc) relation gc-content synonymous 
third codon position (gc3s), identified mutational pressure was
the dominant evolution driving force making different codon usage
preferences. study suggests new effective way characterize
host-dependent rna viruses based codon usage pattern.
