fifteen human herpesvirus 6 (hhv-6) strain variants analysed pcr
amplifications, restriction enzyme site polymorphism sequence analyses. three
dna regions chosen study: fragment variable glycoprotein gene
(210 bp), conserved glycoprotein h (gh) gene complete intergenic
sequences (2381 bp) 5' intergenic region n-terminal coding
sequence gh polymorphic bamhi site (427 bp). infected cell dna from
five laboratory reference strains including gs, u1102, aj, z29 kf were
examined together dna peripheral blood lymphocytes infected hhv-6 
reactivated blood and/or marrow five bone marrow transplant (bmt)
patients. separate blood marrow isolates obtained four bmt
patients. addition, hhv-6 sequences examined directly one six
hodgkin's lymphomas six b cell proliferations contained hhv-6 dna as
detected pcr amplification. results show two groups closely
related heterogeneous strains correlate previous groupings by
antigenic restriction site differences. variant strains
(including laboratory strains gs, u1102 aj) variant b strains (including 
laboratory strains z29 kf, hodgkin's lymphoma strain, nine bmt
patient isolates). variations groups 4 6% nucleotide
sequence 5 8.5% amino acid sequence. within group maximum
heterogeneity observed different genes. variant strains differed 2.0%
in variable glycoprotein gene sequence whereas variant b strains were
identical region; conversely, variant b strains differed 2 3% in
the gh n-terminal intergenic sequences whereas variant strains differed
there less 0.2%. evidence sequence drift independent of
selection: relationships groups shown analyses amino acid 
sequence, coding nucleotide sequence well intergenic sequence, b
variant-specific bamhi site gh gene due non-coding nucleotide
substitution. little evidence vivo vitro variation: gh
nucleotide sequence uncultured lymphoma strain (first variant b gh gene 
identified) almost identical gh sequence four bmt isolates, and
matched bmt isolates blood marrow identical single
nucleotide substitution.(abstract truncated 400 words)
