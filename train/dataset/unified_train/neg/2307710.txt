we describe construction retroviral vectors expression of
recombinant rat fibronectin (fn) cdnas corresponding various
alternatively spliced forms fn. nih 3t3 cells, exogenous rat fn
subunits efficiently secreted heterodimers endogenous mouse subunits.
in contrast, lymphoid wehi231 cells, endogenous fn synthesis and
the recombinant fns secreted purified homogeneous proteins. 
show purified recombinant fns biochemically biologically
functional. basic assays adhesion, spreading, cytoskeletal organization,
and migration using various established adherent cell lines, different forms of
fns containing different alternatively spliced segments show marked
differences activity. used recombinant fns investigate three 
systems earlier results suggested potential differences between
different forms fn. first, forms tested appear equally active restoring
normal morphology transformed cell line. second, detect minor differences
in ability assemble preexisting extracellular matrices. finally, we
report forms fn contain v segment promote the
spreading lymphoid cell line indicating segment confers additional
biological functions cell types, result confirms extends
earlier data. homogeneous, biologically active recombinant fns allow
further studies role alternatively spliced segments fn.
