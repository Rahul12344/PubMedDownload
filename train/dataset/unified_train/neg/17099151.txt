horses inoculated vesicular stomatitis new jersey indiana viruses
by routes simulating contact vector transmission. clinical signs, lesions,
antibody development, viral shedding persistence, viremia monitored.
horses infected viruses routes confirmed by
seroconversion. salivation, primary lesions inoculation sites, secondary
oral lesions common clinical findings. viral shedding most
often oral cavity, followed nasal cavity; titers highest
from oral cavity samples. virus rarely isolated conjunctival sac and
never feces blood. development neutralizing antibody coincided with
cessation lesion development detection virus isolation. circulating 
virus-specific igm, igg, iga, neutralizing antibodies developed most
animals postinoculation (pi) days 6 12, depending route inoculation.
at postmortem (pi days 12 15), lesions healing, vesicular, and
did contain detectable virus isolation, reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction, immunohistochemistry. numerous infiltrating lymphocytes and
plasma cells suggested lesion resolution partially due local
immunity. detection viral rna tonsil lymph nodes head necropsy 
suggests tissues play role pathogenesis disease;
molecular techniques targeting tissues may useful confirming
infection resolving stages disease. routes inoculation used 
study reflect diversity transmission routes may occur during
outbreaks used study contact vector transmission,
vaccine development, clarify pathogenesis disease horses.
