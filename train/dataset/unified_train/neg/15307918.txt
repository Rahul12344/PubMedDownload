it well known hiv-1 establish infection nonhuman primates,
nor cell lines derived them, due existence saturable resistance
factors. study, show vitro established macaca
fascicularis-derived cd4(-) b cell line (f6) productively infected 
laboratory-adapted t-tropic hxbc2/hiv-1 strain low multiplicity infection, 
apparently express restriction factor been
detected simian cell lines. moreover, efficient entry f6 cells 
obtained pseudotyped recombinant hiv-1 viruses containing the
laboratory-adapted t-tropic (hxbc2) dual-tropic (89.6) envelope
glycoproteins, whereas entry virus containing envelope glycoproteins of
the m-tropic ba-l strain less efficient. virus containing primary t-tropic
(eli) envelope glycoproteins infect f6 cells. furthermore, although ccr5 
was present cell surface gpr15 strl33 mrnas expressed
in cells, high level infection f6 cells m-tropic simian
immunodeficiency virus sivmac316 observed. contrast, f6 cells poorly 
infected t-tropic sivmac239. given unique properties f6 cell line, 
i.e., simian origin yet able infected hiv-1 a
cd4-independent manner, f6 cells represent useful model studying cellular
factors mediating resistance permissivity hiv-1 infection may help to
evaluate hiv-1 siv cell tropism.
