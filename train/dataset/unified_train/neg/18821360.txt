background: retroviral vectors regularly used transduce stem cells and
their derivatives experimental therapeutic purposes. these
vectors integrate semi-randomly cellular genome, analysis of
integranated retroviral dna/host cell dna junctions (ihj) facilitates clonality
studies engrafted cells, allowing differentiation, survival fate 
be tracked. case adverse events, ihj analysis allow the
identification potentially oncogenic integration sites. present, most
measures assess ihj complex, insensitive may subject ihj
selection bias inherent technology used.
methods: developed validated simple effective technique for
generating libraries ihj, term flanking-sequence exponential
anchored-polymerase chain reaction (flea-pcr). flanking-sequence random anchoring
is used alternative restriction enzyme digestion cassette ligation
to allow consistent detection ihj decrease bias.
results: individual clones plasmid libraries sequenced assembled 
using custom-written software, flea-pcr smears analyzed capillary
electrophoresis digestion restriction enzymes.
discussion: approach readily analyze complex mixtures ihj, allowing
localization sequences genomic sites. approach should
simplify analysis retroviral integration.
