the aquatic birnavirus induces mitochondria-mediated cell death fish; however,
the molecular mechanism remains unknown. present study, demonstrated
that aquatic birnavirus-induced mitochondria-mediated cell death regulated 
the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 family member, zfbcl-xl, anti-apoptotic and
enhances host cell viability. first, chse-214 cells carrying egfp-zfbcl-xl fused 
genes selected, established culture, used examine involvement 
of zfbcl-xl host cell protection effects viral infection.
egfp-zfbcl-xl found prevent infectious pancreatic necrosis virus
(ipnv)-induced phosphatidylserine exposure 40% 12 h 24 h
post-infection (p.i.), block ipnv-induced loss mitochondrial membrane
potential (δψm), enhance host viability middle late replication
stages. addition, zfbcl-xl overexpression prevented ipnv-induced caspase-9
activation 25% 85% middle (12 h p.i.) late (24 h p.i.)
replication stages without affecting expression viral proteins vp3 (as
a viral death protein) protein. present study, demonstrated that
aquatic birnavirus-induced cell death prevented anti-apoptotic bcl-2
family member, zfbcl-xl, enhances host cell viability blockage of
mitochondrial disruption caspase-9 activation.
