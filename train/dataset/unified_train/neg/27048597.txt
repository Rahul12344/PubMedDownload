multidomain proapoptotic bcl-2-associated x (bax) protein essential
effector responsible mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, resulting
in cell death via apoptosis. study, two bax genes grass carp
(ctenopharyngodon idellus), designated cibax1 cibax2, isolated and
analyzed. obtained cibax1 cdna 2058 bp long, 579 bp open reading
frame (orf) coding protein 192 amino acid residues. full-length cdna 
cibax2 1161 bp, 618 bp orf coding 205 amino acids. cibax1 and
cibax2 typical members bcl-2 family containing conserved bcl and
c-terminal domains, share conserved synteny zebrafish bax genes
despite grass carp bax mapping different linkage groups. phylogenetic
analysis showed cibax1 clustered bax teleost fish, and
cibax2 close bax2 teleost fish far separated salmo
salar. quantitative real-time pcr analysis revealed broad expression cibax1
and cibax2 tissues healthy grass carp, relative expression level 
differed. mrna expression cibax1 cibax2 upregulated
significantly peaked examined tissues days 5 6 post-infection
with grass carp reovirus. subcellular localization indicated cibax1 protein 
was localized nucleus cytosol, cibax2 protein cytosol. 
moreover, cibax2, cibax1 colocalized mitochondrion normal 
condition. taken together, findings would helpful further
understanding function bax teleost fish.
