retroviruses relatives, ltr-retrotransposons, possess integrase 
protein (in) required insertion reverse transcripts the
genome host cells. schizosaccharomyces pombe host tf1, an
ltr-retrotransposon integration activity studied using
techniques yeast genetics. study, sought identify amino acid
substitutions tf1 specifically affected integration step of
transposition. addition seeking amino acid substitutions in, also
explored possibility tf1 proteins contributed integration. by
comparing results genetic assays monitored transposition and
reverse transcription, able seek point mutations throughout tf1 that
blocked transposition synthesis reverse transcripts. mutant 
versions tf1 candidates elements possessed defects the
integration step transposition. five mutations tf1 resulted low
levels integration found located protein: two
substitutions n-terminal zn domain, two catalytic core, one 
the c-terminal domain. results suggested three domains 
was required tf1 transposition. potential role five amino acid
residues function discussed. two mutations reduced
integration mapped rnase h (rh) domain tf1 reverse transcriptase. the
tf1 elements rh mutations produced high levels reverse transcripts,
as determined recombination dna blot analysis. results indicated
that rh tf1 possesses function critical transposition is
independent accumulation reverse transcripts.
