luteoviruses poleroviruses important plant viruses transmitted
exclusively aphids circulative manner via aphid haemolymph. a
chaperonin protein, groel, synthesized aphids symbiotic bacterium,
buchnera aphidicola, hypothesized bind virus particles the
haemolymph, thereby promoting transmission. investigate hypothesis, the
groel-binding site barley yellow dwarf virus (bydv) determined vitro, 
and abundance groel protein different aphid tissues investigated.
virus binding peptide library representing full groel molecule revealed 
a single binding site coincides site anchors two groel rings
to form native groel tetradecamer. functional form groel
protein, virus binding would compete formation two groel rings.
using mab raised buchnera-specific groel epitope, groel detected 
in buchnera cells immunoblotting immunocytochemistry, aphid
haemolymph, fat body gut. prediction groel-virus
interactions probably severely limited competition groel
molecules, evidence groel available interact virus
particles vivo, concluded groel-virus interactions unlikely 
contribute virus transmission aphids.
