4-azido, 4-amino, 4-amido 4-alkoxy compounds related lignans
podophyllotoxin 4'-demethylepipodophyllotoxin synthesized, and
their structures elucidated. ritter reaction shown useful the
preparation 4-amido compounds required stereochemistry. a
preparative method 4-chloro-4-deoxypicrophyllotoxin, earlier
synthetic attempts resulted two dehydrated compounds, alpha- and
beta-apopicropodophyllotoxin, developed. supplementary preliminary studies of
the biological activities compounds performed. compounds 
had pronounced inhibitory effect vitro growth human cervical cancer 
cells tc-mouse cells 4-amino-4-deoxypodophyllotoxin and
4-azido-4-deoxypodophyllotoxin showing highest activity. alkaline elution
studies indicate toxicity 4'-demethoxy derivatives due to
protein-mediated dna nicking. none compounds found antiviral 
effect herpes simplex type 2 (hsv-2), human immunodeficiency (hiv), and
cytomegalovirus (cmv) doses toxic cells.
