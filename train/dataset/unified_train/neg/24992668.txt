human bocavirus (hbov) nonenveloped, single-stranded dna virus, classified
recently genus bocavirus family parvoviridae. recombinant
baculovirus expression system used express major capsid protein vp2 of
hbov1, hbov2, hbov3 hbov4 insect cells. large amount 61-kda vp2
capsid protein (p61) hbovs generated efficiently released the
supernatant. capsid protein self-assembled 22-nm-dia. virus-like
particles (vlps) buoyant density 1.30g/cm(3). morphology of
hbovs-lps similar native hbov particles, immunogenic
studies demonstrated cross-reactivity among hbov1, hbov2, hbov3 hbov4.
when vp1 vp2 protein hbov1 co-expressed insect cells, both
proteins detected fraction cscl gradient centrifugation,
suggesting vp1 protein minor structural protein hbovs. we
developed elisa using purified vlps antigen used detect
antibodies hbov1, hbov2, hbov3 hbov4. high prevalence antibodies
against hbovs found general population healthy japanese, indicating
that hbovs spread throughout japan.
