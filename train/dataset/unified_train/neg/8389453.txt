an open reading frame, bamhi d6r, central highly conserved region the
shope fibroma virus (sfv) genome sequenced found significant
homology uracil dna glycosylases number organisms. uracil
dna glycosylase catalyzes initial step repair pathway removes
potentially mutagenic uracil duplex dna. d6r polypeptide expressed
in reticulocyte lysates programmed rna transcribed expression vector
containing t7 rna polymerase promoter. highly specific ethidium bromide
fluorescence assay vitro translation product determined the
encoded protein indeed possess uracil dna glycosylase activity. open reading
frames poxviruses, including vaccinia virus (hindiii d4r) fowlpox 
(d4), highly homologous d6r sfv predicted encode uracil dna 
glycosylases. identification sfv uracil dna glycosylase provides evidence 
that poxviral protein involved repair viral dna genome.
since enzyme performs initial step required removal of
uracil dna, creating apyrimidinic site, suggest other, possibly
virus-encoded, repair activities must present cytoplasm infected
cells complete uracil excision repair pathway.
