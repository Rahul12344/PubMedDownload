the catalytic subunit (pol) herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) dna polymerase 
been extensively studied model family b dna polymerases and
for differences enzymes antiviral target. among the
activities hsv-1 pol intrinsic rnase h activity cleaves rna from
rna-dna hybrids. long controversy regarding whether this
activity due 3'-to-5' exonuclease pol whether separate
activity, possibly acting 5' rna termini. investigate issue, we
compared wild-type hsv-1 pol 3'-to-5' exonuclease-deficient mutant, d368a
pol, dna polymerase activity, 3'-to-5' exonuclease activity, rnase h
activity vitro additionally, assessed rnase h activity using
differentially end-labeled templates 5' 3' rna termini. mutant enzyme
was modestly impaired dna polymerase activity drastically
impaired 3'-to-5' exonuclease activity, activity detected even at
high enzyme-to-dna substrate ratios. importantly, mutant showed detectable
ability excise rna either 3' 5' terminus, wild-type hsv-1 
pol able cleave rna annealed rna-dna hairpin template, only
detectably 3' rna terminus 3'-to-5' direction rate lower
than exonuclease activity. results suggest hsv-1 pol 
not rnase h separable 3'-to-5' exonuclease activity that
this activity prefers dna degradation degradation rna rna-dna
hybrids.importance herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) member the
herpesviridae family dna viruses, several cause morbidity and
mortality humans. although hsv-1 dna polymerase studied for
decades crucial target antivirals hsv-1 infection, several
of functions remain elucidated. hypothesis suggesting existence
of 5'-to-3' rnase h activity intrinsic enzyme could remove rna
primers okazaki fragments particularly controversial. this
study, unable identify rnase h activity hsv-1 dna polymerase on
rna-dna hybrids 5' rna termini. detected rnase h activity hybrids with
3' termini, due 3'-to-5' exonuclease. thus, hsv-1 unlikely
to use method remove rna primers dna replication may use
pathways similar used eukaryotic okazaki fragment maturation.
