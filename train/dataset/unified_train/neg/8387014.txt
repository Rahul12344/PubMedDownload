interferons (ifn) cancer suppressor activities many transformed cells;
however, ifn suppress transformation sv40 large antigen. the
studies described paper therefore evaluated effect ifn on
sv40-promoted gene expression 3t3t cells. results show sv40-promoted 
gene expression induced 200% three-fold type ifn treatment
regardless whether beta-galactosidase chloramphenicol acetyltransferase
(cat) used reporter gene. ifn effect dosage-dependent, requires
24-48 h exposure maximum induction cat activity, probably not
due post-transcriptional effect ifn cat ifn effect on
cat expression driven thymidine kinase promoter. induction sv40 early
transcription ifn does, however, require integration plasmid
within cell's genome. additional data specifically show sv40
promoter required ifn's effect ifn induce cat sv40
enhancer inserted upstream thymidine kinase promoter control expression 
of cat gene.
