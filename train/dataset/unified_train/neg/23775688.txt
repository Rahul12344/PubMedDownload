alpha-synuclein amyloidogenic protein expressed brain involved in
parkinson's disease. intrinsically disordered protein folds an
alpha-helix rich structure upon binding membrane lipids. helical
alpha-synuclein penetrate membrane form oligomeric ion channels,
thereby eliciting important perturbations calcium fluxes. study of
alpha-synuclein/lipid interactions shed light molecular
mechanisms controlling targeting functional insertion alpha-synuclein 
in neural membranes. protein first interacts cell surface
glycosphingolipid (ganglioside gm3 astrocytes gm1 neurons). induces
the folding alpha-helical domain containing tilted peptide (67-78) that
displays high affinity cholesterol. driving force insertion
process formation transient oh-pi hydrogen bond the
ganglioside aromatic ring alpha-synuclein residue tyr-39. the
higher polarity tyr-39 vs. lipid bilayer forces protein cross the
membrane, allowing tilted peptide reach cholesterol. tilted geometry
of cholesterol/alpha-synuclein complex facilitates formation an
oligomeric channel. interestingly, functional cooperation between
glycosphingolipids cholesterol presents striking analogy virus fusion 
mechanisms.
