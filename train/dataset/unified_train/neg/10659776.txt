whereas resistance genes (r-genes) governing qualitative resistance been
isolated characterized, biological roles genes governing quantitative 
resistance (quantitative trait loci, qtls) still unknown. hypothesized
that genes qtls could share homologies cloned r-genes. used a
pcr-based approach isolate r-gene analogs (rgas) consensus primers
corresponding conserved domains cloned r-genes: (i) nucleotide
binding site (nbs) hydrophobic domain, (ii) kinase domain.
pcr-amplified fragments sequenced mapped pepper intraspecific map. 
nbs-containing sequences pepper, similar n gene tobacco, were
classified seven families mapped unique region covering 64 cm
on noir chromosome. kinase domain containing sequences cloned r-gene
homologs (pto, fen, cf-2) mapped four different linkage groups. qtl
involved partial resistance cucumber mosaic virus (cmv) additive
effect closely linked allelic one nbs-type family. qtls epistatic 
effects also detected several rga loci. colocalizations between
nbs-containing sequences resistance qtls suggest mechanisms of
qualitative quantitative resistance may similar cases.
