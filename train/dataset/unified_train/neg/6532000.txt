the complete nucleotide sequence determined rna aino virus,
a member simbu serogroup (bunyavirus genus, family bunyaviridae). s
rna 850 nucleotides long (2.76 x 10(5) daltons) viral complementary
sequence short 5' non-coding region 34 nucleotides extensive 
3' non-coding region 117 nucleotides. 3'-5' complementarity aino 
rna 25 residues long, depending arrangement. aino sequence
predicts that, like snowshoe hare (ssh) la crosse (lac) bunyaviruses (bishop,
d.h.l., et al. (1982) nucleic acids res., 10, 3703-3713; akashi, h. bishop,
d.h.l. (1983) j. virol. 45, 1155-1158), two coded gene products, a
nucleoprotein n, non-structural protein, nss, read from
overlapping reading frames viral complementary sequence. aino n
primary gene product composed 233 amino acids (26.2 x 10(3) daltons) is
45% homologous sequence lac virus. nss protein aino virus 
is composed 91 amino acids (10.5 x 10(3) daltons) 35% homologous in
sequence lac nss protein. unlike viruses uridylate
