human herpesviruses infect eye excreted subsequently tears. the
aim present study use multiplex pcr detect herpesviruses
(hsv-1, -2, vzv, cmv, ebv, hhv-6) tears normal subjects patients
with pathological conditions (acute herpes, zoster, papillary conjunctivitis, and
dry eye). schirmer test strips used collect tear fluid 93 patients, 
sampling eyes. dna extracted 186 samples by
chromatography, viral dna amplified using commercialised multiplex "stair
primer" method. thirty-four samples (18.3%) contained taq inhibitors. the
multiplex test gave positive results hsv vzv tear fluid patients 
with acute dendritic keratitis (3 patients) acute ocular zoster (4 patients) 
and was, therefore, considered effective testing samples patients with
acute lesions. hsv-1 hsv-2 found two samples patients with
metaherpetic corneal scarring. among 28 cases dry eye, two positive for
hhv-6, latter associated ebv one patient. hhv-6 also found 
in 4 54 cases papillary conjunctivitis. raised occurrence hhv-6
in dry eye papillary conjunctivitis, suggests new clinical patterns hhv-6 
latency reactivation. detection ebv 1 80 healthy eyes confirms
previous evidence lacrimal glands constitute potentially site for
latent-phase ebv.
