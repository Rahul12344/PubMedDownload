mild moderate autoimmune thrombocytopenia (aitp) common finding in
patients receiving interferon-based antiviral treatment, due bone marrow
suppression. report case patient chronic genotype 1b
hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection treated pegylated-interferon alpha-2a,
ribavirin telaprevir 24 wk; patient developed severe aitp three weeks
after treatment withdrawal. performed systematic literature search order 
to review published cases aitp related hcv antiviral treatment. 
knowledge, second case aitp observed antiviral treatment
withdrawal. published cases aitp occurred treatment; fact,
among 24 cases aitp related interferon-based antiviral treatment, one 
occurred discontinuation. early diagnosis aitp key factor order 
to achieve early interferon discontinuation; era new direct
antiviral agents patients considered interferon-free
treatment regimens. prompt prescription immuno-suppressant treatment (i.e.,
corticosteroids, immunoglobulin infusion even rituximab unresponsive
cases) leads favourable prognosis cases. physicians using
interferon-based treatments aware aitp occur and
after treatment, specially new era interferon-free antiviral treatment.
finally, case suspected aitp, presence anti-platelet antibodies
