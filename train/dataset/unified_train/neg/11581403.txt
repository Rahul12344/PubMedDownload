transcriptional activation diverse cellular genes x protein (hbx) of
hepatitis b virus (hbv) suggested one mechanisms for
hbv-associated hepatocellular carcinoma. however, functions hbx been
studied using transformed cells culture examined the
normal adult hepatocytes, natural host hbv. using efficient
hepatocyte-specific virus-based gene delivery system developed laboratory 
earlier, studied hbx action vivo. demonstrate following
virosome-mediated delivery hbx dna, large population (>50%) hepatocytes
express hbx protein dose-dependent manner, induces significant
increase activity extracellular signal-regulated kinases (erks) 
livers hbx-transfected mice. inhibition hbx-induced erk activation
following intravenous administration pd98059, mitogen-activated protein
kinase kinase kinase (mek) inhibitor, confirmed requirement mek the
activation erks hbx. induction erk activity hbx sustained 
to 30 days. interestingly, sustained activation c-jun n-terminal kinases
(jnks) 30 days also noted. constitutive erk jnk activation
as consequence continued hbx expression also led sustained stimulation of
further downstream events, increased levels c-jun c-fos proteins
along persistent induction activator protein 1 binding activity.
taken together, data suggest critical role molecules in
hbx-mediated cell transformation.
