single-stranded reovirus rna, synthesized vitro reovirus cores, functioned 
as messenger rna cell-free extracts prepared several mammalian cells:
krebs ii mouse ascites cells, mouse l cells, chinese hamster ovary cells, hela
cells, rabbit reticulocytes. shown acrylamide gel electrophoresis, 
eight polypeptides known specified reovirus synthesized the
reticulocyte system. extracts, 5 7 complete virus proteins
were made.
