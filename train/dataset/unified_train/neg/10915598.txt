turnip crinkle virus (tcv) single-stranded positive-sense rna virus the
carmovirus genus. two five open reading frames (orfs), encoding proteins
of 8 9 kda, required cell-to-cell movement virus. these
movement proteins (mps) fused green fluorescent protein (gfp) to
determine cellular localization. protoplasts, p9-gfp, like gfp itself,
is found throughout cytoplasm, well cell nuclei. contrast, p8-gfp
was confined cell nucleus. similar localization patterns observed
when specific small peptide epitopes fused p8 p9 proteins instead 
gfp. cytoplasmic localization p9-gfp nuclear localization p8-gfp
were also detected leaves particle bombardment dna encoding these
fusion proteins overexpression p8-gfp transgenic arabidopsis
seedlings. expression gfp fusion proteins recombinant tcv viruses
in infected protoplasts inoculated arabidopsis leaves produced similar
patterns. unlike tmv-mp mps studied date, obvious punctuate
expression cell wall association cytoskeleton detected.
the sequence analysis p8 revealed two unique nuclear localization signals
(nlss), conserved within p8 homologues viruses the
genus carmovirus. mutation either nlss disrupt nuclear
localization p8-gfp. however, nlss mutated, p8-gfp expression
was longer restricted cell nuclei. nlss required for
cell-to-cell movement; tcv recombinant viruses mutated one nlss could 
still facilitate cell-to-cell movement virus. nuclear localization 
p8 suggests novel function protein cell nucleus.
