study investigated presence antibodies influenza h1n1 h3n2
viruses pigs peninsular malaysia using herdcheck swine influenza h1n1 and

examined nasal swabs seropositive pigs virus isolation real
time rt-pcr. list pig farms obtained headquarters the
department veterinary services, malaysia, pig herds selected randomly
from six 11 states peninsular malaysia. total 727 serum nasal swab
samples collected 4- 6-month-old pigs may august 2005.
by elisa, seroprevalences swine influenza h1n1 h3n2 among pigs were
12.2% 12.1% respectively. seropositivity either virus subtypes was
detected less half 41 sampled farms (41.4%). combination both
subtypes detected 4% pigs 22% sampled farms. however, 
virus viral nucleic acid detected nasal samples. study
identified seropositivity pigs h1n1 h3n2 based elisa was
