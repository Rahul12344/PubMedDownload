backgroundprogress towards hiv, hepatitis b virus (hbv) hepatitis c virus
(hcv) elimination requires local prevalence estimates linkage care (ltc)
of undiagnosed disengaged cases.aimwe aimed estimate seroprevalence,
factors associated positive blood-borne virus (bbv) serology numbers
needed screen (nns) detect new bbv diagnosis achieve full ltc from
emergency department (ed) bbv testing.methodsduring 9-month programme ed 
in east london, england, testing offered adult attendees full
blood count (fbc). estimated factors associated positive bbv serology
using logistic regression nns inverse seroprevalence. estimates
were weighted age, sex ethnicity fbc population.resultsof 6,211
fbc patients tested, 217 (3.5%) positive least one bbv. weighted bbv 
seroprevalence 4.2% (95% confidence interval (ci): 3.6-4.9). adjusted odds
ratios (aor) positive bbv serology elevated among patients were:
male (aor: 2.7; 95% ci: 1.9-3.9), 40-59 years old (aor: 1.9; 95% ci: 1.4-2.7), of
black british/black ethnicity (aor: 1.8; 95% ci: 1.2-2.8) fixed
address (aor: 2.9; 95% ci: 1.5-5.5). nns detect new bbv diagnosis 154
(95% ci: 103-233) 135 (95% ci: 93-200) achieve ltc.conclusionsthe low nns 
suggests routine bbv screening eds may worthwhile. considering
similar programmes use findings inform assessments of
anticipated public health benefits.
