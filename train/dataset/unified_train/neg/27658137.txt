background: type 1 diabetes mellitus (t1dm) speculated impaired
immunological response vaccines. paper aimed investigate presence 
of specific antibodies hepatitis b virus (hbv) measles diabetic
children immunized according standard national calendar of
immunization.
methods: two hundred one diabetic children 140 healthy controls were
prospectively evaluated. antibodies hepatitis b (anti-hbs) measles
were detected individuals completed vaccination schedule. noted
onset t1dm, duration disease, diabetes-related autoantibodies mean 
hba1c levels.
results: 72.6% diabetics 82.1% controls anti-hbs (+) (p=0.04).
we found reduced efficacy measles vaccination anti-hbs (-) diabetic
children (p=0.009), even though significant difference the
study control groups. onset disease earlier anti-hbs (-)
diabetics controls (p=0.038). difference respect other
parameters found.
conclusions: data showed reduced seroprotection rate hbv vaccination in
diabetic children measles anti-hbs (-) diabetics. larger studies
should encouraged confirm vaccine efficacy diabetic children 
elucidate possible pathogenic mechanisms.
