expected that, end 1997, endemic countries world have
conducted full national immunization days (nid), providing supplemental oral
polio vaccine (opv) nearly two-thirds children < 5 years. contrast, 
although globally acute flaccid paralysis (afp) surveillance conducted 
in 126 (86%) 146 countries polio recently endemic,
surveillance remains incomplete untimely. global network polio
laboratories, capable detecting wild poliovirus occurs, 
been developed. furthermore, countries polio virus circulation 
limited focal areas, surveillance adequate, mopping-up campaigns are
being conducted eliminate final chains transmission. process for
certification polio eradication established region as
well global level. impact eradication initiative evident,
with 88% decrease number reported cases globally since 1988. in
order achieve goal eradication, rapid development complete and
timely afp surveillance continuation effective nids constitute an
urgent priority. particular relevance remaining polio-endemic
countries, especially affected war politically isolated
and important remaining reservoirs wild poliovirus continues to
spread bordering even distant polio-free countries. external support will
continue required countries regions incidence of
polio reached low levels ensure final chains poliovirus
transmission interrupted permit eventual certification of
eradication. year 2000 objective achieving poliomyelitis eradication
remains feasible target.
