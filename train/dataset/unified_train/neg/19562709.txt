it suggested hepatitis c virus (hcv) patients hepatocellular
carcinoma (hcc) may worse outcomes liver transplantation (lt) 
of aggressive tumor biology. study, determined post-lt
survival hcc patients without hcv using united network organ
sharing data january 1994 march 2008. patients hcc stratified
into hcv (hcc-hcv) non-hcv (hcc-non-hcv) groups. era model 
for end-stage liver disease (meld), 1237 hcc patients (780, hcv; 373, 
non-hcv; 84, unknown hcv status), meld era, 4933 hcc
patients (3272, hcv; 1348, non-hcv; 313, unknown). pre-meld era, 5-year
graft (58.6% versus 53.7%) patient (61.7% versus 59.3%) survival rates were
marginally higher hcc-non-hcv patients hcc-hcv patients. meld
era also, 5-year graft (61.2% versus 55.5%) patient (63.7% versus 58.2%)
survival rates marginally higher hcc-non-hcv patients hcc-hcv
patients. patients without hcc, pre-meld meld era graft/patient survival
rates non-hcv patients higher hcv patients. the
differences survival rates hcc patients without hcv lower
than non-hcc patients stratified hcv status. hcv no
additional negative impact post-lt survival patients hcc, this
was confirmed multivariate analysis. conclusion, survival of
hcc patients remained unchanged past 2 decades. hcv patients a
lower survival rate non-hcv patients, regardless hcc status, but
hcv additional negative impact survival patients hcc.
