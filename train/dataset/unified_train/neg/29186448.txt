hiv-uninfected individuals rakai district, uganda evaluate
seroprevalence anti-hepatitis e virus (hev) igg antibodies. hev seroprevalence
was 47%, 1 hiv-infected individual actively infected genotype 3
virus. using modified poisson regression, male sex (prevalence ratios [pr] =
1.247; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.071-1.450) chronic hepatitis b virus
infection (pr = 1.377; 95% ci, 1.090-1.738) associated hev
seroprevalence. hiv infection status (pr = 0.973; 95% ci, 0.852-1.111) not
