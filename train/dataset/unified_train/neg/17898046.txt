a monoclonal fab (fab 3674) selected human nonimmune phage library by
panning chimeric construct n(ccg)-gp41 (which comprises exposed
coiled-coil trimer gp41 n helices fused helical phase onto minimal 
thermostable ectodomain gp41) described. fab 3674 shown neutralize
diverse laboratory-adapted b strains human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(hiv-1) primary isolates subtypes a, b, c env-pseudotyped-virus 
neutralization assay, albeit reduced potency (approximately 25-fold)
compared 2f5 4e10. alanine scanning mutagenesis maps novel
epitope shallow groove n helices gp41 exposed two 
c helices fusogenic six-helix bundle conformation gp41. bivalent fab
3674 c34 peptide (a potent fusion inhibitor derived c helix of
gp41) shown act similar stages fusion reaction neutralize
hiv-1 synergistically, providing additional evidence epitope fab 3674
is new distinct binding site c34.
