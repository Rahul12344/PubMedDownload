background: human t-cell lymphotrophic virus (htlv) causes adult t-cell
leukemia-lymphoma, tropical spastic paraparesis-htlv type i, associated
myelopathy.
methods: analysis performed serum samples multiorgan donor and
the five recipients. also studied donor's family partner one
of renal recipients. serologic detection anti-htlv antibodies carried 
out enzyme immunoassay western blot confirm discriminate between
htlv types. analysis proviral dna performed polymerase chain reaction
and sequenced long terminal repeat region env gene. peripheral
blood mononuclear cell samples recipients htlv-i-positive
organs donor's mother studied.
results: two years transplantation, three organ recipients positive for
antibodies htlv-i detected (two kidney transplants one liver). all
the recipients' serum samples negative time transplantation except
those multiorgan donor. donor's mother born venezuela was
confirmed positive antibodies htlv-i. remaining family members were
negative. htlv-i dna sequences recovered, amplified, sequenced 
the samples htlv-i-positive recipients donor's mother. the
homology htlv-i sequences 100% cases.
conclusions: authors reporting first documented case htlv-i
infection several transplant recipients sharing donor. donor 
infected vertical transmission. htlv-i infection devastating consequences 
for immunocompromised organ recipients. emphasizes need a
systematic survey htlv antibodies potential donors.
