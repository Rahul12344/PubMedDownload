anti-hiv-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnabs) extensively tested
against pesudoviruses diverse strains. generated characterized hiv-1
primary isolates antiretroviral naïve infected indian children, and
determined susceptibility known nabs. 8 isolates belonged to
subtype-c r5 tropic. majority viruses resistant to
neutralization nabs, suggesting bnabs, known efficiently
neutralize pseudoviruses (adult pediatric) different strains, less
effective pediatric primary isolates. interestingly, aiims_329 isolate
displayed high susceptibility neutralization pg9 pg16bnabs, ic50
titer 1.3 0.97μg/ml, suggesting exposure epitope virus.
all isolates except aiims_506 neutralized contemporaneous plasma
antibodies. findings suggest primary isolates, due close resemblance 
to viruses natural infection, used evaluate nabs effective
vaccine candidates children adults.
