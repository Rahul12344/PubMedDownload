embryonal carcinoma cells determined. wild-type py dna permissive for
replication lymphoid cell lines, except one hybridoma line. simply
deleting py pvuii-d region, however, gave py expanded host range, allowing
high-level replication lymphoid mastocytoma cell lines, indicating 
that element tissue-specific negative well positive element.

any cell line tried, including mop-6 cells, even though recombinants with
this enhancer would replicate. thus, observed cooperation and
interference combinations enhancer components py genome
