twenty-five patients high-grade cervical lesions associated hpv16
infection studied time surgical treatment followed after
conization. surgical treatment, following parameters analyzed:
(1) physical status hpv16 dna, (2) viral load, (3) cytological presentation
confirmed histological diagnosis, (4) colposcopy. time of
conization, (5) margin presentation, (6) cone biopsy evaluated. 
stage follow-up (7) physical status hpv16 dna, (8) viral load, (9)
cytological test, (10) colposcopy repeated. correlation 
different parameters examined. significant differences viral loads
were observed integrated episomal forms coexisting
integrated/episomal forms episomal form, statistically
significant differences observed integrated coexisting forms. at
the first stage follow-up, 11 25 patients analyzed (44%) negative to
hpv dna cytology colposcopy tests, 13 25 (52%) hpv16 dna
negative, 17 (68%) cytology negative, 20 (80%) colposcopy negative. the
closing stage, 15 25 subjects (60%) negative three tests, 16 of
the 25 (64%) hpv16 dna negative, 19 (76%) cytology negative, 20
colposcopy negative (80%). observations suggest surgery treated
patients viral clearance closing stage follow-up unrelated to
the hpv dna physical status viral load treatment, was
associated significantly effectiveness surgery treatment, in
particular margin cone presentation.
