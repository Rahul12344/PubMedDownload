tuberculosis (tb) major cause human mortality particularly association
with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). nocardia spp. emerged an
opportunistic infection especially hiv patients. high prevalence tb and
hiv coupled lack definitive laboratory diagnosis nocardia spp. 
could lead misdiagnosed pulmonary tb. study determined prevalence 
pulmonary infections due nocardia spp. mycobacterium tuberculosis in
sputum hiv non-hiv patients suspected pulmonary tuberculosis kath.
a total sixty sputum samples obtained hiv non-hiv patients 
suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. samples examined fluorescence based
ziehl-neelsen staining, culture, pcr methods. prevalence nocardia spp.
and mycobacterium tuberculosis 18.3% 20%, respectively, latter
having highest rate among patients aged 21-40 years (p=0.075). prevalence
of nocardia spp. among hiv patients 90.9% whilst 16.7% patients had
hiv/nocardia spp. coinfection. detection mycobacterium tuberculosis by
fluorescence-based ziehl-neelsen staining, culture, pcr yielded 9 (15%), 11
(18.3%), 12 (20%), respectively. high prevalence nocardiosis
especially hiv patients. pcr better diagnostic method detects both
nocardia spp. mycobacterium tuberculosis incorporated into
routine diagnosis pulmonary infections.
