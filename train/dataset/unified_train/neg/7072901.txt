the micro enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) used specifically
identify bloodmeal sources aedes triseriatus say aedes vexans meigen
collected site endemic la crosse (lac) encephalitis virus. deer the
source 65% ae. triseriatus 94% aedes vexans bloodmeals,
respectively. chipmunks tree squirrels, considered major 
vertebrate amplifying hosts lac virus, sources 8% 16%,
respectively, bloodmeals ae. triseriatus, vector lac virus. 
relatively small proportion vector bloodmeals taken amplifying hosts 
raises doubts significance vertebrate amplification in
perpetutation la crosse virus nature, i.e. whether vertebrate amplification
alone sufficient make shortfall virus infection occurs
during vertical transmission.
