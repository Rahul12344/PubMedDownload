cryptococcus neoformans-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha)
production may lead increased human immunodeficiency virus replication in
patients aids. order identify cryptococcal components are
predominantly responsible stimulating tnf production, various concentrations 
of glucuronoxylomannan (gxm), galactoxylomannan (galxm), mannoproteins (mp), 
alpha(1-3) [corrected] glucan added whole-blood cultures. the
cryptococcal components tested, well whole heat-killed cryptococci, were
capable inducing tnf-alpha release dose-dependent manner. mp were
significantly potent cryptococcal components tested or
heat-killed cryptococci stimulating tnf-alpha production (p < 0.05). gxm, in
contrast, significantly less potent activity either galxm mp 
(p < 0.05). little 0.5 microg mp per ml sufficient produce
moderate significant elevations tnf-alpha release. maximal mp-induced
tnf-alpha levels similar induced salmonella enteritidis
lipopolysaccharide, positive control. experiments using isolated
leukocytes suggested monocytes cell population mainly responsible
for tnf-alpha production, although participation cell types could
not excluded. presence complement-sufficient plasma necessary
requirement tnf-alpha induction gxm, galxm, low doses mp. high mp
concentrations (100 microg/ml) also capable stimulating tnf-alpha
production absence plasma. data indicate soluble products
released c. neoformans capable inducing tnf-alpha secretion human
leukocytes. may clinically relevant, since high concentrations such
products frequently found body fluids aids patients infected with
c. neoformans.
