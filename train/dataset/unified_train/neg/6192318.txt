n1 influenza virus neuraminidases (na) derived avian, swine human virus 
isolates, including genetically related classic strains a/fpv/rostock/34,
a/swine/1976/31, a/pr8/34 a/fm1/47, analysed serologically by
neuraminidase inhibition (ni), inhibition virus release (ivr) competitive 
radio-immunoassays (competitive ria). comparing three tests, competitive ria 
appeared reliable ni ivr quantitative assessment of
antigenic relatedness. together evidence presented others, studies 
indicate host species contributes extent antigenic variation
of nases. contrast nases human viruses antigenic drift occurs
readily, nases animal influenza viruses, birds mammalians, undergo far
fewer antigen changes.
