background: haematologic abnormalities among common manifestations
of advanced human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). specific diagnosis cause, severity and
mechanism cytopenia sought specific treatments or
intervention may indicated correction. study determine
some haematological parameters hiv/aids infected nigerians.
method: one hundred hiv/aids infected previously antiretroviral na√Øve adult
nigerians, aged 18-58 year (males 47 females 53) consisting 88 symptomatic
and 12 asymptomatic patients recruited antiretroviral pilot project in
the haematology department university port harcourt teaching hospital
between june 2002 july 2003 studied. haematological parameters of
hemoglobin, white cell count, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 
differential leucocyte count determined. data analyzed using a
multipurpose statistical package version 9 spss.
result: mean haemoglobin 10.25 +/- 1.97 g/dl (range 6.31-14.2 g/dl),
severe anaemia occurred 80% subjects 20% non-anaemic.
haemoglobin values found positively correlated lymphocyte count (r = .319,
p = 0.01) inversely correlated esr (r = -.343, p = 0.01) neutrophil
count (r = -.343, p = 0.01). red cell morphology variable majority
normochromic normocytic (64%) 36% showing hypochromia and
anisopoikilocytosis. mean total wbc count 4.51 +/- 1.82 x 10(9)/l (range 
0.9-8.2 x 10(9)/l). leucopaenia occurred 10/100 (10%) study population.
total white cell count showed significant inverse correlation lymphocyte
count (r = -.326, p = 0.01). mean neutrophil count 2.32 +/- 1.58 x
10(9)/l (range 0.00-5.48). neutropaenia occurred 24% subjects. neutrophil
count showed significant positive correlation total white cell count (r = 
.314, p = 0.01) negative correlation lymphocyte count (r = -.982, p = 
0.01). striking eosinophilia occurred 3% subjects. mean platelet count 
was 170.07 +/- 49.03 x 10(9)/l (range 72-158 x 268 x 10(9)/l). thrombocytopaenia 
occurred 10/100 (10%) subjects. mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate was
higher healthy africans (mean 78.87 +/- 39.33mm fall/hour (range
0.2-158mm fall/hour).
conclusion: observation study serve guide clinicians
caring hiv patients taking rational decision haematological
complications hiv infection. constitutes evidence need for
routine monitoring haematological parameters hiv/aids infected
africans commencement highly active antiretroviral therapy to
ensure mortality morbidity minimized quality life optimized.
