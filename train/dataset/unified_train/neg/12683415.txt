nasopharyngeal carcinoma, malignancy associated closely epstein-barr virus
(ebv), prevalent among chinese southern china origin. epidemiological
studies indicate high prevalence ebv asia viral isolates having
typical characteristics putative viral oncogene, latent membrane protein 1
(lmp-1), loss xho1 restriction site exon 1 30-bp
deletion exon 3. ebv lmp-1 gene throat washings 120 nasopharyngeal
carcinoma patients 14 healthy individuals analyzed. similar analyses
were also carried 30 12 postnasal space biopsies nasopharyngeal
carcinoma patients healthy individuals, respectively. 30-bp deletion 
detected 20% nasopharyngeal carcinoma throat washes 100% of
nasopharyngeal carcinoma postnasal space biopsies. interestingly, 16% the
nasopharyngeal carcinoma biopsies possessed deleted undeleted
variants, suggestive dual infections. notion dual infections in
nasopharyngeal carcinoma supported coexistence "f" and
"f" (bamh1f region) ebv variants 11% nasopharyngeal carcinoma biopsies.
all throat washes biopsies healthy controls showed the
undeleted variant. loss xho1 restriction site found higher
frequency throat washes biopsies patients nasopharyngeal
carcinoma. discrepancy frequency 30-bp deletion throat 
washes (20%) postnasal space biopsies (100%) indication this
deletion specific viral isolates primary tumour sites.
