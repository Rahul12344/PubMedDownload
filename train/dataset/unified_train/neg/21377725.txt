although sox9 essential chondrogenic differentiation matrix
production, application cartilage tissue engineering rarely
reported. study, chondrogenic effect sox9 bone marrow
mesenchymal stem cells (bmscs) vitro application articular
cartilage repair vivo evaluated. rabbit bmscs transduced with
adenoviral vector containing sox9. toluidine blue, safranin staining and
real-time pcr performed check chondrogenic differentiation. results
showed sox9 could induce chondrogenesis bmscs monolayer on
pga scaffold effectively. rabbit model full-thickness cartilage defects 
was established repaired pga scaffold rabbit bmscs or
without sox9 transduction. he, safranin staining immunohistochemistry 
used assess repair defects complex. better repair, including
more newly-formed cartilage tissue hyaline cartilage-specific extracellular
matrix greater expression several chondrogenesis marker genes were
observed pga scaffold bmscs sox9 transduction, compared that
without transduction. findings defined important role sox9 the
repair cartilage defects vivo provided evidence sox9 the
potential advantage application tissue engineering.
