protease induced ultraviolet rays (uv) extensively investigated in
human cells. plasminogen activator-like protease (pa) activity induced soon
after uv irradiation peripheral lymphocytes derived healthy donors. in
contrast, uv-irradiated lymphocytes derived cockayne syndrome (cs) cases did
not show marked protease inducibility. epstein-barr (eb) virus-transformed cs
lymphoblastoid cells also characterized insusceptibility uv-induction 
of pa. however, cs-derived cells treated human interferon
(huifn) preparation prior irradiation, induction pa activity detected, 
irrespective kind huifn (alpha gamma). results indicate the
possibility abnormal pa metabolism cs-derived cells.
