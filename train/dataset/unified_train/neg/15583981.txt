objective: growth metastasis solid tumors dependent on
angiogenesis. endostatin, c-terminal proteolytic fragment collagen xviii, 
is potent endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor. authors designed topical
antiangiogenic gene therapy recombinant human endostatin adenovirus
(ad-hendo) assessed effects inhibition angiogenesis vitro,
and tumor growth metastasis vivo.
methods: malignant cells (a549) infected ad-hendo. expression of
recombinant protein inhibition cultured human umbilical vein
endothelial investigated. immunodeficient a549 nude mice treated with
intratumoral injection ad-hendo, empty vector ad-control saline (ns).
the dose-response, side effects, serum concentration endostatin were
observed.
results: recombinant endostatin protein detected infected tumor cells 
with different moi ad-hendo inhibitory effect endothelial cells growth
was shown. animal study, volume tumor number pulmonary
metastatic lesions ad-hendo treatment group significantly smaller
than control groups (p<0.05).
conclusion: present findings provide evidence anti-tumor effects of
the endostatin may important use topical
antiangiogenic gene therapy cancer.
