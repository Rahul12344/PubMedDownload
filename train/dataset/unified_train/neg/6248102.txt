heparan sulfates swiss mouse 3t3 sv3t3 cells: o-sulfate difference.

keller kl, keller jm, moy jn.

a difference extent sulfation heparan sulfate isolated from
swiss 3t3 mouse cells swiss 3t3 cells transformed dna virus 
sv40 reported previously. variance manifested different
chromatographic electrophoretic properties. heparan sulfates two
cell types treated nitrous acid conditions gave selective
deaminative cleavage glucosaminyl residues sulfated amino groups order
to define nature difference sulfation further. o-sulfate
containing fragments heparan sulfates compared gel filtration
and ion-exchange chromatography. results showed 3t3 heparan sulfate 
contains 8% o-sulfate sv3t3 heparan sulfate. analysis of
uronic acids revealed types heparan sulfates contain 45% l-iduronic 
acid 55% d-glucuronic acid. observations indicate the
primary difference sulfation 3t3 sv3t3 heparan sulfates lies
in extent o-sulfation.
