a foreign gene coding bacterial enzyme, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase
(cat), introduced primary culture mouse cerebellar primordium
by retrovirus vector harbors neomycin-resistant gene. following
selection gene-transferred cells based neomycin resistance, the
selected cells expressed cat gene product well marker astrocytes,
glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap), examined immunocytochemically. these
cells transplanted adult mouse cerebellum, surviving cells 
were examined immunohistochemically marking anti-cat antibody. the
distribution cat-immunopositive cells coincided of
gfap-immunopositive cells observed serial sections grafted sites 10 days
after transplantation. transplanted cat-immunopositive cells extended
processes exhibited morphological appearance fibrous astrocytes.
migration genetically labeled cells host molecular layer also
observed morphological plasticity differentiated primary cells was
shown according grafted sites. results indicate stable marking 
of cells grafting accomplished retrovirus-mediated introduction 
a foreign gene primary culture, fate behavior the
labeled donor cells analyzed immunohistochemically following
transplantation neural tissue.
