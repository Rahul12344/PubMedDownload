over half adults seropositive jc polyomavirus (jcv), rare
individuals develop progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml), a
demyelinating jcv infection central nervous system. previously, pml was
primarily seen immunosuppressed patients aids certain cancers, 
has recently emerged drug safety issue association diverse 
immunomodulatory therapies. better understand relationship jcv
life cycle pml pathology, studied autopsy brain tissue 70-year-old 
psoriasis patient integrin alpha-l inhibitor efalizumab following ~2
month clinical course pml. sequence analysis lesional brain tissue
identified pml-associated viral mutations regulatory (non-coding control
region) dna, capsid protein vp1, regulatory agnoprotein, well 9
novel mutations capsid protein vp2, indicating rampant viral evolution. nine
samples, including three gross pml lesions normal-appearing adjacent tissues,
were characterized histopathology subject quantitative genomic,
proteomic, molecular localization analyses. observed striking
correlation spatial extent demyelination, axonal destruction, 
dispersion jcv along white matter myelin sheath. observations this
case, well case pml-like disease immunocompromised rhesus
macaque, suggest long-range spread polyomavirus axonal destruction in
pml might involve extracellular association virus white matter
myelin sheath.
