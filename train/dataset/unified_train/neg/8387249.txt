intranasal vaccination newborn pigs pseudorabies virus (prv) strain iowa 
s62/26 tk- gx- bgal+ evaluated determine whether protective immunity could
be stimulated pigs given colostrum immune sows. three litters were
vaccinated (2 litters prv-immune sows 1 born prv-free sow), 2
were left nonvaccinated controls (1 passively immune 1 prv-nonimmune).
pigs challenge-exposed 15 weeks age virulent prv strain
4892. vaccinated pigs suckled nonimmune sows developed serum
prv-neutralizing antibody 15 weeks age die reduction in
weight gain febrile response challenge exposure. vaccinated pigs that
suckled prv-immune sows seronegative prv time challenge
exposure less weight loss fever challenge-exposed control
pigs. intranasal vaccination birth stimulate adequate immunity to
reduce virus shedding challenge exposure vaccinated pigs.
