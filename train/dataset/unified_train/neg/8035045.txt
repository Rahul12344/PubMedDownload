to determine frequency parasitic pathogens human immunodeficiency
virus (hiv)-infected patients developing world setting, 295 stool specimens 
were examined 166 hiv-positive patients (49% aids) são josé
hospital, fortaleza, brazil, september 1990 march 1992. significantly
more patients diarrhea (85%) without (66%) aids aids-related
complex (arc) (p < .005). potential parasitic causes diarrhea, only
cryptosporidium parvum microsporidia significantly associated with
diarrheal disease. infections c. parvum, microsporidia, were
associated rainy season (p < .005). thus, c. parvum microsporidia
are common intestinal parasites associated diarrhea an
hiv-infected population brazil associated advanced hiv disease.
the association c. parvum infections rainy season suggests that
contaminated water may important transmission; however, source of
human microsporidia requires investigation.
