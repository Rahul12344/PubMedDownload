the cellular factor oct-1 selectively recruited, together least one
other cellular protein (cff), multicomponent transcription complex whose
assembly directed herpes simplex virus regulatory protein vmw65 (vp16).
the acidic carboxy terminus vmw65 involved assembly complex
but absolutely required subsequent transcriptional activation. elucidation
of mechanism action vmw65 important understanding of
combinatorial control gene expression pou- homeodomain proteins but
also interaction(s) activation domains regulatory proteins 
components basal transcriptional apparatus. used combination of
limited proteolysis number site-specific proteases immunological
detection demonstrate presence two main surface-exposed regions in
vmw65. mapped sites within amino acids positions 365-370
408/409. site 408/409 indicative flexible exposed linker region
between acidic carboxy-terminal activation domain (residues 430-480) an
n-terminal domain involved complex formation two cellular factors.
the site around residues 365-370 precisely within region results from
this laboratories shown critical complex formation.
furthermore, show site selectively protected proteolysis
after complex assembly. finally, using series overlapping peptide
encompassing region, show eight amino acids, r-e-h-a-y-s-r-a,
from positions 360 367 sufficient inhibit complex formation by
intact vmw65. propose residues contain sufficient information to
selectively bind one cellular partners involved complex assembly and
that residues located physical surface-exposed domain the
protein.
