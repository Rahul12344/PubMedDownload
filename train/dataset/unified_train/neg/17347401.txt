the investigation diseases free-ranging river otters (lontra canadensis) is
a primary conservation priority species; however, little known
about diseases river otters forage marine environments. identify
and better understand pathogens could important marine-foraging river 
otters, wildlife species, domestic animals, humans determine 
proximity human population could factor disease exposure, serum
samples 55 free-ranging marine-foraging river otters tested for
antibodies selected pathogens. thirty-five animals captured prince
william sound, alaska (usa), area low human density, 20 captured
in san juan islands, washington state (usa), area characterized higher 
human density. 40 river otters tested indirect immunofluorescent antibody
test, 17.5% seropositive (titer > =320) toxoplasma gondii. all
positive animals came washington. 35 river otters tested antibodies
to leptospira interrogans using microscopic agglutination test, 10 20
(50%) washington seropositive (titer > =200). none 15 tested 
animals alaska positive. antibodies neospora caninum (n=40),
sarcocystis neurona (n=40), brucella abortus (n=55), avian influenza (n=40),
canine distemper virus (n=55), phocine distemper virus (n=55), dolphin
morbillivirus (n=55), porpoise morbillivirus (n=55), aleutian disease
parvovirus (n=46) detected. identifying exposure t. gondii l.

suggests living proximal higher human density associated
agricultural activities, domestic animals, rodent populations could enhance
river otter exposure pathogens.
