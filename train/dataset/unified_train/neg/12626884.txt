objective: assess relative vitro potency antiviral agents
emtricitabine (ftc), lamivudine (3tc), zidovudine (zdv) peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (pbmcs), monocyte-derived macrophages, mt-4 cells infected 
with hiv-1. design vitro evaluation test compounds m-tropic 
t-tropic laboratory strains hiv-1 clinical hiv-1 isolates from
antiretroviral therapy-naive subjects using pbmcs, monocyte-derived macrophages, 
and mt-4 cells.
methods: standard methods assessing antiviral potency based 50% inhibitory
concentrations using propidium iodide staining host cell dna assess
cytopathic effects measurement hiv-1 reverse transcriptase activity to
assess inhibition viral replication.
results: significant differences potency 3tc ftc 
assays hiv-1(iiib)-infected pbmcs hiv-1(ba-l) -infected monocyte-derived 
macrophages, primary cell types hiv-1 infection vivo. in
agreement earlier reports, ftc approximately fourfold active than
3tc assays transformed t-cell line mt-4 infected hiv-(1iiib),
whereas zdv active ftc. 3tc, ftc, zdv equally active
against panel eight primary hiv-1 isolates antiretroviral-naive
subjects pbmcs. results demonstrate vitro similarity 3tc and
ftc activity primary cells. variability potency depending cell types
and viral strains underscores observation antiviral effects vitro are
not reliable predictors vivo clinical activity.
