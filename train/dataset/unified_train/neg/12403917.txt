human rhinoviruses (hrvs) major cause respiratory infections. we
developed diagnostic method hrvs based reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) vp4-based phylogenetic analysis. set 
primers used rt-pcr human enteroviruses (evs) appeared capable of
amplifying prototype strains hrvs, generated 530-bp
fragment. single exception hrv-87, generated 650-bp fragment, 
observed human evs. vp4 nucleotide sequence hrv-87 showed 97%
nucleotide identity human ev-68, formed monophyletic cluster along
with prototype strain ev-68 human ev-d cluster. hrv-87 showed the
second highest homology (76.8%) ev-70, another member human ev-d, 
a sample 66 human evs 12 hrvs. therefore, hrv-87 reclassified
into cluster containing human ev-68.
