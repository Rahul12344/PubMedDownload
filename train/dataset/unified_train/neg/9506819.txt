genetic subtyping feline immunodeficiency virus (fiv) carried by
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) restriction fragment length polymorphism
(rflp) analysis. 329-base pair fragment fiv gag gene amplified by
nested pcr, digested restriction enzymes, hindiii, pvuii bamhi.
using restriction enzymes, fiv isolates belonging subtypes a, b d,
which classified basis env gene v3-v5 sequence, could be
discriminated. genetic subtypes fiv prevalent japan investigated using
the gag-nested pcr-rflp analysis. 88 fiv-infected cats, pcr products 70
cats showed subtype b rflp pattern (digestion pvuii), nine
cats subtype rflp pattern (digestion bamhi), seven
cats subtype rflp pattern (digestion hindiii). pcr products
of remaining two cats subtype b rflp patterns (digestion 
hindiii pvuii). digestion pattern gag-nested pcr-rflp analysis was
unchanged vivo passages virus. results suggest the
gag-nested pcr-rflp analysis useful simple method fiv genetic
subtyping.
