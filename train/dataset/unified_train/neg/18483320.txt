genital human papillomavirus (hpv) infection primary cause cervical
cancer women. although hpv recombinant l1 protein recently licensed as
an available vaccine, numerous shortcomings. new vaccination strategies
should considered. enable design prophylactic therapeutic
low-cost vaccine candidate, chimeric hpv16 l1deltac34e7n1-60 capsomeres were
produced escherichia coli. immune characteristics potential
prophylactic therapeutic effects capsomeres examined c57bl/6
mice. following protein purification renaturation, majority the
recombinant chimeric proteins (l1deltac34e7n1-60) assembled capsomeres.
these capsomeres able induce conformational neutralizing antibodies
against hpv virus-like particles trigger cell-mediated specific immune
responses l1 e7 peptides. vivo tumor challenge assays showed
that mice immunized capsomeres protected challenge with
both c3 tc-1 tumor cells. furthermore, vivo tumor rejection assays showed 
that capsomeres therapeutic efficacy mice following inoculation c3
and tc-1 tumor cells. chimeric capsomeres capable preventing and
eliminating hpv16 infection. therefore, study provided economical
vaccine candidate.
