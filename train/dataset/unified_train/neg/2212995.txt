this communication reports physical map mycoplasma virus l3 (mv-l3) dna
derived restriction patterns obtained digestion seven different
restriction endonucleases. length restriction map 36,200 bp in
contrast contour length native mv-l3 dna molecules 39,400 bp
as determined electron microscopy. difference length 3,200 bp
(corresponding 8.1% native viral dna contour length) explained by
terminal redundancy. possible clone fragments particular
restriction patterns escherichia coli vector pat153, indication of
circular permutation within population mv-l3 dna. however clear evidence has
been obtained molar ratios fragments hybridization
experiments. suppose viral dna packaged concatemeric precursor 
molecule starting specific site called pac.
