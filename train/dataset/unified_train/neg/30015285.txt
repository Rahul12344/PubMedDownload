background: outbreaks fever unknown origin start nonspecific symptoms 
and case definition slowly developed adapted, therefore, identifying 
the causative agent crucial ensure suitable treatment control measures.
as alternative method polymerase chain reaction molecular diagnostics
diagnostic, metagenomics applied identify pathogen responsible 
the outbreak sequencing nucleic acids present sample extract.
sequencing data obtained identify new variants known agents.
objectives: develop rapid field applicable protocol allow the
identification causative agent outbreak.
study design: explored sequencing protocol relying multiple displacement 
isothermal amplification nanopore sequencing order allow the
identification causative agent sample. develop procedure, a
mock sample consisting supernatant zika virus tissue culture used.
results: procedure took seven hours including sample preparation and
data analysis using offline blast search. total, 63,678 sequence files
covering around 10,000 bases extracted. blast search revealed presence
of zika virus.
conclusion: conclusion, protocol potential point need
sequencing identify rna viruses. whole procedure operated a
suitcase laboratory. however, procedure cooling chain dependent the
cost per sequencing run still high.
