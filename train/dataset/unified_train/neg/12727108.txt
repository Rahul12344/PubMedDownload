clinical translation gene-based therapies arthritis could accelerated
by vectors capable efficient intra-articular gene delivery long-term
transgene expression. previously, shown lentiviral vectors transduce
rat synovium efficiently vivo. here, evaluated functional capacity of
transgene expression provided lentiviral-mediated gene delivery joint. 
to this, measured ability lentiviral vector containing cdna
for human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (lv-hil-1ra) suppress
intra-articular responses il-1beta. groups rats injected one knee
with 5 x 10(7) infectious units lv-il-1ra. 24 h, range doses of
fibroblasts (3 x 10(3), 10(4), 3 x 10(4), 10(5) cells) genetically modified to
overexpress il-1beta injected knees. intra-articular delivery of
lv-hil-1ra strongly prevented swelling treated knees, even those
receiving greatest dose il-1beta(+) cells. cellular infiltration,
cartilage erosion, invasiveness inflamed synovium effectively
prevented lv-hil-1ra-treated knees significantly inhibited in
contralateral joints. beneficial effects also observed systemically the
lentivirus-treated animals. interestingly, intra-articular expression the
il-1ra transgene found increase relation number il-1beta(+)
cells injected. experiments using gfp suggest due the
proliferation cells, stably modified integrative lentivirus, in
response inflammatory stimulation.
