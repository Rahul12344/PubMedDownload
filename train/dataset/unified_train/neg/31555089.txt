as one common causes mortality disability, traumatic brain
injury (tbi) huge psychological economic burden patients, families,
and societies worldwide. neuroinflammation reduction may favorable option to
alleviate secondary brain injuries ameliorate outcome tbi. the
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat pyrin
domain-containing 3 (nlrp3) inflammasome, shown involved tbi.
nima-related kinase 7 (nek7) verified essential mediator nlrp3 
inflammasome activation recruited upstream formation of
inflammasomes response nlrp3 activators. however, underlying mechanism 
by nek7 operates post-tbi remains undefined. study, performed
both vivo vitro experiments. using vivo mouse tbi model, mice
were administered intracerebroventricular injection nek7-shrna virus. for
the vitro analysis, primary cortical neurons nek7-shrna stimulated
with lipopolysaccharide (lps)/atp potassium (k+). evaluated effects 
nek7 knock-down neurological deficits, nlrp3 inflammasomes, caspase-1
activation, neuronal injury. 0-168 h post-tbi period vivo, nek7
and nlrp3 inflammasome activation increased appeared a
time-dependent manner. well pyroptosis-related markers, caspase-1
activation (p20) interleukin-1β (il-1β) activation (p17) up-regulated.
nek7 down-regulation attenuated neurological deficits, nlrp3 inflammasomes,
caspase-1 activation, neuronal injury. phenomena observed
during vitro experiments. furthermore, nek7 knock-down suppressed nlrp3
inflammasome activation pyroptosis, triggered k+ efflux, and
the lps + atp-triggered nek7-nlrp3 complex reversed primary cortical
neurons placed 50 mm k+ medium. collectively, data demonstrated nek7,
as modulator, regulates nlrp3 inflammasomes downstream neuroinflammation in
response k+ efflux, nek7-nlrp3 assembly, pro-caspase-1 recruitment,
caspase-1 activation, pyroptosis nerve injuries, post-tbi. nek7 may a
potential therapeutic target attenuating neuroinflammation nerve injury
post-tbi.
