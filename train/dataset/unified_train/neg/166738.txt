technique. lesions observed 12 nonaborted foesuses four 
these immunoglobulins demonstrated. addition, two nonaborted
foetuses immunoglobulins absence observed lesions. lesions were
observed 48 aborted foetuses immunoglobulins detected 22 of
these. etiological diagnosis arrived 24 50 aborted foetuses. 
the tissues frequently observed lesions diagnostic significance
were eyelid, intestine, liver, lung placenta. intestinal lesions were
observed several foetuses association variety agents including
infectious bovine rhinotracheitis. foetuses diagnosed aborting of
