an effective vaccine enteric bovine coronavirus (bcv) must able to
induce mucosal immunity. recently described construction recombinant
human adenovirus type 5 (had5) carrying bcv haemagglutinin-esterase (he) gene
in early transcription region 3 adenovirus genome. study, we
examined induction systemic mucosal immune responses had5
vector carrying bcv gene (adbche) following intranasal enteric
immunization cotton rats. regardless route administration, mucosal
immunization adbche induced significant levels anti-he igg antibodies 
serum. addition, following intranasal immunization adbche, significant
levels anti-he iga antibodies found lung washes immunized cotton
rats. furthermore, specific anti-he antibodies sera mucosal secretions
efficiently neutralized bcv infectivity vitro. t-cell proliferation and
cell-mediated cytotoxic responses bcv elicited spleen 
of intranasally immunized animals. results demonstrate mucosal
immunization adbche capable inducing systemic mucosal
immunity bcv he. immune responses may important protecting
animals bcv infection.
