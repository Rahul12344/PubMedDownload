the rotavirus nonstructural protein nsp2 self-assembles stable octameric
structures possess nonspecific affinity single-stranded (ss)rna and
rna-rna helix-destabilizing ntpase activities. furthermore, nsp2 a
component replication intermediates replicase activity plays a
critical role packaging replication segmented dsrna genome of
rotavirus. better understand function protein genome
replication, examined effect purified recombinant nsp2 the
synthesis dsrna open core replication system. results showed that
nsp2 inhibited synthesis dsrna viral mrna vitro, a
concentration-dependent manner. inhibition overcome adding increasing 
amounts viral mrna nonviral ssrna system, indicating the
inhibition mediated nonspecific rna-binding activity nsp2. 
analysis revealed nsp2 interfered ability open core
proteins, gtp, viral mrna form initiation complex (-) strand
synthesis. additional experiments indicated nsp2 perturb recognition
of viral mrna viral rna polymerase vp1, rather interfered the
function vp2, protein essential (-) strand initiation dsrna 
synthesis forms = 1 lattice virion core. contrast to
initiation, nsp2 inhibit (-) strand elongation. collectively, the
findings provide evidence temporal order interaction rna-binding
proteins viral mrna crucial factor impacting formation of
replication intermediates.
