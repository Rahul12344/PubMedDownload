blood collected immediately delivery 983 women. anti-cmv igg and
igm antibodies determined using elisa; cmv dna detected using nested
pcr, viral load calculated using real-time pcr. cmv concentration in
samples categorized low viral load ≤10(3) copies/µl, intermediate
when viral load = 10(3)-10(4) copies/µl, high viral load >10(4) 
copies/µl. cord blood serology outcome compared cord blood pcr, cord
blood viral load, maternal urine pcr viral load analyses.
results: serology showed 983 cord blood samples, 89 (9%) were
positive anti-cmv igm antibodies; pcr test showed 44 (4.5%) contained cmv
dna, high viral load all. maternal urine pcr showed 9
(10.11%) women cmv dna, high viral load 7 (78%). kappa
test measures agreement showed reasonable agreement (0.45) cord 
blood pcr urine pcr.
