gene transfer vectors based replication-defective human parvovirus,
adeno-associated virus type 2 (aav-2), viable candidates vivo ex
vivo human use. however, widespread testing aav vectors limited by
difficulties generating pure, high-titer vector stocks fully
characterized. address issues, developed single-step
purification scheme using heparin affinity chromatography. recovery the
crude lysate starting material exceeds 70%, end product raav vector is
highly purified appears free adenovirus cellular contaminates.
importantly, purified vectors retain predicted vivo biologic activity.
concurrently, developed simple rapid approaches vector
quantification using real-time pcr. new methods, combined use of
stable producer cell lines raav production, make commercial production of
raav vectors human use truly viable pragmatic.
