our study attempts establish relationship telomerase activity 
allelic imbalance (ai) chromosomes 3p 6 high-risk hpv-containing
cervical lesions. chromosomes implicated previously telomerase
regulation hpv containing immortalized cells cervical cancer cells.
allelotyping telomerase analysis carried 28 high-grade cervical
lesions (cin iii: n = 20; cervical carcinomas: n = 8), using 23 microsatellite
markers 3p, 6p 6q. clear telomerase activity found 17 28 lesions
(61%). allelic imbalance frequency 6q14-22 significantly higher lesions
with detectable telomerase activity, compared lesions without telomerase
activity (p = 0.02). association found telomerase activity ai 
at remaining regions studied 3p chromosome 6. addition, in
telomerase positive passages hpv 16 immortalized cell line fk16a, shown
recently responsive chromosome 6 mediated telomerase repression, ai 
found overlapping region 6q14-27. data suggest 6q14-22 may
contain 1 genes involved telomerase deregulation immortalization
during cervical carcinogenesis.
