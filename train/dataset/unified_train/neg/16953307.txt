in attempt define virological profile hbv hcv co-infection, we
analysed viral load, infecting genotype, mutational pattern of
the hbv pre-core region (pre-c), involved viral encapsidation dna
replication. eighty-six patients studied: 32 serological hbv/hcv-1b
co-infection (group bc), 32 infected hbv alone (group b), 22 hcv-1b
alone (group c). sequence analysis hbv pre-s pre-c regions identified 
genotypes mutational patterns. hbv viral load significantly lower 
group bc group b (p < 0.001), distribution hbv pre-c mutations
showed higher prevalence wild type concomitant infection the
control group (p < 0.006). predominant hbv infecting strain genotype in
both bc (96%) b (87%) groups. difference observed hcv viremia
levels two groups, whereas hbv/hcv infection, low levels of
circulating hbv closely associated low degree variability of
pre-c domain (p = 0.005). conclusion, hbv/hcv infection, virological
pattern characterised dominance hcv associated lower hbv
replication capacity decreased emergence hbv pre-c variants.
