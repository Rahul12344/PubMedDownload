irf-3 member interferon regulatory factors (irfs) plays a
principal role induction interferon-beta (ifn-beta) virus infection.
virus infection results phosphorylation irf-3 ikappab kinase epsilon
and tank-binding kinase 1, leading dimerization association the
coactivators creb-binding protein/p300. irf-3 holocomplex translocates the
nucleus, induces ifn-beta. present study, examined the
molecular mechanism irf-3 activation. using bacterial two-hybrid screening, we
isolated molecules interact irf-3. one cyclophilin b, a
member immunophilins cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity. 
a gst pull-down assay suggested one autoinhibition domains irf-3
and peptidyl-prolyl isomerase domain cyclophilin b required the
binding. knockdown cyclophilin b expression rna interference resulted 
the suppression virus-induced irf-3 phosphorylation, leading inhibition
of subsequent dimerization, association creb-binding protein, binding to
the target dna element, induction ifn-beta. findings indicate that
cyclophilin b plays critical role irf-3 activation.
