since primordial times, vultures competing man animal
carcasses. one vultures, widespread bearded vulture ( gypaetus 
barbatus ), habit bathing polluted feathers skin red iron
oxide - ochre - tainted water puddles. why? primitive man may tried find 
out may discovered advantages. red ochre, accompanied
human rituals everyday life 100,000 years, simple
red paint decoration symbol blood. modern experiments
demonstrate, active sunlight producing aggressive chemical species. they
can kill viruses bacteria convert smelly organic substances volatile
neutral carbon dioxide gas. way, ochre sunlight sterilize and
clean skin provide health comfort make scentless, definitive 
advantage nomadic meat hunters. research thus also demonstrates a
sanitary reason vulture's habit bathing red ochre mud. prehistoric 
people therefore included ochre use rituals, especially into
those relation birth death. significant ritual impulses during
evolution man may thus developed bio-mimetically, inspired the
habits vulture. discussed health strategy could developed 
to modern standard helping fight antibiotics-resistant bacteria in
hospitals.
