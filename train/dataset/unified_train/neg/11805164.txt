pigtailed macaques infected virulent human immunodeficiency virus-2
(hiv-2) strain develop renal thrombotic microangiopathy (tma), which
morphologically resembles aspects human hiv-associated tma. apoptotic cell
death microvascular endothelial cells might pathogenetic clue this
disease. defining pattern cellular injury model,
serial kidney sections 58 macaques infected hiv-2 7 uninfected
controls studied routine microscopy, terminal
deoxynucleotidyl-transferase-mediated dutp nick-end labeling (tunel),
4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, immunohistochemistry for
single-stranded dna, p53, wilms' tumor suppressor gene-1 peptide product,
caspase-3, proliferation marker ki67. selected cases further
evaluated situ end labeling transmission electron microscopy. kidneys
of 13 hiv-2-infected animals contained pattern cellular injury, was
characterized (1) nuclear swelling ultrastructural morphology
different apoptotic nuclei, (2) sharply demarcated areas renal cells with
chromatin nicks (tunel positive) single-stranded dna, (3) absence an
inflammatory proliferative response, (4) upregulation p53 loss at
least one cellular differentiation marker (wilms' tumor suppressor gene-1), (5) a
tight correlation diagnosis renal tma, (6) contrast between
profound changes renal cellular morphology apparently unaffected
clinical condition host. pattern injury, shares some
features apoptotic oncotic necrosis, might involved the
pathogenesis hiv-associated renal tma model.
