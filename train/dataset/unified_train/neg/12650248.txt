percentage wssv-positive broodstock pl. broodstock, fluctuation
pattern similar year, low percentage (0 6%) january to
may higher percentage (6 18%) rest year, peak from
september november. fluctuation pattern pl similar offset with
peaks troughs occurring approximately 2 mo broodstock.
the peak percentages broodstock-positive samples roughly constant from
year year, pl decreased progressively magnitude 1998 
2000. examination small number hatcheries 2000 revealed the
