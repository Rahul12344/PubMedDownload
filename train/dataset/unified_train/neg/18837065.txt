background: chemical capsid modification adenovirus vectors synthetic
polymers shown aid overcoming typical barriers adenovirus
vector-mediated gene transfer. carbohydrate-based polymers covalent
modification adenovirus vectors largely neglected far. we
utilized reductive amination strategy generate novel class of
adenovirus-based glycovectors mannan derivative.
methods: reductive amination covalently couple polysaccharides capsid
surface adenovirus serotype 5-based vectors investigated utilizing an
oxidized derivative mannan. biochemical physical characterization of
mannanylated vectors, performance analysed vitro cell lines and
primary human cells, vivo mice local systemic vector
injection.
results: describe successful modification adenovirus vectors large
polysaccharides reductive amination. particles efficiently modified, 
physically intact and, importantly, detargeted natural coxsackie and
adenovirus receptor/integrin pathway vitro. addition, exhibited
significantly decreased transduction muscle local delivery liver 
after systemic delivery mice. however, despite modification 60% of
capsid surface amino groups, mannanylated particles unable evade
neutralizing anti-ad5 antibodies.
conclusions: mannanylated vectors paradigm novel class of
glycoviruses modified large polysaccharides. vector promiscuity one of
the important hurdles ad-mediated gene transfer could significantly
decreased vivo, whereas mannanylated vectors unable escape from
anti-adenovirus antibodies. studies provide detailed analysis of
mannan-modified ad vectors suggest improvements novel class 
of glycovectors.
