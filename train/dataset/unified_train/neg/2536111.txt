the complete dna sequence human polyomavirus virus (asv) presented. 
although asv differentiated antigenically human
polyomaviruses (bk jc viruses), shares 94.9% homology nucleotide
level dunlop strain bk virus. differences found asv relative bk
virus include absence tandem repeats regulatory region, the
deletion 32 nucleotides late mrna leader region (altering the
initiation codon agnoprotein), presence cluster base pair
substitutions within coding region major capsid protein, vp1, 
absence 4 amino acids carboxy-terminal region early protein, t
antigen. 43 nucleotides deleted dunlop strain bk virus relative 
the gardner prototype strain bk virus present asv. possible reasons for
the distinct antigenicity asv capsid, given high degree nucleotide 
homology bk virus, discussed. reflect high degree sequence
homology asv bk virus, suggest asv renamed bkv(as).
