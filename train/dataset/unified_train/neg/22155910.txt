background: alternatives available stavudine-containing paediatric
fixed-dose combination (fdc) tablets rapidly needed due concerns regarding
the cumulative toxicity long-term stavudine exposure. report the
bioavailability short-term safety novel paediatric fdc tablet of
zidovudine (zdv)/lamivudine (3tc)/nevirapine (nvp; 30/15/28 mg) hiv-infected
children.
methods: phase i/ii open-label pharmacokinetic study, 42 children
weighing 6-30 kg treated nvp-based haart ≥4 weeks randomized to
receive fdc tablets (gpo-vir z30) liquid formulations. dosing was
weight-based. intensive 12-h blood sampling performed 2 weeks; subjects
then crossed-over alternate formulation equal doses sampling
repeated 2 weeks later. pharmacokinetic parameters determined by
non-compartmental analysis. buccal-swab samples collected cytochrome
p450 (cyp)2b6 polymorphism analysis.
results: fdc tablet, geometric mean (90% ci) area curve
(auc) zdv, 3tc nvp 1.58 (1.49-1.68), 7.78 (7.38-8.19) 68.88
(62.13-76.36) μg•h/ml, respectively. rules nvp therapeutic inadequacy were
defined priori, despite lower nvp exposure tablet (p<0.001), the
levels remained therapeutically adequate. zdv auc similar between
formulations. 3tc exposure significantly higher tablet but
comparable historical data adults children taking branded tablets.
while receiving tablet, nvp auc children cyp2b 516 gg (45%), gt (45%)
and tt (10%) genotypes 67.0, 74.5 106.4 μg•h/ml, respectively (p=0.04).
conclusions: disparities drug exposure formulations observed;
however, fdc tablet delivered therapeutically adequate exposures drug
and could well play important role simplifying antiretroviral treatment for
children.
