background: human respiratory syncytial virus (hrsv) important cause of
acute respiratory infection (ari) mortality ≥60 years old population
around world. aim study determine frequency and
circulating genotypes hrsv iranian patients ≥ 60 years old.
methods: cross-sectional molecular epidemiology study, examined the
c-terminal located hypervariable domain g glycoprotein hrsv throat swabs
from tehran, hormozgan, boushehr, west azarbayjan, ghom alborz provinces of
iran addressed national influenza center october 2013 and
march 2015. two consecutive years, total 225 samples collected 
from patients older 60 years tested using rt hemi-nested pcr and
sequencing acquired sequences phylogenetically analyzed.
results: sixteen 225 samples (7.1%) yielded positive result. among the
positive samples, 13 cases (81%) pertained antigenic group remaining
3 cases (19%) belonged group b. three genotypes including ga1, ga2 ba9
were identified first year survey whereas second year, 
ga1 ga2 genotypes detected.
conclusion: study indicates hrsv genotypes b antigenic
groups discovered pediatric population previously, circulating 
among iranian ≥60 years old population.
