intestinal mucosa represents important portal entry hiv site of
virus reservoir active replication. recently, hiv patients, early
depletion intestinal lamina propria lymphocytes (lpt) described.
hiv-1 gp120 demonstrated promote apoptosis noninfected isolated
peripheral blood cells, therefore investigated whether gpl20 modulates
apoptosis normal human intestinal lamina propria cells. purified cells
were obtained immunomagnetic negative selection human lamina propria
mononuclear cells isolated surgical specimens enzymatic procedure. cells 
were incubated without recombinant gpl20 (10 microg/ml) cultured
either absence stimulus presence plate-bound anti-cd3 
ab (okt3) soluble anti-cd2 ab (t11(2) + t11[3]). apoptosis assessed by
flow cytometric analysis propidium iodide staining. demonstrated that
preincubation normal lpt cells hiv-1 gpl20 accelerates apoptosis
observed cd2-pathway stimulation lpt cells. process mediated by
fas/fas ligand interaction related increased induction fas ligand
mrna gpl20. therefore hiv-1 gp120 could contribute depletion of
noninfected lpt cells inducing premature cell death.
