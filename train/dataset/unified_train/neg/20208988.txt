purpose: determine effectiveness multigene-based anti-angiogenic gene
therapies experimental murine corneal neovascularization (corneal nv).
methods: recombinant retroviral vectors encoding murine endostatin (mendo),
murine-soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (msflk-1), or
murine-soluble tie2 (mstie2) constructed packaged pt67 cells. viral
titers determined infection nih3t3 cells. expressions mendo,
msflk-1, mstie2 confirmed reverse transcription pcr. the
3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl-2,5-diphenyl-2h-tetrazolium bromide (mtt) assay was
used estimate effect mendo, msflk-1, mstie2 proliferation 
human umbilical vein endothelial cells, scarification test used to
measure migration cells. seventy c57bl/6 mice subjected the
induction chemical-burn corneal nv tested efficacy gene therapy.
gene therapy performed subconjunctival injection viral preparations and
its effect evaluated scoring corneal nv.
results: recombinant virus-producing cell lines expressing mendo, msflk-1,
and mstie2 constructed successfully. overexpression putative
anti-angiogenic proteins inhibited proliferation migration human
umbilical vein endothelial cells vitro. murine corneal nv model,
subconjunctival injection retroviral particles mendo msflk-1 showed
the significant inhibition corneal nv.
conclusions: gene therapy recombinant retroviral vector-hosted mendo and
msflk-1 gene effectively inhibited corneal nv induced alkaline burn. the
combination multiple anti-angiogenic genes might necessary effective
therapy corneal nv, although pathways makes potential target
for treatment disease.
