a 9-year-old gelding presented approximately 100 papillomas covered
about 75% distal penis. biopsy performed, histology showed
evidence viral cytopathic change koilocytosis. polymerase chain reaction
using dna extracted biopsied tissue amplified equine papillomavirus type 2
(ecpv-2) dna sequences. sixteen months later, horse re-examined the
appearance papillomas unchanged. equine papillomavirus type 2 dna
sequences amplified biopsied tissue swabs penis. 
papillomavirus localized lesions immunohistochemistry situ
hybridization. examination 2 years initial presentation revealed 
detectable change appearance penis. large number papillomas 
and failure regress extended period support clinical
classification papillomatosis. authors' knowledge, first
report papillomatosis equine penis. novel clinical manifestation
suggests persistent ecpv-2 infection possible horses. is
evidence ecpv-2 may promote development equine penile squamous cell
carcinoma, understanding natural history ecpv-2 infections may be
important preventing equine penile neoplasia.
