three independently selected spontaneous thymidine kinase-negative mutants
(tk-phenotype) recombinant escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene
(lacz+ phenotype) inserted viral thymidine kinase gene (tk) derived
from plaque-cloned isolate k-1 ectromelia virus strain (tk+ phenotype).
dramatically decreased virulence tk- variants observed routes of
mouse inoculation. kinetics tk+ tk- variants various target organs 
indicated significant decrease production dissemination tk- mutants
and recombinant organs mice. spleen liver intranasally or
intracerebrally infected mice tk- virus detected entire period
of observation. analysis organs homogenates mice intranasally infected a
mixture recombinant tk-lacz+ phenotype parental isolate tk+lacz-
phenotype monolayers tk- cells indicated white plaques
(lacz-) tk+ phenotype appeared liver spleen homogenates. thus, 
the mouse acts live filter much efficiently selective
systems. ultrastructural studies showed viral damage animals infected 
tk- variants far less observed mice, infected wild type 
ectromelia virus pathological lessions slight reversible.
replication ectromelia virus tk- variants blocked viroplasma stage 
in cells high level differentiation contrast tk+ variants. most
likely, restriction target cells assortment general reason of
reduced virulence case tk-gene inactivation.
