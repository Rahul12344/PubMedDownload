hiv inactivation bone allograft.

mellonig jt, prewett ab, moyer mp.

the use exclusionary techniques procurement donors bone
allografts greatly reduces chances disease transmission. furthermore,
treatment hiv either chemical agents strong acids effectively
inactivate aids virus. data taken indirect proof risk
of obtaining aids freeze-dried bone allograft highly remote. the
purpose study obtain direct evidence processing a
demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft would render allograft safe for
human use. part i, human cortical bone obtained cadaveric source
and tested free hiv contamination. bone spiked 5.26 x 10(9)
viral particles. corresponded 148 micrograms total viral protein. in
part ii, cortical bone procured donor died aids. parts 
i ii, cortical bone ground yield particle sizes 90 500
microns. test samples treated virucidal agent demineralized in
hcl. control samples left untreated. samples cocultivated with
stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes assayed p24 core protein, reverse
transcriptase, viral gag gene polymerase chain reaction (pcr). part i, 
the hiv spiking experiment, untreated virus infected particulate bone was
positive hiv replication. treated samples negative assayed hiv.
bone samples part ii, hiv infected bone, positive pcr. replication 
viable hiv could demonstrated treatment. concluded that
demineralization treatment virucidal agent inactivates hiv spiked
and infected bone.
