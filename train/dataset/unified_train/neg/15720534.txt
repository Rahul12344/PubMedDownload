alpha-interferon (ifn) lamivudine monotherapy ineffective treating
chronic hbeag positive patients high viral load low alanine
aminotransferase (alt) levels. investigated whether priming lamivudine
treatment might enhance antiviral immunostimulant action of
lamivudine/ifn combination young tolerant patients. eleven chronic hbeag
positive patients received: 100 mg/day lamivudine 3 months followed ifn 5 
mu/m2/tiw lamivudine 100 mg/day 6 months lamivudine alone 100
mg/day 9 months. quantitative hepatitis b virus (hbv)-dna evaluated
during treatment core-promoter, precore polymerase hbv mutants were
detected direct sequencing end therapy. serum hbv-dna levels dropped
during lamivudine monotherapy combination ifn. ifn withdrawal, 
viraemia transiently increased high levels five 11 (45%) patients who
showed rt m204v/i lamivudine mutant resistant. two patients cleared hbeag without
anti-hbe seroconversion. one patient presented core-promoter (a1762t/g1764a) 
precore stop codon mutations. hence, three-phase sequential combined
lamivudine/ifn treatment reduced hbv-dna serum level, lead hbeag
and hbv-dna clearance highly viraemic, normal alt patients.
lamivudine/ifn combination prevent emergence ymdd lamivudine
resistance. new schedules antiviral treatments must evaluated this
population risk disease progression.
