background: clinical studies involving healthy volunteer human challenge
model, valid reliable measure assess evolution patient-reported
symptom type severity following viral exposure necessary. study
examines use influenza patient-reported outcome (flu-pro) diary a
standardized measure symptom severity healthy volunteer human challenge
model.
methods: healthy adults admitted nih clinical center (day - 1) underwent a
9-day inpatient quarantine intranasal challenge wild-type influenza 
a/h1n1pdm virus (day 0). participants completed 32-item flu-pro diary twice
daily 14 days assess presence, severity, duration symptoms across
six body systems. secondary analyses included descriptive statistics examine
flu-pro scores course illness analysis variance compare
scores day 3 post-challenge presence viral shedding, pre-challenge
hemagglutinin neuraminidase inhibition (hai nai) titers.
results: one subject (99%), lost follow-up, completed twice
daily flu-pro diaries study assessment days. flu-pro demonstrated 61 
of 65 subjects reported symptoms (days: median 5, mean 6 ± 7), 37 (61%)
had viral shedding. pre-challenge, 39 (64%) 10 (16%) subjects low
(< 1:40) hai nai titers, respectively. nose, throat, body, and
gastrointestinal (gi) symptoms reached peak intensity day 3, followed by
chest/respiratory eye symptoms day 4. subjects viral shedding had
higher mean flu-pro scores compared without, except eye gi
domains (p <0.05). mean flu-pro scores significantly higher subjects
with low nai titer (p <0.05) across domains. significant differences 
observed hai titer groups. flu-pro scores low hai-low nai group
(n = 10) significantly higher (more severe) two groups
(p < 0.05) (high hai-high nai (n = 22), low hai-high nai (n = 29)).
conclusions: flu-pro high adherence low respondent burden. 
used track symptom onset, intensity, duration, recovery influenza
infection clinical research. human challenge study, scores were
responsive change distinguished known clinical subgroups.
