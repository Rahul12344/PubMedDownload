the human t-cell leukemia virus (htlv) types ii two nonstructural
genes encoded overlapping reading frames. one genes, known
as tax, shown encode protein responsible enhanced transcription
(transactivation) viral long terminal repeats (ltrs). genetic evidence
indicates second nonstructural gene htlv-ii, designated rex,
acts trans modulate tax gene-mediated transactivation a
concentration-dependent fashion. rex gene may regulate process of
transactivation viral life cycle.
