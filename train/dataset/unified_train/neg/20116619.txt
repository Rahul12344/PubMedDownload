atazanavir (atv) protease inhibitor (pi) main qualities,
compared pi dosing convenience, good tolerability excellent
metabolic profile. characteristics makes like nonnucleoside 
a pi, increased genetic barrier common pi. indicated in
initial treatment, simplification treatment change due toxicity in
first line rescue treatment. administering atv boosted ritonavir
(300/100 mg/d) approved europe clinical situations. naïve
patients combined practically nucleoside analogue pairs 
and shown effective lopinavir/ritonavir even efavirenz. in
the usa, indication approved almost 5 years atv become 
the prescribed pi, emea approved year. atv an
optimal drug replace antiretrovirals simplification strategies or
changes due toxicity. several studies shown that, patients
with good virological control, lpv/r another pi, therapeutic
efficacy maintained, excellent tolerance improved lipid
profile, decreasing cardiovascular risk. strategy widely used 
spain. scenario patients could benefit non-boosted atv
treatment (400 mg/d). atv effective attractive option first
line rescue treatments virus shows little resistance pi, as
its simplicity tolerability improve problems compliance, main
