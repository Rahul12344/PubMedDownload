most cd4+ lymphocytes lymph nodes asymptomatic hiv-1-infected
individuals aids patients nonproductively latently infected. not
clear cells come infection resting lymphocytes results
in abortive infection infection activated lymphocytes results in
productive infection. frequency mechanisms underlying nonproductive or
latent hiv infections normal cd4+ lymphocytes largely remain unexplored, and
because hiv latency principally studied latently infected cell clones
of established cell lines, even clear often type infection 
occurs cell lines. demonstrate herein chronic hiv replication in
populations normal phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood
cd4(+)-enriched lymphocytes, well established t-cell line (cem),
gradually shuts vast majority cells. nonproducing cells in
these cultures still harbored hiv provirus, hiv could reactivated cem
cells treatment phorbol ester, showing latent infection.
thus, hiv's life cycle probably considered consisting two phases 
an acute exponential rise production virus progeny levels some
peak, followed gradual decline progeny production chronic
phase leading viral latency. temporal analyses steady-state levels of
viral mrnas populations chronically infected cem cells virus production 
declined revealed two mechanisms hiv latency previously been
described om-10.1 u1 ach-2 latently infected cell clones (i.e.,
apparent overall shutdown hiv transcription "blocked early-stage latency" 
involving enhanced splicing viral pre-mrnas) however, mechanism was
employed, well rate shutdown, depended virus strain.
