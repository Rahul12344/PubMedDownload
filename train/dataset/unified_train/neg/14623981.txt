human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), ubiquitous herpesvirus, causes lifelong
subclinical infection healthy adults leads significant morbidity and
mortality neonates immunocompromised individuals. ability grow in
different cell types responsible hcmv-associated diseases, including
mental retardation retinitis, vascular disorders. globally assess
viral gene function replication cells, determined genomic sequence 
of bacterial artificial chromosome (bac)-based clone hcmv towne strain and
used information delete 162 unique orfs generate a
collection viral mutants. growth mutants different cultured
cells examined systematically investigate necessity orf for
replication. results showed 45 orfs essential viral replication 
in fibroblasts 117 nonessential. genes found required for
viral replication retinal pigment epithelial cells microvascular
endothelial cells, fibroblasts, indicating role tropism
factors. interestingly, several viral mutants grew 10- 500-fold better than
the parental strain different cell types, suggesting deleted orfs
encode replication temperance repressing functions. thus, hcmv encodes
supportive suppressive growth regulators optimizing replication in
human fibroblasts, epithelial, endothelial cells. suppression viral
replication virus-encoded temperance factors represents novel mechanism 
regulating growth animal virus, may contribute hcmv's optimal
infection different tissues successful proliferation among human
population.
