streptococcus pneumoniae infection indicated serologically 84 (19%) 449
children hospitalized middle lower respiratory tract infection.
pneumococcal antigen detected acute serum 28 patients, acute
urine 2. antibody response type-specific capsular polysaccharides
of s. pneumoniae indicated 27 patients protein antigen,
pneumolysin, 25 patients, c-polysaccharide 10 patients. the
observations mentioned suggest serological test pneumococcal 
etiology insensitive, get optimal result, large panel of
pneumococcal antigen antibody assays must used. pneumococcal infection
could indicated serologically although focus infection, as
pneumonia acute otitis media, laboratory evidence bacterial infection
as elevated values c-reactive protein concentration, erythrocyte sedimentation
rate white blood cell count present. particularly antibody responses to
pneumococcal pneumolysin present children without pneumonia acute
otitis media. results point nonspecific parameter used for
the selection patients probable pneumococcal etiology among children with
respiratory tract infection. concomitant viral infection, cases rsv
infection, present third children pneumococcal infection. it
is concluded pneumococcal etiology actively sought also in
patients viral respiratory infection, especially young children rsv 
infection.
