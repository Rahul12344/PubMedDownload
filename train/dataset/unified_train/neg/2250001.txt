the gene 32 protein bacteriophage t4 required efficient genetic
recombination infected eschericia coli cells strongly stimulates vitro 
pairing catalyzed phage uvsx protein, reca-like strand transferase. this
helix-destabilizing factor known bind tightly cooperatively to
single-stranded dna interact specifically uvsx protein well as
other phage gene products. however, detailed role homologous pairing is
not well understood. show efficiency uvsx
protein-mediated pairing examined different gene 32 protein duplex dna 
concentrations, correlation two found, suggesting two
interact functionally important manner reaction. 
data consistent model gene 32 protein binds strand
displaced recipient duplex pairing, thereby stabilizing the
heteroduplex product. alternative model gene 32 protein replaces 
uvsx invading strand, thereby freeing strand transferase bind to
the displaced strand, also considered.
