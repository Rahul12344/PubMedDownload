background: hepatitis e virus (hev) common cause acute viral hepatitis
worldwide. typically associated self-limiting illness, infection may
persist immunosuppressed populations significant morbidity mortality.
based clinical data published world-wide, uk blood safety guidance recommends 
the universal screening hev rna blood donors donors tissue, organs 
and stem cells.
objectives: cross-sectional study aimed determine point prevalence of
hev viraemia clinical course viraemic patients peri-transplant
period solid organ transplant (sot) haematopoietic stem cell transplant
(hsct) recipients transplanted 3-year period (2013-2015).
study design: nucleic acid extracts whole blood patients undergoing sot
or hsct tested in-house real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction assay hev rna. samples tested baseline (time of
transplant), 30, 60 90 days post-transplant.
results: 870 patients (259 hsct, 262 liver 349 kidney transplant) were
included 2554 samples meeting inclusion criteria. kidney transplant
patients hev viraemia time testing. one hsct three liver transplant
patients found hev rna positive. overall represented 0.46% the
patients testing positive hev viraemia.
conclusions: prevalence hev viraemia sot hsct patients u.k. although
higher general population low baseline remains low
throughout early post-transplant phase. clearance viraemia be
maintained despite ongoing immunosuppression. prospective u.k. studies are
necessary inform screening policies population.
