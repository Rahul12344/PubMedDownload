to examine accuracy, feasibility benefits screening hepatitis c
virus core antigen (hcvag) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) test
in pools. many countries cannot afford test blood donations hepatitis c
using molecular methods. screening individual units using elisa hcvag test is
an acceptable, yet still expensive, alternative, especially small blood bank 
settings. study evaluated option screening hcvag pools. the
sensitivity (se) specificity (sp) hcvag pools three six
antibody-negative samples estimated compared polymerase chain
reaction (pcr). feasibility cost-benefit assay assessed 960
routine samples collected hospital blood bank gaza. based results 
50 pcr-positive pools 50 110 pcr-negative pools three six, se 
of testing pools three six samples 80-82% [95% confidence interval
(ci): 66.3-91.4] sp >or=98% (95% ci: 89.4-100.0) compared pcr. the
incidence antigen donors gaza 0.1% (95% ci: 0-0.56). cost analyses
suggested significant benefits implementing screening blood donations for
hcvag incidence rate >4.2/10,000, leading reduction the
expenditures needed treat patients infected hcv. risk of
transfusion-transmitted hepatitis c resource-deprived developing countries can
be efficiently reduced additional screening antibody-negative blood
donations hcvag pools six.
