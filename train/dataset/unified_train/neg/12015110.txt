objective: determine frequency characteristics reassortment among
hantaan seoul viruses causing hemorrhagic fever renal syndrome (hfrs).
methods: mixed infections initiated tissue culture, using hantaan virus
strain 76 - 118 seoul virus strain sr-11. potential reassortant virus plaques
were picked multiplex rt-pcr, using primers specific individual genome
segments (l, m, s) strain.
results: progeny virus plaques (68.19% 44) parental genotype
of 76 - 118 strain sr-11 strain 2 44 plaques mixed genotypes that
yielded rt-pcr bands segment parental strains. reassortant
viruses detected 68.19% 44 progeny plaques tested, involving and
s segments. addition, approximately 4.55% progeny virus plaques
appeared contain segments originating parental virus strains,
showing diploid.
conclusion: genetic reassortment occur hantaan virus seoul virus 
strains.
