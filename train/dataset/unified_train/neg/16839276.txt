the successful transduction engraftment human mobilized peripheral blood
(mbp) cd34(+) cells determined large extent ex vivo
cell-processing conditions. preparation upcoming clinical trials, we
investigated essential culture parameters devised short efficient
gammaretroviral transduction protocol entailing minimal manipulation mbp
cd34(+) cells. engraftment potential vivo transgene expression 
progeny repopulating cd34(+) cells measured assess functionality
of cd34(+) cells transduced conditions. using competitive vivo
repopulation assay nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice, 
demonstrate equivalent engraftment cd34(+) cells transduced serum-free
conditions compared cd34(+) cells cultured serum. also took
advantage vivo model demonstrate ex vivo manipulation of
cd34(+) cells shortened 60 hr, using 36 hr prestimulation two
cycles transduction 12 hr apart. minimally manipulated cd34(+) cells
engraft manner similar cells transduced longer protocols the
vector-encoded transgene expressed frequency cells derived from
repopulating cd34(+) cells vivo. thus developed short efficient 
human mbp cd34(+) transduction protocol serum-free conditions is
suitable broadly applicable phase clinical trials.
