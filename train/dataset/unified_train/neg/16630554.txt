we reported previously heat shock protein gp96 n-terminal fragment
were able stimulate ctl expansion specific hbv peptide (syvntnmgl) in
balb/c mice. characterized adjuvant effects gp96 human hla-a2
restricted cells. full-length gp96 isolated healthy human liver and
recombinant fragments prokaryotic cells eukaryotic cells were
analyzed ability stimulate maturation human dendritic cells. it
was found vitro proteins capable maturating human
monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mddc) isolated healthy donors well as
from hbv-positive, hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) patients. hla-a2.1/kb
transgenic mice, gp96 recombinant fragments found augment ctl
response specific hbcag(18-27) flpsdffpsv peptide hepatitis b virus.
