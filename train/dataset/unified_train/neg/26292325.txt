human infections avian influenza viruses serious public health
concern. neuraminidase (na) inhibitors (nais) frontline
anti-influenza drugs major option treatment newly emerging
influenza. therefore, essential identify molecular markers nai
resistance among specific na subtypes avian influenza viruses help guide
clinical management. nai-resistant substitutions na subtypes n1 and
n2 poorly studied. here, identified na amino acid substitutions
associated nai resistance among influenza viruses n3, n7, n9 subtypes
which associated zoonotic transmission. applied random
mutagenesis generated recombinant influenza viruses carrying single double
na substitution(s) seven internal genes a/puerto rico/8/1934 (h1n1)
virus. fluorescence-based na inhibition assay, identified three
categories na substitutions associated reduced inhibition nais
(oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir): (i) novel subtype-specific substitutions
in near enzyme catalytic site (r152w, a246t, d293n, n2 numbering),
(ii) subtype-independent substitutions (e119g/v and/or r292k), (iii)
substitutions previously reported subtypes (q136k, i222m, e276d).
our data show although markers resistance present across na
subtypes, subtype-specific markers determined
empirically.importance: number humans infected avian influenza
viruses increasing, raising concerns emergence avian influenza
viruses resistant neuraminidase (na) inhibitors (nais). since studies
have focused nai-resistance human influenza viruses, investigated the
molecular changes na could confer nai resistance avian viruses grown
in immortalized monolayer cells, especially n3, n7, n9 subtypes,
which caused human infections. identified numerous nai-resistant
substitutions previously reported na subtypes also several novel
changes conferring reduced susceptibility nais, subtype specific.
the findings indicate resistance markers common across na subtypes,
but markers need determined empirically subtype. study
also implies antiviral surveillance monitoring could play critical role in
the clinical management influenza virus infection essential component
of pandemic preparedness.
