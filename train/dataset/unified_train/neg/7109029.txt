fatty acid modification newcastle disease virus glycoproteins.

chatis pa, morrison tg.

the fatty acid acylation newcastle disease virus hemagglutininin-neuraminidase
and fusion glycoproteins assayed. [3h]palmitate label associated with
cytoplasmic fusion proteins (f0 f1) virion-associated f1. contrast,
there detectable [3h]palmitate label associated the
hemagglutin-neuraminidase protein newcastle disease virus-infected chinese
hamster ovary cells chicken embryo cells virions released these
cells. thus, fatty acid modification may important maturation of
some glycoproteins.
