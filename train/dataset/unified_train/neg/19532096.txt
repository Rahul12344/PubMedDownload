purpose review: virus-induced wheezing infancy risk factor asthma,
and recent studies highlighted role rhinoviruses causing acute
illnesses possible contributing factor chronic asthma.
recent findings: human rhinoviruses (hrvs) long known most
common cause common cold infants children. recent developments in
molecular diagnostics led discovery new viruses also
provided data implicate hrv important cause lower respiratory
infections acute virus-induced wheezing preschool children. addition,
hrv-induced wheezing episodes appear identify children increased
risk subsequent development childhood asthma.
summary: collectively, findings raise possibility lower
respiratory infections pathogens hrv respiratory syncytial virus
could participate causation asthma, especially children with
suboptimal antiviral defenses. variety experimental models clinical
studies used identify possible mechanisms related infection
and ensuing host response could disturb normal lung immunologic
development promote asthma. defining relationships could lead new
therapeutic preventive approaches common forms childhood asthma.
