multiple-type human papillomaviruses (hpv) infection presents greater risk 
persistence asymptomatic individuals may accelerate cancer development. to
extend scope hpv types defined probe-based assays, multiplexing deep
sequencing hpv l1, coupled hpv-quest genotyping server a
bioinformatic pipeline, established applied survey diversity of
hpv genotypes among subset healthy men hpv men (him)
multinational study. twenty-one hpv genotypes (12 high-risk 9 low-risk) 
detected genital area 18 asymptomatic individuals. single hpv type,
either hpv16, hpv6b hpv83, detected 7 individuals, coinfection by
2 5 high-risk and/or low-risk genotypes identified 11
participants. two individuals studied one year, hpv16 persisted,
while fluctuations coinfecting genotypes occurred. hpv l1 regions were
generally identical query reference sequences, although nonsynonymous
and synonymous nucleotide polymorphisms hpv16, 18, 31, 35h, 59, 70, 73,
cand85, 6b, 62, 81, 83, cand89 jeb2 l1 genotypes, mostly unidentified by
linear array, evident. deep sequencing coupled hpv-quest provides
efficient unambiguous classification hpv genotypes multiple-type hpv
infection host ecosystems.
