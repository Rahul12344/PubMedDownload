background: human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) exposed infants high risk
of mycobacterium tuberculosis exposure, high rates progression to
tuberculosis (tb) disease significant risk bacille calmette-guérin 
(bcg) induced adverse events.
objective: evaluate delayed bcg vaccination strategy hiv-exposed infants.
design: randomised trial routine bcg vaccination given birth compared 
14 weeks age hiv-exposed non-infected non-hiv-exposed infants to
investigate longitudinal bcg-induced immune responses using 7-day whole blood
interferon-gamma (ifn-γ) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
results: significantly higher proportion infants positive responses to
m. tuberculosis purified protein derivative (ppd) bcg 14 weeks the
birth vs. delayed vaccination groups (p = 0.001 both). difference no
longer apparent weeks 24 52. among infants vaccinated birth, 14-week
ifn-γ response m. tuberculosis ppd lower among hiv-exposed than
non-exposed infants (276.5 pg/ml vs. 790.2, p = 0.048). among infants, 
were significant correlations magnitude ifn-γ responses bcg, m.
tuberculosis ppd, tb 10.4 culture filtrate protein 10/early secreted
antigenic target 6.
conclusions: timing vaccination limited effect bcg-induced ifn-γ
responses, waned considerably 1 year despite initial vigorous
responses vaccination groups. lower responses hiv-exposed
non-infected infants suggest potentially altered mycobacterial immunity early 
life.
