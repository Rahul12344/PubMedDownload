runx1 runx3 expressed many stages b-cell differentiation,
suggesting play role development functions this
lineage. transgenic mice lacking expression runx1 runx protein-binding 
partner, cbfbeta, defective b-cell development, differentiation blocked
at early stage. specific knockout runx1 adult hematopoietic cells also
caused decrease number mature b cells, supporting role runx1 in
both developmental adult hematopoiesis. furthermore, runx proteins 
shown regulate several b-cell-specific genes play important role in
tgf-beta-induced immunoglobulin class switching iga. importance runx1
in b-cell development additionally demonstrated dysregulation the
t(12;21) translocation, frequent translocation found acute
lymphocytic leukemia. epstein barr virus immortalized human b lymphoblastoid cell
lines express runx3, cross-regulation runx1 runx3 occurs these
cells. knockdown runx3 cells induces runx1 expression inhibits
cell proliferation, directly showing runx proteins regulate b-cell
growth.
