treatment outcomes hiv patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (art) in
rwanda scarcely documented. hiv viral load (vl) hiv drug-resistance
(hivdr) outcomes month 12 determined prospective cohort study of
antiretroviral-naïve hiv patients initiating first-line therapy kigali.
treatment response monitored clinically regular cd4 counts and
targeted hiv viral load (vl) confirm drug failure. vl measurements hivdr
genotyping performed retrospectively baseline month 12 samples. one
hundred fifty-eight participants completed month 12 follow-up visit
had vl data available month 12. (88%) virologically
suppressed (vl≤1000 copies/ml) 18 virological failure (11%), 
the range who-suggested targets hivdr prevention. cd4 criteria had
been used classify treatment response, 26% participants would been
misclassified treatment failure. pre-therapy hivdr documented 4 109 
participants (3.6%) hivdr genotyping results baseline. eight 12
participants (66.7%) virological failure hivdr genotyping results at
month 12 found harbor mutation(s), mostly nnrti resistance mutations,
whereas 4 patients hivdr mutations. almost half (44%) participants 
initiated art cd4 count ≤200 cell/µl severe cd4 depletion baseline (<50
cells/µl) associated virological treatment failure (p = 0.008). although
the findings may generalizable hiv patients rwanda, data
suggest first-line art regimen changes currently warranted. however,
the accumulation acquired hivdr mutations participants underscores the
need reinforce hivdr prevention strategies, increasing the
availability appropriate use vl testing monitor art response, ensuring 
high quality adherence counseling, promoting earlier identification hiv
patients enrollment hiv care treatment programs.
