specific dna sequences.

borr√°s t, gibbs cj jr.

chromatography hybridization techniques employing scrapie enriched fractions 
of hamster brains employed detect scrapie-specific dna molecule.
125i-labeled dna eight different scrapie-enriched hamster brain fractions
was hybridized total dna rna normal scrapie hamster mouse and
to dna normal human brain brain tissue patients dying with
creutzfeldt-jakob disease. enrichment infectivity obtained cellular
partition, gel filtration gel electrophoresis. reassociation probes
with scrapie dna higher value normal. level 
of detection studies indicated scrapie dna virus
replicating dna specific infectivity would lower 687
molecules per infectious unit. findings weaken possibility scrapie
is dna virus.
