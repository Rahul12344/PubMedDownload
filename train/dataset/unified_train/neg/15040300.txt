monoclonal antibodies (mas) rna-dependent rna polymerase turnip
yellow luteovirus (tyv) prepared using recombinant protein immunogen
and shown directed c-terminal part viral replicase. these
mas found interact 70-kda protein found extracts from
tyv-infected plants. result first successful attempt detecting 
rna-dependent rna polymerase luteovirus infected plant extracts. also 
found protein processed accumulation content 
in infected plant obey definite dynamics infection. english
