introduction chronic kidney disease (ckd) one consequences human
immunodeficiency virus-1 (hiv-1) infection. disease increases risk of
progression acquired immunodeficiency syndrome death complicates
antiretroviral therapy. prevalence ckd hiv-1-infected patients is
difficult estimate depends diagnostic criteria ckd. objectives 
the aim study evaluate usefulness single measurement of
serum asymmetric dimethylarginine (adma) levels diagnosis kidney damage
in patients infected hiv-1.  patients methods study included 119
hiv-1-infected individuals (88 males [74%]), on antiretroviral treatment and
treatment-naive, negative history kidney disease, 31
healthy volunteers. analyzed demographic characteristics well data on
concomitant diseases, antiretroviral regimen, serum adma concentrations,
parameters renal function, cd4+ cell count, hiv-1 viral load. results no
significant impairment renal function observed. mean serum adma levels 
all hiv-1-infected patients, well treatment-naive patients treated
patients, significantly higher (p <0.0001; p = 0.0001; p <0.0001;
respectively) compared control group. the difference between
treatment-naive treated hiv-1-infected patients nonsignificant.
adma levels correlated mean duration antiretroviral therapy,
antiretroviral drugs used, or other risk factors ckd. conclusions single
measurement adma levels useful diagnosis ckd patients
without significant renal pathology indicator kidney damage related
to antiretroviral therapy. significance of repeated measurements adma
levels renal function assessment requires research.
