background & aims: rotavirus infection leading cause morbidity and
mortality children younger 5 years age. current treatment options 
limited. assessed efficacy llama-derived, heavy-chain antibody
fragment called anti-rotavirus protein (arp1), modifying severity and
duration diarrhea male infants rotavirus infection.
methods: performed double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 176 male
infants (6-24 months old) severe rotavirus-associated diarrhea dhaka
hospital, bangladesh. infants randomly assigned groups given oral
arp1 (15-30 mg/kg/day, n = 88) placebo (maltodextrin, n = 88) maximum of
5 days. primary outcomes severity (stool output) duration of
diarrhea fecal excretion rotavirus. secondary outcomes intake oral
rehydration salt solution, severity vomiting, serum levels of
rotavirus-specific iga.
results: infants rotavirus infection, total cumulative stool output 
was 305.47 g/kg body weight among given placebo (n = 63) 237.03 g/kg
body weight among given arp1 (n = 61) (a difference 68.44 g/kg body
weight 22.5%; 95% confidence interval: 18.27-118.59 g/kg body weight; p
=.0079). significant reduction rate stool output (g/kg/d) in
the arp1 group compared placebo group (61%; p = .002). arp1 no
significant effect infants concomitant infections other
measured outcomes. adverse events could linked arp1.
conclusions: placebo-controlled trial, arp1 reduced stool output male
infants severe rotavirus-associated diarrhea. clinicaltrials.gov number:
nct01259765.
