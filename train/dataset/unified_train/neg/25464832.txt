host factors required viral replication ideal drug targets they
are less likely viral proteins mutate drug-mediated selective
pressure. although genome-wide screens identified host proteins involved 
influenza virus replication, limited mechanistic understanding these
factors affect influenza hindered potential drug development. conducted 
systematic analysis identify validate host factors associate with
influenza virus proteins affect viral replication. identifying over
1,000 host factors coimmunoprecipitate specific viral proteins, we
generated network virus-host protein interactions based stage 
viral life cycle affected upon host factor downregulation. using compounds that
inhibit host factors, validated several proteins, notably golgi-specific
brefeldin a-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (gbf1) jak1, as
potential antiviral drug targets. thus, virus-host interactome screens are
powerful strategies identify targetable host factors guide antiviral drug 
development.
