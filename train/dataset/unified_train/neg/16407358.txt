dengue virus-2 (denv-2) rna quantified midgut legs individual
aedes aegypti 14 days postinfectious blood meal (dpi) denv-2
susceptible strain chetumal, mexico. sybr green based strand-specific,
quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)
assay developed. lower detection quantitation limits 20 200 
copies per reaction, respectively. amounts positive negative strand viral 
rna strands correlated. numbers plaque-forming units (pfu) were
correlated denv-2 rna copy number c6/36 cell cultures and
mosquitoes. pfu consistently lower rna copy number 2-3 log(10).
midgut levels denv-2 rna peaked 8 dpi fluctuated erratically 6 and
9 dpi. copies denv-2 rna varied significantly among infected mosquitoes at
each time point. quantitative real-time rt-pcr convenient reliable
method provides new insights virus-vector interactions.
