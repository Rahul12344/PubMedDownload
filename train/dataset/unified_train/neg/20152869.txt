begomoviruses cause major diseases sweet potato worldwide impairing
considerably yields important food staple. since sweet potato plants 
are vegetatively propagated globally transported, prone to
accumulate disseminate geminiviruses. effective diagnostic tools are,
therefore, desirable. studied genomic diversity geminiviruses present
in naturally-infected sweet potato accessions belonging brazilian germplasm 
bank collection. fifty-five samples different sweet potato accessions
displaying geminivirus-like symptoms analyzed combining rolling circle
amplification (rca) restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) and
sequencing. restriction enzyme mspi (hpaii) revealed diverse band patterns in
55 samples digestion bamhi, ssti psti resulted full-length sweet
potato geminivirus dnas 3 kb 46 samples. addition, smaller
fragments identified either viral "defective dnas" (d-dnas) or
mitochondrial plasmid dnas. diversity sweet potato-associated
geminiviruses found high brazilian conditions.
representative viral full-length dnas cloned sequenced yielding two
new tentative species, three strains several variants previously described
sweet potato geminiviruses. sequence comparisons identified footprints of
recombination genomes underscoring risk generating new
geminiviruses vegetatively propagated germplasm bank material. sites of
recombination found conjunction predicted hairpin structures. we
propose diagnostic routines screen germplasm bank material geminiviruses
by rapid reliable rca/rflp technique choice.
