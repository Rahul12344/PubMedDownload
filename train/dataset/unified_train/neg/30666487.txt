hiv-1 infectious virus causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(aids) is one major causes deaths worldwide. production of
hiv-1 protease (pr) a large scale problem for scientists due its
cytotoxicity, low yield, insolubility, low activity. hiv-1 c-sa protease 
been cloned, expressed, purified previously, however, low recovery
(0.25 mg/l). herein report optimal expression solubilisation procedure 
to recover active hiv-1 c-sa protease enzyme inclusion bodies. hiv
protease expressed seven different vectors (pet11b, pet15b, pet28a pet32a,
pet39b, pet41b pgex 6p-1). highest expression achieved the
vector pet32a (trx tag) employed. total 19.5 mg fusion protein was
refolded 5.5 mg active protease obtained cleavage. free
protease high specific activity 2.81 µmoles/min/mg. interestingly the
trx-fusion protein also showed activity closer (1.24 µmoles/min/mg) of
the free protease suggesting the pet32a vector (trx tag) expressed in
bl21(de3) plyss provides efficient way obtain hiv-1 protease.
