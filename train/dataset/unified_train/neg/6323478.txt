analysis catalytic domain phosphotransferase activity two avian
sarcoma virus-transforming proteins.

brugge js, darrow d.

proteolytic digestion transforming protein rous sarcoma virus (pp60src)
with trypsin, chymotrypsin, thermolysin generated 29,000-dalton fragment
representing carboxyl half molecule. proteolytic fragment was
able phosphorylate pp60src-specific immunoglobulin well exogenous
substrates angiotensin, casein, tubulin. quantitated molar 
basis, protease-resistant fragment pp60src greater specific activity
than intact enzyme. digestion pp90yes, transforming protein y73
sarcoma virus proteases yielded peptide similar molecular weight 
which capable autophosphorylation well phosphorylation of
exogenous substrates. proteolytic fragments pp60src pp90yes
displayed strict specificity phosphorylation tyrosine the
intact enzymes. results indicate 29,000-dalton carboxyl end of
pp60src pp90yes function independently phosphotransferases and
indicate catalytic domains molecules conformation 
confers protection limited conditions proteolysis.
