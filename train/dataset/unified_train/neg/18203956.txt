ccl2 (mcp-1) shown enhance hiv-1 replication. expression 
chemokine macrophages up-modulated consequence viral infection or
gp120 exposure. study, show first time the
phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase c (pc-plc) required the
production ccl2 triggered gp120 human monocyte-derived macrophages
(mdms). using combination pharmacologic inhibition, confocal laser-scanner
microscopy, enzymatic activity assay, demonstrate r5 gp120
interaction ccr5 activates pc-plc, assessed time-dependent
modification subcellular distribution concentration-dependent
increase enzymatic activity. furthermore, pc-plc required for
nf-kb-mediated ccl2 production triggered r5 gp120. notably, pc-plc activation 
through ccr5 specifically induced gp120, since triggering ccr5 
natural ligand ccl4 (mip-1beta) affect pc-plc cellular distribution 
enzymatic activity, well ccl2 secretion, thus suggesting different
signaling pathways activated ccr5 interaction hiv-1 or
chemokine ligands. identification pc-plc critical mediator of
well-defined gp120-mediated effects mdms unravels novel mechanism involved
in bystander activation may contribute define potential therapeutic
targets block env-triggered pathologic responses.
