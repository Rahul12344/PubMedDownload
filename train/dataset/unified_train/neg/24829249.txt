viral infections important causes morbidity mortality patients
after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. monitoring pcr of
herpesviridae loads blood samples become critical part posttransplant
follow-up, representing mounting costs laboratory. study, we
assessed clinical performance multiplex pcr dna microarray clart
entherpex kit detection cytomegalovirus (cmv), epstein-barr virus (ebv),
and human herpesvirus 6 (hhv-6) screening test virological follow-up.
two hundred fifty-five blood samples 16 transplanted patients, prospectively
tested routine pcr assays, analyzed microarray. routine pcr detected
single multiple viruses 42% 10% samples, respectively.
microarray detected single multiple viruses 34% 18% samples,
respectively. microarray results correlated well cmv ebv detections by
routine pcr (kappa tests = 0.79 0.78, respectively), whereas weak
correlation observed hhv-6 (0.43). hhv-7 also detected 48 samples
by microarray. conclusion, microarray reliable screening assay 
posttransplant virological follow-up detect cmv ebv infections blood.
however, positive samples must subsequently confirmed viral loads must 
quantified pcr assays. limitations identified regarding hhv-6 detection. 
although promising, easy use first-line test, allows a
reduction cost analysis without undue delay reporting the
final quantitative result clinician, characteristics this
microarray improved, particularly regarding quality control the
targeted virus panel, could used routine test.
