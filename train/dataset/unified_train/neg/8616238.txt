as ancestors higher plants, mosses offer advantages simple model organisms 
in studying complex processes development signal transduction.
overexpression transgenes genetic transformation powerful technique
in studies. establish controllable expression system this
experimental approach expressed chimeric protein consisting the
tn1o-encoded tet repressor activation domain herpes simplex virion
protein 16 moss physcomitrella patens. showed protein
activates transcription suitable target promoter (top 1o) containing seven
operators upstream tata box. media containing low levels of
tetracycline (1 mg/l), expression levels beta-glucuronidase (gus) reporter
gene dropped <1% absence tetracycline. regulation is
due interference tetracycline dna binding activity tet
repressor portion chimeric transcriptional activator. stable transformants
grown three weeks tetracycline-containing media showed negligible gus
activity, whereas gus expressed strongly within 24 h transfer to
tetracycline-free media. potent stringently regulated expression other,
physiologically active genes thus readily available moss system using
the convenient toplo expression system.
