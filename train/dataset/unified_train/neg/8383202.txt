the etiology common intraoral mucosal disease, recurrent aphthous
ulceration (rau), remains obscure. here, attempts made diagnose
reactivation varicella zoster (vzv), cytomegalovirus (cmv), epstein-barr (ebv)
and human hepes virus 6 (hhv-6) infections paired sera association with
rau recurrences. first sample obtained within 3 days new
recurrence (1) second 10-14 days later (2). study initially comprised
18 otherwise healthy rau patients (gr a) 17 sex- age-matched healthy
non-rau individuals. values specific antibody subclasses (igm, igg, iga) 
determined elisa (vzv, cmv, ebv) ifa (hhv-6). patients controls
exhibited differences parameters specific vzv igm cmv igm. order 
substantiate findings, specific vzv igm cmv igm subsequently also 
evaluated 17 rau patients (gr b). ten patients gr 11 gr b
were igm seropositive either vzv and/or cmv least one serum
samples, whereas controls one vzv igm positive none cmv igm
positive. evaluated groups, optometric density (od) antibody levels vzv igm
were significantly higher patients (gr (1,2) vs controls: p < 0.0001; gr
b (1,2) vs controls: p < 0.001). cmv od igm antibody values significantly
higher gr b (1,2 vs controls: p < 0.01). study lends support for
reactivation vzv and/or cmv infection associated rau recurrences.
