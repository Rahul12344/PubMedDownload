we used cultured murine cell model inner medullary collecting duct
(mimcd-3 cells) examine regulation ubiquitous sodium-proton
exchanger, na+/h+ exchanger isoform 1 (nhe-1), prototypical g
protein-coupled receptor, bradykinin b2 receptor. bradykinin rapidly
activates nhe-1 concentration-dependent manner assessed proton
microphysiometry quiescent cells by
2'-7'-bis[2-carboxymethyl]-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein fluorescence measuring the
accelerated rate ph(i) recovery imposed acid load. activation of
nhe-1 blocked inhibitors bradykinin b2 receptor, phospholipase c,
ca2+/calmodulin (cam), janus kinase 2 (jak2), pertussis toxin or
by inhibitors protein kinase c phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase.
immunoprecipitation studies showed bradykinin stimulates assembly a
signal transduction complex includes cam, jak2, nhe-1. cam appears be
a direct substrate phosphorylation jak2 measured vitro kinase 
assay. propose jak2 new indirect regulator nhe-1 activity, 
modulates activity nhe-1 increasing tyrosine phosphorylation cam
and likely increasing binding cam nhe-1.
