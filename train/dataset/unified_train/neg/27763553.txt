west nile virus (wnv) (+) sense, single-stranded rna virus flavivirus
genus. wnv rna possesses m7gpppnm 5' cap 2'-o-methylation mimics
host mrnas preventing innate immune detection allowing virus translate
its rna genome utilization cap-dependent translation initiation
effectors wide variety host species. prior work established the
requirement host mammalian target rapamycin complex 1 (mtorc1) for
optimal wnv growth protein expression; yet, roles downstream
effectors mtorc1 wnv translation unknown. study, utilize
gene deletion mutants ribosomal protein kinase called s6 kinase (s6k) 
eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e-binding protein (4ebp) pathways
downstream mtorc1 define role mtor-dependent translation initiation 
signals wnv gene expression growth. show wnv growth and
protein expression dependent mtorc1 mediated-regulation eukaryotic 
translation initiation factor 4e-binding protein/eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 4e-binding protein (4ebp/eif4e) interaction eukaryotic
initiation factor 4f (eif4f) complex formation support viral growth viral 
protein expression. also show canonical signals mtorc1 activation 
including ribosomal protein s6 (rps6) s6k phosphorylation required
for wnv growth conditions. data suggest the
mtorc1/4ebp/eif4e signaling axis activated support translation the
wnv genome.
