aims: investigate clinicopathological features epstein-barr virus
(ebv)-positive grey zone lymphoma (gzl) features intermediate between
diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl) classical hodgkin lymphoma (chl).
methods results: investigated clinicopathological features 14 cases
of ebv-positive gzl japan. control group included 173 cases of
ebv-positive chl 64 cases ebv-positive dlbcl elderly (polymorphous 
type). patients 10 men four women median age 62 years.
twelve patients (86%) advanced clinical stage, 11 (79%) b-symptoms, eight
(57%) mediastinal disease, 10 (71%) elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase 
(ldh) levels, five (36%) thrombocytopenia. cases chl-like
morphology strongly expressed least one b-cell marker. neoplastic
cells hodgkin reed-sternberg-like cells, large number of
mononuclear variants. ebv-positive gzl patients significantly more
likely ebv-positive chl patients advanced clinical stage (p =
0.023), presence b-symptoms (p = 0.011), elevated serum ldh levels (p =
0.047), thrombocytopenia (p = 0.042), mediastinal involvement (p = 0.023).
the progression-free survival (pfs) ebv-positive gzl patients was
significantly poorer ebv-positive chl patients (p = 0.043) no
difference ebv-positive dlbcl patients observed (p = 0.367).
conclusions: ebv-positive gzl patients significantly worse pfs than
ebv-positive chl patients, significantly likely adverse
clinical parameters advanced clinical stage, presence b-symptoms, 
thrombocytopenia. studies needed better characterize entity, 
which may require development innovative therapeutic strategies.
