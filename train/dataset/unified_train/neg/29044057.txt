purpose: aim study clinicodemographic profile treatment outcome
of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (ossn).
methods: retrospective observational study 57 eyes (56 cases) 
clinically diagnosed ossn, presenting center past year.
results: median age presentation 55 years male:female ratio being
4.5:1. systemic predisposing conditions xeroderma pigmentosa (1) postkidney 
transplant immunosuppression (1), human immunodeficiency virus infection (1).
patients predisposing conditions younger median age onset (33
years). majority tumors nodular (61.4%), gelatinous (61.4%), 
limbal involvement (96%). ultrasound biomicroscopy (ubm), mean tumor height
was 2.93 ± 1.02 mm, intraocular extension evident seven eyes. ossn
with intraocular extension mean tumor height 4.3 ± 1.32 mm. nodal
metastasis seen one case presentation. per american joint committee 
for cancer classification seventh edition staging-two cases t1, one t2, 
46 t3 eight t4. treatment advised included conservative therapy for
39; wide local excision (4 mm margin clearance) cryotherapy seven;
enucleation four; exenteration four eyes. overall, complete regression 
was achieved 88% cases mean follow-up 13.5 ± 4.6 months.
recurrence seen three cases, treated exenteration, radical
neck dissection, palliative chemo-radiotherapy, respectively.
conclusion: although associated old age, earlier onset ossn seen in
patients systemic predisposing conditions. thicker tumors setting 
a previous surgery immunocompromised status considered high-risk
features intraocular extension evaluated ubm.
