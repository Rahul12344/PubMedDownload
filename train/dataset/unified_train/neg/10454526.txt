o(6)-benzylguanine (6-bg) inactivates mammalian o(6)-methylguanine dna
methyltransferase (mgmt), important dna repair protein protects cells
against chloroethylnitrosourea (cenu) cytotoxicity. 6-bg tested an
approach treat cenu-resistant tumors overexpress endogenous mgmt.
however, addition restoring cenu tumor cell sensitivity, 6-bg also
increases cytotoxic effects cenus hematopoietic cells. several
6-bg-resistant human mgmt mutants characterized escherichia coli and
are predicted protect mammalian cells combination 6-bg cenu
treatment vivo. two mutants, p140a p140a/g156a, demonstrated 20- and
1200-fold resistance 6-bg depletion mgmt activity compared with
wild-type mgmt (wtmgmt). here, analyzed retroviral vectors express either
wtmgmt, p140a p140a/g156a mutant forms mgmt. retroviral-infected l1210 
hematopoietic cells demonstrated similar levels rna transduced clones. 
however, amount mgmt protein dna repair activity reduced clones
expressing p140a/g156a mutant compared expressing wtmgmt p140a.
expression p140a associated 4- 8-fold increase resistance 
6-bg depletion mgmt transduced l1210 clones 1,
3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea ic(50) 50 microm (compared 27.5 microm
for wtmgmt) primary murine hematopoietic cells. results demonstrate 
utility screening 6-bg-resistant mgmt proteins hematopoietic cells and
provide evidence p140a mutant form mgmt generates 6-bg- and
cenu-resistant hematopoietic cells. retrovirus vectors expressing mutant may
be useful future human gene therapy trials.
