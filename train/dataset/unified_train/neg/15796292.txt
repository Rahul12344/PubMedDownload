detection rare impurities drug products presents special challenges.
replication competent adenovirus (rca) rare impurity found in
adenovirus-based gene therapy products. various methods used detection of
rcas. primarily focus qualitative assays. acceptance sampling plans for
detecting rcas batches gene therapy products discussed. assuming that
the number rca units per patient dose follows poisson distribution,
operating characteristics (oc) sampling plans studied. oc
curves display acceptance probabilities batches specific true but
unknown level rca used assess specificity sensitivity of
the test strategies. application bayesian methodologies assessment of
rca levels drug batches also discussed. using observed data prior
belief, 95% credible region number rca units per patient dose be
constructed. classical bayesian calculations display impact of
sample size, sampling fraction, assay quality detection rca. for
better sensitivity, largest possible sampling fraction not
interfere logistics performance assay used. the
choice sample size depend upper limit biologically safe
level rca, testing strategy, desired level sensitivity and
specificity, also practical issues.
