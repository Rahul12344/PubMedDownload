we recently reported herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) us3 protein kinase
phosphorylates threonine position 887 (thr-887) cytoplasmic tail of
envelope glycoprotein b (gb) (a. kato, j. arii, i. shiratori, h. akashi, h.
arase, y. kawaguchi, j. virol. 83:250-261, 2009; t. wisner, c. c. wright, a. 
kato, y. kawaguchi, f. mou, j. d. baines, r. j. roller d. c. johnson, j.
virol. 83:3115-3126, 2009). studies reported here, examined the
effect(s) phosphorylation viral replication pathogenesis vivo
and present data showing replacement gb thr-887 alanine significantly 
reduced viral replication mouse cornea development herpes stroma
keratitis periocular skin disease mice. effects been
reported mice infected recombinant hsv-1 carrying kinase-inactive
mutant us3. observations suggested us3 phosphorylation gb
thr-887 played critical role viral replication vivo hsv-1
pathogenesis. addition, generated monoclonal antibody specifically
reacted phosphorylated gb thr-887 used antibody show us3
phosphorylation gb thr-887 regulated subcellular localization gb,
particularly cell surface infected cells.
