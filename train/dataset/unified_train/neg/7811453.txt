sf9, insect cell line commonly used gene expression recombinant
baculovirus (bv), infected st. louis encephalitis (sle) virus, a
flavivirus, resulting persistent, productive, cytopathic infection,
while retaining ability infected recombinant baculovirus (rbv). 
we demonstrate using double immunofluorescence single cells dually
infected sle virus rbv. fourteen additional viruses including additional
flaviviruses, arbovirus classes, vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv), and
herpes simplex virus, type 1 (hsv-1) failed produce cytopathic effect (cpe) 
in sf9 cells. plaque assays indicated infectious virus present several
weeks post-inoculation yellow fever (yf), dengue types 1 2 (den-1 and
den-2), gumbo limbo (gl), eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus (eee), western
equine encephalomyelitis virus (wee), hsv-1, vsv viruses. hsv-1, gl, eee,
wee vsv, yf, den-1 den-2 viruses, could attributed
solely survival sf9 cell culture media. 14 viruses tested, 
hsv-1 could detected 2 weeks serum-free media. data indicate that
several viruses pathogenic humans stable long periods of
time 27 degrees c serum-containing media used cultivation sf9
cells. yf, den-1 den-2 viruses may replicate sf9 cells extremely low
levels. suggests adventitious agents produce obvious cpe
or interfere rbv infection recombinant protein expression could
contaminate sf9 cell cultures media.
