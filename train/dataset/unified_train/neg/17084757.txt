background: epidemics hiv-1 tuberculosis south africa closely
related. high mortality rates co-infected patients improved with
antiretroviral therapy, drug-resistant tuberculosis emerged major
cause death. assessed prevalence consequences of
multidrug-resistant (mdr) extensively drug-resistant (xdr) tuberculosis 
rural area kwazulu natal, south africa.
methods: undertook enhanced surveillance drug-resistant tuberculosis 
sputum culture drug susceptibility testing patients known or
suspected tuberculosis. genotyping done isolates resistant first-line 
and second-line drugs.
results: january, 2005, march, 2006, sputum obtained 1539
patients. detected mdr tuberculosis 221 patients, 53 xdr
tuberculosis. prevalence among 475 patients culture-confirmed tuberculosis
was 39% (185 patients) mdr 6% (30) xdr tuberculosis. 55% (26 
47) patients xdr tuberculosis never previously treated for
tuberculosis; 67% (28 42) recent hospital admission. 44 patients
with xdr tuberculosis tested hiv co-infected. 52 53 patients
with xdr tuberculosis died, median survival 16 days time of
diagnosis (iqr 6-37) among 42 patients confirmed dates death.
genotyping isolates showed 39 46 (85%, 95% ci 74-95) patients xdr
tuberculosis similar strains.
conclusions: mdr tuberculosis prevalent previously realised 
setting. xdr tuberculosis transmitted hiv co-infected patients is
associated high mortality. observations warrant urgent intervention
and threaten success treatment programmes tuberculosis hiv.
