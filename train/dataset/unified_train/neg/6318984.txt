we studied nine hodgkin's lymphoma (hd) ten non-hodgkin's lymphoma (nhl)
patients extraordinarily high anti-viral capsid antigen (vca) titers
(greater 5120). controls 13 hd 23 nhl patients anti-vca titers
between 40 2560. high anti-vca titers present nhl patients the
time diagnosis within 16 months, whereas rise anti-vca titers hd 
patients appeared late event clinical course disease
(mean time diagnosis, 68 months). particular, asked whether the
exceptionally high anti-epstein-barr virus (ebv) titers hd nhl
patients correlated ebv-specific -nonspecific
parameters cell-mediated immunity. battery non-ebv-specific
immunological tests included assessment natural killer cell activity and
the analysis t-lymphocyte subclasses according surface markers, together
with spontaneous mitogen-induced dna synthesis helper suppressor
activity pwm-generated immunoglobulin synthesis. outgrowth inhibition (ol) and
leukocyte migration inhibition used assess ebv-specific cell-mediated
immunity. majority high-titer hd nhl patients showed drastically
reduced okt4:okt8 ratio peripheral lymphocyte population. low-titer hd
and nhl patients showed reduction. strict correlation
between number okt8-positive cells suppressor activity the
functional pwm-induced immunoglobulin production test. part high-titer hd 
patients showed defective cellular responses outgrowth inhibition test,
directed proliferation ebv-transformed (ebv-determined nuclear
antigen-positive) cells. showed also deficient leukocyte migration
inhibition response ebv-determined nuclear antigen but, interestingly, 
early antigen-vca. nhl group, one high-titer patients showed a
similar defect. none low-titer hd nhl patients showed defects.
