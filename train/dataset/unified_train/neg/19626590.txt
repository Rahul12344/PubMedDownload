we recently shown adenovirus carrying reic/dkk-3 (ad-reic) exhibits 
a potent tumor-specific cell-killing function various human cancers. has
also become evident human cancers resistant ad-reic-induced
apoptosis. aim present study determine molecular mechanisms
of resistance ad-reic. first, isolated resistant clones human
prostate cancer cell line, pc3, repeated exposure ad-reic. infection
efficiency adenovirus vector expression level reic/dkk-3 the
resistant clones similar parental pc3 cells. screening
for alteration levels functional status proteins involved in
ad-reic-induced apoptosis, found bip/grp78, er-residing chaperone
protein, expressed higher levels consistently among resistant cells.
expression levels bip rates apoptosis induced ad-reic inversely
correlated. down-regulation bip sirna sensitized resistant cells to
ad-reic vivo well culture. results indicate bip major
determinant resistance ad-reic-induced apoptosis. thus bip useful for
diagnosis inherent acquired resistance cancers also target
molecule overcome resistance gene therapeutic ad-reic.
