the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) used produce biotin-labelled human
papillomavirus (hpv) 16- 18-specific dna probes situ hybridization
(ish). pcr performed using amplitaq dna amplification reagent kit
according manufacturer's instructions, except dttp substituted by
different concentrations biotinylated dutp (bio-11-utp). template dna, dna 
extracted either caski hela cells used. reaction mixture was
taken 40 cycles amplification perkin-elmer cetus thermal
cycler. highest yield achieved concentrations dttp and
biotinylated dutp 150 50 microm, respectively. ish results compatible
with obtained biotinylated whole genomic hpv dna probes were
demonstrated primers e7 e6 orf hpv-18 genome used to
produce biotinylated probe pcr. hpv-16, several areas genome
had amplified generate pcr probe equal sensitivity whole
genomic probe. background staining always stronger pcr probes
than whole genomic probes. sensitivity pcr probes not
seem bear clear-cut correlation size nucleotide content the
probe, might rather depend three dimensional structure probe
and availability biotin detection system ish.
