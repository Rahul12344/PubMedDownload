hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection one major global epidemiological
problems. aim study determine distribution hbv genotypes
in poland since data concerning spread hbv viruses the
central-eastern region europe still limited. hbv dna extracted
from 58 serum samples. quantify level hbv dna roche amplicor hbv
monitor assay used. genotype assign hbv subtypes dna sequencing
methods performed. hbv virus 43 serum samples hepatitis b
infected patients genotype (74.1%), 12 cases genotype (20.7%), 3 
had rare europe genotype f (5.2%). prediction hbv serological subtypes 
based hbsag sequencing showed almost 100% occurrence subtype adw2 the
group genotype samples, three different subtypes genotype (ayw2, ayw3, 
and ayw4), equal distribution subtype adw4q- 3 cases genotype f,
also prevalent subtype amerindians. results coincide the
general european hbv prevalence. however, hbv genotype f, common
genotype european countries, detected relatively high
occurrence genotype d, may reflect historical ethnical migration
events poland past.
