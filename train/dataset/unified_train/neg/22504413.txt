measles virus causes severe morbidity mortality, despite availability 
measles vaccines. successful defence viral pathogens requires early
recognition virus-specific patterns innate receptors like toll-like
receptor (tlr)3 rna helicase, retinoic acid inducible gene-i (rig-i).
genetic differences receptors may influence primary immune responses
to measles efficacy measles vaccine. 1-year-old australian infants 
after first measles vaccine dose, investigated functional effects of
tlr3 rig-i polymorphisms intracellular protein expression using flow
cytometry, cytokine responses receptor ligands measles lysate, and
post-vaccination measles igg levels. found tlr3 leu412phe was
significantly associated ifn-α/β response stimulation tlr3
ligand, poly(i:c) (p=0.024). downregulation tlr3 protein expression nk
cells poly(i:c) also associated variant (p=0.011). in
contrast, measles-specific expression, cytokine responses antibody responses 
were associated tlr3 polymorphisms. associations found with
rig-i variants. results suggest tlr3 polymorphism functional
effects receptor expression cytokine response. however, not
translate effect specific responses measles virus vaccine. we
found evidence rig-i polymorphisms involved measles immune
responses.
