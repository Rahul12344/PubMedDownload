background: order evaluate incidence risk factors infection by
hepatitis c virus (hcv) among intravenous drug users conducted prospective
cohort study hcv hiv negative ivdu north east france.
methods: two hundred thirty-one ivdu injected drug least in
their lifetime negative anti-hcv anti-hiv followed-up every
three months 12-month period. serum anti-hcv anti-hiv antibodies 
tested inclusion study end follow-up. data on
injection practices behaviours collected inclusion visit,
and test anti-hcv antibodies performed saliva sample. this
proved positive, elisa test serum anti-hcv antibodies carried out.
results: 231 participants included, 165 (71.4%) underwent final hcv 
hiv serum test. incidence nil hiv infection 9% (95% ci: 4.6-13.4)
person-years hcv infection. among ivdu injected least 
last 6 months hcv infection incidence 11% (95% ci: 4.7-17.1) person-years.
the multivariate analysis carried inclusion data found female sex
alone independent predictive factor hcv seroconversion. cox
proportional hazard multivariate analysis took account time-dependent
exposures covariates, found syringe cotton sharing were, after
adjusting covariates, independent predictive factors hcv
seroconversion: hazard ratio: 6.3 [corrected] (95% ci: 1.1-35.4; [corrected]
p<0.05) 16.4 (95% ci: 1.4-190.6; [corrected] p<0.05), respectively.
conclusion: transmission hcv virus persists among french ivdu despite 
an ongoing national harm reduction program. injecting material cotton sharing
are two major determinants transmission cohort.
