objectives: evaluate response interferon capacity induce liver
disease putative non-a e hepatitis virus designated gb virus c (gbv-c).
methods: rna gbv-c detected reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction nested primers deduced 5'-noncoding region. was
titrated, along rna hepatitis c virus (hcv), 16 co-infected patients
(11%) 140 patients received interferon.
results: completion 6-month course interferon (total dose: 516-774
million units), gbv-c rna disappeared serum seven (44%) hcv rna 
serum 11 (69%) patients. 6 months interferon treatment ended, gbv-c
rna remained cleared three patients (19%), hcv rna persistently
undetectable four (25%). one patient lost gbv-c hcv rnas. three
patients whose serum cleared gbv-c rna pretreatment titers the
virus (two 10[1]/ml one 10[2]/ml) considerably lower than
the titers 13 patients (one 10[2]/ml, eight 10[3]/ml, four 
> = 10[4]/ml) without clearance. decrease alanine aminotransferase
levels paralleled response hcv rna gbv-c rna to
interferon. response hcv 6 months interferon co-infected
patients (4/16 25%) differ significantly patients without
gbv-c infection (44/124 35%).
conclusions: sensitivity gbv-c interferon comparable but
independent hcv. co-infection gbv-c influence response to
interferon patients chronic hepatitis c.
