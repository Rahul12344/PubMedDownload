the possibility hepatitis c virus core gene product (hcv-core) acts a
transactivator insulin-like growth factor ii (igf-ii) gene transcription was
tested. hcv-core protein increases endogenous igf-ii expression promoter 4
(p4) igf-ii gene two cis-acting elements: sp1 egr1 binding
sites. sp1 egr1 bind igf-ii p4 functionally cooperate in
mediating maximal activity igf-ii p4. hcv-core protein induced binding
of sp1 egr1 binding sites igf-ii p4. addition, sp1 egr1 were
stimulated phosphorylate hcv-core, dna binding activity was
up-regulated upon hcv-core transfection. transfection hcv-core hepg2
cells stimulated membrane translocation protein kinase c (pkc) the
treatment hcv-core transfected cells calphostin c, pkc inhibitor,
blocked induction sp1 egr1 dna binding activity, eventually
transcriptional transactivations igf-ii gene. increasing dna binding
activity phosphorylated form sp1 egr1 might important
mechanism regulating igf-ii gene expression promoting cell division
during hepatic carcinogenesis. results indicate hcv-core functions 
a positive regulator igf-ii transcription pkc pathway sp1
and egr1 direct targets transcriptional regulation igf-ii gene 
which plays important role hepatitis c virus pathogenesis the
formation hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc).
