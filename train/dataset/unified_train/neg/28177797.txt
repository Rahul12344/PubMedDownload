gastroenteritis common disease children. characterized diarrhea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, fever. sapovirus (sav) causative agent of
acute gastroenteritis, causes milder illness rotavirus and
norovirus. high variability analytical performance of
quantitative pcr-based assays among clinical laboratories. study developed a
reverse transcription real-time pcr method detect sav fecal specimens
collected children 5-years-old acute gastroenteritis. 137
episodes acute gastroenteritis, 15 (10.9%) associated sav genomic
detection, median viral load 6.6(log10) Â± 7.1(log10) genomes/mg fecal
specimens. significant difference detection rate males and
females (9.48% (13/15) vs. 1.46% (2/15), p = 0.0232). among 15 sav-positive
cases, 6 also positive rotavirus. viral rna recovery rate ranged from
46% 77% manual rnazol protocol 31% 90% automated
maxwell protocol. also studied whether human genomic dna influences the
sensitivity assay: presence caused decrease pcr sensitivity. 
development laboratory-designed real-time pcr taqman assay quantitative 
detection sav optimization standardization assay, using
stools children acute gastroenteritis, described.
