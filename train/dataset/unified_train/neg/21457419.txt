background: aim report experience bk viremia surveillance after
kidney transplant period change cyclosporine (cya)-to lower-dose
tacrolimus (tac)-based primary immunosuppression regimens.
methods: prospective single-center observational cohort study, 68
consecutive patients received renal transplant period used a
cya-based primary immunosuppression regimen 66 changed a
lower-dose tac-based regimen. testing bk viremia quantitative polymerase
chain reaction assay performed least monthly minimum 1 year.
results: thirty-nine (29.1%) patients developed bk viremia 2 (1.5%) developed
bk nephropathy. actuarial time bk viremia shorter patients
receiving cya/mycophenolate mofetil (mmf)/prednisolone (pred) compared with
tac/mmf/pred (p=0.04) primary immunosuppression cya/mmf/pred the
only independent predictor bk viremia (hazard ratio 1.95; p=0.047). comparing 
patients experienced bk viremia not, no
difference incidence acute rejection (20.5% vs. 25.3%; p=0.56) estimated
glomerular filtration rate 12 months (48.8 vs. 49.9 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), the
incidence ureteric stenosis higher (10.3% vs. 1.1%; p=0.01).
conclusions: data demonstrate lower incidence bk viremia patients 
lower-dose tac compared cya-based primary immunosuppression contrast to
previous studies, provide support association bk
virus ureteric complications.
