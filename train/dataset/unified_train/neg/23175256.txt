human parechoviruses (hpevs), particularly type 3 (hpev3), known central
nervous system (cns) pathogens, causing serious infections infants similar 
those caused enteroviruses (evs). primary aim study combine
and validate hpev ev real-time reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) detection
assays best available rt-pcr reagents conditions parallel
detection hpev ev single platform. secondary aim develop
and validate newly developed hpev3-specific real-time rt-pcr assay. five
commercially available rt-pcr kits evaluated pan-hpev ev assays
in one-step two-step rt-pcrs. two-step rt-pcr agpath id rt-pcr (agp)
kit performed best pan-hpev ev assays. pan-hpev-specific assay
performed best agp kit one-step rt-pcr. frozen aliquots 145 (for
hpev, n = 70; ev, n = 75) previously characterized cerebrospinal fluid (csf) 
specimens tested ev-, pan-hpev-, hpev3-specific (hpev specimens only)
assays. pan-hpev ev assays demonstrated 100% analytical sensitivity and
specificity compared historic results, hpev3-specific assay
demonstrated 97% sensitivity 100% specificity. propose real-time
pan-hpev, ev two-step rt-pcr algorithm simultaneous detection hpev ev 
from csf specimens single platform. hpev3-specific one-step rt-pcr assay
can used rapid cost-effective assay detect identify hpev3 in
pan-hpev rt-pcr assay-positive csf specimens.
