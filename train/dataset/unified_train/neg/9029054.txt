delavirdine mesylate (u-90152t) highly specific nonnucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitor currently development treatment aids.
the excretion, disposition, metabolism delavirdine investigated in
sprague-dawley rats oral administration [14c]delavirdine mesylate at
single doses ranging 10 250 mg/kg multiple doses ranging 20 to
250 mg/kg/day. excretion studies showed feces major route of
elimination, delavirdine well absorbed (>80%) 10 mg/kg single dose,
and excretion dose-dependent. metabolism delavirdine rat was
extensive. following metabolites identified (% dose rats given 10 
and 100 mg/kg, respectively): 6'-hydroxy delavirdine (7.1% 15.6%) its
glucuronide (12.2% 6.2%) sulfate (5.5% 3.2%) conjugates, despyridinyl
delavirdine (12.1% 11.7%) conjugate (13.0% 11.7%), desalkyl
delavirdine (16.5% 13.4%), n-sulfamate, 6'- 4'-sulfate conjugates
(2.9% 3.9%). cleavage amide bond delavirdine give
n-isopropylpyridinepiperazine indole carboxylic acid constituted minor
pathway. degradation 6'-hydroxy delavirdine generated despyridinyl delavirdine
and pyridine-ring opened met-14. metabolic pathway delavirdine
involved n-desalkylation, pyridine ring hydroxylation, pyridine ring cleavage,
and amide bond cleavage.
