thrips transmit one devastating plant viruses worldwide-tomato
spotted wilt tospovirus (tswv). tomato spotted wilt tospovirus type species 
in genus orthotospovirus family tospoviridae. although more
than 7,000 thrips species, nine thrips species known transmit tswv.
in study, investigated molecular factors could affect thrips
ability transmit tswv. assembled transcriptomes vector, frankliniella 
fusca [hinds], non-vector, frankliniella tritici [fitch], performed
qualitative comparisons contigs associated virus reception, virus
infection, innate immunity. annotations f. fusca f. tritici contigs
revealed slight differences across biological process molecular functional
groups. comparison virus cell surface receptors revealed homologs of
integrin present species. however, homologs another receptor,
heperan sulfate, present f. fusca alone. contigs associated virus
replication identified species, contig involved inhibition 
of virus replication (radical s-adenosylmethionine) present the
non-vector, f. tritici. additionally, differences immune signaling
pathways identified vector non-vector thrips. detailed
investigations necessary functionally characterize differences
between vector non-vector thrips assess relevance in
orthotospovirus transmission.
