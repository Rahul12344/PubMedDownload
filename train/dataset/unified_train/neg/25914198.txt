genetic variability hemagglutinin (ha1) neuraminidase (na) genes
of influenza viruses results emergence new strains differ in
pathogenicity severity. present study undertaken genotypic
characterization ha1 na genes influenza a(h3n2) strains,
detected 2011-2013. total fifty five influenza a(h3n2) positive
samples [2011 (n = 20), 2012 (n = 4) 2013 (n = 31)] studied. 824 bp 
segment ha1 gene 931 bp segment na gene amplified sequenced by
big-dye terminator kit abi3130, genetic analyzer. molecular phylogenetic
analysis done mega 5.05 software phyml program (v3.0). mutations 
determined comparing deduced amino acid sequences study strains with
that 2009-2013 vaccine strains. studied influenza a(h3n2) strains showed
98.1-99.6% similarity ha1 na amino acid sequences influenza
a/victoria/361/2011 vaccine strain. four mutations ha1 amino acid
sequences (t128a, r142g, l157s n278k) three unique mutations na
amino acid sequences [d251v, s315g v313a] found. mutations were
observed strains year 2013 (cluster ii). none strains
showed presence mutations, n294s r292k, markers oseltamivir
resistance. conclusion, lucknow strains accumulated significant
number mutations antigenic sites ha na coding sequences 
and continue evolving 2013 vaccine strain [a/victoria/361/2011],
however, mutations specific oseltamivir resistance detected.
