a set sense anti-sense oligomeric dna primers, degenerate third
"wobble" base position codons match known dengue virus sequences,
was evaluated universal primers polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay for
the rapid diagnosis dengue virus infections. virus-specific complementary dna 
(cdna) prepared reverse transcription (rt) total rna extracted from
serum. amplified cdna identified nucleic acid hybridization four
serotype-specific, oligomeric dna probes. using sera patients admitted 
dengue fever, rt/pcr followed nucleic acid hybridization using radiolabeled
probes 68% sensitive (50/74; 95% confidence interval [ci] = 57-78%) 100% 
specific. chemiluminescent detection hybridized products 62% sensitive
(26/42; 95% ci = 46-75%). using specimens virus isolate been
obtained, rt/pcr followed nucleic acid hybridization radiolabeled probes 
was 80% sensitive (40/50; 95% ci = 69-91%) 100% specific. results suggest
that rt/pcr using degenerate primers sensitive specific method the
detection dengue viruses clinical specimens.
