in context study involvement snd1 (also known coactivator
p100) biliary lipid secretion primary rat hepatocytes, first-generation
adenoviral vectors used promote overexpression underexpression of
the protein snd1. although differential expression snd1 result in
significant changes processes studied, effects adenoviral
infection observed. particular, infected hepatocytes showed a
higher intracellular taurocholate accumulation capacity. additionally, small
heterodimer partner (shp) farnesoid x receptor (fxr), nuclear
receptors essential regulation bile salt metabolism transport,
were underregulated mrna level. results suggest adenoviral
vectors could altering important control mechanism indicate that
adenoviral vectors used caution transfection vectors for
hepatocytes biliary lipid metabolism studied.
