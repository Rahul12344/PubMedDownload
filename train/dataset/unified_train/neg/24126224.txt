human papilloma virus (hpv) associated oropharynx carcinoma (opc) increasingly
common, distinct biology hpv negative opc. spite better
prognosis, morbidity significant treatment related effects be
debilitating. foreign viral proteins drive hpv+ cancers are
known, multiple options tailored immune therapies. herein review
the immunologic basis disease emerging immune therapies. oncogenesis 
of hpv+ scchn goes beyond cell cycle deregulation, relies immune
escape (e5, e6, e7) downregulating antigen processing, interferon
response, well stat-1 signaling. individual susceptibilities hpv
infection may vary. treatment hpv+ cancers wide range of
successes failures. perhaps shining example immunoprevention 
the l1 protein vaccines developed cervical cancer prevention, however this
vaccine beneficial people already infected. therefore multiple
strategies employed cancer therapeutic realm people with
existing disease. agents range peptides, viral vectors, adoptive
cell therapy. review consider work done scchn cervical
cancer, therapeutic targets similar. listed studies 
exhaustive, rather illustrate experimental design approach.
