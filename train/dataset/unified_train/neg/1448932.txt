sequence analysis revealed rice dwarf phytoreovirus segment s12 1066
nucleotides long small out-of-phase, overlapping open reading frame (orf) 
as well major orf. large orf (positions 42 980) encodes 312 amino
acids, small one (bases 313 591) encodes 92 amino acids an
additional in-frame aug codon (positions 337-339) 24 nucleotides downstream 
the first one. transcripts full-length cdna directed vitro
synthesis three polypeptides 33 (considered translated long 
orf), 8, 7 kda. alteration two atg codons small orf
demonstrated involvement generation 8- 7-kda
polypeptides. although still unknown whether proteins expressed
in vivo, small orf shown conserved s9s two members of
the genus phytoreovirus, rice gall dwarf virus wound tumor virus, suggesting 
its common, important function.
