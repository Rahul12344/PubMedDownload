objective: investigate optimal conditions tri-expression cyp3a4, por
and cyt b5 sf 9 cells.
methods: sf 9 cells expressing cyp3a4, por cyt b5 cultured shaker
flasks. optimized conditions, including temperature rotation speed,
the culture volume, amount surfactant culture time studied.
the expressed products microsomes used metabolize testosterone and
their metabolic activity determined.
results: temperature rotation speed shaker 27 degree and
90 r/min, cell density culture volume 5x105 cells/ml 80-120 ml
per 250 ml shaker flasks, respectively. pluronic f-68 0.1% the
culture time 72 h, condition suitable culture sf 9 cells 
and expression targeted proteins. ratio volume three added 
viruses 1:1:1, expression condition optimal, km,
vmax, clint testosterone metabolism 119.6 μmol/l,0.52 μmol/(min*g
protein) 4.34 ml/(min*g protein), respectively.
conclusion: conditions tri-expressing cyp3a4, por cyt b5 
optimized study product cyp3a4 obtained higher metabolic
activity.
