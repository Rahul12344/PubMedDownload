heparan sulfates (hs) long, linear polysaccharides high degree of
variability. bind vast number proteins growth factors and
cytokines, interactions likely mediated specific hs
domains. investigate structural diversity topological distribution 
hs domains tissues, selected panel 10 unique anti-hs antibodies using 
phage display technology. 10 antibodies recognize specific hs epitope as
demonstrated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using defined synthetic hs
oligosaccharides, modified hs/heparin molecules, hs isolated variety
of organs. chemical groups involved epitopes could indicated and
the position sulfate groups major importance. hs epitopes a
defined tissue distribution shown immunohistochemistry using rat organs.
taken together, data show vivo, large number defined hs epitopes
exist occur randomly tightly, topologically regulated.
