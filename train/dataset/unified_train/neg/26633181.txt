blocking pd-1/pd-l1 pathway emerged potential therapy restore
impaired immune responses human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected
individuals. reports studied impact pd-l1 blockade on
effector cells neglected possible effects regulatory cells (treg cells),
which play essential role balancing immunopathology antiviral effector 
responses. aim study define consequences ex vivo pd-l1 
blockade treg cells hiv-infected individuals. observed hiv
infection led increase pd-1+ pd-l1+ treg cells. upregulation
correlated disease progression decreased antiretroviral treatment.
treg cells viremic individuals particularly high pd-1 expression and
impaired proliferative capacity comparison treg cells individuals
under antiretroviral treatment. pd-l1 blockade restored proliferative
capacity treg cells viremic individuals effect its
suppressive capacity. moreover, increased viral production cell
cultures viremic individuals. increase viral production correlated
with increase treg cell percentage reduction cd4/treg and
cd8/treg cell ratios. contrast effect pd-l1 blockade treg
cells viremic individuals, observe significant effect the
proliferative capacity treg cells individuals viremia was
controlled (either spontaneously antiretroviral treatment). however, pd-l1 
blockade resulted increased proliferative capacity hiv-specific-cd8 t
cells subjects. taken together, findings suggest manipulating
pd-l1 vivo expected influence net gain effector function
depending subject's plasma viremia.
