solid-phase radioimmunoassay total influenza-specific immunoglobulin g.

daugharty h, warfield dt, davis ml.

an antigen-antibody system polystyrene tubes coated immunoglobulin
antibody used quantitating immunoglobulins. similar radioimmunoassay
method adapted viral antigen-antibody system. viral system be
used quantitating viruses measuring virus-specific antibodies by
reacting (125)iodine-labeled anti-immunoglobulin g (igg). optimal conditions
for coating solid phase, specificity immune reaction, other
kinetics sensitivities assay method investigated. comparison of
direct indirect methods assaying immunoglobulins viral antibody
indicates indirect method sensitive quantitate minimum
of 0.037 mug igg per ml. results solid-phase radioimmunoassay influenza
antibody correlate well hemagglutinin antibody titers with
complement-fixing antibody titers. radioimmunoassay results influenza
antibody solid phase likewise agreement results carrier
precipitate radioimmunoassay method. simplicity, reproducibility, and
versatility solid-phase procedure make diagnostically useful.
