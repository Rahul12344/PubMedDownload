background: progression liver disease patients chronic hepatitis c
virus (hcv) infection influenced host viral factors. distinct clinical 
outcomes patients infected different hcv genotypes described in
the literature. however, association specific hcv genotype and
clinical outcome remains unclear. set study natural history hcv 
genotype 1 3 infections campinas, são paulo state, brazil, focusing on
epidemiological, clinical, biochemical, histological characteristics.
methods: patients hcv infection referred treatment january 2003 
and december 2006 included study. collected epidemiological,
clinical, laboratorial data using standard forms.
results: total 283 patients included; genotype 1 identified 163 
(57.6%) patients, genotype 3 112 (39.6%), genotype 2 7 (2.5%), genotype
4 1 (0.35%). patients genotype 2 4 excluded analysis.
multivariate analysis showed intravenous energetic drug, positive
cryoglobulin, cirrhosis independently significantly associated 
hcv genotype 3 (p < 0.05).
conclusion: genotype 3 currently seems associated intravenous
energetic drug, high frequency cryoglobulinemia, advanced liver disease in
our region. understanding distribution different hcv genotypes can
elucidate transmission hcv support optimal prevention strategies.
