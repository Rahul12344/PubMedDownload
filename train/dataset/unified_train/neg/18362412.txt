necropsied lung tissues three fatal cases avian influenza virus (h5n1) 
infection vietnam analyzed detect h5n1 virus-infected cells.
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung tissue sections showed typical
histological features diffuse alveolar damage (dad) cases.
immunohistochemistry influenza virus nucleoprotein antigen revealed
positive signals bronchiolar alveolar epithelial cells one
patient, exhibited dad exudative phase died 6th day 
onset. however, signal detected two cases dad a
proliferative phase. patients died day 16 day 17 onset,
respectively. h5n1 virus antigens detected predominantly epithelial cells
in terminal bronchioles alveoli, i.e., type type ii alveolar
pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages. pathogenesis exudative dad
caused h5n1 infection discussed.
