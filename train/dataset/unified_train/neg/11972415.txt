objectives: outbreaks acute gastroenteritis associated 'norwalk-like
viruses' (nlvs) cause significant health problems hospitals. hospital
outbreaks stockholm area 1996 investigated, order identify
the magnitude problem, mode transmission, effect control
measures genetic variability outbreak strains. determining the
epidemiological clinical significance involves broad range of
possibilities.
methods: ten hospitals, representing 66% hospitals stockholm area, 
participated study, included 211 wards. these, 18 selected
as control. standardized protocol included personal contacts was
administered. outbreak wards visited 5 10 times. wards 
reported outbreaks 1996 prospectively followed 1999 personal
contacts, available data 1991 outbreak reports collected. 
total 253 stool samples outbreaks 1996 analyzed electron
microscopy (em) presence nlvs. positive samples confirmed 
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr).
results: total, 4 326 patients 1 119 staff exposed 43 wards
that reported 54 outbreaks. mean attack rate 13% patients 21% for
staff. number outbreaks 1996 outnumbered reported outbreaks 
preceding years (4-70%) later years (35-40%). admission 24 (56%) the
outbreak wards stopped. mean duration illness patients 35
hours staff, 30 hours. main symptoms diarrhoea (80%) and
vomiting (68%). genotyping revealed majority hospital outbreaks
in stockholm area 1996 caused single nlv strain.
conclusions: study confirmed outbreaks nlv increasing
public-health problem hospitals. risk affected outbreak was
significantly greater wards reported outbreaks previous year. 
it obvious measures helped shorten outbreaks any
appreciable extent. different managements must therefore carefully interpreted
and adapted prevailing circumstances. genotyping strains an
important tool getting better insight transmission routes the
mechanism behind appearance epidemic strains.
