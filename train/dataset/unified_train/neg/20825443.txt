to determine frequency impact parvovirus b19 (b19v) infection 
its influence course haematological and/or oncological diseases in
paediatric patients, consecutive serum bone marrow samples 110 were
analyzed markers acute, past persistent b19v-infection using qpcr,
elisa westernline. twenty-seven 110 (24.5%) children suffered from
non-malignant diseases (anaemia, pancytopenia, autoimmune disorders); 68/110
(61.8%) patients developed leukaemia, malignant lymphoma solid malignant
tumours; 15/110 patients (13.6%) presented symptoms. admission,
b19v-specific igm igg indicating acute previous b19v-infection were
observed 5 (4.5%) 48 patients (43.6%), respectively. b19v-dna (10(3)
-10(9)  geq/ml) detectable serum and/or bone marrow 22 patients
(20.0%). suffered leukaemia (5), non-hodgkin lymphoma (2), solid
tumours (6), autoimmune (4) haematological (4) disease fever (1). 
clinical observation four leukaemia patients developed viraemia and
persistent b19v-infection observed 13/22 dna-positive patients. treatment 
of b19v-dna-positive cancer patients associated supportive therapy 
involving erythrocyte thrombocyte transfusion and/or antibiotic therapy.
acute b19v-infection frequently observed paediatric patients with
haematological and/or oncological disease. patients non-malignant
diseases anaemia autoimmune disorders diagnosed association with
b19v-infection. furthermore, significant number cancer patients displayed
markers acute, recent persistent b19v-infection. association may be
strengthened frequent treatment blood products combined therapeutic 
immune suppression. b19v-infected cancer patients supportive therapy 
complex.
