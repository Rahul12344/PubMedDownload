lupus-prone new zealand black new zealand white mice produce high serum
levels endogenous retroviral envelope protein gp70 develop ab
response autoantigen part autoimmune disease. linkage
analysis two crosses involving new zealand balb/c mice mapped traits
to group overlapping loci, including novel locus proximal chromosome
12. locus linked serum gp70 autoimmune response it.
the linkage serum gp70 levels previously described locus distal
chromosome 4 also confirmed. sequence analysis candidate gene distal 
chromosome 4, fv1, provided support gene may associated the
control serum gp70 levels new zealand black new zealand white
mice. linkage data statistical analysis confirmed close correlation between
gp70 ag anti-gp70 ab levels, together gave support concept 
threshold level gp70 required production anti-gp70 abs. serum
levels anti-gp70 abs closely correlated presence renal
disease, anti-dsdna abs. understanding genetic basis this
complex autoantigen-autoantibody system provide insight the
pathogenesis lupus mice, may implications human disease.
