human papillomavirus (hpv) testing used triage women a
borderline smear result. efficiency testing women low-grade
squamous intraepithelial lesion (lsil) atypical squamous cells of
undetermined significance (ascus) less clear. reason used new
hpv test detects e6/e7 messenger rna (mrna), might higher
specificity. objective prospective study assess whether hpv
e6/e7 mrna positivity women ascus lsil baseline, able to
predict women high risk developing histological cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia (cin2) worse lesion. took consideration 
women's age hpv dna genotype followed 3 years. cervical
samples women high-risk hpv (hr-hpv) dna-positive ascus (n = 90) or
lsil (n = 222) tested presence hr-hpv e6/e7 mrna women
were monitored development histopathologically verified cin2+.
thirteen patients ascus 17 lsil complete follow-up. all
patients lsil ascus, enrolled study, confirmed lesions at
the colposcopic examination. follow-up available 312 women, 193 were
positive hr-hpv dna test 93 hpv e6/e7 mrna positive test.
finally, 22 women positive hpv dna test high-risk genotypes with
positive e6/e7 mrna histologically confirmed cin2+. two cases with
negative hpv e6/e7 mrna cin2+. study shows women positive hpv
e6/e7 mrna test greater risk malignant progression cervical lesions 
and therefore deserve greater attention earlier check-ups.
