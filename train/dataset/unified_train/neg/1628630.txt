transgenic mice carrying either c-myc n-myc oncogene deregulated the
immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer element (e mu) develop pre-b b cell 
lymphomas (e mu-c-myc e mu-n-myc lymphomas). report b cell lines
derived tumors, well line derived v-myc retroviral
transformation, simultaneously express surface immunoglobulin (a hallmark of
mature b cells) well common subset genes normally restricted the
pre-b stage development-including recombinase activating genes rag-1 and
rag-2. continued rag-1 rag-2 expression lines associated vdj
recombinase activity detected vdj recombination substrate. cross-linking
of surface immunoglobulin lines anti-mu antibody leads to
rapid, specific reversible down-regulation rag-1 rag-2 gene
expression. also find small significant percentage normal
surface immunoglobulin bearing bone marrow b cells express rag-1 gene. 
findings discussed context possible implications the
control specific gene expression pre-b b cell transition.
