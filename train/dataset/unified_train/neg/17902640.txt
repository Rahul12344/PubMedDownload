the purpose discovery phase study identify candidate protein
biomarkers high-grade dysplastic cervical cells using mass spectrometry.
laser capture microdissection (lcm) utilized isolate high-grade dysplastic
and normal cells thinprep slides prepared cervical cytological
specimens. following cell capture, samples solubilized proteins
separated gel electrophoresis preparation enzymatic digestion and
liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis (lc-ms). processed samples 
subsequently analyzed using linear ion trap coupled fourier transform
mass spectrometer (ltq-ft ms). determined preservcyt solution
and thinprep pap stain (cytyc corporation) compatible sample
processing lc-ms analysis. total, 9 normal 9 abnormal cervical
cytological specimens, 1000 unique proteins identified high
confidence, based approximately 12,000 captured cells per specimen.
quantitative protein differences hsil (high-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesion) nilm (negative intraepithelial lesions or
malignancy) samples determined comparing intensities the
representative (label-free) peptide ions. 200 proteins found to
exhibit 3-fold difference protein level. interestingly, significant
up-regulation nuclear mitochondrial proteins hsil specimens noted. 
in several cases, increased protein abundance observed high-grade cells,
as determined quantitative lc-ms, validated immunocytochemical methods 
using thinprep cervical specimens. study additional clinical
specimens, differential abundance proteins high-grade dysplastic cells 
versus morphologically normal cervical cells may lead validated novel
biomarkers cervical disease.
