in experiments, protein synthesis host cells inhibited quickly the
early stage infection sindbis virus. polysome mrna host cell fell
off cytoskeletons, whereas virus rna bound up. also found via
3'-terminal virus rna bound cytoskeleton. studying virus
nonstructural proteins, found synthesis processing virus protein in
vitro far slowly vivo, proteins premature. so, 
cytoskeletons may play important role there. treated colchicine and
cytochalasin b, microtubule microfilament destroyed. however, the
synthesis processing nonstructural proteins sindbis virus change
much, structural proteins inhibited largely. results showed 
the differences dependence synthesis two kinds proteins on
cytoskeletons. microtubule microfilament may important the
synthesis structural proteins nonstructural proteins.
