we describe multicomponent antigen display delivery system using
bacteriophage t4. two dispensable outer capsid proteins, hoc (highly antigenic
outer capsid protein, 155 copies) soc (small outer capsid protein, 810
copies), decorate phage t4 capsid. proteins bind symmetrically
localized capsid sites, appear following prohead assembly expansion. we
hypothesized multiple antigens fused hoc displayed same
capsid particles elicit broad immunological responses. anthrax toxin
proteins, protective antigen (pa), lethal factor (lf), edema factor (ef), and
their functional domains, fused hoc n-terminal hexa-histidine tag
and recombinant proteins over-expressed e. coli purified. using a
defined vitro assembly system, anthrax-hoc fusion proteins were
efficiently displayed t4 capsid, either individually combinations. all
of 155 hoc binding sites occupied one antigen, split
among two antigens varying molar ratio binding reaction. 
immunization mice t4 phage carrying pa, lf, ef elicited strong
antigen-specific antibodies antigens well lethal toxin
neutralization titers. triple antigen t4 phage elicited stronger pa-specific 
immune responses phage displaying pa alone. features offer novel
avenues develop customized multicomponent vaccines anthrax other
pathogenic diseases.
