a cellular protein molecular mass approximately 36 kilodaltons the
presumed target protein src protein [the transforming protein encoded by
rous sarcoma virus (rsv)]. cellular location phosphorylated
36-kilo-dalton protein (pp36) chicken embryo fibroblasts transformed the
schmidt-ruppin strain rsv investigated. studies,
two-dimensional electrophoresis used detection phosphoproteins 
total cell extracts also fractionated subcellular components. conclude 
that pp36 localized plasma membrane, basis following
observations. (i) fractionation 32p-labeled cell extracts showed pp36 
almost exclusively localized crude membrane fraction appreciable
amount found nuclear cytoplasmic fractions. (ii) further
fractionation crude membrane fraction, pp36 localized mostly the
plasma membrane rather membranous fractions. (iii) isolated plasma 
membrane phosphorylated 36-kilodalton protein incubation with
[gamma-32p]atp.
