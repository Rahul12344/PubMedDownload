regenerative medicine need solid, large animal models link 
rodents humans evaluate functionality, immunogenicity, clinical
safety stem cell-derived cell types. common marmoset (callithrix jacchus) 
is excellent large animal model, genetically close humans readily used 
worldwide clinical research. now, two groups showed generation 
of induced pluripotent stem cells (ipscs) common marmoset using
integrating retroviral vectors. therefore, reprogrammed bone marrow-derived
mesenchymal cells (mscs) adult marmosets presence tav, sb431542,
pd0325901, ascorbic acid via novel, excisable lentiviral spleen
focus-forming virus (sffv)-driven quad-cistronic vector system (oct3/4, klf4,
sox2, c-myc). endogenous pluripotency markers like oct3/4, klf4, sox2, c-myc,
lin28, nanog, strong alkaline phosphatase signals detected. exogenous
genes silenced additionally cassette removed retroviral

all three germ layers. directed differentiation generated neural progenitors,
megakaryocytes, adipocytes, chondrocytes, osteogenic cells. thus, all
criteria fully reprogrammed bone marrow-mscs nonhuman primate a
genetically sophisticated construct could demonstrated. cells
