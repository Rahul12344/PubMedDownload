the rapid identification anti-hiv compounds laboratory following the
isolation causative virus 1983 subsequent use clinic
was unexpected. three decades previous work established scientific
basis evaluation antiviral compounds. however, antiviral yet
discovered cause total blockade virus replicating cell. the
combination properties hiv including latency, antigenic biochemical
variation unusual virus represents daunting challenge for
chemotherapy. least 90 antiviral compounds discovered, many
inhibiting virus reverse transcriptase. targets inhibition are
possible including viral regulatory gene products, viral protease and
endonuclease enzymes compounds initial study found by
random searching. x-ray crystallography hiv proteins shortly possible,
enabling commencement molecular specific search inhibitors.
meanwhile, advantage taken comparative nucleotide sequences the
hiv-1 -2 genomes test short oligonucleotides potential inhibitors of
mrna transcription. pol gene also zinc finger amino acid sequence
suggesting chelation chemotherapy may potential role. absence 
of hiv vaccines, associated theoretical problems development,
antiviral chemotherapy expected occupy central role combating aids
epidemic.
