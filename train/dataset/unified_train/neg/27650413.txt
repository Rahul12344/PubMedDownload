packaging eight genomic rna segments influenza viruses (iav) into
viral particles coordinated segment-specific packaging sequences. the
packaging signals regulate specific incorporation rna segment into
virions whether viral host factors involved process is
unknown. here, show distinct amino acids viral nucleoprotein (np) 
are required packaging specific rna segments. determined by
studying np bat influenza a-like virus, hl17nl10, context a
conventional iav (sc35m). replacement conserved sc35m np residues 
hl17nl10 np resulted rna packaging defective iav. surprisingly, substitution
of conserved sc35m amino acids hl17nl10 np residues led iav with
altered packaging efficiencies specific subsets rna segments. this
suggests np harbours amino acid code dictates genome packaging 
infectious virions.
