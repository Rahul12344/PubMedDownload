empty capsids foot-and-mouth disease virus (fmdv) type a22 iraq 24/64, whose
structure solved x-ray crystallography, unusual for
picornaviruses since contain vp2 vp4, cleavage products the
protein precursor vp0. n terminus vp1 c terminus vp4,
which pack together close icosahedral threefold symmetry axis three 
pentamers associate, disordered empty capsid the
rna-containing virus. ordering termini presence rna
strengthens interactions within single protomer protomers belonging
to different pentamers. disorder fmdv empty capsid forms subset of
that seen poliovirus empty capsid, vp0 intact. thus, vp0
cleavage confers stability picornavirus capsid that
attributable rna encapsidation. fmdv poliovirus empty capsids, the
internal disordering uncovers conserved histidine proposed be
involved cleavage vp0. comparison putative active sites in
fmdv poliovirus suggests structural explanation sequence
specificity cleavage reaction.
