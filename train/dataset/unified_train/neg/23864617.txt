it proposed herpes simplex virus 1 vp22 deleted requires
secondary mutation vhs viability. show a
replication-competent δ22 virus constructed homologous recombination maintains
a wild-type (wt) vhs gene gross mutations. contrast, δ22
viruses recovered bacterial artificial chromosome contain multiple amino
acid changes within conserved region vhs. hence, mode virus rescue
influences acquisition secondary mutations.
