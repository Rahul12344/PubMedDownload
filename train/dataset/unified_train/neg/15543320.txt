tissue factor (tf) blood coagulation initiator, whose cofactor function is
required physiological factor viia (fviia)-mediated activation factor x
(fx) fxa. previous study reported tf herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv1), 
but explained part fviia-dependent fxa generation observed the
virus surface (sutherland et al. (1997) proc. natl. acad. sci. usa. 94:13510-14).
in current study, investigated role hsv1-encoded glycoprotein c
(gc) process. purified gc-deficient hsv1 facilitated several fold less fx
activation fviia either wild type gc-rescued strains. confirm the
implication gc fviia-dependent fx activation, purified soluble gc (sgc)
enhanced fxa production absence tf. sgc required fviia, calcium and
anionic phospholipid participate fx activation, suggesting similarity to
tf. purified virus combined sgc, sgc-dependent fxa generation
was enhanced three orders magnitude, suggesting synergy additional
hsv1 component explaining relatively low activity purified sgc
compared viral counterpart. fx activation gc-competent hsv1 was
inhibited 20% gc-specific antibody, inhibited 40% tf-specific antibody,
inhibited 65% combining gc- tf-specific antibodies, nearly
completely inhibited tf antibody alone gc-deficient hsv-1.
cumulatively, observations show two pathways initiating fx activation 
function parallel virus surface. addition previously
described tf-dependent pathway, hsv-1-encoded gc also enhances fxa generation,
and like tf, requires fviia.
