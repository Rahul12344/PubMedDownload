we cloned analysed transcriptional properties two closely linked 
genes, p39 cg30, bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus (bmnpv). these
genes encode structural polypeptide putative transcriptional regulator of
the virus, respectively. cg30 gene transcribed prior dna
replication site located within orf adjacent p39 gene. its
transcription product, 1.3 kb mrna, polyadenylated site containing
consensus eukaryotic polyadenylation signals mapping 87 bp downstream 
translation termination codon cg30. later stages infection, two
additional rnas, 2.2 6.5 kb, also transcribed cg30 gene. 
2.2 kb rna, representing mrna encodes p39, initiated three
relatively closely spaced sites located upstream p39 orf. 6.5 kb rna
is apparently transcribed promoter sequences another gene located
further upstream p39 gene. 2.2 6.5 kb transcripts two
polyadenylation sites. first site one used generate the
cg30 gene-specific transcripts. second located 4 bp downstream cg30
translation termination codon. transient expression assays show p39 gene
sequences immediately upstream cg30 orf direct expression a
reporter gene latter co-transfected gene encoding early 
baculovirus trans-activator ie1. thus, sequences behave delayed-early 
baculovirus gene promoter.
