recently shown highly conserved herpes simplex virus
glycoprotein k (gk) binds signal peptide peptidase (spp), also known minor 
histocompatibility antigen h13. study demonstrated first 
time inhibitors spp, l685,458, (z-ll)2 ketone, aspirin, ibuprofen
and dapt, significantly reduced hsv-1 replication tissue culture. inhibition
of spp activity via (z-ll)2 ketone significantly reduced viral transcripts the
nucleus infected cells. finally, administered primary infection,
(z-ll)2 ketone inhibitor reduced hsv-1 replication eyes ocularly
infected mice. thus, blocking spp activity may represent clinically effective
and expedient approach reduction viral replication resulting
pathology.
