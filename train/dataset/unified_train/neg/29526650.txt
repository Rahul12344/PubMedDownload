mirnas potent tools principle used control replication 
of infectious agents. objectives studies reported design 
mirnas block replication herpes simplex virus 1 could
be delivered infected cells via exosomes. report following: (1) we
designed three mirnas targeting mrna encoding icp4, essential viral
regulatory protein. three mirnas, one mirna401 effectively blocked icp4
accumulation viral replication transfection susceptible cells. (2) to
facilitate packaging mirna exosomes, incorporated the
sequence mirna401 exosome-packaging motif. mirna401 shown be
packaged exosomes successfully delivered exosomes susceptible
cells, remained stable least 72 hr. finally, results show
that mirna401 delivered cells via exosomes effectively reduced virus yields in
a mirna401 dose-dependent fashion. protocol described report be
applied study viral gene functions without actually deleting mutagenizing
the gene.
