background: beginning late 2011 early 2012, increasing circulation of
antigenically drifted influenza a/victoria/361/2011-like h3n2 viruses within
genotype 3 a/victoria/208/2009 clade reported multiple
european countries elsewhere. whether emerging viruses associated
with increased disease severity unclear.
objectives: report clinical virological findings moderately
severe hospital outbreak a/victoria/361/2011-like viruses occurred in
november 2011 hong kong.
study design: clinical virological hospital outbreak investigation.
results: outbreak occurred adult psychiatric ward november 2011, a
time well usual local seasonal influenza winter peak. altogether, 7
patients 1 healthcare-worker affected (mean age, 47 [range, 34-61]
years). attack rates among patients healthcare-workers 33% (7/21)
and 7% (1/15), respectively. pneumonia developed 38% (3/8) cases; none 
underlying immunocompromised conditions. high nasopharyngeal viral loads were
detected. cases responded antiviral treatment. multiple amino acid
mutations reference earlier a(h3n2) vaccine strains mapped key
antigenic sites hemagglutinin; however, critical mutations receptor
binding sites detected. viral sequence variations jeopardized the
performance molecular diagnostic assays.
conclusions: severe disease pneumonia occurred substantial proportion of
non-immunocompromised adults hospital outbreak attributed emerging
antigenically drifted a/victoria/361/2011-like h3n2 viruses. close monitoring 
the transmission drift variant required. studies also
necessary determine virus virulence.
