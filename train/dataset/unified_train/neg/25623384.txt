background: recent years, number serious disease outbreaks caused by
viruses viroids greenhouse tomatoes north america resulted in
significant economic losses growers. objectives study to
evaluate effectiveness commercial disinfectants mechanical
transmission pathogens, select disinfectants broad spectrum 
reactivity control general virus viroid diseases greenhouse tomato
production.
methods: total 16 disinfectants evaluated pepino mosaic virus
(pepmv), potato spindle tuber viroid (pstvd), tomato mosaic virus (tomv), and
tobacco mosaic virus (tmv). efficacy disinfectant deactivate the
pathogen's infectivity evaluated replicate experiments least three
independent experiments. infectivity remained treated solutions
was assessed bioassays susceptible tomato plants mechanical
inoculation using inocula exposed individual disinfectant 
for three short time periods (0-10 sec, 30 sec 60 sec). positive infection 
on inoculated plant determined symptom observation confirmed 
with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (pepmv, tomv, tmv) real-time
reverse transcription-pcr (pstvd). experimental data analyzed using logistic
regression bayesian methodology.
results: statistical analyses using logistic regression bayesian
methodology indicated two disinfectants (2% virkon 10% clorox regular 
bleach) effective prevent transmission pepmv, pstvd, tomv,
and tmv mechanical inoculation. lysol all-purpose cleaner (50%) nonfat
dry milk (20%) also effective tomv tmv, partial
effects pepmv pstvd.
conclusion: broad spectrum efficacy three common viruses a
viroid, several disinfectants, including 2% virkon s, 10% clorox regular bleach
and 20% nonfat dry milk, recommend greenhouse facilities consideration
to prevent general virus viroid infection tomato plants.
