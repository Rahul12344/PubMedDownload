glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (gpi)-anchored proteins contain their
cooh-terminal region peptide segment thought direct glycolipid
addition. signal shown require pair small amino acids
positioned 10-12 residues upstream hydrophobic c-terminal domain. we
analysed contribution region separating anchor acceptor site and
the c-terminal hydrophobic segment introducing amino acid deletions and
substitutions spacer element gpi-anchored thy-1 glycoprotein.
deletions 7 amino acids region, well introduction 2
charged residues, prevented glycolipid addition thy-1, suggesting the
length primary sequence spacer domain important determinants
in signal directing gpi anchor transfer onto newly synthesized polypeptide.
furthermore, tested rules creating truncated form normally
transmembranous herpes simplex virus glycoprotein (gdi) demonstrating
that c-terminal region displays features gpi-anchored
protein, able direct glycolipid addition onto another cell surface
molecule.
