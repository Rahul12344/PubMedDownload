malnutrition, weight loss, body cell mass (bcm) depletion long been
observed individuals hiv infection acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
and associated increased morbidity mortality. nutritional status may
be adversely affected many factors, including inadequate intake,
gastrointestinal disturbances, altered nutrient metabolism, and
medication-related side effects. increasing numbers hiv-infected individuals
are exhibiting fat redistribution characterized combination changes
including peripheral fat atrophy, visceral dorsocervical adiposity, other
changes, changes shown associated increased
cardiovascular disease risk. complete nutrition assessment key effective 
patient management hiv infection. review focuses evaluation of
anthropometry (including bcm fat redistribution), biochemistries,
medication-related issues, medical/social/dietary histories, physical
examination clinical findings. discussion bcm, significance a
parameter nutritional status, methodological issues concerning its
measurement available technologies presented light current research. 
methods assessing fat redistribution discussed. recommendations for
biochemical assessment medical, social, dietary histories reviewed.
finally, medication-related side effects common antiretroviral therapies 
clinical findings may affect nutritional status presented. clearly,
nutrition assessment hiv infection complex process involving many
factors.
