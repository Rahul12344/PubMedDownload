recombinant rf (replicate form) dnas containing bacteriophage phi x174 gene
a protein-recognition sequence cleaved phi x protein yielding phi 
x rf ii x protein complex (zipursky, s.l., reinberg, d., hurwitz, j. (1980)
proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. 77, 5182-5186). complexes support dna
synthesis rf leads ss(c) rf leads rf phi x dna
replication reactions vitro. two phi x protein-recognition sequences were
inserted plasmid pbr322. sequences contiguous strand
of vector dna separated 667 4275 base pairs. recombinant
plasmid (g27-4) cleaved phi x protein either insert both
inserts support initiation rf leads ss(c) dna synthesis. was
verified finding replication products circular molecules 667 
and 4275 nucleotides. finding keeping multifunctional
activities associated phi x protein; include site-specific
nicking rf dna initiates dna synthesis site-specific termination
resulting circularization displaced dna strand. phi x protein
and escherichia coli rep ssb proteins catalyze unwinding phi x rf 
i dna vitro (scott, j.f., eisenberg, s., bertsch, l.l., kornberg, a.
(1977) proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. 74, 193-197). recombinant plasmid g27-4 rf i
dna also unwound vitro enzyme system; case, circular 
and linear single-stranded dna molecules 667 4275 nucleotides, well 
full length circular single-stranded dna formed. full length linear dna 
not detected. two single-stranded circular dna products formed leading
strands rf leads ss(c) reaction mixtures containing g27-4 rf dna differed
in ability support lagging strand dna synthesis. shown the
large single-stranded circular product included dna sequences homologous a
replication factor effector sequence required rf leads rf ss(c)
leads rf replication (zipursky, s.l., marians, k.j. (1980) proc. natl.
acad. sci. u.s.a. 77, 6521-6525). 4275-nucleotide, the
667-nucleotide, single-stranded circular dna product converted duplex
structure.
