1-(2-fluoro-5-methyl-beta-l-arabinofuranosyl)uracil (l-fmau), l isomer of
fmau, shown potent activity hepatitis b virus epstein-barr virus.
l-fmau showed double peaks plasma concentration versus time profiles
following oral administration rats, indicating discontinuous oral absorption. 
the objective study characterize bioavailability pattern
of l-fmau absorption using pharmacokinetic model incorporated two
separate absorption processes following oral administration nucleoside 
an animal model, rat. simultaneous fitting differential equations to
l-fmau plasma concentrations following oral intravenous administration was
performed using pcnonlin. total clearance l-fmau moderate, averaging 0.47 
+/- 0.16 l h-1 (mean +/- sd). distributional clearance averaged 0.18 +/- 0.14 l
h-1. volume central compartment averaged 0.30 +/- 0.09 l, the
volume peripheral compartment averaged 0.15 +/- 0.08 l. first-order
absorption rate constants describing first second absorption phases
averaged 1.22 +/- 1.56 4.14 +/- 5.42 h-1, respectively. oral bioavailability 
was calculated three methods: auc, urinary excretion data, discontinuous
oral absorption pharmacokinetic model. bioavailability averaged 0.59 +/- 0.16,
0.64 +/- 0.23, 0.63 +/- 0.13, respectively, three methods. the
discontinuous oral absorption pharmacokinetic model promising new method for
estimating absorption two phases calculating oral bioavailability.
