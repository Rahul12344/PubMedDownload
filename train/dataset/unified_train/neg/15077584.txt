a compact structure hepatitis b virus genome provide much space
for development mutations capable replication. spite that, 7 
genotypes described far. discovery hepatitis b virus (hbv)
genome diversity led range questions. individual genotypes are
subjects investigation days pattern disease transmission, 
course disease, consequences infection. aim pilot study 
was describe genotype distribution infected population czech
republic. moreover, epidemiological clinical characteristics monitored
in sample. studied group 65 patients positive hbsag which
48 samples patients genotyped. pcr (polymerase chain reaction) method was
used order amplify region hbv genome. direct sequencing pcr
products used, accurate method genotype identification. 
a relatively uniform genotypic distribution identified within study
population--only 2 genotypes, d, found. genotype identified in
35 (73%) patients genotype 13 (27%) patients. statistically
significant association particular genotype epidemiological and
clinical parameters proved pilot study. study brings basic
information genotype distribution. possible proof correlation with
clinical epidemiological characteristics require examination larger
sample patients.
