the effect penciclovir acyclovir replication herpes simplex
virus type 1 (hsv-1) type 2 (hsv-2) strains determined mrc-5 cells
infected 0.01 pfu/cell exposed drugs 72 h allow multiple
cycles replication. penciclovir significantly active acyclovir
against three strains hsv-1 three strains hsv-2 1 mg/l (p = 0.009), 
3 mg/l (p < 0.001) 10 mg/l (p = 0.001). comparisons the
compounds made mrc-5 cells infected hsv-1 strain sc16 using four
different antiviral assays namely, 24 h virus yield reduction assay, plaque
reduction assay, viral antigen inhibition assay, viral dna inhibition
assay, determine relative merits each. penciclovir acyclovir shared
similar activities plaque reduction assay (with 50% effective
concentrations, ec50, 0.8 0.6 mg/l, respectively) viral
antigen inhibition assay (ec50s. 0.6 0.7 mg/l, respectively). ec50 of
penciclovir 24 h viral dna inhibition assay 0.01 mg/l compared with
0.06 mg/l acyclovir. 24 h virus yield reduction assay mrc-5
cells infected 0.3 pfu/cell, penciclovir active acyclovir
with 99% effective concentrations 0.6 mg/l 1.1 mg/l, respectively. the
activity penciclovir 24 h virus yield reduction antigen inhibition 
assays inversely related multiplicity infection, whereas had
considerably less effect inhibition viral dna synthesis. results 
suggest famciclovir, oral form penciclovir, least
as effective acyclovir treating infections caused hsv-1 hsv-2.
