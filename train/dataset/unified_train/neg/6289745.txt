buffalo green monkey kidney cells adapted grow shaker cultures.
replication environmental clinical isolates poliovirus, coxsackievirus,
and echovirus cultures analyzed plaque assay compared with
replication buffalo green monkey kidney cell monolayers hep-2 cell shaker 
cultures. dose-response tests various concentrations mahoney type 1
poliovirus indicated buffalo green monkey kidney cell shaker cultures could 
detect little 1 pfu inoculum 0.2 ml. data suggest that
buffalo green monkey kidney cell shaker cultures effectively used 
detection small quantities enteroviruses environmental sources.
