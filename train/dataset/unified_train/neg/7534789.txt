we previously reported identification, using human immune sera, of
mimotopes human hepatitis b virus surface ag (hbsag) displayed filamentous 
phage. test mimotopes could useful developing vaccine against
the human hepatitis b virus (hbv), compared humoral immune response
of animals immunized either recombinant hbsag vaccine, mimotopes. 
immunogens prepared fusing mimotopes different carrier molecules
(phage coat protein piii pviii, recombinant human h ferritin, hbv core
peptide) synthesizing multiple antigenic peptides carrying mimotopes' 
amino acid sequences. immunogens injected mice rabbits and
sera collected tested presence hbsag-specific abs. data
confirm mimotopes induce humoral immune response resembling that
induced original ag, hbsag mimotopes displayed phage prove be
the best immunogens, inducing reproducible potent immunization.
mimotopes react hbv subtype-specific ags show specificity 
immunogen induce nonsubtype-restricted response. furthermore, mimotopes
displayed phage elicit strong response hbsag strain mouse
reported show low response it. results indicate mimotopes
identified random peptide libraries utilizing human immune sera
could important leads derivation new vaccines.
