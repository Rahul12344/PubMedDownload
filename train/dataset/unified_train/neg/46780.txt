the effect different preparative procedures electron microscopy the
size shape murine oncornaviruses studied. conventional
negative staining procedures using neutral sodium phosphotungstate, murine
mammary tumor virus murine leukemia virus appeared head-and-tail forms,
with peak head diameter 122 130 nm, respectively. negative staining with
uranyl accetate gave round virions peak diameters 148 130 nm.
prefixed virus round peak diameters 141 130 nm, respectively, 
phosphotungstate, 148 117 nm, respectively, uranyl acetate. thin 
sections, peak diameters 143 123 nm. preservation the
spherical shape virus obtained glutaraldehyde fixation dehydration 
in alcholic solutions uranyl acetate, critical point drying. these
conditions viruses peak diameters 99 82 nm, respectively. size
of murine mammary tumor virus always found larger murine
leukemia virus preparations except negative staining neutral
sodium phosphotungstate. shadowing virion preparations revealed
considerable flattening particles cases except critical point
drying. negatively stained preparations cast shadow, thus
thethickness particles could evaluated. virus reversibly
converted spherical head-and-tail forms altering osmotic strength.
under conditions used, murine mammary tumor virus gave bimodal size
distribution significant numbers particles smaller the
major virus size.
