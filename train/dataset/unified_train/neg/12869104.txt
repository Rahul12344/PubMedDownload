background: west nile virus (wnv) epidemic 2002 us saw 3300
reported human cases wnv disease, 2300 reported cases wnv
encephalitis meningitis. first documented cases transfusion
transmission wnv voluntary blood donation also occurred.
study design methods: case onset dates 2002 wnv epidemic us
were used estimate risk transfusion-associated transmission with
statistical resampling. easily computed approximating formula mean
risk derived. estimates computed six high-incidence states and
metropolitan areas.
results: mean maximum risk transfusion-associated wnv transmission (per
10,000 donations) epidemic period selected states ranged 
2.12 4.76 4.34 10.46, respectively; selected metropolitan 
areas, ranged 1.46 12.33 3.02 21.32, respectively.
conclusions: estimates mean risk wnv transmission transfusion ranged
from 1.46 12.33 per 10,000 donations six high-incidence metropolitan areas
during 2002 epidemic. risk highly geographically and
temporally variable, computation geographically localized estimates is
recommended. derived approximating formula mean risk performed well
for estimates given.
