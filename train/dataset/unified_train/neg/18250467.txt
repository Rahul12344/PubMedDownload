infection pathogenic influenza virus induces severe pulmonary immune
pathology, specific cell types cause determined. 
we characterized inflammatory cell types mice overexpress mcp-1 (ccl2) in
the lungs, examined cells influenza infection wild-type (wt)
mice. lungs naive surfactant protein c-mcp mice influenza-infected wt
mice contain increased numbers ccr2(+) monocytes, monocyte-derived dc (modc), 
and exudate macrophages (exmacs). adoptively transferred gr-1(+) monocytes give
rise modc exmacs influenza-infected lungs. modc, common
inflammatory cell type infected lungs, induce robust naive cell
proliferation produce synthase 2 (nos2), whereas exmacs produce high
levels tnf-alpha nos2 stimulate proliferation memory cells.
relative wt mice, influenza-infected ccr2-deficient mice display marked
reductions accumulation monocyte-derived inflammatory cells, cells
producing nos2, expression costimulatory molecules, markers lung
injury, weight loss, mortality. conclude ccr2(+) monocyte-derived
cells predominant cause immune pathology influenza infection
and pathology markedly abrogated absence ccr2.
