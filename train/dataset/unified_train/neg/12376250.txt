objective: clone dna tt virus (ttv) variant isolated patient
with elevated alanine transaminase (alt) unknown etiology, conduct
sequence analysis.
methods: long fragment ttv dna amplified nested pcr cloned
into pgem-t vector. clone named 56-b containing 3.2 kb ttv dna selected for
sequence analysis besides homology analysis 5 ttv variants retrieved
from genbank, phylogenetic analysis carried maximum likelihood
method.
results: nucleotide identities 56-b 5 ttv strains ta278,
ja10, us35, sanban tus01 42.4%, 48.2%, 47.9%, 49.8 % 61.7 %
respectively, corresponding amino acid identities even lower.
phylogenetic analysis showed 56-b far ttv strains genetic 
distance ranged 0.344 0.458. however, sequences 5'- and
3'-end still much conservative.
conclusion: isolated 56-b showed high heterogeneity genetic background and
was therefore quite distinct ttv strains novel ttv variant that
represents new ttv genotype.
