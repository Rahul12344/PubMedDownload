infectious laryngotracheitis (ilt) virus strains studied ability
to infect chicken macrophages, lymphocytes, kidney cells vitro. although
macrophages susceptible chicken kidney cells infection, replication
of virus strains macrophages markedly restricted. isolates
induced progressive infections macrophages, even donor of
the macrophages influenced replication. thus, appears cell genotype 
and virus genotype may help determine extent restriction virus
replication. macrophages susceptible attenuated vaccine strain of
ilt virus virulent virus strains. spleen lymphocytes, peripheral blood
lymphocytes, thymocytes, bursal lymphocytes, buffy coat leukocytes, activated
t-cells nearly totally refractory infection ilt virus.
