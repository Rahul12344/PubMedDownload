we studied impact etoposide prognosis 81 patients (77 whom
were children <15 years old) epstein-barr virus-associated hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (ebv-hlh). study group received median cumulative dose 
of 1,500 mg/m2 etoposide (range, 0-14,550 mg/m2), median follow-up period 
of 44 months (range, 20-88 months) diagnosis. 1 patient, who
received 3150 mg/m2 etoposide, developed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia
(t-aml), 31 months diagnosis. excluding 9 patients underwent
hemopoietic stem cell transplantation course treatment, the
prognosis poorer patients received less 1,000 mg/m2
cumulative dose etoposide. results indicate risk of
etoposide-related t-aml low. appropriate dosage etoposide the
treatment ebv-hlh would range 1,000 3,000 mg/m2. however, even
at doses, care must taken prevent rare risk t-aml.
