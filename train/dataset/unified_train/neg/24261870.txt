the u.s. agricultural sector vulnerable intentionally introduced microbial 
threats wide open distribution economic importance. to
investigate events, forensically valid assays plant pathogen detection
are needed. work, real-time pcr assays developed three model
plant pathogens: pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato, xylella fastidiosa, and
wheat streak mosaic virus. validation included determination linearity and
range, limit detection, sensitivity, specificity, exclusivity each
assay. additionally, positive control plasmids, distinguishable native
signature restriction enzyme digestion, developed support forensic
application assays. assay displayed linear amplification target
nucleic acid, detected 100 fg less target nucleic acid, specific to
its target pathogen. results obtained model pathogens provide the
framework development validation similar assays plant
pathogens high consequence.
