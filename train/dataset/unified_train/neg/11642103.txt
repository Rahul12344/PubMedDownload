failure drug therapy duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) stimulated intense
search adequate methods gene therapy (gt) would ensure effective
delivery dystrophin (d) gene, long-term persistence transfected
cells, expression muscle fibers. main results experimental 
gt dmd use viral nonviral delivery gene muscles 
of biological models discussed. delivery mini-gene specific 
muscle promoter using modified adenoassociated virus currently most
promising method, soon available clinical trials. main
results studies dmd gt russia summarized. results of
experiments genetic transfection mdx mice marker genes various
constructions gene outlined. genes delivered muscles 
by means gene gun, electroporation, viral oligopeptides, liposomes,
microspheres, lactoferine, nonviral vehicles. emphasized that
consolidation funds efforts russian laboratories dealing gene 
and cell therapy dmd necessary complete experiments start
clinical trials.
