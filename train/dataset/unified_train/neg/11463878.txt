the ability transcriptional activation domains (tads) signal
ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis suggests involvement the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway transcription. probe involvement, we
asked ubiquitylation regulates activity transcription factor
containing vp16 tad. show vp16 tad signals ubiquitylation through
the met30 ubiquitin-ligase met30 also required vp16 tad to
activate transcription. requirement met30 transcription is
circumvented fusion ubiquitin vp16 activator, demonstrating that
activator ubiquitylation essential transcriptional activation. propose 
that ubiquitylation regulates tad function serving dual signal for
activation activator destruction.
