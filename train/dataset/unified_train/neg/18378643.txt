noroviruses (nov) major cause nonbacterial gastroenteritis. however,
there published study ascertain survival foodstuffs are
directly related human health risk. present study, developed a
rapid, simple, sensitive real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification 
(nasba) combined enzymatic treatment distinguishing infectious from
noninfectious human nov. developed method validated using spiked
ready-to-eat food samples. feline calicivirus (fcv) used nov
surrogate preliminary assays, appeared sensitive heat
inactivation enzymatic pretreatment human nov. suggests that
fcv may ideal model studying nov. results reveal clearly that
the developed enzymatic pretreatment/real-time nasba combination successfully
distinguished infectious heat-inactivated nov. moreover, demonstrate 
that nov survived least 10 days refrigerated ready-to-eat foods, such
as lettuce turkey. however, survival rate higher turkey on
lettuce, probably different surface natures. approach
developed study may suitable in-depth studies the
persistence inactivation human nov may applied other
nonculturable rna viruses. moreover, evaluation infectious nov survival
provided valuable information concerning persistence ready-to-eat food.
