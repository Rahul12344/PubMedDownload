k+ high concentrations (52-72 mm hypertonic kcl) reported induce
reverse transformation 6m2 cell, clone normal rat kidney
cells (nrk) infected temperature-sensitive transformation virus. when
exposed high k+, 6m2 cells grown permissive temperature (33 degrees c) 
exhibit normal morphology reduced soft agar growth, characteristics cells 
grown nonpermissive temperature (39 degrees c). current study,
flattening cells rearrangement surface microvilli demonstrated 
scanning electron microscopy occur within 6 hr exposure high k+, similar
to effect temperature shift 39 degrees c. exposure k+ resulted 
90% inhibition p85gag-mos-associated serine kinase activity within 5 min, with
a subsequent reduction 75% synthesis protein. these
alterations putative transforming protein similar induced by
temperature shift considered basis retrotransformation.
the cell microtubular system f-actin cables affected slowly k+
than temperature shift 39 degrees c. former achieve fine 
reticulum network seen nrk cells 72 hr later, latter remained
aberrant. effect enzyme might mediated alteration in
phosphorylation, mechanism kinase inactivation induces
retrotransformation yet known.
