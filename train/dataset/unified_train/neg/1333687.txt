immune response laboratory rodents (guinea-pigs, cba balb/c mice, wistar
and august rats) inactivated hepatitis vaccine quantitatively assessed. 
under comparable conditions experiment, mice showed highest antibody
titres capable reacting lower doses immunogen; meanwhile
their individual variations immune response pronounced; white rats
were least susceptible vaccine, demonstrating minimal antibody
formation; guinea-pigs produced antibody intermediate levels antibody 
titres homogeneous. enhancing effect aluminium hydroxide was
observed guinea-pigs examined late postimmunization stage. differences 
in immunogenicity three vaccine lots essentially similar lots 
were tested undiluted preparations guinea-pigs mice mean antibody
titres mice 50% immune response using serial dilutions vaccine. all
three tests could routinely employed vaccine immunogenicity control.
