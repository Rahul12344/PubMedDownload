hepatitis c virus (hcv) major causative pathogen associated liver
cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma. virus positive-sense rna genome
encoding single polyprotein virion components located the
n-terminal portion. biosynthesis polyprotein, internal signal
sequence core protein envelope protein e1 targets nascent
polypeptide endoplasmic reticulum (er) membrane translocation e1
into er. following membrane insertion, signal sequence cleaved e1
by signal peptidase. provide evidence cleavage signal
peptidase, signal peptide processed intramembrane-cleaving 
protease spp promotes release core protein er membrane. core
protein free subsequent trafficking lipid droplets. study
represents example potential role intramembrane proteolysis the
maturation viral protein.
