background aim: many individuals gastrointestinal symptoms seek
medical attention little known pathogens involved in
most cases community gastroenteritis. aimed identify pathogens
responsible community gastroenteritis examine associated symptoms.
methods: prospective study 2811 subjects 15 months, fecal pathogens 
were examined following highly credible gastroenteritis (hcg) events. the
population consisted family units least two children (< =15
years-old) two adults each. fecal samples tested range of
bacterial, viral protozoal pathogens. gastroenteric episode duration and
symptoms vomiting, nausea diarrhea measured.
results: one pathogens identified 198 total 791 specimens
collected. pathogens detected often norovirus virus (10.7%), pathogenic
e. coli (6.7%), campylobacter spp. (3.0%) giardia sp. (2.5%). children were
more prone adults pathogens tested, except e. coli. children
infected campylobacter 8.3 times likely (95% ci: 2.7-25.4) have
a longer duration diarrhea children norovirus (p < 0.001).
similarly, children infected e. coli increased persistence diarrhea
compared norovirus (or = 3.5; 95% ci: 1.3-9.5; p = 0.02). infection with
norovirus children meant greater persistence vomiting symptoms than
infection campylobacter (p = 0.005), e. coli (p = 0.03), pathogen
was identified (p = 0.004). adults usually vomited fewer days children
while duration diarrhea similar children.
conclusions: many pathogens responsible cases gastroenteritis in
the australian community likely go undetected current surveillance
systems routine clinical practice.
