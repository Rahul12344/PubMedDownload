mammalian orthoreoviruses important models studies viral pathogenesis.
in rat lung, reovirus strain type 3 dearing (t3d) induces substantially 
inflammation strain type 1 lang (t1l). better understand mechanisms 
underlying differences host inflammatory response elicited t1l t3d,
we characterized cytokine expression patterns induced strains after
infection thp-1 monocyte cells. thp-1 cells adsorbed either viable
or ultraviolet- inactivated t1l t3d assayed mrna protein
production growth-regulated oncogene-alpha (gro-alpha), interleukin-8 (il-8), 
or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha). t3d stimulated mrna protein
production three cytokines, whereas t1l stimulated mrna protein
production il-8 tnf-alpha gro-alpha. case, t3d induced
greater cytokine mrna protein expression t1l. nonviable virus did
not stimulate detectable cytokine secretion, suggesting requirement viral
rna synthesis cytokine induction thp-1 cells. greater percentage thp-1
cells infected t1l t3d assessed infectious center assay, 
t1l achieved higher yields infectious progeny t3d infected thp-1
cells determined plaque assay. strain-dependent differences in
cytokine responses corresponding replication patterns monocyte cells
parallel findings made studies rat models pneumonia provide clues
about reovirus interfaces host innate immune response produce
pulmonary disease.
