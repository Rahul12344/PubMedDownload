function tests tested presence ttv sera. serum samples
were tested ttv dna genotype polymerase chain reaction (pcr). ttv dna 
was detected 15 35 patients (43%) non-a-e hepatitis, 14 33 patients
(42%) hepatitis c, 8 28 patients (29%) hepatitis a, 7 29 patients
(24%) hepatitis b, 37 100 subjects normal liver function tests
(37%). detection rate differ statistically non-a-e hepatitis 
and hepatitis a, b, c, controls. distribution ttv genotypes similar
in non-a-e, a, b, c types, controls. clinical characteristics the
acute illnesses similar patients without ttv hepatitis
