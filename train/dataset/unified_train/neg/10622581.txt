treatment chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection naive patients with
interferon alpha alone combination ribavirin reviewed. two
placebo-controlled randomised studies including 150 patients shown that
ribavirin single therapy standard dosage (15 mg/kg bodyweight two
divided doses daily) reduces alt levels transiently therapy, whereas 
hcv rna levels substantially reduced. interferon alpha (ifn) alone at
standard dosage (3 mu t.i.w.) given 12 months results sustained
virological response (sr) rates 15-25% depending genotype and
baseline hcv rna levels. ribavirin combination alpha interferon, in
standard doses 6-12 months significantly improves sustained biochemical
and virological response rates 2-3 times compared ifn alone 12 months.
in future, combination therapy become standard therapy naive
patients, least unfavourable viral parameters high
baseline viral load (>2-3 million ge/ml serum) genotype 1a+1b. patients
with favourable baseline viral characteristics (genotypes 2 3, irrespective
of viral load) 6 months combination therapy likely sufficient,
whereas unfavourable viral baseline characteristics need longer
combination treatment. genotype baseline viral load need assessed 
to optimise choice therapy. many questions must still answered, as
the optimal dose ribavirin ifn combination regimens, optimal
treatment length. furthermore, induction treatment used combination 
regimens? regimen used patients advanced disease
such cirrhosis decompensation?
