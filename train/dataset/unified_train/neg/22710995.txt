genetic complexity hiv-1 brought recombination hiv-1
subtypes leads development epidemiologically significant founder 
strains. present study, near full-length genome sequence hiv-1
isolate injecting drug user manipur (india) determined, which
evidenced presence novel hiv-1 bc recombinant strain. near full-length
genome amplified polymerase chain reaction using primer walking approach. 
the recombination break points detected using bootscan simplot analyses.
this isolate exhibited mosaic structure consisting subtype c backbone with
subtype b insertions upstream pol gene (3026-3259) downstream
of env gene spanned till nef gene (8183-8961). phylogenetic
relationships determined neighbor-joining trees, revealed subtype c
sequences clustered sequences indian subtype c hiv-1 strains, the
subtype b sequences clustered hiv-1 subtype b strains thailand. this
finding may create complex scenario hiv-1 epidemic among injecting drug 
users manipur near future.
