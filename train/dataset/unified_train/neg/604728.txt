from 18 horses clinical symptoms affection central nervous
system histopathologic alterations brain, four demonstrated 
to bornavirus-specific antibodies. antibodies monospecific,
recognizing identical antigens infected brains different animal species
as well persistently infected tissue culture cells. discrete
immunoglobulin species (oligoclonal igg) demonstrated concentrated
horse cerebrospinal fluid; carry bornavirus antibody specificity. their
presence, together higher antibody titers cerebrospinal fluid 
compared serum, indicate natural bornavirus
infections local antibody production occurred central nervous system.
