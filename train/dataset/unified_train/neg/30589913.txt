background: number predictors ebola mortality been
identified, less known post-viral symptoms. identification of
acute-illness predictors post-viral symptoms could allow selection of
patients active follow future, early
interventions may beneficial long term. studying predictors both
mortality post-viral symptoms within single cohort patients could also
further understanding pathophysiology survivor sequelae.
methods/principal findings: performed historical cohort study using data
collected part routine clinical care ebola treatment centre (etc)
in kerry town, sierra leone, order identify predictors mortality 
post-viral symptoms. variables included potential predictors sex, age,
date admission, first recorded viral load etc symptoms (recorded
upon presentation etc). multivariable logistic regression used to
identify predictors. 263 ebola-confirmed patients admitted november
2014 march 2015, 151 (57%) survived etc discharge. viral load the
strongest predictor mortality (adjusted comparing high low viral load:
84.97, 95% ci 30.87-345.94). find evidence high viral load
predicted post-viral symptoms (ocular: 1.17, 95% ci 0.35-3.97; musculoskeletal:
1.07, 95% ci 0.28-4.08). ocular post-viral symptoms common females
(2.31, 95% ci 0.98-5.43) experienced hiccups the
acute phase (4.73, 95% ci 0.90-24.73).
conclusions/significance: findings may add epidemiological support the
hypothesis post-viral symptoms immune-mediated aspect may not
only consequence high viral load disease severity.
