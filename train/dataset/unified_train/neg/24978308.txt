influenza virus remains significant concern public health, the
continued potential high fatality pandemic. vaccination antiviral
therapeutics effective measures circumvent influenza virus infection,
however, multiple strains emerged resistant antiviral
therapeutics currently market. considered, investigation of
alternative antiviral therapeutics conducted. one approach to
inhibit cleavage activation influenza virus hemagglutinin (ha), is
an essential step viral replication cycle permits viral-endosome
fusion. therefore, targeting trypsin-like, host proteases responsible ha
cleavage vivo may prove effective therapeutic. hepatocyte growth
factor activator inhibitor 2 (hai-2) naturally expressed respiratory
tract potent inhibitor trypsin-like serine proteases, which
have determined cleave ha. study, demonstrate hai-2 an
effective inhibitor cleavage ha human-adapted h1 h3 subtypes. 
hai-2 inhibited influenza virus h1n1 infection cell culture, hai-2
administration showed protection mouse model influenza. hai-2 the
potential effective, alternative antiviral therapeutic influenza.
