several non-culture molecular (multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays, dna
microarrays, massive parallel dna sequencing, situ hybridization, microbiome
profiling, molecular typing pathogens) analytical (electrophoresis,
gel electrophoresis, surface-enhanced raman scattering, mass spectrometry)
tools developed recent years identification bacteria 
diagnosis bacterial infections clinical samples. among mass spectrometric
techniques, electrospray ionization (esi) rapid evaporative ionization (rei) 
mass spectrometric (ms) techniques attracted much attention the
identification microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses), the
diagnosis various bacterial infections. review highlights developed
esi-ms-based methods, including polymerase chain reaction (pcr) combined with
esi-ms capillary electrophoresis (ce) liquid chromatography (lc)-esi-ms, 
for identification microorganisms (pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and
viruses) various samples. recent applications esi- rei-ms in
identifying pathogenic bacteria depicted tables, significant
findings summarized.
