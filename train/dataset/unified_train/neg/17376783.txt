in course viral infection, immune system exploits fraction of
the available ctl repertoire focuses myriad potentially
antigenic peptides. phenomenon, known immunodominance, depends a
number factors, including antigen processing transport, mhc binding,
competition antigen-presenting cells, availability cd8 cell
repertoire mechanisms function largely restricting immune
response. elucidate novel mechanism increases immunodominance 
of epitope rather enhancing immune response. using peptide-specific 
mhc-restricted mab functional assays ctl activation, show cells 
with high avidity immunodominant, h-2d(d) restricted, p18-i10 epitope
expand rapidly following immunization, expansion turn determines 
level p18-i10 epitope immunodominance. proliferation little
dependence number mhc-peptide complexes. since self-reactive t
cells high avidity depleted thymus, selection immunodominant
epitopes based expansion high-avidity cells periphery reduces 
the potential autoimmunity.
