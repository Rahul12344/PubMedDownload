to determine effect disinfectants viruses vitro, devised 
micro-carrier-test dry-fixed virus-infected cells. human immunodeficiency
virus type 1-infected molt-4 cells (1 x 10(5) cells 5 microliters 10% fetal
bovine serum) dry-fixed bottom well 96-well
flat-bottomed microtiter plate 120 minutes room temperature. disinfectants
were added allowed remain designated times wells washed
three times pbs. uninfected molt-4 cells (1 x 10(4) cells/well) were
inoculated cultured 4 weeks. culture supernatant harvested to
measure reverse transcriptase activity non-radioisotopic reverse transcriptase
assay every week. residual cytotoxicity disinfectant determined by
cytotoxicity assay. evaluate new method, virucidal efficacy several
well-known disinfectants reevaluated. dose- time-dependent effects the
disinfectants determined. minimal effective concentrations 5
minutes contact 20% ethanol, 0.01% glutaraldehyde 0.1% sodium
hypochlorite. results almost reported previously, but
there discrepancies. differences present previous
protocols discussed. micro-carrier-test promises useful the
screening disinfectants.
