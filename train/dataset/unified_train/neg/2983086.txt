we reconstructed regulated induction delayed-early (de) transcription that
occurs herpes simplex virus (hsv) infection using transient
expression system recombinant target genes cotransfected vero 
cells together intact activating genes. plasmids containing cloned hsv-1 
hsv-2 immediate-early (ie) genes stimulated 100-fold expression from
recombinant constructs containing bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase
(cat) gene control de promoter/regulatory region genes 
for hsv-2 38,000-molecular-weight (38k) protein hsv-1 thymidine
kinase. activation specific hybrid genes containing de regulatory
regions since significant increases expression observed in
cotransfection experiments cat gene without promoter region under
the control number regulatory regions, including hsv-1 ie
regulatory region, complete enhancerless early regulatory region simian
virus 40, inducible cellular promoter/regulatory region. using a
variety cotransfected plasmids containing individual different combinations
of hsv-1 hsv-2 ie genes, show five known ie genes, two, those
coding 175k 110k polypeptides, possessed ability to
stimulate expression de promoters. cleavage input plasmids
within known coding regions 175k 110k proteins abolished
stimulation de/cat gene expression, whereas cleavage outside coding
regions effect stimulation. conclude stimulation cat
expression occurred exclusively transactivation mechanism the
products encoded ie genes acted de hybrid constructs the
transcription level. transcriptional stimulatory function demonstrated for
the ie 68k 63k proteins, although results indicate ie 12k
protein may augment de stimulatory activity 175k 110k proteins.
