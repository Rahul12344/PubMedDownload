epidemic belgian congo.

an epidemic paralytic poliomyelitis occurred léopoldville time when
both virulent attenuated type 1 polioviruses present population. 
the attenuated virus chat strain, given extensive field
trials vaccine belgian congo. thought intratypic
identification "wild" vaccine strains might give information the
hypothetical possibility reversion virulence attenuated strains.
viruses isolated stools patients paralytic poliomyelitis,
both vaccinated previously fed 
chat attenuated vaccine. viruses studied chat virus strains
obtained first, second third human passages; mahoney, virulent strain;
w 1063, "naturally attenuated" strain; sickle, strain, which, mixture 
with mahoney strain, constituted initial inoculum chat been
derived. serologically, strains tested growth presence 
agar overlay containing chat immune serum. genetically, strains were
characterized study genetic markers relating growth agar low 
bicarbonate content (d character), comparative growth fresh versus ms
established line monkey kidney tissue culture, temperature susceptibility 
at 37 degrees c 40 degrees c. léopoldville strains mahoney able 
to produce plaques grown overlay containing chat immune serum, and
they d+, ms+ "hot" characters. chat derivatives d, ms and
"cold"-in words, exactly opposite respects studied. sickle w
1063 intermediate.evidence given chat genetically stable 
several human passages, poliomyelitis cases vaccinees caused
by vaccination, hypothesis return virulence attenuated
strains substantiated.
