polymerase chain reaction (pcr) utilized dna amplification from
transfusion transmitted virus (ttv) positive serum samples. five ttv dna
fragments, overlapped 90% genome, amplified long template
pcr generation ttv subgenome. recombinant plasmids obtained by
directly inserting pcr products pt-adv vector, dna sequence analyses
showed ttv dna fragments. using specific restriction enzymes, five
ttv dna fragments ligated ttv dna subgenome clone named as
ttv021. ttv021 deposited genbank database accession number
af254410. results computer analyses showed ttv021, 3472 nt long,
contains two open reading frames (orf1, 785 aa; orf2, 146 aa). identity
alignments ttv021 ttv isolates indicated several high conserved
regions existed. phylogenetic analysis 356 nt ttv021 suggested the
isolate close evolutionary relationship chn1 (type 1a), far
relation ttv isolates.
