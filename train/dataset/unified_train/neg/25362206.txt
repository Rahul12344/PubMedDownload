background: moxifloxacin currently recommended dose 7.5-10 mg/kg for
children multidrug-resistant (mdr) tuberculosis, pharmacokinetic and
long-term safety data moxifloxacin children tuberculosis lacking. 
an area curve (auc) 40-60 µg × h/ml following oral moxifloxacin
dose 400 mg reported adults.
methods: prospective pharmacokinetic safety study, children 7-15 years
of age routinely receiving moxifloxacin 10 mg/kg daily part multidrug
treatment mdr tuberculosis cape town, south africa, least 2 weeks, 
underwent intensive pharmacokinetic sampling (predose 1, 2, 4, 8, either 
6 11 hours) followed safety. assays performed using liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, pharmacokinetic measures calculated 
using noncompartmental analysis.
results: twenty-three children included (median age, 11.1 years;
interquartile range [iqr], 9.2-12.0 years); 6 23 (26.1%) human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected. median maximum serum concentration
(cmax), area curve 0-8 hours (auc0-8), time cmax (tmax), and
half-life moxifloxacin 3.08 (iqr, 2.85-3.82) µg/ml, 17.24 (iqr,
14.47-21.99) µg × h/ml, 2.0 (iqr, 1.0-8.0) h, 4.14 (iqr, 3.45-6.11),
respectively. three children, hiv-infected, underweight age. auc0-8 
was reduced 6.85 µg × h/ml (95% confidence interval, -11.15 -2.56) in
hiv-infected children. tmax shorter crushed vs whole tablets (p = .047).
except 1 child hepatotoxicity, adverse effects mild and
nonpersistent. mean corrected qt interval 403 (standard deviation, 30) ms,
and prolongation >450 ms occurred.
conclusions: children 7-15 years age receiving moxifloxacin 10 mg/kg/day as
part mdr tuberculosis treatment low serum concentrations compared with
adults receiving 400 mg moxifloxacin daily. higher moxifloxacin dosages may be
required children. moxifloxacin well tolerated children treated mdr
tuberculosis.
