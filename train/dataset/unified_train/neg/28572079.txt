background: combination antiretroviral therapy (cart) treatment human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection effective available, poor
medication adherence limits benefits, particularly vulnerable populations. 
a kenyan randomized controlled trial, weekly text-messaging intervention
(weltel) improved cart adherence hiv viral load (vl). despite growing
evidence short message service (sms) text-message interventions hiv care, 
there paucity data utilizing interventions marginalized or
female cohorts.
objective: study undertaken assess whether standardized weltel
sms text-message intervention applied vulnerable, predominantly female,
population improved cart adherence vl.
methods: conducted repeated measures study weltel intervention in
high-risk hiv-positive persons measuring change vl, cd4 count, and
self-reported adherence 12 months 12 months weltel
intervention introduced. inclusion criteria included vl ≥200 copies/ml,
indication treatment, meeting vulnerability criteria. participants were
given mobile phone unlimited texting (where required), weekly check-in
text messages sent one year weltel computer platform. clinical 
data collected control intervention years. participants were
followed multidisciplinary team clinical setting. outcomes were
assessed using wilcoxon signed ranks tests change cd4 vl control 
year study end mixed-effects logistic regressions change cart
adherence appointment attendance. secondary analysis conducted to
assess effect response rate outcome modeling final log10 vl by
number responses controlling mean log10 vl control year.
results: eighty-five participants enrolled study, 5 withdrew (final
n=80). participants predominantly female (90%, 72/80) variety of
vulnerabilities. mean vl decreased 1098 copies/ml control year 439
copies/ml study end (p=.004). adherence cart significantly improved (or
1.14, iqr 1.10-1.18; p<.001), whereas appointment attendance decreased slightly
with intervention (or 0.81, iqr 0.67-0.99; p=.03). response received
for 46.57% (1753/3764) messages sent 9.62% (362/3764) text messages
sent replied problem. outcome analysis examining relationship
between reply rate vl meet statistical significance (p=.07), may 
be worthy investigating larger study.
conclusions: weltel may effective tool improving cart adherence and
reducing vls among high-risk, vulnerable hiv-positive persons.
