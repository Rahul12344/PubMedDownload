specific, high affinity binding macromolecules great importance for
biomedical biotechnological applications. popular classical
antibody-based molecules recently challenged alternative scaffolds
with desirable biophysical properties. phage display technology applied such
scaffolds allows generation potent affinity reagents vitro selection.
here, report identification characterization novel helical
polypeptide advantageous biophysical properties template for
construction phage display libraries. three-helix bundle structure, based on
measles virus phosphoprotein p shows favourable stability solubility
profile. designed, constructed characterized six different types phage 
display libraries based proposed template. functional size over
10(9) independent clones, balanced codon bias decent display level key
parameters attesting quality utility libraries. new
libraries promising tool isolation high affinity binders based 
small helical scaffold could become convenient alternative antibodies.
