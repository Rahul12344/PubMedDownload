the incidence herpes zoster increases markedly advancing age, this
appears causally related age-dependent decline varicella-zoster
virus (vzv)-specific cellular immunity. psychologic stress also linked
to occurrence herpes zoster, mechanism involved been
investigated. study examined relationship major depression and
vzv-specific cellular immunity comparing vzv-specific responder cell frequency
(rcf) adults major depression (n = 11) age- sex-matched
nondepressed controls (n = 11) larger group nondepressed adults who
were > = 60 years old. vzv-specific rcf depressed patients markedly
reduced compared rcf matched controls (t = 2.7, p < .02). fact,
the levels vzv-specific rcf depressed patients comparable in
magnitude low levels found adults > = 60 years age. data
indicate major depression associated marked decline in
vzv-specific cellular immunity.
