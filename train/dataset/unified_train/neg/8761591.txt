the human immune response tuberculosis partly mediated the
proinflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor (tnf), interleukin (il)-6, and
il-8. investigated plasma concentrations cytokines after
maximal lipopolysaccharide stimulation ex vivo whole blood leucocytes from
zambian patients. 32 patients non-fatal tuberculosis, 25 were
seropositive human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), followed 9 months. 
patients assessed presentation hospital (visit a), 2 months'
antimycobacterial therapy (visit b), chemotherapy completed (visit
c). visits b, patients regained weight (p = 0.03) became less
anaemic (p = 0.0001). visit b, haemoglobin concentration remained lower hiv
seropositive patients (p = 0.001) erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr),
initially elevated patients, higher hiv seropositive patients (100 
+/- 6 mm vs. 43 +/- 11 mm 1 h seronegative patients; p = 0.002). plasma
il-8 concentrations increased visit c il-8 secretion ex vivo (p < 
0.0001 time points). otherwise plasma cytokine levels secretion ex
vivo remained similar throughout study. concurrent hiv infection resulted 
persistently decreased il-6 secretions ex vivo although esr remained high. in
summary, antibiotic therapy vivo il-8 secretion ex vivo increased, which
supports data suggesting il-8 role immunity tuberculosis.
