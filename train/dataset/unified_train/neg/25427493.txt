as potential pandemic threat human health, urgent need for
rapid, sensitive, simpler less expensive detection method highly
pathogenic influenza virus. purpose, quartz crystal microbalance (qcm)
and surface plasmon resonance (spr) sensors developed the
recognition hemagglutinin (ha) major protein influenza virus. 
4-aminophenyl boronic acid (4-apba) synthesized used new ligand
for binding sialic acid (sa) via boronic acid-sugar interaction. sa an
important role binding ha. qcm spr sensor surfaces modified
with thiol groups 4-apba sa immobilized sensor
surfaces, respectively. sensor surfaces screened afm used 
the determination ha aqueous solution. selective recognition the
qcm spr sensors toward concanavalin reported work. also,
the binding capacity detection limits qcm spr sensors been
calculated detection limits found 4.7 × 10(-2) μm, (0.26 μg
ml(-1)) 1.28 × 10(-1) μm, (0.72 μg ml(-1)) 95% confidence interval,
respectively.
