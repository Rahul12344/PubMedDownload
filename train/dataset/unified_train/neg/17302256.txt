background: hepatitis c virus (hcv) believed exert suppressive effect 
hepatitis b virus (hbv) hbv/hcv-coinfected patients; hcv cured by
interferon-based therapy, patients may show hbv reactivation. however,
recent evidence revealed virological status hbv/hcv-untreated
individuals may vary time may show fluctuating profiles.
methods: evaluate behaviour apparently inactive hbv infection in
patients treatment concurrent hcv infection, performed a
prospective study evaluated nine consecutive patients (eight males a
median age 45.9 years, one female aged 62 years) longitudinally
followed-up bi-monthly evaluation hbv/hcv viraemia levels liver
biochemistry 1-year treatment interferon plus ribavirin.
results: seven cases hbv infection maintained inactive status
independently hcv response therapy. contrast, two non-responder
cases persistently high hcv rna levels showed hbv dna flairs the
follow-up, indicating status active hbv infection fluctuating
virological profiles.
conclusions: study suggests hbv behaviour may independent the
hcv activity anti-hcv therapy hbv/hcv-coinfected patients, the
hbv virological profile monitored recognize possible reactivations
that might lead proper therapeutic choices adjustments.
