hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) third common cause cancer-related
deaths worldwide. chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection causes induction of
several tumors/cancer stem cell (csc) markers known major risk
factor development hcc. therefore, drugs simultaneously target viral 
replication csc properties needed risk-free treatment advanced
stage liver diseases, including hcc. here, demonstrated that
(z)-3,5,4'-trimethoxystilbene (z-tms) exhibits potent antitumor anti-hcv
activities without exhibiting cytotoxicity human hepatocytes vitro in
mice livers. diethylnitrosamine (den)/carbon tetrachloride (ccl4) extensively
induced expression dclk1 (a csc marker) livers c57bl/6 mice
following hepatic injury. z-tms exhibited hepatoprotective effects against
den/ccl4-induced injury reducing dclk1 expression improving histologic
outcomes. drug caused bundling dclk1 microtubules blocked
cell-cycle progression g2-m phase hepatoma cells via downregulation of
cdk1, induction p21(cip1/waf1) expression, inhibition akt (ser(473))
phosphorylation. z-tms also inhibited proliferation erlotinib-resistant lung
adenocarcinoma cells (h1975) bearing t790m egfr mutation, likely by
promoting autophagy nuclear fragmentation. conclusion, z-tms appears be
a unique therapeutic agent targeting hcv concurrently eliminating cells 
neoplastic potential chronic liver diseases, including hcc. may also be
a valuable drug targeting drug-resistant carcinomas cancers lungs,
pancreas, colon, intestine, dclk1 involved tumorigenesis.
