cervical cancer frequent female malignancy developing
countries. previous studies demonstrated strong association human
papillomavirus (hpv) infection dysplasia carcinoma uterine
cervix. objective study identify prevailing hpv genotypes 
responsible development cervical cancer among women ethiopia and
the sudan. molecular characterization hpv done 245 paraffin embedded 
cervical biopsy samples collected two countries. amplification hpv
and subsequent genotyping done using spf10 primers line probe assay. of
samples collected ethiopian patients, 93% (149/160) 13% (21/160) had
high risk low risk hpv genotypes, respectively. among samples collected 
the sudan, 94% (80/85) harbored high risk 11.7% (10/85) low risk hpv
genotypes. human papillomavirus 16 frequent genotype identified in
samples ethiopia (91%, 136/149) sudan (82.5%, 66/80). hpv 52, 58,
and 18 second, third fourth common genotypes identified ethiopia,
whereas hpv 18, 45, 52 second, third, fourth genotypes
identified samples collected sudan. thus, individuals living in
different geographical localities receive vaccines based specific
genotypes circulating area vaccine targeting hpv 16, 18, 45, 52, and
58 may optimal control cervical cancer two countries.
