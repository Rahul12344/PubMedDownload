viruses employ various means evade immune detection. reduction cd8(+) t
cell epitopes one common strategies used purpose. hepatitis b 
virus (hbv), member hepadnaviridae family, four open reading frames,
with 50% overlap genes encode. computed cd8(+) t
cell epitope density within hbv proteins mutations within epitopes.
our results suggest hbv accumulates escape mutations reduce number 
of epitopes. mutations equally distributed among genes reading 
frames. highly expressed core x proteins selected low
epitope density, polymerase, expressed low levels, undergo
the selection. overlapping regions, mutations one protein-coding
sequence also affect protein-coding sequence. show mutations
lead removal epitopes x surface proteins even expense 
the addition epitopes polymerase. total escape mutation rate for
overlapping regions lower nonoverlapping regions. lower
epitope replacement rate overlapping regions slows evolutionary escape
rate regions leads accumulation mutations robust in
the transfer hosts, mutations preventing proteasomal cleavage
into epitopes.
