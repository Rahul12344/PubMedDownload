in bacteriophage t4 protein product gene 43 (gp43) multifunctional
dna polymerase essential replication phage genome. protein
harbors dna-binding, deoxyribonucleotide-binding, dna-synthesizing (polymerase)
and 3'-exonucleolytic (editing) activities well capacity interact with
several t4-induced replication enzymes. addition, t4 gp43 a
repressor synthesis vivo. show protein an
autogenous repressor translation, localized rna-binding
sequence (translational operator) translation initiation domain gene 43
mrna. mechanism regulation t4 dna polymerase expression underscores
the ubiquity translational repression control t4 dna replication.
many t4 dna polymerase accessory proteins nucleotide biosynthesis enzymes are
regulated phage-induced translational repressor rega, t4
single-stranded dna-binding protein (t4 gp32) is, like gp43, autogenously
regulated translational level.
