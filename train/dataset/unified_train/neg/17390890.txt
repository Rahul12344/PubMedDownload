for 2 years (2002-2004); sever virus like disease leaves pisum
sativum observed tehran iran. identity established
by following host reactions serological molecular assays. collected
samples tested presence virus using das-elisa (direct
double antibody sandwich-elisa). leaf sap test samples diluted 1:10
in elisa sample buffer. samples reacted elisa antibody potato
virus (x)(pvx). samples passed three single chlorotic local
lesion transfers gompherena globosa, showed chlorosis 5 7 days 
mechanical inoculation. finally one local homogenized phosphate buffer
(0.05 m, ph 7.2) rubbing inoculums carbourundum--dusted leaves of
nicotiana glutinosa. host range studies extracts prepared infected n.
glutinosa leave inoculated 35 species. virus induces systemic
mosaic symptoms petunia hybrida, physalis floridana, nicandera physaloides and
solanum nigrum. yet record assay hosts pvx. total rna
extracted symptomatic, plants rna extracted purified virus
preparations tested using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(rt-pcr) specific primers designed amplify fragment the
rna-dependent rna-polymerase gen. back inoculation different symptomatic
plants, done pisum sativum confirmed das-elisa. the
first report petunia hybrida, physalis floridana, nicandera physaloides and
solanum nigrum new indicator plants pvx.
