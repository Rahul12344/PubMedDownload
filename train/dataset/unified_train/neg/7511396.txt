in classic model antigen processing presentation, viral antigens must 
be synthesized within cytoplasm infected cells processed and
presented cd8+, mhc class i-restricted cytotoxic lymphocytes (ctls). have
examined utility retroviral vector (pneonef) expressing human
immunodeficiency virus type (hiv-1)lai nef protein development target 
cells study hiv-specific ctls. autologous epstein-barr-transformed b cell
lines (ebv-b cells) transduced pneonef efficiently lysed ctl lines
from donors capable lysing ebv-b cells infected recombinant vaccinia
virus (rvv) expressing nef. also, transduced cells efficient stimulator 
cells generation nef-specific ctl lines. ctl lines thus generated 
recognized epitopes ctl lines donor generated by
nonspecific stimulation. use similar cell lines transduced retroviral
vectors expressing hiv proteins may useful study ctls in
hiv-infected donors study ability candidate vaccines,
including rvv, induce hiv-specific ctls. antigen-presenting cells, cell
lines may useful generation antigen-specific ctl lines.
