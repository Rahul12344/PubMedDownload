a purification scheme developed allowed partial purification 
complete, double-shelled particles infectious diarrhea infant rats
(idir) virus, group b rotavirus (gbr). structural proteins isolated,
complete viral particles separated sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide 
gel electrophoresis evaluated silver staining immunoblotting using 
antisera obtained rats recovered idir virus infection.
analysis stained gels immunoblots demonstrated presence idir
virus structural proteins estimated molecular weights 130, 100, 88, 80,
61, 44, 32, 25 kda. treatment complete viral particles edta removed
the outer capsid layer producing single-shelled particles lacked 80, 61,
32, 25 kda proteins seen double-shelled particles. 44-kda protein 
was abundant recognized mouse monoclonal antibody and
hyperimmune guinea pig serum prepared idir virus hyperimmune
guinea pig serum prepared adult diarrhea rotavirus (adrv), human strain
of gbr. convalescent serum obtained piglet inoculated porcine gbr
reacted 61 kda, outer capsid protein idir virus. information 
the structural nature idir virus helpful establishing genetic
and structural relationships among gbr exploit potential
of idir virus tool understanding gbr infections human animal
populations.
