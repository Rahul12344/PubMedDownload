during acute human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection, massive
depletion cd4(+) cells gut mucosa reversed various
degrees antiretroviral therapy. th17 cells implicated mucosal
immunity extracellular bacteria, preservation subset may support
gut mucosal immune recovery. however, possibility yet evaluated
in hiv-1-infected long-term nonprogressors (ltnps), maintain high cd4(+) t
cell counts suppress viral replication absence antiretroviral
therapy. study, evaluated immunophenotype function cd4(+) t
cells peripheral blood gut mucosa hiv-uninfected controls, ltnps, and
hiv-1-infected individuals treated prolonged antiretroviral therapy (art)
(vl [viral load]<50). found ltnps intact cd4(+) cell populations, 
including th17 cycling subsets, gut mucosa preserved cell
population expressing gut homing molecules peripheral blood. addition, 
we observed evidence higher monocyte activation ltnps in
hiv-infected (hiv(-)) controls. data suggest that, similar nonpathogenic
simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) infection, ltnps preserve balance of
cd4(+) cell populations blood gut mucosa, may contribute the
lack disease progression observed patients.
