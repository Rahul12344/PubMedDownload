wastewater disinfection ozone investigated pilot scale different
wastewater effluents. variations operating conditions showed low
hydraulic retention time (2 min) sufficient efficient fecal coliform
inactivation, provided sufficient ozone dose transferred effluent.
therefore, transferred ozone dose appeared critical parameter for
the design wastewater disinfection. consequence, "ct" approach
commonly applied drinking water treatment used wastewater
ozonation. design parameters ozonation proposed two types of
regulations, effluents different qualities. demonstrated that
only efficient filtration step one meet stringent standards as
the california title 22 criteria. cases, viruses totally inactivated;
consequently, viruses constitute limiting factor wastewater
disinfection ozone. standard drinking water model failed match the
experimental data obtained real wastewater effluents. modified approach 
successfully developed, based simultaneous consumption ozone the
microorganisms organic matrix.
