background: co-circulation 4 denv serotypes geographically expanding
area, resulted increasing occurrence denv co-infections. however,
studies assessing clinical impact denv co-infections scarce 
have involved small number patients. study explores impact denv
co-infection clinical manifestations laboratory parameters.
methods: retrospective study involved consecutive hospitalized patients with
non-structural protein 1 (ns1) antigen positivity outbreak (jan to
april 2014). multiplex rt-pcr performed directly ns1 positive serum
samples detect determine denv serotypes. pcr-positive serum
samples inoculated onto c6/36 cells. multiplex pcr repeated the
supernatant first blind passage serum-infected cells. random
samples supernatant first passage c6/36 infected cells were
subjected whole genome sequencing. clinical laboratory variables were
compared patients without denv co-infections.
results: 290 ns1 positive serum samples, 280 pcr positive denv.
medical notes 262 patients available analysis. 4 denv serotypes
were identified. 262 patients, forty patients (15.3 %) denv
co-infections: denv-1/denv-2(85 %), denv-1/denv-3 (12.5 %) denv-2/denv-3 (2.5
%). another 222 patients (84.7 %) infected single denv serotype
(mono-infection), denv- 1 (76.6 %) denv- 2 (19.8 %) predominating.
secondary dengue infections occurred 31.3 % patients. whole genome sequences
of random samples representing denv-1 denv-2 showed heterogeneity amongst the
denvs. multivariate analysis revealed pleural effusion presence of
warning signs significantly higher co-infected group, the
overall subgroup analysis. diarrhoea negatively associated with
co-infection. additionally, denv-2 co-infected patients higher frequency of
patients severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50,000/mm(3)), whereas
denv-2 mono-infections presented commonly myalgia. elevated creatinine 
levels frequent amongst co-infected patients univariate
analysis. haemoconcentration haemorrhagic manifestations higher
amongst co-infected patients. serotypes associated severe dengue were:
denv-1 (n = 9), denv-2 (n = 1), denv-3 (n = 1) mono-infected patients and
denv-1/denv-2 (n = 5) denv-1/denv-3 (n = 1) amongst co-infected patients.
conclusion: denv co-infections uncommon hyperendemic region and
co-infected patients skewed towards severe clinical manifestations
compared mono-infected patients.
