four pregnancies, two women aged 39 two women aged 34 years respectively, 
were complicated foetal parvovirus b19 infection. first-trimester intrauterine
death resulting multiple congenital anomalies diagnosed one patient
with proven foetal parvovirus b19 infection. three patients foetal hydrops was
found second trimester variable clinical course. one them,
foetal hydrops resulted second-trimester foetal death; another, foetal
hydrops resolved following intrauterine blood transfusion third foetal
hydrops resolved spontaneously. foetal parvovirus b19 infection diagnosed 
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using foetal cells obtained amnioscentesis. it
is concluded maternal parvovirus b19 infection mostly asymptomatic.
however, clinical impact maternal infection foetus diverse, i.e.
infection may result foetal death or--transient--foetal morbidity, in
particular foetal anaemia. mothers proven foetal parvovirus b19 infection
close monitoring foetus ultrasound warranted. occasionally
intrauterine transfusion required. literature date, estimated 
incidence maternal parvovirus b19 infection pregnancy 3-7%. vertical
transmission rate approximates 30%. pregnancy complicated foetal
hydrops foetal parvovirus b19 infection kept mind.
