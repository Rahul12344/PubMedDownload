primary effusion lymphoma (pel) represents novel b-cell non-hodgkin's lymphoma 
(nhl) type associated kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection 
typically growing lymphomatous effusions body cavities. precise
b-cell subset pel originates well biologic mechanisms
responsible peculiar growth pattern unclear. study, have
analyzed pel expression status cd138/syndecan-1, molecule
selectively associated late stages b-cell differentiation implicated 
in cell-to-cell cell-to-extracellular matrix interactions. pel patient
samples (n = 7) cell lines (n = 5) investigated multiple approaches, 
including immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, rna analysis, western blot
studies. comparison, lymphomatous effusions pel (n = 13) and
tissue-based nhl (n = 103) also tested. expression cd138/syndecan-1
associates high frequency pel (5 7 patient samples 5 5 cell
lines), whereas consistently absent among lymphomatous effusions (n =
13). cd138/syndecan-1 isoform expressed pel average molecular
weight 420 kd, substantially different cd138/syndecan-1 
molecules generally expressed plasma cells. data, along previous
immunophenotypic evidence, unequivocally define pel cells represent a
preterminal stage b-cell differentiation may bear implications the
peculiar growth pattern lymphoma.
