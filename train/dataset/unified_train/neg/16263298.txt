searching anti-hiv-1 protease (pr) inhibitors thai medicinal plants led to
the isolation new cyclohexenyl chalcone named panduratin c (1) chalcone 
derivatives (2-6) methanol extract boesenbergia pandurata rhizomes.
the known compounds identified panduratin (2), hydroxypanduratin a
(3), helichrysetin (4), 2',4',6'-trihydroxyhydrochalcone (5), uvangoletin
(6). structures compounds elucidated basis chemical and
spectroscopic methods. found 3 possessed potent anti-hiv-1
pr activity ic50 value 5.6 microm, followed 2 (ic50 = 18.7 microm),
whereas compounds exhibited mild activity. structure-activity
relationships compounds anti-hiv-1 pr activity summarized as
follows: (1) hydroxyl moiety position 4 conferred higher activity than
methoxyl group; (2) prenylation dihydrochalcone essential activity;
(3) hydroxylation position 4''' reduced activity; (4) introduction of
double bond c1' c6' chalcone gave higher activity. regards active
constituents contained b. pandurata rhizomes, hydroxypanduratin (3) and
panduratin (2) active principles hiv-1 pr.
