the caterpiller (clr, also nod nlr) proteins share structural similarities
with nucleotide binding domain (nbd)-leucine-rich repeat (lrr) superfamily of
plant disease-resistance (r) proteins emerging important immune
regulators animals. clr proteins contain nbd-lrr motifs linked a
limited number distinct n-terminal domains including transactivation, card
(caspase activation recruitment), pyrin domains (pyd). clr gene,
monarch-1/pypaf7, expressed resting primary myeloid/monocytic cells, and
its expression cells reduced toll-like receptor (tlr) agonists
tumor necrosis factor (tnf) alpha mycobacterium tuberculosis. monarch-1
reduces nfkappab activation tlr-signaling molecules myd88, irak-1 (type i
interleukin-1 receptor-associated protein kinase), traf6 (tnf receptor
(tnfr)-associated factor) well tnfr signaling molecules traf2 rip1 
not downstream nfkappab subunit p65. indicates monarch-1 a
negative regulator tlr tnfr pathways. reducing monarch-1 expression
with small interference rna myeloid/monocytic cells caused dramatic increase
in nfkappab activation cytokine expression response tlr2/tlr4 agonists,
tnfalpha, m. tuberculosis infection, suggesting monarch-1 negative
regulator inflammation. monarch-1 first clr protein that
interferes tlr2 tlr4 activation, mechanism interference
is significant. find monarch-1 associates irak-1 myd88,
resulting blockage irak-1 hyperphosphorylation. mutants containing 
nbd-lrr pyd-nbd also blocked irak-1 activation. first example a
clr protein antagonizes inflammatory responses initiated tlr agonists via
interference irak-1 activation.
