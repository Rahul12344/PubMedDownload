the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) assay piper yellow mottle
virus reverse transcription (rt) lamp assay cucumber mosaic virus
each consisted set five primers designed conserved sequences 
in viral genome. rna dna isolated black pepper used a
template assay. results assessed visually checking turbidity,
green fluorescence pellet formation reaction tube also gel
electrophoresis. assay successfully detected viruses infected plants 
whereas cross-reactions recorded healthy plants. optimum conditions 
for successful amplification determined terms concentrations of
magnesium sulphate betaine, temperature, duration. detection limit
for lamp rt-lamp 100 times conventional pcr to
one-hundredth real-time pcr. optimal conditions arrived were
validated testing field samples infected vines three species from
different regions.
