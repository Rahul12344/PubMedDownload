the adeno-associated virus (aav) terminal repeats (tr) cis required, 
aav encoded rep78 protein trans required, aav dna replication. rep78
protein recognizes interacts least three regions within tr dna.
the major binding site, highest affinity rep78 binding, within
the tr stem (nt 36-16) includes 'core' gagc trimer (gagc3, nt 33-22; fig.
2) sequence. study mutations made within gagc trimer these
mutants assayed ability allow aav double stranded (ds dna,
prepackaging dna replication), single stranded dna (ss dna, due virion
packaging) replication. here, shown two inside gagc motifs
are mutated, motif no. 1 left intact (see fig. 2), resulting aav
(muta) genome significantly defective ds dna (17% wild type) 
ss dna (9%). trs contained two outside motifs intact (mutb),
motifs no. 1 2, aav genome significant reduced level ds
(50%) ss (34%) dna replication. finally, middle motif no. 2 was
mutated, motifs no. 1 3 left intact (mutc), resulting dna
replication ds ss forms essentially wild type (80% wild 
type). data suggest gagc trimer plays role aav dna
replication, gagc motif no. 3 important three motifs 
for ds ss dna replication.
