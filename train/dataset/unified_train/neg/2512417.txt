the production interferon-alpha/beta (inf-alpha/beta) interferon gamma
(ifn-gamma) nod icr mice studied vitro vivo. vitro
ifn-alpha/beta production spleen cells nod mice, stimulated 
with either newcastle disease virus (ndv), sendai virus, poly(i:c) or
lipopolysaccharide (lps), similar ifn-alpha/beta production in
the spleen cells icr mice. contrastingly, vitro ifn-gamma production in
the spleen cells nod mice, stimulated either concanavalin a
(con a), phytohemagglutinin (pha) pokeweed mitogen (pwm), greater the
ifn-gamma production spleen cells icr mice. vivo ifn-alpha/beta
production nod mice induced ndv also similar icr mice, 
whereas vivo ifn-gamma production bcg-sensitized nod mice, which
was induced purified protein derivative (ppd), greater the
icr mice. results may indicate nod mice abnormalities the
ifn-gamma production.
