polymorphisms coding sequences ccr5 cxcr4 studied group
of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected long-term nonprogressors. two
different point mutations found cxcr4 coding sequence. one these
cxcr4 mutations silent, unique two nonprogressors. the
well-described 32-bp deletion within ccr5 coding sequence (ccr5-delta32) 
found 4 13 nonprogressors, 12 different point mutations found
scattered ccr5 coding sequence 8 nonprogressors. the
mutations created either silent conservative changes predicted amino
acid sequence: one mutations found single
nonprogressor. nonsilent mutations tested hiv envelope-dependent
fusion assay, functioned comparably wild-type controls. polymorphisms 
in cxcr4 ccr5 coding sequences ccr5-delta32 appear to
play dominant mechanistic role nonprogression among hiv-infected
individuals.
