according 'hayflick limit', human fetal fibroblasts uniform,
limited replicative lifespan 50 population doublings cell culture.
this concept extrapolated diverse cells body. seemed decrease
with age cell donor and, form cell senescence, thought 
underlie aging process. discriminating analysis, however, showed that
the fibroblasts decayed stochastic manner time their
explantation, rate increased number population doublings in
culture. consistent relation age donor. despite the
contradictory evidence, original version hayflick limit retained its
general acceptance. cell senescence attributed absence telomerase
in fibroblasts, resulted shortening telomeres division
until fell critical length needed division. however, 
is well established stem cells renewing tissues undergo many 50
divisions lifetime, without apparent senescence. contrary early findings 
of telomerase tissues, stem cells retain telomerase and
presumably telomere length despite many divisions vivo. massive accumulation
of lipofuscin granules occurs stress long term crowded cultures, the
granules dissipate subculture neoplastic transformation. overall
results indicate critical disjunction cell senescence vitro and
aging vivo. contrast, cell culture useful showing need for
telomere capping maintaining cell stability viability. may also provide
information biochemical mechanism lipofuscin production.
