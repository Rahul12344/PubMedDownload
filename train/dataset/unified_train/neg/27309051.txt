the largest epidemic avian influenza (ai) history attacked poultry wild
birds throughout taiwan starting january 6, 2015. study analyzed
surveillance results, epidemiologic characteristics, viral sequences using
government-released information, intention provide recommendations to
minimize future pandemic influenza. h5 clade 2.3.4.4 highly pathogenic ai
viruses (hpaivs) detected taiwan 2015. this
epidemic, four types etiologic agents identified: three novel
subtypes h5n2, h5n8, h5n3 clade 2.3.4.4 hpaivs one endemic chicken h5n2
subtype (mexican-like lineage) low pathogenic ai viruses. cocirculation of
mixed subtypes also occurred, h5n2 clade 2.3.4.4 hpaivs accompanied the
h5n8 h5n3 subtypes old h5n2 viruses farm. 90% of
domestic geese died ai epidemic; geese affected the
early outbreaks. epidemic peaked mid-january three novel h5
subtypes. spatial epidemiology found affected areas located in
southwestern coastal areas. terrestrial poultry (mostly chickens), different
geographic distributions ai virus subtypes detected, hot spots of
h5n2 clade 2.3.4.4 vs. past-endemic old h5n2 viruses changhwa (p = 0.03) and
yunlin (p = 0.007) counties, respectively, central taiwan. phylogenetic and
sequence analyses early 10 taiwan h5 clade 2.3.4.4 isolates covering
the three subtypes showed different ha past

viruses. multiple subtypes h5 clade 2.3.4.4 hpaivs imply high viral
reassortment. recommend establishing integrated surveillance system,
involving clinical, virologic, serologic surveillance poultry wild
birds, swine mammals prevalent multiple-animal mixed-type
traditional farms, high-risk human populations, crucially important step
to minimize future pandemic influenza.
