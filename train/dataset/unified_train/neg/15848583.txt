we wanted develop immunostaining method urine cytopreparations detect
polyoma virus infection using fresh urine samples staining the
monoclonal sv40 antibody compare findings demonstration of
decoy cells urine kidney histology. routine urine samples from
pediatric kidney transplant patients collected either early after
transplantation later, cytocentrifuged, immunostained with
sv40-t-antibody. number sv40-t-antigen-positive epithelial cells was
counted cytopreparations compared findings routine urine
cytology transplant histology. immunostaining urine cytology with
sv40-t-ab demonstrated clearly infected epithelial cells rate of
infection could estimated semiquantitative counting. strong
correlation findings urine biopsies, the
urine preparations number infected cells much higher the
biopsies. high number sv40-positive cells urine also correlated 
the severity clinical infection state transplant. immunostaining
of urine cytology sv40-t-antibody seems useful diagnosis and
follow-up polyoma virus reactivation disease transplant patients,
especially children renal transplants.
