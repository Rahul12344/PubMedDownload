tissue-specific patterns levels protein expression characterized in
transgenic carrot plants transformed beta-glucuronidase (gus) gene
driven one five promoters: cauliflower mosaic virus 35s (35s) double
35s (d35s), arabidopsis ubiquitin (ubq3), mannopine synthase (mas2) from
agrobacterium tumefaciens rooting loci promoter (rold) a. rhizogenes.
five independently transformed carrot lines promoter construct were
assessed gus activity. leaves, activity highest plants the
d35s, 35s ubq3 promoters, staining weak plants mas2
promoter, slight visual staining present leaf veins plants
containing rold promoter . strong staining seen lateral roots,
including root tips, hairs vascular tissues plants expressing 35s,
d35s ubq3. lateral roots plants containing rold construct also showed 
staining tissues mas2 promoter exhibited heightened staining
in root tips. relatively strong gus staining seen throughout tap root
with promoters tested.. gus expression quantified, ubq3
promoter provided highest activity roots mature plants, plants
with d35s 35s promoter constructs higher activity leaves.
although plants containing mas2 promoter higher levels activity
compared rold plants, two promoters significantly weaker than
d35s, 35s ubq3. potential utilization specific promoters target
expression desired transgenes carrot tissues demonstrated.
