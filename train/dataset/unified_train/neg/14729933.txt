human papillomaviruses (hpvs) aetiological agents cervical cancer. more
than 70 different hpv types infect genital mucosa found. order 
to develop sensitive specific detection typing assay, pcr/direct
sequencing approach used. two pairs consensus primers used for
amplification hpv dna pcr products obtained analysed automated
sequencing. sequences compared genbank using blast
program. study, 2916 cytological samples screened hpv, well
as triage. nine hundred forty-eight (32.5%) samples positive for
hpv, 134 harboured one hpv type. 948 pcr-positive
samples, 648 typed. thirty-nine different hpv types identified by
sequencing. two frequently found hpv types, 16 31, together
accounted 36.3% sequences (26.2 10.1%, respectively). group
was followed hpv types 6 (5.7%), 18 (5.3%), 58 (4.5%), 61 (4.5%), 53 (4.4%),
42 (4.3%) 51 (4.0%). types detected frequencies <4% and
eight types detected once. pcr/direct sequencing reliable method
for routine detection hpv cytological samples. data presented here
suggest complex distribution hpv types population tested. results
accentuate importance pcr-based techniques hpv diagnosis, as
hybridization-based methods detect limited number infections. 
method also applied easily analysis tissue samples it
therefore also allows type-specific follow-up women treated 
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
