oncogenic human papillomaviruses (hpvs) closely linked major human
malignancies, including cervical head neck cancers. widely assumed 
that hpv-positive cancer cells selection pressure continuously
express viral e6/e7 oncogenes, intracellular p53 levels are
reconstituted e6/e7 repression, e6/e7 inhibition phenotypically
results cellular senescence. show hypoxic conditions, are
often found subregions cervical head neck cancers, enable
hpv-positive cancer cells escape regulatory principles: e6/e7 is
efficiently repressed, yet, p53 levels increase. moreover, e6/e7
repression hypoxia result cellular senescence, owing to
hypoxia-associated impaired mechanistic target rapamycin (mtor) signaling via 
the inhibitory redd1/tsc2 axis. instead, reversible growth arrest induced
that overcome reoxygenation. impairment mtor signaling also
interfered senescence response hypoxic hpv-positive cancer cells
toward prosenescent chemotherapy vitro. collectively, findings indicate 
that hypoxic hpv-positive cancer cells induce reversible state dormancy,
with decreased viral antigen synthesis increased therapeutic resistance, 
may serve reservoirs tumor recurrence reoxygenation.
