background: addition activities needed catalyse integration, retroviral 
integrases exhibit non-specific endonuclease activity enhanced certain
small compounds, suggesting integrase could stimulated damage viral
dna integration occurs.
methods: non-radioactive, plate-based, solution phase, fluorescence assay was
used screen library 50,080 drug-like chemicals stimulation of
non-specific dna nicking hiv-1 integrase.
results: semi-automated workflow established primary hits readily 
identified graphic output. overall, 0.6% chemicals caused large
increase fluorescence (the primary hit rate) without also visible
colour could artifactually caused result. none potential
stimulators moderate-size library, however, passed secondary test
that included inactive integrase mutant assessed whether increased
fluorescence depended endonuclease activity integrase.
conclusions: first attempt identifying integrase stimulator compounds
establishes necessary logistics workflow required. results 
study encourage larger scale high-throughput screening advance the
novel antiviral strategy stimulating integrase damage retroviral dna.
