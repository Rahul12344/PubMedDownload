in present study diagnostic use biotinylated serum immune
rabbit investigated means avidin-biotin-complex (abc)-peroxidase
method paraffin sections. 15 cases rhd verified
histologically and/or haemagglutination test (ha), 4 suspected cases 3
cases without history rhd included (cases 1 22). 5 prospective
cases wider tissue range examined (cases 23 25 29 30).
furthermore lungs, liver placenta 3 fetuses rhd affected dam were
investigated (cases 26 28). 20 typical cases intense intranuclear 
diffuse intracytoplasmic immunostaining hepatocytes, predominantly the
periportal areas. cases also positive staining macrophages
in lungs (4 cases), spleen (4 cases) lymph nodes (1 case). positive
granular staining renal mesangial cells glomeruli observed 1
case. positive staining observed 3 negative cases. contrast to
other reports (4), crossreactivity antigens porcine parvovirus (ppv) 
could confirmed. furthermore rhd virus (rhdv) seems crossreact 
with feline bovine parvoviruses.
