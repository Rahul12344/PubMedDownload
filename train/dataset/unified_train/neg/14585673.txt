a dna vaccine encoding envelope glycoprotein fish rhabdovirus, viral
hemorrhagic septicemia virus (vhsv), previously shown induce both
early long time protection virus rainbow trout. challenge
experiments revealed immunity established shortly vaccination
is cross-protective heterologous fish rhabdoviruses. study, we
show dna vaccine encoding vhsv glycoprotein also induces early
protection non-enveloped, positive-sense rna virus belonging the
nodavirus family, atlantic halibut nodavirus (ahnv). vaccine efficacy
test using juvenile turbot model fish, fish injected vhsv vaccine
were completely protected nodavirus challenge performed 8 days post
vaccination, cumulative mortality control group reached 54%. a
dna vaccine carrying gene encoding capsid protein ahnv revealed no
protective properties nodavirus challenge. histological examination
of muscle tissue sections vaccine injection site showed dna
vaccine vhsv triggered pronounced inflammatory response turbot
similar earlier observed rainbow trout.
