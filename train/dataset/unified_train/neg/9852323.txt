1. g protein betagamma subunits activate acetylcholine-induced potassium
current ik,ach. evidence specificity level betagamma
subunits. therefore g protein-coupled receptors atrial myocytes 
able activate ik,ach. paradoxically, often stated isoprenaline does
not activate ik,ach. rationales explain negative result include
insufficient concentrations gs atrium restricted access of
gs-derived betagamma subunits ik,ach channel. took advantage a
non-specific increase gs results infection adenovirus. 2.
adenoviral infection unmasked 1 microm isoprenaline-induced ik,ach was
prevented propranolol. isoprenaline occasionally activated ik,ach in
uninfected freshly dissociated atrial myocytes effect larger 
more consistent infected myocytes. 3. pertussis toxin pretreatment (100 ng
ml-1 overnight) block effect isoprenaline. effect of
isoprenaline became persistent cells pretreated cholera toxin (200
ng nl-1). 4. signal transduction events distal adenylyl cyclase not
involved isoprenaline-induced ik,ach. forskolin (10 microm) activate
ik,ach. inhibition adenylyl cyclase cytoplasmic application 300 microm
2'-deoxyadenosine 3'-monophosphate prevent activation ik,ach by
isoprenaline. 5. cytoplasmic application betagamma binding peptide derived
from c terminus beta-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (50 microm) prevented
the effect isoprenaline ik,ach. peptide prevent stimulation
of l-type calcium current isoprenaline. 6. results indicate that
beta-adrenoceptors activate ik,ach atrial myocytes release 
betagamma subunits gs.
