we identified region within ectodomain fusogenic human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) gp41, different fusion peptide,
that interacts strongly membranes. conserved sequence, which
immediately precedes transmembrane anchor, highly hydrophobic
according kyte-doolittle hydropathy prediction algorithm, yet shows a
high tendency partition membrane interface, revealed the
wimley-white interfacial hydrophobicity scale. investigated the
membrane effects induced nh(2)-dkwaslwnwfnitnwlwyik-conh(2) (hiv(c)), the
membrane interface-partitioning region c terminus gp41 ectodomain, 
in comparison caused nh(2)-avgigalflgflgaagstmgars-conh(2) (hiv(n)), 
the fusion peptide n terminus subunit. hiv(c) hiv(n) 
seen induce membrane fusion permeabilization, although lower doses of
hiv(c) required comparable effects detected. experiments 
equimolar mixtures hiv(c) hiv(n) used indicated peptides
may act cooperative way. peptide-membrane peptide-peptide interactions
underlying effects confirmed analyzing changes in
fluorescence peptide trp residues. replacement first three trp residues
by ala, known render defective gp41 phenotype unable mediate both
cell-cell fusion virus entry, also abrogated hiv(c) ability induce
membrane fusion form complexes hiv(n) ability associate
with vesicles. hydropathy analysis indicated presence two
membrane-partitioning stretches separated collapsible intervening sequence
is common structural motif among viral envelope proteins. moreover,
sequences membrane surface-residing residues preceding transmembrane
anchor appeared common feature viral fusion proteins several virus 
families. according experimental results, feature might related 
to fusogenic function.
