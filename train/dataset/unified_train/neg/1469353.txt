with respect d/y, w/r, w1 w4 q. sequences nine different hbv
serotypes defined specificities found homogeneous proving
that represent consistent variations hbv genomic level. residue
127 found important pro, thr leu w1/w2, w3 w4,
respectively. five residues found differ ayw1 ayw2. these
were positions 134 (phe instead tyr), 143 (thr instead ser), 159 (ala
instead gly), 161 (tyr instead phe) 168 (val instead ala). however, 
all residues shared ayw1 adw2, implying arg122 also
important w1 expression. genomes expressing r, apart one ayr strain,
had ile126, might explain pseudo-allelism w1 w4 relation to
r, since substitution might influence w epitope. two regions 
where adw4q- adrq- differed q+ subtypes. located at
residues 158 159, residues 177 178, q- subtypes had
amino acid substitutions adjacent positions. mapping epitopes
defining antigenic specificities help link information the
