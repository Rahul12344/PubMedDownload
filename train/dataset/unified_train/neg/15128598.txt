inflammation female reproductive tract increases susceptibility hiv-1
and viral infections and, thus, becomes serious liability vaginal 
products. excessive release proinflammatory cytokines may alter mucosal
balance tissue destruction repair linked enhanced
penetration replication viral pathogens upon chemical insult. present 
study evaluates four surface-active microbicide candidates, nonoxynol-9 (n-9),
benzalkonium chloride (bzk), sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium monolaurate for
their activity human sperm hiv, capacity induce an
inflammatory response human vaginal epithelial cells rabbit vaginal
mucosa. spermicidal virucidal evaluations ranked n-9 potent
compound unable predict impact compounds vaginal cell
viability. interleukin (il)-1 release vitro reflected cytotoxicity
profiles accurately. furthermore, il-1 concentrations vaginal washings
correlated cumulative mucosal irritation scores single multiple
applications (p < 0.01), showing bzk damaging agent vaginal
mucosa. bzk induced rapid cell death, il-1 release, il-6 secretion. other
compounds required either prolonged repeated contact vaginal
epithelium induce significant inflammatory reaction. increased il-8 levels
after multiple applications vivo identified compounds highest
cumulative mucosal toxicity (p < 0.01). conclusion, il-1, il-6, il-8 in
the vaginal secretions sensitive indicators compound-induced mucosal
toxicity. described evaluation system valuable tool identifying novel
vaginal contraceptive microbicides, selecting candidates may enhance,
rather decrease, hiv transmission.
