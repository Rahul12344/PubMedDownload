four new flavones, tobaflavones e-h (1-4), together two known flavones (5
and 6), isolated leaves dali tiandeng tobacco (a variety of
yunnan local air cured tobacco). structures elucidated by
spectroscopic methods, including extensive 1d- 2d nmr techniques. compound 2 
is first naturally occurring flavone bearing a
(4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-oxo-2h-pyran-3-yl)methyl moiety. compounds also 
evaluated anti-tobacco mosaic virus (anti-tmv) activity. results
revealed compounds 1 2 exhibited high anti-tmv activity inhibition 
rate 35.3% 39.6%, respectively. rates higher of
positive control. compounds also showed potential anti-tmv activity
with inhibition rates range 18.7-28.4%, respectively.
