metagenomics generates tests hypotheses dynamics mechanistic
drivers wild populations, yet commonly suffers insufficient (< 1 ng)
starting genomic material sequencing. current solutions amplifying
sufficient dna metagenomics analyses include linear amplification deep
sequencing (lads), requires dna normally available,
linker-amplified shotgun libraries (lasls), prohibitively low
throughput, whole-genome amplification, significantly biased and
thus non-quantitative. here, adapt lasl approach next generation
sequencing offering alternate polymerase challenging samples,
developing efficient sizing step, integrating 'reconditioning pcr' step 
to increase yield minimize late-cycle pcr artefacts, empirically
documenting quantitative capability optimized method both
laboratory isolate wild community viral dna. optimized linker
amplification method requires little 1 pg dna precise
and accurate available, g + c content amplification biases less than
1.5-fold, even complex samples diverse wild virus community. while
optimized 454 sequencing, linker amplification method used
to prepare metagenomics libraries sequencing next-generation platforms, 
including illumina ion torrent, first tested present data
for here.
