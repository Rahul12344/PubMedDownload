viral diseases important limiting factor many crop production systems. 
because antiviral products available, control strategies rely genetic 
resistance hygienic measures prevent viral diseases, eradication of
diseased crops control diseases. increasing international travel and
trade plant materials enhances risk introducing new viruses their
vectors production systems. addition, changing climate conditions can
contribute successful spread newly introduced viruses vectors
and establishment organisms areas previously unfavorable.
tomato economically important vegetable crop worldwide many
viruses infecting tomato described, new viral diseases keep
emerging. pepino mosaic virus rapidly emerging virus established
itself one important viral diseases tomato production worldwide
over recent years. begomovirus species whitefly-transmitted viruses are
invading new areas, several recently described new viruses as
tomato torrado virus new tospovirus species rapidly spreading large 
geographic areas. article, emerging viruses tomato crops are
