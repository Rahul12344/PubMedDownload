we explored use simian-human immunodeficiency virus (shiv) dna vaccine
as effective mucosal priming agent stimulate protective immune response
for aids prevention. rhesus macaques vaccinated rectally dna
construct producing replication-defective shiv particles, boosted either
the dna construct recombinant modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva)
expressing siv gag, siv pol, hiv env (mva-shiv). virus-specific mucosal and
systemic humoral cell-mediated immune responses could stimulated this
approach present inconsistently among vaccinated animals. rectal
vaccination either shiv dna alone shiv dna followed mva-shiv induced
siv gag/pol- hiv gp120-specific iga rectal secretions four seven
animals. however, gp120-specific rectal iga antibody responses not
durable become undetectable one animal shortly rectal
challenge pathogenic shiv 89.6p. macaques primed shiv dna 
boosted mva-shiv demonstrated shiv-specific igg plasma. addition,
these animals developed consistent antiviral cell-mediated responses had
better preservation cd4 cells following challenge shiv 89.6p. study
demonstrates utility rectal dna/mva vaccination protocol the
induction diverse responses different immunological compartments. in
addition, immunity achieved mucosal vaccination regimen is
sufficient delay progression aids.
