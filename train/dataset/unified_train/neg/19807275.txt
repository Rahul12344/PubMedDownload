background: positive impact opioid substitution treatment (ost) on
opioid-dependent individuals human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection is
well documented, especially regard adherence highly active
antiretroviral therapy (haart). used data 5-year longitudinal study
of manif 2000 cohort individuals infected hiv (as result of
injection drug use) receiving haart investigate predictors of
long-term virological success. design. data collected every 6 months from
outpatient hospital services delivering hiv care france. selected all
patients receiving haart least 6 months (baseline visit) 
had indications ost (ie, still dependent opioids). selected total 
113 patients, accounting total 562 visits analyses.
methods: long-term virological success defined undetectable viral load 
after least 6 months haart. retention ost defined time
interval last initiation reinitiation ost haart
follow-up given visit ost. mixed logistic model used identify
predictors long-term virological success.
results: baseline, 53 patients receiving buprenorphine, 28 patients 
receiving methadone, 32 patients ost. median duration ost 
was 25 months (range, 3-42 months). multivariate analysis, after
adjustment significant predictors long-term virological success as
adherence haart early virological response, retention ost was
associated long-term virological success (odds ratio, 1.20 per 6-month
increase; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.32).
conclusions: study presents important evidence positive impact of
retention ost hiv outcomes. increasing access ost based a
comprehensive model care hiv-infected patients indications for
ost may foster adherence ensure long-term response haart.
