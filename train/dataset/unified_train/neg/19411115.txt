this study designed evaluate prime-boost vaccination regimens a
novel immunization strategy dna vaccine classical swine fever virus
(csfv). balb/c mice primed alphavirus replicon-vectored dna vaccine
psfv1cs-e2-ul49 encoding e2 protein csfv fused ul49 gene encoding
the transduction protein vp22 pseudorabies virus, followed either
homologous boosting psfv1cs-e2-ul49 heterologous boosting the
recombinant adenovirus radv-e2 expressing e2 protein the
baculovirus-produced recombinant e2 protein (re2) adjuvant. humoral and
cell-mediated immune responses following prime-boost vaccination assessed.
the results showed that: (1) boosting either radv-e2 re2 elicited
high-level antibodies, whereas homologous boosting psfv1cs-e2-ul49 elicited 
low-level antibodies (below positive threshold); (2) heterologous boosting with
radv-e2 resulted stronger cd8(+) cd4(+) cells proliferation responses
and higher stimulation indexes; (3) heterologous boosting radv-e2
induced ifn-gamma production. results support notion a
regimen dna prime-recombinant adenovirus boost enhances humoral and
cell-mediated immune responses, dna prime-protein boost regimen enhances 
humoral immune responses.
