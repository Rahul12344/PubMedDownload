telbivudine, nucleoside analog inhibitor viral polymerase hepatitis b
virus (hbv), approved treatment chronic hbv infection, along 
with nucleoside inhibitors lamivudine entecavir, nucleotide
inhibitors adefovir tenofovir. resistance profiles agents were
investigated via drug treatment hepg2 cells stably transfected wild-type 
or mutant hbv genomes bearing known resistance mutations. telbivudine not
active hbv strains bearing lamivudine mutations l180m/m204v/i but
remained active m204v single mutant vitro, potentially explaining 
the difference resistance profiles telbivudine lamivudine. against
hbv genomes known telbivudine-resistance mutations, m204i l80i/m204i,
telbivudine, lamivudine entecavir lost 353- >1000-fold activity whereas
adefovir tenofovir exhibited 3-5-fold change. conversely,
against hbv cell lines expressing adefovir resistance mutations n236t a181v, 
or a194t mutant associated resistance tenofovir, telbivudine remained
active shown respective fold-changes 0.5 (n236t) 1.0 (a181v and
a194t). vitro results indicate nucleoside nucleotide drugs have
different cross-resistance profiles. addition telbivudine ongoing
adefovir therapy could provide effective antiviral therapy patients who
develop adefovir resistance.
