human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) transcription subject to
substantial fluctuation viral life cycle. due low frequencies
of hiv-1-infected cells, latently productively infected cells
collocate vivo, little quantitative knowledge attained the
range vivo hiv-1 transcription peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(pbmc). combining cell sorting, terminal dilution intact cells, highly 
sensitive, patient-specific pcr assays, divided pbmc obtained from
hiv-1-infected patients according degree viral transcription activity
and cellular phenotype. regardless patient's treatment status, the
bulk infected cells exhibited cd4+ phenotype transcribed hiv-1 provirus 
at low levels, presumably insufficient virion production. furthermore, the
expression activation markers surface cd4+ lymphocytes
showed little association enhancement viral transcription. in
contrast, hiv-infected lymphocytes cd4-/cd8- phenotype, occurring
exclusively untreated patients, exhibited elevated viral transcription rates. 
this cell type harbored substantial proportion hiv rna+ cells and
intracellular viral rnas majority cell-associated virus particles. 
conjunction observation hiv quasispecies cd4+ cd4-)/cd8-
t cells phylogenetically closely related, findings provide evidence
that cd4 expression downmodulated transition productive
infection vivo. abundance viral rna cd4-/cd8- cells viremic
patients almost complete absence viral dna rna cell type
during antiretroviral treatment identify hiv+ cd4-/cd8 cells major cell 
type harboring productive infection peripheral blood.
