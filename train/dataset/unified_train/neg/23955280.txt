development live-attenuated human respiratory syncytial virus (hrsv) vaccines 
has proven difficult. several vaccine candidates found be
over-attenuated displayed limited immunogenicity. recently, identified
three synthetic cationic lipopeptides enhanced paramyxovirus infections in
vitro. infection enhancement proved mediated enhanced virus binding 
to target cells. hypothesized lipopeptides used adjuvants
to promote immune responses induced live-attenuated paramyxovirus vaccines.
this hypothesis tested vaccination challenge model cotton rats,
using previously described recombinant live-attenuated candidate hrsv vaccine
lacking gene encoding g glycoprotein (rhrsvδg). surprisingly, intranasal 
vaccination cotton rats rhrsvδg formulated infection-enhancing
lipopeptides resulted reduced virus loads nasopharyngeal lavages, reduced
seroconversion levels reduced protection wild-type hrsv challenge. in
conclusion, unable demonstrate feasibility lipopeptides as
adjuvants candidate live-attenuated hrsv vaccine cotton rat model.
