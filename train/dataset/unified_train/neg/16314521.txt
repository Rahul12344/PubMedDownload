the survival motor neurons (smn) complex essential biogenesis of
spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snrnps) binds and
delivers sm proteins assembly sm cores abundant small nuclear rnas 
(snrnas). using conserved snrnas encoded lymphotropic herpesvirus
saimiri (hvs), determined specific sequence structural features of
rnas binding smn complex sm core assembly. show the
minimal smn complex-binding domain snrnas, except u1, comprised sm
site (auuuuug) adjacent 3' stem-loop. adenosine first and
third uridines sm site particularly critical binding smn
complex, directly contacts backbone phosphates uridines. the
specific sequence adjacent stem (7 12 base pairs)-loop (4 17
nucleotides) important smn complex binding, must located
within short distance 3' end rna sm core assemble.
importantly, defining characteristics discerned smn complex 
not sm proteins, bind assemble sm site sequence
alone. findings demonstrate smn complex identifier, well
as assembler, abundant class snrnas cells able to
recognize snrnp code contain.
