a long-finned pilot whale morbilliviral disease stranded new jersey. 
an immunohistochemical stain demonstrated morbilliviral antigen. reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction morbillivirus p n genes was
positive. novel sequences closely related to, distinct from, of
dolphin porpoise morbilliviruses suggest virus may represent a
third member cetacean morbillivirus group.
