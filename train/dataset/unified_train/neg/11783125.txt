objective: clarify frequency, routes transmission mother to
infant, correlation factors distribution genotypes transfusion
transmitted virus (ttv) infection.
methods: nested-polymerase chain reaction (n-pcr) performed detect ttv dna
and genotypes serums breast milks 160 cases pregnant women.
results: ttv dna serum breast milk detected 64 (40.0%) 60
(37.5%) 160 cases pregnant women respectively. positive rates ttv
dna hbv markers (+) normal groups 50.0%, 43.1% 13.6%, 22.7%
respectively serums breast milk. significant difference between
the two groups (p < 0.05). ttv genotypes type 124 samples of
ttv dna detected.
conclusions: ttv infection common pregnant women high prevalence 
of ttv infection pregnant women positive hbv markers been
demonstrated. ttv infection correlated hbv. ttv probably transmitted
from mother children breast feeding. ttv genotypes detected in
pregnant women genotype i.
