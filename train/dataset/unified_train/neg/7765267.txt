we established two simple, reliable, economical time-saving methods, one
for plasmid phagemid dnas another bacteriophage dnas, applied
for desired scale vector recombinant dnas preparation. methods
require neither toxic chemicals expensive enzymes chemical reagents. in
case small-scale preparation, entire procedure done one
microfuge tube. a260/a280 values isolated dnas constantly between
1.60 1.85. isolated plasmid phagemid dna used restriction
digestion, religation, transformation, construction deletion mutants,
sequencing, pcr vitro transcription. double-stranded and
single-stranded phage dnas prepared present method quality to
serve good templates pcr site-directed mutagenesis experiments.
