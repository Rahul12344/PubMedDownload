background: since establishment zimbabwe's national antiretroviral therapy
(art) programme 2004, art provision expanded <5,000 369,431 adults
by 2011. however, patient outcomes unexplored.
objective: determine improvement health status, retention factors
associated attrition among hiv-infected patients art.
methods: retrospective review abstracted patient records adults ≥ 15
years initiated art 2007 2009 done. frequencies medians 
calculated rates retention care changes key health status
outcomes 6, 12, 24 36 months respectively. cox proportional hazards models
were used determine factors associated attrition.
results: 3,919 patients, 64% female, 86% either clinical
stage iii iv. rates patient retention 6, 12, 24 36 months were
90.7%, 78.1%, 68.8% 64.4%, respectively. art initiation, median weight 
gains 6, 12, 24 months 3, 4.5, 5.0 kgs whilst median cd4+ cell
count gains 6, 12 24 months 122, 157 279 cells/µl respectively.
factors associated increased risk attrition included male gender (ahr 
1.2; 95% ci, 1.1-1.4), baseline stage iv (ahr 1.7; 95% ci, 1.1-2.6), lower
baseline body weight (ahr 2.0; 95% ci, 1.4-2. 8) accessing care higher
level healthcare facilities (ahr 3.5; 95% 1.1-11.2).
conclusions: findings regard retention well clinical and
immunological improvements following uptake art, similar 
found settings. factors influencing attrition also mirror found in
other parts sub-saharan africa. findings suggest need strengthen 
earlier diagnosis treatment improve treatment outcomes. whilst
decentralisation improves art coverage coupled strategies aimed
at improving patient retention.
