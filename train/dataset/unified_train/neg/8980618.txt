the technology cloning viral genes expressing vivo under
cell-specific promoters allows dissect role viruses, host self
proteins, host genetics immune responses complex etiology of
autoimmune disease. expression viral transgene, really marker 
a host "self" protein per se beta cells islets langerhans, need 
cause disease. model, expression viral gene associated with
disease lifetime animal. however, host becomes infected 
with virus encoding gene transgene one closely related to
it, resultant immune response directed virus also recognizes the
transgene leading progressive t-cell-mediated response destruction 
tissue expressing viral ("self") gene, leading autoimmune disease. this
multifactorial process influenced whether viral transgene expressed 
in thymus well disease-related cell target tissue. thymic
expression influences negative selection responder lymphocytes thus delays
the onset autoimmune disorder. further, mhc haplotype other
background genes individual undergoing autoimmune dysfunction play role
in affinity binding transgene products mhc molecule and
influence degree negative selection occurs, thereby influencing the
vigor resulting immune response. current ability express host or
viral genes unique cell populations, make double- triple-tg mice 
which various cytokine genes lymphocyte activation genes expressed
along viral gene, offers unique possibility molecular dissection
of autoimmunity. information hand, approaches prevention and
treatment human autoimmune disease likely uncovered. finally, animal
models available onset, progression control molecular
mimicry evaluated. future studies define roles played cytokines,
bystander immune-specific cross-reactivity viruses microbes in
several autoimmune diseases.
