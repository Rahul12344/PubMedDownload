haploidentical transplantation opens possibility offer treatment a
large number patients otherwise incurable disease, some
hematologic oncologic malignancies, inborn acquired bone marrow failure
syndromes, hemoglobinopathies, immunodeficiencies, genetic diseases.
initial attempts haploidentical transplantation using unmanipulated bone
marrow associated high transplant-related mortality. however, recent 
insights biology haploidentical transplantation, availability 
effective vivo large-scale graft-manipulation technology, improved
supportive care strategies led still leading significantly
better outcomes compared previous decades. methods vitro depletion 
of lymphocytes mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (pbsc) prevent
graft-versus-host disease (gvhd) facilitated wider use acceptance of
haploidentical transplantation children adult patients. besides vitro
t-cell depletion techniques, methods, isolation alloreactive
natural killer (nk) cells, virus-specific lymphocytes, effector or
regulatory cells nowadays available rapidly rebuild immune system
after haploidentical transplantation prevention severe infections or
relapses underlying diseases.
