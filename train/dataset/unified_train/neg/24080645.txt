drug resistance mutations (drms) reported currently approved
anti-hiv drugs, including latest integrase strand transfer inhibitors
(instis). previously used new insti dolutegravir (dtg) select g118r
integrase resistance substitution tissue culture also showed that
secondary substitutions emerged positions h51y e138k. now, have
characterized impact g118r substitution, alone combination 
either h51y e138k, 3' processing integrase strand transfer activity.
the results show g118r primarily impacted strand transfer step of
integration diminishing ability integrase-long terminal repeat (ltr)
complexes bind target dna. addition h51y e138k g118r partially
restored strand transfer activity modulating formation integrase-ltr
complexes increasing ltr dna affinity total dna binding,
respectively. unique mechanism, one function hiv integrase
partially compensates defect another function, previously
reported. g118r substitution resulted low-level resistance dtg,
raltegravir (ral), elvitegravir (evg). addition either h51y or
e138k g118r enhance resistance dtg, ral, evg. homology modeling 
provided insight mechanism resistance conferred g118r well as
the effects h51y e138k enzyme activity. g118r substitution therefore
represents potential avenue resistance dtg, similar previously
described r263k substitution. pathways, secondary substitutions 
can lead either diminished integrase activity and/or increased insti
susceptibility.
