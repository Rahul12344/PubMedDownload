cells contain powerful rna decay machinery eliminate unneeded rna the
cell, process important regulated part controlling gene
expression. however, certain structured rnas found robustly
resist degradation extend lifetime rna. review, present 
three rna structures use specific three-dimensional fold provide
protection rna degradation, discuss recently-solved structures
of rnas explain function. specifically, describe the
xrn1-resistant rnas arthropod-borne flaviviruses, exosome-resistant long
non-coding rnas associated lung cancer metastasis found kaposi's
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, trna-like sequences occurring certain
plant viruses. three structures reveal three different mechanisms to
protect rnas decay suggest rna structure-based nuclease resistance may
be widespread mechanism regulation.
