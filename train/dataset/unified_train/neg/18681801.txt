viral infections major cause mortality use vaccination and
antiviral drugs became widespread. last 10 years, immunologists have
made tremendous progress dissecting mechanisms contribute success 
of vaccines, understanding molecular cellular basis innate
immunity, recognizing complexity immunological memory. virologists 
have also made great progress elucidating molecular mechanisms how
viruses evade, manipulate, interact host cellular processes. spite of
these advances, basic mechanisms antiviral immunity host
are still poorly understood due complexity specificity virus-host
interactions. report advances recent keystone symposia "viral
immunity," organized keystone, colorado january 20-25, 2008 jack r.
