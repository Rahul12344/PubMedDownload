background: individuals infected human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) a
higher risk cardiovascular disease general population. specific
effects virological immunological parameters risk myocardial
infarction (mi) hiv-infected individuals debated.
methods: conducted nested case-control study within french hospital
database hiv. case patients (n = 289) patients who, january 2000 
and december 2006, prospectively recorded validated first mi. 5
hiv-infected controls (n = 884) matched age, sex, clinical center were
selected, random replacement, among patients history mi.
conditional logistic regression models used identify predictors the
risk mi.
results: plasma hiv-1 rna levels >50 copies/ml, low cd4 t-cell nadir, a
high cd8 t-cell count independently associated increased risk mi,
with respective odds ratios 1.51 (95% confidence interval, 1.09-2.10), 0.90
(.83-.97) per log(2) unit, 1.48 (1.01-2.18) highest tertile cd8
t-cell counts (>1150 cells/mm(3)) compared lowest (≤760 cells/mm(3)).
conclusions: independently cardiovascular risk factors antiretroviral
therapy, hiv replication, low cd4 t-cell nadir high current cd8 t-cell
count associated increased risk mi hiv-infected individuals.
this suggests new paths interventions diminish risk mi in
hiv-infected patients.
