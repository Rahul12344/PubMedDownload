a 12-kda protein redox-active dithiol active site -cys-gly-pro-cys-, 
human thioredoxin 1 (trx) demonstrated excellent anti-inflammatory effect 
in various animal models. trx induced various oxidative stress factors,
including ultraviolet rays, radiation, oxidation, viral infections, ischemia
reperfusion anticancer agents, involved pathogenesis and
progression various diseases. demonstrated systemic
administration transgenic overexpression trx effective wide
variety in vivo inflammatory disease models, viral pneumonia, acute
lung injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, indomethacin-induced gastric 
injury, dermatitis. recent studies indicate topically applied trx
prevents skin inflammation via inhibition local formation inflammatory 
cytokines chemokines. indicate activation inflammasome in
skin mucosa may regulated trx. suggest application trx
may useful treatment various skin mucosal inflammatory
disorders. based results, conducting clinical studies develop 
human recombinant thioredoxin 1 (rhtrx) pharmaceuticals. also developed
substances increase expression trx body (trx-inducing
substances) vegetables plant ingredients, also developing
skin-care products functional foods take advantage the
anti-inflammation anti-allergic action trx.
