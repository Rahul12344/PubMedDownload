oropharyngeal candidiasis associated defects cell-mediated immunity
and commonly seen human immunodeficiency virus positive individuals and
aids patients. model oral candidiasis t-cell-deficient balb/c and
cba/cah nu/nu mice established. inoculation 10(8) candida albicans
yeasts, mice displayed increased levels oral colonization compared to
euthymic control mice developed chronic oropharyngeal infection.
histopathological examination nu/nu oral tissues revealed extensive hyphae
penetrating epithelium, polymorphonuclear leukocyte microabscess
formation. adoptive transfer either naive immune lymphocytes into
immunodeficient mice resulted recovery animals oral
infection. reconstitution immunodeficient mice naive cd4(+) not
cd8(+) cells significantly decreased oral colonization compared controls.
interleukin-12 gamma interferon detected draining lymph nodes 
immunodeficient mice following reconstitution naive lymphocytes. study 
demonstrates direct requirement lymphocytes recovery oral
candidiasis suggests associated production cytokines
by cd4(+) helper cells.
