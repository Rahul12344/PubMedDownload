jc virus, human neurotropic polyomavirus, established etiologic agent of
the fatal demyelinating disease, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy,
which usually affects individuals defects cell-mediated immunity.
cytolytic destruction oligodendrocytes, myelin-producing cells the
central nervous system attributed mechanism jcv induces
demyelination. pml one time rare complication however much
more common disease affecting patients ages due prevalence aids.
of interest, vitro evidence points cooperative interaction jcv
and hiv-1, via hiv-1 regulatory protein, tat. addition, jcv been
demonstrated induce tumors neural origin several animal models,
including rodents non-human primates, several clinical reports have
suggested possible association jcv glial-origin tumors humans.
the viral regulatory protein, t-antigen, shown play key role 
in orchestrating events viral lytic cycle, also capable altering
cellular functions, nature direct interaction cellular regulatory 
proteins effect cellular transcription. review, discuss 
clinical aspects pml, ability jcv induce tumors animal models,
and ability jcv t-antigen alter cellular function vitro.
