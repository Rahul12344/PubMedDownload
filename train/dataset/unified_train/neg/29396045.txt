innate immune responses known influence subsequent development of
adaptive immunity. previously shown rsv infection human airway
epithelial cells results production b cell growth factor, baff. to
better understand airway responds rsv infection production 
and factors support enhance local b cell responses infection, we
analysed lung expression baff b cell homeostatic chemokines cxcl12,
cxcl13, ccl19 ccl21 murine model rsv infection. following infection
with a2 strain rsv, highest rsv n gene expression observed day 4 after
challenge virus. contrast, two peaks elevated baff expression days 
2 7 observed. cxcl13 significantly elevated days 1, 2 7.
cxcl12, ccl19 ccl21 expressed within lung tissue control rsv
challenged animals significant difference expression found.
immunofluorescence showed baff present throughout tissue however cxcl13
expression localized cell rich areas probably constituting lymphoid
aggregates. results define kinetics b cell chemoattractant growth 
factor expression rsv infection indicate important role these
cytokines airway response rsv infection.
