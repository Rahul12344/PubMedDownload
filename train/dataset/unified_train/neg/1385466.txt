an assay involving reverse transcription followed polymerase chain reaction
specifically detected tobacco rattle virus rna extracts infected plants. it
detected wide range serological variants typical non-particle producing 
nm-type isolates. sensitivity method sufficient detect trv rna 
in 10 ng total nucleic acid infected plant, relatively crude
nucleic acid preparation 60 micrograms infected leaf tissue.
