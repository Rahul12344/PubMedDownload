zika virus (zikv) recently emerged global health concern owing its
widespread diffusion association severe neurological symptoms and
microcephaly newborns1. however, molecular mechanisms responsible
for pathogenicity zikv remain largely unknown. use human neural
progenitor cells neuronal cell line sk-n-be2 integrated proteomics 
approach characterize cellular responses viral infection the
proteome phosphoproteome level, use affinity proteomics identify
cellular targets zikv proteins. using approach, identify 386
zikv-interacting proteins, zikv-specific pan-flaviviral activities well as
host factors known functions neuronal development, retinal defects and
infertility. moreover, analysis identified 1,216 phosphorylation sites that
are specifically up- downregulated zikv infection, indicating profound
modulation fundamental signalling pathways akt, mapk-erk atm-atr
and thereby providing mechanistic insights proliferation arrest elicited
by zikv infection. functionally, integrative study identifies zikv
host-dependency factors provides comprehensive framework system-level
understanding zikv-induced perturbations levels proteins and
cellular pathways.
