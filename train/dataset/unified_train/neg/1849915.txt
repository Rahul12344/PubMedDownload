despite growing information effects human respiratory virus infection
on airway physiology, little information available mechanisms of
pathology pathophysiology infections. human respiratory
pathogens, parainfluenza virus types 2 3 (hpiv2, hpiv3, respectively),
clinically cause laryngotracheobronchitis (infection large proximal
airways). order examine pathobiology viruses airway cells
of human origin, exposed primary cultures human tracheal epithelial cells. 
primary cultures human tracheal epithelial cells readily infected by
these agents: cells exposed hpiv2 hpiv3 expressed viral antigens
(demonstrated indirect immunofluorescence assay), produced infectious virus,
and demonstrated cytopathic effects (including early syncytium formation). peak
viral titers 2 x 10(7) plaque-forming units per milliliter obtained,
similar titers permissive cv-1 cells. trypan blue staining direct
cell counts demonstrated difference viability control and
infected cells infected cells began detach culture
substrate. however, infected cells release significantly ldh control
cells 48 h following infection multiplicity infection 1
virus/target cell. system provides model studying effects of
infection human tracheal epithelium human respiratory viral pathogens
without confounding interactions cell tissue types.
