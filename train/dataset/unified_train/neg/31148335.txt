objectives: clinical significance low-level viraemia (llv) during
antiretroviral therapy (art) debated. retrospectively investigated
longitudinal levels plasma markers associated inflammation, altered
coagulation cardiovascular disease swedish hiv-positive adults relation
to llv permanent virological suppression long-term art.
methods: plasma levels c-reactive protein (crp), d-dimer, vascular cell
adhesion molecule 1 (vcam-1), suppression tumorigenicity 2 (st2), growth
differentiation factor 15 (gdf-15), soluble cd14 (scd14), soluble cd163 (scd163),
interferon-γ-induced protein 10 (ip-10) β-2-microglobulin measured 34
individuals llv (viral load 50-999 hiv-1 rna copies/ml) matched
controls persistent virological suppression. biomarker levels analysed 
in samples obtained episodes llv follow-up samples obtained 1 year 
later (with similar timing controls). biomarkers analysed using an
independent sample t-test analysis covariance (ancova) logarithmic
transformation. log-rank analysis applied markers concentration
values range.
results: compared controls, patients llv significantly higher
levels gdf-15 [geometric mean 3416 (95% confidence interval (ci) 804-14 516)
pg/ml versus 2002 (95% ci 355-11 295) pg/ml controls; p = 0.026] d-dimer
[mean 1114 (95% ci 125-9917) ng/ml versus 756 (95% ci 157-3626) ng/ml; p = 0.038]
after adjustment age, cd4 count nadir type art. unadjusted
t-test, gdf-15 significantly higher log-rank test, both
gdf-15 d-dimer significantly elevated. significant differences were
observed biomarkers analysed.
conclusions: although levels inflammation markers similar art
recipients without llv, persons llv significantly higher levels
of gdf-15 d-dimer. findings suggest potential link llv and
cardiovascular outcomes.
