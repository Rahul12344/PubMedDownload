elephantiasis considered cutaneous region immune deficiency with
cobblestone-like surface caused wart-like eruption. verrucosis diffuse 
human papillomavirus (hpv) infection linked immunodeficiency disorders. the
objective study examine prevalence hpv infection in
lymphedema pathogenic role elephantiasis. retrospective case-control
study performed examining lymphedematous skin controls peritumoral
normal skin. hpv infection evaluated dna, protein, histopathologic
levels polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, light microscopy, 
respectively. overall, 540 hpv dnas detected 120 122 cutaneous samples
(median 4 hpv dnas per sample, range 0-9). compared controls, differences
existed type number hpvs identified. instead, diverse spectrum of
hpv-related histopathologies evident, likely reflecting multiplicity 
hpv genotypes detected. notably, increasing histopathologic lymphedema stage
significantly correlated markers productive hpv infection altered
keratohyaline granules hpv l1 capsid expression. limitations study
are absence normal skin controls associated neoplasia or
subclinical lymphedema, lack assessment hpv copy number per
keratinocyte infected. conclusion, productive hpv infection, hpv type or
numbers detected, distinguished lymphedematous skin controls. findings
support theory lymphedema creates region depressed immunity that
permits productive hpv infection, manifested clinically diffuse
papillomatosis, characteristic elephantiasis.
