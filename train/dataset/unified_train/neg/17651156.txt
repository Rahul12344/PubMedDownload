background: infection influenza virus associated seemingly
opposing effects development asthma. however, data about
the effects mucosal vaccination inactivated influenza inception of
allergic asthma.
objective: assess immunological effects inhaled inactivated influenza
vaccine, using two different types flu vaccines, inception allergic 
sensitization allergen-mediated airway disease mouse model.
methods: balb/c mice intranasally intratracheally vaccinated whole
or split influenza virus vaccine (days -1 -1, 27) systemic
sensitization ovalbumin (ova) (days 1, 14) repeated airway allergen
challenges (days 28-30). allergen sensitization (ige serum levels), airway
inflammation (differential cells bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) airway
hyper-reactivity (ahr) (in vivo lung function) analysed.
results: intranasal instillation whole influenza vaccine allergen
sensitization significantly reduced serum levels total ova-specific
ige well allergen-induced ahr. prevention due allergen-specific
shift predominant helper (th)2- towards th1-immune response.
application split influenza vaccine show preventive effect.
conclusion: intranasal administration inactivated whole influenza vaccine
reduced subsequent allergen sensitization prevented allergen-induced ahr. our
results show composition influenza vaccine major influence 
on subsequent development allergen-induced sensitization ahr, suggest 
that mucosal inactivated whole influenza vaccination may represent step towards
the development preventive strategy atopic asthma.
