viral replication depends specific interactions host factors. for
example, poliovirus rna replication requires association intracellular
membranes. brefeldin (bfa), induces major rearrangement cellular
secretory apparatus, potent inhibitor poliovirus rna replication. most
aspects governing relationship viral replication complex host
membranes remain poorly defined. explore interactions, used genetic
approach isolated bfa-resistant poliovirus variants. mutations within viral
proteins 2c 3a render poliovirus resistant bfa. absence bfa,
viruses containing either mutations replicated similarly wild
type. presence bfa, viruses carrying single mutation 2c 3a
exhibited intermediate-growth phenotype, double mutant fully
resistant. viral proteins 2c 3a critical roles rna
replication vesicle formation. identification bfa resistant mutants
may facilitate identification cellular membrane-associated proteins
necessary induction vesicle formation rna replication. importantly,
our data underscore dramatic plasticity host-virus interactions
required successful viral replication.
