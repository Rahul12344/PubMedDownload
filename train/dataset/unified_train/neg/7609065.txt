rabies, continuing worldwide problem, kills tens thousands people and
millions animals year. problem severe developing
countries, cell culture-derived vaccines unaffordable available
nervous tissue-derived vaccines often questionable immunogenicity may 
produce neurological complications. determine feasibility developing 
vaccine worldwide applicability, investigated whether recombinant
vaccinia viruses expressing either glycoprotein (g), nucleoprotein (n),
or g n (gn) challenge virus strain (cvs) rabies virus
would cross-protect mice 17 rabies virus isolates representing the
spectrum rabies virus variants found worldwide. results compared with
the commercially available human diploid cell vaccine (hdcv). among mice injected
with 17 viruses, > = 95% protected vaccination with
recombinant viruses expressing g gn, > = 85% mice protected
by hdcv. recombinant virus expressing n less protective, protecting
against 11 17 viruses. antibody prepared g strains
used vaccines neutralized 17 viruses, sera mice infected with
any one virus variant cross-neutralized viruses. thus, no
antigenic differences would potentiate vaccine failures identified.
these studies suggest single rabies virus strain g would protect
globally wild-type rabies viruses.
