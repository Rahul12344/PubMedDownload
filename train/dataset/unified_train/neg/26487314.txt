in spring 2006, four human cases parapoxvirus infections missouri
residents reported centers disease control prevention (cdc), 
two initially diagnosed cutaneous anthrax. investigation
was conducted determine level recognition zoonotic parapoxvirus
infections prevention measures, degree veterinarians may be
consulted human infections forces behind perceived increase
in reported infections. interviews conducted clinical environmental 
sampling performed. swab scab specimens analyzed real-time
polymerase chain reaction (pcr), whereas serum specimens evaluated for
parapoxvirus antibodies. three case patients found fed ill juvenile 
animals without using gloves. forty-six percent veterinarians reported 
been consulted regarding suspected human orf infections. orf virus dna was
detected five 25 asymptomatic sheep. analysis extracellular envelope
gene sequences indicated sheep goat isolates clustered a
species-preferential fashion. parapoxvirus infections common missouri
ruminants handlers. infected persons often seek medical care;
some may seek advice veterinarians rather physicians. initial
perception increased incidence missouri may arisen reporting
artifact stemming heightened concern anthrax. asymptomatic
