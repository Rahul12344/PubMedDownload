a number proteins isolated human cells basis their
ability support dna replication vitro simian virus 40 (sv40) origin 
of dna replication. one protein, replication factor c (rfc), functions 
the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (pcna), replication protein (rpa), and
dna polymerase delta synthesize leading strand replication fork. to
determine whether proteins perform similar roles replication dna 
from origins cellular chromosomes, begun characterize functionally 
homologous proteins yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. rfc s.
cerevisiae purified ability stimulate yeast dna polymerase delta on
a primed single-stranded dna template presence yeast pcna rpa. like
its human-cell counterpart, rfc s. cerevisiae (scrfc) associated
dna-activated atpase activity well primer-template, structure-specific
dna binding activity. analogy phage t4 sv40 dna replication in
vitro systems, yeast rfc, pcna, rpa, dna polymerase delta activities
function together leading-strand dna replication complex. rfc 
s. cerevisiae purified, seven cellular factors previously shown to
be required sv40 dna replication vitro identified s.
