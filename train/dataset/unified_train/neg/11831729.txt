phosphorylation status sendai virus p protein examined virus
infection compared cell-free phosphorylation. p protein sendai
virus-infected (vi) p/c gene-transfected (pt) mammalian cells from
purified virions (pv) phosphorylated serine residues. contrast,
cell-free phosphorylation p protein virion-associated protein kinase 
(vapk) occurred threonine serine. tryptic phosphopeptide maps 
p protein vi, pt, pv showed phosphorylation primarily
localized one peptide (tp1), vapk phosphorylated p protein on
several peptides. change steady-state phosphopeptide map of
the p protein virus replication, indicating tp1 constitutively
phosphorylated. inhibition cellular phosphatases (pp1 pp2a) okadaic
acid (oa) virus-infected cells caused sixfold increase p protein
phosphorylation, solely serine residues. phosphopeptide map oa-p
protein revealed phosphorylation occurred several peptides, oa-p 
map significantly different vapk-p map. however, additional
phosphorylation p protein block association with
nucleocapsids. results suggest sendai virus p protein is
constitutively phosphorylated primarily one locus potential for
phosphorylation additional sites. further, results show any
correlations intracellular cell-free phosphorylation p
protein and, therefore, question validity cell-free phosphorylations.
