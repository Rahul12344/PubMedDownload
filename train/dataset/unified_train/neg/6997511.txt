sequence relationship glycosylated unglycosylated gag polyproteins of
moloney murine leukemia virus.

edwards sa, fan h.

both glycosylated unglycosylated polyproteins coded gag gene are
produced cells infected moloney murine leukemia virus. gpp80gag a
glycosylated precursor larger gag glycoprotein exported cell surface,
whereas pr65gag unglycosylated precursor virion internal structural 
proteins. gpp80gag contains carbohydrate, also additional
polypeptide sequences found pr65gag. experiment reported here, we
localized differences gpp80gag pr65gag respect the
domains individual gag proteins. done comparison partial
proteolytic cleavage fragments pr65gag, gpp80gag, the
unglycosylated form gpp80gag (p75gag) immunoprecipitated by
antisera specific gag proteins p30, p15, p10. conclude the
additional polypeptide sequences gpp80gag located near the
amino terminus polyprotein. carbohydrate gpp80gag attached to
polypeptide sequences held common gpp80gag pr65gag.
