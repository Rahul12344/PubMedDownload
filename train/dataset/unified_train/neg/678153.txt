tick-borne encephalitis virus localized nerve cells intracellular
spaces. according nature ultrastructural changes, pathological
process nerve cells may divided three stages connected stages
of virus reproduction. first stage, protein-synthesizing systems of
the cell degraded. second stage specific virus inclusions form 
cell cytoplasm aggregates mature immature virions alongside with
destruction ultrastructures growth smooth membranes. third stage
degradation neurons accompanied necrobiosis discomplexation the
surrounding glial elements, processes, cells inflammatory infiltrate and
capillary walls. certain combination nonspecific changes organelles of
various cells viral inclusions makes ultrastructural picture the
focus lesions tick-borne encephalitis sufficiently characteristic for
differential pathological diagnosis.
