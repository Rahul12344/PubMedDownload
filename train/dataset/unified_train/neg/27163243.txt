multipurpose prevention technologies (mpts) preferably single dosage forms
designed simultaneously address multiple sexual reproductive health needs,
such unintended pregnancy, hiv infection sexually transmitted
infections (stis). manuscript describes development range of
multi-layered vaginal tablets, immediate sustained release layers
capable delivering antiretroviral drug dapivirine, contraceptive
hormone levonorgestrel, anti-herpes simplex virus drug acyclovir at
independent release rates single dosage form. depending design of
the tablet relation type (immediate sustained release) number 
layers, dose drug could individually controlled. example one
tablet design able provide immediate release three drugs, while
another tablet design able provide immediate release acyclovir and
levonorgestrel, providing sustained release dapivirine 8h. a
third tablet design able provide immediate release acyclovir and
levonorgestrel, large initial burst dapivirine, followed sustained
release dapivirine 8h. tablets passed test for
friability percent friability less 1%. hardness tablet 
designs 115 153n, drug content met european
pharmacopeia 2.9.40 uniformity dosage units acceptance value levels 1 and
2. finally, accelerated stability three actives significantly
enhanced comparison mixed drug control.
