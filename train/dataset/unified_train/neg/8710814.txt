an improved method long-term perfusion isolated human term placental
lobule developed investigate maternofetal transfer infectious 
agents, particular human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). purpose this
paper describe modifications allow substantially prolonged
perfusions biohazard environment. method described adapted
from previous models. perfusion apparatus modified use within 
biohazard hood, and, intravenous bags contain medium circulation of
perfusates closed circuits. mera silox-s 0.3 membrane oxygenator delivers
more oxygen tissue, and, electromedic cardioplegia heat exchangers warm
the perfusate prior oxygenation. viability criteria (glucose consumption,
lactate production, de novo production human placental lactogen (hpl), volume 
loss, flow, temperature, pressure, oxygen transfer, carbon dioxide production,
absence igm transfer light electron microscopy) demonstrate the
placental tissue remains functional state throughout perfusion. oxygen
and glucose consumption stable time; lactate levels remain
constant; hpl continues produced. significant modifications of
the perfusion system permitted investigators increase duration of
perfusion 48 h preserving normal metabolic function ultrastructurally
intact tissue demonstrated ultra structural observations. perfusion
model device provides biohazard precautions may applied studies
of placental physiology.
