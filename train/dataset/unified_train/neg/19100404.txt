aim: report renal graft outcomes among series patients underwent 
simultaneous combined liver-kidney transplantations (clkt) heart-kidney
transplantations (chkt) single center.
methods: 1975 december 31, 2007, performed 1524 kidney
transplantations, 427 liver transplantations, 483 heart transplantations,
including 7 simultaneous clkt 2 chkt. analysed main patient
characteristics, renal graft outcomes, patient survivals.
results: clkt indications follows: alcoholic cirrhosis (n = 5) and
hepatitis c virus (n = 2) chronic glomerulonephritis (n = 5), hypertensive
nephropathy (n = 1), polycystic disease (n = 1). cold renal ischemia time was
6.9 hours (range, 6-9). 5 patients kidney rejection episodes; 3 
of patients alive creatinine levels 1.4 1.7 mg/dl with
an average follow-up 6.9 years (range, 10 months-8 years). one patient died of
esophageal cancer 13 years transplantation serum creatinine level
of 1.16 mg/dl another died breast cancer 7 years transplantation 
with creatinine level 1.1 mg/dl. one patient lost renal graft after
the kidney transplantation due renal vein thrombosis. last patient
suffered 1 episode acute rejection lost kidney 5 years later due to
chronic rejection. chkt indications follow: dilated myocardiopathy (n =
2) chronic glomerulonephritis (n = 1) interstitial nephropathy (n = 1).
the cold renal ischemia time 4 hours. acute rejection episodes.
one patient alive creatinine level 2.05 mg/dl 6 years the
transplantation; patient lost kidney due chronic rejection at
270 days simultaneous chkt, 2 years later received second kidney that
is functioning normally.
conclusions: simultaneous clkt chkt selected cases provided satisfactory
long-term outcomes graft function patient survival lesser number
of acute rejection episodes nonsimultaneous transplantations. are
worthy options patients liver heart failure associated renal
failure.
