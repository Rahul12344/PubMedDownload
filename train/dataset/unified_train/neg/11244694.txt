introduction: dynamics immune response central nervous system (csn) 
different well-known switch igm synthesis igg synthesis blood.
objective: broadcast behavior factors involved dynamics the
intrathecal immune response infectious neurological disorders.
development: lack switch igm class response igg response could
be related regulation-modulation mechanisms cns immune response
than differs blood different cytokines composition, possibility
of chemokines synthesis neuroinflammatory process, the
neuroimmune-endocrine mechanisms. immune pattern stable like
neuroborreliosis, modify like herpes simplex meningoencephalitis.
it could typical pattern like neisseria meningitidis
meningoencephalitis neurotuberculosis. also pattern could still
detectable many years sufficient treatment complete recovery the
symptom-free patients like neurosyphilis advanced precocious response
during childhood. hiv encephalopathy pattern remains during
the evolution virus infections, like echo 6 coxsackie b5, depends
on biological agent.
conclusions: order know acuity disease, know the
physiopathologic characteristics biological agents, time courses,
locations pathological processes, host age. main signs in
cerebrospinal fluid acute, active disease cns increased of
cerebrospinal fluid cell count increased albumin ratio.
