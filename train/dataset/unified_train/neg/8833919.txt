a severe complication dengue virus infection, dengue hemorrhagic fever (dhf), 
is hypothesized immunologically mediated virus-specific cytotoxic t
lymphocytes (ctls) may trigger dhf. also likely dengue virus-specific 
ctls important recovery dengue virus infections. little
available information human cd8+ cell responses dengue viruses.
memory cd8+ctl responses analyzed determine diversity cell
response dengue virus identify immunodominant proteins using pbmc 
eight healthy adult volunteers received monovalent, live-attenuated
candidate vaccines four dengue serotypes. donors specific t
cell proliferation dengue flaviviruses tested. ctls 
generated stimulated pbmc donors, seven donors tested,
dengue virus-specific cd8+ctl activity demonstrated. nonstructural (ns3
and ns1.2a) envelope (e) proteins recognized cd8+ctls six, five,
and three donors, respectively. donors recognized either ns3 ns1.2a. in
one donor received dengue 4 vaccine, ctl killing seen bulk culture
against premembrane protein (prm). first demonstration ctl
response prm protein. ctl responses using pbmc two donors 
were serotype specific, whereas donors serotype-cross-reactive
responses. one donor, ctls specific e, ns1.2a, ns3 proteins 
hla-b44 restricted. three donors tested, potential restricting
alleles recognition ns3 b38, a24, and/or b62 b35. results
indicate cd8+ctl responses humans immunization one
serotype dengue virus diverse directed variety proteins. 
the ns3 ns1.2a proteins considered designing subunit vaccines 
for dengue.
