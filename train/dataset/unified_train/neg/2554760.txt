techniques analyzing dna distributions agarose gels examined both
two-dimensional one-dimensional methods. demonstrated large
errors dna concentration occur analyses unless (i) electrophoresis
is performed careful, reproducible manner, (ii) films calibrated
with internal standard, (iii) high resolution densitometry used for
analyzing films, (iv) appropriate background controls used to
determine baselines integration. two-dimensional scanning produces more
accurate results one-dimensional scanning, cases bands 
relatively uniform, one-dimensional analysis gives good results. technique 
for determining accurate distributions described.
