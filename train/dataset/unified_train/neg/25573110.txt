infection history unrelated pathogens alters disease outcome resulting in
either enhanced protective immunity increased immunopathology new
infections, (3) epidemiological human vaccine studies demonstrate
vaccines beneficial detrimental effects subsequent unrelated
infections. results epidemiological heterologous immunity
studies suggest immune system tremendous plasticity each
new infection vaccine individual exposed lifetime 
potentially alter dynamics immune system. also suggests each
