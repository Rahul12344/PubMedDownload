bacteriophages key players evolution bacteria. temperate
phages associated virulence deadliest pathogenic
bacteria. among notorious cases, genes encoding botulinum
neurotoxin produced clostridium botulinum types c d and α-toxin (tcna)
produced clostridium novyi are encoded within prophage genomes.
clostridium difficile another important human pathogen recent
identification complete binary toxin locus (cdtloc) carried c.
difficile prophage raises potential horizontal transfer toxin genes by
mobile genetic elements. although tcda tcdb toxins produced c.
difficile never found outside pathogenicity locus (paloc), some
prophages still influence production. prophages alter the
expression several metabolic regulatory genes c. difficile, well 
cell surface proteins cwpv, confers phage resistance. homologs of
an agr-like quorum sensing system identified c. difficile
prophage, suggesting could possibly participate cell-cell
communication. yet, c. difficile prophages contain riboswitches predicted
to recognize secondary messenger molecule c-di-gmp involved bacterial
multicellular behaviors. altogether, recent findings clostridial phages
underline diversity mechanisms intricate relationship linking phages
with host. here, milestone discoveries linking phages virulence some
of pathogenic clostridial species retraced, focus c.
botulinum, c. novyi, c. difficile, clostridium perfringens phages, 
evidences mostly available.
