dicer-2 central player small interfering rna biogenesis the
drosophila rna interference (rnai) pathway. intriguingly, found dicer-2
has unconventional rnai-independent function positively modulates toll
immune signaling, defends gram-positive bacteria, fungi, some
viruses, cells adult flies. loss dicer-2 expression makes
fruit flies susceptible fungal infection. revealed that
dicer-2 posttranscriptionally modulates toll signaling dicer-2 is
required proper expression toll protein toll protein
stability toll mrna transcription. moreover, dicer-2 directly binds 3' 
untranslated region (3'utr) toll mrna via paz (piwi/argonaute/zwille)
domain required protein translation mediated toll 3'utr. loss
of toll 3'utr binding activity makes dicer-2 incapable promoting toll
signaling. data indicate interaction dicer-2 toll mrna
plays pivotal role toll immune signaling. addition, found dicer-2
is also required toll signaling induced two different rna viruses in
drosophila cells. consequently, findings uncover novel rnai-independent
function dicer-2 posttranscriptional regulation toll protein
expression signaling, indicate unexpected intersection rnai pathway
and toll pathway, provide new insights toll immune signaling,
drosophila dicer-2, probably dicer dicer-related proteins other
organisms.
