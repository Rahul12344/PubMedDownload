880 individuals, 120 exposed rabid animals, immunized pre- 
or post-exposure 2 different bpl-inactivated concentrated rabies
vaccines prepared hdc strains wi-38 mrc-5. vaccines well
tolerated major side effects observed primary immunization with
3-10 doses 1 booster vaccination. dynamics neutralizing, antibody
formation persistence antibodies 4 different groups vaccinees are
described. groups vaccinated pre-exposure (i) days 0, 28 56; (ii)
on days 0, 7 14; (iii) days 0, 3, 7 21; (iv) post-exposure days
0, 3, 7, 14, 30 90. high antibody levels--persisting least 30
months--were obtained patients. cft, using concentrated purified
virion antigen, highly specific rabies virus antibody demonstration.
since 50 patients severe risk, bitten and/or
scratched proven rabid animals, single breakthough immunity was
observed observation time 1/2 3 years, protective
effect hdcs-rabies vaccines seems excellent. regard their
high immunogenicity extremely low reactogenicity, new hdcs-vaccines can
be recommended prophylactic post-exposure immunization man without any
reserve. data simultaneous application homologous anti-rabies gammaglobulin
from man (20 i.e./kg body-weight) hdcs-vaccines also presented and
discussed.
