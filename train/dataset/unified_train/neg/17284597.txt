apoptosis suggested one major mechanisms cd4+ cell
depletion course hiv type 1 (hiv-1) infection. here, show that
interleukin 7 (il-7), nonredundant cytokine plays essential roles the
generation homeostasis cell compartment immune system, exerts
strong antiapoptotic effects ex vivo cd4+ cd8+ cells derived from
hiv-1-infected subjects. level il-7-mediated reduction apoptosis was
inversely correlated number circulating cd4+ cells, indicating a
higher sensitivity il-7 effects patients advanced disease. the
antiapoptotic effect il-7 uncoupled induction cellular
proliferation endogenous hiv-1 replication. results provide further
rationale consideration il-7 agent immune reconstitution hiv-1
infection.
