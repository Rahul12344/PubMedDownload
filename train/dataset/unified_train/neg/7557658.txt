twenty-three lots five antithrombin iii (at iii) concentrates four
manufacturers analyzed single-blind study. preparations had
been virus-inactivated pasteurization, one concentrate also been
treated solvent/detergent (s/d). iii activities determined using two
thrombin-based one factor xa-based chromogenic substrate assays. iii
antigen measured kinetic nephelometry. iii assays tested
against first international reference preparation coded 72/1. addition, at
iii characterized crossed immunoelectrophoresis presence heparin
and gel filtration. following quantified: heparin cofactor ii
activity antigen content, heparin activity, thrombin-at iii complexes, at
iii-protease complexes, total protein, albumin, immunoglobulins, glucose ph. 
the iii concentrates differed markedly terms purity potency.
the specific activities iii ratios iii activity antigen
content ranged 3.4 6.9 0.63 0.84, respectively. highest
values found five lots concentrate treated both
pasteurization s/d. preparation one virtually free
of denaturated iii, judged crossed immunoelectrophoresis. marked
batch-to-batch variation iii potencies found two five
preparations analyzed. two five lots one manufacturer, the
measured potencies 10% lower declared potencies.(abstract
