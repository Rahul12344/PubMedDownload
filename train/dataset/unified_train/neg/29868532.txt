background: dengue one geographically significant mosquito-borne
viral diseases transmitted aedes mosquitoes. blood feeding, mosquitoes 
deposit salivary proteins induce antibody responses. related to
the intensity exposure bites. mosquito salivary proteins, d7
proteins, known potent allergens. antibody response d7 proteins can
be used marker evaluate risk exposure disease transmission and
provide critical information understanding dynamics vector-host
interactions.
methods: study conducted los patios hospital, cucuta, norte de
santander, colombia. total 63 participants enrolled study.
participants categorized three disease status groups, age groups, and
socioeconomic strata. level igg antibodies d7 aedes proteins was
determined elisa. used statistical approach determine an
association antibody levels factors age, living conditions,
and dengue virus (denv) infection.
results: found igg antibodies d7 proteins higher non-denv
infected individuals comparison denv-infected participants. also, age
factor showed significant positive correlation igg antibodies d7
proteins, living conditions (socioeconomic stratification), people
aged 20â€‰years older, statistically significant factor variability
of igg antibodies d7 proteins.
conclusion: pilot study represents first approximation elucidate 
correlation antibody response mosquito d7 salivary proteins
and correlation age, living conditions, denv infection dengue
endemic area.
