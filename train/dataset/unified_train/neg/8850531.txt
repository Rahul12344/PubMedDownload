we expressed human thiopurine methyltransferase cdna baculovirus
vector sf21 (spodoptera frugiperda) cells. system expresses enzyme at
levels thiopurine methyltransferase enzyme may readily
visualised coomassie blue stained sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis. expressed enzyme catalysed methylation of
6-mercaptopurine apparent km 892 microm, similar observed in
human liver cytosol ie. 657 microm however, vmax 13,500 pmole/mg/min,
which approximately 400 times higher vmax observed human liver
cytosol ie. 33 pmole/mg/min. thiopurine methyltransferase inhibitors
6-thioxanthine, p-methoxybenzoic acid 3,5-dimethoxy benzoic acid found
to potent inhibitors expressed enzyme.
