protein nativity one critical factors quality antigens 
used immunogens reactivities resultant antibodies. the
preparation purification native viral antigens conventional cell-based 
protein expression systems often accompanied technical hardships. these
challenges attributable mainly protein aggregation insolubility during
expression purification, well low expression levels associated 
with toxicity viral proteins. here, describe novel approach 
the production monoclonal antibodies (mabs) nucleocapsid protein (np) 
of middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov). using wheat
germ cell-free protein synthesis system, successfully prepared large amounts
of mers-cov np antigen state highly soluble intact for
immunization. following mouse immunization hybridoma generation, selected 
seven hybridoma clones produced mabs exclusive reactivity against
mers-cov np. epitope mapping subsequent bioinformatic analysis revealed 
these mabs recognized epitopes located within relatively highly conserved regions
of mers-cov amino-acid sequence. consistently, mabs exhibited obvious 
cross-reactivity nps derived related viruses, including sars
coronavirus. determining optimal combinations mabs, we
developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay rapid immunochromatographic 
antigen detection test reliably used laboratory diagnosis of
mers-cov. thus, study provides strong evidence wheat germ cell-free
system useful production diagnostic mabs emerging
pathogens.
