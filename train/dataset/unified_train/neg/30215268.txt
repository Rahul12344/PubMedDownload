the aim study describe hiv care continuum emergency
department (ed) patients eastern cape region south africa. a
cross-sectional, identity-unlinked serosurvey, whereby discarded/excess samples
from patients blood drawn study period routine care
and sufficient serum remaining tested hiv, hepatitis b virus, and
hepatitis c virus infection; hiv viral load (vl); presence antiretroviral 
(arv) drugs. also estimated cross-sectional incidence using the
limiting-antigen avidity assay hiv vl. study conducted between
september november 2016 frere hospital emergency department east
london, south africa. overall hiv prevalence study population was
26.9% [95% confidence interval (ci): 25.0-28.8; n = 2,100]. highest
prevalence observed among females 30-39 years age group [60.3% (95%
ci: 53.2-67.1)]. hiv prevalence significantly higher among females compared
with males 20-29 years age group 30-39 years age group (p < .05),
but nearly identical older age groups. arv drugs detected 53.5% (95%
ci: 48.1-58.9) hiv-infected subjects. frequency hiv viral suppression
(< 1,000 copies/ml) 48.5% (95% ci: 44.3-52.7), statistically
different males females (age-adjusted prevalence ratio = 1.15, 95%
ci: 0.95-1.39). hiv incidence rate estimated 2.6% (95% ci:
1.2-3.9). frere hospital ed extremely high burden hiv infection.
the detection arv drugs prevalence viral suppression fall short 
world health organization 90-90-90 goals population. furthermore, there
were large number patients recent infection ed. ed a
critical venue testing linkage care high-yield population are
likely missed current testing linkage-to-care programs.
