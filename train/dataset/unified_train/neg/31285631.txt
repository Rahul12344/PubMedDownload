we report neurodevelopmental outcomes 216 infants followed since time of
pcr-confirmed maternal zika virus (zikv) infection pregnancy rio de
janeiro epidemic 2015-2016 (refs. 1,2). neurodevelopment assessed by
bayley scales infant toddler development, third edition (bayley-iii;
cognitive, language motor domains) 146 children through
neurodevelopment questionnaires/neurological examinations 70 remaining
children. complete eye exams (n = 137) hearing assessments (n = 114) were
also performed. below-average neurodevelopment and/or abnormal eye hearing
assessments noted 31.5% children 7 32 months age. among
children assessed bayley-iii, 12% scored -2 s.d. (score <70; score 
100 ± 2 s.d. range) least one domain; 28% scored -1 
-2 s.d. domain (scores <85-70). language function affected, 
35% 146 children average. improved neurodevelopmental outcomes were
noted female children, term babies, children normal eye exams and
maternal infection later pregnancy (p = 0.01). noted resolution of
microcephaly normal neurodevelopment two eight children, development
