the proprotein convertase pc1/3 belongs subtilisin/kexin-like endoprotease
family synthesized preproenzyme. investigate function its
propeptide, murine propc1/3 prepropc1/3 isolated inclusion
bodies recombinant prepropc1/3 baculovirus-infected insect cells, rendered
soluble 6 guanidine hcl 20 mm dithiothreitol, purified gel
filtration metal-binding affinity chromatography. two nh2-terminal fragments 
containing complete propeptide 1-84 region obtained cnbr cleavage,
purified, chemically characterized. progress curve kinetic analysis with
enzymatically active murine 71-kda pc1/3 50-kda human furin demonstrated 
both fragments potent slow tight-binding inhibitors either enzyme ki
in low nanomolar range. additional cleavages trp residues yielded
fragment9-71, longer represents potent inhibitor. upon incubation at
ph 5.5 presence excess 71-kda murine pc1/3, nh2-terminal fragment1-98
is cleaved two sites, revealed western blotting using
nh2-terminal-directed pc1/3 antibodies. finally, murine pc2 inhibited the
propc1/31-98 peptide, albeit much lesser extent micromolar ki 
a strictly competitive manner. results suggest proregion pc1/3 
is important feature regulating activity.
