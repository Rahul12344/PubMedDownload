micrornas (mirnas) identified important post transcriptional
regulators gene expression. higher vertebrates, subset mirnas been
identified important regulators number key genes immune system gene
networks, paper review recent studies mirnas associated immune
response teleost fish. challenge studies conducted several species have
identified differently expressed mirnas associated viral bacterial
infection. results studies point several mirnas are
likely evolutionary conserved functions related immune
response teleost fish. changed expression levels mature mirnas the
five mirna genes mirna-462, mirna-731, mirna-146, mirna-181 mirna-223 are
observed following viral well bacterial infection several teleost fish. 
furthermore, significant changes expression mature mirnas five
genes mirna-21, mirna-155, mirna-1388, mirna-99 mirna-100 observed in
multiple studies virus infected fish changes expression mature
mirna three genes mirna-122, mirna-192 mirna-451 observed in
several studies fish bacterial infections. interestingly, these
genes present higher vertebrates. function evolutionary
conserved mirnas responding infection depends target gene(s) they
regulate. target genes identified large number target 
genes predicted silico analysis. results suggest many of
the targets genes host's immune response gene networks. propose a
model expected temporal changes mirna expression target immune
response activators/effector genes immune response inhibitors, respectively.
the best way understand function mirna identify target
gene(s), amount genome resources teleost fish limited, 
less well characterized genomes transcriptomes, identifying true target
genes mirnas associated immune response challenge.
identifying target genes applying new methods approaches likely 
be next important step understand function mirnas associated
with immune response teleost fish.
