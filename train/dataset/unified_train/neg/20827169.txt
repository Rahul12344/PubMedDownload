objective: human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected people exhibit high
incidence vascular diseases. since general population high
cardiovascular risk associated impaired endothelial cell
function, investigated circulating endothelial progenitor cells in
hiv-positive patients.
design: evaluated circulating colony-forming unit-endothelial cell (cfu-ec)
and endothelial colony-forming cell (ecfc) progenitors 14 antiviral
therapy-naive hiv-positive patients, comparison 15 normal controls.
methods: cfu-ec ecfc derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
hiv-infected hiv-uninfected individuals recovered evaluated hiv 
genome presence pcr. vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) and
apolipoprotein b mrna-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide like (apobec) subunits
expression evaluated infected colonies real-time pcr.
results: found circulating cfu-ec ecfc significantly reduced
in hiv-positive patients proviral hiv dna detectable cfu-ec 
but ecfc. furthermore, expression apobec subunits significantly
lower cfu-ec circulating monocytes. accordingly, cfu-ec displayed 
a high content proviral dna copies, suggesting cells high
sensitivity hiv infection.
conclusions: although hiv affect 'true endothelial progenitor'
compartment, infects strongly depletes circulating endothelial progenitors
with hematopoietic signature. unravel novel pathogenetic mechanism 
hiv infection might cause vascular diseases.
