importance: even though 15% 50% patients head neck squamous cell
carcinoma (hnscc) experience recurrence, relatively little known regarding
patterns treatment failure postrecurrence outcomes chemoradiotherapy
using modern radiation techniques (intensity-modulated radiotherapy [imrt]).
recurrence patterns significantly affected variations quality of
radiotherapy, may confound findings multicenter trials.
objective: assess patterns treatment failure postrecurrence outcomes
for patients hnscc treated contemporary radiotherapy techniques.
design, setting, participants: large single-institution cohort study
reviewed outcomes 1000 consecutive patients stage iii ivb
oropharyngeal carcinoma (n = 703), laryngeal carcinoma (n = 126), or
hypopharyngeal carcinoma (n = 46) treated definitive imrt without
concurrent chemotherapy, well patients oral cavity carcinoma (n = 125)
treated postoperative imrt without concurrent systemic therapy, from
december 1, 2001, december 31, 2013, median follow-up 65.1 months
among surviving patients. data analysis performed january 31, 2016, to
february 17, 2017.
main outcomes measures: patterns treatment failure overall survival
following locoregional failure distant metastasis.
results: among 1000 patients (186 women 814 men; mean [sd] age, 59.3
[10.8] years), marginal isolated out-of-radiation-field
failures. among subsites, cumulative incidence local failure highest
among patients oral cavity carcinoma vs oropharyngeal carcinoma
(hazard ratio, 5.2; 95% ci, 3.1-8.6; p < .001). furthermore, patients oral
cavity carcinoma experienced significantly shorter survival following distant
metastasis (hazard ratio, 3.66; 95% ci, 1.98-6.80; p < .001). patients with
oropharyngeal carcinoma positive human papillomavirus p16 lived longer
after locoregional failure compared patents oropharyngeal carcinoma
negative human papillomavirus p16 (median survival, 36.5 vs 13.6 months;
p = .007) distant metastasis. salvage surgery associated with
improved overall survival following locoregional failure (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95%
ci, 0.34-0.77; p = .001); oligometastatic disease (1 vs ≥2 lesions: hazard ratio,
0.32; 95% ci, 0.16-0.63; p = .001) associated improved overall survival 
following distant metastasis.
conclusions relevance: overall survival recurrence hnscc is
influenced hnscc subsite human papillomavirus p16 status, well
surgical systemic interventions. oligometastatic phenotype characterizes
patients solitary metastasis chemoradiotherapy. findings have
important implications clinical trial designs hnscc recurrent 
oligometastatic setting.
