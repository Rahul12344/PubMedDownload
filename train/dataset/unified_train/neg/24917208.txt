in study, dsrna specific vp28 gene white spot syndrome virus (wssv) of
shrimp synthesized escherichia coli large scale studied immune 
response shrimp dsrna-vp28. haematological parameters clotting 
time total haemocytes counts, immunological parameters as
prophenoloxidase (propo), superoxide dismutase (sod), superoxide anion (soa) 
malondialdehyde content, well mrna expression ten immune-related
genes examined estimate effect dsrna-vp28 innate immunity
of litopenaeus vannamei. activities propo, soa sod significantly
increased haemocyte dsrna-vp28 treatment, whereas mda content not
change significantly. among ten immune-related genes examined, mrna 
expression propo, cmnsod, haemocyanin, crustin, bgbp, lipopolysaccharides
(lps), lectin lysozyme haemocytes, gill hepatopancreas l. vannamei,
was significantly upregulated 12 h dsrna-vp28 treatment, no
significant expression changes observed toll receptor tumour receptor
genes. increase propo sod activities, soa level mrna
expression level propo, cmnsod, haemocyanin, crustin, bgbp, lps, lectin and
lysozyme dsrna-vp28 stimulation indicate immune-related genes
were involved dsrna-vp28-induced innate immunity shrimp.
