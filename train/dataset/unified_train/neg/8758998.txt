bicistronic retroviral vectors constructed containing foot-and-mouth
disease virus (fmdv) internal ribosome entry site (ires) followed coding
region beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) therapeutic genes, selectable
neomycin phosphotransferase gene control viral long terminal
repeat (ltr) promoter. lnfx, vector multiple cloning site 3' to
foot-and-mouth disease virus ires, used construct vectors encoding rat
erythropoietin (ep), rat granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (g-csf), human
adenosine deaminase (ada) beta-gal. transduced primary rat vascular smooth
muscle cells cytokines expressed high levels, similar those
obtained vectors employing viral ltr promoter. lnfz, vector encoding
beta-gal, 10-fold increase titer lnpoz, comparable vector
containing poliovirus (po) internal ribosome entry site. primary canine
vascular smooth muscle cells infected lnfz lnpoz expressed similar
activities beta-gal neomycin phosphotransferase (npt). overall, these
vectors titers 10(6) 2 x 10(7) c.f.u./ml, indicating that
foot-and-mouth disease virus ires provides high-titer bicistronic vectors with
high-level two gene expression.
