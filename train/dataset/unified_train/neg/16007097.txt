during several months 2003, newly identified illness termed severe acute
respiratory syndrome (sars) spread rapidly world. new coronavirus
(sars-cov) identified sars pathogen, triggered severe pneumonia 
and acute, often lethal, lung failure. moreover, among infected individuals
influenza spanish flu emergence new respiratory disease
viruses caused high lethality resulting acute lung failure. cell
lines, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) identified potential 
sars-cov receptor. high lethality sars-cov infections, enormous
economic social impact, fears renewed outbreaks well potential
misuse viruses biologic weapons make paramount understand the
pathogenesis sars-cov. provide first genetic proof ace2 
crucial sars-cov receptor vivo. sars-cov infections spike protein of
the sars-cov reduce ace2 expression. notably, injection sars-cov spike into
mice worsens acute lung failure vivo attenuated blocking the
renin-angiotensin pathway. results provide molecular explanation why
sars-cov infections cause severe often lethal lung failure suggest a
rational therapy sars possibly respiratory disease viruses.
