we isolated molecular clone full-length integrated provirus of
simian acquired immune deficiency syndrome retrovirus serotype 1 (srv-1) a
fatal case simian acquired immune deficiency syndrome juvenile rhesus
macaque. integrated srv-1 provirus cloned, sequenced, found contain
four large open reading frames encoding gag-precursor protein, protease,
polymerase, envelope. proviral clone transfected d17 canine
osteosarcoma cells found produce infectious virus. comparison the
sequences clone noninfectious clone showed 20 differences,
resulting 10 amino acid changes. also, cluster exchanges, short
insertions, deletions 5' leader sequences resulted extension the
trna(lys) primer-binding site 14 19 nucleotides. virus isolated from
transfected cells shown infectious pathogenic, resulting disease
that followed time course mortality disease induced uncloned, 
in vitro cultivated virus isolated diseased animals. results
unequivocally show type retrovirus (srv-1) causes fatal
immunosuppressive syndrome rhesus monkeys.
