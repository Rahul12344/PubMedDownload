plasma samples 1,182 patients undergoing primary liver transplantation 
tested anti-hepatitis c (hcv) virus two methods: ortho hcv elisa test
system (eia) chiron riba hcv test system (riba ii). eia results, 0 +, 
were recorded first, followed riba results, n = negative, p = positive, =
indeterminate. concordant results--0n, + p, + i--were found 1,076 (91%), and
discordant results found 106 (9%). eia optical density relate
to concordant discordant results. band patterns described stating 
band position (1, 2, 3, 4) inserting dash (-) band visualized.
most + p samples fell two patterns: 47% showed four bands, pattern 1234,
and 15% showed two-band pattern, 34. eia negative, 0p, the
opposite seen: 8% showed 1234 pattern 81% showed 34 pattern.
there 226 samples formed bands (+ p, 149; 0p, 31; + i, 15; 0i, 31). the
frequency bands follows: 4, 32%; 3, 31%; 2, 19%; 1, 18%. band 2 and
the eia test detected antibodies c100-3 fragment showed 74%
concordance. explanation apparent lower concordance rate 
that eia test bands 3 = 96% 4 = 88%. eia riba ii
tests, together positive liver function tests abnormal tissue pathologic
findings, provide basis diagnosis hcv.
