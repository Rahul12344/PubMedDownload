comparative pathology infection novel diarrhoea viruses.

hall ga.

examination diarrhoeic faeces electron microscope often reveals viruses
that presumed enteropathogenic. lesions caused novel rotaviruses
were similar group rotaviruses, enterocyte syncytia seen
which probably pathognomonic novel rotaviruses. adenovirus infection
in piglets, mature enterocytes infected destroyed; intranuclear
inclusion bodies seen infected enterocytes. calici-like viruses infected 
mature enterocytes calves lesions similar described in
humans infected calici-like viruses; host species impossible 
to demonstrate virus particles enterocytes examined electron
microscope. breda virus infected villi crypts lower small
intestine surface crypts large intestine; only
enteropathogenic virus show distribution infection lesions.
astrovirus infection lambs comparable mild rotavirus infection, but
in calves epithelium dome villi peyer's patches infected.
parvovirus cats dogs infected destroyed small intestinal crypt cells, 
causing dilated crypts stunted villi; intranuclear inclusion bodies were
prominent.
