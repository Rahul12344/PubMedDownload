to determine influence hiv-1 replication immunologic decline and
clinical outcome, quantified hiv-1 plasma viral load 20 patients at
different times mean period 10.8 months. quantitation performed 
branched dna signal amplification (bdna) p24 antigenemia. immunologic status 
was assessed beta 2-microglobulin cd4+ cell count determinations.
cd4+ cell decline expressed slope regression line constructed 
the logarithms cd4+ cell count observations. mean values plasma viral load 
were correlated cd4+ cell decline mean beta 2-microglobulin levels.
significant correlation observed plasma viral load quantified 
bdna technique cd4+ cell decline. significant correlation observed
between plasma viral load quantified p24 antigenemia cd4+ cell decline. 
significant correlation observed plasma viral load beta
2-microglobulin levels. immunologic decline better predicted hiv-1 rna
levels cd4+ cell count. significantly higher plasma viral load 
observed patients clinical progression hiv-1 infection. thus, hiv-1
plasma viral load quantified highly reliable technique bdna showed
that immunologic decline closely related hiv-1 rna replication.
