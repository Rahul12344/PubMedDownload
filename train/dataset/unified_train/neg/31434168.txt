canine parvoviral enteritis (pve) important intestinal disease the
puppies; however, potential impact canine parvovirus (cpv) gut 
microbiota investigated. therefore, aim study to
evaluate gut microbial shifts puppies naturally infected cpv. fecal
samples collected healthy dogs diagnosed pve 4, 6, 8,
and 12 weeks age. distal gut microbiota dogs characterized using
illumina miseq sequencing bacterial 16s rrna genes. sequence data were
analyzed using qiime operational taxonomic unit definition a
similarity cutoff 97%. results showed cpv associated with
significant microbial dysbiosis intestinal microbiota. alpha diversity and
species richness evenness dogs pve decreased compared of
healthy dogs. phylum level, proportion proteobacteria was
significantly enriched dogs pve bacteroidetes significantly
more abundant healthy dogs (p < 0.05). dogs pve, enterobacteriaceae
was abundant bacterial family accounting 36.44% total
bacterial population compared 0.21% healthy puppies. two most
abundant genera healthy dogs prevotella lactobacillus their
abundance significantly higher compared dogs pve (p < 0.05). 
these observations suggest disturbances gut microbial communities were
associated pve young dogs. evaluation roles bacterial
groups pathophysiology pve warrants studies.
