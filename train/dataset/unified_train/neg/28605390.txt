moloney murine leukemia (mlv) virus-based retroviral vectors integrate
predominantly acetylated enhancers promoters. reason, mlv
integration sites used functional markers active regulatory
elements. here, present retroviral scanning tool, allows the
genome-wide identification cell-specific enhancers promoters. briefly, the
target cell population transduced mlv-derived vector genomic dna
is digested frequently cutting restriction enzyme. ligation of
genomic fragments compatible dna linker, linker-mediated polymerase chain 
reaction (lm-pcr) allows amplification virus-host genome junctions.
massive sequencing amplicons used define mlv integration profile
genome-wide. finally, clusters recurrent integrations defined identify 
cell-specific regulatory regions, responsible activation cell-type
specific transcriptional programs. retroviral scanning tool allows the
genome-wide identification cell-specific promoters enhancers in
prospectively isolated target cell populations. notably, retroviral scanning
represents instrumental technique retrospective identification rare
populations (e.g. somatic stem cells) lack robust markers prospective
isolation.
