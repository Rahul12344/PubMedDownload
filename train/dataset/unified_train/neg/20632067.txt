inflammatory reactions ssrna viruses induced endosomal toll-like
receptors (tlrs) 7 8. tlr7/8-mediated inflammatory reaction results in
activation nalp3 inflammasome via unknown mechanism. report for
the first time tlr7/8 mediate activation xanthine oxidase (xod) an
hif-1α-dependent manner. xod produces uric acid reactive oxygen species,
which could activate nalp3 therefore induce activation caspase 1, known to
convert inactive pro-il-1β active il-1β. specific inhibition xod
activity attenuates tlr7/8-mediated activation caspase 1 il-1β release.
these results obtained using human thp-1 myeloid macrophages. findings
were verified conducting vivo experiments mice.
