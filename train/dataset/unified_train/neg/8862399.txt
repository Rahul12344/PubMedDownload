human mxa protein type interferon-inducible intracytoplasmic protein,
which mediates antiviral actions variety negative-strand rna viruses
including influenza a, measles, vesicular stomatitis viruses. recently, it
has also shown several members bunyaviridae family inhibited
by mxa protein. hantavirus genus bunyaviridae family includes
important human pathogenic viruses, e.g., puumala (puuv), hantaan, sin nombre
viruses. tula virus (tulv) new member genus, pathogenicity in
man remains determined. assumed similarities replication
strategy. mxa would good candidate molecule antiviral action against
these viruses, also. gain insight mxa action puuv, studied
puuv tulv replication stably mxa genetransfected vero cells. show 
mxa protein capacity inhibit viral protein rna accumulation
in virus-infected cells. also studied puuv tulv infection in
mxa-transfected u-937 cell clones. cell lines hantaviruses grew
poorly, independent whether cells expressing mxa whether cell 
line-specific differences antiviral activity mxa protein against
hantaviruses exist cannot conclusively determined due lack of
productive infection puuv tulv u-937 cells.
