background: objective study estimate incidence invasive
cervical cancer (icc) women human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and
compare incidence hiv-uninfected women.
methods: cohort study hiv-infected uninfected women had
papanicolaou tests obtained every 6 months, pathology reports retrieved 
women biopsy results self-report icc. histology reviewed when
reports confirmed icc. incidence rates calculated compared in
hiv-negative women.
results: median follow-up 10.3 years, 3 iccs confirmed in
hiv-seropositive women, none confirmed hiv-seronegative women. the
icc incidence rate found associated significantly hiv status
(hiv-negative women [0 100,000 person-years] vs hiv-positive women [21.4 of
100,000 person-years]; p = .59). calculated incidence rate ratio standardized
to expected results surveillance epidemiology end results database
that restricted hiv-infected women's interagency hiv study participants
was 1.32 (95% confidence interval, 0.27-3.85; p = 0.80).
conclusions: among women hiv prospective study incorporated
cervical cancer prevention measures, incidence icc significantly
higher comparison group hiv-negative women.
