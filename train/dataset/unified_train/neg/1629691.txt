the synthesis proteins encoded rna tomato black ring virus (tbrv) in
vivo studied protoplasts direct labelling [35s]methionine, 
protoplasts plants immunoblotting experiments specific antisera.
comparison proteins synthesized infected mock-inoculated
protoplasts suggested proteins m(r) 120k, 90k, 80k, 57k 46k were
virus-specific. proteins derived rna-1-encoded polyprotein detected 
by immunoblotting stable 120k protein and, protoplasts, small
amounts 90k protein contains c-terminal part 120k protein
and polymerase domain. results suggest polymerase the
adjacent protease function vivo largely solely combined 120k
protein. proteins derived rna-2-encoded polyprotein detected by
immunoblotting 59k 57k proteins, reacted antiserum tbrv
particles, 46k protein. extracts infected nicotiana clevelandii and
chenopodium quinoa made soon inoculation, 59k protein abundant
than 57k protein; later samples contained similar quantities protein.
the 57k protein comigrated protein extracted virus particles. the
results amino acid sequencing suggested 57k protein derived from
the 59k protein loss nine c-terminal amino acids. antiserum a
peptide adjacent 57k protein 150k polyprotein detected 46k
protein protoplasts plant tissue. results support processing
scheme tbrv polyproteins proposed analysis products vitro 
translation.
