the sequence orfs 2 4 u.s. isolate porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv), atcc vr2385, determined analysis 
cdna lambda library. cdna clones containing prrsv specific sequences were
selected using vr2385 orf 4 specific pcr probe sequenced. orfs 2, 3 and
4 overlapped encoded polypeptides predicted m(r) 29.5 kda 
(orf 2), 28.7 kda (orf 3) 19.5 kda (orf 4), respectively. overlap was
found orfs 4 5, instead 10 bp sequence which
separated two orfs. nucleic acid homology corresponding orfs of
the european prrsv isolate lelystad virus (lv) 65% orf 2, 64% orf 3
and 66% orf 4. comparison orf 4 sequences vr2385 of
another u.s. isolate mn-1b revealed 86% amino acid sequence homology the
presence deletions orf 4 mn-1b. results strengthen the
observation sequence variation us european prrsv
isolates.
