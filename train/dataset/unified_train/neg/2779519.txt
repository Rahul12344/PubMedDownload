this report demonstrates high efficiency transduction enteric bacteria using
single strand plasmids packaged m13 phage capsids. transformation plasmid
dna usually inefficient process many enteric bacteria than
escherichia coli k12. plasmids carrying m13 origin replication be
replicated packaged cells carrying plasmids infected m13
or derivative helper phage. introducing f' plasmid e. coli, serratia
marcescens, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, species can
now infected high efficiency m13 phage packaged single strand
plasmids, yielding efficient method introduce cloned dna fragments into
these bacteria. titer colony forming units lysate essentially
equivalent bacteria, demonstrating equal efficiency transduction
of enteric bacteria compared e. coli.
