newly-emerged vaccine-mismatched influenza viruses (iavs) result rapid
global spread virus due minimal antibody-mediated immunity. that
case, established cd8+ t-cells reduce disease severity. however, mutations
occur sporadically within immunogenic iav-derived t-cell peptides, understanding 
of t-cell receptor (tcrαβ) cross-reactivity towards iav variants needed 
vaccine design. here, investigate tcrαβ cross-strain recognition across iav
variants within two immunodominant human iav-specific cd8+ t-cell epitopes,
hla-b*37:01-restricted np338-346 (b37-np338) hla-a*01:01-restricted np44-52
(a1-np44). find high abundance cross-reactive tcrαβ clonotypes recognizing 
distinct iav variants. structures wild-type variant peptides revealed 
preserved conformation bound peptides. structures cross-reactive
tcr-hla-b37-np338 complex suggest conserved conformation variants
underpins tcr cross-reactivity. overall, cross-reactive cd8+ t-cell responses,
underpinned conserved epitope structure, facilitates recognition distinct
iav variants, thus cd8+ t-cell-targeted vaccines could provide protection across 
different iav strains.
