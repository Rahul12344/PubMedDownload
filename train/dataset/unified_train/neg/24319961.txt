objective: analyse infection high-risk human papiliomavirus (hr-hpv) in
cervical lesion wome, evaluate significance high-risk human
pappilomavirus detection hybrid capture ii (hv-ii) screening diagnosing
cervical lesion, especially high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin).
methods: series 1130 patients cervical lesion preliminarily
diagnosed cervical cytological examination, hr-hpv detection hc-ii ,
colposcopy biopsy colposcopy june 2009 december 2008,
including 212 cin (or) condyloma (cin i/hpv i), 442 cin ii/iii, 28 invasive
cervical cancer. cervical cytological examination thin prep liquid-based
cytology test(tct),and hr-hpv detection hc-ii.
results: 1130 cases positive hr-hpv 65.84% (744/1130). unusual
cytology result 862 cases, 356 ascus, 84 asch, 216 lsil, 184hsil 22
cancer. number biopsy > = cini/hpvi 682, positive rate hr-hpv
was 78.59% (536/682). screening cin ii above, sensitivity, specificity, ppv
and npv tct 88.94%, 32.73%, 48.49%, 80.60%, hr-hpv dna detectiort by
hc-ii 90.21%, 51.82%, 57.14%, 88.14%, hr-hpv detection combined 
cytology 97.45%, 22.42%, 47.22%, 92.50%.
conclusion: infection rate hr-hpv cervical lesions higher each
age group. infection rate hr-hpv ascending serious degree cervical 
lesion. hr-hpv detection hc- ii important method screening cervical
lesion. hr-hpv detection viable option management women ascus
and lsil tct, higher sensitivity npv.
