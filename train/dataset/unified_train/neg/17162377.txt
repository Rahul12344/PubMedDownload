human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection represents one major health
threats developing world. costly treatment infected individuals
with multiple highly efficient anti-hiv drugs affordable in
industrialized countries. thus, efficient vaccination strategy required 
prevent spread infection. molecular biology of
coronaviruses particular features human coronavirus 229e (hcov 229e)
indicate hcov 229e-based vaccine vectors become new class highly
efficient vaccines. first, receptor hcov 229e, human aminopeptidase n
(hapn cd13) expressed mainly human dendritic cells (dcs) macrophages
indicating targeting hcov 229e-based vectors professional antigen
presenting cells achieved receptor-mediated transduction. second, hcov 
229e structural genes replaced multiple transcriptional units encoding 
various antigens. virus-like particles (vlps) containing hcov 229e-based
vector rna ability transduce human dcs mediate heterologous
gene expression cells. finally, coronavirus infections associated
with mainly respiratory enteric diseases, natural transmission of
coronaviruses occurs via mucosal surfaces. humans, hcov 229e causes common
cold infecting upper respiratory tract. hcov 229e infections mainly
encountered children re-infection occurs frequently adults. thus 
most likely pre-existing immunity hcov 229e significantly
impact vaccination efficiency hcov 229e-based vectors used in
humans.
