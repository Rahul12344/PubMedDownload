patients x-linked lymphoproliferative disorder (xlpd) unable to
control epstein-barr virus (ebv)-induced infections lymphoproliferation. this
disease caused deficit sap, adapter protein involved signal 
transduction several cell surface receptors cd2 superfamily. one of
these receptors, called 2b4, expressed nk cells, cytotoxic cells and
myeloid cells activates nk cell cytotoxicity. show xlpd patients
have defect 2b4 receptor-mediated nk cell cytotoxicity. defect may
contribute pathogenesis xlpd reducing nk cell lysis ebv-infected 
b cells.
