hyperacetylation tau implicated neurodegeneration cognitive
decline tauopathy brains. nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide-dependent
class-iii protein deacetylase sirt1 one major enzymes involved in
removal acetyl groups tau vitro however, whether sirt1 regulates
acetylation pathogenic tau ameliorates tau-mediated pathogenesis remains
unclear. here, report deacetylating activity sirt1 acetylated lys174
(k174) tau taup301s transgenic mice brain-specific sirt1 deletion.
we show sirt1 deficiency leads exacerbation premature mortality,
synapse loss, behavioral disinhibition taup301s transgenic mice both
sexes. contrast, sirt1 overexpression stereotaxic delivery of
adeno-associated virus encodes sirt1 hippocampus reduces acetylated
k174 tau. furthermore, sirt1 overexpression significantly attenuates spread
of tau pathology anatomically connected brain regions taup301s transgenic
mice sexes. findings suggest functional importance sirt1 
regulating pathogenic tau acetylation suppressing spread tau
pathology vivosignificance statement neurodegenerative disorders with
inclusions microtubule-associated protein tau, aberrant lysine acetylation 
tau plays critical roles promoting tau accumulation toxicity. identifying 
strategies deacetylate tau could interfere disease progression; however, 
little known pathogenic tau deacetylated vivo show
that protein deacetylase sirt1 reduces tau acetylation mouse model of
neurodegeneration. sirt1 deficiency brain aggravates synapse loss and
behavioral disinhibition, sirt1 overexpression ameliorates propagation tau
pathology.
