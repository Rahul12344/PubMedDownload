background: main causes liver fibrosis transfusion-dependent
thalassemia major hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection hepatic iron
overload. study aimed assess liver fibrosis egyptian adolescents and
young adult poly-transfused beta thalassemia patients infected hcv using
liver fibroscan relation iron overload liver iron concentration (lic).
material methods: fifty-one regularly transfused beta thalassemia patients
above 12 years old subjected measurement serum alanine transaminase
(alt), serum ferritin (sf), hcv (antibody rna), lic assessed hepatic r2*
and transient elastography (te) (fibroscan). fibrotest liver biopsy done
to 25 patients.
results: eighty two% studied thalassemia patients hcv antibody positive; 
21(49%) viremic (hcv rna positive); median lic 12 mg/gm dry
weight. strong positive correlation degree liver
stiffness ishak fibrosis score assessed liver biopsy specimens (p = 0.002)
and fibroscan fibrotest results (p < 0.001). patients hcv
viremia showed significantly higher alt, Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase (ggt), sf, lic
and increased liver stiffness compared patients viremia (p = 0.0001,
0.001, 0.012, 0.006 0.001) respectively. liver cirrhosis (te values >
12.5kpa) encountered 23.5% variable degrees liver fibrosis (te
values > 6-12.5 kpa) 35% studied thalassemic patients.
conclusion: young beta thalassemia patients active hepatitis c infection may
have hepatic cirrhosis fibrosis young age accompanied hepatic
siderosis. non invasive liver fibroscan fibro-test reliable methods to
assess liver fibrosis young thalassemic-patients.
