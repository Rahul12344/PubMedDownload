setting: zimbabwe.
objective: investigate determinants multidrug-resistant tuberculosis
(mdr-tb) among previously treated tb patients.
design: 1:3 case-control study bivariate analysis logistic regression.
results: risk factors mdr-tb history nursing mdr-tb patient
(adjusted [aor] 4.46, 95%ci 2.02-9.88), history hospitalisation î‹¶3 days
(aor 2.91, 95%ci 1.62-5.23) history foreign travel stay outside
zimbabwe (aor 2.68, 95%ci 1.46-4.91). protective factors previous successful
treatment (aor 0.05, 95%ci 0.02-0.11), history supervision health
worker/village health worker (aor 0.34, 95%ci 0.19-0.60) treated 
not previously tb (aor 0.18, 95%ci 0.08-0.38). association 
between human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection mdr-tb (aor 1.00, 95%ci 
0.53-1.88) observed. however, among hiv-infected patients, cd4
<200 cells/mm3 likely develop mdr-tb (aor 4.62, 95%ci 2.49-8.53).
conclusion: individual, service-related, social demographic factors interact 
to determine multidrug resistance among previously treated tb patients. infection
control, treatment adherence, reduction side effects drug susceptibility
testing must strengthened reduce mdr-tb burden zimbabwe.
