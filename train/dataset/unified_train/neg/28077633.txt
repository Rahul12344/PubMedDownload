bats harbor large diversity coronaviruses (covs), several are
related zoonotic pathogens cause severe disease humans. screening 
of bat samples collected kenya 2007 2010 detected rna from
several novel covs but, significantly, identified sequences were
closely related human covs nl63 229e, suggesting two human
viruses originate bats. also demonstrated human cov nl63 a
recombinant nl63-like viruses circulating triaenops bats 229e-like
viruses circulating hipposideros bats, breakpoint located near 5' and
3' ends spike (s) protein gene. addition, two interspecies
recombination events involving gene identified, suggesting this
region may represent recombination "hot spot" cov genomes. finally, using 
combination phylogenetic distance-based approaches, showed the
genetic diversity bat covs primarily structured host species and
subsequently geographic distances.importance understanding driving forces 
of cross-species virus transmission central understanding nature of
disease emergence. previous studies demonstrated bats ultimate 
reservoir hosts number coronaviruses (covs), including ancestors of
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov), middle east respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), human cov 229e (hcov-229e). however, the
evolutionary pathways bat covs remain elusive. provide evidence natural
recombination distantly related african bat coronaviruses associated with
triaenops afer hipposideros sp. bats resulted nl63-like virus, an
ancestor human pathogen hcov-nl63. results suggest interspecies
recombination may play important role cov evolution emergence of
novel covs zoonotic potential.
