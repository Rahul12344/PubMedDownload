fanconi-zinsser's disease serious involutive myelopathy responsible for
pancytopenia, hyperpigmentation, oralplakia onychodystrophy, together with
lesser dysmorphisms many cases. marrow blood picture reminiscent the
better-known fanconi's disease, skin mucosa picture similar to
that congenital dyskeratosis - hence combined name. typical case, but
complicated lewandowsky's disease first time literature, is
presented. papova-virus noted typical verrucae. modern "pathology 
due genome instability" examined. lewandowsky's disease regarded a
familial form precancerous, owing possible bowenoid transformation.
the association seen particularly significant stressing disorder 
the immunocompetent syste, evident finding serum
anti-red-cell auto-antibodies deficiency lymphocytes.
fanconi-zinsser's disease reported 21 times literature,
mostly males. incomplete forms are, however, noted relatives, suggesting
that originates genetic disorder whose transmission modality not
clear, though incomplete dominance suspected. genome instability probably
responsible behind onset disease neoplastic complications -
these also feature forms provoked instability, as
bloom's syndrome ataxia telengiectasia. fanconi's disease also marked
neoplastic tendencies. clinically, fanconi-zinsser's disease classified as
distinct, since signs evolutive modality distinguish from
franconi's disease, estren-damesheck's syndrome amegakaryocytic
thrombocytopenia. genetically, seen diseases are
referable "pathology due genome instability".
