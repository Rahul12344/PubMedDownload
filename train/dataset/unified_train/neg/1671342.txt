to understand cellular basis recovery hsv infection, critical 
to identify functional interactions hsv-specific lymphocyte
subpopulations involved generation optimal response. end,
the requirement cd4+ (l3t4+) lymphocytes development primary 
and secondary cd8+ (lyt-2+) cytolytic lymphocyte (ctl) response following hsv
infection c57bl/6 mice investigated. found chronic depletion
of cd4+ cells vivo treatment mab gk1.5, resulted greater 
than 95% depletion peripheral cd4+ lymphocytes treated animals, caused 
profound decrease levels cytolytic activity obtained primary
response draining popliteal lymph nodes mice responding infection in
the hind footpads. however, treatment affect levels vivo
secondary ctl activity popliteal lymph nodes, vitro secondary
response spleen. decreased ctl activity observed primary
response due inability prime hsv-specific ctl precursors (ctlp),
as full cytolytic activity obtained following culture lymphocytes the
presence exogenous il-2 antigen, response could reconstituted
by treatment recombinant il-2 vivo. analysis secondary ctl
response spleen indicated cd4+ cells required either the
generation maintenance aspect response. however, blockade of
il-2 utilization ctl using anti-il-2r antibodies indicated this
lymphokine absolutely essential secondary ctl expansion vitro.
finally, mice infected 12 months previously exhibited decreased
ability generate secondary hsv-specific ctl vitro following cd4-depletion
in vivo. taken together, results suggest two distinct stages ctl
development response: early primary stage dependent upon the
presence cd4+ cells, later, cd4-independent stage operative the
secondary response, decays time postinfection.
