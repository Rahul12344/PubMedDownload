different functional domains adenovirus e1a gene involved in
regulation host cell cycle products.

zerler b, roberts rj, mathews mb, moran e.

we analyzed cell cycle effects different domains adenovirus 
e1a proteins quiescent primary brk cells. studies deletion mutants
that combination removed n-terminal 85 amino acids common 
the 12s 13s proteins suggest region may sufficient the
induction synthesis proliferating cell nuclear antigen stimulation 
of dna synthesis. second domain also common n-terminal exon 12s
and 13s proteins required induction mitosis stimulation of
proliferation primary brk cells. virus containing mutation region 
was still able stimulate dna synthesis efficiently. third domain, unique 
the 13s protein, required accelerated activation cellular
thymidylate synthase gene manner similar 13s-dependent stimulation of
adenovirus early region genes.
