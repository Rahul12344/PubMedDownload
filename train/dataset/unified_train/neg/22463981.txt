the characterization viral genomes accelerated due improvement dna
sequencing technology. sources animal samples molecular methods the
identification novel viral pathogens steps determine their
pathogenicity listed. difficulties predicting future cross-species
transmissions highlighted wide diversity known viral zoonoses.
recent surveys viruses wild domesticated animals characterized
numerous viruses including closely related infecting humans. the
detection multiple genetic lineages within viral families infecting single
host species, phylogenetically interspersed viruses found host
species, reflects past cross-species transmissions. numerous opportunities for
the generation novel vaccines arise better understanding animal
viromes.
