hepatitis c virus (hcv) spreads via secreted cell-free particles direct
cell-to-cell transmission. yet, virus-host determinants governing differential
intracellular trafficking cell-free- cell-to-cell-transmitted virus remain
unknown. host adaptor proteins (aps) ap-1a, ap-1b, ap-4 traffic in
post-golgi compartments, latter two implicated basolateral
sorting. reported ap-1a mediates hcv trafficking release, whereas 
the endocytic adaptor ap-2 mediates entry assembly. demonstrated 
host kinases aak1 gak regulate hcv infection controlling these
clathrin-associated aps. here, sought define roles ap-4, a
clathrin-independent adaptor; ap-1a; ap-1b hcv infection. screened 
interactions hcv proteins μ subunits ap-1a, ap-1b, ap-4 by
mammalian cell-based protein fragment complementation assays. nonstructural 2
(ns2) protein emerged interactor adaptors screening by
coimmunoprecipitations hcv-infected cells. two previously unrecognized
dileucine-based motifs ns2 c terminus mediated ap binding hcv release.
infectivity coculture assays demonstrated three adaptors
mediate hcv release cell-free spread, ap-1b ap-4, ap-1a, mediate 
cell-to-cell spread. live-cell imaging revealed hcv cotrafficking ap-1a,
ap-1b, ap-4 ap-4 mediates hcv trafficking post-golgi
compartment. lastly, hcv cell-to-cell spread regulated aak1 gak and
thus susceptible treatment aak1 gak inhibitors. data provide 
mechanistic understanding hcv trafficking distinct release pathways and
reveal requirement aps cell-to-cell viral spread.importance hcv spreads 
via cell-free infection cell-to-cell contact shields antibody
neutralization, thereby facilitating viral persistence. yet, factors governing
this differential sorting remain unknown. integrating proteomic, rna
interference, genetic, live-cell imaging, pharmacological approaches, we
uncover differential coopting host adaptor proteins (aps) mediate hcv
traffic distinct late steps viral life cycle. reported ap-1a
and ap-2 mediate hcv trafficking release assembly, respectively. here,
we demonstrate dileucine motifs ns2 protein mediate ap-1a, ap-1b, and
ap-4 binding cell-free virus release. moreover, reveal ap-4, an
adaptor previously implicated viral infections, mediates cell-to-cell
spread hcv trafficking. lastly, demonstrate cell-to-cell spread regulation
by aak1 gak, host kinases controlling aps, susceptibility their
inhibitors. study provides mechanistic insights virus-host determinants
that facilitate hcv trafficking, potential implications pathogenesis and
antiviral agent design.
