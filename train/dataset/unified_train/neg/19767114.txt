the aim study develop evaluate early warning system (ews)
for commercial egg laying flocks detect subtle mortality egg
production changes characterize low pathogenic avian influenza virus (lpaiv)
infections. ews create alert recommended 'trigger point' is
reached exceeded. previously used ewss based fixed alert levels, 
the proposed ews customizes alert level flock. fixed approach
may valid highly pathogenic diseases, results lower detection
probability low pathogenic diseases. ews based daily data
collected flocks affected 2000-2004 h6n2 lpai epidemic california.
three ewss evaluated: (1) ews1, triggered observed
mortality increase production decrease exceeds "x" times the
expected daily value (2.75-3.50 times expected mortality), (2) ews2, is
triggered observed mortality increase production decrease exceeds
more "y" times 2 consecutive days expected daily values
(1.75-2.15 times expected mortality), (3) combination two. the
ewss evaluated according three parameters: detection delay (days) a
lpai outbreak, false alerts (%) outbreaks missed (%). results showed 
egg production-based ews added benefit mortality-based system, mainly
because h6n2 lpai-related egg production decrease always occurred increase 
in mortality. combining two ewss resulted reduced detection delay no
missed outbreaks, expense slight increase number false 
alerts triggered. system presented study also outperformed fixed ewss
in three evaluated parameters. proposed ews, used part poultry
cooperative program combined rapid laboratory diagnosis, could a
useful tool detection control lpai outbreaks poultry
diseases. built spreadsheet, system could inexpensively, easily and
quickly incorporated commercial egg production farm decision support
system. addition, proposed system could quickly adjusted changing
epidemic situations, easily customized individual flocks.
