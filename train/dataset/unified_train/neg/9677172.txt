objectives: establish population-based hiv survey data selected
populations, assess validity extrapolation hiv sentinel
surveillance amongst antenatal clinic attenders (anc) general population.
methods: population survey, adults aged > = 15 years selected by
stratified random cluster sampling (n = 4195). survey carried in
catchment populations clinics used national hiv surveillance. the
methodology allows detailed comparisons hiv infection patterns made in
two areas (urban rural). whereas sentinel surveillance used serum-based
hiv testing, population survey used saliva (93.5% consented provide a
saliva sample).
results: surveillance anc tended underestimate overall hiv prevalence
of general population, differences statistically significant. in
the urban area, adjusted overall hiv prevalence rate anc (aged 15-39
years) 24.4% [95% confidence interval (ci), 20.9-28.0] compared 26.0%
(95% ci, 23.4-28.6) general population. respective rural estimates
were 12.5% (95% ci, 9.3-15.6) versus 16.4% (95% ci, 12.1-20.6). age-specific
prevalence rates showed anc overestimate infection teenagers (aged 15-19
years), whereas reverse direction aged > = 30 years. teenagers
analysed single year age revealed anc women general
population steep increase prevalence age, the
former consistently higher rates. extrapolations might biased substantially
due higher pregnancy rates amongst uninfected individuals.
conclusions: anc-based data might draw rather distorted picture current
dynamics hiv epidemic. even though representing obvious
oversimplification, extrapolations overall prevalence rates may correlate with
that general population.

largely sentinel surveillance antenatal clinic (anc) attenders. the
validity use key sentinel group terms hiv prevalence estimation 
was evaluated population-based survey 4195 zambian adults recruited
through stratified random cluster sampling urban lusaka rural mposhi
district 1995-96. survey carried catchment populations of
clinics used national hiv surveillance. overall, anc surveillance tended to
underestimate hiv prevalence general population, differences 
statistically significant either urban rural area. lusaka, the
adjusted overall hiv prevalence among anc attenders 24.4% compared 26.0%
in population-based survey. rural estimates 12.5% 16.4%,
respectively. comparison age-specific prevalences indicated anc overestimated 
infection teenagers underestimated hiv aged 30 years over.
prevalence rates increased steeply age, comparable increment levels among
women samples, men stable prevalence rates age. these
findings suggest extrapolations surveillance data may indeed produce 
distorted picture current dynamics hiv epidemic population
at large. women higher educational attainment underrepresented the
anc surveys. higher pregnancy birth rates among hiv-negative compared 
hiv-positive women another potential source bias, high rate of
anc clients aged 18-19 years (66%, compared 34% general population of
women). information single year age, educational level, residence
should collected sentinel surveillance systems allow appropriate
stratification. since hiv prevalence young people may reliable
marker changes incidence, sample size increases 15-19 year age group
should considered.
