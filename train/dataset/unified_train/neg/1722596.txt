monoclonal antibodies generated cottontail rabbit papillomavirus
(crpv) tested neutralization crpv-induced papillomas domestic nzw
rabbits. intact crpv semi-purified cscl gradients used immunize
balb/c mice. hybridomas prepared fusion lymph node cells, and
supernatants growing hybridomas analyzed enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (elisa) reactivity intact disrupted crpv virion antigen.
supernatants 22 cultures initially selected responsive to
crpv. ten reactive intact crpv alone, 4 reactive disrupted
crpv, 8 reactive intact disrupted crpv virion antigen. none 
of supernatants contained antibodies recognized epitopes crpv
capsid proteins (l1 l2) separated western blots. five hybridomas
which produced antibodies bound intact crpv, react intact 
hpv-11 bpv-1 selected tested antibody-mediated neutralization 
crpv infectivity. five monoclonal antibodies neutralizing, and
identified epitopes intact crpv virions non-linear and
conformational nature. five neutralizing monoclonal antibodies appeared to
recognize similar epitope epitope cluster intact crpv virion as
determined competition elisa.
