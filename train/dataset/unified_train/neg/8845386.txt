in present report, show prolonged expression beta-galactosidase
(beta-gal) acinar cells submandibular sublingual glands rats
following retrograde ductal injection retroviral vector bag. facilitate
integration viral dna, cell division gland induced the
administration beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol prior delivery
of vector. frequency cells stained beta-gal higher the
virus injected 4-20 hr two injections isoproterenol given 24 hr 
apart injection one dose drug. without stimulation 
of cell division, integration viral dna observed. expression the
marker enzyme observed 43 days, limit observation period.
the data indicate salivary glands potential targets of
retrovirus-mediated gene transfer somatic gene therapy.
