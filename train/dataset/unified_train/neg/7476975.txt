we produced characterized lines transgenic mice expressing fusion
gene composed pituitary expression-specific promoter region pomc
gene, driving herpes simplex viral-1 thymidine kinase. adult mice were
treated antiherpes agent ganciclovir 70 mg/kg body weight (ip, twice 
daily 10-12 days). approximately 98% pituitary intermediate lobe
melanotropes anterior lobe corticotropes ablated determined by
immunocytochemistry ria specific pomc-derived peptides, acth,
beta-endorophin, alpha-msh. number lactotropes, somatotropes,
thyrotropes, gonadotropes altered compared controls, indicating 
that adult pituitary, pomc products required maintain the
distribution cell types. expected, plasma corticosterone levels were
substantially decreased pomc cell ablation. situ hybridization studies
showed mouse acth receptor expressed uniformly throughout the
adrenal cortex, rnase protection assays revealed acth receptor mrna 
decreased pituitary pomc cell ablation. additionally, rnase protection
assays showed pituitary pomc cell ablation resulted decrease of
adrenal p450c11 beta transcripts p450c11as (aldosterone synthase) mrna
levels remained constant. data demonstrate differential regulation of
steroid pathway-specific enzymes pomc products. results also suggest 
the thymidine kinase cell obliteration technique may dependent cell
division prerequisite cytotoxicity, thus supporting idea that
targeted molecular ablation using cell- tissue-specific promoter sequences to
drive viral thymidine kinase expression refined study other
nonmitotic cells.
