objectives: describe incidence cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection/disease 
in kidney transplant recipients receiving mtor-inhibitor-containing
immunosuppressive regimen without prophylactic cmv treatment.
methods: single-center retrospective cohort analysis included de novo
kidney transplant recipients (09/15/2015-07/31/2017) receiving 3 mg/kg single
dose rabbit antithymocyte globulin induction, tacrolimus, everolimus, and
prednisone. preemptive therapy initiated patients deemed higher
risk cmv infection: (a) d+/r- cmv patients; (b) treatment acute
rejection (art); (c) everolimus discontinuation (evrd).
results: 230 patients, episodes cmv disease among 217 (94%)
without criteria initiate preemptive therapy. 77 (33.5%) patients
initiating preemptive therapy, 13 d+/r-, 30 art, 34 evrd. 
overall incidence first cmv infection/disease 6% (46.1% d+/r-, 13.3%
art [all patients also discontinued everolimus], 11.8% early
[<90 days] evrd). incidence biopsy-proven acute rejection 5.6%, and
median glomerular filtration rate month 12 47 ml/min/1.73m2 . one-year
patient death-censored graft survivals 97.4% 98.1%.
conclusion: study suggests everolimus-containing immunosuppressive
regimen reduces need preventive strategies cmv infection the
majority kidney transplant recipients, reducing antiviral drug-associated
toxicities healthcare-related expenditures.
