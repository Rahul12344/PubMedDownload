drug treatment hiv type 1 (hiv-1) infection leads rapid initial decay 
plasma virus followed slower second phase decay. investigate role 
of hiv-1 retained follicular dendritic cells (fdcs) process, have
developed analyzed mathematical model hiv-1 dynamics lymphoid tissue
(lt) includes fdcs. analysis clinical data using model indicates
that decay hiv-1 therapy may influenced release fdc-associated
virus. biphasic character viral decay explained reversible
multivalent binding hiv-1 receptors fdcs, indicating second
phase decay necessarily caused long-lived latently infected
cells. furthermore, viral clearance death short-lived productively
infected cells may faster previously estimated. model, with
reasonable parameter values, consistent kinetic measurements viral rna
in plasma, viral rna fdcs, productively infected cells lt, cd4(+) t
cells lt therapy.
