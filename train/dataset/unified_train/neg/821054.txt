enveloped virus acquires membrane defect passaged fibroblasts i-cell
disease patients.

sly ws, lagwinska e, schlesinger s.

sindbis virus obtained passage human fibroblasts patients with
i-cell disease (mucolipidosis ii) called i-cell virus differed sindbis
virus obtained chick fibroblasts normal human fibroblasts two
ways: (1) i-cell virus extremely unstable freezing thawing, (2)
the i-cell virus showed greatly exaggerated sensitivity inactivation triton
x-100. sindbis virus fibroblasts two patients mucolipidosis iii, a
milder form i-cell disease, showed similar, though milder, freeze-sensitivity.
when freeze-sensitive i-cell virus passaged mouse l-cells normal
human fibroblasts, virus longer abnormal. viral glycoproteins of
i-cell virus distinguishable viral glycoproteins controls by
sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. gel filtration glycopeptides
suggested small differences two four glycopeptides. findings
indicate sindbis virus phenotypically altered grown i-cell
fibroblasts. alterations must attributed viral envelope components
derived host plasma membrane (membrane lipids) alterations in
viral envelope glycoproteins. either case, alterations appear related to
the genetic defect i-cell fibroblasts. results clear that
enveloped viruses useful demonstrate analyze membrane defects in
certain human diseases. phenotypically altered viruses may, turn, provide 
probes studying functional relationships virus membrane components.
