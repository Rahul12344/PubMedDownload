the incomplete sequences two large, 10-12 kbp, double-stranded rnas (dsrnas)
found tw-2 isolate saprophytic fungus, phlebiopsis gigantea (pg)
are reported. pgv-tw2 dsrna1 dsrna2 potentially encode fusion proteins
which apparently expressed translational frameshifting mechanism. the
c-terminal region predicted proteins 21% identical contained 
eight motifs conserved rna-dependent rna polymerases dsrna mycoviruses 
had highest similarity members family totiviridae, possibly do
not form virions. remainder n-terminal protein sequences predicted
from pgv-tw2 dsrna1 dsrna2 sequences 3'-terminal nucleotide
sequences dsrnas homology one another sequence 
database suggesting individually may members novel families of
mycoviruses.
