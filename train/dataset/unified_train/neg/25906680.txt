glycoprotein (gd2) important candidate antigen herpes simplex
virus type 2 (hsv-2) vaccine development. establishment stable eukaryotic
cell line overexpress gd2 efficient purification process purify is
essential development subunit vaccine hsv-2. dna sequence 
of extracellular epitope-rich fragment gd2 optimized, chemically
synthesized, cloned plasmid pmd902. recombinant plasmid pmd902-gd
was stably transfected cho-dg44 cells, cell lines high levels of
expression gd2 established. recombinant gd2 purified efficiently 
using anion exchange column sephadex g-25 desalting column. yield of
the purified gd2 57 mg/l serum-free culture medium, purity was
determined 95% hplc analysis. finally, immunogenicity the
purified gd2 measured induced strong specific humoral immunity and
higher level cellular immune response gd2 expressed prokaryotic cells.
we established stable, secretory, high-yield gd2-expression cell line and
an easy efficient gd2-purification process, lays foundation for
preparation large amount gd2 essential hsv-2 subunit vaccine
development.
