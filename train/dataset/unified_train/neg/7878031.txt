to understand relationship antibodies present patients with
anti-nuclear dot (nd) autoimmune disease proteins recognize,
epitopes react autoantibodies mapped. panel fusion
proteins containing different portions nd protein overproduced in
escherichia coli. immunoblot analysis anti-nd antibodies revealed 
(10 12) sera recognize two major autoepitopes maximum 8
amino acids long. two sera recognize one two epitopes. in
addition short linear autoepitopes, conformational epitope appears be
present nd antigen. two linear epitope sequences shares
sequence similarities several viral proteins found the
databases. furthermore, two fusion proteins containing short epstein-barr virus
(ebv) protein sequences similar nd epitopes recognized by
the human autoimmune sera, indicating autoepitopes present ebv
protein sequences. results consistent hypothesis nd
autoimmune disease might associated ebv infections.
