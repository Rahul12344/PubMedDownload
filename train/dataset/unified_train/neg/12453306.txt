background: 1982 smith huggins showed bacteriophages could at
least effective antibiotics preventing mortality experimental
infections capsulated e. coli (k1) mice. phages required k1
capsule infection effective phages require this
capsule, efficacies phages antibiotics preventing mortality
both declined time infection treatment, becoming virtually
ineffective within 16 hours.
results: develop quantitative microbiological procedures (1) explore 
in vivo processes responsible efficacy phage antibiotic treatment 
protocols experimental infections (the resistance competition assay, rca), 
and (2) survey therapeutic potential phages vitro (the phage
replication assay pra). illustrate application utility these
methods repetition smith huggins' experiments, using e. coli k1
mouse thigh infection model, applying treatments phages streptomycin.
conclusions: 1) smith huggins phage antibiotic therapy results are
quantitatively qualitatively robust. (2) rca values reflect the
microbiological efficacies different phages streptomycin in
preventing mortality, reflect decline efficacy delay in
treatment. results show specifically bacteria become refractory to
treatment term infection. (3) k1-specific non-specific phages
had similar replication rates bacteria grown broth (based pra), 
the k1-specific phage markedly greater replication rates mouse serum.
