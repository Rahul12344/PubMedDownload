infection.

mice injected 10 5,000 reference units interferon
intraperitoneally subcutaneously within 24 h birth reinoculated
intraperitoneally 24 h later 200 plaque-forming units murine
cytomegalovirus. mock interferon virus diluent control inocula.
infection mock interferon-treated mice resulted significant retardation 
growth, accompanied tissue injury depressed blastogenic response of
splenic lymphocytes. prophylactic administration interferon prevented growth
retardation resulted lower tissue viral titers diminished injurious
effects virus. intraperitoneal inoculation interferon more
protective subcutaneous, 10 u interferon often effective
as 5,000 u. accelerated maturation enhanced activity lymphoid elements
were observed histologically spleens lymph nodes interferon-treated
mice; supportive findings greater incorporation [3h]thymidine
of splenocytes interferon-treated mice. protective effect interferon 
may, therefore, due stimulation accelerated maturation cellular
immune functions.
