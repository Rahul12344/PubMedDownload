several gamma-herpesviruses encode homologs host regulators complement
activation (rca) proteins, suggesting evolved immune evasion
strategies targeting complement. evaluated role complement factor c3
(c3) murine gamma-herpesvirus 68 (gammahv68) rca protein viral
pathogenesis. deletion gammahv68 rca protein decreased virulence during
acute cns infection, attenuation specifically reversed deletion
of host c3. gammahv68 rca protein also important persistent viral
replication virulence ifngammar(-/-) mice. addition, c3 played role
in regulating latency, counteracted gammahv68 rca
protein. conclude complement key host defense against
gamma-herpesvirus infection gamma-herpesviruses evolved immune
evasion strategy effective complement-mediated antiviral
responses acute latent infection.
