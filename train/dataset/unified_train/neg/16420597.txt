genotypic drug resistance interpretation algorithms developed on
patients infected hiv-1 subtype b interpret complex patterns of
mutations. non-b strains characterised natural presence several 
resistance-related mutations, examined extent might result in
interalgorithm discordances naive treated patients. compared the
prediction three algorithms (anrs, stanford rega) drug susceptibilities
to diverse hiv-1 strains 272 naive 156 treated patients. naive
patients, higher levels interalgorithm discordance observed for
predictions protease inhibitor (0.60-39%) predictions reverse
transcriptase inhibitor susceptibility (0-4%). main reason discordant
protease inhibitor interpretation presence resistance mutations that
were natural protease polymorphisms. contrast, treated patients, more
interalgorithm discordances observed predictions reverse
transcriptase inhibitor (5-48%) protease inhibitor susceptibilities
(10-31%). discordances related disagreement intermediate 
susceptible scores, intermediate resistant scores interpretations
of complex mutation patterns, related cross-resistance antagonistic
interactions.
