interferon-induced protein tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (ifit1) host
protein reported cell-intrinsic antiviral activity several rna
viruses. proposed basis activity negative-sense rna viruses
is binding exposed 5'-triphosphates (5'-ppp) genome viral rna.
however, recent studies reported relatively low binding affinities ifit1 for
5'-ppp rna, suggesting ifit1 may interact efficiently moiety
under physiological conditions. evaluate ability ifit1 an
impact negative-sense rna viruses, infected ifit1(-/-) wild-type
control mice primary cells four negative-sense rna viruses (influenza 
virus [iav], la crosse virus [lacv], oropouche virus [orov], ebola virus)
corresponding three distinct families. unexpectedly, lack ifit1 gene
expression result increased infection viruses cell 
culture. analogously, morbidity, mortality, viral burdens tissues were
identical ifit1(-/-) control mice infection iav, lacv, 
orov. finally, deletion human ifit1 protein a549 cells affect
iav replication infection, reciprocally, ectopic expression ifit1 in
hek293t cells inhibit iav infection. explain lack antiviral
activity iav, measured binding affinity ifit1 rna
oligonucleotides resembling 5' ends iav gene segments. affinity for
5'-ppp rna approximately 10-fold lower non-2'-o-methylated (cap
0) rna oligonucleotides. based analysis, conclude ifit1 
dominant restriction factor negative-sense rna viruses.importance:
negative-sense rna viruses, including influenza virus ebola virus, 
responsible deadly outbreaks recent history. host
interferon response induction antiviral genes contribute control of
infections viruses. ifit1 highly induced virus infection and
reportedly antiviral activity several rna dna viruses. however,
its role restricting infection negative-sense rna viruses remains unclear. 
in study, evaluated ability ifit1 inhibit negative-sense rna
virus replication pathogenesis vitro vivo. detailed cell
culture animal studies demonstrated ifit1 dominant restriction 
factor three different families negative-sense rna viruses.
