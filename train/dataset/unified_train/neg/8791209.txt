during 20-d period weaning. inoculated intranasally with
live attenuated bovine herpesvirus-1 (bhv-1). six calves received saline
injections six received injections b vitamin mixture ascorbate every

increased vitamin b12 affect folic acid ascorbate concentrations.
vitamin injections increased plasma concentrations vitamin b6, folic acid,
vitamin b12, pantothenic acid, ascorbate (p < .002). plasma concentrations of
vitamin b6, vitamin b12, pantothenic acid, ascorbate, folic acid,
were markedly reduced calves bhv-1 infection (p = .001). the
vitamin b6, pantothenic acid, vitamin b12, ascorbate status stressed
calves may affect immune response vaccination infection.
