to estimate relationship genomic change e2/ns1 region and
clinical feature, made pairwise comparison nucleotide deduced
amino acid sequences multiple recombinant clones e2/ns1 region, 
derived blood samples taken four patients (three treated ifn) at
different stages. sequence heterogeneities among clones generally high
but appeared significantly lowered cessation therapy. our
results showed, ifn therapy, clones selected survived,
although many clones disappeared. discontinuation drug, three
patients became carrier state, normal alt levels viremia. evolution of
defective viruses seen cases. features hcv genome
suggest virus could circulate extremely heterogeneous population
including defective virus, heterogeneity lend selection
pressures including interferon therapy host immune response.
