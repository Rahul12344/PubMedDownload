proteins often classified binary fashion either structured or
disordered. however approach several deficits. firstly, protein folding 
is always conditional physiochemical environment. protein is
structured circumstances disordered others. secondly, hides
a fundamental asymmetry behavior. structured proteins be
unfolded change environment, disordered proteins the
capacity folding. failure accommodate complexities confuses the
definition protein structural domains intrinsically disordered
regions. illustrate points experimental study family of
small binding domains, drawn rna polymerase mumps virus its
closest relatives. assessed face value domains fall structural
continuum, folded, partially folded, near unstructured members. yet 
disorder present family conditional, closely related
polypeptides access folded state appropriate conditions. any
heuristic definition protein domain emphasizing conformational stability
divides domain family two, way makes biological sense.
structural domains would better defined ability adopt specific
tertiary structure: structure may may realized, dependent the
circumstances. explicitly allows conditional nature protein
folding, clearly demarcates structural domains intrinsically
disordered regions may function without folding.
