background: genotypic drug resistance testing provides essential information 
guiding treatment hiv-infected patients. may either used identifying
patients transmitted drug resistance clarify reasons treatment
failure check remaining treatment options. different approaches 
for interpretation hiv sequence information already available, no
other available rules-based systems specifically looked effects 
combinations drugs. hiv-grade (genotypischer resistenz algorithmus
deutschland) planned countrywide approach establish standardized drug
resistance interpretation germany also introduce rules estimating
the influence mutations drug combinations. rules hiv-grade are
taken literature, clinical follow-up data a
bioinformatics-driven interpretation system (geno2pheno([resistance])). hiv-grade
presents option seeing rules results drug resistance
algorithms given sequence simultaneously.
methods: hiv-grade rules-based interpretation system developed the
members hiv-grade registered society. continuous updates, expert 
committee meets twice year analyze data various sources. besides data
from clinical studies centers involved, published correlations for
mutations drug resistance genotype-phenotype correlation data
information bioinformatic models geno2pheno used generate 
rules hiv-grade interpretation system. freely available online tool was
developed basis stanford hivdb rules interpretation tool using 
algorithm specification interface. clinical validation interpretation
system performed data treatment episodes consisting sequence
information, antiretroviral treatment viral load, 3 months after
treatment change. data analyzed using multiple linear regression.
results: developed online tool allows easy comparison different drug
resistance interpretation systems, coefficients determination (r(2)) were
compared freely available rules-based systems. hiv-grade (r(2) = 0.40),
stanford hivdb (r(2) = 0.40), rega algorithm (r(2) = 0.36) anrs (r(2) = 0.35)
had similar performance using multiple linear regression model.
conclusion: performance hiv-grade comparable alternative rules-based
interpretation systems. still room improvement, hiv-grade 
been made publicly available allow access approach regarding the
interpretation resistance single drugs drug combinations.
