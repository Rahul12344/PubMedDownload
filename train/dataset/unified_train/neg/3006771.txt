protein blot analysis virus receptors: identification characterization 
the sendai virus receptor.

receptors sendai virions human erythrocyte ghost membranes identified
by virus overlay protein blots. among various erythrocyte polypeptides,
only glycophorin able bind sendai virions effectively. detection of
sendai virions bound glycophorin accomplished either employing
anti-sendai virus antibodies autoradiography, 125i-labeled sendai
virions used. binding activity associated viral
hemagglutinin/neuraminidase (hn) glycoprotein, inferred observation
that binding pattern purified hn glycoprotein human erythrocyte
membranes identical intact sendai virions. binding observed
when blots, containing either human erythrocyte membranes purified
glycophorin, probed viral fusion factor (f glycoprotein). active
virions competed effectively binding 125i-labeled sendai virions (or 
purified hn glycoprotein), whereas competition observed inactivated
sendai virus. results present work clearly show protein blotting 
can used identify virus receptors cell membrane preparations.
