background & objective: ezrin, cytoskeleton-related protein, contributes the
invasion metastasis tumors; previous study also shown that
epstein-barr virus latent membrane protein 1 (ebv-lmp1) promote the
metastasis nasopharyngeal carcinoma (npc) cells. study investigate
whether ebv-lmp1 could change expression ezrin role ezrin on
the metastasis npc cells.
methods: expression ebv-lmp1 ezrin npc cell lines cne1 (well
differentiated npc cell line) cne1-gl (cne1 cells stably transfected with
ebv-lmp1) detected sp immunohistochemistry western blot. adhesive
abilities cne1, cne1-gl antiezrin-cne1-gl (cne1-gl cells pretreated with
ezrin antibody) cells assessed cell-matrix adhesion assay. invasion
and migration cell lines investigated transwell method.
results: ezrin expressed cne1 cells strongly expressed in
cne1-gl cells. adhesive ability cne1-gl cells matrix was
significantly higher cne1 antiezrin-cne1-gl cells [adhesive
rate: (89.38+/-6.12)% vs. (49.42+/-5.37)% (56.94+/-4.08)%, p<0.001, p<0.05]. 
the invasion migration cne1-gl cells significantly higher 
of cne1 antiezrin-cne1-gl cells (invasive cells: 107+/-11 vs. 27+/-3 and
38+/-4, p<0.001; migratory cells: 179+/-25 vs. 46+/-6 51+/-5, p<0.001).
conclusion: ebv-lmp1 contributes metastasis ability cne1 cells by
up-regulating expression ezrin.
