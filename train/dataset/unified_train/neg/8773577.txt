we investigating neutrophilic infiltration herpes simplex virus type 1
(hsv-1)-infected mouse corneas. using novel ex vivo corneal migration assay, we
demonstrated two waves neutrophil chemotaxis hsv-1-infected corneas. an
early chemotactic gradient developed within 48 h concert appearance
of hsv-1 epithelial lesions, peaked 4 days post-infection (p.i.), degraded
by 6-8 days p.i.. second chemotactic gradient appeared 10 days infection,
just initiation chronic inflammation. gradient maintained
in corneas developed inflammation rapidly degraded corneas that
failed develop inflammation. early chemotactic gradient established in
the absence lymphocytes, second chemotactic gradient virtually
abrogated cell depletion. conclude hsv-1 infection induces two
temporally separated neutrophil chemotactic gradients mouse cornea: an
early, transient, cell-independent gradient; later, chronic, t
cell-dependent gradient.
