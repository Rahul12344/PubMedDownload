the human genome structurally organized three-dimensional space to
facilitate functional partitioning transcription. learned latent
episome human epstein-barr virus (ebv) preferentially associates with
gene-poor chromosomes avoids gene-rich chromosomes. kaposi's
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus behaves similarly, human papillomavirus does
not. contacts ebv side localize orip, latent origin replication.
this genetic element ebna1 protein binds sufficient to
reconstitute chromosome association preferences entire episome. contacts
on human side localize gene-poor at-rich regions chromatin distant 
from transcription start sites. upon reactivation latency, however, the
episome moves away repressive heterochromatin toward active euchromatin.
our work adds three-dimensional relocalization molecular events occur
during reactivation. involvement myriad interchromosomal associations also
suggests role type long-range association gene
regulation.importance human genome structurally organized in
three-dimensional space, structure functionally affects transcriptional 
activity. set investigate whether double-stranded dna virus,
epstein-barr virus (ebv), uses mechanisms similar human genome to
regulate transcription. found ebv genome associates repressive
compartments nucleus latency active compartments during
reactivation. study advances knowledge ebv life cycle, adding
three-dimensional relocalization novel component molecular events
that occur reactivation. furthermore, data add understanding of
nuclear compartments, showing disperse interchromosomal interactions may 
important regulating transcription.
