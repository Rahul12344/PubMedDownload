pseudolysogeny defined stage stalled development a
bacteriophage host cell without either multiplication phage genome
(as lytic development) replication synchronized cell cycle and
stable maintenance cell line (as lysogenization), proceeds with
no viral genome degradation, thus allowing subsequent restart virus
development. phenomenon usually caused unfavorable growth conditions
for host cell (such starvation) terminated initiation of
either true lysogenization lytic growth growth conditions improve.
pseudolysogeny known tens years; however, role often been
underestimated. currently, considered often important
aspect phage-host interactions. reason mostly increased
interest phage-host interactions natural environment. pseudolysogeny
seems play important role phage survival, bacteria natural
environment starved growth slow. phenomenon an
important aspect phage-dependent bacterial mortality may influence the
virulence bacterial strains.
