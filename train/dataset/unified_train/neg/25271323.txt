kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) epstein-barr virus (ebv) are
human dna tumor viruses express nuclear antigens [latency-associated nuclear
antigen 1 (lana1) epstein-barr nuclear antigen 1 (ebna1)] necessary to
maintain replicate viral genome. report lana1 ebna1
undergo highly efficient +1/-2 programmed ribosomal frameshifting generate
previously undescribed alternative reading frame (arf) proteins repeat
regions. ebna1(arf) encodes kshv lana-like glutamine- glutamic acid-rich
protein, whereas kshv lana1(arf) encodes serine/arginine-like protein. repeat
sequence recoding described previously human dna viruses.
programmed frameshifting (recoding) generate multiple proteins one rna
sequence increase coding capacity virus, without incurring a
selective penalty increased capsid size. presence similar repeat
sequences cellular genes, huntingtin, suggests comparison of
repeat recoding virus human systems may provide functional mechanistic
insights systems.
