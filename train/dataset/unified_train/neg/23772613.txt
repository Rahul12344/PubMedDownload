the global spread human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) dependent the
ability virus efficiently cross one host next by
traversing mucosal membrane. unraveling mucosal exposure hiv results 
systemic infection critical development effective therapeutic
strategies. review focuses understanding immune events associated
with oral route transmission (via breastfeeding sexual oral
intercourse), occurs across oral and/or gastrointestinal mucosa.
studies humans simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) monkey models have
identified viral changes immune events associated oral hiv/siv exposure.
this review covers current knowledge hiv oral transmission infants
and adults, use siv models understanding early immune events, oral
immune factors modulate hiv/siv susceptibility (including mucosal
inflammation), interventions may impact oral hiv transmission rates.
understanding factors influence oral hiv transmission provide the
foundation developing immune therapeutic vaccine strategies can
protect infants adults oral hiv transmission.
