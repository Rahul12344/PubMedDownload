inhibitor studies phage t4 wild-type mutant dna polymerases. v. a. summary
of kinetic inhibitor data.

schroeder c, jantschak j.

the dna polymerases phage t4 wild-type, mutator mutant l98 the
antimutator mutant cb121 purified 100-fold free foreign enzyme
activities interfering polymerase assay. enzymes characterized 
as thermostability, exonuclease activity kinetic data dna template
primer, deoxythymidine 5' -triphosphate, mixture four
deoxynucleoside 5' -triphosphates. effects eight inhibitors dna
synthesis three enzymes determined (schroeder jantschak 1978 
1980, jantschak schroeder 1980) compared here. selective
inhibitor, pyridoxal 5' -phosphate, interacts active site the
polymerases two least discriminating drugs, distamycin and
actinomycin d, directly interact polymerases all. study
was intended test whether specific enzyme inhibitors elicit differential
response temperature-sensitive structural variants enzyme whether,
in principle, structural variants virus enzymes respective ts- mutants 
in vivo suitable screening system selective antiviral agents.
