setting: tuberculin skin test (tst) interferon-gamma release assays
(igras) used supportive evidence diagnose active tuberculosis (tb).
novel igras could improve diagnosis, data lacking young children.
design: children (age 5 years) suspected tb prospectively screened 
a tertiary hospital pune, india; children underwent tst, standard
(early secretory antigenic target 6 culture filtrate protein 10) enhanced
(five additional novel antigens) enzyme-linked immunospot (elispot) assays.
results: 313 children (median age 30 months) enrolled, 92% received
bacille calmette-guérin vaccination, 53% malnourished 9% coinfected
with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv); 48 (15%) tb, 128 (41%) not, 
and tb could ruled 137 (44%). sensitivity enhanced (45%) and
standard (42%) elispot assays diagnosing tb better tst (20%)
(p  0.03); however, enhanced elispot sensitive standard
elispot assay (p = 0.50). specificity enhanced elispot, standard elispot
and tst respectively 82% (95%ci 74-89), 88% (95%ci 81-94) 98% (95%ci
93-100). rv3879c rv3615c, previously reported promising antigens,
failed improve diagnostic performance elispot assay.
conclusion: tst standard novel elispot assays performed poorly in
diagnosing active tb among young children india.
