latent epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection associated diverse group of
malignancies including burkitt's lymphoma, hodgkin's disease, nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (npc), lymphoproliferative disease (lpd). ebv proteins expressed in
these malignancies provide targets adoptive immunotherapy with
antigen-specific cytotoxic cells (ctl) ebv-specific ctl used
successfully prophylaxis treatment ebv-lpd post hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation (hsct). clinical experience ebv-specific ctl for
other ebv-associated malignancies hodgkin's disease npc limited
and results obtained far indicate ebv-specific ctl less effective
than ebv-lpd post hsct. decreased ctl efficacy likely reflect immune
evasion strategies tumor cells regulation immunodominant ebv
proteins secretion inhibitory cytokines. overcome immune evasion 
strategies number approaches developed including targeting ctl 
subdominant ebv antigens genetically modifying ctl increase potency.
