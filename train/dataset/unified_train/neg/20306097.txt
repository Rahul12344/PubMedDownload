human beta-defensins 2-5 kda, cationic, microbicidal peptides, which
represent first-line host defense several gram-negative and
gram-positive bacteria, fungi viruses. contain conserved
disulfide-bridge pattern three pairs intramolecular cystine bonds. the
well-known public health problem related growing number of
multiresistant bacteria driven research look novel antibiotics, such
beta-defensins feasible way produce them. heterologous expression of
beta-defensins could one way generate large quantities beta-defensins
for clinical research; however, heterologous expression beta-defensins has
some biochemical problems, toxicity toward host cell, peptide
degradation proteolytic cell enzymes, size, folding constrains low
recombinant peptide yields. communication, several heterologous systems
for producing human beta-defensins reviewed.
