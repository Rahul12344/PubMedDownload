we report complete genome sequence duck enteritis virus (dev)
wild-type strain 2085, avian herpesvirus (genbank id: jf999965). the
nucleotide sequence derived 2085 genome cloned infectious
bacterial artificial chromosome (bac) clone. dev 2085 genome 160,649-bp in
length encodes 78 predicted open reading frames (orfs), number identical to
that identified attenuated dev vac strain (genbank id: eu082088.2).
comparison genome sequences dev 2085 vac partial sequences the
virulent chv strain attenuated strain clone-03 carried to
identify nucleotide amino acid polymorphisms potentially contribute to
dev virulence. amino acid changes identified 24 78 orfs, a
result indicating high conservation dev independently strain origin or
virulence. addition, 39 orfs contain non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions, 
while 15 orfs nucleotide insertions deletions, frame-shift mutations
and/or non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions effect orf initiation
or termination. 7 15 orfs high 27 39 orfs low
variability, polymorphisms exclusively found dev 2085, finding that
likely result different origin 2085 (europe) vac, clone-03 and
chv (eastern asia). five orfs (ul2, ul12, us10, ul47 ul41) polymorphisms
were identical virulent dev 2085 chv different vac or
clone-03. they, individually combination, may therefore represent dev
virulence factors. comparative analysis four dev sequences provides a
comprehensive overview dev genome structure identifies orfs are
changed serial virus passage.
