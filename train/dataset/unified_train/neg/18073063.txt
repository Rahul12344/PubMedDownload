objective: prepare oligo microarrays hepatitis virus detection and
genotyping.
methods: analyzing dna cdna hbv, hdv 4 different genotypes of
hcv blast program, group specific sequences candidate
probes specified. array designer 3.0 software applied analyze the
candidates select probes high specificity, identical length similar
melting temperature (tm). altogether 16, 8 68 oligonucleotide probes were
designed diagnosis hbv, hdv, genotyping hcv. following the
synthesizing purification, oligo probes deposited oligonucleotide
chips microarrays hepatitis virus detection genotyping. samples
were labeled rd-pcr method. hybridization results analyzed cross out
those probes low specificity sensitivity, signal noise
ratios (snr) less 4.0.
results: two types gene chips successfully developed: microarrays hbv
and hdv simultaneous detection hcv genotyping.
conclusion: using oligo probes construct gene chips clinical diagnosis 
hepatitis virus simple effective method. may widely used in
detecting hepatitis viruses genotyping clinical settings.
