background: aim study evaluate epigenetic status cyclin a1 
in human papillomavirus-associated cervical cancer. y. tokumaru et al., cancer
res 64, 5982-7 (sep 1, 2004)demonstrated head neck squamous-cell cancer an
inverse correlation cyclin a1 promoter hypermethylation tp53
mutation. human papillomavirus-associated cervical cancer, however, deprived
of tp53 function different mechanism. therefore, interest to
investigate epigenetic alterations multistep cervical cancer
development.
methods: study, performed duplex methylation-specific pcr reverse 
transcriptase pcr several cervical cancer cell lines microdissected
cervical cancers. furthermore, incidence cyclin a1 methylation studied
in 43 samples white blood cells, 25 normal cervices, 24, 5 30 human
papillomavirus-associated premalignant, microinvasive invasive cervical
lesions, respectively.
results: demonstrated cyclin a1 methylation commonly found cervical
cancer, vitro vivo, physiological role decrease 
gene expression. important, study demonstrated cyclin 
a1 promoter hypermethylation strikingly common cervical cancer, also
specific invasive phenotype comparison histopathological
stages multistep carcinogenesis. none normal cells low-grade
squamous intraepithelial lesions exhibited methylation. contrast, 36.6%, 60%
and 93.3% high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, microinvasive and
invasive cancers, respectively, showed methylation.
conclusion: methylation study indicated cyclin a1 potential tumor 
marker early diagnosis invasive cervical cancer.
