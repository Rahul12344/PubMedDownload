the epstein-barr virus ebna2 protein transcriptional activator achieves
promoter specificity interaction cellular dna-binding protein
cbf1/rbpjk. within amino acid 252-to-425 ebna2 domain targets cbf1/rbpjk
lie three amino acid clusters, conserved regions (cr) 5, 6, 7, are
retained epstein-barr virus type type b herpesvirus papio
proteins. define important features targeting domain, we
constructed ebna2 polypeptides containing deletions targeting domain and
double triple point mutations conserved motifs. ability these
polypeptides type b herpesvirus papio domains interact with
cbf1/rbpjk examined performing electrophoretic mobility shift assays and
correlated effect mutations ebna2 transactivation. human 
type b ebna2 herpesvirus papio ebna2 bound cbf1/rbpjk efficiently. mutation
of hydrophobic residues cr6 severely impaired cbf1/rbpjk interaction and
transactivation, mutation cr5 led moderate decrease both
activities. mutation cr7 minor effect. synthetic peptides
corresponding conserved motifs also used competitors an
electrophoretic mobility shift assay. peptide representing cr6 (amino
acids 318 327), version peptide mutated tryptophan
residues positions 323 324 (ww323,324), could compete ebna2 complex
formation cbf1/rbpjk. overall, data indicated cr5 contributes an
optimal interaction, perhaps stabilizing contacts, cr6 forms a
crucial interface cbf1/rbpjk. peptide competition data consistent
with direct contacts ww323,324 cbf1/rbpjk.
