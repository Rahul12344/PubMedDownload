rationale: regulator g-protein signaling 4 (rgs4) brain-enriched negative
modulator g-protein-coupled receptor signaling. decreased availability rgs4
in frontal cortex striatum described animal models of
schizophrenia drug addiction. however, cellular behavioral consequences
of dysregulated rgs4-dependent receptor signaling brain remain poorly
understood.
objective: study aims investigate whether rgs4, inhibiting the
function mglur5 receptors dorsal striatum (dstr), regulates cellular
and behavioral responses acute amphetamine.
methods: herpes simplex virus-rgs4 infused dstr, rgs4
overexpression well binding recombinant rgs4 mglur5 assessed. the
effect rgs4 overexpression behavioral activity induced intrastriatal
mglur5 agonist, dhpg, amphetamine recorded. activation extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (erk) akt (protein kinase b) measured dstr
tissue end behavioral experiment.
results: rgs4 overexpressed dstr coimmunoprecipitated mglur5
receptors suppressed behavioral activity phospho-erk levels induced 
by dhpg. rgs4 overexpression mglur5 antagonist,
3-((2-methyl-4-thiazolyl)ethynyl)pyridine (mtep), attenuated amphetamine-induced 
phospho-erk (but phospho-akt) levels. rgs4 suppressed amphetamine-induced
vertical activity augmented horizontal activity 90Â min. similarly, mtep 
augmented amphetamine-induced horizontal activity, affect vertical
activity.
conclusions: present data demonstrate rgs4 dstr attenuates
amphetamine-induced erk signaling decreases behavioral efficacy acute 
amphetamine likely limiting mglur5 function.
