background: data available describing natural history the
epstein-barr virus (ebv) viral load diagnosis ebv-associated
posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (ptld). accordingly, prospectively 
followed ebv viral load diagnosis ebv/ptld seven pediatric
orthotopic liver transplant recipients.
methods: ebv viral loads serially measured quantitative competitive
polymerase chain reaction peripheral blood pediatric patients with
ptld correlated clinical course children. viral loads >200 
genome copies/10(5) peripheral blood lymphocytes considered consistent 
an increased risk ptld. viral loads <200 obtained treatment ptld
were considered evidence "clearance" ebv; subsequent loads >200 were
considered evidence virologic "rebound."
results: mean ebv viral load time diagnosis ptld 1029. all
patients "cleared" ebv viral load treatment ptld; patient and
graft survival series 100%. mean time clearance ebv from
the peripheral blood (18.8 days) similar mean time onset first
rejection (13.8 days). ebv viral load time diagnosis rejection after
ptld always <100. rebound ebv viral load >200 noted five
of seven patients median 3.5 months (range 2.3-13 months) the
diagnosis ebv/ptld. however, none children evidence of
ptld recurrence.
conclusions: clearance ebv viral load peripheral blood seems to
correlate restoration host's immune response noted the
regression ptld onset rejection. late rebound ebv viral 
load common seem predict disease recurrence.
