since discovery induced pluripotent stem cells intense
interest understanding mechanisms allow somatic cell be
reprogrammed back pluripotent state. several groups studied the
alterations gene expression occur somatic cells modify genome to
that embryonic stem cell. underpinning many gene expression changes 
are modifications epigenetic profile associated chromatin. 
used large-scale shrna screen identify epigenetic modifiers act as
barriers reprogramming. uncovered important role trim28 in
cells resisting transition somatic pluripotent states. trim28
achieves maintaining h3k9me3 repressed state keeping endogenous
retroviruses (ervs) silenced. propose knockdown trim28 during
reprogramming results plastic h3k9me3 domains, dysregulation genes
nearby h3k9me3 marks, regulation ervs, thus facilitating transition
through reprogramming. stem cells 2017;35:147-157.
