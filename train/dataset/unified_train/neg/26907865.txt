the number human avian h7n9 influenza infections increasing china.
understanding antigenic serologic relationships crucial for
developing diagnostic tools vaccines. here, evaluated the
cross-reactivities neutralizing activities among h7 subtype influenza viruses
and h7n9 heterosubtype influenza viruses. found strong
cross-reactivities h7n9 divergent h7 subtypic viruses, including
h7n2, h7n3, h7n7. antisera h7n2, h7n3, h7n7 could also
effectively neutralize two distinct h7n9 strains. two-way cross-reactivities
exist within group 2, including h3 h4, whereas one-way cross-reactivities
were found across groups, including h1, h10, h9, h13. data indicate
that hemaglutinins divergent h7 subtypes may facilitate development 
of vaccines distinct h7n9 infections. moreover, serologic diagnoses h7n9 
infections need consider possible interference cross-reactivity of
h7n9 subtype influenza viruses.
