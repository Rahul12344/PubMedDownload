the genomic, biological, serological characterization tomato necrotic spot
virus (tonsv), virus first described infecting tomato california, was
completed. complete genomic sequence identified tonsv new subgroup 1
ilarvirus distinct previously described tomato-infecting ilarviruses. we
identified tonsv indiana 2017 2018 ohio 2018. coat
protein coding region isolates california, indiana, ohio 94 
to 98% identity, isolates 99% amino acid identity. tonsv is
serologically related tsv, subgroup 1 ilarvirus, shows serological
relationship ilarviruses subgroups. tomato, tonsv caused
symptoms necrotic spots flecks leaves, necrotic streaking stems, and
necrotic spots circular patterns fruit resulting yield loss 1 to
13%. results indicate tonsv proposed new subgroup 1 ilarvirus
causing necrotic spotting disease tomato observed california, indiana,
and ohio.
