chronic injury results wound healing response eventually leads to
fibrosis. response generalized, features common among multiple organ 
systems. liver, various different types injury lead fibrogenesis,
implying common pathogenesis. although several specific therapies patients 
who different liver diseases successfully developed, including
antiviral therapies hepatitis b hepatitis c virus
infection, specific effective antifibrotic therapy remains elusive. 
past 2 decades, great advances understanding fibrosis made
and multiple mechanisms underlying hepatic fibrogenesis uncovered. elucidation of
these mechanisms fundamental importance highlighting novel
potential therapies. preclinical studies indicated several putative
therapies might abrogate fibrogenesis. article emphasizes mechanisms
underlying fibrogenesis reviews available future therapeutics.
