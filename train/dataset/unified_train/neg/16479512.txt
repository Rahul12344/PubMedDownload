most congenital human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) infections asymptomatic, but
some lead severe disease. hypothesized differences disease
manifestations may partially explained differences viral strains. we
recently reported association unique long (ul) 144 gene polymorphisms 
and clinical disease. report sequence heterogeneity 2 potential 
hcmv virulence genes encode alpha -chemokines: ul146 ul147. 2
genes highly divergent cultured isolates obtained 23 newborns with
congenital hcmv infection difficult categorize. unlike findings
for contiguous ul144 gene, specific ul146 ul147 genotype associated
with disease outcome.
