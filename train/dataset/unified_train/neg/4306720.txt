inhibitors hemagglutination type a2 influenza virus recently isolated
strain type b influenza virus separated sucrose density gradient
centrifugation agarose gel filtration horse serum. using selected
reagents, demonstrated active substituent horse serum
inhibitor a2 influenza virus 4-o-acetyl-n-acetylneuraminic acid; however, 
the active substituent inhibitor influenza b virus shown 
n-acetylneuraminic acid (nana). sodium metaperiodate treatment component 
horse serum resulted 10 15-fold enhancement inhibitory activity
against type b virus, whereas a2 inhibitor completely destroyed.
since enhancement occur influenza b viruses isolated prior to
1965, considered sensitivity oxidized nana glycoside may
have reflection antigenic change occurred time. the
use different virus strains selected chemical reagents define the
important sialic acid prosthetic groups active inhibition described.
