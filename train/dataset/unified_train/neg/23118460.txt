coxsackievirus b3 (cvb3) enterovirus family picornaviridae is
significant human health, associated myocarditis, aseptic
meningitis, pancreatitis, among conditions. addition humans,
sichuan snub-nosed monkeys infected killed cvb3. here, report
the first complete genome sequence novel coxsackievirus b3 strain, ssm-cvb3,
which isolated deceased sichuan snub-nosed monkey severe
myocarditis. findings may aid understanding evolutionary
characteristics molecular pathogenesis virus.
