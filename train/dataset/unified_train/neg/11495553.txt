background: human papillomavirus (hpv) significant cause cervical 
cancer. view number drawbacks associated endocervical sampling,
the gold standard hpv detection, study examined utility and
specificity vaginal sampling alternative endocervical sampling for
the routine detection hpv.
case study: study comprised 51 women tested positive 54 women who
tested negative endocervical hpv polymerase chain reaction (pcr),
confirmed histopathology. time specimen collection, both
(speculum-assisted) endocervical vaginal (no speculum) scrapings were
isolated hpv-positive negative women, hpv dna assessed pcr
using my09/my11 primer system; hpv type identified hybridization of
pcr products type-specific biotinylated dna probes. participant served 
as control. hpv detected vaginal cervical scrapes all
hpv-positive hpv-negative women. hpv-positive women hpv type 
was found vaginal endocervical scrapings (positive predictive value =
1.0).
conclusion: correlation vaginal endocervical sampling methods was
excellent detecting presence hpv dna identifying distinct hpv
genotypes. utilization vaginal testing routine hpv detection, 
long-term follow-up persistent hpv infection, therefore recommended.
