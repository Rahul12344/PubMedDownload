we report adaptation dendrimer-based nonviral expression system for
ciliary neurotrophic factor (cntf) overproduction human mesenchymal stem cells
(hmscs) embedded fibrin-based three-dimensional (3d) matrix. time-restricted
neurotrophin expression enables autologous adult stem cells additional
trophic support increases therapeutic potential neuroregeneration
applications. polyamidoamine (pamam)-nh(2) dendrimers fourth generation
effectively provided virus-free delivery expression cntf-internal ribosome
entry site-green fluorescent protein cassette transfection efficiency in
hmscs 11%. cntf levels transfected cultures 10-fold higher as
compared control cells. dendrimer-driven cntf expression also persisted 
in hmscs embedded fibrin-based 3d matrix, emerging vehicle cell
delivery bioartificial organ formation. nonviral modification autologous
adult stem cells use dendrimers novel tool perspective terms of
biosafety technological availability.
