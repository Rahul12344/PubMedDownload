the baculovirus classic example parasite alters behavior or
physiology host progeny transmission maximized. baculoviruses
do inducing enhanced locomotory activity (ela) causes host
caterpillars climb upper foliage plants. previously reported that
this behavior induced silkworms infected mutant
baculovirus lacking protein tyrosine phosphatase (ptp) gene, gene likely
captured ancestral host. show product ptp gene,
ptp, associates baculovirus orf1629 virion structural protein, but
surprisingly phosphatase activity associated ptp required the
induction ela. interestingly, ptp knockout baculovirus showed
significantly reduced infectivity larval brain tissues. collectively, show 
that modern baculovirus uses host-derived phosphatase establish
adequate infection ela virion-associated structural protein rather 
as enzyme.
