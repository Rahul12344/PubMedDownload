gastroenteritis, one found dead bed, brother survived 
since healthy. notably, deceased treated an
antibiotic containing pivalic acid, may sometimes cause hypocarnitinemia.
postmortem computed tomography medicolegal autopsy demonstrated severe liver 
steatosis, subsequent genetic analysis revealed twin the
thermolabile variant carnitine palmitoyl transferase 2 (cpt2). basis of
these facts, concluded cause death fatty acid oxidation
deficiency accelerated antibiotic containing pivalic acid virus
infection infant harboring thermolabile genetic variant cpt2.
