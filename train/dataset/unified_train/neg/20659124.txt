genome copy number changes (copy number variations: cnvs) include inherited, de
novo somatically acquired deviations diploid state within particular
chromosomal segment. cnvs frequent higher eukaryotes associated a
substantial portion inherited acquired risk various human diseases.
cnvs distributed widely genomes apparently healthy individuals 
thus constitute significant amounts population-based genomic variation. human 
cnv loci enriched immune genes one striking examples of
cnv humans involves genomic region containing chemokine genes ccl3l 
ccl4l. ccl3l-ccl4l copy number variable region (cnvr) shows extensive
architectural complexity, smaller cnvs within larger ones with
interindividual variation breakpoints. furthermore, individual genes
embedded cnvr account additional level genetic mrna
complexity: ccl4l1 ccl4l2 identical exonic sequences produce a
different pattern mrnas. ccl3l2 considered previously ccl3l1
pseudogene, actually transcribed. since 2005, ccl3l-ccl4l cnv been
associated extensively various human immunodeficiency virus-related
outcomes, recent studies called associations question. this
controversy may due part differences alternative methods for
quantifying gene copy number differentiating individual genes. this
review summarizes discusses current knowledge ccl3l-ccl4l cnv and
points elucidating complete phenotypic impact requires dissecting 
the combinatorial genomic complexity posed various proportions distinct
ccl3l ccl4l genes among individuals.
