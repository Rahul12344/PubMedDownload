ex vivo gene transfer cns far hampered instability of
transgene expression. avoid phenomenon transgene down-regulation, we
have employed strong, constitutive promoters compared expression system 
with inducible tet expression system incorporated single plasmid vector 
or lentiviral vectors. plasmid-based transgene expression directed the
constitutive, human ubiquitin promoter, ubc, stable transfected hib5 cells
in vitro comparable strength cmv promoter. however, after
transplantation ubc cmv hib5 clones rat striatum, silencing 
transgene occurred cells soon implantation transfected cells.
the tet-on elements incorporated single plasmid vector inducible
hib5 clones generated. inducible clones displayed varying basal expression
activity, could ascribed effect cis-elements vector,
but rather due, least part, intrinsic activity minimal
promoter. basal expression activity could blocked majority cells by
stable expressing transrepressor tts. fully induced expression levels were
comparable cmv ubc promoters. similar constitutive promoters
transgene expression down-regulated soon grafting inducible hib5
clones rat striatum. lentiviral vectors direct long-term stable in
vivo transgene expression. take advantage quality lentiviral
vector, tet-on elements incorporated two lentiviral transfer vectors 
followed transduction hib5 cells. interestingly, hib5 clones
established lentiviral transduction showed similar expression patterns
and tight regulatability apparently independent transgene copy number
and integration site. nevertheless, transgene expression lentiviral hib5
clones down-regulated shortly transplantation rat striatum.
these results confirm general phenomenon transgene down-regulation.
moreover, results suggest considerable advantages offered by
lentiviral vectors direct gene delivery cannot necessarily transferred
directly ex vivo gene delivery. emphasizes need alternative
vector strategies ex vivo gene transfer.
