viruses abundant component human microbiota. recent evidence 
has uncovered rich diversity viruses within female bladder, including
both bacteriophages eukaryotic viruses. conducted whole-genome sequencing 
of bladder microbiome 30 women: 10 asymptomatic 'healthy' women 20
women overactive bladder. metagenomes include sequences
representative human, bacterial viral dna. analysis, however, focused
specifically viral sequences. using bioinformatic tool virmine, we
discovered sequence fragments, well complete genomes, bacteriophages and
the eukaryotic virus jc polyomavirus. method employed critical
proof concept: genomes viral populations within low-biomass bladder
microbiota reconstructed whole-genome sequencing entire
microbial community.
