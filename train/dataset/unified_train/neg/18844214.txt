amplification long arm chromosome 8 one recurrent
findings prostate cancer associated poor prognosis. several
minimal regions amplification suggest multiple target genes yet to
be identified. previously shown tceb1, eif3s3, kiaa0196 rad21
are amplified overexpressed prostate cancer located 8q
area. study, examined functional effects genes to
prostate cancer cell phenotype. overexpressed inhibited genes by
lentivirus mediated overexpression rna interference, respectively. shrna
mediated tceb1 silencing decreased significantly cellular invasion pc-3 and
du145 cells matrigel. tceb1 silencing reduced anchorage-independent
growth pc-3 cells. similar effects seen genes. when
overexpressed nih 3t3 cells, tceb1 eif3s3 increased growth rate the
cells. transcriptional profiling tceb1 silenced pc-3 cells revealed decrease
of genes involved invasion metastasis. finally, also confirmed the
overexpression tceb1 hormone-refractory prostate tumors. study
indicates tceb1 promotes invasion prostate cancer cells, involved in
development hormone-refractory prostate cancer thereby strong
candidate one target genes 8q gain.
