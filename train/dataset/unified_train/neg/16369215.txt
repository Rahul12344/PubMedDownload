circumscribed. chronic liver disease, liver biopsy often used
selectively, rather routinely, diagnostic purposes. newer treatment of
chronic hepatitis b c become effective thus reduced routine 
need acquire tissue. risk factors nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are
readily identified suggest diagnosis exclusion alternative
considerations, specific treatment condition; thus there
is little role routine use liver biopsy guide treatment. in
select cases chronic hepatitis c, especially patients genotype 1, an
indeterminate stage grade disease noninvasive evaluation, those
