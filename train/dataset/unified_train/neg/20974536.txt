restricting linear peptides bioactive conformation attractive way 
of improving stability activity. used cyclic peptide library 
conformational diversity selecting active stable peptide mimics
the structure activity hiv-1 integrase (in) binding loop its
cellular cofactor ledgf/p75 (residues 361-370). peptides library had
the primary sequence, differed conformation. library
screening revealed ring size linker structure huge effect on
the conformation, binding activity peptides. one cyclic
peptides, c(mz 4-1), potent stable inhibitor activity vitro
and cells even 8 days. nmr structure c(mz 4-1) showed it
obtains bioactive conformation similar parent site ledgf/p75.
