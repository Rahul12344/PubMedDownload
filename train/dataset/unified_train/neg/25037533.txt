objectives: compared 3rd generation (gen) two 4th gen hiv enzyme
immunoassays (eia) pooled nucleic acid testing (pnat) identification
of pre- early seroconversion acute hiv infection (ahi).
study design: 9550 specimens males >18 year clinics attended men who
have sex men tested siemens advia centaur(®) hiv 1/o/2 (3rd gen) and
hiv combo (4th gen), well abbott architect(®) hiv ag/ab combo (4th gen).
third gen non-reactive specimens also tested roche cobas(®)
ampliprep/cobas® taqman hiv-1 test v.2 pools 24 samples. sensitivity and
specificity three eias ahi detection compared.
results: 7348 persons contributed 9435 specimens evidence hiv
infection, 79 (94 specimens) established hiv infection, 6 (9 specimens) had
pre-seroconversion ahi 9 (12 specimens) early seroconversion ahi.
pre-seroconversion ahi cases detected 3rd gen eia, whereas 2/6
(33.3%) detected siemens 4th gen, 4/6 (66.7%) abbott 4th gen 6/6
(100%) pnat. three eias pnat detected individuals early
seroconversion ahi. overall sensitivity/specificity eias relative wb
or nat resolved infection status 93.6%/99.9% siemens 3rd gen, 95.7%/99.7%
for siemens 4th gen 97.9%/99.2% abbott 4th gen.
conclusions: 4th gen eias demonstrated improved sensitivity ahi
compared 3rd gen eia, pnat identified ahi cases either 4th gen
assay. pnat likely remain useful strategy identify ahi high-risk
populations.
