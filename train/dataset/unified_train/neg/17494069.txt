the addition ribavirin alpha interferon therapy significantly increases
response rates patients chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection, but
ribavirin's antiviral mechanisms unknown. ribavirin suggested to
have mutagenic potential vitro would lead "error catastrophe," i.e.,
the generation nonviable viral quasispecies due increment number
of mutant genomes, prevents transmission meaningful genetic
information. used extensive sequence-based analysis two independent genomic
regions order test vivo hypothesis ribavirin administration
accelerates accumulation mutations viral genome this
acceleration occurs hcv replication profoundly inhibited by
coadministered alpha interferon. rate variation consensus sequence,
the frequency mutation, error generation rate, between-sample
genetic distance measured patients receiving ribavirin monotherapy, a
combination alpha interferon three times per week plus ribavirin, a
combination alpha interferon daily plus ribavirin. ribavirin monotherapy did
not increase rate variation consensus sequence, mutation
frequency, error generation rate, between-sample genetic distance. the
accumulation nucleotide substitutions accelerate, relative the
pretreatment period, combination therapy ribavirin alpha
interferon, even viral replication profoundly inhibited alpha
interferon. study strongly undermines hypothesis whereby ribavirin acts 
as hcv mutagen vivo.
