background: previous contact hepatitis b virus (hbv) common patients
undergoing hemodialysis. literature shown conflicting results risk 
hbv reactivation kidney transplant (kt) recipients serologic evidence 
past hbv infection.
methods: reviewed 631 consecutive kt recipients selected 70 patients
simultaneously hbsag negative anti-hbc positive kt, regardless of
hepatitis b surface antibody (anti-hbs) status. demographic characteristics,
coinfection viruses, presence previous kt, induction and
maintenance immunosuppression, length follow up, biopsy-proven acute rejection
episodes, incidence impaired liver function, causes graft loss and
mortality collected. hepatitis b virus reactivation defined detection
of hbv dna viral load >2000 iu/ml follow up. outcome data included hbv
reactivation episodes, graft function, patient survival.
results: median follow-up 151 months; 91.4% patients positive to
anti-hbs prior kt. patient received hbv prophylaxis 11 patients (15.7%)
received rituximab part induction therapy. anti-hbs titers remained stable 
in patients throughout observation period two patient showed evidence
of hbv reactivation kt.
conclusion: hepatitis b virus reactivation hbsag-negative and
anti-hbc-positive kt rare possible. suggest evaluating hbv
serologies, hbv dna viral load, liver enzymes kt routinely
monitoring serologic hbv markers kt. two patients experienced hbv
reactivation, neither possible define risk factors hbv reactivation 
nor evaluate impact different immunosuppressants benefit of
prophylactic regimens. studies regarding hbv reactivation solid organ 
transplant recipients necessary.
