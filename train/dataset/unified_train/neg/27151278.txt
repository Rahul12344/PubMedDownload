the pathogenicity hnjz15, nadc30-like strain porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv), investigated compared a
highly pathogenic prrsv jax1 strain. six-week-old pigs infected virus
showed typical clinical symptoms, including high fever respiratory disorders.
pigs infected jxa1 more-severe clinical manifestations pigs
infected hnjz15. hnjz15 replicated vivo kinetics similar of
jxa1 induced lower level prrsv-specific antibody beginning of
virus infection. histopathologically, jxa1 infection led more-severe lung
lesions broader organ tropism hnjz15 did. different was
observed previously reported nadc30-like prrsv jl580 strain, all
hnjz15-infected pigs survived end study. results
indicated nadc30-like prrsv hnjz15 virulent pigs less
pathogenic jxa1 jl580 prrsv strains.
