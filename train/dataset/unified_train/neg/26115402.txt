the recent outbreak ebola virus disease (evd) west africa ravaged many 
lives. effective containment outbreak relies prompt effective
coordination communication across various interventions; early detection 
response critical successful control. use information and
communications technology (ict) active surveillance proved effective
but use ebola outbreak response limited. due need for
timeliness reporting communication early discovery new evd cases
and promptness response; became imperative empower response team
members technologies solutions would enable smooth rapid data 
flow. open data kit form hub technology used combination the
dashboard technology arcgis mapping follow contacts, identification
of cases, case investigation management also strategic planning
during response. remarkable improvement recorded reporting of
daily follow-up contacts deployment integrated real time
technology. turnaround time identification symptomatic contacts
and evacuation isolation facility also receipt laboratory
results reduced informed decisions could taken concerned.
accountability contact tracing ensured use gps enabled device.
the use innovative technologies response evd outbreak nigeria
contributed significantly prompt control outbreak containment
of disease providing valuable platform early warning guiding
early actions.
