concanavalin a-induced human mouse cell proliferation assay used to
detect suppressive activity ascitic fluid (af) ovarian cancer patients.
about 80% af specimens found suppressive. however, later
tested af's effect nk cell activity, instead suppression, marked
enhancement observed. il-2 barely detectable af, attention was
focused interferon (ifn). presence examined confirmed 
ability af protect hep-2 cells cytopathic effect vesicular
stomatitis virus (vsv). protective effect vsv abolished low
ph treatment anti-human interferon gamma monoclonal antibodies (mab), 
ifn identified af gamma type (ifn-gamma). mab could markedly
inhibit af's nk-enhancing effect cell suppressing effect well. 
after removal ifn-gamma af affinity chromatography, both
activities af lost. possible clinical implication new finding
with regards host's anti-tumor resistance prognosis discussed.
