the rep protein escherichia coli, helicase unwinds duplex dna a
replication fork (kornberg, a., scott, j. f., bertsch, l. l. (1978) j. biol. 
chem. 253, 3298-3304), forms binary complexes atp dna, ternary 
complexes both. atp (or datp) bound single site dissociation 
constant (kd) near 10(-7) m. ribonucleoside triphosphates and
deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates compete site far lower
affinities. protein forms binary complex single-stranded dna 
duplex dna, distinctive sites. binding single-stranded dna covers a
stretch approximately 20 nucleotides, destabilizes secondary structure, and
facilitates reannealing complementary single strands. ternary complexes rep
protein atp dna manifested atp hydrolysis binding of
labeled components. nonhydrolyzed atp analogs useful aids isolation and
studies complexes. unlike rep protein's processive action helicase
at replication fork, action single-stranded dna distributive, with
atp hydrolysis accelerating dissociation protein complex. these
and related studies serve guides understanding multiple interactions of
rep protein atp dna ligands enable unwind duplex dna a
replication fork.
