the immunogenicity inactivated whole trivalent influenza vaccines
(a/taiwan/1/86 (h1n1), a/sichuan/2/87 (h3n2), b ijing/1/87) recommended for
the 1988-89 winter season evaluated 236 elderly (mean age 71 years) high
risk volunteers. overall significant increase number subjects with
protective haemagglutination inhibiting (hi) antibodies (titer > 1:40) against
vaccine components observed vaccination. nevertheless, percentage 
individuals (ranging 56% 62%) remained without protective antibodies 
the number people showing positive response limited (from 32% 41%).
by comparative analysis results obtained examining presence of
protective levels antibody sera 91 volunteers using hi versus 
single radial haemolysis (srh) test, obtained evidence higher
sensitivity srh technique especially b antigen.
