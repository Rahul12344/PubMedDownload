in order evaluate biological activity vitro antitumor effects
of 131i-conditionally replicating oncolytic adenovirus kh901 hepg2 human
hepatoma xenografts, leves gm-csf expression determined elisa
method. panel tumor normal cells infected recombinant
adenovirus kh901 moi 10 ppc. medium harvested determine the
bioactivity gm-csf 24 hours. nude mice bearing hepg2 human hepatoma
xenografts given 131-kh901. antitumor effects assessed using endpoints 
of tumor growth delay. data showed 24 hours 131-kh901 replicated
hugely tumor cells produced significant amount gm-csf 183.27 +/- 6.90
pg/ml, producing small amount gm-csf 20.44 +/- 0.77 pg/ml normal
cells. treatment tumor, 131i-kh901 showed higher restraint rate (71.3%)
compared 131i (22.7%) kh901 (52.7%). therefore, 131-kh901 inhibit the
growth human hepatoma cell nude mice may potential drug for
treating liver cancer.
