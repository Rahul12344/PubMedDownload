after initial gavage 7.12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (dmba) determined
in virgin yellow (avy/a) agouti (a/a) (balb/cstcrlfc3hf/nctr x
vy/wffc3hf/nctr-avy) f1 hybrid female mice. subcutaneous masses reached 5-10
mm diameter, mice killed necropsied, tissues examined
histologically. mt found control mice. cumulative mt incidence 
1.5-mg dmba group (a) 43% (41/95) among yellow mice, 33% (32/96) among
agoutis. 6.0-mg dmba group (b), corresponding mt incidences 86%
(83/96) 71% (67/95). group a, first percentile mt detection was
13.0 wk initial carcinogen treatment yellow mice; 18.0 wk in
agoutis. corresponding latent periods 20th percentile 34.3 47.0 
wk. group b, latencies first percentile 8.3 9.0 wk.
corresponding latencies 20th percentile 15.3 16.0 wk. within
genotypes dose groups, rates weight gain mice developed mt and
those similar. conclude mt induced low doses dmba
arise rapidly yellow mice nonyellow littermates. absence of
spontaneous mts, acceleration chemically induced mt formation low dose
level induce general toxicity, availability genetically
identical (except one gene) normal control animals make experimental
system suitable development assay efficiently test carcinogenic 
potential low dose levels chemical substances.
