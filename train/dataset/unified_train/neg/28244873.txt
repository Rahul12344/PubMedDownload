autophagy evolutionarily conserved process recycles damaged or
unwanted cellular components, linked plant immunity. however, how
autophagy contributes plant immunity unknown. reported the
plant autophagic machinery targets virulence factor βc1 cotton leaf curl
multan virus (clcumuv) degradation interaction key
autophagy protein atg8. v32a mutation βc1 abolished interaction with
nbatg8f, virus carrying βc1v32a showed increased symptoms viral dna
accumulation plants. furthermore, silencing autophagy-related genes atg5
and atg7 reduced plant resistance dna viruses clcumuv, tomato yellow leaf 
curl virus, tomato yellow leaf curl china virus, whereas activating autophagy
by silencing gapc genes enhanced plant resistance viral infection. thus,
autophagy represents novel anti-pathogenic mechanism plays important
role antiviral immunity plants.
