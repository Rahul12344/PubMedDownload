the purpose study study use saliva samples alternative
to serum acute phase protein (app) quantifications pigs field
conditions. end, haptoglobin (hp) c-reactive protein (crp)
concentrations examined 100 animals different ages. sixty pigs were
from farm chronic prrs virus infection 40 specific pathogen
free (spf) farm. serological study performed obtain overview the
immune status animals evaluate possible concomitant infections in
animals prrs infection. results reported study showed 
saliva serum samples higher app concentrations prrs pigs aged 8-9,
17-18 24-25 weeks conventional herds spf pigs age
(p<0.05). addition, increases app obtained age independently of
the health status animals. according roc analyses performed, saliva
could better specimen serum quantify hp crp levels field
conditions may contribute efficient detection diseased animals
at farm level.
