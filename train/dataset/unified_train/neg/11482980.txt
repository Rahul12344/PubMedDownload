we sought develop retroviral vector system would produce secretion of
high levels bone morphogenetic protein (bmp)-4 optimizing expression
construct developing improved retroviral vector. replacement the
propeptide domain bmp4 bmp2 increased secretion level of
mature bmp4 protein transduced cells. intact bmp2 pro-peptide sequence was
essential, deletion small part propeptide sequence bmp2 from
the bmp2/4 hybrid construct diminished bmp4 expression secretion. addition of
a hemaglutinin tag carboxy terminus bmp4 abolished bioactivity of
secreted bmp4. transduction rat marrow stromal cells (and fibroblasts) an
mfg-based retroviral vector pseudotyped vsv-g envelope containing this
bmp2/4 hybrid expression construct led secretion high levels mature
bmp4 conditioned medium (up 1 microg/10(6) cells/24 hours). secreted
bmp4 biologically active, induced alkaline phosphatase expression in
c2c12 cells. transduced rat marrow stromal cells expressing mature bmp4
induced de novo ectopic bone formation syngenic immune-competent rats. have
developed mfg-based retroviral vector system causes secretion high
levels functionally active human bmp4 protein.
