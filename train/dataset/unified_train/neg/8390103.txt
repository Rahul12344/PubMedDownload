during years 1990 1991, smears taken anal canal 45 randomly
selected homosexual males studied. several cytological criteria used to
study infection human papillomavirus (hpv). cytological study an
anoscopy performed swab taken hpv-dna hybridization, using
labelled rna probes hpv-dna: 6,11,16,18,31,33, 35. study we
observed existence high proportion (9.5%) inadequate smears 
not contain glandular cells and/or metaplasia. sensitivity 78% a
specificity 72% obtained. sensitivity specificity 68% 91%,
respectively, criteria restricted presence koilocytes
and/or dyskeratocytes. high rate occult infections obtained study
lead us suggest simultaneous use cytology, molecular hybridization, and
anoscopy suitable care patients high risk contracting hpv 
infections anal canal.
