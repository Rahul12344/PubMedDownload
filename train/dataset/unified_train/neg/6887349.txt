p4-induced rna polymerase.

two temperature-sensitive mutants satellite phage p4 synthesize
p4 dna nonpermissive temperature isolated. one phage is
mutated p4 alpha gene. complements p4 delta mutant, p4
alpha amber mutant; mutants phenotypically identical alpha amber
mutants properties studied. synthesize p4 early proteins 1 2 as
well two additional p4-induced early proteins, 5 6, described
here. p4 late proteins synthesized mutants cannot be
transactivated helper phage p2. mutants unable transactivate p2
late proteins p2 ab mutant. p4 rna polymerase activity 
suggested involved p4 dna synthesis detected nonpermissive
temperature. p4 polymerase activity partially purified extracts prepared
from cells infected mutant permissive temperature temperature 
sensitive. reduced activity found vitro extracts are
preincubated 41 degrees c assayed temperatures higher 37 degrees c.
thus, p4 rna polymerase product alpha gene. temperature shift
experiments show alpha gene product required late p4
cycle.
