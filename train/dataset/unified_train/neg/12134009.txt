virus infections induce changes expression host cell genes. global
knowledge modifications help better understand virus/host 
cell interactions. obtain comprehensive view rainbow trout
response viral infection, used subtractive suppressive hybridization 
methodology viral hemorrhagic septicemia model infection. infected
rainbow trout leukocytes viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (vhsv), and
total rna infected mock-infected cells compared 40 h
postinfection. twenty-four virus-induced genes ultimately retrieved the
subtracted cdna library, differential expression confirmed 
by semiquantitative reverse transcription-pcr northern blot analysis. among
these sequences, three already described vhsv-induced genes. eight
sequences known homologs extended full-length cdna using 5' 3'
rapid amplification cdna ends, subsequently divided three
functional subsets. four genes homologous mammalian interferon responsive
genes, three similar chemo-attractant molecules (cxc chemokine,
galectin), two nucleic acid binding domains. virus-induced
genes also induced rainbow trout interferon, indicating the
interferon pathway predominant component anti-vhsv response. they
were also expressed vivo experimentally infected fish, indicating their
biological relevance natural infection.
