radiation leukemia virus contains two distinct viral rnas.

manteuil-brutlag s, liu sl, kaplan hs.

we analyzed rna genome radlv/vl3, highly oncogenic murine leukemia 
virus. virus produced permanent cell line derived radiation
leukemia virus-induced thymic lymphoma c57bl/ka mice. two distinct rna
components found virions: 70s dimer containing two 8 kb rna
subunits 54s dimer containing two 5.6 kb rnas. nononcogenic retrovirus,
bl/ka(b), endogenous strain mice, contains 8 kb viral rna
subunits. linkages radlv/vl3 dimers identical thermal
stabilities. dimers serve primer templates reverse transcriptase 
and produce similar "strong-stop" cdnas 147 +/- 1 bases long. sequences
at 5' end 5.6 kb subunit contain genes viral proteins p15 
and p12, gene p30 either absent partially deleted. vitro
translation 5.6 kb rna yields 100,000 molecular weight protein
containing antigenic determinants react antibody p15 with
antibody p30. addition, cells producing radlv/vl3 virus synthesize novel 
of 1.6 kb poly(a)-containing cytoplasmic rna shows little any
homology bl/ka(b) viral sequences.
