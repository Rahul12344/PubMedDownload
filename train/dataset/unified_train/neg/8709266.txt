nucleotide substitutions two positions within open reading frame encoding 
the 126-kda protein attenuated masked (m) strain tobacco mosaic
tobamovirus (tmv) found virulent u1-tmv genome led the
induction near u1-tmv-like symptoms leaves nicotiana tabacum l. cv.
xanthi nn progeny virus (m. h. shintaku, s. a. carter, y. bao, r. s.
nelson, virology 221:218-225, 1996). study, site-directed
mutations made positions within strain cdna determine
whether protein nucleotide sequence directly controlled symptom
phenotype. protein nucleotide sequence directly controlled the
symptom phenotype amino acid 360 within 126-kda protein sequence was
altered likely controlled symptom phenotype amino acid 601 was
altered. effects substitutions amino acid position 360 viral

attenuated mutant two virulent mutants, viral movement protein
and coat protein accumulated levels reported sufficient normal

of 126-kda protein mutants. reference last finding, an
explanation cause differing symptoms induced viruses is
presented.
