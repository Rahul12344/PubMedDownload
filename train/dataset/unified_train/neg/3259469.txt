we developed model assess therapeutic effects 45-2d9-ricin
a-chain immunotoxin (rta) pulmonary metastases. 45-2d9 mouse monoclonal
antibody recognizes mr 74,000 glycoprotein highly expressed rat fibroblasts 
transformed kirsten sarcoma virus (transformed rat fibroblasts). these
cells metastasize spontaneously form lung colonies nu/nu irradiated
balb/c mice. injection i.v. 45-2d9-rta specifically reduced formation of
spontaneous pulmonary metastases lung colonies originating freshly
disaggregated tumor cells cultured cells. antibody alone mixed with
unconjugated ricin chain immunotoxin recognizes a
melanoma-associated antigen ineffective. unconjugated 45-2d9 antibody
specifically blocked 45-2d9-rta activity vivo. administration the
lysosomotrophic agents ammonium chloride chloroquine vivo not
potentiate immunotoxin-mediated reduction lung colonies although were
effective vitro. monensin potentiated 45-2d9-rta activity vitro in
vivo.
