extensive bile ductular reactions (drs) accompany many cholestatic liver diseases
such primary biliary cholangitis primary sclerosing cholangitis (psc) as
well parenchymal liver cell diseases alcoholic liver disease,
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis hcv hbv infections. drs originate bile
ducts hepatocytes damage identified expression markers 
associated cholangiocytes, often associated disease progression
and fibrosis. recent issue journal pathology, govaere et al
employed high-throughput rna sequencing compare transcriptomic profiles of
dr cells liver diseases different aetiology; hcv infection affecting
hepatocytes psc initially affecting biliary epithelial cells. dr
transcriptomes markedly different neighbouring
hepatocytes 330 genes significantly differently expressed the
drs hcv psc liver diseases. exploring gene expression profiles
could enable therapeutic targeting drs, one hand inhibit liver
fibrosis inflammation conversely promote hepatocyte cholangiocyte 
regeneration. copyright © 2019 pathological society great britain ireland.
