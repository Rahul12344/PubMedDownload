the human genome contains micrornas (mirnas), small noncoding rnas that
orchestrate number physiologic processes regulation gene
expression. burgeoning evidence suggests dysregulation mirnas may promote
disease progression cancer pathogenesis. virus-encoded mirnas, exhibiting
unique molecular signatures functions, increasingly recognized as
contributors viral cancer pathogenesis. large segment existing
knowledge area generated characterization mirnas
encoded human gamma-herpesviruses, including kaposi's
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv). recent studies focusing kshv mirnas
have led better understanding viral mirna expression human tumors, the
identification novel pathologic check points regulated viral mirnas, and
new insights viral mirna interactions cellular ("human") mirnas.
elucidating functional effects inhibiting kshv mirnas also provided 
foundation translational efforts consideration clinical
applications. paper summarizes recent literature outlining mechanisms for
kshv mirna regulation cellular function cancer-associated pathogenesis, as
well implications interactions kshv human mirnas may
facilitate cancer progression. finally, insights offered clinical
feasibility targeting mirnas therapeutic approach viral cancers.
