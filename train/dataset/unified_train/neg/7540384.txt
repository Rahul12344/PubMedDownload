a series 23 1-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]-6-(phenylthio)thymine derivatives that
were highly potent inhibitors wild-type human immunodeficiency virus type 1
strain iiib (hiv-1/iiib) replication cem cells evaluated panel 
of hiv-1 mutant strains containing replacement leucine isoleucine at
position 100 (100-leu-->ile), 103-lys-->asn, 106-val-->ala, 138-glu-->lys,
181-tyr-->cys, 181-tyr-->ile, 188-tyr-->his reverse transcriptase
(rt). different structure-antiviral activity relationship found, depending 
on nature mutated amino acid hiv-1 rt. results show that
5-ethyl-1-ethoxymethyl-6-(3,5-dimethylbenzyl)uracil,
5-ethyl-1-ethoxymethyl-6-(3,5-dimethylphenylthio)uracil, and
5-ethyl-1-ethoxymethyl-6-(3,5-dimethylphenylthio)-2-thiouracil remain active
against majority viruses containing single mutations confer
resistance nonnucleoside rt inhibitors.
