background: novel influenza pandemic virus (h1n1pdm) caused considerable
morbidity mortality worldwide 2009. aim present study to
evaluate clinical course, duration viral shedding, h1n1pdm evolution and
emergence antiviral resistance hospitalized cancer patients severe
h1n1pdm infections winter 2009 brazil.
methods: performed prospective single-center cohort study cancer center
in rio de janeiro, brazil. hospitalized patients cancer confirmed
diagnosis influenza h1n1pdm evaluated. main outcome measures in
this study in-hospital mortality, duration viral shedding, viral
persistence functional molecular analyses h1n1pdm susceptibility 
to oseltamivir.
results: total 44 hospitalized patients suspected influenza-like
illness screened. total 24 diagnosed h1n1pdm infections. the
overall hospital mortality cohort 21%. thirteen (54%) patients
required intensive care. median age studied cohort 14.5 years
(3-69 years). eighteen (75%) patients received chemotherapy previous
month, 14 neutropenic onset influenza. total 10 patients 
were evaluated duration viral shedding, 5 (50%) displayed
prolonged viral shedding (median 23, range=11-63 days); however, not
associated emergence resistant h1n1pdm virus. viral evolution was
observed sequentially collected samples.
conclusions: prolonged influenza h1n1pdm shedding observed cancer
patients. however, oseltamivir resistance detected. taken together, our
data suggest severely ill cancer patients may constitute pandemic virus
reservoir major implications viral propagation.
