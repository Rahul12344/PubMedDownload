an informative, simple instrument needed, rapid easily updated strategy 
for identification insect-resistant genetically modified (gm) rice has
been described. strategy based parallel series loop-mediated
isothermal amplification (lamp) reactions targeting rice endogenous gene
sucrose phosphate synthase (sps), top two frequently used genetic
elements (agrobacterium tumefaciens nopaline synthase terminator (nos) and
cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter (camv35s)), insect-resistant
specific gene (cry1ac) detected visually phosphate ion (pi)-induced
coloration reaction. logical judgment visible readouts been
obtained, three popular insect-resistant gm rice events china be
successfully identified within 35 min, using either microwell strips paper
bases.
