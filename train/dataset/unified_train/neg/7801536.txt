in 1990 epidemic caused morbillivirus noticed among mediterranean
dolphins. rna extracted tissues dolphins cell cultures
infected corresponding dolphin morbillivirus isolate. nucleic acid
hybridization rna compared rna extracted animal tissue cell
cultures infected canine distemper virus (cdv), phocine distemper virus
(pdv) measles virus (mv). presence morbillivirus rna dolphin
tissue demonstrated. morbillivirus n, p, f gene mrnas detected 
the rna dolphin morbillivirus infected cells. mrna species seemed to
be approximately size corresponding mrna species cdv, pdv
and mv. results comparison demonstrated dolphin morbillivirus
is genetically different cdv, pdv mv. indication close
relationship dolphin isolate either cdv, pdv mv found.
