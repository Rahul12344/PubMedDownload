background: understanding differences hiv incidence among people living with
hepatitis c virus (hcv) help inform strategies prevent hiv infection. we
estimated time hiv diagnosis among hcv-positive individuals evaluated 
factors could affect hiv-infection risk population.
patients methods: british columbia hepatitis testers cohort includes 
bc residents (~1.5 million: third residents) tested hcv and
hiv 1990 2013 linked administrative health care mortality
data. hcv-positive hiv-negative individuals followed measure time
to hiv acquisition (positive test) identify factors associated hiv
acquisition. adjusted hrs (ahrs) estimated using cox proportional-hazard
regression.
results: 36,077 hcv-positive individuals, 2,169 (6%) acquired hiv 266,883
years follow-up (overall incidence 8.1 per 1,000 person years). overall
median (iqr) time hiv infection 3.87 (6.06) years. cox regression,
injection-drug use (ahr 1.47, 95% ci 1.33-1.63), hbv infection (ahr 1.34, 95% ci 
1.16-1.55), man sex men (ahr 2.78, 95% ci 2.14-3.61)
were associated higher risk hiv infection. opioid-substitution therapy
(ost) (ahr 0.59, 95% ci 0.52-0.67) mental health counseling (ahr 0.48, 95% ci
0.43-0.53) associated lower risk hiv infection.
conclusion: injection-drug use, hbv coinfection, man sex with
men associated increased hiv risk engagement ost mental
health counseling associated reduced hiv risk among hcv-positive
individuals. improving access ost mental health services could prevent
transmission hiv blood-borne infections, especially settings
where access limited.
