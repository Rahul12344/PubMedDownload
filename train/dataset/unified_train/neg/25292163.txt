by restoring immunological function modern antiretroviral treatment of
human immunodeficiency virus (hiv-1) infection considerably lowered the
incidence opportunistic infections. opposed classical manifestations
of hiv-induced immunosuppression incidence prevalence hiv-associated
neurocognitive disorders (hand) noticeably decreased hand continues
to relevant daily clinical practice. present, hand occurs earlier

become less frequent less prominent. prior advent cart cerebral
dysfunction could least partially explained viral load by
virus-associated histopathological findings. patients least partially 
successfully treated infections, relationship longer exists, a
plethora poorly understood immunological probably toxic phenomena are
under discussion.this consensus paper summarizes progress made last 12
