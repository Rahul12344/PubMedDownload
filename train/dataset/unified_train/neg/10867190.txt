a 50-kda protein binds viral particles solid-phase assays 
recognized anti-idiotypic antibodies made anti-viral glycoproteins
g1/g2 (anti-ids) proposed receptor candidate tomato spotted
wilt tospovirus (tswv) main thrips vector, frankliniella occidentalis
pergande (bandla et al., 1998. phytopathology 88, 98-104). show the
immunoprecipitation 50-kda protein anti-ids anti-g1/g2-tswv
conjugate - new immunoprecipitation method. addition, show anti-ids 
made anti-g1 (anti-idg1) block virus replication insect tissue
replication assay. results indicate (a) tswv-50-kda protein
interaction occurs solution, must vivo; (b) g1 viral
attachment protein; (c) 50-kda protein candidate host factor
essential tswv entry. results provide additional support role
of 50-kda thrips protein viral receptor. additionally experiments 
provide basis testing saturable binding represent important step
toward first cloning identification cellular receptor plant
virus.
