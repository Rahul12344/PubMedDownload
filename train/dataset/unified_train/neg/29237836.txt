parainfluenza virus 5 (piv5) belongs family paramyxoviridae, which
consists enveloped viruses nonsegmented negative-strand rna genome
encapsidated nucleoprotein (n). paramyxovirus replication regulated 
the phosphoprotein (p) protein-protein interactions n rna
polymerase (l). chaperone activity p essential maintain the
unassembled rna-free form n order prevent nonspecific rna binding and
premature n oligomerization. here, determined crystal structure of
unassembled piv5 n complex p peptide (n0p) derived n terminus 
of p (p50) 2.65 å. piv5 n0p consists two domains: n-terminal domain 
(ntd) c-terminal domain (ctd) separated hinge region. cleft the
hinge region rna-bound piv5 n previously shown rna binding site. 
the n0p structure shows p peptide binds ctd n extends
toward rna binding site inhibit n oligomerization and, hence, rna binding.
binding p peptide also keeps piv5 n open form. molecular dynamics
(md) analysis open closed forms n shows flexibility the
ctd preference n protein open conformation. the
gradual opening hinge region, release rna, also observed.
together, results advance knowledge conformational swapping n
