herpes simplex virus type (hsv-1) neurotropic virus capable of
infecting neurons, also microglia astrocytes establish
latent infection central nervous system (cns). investigated whether ifn
lambda (ifn-λ), newly identified member ifn family, ability to
inhibit hsv-1 infection primary human astrocytes neurons. astrocytes 
and neurons found highly susceptible hsv-1 infection. however, upon
ifn-λ treatment, hsv-1 replication astrocytes neurons was
significantly suppressed, evidenced reduced expression hsv-1 
dna proteins. ifn-λ-mediated action hsv-1 could partially
neutralized antibody ifn-λ receptor. investigation mechanisms showed
that ifn-λ treatment astrocytes neurons resulted upregulation of
endogenous ifn-α/β several ifn-stimulated genes (isgs). block ifn-α/β
receptor specific antibody could compromise ifn-λ actions hsv-1
inhibition isg induction. addition, ifn-λ treatment induced expression
of ifn regulatory factors (irfs) astrocytes neurons. furthermore, ifn-λ
treatment astrocytes neurons resulted suppression suppressor 
cytokine signaling 1 (socs-1), key negative regulator ifn pathway. these
data suggest ifn-λ possesses anti-hsv-1 function promoting type i
ifn-mediated innate antiviral immune response cns cells.
