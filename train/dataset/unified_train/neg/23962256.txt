lung cancer (lc) major cause death cancer number lc
patients increasing worldwide. study investigated therapeutic
potential gene delivery using suppressor cytokine signaling 1 (socs-1), 
endogenous inhibitor intracellular signaling pathways, treatment of
lc. examine antitumor effect socs-1 overexpression non-small-cell
lung cancer (nsclc) cells, nsclc cells (a549, lu65, pc9) infected with
adenovirus-expressing socs-1 vector. cell proliferation assay showed that
a549 lu65, pc9, sensitive socs-1 gene-mediated suppression of
cell growth. although jak inhibitor could also inhibit proliferation a549
and lu65 cells, socs-1 gene delivery appeared potent socs-1 could
suppress focal adhesion kinase epidermal growth factor receptor, well as
the jak/stat3 signaling pathway. enhanced phosphorylation p53 protein 
detected means phospho-kinase array socs-1 overexpressed a549 cells
compared control cells, whereas phosphorylation p53 observed 
jak inhibitor used. furthermore, treatment adenoviral vector adsocs-1 
in vivo significantly suppressed nsclc proliferation xenograft model. 
results suggest overexpression socs-1 gene effective antitumor
therapy suppressing jak/stat, focal adhesion kinase, epidermal growth 
factor receptor signaling pathways enhancing p53-mediated antitumor activity 
in nsclc.
