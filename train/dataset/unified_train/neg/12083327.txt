in study presence ifn-binding activity sera patients
with chronic viral hepatitis b c treated rifn-alpha2 screened a
radioimmune assay (ria) using radiolabeled rifn-alpha2. incidence anti-ifn 
activitywas compared hepatitis b virus (hbv) hepatitis c virus (hcv)
serum markers hepatitis b antigen (hbsag), hepatitis b e antigen (hbeag),
antibodies hbsag (anti-hbsag), antibodies hbeag (anti-hbeag),
seroconversion, hbv dna, hcv rna, serum soluble intracellular adhesion
molecule (sicam). injections (intramuscular) rifn-alpha2 caused anti-rifn
activity formation 8 (27.6%) 29 patients chronic active hepatitis b
(cah-b) 8 (30.8%) 26 patients chronic active hepatitis c (cah-c). 
the presence anti-rifn activity cah-b patients correlated frequently
with persistence hbsag, hbeag hbv-dna, absence often
accompanied anti-hbeag anti-hbsag seroconversion, respectively, and
hbv-dna negativity. two cah-c patients became hcv rna-negative anti-ifn
activity found. levels serum sicam-1 cah-b patients responding the
ifn treatment higher non-responders anti-ifn
activity present. anti-ifn activity may negatively influence effect
of ifn therapy cah-b cah-c patients early stages therapy. the
appearance anti-ifn activity end long-term ifn therapy does
not seem influence outcome therapy. sicam-1 may involved 
process cah-b reactivation ifn-triggered cytotoxicity ifn
therapy.
