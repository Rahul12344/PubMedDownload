intrinsic host susceptibility viral infections plays major role in
determining infection severity different individuals. human influenza virus
infections, multiple genetic association studies identified specific human
gene variants might contribute enhanced susceptibility resistance to
influenza. recent studies suggested, rs12252 t > c polymorphism the
interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 3 (ifitm3) gene might associated
with susceptibility severe influenza. however, studies reported
conflicting inconclusive results. resolve controversy, conducted 
systematic meta-analysis evaluate role ifitm3 rs12252 polymorphism 
in influenza susceptibility severity, including twelve studies published
before february 19, 2018 total 16,263 subjects (1836 influenza cases and
14,427 controls). odds ratios (or) 95% confidence intervals used to
assess strength association. results indicated increased risk of
both severe mild influenza subjects carrying ifitm3 rs12252
polymorphism allele contrast c vs. t: (severe) = 1.69, 95%
ci = 1.23-2.33, p = 0.001, (mild) = 1.46, 95% ci = 1.13-1.87, p = 0.004.
similar results obtained homozygote comparison dominant model.
stratified analyses ethnicity revealed increased risk severe influenza in
both white east asian populations, significant association mild 
influenza found white population. overall, meta-analysis
suggests significant association ifitm3 rs12252 polymorphism and
the risk influenza white east asian populations.
