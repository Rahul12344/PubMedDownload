to examine effects pseudorabies virus (prv) immune cells, investigated
the ability prv infect replicate porcine peripheral blood leukocytes
(pbls). flow cytometric analysis revealed leukopenia challenge, loss
of 40% circulating monocytes 50% circulating lymphocytes. virus was
isolated pbls challenged pigs cocultivation porcine kidney cells,
indicating pbls infected vivo. presence virus pbls coincided
with appearance neurological signs 1 2 days prior death. lymphocytes
stimulated mitogens infected vitro sustained low-level infection
(10(5) median tissue culture infective dose per 2 x 10(6) cells). vivo
challenge perturbed cd4/cd8 ratio circulating lymphocytes. survival was
associated low cd4/cd8 ratios high levels cd8+ cells. mortality was
associated low levels cd8+ cells cd4/cd8 ratios greater one. a
maturational deficiency cd8+ cells found young pigs. results
support mechanism prv immunosuppression direct infection of
circulating lymphocytes, cd8+ lymphocytes important survival.
