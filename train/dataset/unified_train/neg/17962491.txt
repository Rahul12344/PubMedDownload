efficient inhibition hiv infection life cycle stages viral
infection, reverse transcription, post-translational processing been
extensively studied. however, efficient inhibition hiv assembly budding
has reported. here, report dendritic cell-specific intercellular
adhesion molecule-3 (icam-3) -grabbing nonintegrin (dc-sign) related
protein, dc-signr, effectively block hiv budding infected cells.
cotransfection dc-sign dc-signr hiv demonstrated 95-99.5% inhibition
of viral production host cells. dc-sign dc-signr also effectively
inhibit 90-95% hiv generation infected cells. dc-sign efficiently reduces
the amount gp120 present cell plasma membrane, completely strips
off gp120 virions produced host cells, suggesting blockage
of hiv budding due internalization gp120 dc-sign.
