purification properties single strand dna-binding endo-exonuclease of
neurospora crassa.

chow ty, fraser mj.

single strand dna-binding endo-exonucleases purified mitochondria, vacuoles,
or mixture organelles high specific single strand dnase
activity (910 mumol nucleotides/min/mg), contained polypeptide of
mr = 31,000-33,000 found active sodium dodecyl sulfate-dna-gel
electrophoresis. properties three preparations identical all
respects tested. enzyme showed distributive endonuclease activity single
strand dna, processive exonuclease activity double strand dna. the
former case, 5'-phosphoryl-terminated fragments released early times,
while latter case, short 5'-oligonucleotides (n = 2-4) released. both
activities dependent mg2+ (or mn2+), different extents. 0.1 mm 
mg2+, superhelical bacteriophage phi x174 (replicative form (rf ii) dna and, at
converted relaxed circular (rf ii) dna and, higher enzyme concentrations,
to unit length linear (rf iii) dna. 10 mm mg2+, conversions took
place rapidly, rf iii dna formed degraded pieces shorter
than unit length. low enzyme concentrations, long single strand tails and
gaps detected bacteriophage t7 linear double strand dna molecules.
