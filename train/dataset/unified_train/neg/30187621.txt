selecting appropriate screening method interval early detection
of hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection low-resourced haemodialysis settings a
challenge. challenge occurs patients classified hcv-rna positive 
but negative hcv-core antigen (hcv-coreag), anti-hcv genotyping tests. 
aim clarify inconsistency hcv-rna, hcv-coreag, anti-hcv hcv
genotyping tests haemodialysis patients determine reliability of
hcv-coreag routine two-monthly screening strategy. haemodialysis patients
were tested every 2 months 2012 2014 largest district
haemodialysis unit ho chi minh city, vietnam, aminotransferases, anti-hcv 
antibodies, hcv-coreag, hcv-rna hcv genotype. hcv-coreag anti-hcv results
were tested hcv-rna sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive
value (ppv), negative predictive value (npv). 201 patients participated in
the study. hcv-coreag test performed better anti-hcv test for
sensitivity (100% vs 31%), npv (100% vs 90%) accuracy (100% vs 90%). the
hcv-coreag anti-hcv tests performed differently specificity (100% 
98%, respectively) ppv (100% 73%, respectively). kappa values for
hcv-coreag anti-hcv tests 1 0.39, respectively. early detection of
hcv purpose infection prevention requires high level sensitivity 
and hcv-coreag performed better chronic haemodialysis population a
two-monthly screening method routine anti-hcv testing. hcv-coreag test is
less labour-intensive higher level accuracy patients low viral 
loads making cost effective low-resourced settings. repeating genotyping
may required hcv-coreag positive patients low viral load.
