membrane fusion essential several cellular processes existence of
eukaryotic cells cellular trafficking, compartmentalization,
intercellular communication, sexual reproduction, cell division, endo- and
exocytosis. membrane fusion proceeds model membranes well biological
membranes rearrangement lipids. stalk hypothesis provides a
picture general nature lipid rearrangement based mechanical
properties phase behavior water-lipid mesomorphic systems. spite of
extensive research exploring mechanism membrane fusion, clear
molecular understanding intermediate pore formation lacking. in
addition, mechanism proteins peptides reduce activation
energy stalk pore formation yet clear though several
propositions catalyze membrane fusion. review, have
discussed various putative functions fusion peptides they
reduce activation barrier thus promote membrane fusion. careful analysis of
the discussed effects fusion peptides membranes might open new
possibilities better understanding membrane fusion mechanism.
