sendai virus-induced hemolysis: reduction heterogeneity erythrocyte lipid
bilayer fluidity.

lyles ds, landsberger fr.

hemolysis human chicken erythrocytes sendai virus causes change the
structure erythrocyte membrane lipid bilayer detected spin 
label electron spin resonance. intact erythrocyte, phosphatidylcholine
derivative spin label exists rigid environment corresponding
phosphatidylethanolamine label. virus-induced hemolysis tends abolish this
difference fluidity, i.e., region phosphatidylcholine spin label
becomes fluid phosphatidylethanolamine spin label becomes
more rigid. fatty acid derivative spin labels, may detect "average"
environment, show change fluidity. fluidity change detected at
several different positions fatty acyl chain phosphatidylcholine
spin label. sendai virions grown madin-darby bovine kidney (mdbk) cells or
grown eggs harvested early, lack hemolytic activity, cause no
significant change bilayer structure. hemolytic activity ability to
alter erythrocyte bilayer fluidity activated mdbk-grown sendai virions 
by trypsin treatment vitro early-harvest egg-grown sendai virions by
freezing thawing. erythrocyte ghosts prepared osmotic hemolysis and
resealed treatment mg2+ elevated ionic strength exhibit difference
in fluidity phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine spin labels,
although less observed whole cells. incubation resealed ghosts
with sendai virus abolishes difference fluidity. unsealed ghosts have
been extensively washed show heterogeneity membrane bilayer fluidity, and
incubation sendai virus causes fluidity change. virus-induced
hemolysis measured hemoglobin release sensitive inhibition by
ca2+ associated fluidity change bilayer.
