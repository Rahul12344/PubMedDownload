natural killer (nk) cells become activated viral infection response 
cytokines engagement nk cell activating receptors. however, identity
of cells sensing viral particles mediating nk cell activation been
defined. here, show local administration modified vaccinia virus
ankara vaccine mice results accumulation nk cells subcapsular
area draining lymph node activation, process strictly 
dependent type ifn signaling. nk cells located subcapsular area
exhibited reduced motility found associated cd169(+)-positive
subcapsular sinus (scs) macrophages collagen fibers. moreover, depletion of
scs macrophages using clodronate liposomes abolished nk cell accumulation and
activation. results identify scs macrophages primary mediators nk cell 
activation response lymph-borne viral particles suggesting act as
early sensors local infection delivery viral-based vaccines.
