approximately 37 million people worldwide infected human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv). one highly significant complication hiv
infection development hiv-associated neurocognitive disorders (hand) in
15-55% people living hiv (plwh), persists even antiretroviral
therapy (art) era. entry hiv central nervous system (cns) occurs 
within 4-8 days peripheral infection. establishes viral reservoirs
that may persist even presence art. cns, hiv infects
resident macrophages, microglia, low levels, astrocytes. response to
chronic infection cell activation within cns, viral proteins,
inflammatory mediators, host viral neurotoxic factors produced over
extended periods time result neuronal injury loss, cognitive deficits
and hand. substance abuse common comorbidity plwh shown to
increase neuroinflammation cognitive disorders. additionally, been
associated poor art adherence, increased viral load cerebrospinal
fluid (csf), may also contribute increased neuroinflammation neuronal
injury. studies examined mechanisms contribute neuroinflammation and
neuronal damage plwh, substances abuse exacerbate effects.
this review focus substances abuse, emphasis on
methamphetamine (meth), cocaine, opioids, impact blood brain barrier (bbb)
integrity transmigration hiv-infected uninfected monocytes across 
bbb, well effects monocytes/macrophages, microglia, astrocytes
within cns. also address substances abuse may contribute
to hiv-mediated neuropathogenesis context suppressive art.
additionally, review effects extracellular dopamine, a
neurotransmitter increased cns substances abuse, hiv
neuropathogenesis may contribute neuroinflammation, neuronal
insult, hand plwh active substance use. lastly, discuss 
potential therapies limit cns inflammation damage hiv-infected
substance abusers.
