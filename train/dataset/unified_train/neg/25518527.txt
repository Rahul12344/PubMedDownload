several novel compounds found potent inhibitors hcv (jfh-1
isolate) infection vitro. human serum significantly reduce antiviral
activity lead compound, avr560 (< 4-fold). immunohistochemistry
studies huh7 cell line, infectable hcv (jfh-1 strain),
demonstrated avr560 inhibited early steps viral infection blocked
the spread hcv infection tissue culture. cytotoxicity huh7 and
vero-76 cell lines mild. avr560 proved specific hcv inhibitor and
exhibited activity flaviviruses yellow fever (strain
17d), west nile (strain ny99), dengue (new guinea type 2) vitro
infection experiments. avr560 also inhibit tested human cyp450
isozymes (3a4, 1a2, 2c19 2d6). pharmacokinetic studies mice, rats
and dogs, favorable pharmacokinetic profiles good oral bioavailability were
observed av560. pre-clinical studies novel hcv inhibitor
are progress.
