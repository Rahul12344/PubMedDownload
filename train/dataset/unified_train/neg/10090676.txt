canine distemper virus (cdv) causes multifocal demyelinating disease dogs.
it previously shown initial demyelinating lesions directly virus
induced since correlation occurrence demyelination cdv
replication white matter cells observed. course infection
oligodendrocytes undergo distinct morphological alterations, partly due a
restricted cdv infection cells, eventually disappear the
lesions. phenomenon described vivo well vitro. however,
the reason morphological alterations following oligodendroglial
depletion remained unclear. since virus infection induce cell death, was
investigated whether apoptosis necrosis plays role pathogenesis of
demyelination canine distemper. brain tissue sections dogs acute 
distemper apoptotic cells detected within demyelinating lesions
using morphological biochemical cell death criteria. chronic distemper,
apoptotic cells - presumably inflammatory cells - seen within the
perivascular cuffs. vivo findings correlated vitro
situation using cdv-infected primary dog brain cell cultures well vero
cells. infection culture-adapted cdv lead massive necrosis to
apoptosis. infection virulent cdv neither apoptosis necrosis a
predominant feature either culture system. findings suggest that
virus-induced demyelination canine distemper direct consequence 
apoptosis necrosis. speculated another mechanism must be
responsible observed morphological alterations oligodendrocytes,
ultimately leading demyelination.
