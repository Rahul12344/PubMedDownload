phagocytosis, secondary function retinal pigment epithelial (rpe) cells
essential sight, significantly decreased, measured latex beads, 
during persistent rubella virus (rv) infection human cultured rpe cells. a
target rv vivo, rpe cells infected rv (rpe/rv) ingested fewer
fluorescent microspheres (26%) uninfected rpe cells (68%) (p < 0.001),
as measured flow cytometry. rpe/rv cells, characteristic rpe monolayer
appearance normal growth subculturing 6 months, persistent rv
infection shown specific rv antigen immunofluorescence, presence of
the rv genome rpe/rv cell messenger rna, recovery cell-free rv after
cocultivation vero cells. adhesion latex beads apical cell
surfaces rpe/rv uninfected rpe cells appeared similar, imaged by
scanning electron microscopy. cytoskeletal actin, component phagocytosis 
rpe, appeared altered 60 75% rpe/rv cells antiactin
immunofluorescence staining, previously described rv-infected cells, 
but role disturbed phagocytosis latex beads determined.
