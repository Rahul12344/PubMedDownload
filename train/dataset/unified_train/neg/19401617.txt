the fragment membrane protein gene high conservation and
specificity porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) was
chosen target region, according six special primers were
designed successfully. reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (rt-lamp) applied detect prrsv incubation 65
degrees 45 min ladder-like pattern bands 182 bp 
agarose gel, product specificity confirmed rsai. result of
rt-lamp could also visualized directly naked eye adding the
intercalating dye picogreen. rt-lamp identified detect prrsv 
in viruses tested, demonstrated high specificity. using various 
sample dilutions templates, sensitivity rt-lamp found be
100-fold higher rt-pcr could comparable fluorescence
quantitative rt-pcr. comparison obtained rt-lamp pcr assays
using 20 clinical samples. finally, rapid, convenient reliable prrsv
detection system developed using rt-lamp.
