since may 2006, highly pathogenic porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome
virus (prrsv), causes continuous high fever high proportion deaths
in vaccinated pigs ages, emerged prevailed mainland china. huge
efforts made towards development efficient vaccine against
the highly pathogenic prrsv. although orf5-encoded gp5 important 
immunogenic protein, accumulating evidences demonstrated incomplete
protection conferred gp5-based vaccines. inability induce robust
protective immunity postulated associated presence a
non-neutralizing decoy epitope heavy glycosylation close its
neutralizing epitope. study, synthetic orf5 gene (synorf5) was
engineered codon usage optimized mammalian cell expression based 
the native orf5 gene highly pathogenic prrsv strain wuh3. additional
modifications, i.e., inserting pan dr t-helper cell epitope (padre) the
neutralizing epitope non-neutralizing decoy epitope, mutating four
potential n-glycosylation sites (n30, n34, n35 n51) also included the
synthetic orf5 gene. immunogenicity synorf5-encoded gp5 evaluated 
by dna vaccination mice piglets. results showed significantly
enhanced gp5-specific elisa antibody, prrsv-specific neutralizing antibody,
ifn-gamma level, well lymphocyte proliferation response, could induced
in mice piglets immunized dna construct encoding modified gp5 than
those received dna vaccine expressing native gp5. enhanced immunogenicity
of modified gp5 useful facilitate development efficient
vaccines highly pathogenic prrsv future.
