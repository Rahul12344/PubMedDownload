we describe clinical, radiologic, surgical, pathologic findings a
29-year-old peruvian human immunodeficiency virus-infected man primary
parasellar meningeal leiomyosarcoma involving left lesser esphenoidal wing
and cavernous sinus. period 13 months, developed headache,
vomiting, insomnia, diplopia. magnetic resonance imaging revealed left
parasellar extra-axial mass isointense t1, hypointense t2, and
gadolinium-enhanced. patient underwent subtotal resection tumor. the
neoplasm composed spindle cells smooth-muscle features. showed
moderate atypia, inconspicuous nucleoli, scanty mitosis. tumor necrosis
was detected. immunohistochemistry revealed strong positivity vimentin,
desmin, smooth-muscle alpha-actin. low-grade leiomyosarcoma diagnosed. 
the situ hybridization showed positive nuclear reactivity epstein-barr
virus-encoded rna. immunohistochemistry negative epstein-barr virus
latent membrane protein 1. main differential diagnosis primary meningeal
smooth-muscle tumors includes meningioma peripheral nerve sheath tumors.
epstein-barr virus demonstrated smooth-muscle tumors associated 
with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids). primary meningeal smooth-muscle 
tumors, exceedingly rare neoplasms, remarkably affect young adults aids.
comparatively, aids-related visceral (nonmeningeal) smooth-muscle tumors
have reported children. permissiveness tumorigenesis associated
with epstein-barr virus may depend age human immunodeficiency virus
infection.
