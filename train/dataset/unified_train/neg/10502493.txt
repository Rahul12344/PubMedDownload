the objectives study investigate role dna vaccines the
generation immune response elicited individually encoded
proteins prrsv. genomic regions encoding orf 4, 5, 6 7 prrs
virus vaccine strain cloned mammalian expression vector pc dna 3.1 
(+). inoculations recombinant plasmids resulted detection prrs
virus-specific antibodies 71 per cent immunized animals elisa, virus
neutralization and/or western blotting assays. addition, cellular immune
responses detected 86 per cent immunized pigs interferon gamma 
assay and/or proliferation assay. pigs control group detectable
immune response prrs virus. results obtained demonstrated dna
immunization prrs virus results production humoral and
cell mediated immune responses pigs. results also indicate that
neutralization epitopes prrs virus present viral envelope
glycoproteins encoded orf 4 orf 5.
