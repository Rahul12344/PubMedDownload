objective: 1) verify validity new line probe assay hepatitis c
virus (hcv) genotyping 2) determine distribution hcv genotypes the
association hcv genotype clinical variables patients chronic 
hepatitis c seen tertiary referral centers united states.
design: retrospective cross-sectional analysis.
patients: 438 patients chronic hepatitis c 10 tertiary referral
centers.
measurements: validity line probe assay first verified a
panel serum specimens previously characterized six different 
hcv genotyping methods. specimens 438 patients genotyped using
this line probe assay. associations hcv genotype clinical
variables examined using analysis variance. pairwise testing used
when f test showed statistically significant difference. nonparametric
alternatives used variables normality could assumed.
results: line probe assay quick reproducible, showed good
concordance tests. sample, proportions patients hcv
types 1, 2, 3, 4 71.5%, 13.5%, 5.5%, 1.1%, respectively. subtypes 1a
and 1b seen approximately equal proportions patients hcv type 1. 
mixed infection detected 3.7% specimens, 4.8% specimens either
had negative results polymerase chain reaction could typed. higher
proportion patients hcv type 1 patients hcv-type 1 had
acquired hcv transfusion blood products (50% compared 25%; p <
0.001). patients hcv type 1 also longer estimated duration of
infection compared patients hcv type 3 (p = 0.004) type 4 (p =
0.049). disease activity differ among patients infected hcv types 1,
2, 3. levels viremia similar patients hcv types 1, 2, 3,
but patients hcv type 4 lower level viremia patients 
hcv type 1 (p = 0.047).
conclusions: line probe assay used patients chronic hcv
infection united states. patients chronic hepatitis c referred 
tertiary centers united states, type 1 common hcv genotype.
disease activity viremia levels differ among patients chronically
infected hcv types 1, 2, 3.
