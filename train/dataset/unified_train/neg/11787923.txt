two hundred women abnormal pap smears and/or vulvar symptoms 30 with
normal pap smears investigated determine association symptoms
and (i) human papilloma virus infection vulva, (ii) spongiotic
tissue reaction spongiotic dermatitis vulva. vulvar
colposcopy biopsy human papilloma virus infection diagnosed by
histopathology situ hybridisation technique. hpv infection present 
biopsies 48% asymptomatic women 33% symptoms (p = 0.13) hpv
dna 37% asymptomatic women 31% symptoms (p = 0.72). spongiotic
tissue reaction diagnosed 53.5% asymptomatic women compared 74% of
symptomatic women (p = 0.007). study suggests vulvar symptoms not
clinical manifestations hpv infection, may caused dermatitis rather 
than hpv infection per se.
