history clinical findings: 49-year-old patient, hobby hunter, fell ill
acutely joint limb pain, abdominal pain, nausea subfebrile
temperatures. hospitalization, patient bad general condition,
showing ascites lid edema, acute renal failure diagnosed.
investigations: laboratory tests revealed marked thrombocytopenia (15,000/ml),
leucocytosis, elevated levels creatinine, blood urea nitrogen liver
enzymes, respectively. blood gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis. chest x-ray 
showed interstitial fluid accumulation, abdominal ultrasound disclosed ascites
and enlarged kidneys acute renal failure. immunologic tests verified the
diagnosis acute hantavirus infection, use specific molecular biology 
techniques previously unknown virus strain identified.
treatment course: hantavirus infections western europe usually show a
benign course. however, present case, acute progressive pulmonary failure 
developed despite effective dialysis mechanical ventilation necessary
for several weeks. dialysis carried 17 days. complication 
a severe ulcero-destructive tracheobronchitis developed, caused aspergillus
fumigatus. several weeks, renal pulmonary function returned to
normal.
conclusion: hantavirus infections may lead severe complicated courses also
in western europe. use new immunologic molecular biology techniques a
specific diagnosis possible.
