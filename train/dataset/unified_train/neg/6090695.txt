pppa2'p5a' blocks vesicular stomatitis virus replication intact cells.

alarcon b, bugany h, carrasco l.

pppa2'p5'a blocked production infectious vesicular stomatitis virus in
hela cells. compound present beginning infection, a
selective inhibitory effect observed viral protein synthesis. thus,
cellular translation affected even 10 h incubation this
compound, bulk viral proteins synthesized. however, this
effect observed atp, gtp, core a2'p5'a. step blocked by
pppa2'p5'a located early virus infection, adsorption, entry, and
virus uncoating seemed unaffected compound. analysis the
antiviral spectrum pppa2'p5'a indicated active poliovirus, 
encephalomyocarditis virus, semliki forest virus shows effect 
herpes simplex virus type 1 adenovirus type 5.
