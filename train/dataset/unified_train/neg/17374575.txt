background: combined hepatocellular carcinoma cholangiocarcinoma (chcc-cc) is
a rare subtype primary liver cancer, clinicopathological features of
chcc-cc seldom reported detail. study undertaken explore
the diagnosis clinicopathological characteristics chcc-cc comparison
with hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) cholangiocarcinoma (cc), respectively.
methods: clinical data 15 patients chcc-cc, 132 patients hcc
and 44 patients cc undergone hepatic resection analyzed
retrospectively. clinicopathological characteristics chcc-cc, hcc cc 
as hepatitis b viral infection, serum hepatitis c virus (hcv) antibody, serum
alpha-fetoprotein (afp) level, cirrhosis, vascular invasion, lymph node
metastasis, surgical procedure adjuvant treatment also analyzed. follow 
up carried patients, 1-, 3-, 5-year survival rates
were calculated.
results: two patients chcc-cc correctly diagnosed enhanced ct before
operation, 13 patients diagnosed histology and
immunohistochemistry operation. radical (8/15) conservative hepatectomy
(7/15) chcc-cc similar hcc cc (p>0.05). pathologically
chcc-cc showed significantly vascular invasion lymph node metastasis
than hcc (p<0.05), similarity cc (p>0.05). hepatitis b viral infection, 
serum hcv antibody, cirrhosis, serum afp level chcc-cc patients were
similar hcc patients (p>0.05) different cc patients
(p<0.05). cumulative 1-, 3-, 5-year survival rates patients with
chcc-cc poorer patients hcc cc (p<0.05).
conclusions: patients chcc-cc seldom diagnosed operation. the
progression chcc-cc rapid hcc cc. survival rate of
patients chcc-cc hepatic resection poorer patients
with hcc cc.
