fifty-five rabies virus isolates originating different regions former
soviet union (fsu) compared isolates originating eurasia, africa, 
and north america according complete partial nucleoprotein (n) gene
sequences. fsu isolates formed five distinct groups. group represented
viruses originating arctic, similar viruses alaska
and canada. group b consisted "arctic-like" viruses, originating the
south east siberia far east. group c consisted viruses circulating 
in steppe forest-steppe territories european part russia to
tuva kazakhstan. three phylogenetic groups clearly different
from european cluster. viruses group circulate near western border
of russia. phylogenetic position intermediate group c the
european cluster. group e consisted viruses originating northwestern 
part russia comprised "northeastern europe" group described earlier from
the baltic region. according surveillance data, specific host defined
clearly group (arctic fox; alopex lagopus) far eastern
part group b distribution area (raccoon dog; nyctereutes procyonoides).
for territories rabies virus variants, red fox (vulpes vulpes) is
the main virus reservoir. however, steppe fox (vulpes corsac), wolf (canis
lupus), raccoon dog also involved virus circulation, depending host
population density. molecular data, joined surveillance information,
demonstrate current fox rabies epizootic territory fsu
developed independently central western europe. evidence positive
selection found n genes isolates. glycoprotein gene,
evidence positive selection strongly suggested codons 156, 160, and
183. sites, link amino acid substitutions phylogenetic
