hiv-1 infection characterized continuous viral replication throughout the
illness controlled extent effective treatment. early
during primary infection, latent reservoirs virus remains hidden in
metabolically inert cells established. reservoirs responsible a
low-rate viral replication observed even effective treatment
and major obstacle complete eradication infection. this
low-rate viral replication also comes anatomical sites drug
penetration limited suboptimal drug concentration achieved. 
further understanding mechanisms underlying hiv-1 latency primary
importance develop new strategies ensure complete destruction of
reservoirs and, therefore, eradication infection.
