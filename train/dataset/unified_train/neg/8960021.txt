objective: determine immunohistochemically expression mutant p53
phosphoprotein hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) possible relationship to
several etiologic factors.
study design: study group consisted 62 samples hcc, grades 2, 3 4, 
obtained fine needle aspiration cytology. associated risk factors detected
in patients follows: ethanol abuse, ethanol abuse plus hepatitis b 
virus (hbv) hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection, hbv infection, hcv infection,
non-a/ non-b hepatitis, hemochromatosis obesity.
results: mutant p53 expression identified 22% hcc seemed to
correlate tumor grade. positive immunostaining frequently associated
with history alcohol abuse (42%) also viral infection (hbv, 21%;
hcv, 7%; non-a/non-b hepatitis, 7%).
conclusion: mutant p53 seems intervene progress hcc various 
grades increasing malignancy. association found alcohol intake 
and mutant p53 expression may deserve investigation.
