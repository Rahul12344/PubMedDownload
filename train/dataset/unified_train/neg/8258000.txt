objective: evaluate risk factors natural history spontaneous
pneumothorax patients human immunodeficiency virus infection (hiv).
methods: studied eight hiv infected patients spontaneous pneumothorax.
variables assessed included sex, age, risk factor hiv infection, use of
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis, total cd4 positive lymphocyte
count, previous history pneumocystis carinii pneumonia pulmonary
tuberculosis, chest x-ray film, presence simultaneous opportunistic infection,
partial pressure oxygen arterial blood gas determination clinical
outcome.
results: patients predominantly male intravenous drug abusers. mean 
age 28 years (range: 21-44). five patients acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome, 2 oral candidiasis one asymptomatic hiv infection. three had
previously pneumocystis carinii pneumonia six concurrent opportunistic 
infection. one receiving aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis. the
pneumothorax bilateral two cases. chest tube evacuation required in
seven, six patients died. two patients without opportunistic infection
were discharged.
conclusions: conclude spontaneous pneumothorax serious problem 
high mortality patients advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection. 
previous active pneumocystis carinii pneumonia appear risk factor 
developing pneumothorax. seems independent aerosolized pentamidine
use.
