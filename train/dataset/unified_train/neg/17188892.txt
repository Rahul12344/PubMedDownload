scanning calorimetry combined cryo-electron microscopy affords powerful
approach investigating hierarchical interactions multi-protein complexes.
calorimetry detect temperatures certain interactions are
disrupted cryo-em reveal accompanying structural changes. the
procapsid bacteriophage hk97 (prohead i) 450a-diameter shell composed 
60 hexamers 12 pentamers gp5, organized icosahedral symmetry. gp5
consists n-terminal delta-domain (11kda) gp5* (31 kda): gp5* forms the
contiguous shell clusters delta-domains extend inwards. neutral 
ph, prohead exhibits endothermic transition 53 degrees c enthalpy
change 14 kcal/mole (of gp5 monomer). show transition is
reversible. capture structural expression, incubated prohead 60
degrees c followed rapid freezing and, cryo-em, observed capsid species
10% larger prohead i. 11a resolution, visible changes confined the
gp5 hexamers. delta-domain clusters disappeared presumably
disordered, either unfolding dispersal. gp5* hexamer rings thinned 
and flattened assume conformation observed expansion intermediate 
i, transition state normal, proteolysis-induced, maturation pathway. 
infer that, ambient temperatures, hexamer delta-domains restrain their
gp5* rings switching lower free energy, ei-i-like, state; 53
degrees, restraint overcome. pentamers, hand, more
stably anchored resist thermal perturbation.
