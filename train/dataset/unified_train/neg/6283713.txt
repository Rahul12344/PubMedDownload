vesicular exanthema swine san miguel sea lion virus: experimental and
field studies otarid seals, feeding trials swine.

gelberg hb, dieterich ra, lewis rm.

the naturally occurring disease caused san miguel sea lion virus fur seals 
was characterized small fluid-filled vesicles 1 25 mm diameter the
nonhaired portions flippers. early epithelial lesions contained multifocal
sites cell lysis. resultant microvesicles enlarged coalesced, forming 
grossly visible macrovesicles. mature vesicles progressed involve layers
of epithelium involve underlying dermis. intradermal
inoculation vesicular exanthema swine virus type a48 san miguel sea lion
virus type 2 otarid (fur) seal pups caused plaque-like lesions around
inoculated coronary bands. swellings regressed without rupture 96 hours 
postinoculation. one seal inoculated san miguel sea lion virus linear 
lingual erosion ten days postinoculation. virus isolated site
and two uninoculated sites, tonsil testicle. contact controls showed
no evidence infection. virus isolated low titers sites of
inoculation draining lymph nodes seals infected vesicular exanthema
of swine virus. virus recovered easily, higher titers, 
tissues, seals infected san miguel sea lion virus. inoculated seals
tested four ten days seroconverted. feeding swine seal tissues 
inoculation experiments resulted seroconversion swine fed
tissues seals infected vesicular exanthema swine virus in
those fed tissues seals infected san miguel sea lion virus.
