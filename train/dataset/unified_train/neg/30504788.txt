chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection poses serious global public health
burden. despite recent development effective treatments large
unmet need prophylactic vaccine. further, antiviral resistance might
compromise treatment efficiency future. hcv cell culture systems are
typically based huh7 derived hepatoma cell lines cultured monolayers.
however, efficient high cell density culture systems high-yield hcv
production studies antivirals lacking. established system based
on huh7.5 cells cultured hollow fiber bioreactor presence absence 
of bovine serum. using adapted chimeric genotype 5a virus, achieved peak
hcv infectivity rna titers 7.6 log10 ffu/ml 10.4 log10 iu/ml,
respectively. bioreactor derived hcv showed high genetic stability, well as
buoyant density, sensitivity neutralizing antibodies ar3a ar4a, and
dependency hcv co-receptors cd81 sr-bi comparable hcv produced 
in monolayer cell cultures. using bioreactor platform, treatment the
ns5a inhibitor daclatasvir resulted hcv escape mediated ns5a resistance
substitution y93h. conclusion, established efficient high cell density
hcv culture system implications studies antivirals vaccine
development.
