the epstein-barr virus thwarts immune surveillance gly-ala repeat (gar)
within viral epstein-barr virus-encoded nuclear antigen 1 protein. gar
inhibits proteasome processing, early step antigen peptide presentation,
but mechanism proteasome inhibition unclear. embedding gar
within ornithine decarboxylase, natural proteasome substrate not
require ubiquitin conjugation, demonstrate inhibition purified
system, excluding involvement ubiquitin conjugation proteins extraneous 
to substrate proteasome. show gar acts stop-transfer
signal proteasome substrate processing, resulting vivo partial
proteolysis halts short gar. similarly, introducing gar into
green fluorescent protein destabilized ornithine decarboxylase degradation
domain also stops progress proteolysis, leading accumulation of
partial degradation products. postulate atp motor proteasome
slips encounters gar, impeding insertion and, way,
halting degradation.
