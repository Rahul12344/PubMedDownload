background: chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection remains major global
health issue, prognosis patients hbv-associated fulminant hepatic
failure extremely poor. application antiviral therapies led to
significant improvements patient outcomes. article aimed review the
current strategies antiviral treatment hbv-associated fulminant hepatic
failure.
data sources: literature search conducted using pubmed related
subjects. part data recent work authors'
laboratory.
results: hepatitis b immunoglobulin prevention recurrent hbv infection
after orthotopic liver transplantation (olt) proven effective. however, 
its cost high, significant side effects found induce viral
mutations. lamivudine potent suppression hbv replication an
excellent safety profile decompensated cirrhotic patients, major
drawback high rate drug-resistance. adefovir effective for
lamivudine-resistance strains post-olt situation, drug-resistance 
rate relatively low. combination therapies hepatitis b immunoglobulin 
combined lamivudine lamivudine combined adefovir widely
adopted prophylaxis hbv recurrence infection olt. entecavir,
telbivudine, tenofovir newer agents widely used antiviral 
therapy.
conclusions: prognosis hbv-associated fulminant hepatic failure being
transformed developments antiviral therapy. however, noticed
that hbv controlled never eliminated, drug-resistance still remains 
major issue. hopefully, newer strategies may help solve problems.
