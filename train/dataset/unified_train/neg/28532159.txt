infectious laryngotracheitis virus (iltv) high proclivity replicate in
the larynx trachea chickens causing severe lesions. lack of
knowledge ability iltv replicate respiratory associated
tissues apart trachea. objective study investigate
how tissues first encounter virus dictate sites viral
replication lytic stage infection. replication patterns the
pathogenic strain 63140 chicken embryo origin (ceo) vaccine the
conjunctiva, harderian gland, nasal cavity trachea evaluated after
ocular, oral, intranasal intratracheal inoculation specific pathogen-free
chickens. viral replication assessed detection microscopic cytolytic
lesions, detection viral antigen viral genome load. route viral
entry greatly influenced virus replication strain 63140 ceo vaccine
in conjunctiva trachea, replication nasal cavity not
affected. harderian gland, independently route viral entry,
microscopic lesions characteristic lytic replication absent, whereas
viral antigen viral genomes either virus detected, suggesting that
the harderian gland may key site antigen uptake. findings study
suggest interactions virus epithelial-lymphoid tissues of
the nasal cavity, conjunctiva harderian gland dictate patterns iltv
lytic replication.
