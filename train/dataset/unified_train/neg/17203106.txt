interleukin-12 (il-12) potent antitumoral cytokine, high doses are
toxic. herein, demonstrate combinational transduction il-12 and
cc-chemokine ligand-27 (ccl27) genes pre-existing murine ov-hm ovarian
carcinoma meth-a fibrosarcoma, using rgd fiber-mutant adenoviral vectors, 
could induce tumor regression relieve systemic side effects effectively 
than either treatment alone. antitumor activity il-12 ccl27
combination treatment t-cell-dependent, development long-term specific
immunity confirmed rechallenge experiments. immunohistochemical analysis
of tumors transduced ccl27 gene alone cotransduced il-12 ccl27
genes showed significant increases numbers infiltrating cd3(+) cells,
which included cd4(+) cd8(+) cells. additionally, cotransduction with
il-12 ccl27 genes could efficiently activate tumor-infiltrating immune
cells transduction ccl27 alone, determined frequency of
perforin-positive cells expression levels ifn-gamma. furthermore, mice
treated il-12 ccl27 combination compared treated with
il-12 alone showed milder pathological changes, example, lymphocyte
infiltration extramedullary hematopoiesis, lung, liver spleen. our
data provide evidence combinational vivo transduction il-12 and
ccl27 genes promising approach development cancer immunogene
therapy simultaneously recruit activate tumor-infiltrating immune
cells.
