the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-specific lymphocyte proliferation response
was determined 40 persons different stages hiv infection. specific 
response purified hiv virion antigens strain htlv-iiib poor, occurred
in 9 40 subjects, improved addition of
interleukin-2, frequent symptom-free individuals (46%) in
patients lymphadenopathy syndrome (10%). reactivity subcomponent p24 
better whole hiv; reactivity present five six infected
persons increased addition exogenous interleukin-2. reactivities 
to subcomponents (g)p41 gp120 also measured. first evidence 
of specific cell-mediated immune response hiv antigen hiv-infected
persons. monkeys immunized purified hiv purified p24 displayed
cellular immunoreactivity whole hiv subcomponents. contrast 
the poor reactivity hiv antigen, lymphocytes patients good
specific cell proliferation responses cytomegalovirus herpes simplex virus
challenge normal response addition phytohemagglutinin. the
results suggest functional defect peripheral lymphocytes some
hiv-infected individuals basis response whole hiv antigen 
a better response gag protein.
