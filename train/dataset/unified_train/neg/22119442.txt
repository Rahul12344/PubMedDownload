induced expression flock house virus soma c. elegans results 
the rnai-dependent production virus-derived, small-interfering rnas (virnas), 
which turn silence viral genome. show virna-mediated
viral silencing effect transmitted non-mendelian manner many ensuing
generations. show viral silencing agents, virnas, are
transgenerationally transmitted template-independent manner work in
trans silence viral genomes present animals deficient producing
their virnas. results provide evidence transgenerational
inheritance acquired trait, induced exposure animals a
specific, biologically relevant physiological challenge. ability inherit
such extragenic information may provide adaptive benefits animal.
