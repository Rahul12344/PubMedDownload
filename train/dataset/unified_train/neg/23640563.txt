background & objectives: entomological surveillance dengue vectors using
pupal productivity indicators helpful effective management. 
basis, assessment made relative importance larval habitats
of aedes mosquitoes kolkata, endemic zone dengue west bengal, india.
methods: monthly collection larvae pupae aedes larval habitats
categorized earthen, plastic porcelain containers tyres, carried
out selected sites. pupal weight recorded degree sexual
dimorphism calculated. data pupal weight, sexual dimorphism and
immature density used regression analysis.
results: number positive sites type larval habitats varied
with months mosquito species. based mean density per month, plastic
containers productive habitats tyres least productive 
for aedes species. pupal weight ae. aegypti ae. albopictus
varied relative density type larval habitats. significant
differences pupal productivity, positive sites proportion pupae
were observed habitats. species-specific differences degree of
dimorphism noted females larger size males,
irrespective habitats.
interpretation & conclusions: pupal productivity aedes mosquitoes kolkata
differed terms type larval habitats immature density
affecting body size adults. habitat-based study pioneer
effort considering kolkata calls management plan source reduction
of habitats minimize aedes mosquitoes thus potential risk dengue.
