aim: investigate whether formation aggregated hbx potential
linking cellular responses.
methods: recombinant hbx expressed escherichia coli purified ni-nta
metal-affinity chromatography. anti-hbx monoclonal antibody developed for
immunocytochemical detection. bicistronic expression vector harboring full-length
dna hbx employed transfection human hepg2 cells. immunocytochemical
staining used examine intracellular hbx aggregates cells. the
effects hbx aggregation cell cycle apoptosis assessed flow
cytometry.
results: immunocytochemical staining revealed hbx formed
intracellular aggregate cytoplasm frequently accumulated large
granules. flow cytometry analysis showed hepg2 cells transfected vector
harboring hbx significantly increased apoptosis largely accumulated the
g0-g1 phase maintenance serum medium 36 hours. control cells without
hbx aggregates presence serum entered phase proliferated more
rapidly time. egfp fluorescence hbx expression cells was
significantly decreased.
conclusion: observations show cells hbx aggregate undergo growth
arrest apoptosis, whereas control cells without hbx remain growth and
progression phase. data may provide helpful information understand 
the biological effects hbx aggregates cells.
