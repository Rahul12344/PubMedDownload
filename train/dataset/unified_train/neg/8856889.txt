serologically. six 10 herds bovine respiratory syncytial virus (brsv)
antigen detected lung lavage fluids. one calf coronavirus 
and brsv detected simultaneously. paired blood samples confirmed four of
the herds brsv-infected, one herd brsv infection diagnosed by
the paired blood samples alone. significant increases antibody titres 
coronavirus observed two herds, combination other
virological agents. adenovirus antigen detected lavage
samples, two herds significant increase antibody titres against
adenovirus observed. parainfluenza-3 (pi-3) virus detected the
lung lavage fluids, four herds, antibodies pi-3 were
detected. three herds viral involvement could found. findings
