bacteriophage (phage) attractive advantages delivery systems compared
with mammalian viruses, considered poor vectors lack
evolved strategies confront overcome mammalian cell barriers infective 
agents. reasoned improved efficacy delivery might achieved 
structural modification viral capsid avoid pre- postinternalization
barriers mammalian cell transduction. generated multifunctional hybrid
adeno-associated virus/phage (aavp) particles enable simultaneous display of
targeting ligands phage's minor piii proteins also
degradation-resistance motifs numerous pviii coat proteins. this
genetic strategy directed evolution bestows next-generation aavp
particles feature resistance fibrinogen adsorption neutralizing
antibodies ability escape endolysosomal degradation. results in
superior gene transfer efficacy vitro also preclinical mouse models 
rodent human solid tumors. thus, unique functions next-generation 
aavp particles enable improved targeted gene delivery tumor cells.
