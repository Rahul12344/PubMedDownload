the alphaviruses flaviviruses include many important human pathogens, as
the dengue, west nile, chikungunya viruses. enveloped viruses infect
cells membrane fusion reaction triggered low ph endosomes. fusion 
is mediated viral membrane proteins acid-dependent conversion
from dimer virus surface homotrimer inserted host cell
membrane. review recent studies regulatory mechanisms silence
these fusion proteins virus exit sense low ph mediate protein
refolding virus entry. discuss results using truncated proteins to
dissect fusion reaction, future research directions including the
development antiviral therapies medically important viruses.
