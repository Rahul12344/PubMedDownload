to investigate dynamics conformation membrane-interacting ha2
domain hemagglutinin protein influenza virus, peripheral part of
the ha2 domain (aa 1-127) expressed escherichia coli. four consecutive
single-cysteine mutants, f63c, h64c, q65c, i66c, generated using
site-directed mutagenesis. region proposed undergo conformational
change loop helical coiled-coil going native the
fusion-active state [bullough et al. (1994) nature (london) 371, 37-43]. the
trimeric coiled-coil geometry positions 63 66 belong core that
cysteines individual monomers spatially close. hand,
positions 64 65 face aqueous phase cyteines monomers are
spatially remote. mutants studied cysteine-cysteine cross-linking
and spin-labeling electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) the
membrane-bound state detergent-solubilized state. extensive
intramolecular cysteine-cysteine cross-linking observed f63c and
i66c also h64c. rates cross-linking comparable three
mutants physiological temperatures. results inconsistent what
is expected well-defined coiled-coil suggest region containing
the mutation sites flexible. however, characteristic cross-linking pattern
consistent well-defined coiled-coil developed low temperatures.
line shapes epr spectra also indicate region dynamic ambient
temperatures. flexibility perhaps arises equilibrium a
coiled-coil random coil conformation. significant changes epr
spectra observed upon lowering ph fusogenic conditions, suggesting
that flexible structure stable conformation neutral low
ph. dynamic flexibility region may important implications for
the mechanism ha-induced membrane fusion; example may required for
the apposition viral endosomal membranes.
