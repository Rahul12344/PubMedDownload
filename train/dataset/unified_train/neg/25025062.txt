following emergence a(h1n1)pdm09 humans, novel influenza virus
was reverse transmitted infected people swine population worldwide. in
this study investigated molecular evolution a(h1n1)pdm09 virus
identified pigs reared single herd. nasal swabs taken pigs showing
respiratory distress tested influenza type a(h1n1)pdm09 by
real-time rt-pcr assays. virus isolation positive samples attempted by
inoculation nasal swabs samples specific pathogen free embryonated
chicken eggs (ece) complete genome sequencing performed virus strains 
after replication ece original swab sample. molecular analysis 
hemagglutinin (ha) showed, four swine influenza viruses study, 
unique significant amino acid change, represented two-amino acid insertion
at ha receptor binding site. phylogenetic analysis ha, neuraminidase, 
concatenated internal genes revealed similar topology, viruses 
study forming separate cluster, branching outside a(h1n1)pdm09 isolates
recognized 2014. emergence new cluster a(h1n1)pdm09 swine
raises concerns whether a(h1n1)pdm09 new molecular
characteristics become established pigs potentially transmitted to
humans.
