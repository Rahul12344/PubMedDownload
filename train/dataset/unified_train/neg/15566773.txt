hypotheses: (i) flow cytometry potential rapid detection of
respiratory viral antigens. (ii) technique applied viral diagnosis
in clinical samples.
objectives study design: (i) study identification six common
respiratory viral pathogens flow cytometry, virus infected uninfected
cultured cells, models positive negative clinical samples. (ii) to
compare flow cytometry established techniques viral isolation and
immunofluorescent microscopy diagnosis respiratory syncytial virus
infection 68 naso-pharyngeal aspirates taken children sent the
virology laboratory routine virological diagnosis.
results: (i) virus analysed, populations infected non-infected
cells clearly discernable, confirming potential method rapid
viral diagnosis clinical samples. (ii) two definitions employed a
sample positive flow cytometry, compared combined
established techniques. sensitivity, specificity, positive negative
predictive values flow cytometry 41%, 98%, 92% 71% first
definition 74%, 88%, 80% 84% second definition respectively.
conclusions: tested study, flow cytometry less sensitive than
established techniques well recently developed rapid diagnostic techniques 
for diagnosis respiratory syncytial virus infection. evaluation of
the potential flow cytometry rapid viral diagnosis warranted.
