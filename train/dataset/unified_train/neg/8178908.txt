noncontraceptive actions oral contraceptives (ocs) include hormonal effects on
bone mass, sexually transmitted disease, pelvic inflammatory disease, the
cardiovascular system, menstrual function, future fertility. information
about effects ocs bone mass limited contradictory. two recent
studies failed show positive effect oc use bone mass density
compared three cross-sectional studies one longitudinal study that
showed favorable effects. recently completed study 156 healthy females
indicated significant correlation oc use rate change in
total body bone-mineral content. one study involving depot medroxyprogesterone
acetate suggests bone density decreases long-term use drug. use
of ocs reduce risk gonococcal chlamydial infection the
lower tract fact may enhance spread lower tract infection. however, ocs
may exert protective effect types pelvic inflammatory disease. 
regarding transmission human immunodeficiency virus, results recent
studies conflicting. research related newer oc formulations containing 35 
micrograms less ethinyl estradiol suggests risk negative
cardiovascular effect substantially reduced. forms hormonal
contraception alter menstrual function degree, patterns improve 
with duration use. evidence exists hormonal contraception permanently 
affects fertility, although fertility restoration may delayed some
agents.
