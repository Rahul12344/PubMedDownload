background aim: studies investigating treatment of
hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection current former drug users. 
mind, sought evaluate antiviral efficacy interferon alpha-2b (ifn
alpha-2b) pegylated-interferon alpha-2b (peg-ifn alpha-2b) ribavirin (rbv)
in injection drug users (idu) enrolled directly observed therapy (dot)
program, measured sustained virologic response (svr).
methods: viremic hcv-infected idu, alanine aminotransferase (alt) >1.5x
upper limit normal (uln) offered 24-48 week (based hcv genotype)
therapy rbv (800-1200 mg/day, based weight) along ifn alpha-2b (3
million iu thrice weekly) replaced peg-ifn alpha-2b (1.5 Ã¬g/kg weekly) as
it became available. injections directly observed. primary endpoint 
was svr.
results: overall, 40 patients (33 males) received ifn alpha-2b (12) peg-ifn
alpha-2b (28), 55% hcv genotypes 2 3. 14 discontinued therapy, 5 due
to toxicity, 6 due illicit drug use 3 achieve early virologic
response. intent-to-treat analysis, overall svr 55% (22/40), 64%
(14/22) subjects genotypes 2/3. significant difference in
response rates among >6 (50%) <or=6 months (64%) drug abstinence (p
= 0.51) among (53%) without (57%) intercurrent drug use (p =
0.99); however, frequent users (n = 9) decreased svr (22%) compared
with occasional users (n = 10, 80%, p = 0.12).
conclusion: treatment hcv current former idu within multidisciplinary
dot program successfully undertaken, resulting svr similar 
randomized controlled trials.
