plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1) plays key role control of
coagulation tissue remodeling shown regulated number 
of cell stimuli, among hypoxia. study characterize the
hypoxia-mediated induction pai-1 human hepatoma cell line hepg2. found
that pai-1 tightly regulated narrow oxygen gradient. incubation 
oxygen concentrations 1% 2%, 60-fold increase pai-1 messenger rna
levels observed, whereas mild hypoxic conditions 3.5% not
appear induce transcription. moreover, increased levels pai-1 protein 
observed incubation low oxygen tensions. sequence analysis,
several putative hypoxia-response elements (hres 1-5) identified the
human pai-i promoter. reporter gene assays showed hre-2 (-194 -187)
was necessary sufficient hypoxia-mediated response. by
electrophoretic mobility assay observed hypoxia-dependent binding protein
complex hre-2 motif. analysis demonstrated hre-2 was
specifically recognized hypoxia-inducible transcription factor
1alpha-arylhydrocarbon nuclear translocator complex. taken together, data
demonstrate hypoxia-induced transcription mediated hif-1
interaction hre-2 site human pai-1 promoter.
