anti-angiogenic gene therapy represents promising strategy cancer; however,
it rarely tested malignant mesothelioma, highly aggressive tumor
associated asbestos poor prognosis. present study, we
investigated whether anti-angiogenic factors angiostatin, endostatin 
the soluble form vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (sflk1) were
able inhibit endothelial cell proliferation via lentivirus-mediated gene
transfer malignant mesothelioma cells culture. also assessed whether a
dual-agent strategy greater therapeutic benefit. human malignant pleural
mesothelioma msto-211h cells transduced using lentiviral vectors that
individually expressed angiostatin, endostatin sflk1 linked enhanced
green fluorescent protein (egfp) marker gene expression via internal ribosome 
entry site. lentivirus expressing egfp alone used control. the
resultant cells designated msto-a, msto-e, msto-f msto-c confirmed by
western blot analysis fluorescence microscopy stably express the
corresponding proteins. differences observed vitro growth rates
between cells. however, co-culture msto-a, msto-e msto-f
showed significant suppression human umbilical endothelial cell growth in
vitro compared msto-c. furthermore, combination two among
msto-a, msto-e msto-f significantly enhanced efficacy. results suggest 
that combinatorial anti-angiogenic gene therapy targeting different pathways of
endothelial growth factor signaling potential greater therapeutic
efficacy single-agent regimen.
