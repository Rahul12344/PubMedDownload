the aim study investigate seroprevalence hpv type 16 in
korean women precancerous cancerous lesions uterine cervix. the
cases 173 korean women 130 high-grade cervical intraepithelial
neoplasias (cin), 43 cervical carcinomas control group 106 women
showing normal cervical cytology. serologic assays performed using hpv-16
vlps antigen elisa. specific antibodies hpv-16 vlp detected
in 59.2% (77/130) patients high-grade cin, 67.4% (29/43) the
patients cervical cancer 20.8% (22/106) control subjects. no
difference serologic response found high-grade cin cancer.
hpv-16 seropositivity showed significant association patients' age and
preoperative hpv dna infection. recurrence high-grade cin affected 
the vlp-16 seropositivity. recurrence carcinoma showed borderline
association hpv-16 seropositivity (p=0.06). association the
cancer recurrence seropositivity found logistic regression
analysis. two patients dying cancer follow-up period both
seronegative (p=0.01). conclusion, serologic testing hpv-16 vlp antibody
provides disease indicator cervical lesions potential prognostic
parameter cervical carcinoma.
