the impact interferon (ifn)-free direct-acting antiviral (daa) hepatitis c
virus (hcv) treatments utilization outcomes associated hcv-positive
deceased donor liver transplantation (ddlt) largely unknown. using the
scientific registry transplant recipients, identified 25 566 hcv-positive
ddlt recipients 2005 2015 compared practices according the
introduction daa therapies using modified poisson regression. proportion
of hcv-positive recipients received hcv-positive livers increased 6.9%
in 2010 16.9% 2015. hcv-positive recipients 61% likely receive
an hcv-positive liver 2010 (early daa/ifn era) (arr:1.45 1.611.79 , p <
0.001) almost three times likely receive one 2013 (ifn-free daa
era) (arr:2.58 2.853.16 , p < 0.001). compared hcv-negative livers,
hcv-positive livers 3 times likely discarded 2005 2010
(arr:2.69 2.993.34 , p < 0.001), 2.2 times likely 2010 (arr:1.80
2.162.58 , p < 0.001) 1.7 times likely 2013 (arr:1.37 1.682.04 , p
< 0.001). donor hcv status associated increased risk all-cause
graft loss (p = 0.1), change time (p = 0.8). use of
hcv-positive livers increased dramatically, coinciding advent of
daas. however, discard rate remains nearly double hcv-negative
livers. optimization hcv-positive liver utilization necessary to
improve access candidates.
