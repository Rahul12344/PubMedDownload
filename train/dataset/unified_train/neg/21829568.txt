hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection major risk hepatocellular carcinoma
(hcc), serious global health problem two billion people exposed 
to worldwide. hbx, essential factor viral replication putative
oncoprotein encoded hbv genome, shown promote oncogenic
properties multiple sites hbv-infected liver cells. expression level of
hbx closely associates development progression hcc, therefore the
mechanism(s) regulating stability hbx important oncogenesis of
hbv-infected cells. demonstrate x-linked tumor suppressor tspx
enhances degradation hbx ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. tspx
interacts hbx proteasome 19s lid subunit rpn3 via c-terminal 
acidic tail. importantly, over-expression rpn3 protects hbx from, and
hence acts negative regulator for, proteasome-dependent degradation. tspx
abrogates rpn3-depedent stabilization hbx, suggesting tspx rpn3
act competitively regulation hbx stability. since mutation and/or
epigenetic repression x-located tumor suppressor gene(s) could significantly
predispose males human cancers, data suggest tspx-induced hbx
degradation could play key role(s) hepatocarcinogenesis among hbv-infected hcc
patients.
