variola major virus remains potent weapon bioterror. currently an
investigational-new-drug application cidofovir therapy variola
major virus infections. stittelaar colleagues compared levels of
effectiveness postexposure smallpox vaccination (elstree-rivm) antiviral
treatment cidofovir acyclic nucleoside phosphonate analogue
6-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)alkoxy]-2,4-diaminopyrimidine (hpmpo-dapy) lethal
intratracheal infection cynomolgus monkeys monkeypox virus, variola
virus surrogate. results demonstrated either compound more
effective vaccination ellstree vaccine (k. j. stittelaar et al.,
nature 439:745-748, 2006). unanswered question translate this
information therapy poxvirus infections people. a
proof-of-principle study, used novel vitro hollow-fiber infection model
system determine pharmacodynamics vaccinia virus infection hela-s3
cells treated cidofovir. results demonstrate currently licensed
dose cidofovir 5 mg/kg body weight weekly probenecid (which
ameliorates nephrotoxicity) unlikely provide protection patients
intentionally exposed variola major virus. demonstrate the
antiviral effect independent schedule drug administration. exposures
(area concentration-time curve) cidofovir robust
protective effect require doses 5 10 times currently
administered humans. doses may cause nephrotoxicity, therefore,
approaches include probenecid administration well schedules of
administration help ameliorate uptake cidofovir renal
tubular epithelial cells need considered addressing treatment for
people.
