the exponential increase protein structures deposited protein data bank
(pdb) resulted elucidation most, all, protein folds, thus
making molecular replacement (mr) frequently used method structure
determination. survey pdb shows structures determined
by molecular replacement contain less ten molecules asymmetric unit
and predominantly virus ribosome structures contain than
20 molecules asymmetric unit. success mr method depends
on several factors, homology size input model, is
also well known fact method become significantly difficult in
cases large number molecules asymmetric unit, higher
crystallographic symmetry tight packing. paper, five representative
structures containing 16-18 homomeric molecules asymmetric unit the
strategies used solve structures described. the
difficulties faced lessons learned structure-determination
efforts useful selected similar future situations large
number molecules asymmetric unit.
