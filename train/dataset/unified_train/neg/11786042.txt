viral tropism refers ability virus selectively infect given
subset cells. relies variety viral host determinants that
entail virus binding entry target cells, addition presence 
genetic elements allow enhance viral gene expression specific
manner. report results neuroanatomical studies rat brains
injected different cerebral structures vectors derived canine
adenovirus type 2 (cav2), whose natural target respiratory epithelium.
control animals injected vectors derived human adenovirus type 5
(ad5) displayed previously documented pattern gene transfer both
neurons glial cells. injection cav2 vectors resulted selective
transduction neuronal cells. cy3-labeled cav2 particles allowed us to
establish high affinity vector neuronal processes vitro and
their rapid uptake retrograde axonal transport vivo. after
intrahippocampal injections, labeled particles found, within 1 hour, closely
associated nuclei neurons layer ii entorhinal cortex.
injections striatum resulted massive transduction dopaminergic
neurons substantia nigra compacta. high efficiency cav2
vectors retrogradely transported opens possibility targeting a
transgene neuron populations remote injection site difficult to
access. data support possibility target key structures undergoing a
degenerative process: enthorhinal cortex, affected first in
alzheimer's disease; substantia nigra compacta, undergoes
degeneration parkinson's disease.
