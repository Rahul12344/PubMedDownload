viral infections fetus newborn often involve central nervous system
(cns) lead significant morbidity mortality. substantial progress
has made identifying interventions decreasing adverse neurodevelopmental 
outcomes population. review highlights progress treatment of
important viruses affecting cns susceptible hosts, focusing on
herpes simplex virus (hsv), cytomegalovirus (cmv), human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv), enteroviruses. observation high-dose acyclovir improves
mortality neonatal hsv disease culminated decades antiviral research for
this disease. recently, prolonged oral acyclovir found improve
neurologic morbidity neonatal hsv encephalitis. ganciclovir, more
recently oral prodrug valganciclovir, effective improving hearing and
neurodevelopment congenital cmv infection. increasing evidence suggests
early control perinatal hiv infection implications neurocognitive
functioning school age. lastly, antiviral pleconaril studied
for nearly two decades treating severe enteroviral infections, newer
data supporting role drug neonates. identifying common mechanisms
for pathogenesis viral cns disease critical period brain
development important research goal, highlighted recent emergence of
zika virus potential cause fetal neurodevelopmental abnormalities.
