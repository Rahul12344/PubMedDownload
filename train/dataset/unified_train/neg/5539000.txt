the thermal inactivation t4 lambda bacteriophage.

pollard ec, solosko w.

thermal inactivation t(4) lambda bacteriophage shows two components of
differing sensitivity present. cannot interpreted owing to
nucleic acid protein. one protein function-the inhibition of
radiation-induced dna degradation-is lost quite different thermal kinetics. 
lambda heated presence dnase rapidly inactivated; lambda is
also protected slow cooling heat. results suggest packing
of dna head occurs permit different degrees thermal
expansion outer coils. rupture coat one form 
inactivation. killed vaccines could safely made heating the
presence nuclease followed rapid cooling.
