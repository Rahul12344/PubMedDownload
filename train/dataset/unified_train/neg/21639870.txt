background: increased numbers interleukin-17-producing cd4+ cells (th17)
have found association hepatitis b virus (hbv)-induced liver injury.
however, mechanism underlying increase th17 responses patients with
hbv infection remains unclear. study, investigate possible
regulatory mechanisms increased th17 responses patients chronic
hepatitis b(chb).
methods: th17 response il-6r expression cd4+ cells peripheral blood
samples determined flow cytometry. cytokines tgf-β, il-1β, il-6 il-17
in plasma and/or supernatant samples determined elisa il-17 and
il-6r mrna levels quantified quantitative real-time reverse polymerase
chain reaction.
results: data indicated frequency periphery th17 cells is
significantly correlated percentage cd4+ cells expressing il-6r 
chb patients. cd4+ cells patients chb, healthy
donors, produced higher levels il-17 il-6r expression upon
stimulation hbv core antigen (hbcag) vitro. pma/ionomycin and
hbcag -stimulated up-regulation il-17 production cd4+ cells could be
reversed neutralizing antibody il-6r.
conclusion: showed enhancement il-6r expression cd4+ cells upon
hbv infection contributes increased th17 response patients chb.
