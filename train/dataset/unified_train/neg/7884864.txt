chronically human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) strain iiib-infected
human th4-7-5 astrocytoma cells show low-level virus production. cocultivation of
th4-7-5 cells myelomonocytic cells led active virus production these
target cells lag period, indicating cell-determined restriction virus 
replication glial cells. hiv-1 transcript patterns th4-7-5 cells
contained small proportion rev-dependent mrna species, mimicking a
rev-negative phenotype despite presence rev mrnas protein. sequencing 
of single provirus integrated th4-7-5 cells demonstrated rev gene
and rev-responsive element intact. results suggested inhibited
function rev-regulatory unit astrocytoma cells. transfection of
th4-7-5 cells rev expression plasmid resulted weak induction of
proviral p24gag antigen levels compared dramatic increase observed in
rev-permissive hela cells. immunofluorescence analysis th4-7-5 cells
transfected rev-expressing plasmid revealed prominent cytoplasmic and
nuclear-nucleolar localization rev, contrast predominant
nuclear-nucleolar localization pattern rev hela cells. conclude that
restriction virus production th4-7-5 cells least partially due a
block rev-dependent posttranscriptional regulation hiv expression.
