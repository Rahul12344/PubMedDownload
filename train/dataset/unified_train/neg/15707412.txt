the evaluation long-term cellular immunity ebv pediatric orthotopic
liver transplant (olt) recipients treatment humanized anti-cd20
monoclonal antibody (rituximab) yet explored. institution,
one child ebv-related mononucleosis-like syndrome five children with
polymorphic-ebv-ptld occurring 6-88 months olt treated rituximab.
treatment well tolerated. children achieved complete remission. after
rituximab, b-lymphocytes undetectable peripheral blood ebv-load, 
monitored real-time pcr, decreased undetectable levels children
from >4000 copies/microg dna diagnosis. four eight months rituximab, 
ebv-load increased (>4000 copies/microg dna) four children, ptld recurred 
in three. frequency ebv-specific t-cell precursors, measured elispot 
analysis, remained lower healthy controls. rituximab effectively induced 
regression ptld olt recipients. however, ebv-specific t-cell
immunocompetence, may crucial long-term control ebv-mediated 
proliferation, improve.
