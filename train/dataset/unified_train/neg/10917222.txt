background: developing countries vaccination measles virus (mv) is
generally administered 9 months age, although well-documented that
protection infants passively acquired maternal mv antibodies waning
before immunization given. purpose study investigate the
decay maternally derived mv antibodies nigerian infants well to
compare german nigerian cohort paired mothers newborns regarding the
placental transfer efficiency mv-specific igg total igg antibodies.
methods: mv-specific igg antibodies measured commercially available
mv-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, recombinant hemagglutinin enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay well neutralization assay. total igg values were
determined standard immunoturbidimetric test.
results: anti-mv igg titers twice high german newborns nigerian 
newborns. increased concentration immunoglobulins transferred via the
placenta found german cohort. high concentrations total
maternal igg reduced concentration mv-specific well total igg that
crossed placenta. furthermore 17% 4-month-old nigerian infants
were still protected measles. antibodies biologic half-life 33
days biochemical half-life 48 days.
conclusions: findings demonstrate decay passively acquired mv
antibodies occurred even rapidly expected resulting susceptibility
to mv 4-month-old infants nigeria. furthermore transfer of
maternal anti-mv igg total igg antibodies newborn efficient
in german cohort compared nigerian group. findings suggest the
use alternative vaccination strategies developing countries possibly
reduce window susceptibility measles.
