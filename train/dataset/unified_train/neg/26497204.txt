epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection closely associated tumorigenesis and
development nasopharyngeal carcinoma (npc), underlying molecular
mechanisms remain poorly understood. recently reported ebv
encodes 44 mature mirnas, found promote tumor development
by targeting virus-infected host genes self-viral genes. however, targets 
of ebv encoded-mirnas related npc development identified to
date. study, revealed npc cells, ebv-mir-bart10-3p directly
targets btrc gene encodes βtrcp (beta-transducin repeat containing e3
ubiquitin protein ligase). found ebv-mir-bart10-3p expression clinical
samples cohort 106 npc patients negatively correlated btrc
expression levels. over-expression ebv-mir-bart10-3p down-regulation of
btrc associated poor prognosis npc patients. ebv-mir-bart10-3p
promoted invasion migration cabilities npc cells targeting
of btrc regulation expression downstream substrates β-catenin
and snail. result, ebv-mir-bart10-3p facilitated epithelial-mesenchymal
transition npc. study presents unreported mechanism underlying ebv
infection npc carcinogenesis, provides potential novel biomarker npc
diagnosis, treatment prognosis.
