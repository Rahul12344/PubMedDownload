antioxidant enzymes survival normal simian virus 40-transformed mouse 
embryo cells hyperthermia.

relative cell survival activity free radical scavenging enzymes
superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase measured in
cloned normal (mea) sv40-transformed (svmea) mouse embryo cells exposed 44
degrees c 0-3 h. 37 degrees c, three enzymes 2-5 times higher 
mea svmea. hyperthermia significantly alter enzyme levels in
either cell line selectively reduced transformed cell survival less than
5% relative survival normal cells remained 75%. latter,
however, could reduced 25% normal cells pretreated 3 mm
diethyldithiocarbamate, inhibitor copper- zinc-containing superoxide
dismutase. similar treatment rendered svmea extremely thermosensitive. the
other hand, sublethal heat treatment (15 min 45 degrees c) cultured cells
resulted relative thermal resistance upon subsequent exposure 45 degrees 
c 1-4 h. induced thermotolerance associated rise in
antioxidant enzyme levels became significant 4-6 h the
initial heat treatment. induced enzyme thermotolerance levels transformed 
cells remained, nonetheless, far normal cells. data show 
inherent (in mea) well induced (in svmea) thermotolerance associated
with high antioxidant enzyme levels reverse true case of
inherent (in svmea) induced (in mea) thermosensitivity. findings
suggest increased production oxygen free radicals may involved in
hyperthermic cell injury, becomes function basal inducible
levels antioxidant enzymes. induction latter hyperthermia is
apparently inefficient transformed cells making vulnerable. enzyme
induction seems also require lag period 4-6 h suggesting possible
involvement intermediate inducer(s) molecular level. so-called heat 
shock proteins may candidates role.
