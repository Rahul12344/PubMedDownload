with demonstration effect gbv-c infection outcome hiv
infection, become important understand epidemiology gbv-c. the
purpose study determine prevalence high- low-risk
populations. following populations tested: school children, 9 15
years age (n = 901), blood donors (n = 5,203), hospital employees (n = 1,432),
and prisoners injecting drug users (n = 447). in-house rt-pcr gbv-crna
was used together commercial elisa anti-e2 (boehringer, germany). in
addition, questionnaires risk factors transmission serological tests 
for hiv hepatitis applied. overall prevalence gbv-crna 1.4%
among children, 2.2% among blood donors, 2.2% among hospital employees, 12.5%
among non-injecting prisoners, 34.9% among drug injectors. correspondingly
anti-e2 found 0.3%, 12.3%, 25.0%, 42.7%. among hospital employees,
independent risk factors gbv-c professions blood exposure and
sexual risk partners. among prisoners drug users, injecting sexual risk
index associated independently gbv-c. based results, the
following hypothesis suggested: gbv-c transmitted frequently birth or
early childhood leads chronic infection cases. sexual
transmission important route transmission adult population 
but infection usually transient. blood borne transmission plays role
among health care workers injecting drug users gbv-c further
evaluated surrogate marker professional blood exposure.
