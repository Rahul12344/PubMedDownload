excretion poliomyelitis virus demonstrated monkeys four
different parenteral routes inoculation. virus found the
pharyngeal secretions stools infraorbital nerve dip after
inoculation gasserian ganglion; pharyngeal secretions after
intrathalamic inoculation; stools inoculation celiac
ganglion. excretion began early 2nd late 7th day after
inoculation, instances onset symptoms. immediate source 
of excreted virus appeared infected peripheral ganglia neural
connections mucous membranes upper lower portions the
alimentary tract, notably pharynx. primary infection body surfaces was
excluded experiments therefore could account excretion 
virus. mode elimination probably centrifugal spread axons
of peripheral nerve fibers way blood stream lymphatics.
evidence obtained excretion virus occurred, reinvasion 
from implicated surface other, previously uninfected peripheral ganglia
ensues, thus providing new sources excretion potential pathways for
invasion cns. suggested reinvasion may occur serially
until immunological defenses come play. experiments lend support 
the view initial stage poliomyelitis, perhaps throughout
its course cases, e.g. asymptomatic mild cases without
central nervous symptoms, infection confined peripheral nervous system.
involvement cns occurs secondary phase infective
process necessary prelude elimination virus. excretion 
explainable basis established neurocytotropism axonal
conduction virus without resort hypothesis extraneural
infection.
