infection, cultures body fluids serological tests.
results: sixty-seven previously healthy children, aged (median, 25-75%) 0.7 years
(0.2-1.5), identified neutropenia (frequency: 2.0%). infectious
agent identified 34/67 cases (50.7%) (viral infection: n=24, bacterial:
n=10). 50/67 (74.6%) children, neutropenia recovered within 2 months
(transient neutropenia, tn), 17/67 (25.4%) persisted more
than two months. two years diagnosis 50/67 children (74.6%) accepted 
reassessed. children, 8/50 (16%) remained neutropenic (neutropenic
children, nc), 42/50 recovered completely.
conclusion: neutropenia childhood usually transient, often following
viral common bacterial infections, present serious complications and
in majority, resolves spontaneously. however, significant percentage 
of patients, neutropenia discovered course infection, a
ground preceding chronic neutropenic status.
