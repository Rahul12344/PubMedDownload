background: role antiviral prophylaxis prevent epstein-barr virus (ebv)
viremia posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder pediatric solid organ
transplant recipients controversial. examined whether valganciclovir (val) 
prophylaxis cytomegalovirus infection associated ebv viremia
following transplantation ebv-naive children.
methods: single-center, retrospective study conducted ebv-naive
pediatric heart renal transplant recipients ebv-positive donor from
january 1996 april 2017. val tested association ebv viremia-free 
survival first 6 months posttransplantation immunosuppressant
exposure highest. survival models evaluated val duration, adjustment 
for baseline confounders.
results: among cohort (n = 44), 3 (6.8%) heart transplants, 25 (56.8%)
received val, 22 (50%) developed ebv viremia first-year
posttransplantation. mean time-to-viremia 143 vs. 90 days val and
no-val groups, respectively (p = 0.008), first 6 months. two patients
developed viremia val. additional day val associated with
1.4% increase viremia-free survival (p < 0.001). multivariable modeling val
with baseline risk factors identify independent risk factors.
conclusion: val independently associated delayed onset ebv viremia,
with prolongation delay additional day antiviral prophylaxis.
