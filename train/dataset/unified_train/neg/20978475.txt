x-linked chronic granulomatous disease (x-cgd) primary immunodeficiency
caused mutations cybb gene encoding phagocyte nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate (nadph)-oxidase catalytic subunit gp91(phox). recent
clinical trial x-cgd using spleen focus-forming virus (sffv)-based
Î³-retroviral vector demonstrated clear therapeutic benefits several
patients although complicated enhancer-mediated mutagenesis diminution 
effectiveness time due silencing viral long terminal repeat (ltr).
to improve safety efficacy, designed lentiviral vector directs
transgene expression primarily myeloid cells. end, created a
synthetic chimeric promoter contains binding sites myeloid transcription
factors caat box enhancer-binding family proteins (c/ebps) pu.1, are
highly expressed granulocytic differentiation. predicted, chimeric 
promoter regulated higher reporter gene expression myeloid nonmyeloid 
cells, human hematopoietic progenitors upon granulocytic differentiation. 
in murine model stem cell gene therapy x-cgd, chimeric vector
resulted high levels gp91(phox) expression committed myeloid cells and
granulocytes, restored normal nadph-oxidase activity. findings were
recapitulated human neutrophils derived transduced x-cgd cd34(+) cells in
vivo, suggest chimeric promoter utility gene therapy
of myeloid lineage disorders cgd.
