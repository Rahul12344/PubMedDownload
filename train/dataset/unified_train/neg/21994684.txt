over past 30 years, genomic bioinformatic analysis human adenoviruses 
has achieved using variety dna sequencing methods; initially the
use restriction enzymes currently use gs flx
pyrosequencing technology. following conception dna sequencing the
1970s, analysis adenoviruses evolved 100 base pair mrna fragments 
entire genomes. comparative genomics adenoviruses made debut 1984 
nucleotides amino acids coding sequences within hexon genes two
human adenoviruses (hadv), hadv-c2 hadv-c5, compared analyzed. it
was determined three different zones (1-393, 394-1410, 1411-2910)
within hexon gene, hadv-c2 hadv-c5 shared zones 1 3 95%
and 89.5% nucleotide identity, respectively. 1992, hadv-c5 became first
adenovirus genome fully sequenced using sanger method. next
seven years, whole genome analysis characterization completed using
bioinformatic tools blastn, tblastx, clustalv fasta, order to
determine key proteins species hadv-a hadv-f. bioinformatic
revolution initiated introduction novel species, hadv-g, that
was typed named use whole genome sequencing phylogenetics as
opposed traditional serology. hadv bioinformatics continue advance 
the latest sequencing technology enables scientists add expand the
resource databases. result advancements, novel hadvs typed 
has changed. bioinformatic analysis become revolutionary tool has
significantly accelerated in-depth study hadv microevolution through
comparative genomics.
