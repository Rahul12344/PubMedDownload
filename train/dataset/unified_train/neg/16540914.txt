hypothesis: persistent measles virus infection otic capsule suggested
to etiologic factor otosclerosis. otosclerosis disease complex
unknown etiology causing progressive conductive and/or sensorineural hearing loss
(hl).
background: diagnostic methods otosclerosis sensitive ossicular chain
fixation low specificity otosclerotic stapes ankylosis.
methods: nucleic acid extracted stapes foot plates clinically stapes 
fixation patients (n = 213). measles virus nucleoprotein rna amplified by
reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. amplification results were
correlated histologic findings 49 cases. antimeasles igg levels all
clinically stapes fixation well control sera specimens measured by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
results: among clinically stapes fixation patients, 141 stapes foot plates
contained measles virus rna. among 49 histologic specimens, viral rna was
detectable histologically otosclerotic stapes foot plates (n = 35).
histology virus-negative foot plates (n = 14) excluded otosclerosis.
antimeasles igg levels significantly lower sera patients with
virus-positive stapes control sera.
conclusions: combination decreased antimeasles igg serum level conductive 
hl great specificity sensitivity diagnostic method the
preoperative evaluation ossicular chain fixations otosclerosis. low
antimeasles igg level indicates otosclerosis, whereas high level suggests
non-otosclerotic ossicular chain fixations. preoperative elucidation cause
of conductive hl may suggest optional medical treatment preference to
surgical methods.
