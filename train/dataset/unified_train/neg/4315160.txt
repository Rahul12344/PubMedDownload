type 1 type 2 herpes simplex viruses: serological biological differences.

plummer g, waner jl, phuangsab a, goodheart cr.

forty isolates herpes simplex virus compared means of
cross-neutralization curves. 11 oral isolates serotype 1, 29
genital/anal isolates serotype 2. cytopathic effects two
serotypes consistently different. passage strains type 1 type 2 in
mice rabbits yielded two variants, although majority strains
remained unchanged serologically cytopathic effects. two
variants derived type 1 strains differed parent strains in
their cytopathic effects, producing syncytia enlarged plaques.
they had, however, retained serotypic properties deoxyribonucleic
acid (dna) densities parent strains. roizman syncytial/macroplaque
strain herpes simplex virus also included study; density its
dna (1.727 g/ml) typical type 1 strains, serologically seemed be
basically type 1 strain, although neutralized type 2 antiserum
slightly better type 1 strains. growth curves performed of
the two serotypes rabbit kidney, human fibroblast, mouse embryo tissue
cultures. type 2 strains attained lower titers infectivity three 
cell systems; levels infectivity type 2 virus culture fluid
decreased much rapidly maximum attained the
levels infectivity type 1 strains, due greater instability of
the type 2 virus. parallel titrations different strains tissue cultures and
intracerebrally mice indicated latter assay system usually more
sensitive type 2 strains type 1 strains. paralytic
sequelae inflammatory changes lumbar ganglia spinal cord young
rabbits inoculated extraneurally strains two serotypes also indicate 
that type 2 virus virulent laboratory animals type 1
virus.
