nonsense-mediated mrna decay (nmd) rna surveillance mechanism requires
upframeshift protein 1 (upf1). study demonstrates human upf1 exerts
protective effects rat paralysis model based amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (als)-associated protein, tdp-43 (transactive response dna-binding
protein 43â€‰kda). adeno-associated virus vector (aav9) used express
tdp-43 throughout spinal cord rats, inducing reproducible limb paralysis, 
to recapitulate paralysis als. selected upf1 therapeutic testing
based genetic screen yeast. expression human tdp-43 human upf1 
in spinal cord titrated less twofold respective
endogenous level. aav9 human mycupf1 clearly improved overall motor scores in
rats also expressing tdp-43. gene therapy effect mycupf1 specific 
reproducible compared groups receiving either empty vector green
fluorescent protein vector controls. gene therapy maintained forelimb motor
function rats would otherwise become quadriplegic. work helps
validate upf1 novel therapeutic als tdp-43-related diseases
and may implicate upf1 nmd involvement underlying disease mechanisms.
