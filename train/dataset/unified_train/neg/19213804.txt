aims: inflammation contributes increased cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality associated activation renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.
the aim study investigate whether eplerenone, selective
aldosterone receptor antagonist, anti-inflammatory effects viral
myocarditis.
methods results: four-week-old inbred male dba/2 mice inoculated
intraperitoneally 10 plaque-forming units (pfu) encephalomyocarditis 
(emc) virus. mice fed standard chow (control) chow containing
2.5 mg/kg eplerenone, starting either day 0 (inoculation) day 7.
survival 28 days significantly higher mice started eplerenone
treatment day 0 (35 vs. 15% controls, n = 40, p < 0.05). area of
myocardial fibrosis day 28 significantly smaller eplerenone-treated
mice controls (19.8 +/- 2.6%, n = 14, vs. 33.4 +/- 5.4%, n = 6, mean +/- 
sem, p < 0.05). gene expression mouse mast cell proteases-4 -5, matrix
metalloproteinase-9, type procollagen day 6 emc virus inoculation 
was significantly decreased hearts eplerenone-treated mice.
conclusion: results suggest eplerenone anti-inflammatory effects, 
and exerts beneficial effects viral myocarditis suppression genes
related mast cells cardiac remodelling hearts mice.
