a number studies conducted many years shown hepatitis c virus
(hcv) infect variety cell types. vivo infection monocytes,
macrophages, dendritic cells hcv frequently shown number 
researchers. studies demonstrated replication hcv detecting 
presence negative genomic strands variety non-structural hcv
proteins infected cells. addition, analyses genome sequences also
shown different cell types harbor different hcv variants. investigators 
have also done preliminary studies cellular genes affected hcv
infection, yet sufficient number studies to
understand effects infection cells. analyses vitro hcv
replication shown monocytes, macrophages dendritic cells be
infected hcv patient sera plasma. studies suggest entry and
cellular locations may vary different cell types. studies suggest
that macrophages may preferentially allow hcv genotype 1 replicate, but
macrophages appear select particular hypervariable regions. overall,
these studies agree model monocytes macrophages act an
amplification system, cells infected show cytopathic
effects, continuously produce hcv. allows produce virus 
extended time allows spread cell types.
