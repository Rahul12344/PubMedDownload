rift valley fever (rvf) zoonotic disease endemic africa arabian
peninsula caused highly infectious rift valley fever virus (rvfv) can
be lethal humans animals results major losses livestock
industry. rvf exotic united states; however, mosquito species native to
this region serve biological vectors virus. thus, accidental or
malicious introduction virus could result rvfv becoming endemic in
north america. event would likely lead significant morbidity and
mortality humans, devastating economic effects livestock industry. 
currently, licensed vaccines rvf safe and
efficacious. address issue, developed two recombinant rvfv vaccines
using vaccinia virus (vacv) vector use livestock. first vaccine, 
vcogngc, attenuated deletion vacv gene encoding ifn-γ binding 
protein, insertional inactivation thymidine kinase gene, expression of
rvfv glycoproteins, gn gc. second vaccine, vcogngcγ, identical 
first also expresses human ifn-γ gene enhance safety. vaccines
are extremely safe; neither resulted weight loss death severe combined 
immunodeficient mice, pock lesions smaller baboons compared 
controls. furthermore, vaccines induced protective levels antibody titers
in vaccinated mice baboons. mice protected lethal rvfv challenge.
thus, developed two safe efficacious recombinant vaccines rvf.
