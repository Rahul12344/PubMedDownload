we reported previously altering rhythm environmental temperature
(art) physiological mechanism changed abnormal state we
termed specific art-stress (sart-stress). present report, effects of
neurotropin tranquilizers sart-stress state investigated. 
neurotropin extract containing many conjugated polysaccarides isolated from
the skin tissues rabbits inoculated living cowpox
virus. neurotropin prevented decrease body weight mice rats
caused sart-stress. however, prevention extract 
isolated vaccinia virus-uninjured, healthy rabbit skin given.
chlorpromazine (cp), reserpine (rp), diazepam (dz), imipramine diphenhydramine
gave protection decrease body weight. slight increase number
and variation respirations sart-stress animals extent prevented
by neurotropin. prolongation qrs interval restored control the
administration mentioned drugs. decrease ach sensitivity the
isolated duodenum tested magnus-method prevented neurotropin. in
the galvanic skin response test rats, decrease electric resistance the
skin, increase reactivity shortening reaction time caused by
sart-stress prevented greatest extent neurotropin also a
considerable degree parenteral administration dz beta-hydroxy
gamma-aminobutyric acid (gabob), effective results drugs being:
neurotropin, dz, gabob order. cp rp, major tranquilizers found
to least effective.
