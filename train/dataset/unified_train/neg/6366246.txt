outer membrane protein tona, receptor coliphage t5, partially
purified incorporated phospholipid bilayer liposomes. adsorption 
of phage receptor either free liposome-associated form fast
and sufficient trigger ejection encapsidated dna. vitro
systems exit dna phage capsid slow process. ejected dna
can partially accumulate inside liposome aqueous compartment, the
transfer phage head liposome internal space never complete,
perhaps liposome volume small. presence polyamines or
divalent cations (magnesium) incubation medium diminished the
extent dna ejection, possibly stabilizing dna inside head. dna movement
was slowed temperature decreased 37 18 degrees c. furthermore,
incubation 4 degrees c totally prevented dna movement, even large
part dna already exited capsid.
