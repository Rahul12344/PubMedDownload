retinoids, family molecules capable profound impact many biological
functions, antiproliferative, differentiative, immunomodulatory
properties. present study assessed effect 13-cis-retinoic acid
(13-cra) treatment 13 chronic cervicitis 52 cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia patients. examined low- high-risk human papilloma virus titer
(using hybrid capture method) made colposcopic cervicographic
examination treatment 13-cra 1 mg/kg 4 12 weeks. 
patients 27 64 years, average age 36.6 years.
histology revealed chronic cervicitis 13 cases, mild dysplasia 18 cases,
moderate dysplasia 18 cases, severe dysplasia 16 cases, totaling 65
cases. expression rate high-risk human papilloma virus (hpv 16, 18) 9 
of 13 cases (69%) chronic cervicitis, 7 18 cases (38%) mild dysplasia, 9
of 18 cases (50%) moderate dysplasia, 12 16 cases (75%) severe
dysplasia, overall expression rate 37 65 cases (57%). following
13-cra treatment, decreases high-risk titer observed 6 9 cases
(66%) chronic cervicitis, 4 11 cases (36%) mild dysplasia, 7 9 cases 
(77%) moderate dysplasia, 8 12 cases (75%) severe dysplasia.
overall, hpv titer decreased 25 41 cases (61%). minimal changes found 
in colposcopic cervicographic observations study. summary,
high-risk hpv titer decreased treatment 13-cra majority of
patients cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. study supports the
potential retinoids interrupt multi-step carcinogenesis, possibly by
down-regulation gene products (e6,e7) produced hpv infection.
