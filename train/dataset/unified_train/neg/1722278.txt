reactivation herpes simplex virus (hsv) assumed dependent on
prostaglandin synthesis [kurane et al. (1984) j gen virol 65:1665-1674]. since
free radicals generated course prostaglandin synthesis and
inhibitors prostaglandin synthesis free radical scavengers, question
arose whether free radicals important viral reactivation. therefore, 
the influence five different inhibitors prostaglandin synthesis was
compared activity two combinations classical radical scavengers.
since efficiency groups compounds similar, role free
radicals viral reactivation strongly assumed, whereas role of
prostaglandins revisited. drugs tested effective early 
phase explantation latently infected ganglia could omitted in
the later stages co-cultivation. free radicals suspected activating 
nuclear factors, interest confirm enhancement hsv
reactivation dna hypomethylating drugs. 5-azazytidine proved more
effective dimethylsulfoxide (dmso). effect combinations dmso 
inhibitors prostaglandin synthesis dependent mode action 
inhibitors.
