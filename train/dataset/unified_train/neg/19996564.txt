flavivirus-infected sera known show cross-reactions serodiagnoses of
heterologous flavivirus infections. japanese encephalitis virus (jev) endemic 
in asia and, japan, many horses vaccinated jev. however, the
cross-reactivity level jev-vaccinated horse sera serodiagnosis west 
nile virus (wnv) clarified. antibody cross-reactivity of
jev-vaccinated horse sera wnv serological tests, plaque reduction 
neutralization test (prnt), igg indirect elisa (igg-elisa) hemagglutination
inhibition (hi) test, examined. jev-vaccinated horse sera positive
for jev antibodies jev prnt 90% 50% plaque reductions. wnv
prnt, 16.7% horses positive 90% plaque reduction, 50% the
horses positive 50% plaque reduction. jev-vaccinated horse sera
showed positive-to-negative (p/n) ratios 2.0 jev igg-elisa, half
of p/n ratios 2.0 wnv igg-elisa. little
difference jev hi wnv hi titers individual horses. these
results indicate serosurveillance wnv, jev-vaccinated horses can
produce false-positive results wnv igg-elisa, hi prnt.
