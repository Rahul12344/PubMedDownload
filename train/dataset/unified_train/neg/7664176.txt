2',5'as activity present t-lymphocyte fraction. day 7, enzyme
activity highest b-lymphocyte fraction. virus-neutralizing antibodies 
appeared day 7, igm antibodies present day 12. second
immunization, performed 2 years +/- 2 months later, significant increase
in 2',5'as activity observed t-lymphocyte fraction. virus-neutralizing
antibodies present day 1, whereas igm antibodies detected. by
day 12, 80% vaccines igg positive. primary secondary
