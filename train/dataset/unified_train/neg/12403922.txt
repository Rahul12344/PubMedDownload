background: patients chronic haemodialysis (pchd) elicit weaker response 
to vaccination recombinant hepatitis b virus surface antigen (hbsag), we
conducted study see dialysis efficacy affects response hepatitis b
virus (hbv) vaccination.
methods: study subjects consisted 30 pchd. subjects vaccinated 4
x 40 microg hbsag i.m. 0, 1, 2, 6 months. subject hbsag
antibody (hbsab) level <10 iu/l vaccination, received booster
dose. subjects divided groups according level hbsab:
non-responders (<10 iu/l), weak responders (10-100 iu/l), good responders
(>100 iu/l).
results: group responders significantly efficient dialysis
(kt/v) group non-responders (p = 0.027). difference not
observed groups non-responders weak responders. group good 
responders significantly better kt/v group non-responders (p = 
0.012). good responders significantly better kt/v weak responders (p =
0.019). kt/v values showed significantly positive correlation hbsab
level (r = 0.47; p = 0.006).
conclusions: hbv vaccination reaction weaker pchd inefficient
dialysis. efficient haemodialysis significantly improves response to
vaccination recombinant hbsag.
