expression human immunodeficiency virus tat-encoded protein (tat) is
required virus replication. genetic approach used facilitate the
purification biologically active tat. recombinant tat protein containing a
stretch six histidine residues protease cleavage site engineered and
purified greater 95% homogeneity single step immobilized
metal-ion chromatography special affinity resin selectivity for
proteins neighboring histidine residues. modified scrape loading method
for introduction protein cell monolayers used demonstrate the
purified tat retained biological activity. tat function completely blocked in
the presence transcription inhibitors, demonstrates requirement of
ongoing mrna synthesis trans-activation. studies indicate the
mechanism trans-activation unlikely involve direct action tat on
mrna stability, transport, translation provides basis rapid
assay used identify inhibitors trans-activation. methods
described herein useful functional analysis proteins
that confer activity receptor-mediated pathway.
