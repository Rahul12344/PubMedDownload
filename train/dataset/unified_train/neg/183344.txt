studied interrelationship aujeszky's disease virus (the
avirulent mutant strain mk virulent strain 2) chick embryo cells
during cultivation without 5-iod-2-desoxiuridine. experiments with
the virulent strain presence granular antigen could observed the
4th hour following infection nucleus. 10th hour antigen 
showed migration nucleus toward cytoplasm. 24th hour a
complete destruction cellular monolayer observed, along the
production polynuclear cells. experiments strain mk antigen
seemed appear first cytoplasm 10th hour infecting the
cells, 12th hour found nucleoplasm too. case 
full destruction cells set 48th hour infection. the
cultivation strain mk cell cultures containing 5-iod-2-desoxiuridine no
disturbances normal cycle reproduction observed. virus
replicated equally well without antimetabolite. the
cultivation virulent strain 2 cell cultures contained
5-iod-2-desoxiuridine coarse, granular antigen noticed cytoplasm 
single cells eighth hour infection. 12th hour nuclei
of cells manifested slight flourescence (hardly visible single granules).
after 48th hour nuclei involved cells swollen, the
cytoplasm presented slight, diffuse fluorescence, cells being
destroyed.
