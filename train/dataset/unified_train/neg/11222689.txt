cytotoxic lymphocytes (ctls) proposed critical protection from
intracellular pathogens ebola virus. however, no
demonstrations protection ebola virus mediated ebola
virus-specific ctls. here, report c57bl/6 mice vaccinated venezuelan
equine encephalitis virus replicons encoding ebola virus nucleoprotein (np)
survived lethal challenge ebola virus. vaccination induced antibodies
to np major histocompatibility complex class i-restricted ctl response 
to 11-amino-acid sequence amino-terminal portion ebola virus np.
passive transfer polyclonal np-specific antiserum protect recipient
mice. contrast, adoptive transfer ctls specific ebola virus np
protected unvaccinated mice lethal ebola virus challenge. protective
ctls cd8(+), restricted d(b) class molecule, recognized an
epitope within amino acids 43 53 (vyqvnnleeic) ebola virus np. the
demonstration ctls prevent lethal ebola virus infection affects vaccine 
development protective cellular immune responses may required for
optimal protection ebola virus.
