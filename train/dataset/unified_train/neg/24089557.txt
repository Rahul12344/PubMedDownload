cells productively infected hepatitis c virus (hcv) refractory to
a second infection hcv via block viral replication known as
superinfection exclusion. block occurs postentry step likely
involves translation replication secondary viral rna, mechanism
is largely unknown. characterize hcv superinfection exclusion, selected for
an hcv variant could overcome block. produced high-titer hc-j6/jfh1
(jc1) viral genome fluorescent reporter inserted ns5a ns5b and
used infect huh7.5 cells containing jc1 replicon. multiple passages 
of infected cells, isolated hcv variant superinfect cells at
high levels. notably, superinfectious virus rapidly cleared primary
replicon superinfected cells. viral competition experiments, using novel
strategy sequence-barcoding viral strains, well superinfection of
replicon cells demonstrated mutations e1, p7, ns5a, poly(u/uc)
tract 3' untranslated region important superinfection.
furthermore, mutations dramatically increased infectivity virus 
in naive cells. interestingly, viruses shorter poly(u/uc) ns5a
domain ii mutation effective overcoming postentry block. neither
of changes affected viral rna translation, indicating major
barrier postentry exclusion occurs viral rna replication. evolution 
the ability superinfect less month culture concomitant
exclusion primary replicon suggest superinfection exclusion
dramatically affects viral fitness dynamics vivo.
