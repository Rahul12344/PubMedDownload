injecting drug use, mainly heroin, currently represents major public health 
issue north east scotland. recent tendency committed
injecting drug user inject groin created novel problems the
infection unit. data presented 20 consecutive patients admitted between
1994 1999 iliofemoral venous thromboses, often complicated severe
soft tissue infections bacteraemia result heroin injection the
femoral vein. nine coexistent groin abscesses, four severe streptococcal 
soft tissue infection right thigh, groin lower abdomen, two had
coincidental soft tissue infections upper limb. nine bacteraemic on
admission. patients chronic injecting drug users median
injection duration 6.5 years. 18 patients tested hepatitis c virus
were seropositive. none 14 patients tested positive hiv.
seventeen patients treated subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin
(tinzaparin), three received intravenous unfractionated heparin initially.
the tinzaparin self administered given median duration seven
weeks. one patient declined treatment. three months after
presentation eight patients asymptomatic, seven persistently swollen
leg, five lost follow up. none developed clinically apparent
pulmonary embolism institution anticoagulant therapy. management 
iliofemoral venous thrombosis injection drug users problematic of
poor venous access, non-compliance prescribed treatment, ongoing injecting
behaviour, coexistent sepsis. unlikely randomised trial of
standard treatment heparin warfarin versus low molecular weight heparin 
alone would practical patient group. retrospective data indicate
that use tinzaparin injecting drug users feasible appears to
result satisfactory clinical responses. possibility concomitant
infection injecting drug users venous thrombosis always be
addressed, appears common phenomenon. early drainage abscesses
and antimicrobial chemotherapy, often administered intramuscularly orally
because lack peripheral venous access, central appropriate care
of patients.
