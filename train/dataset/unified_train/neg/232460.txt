wilson el, reich e.

low concentrations vitamin stimulated plasminogen activator synthesis (pa)
in chick embryo fibroblasts (cef). caused dose dependent reversible
increase pa synthesis normal cef cef infected temperature
sensitive mutant rous sarcoma virus (rsv-ts68). induction deinduction
of pa could inhibited actinomycin d. vitamin also accentuated the
morphological changes associated transformation rous sarcoma virus
infected cells. effects vitamin pa synthesis essentially similar
to known tumour promoter, phorbol myristate acetate (pma). both
vitamin pma found act synergistically sarcoma gene expression 
as far pa synthesis concerned.
