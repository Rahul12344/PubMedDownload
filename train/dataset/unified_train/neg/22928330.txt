the aphid amphorophora agathonica hottes (hemiptera: aphididae) important
virus vector red (rubus idaeus l.) black (rubus occidentalis l.)
raspberries north america. raspberry resistance a. agathonica form
of single dominant gene named ag1 relied upon help control
aphid-transmitted plant viruses; however, mechanism resistance the
insect poorly understood. aphid feeding monitored using electrical
penetration graph resistant red raspberry 'tulameen' compared a
susceptible control, 'vintage'. differences pathway feeding
behaviors aphids moved toward phloem. phloem, however,
aphids feeding resistant plants spent significantly time salivating 
on susceptible plants, ingested significantly less phloem sap. suggests 
that mechanism resistance a. agathonica located phloem.
reduced ingestion phloem may result inefficient acquisition viruses 
is likely explanation lack aphid-transmitted viruses plantings of
resistant cultivars.
