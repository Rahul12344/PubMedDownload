bacteriophage populations activated-sludge sewage treatment plant were
enumerated. newly developed assay quantitation total phages, employing
direct electron microscopic counts, used conjunction plaque
assay. total concentration phages significantly higher reactor
mixed liquor effluent influent sewage, indicating net production of
phages within reactor. maximum total phage concentrations fluid phase 
of sewage, activated-sludge mixed liquor, reactor effluent 2.2 x 10(7), 
9.5 x 10(7), 8.4 x 10(7)/ml, respectively. conditions optimized for
isolation predominant heterotrophic aerobic bacteria sewage mixed
liquor. blending ice water temperatures superior ultrasound enzyme
treatments maximum release viable bacteria microbial floc. a
solidified extract mixed liquor superior standard media cultivating
maximum numbers heterotrophic bacteria. highest culture counts sewage 
and mixed liquor 1.4 x 10(7) 1.3 x 10(9)/ml, respectively, which
represented 3 6.8% total microscopic cell counts. 3 of
48 dominant bacterial isolates either mixed liquor sewage hosts 
phages present system. sum phage populations infecting three 
hosts accounted for, best, 3.8% (sewage) 0.2% (mixed liquor) total 
number phages present. generally, specific phage titers lower mixed
liquor sewage, indicating hosts responsible the
net production phages reactor. study emphasizes limitations of
