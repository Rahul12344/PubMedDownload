the pathogenicity two granuloviruses (gvs), xestia c-nigrum gv (xecngv) and
pseudaletia unipuncta gv (psungv), examined mythimna separata. partial
sequencing genome psungv indicated related closely to
xecngv, considered different species. psungv xecngv showed
similar pathogenicity terms dose-mortality response pattern host
mass changes following infection. gvs killed infected larvae 2-3 weeks.
temporal changes concentrations gv-specific dna larval
haemolymph measured using real-time quantitative pcr. viral dna
concentration increased quickly reached plateau 60-72 h
post-inoculation. rates budded virus (bv) production gv estimated
on basis viral dna concentrations modified gompertz model. slopes
of estimated bv growth curves xecngv psungv m. separata larvae
were equivalent mamestra brassicae nucleopolyhedrovirus (npv) its
original host, reported previous study. suggested bv production 
is major factor slower killing speed gvs comparison npvs.
the gv-infected larvae survived additional 10 days reaching 
a maximum level bv concentration, kept growing without pupation. these
findings also suggested gvs unique mechanism regulate the
growth host larvae.
