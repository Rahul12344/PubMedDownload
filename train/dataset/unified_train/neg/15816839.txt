the trigger initiating autoimmune response melanocytes vitiligo
remains unclear. patients frequently experience stress skin prior to
depigmentation. 4-tertiary butyl phenol (4-tbp) used model compound to
study effects stress melanocytes. heat shock protein (hsp)70 generated 
and secreted response 4-tbp quantified. protective potential of
stress proteins generated following 4-tbp exposure examined. studied
whether hsp70 favors dendritic cell (dc) effector functions well. melanocytes 
were sensitive 4-tbp fibroblasts, hsp70 generated response to
4-tbp exposure partially released medium immortalized vitiligo
melanocyte cell line pig3v. stress protein hsp70 turn induced membrane tumor
necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (trail) expression and
activation dc effector functions towards stressed melanocytes. melanocytes
exposed 4-tbp demonstrated elevated trail death receptor expression. dc
effector functions partially inhibited blocking antibodies trail.
trail expression infiltration cd11c+ cells abundant perilesional
vitiligo skin. stressed melanocytes may mediate dc activation release 
hsp70, dc effector functions appear play previously unappreciated role
in progressive vitiligo.
