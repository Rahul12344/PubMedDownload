liver transplantation using grafts donors antibody hepatitis b 
core antigen (anti-hbc) increases recipients' risk developing hepatitis b 
virus (hbv) infection post-transplantation. aim assess whether using
such grafts associated reduced posttransplantation survival whether 
this association depended recipients' prior exposure hbv basis of
their pretransplantation serological patterns. data derived united 
network organ sharing adult, cadaveric, first-time liver transplants
performed 1994 2006. among recipients hbv infection 
before transplantation, anti-hbc-positive donors significantly
worse unadjusted posttransplantation patient survival recipients with
anti-hbc-negative donors [hazard ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval (ci),
1.21-1.50]. however, adjustments predictors of
posttransplantation survival, including donor age, donor race, recipient
underlying liver diseases, patient survival significantly different
between 2 groups (hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% ci, 0.97-1.24). among recipients
without antibody hepatitis b surface antigen (anti-hbs), use of
anti-hbc-positive donor grafts associated trend toward worse survival 
(adjusted hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% ci, 0.95-1.46), whereas trend was
observed among recipients positive anti-hbs. conclusion, patients
without hbv infection transplantation, using anti-hbc-positive donors 
not independently associated worse posttransplantation survival. matching
these donors recipients anti-hbs pre-transplantation may especially
safe.
