outer membrane beta-barrel proteins gram-negative bacteria, as
escherichia coli, must translocated site synthesis the
cytoplasm periplasm finally delivered outer membrane. least 
a dozen proteins located cytoplasm, periplasm, inner 
outer membranes required catalyze complex assembly process. normal
growth temperatures conditions transport assembly processes so
fast assembly intermediates cannot detected. using cells grown low
temperature slow assembly process pulse-chase analysis with
immunodetection methods, followed newly synthesized lamb molecules during
their transit cell envelope. quality reproducibility the
data allowed us calculate rate constants three different subassembly
reactions. kinetic analysis revealed secb secd mutants exhibit
nearly identical defects precursor translocation cytoplasm. however, 
subsequent subassembly reaction rates provided clear evidence an
additional role secd lamb assembly. moreover, found sura mutants
are qualitatively indistinguishable yfgl mutants, suggesting the
products genes share common function assembly process, 
most likely delivery lamb yaet assembly complex outer
membrane.
