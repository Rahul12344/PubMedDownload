in order study regulation human b cell response pneumococcal
polysaccharides (pps), anti-pps-secreting cells (sc) ig-sc quantitated
in unstimulated ebv-stimulated cultures blood mononuclear cells (mnc)
established one two weeks vaccination. unstimulated
cultures established one week vaccination, significant numbers of
anti-pps-sc detected; however, observed cultures depleted 
of cells (mean: 62/10(6)), suggesting presence cells suppressing in
vivo-activated pps-specific b cells. ebv-stimulated cultures depleted t
cells, low numbers anti-pps-sc observed vaccination, the
numbers cells increased significantly two weeks immunization
(from 28 48/10(6)). contrast, numbers anti-pps-sc total ig-sc
decreased ebv-stimulated cultures unseparated mnc established the
vaccination, suggesting cell-mediated suppression. findings not
explained changes numbers blood helper (leu 3+) suppressor
