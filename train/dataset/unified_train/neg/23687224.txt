background: microbial translocation implicated pathogenesis of
liver fibrosis cirrhosis. sought determine whether markers microbial
translocation associated liver disease progression coinfection
with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) hepatitis c virus (hcv).
methods: measured serial plasma lipopolysaccharide (lps), endotoxin core
antibody, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (i-fabp), soluble cd14 (scd14),
interleukin 6 (il-6), interleukin 10, tumor necrosis factor α (tnf-α) levels 
over 5-year period 44 hiv/hcv-coinfected women, 21 experienced liver
disease progression 23 nonprogressors.
results: lps levels differ significantly time between
progressors nonprogressors (p = .60), progressors significantly higher
plasma levels scd14, marker monocyte activation lps, first time
point measured (p = .03) throughout study period (p = .001); progressors 
also higher il-6 i-fabp levels 5-year study period (p = .02 
.03, respectively). associations progression scd14, i-fabp, and
il-6 levels unchanged models controlling hiv rna cd4(+) t-cell
count.
conclusions: although lps levels differ liver disease progressors
and nonprogressors, association scd14, i-fabp, il-6 levels liver 
disease progression suggests impairment gut epithelial integrity and
consequent microbial translocation may play role complex interaction 
hiv hcv pathogenesis.
