most hiv-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies directed gp120 subunit
of env surface protein. native env consists trimer gp120-gp41
heterodimers, contrast monomeric gp120, preferentially binds cd4
binding site (cd4bs)-directed neutralizing antibodies non-neutralizing ones.
some cryo-electron tomography studies suggested v1v2 loop regions
of gp120 located close trimer interface. therefore designed
cyclically permuted variants gp120 without h-cmp sumo2a
trimerization domains inserted v1v2 loop. h-cmp-v1cyc one such
variant residues 153 142 n- c-terminal residues,
respectively, cyclically permuted gp120 h-cmp fused n-terminus. 
this molecule forms trimer native conditions binds cd4 the
neutralizing cd4bs antibodies b12 significantly higher affinity than
wild-type gp120. binds non-neutralizing cd4bs antibody f105 lower
affinity gp120. similar derivative, h-cmp-v1cyc1, bound v1v2
loop-directed broadly neutralizing antibodies pg9 pg16 âˆ¼20-fold higher
affinity wild-type jrcsf gp120. cyclic permutants gp120 are
properly folded potential immunogens. data also support env models in
which v1v2 loops proximal trimer interface.
