incorporation hpv testing cervical screening anticipated robust
methods dna extraction liquid based cytology (lbc) samples required.
this study compared qiaamp extraction proteinase k digestion developed
methods address dna extraction failure (β-globin pcr negative) clinical
specimens. proteinase k qiaamp extraction methods paired lbc samples 
comparable adequate dna retrieved 93.3% clinical specimens. hpv
prevalence cohort (n=10,000) found 7% (n=676) lbc samples tested negative for
β-globin, classified inadequate. 'failure' rate unsuitable
for population screening, particularly sampling method intrusive.
379/676 samples assessed determine cause test failure. re-testing 
confirmed adequate dna 21.6% original extracts; re-extraction from
stored material identified 56.2% samples contained adequate material; dilution to
overcome sample inhibition (1:10) resolved 51.7% cases original extracts and
28% new extracts. standardised approach hpv testing optimal dna
concentration input rather standard volume input recommended. samples
failing initial dna extraction repeat extracted assessed sample
inhibition reduce 7% hpv tests reported inadequate reduce 
the need retesting women <1%.
