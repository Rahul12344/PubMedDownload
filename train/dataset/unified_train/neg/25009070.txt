aim: first compare accuracy self-, physician-hpv testing via as
standalone screening tests; second compare accuracy self-hpv
positive test triaged via different standalone screening tests as
colposcopy histologically confirmed cin cervical cancer screening in
low-resource settings
methods: 1,601 women sharkya governerate, egypt concurrently received hpv dna 
testing [hybrid capture 2 (hc2) assay] self-collected physician-obtained 
samples, via. women tested positive hpv dna via received
colposcopy biopsy.
results: percentage women testing positive 84.8 % self-hpv, 87.8 % on
physician-hpv, 76.8 % via. test positivity increased screening
methods increasing severity histopathologic diagnosis. physician-hpv 
hpv testing self-sample showed good agreement hpv testing results
[Îº = 0.89 (95 % ci = 0.52-0.79)]; statistically significant variation 
age groups sensitivities hpv testing self-sample, physician-hpv
testing detecting cin2 cin3 lesions. conversely, via sensitivity lower
in detecting cin2 cin3 hpv testing self-sample decreased
significantly older age groups. hpv testing self-sample positive
combined via increases specificity 98.1 % cin2 99.4 % cin3,
and decreased colposcopy referral rate 2.5 %.
conclusion: hpv testing self-sample accurate via as
accurate clinician-hpv testing cervical cancer low-resource settings.
