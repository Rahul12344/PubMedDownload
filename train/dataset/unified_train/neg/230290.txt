the isolation mengo virus stable non-capsid polypeptides infected l cells
and preliminary characterization rna polymerase activity associated with
polypeptide e.

isolation mengo virus stable non-capsid virus polypeptides e, f, g i
from infected l cells achieved. unstable precursors eliminated by
incubation presence pactamycin capsid polypeptides removed 
ultracentrifugation affinity chromatography. subsequent sodium dodecyl
sulphate (sds)-hydroxylapatite chromatography resolved non-capsid proteins
into two major peaks comprised f plus g e plus i, respectively. the
individual polypeptide species separated gel filtration sephadex g-100
in presence sds. polypeptide e isolated undenatured form gel 
filtration infected cell extracts (from precursor capsid
polypeptides removed) bio-gel a-5m agarose beads. purified
polypeptide e found co-sediment mengo virion rna during
centrifugation sucrose density gradient also capable binding
to poly(a)-sepharose. assay mixtures containing polypeptide e exhibited rna
polymerase activity dependent upon exogenous virus rna template and
oligo(u) primer affected addition virus capsid
polypeptides extracts uninfected cells.
