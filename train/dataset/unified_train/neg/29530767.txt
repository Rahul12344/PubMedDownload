epstein-barr virus (ebv)-related post-transplantation lymphoproliferative
disorders (ebv-ptlds) rare potentially fatal complications allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-hsct), characterized by
uncontrolled proliferation ebv-infected lymphocytes. common risk
factors include cell depletion graft, hla mismatch, severe graft-versus-host
disease (gvhd), ebv seromismatch (recipient-negative/donor-positive), among
others. ebv-ptlds commonly manifest fever lymphadenopathy may rapidly 
progress multiorgan failure even death. histopathological evidence is
indispensable diagnosis, positive findings ebv-dna (ebv-dnaemia)
and imaging also helpful. active prophylaxis, optimization of
the donor choice, conditioning regimen, gvhd prevention, passive
prophylaxis, low dose rituximab, unselected donor lymphocyte infusion 
(dli), ebv-specific cytotoxic lymphocyte (ebv-ctls) infusion, decrease 
the incidence ebv-dnaemia. rituximab- based preemptive treatment prevent
ebv-dnaemia developing ebv-ptlds, particularly benefiting recipients
with higher loads ebv-dna, although long-term outcome been
significantly improved. date, consensus whether 
initiate prophylactic preemptive treatment. current treatment strategies
for probable proven ebv-ptlds include reduction immunosuppression (ri),
rituximab, adoptive cell therapy (dli ebv-ctls), chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
and surgery, among rituximab plus ri mainstay. however, the
mortality ebv-ptlds remains considerably high, novel strategies merit
exploration.
