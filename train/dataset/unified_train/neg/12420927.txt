a new method study pathogen transport porous media presented.
the method based conjugation fluorescent dyes target bacteriophages
and application modified bacteriophages tracer studies. demonstrate
that relevant transport determining properties rhodamine several
fluorescein-labeled phages practically identical native
bacteriophages. advantages proposed method relative direct
enumeration bacteriophages plaque forming unit method, turbidity,
fluorescent microspheres, alternative tracers discussed. notable
advantages include simple quantitation optical methods, unbiased signals even 
when virus aggregates formed, ability decouple inactivation
kinetics transport phenomena. additionally, signal reflects removal 
and transport studied microorganism surrogate.
