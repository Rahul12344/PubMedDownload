sequences 3' ends plus-strand rna viruses associated subviral
rnas important cis elements synthesis minus strands vivo in
vitro. rnas associated turnip crinkle virus (tcv), including genomic
rna (4,054 bases) satellite rnas (sat-rnas) sat-rna (194 bases),
terminate motif ccugccc. investigating ability in
vivo-generated recombinants sat-rna tcv amplified plants, 
we discovered sat-rna d, although truncated many 15 bases the
chimeric molecules, released chimeric transcripts amplified to
high levels. "new" sat-rna molecules nearly terminated motif
(c1-2)ug(c1-3) (which may begin 1 2 cytosines end 1, 2, 3
cytosines), similar identical natural sat-rna 3' end. the
new sat-rna also contained 1 22 bases heterogeneous sequence
upstream terminal motif, which, cases, apparently derived
from internal regions either plus minus strand tcv genomic rna. 
since internal genomic rna sequences within tcv adjacent
to (c1-2)ug(c1-3), least two steps required produce new sat-rna 3'
ends: nonhomologous recombination tcv genomic rna followed the
addition modification terminus generate (c1-2)ug(c1-3) motif.
