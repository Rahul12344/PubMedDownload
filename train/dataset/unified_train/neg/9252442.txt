volume-sensitive cl- channels [icl(vol)] studied using taurine efflux and
patch-clamp experiments 9hteo- human tracheal cells. cells stimulated
with ca(2+)- elevating agents atp ionomycin isotonic medium in
hypotonic solutions. atp (100 microm) ionomycin (1 microm) hypotonic shock
produced synergic effect. indeed, resulting taurine efflux much higher 
than sum single effects elicited atp, ionomycin, hypotonic
medium. taurine release elicited hypotonic shock potentiation by
atp ionomycin markedly inhibited using ca(2+)-free extracellular
medium incubating cells membrane-permeable 1,2-bis(2-amino-
phenoxy)ethane-n,n,n',n'-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester chelating agent.
patch-clamp experiments confirmed role ca2+ icl(vol) channels.
swelling-induced taurine efflux inhibited reactive blue 2, suramin, and
pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid. patch-clamp experiments
demonstrated compounds shift voltage-dependent inactivation of
icl(vol) channels toward negative values. study indicates the
sensitivity icl(vol) cell volume changes modulated intracellular ca2+
and purinergic receptor antagonists represent new class ci- channel
blockers.
