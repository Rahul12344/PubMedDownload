background: alpha-interferons accepted therapy patients infected with
chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) china. however, consensus interferon (cifn)
for hcv treatment effective patients chronic hepatitis c western 
countries.
methods: randomized, controlled trial conducted determine safety 
and efficacy cifn two doses, compare alpha-2a-interferon
(ifn-alpha-2a) chinese patients chronic hcv. interferon-naive patients
with chronic hcv infection (n = 187) randomly chosen receive 15 microg
cifn 9 microg 3 mu ifn-alpha-2a subcutaneously, three times week 24
weeks, followed 24 week observation period. efficacy evaluated the
normalization serum alanine aminotransferase (alt) non-detectability
disappearance serum hcv-rna using reverse-transcription-polymerase chain
reaction. safety cifn evaluated recording type severity 
adverse effects.
results: combined alt hcv-rna end-of-treatment sustained responses
were observed greater treatment 15 microg cifn (59.0% 55.7%,
respectively) compared ifn alpha-2a (36.1% 39.3%, respectively; p = 0.01
for end-of-treatment, p = 0.07 sustained response). combined alt 
and hcv-rna end-of-treatment sustained responses treatment 9 microg 
cifn (both 49.2%) higher ifn-alpha-2a (not statistically
significant). data analyzed using logistic-multiple-variate regression 
model, indicated higher ifn dose (15 microg 9 microg cifn vs 3 
mu ifn-alpha-2a; p < 0.01) appeared associated better sustained
response. type, frequency severity adverse effects comparable
across treatment groups.
conclusions: consensus interferon appears safe effective at
concentrations 9 15 microg, 15 microg cifn may effective 
3 mu ifn-alpha-2a, without increased toxicity.
