previous studies classified env sequences bovine leukemia virus (blv)
provirus different locations worldwide two four genetic
groupings. different studies gave unique names identified groups and
no study yet integrated available sequences. thus, hypothesized
that many different groups previously identified actually correspond 
limited group genotypes unevenly distributed worldwide. examine
this hypothesis, sequenced env gene 28 blv field strains compared
these sequences 46 env sequences represent genetic groupings
already identified. using phylogenetic analyses, recovered six clades, or
genotypes, called genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 6. genotypes 1-5 
counterparts among sequence groupings identified previously. one env sequence
did cluster others highly divergent compared
with six genotypes identified here. thus, extra genotype, named
7, may exist. similarity comparisons highly congruent phylogenetic
analyses. furthermore, analyses confirmed existence geographical
clusters.
