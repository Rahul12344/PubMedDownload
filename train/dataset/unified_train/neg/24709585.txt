the live attenuated japanese encephalitis (je) vaccine sa14-14-2 licensed
decades ago approved clinical use je endemic countries.
large-scale clinical trials demonstrate ideal safety efficacy profile this
chinese vaccine. sa14-14-2 vaccine derived virulent strain sa14
after hundreds serial passaging cells animals, concern virulence 
reversion remains exist. present study, study vitro vivo 
genetic attenuation stability vaccine virus, sa14-14-2 serially
passaged vero cells mouse brain followed sequence comparison and
attenuation phenotype analysis. results showed significant mutation
was acquired serial passaging vero cells except single ser66leu
mutation within capsid protein, effect viral virulence mice.
importantly, serial passaging sa14-14-2 suckling mouse brain resulted in
emergence adaptive mutations increased virulence mice. population and
plaque-purified clone consensus sequence analysis showed four adaptive mutations 
in envelope (e) protein, f107l, k138e, t226r i270t, sequentially occurred and
become predominant serial passaging suckling mouse brain. especially,
these adaptive mutations close related enhanced neurovirulence 
neuroinvasiveness mice. results provide experimental evidence highly
genetic attenuation stability sa14-14-2 following passaging vero cells,
and reveal potential virulence reversion passaging mouse brain in
association critical adaptive mutations e protein. findings are
important quality control evaluation live je vaccines help
understand attenuation mechanism flavivirus vaccine.
