objective: evaluate integrin-retargeted adenoviral vector could
establish efficient tumor-specific gene transfer esophageal
carcinoma cells.
summary background data: although preclinical data indicated adenoviral gene
therapy could promising novel treatment modality various malignancies,
clinical results often disappointing. important problem decreased
tumoral expression coxsackie adenovirus receptor (car), mediates
adenoviral entry. retargeting adenoviral vector cellular receptors, 
by inserting arginine-glycine-aspartate (rgd) tripeptide fiber knob,
might overcome problem.
methods: four esophageal carcinoma cell lines 10 fresh surgical resection
specimens cultured. infected native adenovirus (ad) and
the retargeted adenovirus (adrgd), encoding reporter genes luciferase 
green fluorescent protein analyze gene transfer efficiency.
results: cell lines, increase viral expression per cell an
increase percentage transduced cells seen retargeted
adenovirus. also, primary cultures carcinoma cells, efficient
gene transfer seen retargeted vector used. phenomenon was
less pronounced normal cells, indicating rgd virus transduces tumor
cells efficiently normal cells.
conclusions: study demonstrates rgd retargeted adenovirus infects
human esophageal carcinoma cells enhanced efficiency, normal
esophageal cells effect less pronounced. therefore, retargeted
vector expected better performance vivo, compared with
nonretargeted vectors used cancer gene therapy far.
