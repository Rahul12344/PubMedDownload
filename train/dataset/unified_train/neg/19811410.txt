comparing proteomic analyses quantitation gene expression. two-dimensional
(2d) difference gel electrophoresis used determine molecular
mechanisms underlying proteomic changes alter normal biological
processes monocyte-derived mature dendritic cells treated cocaine 
or methamphetamine. drugs differentially regulated expression several
functional classes proteins including modulate apoptosis, protein
folding, protein kinase activity, metabolism proteins function as
intracellular signal transduction molecules. proteomic data validated using 
a combination quantitative, real-time pcr western blot analyses. these
studies help identify molecular mechanisms, including expression 
of several functionally important classes proteins emerged as
potential mediators pathogenesis. proteins may predispose
immunocompetent cells, including dendritic cells, infection viruses 
as hcv hiv-1, associated drug abuse.
