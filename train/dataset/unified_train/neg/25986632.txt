lymphocytes provide gammaherpesviruses self-renewing substrate for
persistent infection transport mucosal sites host exit. their
role initial colonization new hosts less clear. murid herpesvirus 4 
(muhv-4), experimentally accessible, b-cell-tropic rhadinovirus (gamma-2
herpesvirus), persistently infects immunocompetent b-cell-deficient
mice. lack b-cells compromise muhv-4 entry lymphoid tissue,
which involved myeloid cell infection. however, impaired infection
amplification muhv-4 exit lymphoid tissue, involved myeloid to
b-cell transfer.
