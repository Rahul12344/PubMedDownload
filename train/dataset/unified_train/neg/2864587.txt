which anti-htlv iii/lav assays screening confirmatory testing?

mortimer pp, parry jv, mortimer jy.

in preparation routine anti-htlv-iii/lav testing uk five commercial
assays (a-e) evaluated using 360 sera selected clinical and
epidemiological grounds. comprised 220 specimens blood donors, 83
specimens patients high-risk groups, 57 specimens features
likely produce false-positive results. probably erroneous positive results
arose assay three categories assay b second third
categories. reactions much common specimens heated
to 56 degrees c 30 min. except anti-hla dr4,b5-containing serum was
repeatedly positive c, assays c, d, e apparently give rise to
false-positive results. results three assays also highly
reproducible. tests serum dilutions highest titres obtained by
assays d, assays c e discriminated clearly between
anti-htlv-iii/lav positive negative sera. two assays rapid and
convenient seemed particularly suitable testing blood donations. assay 
was almost comparable performance difficult use. the
commercial assays c, e, antibody capture assay, simple
immunofluorescence test could basis methodologically diverse
national system primary confirmatory testing anti-htlv-iii/lav.
