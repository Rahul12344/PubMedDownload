background: internet-based surveillance systems monitor influenza-like illness
(ili) advantages traditional (physician-based) reporting systems, as
they potentially monitor wider range cases (i.e. including do
not seek care). however, requirement participants internet access
and actively participate calls question representativeness the
data. systems place number european countries 
last years, july 2009 extended uk. present
results survey aim assessing reliability data, and
to evaluate methods correct possible biases.
methods: internet-based monitoring ili launched near peak first
wave uk h1n1v influenza pandemic. compared recorded ili incidence
with physician-recorded incidence estimate true number cases
over course epidemic. also compared overall attack rates. the
effect using different ili definitions alternative denominator assumptions
on incidence estimates explored.
results: crude incidence measured internet-based system appears 
influenced individuals participated survey who
appeared likely ill. distorted overall incidence trend.
concentrating individuals reported results time series
of ili incidence matches trend case estimates reasonably closely,
with correlation 0.713 (p-value: 0.0001, 95% ci: 0.435, 0.867). indeed, 
internet-based system appears give better estimate relative height of
the two waves uk pandemic physician-recorded incidence. the
overall attack rate is, however, higher estimates, 16% when
compared model-based estimate 6%.
conclusion: internet-based monitoring ili capture trends case
numbers appropriate weighting used correct differential response.
the overall level incidence is, however, difficult measure. internet-based 
systems may useful adjunct existing ili surveillance systems they
capture cases necessarily contact health care. however, further
research required used accurately assess absolute
level incidence community.
