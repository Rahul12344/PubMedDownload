rotavirus common cause severe gastroenteritis children. known
that rotavirus gastroenteritis may accompanied neurological manifestations,
including encephalitis/encephalopathy seizures. report case a
4-year-old girl clinically mild encephalopathy reversible splenial
lesion associated rotavirus infection. admitted hospital
because reduced level consciousness, seizures, diarrhea, vomiting.
fecal rotavirus antigen testing positive. cell counts cerebrospinal
fluid (csf) normal. normal serum sodium level admission. brain 
computed tomography showed cerebral edema. however, electroencephalography
showed generalized high-voltage slow waves, diffusion-weighted magnetic
resonance imaging demonstrated transient abnormality splenium the
corpus callosum. diagnosed clinically mild encephalopathy reversible
splenial lesion associated rotavirus infection. recovered well and
exhibited neurological sequelae. rotavirus rna antigen detected
in csf, suggesting reversible splenial change caused indirect
effects central nervous system subsequent viral infection. normal
serum sodium level indicates change occur without hyponatremia.
