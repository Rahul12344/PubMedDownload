human herpes virus 6b (hhv-6b) widespread virus infects people
early infancy establishes chronic life-long infection periodic
reactivation. cd4 t cells implicated control hhv-6b, but
antigenic targets functional characteristics cd4 t-cell response are
poorly understood. identified 25 naturally processed mhc-ii peptides, derived 
from six different hhv-6b proteins, showed recognized cd4
t-cell responses hla-matched donors. peptides identified mass
spectrometry elution hla-dr molecules isolated hhv-6b-infected
t cells. peptides showed strong binding matched hla alleles elicited
recall t-cell responses vitro. t-cell lines expanded vitro used for
functional characterization response. responding cells mainly cd3+
cd4+ , produced ifn-γ, tnf-α, low levels il-2, alone combination,
highlighting presence polyfunctional t cells overall response. many
of responding cells mobilized cd107a, stored granzyme b, mediated
specific killing peptide-pulsed target cells. results highlight a
potential role polyfunctional cytotoxic cd4 t cells long-term control 
of hhv-6b infection.
