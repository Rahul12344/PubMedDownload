background: sarcoidosis inflammatory, granulomatous disorder unknown
etiology. role cellular humoral immune systems disease is
unclear, whereas dysregulation immune system suggested. patients with
sarcoidosis show diverse responses exposed various antigens. although
influenza vaccination recommended pulmonary sarcoidosis, efficacy and
safety investigated.
objectives:   evaluate safety immunogenicity influenza vaccine in
patients sarcoidosis.
patients/methods: influenza vaccination performed 23 eligible patients
with sarcoidosis (sp) 26 healthy controls (hc). antibody titers h1n1,
h3n2, b influenza virus antigens evaluated 1 month after
vaccination. patients followed 6 months assess vaccine safety.
results: serological response magnitude changes antibody titers against
influenza vaccine antigens comparable sps hcs. women showed a
better serological response b antigen (p = 0·034) men.
twenty-four-hour urine calcium associated antibody response h1n1
[correlation coefficient (cc) = 0·477, p = 0·003] h3n2 (cc = 0·352, p =
0·028) antigens. serum angiotensin-converting enzyme correlated negatively with
antibody response b antigen (cc = -0·331, p = 0·040). higher residual
volume associated fewer rises antibody titer h3n2 antigen (cc
= -0·377, p = 0·035). major adverse events disease flare-up observed
during follow-up.
conclusions: study, influenza vaccination cause major adverse
event sps, serological response equal hcs. studies with
larger sample size broader selection subjects could help validate the
results study.
