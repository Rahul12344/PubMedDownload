purpose: infectious uveitis entities usually rapidly progressive blinding
diseases prevented prompt administration specific antimicrobial
therapy. aim improving early diagnosis patients infectious
uveitis, intraocular fluid samples patients sight-threatening posterior
uveitis investigated determine causative agent.
methods: thirty-eight patients acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids) and
retinitis, eight immunosuppressed patients retinitis, 16 immunocompetent
patients acute retinal necrosis, 22 immunocompetent patients with
toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis analyzed polymerase chain reaction 
presence herpesviruses toxoplasma gondii dna local antibody
production microorganisms.
results: patients aids retinitis, polymerase chain reaction was
positive cytomegalovirus dna 21 (91%) 23 ocular fluid samples
obtained active cytomegalovirus retinitis, whereas local antibody
production analysis negative cases. acute retinal necrosis,
varicella-zoster virus herpes simplex virus could established the
inciting agent 81% cases, using combination techniques.
polymerase chain reaction positive samples obtained within two weeks
after onset disease. toxoplasma gondii dna detected 4 13 samples
(31%) immuno-competent patients active toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis;
in case, local antibody production also detected. contrast, local 
antibody production observed two three samples transplant
recipients positive t. gondii dna. control samples tested
were negative above-mentioned tests.
conclusions: patients aids, polymerase chain reaction analysis is
preferable local antibody production detecting inciting agent of
retinitis. cases, combination techniques make valuable
contribution diagnosis.
