the nucleocapsid flavivirus particles recognizable capsid
structure using icosahedral averaging cryo-electron microscopy structure
determinations. apparent absence definitive capsid structure could be
due lack synchronization symmetry elements external
glycoprotein layer core nucleocapsid not
have structure within particle. technique developed to
determine structure capsid, possibly also genome, for
icosahedral viruses, flaviviruses, using cryo-electron microscopy. the
method applicable analyses viral cores, also the
missing structure multi-component complexes due symmetry mismatches. the
density contributed external glycoprotein membrane layers, derived from
previously determined three-dimensional icosahedrally averaged reconstructions,
was subtracted raw images virus particles. resultant
difference images used three-dimensional reconstruction. after
appropriate test data sets constructed tested, procedure applied
to examine nucleocapsids flaviviruses, showed no
distinct protein density surrounding genome. furthermore, no
evidence icosahedral symmetry within nucleocapsid core.
