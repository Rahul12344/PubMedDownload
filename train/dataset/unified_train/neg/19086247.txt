the natural history oncogenic human papillomavirus (hpv) infections results
from interactions virus, host, multiple cofactors. studied 
association humoral immune response hpv smoking 191 hpv
infected women prospectively. two follow-up samples (first last) were
analysed serum cotinine levels, iga igg antibodies hpv16 18, and
chlamydia trachomatis using elisa methods. hpv dna analyses also performed, 
and hpv16/18 antibodies detectable 23 40 (57.5%) hpv dna-positive
women. performed age-stratified analyses found young smokers were
less likely develop hpv16/18 antibodies non-smokers (or: 0.2, 95% ci
0.0-0.9). furthermore, significantly decreased tendency maintaining
constant hpv16/18 igg antibody positivity end follow-up (or: 0.1,
95% ci 0.0-0.8). smoking affect development hpv antibody responses
in women 30 age. results suggest smoking may induce impaired
antibody response hpv16/18-infected young women.
