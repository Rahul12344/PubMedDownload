the authors propose therapy consisting constant dosage reverse
transcription inhibitor protease inhibitor achieve long-term
non-progressor (ltnp) status human immuno-deficiency virus (hiv) patients.
based authors analyses cytotoxic lymphocyte precursor (ctlp)
concentration several equilibrium points bifurcation these
equilibrium points, find administration drugs efficacy lower
than certain level induces higher ctlp concentration. result, drug doses
of moderate efficacy result patients ltnp status doses with
high efficacy. analyses controllability, show treatment of
moderate efficacy efficient one high efficacy terms of
controlling immune system. using simulations, demonstrate their
proposed method results ltnp status hiv patients.
