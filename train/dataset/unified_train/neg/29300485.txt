cell-based elisa (cellisa) widely used disease diagnosis due its
simplicity low cost. recently, peroxidase-like nanomaterials emerged 
promising systems cellisa applications. work, tobacco mosaic virus
(tmv) simultaneously tailored peroxidase-like inorganic nanoparticles
(platinum nanoparticles) cancer cell target groups (folic acid, fa) obtain
tmv-fa-pt nanoparticles cancer cell detection. induced uniformly
distributed reactive groups well-defined structure tmv particle,
platinum nanoparticles could grown situ exterior surface tmv with
excellent monodispersity uniform spatial distribution. meanwhile, fa a
peg1000 linker successfully conjugated coat proteins tmv through
the cu(i)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition reaction, efficient "click"
chemistry. study demonstrated resultant tmv-fa-pt specific
affinity cancer cells successfully used detect cancer cells through
cellisa. less 1.0 Ã— 104 cells/ml cancer cells could readily detected.
