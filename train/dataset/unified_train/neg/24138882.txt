toll-like receptor 7 (tlr7) triggers antiviral immune responses recognizing
viral single-stranded rna endosomes, biosynthetic pathway human
tlr7 (htlr7) remains unclear. here, show htlr7 proteolytically
processed c-terminal fragment selectively accumulates endocytic
compartments. htlr7 processing occurred neutral ph dependent on
furin-like proprotein convertases (pcs). furthermore, tlr7 processing was
required functional response to tlr7 agonists r837 influenza
virus. notably, proinflammatory differentiation stimuli increased the
expression furin-like pcs immune cells, suggesting positive feedback
mechanism tlr7 processing infection. self-rna under
certain conditions activate tlr7 trigger autoimmunity, results identify
furin-like pcs possible target attenuate tlr7-dependent autoimmunity 
other immune pathologies.
