reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (rt-lamp) was
applied detection equine influenza virus (eiv). equine
influenza caused currently eiv h3h8 subtype, rt-lamp primer set 
was designed target hemagglutinin gene subtype. detection
limit rt-lamp assay virus dilution 10(-5); 10(3) times 
more sensitive espline influenza a&b-n test 10 times sensitive 
than reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) assay. the
specificity rt-lamp assay examined using several equine pathogens
and nasal swabs collected horses fever 2010 eiv eradicated
in japan. cross-reactions observed. using 100 nasal swabs collected 
horses fever eiv outbreak 2007, rt-lamp assay detected eiv 
in 52 samples, whereas espline test rt-pcr assay detected eiv only
17 41 samples, respectively. results indicate rt-lamp assay is
specific eiv sensitive espline test rt-pcr assay.
because provides high sensitivity ease manipulation without need
for thermal cycler gel electrophoresis, rt-lamp assay be
applicable laboratory diagnosis eiv.
