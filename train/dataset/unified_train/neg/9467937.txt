the rb p16(ink4a) tumor suppressor genes function pathway cell
cycle control. previous evidence indicates p16(ink4a) gene is
transcriptionally repressed rb gene product, prb. study using
human ovarian cancer cell lines, found rb protein mrna expressed
at higher levels cell lines lacking p16 normal p16. since
this suggests potential role p16 regulating cellular level prb, we
studied effect wild-type p16(ink4a) expression rb gene.
introduction p16(ink4a), carried adenovirus vector, p16-negative
cell lines dramatically decreased expression rb protein mrna. nuclei
run-off assays demonstrated p16 expression induced transcriptional
downregulation rb gene. results indicate expression rb is
inversely regulated p16. findings reveal new dimension prb-p16
interaction implications p16(ink4a)-mediated gene therapy.
