the human herpesvirus 8 (hhv-8) latency-associated nuclear antigen (lana) is
expressed latently hhv-8 infected cells hhv-8-associated tumors,
including primary effusion lymphoma (pel). better understand contribution 
of lana tumorigenesis pel phenotype, performed yeast
two-hybrid screen identified corepressor protein sap30 lana
binding protein. sap30 constituent large multicomponent complex that
brings histone deacetylases promoter. glutathione s-transferase affinity
assays confirmed interaction lana sap30 also demonstrated
interactions lana two members corepressor complex,
msin3a cir. corepressors bound amino-terminal 340-amino-acid
domain lana. transient expression assays, domain lana mediated
repression targeted 5xgal4tk-cat reporter gal4-lana fusion. pel
cells unusual feature frequently dually infected both
hhv-8 epstein-barr virus (ebv). found ebv ebna-1 expression is
downregulated pel cells rna protein levels. transient
expression assays, lana repressed activated expression ebv qp cp
latency promoters. reduction endogenous qp activity could also demonstrated
in ebv-infected rael cells transfected lana expression plasmid. in
contrast effect lana ebv latency promoters, lana activated
expression promoter. data indicate lana mediate
transcriptional repression recruitment msin3 corepressor complex
and lana-mediated repression likely contribute low
level ebv latency gene expression seen dually infected pel cells.
