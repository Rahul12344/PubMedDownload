a competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) was
developed detect quantitate rna group rotaviruses. the
assay, 433 bp fragment amplified one-tube rt-pcr protocol using primers
with binding sites located highly conserved region segment 6 the
rotavirus genome. vitro synthesized rna 43-base deletion with
respect wild-type sequence fragment used internal
control. using transcripts templates, 10 rna molecules amplified
reproducibly detected ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels by
fluorimetry using sybr green dye real-time rt-pcr assay. the
efficiency protocol confirmed detection small amounts of
viral rna group rotaviruses clinical samples obtained various animal
species man.
