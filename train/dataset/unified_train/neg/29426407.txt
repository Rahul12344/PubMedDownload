after complete extinction wild european bison (bison bonasus) 
the beginning twentieth century, worldwide species population was
restored approximately 5500 individuals, species however remaining
endangered. despite numerous studies ecology genetics european
bison, threats infectious diseases largely unexamined. aim
of study screen exposure world's largest population of
european bison pathogens, may influence condition and
development endangered species. total 240 free-ranging captive
european bison eight main polish populations sampled tested the
presence specific antibodies ten different viruses, bacteria or
protozoan. samples collected chemically immobilized, selectively
culled found dead animals. based serology, exposure bovine viral
diarrhea virus (bvdv), bovine herpesvirus type 1 (bohv-1), mycoplasma and
brucella spp. determined rather accidental. using gamma-interferon assay
followed mycobacterium tuberculosis subs. caprae detection tissues,
diagnosis bovine tuberculosis made 6 78 (7.7%) bison one
captive herd. highest seroprevalence found bovine adenovirus type 3
(badv-3) -60.2% bovine parainfluenza type 3 (piv-3) -34.0%, the
antibodies bovine respiratory syncytial virus (brsv), toxoplasma gondii
and leptospira spp. found 10.4%, 10.4% 8.7% samples, respectively.
in multivariable statistical analysis using generalized linear mixed models
(glmms), risk factors piv-3 seropositivity included population type
(free-living/captive), age health status (apparently healthy/eliminated due
to poor condition). higher risk badv-3 seropositive result observed in
free-living female european bison. high badv-3 piv-3 seroprevalences may 
suggest involvement pathogens frequently observed
respiratory disorders european bison. moreover, first study
demonstrating badv-3 exposure species.
