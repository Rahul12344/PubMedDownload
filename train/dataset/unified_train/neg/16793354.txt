aims: aim present study evaluate pulmonary alterations in
patients chronic hepatitis c virus infection.
patients: twenty-one patients chronic hepatitis c virus infection were
enrolled prospective study. one patient excluded of
underlying tuberculosis.
methods: patients underwent pulmonary function tests, diffusion capacity 
carbon monoxide high-resolution computed tomography chest.
results: forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume first second/forced
vital capacity forced expiratory volume first second values reduced
to less 80% predicted values 3, 11 5 patients, respectively.
diffusion capacity carbon monoxide low 12 patients (60%), 8 whom
had simultaneous decrease diffusion capacity carbon monoxide/va values.
thorax high-resolution computed tomography revealed abnormal findings eight
patients (40%). fifteen patients chronic hepatitis c virus infection (75%)
had least one pulmonary alteration evidenced abnormal pulmonary function
tests, diffusion capacity carbon monoxide and/or high-resolution computed
tomography results.
conclusion: spite limited study population, findings may implicate 
that pulmonary manifestations chronic hepatitis c virus infection are
frequently underdiagnosed.
