the mammalian tick-borne flavivirus group (mtbfg) contains viruses associated
with important human animal diseases encephalitis hemorrhagic
fever. contrast mosquito-borne flaviviruses recombination events 
frequent, evolutionary dynamic within mtbfg believed be
essentially clonal. assumption challenged recent report of
several homologous recombinations within tick-borne encephalitis virus
(tbev). performed thorough analysis publicly available genomes this
group found compelling evidence previously identified
recombinations. however, results show first time demonstrable
recombination (i.e., large statistical support strong phylogenetic
evidences) occurred mtbfg, specifically within louping ill
virus lineage. putative parents, recombinant strains breakpoints further
tested statistical significance using phylogenetic methods. investigated
the time divergence recombinant parental strains bayesian
framework. recombination estimated occurred window of
282 76 years present. unravelling temporal setting the
event, adduce hypotheses ecological conditions could account
for observed recombination.
