the presence human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) bearing mutations
resistant nucleosidic inhibitors viral reverse transcriptase (rt)
derived hiv-seropositive asymptomatic untreated volunteer blood donors
was examined. rt amplicons 32 specimens analyzed using reverse
hybridization line probe assay technique detects resistance against
zidovudine (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine [azt], didanosine (2',3'-dideoxyinosine
[ddi], zalcitabine (2',3'-dideoxycytidine [ddc]), lamivudine
((-)-beta-l-2',3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine [3tc]) amino acid positions 41, 69, 
70, 74, 184, 215 hiv rt. one sample (brp004, subtype b) showed azt 
resistance secondary mutation position k70r. fifteen specimens revealed one or
more sites nonreactivity wild-type- mutant-specific probes (dual
nonreactivity). samples also submitted rt direct sequencing and
phylogenetic analysis. nine 32 specimens belonged non-b subtypes (c, d, f, 
and f/b b/f mosaics). three non-b isolates, named brp004, brp063, and
brp069, revealed three relevant azt resistance mutations-a t215f mutation
and two m41l mutations, respectively-hidden nonreactivity line probe
assay strips respective codon regions. isolate brp004 also carried a
d67n azt resistance mutation revealed direct sequencing. nonnucleosidic rt 
inhibitor-resistant mutation found. analysis revealed frequency 2.26
x 10(-4) mutations per nucleotide independent samples related rt
resistance. findings emphasize magnitude naturally occurring
reservoirs drug-resistant virus among untreated hiv-1-positive individuals 
brazil.
