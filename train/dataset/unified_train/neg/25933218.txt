background objective: inhibitors apoptosis proteins (iaps) well 
investigated human cancers, frequently overexpressed and
associated poor prognosis. explored role baculoviral iap
repeat containing 6 (birc6), member iaps, human colorectal cancer (crc).
methods: used western blotting immunohistochemistry examine birc6
expression 7 crc cell lines 126 crc clinical samples. determined the
biological significance birc6 crc cell lines lentivirus-mediated
silencing method.
results: reported birc6 overexpressed crc cell lines clinical 
crc tissues. birc6 overexpression correlated tumor size invasion
depth crc. birc6 overexpression associated worse overall survival (os)
(p = 0.001) shorter disease-free survival (dfs) (p = 0.010). birc6 knockdown 
inhibited cell proliferation, arrested cell cycle phase, downregulated
cyclin a2, b1, d1 e1 levels, sensitized crc cells chemotherapy in
vitro vivo.
conclusions: taken together, data suggests birc6 overexpression a
predictor poor prognosis colorectal cancer birc6 could potential
target crc therapy.
