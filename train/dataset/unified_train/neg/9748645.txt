in order purify human phospholipase d1 (hpld1) analysis its
functional properties, applied baculovirus-based high-expression system. 
expected, sf9 cells infected baculovirus encoding hpld1 displayed 
a 7.5-fold increase pld activity compared uninfected cells. sf9 cells
infected wild-type (wt) recombinant baculoviruses used as
an expression control. surprisingly, baculoviruses tested led 3-5 fold
increase basal pld activity compared uninfected cells. further
characterize nature increased pld activity, influence of
adp-ribosylation factor (arf) phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (pma) was
studied. contrast membranes containing hpld1, pld activity in
membranes uninfected wt-infected sf9 cells stimulated arf.
pma affect increase pld activity case. study
whether virus-mediated increase pld activity general phenomenon,
we infected cos-7 cells recombinant wt adenoviruses. infection 
with wt adenovirus resulted approx. 2-fold increase pld activity.
our results demonstrate first time viral infection elevates the
pld activity insect mammalian cells.
