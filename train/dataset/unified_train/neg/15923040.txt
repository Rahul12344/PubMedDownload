ross river virus (rrv) mosquito-borne alphavirus indigenous australia and
the western pacific region responsible several thousand cases human
rrv disease (rrvd) per annum. disease primarily involves
polyarthritis/arthralgia, many patients also presenting rash, myalgia, 
fever, and/or lethargy. symptoms debilitating onset, they
usually resolve within 3-6 months. recent insights rrv-host
relationship, associated pathology, molecular biology infection have
generated number potential avenues improved treatment. although vaccine 
development proposed, small market size potential for
antibody-dependent enhancement (ade) disease make approach unattractive. 
recent insights molecular basis rrv-ade virus's ability to
manipulate host inflammatory immune responses create potential new
opportunities therapeutic invention. interventions overcome
virus-induced dysregulation protective host responses promote viral
clearance and/or ameliorate inflammatory immunopathology.
