is "conspiracy" work among viral pathogens? apparently, yes. rabies
virus, lenti- retroviruses, herpesviruses, "co-conspirators", target 
select members tumor necrosis factor (tnf) receptor superfamily invade 
the cells host. intrigue deepens, several reports revealed
that viral envelope proteins interact cellular tnf receptor a
highly conserved region previously unknown function. targeting region 
by diverse pathogens suggests selective advantage acquired. this
advantage might involve regulation immune response, recent
investigations herpesvirus entry receptor demonstrated conserved
region engages inhibitory co-receptor governing t-cell activation.
