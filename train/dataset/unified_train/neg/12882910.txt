zucker (fa/fa) rats defective leptin receptors obese, hyperphagic, and
hyperinsulinemic. testing whether chronic activation central
melanocortin pathway bypass defective leptin signaling normalize
altered energy homeostasis rats, recombinant adeno-associated virus
encoding pro-opiomelanocortin (raav-pomc) control vector delivered
bilaterally basal hypothalamus coordinates targeting arcuate
nucleus. thirty-eight days pomc gene delivery, hypothalamic pomc expression
increased fourfold melanocortin signaling (indicated phosphorylation of
creb) increased 62% respect controls. sustained reduction 
in food intake, moderate significant attenuation weight gain, 24% 
decrease visceral adiposity raav-pomc rats. pomc gene delivery enhanced
uncoupling protein 1 brown adipose tissue (bat) fourfold. fasting
serum leptin, insulin, cholesterol levels also significantly reduced 
raav-pomc treatment. study demonstrates targeted pomc gene delivery 
the hypothalamus suppresses food intake weight gain reduces visceral
adiposity hyperinsulinemia leptin-resistant obese zucker rats. the
mechanisms may involve sustained hypophagia augmentation of
thermogenesis bat.
