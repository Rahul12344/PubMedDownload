we develop flory mean-field theory viral rna (vrna) molecules extends 
the current rna folding algorithms include interactions different
sections secondary structure. theory applied sequence-selective 
vrna encapsidation. dependence sequence enters single parameter:
the largest eigenvalue kramers matrix branched polymer obtained 
coarse graining secondary structure. differences work of
encapsidation vrna molecules randomized isomers found 
range 20 kbt, sufficient provide strong bias favor vrna
encapsidation. method applied packaging competition experiment 
large vrna molecules compete encapsidation two smaller rna species 
together nucleotide sequence large molecule. encounter 
substantial, generic free energy bias, also order 20 kbt, in
favor encapsidating single large rna molecule. bias mainly the
consequence fact dividing large vrna molecule involves the
release stored elastic energy. provides important, nonspecific
mechanism preferential encapsidation single larger vrna molecules over
multiple smaller mrna molecules total number nucleotides. the
result also consistent recent rna packaging competition experiments by
comas-garcia et al.1 finally, flory method leads result two 
rna molecules copackaged, expected remain segregated inside the
capsid.
