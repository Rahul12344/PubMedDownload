the aim study verify suitability antituberculosis (antitb) 
drug-resistance surveillance tool tuberculosis (tb) control programmes
at local level. retrospective study reviewing laboratory records medical
records tb patients referred udine hospital 1981 1995 was
analysed. initial susceptibility pattern mycobacterium tuberculosis 
isolate recorded. found 1981 1995, 899 m.
tuberculosis strains underwent susceptibility testing four first-line drugs. 
over period 15 yrs annual number m. tuberculosis strains initially
decreased stabilized. overall, 15.3% 899 strains showed initial
resistance least one first-line drug, 2.8% two first-line
drugs. streptomycin-resistant strains commonly observed (10.8%),
with resistance isoniazid, rifampicin ethambutal shown 6.4, 1.0 
0.4%, respectively. multidrug resistant (mdr)-tb observed five cases.
an additional four cases eventually developed secondary mdr-tb the
follow-up. proportion resistant strains vary significantly over
time. recurrent tb disease significantly associated resistant strains
(odds ratio = 3.59, p < 0.01). one patient documented human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-positive serology. six patients developed
mdr-tb treatment, suffering either chronic alcoholism
or psychotic disorder. study shown recurrent
tuberculosis cases, tuberculosis patients behavioural problems (i.e.
alcoholism, psychiatric disorder) patients presenting primary resistant 
mycobacterium tuberculosis strains risk multidrug-resistant
tuberculosis may thus benefit directly observed treatment approach, 
which proposed mainstay tuberculosis control programme strategy.
