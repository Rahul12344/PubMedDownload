a highly sensitive nonradioactive method allows rapid detection of
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) products, without need hybridization with
oligonucleotide probes, described. method, 410-bp sequence the
human respiratory syncytial virus nucleocapsid cdna amplified pcr the
presence bromo-deoxyuridine-triphosphate, analog of
deoxythymidine-triphosphate. agarose gel electrophoresis southern
blotting, pcr product directly identified by
immunoenzyme-chemiluminescent reaction binding an
antibromodeoxyuridine antibody. results show substitution of
bromo-deoxyuridine-triphosphate deoxythymidine-triphosphate affect
the efficiency pcr, low one copy-equivalent target dna
sequence could detected within 2 hours, whereas required 1 5 days to
reach comparable sensitivity level hybridization 32p-labeled
oligonucleotide probe autoradiography. compared use of
digoxygenin-11-deoxyuridine-triphosphate, sensitivity detection was
100-fold higher use bromo-deoxyuridine-triphosphate. applied 
the diagnosis use reverse transcription-pcr respiratory syncytial virus 
infections nasopharyngeal washes children symptoms acute upper
respiratory tract infection, current method detected respiratory syncytial
virus genome 29 100 specimens, complete concordance with
the results hybridization reverse transcription-pcr products use a
radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe. thus, addition rapidity of
detection high sensitivity, method provides safety use be
readily applied clinical diagnosis viral respiratory tract infections.
