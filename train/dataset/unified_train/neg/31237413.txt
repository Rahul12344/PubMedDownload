recently, short beak dwarfism syndrome (sbds) sudden outbreak cherry
valley duck flocks, followed pekin ducks mule ducks various regions 
mainland china. widely spreading infectious disease characterized by
growth retardation, smaller beak tarsus high morbidity low mortality
rate. study, identified characterized virus domestic linwu
sheldrakes (namely hun18) sbds. hun18 isolates shared high nucleotide
identity novel goose parvovirus (n-gpv). 5110-nucleotide full-length
genome sequence hun18 found deletion itr region. alignment
studies hun18 showed 96.8%-99.0% identity n-gpvs 92.9%-96.3%
identity classic gpv. according recombination analysis, hun18 showed 
the potential major parent n-gpv sdlc01 strain, potential minor
parent classical gpv strain, secondary potential minor parent
was syg61v strain. best knowledge, first report 
n-gpv domestic linwu sheldrakes sbds; data provide evidence that
attenuated live viruses involved genetic recombination prevailing
wild parvoviruses, contributes novel emerging variants waterfowl 
parvoviruses.
