two groups adult boars inoculated field strain pseudorabies
virus (prv) intranasal droplet; one group given 5 x 10(5) median tissue
culture infective doses (tcid50), other, 5 x 10(6) tcid50. (a third group
was maintained controls.) ejaculates examined twice week volume,
sperm numbers, sperm morphology, presence prv. severe clinical disease
with fever followed administration larger virus dose. death (one boar),
testicular degeneration, transient elevation spermatozoa proximal
cytoplasmic droplets seen different members group. smaller
dose resulted seroconversion, produce signs disease. this
group, volume, sperm numbers, sperm morphology decline compared 
with base-line values data control animals. virus isolated from
semen. effects prv infection semen quality boars seem related to
the associated clinical signs systemic disease.
