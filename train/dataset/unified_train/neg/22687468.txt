cytochrome p450 (cyp) constitutes large gene superfamily descended a
single common ancestor. cyp genes widely distributed domains life
from bacteria, archaea, viruses higher plants animals. of
their monophyletic nature, cyp genes may hierarchically classified at
several distinct levels based similarity protein amino acid sequences. 
a five-level classification (class, group, clan, family, subfamily) is
reasonably stable useful conceptual categorization cyp genes. a
few exceptions, genes clan specific kingdom phylum, whereas
cross-kingdom genes may belong group, indicating ancient origin of
cyp diversification. cyp proteins often functionally categorized into
catalysts "endogenous," "secondary," "xenobiotic" compounds according to
their substrate specificities. postulated that
xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes derived endogenous
substrate-catalyzing enzyme. although functional flow endogenous to
xenobiotic substrates occurred, recent evidence wide range genomic
analyses indicated opposite dominant stream. expression 
of vertebrate cyp genes regulated internal external stimuli
through transcription factors nuclear receptor family bhlh-pas family.
some aspects cooperative evolution transcriptional regulators and
their target genes briefly reviewed.
