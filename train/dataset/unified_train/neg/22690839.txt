foot mouth disease (fmd) endemic transboundary disease mekong
region, fmd records reports animal health authorities lao pdr
between 2009 2011 reviewed. fmd outbreaks occurred 2 3 years in
eight districts three eight northern lao pdr provinces, locations
suggested fmd 'hotspots'. relatively higher risk recurrence fmd in
these districts likely due presence dense large ruminant
population, extensive animal trading including transboundary movements and
ineffective animal movement controls. understanding epidemiology 
fmd 'hotspots' may offer insights improved fmd control the
region, study outbreak fmd occurring early 2010 following failure
to vaccinate conducted endemic 'hotspot' area paek district in
xiengkhoung province early 2009, major outbreak fmd district
had prevented two villages vaccination. 2010 outbreak included
collection tissue samples 1 week onset fmd confirmed
infection fmd virus serotype (myanmar topotype) population 239
large ruminants, comprising 167 cattle 72 buffalo. survey interview of
30 farmers conducted july 2010 documented high morbidity cattle buffalo
(>90%) identified disease risk factors, including increased trading of
animals end rice harvest, plus several failures biosecurity. 
late 2010 early 2011, total 40 72 serum samples collected 
large ruminants prior post-fmd vaccination respectively tested by
lpb-elisa. antibodies present pre-vaccination samples attributable to
previous exposure fmd virus significantly rising post-vaccination titres
indicated likely temporary protection future fmdv infection. was
concluded provide sufficient control fmd 'hotspot', regular
vaccination, particularly prior peak risk period december-february,
plus improved farmer knowledge disease transmission risk biosecurity, is
required. although low rural education standards language barriers of
multiple ethnic groups pose challenge successful delivery extension 
programmes northern lao pdr, training improve disease recognition and
reporting plus village-level biosecurity practices considered important fmd
'hotspots' sustainable regional initiatives directed fmd control 
achieved.
