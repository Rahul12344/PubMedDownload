aims: prospective randomized trial carried order determine
whether long-term administration ursodeoxycholic acid after
discontinuation interferon beneficial effect clinical course of
hepatitis c virus infection.
methods: enrolled study 203 patients chronic active hepatitis c.
they given: interferon alpha-2a (3 mu subcutaneously thrice week) 
ursodeoxycholic acid (10 mg/kg/day) 9 months. month 9, biochemical
responders randomized ursodeoxycholic acid treatment placebo
for 12 additional months (double blind study).
results: end interferon therapy, 71 patients (37%) virological
responders 107 (56%) patients biochemical responders were
randomized: 54 ursodeoxycholic acid group 53 placebo group.
sustained response evaluated 12 months withdrawal interferon.
sustained biochemical virological responses were, respectively, 30% 22%
in ursodeoxycholic acid group 46% 32% placebo group, did
not significantly differ. histological evolution fibrosis necrotic
inflammatory activity similar two groups.
conclusion: continuation ursodeoxycholic acid therapy withdrawal of
interferon patients end-of-treatment response result any
significant improvement either maintenance response interferon in
liver histology.
