there ongoing interest develop high affinity, thermal stable recognition
elements replace conventional antibodies biothreat detection assays. as
part effort, single domain antibodies target vaccinia virus were
developed. two llamas immunized killed viral particles followed by
boosts recombinant membrane protein, l1, stimulate immune
response envelope membrane proteins virus. variable domains of
the induced heavy chain antibodies selected m13 phage display libraries
developed isolated rna. selection via biopanning l1 antigen produced 
single domain antibodies specific affinities ranging from
4×10(-9) 7.0×10(-10) m, determined surface plasmon resonance. several 
showed good ability refold heat denaturation. l1-binding single
domain antibodies, however, failed recognize killed vaccinia antigen.
useful vaccinia binding single domain antibodies isolated second
selection using killed virus target. virus binding single domain
antibodies incorporated sandwich assays capture tracer using 
the magpix system yielding limits detection 4×10(5) pfu/ml, a
four-fold improvement limit obtained using conventional antibodies. this
work demonstrates development anti-vaccinia single domain antibodies and
their incorporation sandwich assays viral detection. also highlights 
the properties high affinity thermal stability hallmarks of
single domain antibodies.
