the human immunodeficiency virus enters host cells membrane fusion,
initiated gp41 subunit envelope protein. gp41 also shown
to bind t-cell receptor (tcr) complex components, interfering tcr signaling 
leading reduced t-cell activation. immunoinhibitory activity suggested
to occur membrane fusion process attributed various
membranotropic regions gp41 ectodomain transmembrane domain.
although extensively studied, cytosolic region gp41, termed the
cytoplasmic tail (ct), examined context immune
suppression. investigated whether ct inhibits t-cell activation in
different t-cell models utilizing gp41-derived peptides expressed full
gp41 proteins. found conserved region ct, termed lentiviral
lytic peptide 2 (llp2), specifically inhibits activation mouse, jurkat,
and human primary t-cells. inhibition resulted reduced t-cell
proliferation, gene expression, cytokine secretion, cell surface expression
of cd69. differential activation tcr signaling cascade revealed that
ct-based immune suppression occurs downstream tcr complex. moreover, llp2 
peptide treatment jurkat primary human t-cells impaired akt nfÎºb
and erk1/2 activation, suggesting immune suppression occurs akt 
pathway. findings identify novel gp41 t-cell suppressive element a
unique inhibitory mechanism take place post-membrane fusion.
