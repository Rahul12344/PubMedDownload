autoimmune liver disease (ald) poses difficult medical challenge, a
significant number patients current therapy offers questionable 
benefit, yet side effects may serious, including development of
malignancy. bacterial viruses (phages) recognized increasingly as
immunomodulators contributing immune homeostasis curbing inflammation.
accumulating data suggest phages may useful immunotherapy ald.
phages shown down-regulate expression and/or production and
activity factors associated hepatic injury [reactive oxygen species,
toll-like receptor (tlr)-4 activation, nuclear factor kappa b (nf-κb) activation,
proinflammatory procoagulant activities platelets] up-regulate the
expression and/or production factors demonstrated playing protective role
[interleukin (il)-10, il-1 receptor antagonist].
