the hybrid capture ii (hcii) assay widely used detection human
papillomavirus virus (hpv). however, due limited number hpv genotypes, 
it permit comprehensive typing viruses "grey zone" (borderline 
negative positive results) often difficult interpret. such,
polymerase chain reaction (pcr) used parallel hcii assays, 
consensus pcr detection capable covering wider detection range 
the hcii method. examined relationship hcii relative light
unit/cutoff (rlu/co) ratios pcr amplification results. done using
previously described primer sets (my/gp) well primers hpv e1, 
l1 e6 gene amplification, performed samples exhibiting different
cytological findings. together, 243 samples divided three groups having
rlu/co ratios < 0.4 (n = 21), 0.4-4 (n = 64) > = 4 (n = 158),
respectively. samples subjected pcr amplification using my/gp the
newly designed e1, l1 e6 primers. results verified direct sequencing.
pcr amplification sensitivities higher using e1 primers for
the my/gp, e6 l1 primers. e1 assay used hpv detection a
sensitivity 10(2) copies microl(-1). samples rlu/co ratios exceeding 4,
and grey zone samples 0.4-4, amplified using e1 primers 79.74% and
26.56% total cases, respectively. cytological data grey zone samples
were primarily found normal (77%) whereas rlu/co ratios > 4 were
found cytological data categories. concluded hpv screening 
by hcii grey zone samples analyzed together cytological data, 
as well pcr screening tool incorporates e1 primers.
