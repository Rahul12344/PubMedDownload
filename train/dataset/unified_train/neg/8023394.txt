background: previous studies explored feasibility using the
photosensitizer methylene blue (mb) virucidal agent red cell suspensions.
under treatment conditions (5 microm [5 mumol/l] mb, 3.4 x 10(4) j/m2) that
resulted 6 log10 inactivation vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) or
of enveloped bacteriophage phi 6, red cell membrane alterations were
observed. increased red cell ion permeability binding plasma proteins 
to red cell surface sensitive indicators, varied a
dose-dependent fashion.
study design methods: inactivation three additional extracellular viruses 
and intracellular human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) assessed 
mb phototreatment red cell suspensions. potassium leakage igg binding also
were characterized mb-treated red cell suspensions exposed to
low-fluence light (6 x 10(3) j/m2).
results: different viruses exhibit wide range sensitivities mb
photoinactivation. example, phototreatment conditions (5 microm [5 mumol/l]
mb, 3.4 x 10(4) j/m2) inactivated 6 log10 vsv not
inactivate nonenveloped picornavirus, encephalomyocarditis virus. in
contrast, lower fluences (6 x 10(3) j/m2) inactivated approximately 5 log10 or
more sindbis virus approximately 4log10 extracellular hiv-1. less
stringent phototreatment conditions (5 microm [5 mumol/l] 6 x 10(3) j/m2) caused 
lower rates red cell potassium leakage (reduction 6-fold) little 
binding plasma proteins red cell surface, compared values observed
previously higher fluences. however, neither 6 x 10(3) 4.1 x 10(4) j per
m2 fluences resulted inactivation intracellular hiv represented by
changes amount p24 antigen produced co-culture actively
infected h9 cells.
conclusion: mb-based protocols would require use high-efficiency (>
6log10) white cell-reduction filters additional inactivation steps deplete 
or inactivate intracellular virus.
