our objective compare prevalence high-density
lipoprotein-cholesterol (hdl-c) level < 1 mmol/l non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitor (nnrti) protease inhibitor (pi) recipients an
unselected hiv-positive population. hiv-positive patients living oslo 
attended outpatient clinic april 1, 2000 april 1, 2001 invited
to study cardiovascular risk factors. substudy, 40 nnrti recipients 
and 124 pi recipients included. prevalence hdl-c <1 mmol/l 7.5% in
the nnrti recipients compared 35.5% pi recipients (p <0.001). 
multivariate analyses, use nnrti significant protective factor (odds
ratio [or] 0.17; 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.05-0.66; p = 0.01) elevated
triglycerides significant risk factor (or 3.40; 95% ci 1.47-7.86; p = 0.004)
for low hdl-c level. study shows nnrti recipients favourable
hdl-c profile pi recipients, even possible confounding factors are
taken account.
