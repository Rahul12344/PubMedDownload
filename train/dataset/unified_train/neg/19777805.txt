interferons (ifns) natural proteins produced wide variety cells in
response viral infection biological inducers, execute
diversified functions antiviral defense, immune activation cell growth
regulation. four genes encoding porcine interferons (poifn), poifn-alpha,
poifn-gamma, poifn-alphagamma polfn-omega, cloned sequenced. four
types porcine interferon genes subcloned pet-his vector, and
expressed escherichia coli rosetta (de3). recombinant products were
purified renaturalized inclusion bodies obtain native state well
biological activity. antiviral activity assays porcine interferons were
performed evaluated standard procedures following cell/virus test
systems: marc-145/prrsv, marc-145/vsv, pk-15/vsv, vero/vsv mdbk/vsv. data 
showed poifn-alpha poifn-alpagamma demonstrated significant
antiviral activities, titer prrsv 10(8) u/mg.
poifn-gamma approximately half one-thirds antiviral activity of
poifn-alpha. poifn-omega showed inconspicuous antiviral activity.
