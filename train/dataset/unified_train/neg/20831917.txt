gene-based hepatitis b virus (hbv) vaccines proposed novel
approach improve immunogenicity toward non-responders allow for
protection potential viral escape mutants. furthermore, is
significant interest using dna viral vector vaccines serve as
therapeutic agents treat chronic hbv infections resistant existing
drug therapies. however, key protective antigen hbv, surface protein
(hbsag), expressed three different sizes due multiple
translational initiation sites: small, middle, large forms hbsag. is
not clear whether immunogenicity hbsag same, especially their
ability elicit hbsag-specific b cell cell immune responses addition
to traditional serum hbsag-specific antibody responses. current study,
the immunogenicity three forms hbsag dna vaccines analyzed individually
in mouse model. results indicated different forms hbsag have
unique immunogenicity profiles information useful selection
of optimal gene-based hbv vaccines improved prophylactic and
therapeutic applications.
