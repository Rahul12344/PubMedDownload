to identify cis-acting elements foamy virus (fv) rna pregenome, we
developed transient-vector-production system based cotransfection of
indicator gene-bearing vector gag-pol env expression plasmids. two
elements critical vector transfer found mapped
approximately. first element located ru5 leader 5' gag
region (approximately position 650 viral rna). second element
was located approximately 2-kb sequence 3' pol region. although
small 5' 3' deletions, well internal deletions latter element,
were tolerated, elements found absolutely required vector
transfer. functional characterization pol region-located cis-acting
element revealed essential efficient incorporation the
stability particle-associated virion rna. furthermore, virions derived 
vector lacking sequence found deficient cleavage the
gag protein pol precursor protease. results suggest the
formation infectious virions, complex interactions fv gag pol 
the viral rna take place.
