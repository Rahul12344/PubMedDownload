cd40 crucial signal mediating factor t-dependent b cell responses and
involved many aspects cellular humoral immunity. paper,
recombinant protein cd40 flounder (paralichthys olivaceus) its
antibodies (abs) produced, native cd40 molecules flounder tissues were
identified, cd40+ leukocytes t/b lymphocytes characterized, 
the variations cd40+ leukocytes flounder hirame novirhabdovirus
(hirrv) infection immunization investigated, respectively. results
showed abs could specifically recognize native flounder cd40 molecule at
32 kda. proportions cd40+ leukocytes varied flounder tissues.
cd40+/igm+ b lymphocytes, cd40+/cd4-1+ lymphocytes, cd40+/cd4-2+ lymphocytes 
and cd40+/cd8+ lymphocytes peripheral blood leukocytes (pbls) were
1.18 ± 0.27%, 0.69 ± 0.17%, 0.75 ± 0.14% 0.25 ± 0.14%; 2.80 ± 0.32%,
0.71 ± 0.19%, 0.88 ± 0.23% 0.33 ± 0.17% spleen; 4.11 ± 0.47%,
0.92 ± 0.18%, 1.09 ± 0.17% 0.9 ± 0.17% head kidney; 1.92 ± 0.39%,
1.02 ± 0.23%, 1.33 ± 0.38% 0.67 ± 0.24% intestine; 1.24 ± 0.36%,
1.21 ± 0.24%, 1.70 ± 0.3% 0.97 ± 0.21% gill, respectively. percentages
of cd40+ leukocytes pbls significantly increased hirrv infection 
and immunization groups, reached peak levels 3rd day with
5.70 ± 0.16% 6.40 ± 0.13%, respectively. concluded previous study,
these data first reported cd40 molecules expressed b t
