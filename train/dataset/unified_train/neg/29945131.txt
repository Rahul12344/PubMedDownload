objective: study conducted analyze changes ha na genes of
pandemic ph1n1 strains, collected north indian tertiary care hospital during
2015 studied nucleotide change since 2009. differences clinical
features cases positive negative influenza viruses also studied.
methods: samples referred h1n1 testing, tested influenza
viruses. randomly selected 25 strains ph1n1 studied nucleotide
sequences ha &amp; na gene. nucleotide changes occurring since 2009 were
studied mutational phylogenetic analysis. clinical details cases were
recorded analysed.
results: total 3319 cases acute respiratory infections (ili/sari) were
tested influenza viruses jan april 2015, 815 cases tested 
positive ph1n1. nucleotide variation 2015 strains, influenza
a/california/07/2009 strain ha1 na1 gene 1.9% 3.8% respectively.
both ha1 na1 coding sequence showed eight mutations. four ha1(k180q,
s202t, s220t, a273t) na1 (n200s, v241i, n248d, n270k) mutations 
observed ph1n1 study strains.
conclusions: strains ph1n1 isolated year 2015 diverged previously 
circulating strains. association severity illness needs be
further studied.
