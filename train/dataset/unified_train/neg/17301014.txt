infectious salmon anemia (isa) one main infectious diseases atlantic
salmon farming major economical implications. despite strong regulatory 
interventions, isa epidemic control, worldwide. study the
data covering salmon farming norway 2002 2005 propose stochastic
space-time model transmission virus. model seaway transmission 
between farm sites, transmission shared management infrastructure,
biomass effects potential pathways within farming industry. find
that biomass effect infectiousness, local contact network and
seaway distance 5 km represent similar risks, large component risk
originates sources, among possibly infected salmon smolt and
boat traffic.
