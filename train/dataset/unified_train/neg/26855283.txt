complex regulation viral transcription patterns dna replication levels 
a feature many dna viruses. especially true viruses which
establish latent persistent infections (e.g., herpesviruses, papillomaviruses,
polyomaviruses, adenovirus), long-term persistence often requires
adaptation gene expression programs and/or replication levels cellular 
milieu. key factor control processes establishment a
specific chromatin state promoters replication origins, turn 
determine whether underlying dna accessible factors 
mediate downstream processes. chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) powerful 
technique investigate viral chromatin, particular study binding patterns
of modified histones, transcription factors dna-/chromatin-binding
proteins regulate viral lifecycle. here, provide protocols are
suitable performing chip-pcr chip-seq studies chromatin large and
small viral genomes.
