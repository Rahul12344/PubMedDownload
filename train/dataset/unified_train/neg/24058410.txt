the molecular diagnosis respiratory infection performed using different
commercial multiplex-based pcr kits whose performances previously
compared individually conventional techniques. study compared
the practicability diagnostic performances six ce-marked kits
available 2011 french market, including 2 detecting viruses and
atypical bacteria (from pathofinder seegene companies) 4 detecting only
viruses (from abbott, genomica, qiagen seegene companies). respective
sensitivity, specificity, accuracy agreement multiplex technique were
calculated comparison commercial duplex pcr tests (argene/biomérieux) used 
as gold standard. eighty-eight respiratory specimens pathogen (n = 11),
single infections (n = 33) co-infections (n = 44) selected cover 9
viruses groups viruses 3 atypical bacteria. samples extracted 
using nuclisens® easymag™ instrument (biomérieux). overall sensitivity
ranged 56.25% 91.67% viruses 50% tests for
bacteria. overall specificity excellent (>94% pathogens). for
each tested kit, overall agreement reference test strong for
viruses (kappa test >0.60) moderate bacteria. extraction step, 
the hands-on time varied 50 min 2h30 complete results were
available 2h30 9 h. spectrum tested agents technology used
to reveal pcr products well laboratory organization determinant
for selection kit.
