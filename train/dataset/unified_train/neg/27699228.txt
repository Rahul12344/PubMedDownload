following advent molecular assays measure cell receptor excision
circles (trecs) present recent thymic emigrants, conclusively
shown thymopoiesis persists adults, functional output
decreases age, influencing maintenance diverse functional t
cell receptor (tcr) repertoire. space flight shown result a
variety phenotypic functional changes human cells the
reactivation latent viruses. space flight shown influence
thymic architecture rodents, thymopoiesis previously assessed 
astronauts. here, assessed thymopoiesis longitudinally 1-year period
prior long-term space flight (median duration, 184 days) 16
astronauts. preflight assessments thymopoiesis remained quite stable 
individual astronauts, detected significant suppression thymopoiesis all
subjects upon return space flight. also found significant increases in
urine plasma levels endogenous glucocorticoids coincident the
suppression thymopoiesis. glucocorticoid induction thymopoiesis
suppression transient, normalized shortly return earth.
this first report knowledge prospectively demonstrate a
significant change thymopoiesis healthy individuals association a
defined physiologic emotional physical stress event. results suggest
that suppression thymopoiesis potential influence maintenance
of tcr repertoire extended space travel. studies of
thymopoiesis endogenous glucocorticoids stress states, including
illness, warranted.
