background: barley stripe mosaic virus (bsmv)-based vector developed
and used gene silencing barley wheat seedlings assess gene
functions pathogen- insect-resistance, conditions gene silencing in
spikes grains evaluated. study, explored the
feasibility using bsmv gene silencing wheat spikes grains.
results: apparent photobleaching spikes infected bsmv:pds heading 
stage observed 13 days post inoculation (dpi), persisted 30
dpi, spikes inoculated bsmv:00 remained green same
period. grains bsmv:pds infected spikes also exhibited photobleaching.
molecular analysis indicated photobleached spikes grains resulted from
the reduction endogenous pds transcript abundances, suggesting bsmv:pds
was able induce pds silencing wheat spikes grains. inoculation onto
wheat spikes heading flowering stage optimal efficient silencing 
of pds wheat spikes. furthermore, used bsmv-based system reduce 
transcript level 1bx14, gene encoding high-molecular-weight glutenin
subunit 1bx14 (hmw-gs 1bx14), 97â€‰% grains bsmv:1bx14 infected
spikes 15 dpi, compared bsmv:00 infected spikes, the
reduction persisted least 25 dpi. amount hmw-gs 1bx14 was
also detectably decreased. percentage glutenin macropolymeric proteins 
total proteins significantly reduced grains 1bx14-silenced plants
as compared grains bsmv:00 infected control plants,
indicating hmw-gs 1bx14 one major components participating the
formation glutenin macropolymers wheat grains.
conclusion: one first reports successful application of
bsmv-based virus-induced-gene-silencing (vigs) gene knockdown wheat spikes
and grains application functional analysis 1bx14 gene. the
established bsmv-vigs system useful future research functional
analysis genes contributing grain quality metabolic networks in
developing seeds wheat.
