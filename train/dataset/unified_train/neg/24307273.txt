elisa used determine pr la protein tmv accumulation local necrotic 
lesions produced salicylic acid water sprayed nicotiana tabacum cv
xanthi-nc leaves. amount pr la protein produced result an

implication observations experiments investigating relationship 
between pr proteins resistance discussed.the distribution tmv pr
la protein around single local necrotic lesions 14 days after
inoculation measured elisa. highest concentration tmv the
centre lesion decreased rapidly distance centre. in
contrast little pr la protein centre lesion, the
largest amounts outside centre, concentration then
decreased distance centre. distribution might be
expected substance closely associated restriction virus spread.
