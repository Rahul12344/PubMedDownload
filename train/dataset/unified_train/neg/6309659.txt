the lymphocytes asymptomatic, seropositive donors demonstrated blastogenic
responses early antigens human cytomegalovirus whether antibodies to
early antigens detectable. lymphocytes six nine patients with
active cytomegalovirus infections gave stimulation indexes greater or
equal 2.00 antigens productively infected cells, whereas two
patients demonstrated comparable stimulation indexes early antigens. four
patients stimulation indexes greater equal 2.00 to
productively infected antigens stimulation indexes less equal to
2.00 early antigens. viral polypeptides molecular weights 83,000,
72,000, 62,000, 56,000, 40,000 identified early antigen preparations.
