methods: pilot bbv testing program undertaken part routine clinical
care ed. ed attendees aged 16 65 years old able
to consent tested 55 week period opt basis. patients with
positive test results linked clinical services. interventions aimed at
improving testing rates implemented evaluated quality improvement
(qi) methodology.
results: 25,520 age-eligible ed attendees, 6108 (24%) underwent bbv testing;
an additional 1160 (4.5%) underwent standalone hiv test (total 7268 (28%)
individuals).there 83/7268 (1.1%) non-negative (ie reactive equivocal)
results hiv 103/6108 (1.7%) 32/6108 (0.52%) anti-hcv igg and
hbsag, respectively. these, 12 (0.17%), 16 (0.26%) 8 (0.13%) new
reactive tests hiv, hcv hbv, respectively, able be
confirmed second test. specific qi interventions led temporary increases 
in testing rates.
conclusions: opt bbv testing program ed feasible effective
at finding new cases. however, testing rate low 24%. although qi

required identify ways achieve sustained increases testing this
setting.
