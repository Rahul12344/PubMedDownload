multiplex methodologies, especially high-throughput capabilities
generate large volumes data. accumulation data (e.g., genomics,
proteomics, metabolomics etc.) fast becoming common thus requires the
development implementation effective data mining strategies designed for
biological clinical applications. multiplex microbead immunoassay (mmia), 
xmap magpix platform (luminex), amenable automation, offers a
major advantage conventional methods western blot elisa, for
increasing efficiencies serodiagnosis infectious diseases. mmia allows 
detection antibodies and/or antigens efficiently wide range of
infectious agents simultaneously host blood samples, one reaction vessel.
in process, mmia generates large volumes data. report we
demonstrate application data mining tools inherent large volume
data improve assay tolerance (measured terms sensitivity and
specificity) analysis experimental data accumulated span two
years. combination prior knowledge machine learning tools provides an
efficient approach improve diagnostic power assay continuous
basis. furthermore, study provides in-depth knowledge base study
pathological trends infectious agents mouse colonies multivariate
scale. data mining techniques using serodetection infections mice,
developed study, used general model complex
applications epidemiology clinical translational research.
