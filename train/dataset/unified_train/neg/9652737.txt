ap-1 transactivation appears required mouse jb6 cell neoplastic
transformation induced tumor promoter tpa epidermal growth factor
(egf). exposure ap-1 transrepressing retinoids glucocorticoids and
expression dominant negative c-jun (tam67) blocked tumor promoter-induced
ap-1 transactivation neoplastic transformation. aim present study 
was extend inquiry role ap-1 transcription factors 
human neoplastic progression. expression human papillomavirus (hpv) 16 18
e6 e7 immortalizes human keratinocytes inhibits serum/calcium-stimulated 
differentiation. transformation v-fos co-expression renders these
keratinocytes tumorigenic nude mice. analysed two series e6/e7
immortalized human keratinocyte cell lines show progressing phenotypes
ranging differentiation sensitive anchorage-independent tumorigenic in
nude mice. analysed activities ap-1 nf-kappab may
'cross-talk'. dna binding transactivation ap-1 nf-kappab
transcription factors showed elevation anchorage-independent (16rh) and
tumorigenic (18 v-fos) keratinocyte lines compared less progressed but
immortalized cell lines. hpv e7 expressed constant level shown by
quantitative rt-pcr less progressed lines, indicating
that e7 factor limiting progression. blocked shift/supershift
analysis indicates fos family member proteins especially fra-1 fra-2 are
related progression changes found jun family member proteins
although present ap-1/dna binding complex. dominant
negative mutant c-jun driven human keratin 14 promoter co-transfected
with ap-1 nf-kappab reporters, ap-1 nf-kappab activities were
suppressed progressed cell lines 16rh 18 v-fos the
less progressed 16rl 18 cell lines. overexpression dominant
negative c-jun inhibit p53 dependent reporter transactivation, indicating
the specificity inhibition ap-1 nf-kappab transactivation the
hpv-immortalized cells. stable transfectants mutant c-jun two more
progressed cell lines 16rh 18 v-fos showed reduced ap-1 nf-kappab
activation reduced anchorage-independent growth. together, results
indicate activation ap-1, nf-kappab may contribute neoplastic 
progression hpv immortalized human keratinocytes specific targeting
of elevated levels seen benign malignant tumors might effective 
prevention treatment human cancer.
