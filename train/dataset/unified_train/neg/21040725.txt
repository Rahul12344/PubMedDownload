background & aims: several studies reported hepatitis c virus (hcv) rna
sequences circulation treatment-induced spontaneous recovery. 
investigated whether hcv rna represents persistence hcv infection or
reinfection.
methods: studied 117 patients recovered hcv infection (98 following
therapy 19 spontaneously). reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction 
assay used detect 5'-untranslated region hcv. t-cell responses were
studied enzyme-linked immunospot interferon-γ.
results: plasma samples 15% treatment-recovered patients no
spontaneously recovered patient tested positive hcv rna. lymphocytes 3
patients responded therapy 1 recovered spontaneously tested
positive. frequency hcv rna detection plasma correlated inversely 
the time end treatment. post-treatment hcv 5'-untranslated region
sequences matched pretreatment sequences 85% cases. t-cell responses were
significantly greater time points detectable trace amounts hcv rna
than time points without detectable hcv rna (p = .035) primarily
against nonstructural hcv antigens. immune hierarchy preserved 5
years patients whose post-treatment hcv rna sequences matched pretreatment
sequences, indicating hcv rna persistence. altered immune hierarchy with
dominant immune responses, shifting nonstructural structural antigens,
was observed single patient whose post-treatment hcv genotype differed 
that pretreatment genotype, indicating hcv reinfection.
conclusions: trace amounts hcv rna pretreatment sequence persisted and
reappeared sporadically circulation within 8 years recovery from
hepatitis c thereafter, indicating patients cured hcv
infection. reappearance hcv rna induced hcv-specific t-cell responses.
