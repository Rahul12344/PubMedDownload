background: although profilin believed essential regulator the
actin cytoskeleton cells, precise role mammalian cells remains
unknown. used replication-incompetent adenovirus carrying human
profilin cdna means rapidly increase concentration profilin in
human aortic endothelial cells 12-31-fold baseline--levels never before
achieved mammalian cells.
results: concentration filamentous actin detectably affected by
profilin overexpression. actin stress fibers were, however, absent areas 
high profilin content overexpressing cells, bulk filaments was
located periphery cells. observed gradient distribution
of overexpressed profilin migrating endothelial cells, profilin
molecules concentrated near advancing edge focal contacts being
formed focal adhesion proteins located. profilin overexpression resulted 
in increased recruitment fibronectin receptors plasma membrane.
adhesion endothelial cells fibronectin markedly selectively
increased profilin overexpression.
conclusions: conclude important role profilin mammalian cells
may contribution formation focal contacts, particularly those
involving fibronectin receptor.
