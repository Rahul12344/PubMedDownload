searching effective antineoplastic antiviral agents, have
prepared various 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-4'-thioarabinonucleosides. glycosylation 
reaction persilylated pyrimidine bases 4-thiosugar derivative was
performed using sncl4 catalyst. reaction purines the
4-thiosugar, catalyzed tmsotf, gave corresponding purine
4'-thionucleosides. pyrimidine derivatives (e.g., 5-ethyluracil, 5-iodouracil,
and 5-iodocytosine) showed potent anti-hsv-1 activities, guanine and
2,6-diaminopurine derivatives showed marked anti-hcmv activities.
