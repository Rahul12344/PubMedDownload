we identified acute measles virus (nagahata strain) closely related a
defective virus (biken strain) isolated patient subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (sspe). proteins nagahata strain measles virus are
antigenically electrophoretically similar proteins edmonston strain
measles virus. however, nucleotide sequence nagahata matrix (m) gene
is significantly different genes acute measles virus
strains studied date. nagahata gene strikingly similar gene 
of biken strain sspe virus isolated several years later locale.
eighty percent nucleotide differences nagahata biken m
genes uridine-to-cytosine transitions known biased hypermutation, which
has postulated caused cellular rna-modifying activity. these
biased mutations account one numerous missense genetic changes
predicted cause amino acid substitutions. result, biken virus m
protein loses conformation-specific epitopes conserved proteins
of nagahata edmonston strain acute measles viruses. these
conformation-specific epitopes also absent cryptic proteins encoded 
by hypermutated genes two defective sspe viruses (niigata and
yamagata strains). nagahata-like sequences found genes least
five sspe viruses isolated three continents. data indicate 
biken strain sspe virus derived progenitor closely resembling nagahata 
strain acute measles virus biased hypermutation largely responsible
for structural defects biken virus protein.
