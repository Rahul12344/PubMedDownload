rab proteins effectors facilitate vesicular transport tethering
donor vesicles respective target membranes. using gene trap
insertional mutagenesis, identified rab9, mediates
late-endosome-to-trans-golgi-network trafficking, among several candidate host
genes whose disruption allowed survival marburg virus-infected cells,
suggesting rab9 utilized marburg replication. although rab9 not
been implicated human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) replication, previous
reports suggested late endosome initiation site hiv assembly
and tip47-dependent trafficking late endosome trans-golgi 
network facilitates sorting hiv env virions budding plasma
membrane. examined role rab9 life cycles hiv several
unrelated viruses, using small interfering rna (sirna) silence rab9 expression
before viral infection. silencing rab9 expression dramatically inhibited hiv
replication, silencing host genes encoding tip47, p40, pikfyve,
which also facilitate late-endosome-to-trans-golgi vesicular transport. in
addition, silencing studies revealed hiv replication dependent the
expression rab11a, mediates trans-golgi-to-plasma-membrane transport,
and increased hiv gag sequestered cd63+ endocytic compartment 
cell line stably expressing rab9 sirna. replication enveloped ebola,
marburg, measles viruses inhibited rab9 sirna, although the
non-enveloped reovirus insensitive rab9 silencing. results suggest
that rab9 important cellular target inhibiting diverse viruses help
to define late-endosome-to-plasma-membrane vesicular transport pathway
important viral assembly.
