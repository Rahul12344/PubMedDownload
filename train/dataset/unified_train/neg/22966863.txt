in order study variety infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (ipnv)
strains involved outbreaks infectious pancreatic necrosis (ipn) atlantic
salmon fish farms, samples collected 19 different outbreaks ipn in
the northern part norway. main objective study examine
whether ipnv isolates different virulence involved outbreaks and
could explain variable ipn protection observed vaccinated post-smolts in
the field. molecular basis virulence field isolates and
virulence expressed mortality bath challenge unvaccinated post-smolts
with eight isolates studied. little variation among field
isolates detected 578-bp variable region encoding vp2 protein
known involved virulence sequenced. cumulative mortality after
experimental challenge field isolates genetically characterized highly
virulent always high (40-56%), cumulative mortality same
strains vaccinated post-smolts field outbreaks varied 1 to
50%. although tested samples came fish vaccinated vaccine 
product, protection ipn varied. results demonstrate that
differences virulence isolates main reason the
variation mortality field outbreaks. field isolates of
high virulence, shown experimental challenges important for
mortality, clearly factors might affect susceptibility ipn 
also play important role outcome ipnv infection.
