the results research project ex vivo expansion human haematopoietic
stem cells (hsc) development gene therapy, funded swiss national
research program 46, summarised discussed context current
progresses difficulties fields. routine method ex vivo
expansion human hsc yet available. however, stem cell biology has
progressed importantly recent years; ex vivo expansion human hsc should
become possible near future. regarding gene therapy development, we
obtained hiv-1-derived bicistronic lentiviral vectors efficient delivery 
genes immature haematopoietic cells also primary human b lymphocytes.
however, clinical gene therapy still faces variety problems. (into
chromosomes) integrating lentivectors, currently promising tools for
hsc-based gene therapy, risks insertional mutagenesis need fully
assessed larger clinical trials start.
