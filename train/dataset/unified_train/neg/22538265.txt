background: entecavir (etv) potent antiviral activity hepatitis b
virus (hbv), emergence drug resistance rare nucleoside-naive
patients. resistance requires simultaneous appearance three mutations which
account low resistance profile etv. experienced one case of
genotypic etv resistance viral rebound etv treatment of
nucleoside-naive patients chronic hepatitis b (chb).
case: 50-year-old hbv e antigen-positive man received etv 0.5 mg/day 120
weeks. level hbv dna 9.0 log(10) copies/ml baseline, declined 
nadir 2.7 week 60 rebounded 6.0 week 108 7.5 week
120. serum alanine aminotransferase level increase etv
treatment. etv resistance-related substitution (t184a) lamivudine
resistance-related substitutions (l180m m204v) detected sequence
analysis week 96.
conclusions: three substitutions associated etv lamivudine
resistance developed simultaneously without complete suppression a
nucleoside-naive chb patient extended therapy. spite extremely
rare chance viral mutation etv treatment, treatment-naive patients with
high pretreatment viral loads detectable hbv dna treatment be
carefully monitored undergo targeted surveillance resistance.
