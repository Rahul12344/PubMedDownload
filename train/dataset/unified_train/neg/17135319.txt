reverse transcription, essential step life cycle retroelements, 
is complex, multistep process whose regulation yet clearly understood.
we recently shown reverse transcription pararetrovirus duck
hepatitis b virus associated complete dephosphorylation viral core
protein, forms nucleocapsid wherein reverse transcription takes place. 
here present genetic study role dynamic nucleocapsid
phosphorylation regulating viral reverse transcription. detailed analyses of
the reverse transcription products synthesized within nucleocapsids composed of
core phosphorylation site mutants revealed alanine substitutions, mimicking 
the nonphosphorylated state, completely blocked reverse transcription very
early stage. contrast, aspartate substitutions, mimicking phosphorylated
state, allowed complete first-strand dna synthesis severely defective in
accumulating mature double-stranded dna. latter defect due a
combination mutant nucleocapsid instability maturation block in
mature second-strand dna synthesis. thus, reversible phosphorylation the
nucleocapsids regulates ordered progression reverse transcription.
