background: previously suggested infection human t-lymphotropic 
virus type 1 (htlv-1) subtype c associated bronchiectasis among
indigenous australians. bronchiectasis might therefore result an
htlv-1-mediated inflammatory process typically associated high
htlv-1 proviral load (pvl). human t-lymphotropic virus type 1 pvl been
reported indigenous australians.
methods: thirty-six indigenous adults admitted bronchiectasis june 1,
2008, december 31, 2009 prospectively recruited matched age, sex, 
and ethno-geographic origin 36 controls. case notes chest high-resolution 
computed tomographs reviewed, pulmonary injury scores calculated. a
pvl assay htlv-1c subtype infects indigenous australians was
developed applied study. clinical, radiological, virological
parameters compared groups according htlv-1 serostatus.
results: human t-lymphotropic virus type 1 infection main predictor of
bronchiectasis multivariable model (adjusted risk ratio [arr], 1.84; 95%
confidence interval [ci], 1.19-2.84; p = .006). moreover, median htlv-1c pvl 
(interquartile range) cases >100-fold controls (cases, 0.319
[0.007, 0.749]; controls, 0.003 [0.000, 0.051] per 100 peripheral blood
lymphocytes; p = .007), htlv-1c pvl closely correlated with
radiologically determined pulmonary injury scores (spearman's rho = 0.7457; p =
.0000). predictors bronchiectasis positive strongyloides serology
(arr, 1.69; 95% ci, 1.13-2.53) childhood skin infections (arr, 1.62; 95% ci, 
1.07-2.44). bronchiectasis major predictor death (arr, 2.71; 95% ci,
1.36-5.39; p = .004).
conclusions: data strongly support etiological association between
htlv-1 infection bronchiectasis socially disadvantaged population at
risk recurrent lower respiratory tract infections.
