the antiviral neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir (osv) widely used to
suppress viral replication treatment influenza. here, report that
osv administration significantly suppressed respiratory mucosal secretory iga
responses respect antigen (ag)-specific antibody (ab) production also
the induction ag-specific iga ab-forming cells, systemic igg
responses, weanling mice model pediatric influenza. neutralizing
activities airway fluids oral osv-treated mice significantly less 
than sham-treated mice. findings suggest risk re-infection in
