an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) developed quantification
of serum antibodies group-specific epitopes glycoproteins (g1, g2)
and nucleoprotein (np) genus hantavirus. assay used study 
kinetics development serum antibodies natural infection with
puumala-like virus humans. end panel 34 serum samples collected
from individuals different times natural infection tested the
elisa. samples also tested specific igm igg levels against
puumala-like virus, provided confirmatory data presumed timing of
infection. shown serum antibodies g1 epitope present
in acute early convalescent period antibodies np
epitope could demonstrated. contrast, antibodies two g2 epitopes were
present earlier convalescent late convalescent period. since 
all categories antibodies seem persist long periods, antibodies
against g1 epitope np epitope may specific diagnostic value.
furthermore, levels g1-specific antibodies antibodies either np g2
may allow estimation time elapsed following initial infection.
