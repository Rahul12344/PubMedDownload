the adenovirus dna-binding protein (dbp) binds cooperatively single-stranded
dna (ssdna) stimulates initiation elongation dna replication. dbp
consists globular core domain c-terminal arm hooks onto a
neighboring dbp molecule form stable protein chain dna bound the
internal surface chain. multimerization driving force for
atp-independent dna unwinding dbp elongation. shown x-ray
diffraction different crystal forms c-terminal domain, c-terminal
arm adopt different conformations, leading flexibility protein
chain. flexibility function hinge region, part the
protein joining c-terminal arm protein core. investigate the
function flexibility, proline residues introduced hinge
region, proteins purified homogeneity baculovirus
expression. mutant proteins still able bind ss- double-stranded
dna approximately affinity wild type, binding ssdna
was found cooperative. mutant proteins able stimulate the
initiation dna replication near wild type levels. however, proline
mutants could support elongation dna replication efficiently. even the
elongation 26 nucleotides severely impaired. defect also seen 
when dna unwinding studied. binding studies dbp homo-oligonucleotides
showed inability proline mutants bind poly(da)(40), indicating an
inability adapt specific dna conformations. data suggest the
flexibility protein chain formed dbp important binding and
unwinding dna adenovirus dna replication. model explaining need
for flexibility c-terminal arm proposed.
