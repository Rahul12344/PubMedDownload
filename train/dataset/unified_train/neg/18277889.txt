aim: evaluate hepatitis b virus (hbv) hepatitis c virus (hcv)
epidemiology general population northern italy, cohort 965
subjects, residents (including 47 immigrants), anonymously tested for
hbv hcv infections.
material methods: serum samples assayed anti-hcv anti-hbv
markers enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay hcv-rna polymerase chain 
reaction, positive cases genotyped. hbsag-positive cases were
assayed hbeag/anti-hbe, whereas hbsag negatives tested anti-hbc
and anti-hbs.
results: overall prevalence anti-hcv 2.6%, bimodal distribution
characterized highest prevalence (12%) subjects 75 years old. none
of subjects 25 years old anti-hcv positive. anti-hcv positivity was
similar males females (2.4% vs. 2.7%). hcv-rna positive 40% of
cases genotype 1 common. hbsag prevalence 1%, a
significant difference according country origin (0.8% italian subjects
vs. 6.4% immigrants, p=0.01). hbsag positivity increased significantly with
age (r2=0.57, p<0.02). overall percentages prevalence isolated
anti-hbs, anti-hbs+/anti-hbc+, isolated anti-hbc 23.8%, 8.4%, 4.2%, 
respectively.
conclusions: study provides new picture hcv hbv epidemiology in
northern italy, features: (1) cohort effect showing reduction of
hcv infection elderly, possible due age-related mortality; (2) an
unchanged overall prevalence hbv infection, despite continuing immigration 
subjects endemic countries.
