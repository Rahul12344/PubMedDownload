purpose review: despite remarkable progress development drugs that
inhibit hiv-1 replication, eradication infection achieved.
the principal reason virus persist stable cellular reservoirs,
the best characterized small pool latently infected resting
memory cd4 cells carry stably integrated viral genome. review
covers recent discoveries biology reservoir, particularly as
related efforts eliminate it.
recent findings: new studies suggest reservoir may established 
acute infection define virus integrates human genome. in
addition, relationship latent reservoir residual
low-level virus production continues even patients optimal therapy 
becoming clear. several recent studies described approaches eliminating 
the latent reservoir. new insights biology reservoir are
providing context understanding enormous obstacles must be
overcome reservoir eliminated.
summary: latent reservoir presents formidable therapeutic challenge because
it allows virus persist genetic information form stably
integrated provirus inherently stable cellular compartment. eradication 
complicated fact virus undergo exponential expansion once
drug pressure released. thus eradication must complete effective.
