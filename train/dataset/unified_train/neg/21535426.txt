bacteriophage endolysins peptidoglycan hydrolases employed virus to
lyse host end multiplication phase. found many uses
in biotechnology; antimicrobials, also development of
novel diagnostic tools rapid detection pathogenic bacteria. enzymes 
generally show modular organization, consisting n-terminal enzymatically
active domains (eads) c-terminal cell wall-binding domains (cbds) which
specifically target enzymes substrate bacterial cell
envelope. work, used individual functional modules listeria phage
endolysins create fusion proteins novel optimized properties for
labelling lysis listeria cells. chimaeras consisting individual ead and
cbd modules plypsa ply118 endolysins different binding specificity 
and catalytic activity showed swapped properties. ead118-cbdpsa fusion proteins
exhibited threefold higher lytic activity parental endolysins.
recombineering different cbd domains targeting various listeria cell surfaces
into novel heterologous tandem proteins provided extended recognition
and binding properties, demonstrated fluorescent gfp-tagged cbd fusions. it
was also possible combine binding specificities different single cbds
in heterologous tandem cbd constructs cbd500-p35 cbdp35-500, which
were able recognize majority listeria strains. duplication of
cbd500 increased equilibrium cell wall binding affinity approximately
50-fold, enzyme featuring tandem cbd modules showed increased activity at
higher ionic strength. results demonstrate modular engineering of
endolysins powerful approach rational design optimization of
desired functional properties proteins.
