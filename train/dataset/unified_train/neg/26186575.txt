the infection routes hiv-1 affect several viral properties, including
dissemination, pathogenesis, immune evasion. study, evaluated 
inhibitory activity wide variety anti-hiv drugs, focusing impact
that different infection pathways efficacy. compared cell-free
infection, inhibitory activities reduced cell-to-cell productive
transmission drugs tested. detected weak reporter-expressing target
cells cell-to-cell transmission presence integrase strand
transfer inhibitors (instis). analysis revealed expression 
mainly due unintegrated circular hiv (chiv) dnas, consisting 1-ltr and
2-ltr circles. vitro-constructed chiv dnas introduced cells,
the production infectious intercellular transmittable virions was
observed, suggesting chiv dna could source infectious virus. these
results highlight advantages cell-to-cell infection mode viral
expansion, particularly presence anti-retroviral drugs.
