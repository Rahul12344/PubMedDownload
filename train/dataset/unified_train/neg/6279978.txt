the influence polyamines various enzymes involved excision repair
pathway dna, uv endonuclease, dna polymerase i, dna ligase and
polynucleotide kinase, two ap-endonucleases, studied. polymerizing
activities dna polymerase polynucleotide kinase found be
markedly affected polyamines. former enzyme effect be
attributed stabilization correct bihelical structure 3' end 
and latter case polyamines stabilize polynucleotide kinase protein
itself correct oligomeric structure. effect polyamines the
hydrolysis apurinic apyrimidinic sites dna nucleosome particles
were also investigated. spermine spermidine found most
efficient polyamines causing hydrolysis free dna the
nucleosome particles.
