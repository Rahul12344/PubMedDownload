zucchini yellow mosaic virus (zymv) causes serious damage large number of
cucurbits, control measures necessary. transgenic cucurbits expressing
parts zymv genome shown resistant cognate virus. 
non-transgenic approach involving exogenous application double-stranded
rna (dsrna) also shown induce resistance tobacco cucumber 
mosaic virus (cmv) tobacco mosaic virus (tmv). present study, dsrna
molecules derived helper component-proteinase (hc-pro) coat protein 
(cp) genes zymv_de_2014 isolate produced vitro. exogenous dsrna
application cucumber, watermelon squash plants, dsrna hc-pro conferred
resistance 82%, 50% 18%, dsrna cp molecules 70%, 43% 16%,
respectively. deep sequencing analysis zymv-infected watermelon, hot-spot
regions viral small interfering rnas (vsirnas) genome zymv were
identified. stem-loop reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)
detection selected 21-nucleotide-long vsirnas plants received only
dsrna molecules suggested dsrnas exogenously applied onto plants were
successfully diced, thus initiating rna silencing. dsrna molecules found 
be progressively degraded planta, strongly detected semi-quantitative
rt-pcr least 9 days exogenous application. moreover, dsrna molecules
were detected systemic tissue watermelon squash, showing dsrna 
transported long distances plants.
