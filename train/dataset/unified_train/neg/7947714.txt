membrane association required cell transformation pp60v-src (v-src),
the product v-src oncogene rous sarcoma virus. previous experiments
have identified two nh2-terminal membrane-binding motifs: myristate (14-carbon 
acyl chain) attached nh2-terminal glycine three basic residues at
positions 5, 7, 9 src. examined membrane binding motif
using myristylated (myr-src) nonmyristylated (nonmyr-src) peptides
corresponding nh2 terminus src. myristylated peptides partitioned
equally well onto electrically neutral phosphatidylcholine vesicles (k1 = 10(4)
m-1). identical binding observed simple myristylated peptides (e.g.,
myr-gly) arises hydrophobic insertion myristate the
bilayer. nonmyristylated peptide corresponding residues 2-16 src
[nonmyr-src(2-16), net charge = +5] bound vesicles containing 33% monovalent
acidic phospholipids k1 = 10(3) m-1. penta(lysine) (+5 net charge) exhibits 
the binding behavior, due electrostatic interaction 
basic residues acidic lipids. corresponding myristylated peptide,
myr-src(2-16), binds 3 orders magnitude strongly vesicles containing
33% acidic lipids neutral vesicles. resulting apparent association
constant, k1 = 10(7) m-1, approximately equal product partition 
coefficients two individual interactions. 10(7) m-1 binding is
sufficiently strong anchor src protein biological membranes. propose
a simple model explains observed synergism two
peptide-membrane interactions.
