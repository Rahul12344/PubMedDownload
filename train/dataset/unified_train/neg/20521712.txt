avian influenza (ai) surveillance commercial poultry accomplished by
detecting presence antibodies two group-specific antigens, np m1,
using agar gel immunodiffusion test. order determine viral subtype 
responsible infection, positive samples must subtyped using
the hemagglutination inhibition neuraminidase inhibition tests. tests
are labor intensive may take 4 days, thus slowing responses to
outbreaks. expedite subtyping chicken sera developed a
multiplex fluorescence microsphere immunoassay (fmia), allows the
simultaneous detection subtyping chicken sera h5 influenza viruses. the
fmia developed using np (full length) h5 (ha1 region) proteins expressed 
in baby hamster kidney cells using venezuela equine encephalitis virus replicon
system. proteins tagged 6xhis carboxy-end purified
using cobalt-coated agarose beads. purified h5 protein showed minimal
cross-reactivity anti-h2 serum, cross-reactivity observed 
sera ai virus (aiv) subtypes important poultry viral
pathogens. addition, expected, aiv sera tested reacted strongly
with purified np protein. results indicate fmia used rapid
subtyping chicken sera.
