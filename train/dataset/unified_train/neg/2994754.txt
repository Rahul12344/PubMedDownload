distribution ultraviolet-induced lesions simian virus 40 dna.

bourre f, renault g, seawell pc, sarasin a.

in order analyze molecular mechanisms mutagenesis mammalian cells,
we devised analytical assay using simian virus 40 biological probe. to
study possible correlations distribution lesions the
treated dna distribution mutations, located quantified the
lesions induced ultraviolet light (254 nm) sv40 dna fragment. a
fluence 2,000 j/m2, results show formation frequency of
thymine-thymine dimers (tt) three four times higher formation
frequency types dimers (tc, ct, cc). hand, the
formation frequency dimer influenced adjacent sequence. in
particular, pyrimidine 5' position thymine-thymine dimer enhances
its formation frequency. dose used formation frequency the
pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts twenty times less formation
frequency pyrimidine dimers. paper shows distribution major
lesions induced uv-light defined fragment sv40 genome uv
irradiation. work necessary get insight molecular
mechanisms uv-mutagenesis.
