pulsed amperometric detection (pad) target dna platinum electrodes
modified single-stranded dna (ssdna) entrapped within polypyrrole (ssdna/ppy) 
is reported first time. single-stranded dna 20-mers complementary 
target dna used construct dna biosensors. polymerase chain reaction
(pcr) amplified bovine leukaemia virus (blv) provirus dna used target dna.
electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (eis) investigation ssdna/ppy before
and incubation target dna-containing sample revealed significant changes
in terms imaginary (z") vs. real (z') component. pad results 
good agreement eis investigations. pad method selected, it
does require sophisticated equipment used perform eis and
the results obtained easily estimated. optimum conditions for
performing pad evaluating analytical signal elaborated. no
label-binding step necessary detection target dna pcr-amplified
amplicons detection time reduced much 30-35 min. changes 
pad signals least 6-7 times higher ssdna/ppy-modified electrodes
instead blank ppy-modified electrodes incubated target dna
solutions. ssdna/ppy modified electrodes incubated non-complementary
(control) dna solution changes pad signals smaller detected
after incubation complementary (target) dna-containing solution factor of
at least 6-8.
