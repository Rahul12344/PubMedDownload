of viral replication alt normalization. thus, decision start treatment
should based careful patient selection individualized decisions.
treatment generally indicated chronic hepatitis b patients hbv dna
>2000 iu/ml, elevated alt and/or least moderate histological lesions, while
all patients cirrhosis detectable hbv dna treated. patients
with hbv dna >20 000 iu/ml alt >2xuln (upper limit normal), hbv dna
>2000 iu/ml liver stiffness >9 >12 kpa case normal ≤5xuln, hbv
dna >2000 iu/ml family history cirrhosis and/or hcc well as
hbeag-positive patients hbv dna >20 000 iu/ml 30 years old can
begin treatment whatever liver histology. moreover, patients hbv dna
>2000 iu/ml least moderate histological lesions begin treatment
whatever alt levels. prophylactic treatment indicated hbv-related liver
transplantation patients prevent recurrence, last trimester of
pregnancy women high viraemia prevent vertical transmission in
patients receiving immunosuppression/chemotherapy prevent reactivation 
hbv. treatment also indicated patients co-infections, extrahepatic
manifestations severe acute hepatitis b, healthcare workers viraemia.
these treatment indications change hbv eradication least hbsag 
clearance achieved future significant proportion patients.
