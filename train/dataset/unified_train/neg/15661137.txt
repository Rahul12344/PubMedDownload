zaire ebolavirus causes large outbreaks severe usually fatal hemorrhagic
disease humans effective treatment cure. to
facilitate examination early critical events viral pathogenesis to
identify antiviral compounds, recombinant zaire ebolavirus engineered to
express foreign protein, egfp, provide rapid sensitive means to
monitor virus replication infected cells. genetically engineered virus
represents first insertion foreign gene ebolavirus. show that
ebola-egfp virus (eboz-egfp) infects known early targets human infections 
serves ideal model screen antiviral compounds less time any
previously published assay.
