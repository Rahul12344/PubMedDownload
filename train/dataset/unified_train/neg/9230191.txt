dendritic cells (dcs) professional antigen-presenting cells process 
present antigenic peptides capable generating potent t-cell immunity. 
a murine tumor model developed evaluate methods genetic immunization to
the human mart-1/melan-a (mart-1) melanoma antigen. poorly immunogenic murine
fibrosarcoma line (nfsa) stably transfected mart-1 gene. this
transfected tumor [nfsa(mart1)] grows progressively c3hf/kam/sed (h-2k) mice. 
partial protection challenge nfsa(mart1) could achieved with
i.m. injections mart-1 expression plasmid systemic administration of
an adenovirus vector expressing mart-1. however, superior protection achieved
when granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating
factor/interleukin-4-differentiated murine dcs transduced adenovirus
vector expressing mart-1 used immunization. partial complete
protection could achieved i.v. administration mart-1-engineered dcs.
splenocytes immunized mice contained mhc class 1-restricted ctls specific
for mart-1. preclinical model genetic immunization supports therapeutic
strategy human melanoma.
