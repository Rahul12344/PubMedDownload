temperature-sensitive changes surface modulating assemblies fibroblasts
transformed mutants rous sarcoma virus.

edelman gm, yahara i.

the hypothesis surface modulating assemblies containing microfilaments and
microtubules altered cellular transformation tested cells
infected temperature-sensitive mutants avian sarcoma virus. untransformed
cells (mouse 3t3 chick fibroblasts), cells transformed simian virus 40 (sv
3t3), chick fibroblasts infected schmidt-ruppin strain rous sarcoma
virus (sr-rsv-a-infected cells) first compared differences in
microfilament microtubule patterns treatment fluorescein-labeled
antibodies actin tubulin. transformed cells showed disappearance of
ordered stress microfilaments thickened diffuse alterations of
microtubular arrays. restrictive temperatures (41 degrees), chick fibroblasts 
infected temperature-sensitive mutant (ts 68) rous sarcoma virus showed
normal patterns stress fialments radial microtubular arrays originating in
1 2 centrioles. permissive temperatures (37 degrees), patterns were
disordered resembled sr-rsv-a-infected cells. shift 41 
degrees 37 degrees, changes microtubules observed majority 
of cells within 1 hr. changes reversible result the
inability tubulin polymerize. ts 68-infected cells permissive
temperatures, concanavalin induced much less surface modulation (inhibition 
receptor mobility) restrictive temperatures. results suggest that
cellular transformation alters structure function surface
modulating assemblies prompt hypothesis products viral
transforming genes may affect assemblies consequent loss growth
control.
