the v protein paramyxovirus nipah virus (niv) shown antagonize
the interferon (ifn) response human cells via sequestration stat1 and
stat2. study describes mutant niv v protein, referred as
v(aahl), unable antagonize ifn signalling demonstrates a
single amino acid substitution responsible inactivity. molecular
basis identified failure interact stat1 stat2. it
was also shown niv v, v(aahl), functional ifn antagonist
in human, monkey, rabbit, dog, horse, pig bat cells, suggests 
ability niv block ifn signalling major constraint prevents
this virus crossing species barriers.
