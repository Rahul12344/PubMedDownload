the demand tissue human-to-human transplantation consistently exceeds the
available supply, resulting attempts use organs tissues animals; 
field known xenotransplantation. major concern xenotransplantation the
risk infection human recipients new xenogeneic infectious agents and
subsequent transmission infections general population. of
particular importance infections retroviruses persist host
and may allow silent human-to-human transmission. pigs baboons considered
as sources human xenotransplants known infected number
of retroviruses. adequate diagnosis pig baboon retrovirus infections is
required pretransplant screening animal sources minimize risks of
transmission recipients also monitoring post-transplant infections 
the human recipients. strategies serologic, molecular, virologic
diagnosis described. examples virus-specific methods detection of
known retroviruses also shown. emphasis made need baboon and
pig cell-specific polymerase chain reaction assays necessary for
interpretation polymerase chain reaction results endogenous retroviruses.
generic methods detection novel variant retrovirus described and
include screening amp-rt, ultrasensitive reverse transcriptase assay.
