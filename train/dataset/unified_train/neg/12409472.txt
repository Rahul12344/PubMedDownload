in recent years, lentiviral expression systems gained unmatched
reputation among gene therapy community ability deliver
therapeutic transgenes wide variety difficult-to-transfect/transduce
target tissues (brain, hematopoietic system, liver, lung, retina) without
eliciting significant humoral immune responses. cloned construction
kit-like self-inactivating lentiviral expression vector family is
compatible state-of-the-art packaging pseudotyping technologies and
contains, besides essential cis-acting lentiviral sequences, (i) unparalleled
polylinkers 29 unique sites restriction endonucleases, many of
which recognize 8 bp motifs, (ii) strong promoters derived human
cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter (p(hcmv)) human elongation factor
1alpha (p(hef1)(alpha)), (iii) p(hcmv-) p(pgk-) (phosphoglycerate kinase
promoter) driven g418 resistance markers fluorescent protein-based expression 
tracers (iv) tricistronic expression cassettes coordinated expression 
up three transgenes. addition, designed size-optimized series 
highly modular lentiviral expression vectors (plenti module) contain,
besides extensive central polylinker, unique restriction sites flanking any
of 5'u3, r-u5-psi+-sd, cppt-rre-sa 3'ltr(deltau3) modules placed
within 5'u3 (-78 bp) 3'ltr(deltau3) (8666 bp). plentimodule enables
straightforward cassette-type module swapping lentiviral expression
vector family members facilitates design tat-independent (replacement 
of 5'ltr heterologous promoter elements), regulated self-excisable
proviruses (insertion responsive operators loxp 3'ltr(deltau3)
element). validated lentiviral expression vectors transduction 
a variety insect, chicken, murine human cell lines well adult rat
cardiomyocytes, rat hippocampal slices chicken embryos. novel
multi-purpose construction kit-like vector series described compatible
with well many (non-viral) mammalian expression vectors for
straightforward exchange key components (e.g. promoters, ltrs, resistance
genes) assist gene therapy tissue engineering communities in
developing lentiviral expression vectors tailored optimal treatment of
prominent human diseases.
