anabolic androgenic steroids (aas) main class doping agents 
consumption produces adverse effects involving several organs systems. three 
cases sudden cardiac death (scd) one death due congestive heart
failure previously healthy athletes aas users herein reported.
concentric cardiac hypertrophy focal fibrosis (one case), dilated
cardiomyopathy patchy myocyte death (two cases) eosinophilic myocarditis
(one case) observed probably relate final event. molecular
investigation viral genomes positive one case (ebstein virus). our
data confirm previous findings, showing typical cardiac abnormality
in aas abusers left ventricular hypertrophy, associated fibrosis and
myocytolysis. exceptional cardiovascular substrate represented case
with drug induced eosinophilic myocarditis. features risk of
ventricular arrhythmias well congestive heart failure. cause-effect
relationship aas abuse cardiac death established a
rigorous methodology use standardized protocols, including precise
morphological studies target organs search chronic toxic effects.
laboratory investigations focus aas searching wide range of
biological matrices demonstrate type, magnitude time exposure.
