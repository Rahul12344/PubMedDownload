p1 plasmid replication: multiple functions repa protein origin.

chattoraj dk, snyder km, abeles al.

replication functions bacteriophage p1 miniplasmid carried a
1.2-kilobase pair (kb) segment subdivided 245-base pair (bp)
replication origin 959-bp region encodes protein required for
replication (repa). origin region contains five 19-bp direct repeats. by
using primer extension gene-fusion assays, mapped promoter repa
gene within repeated sequences showed promoter repressed by
repa. regulation repa synthesis apparently achieved binding repa 
to repeat sequences. regulation might key step the
replication-control circuit, found overproduction repa (from a
foreign promoter) inhibits replication. thus, addition an
autoregulated activator replication, protein also negative
regulatory role.
