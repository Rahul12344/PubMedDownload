background: sexually transmitted infections (stis), including human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv), disproportionately affect adolescents young
adults (ayas) ages 13-24 years. sexually transmitted infections likewise a
risk factor hiv acquisition transmission; however, lack of
data sti acquisition hiv-infected ayas.
methods: determined incidence stis hiv-infected ayas 12.5 <25 years 
of age international maternal pediatric adolescent aids clinical trials
(impaact) p1074 observational cohort study. univariate multivariable logistic
regression models used evaluate association hiv control (mean
viral load <500 copies/ml cd4+ cells >500 cells/mm3 year preceding
sti diagnosis) risk factors sti occurrence.
results: 1201 enrolled subjects, 1042 participants met age criteria were
included (49% male, 61% black, 88% perinatally infected; mean age 18.3 years).
one hundred twenty participants least 1 sti study, 93 their
first lifetime sti (incidence rate = 2.8/100 person-years). individual sti
categories, 155 incident category-specific events reported; human
papillomavirus (hpv) chlamydial infections common. the
multivariable model, sti associated older age (adjusted odds
ratio [aor] = 1.13; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.05-1.22), female sex (aor =
2.65; 95% ci, 1.67-4.21), nonperinatal hiv acquisition (aor = 2.33; 95% ci,
1.29-4.22), uncontrolled hiv infection (aor = 2.05; 95% ci, 1.29-3.25).
conclusions: sexually transmitted infection acquisition hiv-infected ayas is
associated older age, female sex, nonperinatal hiv acquisition, poorly
controlled hiv infection. substantial rates stis among hiv-infected ayas
support enhanced preventive interventions, including safe-sex practices hpv
vaccination, antiretroviral adherence strategies.
