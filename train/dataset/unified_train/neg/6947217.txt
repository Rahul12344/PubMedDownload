host-range mutants adenovirus 5 contain defect region e1a (0-4.5
units) fail replicate hela cells transform rodent cells. hela
cells, mutants synthesize two rnas e1a share 5'
and 3' termini differ length amount internal sequence removed by
splicing. rna wild-type virus, selected hybridization dna region 
e1a, translates polypeptides mr 51,000 48,000 highly acidic 
in isoelectric focusing gels. acidic mr 51,000 mr 48,000 polypeptides
are encoded longer shorter e1a rnas, respectively. two the
host-range mutants, h5hr1 h5hr2, fail synthesize mr 51,000 polypeptide
but produce mr 48,000 polypeptide novel polypeptide thought 
truncated portion mr 51,000 polypeptide. h5hr1 h5hr2 hypothesized 
to termination codons sequences found rna encoding mr 51,000 
polypeptide. prediction verified h5hr1 dna sequence analysis. 
other three host-range mutants (h5hr3-5) synthesize acidic polypeptides 
are predicted missense. results strongly imply mr 51,000
polypeptide, alone combination mr 48,000 polypeptide, needed to
regulate expression adjacent viral genes early phase adenovirus 
infection.
