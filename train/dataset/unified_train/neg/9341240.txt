the high incidence neurologic dysfunction human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv) infection heightened interest neuropathogenesis other
lentiviruses, including associated feline immunodeficiency virus (fiv).
both hiv fiv efficiently enter central nervous system cause primary
neurological disease attributable opportunistic infections or
systemic disease. cells brain infected fiv similar those
observed hiv infection, viruses infect macrophages, microglia, and
astrocytes. although substantial neuronal loss occur cortex hiv- or
fiv-infected patients, studies agree neurons infected and
indirect mechanisms neurotoxicity postulated. review describes recent
information neuropathogenesis fiv information correlates
with known neuropathogenesis hiv. although pathogenesis 
of neurological dysfunction hiv- fiv-infected patients far clear, 
it becoming increasingly evident relationship lentivirus
presence brain neurological signs straightforward cannot be
explained simple cytolytic infection. observed neurologic dysfunction is
likely multifactorial complex involving intricate web subcellular
pathways neurotoxic factors interacting multiple cell types.
