when mdck cells semiconfluent monolayer infected 5 p.f.u. per cell
of influenza virus a/pr/8/34 (h1n1), majority cells continued grow
stably upon subsequent cultivation growth medium containing 50% foetal
calf serum. growing, cells spontaneously excreted virus, amount 
which declined gradually passage number cells increased. extent
of virus shedding significantly increased cells subsequently
maintained medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. within cells,
viral messenger rnas eight genes a/pr/8 demonstrated pcr
indicating endogenous viral genes constitutively transcribed. however, 
viral proteins well viral genes demonstrable by
radioimmunoprecipitation ribonuclease protection assays, respectively.
