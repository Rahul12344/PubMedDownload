insect cells widely used expression variety different proteins by
using baculovirus expression system. applicability system depends
on production proteins biological properties similar their
native counterparts. one application expression viral capsid
proteins assembly empty capsid structures provide new viral
immunogens retain complex antigenic sites. important parameter for
efficient folding assembly proteins viral procapsids may the
intracellular ph, particularly acid-labile particles foot-and-mouth
disease virus (fmdv). benzoic acid used effective indicator of
intracellular ph insect cells 3-o-methyl glucose measure cell volumes. 
we determined intracellular volume thespodoptera frugiperda iplb-sf21
insect cells 0.50±0.08 pl per cell. using distribution [(14)c]-benzoic
acid, show intracellular ph remains constant ph 7.0 cells
are grown media ph values ranging 6.2 6.8 and, moreover, not
affected baculovirus infection. results suggest insect cells are
suitable express produce acid-labile structures via baculovirus
expression system assembly proteins viral procapsids could occur.
