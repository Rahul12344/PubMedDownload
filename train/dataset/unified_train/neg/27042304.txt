cd4(+)cd25(high)foxp3(+) cells suppress excess immune responses lead to
autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases, maintain host immune homeostasis.
however, cd4(+)cd25(high)foxp3(+) cells reportedly contribute disease
progression suppressing immune responses chronic infections. in
this study, kinetic functional analyses cd4(+)cd25(high)foxp3(+) cells
were performed cattle bovine leukemia virus (blv) infections, 
reported immunosuppressive characteristics. initial experiments, production of
the th1 cytokines ifn-γ tnf-α reduced blv-infected cattle compared
with uninfected cattle, numbers ifn-γ tnf-α producing cd4(+) cells
decreased disease progression. contrast, ifn-γ production nk cells was
inversely correlated blv proviral loads infected cattle. additionally,
during persistent lymphocytosis disease stages, nk cytotoxicity depressed 
indicated low expression cytolytic protein perforin. concomitantly,
total cd4(+)cd25(high)foxp3(+) cell numbers percentages tgf-β(+) cells
were increased, suggesting tgf-β plays role functional declines 
cd4(+) cells nk cells. experiments, recombinant bovine tgf-β
suppressed ifn-γ tnf-α production cd4(+) cells nk cytotoxicity in
cultured cells. data suggest tgf-β cd4(+)cd25(high)foxp3(+) t
cells immunosuppressive contributes disease progression the
development opportunistic infections blv infection.
