direct-acting antivirals (daas) targeting ns5a broadly effective against
hepatitis c virus (hcv) infections, sustained virological response rates 
generally lower patients infected genotype (gt)-1a gt-1b viruses.
the explanation remains uncertain. here, adopted highly accurate,
ultra-deep primer id sequencing approach intensively study serial changes in
the ns5a-coding region hcv gt-1a- gt-1b-infected subjects receiving a
short course monotherapy ns5a inhibitor, elbasvir. low or
undetectable levels viremia precluded on-treatment analysis gt-1b-infected 
subjects, variants resistance-associated substitution (ras) y93h 
ns5a dominated rebounding virus populations following cessation treatment.
these variants persisted end study, two months later. in
contrast, y93h emerged multiple lineages became dominant subjects
with gt-1a virus, haplotypes rapidly decreased frequency therapy.
substitutions q30 l31 emerged distinctly independent lineages later 
time points, ultimately coming dominate virus population therapy.
consistent this, cell culture studies gt-1a gt-1b reporter viruses 
and replicons demonstrated y93h confers much greater loss replicative
fitness gt-1a gt-1b virus, l31m/v compensates loss 
of fitness associated q30r (but y93h) also boosts drug resistance.
these observations show differences impact rass drug resistance 
and replicative fitness influence evolution gt-1a gt-1b viruses during
monotherapy antiviral targeting ns5a.
