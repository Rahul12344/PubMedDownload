understanding controlling aggregation essential aspect the
development pharmaceutical proteins improve product yield, potency and
quality consistency. even minute quantity aggregates may reactogenic 
can render final product unusable. self-assembly processing virus-like
particles (vlps) efficient method quicken delivery safe and
efficacious vaccines market low cost. vlp production, the
manufacture many biotherapeutics, susceptible aggregation, may 
minimized use accurate practical mathematical models. however,
existing models virus assembly idealized, predict the
non-native aggregation behavior self-assembling viral subunits tractable 
nor useful way. present mechanistic mathematical model describing vlp
self-assembly accounts partitioning reactive subunits the
correct aggregation pathways. results show unproductive aggregation 
causes 38% product loss competing favorably productive
nucleation self-assembling subunits, therefore limiting availability of
nuclei subsequent capsid growth. protein subunit aggregation reaction
exhibits apparent second-order concentration dependence, suggesting a
dimerization-controlled agglomeration pathway. despite plethora possible
assembly intermediates aggregation pathways, protein aggregation behavior may
be predicted relatively simple yet realistic model. importantly, we
have shown bioengineering model amenable different reactor
formats, thus opening way rational scale-up strategies products that
comprise biomolecular assemblies.
