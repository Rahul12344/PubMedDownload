objective: study's objective estimate human papillomavirus (hpv)
genotype-specific seroprevalence determine population hpv exposure inform 
vaccine policy.
methods: study cross-sectional prevalence survey 878 women of
pueblorrico, rural town colombia. standardized questionnaire used to
obtain information demographic characteristics, sexual reproductive
history, smoking habits. seropositivity hpv-16, -18, -31, -58 was
determined virus-like particles enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
results: overall seropositivity hpv genotype 27.9%. combined
seroprevalence women 15 19 20 24 years old 35.4% (95% confidence
interval [ci], 25.9-46.2) 36.0% (95% ci, 27.7-45.3), respectively.
seroprevalence hpv-16 17% (95% ci, 14.6-19.6); hpv-18, 9.8% (95% ci, 
8.0-11.9); hpv-31, 11.4% (95% ci, 9.5-13.7); hpv 58, 12.5% (95% ci,
10.5-14.9). higher hpv seropositivity associated lifetime number 
occasional sexual partners (odds ratio, 3.05; 95% ci, 1.26-7.37) 
than 2 regular sexual partners (odds ratio, 3.00; 95% ci, 1.21-7.45) women
younger 44 older 45 years old, respectively. use oral
contraceptives tobacco/cigarettes significantly associated reduced
hpv seropositivity women older 45 women younger 44 years 
old.
conclusions: human papillomavirus seropositivity associated measures of
sexual behavior, particularly greater lifetime number sexual partners.
hormonal tobacco/cigarette use may factors influencing hpv
seropositivity women older 45 years old.
