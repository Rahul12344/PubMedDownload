a series linker scanning deletion mutations constructed 5'
leader sequence hiv-1. one virus 13-base-linker substitution upstream
of 5' major splice site impaired ability replicate a
virus large deletion, included 13 bases, less
efficient packaging genomic rna viruses carrying mutations between
the 5' major splice site gag translation initiation site. these
observations led identification conserved pattern repeated
sequence elements associated sequences experimentally defined necessary
for encapsidation moloney murine leukemia virus, spleen necrosis virus, avian 
leukosis-sarcoma viruses, human immunodeficiency virus type 1.
