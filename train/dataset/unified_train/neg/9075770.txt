the present study examined use replication-defective adenovirus in
vitro production immunoadhesin. recombinant adenovirus, rendered
replication defective deletion e1 gene, constructed contain 
murine interleukin-10 gene fused frame hinge, ch2, ch3 domains of
the murine immunoglobulin gamma 1 heavy chain constant region gene the
control human cytomegalovirus promoter. resultant recombinant virus,
ad5.hcmv.mil-10:hfc, used transduce several cell types. expressed
protein, mil-10:hfc, secreted disulfide-bonded homodimer. vitro, a
murine pro-b-cell line expressing transfected recombinant murine interleukin-10
receptor proliferated response purified mil-10:hfc. results obtained
demonstrate relative ease production immunoadhesin using
replication-defective adenovirus.
