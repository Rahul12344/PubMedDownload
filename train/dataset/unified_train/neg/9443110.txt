the predictive value two methods measuring hiv rna concentration plasma
was assessed relation cd4 lymphocyte counts asymptomatic period 
of infection. design retrospective longitudinal case-control study 
a mean period 60 months involving 20 asymptomatic patients included the
french national prospective survey. cd4 counts patients the
last 36 months study stable (non-progressors) declined
(progressors). plasma rna concentrations determined subject annually
using amplicor nasba techniques. amplicor gave rna titers 
cut-off value patients. techniques agreed satisfactorily,
although difference, median 0.4 log10, amplicor nasba
values. non-progressors low stable rna concentrations. the
concentration higher progressors, according amplicor technique,
from inclusion study, according nasba technique, 1
year inclusion. however, four ten individual progressors stable
plasma hiv rna concentrations significantly non-progressors
before decline cd4 counts. patients with
a decline lymphocyte counts 100 cd4/mm3/year. other
progressors, rna concentration significantly different 
the non-progressors. thus, making decisions therapy, plasma hiv rna
determinations cannot used place cd4 counts may provide valuable
additional information.
