the aim study describe epidemiology utilization of
anti-hepatitis b core protein(+) anti-hepatitis c virus(+) organ donor
referrals large organ procurement organization. 1995 2006, 3,134
deceased organ donor referrals tested anti-hbc anti-hcv using
commercial assays. prevalence anti-hcv(+) organ donor referrals
significantly increased 3.4% 1994-1996 8.1% 2003-2005 (p < .001),
whereas prevalence anti-hbc(+) organ donor referrals remained unchanged at
3%-4% (p = .20). 112 anti-hbc(+) (3.5%) 173 anti-hcv(+) (5.5%) organ
donor referrals significantly older likely noncaucasian 
seronegative organ donor referrals (p < .02). procurement utilization
rates seropositive thoracic abdominal donor organs significantly
lower compared seronegative organ donors (p < .0001). however, liver
utilization rates significantly increased anti-hbc(+) donors time (21% 
vs 46%; p = .026), whereas utilization anti-hcv(+) liver donors remained
unchanged time (5% vs 18%; p = .303). summary, proportion of
anti-hcv(+) organ donor referrals significantly increased proportion 
of anti-hbc(+) organ donor referrals remained stable. thoracic and
abdominal organs seropositive donors largely underutilized.
