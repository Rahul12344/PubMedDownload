colorectal cancer aggressive malignancy high mortality rate;
however, effective therapies currently lacking. cancer-targeting
gene-virotherapy (ctgvt) proposed promising strategy cancer 
therapy. purpose study investigate antitumor activity of
the oncolytic adenovirus harboring lipocalin-2 (zd55-lipocalin-2, example of
ctgvt) colorectal cancer. zd55-lipocalin-2 generated deleting e1b55-kd 
and inserting lipocalin-2 gene. cytopathic effects cell growth
inhibition detected vitro, antitumor effects examined nude 
mouse model human colorectal cancer xenografts. results showed that
zd55-lipocalin-2 significantly inhibited colorectal cancer growth by
selective cytolysis, inducing apoptosis decreasing microvessel density in
tumors. anticancer potential zd55-lipocalin-2 showed stronger of
the isolated lipocalin-2 gene therapy isolated zd55 oncolytic adenovirus
therapy. zd55-lipocalin-2 may serve potential anticancer agent for
colorectal cancer treatment.
