while increasing number studies suggest high prevalence 
rotaviruses p8[11], typical p type bovine rotavirus (brv), among human 
neonates infants india, data available distribution g 
p types indian brvs. thus, fecal specimens collected cow buffalo
calves 1 month age organized dairy farms india period
between 1994 1997, 36 rotavirus-positive specimens used determine
the relative frequencies g p types indian brvs. g type,
g10 predominant (83%), followed g6 (6%). majority (94%) brvs had
p8[11], one isolate possessed p6[1]. common combination g
and p types g10p8[11] (81%), followed g6p6[1] (3%) g6p8[11] (3%). 
high prevalence brvs possessing p8[11] vp4s strongly supports hypothesis
that brvs may cross host species barrier circulate among neonates in
india.
