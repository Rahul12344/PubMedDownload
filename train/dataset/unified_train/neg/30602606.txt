following acute infection, herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) establishes lifelong
latency neurons. physical, emotional, chemical stresses linked to
increasing incidence reactivation latency, mechanism of
action well understood. general, stress increases corticosteroid
levels, leading activation glucocorticoid receptor (gr), pioneer
transcription factor. consequently, hypothesized stress-mediated
activation gr stimulate productive infection viral gene
expression. new studies demonstrated gr-specific antagonist
(cort-108297) significantly reduced hsv-1 productive infection mouse
neuroblastoma cells (neuro-2a). additional studies demonstrated the
activated gr krüppel-like transcription factor 15 (klf15) cooperatively
transactivated infected cell protein 0 (icp0) promoter, crucial viral
regulatory protein. interestingly, synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone and
gr klf15 alone little effect icp0 promoter activity transfected
neuro-2a vero cells. chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) studies revealed
that gr klf15 occupied icp0 promoter sequences important for
transactivation 2 4 h infection; however, binding readily
detected 6 h infection. similar results obtained cells
transfected full-length icp0 promoter. icp0 promoter sequences lack a
consensus "whole" gr response element (gre) contain putative half-gres that
were important dexamethasone induced promoter activity. activated gr
stimulates expression of, interacts with, klf15; consequently, data
suggest klf15 gr form feed-forward loop activates viral gene
expression productive infection following stressful stimuli.importance the
ability herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) periodically reactivate latency
results virus transmission recurrent disease. incidence of
reactivation latency increased chronic acute stress. stress
increases levels corticosteroids, bind activate the
glucocorticoid receptor (gr). since gr activation immediate early response 
to stress, tested whether gr influences productive infection the
promoter drives infected cell protein 0 (icp0) expression. pretreatment of
cells gr-specific antagonist (cort-108297) significantly reduced virus
replication. although gr little effect icp0 promoter activity alone,
the krüppel-like transcription factor 15 (klf15) cooperated gr to
stimulate promoter activity transfected cells. transfected infected
cells, gr klf15 occupied icp0 sequences important transactivation.
collectively, studies provide insight stress directly
stimulate productive infection viral gene expression.
