micrornas (mirnas) non-coding endogenous rnas direct
post-transcriptional regulation gene expression several mechanisms.
activity primarily binding 3' untranslated regions (utrs) of
messenger rnas (mrna) resulting degradation translation repression. unlike
other small-rnas, mirnas require perfect base pairing, thus, can
regulate network broad, yet specific, genes. although just
begun gain insights full range biologic functions mirna, 
involvement onset progression disease generated significant
interest therapeutic development. mounting evidence suggests mirna-based
therapies, either restoring repressing mirnas expression activity, hold
great promise. however, despite early promise exciting potential,
critical hurdles often involving delivery mirna-targeting agents remain 
overcome transition clinical applications. limitations may be
overcome delivery include, limited to, poor vivo stability,
inappropriate biodistribution, disruption saturation endogenous rna
machinery, untoward side effects. viral vectors nonviral delivery
systems developed circumvent challenges. viral vectors are
efficient delivery agents toxicity immunogenicity limit clinical
usage. herein, review recent advances mechanisms strategies 
nonviral mirna delivery systems provide perspective future of
mirna-based therapeutics.
