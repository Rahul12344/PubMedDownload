viruses, especially rna viruses, constantly change adapt new host
species vectors, posing potential threat new reemerging infectious
diseases. honey bee acute bee paralysis virus (abpv) deformed wing virus
(dwv) two common honey bee viruses found european honey bees
apis mellifera implicated worldwide varroa-associated bee colony
losses. previous studies shown dwv jumped hosts several times in
history causing infection multiple host species. present study, show
that dwv infection could detected asian honey bee, a. cerana, the
parasitic mite tropilaelaps mercedesae, confirming previous findings dwv 
a multi-host pathogen supporting notion high prevalence dwv
in honey bee host populations could attributed high adaptability of
this virus. furthermore, study provides first evidence abpv occurs
in a. cerana t. mercedesae northern thailand. geographical
proximity host species likely played important role initial exposure
and subsequent cross-species transmission viruses. phylogenetic
analyses suggest abpv might moved t. mercedesae a. mellifera
and a. cerana dwv might moved opposite direction a.
cerana a. mellifera t. mercedesae. result may reflect differences
in virus life history virus-host interactions, warranting further
investigation virus transmission, epidemiology, impacts virus
infections new hosts. results study indicate viral
populations continue evolve likely continue expand host range,
increasing need effective surveillance control virus infections in
honey bee populations.
