bacteriophage sp6 exhibits dual-host adsorption specificity. sp6 tailspikes
are recognized important host range determination mechanisms
underlying dual host specificity unknown. cryo-electron tomography and
sub-tomogram classification used analyze sp6 virion particular
focus interaction tailspikes host membranes. sp6 tail is
surrounded six v-shaped structures interconnect forming a
hand-over-hand hexameric garland. v-shaped structure consists two
trimeric tailspike proteins: gp46 gp47, connected adaptor protein
gp37. sp6 infection salmonella enterica serovars typhimurium newport
results distinguishable changes tailspike orientation, providing first 
direct demonstration tailspikes confer dual host adsorption specificity. 
sp6 also infects s. typhimurium strains lacking antigen; infections
tailspikes apparent specific role phage tail must therefore
interact distinct host receptor allow infection.
