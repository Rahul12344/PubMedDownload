coxsackievirus group b adenovirus receptor (car) major receptor 
adenovirus groups drawn overall attention past decade. although
this protein could potentially used agent blocking adenovirus
infection, large-scale production highly purified human car eukaryotic
expression system reported. present study, showed the
construction recombinant baculovirus highly-expressing extracellular
domain human coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (excar) high five insect
cells. recombinant excar recovered cell culture medium a
secreted soluble protein purified ni-nta affinity chromatography. the
final yield recombinant excar 8-10 mg/l supernatant the
purity 96.3%. binding activity assay showed recombinant excar
exhibited intact ability binding knob domain adenovirus type 
5 fiber protein (ad fiber knob) displayed t7 phage. results showed 
the recombinant human excar produced insect cells purified ni-nta
chromatography retained ability bind ad fiber knob could
potentially used therapy adenovirus infection.
