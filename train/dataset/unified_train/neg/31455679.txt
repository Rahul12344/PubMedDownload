purpose: intratumoral injection oncolytic adenovirus delta-24-rgdox induces
efficacious antiglioma immunity syngeneic glioma mouse models. hypothesized
that localized treatment virus effective disseminated
melanomas.
experimental design: tested therapeutic effect injecting delta-24-rgdox
into primary subcutaneous (s.c.) b16-red-fluc tumors s.c./s.c. and
s.c./intracranial (i.c.) melanoma models c57bl/6 mice. tumor growth in
vivo luciferase-expressing ovalbumin-specific (ot-i/luc) cells monitored
with bioluminescence imaging. cells profiled surface markers flow
cytometry.
results: s.c./s.c. s.c./i.c. models, 3 injections delta-24-rgdox
significantly inhibited growth virus-injected s.c. tumor and
untreated distant s.c. i.c. tumors, thereby prolonging survival. the
surviving mice protected rechallenging tumor cells. the
virus treatment increased presence cells frequency effector t
cells virus-injected tumor mediated changes cells from
peripheral blood, spleen, brain hemispheres untreated tumor. moreover,
delta-24-rgdox decreased numbers exhausted cells regulatory cells 
in virus-injected untreated tumors. consequently, virus promoted 
in situ expansion tumor-specific cells migration tumors
expressing target antigen.
conclusions: localized intratumoral injection delta-24-rgdox induces in
situ antovaccination treated melanoma, effect changes the
immune landscape treated mice, resulting systemic immunity against
disseminated s.c. i.c. tumors.
