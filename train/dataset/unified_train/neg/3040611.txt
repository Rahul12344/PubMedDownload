failure detect dna repair-related defect transfection of
ataxia-telangiectasia cells enzymatically restricted plasmid.

green mh, lowe je.

we transfected two sv40-transformed human fibroblast cell lines with
plasmids double-strand breaks introduced restriction
enzymes, within near selected gene. restriction psv2gpt kpni, as
previously shown cox et al. (1986), reduced frequency transfection more
in ionizing radiation-sensitive ataxia-telangiectasia line at5biva in
the resistant line mrc5v1. related plasmid psv2neo restricted with
smai, reduction transfection less ataxia-telangiectasia in
the normal cell line. conditions, apparent defect transfection
of at5biva psv2gpt appears result unusual sensitivity the
repair-deficient recipient selective agent. loss potential
transfectants exacerbated transient gene expression reduced by
restriction plasmid. suggest reduction yield transfectants
with restricted plasmid ataxia-telangiectasia cells cannot readily used 
evidence defect dna repair. results also relevant standard
transfection experiments, since emphasize importance optimizing
selection transient expression may reduced, ensure potential
transfectants killed selection regime.
