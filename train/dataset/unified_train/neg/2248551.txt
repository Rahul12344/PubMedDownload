ten virus-specific polypeptides ranging molecular weight approximately
200k 11k identified bovine respiratory syncytial virus (brsv-)infected
cells. time course analysis induction viral polypeptides indicated 
that could detected early 30 min post-infection synthesis
reached plateau 12 h infection. cell free translation total
infected-cell mrna rabbit reticulocyte system yielded 7 proteins
corresponding size virus-specific proteins synthesized brsv-infected
cells. p protein highly phosphorylated; g f identified as
glycoproteins [3h]glucosamine labeling. glycosylation g protein largely
resistant tunicamycin, suggesting majority carbohydrate
residues attached via o-glycosidic bonds, whereas f protein n-linked 
glycosylated. tunicamycin caused drastic reduction yield infectious
virus titer indicating carbohydrate moieties serve critical role in
the infectious cycle brsv.
