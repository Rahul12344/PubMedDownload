objective: previous studies shown snail expression integral the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition tumor progression. however, behavior
in clinical head neck squamous cell carcinomas (hnsccs) yet undefined. 
therefore sought (1) investigate clinical histopathologic characteristics 
of snail-positive hnscc (2) understand link snail other
commonly used hnscc tumor markers.
study design: retrospective case-control study conducted.
setting: study conducted large-scale academic center.
study subjects: 51 consecutive hnscc, 42 surgical resections included.
methods: two separate pathologists performed standard histopathologic reviews
along immunohistochemistries (snail, e-cadherin, p16, epidermal growth
factor receptor [egfr]) situ hybridization (human papilloma virus [hpv]). 
medical review cases performed.
results: twenty-two (52%) 42 cases stained 4+ snail (>75% staining). the
remaining 20 cases considered negative. snail strongly inversely related
to e-cadherin expression (ρ = -0.69, p < .001), statistically independent
from hpv, p16, egfr expression. snail(+) tumors equally represented 
each anatomic subsite. snail(+) tumors strongly associated poor
differentiation (p < .001) basaloid classification (p = .004). snail(+)
tumors also strongly associated lymphovascular invasion (p = .02), 
not perineural invasion. ultimately, 11 (50%) 22 snail(+) tumors
demonstrated positive nodal metastasis 11 (79%) 14 node-positive cases
were snail(+) (p = .02).
conclusion: pilot study provides promising evidence snail' role a
molecular prognostic marker hnscc. snail positivity significantly
predictive poorly differentiated, lymphovascular invasive, well as
regionally metastatic tumors. snail positivity appears independent of
hpv, p16, egfr expression, snail may prove improve upon markers'
predictive limitations.
