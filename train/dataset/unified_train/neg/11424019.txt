this study investigated whether immune restoration occurred 26 human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) type 1-infected children treated first with
indinavir 16 weeks combination antiretroviral therapy >2
years. compared baseline, significant, although modest, decrease virus 
loads (maximum median, -0.86 log(10)) increase number cd4(+)
lymphocytes, especially naive cells, observed several time points 2
years. maximum 7% treated children achieved undetectable viremia. there
was marked increase proliferative response skin reactivity recall
antigens. however, responses hiv antigen remained depressed, the
production interleukin-12 remained unchanged abnormally low. magnitude
of virus suppression correlate measures functional immune
reconstitution. findings suggest long-term nonsuppressive
antiretroviral therapy induce limited improvement immune function in
pediatric aids patients effect suppressive treatments be
investigated.
