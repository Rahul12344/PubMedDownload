circulating immune complexes (cic) studied presence human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) antigens (hiv-ag) 55 children infected the
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1). cic elevated 85% of
patients. 33 55 patients cic included least one hiv-ag (hiv-ag-cic).
sixty percent patients p17 antigen, 50% p24 antigen, 16% gp120
associated cic. levels hiv-ag-cic correlate free serum hiv
antigens. patients high hiv-ag-cic severe clinical course 90%
of markedly elevated hiv-ag-cic (greater 3+) died within 6
to 24 months. hiv-ag-cic also present patients including neonates
and young infants free hiv-ag undetectable. monitoring hiv-ag in
isolated cic may value early detection hiv infection for
monitoring disease outcome.
