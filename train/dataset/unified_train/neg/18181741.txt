background: human herpesvirus 6 (hhv-6) infections usually asymptomatic
reactivations adult liver transplant recipients, may also cause fever
or graft dysfunction. hhv-6 infection also present symptoms of
gastroenteritis. study, investigated presence hhv-6 the
gastroduodenal mucosa liver transplant recipients immunocompetent
patients undergoing gastroscopic examination dyspeptic symptoms.
methods: hhv-6 cytomegalovirus (cmv) examinations performed on
gastroduodenal biopsy specimens obtained upper gastrointestinal endoscopic
examinations 90 liver transplant recipients 31 immunocompetent
patients upper gastrointestinal symptoms. gastroduodenal mucosa,
hhv-6 cmv demonstrated immunohistochemistry frozen sections using
monoclonal antibodies hhv-6- cmv-specific antigens.
results: hhv-6-positive cells found biopsy specimens 21 (23%) the
liver transplant recipients 6 (19%) immunocompetent patients,
cmv-positive cells found specimens 55 (61%) transplant
recipients 7 (23%) immunocompetent patients, 12 transplant
recipients found hhv-6 cmv infection. fifteen transplant
recipients positive hhv-6 findings gastroduodenal mucosa also had
hhv-6 antigenemia, whereas 30 patients hhv-6 antigenemia have
gastroduodenal involvement. endoscopic findings patients included
biliary complications 10 patients gastritis 2 patients.
histopathological findings nonspecific included mild inflammation. 
a total 30 (94%) transplant recipients biliary complications also 
had hhv-6 cmv detected duodenal mucosa.
conclusions: hhv-6-positive cells cmv-positive cells frequently found in
the gastroduodenal mucosa liver transplant recipients immunocompetent
patients undergoing gastroscopic examination dyspeptic symptoms.
