steps replication human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) occurring
in virus host preferred targets antiretroviral therapy.
strand transfer unique; dna strand made viral reverse
transcriptase (rt) moved one rna template position another.
understanding mechanism requires knowing whether rt directly mediates the
template exchange dissociates exchange, occurs by
polymer dynamics. earlier work vitro showed presence an
rt-trapping polymer would allow synthesis original donor template but
completely block transfer subsequent synthesis second acceptor
template. one interpretation rt must dissociate transfer, 
an alternative sequestration non-polymerizing rts prevents
polymerization-independent ribonuclease h (rnase h) cleavages donor
template necessary strand exchange. resolve ambiguity, designed 
primer-template system allows strand transfer without rnase h activity.
using rnase h negative mutant rt, showed polymer trap still
prevented strand transfer. confirms rt dissociates strand
transfer. presence hiv-1 nucleocapsid protein, promotes strand
exchange, little effect outcome. additional assays showed both
the wild-type rt multiple nucleoside rt inhibitor-resistant hiv-1 rt
containing extended fingers domain, characterized enhanced
primer-template binding affinity, unable transfer trapping
polymer. implies common sequence variations among rts unlikely to
alter dissociation feature.
