the chemokine system mediates acute inflammation driving leukocyte migration
to damaged infected tissues. however, elevated expression chemokines and
their receptors contribute chronic inflammation malignancy. thus,
great effort taken target molecules. first hint the
druggability chemokine system derived role chemokine
receptors hiv infection. ccr5 cxcr4 function essential co-receptors for
hiv entry, former accounting new hiv infections worldwide. 
by chance, anti-ccr5 compound, maraviroc, first fda-approved chemokine
receptor-targeting drug. ccr5, directing leukocytes sites inflammation
and regulating activation, also represents important player the
inflammatory response. function shared ccr2 selective ligand
ccl2, constitute primary chemokine axis driving recruitment of
monocytes/macrophages inflammatory sites. receptors indeed involved
in pathogenesis several immune-mediated diseases, dual ccr5/ccr2
targeting emerging efficacious strategy targeting either
receptor alone treatment complex human disorders. review, we
focus distinctive complementary contributions ccr5 ccr2/ccl2 in
hiv infection, multiple sclerosis, liver fibrosis associated hepatocellular
carcinoma. emerging therapeutic approaches based inhibition these
chemokine axes highlighted.
