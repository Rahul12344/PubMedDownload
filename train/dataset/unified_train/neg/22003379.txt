the emerging field paleovirology aims study evolutionary age impact
of ancient viruses (paleoviruses) host biology. despite historical emphasis 
on retroviruses, paleoviral 'fossils' recently uncovered broad
swathe viruses. viral imprints upended long-held notions age
and mutation rate viruses. 'direct' paleovirology relies the
insertion viral genes animal genomes, examination adaptive changes in
host genes occurred response paleoviral infections provides a
complementary strategy making 'indirect' paleovirological inferences.
finally, viruses also impacted host biology providing genes hosts have
domesticated purpose.
