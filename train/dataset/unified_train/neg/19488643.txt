objective: investigate seroprevalence rubella antibodies 15 39 year
old population municipal district guaratinguetá.
methods: 996 samples studied collected urban rural zones, after
informed elucidated consent men women stratified age (15 -39
years). rubella igg antibodies detected elisa using commercial kit
rubenostika iggii (organon teknika the, holland). age groups stratified 3
categories: 15-19; 20-29 30-39 years age. statistical analyses were
accomplished software minitab version 14.0 (minitab inc, usa).
results: proportion seropositives antibodies igg class were:
92.7.% positive 15-19 years; 82.4% 20 29 years 90.7% 30-39
years, significant difference seropositive proportions age group
(p <0.001). variation intensity antibody response calculated and
results show significant difference (p = 0.002) means 3 age
groups studied. relation rural urban zone average ratio do/co
for age group, significant tendency towards lower average observed
in rural zone. true seropositive proportions were
calculated.
conclusion: results showed percentage individuals antibodies of
the igg class rubella 20-29 year age group lower 
the younger older age groups. furthermore, difference between
seropositivity urban rural zones discloses susceptibility a
potential continued circulation virus zone.
