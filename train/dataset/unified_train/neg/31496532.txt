background & objectives: influenza virological surveillance essential tool 
for early detection novel genetic variants epidemiologic clinical
significance. study aimed genetically characterize a(h1n1)pdm09 virus
circulating 2017 compare global data.
methods: regional/state viral research diagnostic laboratories (vrdls)
provided influenza diagnosis referred clinical samples shared influenza
a(h1n1)pdm09 positives indian council medical research-national
institute virology (icmr-niv), pune, india, hemagglutinin (ha) gene
phylogenetic analysis. sites manipal, jaipur dibrugarh performed the
sequencing shared sequence data analysis. antiviral
susceptibility influenza viruses assessed known molecular marker h275y
at icmr-niv, pune.
results: eight vrdls well-established influenza diagnostic facilities
and showed increased activity influenza a(h1n1)pdm09 2017. phylogenetic
analysis showed viruses different regions country were
similar a/michigan/45/2015 strain 2017-2018 recommended vaccine 
strain clustered globally circulating clade 6b.1 signature
mutations s84n, s162n i216t. clade 6b.1 showed subgrouping with
additional mutations s74r, s164t i295v; however, significant
association presence mutations severity disease due
to influenza. study viruses sensitive oseltamivir.
interpretation & conclusions: study period, study sites
reported globally circulating a/michigan/45/2015 vaccine strain influenza
a(h1n1)pdm09 viruses remained sensitive oseltamivir. genetic and
antigenic characterization influenza viruses recommended address public 
health concerns.
