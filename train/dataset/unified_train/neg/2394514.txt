dba/2 mice injected i.v. ifn alpha/beta-resistant 3ci8 friend
erythroleukemia cells (flc) metastasize liver spleen. ifn
alpha/beta treatment flc-injected mice increased survival time these
mice developed resistance second challenge flc. efficacy ifn
alpha/beta increasing survival time compared normal
immunocompetent immunodeficient mice. anti-tumor action ifn was
markedly reduced abolished newborn dba/2 mice, adult athymic nu/nu and
beige dba/2 mice, balb/c scid/scid mice. determine phenotype the
effector cells involved, flc-injected dba/2 mice treated antibodies 
asialo-gmi, cd4, cd8 antigens, cyclosporin silica. ifn alpha/beta
treatment proved much less effective mice, indicating variety 
effector cell types participated ifn-induced suppression visceral
metastases. thus, intact immune system appears essential obtain
optimal therapeutic effects ifn alpha/beta experimental model.
