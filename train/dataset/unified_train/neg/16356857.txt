proinflammatory caspases play essential role innate immune responses to
infection regulating cleavage activation proinflammatory cytokines.
activation enzymes requires assembly intracellular molecular
platform, termed inflammasome, comprised members pyrin
domain (pyd)-containing superfamily apoptosis inflammation-regulatory
proteins. report identification characterization a
poxvirus-encoded pyd-containing protein interacts asc-1 component
of inflammasome inhibits caspase-1 activation processing of
il-1beta il-18 induced diverse stimuli. knockout viruses not
express protein unable productively infect monocytes lymphocytes 
due abortive phenotype markedly attenuated susceptible hosts due
to decreased virus dissemination enhanced inflammatory responses sites 
infection. thus, modulation inflammasome function constitutes important
immunomodulatory strategy employed poxviruses circumvent host antiviral
responses.
