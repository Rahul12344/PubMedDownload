the presence human papillomavirus (hpv) type 16 dna biopsies from
precancerous lesions early lesions human cervical cancer, the
integration virus dna host cell dna analysed dot blot and
southern blot hybridizations. hpv 16 dna detected 23% mild dysplasias, 
32% moderate dysplasias, 55% severe dysplasias 62% carcinomas in
situ dot blot hybridization. digestion dna restriction enzymes
psti bamhi followed southern blot analysis revealed presence some
typical restriction fragments hpv 16 dna virus-positive samples. in
addition, detected submolar fragments might represent virus-cell
junction sequences 86% dysplasias, suggesting integration hpv
16 dna could occur precancerous stage.
