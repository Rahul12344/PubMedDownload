caughey g, wong h, gamsu g, golden j.

we compared conventional bronchoscopic transbronchial biopsy (tbb) and
bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage
(nb-bal) nine patients acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids) and
bilateral lung infiltrates. nb-bal carried control-tipped reusable
catheter. patient, bronchoscopic procedures performed right
lung, followed immediately nb-bal left lung. specimens obtained 
nb-bal confirmed presence p carinii pneumonia seven eight patients
in diagnosis established tbb bal. viral cultures nb-bal
specimens yielded cytomegalovirus (cmv) four five subjects evidence of
cmv via bronchoscopic technique, including two instances cmv not
detected bal. complications limited right-sided pneumothorax
attributable tbb. accuracy nb-bal appears comparable of
conventional bronchoscopic approaches diagnosis aids-related pulmonary 
infection p carinii cmv. nb-bal may safer economical
alternative tbb bal diagnosis pulmonary opportunistic
infections.
