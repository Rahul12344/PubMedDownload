background: gene transfer costimulatory blockade molecule ctla-4ig into
cold-preserved rat liver allografts results indefinite allograft survival.
despite local delivery, mode immunomodulation associated systemic
immunosuppression. effort restrict immunosuppression graft, we
have constructed novel adenoviral vector, adctla-4ex-tag, ig
sequence ctla-4ig dna deleted destabilize gene product to
promote rapid extrahepatic degradation maintaining immunosuppressive
activity within graft milieu.
methods: (1) vector construction. ctla-4 extracellular binding domain (ctla-4ex) 
was prepared pcr-based cloning methods fused frame genetic element
encoding epitope tag allowing identification transgene product
ctla-4extag. ctla-4extag subcloned shuttle vector enabling isolation
of adctla-4extag. (2) vitro transfection: adctla-4extag transfected into
mh(1)c(1) cells supernatant recovered western blot analysis. (3)
in vitro alloimmune response characterized cfse proliferation assay. (4)
extrahepatic effect adctla-4extag characterized ability control 
tumor growth implantation regressive, immune sensitive cancer cell
line (regb) skin bdix rats liver transduction adctla-4extag.
results: expression secretion recombinant protein documented by
western blot infection mh(1)c(1) cell line() adctla-4extag.
addition infected mh(1)c(1) cell supernatant resulted abrogation of
alloimmune response shown markedly diminished division cd4(+) cells in
a cfse proliferation assay. extrahepatic tumor regressed normally liver
transduction adctla-4extag.
conclusions: results show efficient vitro expression ctla-4extag
after transfection adctla-4extag. modified protein retains ability
to abrogate vitro alloimmune response. efficient control extrahepatic tumor
growth liver-directed delivery adctla-4extag suggests the
immunosuppressive effect vector restricted liver. results
set ground utilization novel adenoviral vector the
transplant setting.
