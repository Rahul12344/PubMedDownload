we investigated effects l-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (otc;
procysteine), cysteine prodrug, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) 
expression adult peripheral cord blood mononuclear phagocytes and
lymphocytes. otc suppressed hiv-1 expression monocyte-derived macrophages
(mdm) lymphocytes dose-dependent fashion determined hiv-1 reverse 
transcriptase (rt) activity. inhibitory effect otc occurred three
hiv-1 strains (two laboratory-adapted strains one primary isolate). addition 
of otc chronically hiv-1-infected mdm cultures also suppressed rt activity 
40 50% comparison untreated controls. inhibitory effects otc on
hiv-1 caused toxicity mdm lymphocytes no
change cell viability cellular dna synthesis, evaluated trypan blue
dye exclusion [3h]thymidine incorporation, doses otc inhibit virus
replication. observations indicate otc potential limit
hiv-1 replication mononuclear phagocytes lymphocytes may useful 
the treatment hiv-1 infection aids.
