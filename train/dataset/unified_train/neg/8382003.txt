cytomegalovirus (cmv) recognized common cause infectious esophagitis
in patients acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). radiographic 
and endoscopic findings variable, although features suggestive
of cmv esophagitis, none specific. mainstay diagnosis this
disease histologic demonstration characteristic intranuclear 
intracytoplasmic inclusions. report three patients aids-related cmv
esophagitis cytologic smears esophageal brushings contained
diagnostic cells characterized nuclear cytoplasmic enlargement; marginated
chromatin; large, basophilic intranuclear inclusions surrounded clear halo; 
and granular, eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions. one case initial
diagnosis made biopsies, careful review cells
diagnostic cmv infection identified cytologic smears. patient, 
numerous cells herpes simplex virus-related changes present and
probably masked presence cmv-infected cells. contrast, biopsies
from another patient showed necrotic debris inflammatory cells, whereas 
the cytologic preparations revealed cells characteristic cmv inclusions.
with improved therapy often-debilitating opportunistic infection, rapid 
and accurate diagnosis imperative. cytology complements histology, and
concurrent use diagnostic modalities detect cmv esophagitis more
frequently either technique alone.
