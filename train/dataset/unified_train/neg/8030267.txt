the neurotropic virus jc (jcv) causes demyelinating disease progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy. jcv transcriptionally regulated both
positive negative cis elements. previous studies shown the
agggaaggga sequence, isolation, interacts 53- 56-kda cellular
protein acts silencer late promoter. reexamined role
of agggaaggga element glial cell-specific transcriptional regulation
of jcv studying longer natural context elements jcv early
promoter. transcriptional analysis c6 glial cells selectively mutated
agggaaggga domains within nt 98-153 region jcv early promoter revealed
that ggg regions agggaaggga sequence required glial
cell-specific transcription. interactions cellular proteins the
agggaaggga domain also found dependent upon presence absence of
neighboring cis elements. tata region found facilitate interaction
of specific proteins agggaaggga domain. domain-specific
photocrosslinking studies revealed binding glial cell protein of
approximately 70-80 kda agggaaaggga domain flanked its
neighboring cis elements, tata nf-1 domains jcv promoter.
