reverse transcriptase-dependent polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) applied to
the detection differentiation viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (vhsv)
and infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (ihnv) using primer pairs designed
for amplification glycoprotein g-specific gene fragments two
viruses. products 443 bp (vhs) 548 bp (ihn), respectively, were
amplified total rna extracts rtg-2 cells infected total 9
different strains either vhs virus ihn virus. restriction analysis using
foki, dna sequencing pcr products demonstrated specificity the
amplification. rt-pcr amplification vhsv ihnv g-genes found a
simple, highly specific sensitive method allowing differential diagnosis of
vhs ihn within 8 h.
