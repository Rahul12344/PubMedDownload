inflammation associated excitotoxicity may play important roles various
neurodegenerative diseases including aids dementia. show exposure of
rat parietal cortical slices hiv glycoproteins gp120 gp41 triggered
very rapid releases neurotransmitters glutamate [(3)h]noradrenaline
(na), neuromodulator adenosine. gp41 effective gp120 
releasing glutamate [(3)h]na, glycoproteins equi-effective at
releasing adenosine. responses gp120 gp41 declined rapidly basal
levels following removal. seems possible rapid, inappropriate
excitation may occur immediate vicinity hiv infections brain,
possibly producing transient neurological psychiatric symptoms
associated aids dementia.
