damage intestinal mucosa results translocation microbes the
intestinal lumen circulation. microbial translocation proposed 
to trigger immune activation, inflammation, coagulopathy, are
key factors drive hiv disease progression non-hiv comorbidities;
however, direct proof causal link still lacking. here, have
demonstrated treatment acutely siv-infected pigtailed macaques the
drug sevelamer, binds microbial lipopolysaccharide gut, dramatically
reduces immune activation inflammation slightly reduces viral
replication. furthermore, sevelamer administration reduced coagulation
biomarkers, confirming contribution microbial translocation the
development cardiovascular comorbidities siv-infected nonhuman primates.
together, data suggest early control microbial translocation may
improve outcome hiv infection limit noninfectious comorbidities
