a fluorometric assay avoiding use radioactivity developed for
detecting cytotoxic lymphocytes (tc cells). method involves labelling
targets hoechst dye no. 33342 (h33342) becomes brightly fluorescent on
binding dna. lysis target cells tc cells quantified measuring 
release fluorescent h33342 supernatant culture wells. the
fluorescence measured using automated microfluor reader allows
results obtained rapidly. assay used detect alloreactive tc
cells h-2 restricted tc cells influenza virus short-term 6 h
assay using p815 l929 targets comparable results obtained
with 51cr labelling. contrast, lymphocyte blasts found less
sensitive 6 h fluorometric assays compared 51cr assay. in
long-term overnight assays (possible low spontaneous release of
h33342 targets) lymphocyte blasts gave high specific lysis some
anti-self reactivity. cause anti-self reactivity may reflect
fundamental differences h33342 51cr release assays.
