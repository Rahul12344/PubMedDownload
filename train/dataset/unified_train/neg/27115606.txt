epidemiological studies validated association hepatitis c virus 
(hcv) infection hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). increasing number of
studies show protein-protein interactions (ppis) hcv proteins and
host proteins play vital role infection mediate hcc progression. this
work, collected published interaction hcv human proteins,
which include 455 unique human proteins participating 524 hcv-human
interactions. then, construct hcv-human hcv-hcc protein interaction
networks, display biological knowledge regarding mechanism hcv
pathogenesis, particularly respect pathogenesis hcc. in-depth 
analysis hcv-hcc interaction network, found interactors are
enriched jak/stat, p53, mapk, tnf, wnt, cell cycle pathways. using a
random walk restart algorithm, predicted importance protein
in hcv-hcc network found akt1 may play key role hcc
progression. moreover, found ns5a promotes hcc cells proliferation and
metastasis activating akt/gsk3β/β-catenin pathway. work provides basis 
for detailed map tracking new cellular interactions hcv identifying
potential targets hcv-related hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.
