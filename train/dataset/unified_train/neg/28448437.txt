the abnormal elevation sulfiredoxin (srx/srxn1)-an antioxidant enzyme whose
main function protect oxidative stress-has shown closely
correlated progression several types cancer, including human
cervical cancer. however, molecular mechanism srx promotes tumor
progression, especially cancer metastasis cervical cancer, been
elucidated. here, show srx expression gradually increases the
progression human cervical cancer expression level closely
correlated lymph node metastasis. study also reveals significant
positive correlation expression srx β-catenin cervical
cancer tissues. loss-of-function studies demonstrate srx knockdown using a
lentiviral vector-mediated specific shrna decreases migration invasion
capacity hela (human papilloma virus 18 type cervical cancer cell line) and
siha siha (cervical squamous cancer cell line). notably, exact opposite
effects observed gain-of-function experiments c-33a cells.
mechanistically, downregulation upregulation srx leads altered
expression proteins associated wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
furthermore, blockage wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway contributed to
attenuated srx expression resulted significant inhibition cell
migration invasion cervical cancer cell lines. combined, srx might an
oncoprotein cervical cancer, playing critical roles activating the
wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway; may therefore therapeutic target for
cervical cancer.
