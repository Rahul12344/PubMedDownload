the present study undertaken investigate effect dengue type 2 virus
(dv) dv-induced cytokines (cf cf2) lymphocyte subpopulations of
spleen flow cytometry. following dv-ic inoculation mice percent number 
of cd4+ cd8+ lymphocytes spleen reduced, peak reduction in
both observed 6th day post-inoculation (p.i.). intravenous inoculation
of cf cf2 mice also decreased percent number cd4+ well cd8+ 
lymphocytes subpopulation spleen, maximum reduction observed 
1 2 hr, respectively. reduction lymphocyte subpopulation cf and
cf2 found dose dependent. thus, alterations lymphocyte
subpopulations dv infection mediated via cytokines.
