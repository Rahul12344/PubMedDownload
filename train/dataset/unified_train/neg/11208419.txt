low density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) proposed candidate receptor
for hepatitis c virus (hcv). according previous reports, free
beta-lipoproteins human serum may regulate rate hepatocyte infection 
by competing virus. therefore, serum hcv levels regulated by
the rise fall serum beta-lipoproteins since infection rate virions 
influences hcv replication hepatocytes release virions hepatocytes. 
in study, examined relationship serum beta-lipoproteins and
hcv-antigen (ag) levels patients chronic type c hepatitis. patients 
selected based strict criteria eliminate factors might influence
serum hcv levels. serum concentrations beta-lipoproteins hcv-ag were
measured two times within 3 months patient. result showed
that hcv-ag levels negatively correlated increased
beta-lipoproteins. results support concept ldlr hcv receptor
and beta-lipoproteins competitively inhibit infection hepatocytes
with hcv ldlr.
