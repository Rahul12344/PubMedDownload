background: human papilloma virus (hpv) major cause cervical cancer.
use hpv genotyping cervical screening programs monitoring the
effectiveness hpv vaccination programs requires access economical,
high-throughput technology.
methods: used sequenom massarray platform develop high-throughput
mass spectrometric (ms) method detecting 14 specific oncogenic hpv genotypes 
in multiplex pcr products. compared results 532 cervical cell samples 
the comparison method, reverse dot blot hybridization (rdbh).
results: ms method detected samples found positive rdbh. addition, 
the ms method identified 5 cases cervical disease (cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia grade higher) rdbh analysis missed. discrepancies in
specific genotypes noted 20 samples, positive ms, overall 
concordance kappa = 0.945.
conclusions: ms high-throughput method, processing capacity 10 x
384 samples within 2 working days consumables cost us$2 per
sample, performed well better comparison method.
