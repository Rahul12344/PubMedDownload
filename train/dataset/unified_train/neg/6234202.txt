cloning expression phage mu gene.

roulet r, allet b, chandler m.

we cloned phage mu gene, without gene ner, the
control pl promoter phage lambda multicopy plasmid vector. we
demonstrate plasmid-carrying cells able support growth of
superinfecting mu phages temperature-dependent fashion host strain
carrying defective lambda prophage specifies ci857-coded lambda
repressor. addition, show presence ner gene reduces the
efficiency plating superinfecting phage. analysis proteins specified
by cloned mu fragments indicates two proteins, 70 33 kdal, are
synthesized. level synthesis, compared vector-encoded
beta-lactamase, found increase temperature. indicates their
transcription driven pl promoter. mr 70-kdal protein is
identical previously observed pa.
