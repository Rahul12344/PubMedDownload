pseudomonas aeruginosa ubiquitous organism emerged major
public health threat hospital environments. overuse antibiotics has
significantly exacerbated emergence multi-drug resistant bacteria 
p. aeruginosa. phages currently utilized successfully aquaculture, 
agriculture veterinary applications. aim study isolate and
characterize lytic p. aeruginosa phage sewage ilam, iran. phage was
isolated sewage added enrichment along host and
subsequently filtered. plaque assay done using overlay method (also
called double agar layer method). purified plaques amplified for
characterization. finally, rapd-pcr method conducted genotyping and
transition electron micrograph (tem) recruited determine morphology and
phage family. phage high concentration tremendous effects a
variety clinical general laboratory strains (atcc15693) p. aeruginosa. 
among set primers rapd panel, p2 rapd5 primers, useful in
differentiating phages. tem images revealed isolated phages were
members siphoviridae family. phage effectiveness specificity
towards target bacteria potential control biofilm formations be
investigate studies.
