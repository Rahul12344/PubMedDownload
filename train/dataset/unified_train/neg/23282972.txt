histologic transformation low-grade b-cell lymphoma diffuse large b-cell
lymphoma associated poor prognosis. although plasma cell differentiation 
is common lymphomas, overt plasmablastic transformation (pbl-t) has
been rarely reported. report 6 cases pbl-t occurring 3 chronic
lymphocytic leukemias (cll) 3 follicular lymphomas. five patients men,
and mean age 65 years (range, 52 72 y). none history of
immunodeficiency. 3 cases pbl-t occurred 34 85 months initial
diagnosis, 3 detected simultaneously small cell component 
at diagnosis. patients received chemotherapy transformation, 4 died
4 24 months diagnosis. 3 cases, pbl-t occurred extranodal 
site. pbl-ts immunoblastic morphology admixed plasma cells, were
cd20 pax5 negative, expressed λ light chain, 5 cd138 positive. all
cases negative hhv8, 1 pbl-t epstein-barr virus positive.
evidence clonal relationship small cell pbl-t components was
found 5 cases. 2 cll cases, components 13q deletions, all
follicular lymphoma cases components harbored t(14;18) translocation.
myc translocations observed 2 cases transformed cll. in
conclusion, pbl-t expands clinicopathologic spectrum transformation of
low-grade b-cell lymphomas. transformed tumors clinically,
histologically, phenotypically similar primary plasmablastic lymphomas,
but associated immunodeficiency rarely epstein-barr
virus infection myc alterations.
