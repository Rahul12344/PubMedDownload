patients receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation bone marrow
transplantation (bmt) therapy various malignancies autoimmune diseases 
have increased risk infectious complications posttransplant, especially in
the lung. used bmt mice murine gammaherpesvirus, gammahv-68, to
study efficacy adaptive immune responses post-bmt. five weeks
posttransplant, mice fully reconstituted hematopoietic lineages in
both lung periphery. challenged virus, however, bmt mice a
reduced ability clear lytic virus lung. defective viral control in
bmt mice related impaired leukocyte recruitment defective apc
function. rather, bmt mice characterized defective cd4 cell proliferation,
skewing effector cd4 cells th1 th17 phenotype, an
immunosuppressive lung environment time infection includes
overexpression tgf-beta1 pge(2) increased numbers regulatory t
cells. neither indomethacin treatment block pg synthesis anti-cd25
depletion regulatory cells improved antiviral host defense post-bmt.
transplanting mice transgenic bone marrow expressing dominant-negative
tgf-betarii permissive cd4 promoter created mice effector cd4 
and cd8 cells unresponsive tgf-beta1. mice tgf-beta1-nonresponsive
effector cells restored antiviral immunity improved th1 responses
post-bmt. thus, results indicate overexpression tgf-beta1 following
myeloablative conditioning post-bmt results impaired effector cell responses
to viral infection.
