background objective: wnt signaling pathway plays important role the
carcinogenesis hepatitis b virus (hbv)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc).
beta-catenin protein pivotal regulator pathway. genetic mutation 
been observed codons 32-45 exon 3 beta-catenin gene hcc tissues. 
this study investigate correlation genetic polymorphisms of
beta-catenin hbv-related hcc.
methods: conducted epidemiologic genetic investigation 162 patients
with hbv-related hcc. according matching requirements, patients or
without family history hcc paired ratio 1:1. exon 3 of
beta-catenin gene detected polymerase chain reaction (pcr) dna
sequencing. single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) rs28931588, rs28931589, codons
31-46 sequences genetic investigation analyzed.
results: among 162 hcc patients, 16 (9.88%) family history hcc; 12
patients family history hcc 12 without family history matched.
the 24 patients showed g rs28931588 rs28931589. three patients showed 
mutation codons 32-46 genetic polymorphisms. definite mutational
regularity characteristic mutational site observed.
conclusion: snp rs28931588, rs28931589 codons 31-46 sequences may 
genetic markers hbv-related hcc.
