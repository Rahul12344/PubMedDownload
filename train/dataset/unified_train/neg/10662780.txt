by expression cloning method using fas-transgenic balb3t3 cells, tried to
obtain inhibitory genes fas-mediated apoptosis identified
proto-oncogene c-k-ras. transient expression k-ras mutants revealed that
oncogenic mutant k-ras (rasv12) strongly inhibited, whereas dominant-inhibitory
mutant k-ras (rasn17) enhanced, fas-mediated apoptosis inhibiting
fas-triggered activation caspases without affecting expression level of
fas. among target molecules ras, including raf (mitogen-activated protein 
kinase kinase kinase [mapkkk]), phosphatidylinositol 3 (pi-3) kinase, ral
guanine nucleotide exchange factor (ralgds), constitutively active form 
of raf (raf-caax) could inhibit fas-mediated apoptosis. addition, the
constitutively active form mapkk (sdse-mapkk) suppressed fas-mediated
apoptosis, mkp-1, phosphatase specific classical mapk, canceled the
protective activity oncogenic k-ras (k-rasv12), raf-caax, sdse-mapkk.
furthermore, physiological activation ras basic fibroblast growth factor
(bfgf) protected fas-transgenic balb3t3 cells fas-mediated apoptosis. bfgf
protection also dependent activation mapk pathway ras. 
all results indicate activation mapk ras inhibits
fas-mediated apoptosis balb3t3 cells, may play role oncogenesis.
