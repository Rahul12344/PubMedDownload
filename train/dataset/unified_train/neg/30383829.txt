rna viruses known rna-protein (rnp) entities capable autonomous
replication (albeit within permissive host environment). 33.5 kilobase (kb)
nidovirus considered close upper size limit entities;
conversely, minimal cellular dna genome 100-300 kb range. this
large difference presents daunting gap transition primordial rnp
to contemporary dna-rnp-based life. whether rna viruses represent
transitional steps towards dna-based life, studies larger rna viruses advance 
our understanding size constraints rnp entities role genome 
size virus adaptation. example, emergence largest previously known 
rna genomes (20-34 kb positive-stranded nidoviruses, including coronaviruses) 
is associated acquisition proofreading exoribonuclease (exon)
encoded open reading frame 1b (orf1b) monophyletic subset of
nidoviruses. however, apparent constraints size orf1b, encodes
this key replicative enzymes, hypothesized limit further
expansion viral rna genomes. here, characterize novel nidovirus
(planarian secretory cell nidovirus; pscnv) whose disproportionately large
orf1b-like region including unannotated domains, overall 41.1-kb genome,
substantially extend presumed limits rna genome size. genome encodes 
a predicted 13,556-aa polyprotein unconventional single orf, yet retains
canonical nidoviral genome organization expression, well key
replicative domains. domains may include functionally relevant
substitutions rarely never observed highly conserved sites rdrp, 
niran, exon 3clpro. evolutionary analysis suggests pscnv diverged
early multi-orf nidoviruses, acquired additional genes, including 
typical large dna viruses hosts, e.g. ankyrin fibronectin type ii,
which might modulate virus-host interactions. pscnv's greatly expanded genome,
proteomic complexity, unique features-impressive themselves-attest 
likelihood still-larger rna genomes awaiting discovery.
