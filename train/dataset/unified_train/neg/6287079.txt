hybrid cell lines prepared fusion balb/c myeloma p3u-1 cells 
the lymphocytes balb/c mice immunized syngeneic rous sarcoma
virus (rsv)-induced tumor csa1m cells. three clones hybrid progeny (3.4b2,
3.4c6, 3.5c11) produced cytotoxic igm antibodies csa1m cells. one 
the clones, 3.5c11, chosen analysis detailed specificity. both
direct cytotoxicity assays absorption tests revealed monoclonal antibody
from 3.5c11 positive csa1m cells failed react with
other tumors, including 20 rsv-induced mouse tumors, normal cells. 3.5c11
monoclonal antibody alone, without exogenous complement, suppressive 
in therapy ip injected csa1m tumor syngeneic hosts, significant
prolongation survival seen treated mice. results clearly
showed presence individually distinct tumor-specific cell surface antigen
on rsv-induced mouse tumor.
