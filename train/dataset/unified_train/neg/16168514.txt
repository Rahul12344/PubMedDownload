background/aims: interferon (ifn) inducible mxa protein endowed with
antiviral activity broad range rna viruses. previous vitro
study, demonstrated mxa inhibits hepatitis b virus (hbv) replication,
arguing antiviral activity mxa restricted rna viruses but
also includes dna virus. aim present study further
demonstrate vivo antiviral action mxa hbv.
methods: generated hbv hbv/mxa transgenic mice lacking functional
ifn-alpha/beta receptor thus constituting good model evaluate
mxa-induced virus resistance. hbv proteins expression, viral load hbv
replication compared hbv hbv/mxa mice.
results: mxa-dependent moderate inhibitory effect hbv expression only
observed female hbv/mxa mice, mxa downregulates (i) viral hbeag and
capsid protein expression, (ii) viremia (iii) hbv replication decreasing
the synthesis hbv dna replicative intermediates. furthermore, effects
were associated changes steady-state levels hbv rnas.
conclusions: results show vivo, mxa able per se reduce hbv
expression post-transcriptional mechanism, thus participates the
antiviral activity ifn-alpha hbv.
