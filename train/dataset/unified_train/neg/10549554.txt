reducing phenylpropanoid biosynthesis transgenic tobacco compromises systemic 
acquired resistance (sar) tobacco mosaic virus, increasing
phenylpropanoid biosynthesis enhances sar. surprisingly, transgenic tobacco
plants compromised sar exhibit effective grazing-induced systemic
resistance larvae heliothis virescens, whereas induced insect resistance is
compromised transgenic plants elevated phenylpropanoid levels. levels 
the phenylpropanoid-derived signal salicylic acid directly correlated with
overall phenylpropanoid biosynthesis series transgenic plants.
moreover, pathogen-induced sar almost completely compromised in
salicylic acid-deficient plants expressing bacterial nahg salicylate
hydroxylase gene, plants show enhanced grazing-induced insect resistance
compared wild-type. hence, suppression grazing-induced insect resistance is
mediated least part salicylic acid likely reflects salicylic acid
inhibition synthesis action wound signal jasmonic acid. we
propose dual functions salicylic acid contribute signal poise
which constrains constitutive expression disease insect resistance
mechanisms, reciprocally switches selective activation.
