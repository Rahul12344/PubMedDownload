purpose: investigated expression human endogenous retrovirus k (herv-k)
transcripts various tumor tissues transformed cell lines.
experimental design: performed reverse transcription-pcr analysis examine
expression env reading frame transcripts mammary carcinoma biopsies,
germ-cell tumor samples, ovarian carcinomas, lymphocytes leukemic
patients, well variety transformed cell lines. novel np9 gene
was analyzed sequencing. expression recombinant np9 protein shown
by western blot analysis immunofluorescence studies polyclonal
np9-specific antibodies. subcellular localization determined a
np9-enhanced-green fluorescence protein fusion protein, effects np9 on
cell proliferation survival studied growth standard colony
formation assays.
results: identified novel gene, np9, within herv-k env-reading
frame gives rise 9-kda protein localized predominantly cell
nucleus. np9 transcript results novel, herv-k type 1-specific splice donor
site expressed various tumor tissues transformed cell lines not
in normal, nontransformed cells.
conclusion: highly specific expression np9 tumor tissue suggests that
the protein may possess function tumorigenesis.
