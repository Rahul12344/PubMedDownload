objective: estimating prevalence chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection
in generally low-prevalence populations containing communities higher
disease burden difficult. study conducted estimate prevalence 
of serological markers infection with, immunity to, hbv victorian
population analyse trends estimates time.
methods: serological survey 3,212 samples convenience collected the
years 1995, 2000 2005 conducted using selection procedure designed to
reduce selection bias. samples tested hepatitis b surface core
antibodies; core antibody positive samples (indicating previous infection)
were tested presence hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag).
results: hbsag prevalence 1.1% (95%ci 0.8-1.6%) significant differences 
observed area residence, age, gender test year. serological evidence of
immunisation infants adolescents lower established estimates
following introduction universal vaccination groups.
conclusions: study emphasises significant growing problem chronic
hbv infection victoria suggests lower expected population immunity
deriving universal vaccination programs.
implications: greater efforts needed formulate comprehensive public
health response address relatively neglected blood borne viral infection,
the burden significant marginalised sections our
community. increased attention improving universality immunisation 
programs also needed.
