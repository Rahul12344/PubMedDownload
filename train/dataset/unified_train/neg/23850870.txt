infectious salmon anaemia virus (isav) orthomyxovirus causing anaemia and
circulatory disease high mortality farmed atlantic salmon (salmo salar). 
orthomyxoviruses unusual rna viruses replicate nucleus 
some viral transcripts undergo splicing. nuclear replication necessitates a
tightly controlled nuclear import export viral proteins. isav genomic
segment 7 two known mrnas transcribed; one collinear genomic
segment, coding non-structural protein, one spliced transcript,
s7orf2, coding protein unknown function. report initial
functional analysis s7orf2 protein. results indicate s7orf2
protein gradually accumulates host cell virus replication cycle,
locates predominantly cytoplasm part purified virus particles.
trapping s7orf2 nucleus obtained treatment leptomycin b, an
inhibitor crm1-mediated nuclear export, indicating s7orf2 use crm1 for
the nuclear exit. immunofluorescent staining cells over-expressing s7orf2
and matrix protein (m) showed co-localization nucleus. however, s7orf2
protein found interact viral nucleoprotein (np) m
proteins isav infected cells well purified viral particles. these
results indicate s7orf2 could called isav nuclear export protein,
isav/nep.
