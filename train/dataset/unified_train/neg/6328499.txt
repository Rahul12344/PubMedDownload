caldesmon calmodulin-binding f-actin-binding protein originally purified
from chicken gizzard smooth muscle. protein binds f-actin filaments 
ca2+- calmodulin-dependent "flip-flop" fashion, thereby regulating the
function actin filaments. report various lines cultured cells 
contain mr 77,000 protein specifically reacts affinity-purified
caldesmon antibody raised chicken gizzard caldesmon . among the
fibroblast proteins pulse-labeled [35s]methionine, mr
77,000 protein protein band detected nadodso4 gel that
reacted anticaldesmon . subcellular distribution mr 77,000
protein investigated indirect immunofluorescence technique using the
anticaldesmon . fibroblast cell lines examined, immunofluorescence
localized along cellular stress fibers leading edges cell. in
rous sarcoma virus-transformed cells (s7-1), however, distribution the
fluorescence changed diffuse blurred appearance. staining patterns
of anticaldesmon obtained normal transformed cells coincided with
those antiactin corresponding states, strongly suggesting the
functional linkage mr 77,000 protein actin filaments. propose 
to refer mr 77,000 protein caldesmon 77. cellular level of
caldesmon 77 transformed s7-1 cells decreased one-third in
their normal counterparts (cell line no. 7). essentially result was
obtained normal rat kidney cells infected temperature-sensitive
transformation mutant schmidt-ruppin strain rous sarcoma virus (68 n2 clone). 
the cellular level caldesmon 77 observed permissive temperature (35
degrees c) one-third nonpermissive temperature (38.5
degrees c). changes caldesmon 77 transformed cells may correlate with
the loss ca2+ regulation transformed state.
