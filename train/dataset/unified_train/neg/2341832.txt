antibodies e. coli-produced hiv-1 nef, rev, tat, vpu, vpr proteins were
measured enzyme immunoassay serial sets sera 72 men seroconverting 
for antibodies hiv-1 structural proteins, 190 initially symptom-free 
men seropositive antibodies entry study. the
men seroconverting antibodies structural proteins levels nef-,
rev-, tat-specific antibodies, vpu-, vpr-specific antibodies, 
within 3 months seroconversion, appeared lower five men
progressing aids, compared men remaining symptom-free during
follow-up. analysis prevalence previously described antibody profiles
to accessory gene products carried out. hiv-1 antibody
seroconverters hiv-1 antibody seropositive men 15 more
months follow-up progressed aids, shift predominantly 
nef- vpu-specific antibody negative profiles men developing aids in
the early years study predominantly nef- vpu-specific antibody
positive profiles men developed aids later. rev- tat-specific antibody
negative profiles dominant men progressing aids throughout follow-up. 
no vpr-specific antibody profile occurred preferentially men progressing
to aids throughout follow-up. low antibody reactivity accessory gene products 
nef, rev, tat appears, like low anti-core antibody reactivity, be
associated progression aids relatively rapidly infection with
hiv-1.
