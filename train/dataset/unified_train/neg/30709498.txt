aphids amongst damaging pests plants use stylets to
penetrate plant tissue consume large amounts phloem sap thus
deprive plant photoassimilates. addition, aphids vector important 
viral diseases plants. plant defenses targeting aphids broadly classified 
as antibiosis, interferes aphid growth, survival fecundity, and
antixenosis, influences aphid behavior, including plant choice feeding 
from sieve elements. review multitude steps infestation
process defenses exerted highlight progress made on
identifying molecular factors mechanisms contribute host defense,
including plant resistance genes signaling components, well as
aphid-derived effectors elicit attenuate host defenses. also discussed is
the impact aphid-vectored plant viruses plant-aphid interaction the
concept tolerance, allows plant withstand recover damage
resulting infestation.
