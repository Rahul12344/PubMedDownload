mutational inactivation tumor suppressor gene p53 common in
hepatocellular carcinomas (hcc). agg agt transversion codon 249 exon 7
of p53 gene occurs 50% hcc endemic regions, both
chronic infection hepatitis b virus (hbv) exposure carcinogens
such aflatoxin b1 (afb1) prevail. study, report effect the
hbv x protein (hbx) carcinogen-induced cytotoxicity agg agt mutation in
codon 249 p53 gene human liver cell line ccl13. expression hbx, 
as revealed transactivation function, results enhanced cell
susceptibility cytotoxicity induced afb1 active metabolite,
afb1-8,9-epoxide, benzo(a)pyrene diol-epoxide. similar conditions,
expression hbx promotes apoptosis subset cell population. exposure 
afb1-8, 9-epoxide alone induces low frequency agg agt mutation codon
249 p53 gene, determined allele-specific polymerase chain
reaction (as-pcr) assay. however, expression hbx enhances frequency of
afb1-epoxide-induced agg agt mutation compared control cells. summary,
this study demonstrates expression hbx enhances liver cell susceptibility
to carcinogen-induced mutagenesis, possibly alteration balance
between dna repair apoptosis, two cellular defense mechanisms against
genotoxic stress.
