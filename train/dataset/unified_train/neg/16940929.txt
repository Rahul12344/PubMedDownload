background: clinical course cholesteatoma rather unpredictable, some
cases show aggressive development, others mild, 'benign'
nature. aim correlate clinical course surgical findings of
cholesteatomas histological features.
material/methods: study included 45 patients cholesteatoma, 29 whom
had surgically aggressive 16 simple (not surgically aggressive)
cholesteatoma. patients underwent mastoid surgery cholesteatoma
specimens sent histological examination.
results: clinical course cholesteatomas statistically
significant association (p < 0.001) 'aggressiveness' found surgery,
suggesting clinical history correlates well surgical findings. 29
specimens patients surgically aggressive cholesteatoma characteristic
papillary hyperplasia epithelium marked koilocytosis, suggesting
papillomavirus-incduced lesions. contrast, none specimens 16
patients simple (non-aggressive) cholesteatoma papillary hyperplasia and
there marked koilocytosis, koilocytes could occasionally found. 
the difference statistically significant (p < 0.001). situ hybridization
for human papillomnavirus (hpv) performed 14 specimens (7 with
aggressive simple cholesteatomna). positive staining found three
aggressive cholesteatomas. seven simple cholesteatomas negative hpv.
conclusions: results present paper suggest papillomaviruses may
play important role pathogenesis cholesteatomas. studies
with controls development new methods identify known unknown
types papillomavirus needed explore exact role.
