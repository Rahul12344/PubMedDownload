aim: detect tlr9 expression effect secretion mcp-1 tnf-α
after mouse microglia (bv2) infected hepatitis c virus (hcv), to
explore mechanism hcv-induced central nervous system (cns) infection.
methods: bv2 cells cultured vitro divided hcv-positive serum
group, normal serum group (negative control) blank control group, with
each group 20 samples. cells supernatants collected 12 h, 
detected tlr9 expression flow cytometry (fcm), determined the
levels tnf-α mcp-1 elisa. data statistically analyzed by
spss11.0.
results: (1) fcm showed tlr9 expression three groups, strongest
expression hcv-positive serum group (p<0.01), no
statistical significance normal serum group blank control
group (p>0.05). (2) levels tnf-α mcp-1 hcv-positive serum group
were higher groups (p<0.01), correlated with
enhanced tlr9 expression hcv-positive serum group.
conclusion: hcv-positive serum causes enhanced tlr9 expression secretion 
of mcp-1 tnf-α. bv2 cells, suggesting involvement tlr9 early
inherent immune response triggered hcv-induced cns infection.
