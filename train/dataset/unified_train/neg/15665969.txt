probes encapsulated biologically localised embedding (pebbles) optical
sensors nanometer dimensions fabricated microemulsion polymerisation. the
most beneficial characteristic sensors protection offered 
sensor matrix decreases interaction fluorophore cell.
these sensors introduced cell number methods; however
this paper discusses development generic method facilitate inclusion 
of type sensor cell simple incubation step. achieved
by covalent linkage synthetic cell penetrating peptide (cpp) based the
human immuno-deficiency virus (hiv) -1 tat, external sensor matrix.
calcium sensors used demonstrate approach incorporate sensors
within cell. characterisation revealed calcium sensors approximately
30 +/- 7 nm diameter slightly negative zeta potential. sensors
demonstrated linear range 0-50 microm negligible interference a
range cellular ions protein. leaching entrapped dyes calcium
sensors determined 3% 24 h period, photobleaching the
entrapped dye minimal 40 min period. sensors ability cross 
cell membrane using covalently attached synthetic tat peptide is
demonstrated. cellular inclusion sensors occurred within 30 min
incubation period.
