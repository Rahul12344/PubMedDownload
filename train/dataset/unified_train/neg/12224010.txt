a number genetic disorders manifested cutaneous epithelium gene
therapy approaches treatment diseases considered. a
successful gene therapy protocol requires durable correctly targeted gene
expression within tissue. continuous renewal high levels of
compartmentalization epidermis two challenges successful gene
therapy skin disorders. disorders affect upper layers of
epidermis, vectors must available target stem cells, remain silent
until progeny cells undergo differentiation. explore the
potential long-term targeted vector expression epidermis, hybrid
retroviral vector encoding reporter enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp)
was constructed. viral enhancer long terminal repeat vector was
replaced 510-bp enhancer element human involucrin promoter.
keratinocyte-specific expression directed hybrid vector demonstrated
in culture suprabasal-specific expression observed organotypic human
epidermal cultures. vivo transduction mouse skin hybrid vector
indicated long-term stratum-specific expression transgene mouse
epidermis. design similar vectors various gene therapy applications
constitutes important step toward clinically effective gene therapy.
