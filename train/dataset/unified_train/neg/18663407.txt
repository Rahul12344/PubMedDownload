to analyze role 2b protein (2bp) peanut stunt virus (psv) the
viral infection cycle, constructed psv mutants express either 2bp or
n-terminal-truncated 2bp. accumulation wild-type mutant viruses in
tobacco protoplasts indicated 2b cistron essential viral
replication. viral accumulation nicotiana benthamiana plants suggested that
the 2b cistron responsible viral accumulation inoculated upper
leaves role virulence. involvement eight n-terminal amino
acids 2bp functions discussed.
