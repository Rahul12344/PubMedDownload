white leghorn line c chicks surgically bursectomised (bx) ovo to
eliminate antibody production. inoculation infectious bronchitis virus
(ibv) 14 days hatching, bx chicks experienced severe longer
lasting infection intact chicks. severity duration clinical
infection bx chicks resembled previously observed highly
susceptible line 15i chicks, however increase mortality observed, in
contrast high levels mortality recorded ibv-inoculated line 15i
chicks. secondary challenge degree damage ciliated epithelium
of trachea greater bx chicks intact chicks. the
results indicate that, although antibodies play important role recovery
from ibv infection, immunological factor(s) may also involved.
