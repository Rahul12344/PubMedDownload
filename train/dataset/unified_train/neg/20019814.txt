host cell factors either positively negatively regulate assembly and
egress hiv-1 particles infected cells. recent reports identified a
previously uncharacterized transmembrane protein, tetherin/cd317/bst-2, a
crucial host restriction factor acts late budding step hiv-1
replication inhibiting viral particle release. although tetherin been
shown promote retention nascent viral particles host cell
surface, precise molecular mechanisms occur these
tethering events remain largely unknown. report ring-type e3
ubiquitin ligase, bca2 (breast cancer-associated gene 2; also called rabring7,
znf364 rnf115), novel tetherin-interacting host protein facilitates 
the restriction hiv-1 particle production tetherin-positive cells. the
expression human bca2 "tetherin-positive" hela, in
"tetherin-negative" hos cells, resulted strong restriction hiv-1 particle
production. upon expression tetherin hos cells, bca2 capable of
inhibiting viral particle production hela cells. targeted depletion 
endogenous bca2 rna interference (rnai) hela cells reduced the
intracellular accumulation viral particles, nevertheless retained
on plasma membrane. bca2 also found facilitate internalization 
hiv-1 virions cd63(+) intracellular vesicles leading lysosomal
degradation. results indicate bca2 accelerates internalization and
degradation viral particles following tethering cell surface 
is co-factor enhancer tetherin-dependent restriction hiv-1
release infected cells.
