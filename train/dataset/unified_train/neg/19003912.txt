hepatitis c virus (hcv) replicates primarily liver, hcv rna been
observed association tissues cells including b t
lymphocytes, monocytes, dendritic cells. taken advantage a
recently described, robust system fully recapitulates hcv entry, replication
and virus production vitro re-examine issue hcv infection blood
cell subsets. hcv replicase inhibitor 2'c-methyl adenosine used to
distinguish hcv rna replication rna persistence. whereas cell culture-grown 
hcv replicated huh-7.5 hepatoma cells, hcv replication detected b or
t lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells healthy donors. no
blood cell subset tested expressed significant levels claudin-1, tight
junction protein needed hcv infection huh-7.5 cells. b cell line
expressing high levels claudin-1, cd81, scavenger receptor bi remained
resistant hcv pseudoparticle infection. bypassed block hcv entry 
transfecting hcv rna blood cell subsets. transfected rna detectably 
translated induced high levels interferon-alpha. supernatants hcv
rna-transfected macrophages inhibited hcv replication huh-7.5
cells.conclusion: conclude multiple blocks prevent blood cells from
supporting hcv infection.
