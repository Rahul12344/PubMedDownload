high levels decoy receptor 2 (dcr2; trail-r4) expression correlated with
trail resistance prostate cancer cells. addition, upregulation trail
death receptor (dr4 dr5) expression, either ionizing radiation or
chemotherapy, sensitize cancer cells trail. considering half 
human cancers trail resistant, modulation surface trail receptor
expression appears attractive treatment modality counteract trail
resistance. study, three sirna duplexes targeting dcr2 receptor were
tested. ad5htrail infections performed overexpress human full-length
trail induce cell death, vitro tumorigenic potential prostate
cancer cells assessed using colony-forming assays soft agar. du145 and
lncap prostate cancer cell lines, express high levels dcr2, were
resistant ad5htrail-induced death. downregulation surface dcr2 expression
by sirna sensitized prostate cancer cell lines ad5htrail. addition,
dcr2 sirna-mediated knockdown dcr2, followed ad5htrail infection,
dramatically reduced vitro tumorigenic potential prostate cancer cells.
collectively, results suggest potential combining receptor-specific
sirna trail treatment certain cancers.
