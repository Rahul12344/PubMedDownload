in sindbis virus-infected avian cells development cytopathic effect is
correlated disruption plasma membrane function. sindbis virus
inhibits activity na+k+atpase, membrane-associated enzyme complex
which regulates intracellular monovalent cation levels. tunicamycin, blocks
envelope protein glycosylation, prevents inhibition na+k+atpase activity and
the development morphological changes sindbis virus-infected cells.
although inhibition na+k+atpase activity essential termination 
of host protein synthesis, membrane-mediated events may favor selective
translation viral proteins. termination host protein synthesis not
contribute development cytopathic changes time frame
examined. tunicamycin-treated, sindbis virus-infected cells, unglycosylated e1
is inserted plasma membrane virus release prevented. in
productively infected cells, therefore, inhibition na+k+atpase activity
and development cytopathic effect may result terminal events in
virus assembly and/or virus release.
