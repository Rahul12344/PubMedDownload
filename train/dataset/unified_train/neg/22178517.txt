the dengue virus non-structural 1 (ns1) protein contributes evasion host
immune defenses represents target immune responses. evidences generated
in experimental models, well immune responses elicited infected
individuals, showed induction anti-ns1 immunity correlates with
protective immunity may also result generation cross-reactive
antibodies recognize platelets proteins involved coagulation
cascade. present work, evaluated immune responses, protection to
type 2 dengue virus (denv2) challenges safety parameters balb/c mice
vaccinated recombinant ns1 protein combination three different
adjuvants: aluminum hydroxide (alum), freund's adjuvant (fa) genetically
detoxified derivative heat-labile toxin (lt(g33d)), originally produced by
some enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) strains. mice subcutaneously
(s.c.) immunized different vaccine formulations induced ns1-specific
responses, including serum antibodies cell responses, measured. mice
were also subjected lethal challenges denv2 ngc strain. results
showed maximal protective immunity (50%) achieved mice vaccinated
with ns1 combination lt(g33d). analyses ns1-specific immune
responses showed anti-virus protection correlated mainly serum 
anti-ns1 antibody responses including higher avidity target antigen. mice 
immunized lt(g33d) elicited prevailing igg2a subclass response and
generated antibodies stronger affinity antigen generated
in mice immunized vaccine formulations. vaccine formulations
were also evaluated regarding induction deleterious side effects and, in
contrast mice immunized fa-adjuvanted vaccine, significant hepatic
damage enhanced c-reactive protein levels detected mice immunized with
ns1 lt(g33d.) similarly, detectable alterations bleeding time and
hematological parameters detected mice vaccinated ns1 lt(g33d). 
altogether, results indicate combination purified recombinant
ns1 nontoxic lt derivative promising alternative generation of
safe effective protein-based anti-dengue vaccine.
