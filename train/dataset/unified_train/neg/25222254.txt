the diversity microbiota waste waters thoroughly examined,
despite potential impact microbes effluent quality. wastewater
microbial communities harbor pathogenic bacteria, viruses, parasites. to
study microbial communities domestic sewage outfalls, 454 pyrosequencing
technology used investigate composition microbial communities
associated municipal wastewater different seasons sampled the
course one year. total 195,103 16s rrna gene sequences obtained from
20 samples. r software used calculate number indices describing
the alpha diversity associated bacterial assemblage. study, the
a-diversity index (h', d, j), higher numbers represent diversity,
was found change seasonal cycle. diversity bacterial assemblages
was high samples, indicating species diversity also high.
the taxonomic composition assemblages varied considerably among samples,
with dominated proteobacteria, others dominated by
bacteroidetes firmicutes. 2 samples, relative prevalence of
proteobacteria exceeded 90%. Î±-proteobacteria, b-proteobacteria, and
g-proteobacteria represented 90% proteobacteria. present
characterization wastewater five sewage outfalls indicated presence
of pathogenic bacteria. g-proteobacteria sewage wastefalls identified
in study included enterobacteriaceae, vibrionaceae, pseudomonadaceae,
salmonella, yersinia, vibrio, pseudomonas aeruginosa.
