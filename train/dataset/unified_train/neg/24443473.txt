the recently emerged middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), a
betacoronavirus, associated severe pneumonia renal failure. the
environmental origin mers-cov yet unknown; however, genome sequence 
is closely related two bat coronaviruses, named btcov-hku4 and
btcov-hku5, derived chinese bat samples. hallmark highly
pathogenic respiratory viruses ability evade innate immune
response host. cov accessory proteins, example severe acute
respiratory syndrome cov (sars-cov), shown block innate antiviral
signalling pathways. mers-cov, similar sars-cov, shown inhibit
type ifn induction variety cell types vitro. therefore
hypothesized mers-cov phylogenetically related btcov-hku4 and
btcov-hku5 may encode proteins similar capabilities. study, 
demonstrated orf4b-encoded accessory protein (p4b) mers-cov,
btcov-hku4 btcov-hku5 may indeed facilitate innate immune evasion by
inhibiting type ifn nf-Îºb signalling pathways. also analysed the
subcellular localization p4b mers-cov, btcov-hku4 btcov-hku5 and
demonstrated localized nucleus.
