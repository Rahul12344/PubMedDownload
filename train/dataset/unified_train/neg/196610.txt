sulphated acid mucopolysaccharides sv40-transformed human cells normal
and mucopolysaccharidosis patients.

webb t.

lines fibroblasts established normal individuals from
patients diagnosed suffering one mucopolysaccharidoses or
mucopolysaccharide-storage diseases. transformation lines sv40
virus found reduce capacity secrete sulphated
mucopolysaccharides growth medium. differences detected 
the individual cell types secretory capacity, either after
viral transformation. direct relationship found exist rate
of acid mucopolysaccharide production cell-doubling time. level of
sulphated mucopolysaccharide detected within cell also reduced all
cell types transformation sv40. transformed fibroblasts from
mucopolysaccharidosis patients, however, showed relatively greater reduction in
storage capacity derived normal individuals.
