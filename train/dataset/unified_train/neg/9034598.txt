many viral non-viral vector systems developed gene therapy 
applications. article, pros cons vector systems are
discussed relation different cancer gene therapy strategies. the
protocols used cancer gene therapy broadly divided six categories 
including gene transfer explanted cells use cell-based cancer vaccines;
gene transfer small number tumour cells situ achieve vaccine
effect; gene transfer vascular endothelial cells (vecs) lining blood
vessels tumour interfere tumour angiogenesis; gene transfer t
lymphocytes enhance antitumour effector capability; gene transfer to
haemopoietic stem cells (hscs) enhance resistance cytotoxic drugs and
gene transfer large number tumour cells situ achieve nonimmune
tumour reduction without bystander effect. six strategies
makes unique demands vector system discussed reference 
to currently available vectors. aspects vector biology need of
further development discussed detail. final section points the
potential use replicating viruses delivery vehicles efficient vivo
gene transfer disseminated cancers.
