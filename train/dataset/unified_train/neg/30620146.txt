cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (cftr) dysfunction associated with
epithelial cell vulnerability dysregulation local inflammatory
responses resulting excessive airway neutrophilic inflammation pathogen
growth. combination impaired mucociliary clearance, dysregulation 
defense function, bacterial infection follows eventual airway damage and
remodeling. inherent vulnerabilities, viral infections also 
more severe prolonged appear render airway even prone to
bacterial infection. airway acidity, deficient nitric oxide production and
increased iron concentrations, enhance airway milieu's susceptibility
to infection. novel diagnostic techniques airway microbiome elucidate 
coexistence array non-virulent taxa beyond recognized virulent
organisms, predominantly pseudomonas aeruginosa. complex interplay between
these two bacterial populations, including upregulation virulence genes and
utilization mucin nutrient source, modulates action pathogens,
modifies cf airway milieu contributes processes leading airway 
derangement. review provides update recent advances complex
mechanisms render cf airway vulnerable inflammation, infection and
ultimately structural damage, key pathogenetic elements cf. recent
contributions cf pathogenesis hopefully help identifying new
prophylactic measures therapeutic targets highly destructive
