minor group human rhinoviruses (exemplified human rhinovirus serotype 2
(hrv2)) use members low density lipoprotein receptor family cell
entry; receptors possess clathrin-coated pit localization signals.
viral infection thus inhibited conditions impaired
clathrin-mediated endocytosis. however, madshus et al. reported increase in
the cytopathic effect hrv2 infection hep-2 cells upon suppression of
clathrin-dependent endocytosis hypotonic shock potassium depletion
(madshus, i. h., sandvig, k., olsnes, s., van deurs, b. (1987) j. cell.
physiol. 131, 14-22.) resolve apparent contradiction, investigated the
binding, internalization, conformational changes, productive uncoating of
hrv2 hela cells subjected hypotonic shock potassium depletion. this
treatment led increase hrv2 binding, internalization barely
affected. generation c-antigenic particles requiring ph </=5.6 was
strongly reduced due elevation ph endosomal compartments.
however, k(+) depletion slightly affected de novo viral protein synthesis,
suggesting productivity viral rna cytoplasm enhanced thus
compensates reduction c-antigenic particles. distinct steps the
entry pathway hrv2 thus differently influenced potassium depletion.
viral internalization conditions inhibited clathrin-dependent
endocytosis without need disturb ionic milieu confirmed hela
cells overexpressing nonfunctional dynamin-1 mutant k44a. unexpectedly,
overexpression dynamin-1 k44a resulted elevated endosomal ph compared 
overexpression wild-type dynamin.
