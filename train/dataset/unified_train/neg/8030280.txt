the pr76gag pr180gag-pol polyprotein precursors rous sarcoma virus contain
a 22-amino-acid spacer peptide, called p2, located amino acid
sequences mature gag proteins p10. spacer peptide present
in stoichiometric amounts virion, albeit cleaved two parts, its
function unknown. primary sequence peptide includes region 
is highly conserved among retroviruses, consisting four prolines followed by
tyrosine. investigated role p2, particularly polyproline
motif, virus life cycle site-directed mutagenesis. mutations this
region result intracellular accumulation truncated gag precursor, due
either block intracellular processing precursor the
premature activation viral protease. since cells infected rous
sarcoma virus significant intracellular processing gag
polyprotein precursor, data suggest p2 domain plays role in
controlling activation protease. mutations also result a
reduction virus particle release, probably direct consequence the
aberrant precursor processing since construct p2 protease 
active site mutated exhibit aberrant processing gag
polyproteins formed particles efficiency similar wild 
type. indicates viral protease responsible the
aberrant processing suggests p2 region required assembly.
although virus genomic rna packaged virions produced p2 mutants
is susceptible degradation, appears p2 domain a
direct role rna packaging protection.
