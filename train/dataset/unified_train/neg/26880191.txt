background: rodents natural reservoirs hantaviruses, cause two
disease types: hemorrhagic fever renal syndrome eurasia hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome north america. hantaviruses related human cases been
observed throughout asia, europe, africa, north america. date, 23 distinct
species hantaviruses, hosted reservoir, identified. however, 
diversity number hantaviruses likely underestimated china, and
hantavirus species cause disease many regions, including yunnan province,
are unknown.
results: august 2012, collected tissue samples 189 captured animals,
including 15 species belonging 10 genera, 5 families, 4 orders fugong
county, yunnan province, china. seven species positive hantavirus:
eothenomys eleusis (42/94), apodemus peninsulae (3/25), niviventer eha (3/27),
cryptotis montivaga (2/8), anourosorex squamipes (1/1), sorex araneus (1/1), 
mustela sibirica (1/2). characterized one full-length genomic sequence 
virus (named fugong virus, fugv) small oriental vole (eothenomys eleusis).
the full-length sequences small, medium, large segments fugv were
1813, 3630, 6531 nt, respectively. fugv closely related to
hantavirus lx309, previously reported species detected red-backed vole
in luxi county, yunnan province, china. however, amino acid sequences of
nucleocapsid (n), glycoprotein (g), large protein (l) highly divergent
from hantavirus lx309, amino acid differences 11.2, 15.3, and
12.7 %, respectively. phylogenetic trees, fugv clustered lineage
corresponding hantaviruses carried rodents subfamily arvicolinae.
conclusions: high prevalence hantavirus infection small mammals found
in fugong county, yunnan province, china. novel hantavirus species fugv was
identified small oriental vole. virus phylogenetic clustering
with another hantavirus lx309, shows highly genomic divergence.
