regulation early gene expression bacteriophage phi 80: transcriptional
regulation phi 80 gene 30.

morita t, matsushiro a.

the gene30sus620 mutation bacteriophage phi 80 mapped close left of
the ci gene standard genetic map. distance mutation
(gene30sus620) ci gene 0.01%, judged recombination
frequencies. transcriptional pattern mutant showed two distinct
differences wild type; late mrnas synthesized, and
early genes preferentially transcribed rightward contrast the
predominantly leftward transcription wild type. synthesis early
proteins also affected. wild-type phi 80 permits synthesis five major
proteins (pe, pb, pa, pc, pd) two minor proteins (pu pv) upon
infection ultraviolet-irradiated cells. synthesis major proteins was
significantly reduced mutant, synthesis two minor proteins
was enhanced several-fold mutant. results indicate gene 30
product regulates transcription two operons early region phi
80, i.e., operon 1, transcribed left codes five major
proteins, operon 2, seems transcribed right codes 
the two minor proteins.
