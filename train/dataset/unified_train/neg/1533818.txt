the neurospora cyt-18 protein, tyrosyl-trna synthetase, functions in
splicing group introns mitochondria, promotes splicing mutants the
distantly related bacteriophage t4 td intron. vivo assay, wild-type
cyt-18 protein expressed e. coli suppressed mutations td intron's
catalytic core. cyt-18-suppressible mutations also suppressed high mg2+
or spermidine vitro, suggesting affect intron structure. n- 
c-terminal domains cyt-18 required efficient splicing, cyt-18 with
a large c-terminal truncation retains activity. results indicate that
cyt-18 interacts conserved structural features group introns, 
provide direct evidence protein promotes splicing stabilizing the
catalytically active structure intron rna.
