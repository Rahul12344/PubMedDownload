to identify genes expressed ms pathogenesis, analyzed a
normalized cdna library made mrna obtained cns lesions patient
with primary progressive ms. complementary dna clones obtained library 
were subjected automated dna sequencing generate expressed sequence tags.
analysis ms cdna library revealed presence 54 cdnas were
associated immune activation indicated presence ongoing
inflammatory response evidence cell-mediated humoral immune
responses. surprising finding 16 cdnas encoded autoantigens
associated seven autoimmune disorders, three 16
autoantigen cdnas present similarly constructed adult brain library.
such aberrant autoantigen expression could provide source secondary
autoimmune stimulation could contribute ongoing inflammatory response
in ms. addition, two cdnas found mapped known ms susceptibility
locus (5p14-p12): one encoded excitatory amino acid transporter 
a human homologue drosophila disabled gene. approach molecular
biology ms pathogenesis may help illuminate previously unappreciated
aspects disease.
