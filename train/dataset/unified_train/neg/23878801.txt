many biomedical applications absolutely require, substantially enhanced
by, coexpression multiple proteins single vector. foot-and-mouth
disease virus 2a (f2a) "2a-like" sequences (e.g., thosea asigna virus 2a;
t2a) used widely purpose since multiple proteins coexpressed 
by linking open reading frames (orfs) form single cistron. activity of
f2a "cleavage" may, however, compromised use shorter versions
of f2a sequences (derived multiple-purpose cloning sites) used to
link f2a upstream protein. characterise effects, different
lengths f2a t2a inserted green cherry fluorescent
proteins. mutations introduced linker region immediately upstream 
both f2a- t2a-based constructs activities determined using cell-free
translation systems transfected cells. shorter versions f2a, activity
may affected c-terminal sequence protein upstream and,
equally strikingly, residues immediately upstream introduced cloning. 
mutations significantly improved activity shorter versions f2a could
decrease activity case t2a. data aid design cloning
strategies co-expression multiple proteins in
biomedical/biotechnological applications.
