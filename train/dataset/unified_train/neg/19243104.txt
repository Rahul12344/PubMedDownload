the nanoindentation response empty viral capsids modeled using
three-dimensional finite element analysis. simulation two different
geometries, spherical icosahedral, performed using finite element code
abaqus. capsids modeled nonlinear hookean elastic, small 
large deformation analysis performed. young's modulus determined by
calibrating force-indentation curve data atomic force microscopy
(afm) experiments. force-indentation curves three different viral capsids are
directly compared experimental data. predictions made two additional
viral capsids. results simulation showed good agreement afm
data. paper demonstrates entire range virus sizes (or
foppl-von karman numbers) spherical icosahedral models yield different force 
responses. particular, shown capsids dominantly spherical
shape (for low foppl-von karman numbers) exhibit nearly linear relationship
between force indentation, experimentally observed the
viral shell studies far. however, predict capsids significant
faceting (for large foppl-von karman numbers) thus pronounced
icosahedral shape exhibit rather nonlinear deformation behavior.
