recently, substantial developments understanding ebola 
hemorrhagic fever pathogenesis, still major gaps. infections 
occur underdeveloped areas world, much knowledge of
naturally occurring disease derived sporadic outbreaks occurred
decades past. recently conducted laboratory animal studies provided
insight ebola pathogenesis may help guide clinical investigations of
disease using contemporary methodologies available previously. a
better understanding relevant host viral factors influence
clinical virologic outcome critical ability combat this
aggressive pathogen. article reviews relevant information relating 
to postulated pathogenesis disease, focusing role the
endothelium contributing coagulation disorders characterize ebola 
hemorrhagic fever primates. remaining key unanswered questions
relating role vascular system pathogenesis disease, 
that need addressed research, highlighted.
