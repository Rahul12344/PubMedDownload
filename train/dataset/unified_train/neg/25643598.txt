bifunctional magnetic nanobeads (bi-mbs) fabricated co-immobilizing
target recognition molecules signal molecules magnetic nanobead surface,
which used separation enrichment carriers signal carriers.
the bi-mbs could capture separate avian influenza (h7n9) virus (h7n9 aiv)
from complex samples efficiently based specific reaction between
antigen-antibody good magnetic response, simplified sample
pretreatment saved detection time. taking advantages high
surface volume ratio rich surface functional groups, multiple alkaline
phosphatase (alp) signal molecules tethered surface bi-mbs which
greatly amplified detection signal. efficient signal amplification
strategy, enzyme-induced metallization integrated bi-mbs anodic
stripping voltammetry construct ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor
for h7n9 aiv detection. optimal conditions, introduction bi-mbs 
could amplify detection signal four times compared same
immunoassay without mbs, method showed wide linear range 0.01-20
ng/ml detection limit 6.8 pg/ml. electrochemical immunosensor
provides simple reliable platform high sensitivity selectivity
which shows great potential early diagnosis diseases.
