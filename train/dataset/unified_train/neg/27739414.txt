hepatitis c virus (hcv) classified seven phylogenetically distinct
genotypes, subdivided related subtypes. accurate
assignment genotype/subtype mandatory era directly acting
antivirals. several molecular methods available hcv genotyping; however, 
a relevant number samples indeterminate, mixed, unspecified subtype
results, even misclassified genotypes, may occur. using ns5b direct (ds) 
and ultra-deep pyrosequencing (udps), tested 43 samples, resulted
in genotype 1 unsubtyped (n = 17), mixed infection (n = 17), indeterminate (n 
= 9) abbott realtime hcv genotype ii assay. genotype 1 confirmed 
14/17 samples (82%): eight resulted subtype 1b, five resulted subtype
1a ds udps, one classified subtype 1e ds mixed 
infection (1e + 1a) udps. three seventeen genotype 1 samples resulted in
genotype 3h sequencing approaches. one mixed infection was
confirmed udps (4d + 1a), 88% cases single component the
mixture detected (five genotype 1a, four genotype 1b, two genotype 3a, two
genotype 4m, two genotype 4d); 44% indeterminate samples resulted genotype
2c ds udps, 22% resulted genotype 3a; one indeterminate sample by
abbott resulted genotype 4d, one resulted genotype 6n, one was
classified subtype 3a ds, resulted mixed infection (3a + 3h) udps.
the concordance ds udps 94%, 88%, 89% genotype 1,
co-infection, indeterminate results, respectively. udps considered 
very useful resolve ambiguous hcv genotyping results.
