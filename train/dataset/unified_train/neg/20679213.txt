inhibitory receptors play crucial role regulating cd8 t-cell function during
chronic viral infection. t-cell ig- mucin-domain-containing molecule-3
(tim-3) well known negatively regulate t-cell responses, role in
cd8 t-cell exhaustion chronic infection vivo remains unclear. this
study, document coregulation cd8 cell exhaustion tim-3 pd-1 during
chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection. whereas tim-3 only
transiently expressed cd8 cells acute infection, virus-specific cd8 
cells retained high tim-3 expression throughout chronic infection. majority
(approximately 65% 80%) lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-specific cd8 t
cells lymphoid nonlymphoid organs coexpressed tim-3 pd-1. this
coexpression tim-3 pd-1 associated severe cd8 t-cell
exhaustion terms proliferation secretion effector cytokines 
ifn-gamma, tnf-alpha, il-2. interestingly, cd8 cells expressing both
inhibitory receptors also produced suppressive cytokine il-10. most
importantly, combined blockade tim-3 pd-1 pathways vivo synergistically
improved cd8 cell responses viral control chronically infected mice.
taken together, study defines parameter determining severity cd8
t cell dysfunction identifying virus-specific cd8 cells produce
il-10, shows targeting pd-1 tim-3 effective immune
strategy treating chronic viral infections.
