flavivirus ns3 ns5 required viral replication 5'-capping. ns3 
ns2b-dependent protease, rna helicase, 5'-rna triphosphatase activities. ns5 
has 5'-rna methyltransferase (mt)/guanylyltransferase (gt) activities within 
n-terminal 270 amino acids rna-dependent rna polymerase (pol) activity
within amino acids 271-900. chimeric ns5 containing d4mt/d4gt d2pol
domains context wild-type (wt) d2 rna constructed. rnas synthesized
in vitro transfected baby hamster kidney cells. viral replication
was analyzed indirect immunofluorescence assay monitor ns1 expression
and quantitative real-time pcr. wt d2 rna-transfected cells ns1- positive
by day 5, whereas chimeric rna-transfected cells became ns1-positive ∼30 days
post-transfection three independent experiments. sequence analysis covering
the entire genome revealed appearance single k74i mutation within the
d4mt domain ∼16 days post-transfection two experiments. third, d290n
mutation conserved ns3 walker b motif appeared ≥16 days post-transfection.
a time course study serial passages revealed 30-day supernatant had
gradually evolved gain replication fitness. trans-complementation by
co-expression wt d2 ns5 accelerated viral replication chimeric rna without 
changing k74i mutation. however, mt pol activities ns5 wt d2 and
the chimeric ns5 proteins without k74i mutation similar. taken
together, results suggest evolution functional interactions
involving chimeric ns5 protein encoded viral genome species is
essential gain viral replication fitness.
