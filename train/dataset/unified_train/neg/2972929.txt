a lambda gt11 expression library constructed using mrna promastigote
form leishmania donovani (african isolate mhom/et/67/hu3). library was
screened serum obtained patient contracted visceral leishmaniasis
in sudan. several cdna clones expressed beta-galactosidase/l. donovani 
antigen fusion proteins isolated. one clones corresponded 60
kda membrane-associated antigen. western blot assay antibodies the
fusion protein detected universally sera visceral leishmaniasis
patients. detected sera patients cutaneous
leishmaniasis parasitic protozoan infections. gene coding this
antigen specific genus leishmania judged dna hybridisation, 
its chromosomal location conserved. 20 kb mrna detected northern
blots promastigote rna.
