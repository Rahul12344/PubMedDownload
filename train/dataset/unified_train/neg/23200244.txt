7-(2h-tetrazol-5-yl)-1h-indole 3 found potent inhibitor hiv-1
attachment compound lacked oral bioavailability rats. cause the
low exposure believed poor absorption attributed acidic nature
of tetrazole moiety and, effort address liability, three more
lipohilic tetrazole analogs, n-acetoxymethyl 4, n-pivaloyloxymethyl 5, and
n-methyl 6, evaluated potential oral prodrugs rats. prodrug 5 was
ineffective improving plasma concentration 3 vivo compound 4
provided 15-fold enhancement plasma concentration 3. most
interestingly, oral dosing analog 6 afforded substantial increase the
plasma concentration parent rats compared dosing parent.
this represents novel example methyl tetrazole acts prodrug 
a free nh tetrazole-containing compound.
