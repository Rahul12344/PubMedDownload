we previously demonstrated ability foot-and-mouth disease virus
(fmdv) form plaques cell culture associated suppression of
alpha/beta interferon (ifn-alpha/beta). present study, used escherichia
coli-expressed porcine bovine ifn-alpha -beta individually demonstrate 
that equally effective inhibiting fmdv replication. block fmdv
replication appeared level protein translation, suggesting role
for double-stranded rna-dependent protein kinase (pkr). support these
findings, treatment porcine bovine cells 2-aminopurine, inhibitor 
of pkr, increased yield virus 8.8- 11.2-fold, respectively, compared
to untreated infected cells. addition, results fmdv infection in
mouse embryonic fibroblast cells derived gene knockout mice lacking gene
for rnase l(-/-) pkr(-/-) indicated important role pkr the
inhibition fmdv replication.
