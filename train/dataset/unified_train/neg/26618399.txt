eggplant latent viroid (elvd), like members family avsunviroidae,
replicates plastids symmetric rolling-circle mechanism which
elongation rna strands likely catalyzed nuclear-encoded
polymerase (nep) translocated plastids. addressed nep
initiates transcription viroid strands. step presumably
directed sequence/structural motifs, previously determined the
conformation monomeric linear (+) (-) rnas elvd resulting from
hammerhead-mediated self-cleavage. silico predictions 3 softwares led 
similar bifurcated conformations elvd strands. vitro examination by
non-denaturing page showed migrate prominent single bands, 
elvd (+) rna displaying compact conformation revealed faster
electrophoretic mobility. vitro shape analysis corroborated elvd
conformations derived thermodynamics-based predictions silico. moreover, 
sequence analysis 94 full-length natural elvd variants disclosed
co-variations, mutations converting canonical wobble pairs vice
versa, confirmed vivo stems predicted silico in
vitro, additionally helped introduce minor structural refinements.
therefore, results 3 experimental approaches essentially consistent
among themselves. application rna preparations elvd-infected tissue of
rna ligase-mediated rapid amplification cdna ends, combined pretreatments
to modify 5' ends viroid strands, mapped transcription initiation
sites elvd (+) (-) strands vivo different sequence/structural
motifs, contrast situation previously observed 2 members 
the family avsunviroidae.
