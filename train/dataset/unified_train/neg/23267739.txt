background context: diagnosis human t-lymphotropic virus type 1
(htlv-1)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (ham/tsp) based on
clinical signs confirmation htlv-1 infection central nervous
system. electrophysiological tests may facilitate earlier diagnosis spinal 
cord involvement. vestibular evoked myogenic potential (vemp) testing evaluates
the vestibulospinal tract, correlated motor tract; target
of damage ham/tsp.
purpose: study examines subclinical neurological alterations related 
htlv-1 infection individuals asymptomatic htlv-1 infections, possible
ham/tsp, confirmed ham/tsp.
study design: vestibular evoked myogenic potential testing performed the
beginning study repeated every 6 months 18 months. ninety
volunteers selected study: 30 htlv-1 seronegative (the control 
group) 60 htlv-1 seropositive (of these, 18 asymptomatic, 25 had
possible ham/tsp, 17 confirmed ham/tsp). vemp response classified
as normal abnormal (latency prolongation response). change vemp
response normal abnormal event interest. perform survival
analysis, subjects normal vemp responses first assessment were
selected.
methods: results analyzed blindly. vestibular evoked myogenic potential 
was measured using short tone bursts acoustic stimuli (1 khz, 118 dbhl, a
rise-fall 1 millisecond, plateau 2 milliseconds). stimulation
rate 5 hz, analysis time response 60 milliseconds; 
trial averaged 200 responses.
results: mean age subjects control group 38 ± 11 years
(median 35), 13 (43%) men. study group, mean age 51 ± 12 
years (median 53), 12 (20%) men. analysis survival curve
indicated median time change vemp response normal to
abnormal 18 months, agreement slow progression of
htlv-1-associated neurologic disease. survival analysis showed the
change vemp response significantly different asymptomatic 
ham/tsp groups (p=.02).
conclusions: vestibular evoked myogenic potential testing useful for
monitoring development ham/tsp htlv-1-infected individuals.
