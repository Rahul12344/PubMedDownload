vascular damage reported contribute atresia formation several
diseases including biliary atresia. study focused extrahepatic
biliary plexus experimental biliary atresia. newborn balb/canncrl-pups were
infected rhesus rotavirus within 24 hr birth induce experimental
biliary atresia. extrahepatic biliary plexus examined confocal
microscopy whole-mount preparations, scored three independent researchers, 
and evaluated subcellular level transmission electron
microscopy. imaging results revealed progressive destruction the
extrahepatic biliary vascular plexus course experimental biliary
atresia induced rotavirus infection. endothelial cell damage already
visible cell swelling necrosis first days infection a
damaged microcirculation rapidly deteriorated progression of
obliterative cholangiopathy, observed infected mice early 72 hr 
after birth. experimental biliary atresia, destruction extrahepatic
biliary vascular plexus starts already first days postinfection and
clearly precedes morphological symptoms atresia. deterioration 
vascular bed architecture continues disease progression. therefore, we
conclude (ultra)structural changes extrahepatic biliary
microvasculature occurring visible onset atresia predictive
diagnostic value impairment blood supply extrahepatic bile
duct may important contributing factor pathogenesis acquired
