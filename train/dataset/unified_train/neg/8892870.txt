capsids polyomaviruses--small, nonenveloped dna viruses--consist major 
structural protein vp1 minor structural proteins vp2 vp3. the
contributions individual capsid proteins functions viral
particle, dna encapsidation, cell receptor attachment, entry, and
uncoating, still clear. show viruslike particles assembled
in nuclei insect cells vp1 monkey b-lymphotropic papovavirus (lpv)
are sufficient unspecifically encapsidate dna. lpv vp1 expressed large
amounts insect cells baculovirus vector assembled spontaneously the
nuclei form viruslike particles. metrizamide equilibrium density
gradient purification nuclease digestion, fraction particles was
shown contain vp1-associated linear, double-stranded dna predominant
size 4.5 kb. fraction dna-containing vp1 particles increased time 
and dose baculovirus vector infection. dna-containing particles, further
purified sucrose gradient centrifugation, appeared "full" particles in
negative-staining electron microscopy. shown dna hybridization, the
encapsidated dna consisted insect cell baculoviral sequences no
apparent strong homology lpv sequences. three non-lpv vp1-derived host
proteins apparent molecular masses approximately 14, 15, 16 kda
copurified dna-containing particles may represent insect cell
histones encapsidated together dna. similar species host dna was
also found purified lpv wild-type virions. data suggest lpv vp1
alone sufficient encapsidate linear dna sequence-independent
manner.
