cytomegalovirus (cmv) disease infection refractory antiviral treatment
after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-sct) associated high
mortality. adoptive transfer cmv-specific cells could reconstitute viral
immunity sct could protect cmv-related complications. however,
logistics producing virus-specific t-cell grafts limited clinical
application. treated 18 patients allo-sct human leukocyte
antigen-mismatched/haploidentical human leukocyte antigen-matched unrelated
donors polyclonal cmv-specific cells generated ex vivo stimulation with
pp65, followed isolation interferon-γ-producing cells. patients cmv
disease viremia refractory antiviral chemotherapy eligible for
adoptive t-cell transfer received mean 21 × 10³/kg pp65-specific t
cells. 83% cases cmv infection cleared viral burden was
significantly reduced, even cases cmv encephalitis (n = 2). viral control
was associated vivo expansion cmv-specific lymphocytes 12 16
evaluable cases, resulting reconstitution antiviral t-cell responses,
without graft-versus-host disease induction acute side effects. findings
indicate infusion low numbers cmv-specific cells safe,
feasible, effective treatment demand refractory cmv infection and
cmv disease allo-sct.
