the safety, infectivity, immunogenicity, phenotypic stability the
cold-passaged (cp) candidate vaccine cp-45, cold-adapted (ca),
temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant js strain human parainfluenza virus
type 3 (hpiv-3), evaluated 114 children 6 months 10 years old a
randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. cp-45 vaccine well
tolerated given intranasally parainfluenza virus type 3
(piv-3)-seropositive -seronegative children. 10(4) 10(5) tcid50 of
cp-45 vaccine, 86% seronegative vaccines infected, 83% shed virus
at mean peak titer 10(22) pfu/ml. virus present respiratory specimens
retained ts phenotype, 86 piv-3 isolates tested retained the
ca ts phenotypes. one dose 10(5) tcid50 vaccine induced serum
hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody response 81% vaccinees; geometric 
mean titer 1:32. studies indicate cp-45 hpiv-3 vaccine is
satisfactorily attenuated, infectious, immunogenic, phenotypically stable and
merits evaluation infants young children.
