highly pathogenic simian/human immunodeficiency virus chimeric viruses known 
to induce rapid, irreversible depletion cd4+ lymphocytes peripheral
blood acutely infected macaque monkeys. fully assess systemic
effects primary virus infection, specimens collected serially
between days 3 21 postinfection variety lymphoid tissues (lymph
nodes, thymus, spleen) gastrointestinal tract examined dna rna
pcr, situ hybridization, immunohistochemical assays. addition, the
lymphoid tissues evaluated fluorescence-activated cell sorting. virus
infection initially detected dna pcr day 3 postinfection lymph node 
samples peaked day 10 t-lymphocyte-rich areas tissue. cd4+ 
t-cell levels remained stable day 10 several lymphoid tissue specimens
examined fell precipitously days 10 21. situ terminal
deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dutp-biotin nick end labeling (tunel) assays
revealed accumulation apoptotic cells second week infection 
in lymph nodes thymus, colocalized, large extent, sites of
both virus replication cd4+ t-lymphocyte loss.
