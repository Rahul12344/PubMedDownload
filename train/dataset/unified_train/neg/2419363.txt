suggested importance directly measuring camp content ve-infected and
control islets response insulin secretagogues. basal camp content of
ve-infected islets (0.14 +/- 0.02 pmol/micrograms islet dna) approximately
half control islets (0.27 +/- 0.02 pmol/micrograms islet dna) (p less
than 0.05). presence 10 microm glucagon (and 3 mm glucose), rate of
camp generation ve-infected islets half control islets. 
10 mm alpha-ketoisocaproic acid, rates camp generation were
indistinguishable control experimental groups. response 20 mm
glucose 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (ibmx) (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor),
camp generation ve-infected islets 81% (ns) control rate. a
more specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, ro 20-1724, used 20 mm
glucose, camp generation infected islets 44% (p less 0.001) 
of control value. insulin secretion perifusion period paralleled the
camp levels. presence 10 mm alpha-ketoisocaproic acid, no
difference insulin secretion ve-infected control islets, while
there statistically significant (p less 0.05) difference 10
microm glucagon 20 mm glucose (in 1 mm ro 20-1724). data point a
defect camp generation system ve-infected islets, although additional
factors involved insulin secretion may also impaired virus.
