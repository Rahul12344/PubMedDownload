background: pandemic epidemic forms, avian human influenza viruses
often cause significant damage human society economics. gradually
accumulated mutations hemagglutinin (ha) cause immunologically distinct
circulating strains, lead antigenic drift (named antigenic
variants). "antigenic variants" often requires new vaccine formulated
before annual epidemic. mapping genetic evolution antigenic drift
of influenza viruses emergent issue public health vaccine
development
results: developed method identifying antigenic critical amino acid
positions, rules, co-mutated positions antigenic variants. the
information gain (ig) entropy used measure score amino
acid position hemagglutinin (ha) discriminating antigenic variants
and similar viruses. position high ig entropy implied this
position highly correlated antigenic drift. nineteen positions high
ig high genetic diversity identified antigenic critical positions on
the ha proteins. antigenic critical positions located five
epitopes surface based ha structure. based ig values and
entropies 19 positions ha, decision tree applied to
create rule-based model identify rules predicting antigenic variants
of given two ha sequences often vaccine strain circulating
strain. predicting accuracies model two sets, consist a
training set (181 hemagglutination inhibition (hi) assays) independent
test set (31,878 hi assays), 91.2% 96.2% respectively.
conclusion: method able identify critical positions, rules, and
co-mutated positions ha predicting antigenic variants. information
gains entropies ha positions provide insight antigenic drift
and co-evolution positions influenza seasons. believe method is
robust potential useful studying influenza virus evolution vaccine
development.
