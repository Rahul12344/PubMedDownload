human papillomaviruses (hpv) small oncogenic dna viruses than
200 types identified date. small subset etiologically 
linked development anogenital malignancies cervical cancer. 
addition, recent studies established causative relationship these
high-risk hpv types tonsillar oropharyngeal cancer. clinical management
of cervical cancer head neck squamous cell carcinomas (hnsccs) largely
standardized involves surgical removal tumor tissue well as
adjuvant chemoradiation therapy. notably, response therapeutic
intervention hpv-positive hnsccs found better compared to
hpv-negative tumors. although existing hpv vaccine solely licensed the
prevention cervical cancer, might also prophylactic potential 
development high-risk hpv-associated hnsccs. another group viruses, which
belongs beta-hpv subgroup, implicated nonmelanoma skin cancer,
however, etiology remains established. treatment hpv-induced
nonmelanoma skin cancer based local excision. however, topically applied
immune-modulating substances represent non-surgical alternatives the
management smaller cutaneous tumors. review present current
knowledge role hpv cancer development discuss clinical
management options well targets development future intervention 
therapies.
