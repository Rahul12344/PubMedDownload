flavivirus envelope protein (e) mediates membrane fusion viral entry from
endosomes. low-ph induced, dimer-to-trimer rearrangement reconfiguration of
the membrane-proximal "stem" e ectodomain draw together viral and
cellular membranes. found stem-derived peptides dengue virus (dv) bind
stem-less e trimer mimic stem-reconfiguration step fusion pathway.
we adapted experiment high-throughput screen small molecules that
block peptide binding thus may inhibit viral entry. compound identified 
this screen, 1662g07, number analogs reversibly inhibit dv
infectivity. binding prefusion, dimeric e virion
surface, adsorption cell. also block viral fusion with
liposomes. structure-activity relationship studies led analogs with
submicromolar ic₉₀s dv2, certain analogs active dv
serotypes 1,2, 4. compounds inhibit closely related kunjin
virus. propose bind previously identified, e-protein pocket,
exposed virion surface although pocket closed the
postfusion trimer, mouth fully accessible. examination e-trimer
coordinates (pdb 1ok8) shows conformational fluctuations around hinge
could open pocket without dissociating trimer otherwise generating
molecular collisions. propose compounds 1662g07 trap se
trimer "pocket-open" state, lost affinity stem peptide and
cannot support final "zipping up" stem.
