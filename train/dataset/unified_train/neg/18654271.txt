interaction spherical particles cells within animals studied
extensively, effects shape received little attention. use
highly stable, polymer micelle assemblies known filomicelles compare the
transport trafficking flexible filaments spheres similar
chemistry. rodents, filomicelles persisted circulation one week
after intravenous injection. ten times longer spherical 
counterparts persistent known synthetic nanoparticle. 
fluid flow conditions, spheres short filomicelles taken cells 
readily longer filaments latter extended flow.
preliminary results demonstrate filomicelles effectively deliver
the anticancer drug paclitaxel shrink human-derived tumours mice. although
these findings show long-circulating vehicles need nanospheres, 
also lend insight possible shape effects natural filamentous viruses.
