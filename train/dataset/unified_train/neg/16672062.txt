background: dose-response parameters based clinical challenges frequently 
used assess health impact protozoa drinking water. compare the
risk estimates associated giardia drinking water derived the
dose-response parameter published literature incidence acute
digestive conditions (adc) measured framework epidemiological study 
in general population.
methods: study combined daily follow-up digestive morbidity among a
panel 544 volunteers microbiological surveillance tap water. the
relationship incidence adc concentrations giardia cysts was
modeled generalized estimating equations, adjusting community, age, tap
water intake, presence bacterial indicators, genetic markers viruses.
the quantitative estimate giardia dose product declared amount 
of drinking water intake (in l) logarithm cysts concentrations.
results: odds ratio one unit dose [or = 1.76 (95% ci: 1.21, 2.55)]
showed good consistency risk assessment estimate computed after
the literature dose-response, provided application 20 % abatement factor 
the cysts counts measured epidemiological study. so, a
daily water intake 2 l giardia concentration 10 cysts/100 l, would
yield estimated relative excess risk 12 % according rendtorff model,
against 11 % multiplying baseline rate adc corresponding or.
this abatement parameter encompasses uncertainties associated germ
viability, infectivity virulence natural settings.
conclusion: dose-response function waterborne giardia risk derived from
clinical experiments consistent epidemiological data. however, much
remains learned key characteristics may heavily influence
quantitative risk assessment results.
