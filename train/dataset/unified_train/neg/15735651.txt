chronic progression two cell-mediated central nervous system (cns)
demyelinating models multiple sclerosis, relapsing eae (r-eae) theiler's
murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease (tmev-idd) is
dependent activation cells endogenous myelin epitopes (epitope
spreading). using transfer carboxyfluorescein succinyl ester (cfse)-labeled
t-cell receptor (tcr)-transgenic cells mixed bone marrow chimeras, show 
that activation naive proteolipid protein (plp)139-151-specific cells sjl
mice undergoing plp178-191-induced r-eae tmev-idd occurs directly cns
and cervical lymph nodes peripheral lymphoid organs.
examination antigen-presentation capacity antigen-presenting cell (apc)
populations purified cns mice plp178-191-induced r-eae shows
that f4/80-cd11c+cd45hi dendritic cells (dcs) efficiently present endogenous
antigen activate naive plp139-151-specific cells vitro. contrast, dcs 
as well f4/80+cd45hi macrophages f4/80+cd45lo microglia activate a
plp139-151-specific helper cell line. data suggest naive cells enter
the inflamed cns activated local apcs, possibly dcs, initiate
epitope spreading.
