dengue virus (denv) important mosquito-borne viral infection in
humans. recent years, number cases outbreaks dramatically
increased worldwide. vaccines developed, none currently
available provide balanced protection denv serotypes. advances
in human antibody isolation uncovered denv neutralizing antibodies (nabs)
that capable preventing infection multiple serotypes. yet delivering 
monoclonal antibodies using conventional methods impractical due high
costs. engineering novel methods delivering monoclonal antibodies could tip
the scale fight denv. demonstrate simple
intramuscular delivery electroporation synthetic dna plasmids engineered to
express modified human nabs multiple denv serotypes confers protection
against denv disease prevents antibody-dependent enhancement (ade) disease
in mice. synthetic nucleic acid antibody prophylaxis/immunotherapy approach 
may important applications fight infectious disease.
