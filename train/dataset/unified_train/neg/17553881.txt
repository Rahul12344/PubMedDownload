the mechanisms human papillomavirus (hpv) neutralization antibodies are
incompletely understood. used hpv16 pseudovirus infection hacat cells 
to analyze several neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mabs) generated
against hpv16 l1 interfere process keratinocyte infection. hpv16
capsids normally bind cell surface extracellular matrix (ecm) 
hacat cells. surprisingly, two strongly neutralizing mabs, v5 e70, not
prevent attachment capsids cell surface. however, block
association ecm prevented internalization cell surface-bound
capsids. contrast, mab u4 prevented binding cell surface the
ecm. epitope recognized u4 inaccessible virions bound the
cell surface became accessible endocytosis, presumably coinciding 
receptor detachment. treatment capsids heparin, known to
interfere binding cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (hspgs),
also resulted hpv16 localization ecm. results suggest u4
epitope intercapsomeric c-terminal arm likely encompass critical
hspg interaction residues hpv16, v5 e70 epitopes apex of
the capsomer overlap ecm-binding sites. conclude neutralizing
antibodies inhibit hpv infection multiple distinct mechanisms, and
understanding mechanisms add insight hpv entry processes.
