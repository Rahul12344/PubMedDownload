background: outcomes involving newer direct-acting antiviral (daa) hepatitis c
virus (hcv) regimens studied extensively among medicaid
population.
objective: assess clinical (treatment failure) economic outcomes for
chronic hcv-infected oklahoma medicaid members following treatment daas 
to measure associations patient, treatment, clinical characteristics.
methods: cross-sectional study used oklahoma medicaid pharmacy medical
claims data adult members used newer daa agent reported a
successful failed sustained virological response rate 12 weeks therapy
completion (svr12) january 1, 2014, june 30, 2016. multivariable logistic
and gamma regressions assessed predictors svr12 failure costs controlling 
for member demographics (i.e., age, sex, race, rural residence); type daa 
adherence; clinical characteristics (e.g., comorbid conditions, advanced liver
disease); implementation changes prior authorization program.
results: 934 medicaid members eligible treatment daas january
1, 2014, june 30, 2016, 906 received daa treatment, 40.6% (368/906) had
reported svr12 outcomes, 59.4% (n = 538) reported svr
recorded. reported svr12 outcomes, patients 53.1 ± 9.7 years
of age, 51.1% male, 8.4% svr12 failure, member mean costs
of $140,283 ± $52,779. multivariable analyses indicated higher odds svr12
failure independently associated cirrhosis (or [decompensated] = 6.69
and [compensated] = 3.52, p < 0.001), males higher odds failure
than females (or = 3.34, p < 0.010). significant difference svr12 failure
was noted, according daa type medication adherence threshold > 95%.
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir independently associated lower costs (exp[b] =
0.81; p < 0.001) compared sofosbuvir, higher costs associated
with decompensated cirrhosis (exp[b] = 1.22; p < 0.001) treatment failure
(exp[b] = 1.18, p < 0.010). analysis including members without reported
svr12 outcomes, decompensated compensated cirrhosis lower odds (p <
0.001) reported svr12 ambulatory clinic settings.
conclusions: almost 60% medicaid members receiving daa treatment 
a final reported svr12 outcome. among viral load measurements,
treatment success high decompensated compensated cirrhosis 
independently associated significantly higher odds treatment failure.
addressing loss follow-up among hcv patients curtailing development 
of cirrhosis improve treatment success may warrant interventions improve 
access care remove barriers impede treatment initiation and
completion.
