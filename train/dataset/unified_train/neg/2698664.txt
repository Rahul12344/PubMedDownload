oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis used along dut ung genetic 
selection method kunkel introduce large site-specific deletions cdnas 
cloned phagemid vectors. find large deletions achieved with
an efficiency equal single point mutations, low frequency 
of aberrent clones. facilitate screening clones, e. coli strain dh5 alpha
was used recipient host cell genetically select deletion mutants.
comparisons made deletion mutagenesis without genetic selection, to
reactions utilizing two oligonucleotide primers simultaneously. low frequency
of deletion mutants observed without genetic selection renders random screening
for deletion mutant clones cumbersome. results provide representative
expectations useful guide contemplating construction of
deletion mutants.
