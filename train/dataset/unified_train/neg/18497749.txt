the ring-shaped t7 helicase uses energy dttp hydrolysis perform the
mechanical work translocation base pair (bp) separation. shown
that unwinding rate t7 helicase decreases increasing dna stability.
here, show dttpase rate also decreases increasing dna stability,
which indicates close linkage chemical transition steps translocation
steps unwinding. find force-producing step unwinding not
associated dttp binding, dttp hydrolysis p(i) release. determine
that t7 helicase extracts approximately 3.7 kcal/mol energy dttpase carry
out work strand separation. using energy, t7 helicase unwinds
approximately 4 bp at-rich dna 1-2 bp gc-rich dna. t7 helicase therefore
adjusts speed coupling ratio (bp/dttp) match work dna
unwinding. discuss mechanistic implications variable bp/dttp that
indicates t7 helicase either undergoes backward movements/futile hydrolysis or
unwinds dna variable bp-step size; 'long fast' steps at-rich and
'short slow' steps gc-rich dna.
