programmed cell death (pcd), apoptosis, initiated response various
stimuli, including virus infection. bovine herpesvirus 1 (bhv-1) induces pcd in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells g0/g1 phase cell cycle (e.
hanon, s. hoornaert, f. dequiedt, a. vanderplasschen, j. lyaku, l. willems, and
p.-p. pastoret, virology 232:351-358, 1997). however, penetration virus
particles required pcd (e. hanon, g. meyer, a. vanderplasschen, c.
dessy-doize, e. thiry, p. p. pastoret, j. virol. 72:7638-7641, 1998). the
mechanism bhv-1 induces pcd peripheral blood mononuclear cells not
understood, clear whether nonlymphoid cells undergo pcd following
infection. study demonstrates infection bovine kidney (mdbk) cells
with bhv-1 leads pcd, judged terminal
deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dutp-biotin nick end labeling, dna
laddering, chromatin condensation. p53 appears important this
process, p53 levels promoter activity increased infection.
expression proteins stimulated p53 (p21(waf1) bax) also
activated infection. cleavage bcl-xl, protein inhibits pcd,
occurred infection, suggesting caspases (interleukin-1beta-converting 
enzyme-like proteases) activated. caspase substrates [poly(adp-ribose)
polymerase actin] also cleaved late stages infection.
inhibition caspase activity delayed cytotoxic activity virus release but
increased overall virus yield. taken together, results indicate that
nonlymphoid cells undergo pcd near end productive infection further
suggest caspases enhance virus release.
