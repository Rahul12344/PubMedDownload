a simple method rapid detection rabies virus developed employing a
single-tube reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). method 
utilized single buffer system rt pcr performed without
interruption single thermal cycling programme. two primer sets within the
genes coding rabies nucleoprotein glycoprotein used amplify 533
bp 406 bp amplicon, respectively. amplified products detected with
a challenge virus strain (cvs) rabies. amplified product with
uninfected mouse dog brain. method applied detect rabies virus in
10 mouse inoculation test (mit)-positive three mit-negative brain tissue
samples. amplified product found mit-positive samples. the
amplified product confirmed restriction endonuclease analysis using hinf1.
the results rt-pcr correlated well results mit. indicates
that single-tube rt-pcr may useful method detecting rabies virus 
brain tissue samples suspected cases rabies.
