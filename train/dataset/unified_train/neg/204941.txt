vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) elicited cytotoxic thymus-derived lymphocytes
(ctls) mice balb/c three congenic strains (balb.b, balb.k,
balb.htg). ctl lysis vsv-infected fibroblasts four strains was
restricted target cells' major histocompatibility complex (h-2). target
cells also infected two temperature-sensitive mutants vsv, tsm and
tsg which, respectively, viral matrix protein glycoprotein not
expressed 39 degrees (restrictive temperature) infected cell's surface 
membrane. restrictive temperature, cells infected wild-type vsv or
tsm lysed ctls, cells infected tsg not. requirement for
the glycoprotein target cell also evident ability antisera
to glycoprotein block completely ctl lysis vsv-infected cells.
