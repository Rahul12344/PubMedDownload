in order compare within cell various degrees specificity of
myosin alkali light chain (mlc) isoproteins sorting sarcomeres, competition 
assay established using double epitope tagging. various combinations two
different mlc isoform cdnas tagged either vesicular stomatitis virus vsv-g
(vsv) medium (mt) protein epitope co-expressed cultured
cardiomyocytes adult neonatal rat ventricles. expressed isoproteins were
detected means anti-vsv anti-mt antibodies sorting patterns
were analyzed confocal microscopy. sorting specificity mlc isoforms 
sarcomeric sites shown increase order mlc3nm, ml1sa, mlc1sb, 
to mlc1f mlc3f following sequence developmental expression. expressed 
fast skeletal muscle isoforms (mlc1f mlc3f) always localized the
a-bands myofibrils, nonmuscle type (mlc3nm) distributed throughout
the cytoplasm. slow skeletal muscle type (mlc1sa) showed weak sarcomeric
pattern co-expressed mlc3nm, distributed throughout the
cytoplasm expressed combination mlc1f, mlc3f slow
skeletal/ventricular muscle isoform (mlc1sb). mlc1sb localized the
a-bands co-expressed mlc3nm mlc1sa, also
distributed cytoplasm co-expressed mlc1f mlc3f. further,
expression chimeric cdnas revealed n-terminal lobe isoprotein
is responsible isoform-specific sorting pattern.
