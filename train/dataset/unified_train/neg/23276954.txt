matrix proteins essential components negative-sense rna, enveloped
viruses. serve wide range duties ranging self-driven membrane
budding coordination viral components modulation viral
transcription. functional similarity proteins striking,
despite major differences structures. whereas biochemical structural
studies partly hindered inherent aggregation properties these
proteins, cellular functions beginning understood. review
we summarize current knowledge negative-sense rna virus matrix proteins
and interactions viral cellular proteins. also discuss
the similarities differences matrix protein functions the
different families within negative-sense rna viruses.
