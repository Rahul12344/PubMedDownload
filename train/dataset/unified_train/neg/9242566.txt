the influence immunodeficiency course hepatitis c virus (hcv)
infection still debated, although worsening effect suggested. we
compared characteristics hepatitis c two groups hematologic patients
with different levels immunocompetence acquired virus strain
after treatment contaminated intravenous immunoglobulins (ivig). indications
for ivig therapy idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (itp) six patients
and hypogammaglobulinemia 7 patients various hematologic disorders, who
were defined immunodeficient (id). infection rate 100%. five id patients
never developed hcv antibodies despite serum hcv-rna positivity. hcv
genotype shown 10 patients tested. moreover, e1-e2 gene partial nucleotide
sequencing, performed four patients, showed identical closely related amino
acid sequences, thus strongly supporting hypothesis common source of
infection. clinical acute infection differ significantly two 
groups, subsequent liver failure developed five seven id patients
and none itp patients (p = .04). liver biopsy, performed three
cases, documented hcv cause liver damage. six id patients died,
with liver disease primary cause death four cases a
contributory cause two cases. median survival ivig 12 months, 
significantly worse itp patients (p = .0028). conclude that
immunodeficiency markedly worsens course ivig-acquired hcv infection in
hematologic patients.
