t30177, oligonucleotide composed deoxyguanosine thymidine, 17
nucleotides length contains single phosphorothioate internucleoside
linkages 5' 3' ends stability. oligonucleotide share
significant primary sequence homology possess complementary
(antisense) sequence motifs human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1)
genome. t30177 inhibited replication multiple laboratory strains hiv-1 in
human t-cell lines, peripheral blood lymphocytes, macrophages. t30177 was
also found capable inhibiting multiple clinical isolates hiv-1 and
preventing cytopathic effect hiv-1 primary cd4+ lymphocytes. in
assays human peripheral blood lymphocytes observable toxicity
associated t30177 highest concentration tested (100 microm), while
the median inhibitory concentration determined range 0.1 to
1.0 microm clinical isolates tested, resulting high therapeutic
index drug. temporal studies, kinetics addition t30177 to
infected cell cultures indicated that, like known viral adsorption blocking
agents dextran sulfate chicago sky blue, t30177 needed added cells
during soon viral infection. however, analysis nucleic acids
extracted 12 h postinfection cells treated t30177 time of
virus infection established presence unintegrated viral cdna, including
circular proviral dna, treated cells. vitro analysis viral enzymes
revealed t30177 potent inhibitor hiv-1 integrase, reducing
enzymatic activity 50% concentrations range 0.050 0.09 microm.
t30177 also able inhibit viral reverse transcriptase activity; however,
the 50% inhibitory value obtained range 1 10 microm, depending
on template used enzymatic assay. observable inhibition viral
protease detected highest concentration t30177 used (10 microm). in
experiments t30177 removed infected cell cultures 4 days
post-hiv-1 infection, total suppression virus production observed more
than 27 days. pcr analysis dna extracted cells treated fashion
was unable detect presence viral dna 11 days removal drug 
from infected cell cultures. ability t30177 inhibit laboratory
and clinical isolates hiv-1 experimental data suggest that
t30177 represents novel class integrase inhibitors indicate this
compound viable candidate evaluation therapeutic agent against
hiv-1 humans.
