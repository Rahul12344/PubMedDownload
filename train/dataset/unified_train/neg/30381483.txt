hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection may cause chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis,
and hepatocellular carcinoma. hcv exploits cellular machineries establish
persistent infection. demonstrate ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e2s
(ube2s), member ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family (e2s), was
downregulated endoplasmic reticulum stress caused hcv huh7 cells. ube2s 
interacted domain hcv ns5a degraded ns5a protein the
lys11-linked proteasome-dependent pathway. overexpression ube2s suppressed
viral propagation, depletion ube2s expression increased viral
infectivity. enzymatically inactive ube2s c95a mutant exerted antiviral
activity, suggesting ubiquitin-conjugating enzymatic activity required
for suppressive role ube2s. chromatin ubiquitination plays crucial role 
in dna damage response. showed levels ube2s lys11 chains
bound chromatin markedly decreased context hcv replication,
rendering hcv-infected cells sensitive dna damage. data suggest
that hcv counteracts antiviral activity ube2s optimize viral propagation
and may contribute hcv-induced liver pathogenesis.importance protein
homeostasis essential normal cell function. hcv infection disturbs the
protein homeostasis host cells. therefore, host cells exert anti-hcv
activity order maintain normal cellular metabolism. showed ube2s
interacted hcv ns5a degraded ns5a protein lys11-linked
proteasome-dependent pathway. however, hcv evolved overcome host antiviral
activity. demonstrated ube2s expression level suppressed in
hcv-infected cells. since ube2s ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme this
enzyme activity involved dna damage repair, hcv-infected cells more
sensitive dna damage, thus ube2s may contribute viral oncogenesis.
