production different recombinant proteins baculovirus acmnpv (bv)-infected 
cells may facilitated availability immunoassays monitor active
infection sf9 insect cells. end, two hybridomas secreting mouse
monoclonal antibodies (mabs) established different bv-related products.
the proteins recognized mab sm22 sm62 easily detectable by
immunoblotting immunostaining sf9 cells infected recombinant bv
(rbv), non-infected cells. production paralleled the
recombinant proteins analyzed independent type recombinant
protein expressed. thus, immunoassays mabs allow: (1) daily monitoring
of infection occurring small large scale cultures sf9 cells using a
defined rbv; (2) preliminary assessment active rbv infection absence of
a specific reagent recombinant protein (3) single-reagent comparison 
of infection achieved sf9 cells exposed rbvs expressing different
recombinant proteins.
