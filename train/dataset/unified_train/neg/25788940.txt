background/aims. hepatitis b virus (hbv) form immune complexes may
result various types glomerulonephritis (gn). however, proteinuria can
occur kidney diseases besides hbv-related gn (hbv-gn). aim
of study elucidate causes proteinuria report the
clinical outcomes hbv-gn. methods. reviewed medical records patients
positive serum hepatitis b surface antigen underwent renal biopsies due
to proteinuria tertiary medical center korea. results. total 55
patients included. hbv-gn diagnosed 20 (36.4%) patients by
confirming presence immune complexes (12 13 membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis, 7 8 membranous glomerulonephritis, 1 13
immunoglobulin nephropathy). twenty-one patients types gn. total
of 13 (65%) hbv-gn patients treated antiviral agents median 11
months. however, degrees proteinuria significantly reduced the
antiviral intervention group compared control group. conclusions.
proteinuria caused various glomerular diseases hbv-gn accounts 
one-third total gn cases. well-designed prospective study needed assess 
whether antiviral therapy hbv infection may improve prognosis of
hbv-gn.
