the herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) mutant dl1403 contains 2 kb deletion
within sequences encoding immediate early polypeptide vmw110. previous
experiments showed although dl1403 exhibits normal patterns gene
expression following infection m.o.i. 5 p.f.u./cell growth and
plaquing efficiency impaired low multiplicity infections, particularly 
human foetal lung (hfl) cells. investigated ability two 
human herpesviruses, varicella-zoster virus (vzv) human cytomegalovirus
(hcmv), compensate defect low m.o.i. hfl cells. co-infection
with hcmv resulted greatly increased plaque numbers apparent
particle/p.f.u. ratios dl1403 stocks reduced values similar those
exhibited wild-type hsv-1 stocks. complementation dl1403 low
multiplicity infections hcmv vzv also demonstrated increased
yield mutant virus increase synthesis dl1403 dna. ultraviolet
irradiation hcmv abolished ability complement dl1403 presence
of adenovirus 5 stimulatory effect dl1403 dna replication. hfl
monolayers infected dilutions dl1403 stocks plaques
were produced, replication mutant virus could induced superinfection
with hcmv 7 days initial infection. results indicate a
non-lytic interaction dl1403 hfl cells likely consequence
of low multiplicity infection plaque formation.
