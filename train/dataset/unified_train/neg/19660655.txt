adeno-associated viral (aav) vectors currently preeminent gene therapy
vehicles neurological application. however, issues regarding trafficking 
of aav vectors within primate brain, consequently control the
targeting transgene expression, remain matter investigation. studies in
nonhuman primates shown distribution aav vectors largely mediated
by flow cerebrospinal fluid within perivascular space, trafficking of
vector along axonal projections, aav receptor binding. together these
processes result transduction cells areas distant the
parenchymal site infusion. additionally, addressed unique surgical
issues concerning delivery aav vectors convection-enhanced delivery are
working toward tailored delivery means real-time mri.
