species-specificity one major characteristics cytomegaloviruses
(cmvs) primary reason lack mouse model direct
infection human cmv (hcmv). determined cmv cross-species
infections blocked post-entry level intrinsic cellular defense
mechanisms, details known. important explore cmvs
interact subnuclear structure cross-species host cell. our
present study, discovered nuclear domain 10 (nd10) human cells not
disrupted murine cmv (mcmv) nd10 mouse cells disrupted
by hcmv, although nd10-disrupting protein, immediate-early protein 1 (ie1),
also colocalized nd10 cross-species infections. addition, found
that ul131-repaired hcmv strain ad169 (vdw215-badrul131) infect mouse
cells produce immediate-early (ie) early (e) proteins neither dna
replication viral particles detectable mouse cells. unrepaired ad169 
can express ie1 mouse cells. hcmv-infected mouse cells and
mcmv-infected human cells, knocking-down nd10 components (pml, daxx, and
sp100) resulted significantly increased viral-protein production. our
observations provide evidence support hypothesis nd10 nd10
components might important defensive factors cmv cross-species
infection.
