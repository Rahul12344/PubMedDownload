mammalian venom secreted phospholipases a(2) (spla(2)s) associated 
with variety biological effects. show several spla(2)s protect 
human primary blood leukocytes replication various macrophage t
cell-tropic hiv-1 strains. inhibition spla(2)s results neither a
virucidal effect cytotoxic effect host cells, involves a
more specific mechanism. spla(2)s effect virus binding cells on
syncytia formation, prevent intracellular release viral
capsid protein, suggesting spla(2)s block viral entry cells before
virion uncoating independently coreceptor usage. various inhibitors
and catalytic products spla(2) effect hiv-1 infection, suggesting
that spla(2) catalytic activity involved antiviral effect. instead,
the antiviral activity appears involve specific interaction spla(2)s to
host cells. indeed, 11 spla(2)s venom mammalian tissues assayed, 4
venom spla(2)s found potent hiv-1 inhibitors (id(50) < 1 nm) 
also bind specifically host cells high affinities (k(0.5) < 1 nm).
although mammalian pancreatic group ib inflammatory-type group iia spla(2)s
were inactive hiv-1 replication, results could physiological
interest, novel spla(2)s characterized humans.
