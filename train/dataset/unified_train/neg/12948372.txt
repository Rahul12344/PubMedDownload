rotaviral associated disease infants uk seasonal infection in
adults uncommon relationship little explored. 
adult sera collected monthly one year routine hospital samples were
screened presence anti-group rotavirus immunoglobulin class
antibodies marker recent infection. anti-rotavirus igm seen all
age groups throughout year little obvious seasonal variation the
distribution antibody levels. igm concentrations proportion
seropositive threshold increased age high concentrations
consistently observed elderly. results suggest either high infection rates
of rotavirus adults, irrespective seasonal disease incidence infants,
igm persistence igm cross-reactivity. results support recent evidence of
differences infant adult rotavirus epidemiology highlight the
need extensive surveys investigate age time related infection and
transmission rotavirus.
