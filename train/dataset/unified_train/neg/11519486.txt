in present article report generation neurovirological reagent, an
adenovirus vector efficiently delivers gene neurotrophin-3
(nt-3) receptor, trkc. using adtrkc vector, examined induction the
expression neurotrophin receptor pure cultures mouse
astrocytes, glial cell type constitutively express gene.
infection astrocytes optimal dose 100-200 plaque forming units
(p.f.u.) per cell, induced expression specific mrna, demonstrated rt-pcr
and northern blot. mrna translated produce mean 20,157
biologically active receptor molecules per astrocyte kd 4.1 x 10(-11)
m, demonstrated 125i-nt-3 binding. 2d electrophoresis, mature
glycoprotein precursors recognised antibodies raised the
carboxy-terminal peptide trk. binding ligand induced
autophosphorylation oftrkc 3h-thymidine incorporation transduced cells.
these results demonstrate adtrkc vector efficiently mediates the
expression high-levels biologically active nt-3 receptors.
