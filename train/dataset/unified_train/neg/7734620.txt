to elucidate role ribose moiety substrate binding, various atp
derivatives modified ribose moiety studied probes t4 rna
ligase first stage reaction. kinetic parameters competitive inhibition
were determined. inhibition experiments using substrate analogs demonstrated that
the major binding determinants atp analogs purine triphosphate
moieties atp; modification ribose moiety critical. adenosine
triphosphates attached agarose used affinity adsorbent for
purification t4 rna ligase. derivatives successfully used in
reversible binding enzyme. best results achieved agarose coupled
via n6 purine moiety atp.
