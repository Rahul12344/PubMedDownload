recent evidence indicated cross-species transmission hepatitis e virus
(hev) pigs wild boars humans, causing zoonosis, mostly via
consumption uncooked undercooked animal meat/viscera. however, efficient
cell culture system swine boar hev strains established. we
inoculated a549 cells 12 swine boar hev strains liver, feces, or
serum origin hev load ≥2.0 × 10(4) copies per well found the
hev progeny replicated efficiently human hev strains, maximum load
of ~10(8) copies/ml. however, hev load culture medium 30 days
post-inoculation differed markedly inoculum, ranging 1.0 × 10(2) 1.1 ×
10(7) copies/ml upon inoculation lower load approximately 10(5) copies
per well. progeny passaged successfully onto a549 plc/prf/5 cells.
in sharp contrast, progeny viruses detectable culture supernatant 
upon inoculation 13 swine boar hev strains hev load <1.8 ×
10(4) copies per well. present study also demonstrates swine liver sold 
as food infectious, supporting risk zoonotic food-borne hev
infection.
