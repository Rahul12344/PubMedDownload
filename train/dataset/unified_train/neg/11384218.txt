a potential use virus-based transient expression vectors large-scale
production commercial specialty products, would require inoculation 
of many acres plants viral vector. however, several
concerns widespread use virus-based vectors. among the
spread engineered virus susceptible plants generation and
persistence recombinant viruses environment. using tobacco mosaic
virus (tmv)-based transient gene expression vector, 30b, expresses the
jellyfish green fluorescent protein (30b-gfp), describe predominant types 
of hybrid viruses developed plants. general, recombinants deleted 
the foreign gene repeated sequences, retaining sequences required 
for optimal replication movement. pathogenicity studies challenge
experiments designed make comparative assessment competitiveness of
the recombinants parent virus, recombinants reduced vigor and
were less competitive pathogenic tmv, virus already present
in areas tobacco grown.
