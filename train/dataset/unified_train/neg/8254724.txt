a live candidate hepatitis virus vaccine, developed hm-175 strain 
adapted growth primary african green monkey kidney (agmk) cells, was
adapted growth mrc-5 cells. nucleotide sequence mrc-5
cell-adapted virus determined compared known sequence the
agmk cell-adapted virus. thirteen unique mutations, occurred passage
in mrc-5 cells, identified. four unique mutations located a
cluster 5' noncoding region (nc), three remaining nine
mutations encoded amino acid changes. infectious chimeric cdnas constructed 
from infectious cdna clones agmk cell-adapted wild-type hm-175 viruses
and pcr-amplified cdna segments mrc-5 cell-adapted virus. viruses
encoded plasmids recovered transfection cultured cells
with vitro transcripts, growth phenotypes fetal rhesus kidney 4
(frhk-4) mrc-5 cells determined. important growth-enhancing
mutations could divided three sets. two located 5'
nc region, third located 2c nonstructural gene. mutations 
in 5' nc region developed passage mrc-5 cells were
indispensable efficient growth mrc-5 cells, combination two
groups 5' nc region one 2c gene required increase
growth dramatically mrc-5 cells.
