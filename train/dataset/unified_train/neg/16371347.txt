experimental studies revealed elements human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 (hiv-1) 5'-untranslated leader region (5'-utr) fold vitro
into two alternative conformations, branched (bmh) 'linearized' (ldi) and
switch achieve different functionality. study we
computationally explored detail, massively parallel genetic algorithm
(mpgafold), propensity 13 hiv-1 5'-utrs fold bmh ldi
conformation types. besides bmh conformations results predict the
existence two functionally equivalent types ldi conformations. one is
similar shown vitro exist hiv-1 lai, a
novel conformation exemplified hiv-1 mal long-distance interactions. these
novel mpgafold results corroborated consensus probability matrix
algorithm applied set 155 hiv-1 sequences. also determined in
detail impact various strain mutations, domain sizes folds of
elongating sequences simulating folding transcription hiv-1 rna
secondary structure folding dynamics.
