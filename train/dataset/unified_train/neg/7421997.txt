leukaemia virus infection promotes fibroblast transformation normal balb/c
mouse dna.

krump-konvalinkova v, van den berg kj.

all normal cells thought carry genetic information oncogenic
transformation, which, activation continuous expression, might make the
cell cancerous. presently known transforming retroviruses contain
transforming genes probably derived recombination slow
oncogenic retrovirus cellular sequences closely related genes. it
was recently reported cellular dna fragments normal tissue culture
cells could transform mouse fibroblasts vitro low efficiency. high
efficiency transformation observed secondary transfections when
high molecular weight dna transformed recipient cells used the
transforming agent. observed dna isolated different balb/c mouse
organs transform nih/3t3 balb/3t3 cells, although low
frequency. attempts increase initial efficiency transformation, we
have found preinfection recipient 3t3 cells murine leukaemia viruses
markedly enhances focus formation normal balb/c dna fragments.
