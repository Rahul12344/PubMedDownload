abstract: metastatic bone tumor-induced changes gene transcription and
translation pain-related regions nervous system may participate 
development maintenance bone cancer pain. epigenetic modifications
including dna methylation regulate gene transcription. here, report that
intrathecal injection decitabine, dna methyltransferase (dnmt) inhibitor,
dose dependently attenuated development maintenance bone cancer pain
induced injecting prostate cancer cells tibia. level de
novo dnmt3a, dnmt3b, time dependently increased ipsilateral l4/5
dorsal horn (not l4/5 dorsal root ganglion) prostate cancer cells
injection. blocking increase microinjection recombinant
adeno-associated virus 5 (aav5) expressing dnmt3a shrna dorsal horn rescued 
prostate cancer cells-induced downregulation dorsal horn kv1.2 expression 
impaired prostate cancer cells-induced pain hypersensitivity. turn, mimicking 
this increase microinjection aav5 expressing full-length dnmt3a into
dorsal horn reduced dorsal horn kv1.2 expression produced pain
hypersensitivity absence prostate cancer cells injection.
administration neither decitabine virus affected locomotor function and
acute responses mechanical, thermal, cold stimuli. given dnmt3a mrna
is co-expressed kcna2 mrna (encoding kv1.2) individual dorsal horn
neurons, findings suggest increased dorsal horn dnmt3a contributes to
bone cancer pain silencing dorsal horn kv1.2 expression. dnmt3a may
represent potential new target cancer pain management.
