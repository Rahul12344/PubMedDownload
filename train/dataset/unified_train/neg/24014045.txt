this article examines applicability near-infrared spectroscopy (nirs) to
evaluate virus state freeze-dried live, attenuated vaccine formulation. 
therefore, formulation freeze-dried using different virus volumes and
after applying different pre-freeze-drying virus treatments (resulting in
different virus states): (i) used commercial formulation; (ii) without 
antigen (placebo); (iii) concentrated via centrifugal filter device; (iv)
stressed 96 h exposure room temperature. freeze-dried product was
measured directly freeze-drying nir spectroscopy spectra 
analyzed using principal component analysis (pca). herewith, two nir spectral
regions evaluated: (i) 7300-4000 cm(-1) region containing amide a/ii
band might reflect information coated proteins freeze-dried live,
attenuated viruses; (ii) c-h vibration overtone regions (10,000-7500 
6340-5500 cm(-1) ) might supply information lipid layer surrounding 
the freeze-dried live, attenuated viruses. different pre-freeze-drying
treated live, attenuated virus formulations (different virus states virus
volumes) resulted different clusters scores plots resulting the
pca collected nir spectra. secondly, partial least squares discriminant
analysis models (pls-da) developed evaluated, allowing classification of
the freeze-dried formulations according virus pretreatment. results of
this study suggest applicability nir spectroscopy evaluating live,
attenuated vaccine formulations respect virus pretreatment and
virus volume.
