hypothesis background: recent years, progress made the
understanding bell's palsy, common form acute facial weakness.
herpes simplex virus (hsv) reactivation within geniculate ganglion with
subsequent inflammation entrapment nerve meatal foramen has
been proposed pathogenetic mechanism. challenged accuracy by
analyzing data presence viral genomic dna hsv-1 2, human
herpes virus (hhv)-6a/b, well varizella zoster virus (vzv) patients with
bell's palsy control patients without disease.
methods: polymerase chain reaction performed primer sets specific for
viral genomic dna hsv-1, hsv-2, vzv facial muscle biopsy specimens from
patients bell's palsy. control specimens, scarpa's ganglion of
patients meniere's disease geniculate ganglion harvested autopsy 
from patients without history facial palsy. second study, used
polymerase chain reaction primers specific hsv-1, -2, hhv-6a, -6b to
analyze presence viruses tear fluid samples control
patients patients acute bell's palsy.
results: hsv-1 vzv genomic dna detected 86 43%, respectively, 
geniculate ganglion preparations control specimen. able to
detect presence hsv-1, hsv-2, vzv genomic dna ganglion scarpae or
muscle biopsy results control bell's palsy patients. hhv-6a could be
detected tear fluid samples 40% control patients 30% bell's palsy
patients.
conclusions: sole presence hsv genomic dna within sensory ganglion
along facial nerve explain direct association bell's palsy.
the missing link would identification active replicating virus, an
investigation yet carried out.
