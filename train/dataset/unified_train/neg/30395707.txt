coliphages indicate contamination recreational waters previous studies
show sunlight important altering densities coliphages, other
indicator microorganisms, pathogens aquatic environments. here, report 
on laboratory studies light-induced inactivation two coliphage
groups-male-specific (f+) somatic coliphage-under various conditions in
phosphate-buffered water (pbw). strains isolated wastewater treatment
facilities laboratory strains (ms2 phix174 coliphages) evaluated.
inactivation rates determined series irradiations using simulated
solar radiation passed light filters blocked different parts 
ultraviolet spectral region. inactivation rates spectral irradiance from
these experiments analyzed develop biological weighting functions
(bwfs) light-induced inactivation. bwfs used model the
inactivation coliphages range conditions aquatic environments
that included two beach sites lake michigan one lake erie. example,
modeled effects sunlight attenuation, using uv absorption data three 
great lakes beach sites, inferred direct photoinactivation rate constants,
averaged one-meter water column swimmable areas, reduced 2- to
5-fold, compared near-surface rate constants.
