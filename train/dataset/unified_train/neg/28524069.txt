viral nanotechnology revolutionizing biomimetic bioinspired synthesis 
of novel nanomaterials. bottom-up nanofabrication self-assembly individual 
molecular components elongated viral nanoparticles (vnps) virus-like
particles (vlps) resulted production superior materials and
structures nano(bio)technological fields. viral capsids attractive
materials, symmetry, monodispersity, polyvalency. helical
vnps/vlps unique prefabricated nanoscaffolds large surface area to
volume ratios high aspect ratios, enable construction exquisite
supramolecular nanostructures. review discusses genetic chemical
modifications outer, inner, interface surfaces viral protein cage
that almost certainly lead development superior next-generation
targeted drug delivery imaging systems, biosensors, energy storage and
optoelectronic devices, therapeutics, catalysts.
