three full-length genomic clones (pb19-m20, pb19-fl pb19-hg1) parvovirus
b19 produced different laboratories. pb19-m20 shown produce
infectious virus. determine differences infectivity, three plasmids
were tested transfection infection assays. three clones similar
in viral dna replication, rna transcription, viral capsid protein production.
however, pb19-m20 pb19-hg1 produced infectious virus. comparison of
viral sequences showed significant differences itr ns regions. the
capsid region, nucleotide sequence difference conferring amino
acid substitution (e176k) phospholipase a2-like motif vp1-unique
(vp1u) region. recombinant vp1u e176k mutation catalytic
activity compared wild-type. mutation introduced into
pb19-m20, infectivity significantly attenuated, confirming critical role 
of motif. investigation original serum pb19-fl cloned 
confirmed phospholipase mutation present native b19 virus.
