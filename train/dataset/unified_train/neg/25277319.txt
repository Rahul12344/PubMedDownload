over past decades, many new therapeutic approaches developed for
several conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases. however, efficient
biodistribution delivery biological target sites hampered the
presence cell tissue barriers, clinical therapy prevented 
requirement invasive administration routes. candidate drug conjugation to
cell-penetrating peptides, able cross cellular membranes reach
biological targets even administered systemically, represents promising
tool overcome issue. here, review biology, classification and
mechanisms internalization cell-penetrating peptides. focus our
attention cell-penetrating peptide: hiv-derived tat peptide, discuss
its efficient controversial use basic, preclinical clinical research
from discovery present day.
