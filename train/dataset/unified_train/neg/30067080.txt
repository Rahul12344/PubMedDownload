increased expression dna methyltransferase-1 (dnmt1) associates the
progression many human diseases. dnmt1 induces cell proliferation,
drugs inhibit dnmt1 used treat proliferative diseases. 
these drugs nonspecific inhibitors dnmt1, subsidiary events the
compensatory mechanisms activated absence dnmt1 limit their
therapeutic application. here, studied molecular mechanisms occur
during angioplasty-induced restenosis found dnmt1 inhibition 
vitro vivo approaches resulted induction dna
methyltransferase-3a (dnmt3a) expression. vascular smooth muscle cells
(vsmcs), microrna hsa-mir-1264 mimic, specifically inhibiting dnmt1, induced 
nuclear expression dnmt3a. contrary, induced expression of
dnmt3a vsmcs transfected hsa-mir-1264 inhibitor. further,
ectopic expression suppressor cytokine signaling 3 (socs3) through
adeno-associated virus (aav)-mediated gene delivery coronary arteries of
yucatan microswine showed inhibition dnmt1 dnmt3a vivo. these
findings show existence inter-regulatory mechanism dnmt1 and
dnmt3a where, absence dnmt1, induction dnmt3a compensates the
loss dnmt1 functions, suggesting inhibition dnmt1 dnmt3a 
are required prevent restenosis.
