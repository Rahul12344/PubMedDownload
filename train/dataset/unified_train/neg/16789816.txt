the first efficacy trials--named step--of cell vaccine hiv/aids began
in 2004. unprecedented structure trials raised new modeling and
statistical challenges. plausible memory cells, opposed to
antibodies, actually prevent infection? fail prevention, what
extent ameliorate disease? estimate efficacy vaccine 
trial two primary endpoints, one traditional, one entirely novel (viral load
after infection), latter may influenced selection bias due to
the former? preparation step trials, biostatisticians developed novel 
techniques estimating causal effect vaccine viral load, while
accounting post-randomization selection bias. techniques not
been tested biologically plausible scenarios. introduce new stochastic
models cell hiv kinetics, making use new estimates rate that
cytotoxic lymphocytes--ctls; so-called killer cells--can kill
hiv-infected cells. based models, make surprising discovery 
it entirely implausible hiv-specific ctls might prevent infection--as
the designers explicitly acknowledged chose endpoints step
trials. simulating thousands trials, demonstrate new
statistical methods correctly identify efficacious vaccine, while
protecting false conclusion vaccine exacerbates disease. in
addition uncovering surprising immunological scenario, results
illustrate utility mechanistic modeling biostatistics.
