virus-removal filtration technology commonly used manufacturing process
for biologics remove potential viral contaminants. virus-removal filters
designed retaining parvovirus, one smallest mammalian viruses, are
considered industry standard effectively remove broad ranges of
viruses. long observed performance virus filters be
influenced virus preparations used laboratory scale studies (pda,
2010). however, remains unclear exactly quality attributes virus
preparations critical indicative virus filter performance measured
by effectiveness virus removal filter capacity consistency. attempt 
to better understand relationship virus preparation virus filter 
performance, systematically prepared analyzed different grades of
parvovirus different purity levels compared performance profiles
on viresolve® pro parvovirus filters using four different molecules. virus
preparations used studies characterized using various methods to
measure dna protein content well hydrodynamic diameter virus
particles. results indicate performance viresolve® pro filters
can significantly impacted depending purity virus preparations
used spike recovery studies. importantly, demonstrated
that purity virus preparations directly correlated measurable
biochemical biophysical properties virus preparations dna 
protein content monodispersal status, thus making possible to
significantly improve consistency predictability virus filter
performance process step validations.
