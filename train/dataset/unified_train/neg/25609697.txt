recombinant adenoviruses containing double-stranded dna genome 26-45 kb were
broadly explored basic virology, vaccination purposes, treatment of
tumors based oncolytic virotherapy, simply tool efficient gene
transfer. however, majority recombinant adenoviral vectors (advs) based
on small fraction adenovirus types genetic modification.
recombineering techniques provide powerful tools arbitrary engineering of
recombinant dna. here, adopted seamless recombineering technology for
high-throughput arbitrary genetic engineering recombinant adenoviral dna
molecules. cloning platform also includes novel recombination
pipeline based bacterial artificial chromosomes (bacs). enables
generation novel recombinant adenoviruses different sources switching
between commonly used early generation advs last generation high-capacity
advs lacking viral coding sequences making attractive candidates for
clinical use. combination novel recombination pipeline allowing cloning
of advs containing large complex transgenes possibility generate
arbitrary chimeric capsid-modified adenoviruses, techniques allow
generation tailored advs distinct features. technologies pave
the way toward broader applications advs molecular medicine including gene 
therapy vaccination studies.
