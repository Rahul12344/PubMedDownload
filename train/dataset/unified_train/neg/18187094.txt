background: post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (ptld) severe
complication transplant recipients. detection increased epstein-barr viral 
(ebv) load peripheral blood acts surrogate marker increased risk 
of ptld development. prospectively monitored ebv load, immunosuppression and
ptld pediatric heart transplant (htx) patients determine risk factors for
an increased ebv load risk ptld.
methods: forty-one pediatric heart transplant recipients included and
underwent prospective monitoring immunosuppression ethylene-diamine 
tetraacetic acid (edta) blood sampling ebv load (copies/microg dna)
measurement using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr; taqman) 
during january 2001 december 2006.
results: ebv load measurable 70% significantly increased (>2,000
copies/microg dna) 35% patients, median ebv load 5,100 (range
0 50,665 copies/microg dna). increased ebv load detected patients
receiving csa-azathioprine two doses anti-thymocyte globulin
(atg) <10 years age, without significant differences csa
blood levels. lowest negative ebv load measured patients receiving
csa-mycophenolate mofetil (mmf) csa only. csa blood levels not
predictable increased ebv load ptld. six patients developed a
ebv-associated b-cell lymphoma (ptld), among 4 (67%) receiving
csa-azathioprine.
conclusions: frequent ebv load monitoring identifies patients high risk for
ptld development. azathioprine atg major risk factors increased ebv
load ptld patients may benefit change immunosuppression in
addition pre-emptive anti-viral anti-tumor strategies.
