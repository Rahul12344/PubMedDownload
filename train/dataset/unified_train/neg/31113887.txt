pandemic hiv-1 (group m) emerged following cross-species transmission a
simian immunodeficiency virus chimpanzees (sivcpz) humans. primate
lentiviruses (hiv/siv) require cell receptor cd4 enter target
cells. surveying sequence function cd4 50 chimpanzee
individuals, find chimpanzee cd4 alleles encode fixed,
chimpanzee-specific substitution (34t) creates glycosylation site the
virus binding surface cd4 receptor. additionally, single nucleotide
polymorphism (snp) arisen chimpanzee cd4 (68t) creates second
glycosylation site virus-binding interface. substitution 
yet fixed, instead alleles containing snp still circulating within
chimpanzee populations. thus, allelic versions chimpanzee cd4 singly
glycosylated virus binding surface, allelic versions doubly
glycosylated. doubly glycosylated forms chimpanzee cd4 reduce hiv-1 sivcpz
infection much two orders magnitude. full restoration virus
infection cells bearing chimpanzee cd4 requires reversion threonines
at sites 34 68, destroying glycosylation sites, suggesting that
the effects glycans additive. differentially glycosylated cd4
receptors biochemically purified used neutralization assays and
microscale thermophoresis show glycans chimpanzee cd4 reduce
binding affinity lentiviral surface glycoprotein, env. glycans
create shield protects cd4 engaged viruses, demonstrating 
powerful form host resistance deadly primate lentiviruses.
