rna templates yield corresponding dna presence human
immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (hiv-1 rt). purpose this
study determine whether rna modified either
2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro analogs internucleotide phosphorothioate linkages
could serve templates hiv-1 rt. modified rna contained either
2'-deoxy 2'-fluoro pyrimidine nucleoside analogs internucleotide
phosphorothioate diester linkages 5'- pyrimidine nucleosides were
enzymatically synthesized tested template activity recombinant hiv-1
rt. rna modified either 2'-deoxy-2'-fluorouridine with
internucleotide phosphorothioate linkages 5'- pyrimidines yielded full length 
hiv-1 reverse transcription products, complete fidelity transcription.
rna modified 2'-deoxy-2'-fluorocytidine, either alone in
combination 2'-deoxy-2'-fluorouridine, function templates for
hiv-1 rt, conditions reported here. ability of
2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-modified phosphorothioate-modified rna serve as
template rna-dependent dna polymerase hiv-1 rt hitherto been
reported.
