a cyclic amp-stimulated chloride conductance appears cystic fibrosis
gene expressed non-epithelial cells infection recombinant viruses. 
cyclic amp-stimulated conductance system mediated ohmic,
low-conductance cl- channel human secretory epithelia, control 
channel phosphorylation directly demonstrated. report the
appearance low-conductance cl- channel chinese hamster ovary cells
after stable transfection cystic fibrosis gene. channel regulated
on-cell membrane-permeant analogues camp off-cell protein kinases 
and c alkaline phosphatase. results evidence the
cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator cl- channel activated
by specific phosphorylation events inactivated dephosphorylation; they
reveal unsuspected synergism converging kinase regulatory pathways.
