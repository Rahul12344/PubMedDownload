a simple general method developed synthesis of
various4(3h)-quinazolinone derivatives treatment appropriate
3-amino-2-aryl-4(3h)-quinazolinone substituted benzaldehyde ethanol.
the structures compoundswere characterized elemental analysis, ir,
(1)h-nmr (13)c-nmr spectra. title 2-aryl- or
2-methyl-3-(substituted-benzalamino)-4(3h)-quinazolinone compounds iii-1~iii-31
were found possess moderate good antiviral activity. semi-quantitative pcr 
andreal time pcr assays used ascertain target action compound
iii-31against tmv. studies suggest iii-31 possesses antiviral activity
due inductionof up-regulation pr-1a pr-5, thereby inhibiting virus
