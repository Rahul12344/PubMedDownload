cxcl12/cxcr4 axis: emerging neuromodulator pathological pain.

luo x, wang x, xia z, chung sk, cheung cw.

the roles chemokine c-x-c motif ligand 12 (cxcl12) receptor chemokine 
c-x-c motif receptor 4 (cxcr4) reveal chemokine axis emerging
neuromodulator nervous system. peripheral central nervous
systems, cxcl12 cxcr4 expressed various kinds nociceptive
structures, cxcl12/cxcr4 axis possesses pronociceptive property. recent
studies demonstrated critical roles development maintenance
of pathological pain, neuronal glial mechanisms involved this
cxcl12/cxcr4 axis-mediated pain processing. review, summarize the
recent development roles mechanisms cxcl12/cxcr4 axis the
pathogenesis chronic pain sciatic nerve injury, human immunodeficiency
virus-associated sensory neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, spinal cord injury,
bone cancer, opioid tolerance, opioid-induced hyperalgesia. potential
targeting cxcl12/cxcr4 axis effective broad-spectrum pharmacological
approach chronic pain therapy also discussed.
