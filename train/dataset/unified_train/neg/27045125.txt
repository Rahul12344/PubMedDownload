background: guidelines recommend limited use routine cd4 cell count
testing human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected patients successful
viral control immunocompromised.
methods: cd4 viral load tests patients receiving hiv care us
department veterans affairs 2009-2013 evaluated determine
trends cd4 testing frequency number, cost, results cd4 tests
considered optional guidelines.
results: 28 530 individuals sufficient testing included. at
the time last cd4 test, 19.8% cohort eligible optional
monitoring 15.6% minimal monitoring. cd4 testing frequency declined by
10.8% 4 years, reducing direct cost testing us$196 000 per year.
full implementation new treatment guidelines could reduce cd4 testing a
further 28.9%, additional annual savings us$600 000. cd4 tests conducted
during periods potentially reduced monitoring rarely <200 cells/Âµl: 1.1% 
of tests conducted minimal monitoring recommended 0.3% of
tests conducted optional monitoring recommended less this
value.
conclusions: reduced cd4 monitoring hiv-infected patients would result in
modest cost savings likely reduce patient anxiety, little impact
on quality care. veterans affairs made substantial progress in
reducing frequency optional cd4 testing, reductions may still 
be warranted.
