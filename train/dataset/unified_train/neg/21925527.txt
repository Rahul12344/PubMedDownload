following cell entry, viruses detected cytotoxic lymphocytes. these
cytotoxic lymphocytes induce host cell apoptosis prevent the
propagation virus. viruses fewer epitopes higher survival
probability, selected evolution. however, mutations a
fitness cost evolutionary periods viruses maintain epitopes. the
number epitopes viral protein balance selective
advantage fewer epitopes reduced fitness following epitope 
removing mutations. discuss bioinformatic analysis number epitopes
in various viral proteins propose optimization framework explain 
numbers. show, using genomic analysis theoretical optimization
framework, critical factor affecting number presented epitopes is
the expression stage viral life cycle gene coding protein. 
the early expression epitopes lead destruction host cell
before budding take place. show lower number epitopes is
expected early proteins even late proteins much higher copy number.
