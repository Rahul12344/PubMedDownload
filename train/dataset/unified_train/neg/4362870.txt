the dnas five nondefective adenovirus 2 (ad2)-simian virus 40 (sv40)
hybrid viruses contain overlapping segments early region wild-type sv40
dna. complementary dna strands five viruses separated with
synthetic polyribonucleotides isopycnic cesium chloride gradients. the
relative amounts early late sv40 template dna virus were
determined rna-dna hybridization late lytic sv40 rna, contains
sequences complementary templates. distribution early and
late templates five overlapping sv40 segments, conclude either the
entire early region sv40 symmetrically transcribed vivo, or, more
probably, early sv40 templates contiguous.
