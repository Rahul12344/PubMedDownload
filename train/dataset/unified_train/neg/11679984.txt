liver transplant recipients recurrent hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection
often histological hepatitis, patients, graft failure develops. 
the aim nonrandomized study determine efficacy tolerability
of interferon alfa (ifn alfa) alone ifn alfa ribavirin combination
therapy patients. forty transplant recipients recurrent hepatitis
were initiated therapy ifn alfa-2b 3 million units (mu) three times
weekly 1 month followed 5 mu three times weekly 5 months. twenty
patients administered ifn alfa-2b, 3 mu three times weekly 1 month
followed 5 mu three times weekly 11 months, ribavirin, 600 mg, twice
daily orally 12 months concurrently. primary end point sustained
clearance serum hcv rna, secondary end points serum alanine
aminotransferase (alt) level normalization histological improvement. thirty
patients completed 6 months ifn-alfa monotherapy 15 patients completed 12 
months ifn alfa ribavirin combination therapy. end-of-treatment
biochemical responses similar two groups (ifn alfa, 20% v combination
therapy, 25%); however, viral clearance greater combination-therapy
group (40% v 15%; p = .04). six months completion therapy, 1
patient (2.5%) ifn-alfa group 4 patients (20%) the
combination-therapy group hcv rna negative (p = .03). serum alt hcv rna 
levels declined significantly groups therapy. no
improvement inflammatory grade, fibrosis score worse groups.
ten patients (25%) ifn-alfa group 5 patients (20%) the
combination-therapy group withdrew adverse effects. conclude that
in liver allograft recipients recurrent hepatitis c, combination therapy
with ifn alfa ribavirin efficacious treatment ifn alfa
alone. however, efficacy limited tolerability.
