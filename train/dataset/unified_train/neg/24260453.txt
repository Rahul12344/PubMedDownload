emiliania huxleyi, key player global carbon cycle one best
studied coccolithophores respect biogeochemical cycles, climatology, 
host-virus interactions. strains e. huxleyi show phenotypic plasticity
regarding growth behaviour, light-response, calcification, acidification, and
virus susceptibility. phenomenon likely consequence genomic
differences, transcriptomic responses, environmental conditions threats 
such viral infections. used e. huxleyi genome microarray based the
sequenced strain ccmp1516 (reference strain) perform comparative genomic
hybridizations (cgh) 16 e. huxleyi strains different geographic origin. 
investigated genomic diversity plasticity focused the
identification genes related virus susceptibility coccolith production 
(calcification). among tested 31940 gene models core genome 14628 genes 
was identified hybridization among 16 e. huxleyi strains. 224 probes were
characterized specific reference strain ccmp1516. compared the
sequenced e. huxleyi strain ccmp1516 variation gene content 30
percent among strains observed. comparison core non-core transcripts

associated virus susceptibility calcification. genes associated with
virus susceptibility include bax inhibitor-1 protein, three lrr receptor-like
protein kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinase. list transcripts
associated coccolith production stimulate research, e.g. by
genetic manipulation. particular, v-type proton atpase 16 kda proteolipid
