exon skipping demonstrated successful strategy gene
therapy duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd): rational convert
severe duchenne forms milder becker ones. here, show selection u1 
snrna-antisense constructs able confer effective rescue dystrophin
synthesis δ44 duchenne genetic background, skipping exon 45;
moreover, demonstrate resulting dystrophin able recover timing 
of myogenic marker expression, relocalize neuronal nitric oxide synthase
(nnos) rescue expression mirnas previously shown sensitive the
dystrophin-nnos-hdac2 pathway. becker mutations display different phenotypes,
likely depending whether shorter protein able reconstitute wide 
range wild-type functions. among them, efficient assembly the
dystrophin-associated protein complex (dapc) nnos localization important.
comparing different becker deletions demonstrate correlation the
ability mutant dystrophin relocalize nnos expression levels 
two mirnas, mir-1 mir29c, known involved muscle homeostasis to
be controlled dys-nnos-hdac2 pathway.
