we investigated mutation p53 gene leading expression a
truncated 46,000-dalton protein friend virus-induced erythroleukemia cell
line. cdna sequence analysis revealed deletion nucleotide sequences exon 
7 part exon 8; 17 additional nucleotides, derived intron 6, were
present cdna served maintain reading frame encoded
protein. comparison p53 protein species indicated region
of molecule missing p46 included highly conserved region. addition,
p46 failed bind sv40 large antigen vitro conditions promoted 
binding p53 large t. seems likely, therefore, important
functional property p53 may affected mutation.
