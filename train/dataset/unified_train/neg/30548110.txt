hepatitis e virus (hev) infects humans animals. swine confirmed
to principal natural reservoir, raises concern hev infection 
would substantially increasing among swine workers. present study
calculated pooled prevalence igg antibodies hev among swine
workers general population previous cross-sectional studies. we
conducted meta-analysis comparing prevalence hev infection swine
workers general population, including local residents, blood donors and
non-swine workers. searches three databases (pubmed ovid in
english, cnki chinese) study selection, total 32 studies
from 16 countries (from 1999 2018) included meta-analysis. 
random-effect model employed study; 2 statistic assessed
heterogeneity, egger's test detected publication bias. comparative
prevalence anti-hev igg pooled studies. compared general
population, prevalence ratio (pr) swine workers estimated 1.52 
(95% ci 1.38-1.76) 2 71%. publication bias detected
(p = 0.40). subgroup analysis indicated increased prevalence of
anti-hev igg swine workers asia (pr = 1.49, 95% ci: 1.35-1.64), in
europe (pr = 1.93, 95% ci: 1.49-2.50) five swine-related occupations, 
including swine farmers, butchers, meat processors, pork retailers and
veterinarians (pr ranged 1.19 1.75). summary, swine workers a
relatively higher prevalence past hev infection, finding true
across swine-related occupations, confirms zoonotic transmission between
swine swine workers.
