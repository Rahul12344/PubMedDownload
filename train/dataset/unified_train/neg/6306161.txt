about 200 antigenically related adenoviruses isolated cases of
infantile diarrhoea netherlands north-west germany. viruses were
fastidious failed replicate serially human diploid fibroblasts in
primary human embryonic kidney cells. number strains established in
hela, hep-2, graham (293), cynomolgus monkey kidney, chang conjunctival
cells. viruses mammalian adenoviruses usual criteria. no
relationship 39 known human adenovirus species found, either by
neutralization tests haemagglutination inhibition tests. neutralization
tests showed two distinct variants, represented strains tak dugan. the
variants identical haemagglutination inhibition tests. dna restriction
enzyme analysis showed tak dugan considerably different genomes,
indicating variants classified different species (wadell 
et al, 1983). proposed variants called mastadenovirus h 
40 (with reference strains dugan hovi x) mastadenovirus h 41 (with
reference strain tak). neutralization haemagglutination inhibition tests
demonstrated viruses glasgow helsinki (hovi x) described by
johansson et al [1980] kidd madeley [1981] belong two
adenovirus species.
