adult cell leukemia/lymphoma (atll) one peripheral cell malignant
neoplasms strongly associated human cell leukemia virus type-i (htlv-i).
although viral transactivating protein tax proposed play a
critical role leukemogeneis shown transforming activity various
experimental systems, additional cellular events required development
of atll. one genetic events atll inactivation tumor suppressor
genes. among many candidates tumor suppressor genes, main genetic events 
have reported center around cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors
((cdkis) p15ink4a, p16ink4b, p18ink4c, p19ink4d, p21waf1, p27kip1, p57kip2), 
p53 rb genes; play major regulatory role g1 s
transition cell cycle. acute/lymphomatous atll frequent alterations of
p15 (20%) p16 (28-67%), chronic/smoldering atll fewer abnormalities
of p15 (0-13%) p16 (5-26%). changes deletion genes; 
fewer samples mutations. atll patients deleted p15 and/or p16 genes
have significantly shorter survival individuals genes
preserved. although genetic alterations p18, p19, p21, p27 rarely been
reported, inactivation genes may contribute development atll
because low expression levels genes seem mark atll. p53 gene is
mutated 10-50% acute/lymphomatous atll. functional impairment p53
protein, even gene wild-type sequences, suggested htlv-i
infected cells. genetic events mainly found in
acute/lymphomatous atll, suggesting alterations genes may be
associated transformation aggressive phenotype. rb tumor
suppressor gene infrequently structurally altered, one half atll cases 
have lost expression key protein. notably, alterations one the
cdkis, p53 rb genes appear obviate need inactivation other
genes pathway. novel tumor suppressor gene chromosome 6q may
also critical role pathogenesis atll. taken together, tumor
suppressor genes frequently altered acute/lymphomatous atll their
alteration probably driving force fueling transition from
chronic/smoldering acute/lymphomatous atll.
