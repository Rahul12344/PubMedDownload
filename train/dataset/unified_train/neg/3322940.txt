we describe three strains transgenic mice derived embryo microinjection 
dna consisting long terminal repeat (ltr) moloney murine sarcoma virus
(mo-msv) linked murine c-mos coding sequences. southern analysis the
genomic dna strains suggested case transgene had
integrated different chromosomal location. strains characterized by
dominant changes secondary lens fiber differentiation. shortly birth,
insufficient elongation differentiating lens fibers lack basement
membrane secretion resulted breakdown posterior lens capsule. this, 
turn led posterior protrusion swelling lens tissue. course of
the first 3 weeks birth, globular lens cells began fill entire
anterior posterior chambers eye. concomitantly, massive
overexpression c-mos rna lens. whereas construct high
transforming activity transfected nih-3t3 cells, hyperplasia or
neoplasia observed affected lenses. increased expression of
c-mos rna confined lens eye detected of
several tissues tested.
