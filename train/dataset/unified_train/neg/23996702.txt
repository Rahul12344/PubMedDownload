recently, showed increased slpi levels prevent human papillomavirus (hpv)
infections metastasis smoking-induced, non-hpv-driven head neck
squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc). here, focus role slpi in
non-hpv-driven hnscc, investigating tumor tissue non-neoplastic mucosa from
the patients non-hnscc patients. gene protein expression of
slpi gene expression annexin 2 (a slpi receptor), nicotine receptor
(α7achr) arylhydrocarbon receptor (ahr) analyzed hnscc patients (20
smokers; 16 nonsmokers). slpi-results correlated patients' hpv
status. non-neoplastic mucosa hnscc patients normal mucosa non-hnscc 
individuals (18 smokers; 20 nonsmokers) analyzed parameters.
tissue inferior turbinate (n = 10) incubated nicotine for
analysis genes. slpi gene expression tumor tissue 109.26 ±
23.08 times higher smokers versus nonsmokers. non-neoplastic mucosa smokers
showed also higher slpi gene expression (10.49 ± 1.89-fold non-hnscc; 18.02 ±
3.93-fold hnscc patients). annexin 2 gene expression also increased in
smokers. slpi data corroborated immunohistochemistry. nicotine
dependent correlation slpi annexin 2 gene expression (r(2) = 0.15, p 
< 0.001) shown ex vivo. nicotine smoking increased α7achr ahr gene
expression. five patients, showing no/low slpi expression, hpv16-positive. a
significant correlation smoking slpi expression tumors 
knowledge first time mucosa hnscc non-hnscc patients was
established. together finding patients hpv infection
showed no/low slpi expression, data support intriguing hypothesis 
smoking induced upregulated slpi prevents hpv infections.
