background: ebola virus disease (evd) highly infectious disease has
produced 25,000 cases past 50 years. many past outbreaks
resulted relatively cases, 2014 outbreak west africa most
deadly occurrence evd date, producing 15,000 confirmed cases.
objective: study, investigated population level predictors evd risk
at regional level sierra leone, liberia, guinea.
methods: spatial descriptive analyses conducted assess distribution
of evd cases. choropleth maps showing spatial distribution evd risk across
the study area generated arcgis. poisson negative binomial models
were used investigate population regional predictors evd risk.
results: results indicated risk evd significantly lower areas 
with higher proportions of: (a) population living urban areas, (b)
households low quality toilets, (c) married men working blue 
collar jobs. however, risk evd significantly higher areas high
mean years education.
conclusions: identified significant predictors high risk associated
with areas higher levels urbanization. may due higher
population densities urban centers hence higher potential of
infectious contact. however, need better understand role of
urbanization individual contact structure ebola outbreak. discuss
shortcomings available data emphasize need consider spatial scale
in future data collection epidemiological studies.
