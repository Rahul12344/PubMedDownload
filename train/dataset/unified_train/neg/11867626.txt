we developed vitro cleaving assay thymidylate synthase (td) group i
intron observed off-rate substrate faster cleavage.
from sequence stems p1 p2 vary 4 8 6 10 base
pairs, respectively, folding long p1 stem competition with
folding long p2 stem. shorter substrates, cannot compete the
formation extended p2, result faster cleavage, suggesting binding
of substrate indeed interferes folding stem p2. vivo splicing
analyses mutants containing alterations stems p1 p2 indicate the
wild-type exon sequence p1 suboptimal splicing. furthermore, folding of
p1 vivo competition alternative cryptic p1 stem resulting in
mis-splicing. translation promotes splicing correct 5' splice site,
whereas absence translation, mis-splicing favored. combination
of vitro vivo assays clearly displays folding problems for
correct splice site selection group intron.
