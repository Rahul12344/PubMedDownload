motivation: recent advances confocal microscopy allowed scientists to
assess expression, extent, interaction/colocalization of
multiple molecules within cells tissues. instances, accurately
quantifying colocalization two proteins may critical. 
require acquisition multiple z plane images (z stacks) throughout a
specimen and, such, report successful development freeware,
open-source image analysis tool, imajin_coloc, developed perl (v. 5.8, build
806), using perlmagick libraries (imagemagick). using pixel-by-pixel
analysis algorithm, imajin_coloc analyze images antigen expression (any
number colors) measure possible combinations colocalization for
up three colors analyzing z stack gallery acquired sample. the
simultaneous (i.e. single pass) analysis three-color colocalization, 
batch analysis capabilities distinctive features program.
results: control image, containing known individual colocalized pixel
counts, used validate accuracy imajin_coloc. validation,
pixel counts colocalization values control image compared to
those obtained software packaged zeiss laser-scanning
microscope (lsm aim, version 3.2). values programs found be
identical. demonstrate applicability program addressing novel
biological questions, examined role neurons eliciting immune
reaction response viral infection. specifically, successfully examined
expression chemokine rantes measles virus (mv) infected hippocampal
neurons quantified changes rantes production throughout disease
period. resultant quantitative data also evaluated visually, using gif
image created analysis.
availability: perl (activeperl, version 5.8) available activestate.com; the
perlmagick libraries available imagemagick.org, imajin_coloc, the
