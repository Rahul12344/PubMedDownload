the interferon-alpha -beta (ifn-alpha/beta) producing ability two
murine dendritic cell (dc) lines d2sc/1 fsdc studied. d2sc/1 cells
produced ifn-alpha -beta stimulated herpes simplex virus (hsv),
sendai virus (sv) bacteria escherichia coli staphylococcus aureus
cowan i. precultivating (priming) d2sc/1 cells recombinant ifn-beta a
combination ifn-beta granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
increased production ifn-alpha/beta induced hsv bacteria, by
sv. also, kinetics ifn-alpha/beta responses different sv compared
to hsv bacteria, suggesting different induction mechanisms. fsdc
cells differed d2sc/1 cells mainly predominantly ifn-beta was
produced, little ifn-alpha/beta production induced the
bacteria, ifn-alpha/beta responses efficiently primed by
ifn-gamma. priming dc lines tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-10
(il-10) il-4 affect ifn-alpha/beta response induced hsv. the
results show two dc lines provide convenient tool study the
induction control ifn-alpha/beta response, well the
immunoregulatory role ifn-alpha/beta produced dc.
