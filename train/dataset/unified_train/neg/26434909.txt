background: high risk human papillomaviruses (hpvs) leading cause of
cervical cancer (cc) pap smear screening successful in
preventing cc tunisia. hpv vaccination targets hpv16 18 offers new 
efficient prevention tool. identification hpv types cc thus essential to
determine impact hpv vaccine implementation. aim study to
provide specific data tunisia.
materials methods: total 89 histological confirmed paraffin embedded
samples isolated patients cc diagnosed 2001 2011 were
collected five medical centres northern southern tunisia. hpv dna
was detected using nested pcr (my09/my11-gp5+/gp6+) genotyping assessed
using reverse blot line hybridisation assay enables detection 32
hpv types.
results: hpv dna detected samples. twelve high risk types were
detected; hpv16 and/or 18 predominant, accounting together 92.1% 
the cc cases (hpv16: 83.1%). single infections accounted 48.8% cases
and mostly linked hpv 16 (32.6%) less frequently hpv 18 (2.4%).
the high risk hpv single infections linked hpv 35 (4.6%), 45
(4.6%), 58 (2.3%) 59 (2.3%). multiple infections mixing 2 4
genotypes predominately featrued hpv16 and/or 18 hpv 35 45 (96.6 %) 
less frequently hpv 59, 40, 66, 73 58. statistically
significant variation relative distribution hpv types age.
conclusions: results strongly indicate prophylactic hpv vaccines can
have major impact preventing cc tunisia.
