the efficacy gene therapy treatment inherited immunodeficiency 
been highlighted recent clinical trials, although cases complicated by
insertional mutagenesis silencing vector genomes methylation. to
minimize effects, evaluated use regulatory elements that
confer reliability gene expression, also lack potent indiscriminate
enhancer activity. vav1 proximal promoter particularly attractive 
regard may useful situations high-level complex regulation 
gene expression necessary. x-linked severe combined immunodeficiency
(scid-x1) good candidate approach, particularly may 
additional disease-related intrinsic risks leukemogenesis, safety is
therefore paramount concern. tested whether lentiviral vectors
expressing common cytokine receptor gamma chain control the
proximal vav1 gene promoter effective correction signaling defects and
the disease phenotype. despite low-level gene expression, observed
near-complete restoration cytokine-mediated stat5 phosphorylation model
cell line. furthermore, low vector copy number, highly effective t- and
b-lymphocyte reconstitution achieved vivo murine model scid-x1, in
both primary secondary graft recipients. vector configuration deserves
further evaluation consideration future clinical trials.
