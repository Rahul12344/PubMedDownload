involvement retinoblastoma susceptibility (rb-1), p16ink4, p53 and
telomerase genes immortalisation examined determining status in
15 human cell lines representing four immortalisation complementation groups. 
abnormalities rb-1, p53 p16ink4 detected cell lines containing dna
tumour virus proteins known bind protein products rb-1 p53
genes. contrast, cell lines four groups either
rb-1 mutant p16ink4 protein undetectable cell lines
containing p53 mutations three groups. telomerase activity detected
in 12/15 lines, including virally immortalised lines some
lines group. since none changes correlated with
complementation group, genetic changes must required for
immortalisation.
