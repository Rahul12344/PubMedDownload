the native lactococcal plasmid, pkr223, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis
biovar diacetylactis kr2 encodes two distinct bacteriophage-resistant mechanisms,
the llakr2i restriction modification (r/m) system abortive infection 
(abi) mechanism, abir, impedes bacteriophage dna replication. study
completed characterization abir, revealing first abi system
to encoded three genes, abira, abirb, abirc, arranged operon 
that requires methylase gene llakr2i r/m system. analysis of
deletion insertion clones demonstrated abir operon toxic l.
lactis without presence llakr2i methylase, required to
protect l. lactis abir toxicity. novelty abir system resides in
its original gene organization unusual protective role llakr2i
methylase. interestingly, abir genetic determinants flanked two is982 
elements generating likely transposable abir composite. observation not
only substantiated novel function llakr2i methylase abir system
but also illustrated evolution llakr2i methylase toward new and
separate cellular function. unique structure llakr2i r/m system 
and abir system may contributed evolution llakr2i
methylase toward novel role comparable cell cycle-regulated
methylases include dam ccrm methylases. new role llakr2i
methylase offers unique snapshot evolution cell cycle-regulated
methylases existing r/m system.
