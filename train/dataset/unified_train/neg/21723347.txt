epstein-barr virus (ebv) associated subset gastric carcinoma which
was defined ebv-associated gastric carcinoma (ebvagc). proportion of
ebvagc gastric remnant carcinoma (grc) apparently higher in
conventional gastric carcinoma (cgc) occurs intact stomach. to
clarify possible mechanisms, 26 grc cases guangzhou investigated
for presence ebv, ebv genome polymorphisms ebvagc grc were
analyzed. besides, clinicopathologic characteristics, ebv latency pattern 
ebvagc grc also investigated. eight (30.8%) 26 cases were
identified ebvagcs. type strain, prototype f, type i, mut-w1/i1, xhoi- and
del-lmp1 variants predominant among ebvagc patients, accounting 7
(87.5%), 7 (87.5%), 8 (100%), 6 (75%), 5 (62.5%) 8 (100%) cases,
respectively. ebvagc cases male histology diffuse-type
carcinoma. tumor cells expressed ebna1 (87.5%) lmp2a (62.5%) not
lmp1, ebna2 zebra. thus, ebv latency pattern latency i. were
similar cgc, except significantly higher proportion ebvagc
in grc cgc, suggesting aggressive ebv variant in
ebvagc grc, injuries gastric mucosa and/or changes the
microenvironment within remnant stomach may involved development of
ebvagc grc. this, knowledge, first study concerning the
ebv genome polymorphisms ebvagc grc world.
