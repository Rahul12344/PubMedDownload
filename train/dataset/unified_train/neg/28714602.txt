heat shock proteins (hsp) essential molecular chaperones play important 
roles stress stimulation insects. bemisia tabaci, phloem feeder and
invasive species, cause extensive crop damage direct feeding and
transmission plant viruses. employed comprehensive genomics approaches
to identity hsp superfamily members middle east asia minor 1 whitefly
genome. total, identified 26 hsp genes, including three hsp90, 17 hsp70,
one hsp60 five shsp (small heat shock protein) genes. hsp gene
superfamily whitefly expanded compared five insects surveyed
here. gene structures among families relatively conserved.
meanwhile, motif compositions secondary structures bthsp proteins were
predicted. addition, quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis showed
that expression patterns bthsp gene superfamily diverse across
different tissues whiteflies. hsp genes induced repressed by
thermal stress (40°c) cold treatment (4°c) whitefly. silencing the
expression bthsp70-6 significantly decreased survival rate whitefly
under 45°c. results showed hsps conferred thermo-tolerance or
cold-tolerance whiteflies protect affected detrimental
temperature conditions. observations highlighted molecular evolutionary
properties response mechanism temperature assaults hsp genes in
whitefly.
