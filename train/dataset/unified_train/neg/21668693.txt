background: augment established influenza surveillance systems united
states, centers disease control prevention council state
and territorial epidemiologists implemented aggregate hospitalization and
death reporting activity (ahdra) august 2009. ahdra designed meet
increased demands timely detailed information describing illness severity
during 2009 h1n1 influenza (ph1n1) pandemic response.
objectives: describe implementation ahdra provide preliminary
results new surveillance activity.
methods: 50 us states asked report influenza-associated
hospitalizations deaths ahdra week using either a
laboratory-confirmed syndromic surveillance definition. aggregate counts 
used calculate age-specific weekly cumulative rates per 100,000, and
laboratory-confirmed reports used estimate age distribution ph1n1 
influenza-associated hospitalizations deaths.
results: august 30, 2009, april 6, 2010, ahdra identified 41,689
laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations 2096
laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated deaths. aggregate hospitalization and
death reporting activity rates peaked earlier hospitalization death
rates seen previous influenza seasons surveillance systems, the
age distribution cases revealed tendency hospitalizations deaths 
occur persons <65 years age.
conclusions: aggregate hospitalization death reporting activity
laboratory-confirmed reports provided important information 2009
pandemic response. aggregate hospitalization death reporting activity
syndromic reports marked low representativeness specificity 
therefore less useful. ahdra implemented quickly may useful
surveillance system monitor severe illness future influenza pandemics.
