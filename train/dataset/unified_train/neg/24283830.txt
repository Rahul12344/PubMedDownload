there evidence life expectancy (le) individuals infected 
human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) increased since introduction of
combination antiretroviral therapy (cart). however, mortality rates recent
years hiv-positive individuals appear remained higher would be
expected based rates seen general population. low cd4 count, whether 
due late hiv diagnosis, late initiation cart, incomplete adherence to
cart, remains dominant predictor le, thus individual's disease
stage initiation cart (or thereafter) certainly contributes higher
mortality rates. however, individuals hiv also tend exhibit lifestyles
and behaviors place increased risk mortality, particularly from
non-aids causes. thus, although mortality rates among hiv population may
indeed remain slightly higher seen general population, may
be higher seen appropriately matched control group. thus,
further improvements le may possible other
underlying issues (for example, modification lifestyle behavioral factors) 
are tackled.
