object: achieving distribution gene-carrying vectors major barrier the
clinical application gene therapy. blood-brain barrier, the
distribution genetic vectors central nervous system (cns) even 
challenging delivery tissues. direct intraparenchymal
microinfusion, minimally invasive technique, uses bulk flow (convection) to
distribute suspensions macromolecules widely extracellular space
(convection-enhanced delivery [ced]). although acute injection solid tissue 
is often used delivery oligonucleotides, viruses, liposomes, there
is preliminary evidence certain large particles spread 
the interstitial space brain use convection, use ced 
distribution viruses brain systematically examined. that
is goal study.
methods: investigators used rodent model examine influence size,
osmolarity buffering solutions, surface coating volumetric
distribution virus-sized nanoparticles viruses (adeno-associated viruses
and adenoviruses) gray matter brain. results demonstrate that
channels extracellular space gray matter brain large enough 
to accommodate virus-sized particles surface characteristics are
critical determinants distribution viruses brain convection.
conclusions: results indicate convective distribution used to
distribute therapeutic viral vectors cns.
