the prognosis dengue remains challenge early, objective triage of
patients dengue fever differing severity. circulating immuno-modulating
proteins brought new possibilities prognostic markers severe dengue
(sd). systematic review devoted understanding potential utility of
blood-based cytokines chemokines prognostication markers sd based on
the current literature. pubmed embase searched. 794 candidate
articles, 685 abstracts screened exclusion/inclusion criteria
and 25 (3.6 %) studies met quality assessments. total 18 studies were
retrospective observational 2 prospective cohort studies. elevated
il-10, day 7 fever onset, stood candidate prognostic marker for
sd using 1997 2009 world health organization (who) case definitions. ifnγ
was another potential prognostic marker sd (1997 case definition), its
levels varied studies. significant heterogeneity methodologies and
patient cohorts prevent ready application il-10 ifnγ prognostic markers
to dengue populations. results suggest current non-randomized 
studies delivering inconsistent messages higher-quality studies, with
consistent methodologies validation independent patient cohorts, are
needed delineate confounding variables. major gaps identified full
accounting transparency sampling days, dengue virus type, infection status
and age group.
