vasoactive intestinal peptide (vip) neuropeptide hormone suppresses
th1-mediated cellular immunity. previously reported vip-knockout (vip-ko)
mice enhanced cellular immune responses increased survival following
murine cytomegalovirus (mcmv) infection c57bl/6 mice. study, tested
whether treatment vip receptor antagonistic peptide protects c57bl/6 and
balb/c mice mcmv-infection. one week daily subcutaneous injections of
viphyb non-toxic alter frequencies immune cell subsets in
non-infected mice. viphyb administration mcmv-infected c57bl/6 balb/c mice
markedly enhanced survival, viral clearance, reduced liver lung pathology
compared saline-treated controls. numbers effector/memory cd8+
t-cells mature nk cells increased viphyb-treated mice compared with
pbs-treated groups. pharmacological blockade vip-receptor binding genetic
blockade vip-signaling prevented up-regulation pd-l1 pd-1
expression dc activated cd8+ t-cells, respectively, mcmv-infected mice,
and enhanced cd80, cd86, mhc-ii expression conventional plasmacytoid
dc. viphyb-treatment increased type-i ifn synthesis, numbers ifn-γ- and
tnf-α-expressing nk cells t-cells, numbers mcmv-m45
epitope-peptide-mhc-i tetramer cd8+ t-cells following mcmv infection.
vip-treatment lowered percentage treg cells spleens compared with
pbs-treated wt mice following mcmv infection, significantly decreasing
levels serum vegf induced mcmv-infection. mice treated groups
exhibited similar levels anti-mcmv antibody titers. short-term administration 
of vip-receptor antagonist represents novel approach enhance innate and
adaptive cellular immunity murine model cmv infection.
