hantavirus, genus family bunyaviridae, comprised least four
serologically distinct types: hantaan, seoul, puumala prospect hill. the
present communication reports use polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for
typing 27 independently isolated hantaviruses 5 different continents. total 
cellular rna extracted virus-infected vero e6 cell monolayers the
acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method. utilized 5 different
sets oligonucleotide primers ranging 18 22 nucleotides length; one 
set specific conserved region genomic segment used as
genus-specific primers, 4 sets primers designed unique
sequences genomic segment primer set specific only
one serological type hantavirus. pcr products analyzed restriction
endonuclease digestion confirmation. typed 10, 12, 3 1
isolates hantaan, seoul, puumala prospect hill respectively. results
of pcr 100% agreeable serological typing, thus, pcr 
used adjunct test serological method(s) independent test for
diagnosis typing new isolates hantaviruses.
