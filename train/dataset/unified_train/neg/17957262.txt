introduction: hiv-1 often acquired presence pre-existing
co-infections, herpes simplex virus 2 (hsv-2). examined impact 
hsv-2 status time hiv-1 acquisition impact subsequent
clinical course, total cd4+ cell phenotypes.
methods: assessed relationship hsv-1/hsv-2 co-infection status cd4+ 
t cell counts hiv-1 rna levels time prior cohort 186 treatment
naïve adults identified early hiv-1 infection. assessed activation 
and differentiation state total cd4+ cells study entry hsv-2 status.
results: 186 recently hiv-1 infected persons, 101 (54%) sero-positive for
hsv-2. difference initial cd8+ cell count, differences
between groups age, gender, race based hsv-2 status. persons with
hiv-1/hsv-2 co-infection sustained higher cd4+ cell counts time (+69
cells/ul greater (sd = 33.7, p = 0.04) hiv-1 infection alone
(figure 1), adjustment hiv-1 rna levels (-57 cells per 1 log(10) higher
hiv-1 rna, p<0.0001). observe relationship hsv-2 infection
status plasma hiv-1 rna levels time. hsv-2 acquisition hiv-1
acquisition impact cd4+ count viral load. detect
differences cd4+ cell activation differentiation state hsv-2+ status.
discussion: observed effect hsv-2 status viral load. however, 
observe treatment naïve, recently hiv-1 infected adults co-infected with
hsv-2+ time hiv-1 acquisition higher cd4+ cell counts time. 
if verified cohorts, result poses striking paradox, its
public health implications immediately clear.
