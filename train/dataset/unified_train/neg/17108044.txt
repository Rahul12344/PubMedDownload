tumor necrosis factor (tnf) multifunctional cytokine role in
induction regulation host innate adaptive immune responses. the
importance tnf antiviral mechanisms reflected diverse strategies
adopted different viruses, particularly members herpesvirus family, 
block tnf responses. tnf binds signals two receptors, tnfrsf1a (tnf
receptor 1 [tnfr1], p55) tnfrsf1b (tnfr2, p75). report that
herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) infection tnf-/- mice resistant c57bl/6 
genetic background results significantly increased susceptibility (p < 0.0001,
log rank test) fatal hsv encephalitis (hse) prolonged persistence of
elevated levels virus neural tissues. contrast, although virus titers in
neural tissues p55-/- n13 mice elevated levels comparable 
found tnf-/- mice, p55-/- n13 mice resistant control
c57bl/6 mice (p > 0.05). incidence fatal hse significantly increased
by vivo neutralization tnf using soluble tnfr1 (stnfr1) depletion of
macrophages c57bl/6 mice (p = 0.0038 p = 0.0071, respectively).
strikingly, vivo neutralization tnf hsv-1-infected p55-/- p75-/- mice by
use three independent approaches (treatment soluble p55 receptor,
anti-tnf monoclonal antibody, vivo small interfering rna tnf)
resulted significantly increased mortality rates (p = 0.005), comparable in
magnitude c57bl/6 mice treated stnfr1 (p = 0.0018). overall,
these results indicate tnf required resistance fatal hse,
both p55 p75 receptors dispensable. precisely tnf mediates protection
against hsv-1 mortality p55-/- p75-/- mice remains determined.
