wnt-10b expressed formation mammary rudiment mouse
embryos expression continues puberty mammary ductal
pattern established control ovarian steroids. recently, viral
activation wnt-10b locus linked overexpression mammary tumor
formation, suggesting role wnt-10b patterning growth-regulation of
the mammary gland. test notion, created lines transgenic mice 
express elevated levels wnt-10b control mmtv
promoter/enhancer. overexpression gene resulted profound developmental
alterations mammary gland, including expanded glandular development and
the precocious appearance alveoli virgin females. moreover, transgenic male
mice also exhibited dramatic mammary development involving highly branched
mammary ducts gynecomastia. aberrant expression wnt-10b mammary
rudiments males evidently bypasses normal requirement ovarian hormonal
control stimulating mammary ductal growth repressive effects of
androgens. addition developmental effects, transgenic mice both
sexes highly susceptible development mammary adenocarcinomas. such
tumors arose solitary manner indicating wnt-10b proto-oncogene
which provides necessary, insufficient signal oncogenesis. relevant 
this, evidence amplified expression fgf mrnas tumors 
though fgf's class genes often implicated collaborators in
wnt-mediated tumor formation. indeed, co-expression mmtv-wnt-10b and
mmtv-fgf-3/int-2 resulted sterile offspring highly disorganized mammary
epithelium, demonstrating potent interaction respective
developmental pathways. results suggest wnt-10b, wnt genes
expressed early mammary development, play role regulating sexual
dimorphism show potent transforming activity overexpressed.
