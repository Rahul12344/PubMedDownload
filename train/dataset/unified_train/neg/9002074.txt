the causative agent murine aids (maids) defective murine leukemia virus
bm5d, requires replication-competent ecotropic mulv (bm5e) helper virus.
we developed competitive quantitative pcr method including specific internal
standards quantify expression bm5d spleen infected mice and
to characterize bm5d expression kinetics following experimental infection.
specimen rna reverse-transcribed co-amplified competitive template
containing gag sequence specific bm5d discriminated that
corresponding wild-type cdna presence unique restriction site,
bg/ii. pcr products quantified means densitometric analysis after
ethidium bromide staining gels. standardise rna extraction reverse 
transcription steps, amount defective-virus mrna compared a
constant copy number murine beta actin mrna. lp-bm5 production measured in
the spleen infected mice. defective gag mrna production compared that
of ecotropic virus. mrna level defective virus titre of
replicative virus increased duration infection, amount of
defective virus mrna correlated titre replicating virus.
