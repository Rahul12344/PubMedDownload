the proteolytic processing non-structural polyprotein segment the
cytoplasmic domain ns2a c terminus ns5 murray valley encephalitis
(mve) virus examined, expressed cdna via vaccinia virus
recombinant, transiently transfected cos cells, synthesized cell-free
translation. cleavages mediated virus-encoded proteinase domain ns3 
the junctions ns2a-2b, ns2b-3 ns4b-5 catalysed efficiently. however, 
the cleavage ns3-4a junction, also mediated ns3 proteinase, was
greatly delayed. little ns3 found, 85k precursor molecule
accumulated; identified ns3-4a. termination codons introduced by
site-directed mutagenesis junctions ns3-4a, ns4a-4b ns4b-5
genes generate c-terminal truncations mve virus polyprotein segment. in
expression studies constructs predicted ns3-mediated proteolytic
cleavages catalysed, except ns3-4a junction. in
co-infections co-transfections constructs encoding mve virus
nonstructural polyprotein region truncated c termini ns3 ns4a,
efficient processing ns3-4a site induced. thus appears mve
virus polyprotein cleaved inefficiently cis ns3-4a junction, whereas
the site processed efficiently trans mature ns3. ns3-4a precursor is
also seen flavivirus-infected cells. function remains determined,
but could play role replication flavivirus, view the
importance polyprotein processing regulation gene expression of
positive-stranded rna viruses, modulation processing ns3-4a site by
ns3 ns3-containing precursors described present study the
importance ns3 integral part viral polymerase complex.
