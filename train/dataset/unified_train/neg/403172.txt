selective inhibition bacillus subtilis sporulation acridine orange and
promethazine.

burke wf jr, spizizen j.

two structurally similar compounds found inhibit sporulation bacillus 
subtilis 168. dye, acridine orange, antischizophrenic drug,
promethazine, blocked spore formation concentrations subinhibitory to
vegetative growth, allowing synthesis serine protease, antibiotic, and
certain catabolite-repressed enzymes. sporulation process sensitive to
promethazine t2, whereas acridine orange inhibitory t4. the
drug-treated cells able support replication phages phie phi29,
although lytic cycles altered slightly. selective inhibition of
sporulation compounds may related affinity some
sporulation-specific genes intercalating compounds.
