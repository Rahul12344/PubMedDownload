the diagnosis malignant tumors pregnancy uncommon; incidence
is one per six thousand pregnancies. however, diagnosis malignant
lymphoma-especially t-cell lymphoma-during pregnancy extremely rare. thus, the
early detection management t-cell lymphoma necessitates difficult
decision-making. 30-year-old woman developed consciousness disturbance on
postpartum day three. brain mri showed multiple edematous lesions both
hemispheres, vasculitis encephalitis initially suspected, diagnostic
therapy initiated administration steroids. one month later, the
patient suddenly developed subarachnoid hemorrhage followed acute
hydrocephalus. emergent ventricular drainage lesion biopsy were
simultaneously performed. based findings, patient diagnosed with
peripheral t-cell lymphoma otherwise specified(ptcl-nos). laboratory findings
indicated epstein-barr virus(ebv)infection. moreover, diagnosis was
supported breast bone marrow biopsies. thus, brain lesions were
presumed metastatic nature. prognosis ptcl-nos severely poor
in pregnant women diagnosis delayed owing limitations radiological
examinations symptoms confused diseases or
hyperemesis gravidarum. additionally, alteration immunotolerance in
association pregnancy ebv infection might influenced aggressive
features case. pregnant woman presents neurological symptoms,
malignant lymphoma considered making differential diagnosis.
