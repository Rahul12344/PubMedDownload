with view deliver anti-hiv nucleoside nucleoside-monophosphate (mp)
analogues specifically hiv-infected cells, synthesized series ester 
and phosphoramidate peptide conjugates zidovudine (azt) azt-mp,
respectively, wherein peptide sequences derive hiv-protease (pr)
hydrolysable substrate. vitro stability respect hydrolysis,
anti-hiv activity cytotoxicity, ability inhibit hiv-pr activity
were investigated. concerning ester azt-peptide conjugates, antiviral
activity level thymidine kinase-expressing (tk+) cem-ss mt-4 cells 
most cases closely correlated hydrolysis rate: faster the
hydrolysis, closer anti-hiv activity azt. none a
hiv-pr substrate, indicating antiviral activity related to
their intracellular hydrolysis enzyme. none inhibited hiv in
tk-deficient (tk-) cem cells, demonstrating probably act prodrugs of
azt. phosphoramidate peptide conjugates azt-mp rapidly
degraded physiological buffer several metabolites including azt. 
anti-hiv activity tk+ cem-ss mt-4 cells much lower azt,
indicating low amounts azt azt-mp released cells during
incubation. antiviral activities measured tk- cem cells some
phosphoramidates suggest low amounts azt-mp could released
intracellularly. however, azt-mp release initiated hiv-pr
hydrolysis, evidence peptide cleavage obtained hplc analysis 
one representative compound incubation hiv-pr.
