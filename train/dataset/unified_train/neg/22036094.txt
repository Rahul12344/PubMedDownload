recent studies natural history asthma shifted attention toward
viral respiratory tract illness early life major risk factor associated
with development persistent forms disease. although early 
aeroallergen sensitization strongly associated chronic asthma, several
trials single-aeroallergen exposure pregnancy early childhood was
successfully accomplished compared sham avoidance failed show
any decrease asthma incidence. new evidence suggests complex interactions
occur viral infection aeroallergen sensitization genetically
susceptible subjects trigger immune responses airway changes that
are characteristic persistent asthma. finding exposure bacterial
products among children raised farms associated diminished asthma
prevalence school years replicated, experimental
studies suggested effects mediated activation of
regulatory cells airway. thus plausible hypothesize that
primary prevention asthma could attained surrogate therapeutic
interventions activate similar mechanisms young children high risk for
asthma.
