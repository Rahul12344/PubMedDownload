the persistence hiv-1 virally suppressed infected individuals highly
active antiretroviral therapy (haart) remains major therapeutic problem. the
use cytokines envisioned additional therapeutic strategy to
stimulate latent proviruses individuals. immune activation therapy using
il-2 shown promise. present study, found il-7 was
significantly effective enhancing hiv-1 proviral reactivation either
il-2 alone il-2 combined phytohemagglutinin (pha) cd8-depleted pbmcs. 
il-7 also showed positive trend inducing proviral reactivation resting
cd4(+) lymphocytes hiv-1-infected patients suppressive haart. moreover,
the phylogenetic analyses viral envelope gp120 genes induced viruses
indicated distinct proviral quasispecies activated il-7, as
compared activated pha/il-2 treatment. studies thus
demonstrate different activators proviral latency may perturb and
potentially deplete selected, specific portions proviral archive in
virally suppressed individuals. known immunomodulatory effects il-7 could 
be combined ability stimulate hiv-1 replication resting cd4(+) t
lymphocytes, addition moieties, potentially deplete hiv-1
reservoirs lead rational design immune-antiretroviral approaches.
