rna recombination non-segmented rna viruses important viral evolution
and documented several virus species vitro studies. we
confirm viral rna recombination vivo using alphavirus, sav3 subtype 
salmon pancreas disease virus. virus causes pancreas disease atlantic
salmon heavy losses european salmonid aquaculture. atlantic salmon were
injected sav3 6k-gene deleted cdna plasmid, encoding non-viable variant 
of sav3, together helper cdna plasmid encoding structural proteins 6k 
only. later, sav3-specific rna detected recombination viral rna was
confirmed. virus grown plasmid-injected fish shown infect and
cause pathology salmon. subsequent cloning pcr products confirming
recombination, documented imprecise homologous recombination creating rna
deletion variants fish injected cdna plasmid, corresponding deletion
variants previously found sav3 field. first experimental 
documentation alphavirus rna recombination animal model provides new
insight production defective virus rna.
