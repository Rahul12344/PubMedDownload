equine rhinitis virus (erav) shares many features foot-and-mouth disease
virus (fmdv) classified within genus aphthovirus family
picornaviridae. erav used surrogate fmdv research not
require high-level biosecurity. contrast fmdv, uses integrins as
cellular receptors, receptor erav reported involve sugar 
moiety sialic acid. study confirmed importance sialic acid cell
entry erav reports crystal structure erav particles complexed 
the receptor analogue 3'-sialyllactose. receptor attached rim 
capsid pit adjacent major immunogenic site distinct sialic
acid binding site used related picornavirus, cardiovirus theiler's
murine encephalitis virus. structure major antigenic determinant of
the virus, previously identified antibody escape mutations, also
described ef loop vp1, forms hairpin stretching across the
capsid surface close icosahedral fivefold axis, neighbouring the
receptor-binding site, spanning two protomeric units.
