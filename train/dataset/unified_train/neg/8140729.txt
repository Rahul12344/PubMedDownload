eight day-old male female ringneck pheasants (phasianus colchicus) were
inoculated group rotavirus necropsied 4, 7, 11 days
post-inoculation. intestinal tracts examined light electron
microscopic immunohistochemical methods. 4 days post-inoculation, 2/3
(66%) inoculated birds stunted diarrhea dilated intestines.
intestinal villi shortened, many villous enterocytes partially
detached lamina propria. crypts hyperplastic, lamina
propria contained diffuse infiltrate lymphocytes, plasma cells, and
macrophages. immunoreactivity rotaviral antigen localized enterocytes
on tips villi duodenum, jejunum, proximal ileum. 7 days
post-inoculation, 3/3 (100%) inoculated birds clinical signs gross and
microscopic changes similar 4 days post-inoculation severe. 
immunoreactivity localized enterocytes scattered along sides villi,
in occasional crypt enterocytes, within macrophages villous lamina
propria. ultrastructurally, infected enterocytes contained cytoplasmic aggregates
of viroplasm multiple viral core particles. numerous mature virions (60-75
nm diameter) present within dilated components cytocavitary
network. macrophages within lamina propria contained phagocytosed remnants of
necrotic virus-infected cells. 11 days post-inoculation, birds have
gross lesions, 1/2 (50%) mild crypt hyperplasia infiltrate of
leukocytes lamina propria. occasional enterocytes along sides villi
and macrophages lamina propria immunoreactive viral
antigen.(abstract truncated 250 words)
