clinical, virological, morphological, immunofluorescence investigations 
carried 22 pigs experimentally infected two strains--a virulent one
(v) 10(-3) titer, slightly virulent one (k) 10(-7) titer--of 
virus aujeszky's disease well contact pigs. results revealed
variations clinical morphological manifestation disease

were clinical symptoms characteristic disease, morphological
changes central nervous system nonsuppurative encephalitis
type. pigs infected k strain virus showed clinical
symptoms, contact animals manifested respiratory troubles well 
as interstitial pneumonia. demonstrated strains slight
