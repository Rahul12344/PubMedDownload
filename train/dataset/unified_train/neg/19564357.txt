miv-210 prodrug 3'-fluoro-2',3'-dideoxyguanosine high oral
bioavailability humans potent activity hepatitis b virus (hbv).
woodchucks infected woodchuck hepatitis virus (whv) represent accurate
model hbv infection utilized evaluation efficacy safety
of novel anti-hbv agents. oral administration miv-210 20 60 mg/kg of
body weight/day induced rapid virological response chronically infected
woodchucks, reducing serum whv dna levels 4.75 log10 5.72 log10,
respectively, 2 weeks. progressive decline whv viremia occurred
throughout 10-week therapy, giving final reductions 7.23 log10 7.68
log10 20- 60-mg/kg/day groups, respectively. further, daily dose 
10 mg/kg decreased serum whv load 400-fold 4 weeks treatment, 
dose 5 mg/kg/day sufficient maintain antiviral effect the
following 6-week period. miv-210 20 60 mg/kg/day reduced liver whv dna 
load 200- 2,500-fold pretreatment levels and, importantly, led 2.0
log10 drop hepatic content whv covalently closed circular dna. the
treatment 60 mg/kg/day well tolerated. liver biopsy specimens obtained
after 10-week treatment 20 60 mg/kg/day 10-week
follow-up showed hepatocyte mitochondrial ultrastructures comparable those
in placebo-treated group. concluded miv-210 highly effective
against chronic whv infection. findings, together previously
demonstrated inhibitory activity miv-210 lamivudine-, adefovir-, and
entecavir-resistant hbv variants, make miv-210 highly valuable candidate for
further testing agent chronic hepatitis b.
