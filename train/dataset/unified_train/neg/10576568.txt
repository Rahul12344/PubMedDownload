the study carried evaluate efficacy foetal serology the
diagnosis neospora-associated bovine abortions. fluids 14 foetuses of
cows confirmed neosporosis (group a), seven foetuses confirmed bovine
viral diarrhoea virus (bvd infection) (group b) 11 aborted foetuses without
demonstrable infection (group c) examined. age foetuses ranged
from 4.5 months 9 months. albumin concentration (measured rocket
immunoelectrophoresis) significantly different group compared with
that groups b c, group b significantly lower than
in group c. levels total igg ranged 0.01 1.78 (mg igg) ml(-1) measured
by single radial immunodiffusion technique. measurable level total igg was
found foetuses groups b, significant difference between
levels two groups. one foetus group c detectable level of
igg. foetuses group specific igg response (titre> = 20) against
neospora caninum using ifat, positive responses ifat found
in groups b c. measurement specific igg1 igg2 iscom-elisa showed
one three false-negative results, respectively, group a. igg1 igg2
response group correlated according spearman test (r = 0.66).
increasing age foetuses correlated significantly foetal igg
concentration, specific igg igg1 + igg2. basis results
obtained, concluded ifat cut-off titre 1:20, a
specific method diagnosis neosporosis foetuses older 4.5 months.
the iscom-elisa also showed promising results method screening specific 
antibodies n. caninum foetal fluid.
