four isolates tobacco mosaic virus (tmv-potato 1 4) obtained from
potato plants (solanum tuberosum) cultivated potato plantings korea. 
isolates differentiated based biological properties, symptomatology, 
nucleotide sequence analysis coat protein (cp) gene. tmv potato isolates
caused typical symptoms 20 inoculated plant species compared type
(u1) tmv strain. four isolates produced distinctly different symptoms on
gomphrena globosa. contrast type strain tmv, infections two 
the isolates reported restricted inoculated leaves g. globosa
but moved systemically plants. addition, three additional systemic
hosts (chenopodium amaranticolor, c. quinoa, c. murale) tmv were
revealed. sequence analysis cp gene differentiated tmv-potato isolates.
the cp gene sequence exhibited significant identity (83.1 99.2%) among
tmv-potato isolates showing 88.1 99.4% identities predicted amino
acid sequences. based comparison cp gene nucleotide deduced amino
acid sequences tmv-potato isolates tmv strains, tmv-potato 1,
3, 4 closely related tmv strains u1, u2, v-fava, nc82 98.8
to 100% identity. contrast, tmv-potato 2 closely related tmv strains l,
kp, ko-tob, k1, k2 93.8 98.8% identity.
