efficient recovery high quality rna important successful rt-pcr
detection plant rna viruses. high levels polyphenols polysaccharides in
plant tissues irreversibly bind and/or co-precipitate rna, which
influences rna isolation. study, silica spin column-based rna isolation
method developed using commercially available silica columns combined with
the application tissue lysis solution, binding washing buffers 
high concentration guanidinium thiocyanate (guscn, 50% w/v), helps remove
plant proteins, polysaccharides polyphenolic compounds. method was
successfully used extract high quality rna citrus (citrus aurantifolia), 
grapevine (vitis vinifera), peach (prunus persica), pear (pyrus spp.), taro
(colocosia esculenta) tobacco (nicotiana benthamiana) samples. method was
comparable conventional ctab method rna isolation efficiency, was
more sample-adaptable cost-effective commercial kits. high quality rna
isolated using silica spin column-based method successfully used the
rt-pcr and/or multiplex rt-pcr amplification woody fruit tree viruses a
viroid. study provided useful tool detection characterization
of plant viruses.
