adenovirus vectors human gene therapy induce early host inflammatory
responses transduced tissues limit gene transfer efficiency can
result significant morbidity. present study aimed elucidate the
cellular mechanisms underlying acute inflammation induced adenovirus
vectors liver. leukocyte rolling adhesion response an
intravenously administered adenovirus vector examined intravital
microscopy mouse liver. adenovirus vectors significantly increased leukocyte
rolling adhesion postsinusoidal venules within minutes of
transduction. unlike inflammatory states liver, leukocyte
retention seen sinusoids response adenovirus vector
administration. inhibition p-selectin, alpha(4)-integrin, e-selectin was
necessary completely block leukocyte rolling subsequent adhesion. the
administration anti-alpha(4)-integrin antibody alone significantly reduced 
leukocyte adhesion. contrast, adenovirus vector-induced leukocyte adhesion was
unchanged cd18-knockout mice. depletion circulating neutrophils eliminated 
leukocyte rolling adhesion response adenovirus vector transduction in
the liver. conclusion, adenovirus vectors induce rapid neutrophil-mediated
inflammation post-sinusoidal venules selectins alpha(4)-integrin
but surprisingly cd18.
