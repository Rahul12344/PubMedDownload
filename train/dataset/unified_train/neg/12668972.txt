black race increased hepatic iron stores predict poor response interferon 
treatment chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection. tested hypothesis
that 2 observations linked investigating whether hcv-infected
african-americans increased iron stores relative uninfected persons.
using data third national health nutrition examination survey
(nhanes iii), determined risk increased iron stores, defined 
elevation serum ferritin transferrin-iron saturation (ts), in
hcv-rna-positive blacks (n = 100) nonblacks (n = 126) relative to
hcv-rna-negative blacks (n = 4,002) nonblacks (n = 10,943). hcv-positive
blacks 5.4 times (95% ci, 1.2 24) likely increased iron
stores hcv-positive nonblacks. proportion hcv-positive blacks had
increased iron stores 16.4% among abnormal liver enzymes 2.8% 
among normal liver enzymes, compared 0.6% among hcv-negative
blacks. adjustment age, alcohol intake, gender, menopausal status,
education, body mass index, poverty index, hcv-positive blacks abnormal 
liver enzymes elevated risk increased iron stores (odds ratio,
17.8; 95% ci, 5.1 63). contrast, among persons races, 
much smaller difference proportion persons increased iron stores
between hcv-positive persons (3.4%) without (1.4%) abnormal liver enzymes
and hcv-negative persons (0.9%). conclusion, greater proportion blacks
than persons races respond hcv infection increase iron
stores. finding may partly explain reduced response hcv-positive
african-americans antiviral treatment.
