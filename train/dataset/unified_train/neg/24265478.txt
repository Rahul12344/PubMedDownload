background: reports respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) developing
countries rely sentinel surveillance, population incidence is
difficult infer. used proportion rsv infections from
population-based surveillance data healthcare utilization survey to
produce estimates rsv incidence damanhour district, egypt.
methods: conducted population-based surveillance 3 hospitals (2009-2012)
and 3 outpatient clinics (2011-2012) damanhour district. nasopharyngeal and
oropharyngeal specimens hospitalized patients acute respiratory illness
and outpatients influenza-like illness tested real-time reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rsv. also conducted healthcare
utilization survey 2011-2012 determine proportion individuals who
sought care respiratory illness.
results: among 5342 hospitalized patients 771 outpatients, 12% 5% tested 
positive rsv, respectively. incidence rsv-associated hospitalization
and outpatient visits estimated 24 608 (per 100 000 person-years),
respectively. children aged <1 year experienced highest incidence of
rsv-associated hospitalizations (1745/100 000 person-years).
conclusions: study demonstrates utility combining healthcare
utilization survey population-based surveillance data estimate disease
incidence. estimating incidence outcomes rsv disease critical to
establish burden rsv egypt.
