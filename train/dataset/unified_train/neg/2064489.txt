in patients risk acquired immunodeficiency syndrome present a
mass lesion, dilemma arises whether treat empirically for
toxoplasmosis perform brain biopsy. present data define 
indications performing brain biopsy vs empiric treatment. reviewed charts 
on 59 patients acquired immunodeficiency syndrome--related disorders and
cerebral mass lesions. thirty-two patients met diagnostic criteria for
toxoplasmosis. bayesian analysis demonstrated prior probability of
toxoplasmosis increased presence contrast enhancement computed
tomographic scans (0.68) toxoplasmosis titers greater 1:64 (0.81).
features associated decreasing probabilities toxoplasmosis included the
absence contrast enhancement computed tomographic scans (0.29) and
toxoplasmosis titers less equal 1:64 (0.14). ten percent patients
had complications brain biopsy. treatment pyrimethamine sulfadiazine 
produced complications 29% serious complications 8% treated
patients. data favor empiric therapy patients typical features 
toxoplasmosis brain biopsy defined subsets patients atypical
features.
