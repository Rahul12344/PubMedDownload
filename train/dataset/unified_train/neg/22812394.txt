the successful delivery nucleic acids cells availability the
intracellular sites action remain major challenge gene therapy, because
cells resistant uptake genetic materials contain variety of
mechanisms degrade nucleic acids. develop nonviral carrier, have
recently designed series metal complexes polybenzimidazole (pbzim) that
serve dna-condensing agents. study, prepared group of
co(ii)-pbzim complexes bear variable numbers positive charges and
benzimidazole (bzim) groups. first, formation condensates varied molar 
ratios complex dna examined multiple biophysical measurements ph 
7.4. results showed size, morphology, surface charge the
condensates formed via co(ii) complex dose-dependent process controlled 
by utilization different complexes. then, imaging examination performed
with confocal fluorescence microscope indicated dna condensates
can internalized cells. luciferase activity assay showed dna
condensates formed 1:1 molar ratio favor cell transfection
because appropriate size, profile, positive surface charges. the
addition helper lipid dope enhance cellular uptake the
condensates expression transferred genes. mtt data indicated 
cytotoxicity co(ii) complexes condensates enhanced increasing
positive charges bzim groups. results revealed physical
properties, cell transfection, cytotoxicity condensates regulated 
by positive charges bzim groups metal complexes.
