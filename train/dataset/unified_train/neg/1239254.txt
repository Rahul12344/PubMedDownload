the ultrastructural changes feline embryo continuous cell line infected with
feline calicivirus multiplicity infection approximately 1 were
studied. virus found cytoplasm observed single
particles, extensive, non-regular accumulations, paracrystalline arrays,
and single multiple linear arrays associated microfbrils. mature virus
particles readily distinguished ribosomes larger
(35nm diameter) consisted central, electron-dense core 20 nm diameter
surrounded less electron-dense coat. changes ovserved infected
cells included rounding cell nucleus loss pseudopodia. there
was extensive production smooth-membrane bound vesicles cytoplasm.
virus accumulations type, especially paracrystalline arrays, were
frequently closely associated collections vesicles. cisternae
of endoplasmic reticulum space two layers nuclear 
membrane distended. feulgen staining light microscopy, well as
electron microscopy, established nuclear chromatin undergoes profound
changes consisting condensation usually single, rounded, central mass.
