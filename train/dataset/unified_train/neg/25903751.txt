objective: aim study compare efficacy cloth masks to
medical masks hospital healthcare workers (hcws). null hypothesis 
there difference medical masks cloth masks.
setting: 14 secondary-level/tertiary-level hospitals hanoi, vietnam.
participants: 1607 hospital hcws aged ≥18 years working full-time selected
high-risk wards.
intervention: hospital wards randomised to: medical masks, cloth masks 
control group (usual practice, included mask wearing). participants used
the mask every shift 4 consecutive weeks.
main outcome measure: clinical respiratory illness (cri), influenza-like illness 
(ili) laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection.
results: rates infection outcomes highest cloth mask arm, 
with rate ili statistically significantly higher cloth mask arm
(relative risk (rr)=13.00, 95% ci 1.69 100.07) compared medical mask 
arm. cloth masks also significantly higher rates ili compared the
control arm. analysis mask use showed ili (rr=6.64, 95% ci 1.45 28.65)
and laboratory-confirmed virus (rr=1.72, 95% ci 1.01 2.94) significantly 
higher cloth masks group compared medical masks group.
penetration cloth masks particles almost 97% medical masks 44%.
conclusions: study first rct cloth masks, results caution 
against use cloth masks. important finding inform
occupational health safety. moisture retention, reuse cloth masks poor
filtration may result increased risk infection. research needed 
to inform widespread use cloth masks globally. however, precautionary
measure, cloth masks recommended hcws, particularly in
high-risk situations, guidelines need updated.
