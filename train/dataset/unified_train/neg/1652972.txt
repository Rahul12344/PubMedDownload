the formation natural hybridomas course malignant
lymphoproliferative diseases first observed 1969, many times
thereafter. natural phenomenon remains experimentally unexplored even though
it exerts fundamental influence natural history outcome neoplastic 
cell proliferations. instead, hybridomas artificially constructed the
laboratory 1975 extensively studied utilized the
production highly specific monoclonal antibodies diagnosis and
treatment infectious malignant diseases. review lists examples of
natural hybridomas formed murine human neoplasms. indirect evidence
supports notion hybridomas generated african burkitt's lymphoma
(bl) form large, immunoresistant tetraploid bl cells emerging in
immunoreactive relapsed patients; hodgkin's disease (hd) form of
reed-sternberg (rs) cells. rs cells may formed retroviral antigens
expressed mononuclear hd cell attract reactive b cells, instead 
of immune attack reactive cells, fusion reactive cells takes place.
the resulting rs cells may fuse reactive cells (e.g., two
b cells, one expressing kappa, lambda light chains) other,
forming quadromas. rs cells appear multinucleated hyperploid; express
the products activated genes interdigitating dendritic cell (the
retrovirally infected mononuclear hd cell) reactive b and/or t
cells. thus, rs cells present great variety marker
expression. molecular mediators immunoglobulins released rs cells are
responsible activities proliferating polyclonal reactive cells and/or 
for depletion cells hd lesions. multinucleated giant rs cells 
anaplastic lymphomas syncytial subtype rs cells nodular sclerosing 
hd studied first retro- herpes viral antigen expressions for
fusion reactive cells rs cells.
