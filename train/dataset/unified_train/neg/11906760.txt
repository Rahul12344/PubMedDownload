intranasal (i.n.) immunization balb/c mice chimeric murine rotavirus edim
(epizootic diarrhea infant mice) vp6 attenuated e. coli heat-labile toxin 
(lt), lt(r192g), stimulated >99% protection rotavirus shedding edim
challenge. here, evaluated potential adjuvants chimeric vp6
administered two mucosal routes: i.n. oral. besides lt(r192g), the
adjuvants examined included adjumer, cpg oligodeoxynucleotides (cpg odn),
chimeric a1 subunit cholera toxin (cta1)-dd, qs-21. except qs-21
significantly (p<0.05) increased vp6-specific serum igg responses i.n.
immunization, none significantly increased responses administered 
orally. i.n. delivery chimeric vp6 alone induced rotavirus igg1 and
igg2a whose relative titers suggested skewed th2-like response. inclusion of
adjumer greatly increased th2-like responses, cpg odn shifted response 
to less th2-like response. adjuvants cta1-dd, lt(r192g), qs-21 no
significant effect ratios igg1/igg2a titers. following edim challenge of
mice immunized i.n. chimeric vp6 either lt(r192g), cta1-dd, adjumer or
cpg odn, shedding reduced >99, 95, 80, 74, respectively, relative that
found unimmunized mice (p<0.05). qs-21 induced less protection (43%, not
significant (n.s.)) immunization chimeric vp6 alone reduced shedding
by 16% (n.s.). oral immunization chimeric vp6 selected
adjuvants except qs-21 less effective i.n. immunization, with
protection levels 94 (p<0.05), 71 (p<0.05), 55, 35 28% lt(r192g),
qs-21, cpg odn, cta1-dd, adjumer, respectively, immunization with
chimeric vp6 alone gave protection. thus, different adjuvants induced
different degrees protection oral immunization generally less
effective i.n. route.
