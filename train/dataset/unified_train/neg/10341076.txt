freshly deposited third instar glossina morsitans centralis larvae infected 
with tsetse dna virus microinjection, emergence adult males were
separated females fed rabbit blood every second day 8 days. a
control group treated sterile saline handled similarly. were
dissected, comparative observations made appearance size the
accessory reproductive glands (arg) infected control males. regularly fed 
8-day-old males infected control groups mated 2-day-old normal
females obtained insectay. separation copula, females
were dissected uteri examined presence quality the
spermatophore. spermathecae also examined insemination. arg tissues 
from control virus infected regularly fed 8-day-old male flies fixed
and processed electron microscopic studies. args control flies 
found milky appearance, whereas virus-infected flies were
transparent parts. args virus-infected males significantly 
smaller diameters (f = 42.26, p < 0.0001) shorter (f = 200.4, p < 0. 0001)
than controls. virus-infected males failed form a
complete spermatophore, whereas almost controls formed complete
spermatophore observed uteri female mates (chi2 = 111.661, p <
0.0001). infected males formed partial spermatophores did
not form failed inseminate female mates. histological studies
of args revealed lesions epithelial cells characterized by
degeneration cytoplasmic organelles detachment muscle layer from
the basal plasma membrane. however, virus particles observed the
affected cells.
