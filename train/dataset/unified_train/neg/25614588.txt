ifn-induced transmembrane protein 3 (ifitm3) restriction factor blocks 
cytosolic entry numerous viruses utilize acidic endosomal entry pathways.
in humans mice, ifitm3 limits influenza-induced morbidity mortality.
although many ifitm3-sensitive viruses zoonotic, whether ifitms function as
antiviral restriction factors mammalian species humans mice 
unknown. here, ifitm3 orthologues microbat (myotis myotis) pig (sus
scrofa domesticus) identified using rapid amplification cdna ends. amino 
acid residues known important ifitm3 function conserved pig
and microbat orthologues. ectopically expressed pig microbat ifitm3
co-localized transferrin (early endosomes) cd63 (late
endosomes/multivesicular bodies). pig microbat ifitm3 restricted cell entry
mediated multiple influenza haemagglutinin subtypes lyssavirus
glycoproteins. expression pig microbat ifitm3 a549 cells reduced
influenza virus yields nucleoprotein expression. conversely, small
interfering rna knockdown ifitm3 pig nptr cells primary microbat cells 
enhanced virus replication, demonstrating genes functional in
their species origin endogenous levels. summary, showed ifitms
function potent broad-spectrum antiviral effectors two mammals - pigs and
bats - identified major reservoirs emerging viruses.
