cotton rats exposed continuous small droplet aerosols of
2[[2-[[1-(2-aminoethyl)-4-piperidinyl]amino]-4-methyl-1h-benzimidazol-1-yl]methyl
]-6-methyl-3-pyridinol (jnj 2408068) hydrochloric salt 15 min,
one day prior virus inoculation one day after, significantly protected
from pulmonary respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) infection compared control
animals similarly infected exposed aerosols placebo times. 
evidence toxicity seen animals cotton rats
administered 10 times minimum cotton rat efficacious dose (i.e. 10x0.39 mg of
active compound per kilogram body weight) four continuous days. marked
selective antiviral activity observed cotton rats mirrored seen for
these compounds cytotoxicity antiviral assays performed rsv in
vitro. plasma kinetics tissue distribution jnj 2408068 cotton rats
following inhalation determined separate experiments performed using
conditions similar utilized vivo efficacy studies. data
from experiments indicated significant levels test compound
were delivered lungs exposed animals, extrapulmonary
distribution limited.
