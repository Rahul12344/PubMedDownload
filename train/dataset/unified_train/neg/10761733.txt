puumala (puu) virus causative agent nephropathia epidemica, the
scandinavian form hemorrhagic fever renal syndrome. infection is
acquired airborne transmission puu virus rodent reservoir, the
bank vole. besides serologic data indicating virus may spread also to
heterologous rodents, little information susceptibility wild
living animals puu virus. studied occurrence antibodies puu virus
in serum samples 427 wild-living moose, 260 originated puu
virus-endemic northern central parts sweden 167 originated the
southern, nonendemic part sweden. samples 5 animals showed reactivity 
an elisa recombinant puu virus nucleocapsid protein, immunofluorescent
assay, neutralization test. 5 animals originated puu
virus-endemic northern part sweden. conclusion, 5 260 moose the
endemic region showed convincing serologic evidence past puu virus infection. 
the seroprevalence low, suggesting moose subjected endstage
infection rather part enzootic transmission cycle.
