virus infection elicits robust innate antiviral response dominated the
production type 1 ifn. nonprofessional innate immune cells as
fibroblasts, type 1 ifn rapidly produced following recognition viral
dsrna subsequent activation constitutively expressed transcription
factor ifn regulatory factor 3 (irf3). although origin, localization, length 
are factors mediating dsrna recognition binding cellular dsrna-binding 
proteins, biological significance differential dsrna binding unclear,
since subsequent signaling pathways converge irf3. study, show 
a dsrna length-dependent activation irfs, ifns, ifn-stimulated genes in
mouse fibroblasts. length dependence exacerbated fibroblasts deficient
in mitochondria-associated adaptor ifn-beta promoter stimulator 1 irf3,
suggesting antiviral gene induction mediated short long dsrna
molecules predominantly ifn-beta promoter stimulator 1 irf3 dependent 
independent, respectively. furthermore, provide evidence innate
antiviral response fibroblasts absence irf3 type 1 ifn
induction. even key modulators missing, 60-90% inhibition virus
replication observed following 24-h treatment short long dsrna
molecules, respectively. data provide evidence novel antiviral pathway
that dependent dsrna length, independent type 1 ifn system.
