the replication two pathotypes avian reovirus, 1733 2177 transformed
chicken lymphoid myeloid cell lines examined, showing the
macrophage cell line, hd11, supports replication. virulent strain 1733 causes
a lytic infection producing 100-1000 fold virus avirulent strain
2177. cells infected strain 2177 display delayed viral rna protein
synthesis well suppressed expression major capsid protein mub.
these features may contribute lower virulence strain 2177 
natural host vivo.
