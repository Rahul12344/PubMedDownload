human adenovirus c (hadv-c) species common cause respiratory infections 
and occasionally produce severe clinical manifestations. deeper
understanding variation evolution species hadv-c especially
important since viruses, including hadv-c6, used gene delivery
vectors human gene therapy biotechnological applications. here, 
the full-genome analysis prototype hadv-c6 recently identified virus
provisionally termed hadv-c57 reported. although genomes species
hadv-c members similar other, e3 region, hexon fiber
(ten proteins total) present wide range identity values amino acid
level. studies viruses comparison three hadv-c
prototypes (1, 2, 5) comprise comprehensive analysis diversity and
conservation within hadv-c species. hadv-c6 contains recombination event within
the constant region hexon gene. hadv-c57 recombinant virus a
fiber gene nearly identical hadv-c6 unique hexon distinguished its
loop 2 motif.
