photodynamic polymers comprehensive anti-infective materials: staying ahead of
a growing global threat.

peddinti bst, scholle f, ghiladi ra, spontak rj.

to combat global threat posed surface-adhering pathogens becoming
increasingly drug-resistant, explore anti-infective efficacy bulk
thermoplastic elastomer films containing âˆ¼1 wt % zinc-tetra(4-
n-methylpyridyl)porphine (zntmpyp4+), photoactive antimicrobial utilizes
visible light generate singlet oxygen. photodynamic polymer capable of
inactivating five bacterial strains two viruses least 99.89% and
99.95% success, respectively, exposure noncoherent light 60 min.
unlike anti-infective methodologies commonly requiring oxidizing chemicals,
carcinogenic radiation, toxic nanoparticles, approach nonspecific and
safe/nontoxic, sustainably relies availability oxygen and
visible light.
