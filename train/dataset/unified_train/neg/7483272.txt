the hsv-1 transactivator immediate-early (ie) gene expression, vp16, has
several functional homologues among alphaherpesviruses yet
been extensively studied relation modes action. date, nothing
is known exact sites mechanism interaction equine herpesvirus
type 1 (ehv-1) homologue, gene 12 protein, ehv-1 ie promoter. we
show gene 12 protein utilises promoter proximal region ie
gene induce activation identify four potential octamer dna binding sites
within region. although divergence consensus, oct-1 bound
to sites vitro complex formation assay, the
presence gene 12 product second complex slower migration, was
also dependent oct-1, detected. site inserted basal
promoter, two conferred activation gene 12 resulting increase in
expression 50-fold compared basal levels. results show that,
despite differences two proteins, mechanism interaction of
the gene 12 protein target analogous vp16.
