background/aim: liver steatosis (ls) variably associated chronic
hepatitis c (chc) whether affects sustained virological response to
antiviral treatment mechanisms question still debate, at
least genotypes. aim work assess frequency ls,
its relationship host viral factors extent influence 
the response antiviral combination therapy pegylated interferon
(inf)+ribavirin group patients chc single center.
patients: one hundred twelve patients histologically proven chc were
treated peg inf-alpha 2a 180 microg week subcutaneously 48 weeks plus 
ribavirin 1000 1200 mg/day, according patient's body weight. steatosis 
was graded according brunt et al.
results: forty-six 112 patients (41.1%) sustained virological
responders (svr). seventy-two 112 (64.3%) presented ls histology; 
in group, 24 patients (33.3%) svr compared 22 (55%) 
the non-steatosis group (chi(2)=6.5, p<0.02). variables associated the
steatosis group were: higher serum levels ast (p<0.04), alanine
aminotransferase (p<0.02), gamma-gt (p<0.004), genotype 3a (p<0.03) severity 
of histology (staging p<0.05) multiple linear regression analysis only
genotype 3a staging significantly associated ls. svr group, 
age body mass index (bmi) significantly lower (p<0001 p<0.03,
respectively) compared non-responders; moreover, genotype 1 more
frequent nr group, genotype 3 frequent svr group. at
histology, grading staging also lower svr group. multiple
logistic regression showed grade steatosis genotype 3a 
the variables independently associated svr.
conclusions: study showed frequency ls higher side range 
so far reported literature confirmed negatively influences
response therapy. genotype1 confirmed frequent type 
area. frequent patients mild-moderate steatosis seems to
condition therapeutic response negatively, together bmi age. in
contrast, genotype 3a frequent patients severe steatosis, 
a favorable predictor successful therapy.
