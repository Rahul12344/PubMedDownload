in plants, primary defense pathogens mostly inducible and
associated cell wall modification defense-related gene expression,
including many secreted proteins. study role secreted proteins, a
yeast-based signal-sequence trap screening conducted rna from
phytophthora capsici-inoculated root capsicum annuum 'criollo de morelos 334' 
(cm334). total, 101 capsicum annuum secretome (cas) clones isolated and
identified, 92 predicted secretory signal sequence at
their n-terminus. identify differences expressed cas genes between
resistant susceptible cultivars pepper, reverse northern blots and
real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction performed rna
samples isolated different time points following p. capsici inoculation. an
attempt assign biological functions cas genes, performed planta
knock-down assays using tobacco rattle virus-based gene-silencing method.
silencing eight cas genes pepper resulted suppression cell death 
induced non-host bacterial pathogen (pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato t1). 
three cas genes induced phenotypic abnormalities silenced plants one,
cas259 (pr4-l), caused cell death suppression perturbed phenotypes.
these results provide evidence cas genes may play important roles in
pathogen defense well developmental processes.
