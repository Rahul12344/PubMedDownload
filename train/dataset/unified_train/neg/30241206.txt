purpose: human papillomavirus (hpv) dna screening reduces cervical cancer
incidence mortality low-resource settings. self-collected vaginal samples 
tested affordable hpv tests carehpv increase rate of
screening resource-constrained settings. report role visual
inspection acetic acid (via) triage test women testing positive
with carehpv test self-collected vaginal samples.
methods: part multicountry demonstration study, 5,207 women 30 49
years age recruited urban slums undergo four cervical screening
tests using carehpv test self-collected vaginal samples,
provider-collected cervical samples, papanicolaou test, via. women
who tested positive screening tests evaluated colposcopy
and guided biopsies, followed treatment cervical lesions detected.
the data 377 women tested positive hpv self-collected
vaginal samples also analyzed assess performance via, conventional
cytology, colposcopy, triage tests detection cervical cancer and
precancerous lesions.
results: nineteen percent women tested positive vaginal hpv (v-hpv)
also tested positive via test; cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+
lesions detected 58% women. 30 % women tested 
positive v-hpv cytology triage, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+
lesions detected 80% women. colposcopy referrals women
who tested positive v-hpv reduced 7.6% 1.5% via triage, and
to 2.3% cytology triage. although sensitivity reduced, positive
predictive value improved triage via cytology.
conclusion: study reflects optimal role via triaging treatment
selection lesions among test positive v-hpv screen treat 
screening programs use hpv test low-resource settings.
