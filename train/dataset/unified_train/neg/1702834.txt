heterosexual transmission hiv-1 likely involve transmission virus
present seminal fluid inflammatory cells, particularly macrophages, present
in endometrium peritoneal cavity. investigated susceptibility
of peritoneal macrophages corresponding autologous blood monocytes from
normal women infection ba-l strain hiv-1. 10 18 examples,
peritoneal macrophages showed signs infection within 4-5 days, was
earlier autologous monocytes. contrast peritoneal macrophages,
lung macrophages 10 11 normal donors failed show significant reverse
transcriptase (rt) values 3 weeks post infection. monolayer cultures monocytes
cultured 5 days prior infection developed rt values similar overall to
those freshly isolated cells although individual donors varied which
culture condition optimal. ease infection peritoneal macrophages
did correlate levels cd4 antigen degree pelvic inflammatory
development, macrophages harvested women early menstrual
cycle significantly susceptible infection collected from
midcycle on. unexplained heightened infectibility peritoneal macrophages 
in proportion normal women suggests individuals could 
risk heterosexual transmission hiv-1 infection.
