a significant proportion human genome consists stably inherited
retroviral sequences. human endogenous retroviruses (hervs) became defective
over time. herv-k(hml-2) family exceptional coding capacity
and possible involvement germ cell tumor (gct) development. herv-k(hml-2) 
transcription strongly upregulated gcts. however, regulation of
herv-k(hml-2) transcription remains poorly understood. investigated detail 
the role cpg methylation transcriptional activity herv-k(hml-2) long
terminal repeats (ltrs). find cpg sites various herv-k(hml-2) proviral
5' ltrs methylated different levels cell line tera-1. methylation
levels correlate previously observed transcriptional activities these
proviruses. cpg-mediated silencing herv-k(hml-2) ltrs corroborated 
by transcriptional inactivity vitro-methylated 5' ltr reporter plasmids.
however, cpg methylation levels solely regulate herv-k(hml-2) 5' ltr
activity, evidenced different ltr activities cell line t47d. a
significant number mutated cpg sites evolutionary old herv-k(hml-2) 5' ltrs
suggests cpg methylation already silenced herv-k(hml-2) proviruses
millions years ago. direct silencing herv-k(hml-2) expression cpg
methylation enlightens upregulated herv-k(hml-2) expression usually
hypomethylated gct tissue.
