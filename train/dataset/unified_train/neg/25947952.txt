severe chronic active epstein-barr virus (caebv) disease defined severe
progressive illness lasting 6Â months longer infiltration tissues 
ebv-positive lymphocytes, markedly elevated levels ebv dna blood, and
no known immunodeficiency hiv. patients usually fever,
splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, may markedly elevated ebv antibody titers
to viral capsid antigen. although cause cases severe caebv is
unknown, one well-documented case associated compound heterozygous
mutations prf1 (perforin 1). report patient prolonged severe
caebv underwent bone marrow transplant disease subsequently was
found compound heterozygous mutations stxbp2 (munc18-2) well a
heterozygous mutation prf1 (perforin 1).
