low socioeconomic status (ses) childhood adolescence found to
predict greater susceptibility common cold viruses adults. here, test
whether low childhood ses associated shorter leukocyte telomere length in
adulthood, whether telomere length mediates association childhood
ses susceptibility acute upper respiratory disease adulthood. at
baseline, 196 healthy volunteers reported whether currently owned home
and, year childhood, whether parents owned family
home. volunteers also blood drawn assessment specific antibody 
challenge virus, cd8+ cd28- t-lymphocyte telomere length (in subset,
n=135). subsequently quarantined hotel, exposed virus
(rhinovirus [rv] 39) causes common cold followed infection and
illness (clinical cold) five post-exposure days. lower childhood ses as
measured fewer years parental home ownership associated shorter
adult cd8+ cd28- telomere length increased probability developing 
infection clinical illness exposed common cold virus adulthood. 
these associations independent adult ses, age, sex, race, body mass,
neuroticism, childhood family characteristics. associations infections
and colds also independent pre-challenge viral-specific antibody and
season. analyses support mediating roles smoking, alcohol
consumption physical activity suggest cd8+ cd28- cell telomere length
may act partial mediator associations childhood ses and
infection childhood ses colds.
