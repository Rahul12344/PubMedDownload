availability genetic techniques, gene fusion escherichia coli, 
made subject particularly amenable study prokaryote. have
constructed variety strains gene coding outer membrane
protein fused gene coding normally cytoplasmic enzyme,
beta-galactosidase. hybrid protein produced strains retain
beta-galactosidase activity; activity serves simple biochemical tag for
studying localization outer membrane protein. addition, have
exploited phenotypes exhibited certain fusion strains isolate mutants 
are altered process protein export. genetic biochemical analyses of
such mutants provided important insights mechanism protein
localization.
