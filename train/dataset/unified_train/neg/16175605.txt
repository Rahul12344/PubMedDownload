expression costimulatory molecules significantly upregulated various
organs animal model severe hepatitis induced injection of
propionibacterium acnes (p. acnes) lipopolysaccharide (lps). present
study, examined whether blockade costimulatory signals ctla-4ig can
suppress liver injury model. injected adenovirus encoding
ctla-4ig (adctla-4ig) mice 7 days before, day, 3 days after
p. acnes priming. virus found infect liver preferentially, and
ctla-4ig detected serum early 2 days viral injection.
after injection lps, liver injury survival rates examined. of
the mice injected adctla-4ig died within 12 hours injection of
lps. contrast, adctla-4ig-injected mice survived virus was
injected 7 days day p. acnes priming. importantly,
hemorrhagic liver injury serum alanine aminotransferase levels were
significantly reduced lps injection even adctla-4ig injected 3
days p. acnes priming. immunological analyses showed ctla-4ig
inhibited activation expansion p. acnes-specific cd4+ cells the
hepatic lymph nodes, leading reduction recruitment cells to
the liver. total amounts interferon-gamma, interleukin-12, various
chemokines liver decreased, resulting inhibition the
secondary recruitment cells also macrophages. conclusion,
ctla-4ig could useful treatment severe liver injury.
