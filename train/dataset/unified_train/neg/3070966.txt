it still difficult differentiate various stages myocarditis 
and primary dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm). hence, analyzed history, well
as laboratory virological data 22 children dilated, poorly
functioning left ventricle, aged 2 months 16.7 years (m = 4.2 y), we
had performed endomyocardial biopsies 4 months beginning the
illness. specimens investigated light electron microscopy and, in
addition immunoserological (n = 15) immunohistological investigations (n = 7)
were performed. basis cellular infiltration histological
examination diagnosed resolving/resolved myocarditis 6 patients dcm 
15 patients. previous respiratory infection sudden onset found 40-50% 
of patients groups. antimyolemmal antisarcolemmal antibodies showed
no preference. follow-up (3.1 +/- 2.8 years) patients showed equal
mortality (33% vs. 38%) post-myocarditis dcm group. complete
normalization findings 3 patients dcm group makes the
classification among post-myocarditis group probable, would, give 
a lower mortality rate (22% vs. 46%) chance restitution 55% cases.
in one specific case diagnostic methods allow undoubted
distinction entities. prognosis myocarditis seems be
better dcm childhood.
