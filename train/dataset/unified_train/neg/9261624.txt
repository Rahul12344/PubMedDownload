background/aims: study, evaluated association among serum
transaminase values, seropositivity hbv dna liver histopathology of
patients positive hbsag hbe antibodies.
methodology: thirty-five patients placed two groups according their
serum transaminase values. patients normal transaminase values were
evaluated first group. patients normal transaminase values 
were subjected second group.
results: first group patients normal transaminase values,
biopsy-proven moderate severe chronic hepatitis observed. hbv dna
seropositivity 53.3% group. forty-five percent patients with
above normal transaminase values moderate chronic hepatitis and
seropositivity hbv dna group 55%. results supported the
association transaminase values liver pathology, statistically
significant association shown seropositivity hbv dna liver
pathology.
conclusion: much studied understand function hbv dna 
the follow hbsag carriers, liver biopsy used routinely the
follow asymptomatic carriers happen high transaminase
values.
