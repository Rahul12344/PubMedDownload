the hepatitis c virus (hcv) genome encodes two envelope glycoproteins (e1 e2)
which interact noncovalently form heterodimer (e1-e2). folding
and assembly hcv glycoproteins, large portion proteins trapped 
in aggregates, reducing efficiency native e1-e2 complex assembly. to
better understand phenomenon try increase efficiency hcv
glycoprotein folding, endoplasmic reticulum chaperones potentially interacting
with proteins studied. calnexin, calreticulin, bip shown to
interact e1 e2, whereas interaction detected grp94 and
hcv glycoproteins. association hcv glycoproteins calnexin and
calreticulin faster bip, kinetics interaction with
calnexin calreticulin similar. however, calreticulin bip
interacted preferentially aggregates whereas calnexin preferentially
associated monomeric forms hcv glycoproteins noncovalent complexes.
tunicamycin treatment inhibited binding hcv glycoproteins calnexin 
calreticulin, indicating importance n-linked oligosaccharides these
interactions. effect co-overexpression chaperone the
folding hcv glycoproteins also analyzed. however, levels native
e1-e2 complexes increased. together, data suggest calnexin
plays role productive folding hcv glycoproteins whereas calreticulin 
and bip probably involved nonproductive pathway folding.
