one major proteins escherichia coli outer cell envelope membrane,
protein i, separated electrophoretically protein components ia and
ib. strain differences exist regarding presence absence component ib and
this component selectively lost mutation resistance phage.
both components ia ib heterogeneous isoelectrically, both
together may contain lease six separable isoelectric species. judged by
analysis cyanogen bromide fragments, ia ib almost identical
concerning primary structure; difference (charge size and
charge) located part protein correspond the
c-terminal n-terminal regions. components ia ib thus represent essentially
the polypeptide may arise modification process vitro the
existence two almost identical genes.
