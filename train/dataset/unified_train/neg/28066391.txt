understanding pathogens maintain virulence critical developing
tools mitigate disease animal populations. sequenced assembled the
first draft genome roseofilum reptotaenium ao1, dominant cyanobacterium
underlying pathogenicity virulent coral black band disease (bbd), and
analyzed parts bbd-associated geitlerinema sp. bbd_1991 genome silico. 
both cyanobacteria equipped adaptive, heritable clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)-cas defense system type i-d and
have potential virulence genes located within several prophage regions. the
defense system helps prevent infection viruses mobile genetic elements 
via identification short fingerprints intruding dna, stored
as templates bacterial genome, so-called "crisprs." analysis crispr 
target sequences (protospacers) revealed unusually high number of
self-targeting spacers r. reptotaenium ao1 extraordinary long cripsr
arrays 260 spacers geitlerinema sp. bbd_1991. self-targeting
spacers unlikely form autoimmunity; instead target an
incomplete lysogenic bacteriophage. lysogenic virus induction experiments with
mitomycin c uv light reveal actively replicating virus population 
in r. reptotaenium ao1 cultures, suggesting phage functionality is
compromised excision could blocked crispr-cas system. potential
prophages identified three regions r. reptotaenium ao1 five
regions geitlerinema sp. bbd_1991, containing putative bbd relevant virulence 
genes, nad-dependent epimerase/dehydratase (a homolog terms of
functionality third fourth expressed gene bbd),
lysozyme/metalloendopeptidases lipopolysaccharide modification genes.
to date, viruses considered component bbd consortium
or contributor virulence r. reptotaenium ao1 geitlerinema sp.
bbd_1991. suggest presence virulence genes potential prophage
regions, crispr-cas defense systems evidence arms race 
the respective cyanobacteria bacteriophage predators. presence of
such defense system likely reduces number successful bacteriophage
infections mortality cyanobacteria, facilitating progress bbd.
