background: hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection major public health problem in
india. detection hcv genotypes simple economic assays a
prime requirement planning antiviral treatments patients infected
with virus. although commercial assays available detection of
both hcv rna genotypes, efforts aimed development simple and
economical systems measurements still going on.
aim: present study designed clone express hcv core gene from
hcv genotype-1a genotype-3a use peptides develop immunoassays 
the detection genotype-specific antibodies sera samples.
methods: one hundred thirty-five serum samples patients liver and
renal diseases screened hcv rna real-time pcr, followed hcv
genotyping rna-positive sera restriction fragment length polymorphism,
sequencing, phylogenetic analysis. hcv core gene amplified sera 
carrying hcv genotype-1a genotype-3a cloned expressed pet19b
vector. translational products used develop western blot assay 
the detection genotype-specific anti-hcv antibodies.
results: hcv core gene, genotypes, cloned expressed
successfully, production 26 kda recombinant protein either case.
using peptides western blot assay, 101 sera samples tested the
anti-hcv core antibody. peptide showed reaction anti-hcv total
antibody without showing genotype-specific binding. indicates that
individual peptides obtained different genotypes a
genotype-specific epitope bind antibodies.
conclusion: cloning expression hcv core gene genotype-1a and
genotype-3a successful. however, peptides formed show
genotype-specific binding anti-hcv.
