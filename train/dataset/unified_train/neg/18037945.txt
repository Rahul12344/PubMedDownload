human herpesvirus 6 (hhv-6) causes life-threatening encephalopathy recipients 
of allogeneic sct, consensus reached regarding appropriate
preventive methods. study evaluated plasma hhv-6 viral load-guided
preemptive approach hhv-6-associated encephalopathy. plasma real-time pcr
assay performed week. among 29 patients, 19 developed positive plasma 
hhv-6 dna. median maximum plasma hhv-6 dna 4593.5 copies/ml plasma (range,
150.0-127 891.0 copies/ml plasma). one eight events low-level hhv-6
dna (defined <1000 copies/ml plasma) four seven events mid-level
hhv-6 dna (1000-9999.5 copies/ml plasma), hhv-6 loads plasma subsequently
continued increasing. ganciclovir administered six nine patients
with high-level hhv-6 dna (> =10,000 copies/ml plasma). high-level hhv-6 dna
resolved similarly groups without ganciclovir therapy. among 
nine patients high-level hhv-6 dna two developed encephalopathy. as
encephalopathy developed detection high-level hhv-6 dna plasma, 
these two patients received preemptive ganciclovir therapy. in
conclusion, preemptive approach hhv-6-associated encephalopathy
cannot prevent cases hhv-6 encephalopathy sct recipients due the
dynamic kinetics plasma hhv-6 viral load.
