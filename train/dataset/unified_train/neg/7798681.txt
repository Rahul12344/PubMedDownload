cytomegalovirus (cmv) pneumonia associated development secondary
immunosuppression resultant bacterial fungal superinfections. because
class ii hla expression within lung may important normal pulmonary
cell-mediated immunity, association cmv infection alveolar epithelial
cells (aec) absence hla class ii antigens tested. using
dual-labeling immunohistochemistry detect cmv, aec, endothelial cells,
macrophages, hla class ii antigens, lung tissue patients died 
cmv pneumonia examined. seventy-five percent infected cells aec. in
contrast adjacent noninfected aec, expressed hla-dr antigens, 91% of
infected aec negative. difference expression pattern
between patients without aids. absence hla class ii antigens on
infected aec may account, part, secondary immunosuppression associated
with cmv pneumonia.
