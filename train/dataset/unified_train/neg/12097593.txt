dendritic cells (dc) support human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1)
transmission capture virus particle mucosa subsequent
transport draining lymph node, hiv-1 presented cd4(+) th
cells. virus transmission involves high-affinity interaction the
dc-specific surface molecule dc-sign viral envelope glycoprotein gp120
and subsequent internalization virus, remains infectious. the
mechanism viral transmission dc cells currently unknown. sentinel
immature dc (idc) develop th1-promoting effector dc1 th2-promoting dc2,
depending activation signals. studied ability effector dc 
subsets support hiv-1 transmission vitro. compared idc, virus
transmission greatly upregulated dc1 subset, whereas dc2 cells are
inactive. increased transmission dc1 correlates increased expression of
icam-1, blocking studies confirm icam-1 expression dc important
for hiv transmission. icam-1-lfa-1 interaction known important for
immunological cross talk dc cells, results indicate that
this cell-cell contact exploited hiv-1 efficient transmission.
