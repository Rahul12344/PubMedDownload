severe pneumonia found simultaneous influenza pneumonia bacterial
infection, suggests relationship immunological mechanisms. here, we
performed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis detect immunological molecules
related fulminant pneumonia caused influenza virus streptococcus
pneumoniae co-infection mice. found two spots expressed strongly 
in co-infected mouse lungs, compared s. pneumoniae influenza virus singly
infected mouse lungs. spots analysed mass spectrometry, and
identified alpha-1 anti-trypsin (a1at), known anti-protease for
neutrophil-derived proteolytic enzymes, creatine kinase, reflects a
greater degree lung damage cell death. a1at expression increased
significantly, proteolytic enzymes neutrophils, neutrophil
elastase, myeloperoxidase lysozyme, also secreted abundantly in
influenza virus s. pneumoniae co-infected lungs compared s. pneumoniae
or influenza virus singly infected lungs. data suggest a1at may play a
central role molecule broad anti-inflammatory properties, and
regulation neutrophil-mediated severe lung inflammation important in
the pathogenesis co-infection influenza virus bacteria.
