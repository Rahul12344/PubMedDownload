during recent decades incidence testicular cancer (tc) increased
rapidly around world. associated exogenous etiological factors might
therefore identifiable. performed case-control study nested within
finnish, swedish icelandic maternity cohorts exploiting early pregnancy serum
samples evaluate role congenital neonatal infections with
epstein-barr virus (ebv) cytomegalovirus (cmv) risk factors tc the
offspring. case-index mother pair, three four matched control-control
mother pairs identified using national population registries. first
trimester sera retrieved index mothers 66 tc cases 258
matched control mothers, tested antibodies ebv cmv. high
level maternal ebv igg antibodies associated significantly increased 
risk tc offspring (odds ratio (or), 2.50; 95% confidence interval (ci),
1.15, 5.40), especially risk non-seminoma tc (or, 2.73; 950% ci, 1.25,
5.99) non-seminoma tc diagnosed 8 years age (or, 2.72; 95% ci, 1.05,
7.04). contrast, offspring cmv igg-seropositive mothers decreased
risk tc diagnosed 8 years age (or, 0.35; 95% ci, 0.14, 0.89). our
results suggest ebv cmv infections may associated tc.
