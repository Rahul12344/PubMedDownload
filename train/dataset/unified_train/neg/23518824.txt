background: association hospitalization respiratory syncytial
virus (rsv) infection infancy asthma/wheezing later life long 
studied. however, published studies combined systematic review and
meta-analysis existing evidence.
purpose: quantify link rsv hospitalization early life and
subsequent diagnosis asthma.
method: systematic search conducted using medline embase databases.
studies selected meta-analysis assessed association 
rsv-confirmed hospitalization 3 years age asthma/wheezing later 
in life. potential sources heterogeneity identified stratified
analysis.
results: twenty articles representing 15 unique studies 82,008 unique
individuals (including 1533 rsv-confirmed hospitalization) selected for
meta-analysis. children rsv disease early life higher incidence 
of asthma/wheezing later life (odds ratio: 3.84; 95% confidence interval:
3.23-4.58). moderate heterogeneity studies (i² = 45%). the
association found decrease age follow-up, consistent the
findings longitudinal studies. age follow-up considered,
heterogeneity low (residual i² = 17%).
limitations: study quality generally poor randomization to
hospitalization rsv infection possible, appropriate blinding rare
and adjustment confounding variables always appropriate.
conclusions: meta-analysis suggests association infant rsv
hospitalization respiratory morbidity decreases age. the
association causal, development effective vaccine rsv could 
decrease burden asthma.
