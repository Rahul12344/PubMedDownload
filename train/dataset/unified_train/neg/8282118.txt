brefeldin macrolide antibiotic interferes membrane traffic and
blocks growth several animal viruses including vesicular stomatitis virus 
(vsv). inhibition vsv brefeldin takes place least two different
steps growth cycle: glycosylation vsv g protein the
replication viral genomes. results indicate interference with
membrane traffic leads inhibition viral protein glycosylation, but
also blockade virus genome replication several cytoplasmic
rna-containing viruses.
