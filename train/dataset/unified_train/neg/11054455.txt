transfection transduction studies involving use full-length
dystrophin (11 kb) truncated mini-gene (6 kb) cdnas hampered the
large size resulting viral non-viral expression vectors. usually
results low yields transgene-expressing cells. moreover, detection
of transgene-expressing cells often tedious costly. these
reasons, expression vectors containing enhanced green fluorescent protein
(egfp) fused n-termini mini- full-length human dystrophin were
constructed. constructs tested transfection phoenix cells with
effectene, resulting 48 h green fluorescent signal 20% cells.
analysis cell extracts immunoblotting use monoclonal
antibody specific dystrophin c-terminus confirmed expression of
egfp-mini- (240 kda) egfp-full-length human dystrophin (450 kda) fusion
proteins. moreover, following vivo electroporation plasmids
containing egfp-mini- full-length dystrophin mouse muscles, both
fluorescent proteins observed cryostat sections normal location 
under plasma membrane. indicates fusion egfp dystrophin
or mini-dystrophin interfere normal localization protein.
in conclusion, fusion egfp provides good tool search best
methods introduce mini- full-length dystrophin cdna cells (in vitro)
or muscle fibers (in vivo) establishment treatment gene therapy
of duchenne muscular dystrophy patients.
