a new epstein-barr virus nuclear antigen (ebna)-positive b-cell line, designated 
ball-2, spontaneously established peripheral blood 14-year-old 
boy ebna-negative b-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (b-all), l2 
french-american-british classification. ball-2 cell line grew suspension
with without forming clumps cells. cultured cells exhibited lymphoid
morphology indented lobulated nuclei, prominent nucleoli, relatively 
abundant cytoplasm. immunologic cytogenetic studies showed ball-2
cell line expressed b-cell phenotype, cpig+, smig+, cd19+, cd20+, cd38-, ia+,
and chromosome translocation, t(8;14) (q24;q32). phenotypic and
chromosome markers present original leukemia cells. results
indicated cell line derived patient's leukemia cells.
unexpectedly, however, ball-2 cells positive ebna eb virus dna. gene
analysis ball-2 cell line showed biallelic rearrangements jh locus.
one jh rearrangement comigrated rearranged c-myc gene, indicating
the translocation occurred jh c-myc loci. t(8;14) abnormality
is known chromosome marker burkitt lymphoma l3 type all. studies
revealed translocation myc gene rearrangement also found 
l2 type b-all.
