objective: examine apparently normal skin around equine sarcoids evidence 
of bovine papilloma virus (bpv) dna, relate finding observed
recurrence surgery.
study design: prospective study.
animals sample population: forty-one equine sarcoids 19 horses.
materials methods: tumors surgically excised measured distance 
of 8, 12, 16 mm. samples tumor entire surrounding skin
were taken 4, 8, 12, 16 mm tumor border analyzed the
presence bpv dna using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification. the
samples grouped per examined sarcoid, tumor considered positive at
a certain distance soon least one samples distance was
positive. clinical outcome recorded sarcoid minimal
follow-up 6 months.
results: sarcoids positive bpv(1) bpv(2). tumor margin was
positive 4, 8, 12, 16 mm in, respectively, 95%, 73%, 39%, 33% the
examined sarcoids. local recurrence observed 3 sarcoids 3 different
horses. survival analysis, greater likelihood local
recurrence sarcoids surgical margin positive bpv dna.
conclusions clinical relevance: bpv dna often detected visibly normal
skin around sarcoids, significantly greater probability local 
recurrence surgical margins positive presence bpv dna.
