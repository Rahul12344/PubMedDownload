the circumventricular organs (cvos) lack well-formed blood-brain barrier and
produce superoxide response angiotensin ii hypertensive stimuli. 
this increase central superoxide implicated regulation of
blood pressure. extracellular superoxide dismutase (sod3) highly expressed
in cells associated cvos particularly tanycytes lining region.
to understand role sod3 cvos blood pressure regulation, we
performed intracerebroventricular injection adenovirus encoding
cre-recombinase (5x10(8) particles per milliliter) mice loxp sites
flanking sod3 coding region (sod3(loxp/loxp) mice). adenovirus encoding
red-fluorescent protein injected control. deletion cvo sod3 increased
baseline blood pressure modestly markedly augmented hypertensive response
to low-dose angiotensin ii (140 ng/kg per day), whereas intracerebroventricular
injection adenovirus encoding red-fluorescent protein minimal effects on
these parameters. adenovirus encoding cre-recombinase-treated mice exhibited
increased sympathetic modulation heart rate blood pressure variability,
increased vascular superoxide production, t-cell activation characterized 
by increased circulating cd69(+)/cd3(+) cells. deletion cvo sod3 also markedly
increased vascular t-cell leukocyte infiltration caused angiotensin ii. we
conclude sod3 cvo plays critical role regulation blood
pressure, loss promotes t-cell activation vascular inflammation, in
part modulating sympathetic outflow. findings provide insight how
central signals produce vascular inflammation response hypertensive
stimuli, angiotensin ii.
