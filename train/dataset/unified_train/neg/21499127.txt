t-cell receptor (tcr) gene therapy enables rapid creation of
antigen-specific cells mice strain represents valuable tool
for preclinical immunotherapy studies. here, describe superiority of
γ-retroviral vectors compared lentiviral vectors transduction murine 
t cells surprisingly illustrate robust gene-transfer phenotypically
naive/memory-stem cell like (tn/tscm; cd62l(hi)/cd44(low)) central memory
(tcm; cd62l(hi)/cd44(hi)) cd8+ cells using murine stem cell-based γ-retroviral 
vectors (msgv1). created msgv1 vectors major histocompatibility
complex-class i-restricted tcr specific melanocyte-differentiation
antigen, glycoprotein 100 (msgv1-pmel-1), major histocompatibility
complex-class ii-restricted tcr specific tyrosinase-related protein-1
(msgv1-trp-1), found robust gene expression required codon optimization 
of tcr sequences pmel-1 tcr. test functionality, adoptively
transferred tcr-engineered cells mice bearing b16 melanomas observed
delayed growth established tumors pmel-1 tcr engineered cd8+ cells 
significant tumor regression trp-1 tcr transduced cd4 cells. we
simultaneously created lentiviral vectors encoding pmel-1 tcr, found that
these vectors mediated low tcr expression murine cells, robust gene
expression murine human cell lines. results indicate that
preclinical murine models adoptive immunotherapies practical using
γ-retroviral rather lentiviral vectors.
