gross microscopic lesions associated bolivan hemorrhagic fever virus
infection rhesus monkey studied 10 animals died following
inoculation. gross lesions included skin rash, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly,
meningeal edema, hydropericardium enlarged friable livers. hemorrhagic
manifestations infection consistently observed, hemorrhages
were present skin, heart, brain nares monkeys. histopathologic
lesions fairly consistent. hepatic necrosis presence acidophilic
hyaline bodies, necrotizing enteritis, epithelial necrosis adrenal cortical
necrosis present monkeys. monkeys died the
seventeenth day infection nonsupurative meningoencephalitis; lymphoid
necrosis present 3 monkeys died day 18. microscopic
lesions included myocardial degeneration, lymphoid reticuloendothelial cell
hyperplasia lymphoid depletion. histopathologic lesions described
in human autopsy material reproduced; however, necrosis skin 
oral mucosa, mucosa gastrointestinal tract adrenal cortex not
been described man. despite apparent discrepancies results this
investigation indicate rhesus monkey good experimental model for
the study bolivian hemorrhagic fever infection.
