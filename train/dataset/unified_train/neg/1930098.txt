the pathogenetic mechanism leading liver tissue injury hepatitis caused 
hepatitis virus unclear. randomly established cell clones from
liver biopsies 4 patients hepatitis a. total 578 clones was
phenotypically analyzed. whereas acute phase disease cd8+ clones
dominated cd4+ clones, biopsy taken late onset clinical
syndromes cd4+ cd8+ clones obtained. interestingly, patient
with second exacerbation disease, 20% clones the
cd3+ wt31- cd4- cd8- gamma delta tcr+ phenotype. variable ifn-gamma production
was observed types cell clones. cd8+ clones cytotoxic
activity, approximately 60% cd8+ clones showed specific cytotoxicity
against autologous fibroblasts infected hepatitis virus with
herpes simplex, adeno- enteroviruses. results show liver injury
in hepatitis caused viral cytopathogenic effect due an
immunopathological reaction sensitized cytotoxic lymphocytes against
infected hepatocytes. addition, studies show enrichment cd4-8-
alpha beta cell receptor negative lymphocytes site inflammation 
and suggest role cells antiviral reaction.
