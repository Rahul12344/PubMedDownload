the hiv transactivator protein, tat, enhances hiv transcription recruiting
p-tefb inactive 7sk snrnp complex directing proviral
elongation complexes. test hypothesis t-cell receptor (tcr) signaling
induces critical post-translational modifications leading enhanced
interactions p-tefb tat, employed affinity purification-tandem
mass spectrometry analyze p-tefb. tcr phorbal ester (pma) signaling
strongly induced phosphorylation cdk9 kinase ser175. molecular modeling
studies based tat/p-tefb x-ray structure suggested pser175
strengthens intermolecular interactions cdk9 tat. mutations in
ser175 confirm residue could mediate critical interactions tat and
with bromodomain protein brd4. s175a mutation reduced cdk9 interactions
with tat average 1.7-fold, also completely blocked cdk9 association 
with brd4. phosphomimetic s175d mutation modestly enhanced tat association
with cdk9 causing 2-fold disruption brd4 association cdk9. since 
brd4 unable compete binding cdk9 carrying s175a, expression cdk9 
carrying s175a mutation latently infected cells resulted robust
tat-dependent reactivation provirus. similarly, stable knockdown of
brd4 led strong enhancement proviral expression. immunoprecipitation
experiments show cdk9 phosphorylated ser175 excluded 7sk rnp 
complex. immunofluorescence flow cytometry studies carried using a
phospho-ser175-specific antibody demonstrated ser175 phosphorylation occurs 
during tcr activation primary resting memory cd4+ cells together with
upregulation cyclin t1 regulatory subunit p-tefb, thr186
phosphorylation cdk9. conclude phosphorylation cdk9 ser175
plays critical role altering competitive binding tat brd4 to
p-tefb provides informative molecular marker identification the
transcriptionally active form p-tefb.
