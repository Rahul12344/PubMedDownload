background: increasing evidence demonstrated notch signaling is
deregulated human hematological malignancies solid tumors. signaling 
has a protumorigenic effect may also act a tumor suppressor. induction
of a single pathway gives rise opposite effects different cell types is
still unknown.
methods: review article includes available data peer-reviewed
publications associated role notch signaling cancer
pathogenesis.
results: numerous reports indicated alterations notch signaling 
its oncogenic activity originally associated pathogenesis t‑cell
acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (t-all), aggressive hematologic tumor
affecting children adolescents. possibility notch could play a
significant role human breast cancer development comes studies mouse
mammary tumor virus-induced cancer. numerous findings past several years
have indicated alterations notch signaling also responsible for
ovarian cancer development. mention also made connection between
expression notch 3 increased resistance chemotherapy, remains
a major obstacle successful treatment. notch oncogenic factor also
involved development colon cancer, lung carcinoma kaposi's sarcoma.
conclusion: notch a binary cell fate determinant overexpression has
been described oncogenic a wide array human malignancies. finding
led interest therapeutically targeting pathway, especially use 
of gamma-secretase inhibitors (gsis) blocking cleavage notch receptors 
the cell membrane inhibition notch intracellular domain (nicd)
releasing. preclinical cancer models revealed gsis suppress growth 
of cancers pancreatic, breast lung cancer.
