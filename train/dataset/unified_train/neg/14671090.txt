adeno-associated virus type 5 (aav5) linear, single-stranded dna genome 
ca. 5 kb overlapping transcription profile featuring multiple promoters
and single intron center genome. unlike situation the
prototype aav2, aav5 rnas transcribed upstream promoters map units 7 (p7)
and 19 (p19), encode viral rep proteins, predominantly
polyadenylated site within intron [(pa)p]. rnas generated aav5 
capsid gene promoter p41, 78 nucleotides (nt) upstream the
intron donor, 281 nt upstream (pa)p, primarily readthrough (pa)p, are
polyadenylated distal site 3' end genome [(pa)d] and
ultimately spliced. intron contains core sequences sufficient for
polyadenylation (pa)p, governed g/u-rich downstream element that
overlaps intron 3' a2 splice acceptor. addition, polyadenylation of
p7- p19-generated rnas (pa)p influenced upstream element that
lies 5' start p41 transcript. results also suggest that
splicing polyadenylation p41-generated rna compete pool
of precursor pre-mrna molecules. cis-acting signals within a2 3' splice
site govern polyadenylation splicing aav5 rnas must optimized to
program (i) levels polyadenylation p7- p19-generated rna at
(pa)p required generate proper levels essential rep proteins and
(ii) splicing p41-generated rnas generate proper ratio capsid
proteins aav5 infection.
