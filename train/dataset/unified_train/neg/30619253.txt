infection certain bacteria, parasites, viruses alters host immune
system leishmania major influencing disease outcome. here, determined the
outcome chronic infection trypanosoma brucei brucei cutaneous
leishmaniasis (cl) caused l. major. c57bl/6 mice infected t. b. brucei
were given sub-curative treatment diminazene aceturate coinfected
with l. major vector bites. results revealed infection t. b.
brucei controls cl pathology. compared controls, coinfected mice showed a
significant decrease lesion size (p < 0.05) 6 weeks post-infection a
significant decrease parasite burden (p < 0.0001) 3 weeks post-infection.
protection l. major resulted non-specific activation cells by
trypanosomes. induced strong immune response characterized ifn-γ
production site bites systemically, creating hostile inflammatory
environment l. major parasites conferring protection cl.
