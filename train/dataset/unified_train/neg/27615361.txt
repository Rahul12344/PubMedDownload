over recent years, growing number papillomaviruses identified,
which cause wide range lesions domestic wild animals.
papillomavirus-induced lesions may great impact animal health, some
diseases observed farm animals associated significant economic
losses. concise review brings together recent advancements animal
papillomavirus research, providing scientific community veterinary
practitioners update rapidly evolving field. among others,
bovine, canine feline papillomaviruses (bpv, cpv fcapv) most
extensively discussed, view recent discovery new viral types and
their worldwide importance animal health. feline papillomaviruses 2 an
emerging, highly prevalent pathogen domestic cats, associated subset of
malignant skin lesions. aspects related cross-species infection bpv its
environmental co-factors also addressed. animal papillomaviruses also
fascinating models studying molecular cell biology recently
inspired major breakthroughs. overall, clear additional,
international systematic efforts needed clarify lesions are
caused viral types develop experimental models studying
animal papillomavirus.
