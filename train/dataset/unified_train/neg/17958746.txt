background: mechanisms responsible thrombocytopenia associated with
dengue fever (df) dengue hemorrhage fever (dhf) remain unclear.
objective: study, investigated pathogenic effects dengue virus 
(denv) non-structural protein 1 (ns1) elicitation platelet
cross-reactive antibodies.
results: results showed anti-denv ns1 immunoglobulins (igs) derived from
both patients df/dhf recombinant ns1-immunized rabbits could opsonize
normal human platelets enhance platelet-macrophage engagements vitro. in
addition, treatments anti-ns1 igs abnormally activated human platelets and
induced thrombocytopenia mice. prothrombotic characteristics anti-ns1
ig might increase disease burden coagulant-aberrant dhf patients. test 
this hypothesis, injected anti-ns1 igs c57bl/6j mice were
preconditioned hypercoagulable state warfarin treatments. given
before platelet-lysate pre-adsorption, anti-ns1 igs injection
treatments significantly increased mortality, fibrin deposition lung, and
plasma d-dimer levels, significantly decreased anticoagulant proteins c,
protein antithrombin iii.
conclusions: results suggest platelet-bound antibody fractions 
anti-ns1 ig prothrombotic, might exacerbate severity disease 
hosts imbalanced coagulant system.
