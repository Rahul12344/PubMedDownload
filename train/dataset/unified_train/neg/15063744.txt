the auxiliary regulatory protein vpr hiv-1 possesses several biological
activities believed facilitate hiv-1 replication pathogenesis.
in report, experimental evidence suggests novel biological activity of
vpr: facilitation turnover vpr mutants bearing l64p mutation. 
novel activity vpr shared vpr molecules different subtypes of
hiv-1. co-expression wild type vpr vprw54a/l64p mutant resulted
in normal synthesis mutant mrna enhanced ubiquitination turnover
of mutant protein. results suggest vpr may interact the
ubiquitin/proteasome pathway regulate stability viral cellular
proteins.
