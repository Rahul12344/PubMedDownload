i. lysogenic b. megatherium 899a (de jong, 1931) produces two types phage
(gratia, 1936 c) c. phage forms cloudy plaques gives rise to
fresh lysogenic strains (gratia, 1936 b) added sensitive strain of
megatherium. may may cause lysis, depending media (northrop,
1951). c phage occurs rarely) forms clear plaques, give rise to
lysogenic strains, causes complete lysis sensitive strain all
conditions tested, provided infection occurs. c phage added the
sensitive strain, mixture allowed stand, made hanging drop
preparation, infected cells stop growing lyse completely 60 80
minutes liberation 50 200 phage particles per cell. if,
however, c phage added rapidly growing culture b. megatherium 
suspension shaken 34 degrees , cells continue grow divide 50 to
60 minutes, infection occurred. lyse, liberation 
from 1000 2500 phage particles per cell. ii. following determinations have
been made megatherium sensitive cells growing 5 per cent peptone at
different stages growth. (1) growth rate infected uninfected cells; (2)
rna, dna, protein content; (3) volume cell; (4) phage yield per cell
by plaque count; (5) phage yield per cell cell plaque count; (6) lysis
time. growth rate decreases cell concentration increases. lysis
time protein n per cell nearly independent growth rate; all
the values increase growth rate increases. ratio see pdf for
equation nearly constant. rna dna per cell increase less rapidly 
volume, na per unit volume constant, decreases size 
the cell increases. phage yield measured conditions the
infected cells grow (by plaque count) nearly proportional the
size cell. phage yield per cell, conditions the
infected cells grow, increases rapidly size cells. the
phage yield per cell conditions may calculated equation see
pdf equation determining factor variation phage yield the
growth rate cells. this, turn, determined composition 
medium. iii. growth phage production megatherium 899a been
determined presence following substances: aureomycin, bacitracin,
chloromycetin, gramicidin, merck ab631, merck ab191, merck ab624, penicillin,
streptomycin, terramycin, tyrothricin, usnic acid, acetone, chloroform, ethyl
alcohol, formaldehyde, gentian violet, glycerin, maleic hydrazide, methyl
alcohol, phenyl mercuric acetate, sodium fluoride, sulfanilamide, toluene, and
urethane. every case, lowest concentration substance which
completely inhibits growth, also lowest concentration completely
inhibits phage production. one antibiotic, merck ab81, causes increased phage
production concentrations partially inhibit growth, low phage
production concentrations completely inhibit growth (as determined by
turbidity). short exposure ultraviolet light also decreases growth rate,
with increase phage production. longer exposure, completely inhibits
growth (as determined turbidity) results lysis phage liberation.
