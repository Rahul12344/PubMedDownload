sarm (sterile alpha armadillo motif-containing protein) recently
identified tir domain-containing cytosolic protein. classified member the
tlr adaptor family, multiple locations functions sarm (sometimes
playing opposing roles), provoke enigma biology. although originally
assumed member tlr adaptor family (functioning negative
regulator tlr signaling pathway), latest findings indicate sarm regulates
signaling differently tlr adaptor proteins. recent studies have
highlighted significant functional role sarm mediating apoptosis and
antiviral innate immune response. review, provide update the
evolutionary conservation, spatial distribution, regulated expression sarm
to highlight diverse functional roles. review summarize findings 
the known interacting partners sarm provide analogy add new
dimensions current understanding multifaceted roles sarm in
antiviral activities apoptotic functions. addition, provide future
perspective roles sarm differentiation development, with
substantial emphasis molecular insights mechanisms action.
