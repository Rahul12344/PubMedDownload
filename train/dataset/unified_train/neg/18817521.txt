retroviral gag polyprotein precursors necessary sufficient the
assembly release virus-like particles (vlps) infected cells. is
well established small gag-encoded motifs, known late domains, promote
particle release interacting components cellular endosomal sorting
and ubiquitination machinery. gag proteins number different
retroviruses ubiquitinated; however, role gag ubiquitination in
particle egress remains undefined. study, investigated question
by using panel equine infectious anemia virus (eiav) gag derivatives bearing
the wild-type eiav late domain, heterologous retroviral late domains late
domain. ubiquitin fused cis c-termini gag polyproteins,
and effects vlp budding measured. remarkably, fusion ubiquitin 
eiav gag lacking late domain (eiav/deltaypdl-ub) largely rescued vlp release.
we also determined effects ubiquitin fusion sensitivity particle
release budding inhibitors depletion key endosomal sorting factors. 
ubiquitin fusion rendered eiav/deltaypdl-ub sensitive depletion cellular
endosomal sorting factors tsg101 alix overexpression of
dominant-negative fragments tsg101 alix. findings demonstrate that
ubiquitin functionally compensate absence retroviral late domain
and provide insights host-cell machinery engaged ubiquitin during
particle egress.
