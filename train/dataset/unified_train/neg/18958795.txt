kaposi sarcoma (ks) complex disease aspects virology (human
herpesvirus-8, hhv-8, human immunodeficiency virus, hiv), immunology
(immunodeficiency), hyperplasia (multiple widely spaced de novo lesions), and
neoplasia (metastases) always common aids-defining
malignancy. lesional spindle cell classified derived from
either blood vascular or, recently, lymphatic endothelial cell origin. 
study revealed spectrum endothelial cell ultrastructure lymphatic to
blood vascular. demonstrated frequent weibel-palade bodies gap junctions. 
the spindle cells shown behave facultative phagocytes, internalizing
and processing necrotic cells leaked red blood cells (rbcs). fragmented rbcs 
were equivalent "hyaline droplets" seen light microscopy. final
stages rbc disintegration hemosiderin ferritin. significantly,
this study disclosed ks actually composed single type randomly
oriented spindle cell forming vessels varying size integrity.
