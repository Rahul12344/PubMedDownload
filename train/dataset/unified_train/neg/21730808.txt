when examining children rhabdomyolysis due viral myositis. report a
case recurrent bilateral thigh compartment syndrome patient with
influenza a, subtype pandemic h1n1-2009.case: 8-year-old girl history
of rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, compartment syndrome secondary to
parainfluenza infection resulted release lower limb compartments
presented 3-day history flu symptoms increasing bilateral thigh
pain. compartment syndrome confirmed intracompartmental pressure
measurements comparison intracompartmental pressure measurements to
diastolic blood pressure. compartments released. also experienced
acute renal failure, treated continuous renal replacement therapy
and hemodialysis. recent orthopedic follow-up, well.
conclusions: first reported case recurrent rhabdomyolysis and
compartment syndrome complication viral myositis. case highlights
