background: 2001-2002 poliomyelitis outbreak due recombinant
vaccine-derived polioviruses (vdpvs) toliara province madagascar,
another outbreak reoccurred province 2005.
methods: conducted epidemiological virological investigations each
polio case patient contacts.
results: may august 2005, total 5 cases acute flaccid paralysis
were reported among unvaccinated partially vaccinated children 2-3 years old. 
type-3 type-2 vdpv isolated case patients healthy contacts. 
these strains classified 4 recombinant lineages showed complex
mosaic genomic structures originating different vaccine strain serotypes and
probably human enterovirus c (hev-c) species. genetic relatedness could be
observed among 4 lineages. vaccination coverage population 
low (<50%).
conclusions: broad distribution vdpvs province close
genetic relationship indicate intense rapid cocirculation coevolution 
the vaccine strains related hev-c strains. occurrence an
outbreak due vdpv 3 years previous outbreak indicates short
period low vaccination coverage enough create favorable conditions for
the emergence vdpv setting.
