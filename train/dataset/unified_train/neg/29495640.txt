two new secondary metabolites, labindole [2-methyl-3-(2-nitroethyl)-3h-indole] 
(1) labindole b [2-methyl-3-(2-nitrovinyl)-3h-indole] (2), isolated from
the myxobacterium labilithrixluteola (dsm 27648t). additionally, four metabolites
3, 4, 5 6 already known sources obtained. structures
were elucidated high resolution electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry
(hresims) 1d 2d nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy data and
their relative configuration assigned based nuclear overhauser effect
(noe) vicinal Â¹h-nmr coupling data. compounds tested biological
activities; labindoles (1) b (2) exhibited significant activity against
hepatitis c virus, 9h-carbazole (3), 3-chloro-9h-carbazole (4) and
4-hydroxymethyl-quinoline (5) showed antifungal activities. moreover, compound 3 
had weak moderate antibacterial activities, labindoles (1) b (2)
were devoid significant antifungal antibacterial effects.
