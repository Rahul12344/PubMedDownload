the era genomics allowed characterization phages use as
antimicrobials treat animal infections level precision never 
realized. research phage therapy conducted, several
advantages phage therapy realized, including ubiquitous nature, 
specificity, prevalence biosphere, low inherent toxicity phages,
which makes safe sustainable technology control animal
diseases. unique qualities phages led several opportunities with
respect emerging trends infectious disease treatment. however, the
opportunities tempered several challenges successful implementation
of phage therapy, fact individual phage infect one
or bacterial strains, meaning large numbers different phages will
likely needed treat infections caused multiple species bacteria. in
addition, phages effective enough reach site of
bacterial colonization, clearance immune system upon introduction to
the animal reality must overcome. finally, bacterial resistance to
the phages may develop, resulting treatment failure. even successful phage
infection lysis host consequences, large amounts of
endotoxin released upon lysis gram-negative bacteria, lead to
local systemic complications. overcoming challenges require
careful design development phage cocktails, including comprehensive
characterization phage host range assessment immunological risks
associated phage treatment.
