the recent discovery novel poxvirus [penguin-pox virus (ppv)] jackass
penguins offers potential unique candidate vaccine vector use in
mammals. infectivity studies therefore undertaken using number of
mammalian cell lines chick embryo fibroblasts (cef). shown the
simian cv-1 cell line able support replication ppv dna, no
infectious progeny virus could recovered infected cells. electron
microscopy used establish extent virus morphogenesis cv-1 cells 
as compared chorio-allantoic membranes (cams) hens' eggs and
cef cells. appears cv-1 cells able support partial maturation of
ppv, morphogenesis proceed stage mature infectious
particles. vaccinia virus promoters successful achieving transient gene
expression ppv-infected cells.
