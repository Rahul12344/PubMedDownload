the genetic polymorphism mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated in
seville, spain, studied using computer-assisted analysis is6110
fingerprint order determine current situation evaluate the
human-to-human transmission pathogen. one hundred seventy-six isolates
from 175 patients among 205 patients diagnosed tuberculosis (tb) 
a 3-year period (1993 1995) cultured analyzed. one hundred nine
patients (62%) infected genetically different isolates, 67 isolates
(38%) grouped 19 clusters. results demonstrate level 
clustering strains seville intermediate developed and
developing countries. epidemiological relatedness shown isolates from
only 10 clusters. active high transmission rates exist children
and human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected adults, in
non-hiv-infected adults transmission rate moderate. although transmission
from children adults uncommon, probability transmission from
hiv-infected patients young adults infected hiv may higher. the
basis observations, predict constant rise rate tb
transmission among hiv-infected patients probably young adult patients not
infected hiv measures effective prevention tb among the
hiv-infected population implemented.
