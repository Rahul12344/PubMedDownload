glycogen storage disease type ii (gsdii) caused lack functional
lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa). affected individuals store glycogen in
lysosomes beginning gestation, ultimately resulting fatal hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy respiratory failure. assessed utility of
recombinant adeno-associated virus (raav) vectors restore gaa activity vivo
in mouse model gsdii (gaa(-/-)). single systemic administration raav 
serotype 1 (raav1) vector neonate animals resulted restored cardiac gaa
activity 6.4 times normal level (mean=641+/-190% normal (gaa(+/+))
levels concomitant glycogen clearance) 11 months postinjection. greater
than 20% normal levels gaa activity also observed diaphragm and
quadriceps muscles. furthermore, functional correction soleus skeletal
muscle also observed compared age-matched untreated gaa(-/-) control
animals. results demonstrate raav1 vectors mediate sustained
therapeutic levels correction skeletal cardiac muscles model 
of fatal cardiomyopathy muscular dystrophy.
