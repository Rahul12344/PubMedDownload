it shown engraftment human peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbl)
from epstein-barr virus (ebv) seropositive donors c.b-17/scid mice is
associated high incidence human b cell tumors. recently, we
described new approach enabling engraftment human pbl normal strains of
mice rats receiving lethal split-dose radiation radioprotected scid
bone marrow. demonstrate that, contrast scid recipients human
pbl, balb/c c3h/hej recipients 50-100 x 10(6) human pbl develop
any ebv lymphoma 7-month follow-up period, successfully
engrafted human b cells. hand, lymphoma developed 90% 
of c.b-17/scid mice infused 70 x 10(6) human pbl donor.
likewise, 36% beige/nude/xid (bnx) mice, exposed 12 gy tbi, radioprotected 
with scid bone marrow transplanted human pbl developed lymphoma.
similar results obtained different strains infused pbl the
same donor. immunohistochemical analysis indicated tumor cells of
human b cell origin expressed ebv-encoded latent membrane protein-1 and
nuclear antigen 2. studies required understand the
mechanisms suppressed outgrowth ebv lymphoma human --> mouse
radiation chimera, compared human --> c.b-17/scid human --> bnx chimera,
this marked resistance offers new possibilities transplantation of
hematopoietic tissues cells ebv-positive donors.
