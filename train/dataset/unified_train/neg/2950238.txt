interaction mutant lambda repressors operator non-operator dna.

nelson hc, sauer rt.

we described set mutations alter side-chains operator
binding surface lambda repressor. paper, study interactions 
12 purified mutant repressors operator non-operator dna. mutant
proteins operator affinities reduced tenfold greater than
10,000-fold compared wild-type. nine mutants affinities for
non-operator dna similar wild-type, two mutants show decreased
non-specific binding, one mutant increased affinity non-operator dna.
we discuss findings terms structural energetic contributions 
of side-chain--dna interactions, show certain contacts the
repressor operator backbone contribute energy specificity the
interaction.
