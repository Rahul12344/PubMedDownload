recombinant adeno-associated viral (aav) vectors known safely and
efficiently transduce retina. among various aav serotypes available,
aav2/5 2/8 effective gene transfer photoreceptors (pr),
which relevant targets gene therapy inherited retinal
degenerations. however, search novel aav serotypes improved pr
transduction ongoing. work tested vectors derived five aav
serotypes isolated porcine tissues (referred porcine aavs, four of
which newly identified) ability transduce murine and
the cone-enriched pig retina. porcine aav vectors expressing egfp the
control cmv promoter injected subretinally either c57bl/6 mice 
large white pigs. resulting retinal tropism analyzed one month later on
histological sections, levels pr transduction assessed western
blot. results show porcine aav transduce murine porcine retinal 
pigment epithelium pr upon subretinal administration. aav2/po1 2/po5 
the efficient porcine aavs murine pr transduction exhibit the
strongest tropism pig cone pr. levels pr transduction obtained with
aav2/po1 2/po5 similar, albeit superior, obtained with
aav2/5 aav2/8, evinces aav2/po1 2/po5 promising vectors for
retinal gene therapy.
