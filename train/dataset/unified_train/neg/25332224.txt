a retrospective analysis 86 hiv-1 vertically-infected vietnamese children with
a follow-up period >24 months initiating antiretroviral therapy (art) was
performed 2008 2012, assess outcome first-line art in
resource-limited settings. 86 children, 68 (79.1%) treated
successfully (plasma hiv-1 viral load [vl] <1000 copies/ml), 63 (73.3%) had
full viral suppression (vl <400 copies/ml) 24 months art. significant
difference successfully treated patients failure groups observed 
in vl, cd4(+) t-cell count clinical stage baseline; age art start; or
art regimen. 14 children vl >5000 copies/ml, one four children with
vl 1000-5000 copies/ml none vl <1000 copies/ml developed reverse
transcriptase inhibitor (rti)-resistance mutations 24 months art. y181c and
m184v/i dominant non-nucleoside nucleoside rti-resistance
mutations, respectively (13/15, 86.7%). findings suggest vl testing
after 24 months art used efficiently differentiate art failures
among hiv-1 vertically-infected children resource-limited settings.
