the immunobiological effect rifamycins different experimental models has
been comparatively studied chickens mice using cyclophosphamide a
reference immunosuppressive agent. "in vivo" treatments rifampicin and
rifamycin sv diminished interferon levels chickens mice two hours
after virus challenge. mitogen induced blastogenesis significantly depressed 
by either "in vivo" (5-50 mg/kg) "in vitro" (5-20 micrograms/ml) drug
treatments, although activation b lymphocytes easily inhibited
than lymphocytes. primary anti-srbc immune responses suffered similar
immune suppressive action rifamycin treatments "in vivo". every case,
cyclophosphamide (10-20 micrograms/ml "in vitro" 25 mg/kg "in vivo") proved
to active immunosuppressant. hand, remarkable
parallelism effect rifamycins chickens mice observed 
the experimental systems used.
