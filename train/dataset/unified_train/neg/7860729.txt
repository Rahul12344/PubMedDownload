the participation il-2 insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes (iddm) was
analyzed transgenic (tg) mice expressing nucleoprotein (np) lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus il-2 control rat insulin promoter focally
in beta cells islets langerhans. insertion expression viral 
(self) gene il-2 gene alone lead iddm. infiltration
primarily cd4 b lymphocytes increased expression mhc class ii
molecules occurred islets il-2 expressed. contrast, neither
cellular infiltrates expression mhc class ii glycoproteins base
levels noted tgs expressing viral protein alone. double tg mice
expressing viral protein il-2 islets displayed modest
increase incidence spontaneous diabetes compared single
transgenic mice expressing il-2 alone. breaking immunological unresponsiveness
or sensitization self antigens occur. neither cytotoxic lymphocytes 
(ctl) antibodies directed viral tg (np) generated. however, 
after challenge lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, double tg mice developed
anti-self (viral) ctl iddm (incidence > 95%) within 2 mo. generation of
virus ("self")-specific mhc-restricted ctl dependent cd4+ help. in
contrast, viral inoculum single tg mice expressing either viral protein or
il-2 failed enhance incidence iddm 30% viral protein 10%
for il-2 8-mo observation period. hence, autoimmune model in
situ expression il-2 break unresponsiveness markedly enhanced
ongoing disease.
