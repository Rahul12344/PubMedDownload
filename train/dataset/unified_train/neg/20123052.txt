widespread vaccination programmes bluetongue virus serotype 8 (btv-8),
using inactivated vaccines, carried across many countries in
northern, western southern europe. study investigates extent and
length colostral antibody protection, well degree colostral
antibody induced interference immune response btv-8, sheep.
significantly lower titres neutralising antibodies transferred in
colostrum lambs born sheep vaccinated opposed vaccinated
twice (single vaccine first year booster vaccine second
year). btv-8 challenge, lambs born sheep vaccinated two occasions,
with second booster vaccine given approximately 1 month prior lambing,
were protected clinical disease 14 weeks. btv-8 isolated 
5 22 challenged lambs, although one lambs showed transient
rise body temperature clinical signs. lambs born ewes given
a second booster vaccine 1 month prior lambing, likely protected
from clinical disease least 14 weeks, whereas lambs born ewes
vaccinated likely protected shorter time. colostral
antibodies present 13-14-week-old lambs appeared interfere the
humoral response challenge virus. results suggest colostral
antibodies may interfere vaccination lambs least 14 weeks of
age.
