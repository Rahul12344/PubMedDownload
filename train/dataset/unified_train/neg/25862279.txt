duck hepatitis virus (dhv) acute highly contagious disease ducklings
caused three distinct serotypes duck hepatitis virus (dhav), member 
the rna family picornaviridae, serotype 1 widespread serotype
worldwide. date, little known prevalence genetic
characterisation dhav outside asia. current study describes surveillance
on dhv 46 commercial duck farms egypt history high mortality in
young ducklings 3 15 day-old 2012 2014. clinical samples were
examined generic rt-pcr assays followed partial sequence analysis the
5'utr, vp1 3d genes vaccine strain 15 field viruses. overall
positive rate 37% (n=17/46). duck breeds (pekin, muscovy, mallard and
green winged) susceptible disease mortality ranged 15% to
96.7%. sequence phylogenetic analyses indicated egyptian strains
cluster dhav serotype 1 asian viruses distinguishable the
vaccine strains. far, first report genetic characterisation
of dhav egypt. study may useful better understand epidemiology 
and evolution dhav.
