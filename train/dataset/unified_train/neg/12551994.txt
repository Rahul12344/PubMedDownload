the coxsackie b virus adenovirus receptor (car) member the
immunoglobulin superfamily. addition activity viral receptor, may
play role cellular adhesion. asked determines cell membrane
microdomain car. found car localized novel lipid-rich
microdomain similar low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) but
distinct car variant exhibited traditional lipid raft
localization via fusion glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi) tail. the
cytoplasmic tail determines membrane localization, since deletion this
domain resulted mislocalization. results indicate car, car-ldlr, ldlr
reside novel lipid raft distinct caveolin-1-containing caveolae
and gpi-linked proteins. residence lipid-rich domain provides mechanism
that allows car interact cell adhesion proteins yet function as
an adenovirus receptor.
