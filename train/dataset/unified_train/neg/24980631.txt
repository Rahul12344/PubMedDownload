fifty-three hbv-dna-positive patients symptomatic acute hepatitis b were
enrolled 1999 2010 evaluate molecular phylogenetic changes hbv 
in southern italy. hbv polymerase region evaluated direct sequencing in
plasma samples obtained first observation. different data sets aligned
and phylogenetic tree inferred using phyml program. statistical robustness 
was confirmed bootstrap analysis. bayesian markov chain monte carlo
method bayesian skyline plot used estimate evolution our
samples. dn/ds rate (ω) estimated maximum likelihood approach to
investigate presence codons positive selection. macclade program
was used test viral gene out/in flow among hbv-d3 subgenotype patients
with different risk factors. 53 patients, 83% born italy 17%
were foreigners. hbv genotype prevalent (64.1%), followed genotype a
(26.4%), e (3.8%), f (5.7%). prevalent subgenotype d3 (70.6%). the
bayesian tree 24 d3 subgenotypes showed two main clades dated 1994;
40% viral gene flow observed intravenous drugs users heterosexual
patients. phylogenetic analysis hbv isolates showed hbv-d3 remains the
prevalent genotype, also subgenotype a2 become frequent southern
italy. may clinical relevance years come, since patients with
hbv-genotype-a chronic infection less frequently genotype d
develop hbeag-negative chronic hepatitis respond frequently to
alfa-interferon treatment.
