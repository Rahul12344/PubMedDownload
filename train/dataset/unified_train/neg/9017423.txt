in relevant diseases, permanent systemic delivery therapeutic
protein engineered cells might proposed secretion levels be
regulated. tetracycline resistance operon escherichia coli provides a
transcriptional regulatory system effective mammalian cells, could be
used purpose. chimeric transactivator (tta) consisting the
tetracycline repressor fused transactivation domain herpes simplex 
virus vp16 protein stimulates transcription binding minimal cytomegalovirus 
(cmv) promoter containing repeats tetracycline operator (teto-cmv).
binding abolished tetracycline, thus impairing promoter activation. have
transduced c2.7 myoblasts two u3-deleted retroviral vectors containing these
regulatory elements. tetp-epo vector expressed murine erythropoietin
(epo) cdna control teto-cmv promoter. d-de-tta vector
expressed tta control muscle-specific human desmin
enhancer-promoter. northern blot analysis showed background epo mrna expression
in myoblasts. myotubes differentiation induced tta expression, leading a
28-fold increase epo mrnas, suppressed tetracycline. basal epo
secretion myoblasts increased 23- 41-fold formation of
multinucleated myotubes, turned back close myoblast level when
tetracycline added. myoblasts transduced vectors treated with
mitomycin aim prevent tumor formation engrafted skeletal
muscles syngeneic c3h mice. hematocrit levels significantly higher in
animals bearing cells transduced vectors control animals
grafted cells transduced epo vector only. difference was
abolished tetracycline given mice. data indicate the
tetracycline regulatory elements modulate transcription context of
retroviral vector genomes, system used control in
vivo delivery therapeutic protein genetically modified muscles.
