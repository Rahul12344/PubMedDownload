the influence human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection adult bl in
kenya, conducted national prevalence survey patients 16 years age 
and older bl. systematic review medical records patients

based confirmed review pathological material time original
diagnosis. hiv serology confirmed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(elisa). twenty-nine adult patients bl identified 5-year
study period. patients, 17 (59%) males, 12 (41%) females, 
the median age 26 years. nineteen patients (66%) bl were
hiv-seropositive. proportion men similar hiv-seropositive and
-seronegative patients (58% vs 60%). hiv-seropositive bl patients were
significantly older seronegatives (median 35 vs 19.5 years, p < 0.001).
hiv-seropositive patients uniformly presented constitutional b symptoms
and advanced bl accompanied diffuse lymph node involvement, whereas the
clinical presentation hiv-seronegative patients time period was
reminiscent "typical" endemic pattern disease complete sparing 
peripheral lymph nodes. overall survival hiv-seropositive cases was
significantly worse hiv-seronegative cases; median survival in
the hiv-seropositive patients 15 weeks. approximate 3-fold
increase incidence adult bl time period study, which
is attributable aids epidemic. setting, patients often present
with disseminated disease, diffuse peripheral lymphadenopathy fever, the
latter two heretofore commonly associated with
non-lymphoproliferative disorders mycobacterium tuberculosis sexually
transmitted diseases kenya. observations warrant inclusion of
aids-related bl differential diagnosis adult patient with
