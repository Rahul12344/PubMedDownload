the chemokine-like, secreted protein product u83 gene human
herpesvirus 6, named vccl4, chemically synthesized characterized
in complete library 18 known human chemokine receptors expressed
individually stably transfected cell lines. vccl4 found cause calcium
mobilization efficiently endogenous chemokine ligand ccl2 the
ccr2 receptor, whereas virally encoded chemokine affect the
other 17 human chemokine receptors tested. mutual cross-desensitization between
ccl2 vccl4 demonstrated ccr2-transfected cells. affinity of
vccl4 ccr2 receptor 79 nm determined competition binding
against radioactively labeled ccl2. murine pre-b lymphocyte cell line l1.2
stably transfected ccr2 receptor, vccl4 acted relatively low
potency highly efficacious chemoattractant equally efficacious 
in causing cell migration ccl2 ccl7 considerably efficacious
than ccl8 ccl13. concluded human herpesvirus 6 encodes highly
selective efficacious ccr2 agonist, attract ccr2 expressing cells,
for example macrophages monocytes, conceivably virus infect to
establish latency in. suggested vccl4 reactivation virus
in example monocyte-derived microglia could perhaps involved the
pathogenesis ccr2-dependent disease, multiple sclerosis.
