background: use non-invasive ventilation (niv) acute hypoxemic
respiratory failure (ahrf) due h1n1 virus infection controversial. 
multicenter study aimed assess efficacy niv avoiding endotracheal
intubation (eti) identify predictors success failure.
methods: prospective multicenter study, 98 patients new pulmonary
infiltrate(s) sustained h1n1 virus pao(2)/fio2<300 eligible for
study; 38/98 required immediate eti, others received niv first
line therapy; 13/60 patients failed niv intubated 5.8+5.5 hours
from enrolment. remaining 47/60 patients successfully ventilated with
niv.
results: hospital mortality significantly higher patients failed
niv vs. succeeded (53.8% vs. 2.1%; or=0.52, p<0.001). eti was
associated higher number infectious complications, mainly sepsis and
septic shock. one events niv failure group vs.
niv success 16.7, p<0.001. according logistic regression model, saps
ii>29 pao(2)/fio(2)≤127 admission pao2/fio(2)≤149 1 hr niv 
were independently associated need eti.
conclusion: early application niv, aim avoid invasive
ventilation, h1n1 pandemics associated overall success
rate 47/98 (48%). patients presenting admission high saps ii score 
and low pao(2)/fio(2) ratio and/or unable promptly correct gas exchange 
at high risk intubation mortality.
