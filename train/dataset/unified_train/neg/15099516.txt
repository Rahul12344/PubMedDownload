an ultrafast uv laser crosslinking assay provided novel insights the
progression swi/snf-mediated chromatin-remodeling reaction and
transcription factor binding real time. demonstrate site-specific
crosslinking glucocorticoid receptor (gr), hswi/snf
chromatin-remodeling complex, mouse mammary tumor virus (mmtv) promoter
assembled array correctly positioned nucleosomes. gr first demonstrates 
rapid binding promoter actively displaced template
during remodeling reaction. displacement reaction requires hswi/snf 
complex atp, specific nucleoprotein template, accompanied by
a core histone rearrangement. hswi/snf complex associates random
positions chromatin template absence gr recruited
specifically b/c region gr included. results indicate that
enhancement hswi/snf-mediated factor accessibility, hallmark chromatin
remodeling, cases transient, reversible, periodic.
