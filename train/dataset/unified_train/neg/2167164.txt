neoplastic transformation rat liver cells vitro dna-mediated gene
transfer oncogene, hhcm, derived human (mahlavu) hepatocellular
carcinoma, described compared nih3t3 cells. hhcm cloned
in neomycin-resistant simian virus 40 promoter vector (pneor/s) was
designated pnrpm-1. brl-1 nih3t3 cells, transfected pnrpm-1 dna, showed
significant morphological changes, loss contact inhibition, and
anchorage-independent growth. became highly tumorigenic nude rats and
nu/nu mice. control brl-1 nih3t3 cells, whether transfected pneor/s dna 
or not, remained contact inhibited nontumorigenic. transformants and
the tumor cells contained integrated hhcm dna shown southern blot
hybridization. complete nucleotide sequence hhcm 3.0-kilobase dna 
also determined, consisted possible open reading frame protein 
of 52 kilodaltons (467 amino acids). high-level production slightly
modified form 52-kilodalton protein bacterial expression system 
been successfully achieved. bacteria-produced protein similar in
electrophoretic behavior 52- 53-kilodalton protein synthesized a
cell-free translation system using rabbit reticulocyte lysate programmed with
hybrid-selected hhcm-specific mrna mahlavu hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
