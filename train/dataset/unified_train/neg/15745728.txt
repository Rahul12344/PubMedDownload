background: centers disease control prevention guidelines recommend
human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) counseling, testing, referral all
patients hospitals hiv prevalence >or=1%. 1% screening
threshold critically examined since hiv became effectively treatable
in 1995. objective evaluate clinical effect cost-effectiveness
of current guidelines alternate hiv prevalence thresholds.
methods: performed cost-effectiveness analysis using computer simulation
model hiv screening disease applied inpatients u.s. hospitals.
results: undiagnosed inpatient hiv prevalence 1% overall
participation rate 33%, hiv screening increased mean quality-adjusted life
expectancy 6.13 years per 1000 inpatients, cost-effectiveness ratio 
35,400 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (qaly) gained. expansion of
screening settings prevalence low 0.1% increased ratio to
64,500 dollars per qaly gained. increasing counseling testing costs 53
dollars 103 dollars per person still yielded cost-effectiveness ratio 
100,000 dollars per qaly gained prevalence undiagnosed infection 0.1%.
conclusion: routine inpatient hiv screening programs cost-effective 
but would likely remain prevalence undiagnosed hiv infection 10 times 
lower recommended thresholds. current hiv counseling, testing, and
referral guidelines implemented nationwide way linking
infected patients life-sustaining care.
