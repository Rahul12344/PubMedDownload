we analysed clinical pathologic features 42 patients with
immunologically confirmed peripheral t-cell lymphoma. median age 60 years
and male female ratio 1:1. prior lymphoproliferative autoimmune
disorder present 14 per cent patients. signs advanced disease
were usually present onset, b symptoms (55 per cent),
generalized lymphadenopathy (57 per cent), stage iii/iv disease (62 per cent),
and elevated levels serum lactate dehydrogenase (68 per cent). primary
extranodal disease (14 per cent), hepatomegaly (12 per cent), splenomegaly (12
per cent), lung/pleural involvement (12 per cent), skin involvement (21 per
cent), bone marrow involvement (28 per cent) uncommon. lymphocytopenia
was present 64 per cent patients, none nine patients tested were
serologically positive human t-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus (htlv-i)
infection. among 38 patients receiving combination chemotherapy, 20 (53 per cent)
achieved complete remission. actuarial median survival patients 
17 months. age greater 60 years stage iii/iv disease predicted poor
clinical outcome, whereas large cell histological subtype predicted a
favourable outcome. prospective clinical studies using uniform treatments a
uniform histologic classification scheme needed confirm findings.
