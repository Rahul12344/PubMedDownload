we cloned sequenced cdna drosophila melanogaster encodes a
protein homologous peritrophins, family chitin-binding proteins 
the peritrophic matrix insects. unexpectedly, gene, gasp, expressed 
the embryonic tracheae. suggest family proteins may present in
other tissues peritrophic matrix, particularly nutrient gas
exchange important, and/or invasion parasites viruses is
possible. also mapped two similar genes sequenced the
berkeley drosophila genome project, find three similar genes 
are clustered, located three different chromosomes.
