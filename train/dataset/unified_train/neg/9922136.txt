the retroviral nucleocapsid (nc) protein multifunctional protein essential
for rna genome packaging viral infectivity. nc protein, ncp8, the
human immunodeficiency virus type-ii (hiv-2) 49 amino acid peptide
containing two zinc fingers, type c-x2-c-x4-h-x4-c, connected seven
amino acid residues, called "basic amino acid cluster." shown
that n-terminal zinc finger flanked basic amino acid cluster the
minimal active domain specific binding viral rna functions. 
however, structure-activity relationships ncp8 investigated 
in detail. present study, three-dimensional structure 29 amino
acid peptide, including minimal active domain (ncp8-fl), determined by
two-dimensional 1h nmr spectroscopy simulated annealing calculations. a
total 15 converged structures ncp8-fl obtained basis 355
experimental constraints, including 343 distance constraints obtained from
nuclear overhauser effect connectivities, 12 torsion angle (phi, chi1)
constraints, four constraints zinc binding. root-mean-square
deviation 15 converged structures 0.29 +/- 0.04 backbone
atoms (n, c(alpha), c) 1.27 +/- 0.13 heavy atoms. interestingly,
the basic amino acid cluster defined well, loop-like
conformation three arginine residues cluster one arginine
residue zinc finger located approximately plane the
molecule exposed solvent. structure-activity relationships are
discussed basis comparison well-defined structure with
those nc proteins.
