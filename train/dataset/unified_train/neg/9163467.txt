we present data clinical trial study automated version
(galileo) previously described q-beta replicase-amplified probe assay (j. s.
shah et al., j. clin. microbiol. 33:1435-1441, 1995) used direct
detection mycobacterium tuberculosis complex sputum. assay designed
to target specific regions 23s rrna found m. tuberculosis, mycobacterium
bovis, mycobacterium africanum, mycobacterium microti sensitivity
ranging approximately <10 300 cfu. assay tested for
cross-hybridization using large numbers (e.g., 10(5)to 10(10) cfu/assay) of
133 organisms commonly found respiratory tract samples, including non-m.
tuberculosis mycobacterium spp., bacteria, fungi, viruses. these
competitors tested negative assay. automated assay results 780
respiratory tract samples (sputum bronchoalveolar lavage specimens) collected 
and tested three trial sites united states) compared the
results culture acid-fast microscopy. aliquots conventionally digested 
and decontaminated sputum pellets heated 100 degrees c mechanically
disrupted prior hybridization background reduction, amplification, and
detection closed disposable test pack. pertinent elements individual
patient histories relating tuberculosis exposure, previous active disease,
antituberculosis therapy status, etc., considered resolution of
discrepant results 48 (assay false-positive) samples. seventy-one 90
(78.9%) culture-positive samples positive tested galileo assay, 
while 7% culture-negative samples assay positive, corresponding a
sensitivity 79% specificity 93%. following resolution discrepant
results chart review, sensitivity specificity q-beta replicase
amplification assay galileo analyzer 84 97%, respectively. a
total 69.2% smear-negative (culture positive) samples detected 
assay. ten test packs time automatically processed galileo
analyzer without operator intervention following loading samples. first
result reported approximately 3 h, last result available in
6.5 h. knowledge, first report clinical study a
fully automated amplification probe hybridization assay detection of
pathogens directly clinical specimen.
