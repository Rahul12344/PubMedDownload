objective: screen efficient sirna inhibiting hepatitis b virus using the
technique pcr-based trna(val) pol iii-shrna expression cassettes (secs).
methods: based core gene sequence hbv, five target sites sirna were
designed. trnaval pol iii-shrna expression cassettes produced one-step
overlapping extension pcr strategy co-transfected hbv c gene and
pc-egfp plasmid ad293 cells respectively. forty-eight hours after
transfection, fluorescence hbvc-gfp protein detected by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (facs); hbv c mrna detected by
semi-quantitative rt-pcr. hbv-producing hepg2. 2. 15 cells transfected 
selected secs 72 h, hbsag hbeag cell culture medium detected 
by radioimmunoassay assay (ria). hbv pgrna cell total rna detected by
semi-quantitative pcr.
result: co-transfection pc-gfp plasmid secs ad293 cells resulted in
inhibition expression hbv c gene decrease egfp fluorescence intensity. 
sec-492i showed significant inhibition effect hbv c-egfp expression
compared secs. selected sec-492i sec-282i targeting core gene could
efficiently decrease expression hbeag level hbv pgrna a
dose-dependent manner. sec-492i inhibited hbv replication antigen expression 
in efficient way sec-282i final concentration.
conclusion: expressed shrna, targets sites hbv c mrna 492i, to
have efficient rnai effect. trnaval pol iii-shrna expression
cassettes produced one-step overlapping extension pcr strategy be
useful identification optimal sirna.
