african horse sickness virus (ahsv) orbivirus usually transmitted
between equid hosts adult culicoides midges. article, review
the ways ahsv may adapted mode transmission. ahsv
particle modified ph proteolytic enzymes immediate
environment, altering ability infect different cell types. degree of
pathogenesis host vector may also represent adaptations maximising the
likelihood successful vectorial transmission. however, speculation upon
several adaptations vectorial transmission based upon research related 
viruses bluetongue virus (btv), direct studies ahsv are
required order improve understanding important virus.
