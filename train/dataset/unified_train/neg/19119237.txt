most pathogens require relatively long period development mosquito 
vector transmitted new human host; hence, older
insects epidemiological importance. successful transfer a
life-shortening strain inherited bacterial symbiont, wolbachia, the
major mosquito vector dengue, aedes aegypti, halved adult life span under
laboratory conditions. association stable, wolbachia strain is
maternally inherited high frequency. capable inducing complete
cytoplasmic incompatibility, facilitate invasion natural
field populations persistence time. data suggest targeting 
mosquito age inherited wolbachia infections may viable strategy to
reduce transmission pathogens dengue viruses.
