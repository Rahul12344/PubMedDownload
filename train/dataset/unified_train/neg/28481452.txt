background & aims: viral hepatitis major public health challenge egypt
but little known epidemiology hepatitis b virus (hbv)
infection, geographical distribution, risk factors infection the
egyptian context. study addresses deficit using data nationally 
representative survey.
methods: cross-sectional analysis data gathered men women aged 15-59 
in egypt health issues survey (ehis) 2015, including logistic regression to
evaluate contribution different factors risk hbv infection. was
supplemented spatial analysis distribution acute chronic hbv
infection governorate level, ecological relationship hbv and
hcv infections.
results: population hbv prevalence 1.4% (95% confidence interval [ci]
1.2-1.6), hbv-hcv co-infection rate 0.06%. spatial analysis showed
localisation hbv infected individuals primarily urban areas upper egypt 
(in contrast hcv prevalence highest rural lower egypt), and
those early middle age (adjusted odds ratio [aor] 3.32, 95% ci: 1.66-6.63).
hbv positive status among household members emerged powerful driver of
infection risk analysis (aor=10.75, 95% ci: 4.98-23.24).
conclusion: spatial distribution hbv infection egypt differs markedly 
hcv co-infection rates low. within-household transmissions appear be
particularly important explaining persistence hbv infection the
general population. prevention strategies focus urban upper egypt, 
particularly households documented cases infection.
