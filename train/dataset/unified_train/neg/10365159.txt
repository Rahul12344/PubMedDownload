coinfection farm-reared salmonids involving two viruses described,
but report interactions viruses. examine
whether infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (ipnv) strain sp interferes the
growth infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (ihnv) strain s46, coinfected
isolate rainbow trout. bf-2 cell culture inoculated s46 the
infective titer ihnv fraction decreased 3 log10 units compared the
growth curve ihnv single infection. rt-pcr assay confirmed this
reduction, successive passages co-infected sample led a
decrease ihnv mrna absence specific pcr product ihnv. flow 
cytometry showed 13% cells inoculated s46 strain were
infected ihnv 48-72 h post infection, contrast 50-80% cells 
that positive ipnv. exposure cells ihnv 24 h infection 
with ipnv affect infective titers either virus pcr results 
obtained simultaneous coinfections. moreover ihnv inhibited the
ipnv inoculum reduced. so, multiplicity infection dependence was
demonstrated ipnv-ihnv interference; rt-pcr assay described was
found suitable technique identifying studying dual viral
infections.
