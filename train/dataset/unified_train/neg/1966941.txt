the combination mutant el-4 thymoma cells epstein-barr virus
(ebv)-infection activation human b lymphocytes studied two
approaches: a) limiting numbers b cells first activated el-4 contact
in order expand b cell population infected ebv. results show
that ebv could induce ig synthesis, although unable determine
proliferation generate immortalized lines el-4 activated cells. b)
el-4 cells compared conventional pbm feeders cultures of
established lymphoblastoid cell lines (lcl) low cell densities. el-4 feeder
activity strictly dependent presence phorbol-myristate-acetate
(pma) supernatant stimulated t-lymphocytes (t-sn). el-4 feeders induced 
earlier proliferation peak greater ig synthesis lcl. latter effect
could also mediated addition pma t-sn, even cooperating
cell-to-cell signal pma t-sn-sensitized-el-4 cells could excluded. 
altogether results indicate el-4 cells represent clear advantage
over classic pbm feeders cultures established lcl low cell
densities.
