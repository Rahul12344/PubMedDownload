reactivation resolved hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection increasingly
recognized patients severe immunosuppression. monitored seven patients
with pretransplant antibodies hepatitis b surface antigen (anti-hbs) and
hepatitis b core antigen (anti-hbc) hbv reactivation allogeneic
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-hsct). reverse seroconversion
(from anti-hbs hbsag) observed six recipients occurring 12, 14, 16, 22,
31 39 months allo-hsct, respectively. patient without hbv
reactivation highest pretransplant anti-hbs titre died the
shortest follow-up period (25 months). novel hbv surface mutant (d144g/g145e)
was isolated one recipient stem cells donor vaccinated against
hbv. another surface mutant (p142l/g145r) detected recipient a
non-immune donor. serum alt elevation measured two six
patients viral reactivation, followed spontaneous clearance hbsag in
one them. antiviral treatment reduced viral load five patients, the
emergence ymdd motif polymerase mutations resulted lamivudine resistance in
two patients. conclusion, risk reactivation resolved hbv infection
is close 100% allogeneic stem cell recipients vaccination donor 
does always warrant reliable protection.
