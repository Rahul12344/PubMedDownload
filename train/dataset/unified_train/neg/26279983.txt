highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv) infection widely available industrialized countries since 1996;
its widespread use determined dramatic decline acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (aids)-related mortality, consequently, significant decrease of
aids-defining cancers. however increased mean age hiv-infected patients,
prolonged exposure environmental lifestyle cancer risk factors, and
coinfection oncogenic viruses contributed emergence other
malignancies considered non-aids-defining cancers (nadcs) relevant 
fraction morbidity mortality among hiv-infected people twenty years 
haart introduction. role immunosuppression pathogenesis nadcs is
not well defined, future researches investigate etiology nadcs.
in last years growing evidence intensive chemotherapy
regimens radiotherapy could safely administrated hiv-positive patients 
while continuing haart. requires multidisciplinary approach close
co-operation oncologists hiv-physicians order best manage compliance
of patients treatment face drug-related side effects. review
the main epidemiological features, risk factors clinical behavior more
common nadcs, lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer
and anal cancer, hodgkin's lymphoma cutaneous malignancies, focusing
also current therapeutic approaches preventive screening strategies.
