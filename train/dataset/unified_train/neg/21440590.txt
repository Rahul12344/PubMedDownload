hepatitis e acute hepatitis caused infection hepatitis e virus (hev) via
a fecal-to-oral zoonotic route. hev small, non-enveloped virus containing
positive strand rna genome. recently, three-dimensional structures of
the hev-like particles spike domain protruded surface the
particle expressed recombinant baculovirus bacteria revealed.
based reports, structural features hev capsid subunit and
viral particle reviewed give insights mechanisms underlying the
particle assembly, antigenicity, host cell attachment native virion
packaging.
