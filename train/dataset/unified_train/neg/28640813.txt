sjögren's syndrome (ss) common, autoimmune exocrinopathy distinguished by
keratoconjunctivitis sicca xerostomia. patients frequently develop serious
complications including lymphoma, pulmonary dysfunction, neuropathy, vasculitis, 
and debilitating fatigue. dysregulation type interferon (ifn) pathway a
prominent feature ss correlated increased autoantibody titers 
disease severity. identify genetic determinants ifn pathway dysregulation
in ss, performed cis-expression quantitative trait locus (eqtl) analyses
focusing differentially expressed type ifn-inducible transcripts identified 
through transcriptome profiling study. multiple cis-eqtls associated 
transcript levels 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (oas1) peaking at
rs10774671 (peqtl = 6.05 × 10-14). association rs10774671 ss
susceptibility identified confirmed meta-analysis two
independent cohorts (pmeta = 2.59 × 10-9; odds ratio = 0.75; 95% confidence
interval = 0.66-0.86). risk allele rs10774671 shifts splicing oas1 from
production p46 isoform multiple alternative transcripts, including p42,
p48, p44. found isoforms differentially expressed within
each genotype controls patients without autoantibodies.
furthermore, results showed three alternatively spliced isoforms
lacked translational response type ifn stimulation. p48 p44 isoforms
also impaired protein expression governed 3' end transcripts.
the ss risk allele rs10774671 shown others associated with
reduced oas1 enzymatic activity ability clear viral infections, well as
reduced responsiveness ifn treatment. results establish oas1 risk
locus ss support potential role defective viral clearance due to
altered ifn response genetic pathophysiological basis complex
autoimmune disease.
