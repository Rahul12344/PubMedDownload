this review summarizes present understanding biology cd4 cells
during acute memory phases response nonpersisting viral
infection. elucidating precise role cd4 cells viral infections has
been challenge due characteristics intrinsic cd4 response the
slow development tools allow accurate identification the
virus-specific cells vitro vivo. especially apparent in
comparison antiviral cd8 cells, immunologists possess many tools
for tracking cells throughout response. however, recent developments in
technology follow antigen-specific cd4 cells virus infections have
improved understanding greatly. ex vivo technologies the
enzyme-linked spot forming assays recently fluorospot assays,
cytokine capture advent class ii major histocompatibility complex
multimers improved ability accurately enumerate virus-specific
cd4 t-cell response. development virus-primed t-cell receptor transgenic
cd4 cells imaging technologies take advantage allotype marking 
luciferase fluorescent transgenes allow high-resolution tracking of
virus-specific cd4 cells many tissues. inspite new technologies,
many questions remain regarding dynamics cd4 memory t-cell populations and
their contribution immune protection viral infections.
