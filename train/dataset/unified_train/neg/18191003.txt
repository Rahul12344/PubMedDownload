previous studies found close correlation epitope density and
epitope-specific response, shown high epitope density single
recombinant protein molecule significantly enhances humoral response and
protective immunity. however, determined whether kind of
high epitope density could also significantly influence cell response. based on
this, series recombinant dna proteins designed prepared. each
molecule consists various copy numbers v3 ctl epitope hiv-1 gp120
(one, two, four eight copies). results show clearly different
v3-epitope densities one single dna protein molecules have
respectively different effects number activity primary and
memory cells. interestingly, effect complex b
cells: epitope density one plasmid protein antigen affects number, 
the cytotoxic avidity, primary cd8+ cells, affects number and
cytotoxic avidity memory cd8+ cells. indicates epitope density the
antigen important consideration optimize cell response induction and
may facilitate development effective cell-based anti-virus vaccines.
