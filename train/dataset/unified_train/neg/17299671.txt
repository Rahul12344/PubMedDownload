introduction: media reports norovirus outbreaks, especially hospitals
and nursing homes, accumulated past years. reasons this
increasing problem manifold: resistance common disinfectants, high 
level contagion (a dose less 100 particles may infective);
variability virus-genome documented polymerase chain reaction-studies, 
as well factors concerning modern life-style. following study
describes analyses norovirus outbreak sro-hospital langenthal from
november 25, 2003, december 31, 2003.
patients methods: case definition included sudden vomiting diarrhoea,
abdominal cramps, fever 38.5 degrees c recovery 48 hours. stool
cultures taken tested bacteria (campylobacter jejuni, salmonella and
shigella species) rotaviruses. stool vomit specimens tested
using real time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) noroviruses using
different primer sets. epidemiological data gained transmission
modus person-to-person food-borne.
results: total 77 persons affected viral disease. two
incidence-peaks gastroenteritis noted. first peak happened the
geriatric ward second geographically distinct department of
internal medicine. existence new norovirus strain genogroup ii/4 
been confirmed cdc enteric viruses branch atlanta, ga. measures 
be taken pointed out.
conclusions: norovirus gastroenteritis outbreak intensity extent as
described thus far occurred hospital's history. strains newly 
found sequencing associated genogroup ii/4. genogroup caused a
striking increase gastroenteritis outbreaks europe year 2002
including atypical spring summer peaks. new variant supposed be
more virulent environmentally stable previous strains [21].
preventive measures agreement published guidelines were
taken viral pathogen identified rt-pcr. obvious emerging
problem norovirus infections society economic data analysing
the costs caused lost bed days staff absence make epidemiological
investigation outbreaks application molecular tests important.
they basis determining transmission routes characterising the
different strains order improve preventive strategies.
