coded sera 54 patients african burkitt's lymphoma (bl) titrated
for antibodies epstein-barr virus (ebv)-induced membrane antigen in
the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (adcc) assay. titers then
correlated progression lymphoma growth following chemotherapy. 74%
of patients high adcc titers (greater 3,840), lymphomas showed
partial complete regression following therapy. medium-titered group
(240-3,840), 36% lymphomas showed response therapy, 29%
of lymphomas low group (less 240) responded treatment. these
preliminary results indicated that, previously reported patients with
nasopharyngeal carcinoma, adcc titers may prognotic value patients with
this ebv-associated disease. attempt determine identity adcc 
antigen, sera examined antibody four major ma
components far identified membrane ebv-infected raji cells. sera
with high adcc titers general contained antibody four major ma
components, low-titered sera usually contained antibody three less of
these proteins. exceptions pattern, however, indicating that
the adcc antigen might differ four ebv-induced membrane components so
far identified.
