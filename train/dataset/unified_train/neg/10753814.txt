virus structures continue basis mechanistic virology serve a
paradigm solutions problems concerning macromolecular assembly and
function general. use x-ray crystallography, electron cryomicroscopy
and computational biochemical methods provided details the
structural folds individual viral components, also insights the
structural basis assembly, nucleic acid packaging, particle dynamics and
interactions cellular molecules.
