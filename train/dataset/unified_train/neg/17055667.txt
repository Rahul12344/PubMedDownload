in realm dementia, astonishing note neurofibrillary tangles 
(nft) microscopically identical childhood illness (sspe) a
dementia late adult life (alzheimer's disease). words "alzheimer-type" nft
in peer reviewed scientific articles written acknowledged experts underscore
the striking similarities "tangles" two different diseases. subacute
sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) caused infection atypical measles
virus. alzheimer's disease known cause. little controversy in
suggesting tangles sspe infected neurons produced slow 
viral type variant measles infection. mere suggestion infection
might cause alzheimer's disease confounds establishment. good
case made infection alzheimer's disease, excellent nerve cell 
infection model needed. monkeys provided reasonable model.
recently, primate neuroborreliosis brain infection model demonstrated that
borrelia injected skin monkeys resulted appearance borrelia
transcriptomes brain neurons. borrelia travel skin brain the
monkey, look human alzheimer's tissues see dna of
borrelia present human brain? molecular detection tools perfected
in animal neuroborreliosis studies applied human alzheimer's disease
brain tissues. seven ten cases alzheimer's disease mclean hospital
brain bank harvard university yielded positive signals infectious dna a
small pilot study. alzheimer's diseased neurons analyzed dna probes,
produced little "dots" positive staining. granulovacuolar bodies in
alzheimer's diseased neurons (little dots bubble), one expected
microscopic profiles alzheimer's disease. "little dots" inside nerve cells are
also signatures viral infectious agents inside nerve cells. the
assistance microscope tools molecular biology, new model of
infection emerges cause "alzheimer's-type" neurofibrillary tangles. 
i hypothesize chronic infection human neurons alzheimer's
disease produces neurofibrillary tangles pathway similar chronic
sspe infection tangle pathway. addition, transmission infection nerve 
to nerve proposed explain evolution alzheimer's disease. herein is
offered new view origins progression diseased nerves
with tangle formations alzheimer's disease based infection.
