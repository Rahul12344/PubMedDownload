data 255 scottish beef suckler herds 189 scottish dairy herds surveyed
as part national bovine viral diarrhoea virus (bvdv) prevalence studies from
october 2006 may 2008 examined retrospectively determine the
relationship serological status key performance indicators derived
from national cattle movement records. average, calf mortality rates 1.35
percentage points higher seropositive beef herds 3.05 percentage points
higher seropositive dairy herds negative control herds. seropositive
beef herds also likely show increases calf mortality rates and
culling rates successive years. discernible effects bvdv
on average age first calving calving interval either herd type.
accompanying questionnaire data revealed 27% beef farmers 25% of
dairy farmers seropositive herds thought cattle affected bvdv,
which suggests clinical effects exposure may inapparent under
field conditions masked causes reproductive failure culling.
beef farmers significantly likely perceive problem herd
experienced acute changes calf mortality rates, culling rates, calving
intervals successive years. however, 35% perceived positive
herds actually seropositive bvdv. findings emphasize the
importance routinely screening herds determine true infection status 
and potential using national cattle movement records identify herds
that may experiencing outbreaks bvdv infectious diseases that
impact herd performance.
