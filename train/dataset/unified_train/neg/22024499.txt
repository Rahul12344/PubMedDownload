objective: toll-like receptors, major component innate immune system,
play important role initial response pathogens. genetic
abnormalities receptors like tlr2, tlr3 tlr4 associated
with susceptibility fungal viral infections aberrations tlr
genes tlr3, tlr7 tlr9 may predispose autoimmunity. recently we
have shown association tlr3 receptor variant, l412f, susceptibility to
chronic candidiasis, recurrent viral bacterial infections autoimmunity.
we investigated biological implications tlr3 mutant.
methods: study functional impact l412f variant tlr3 tested
patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) well fibroblasts for
secretion cytokines response tlr3 ligand, candida cytomegalovirus
(cmv). addition, p2.1 cell line used model tlr3 wt and
l412f variant receptors function.
results: patient's cells carrying l412f variant showed reduced ifnγ well
as tnfα secretion response stimulation tlr3 ligand, cmv candida
albicans. fibroblasts l412f variant showed decreased secretion ifnλ
in response stimulation polyinosine ploycytidylic acid (poly i:c)
and cmv p2.1 cells transfected l412f variant showed reduced
secretion ifn-β comparison cells transfected wild type
receptor.
conclusion: shown aberrant biological responses mediated tlr3
variant receptor, l412f, may explain part susceptibility patients 
chronic candidiasis, viral infections autoimmunity.
