using dna heteroduplex tracking assays, characterized human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 env v4/v5 genetic populations multiple blood plasma samples
collected average 7 months 24 chronically infected human
subjects. observed complex dynamic v4/v5 genetic populations most
subjects. comparisons v4/v5 v1/v2 population changes course of
the study showed major shifts genetic populations frequently occurred 
one region other, observations independently confirmed
in one subject single-genome sequencing. results suggest v1/v2 
and v4/v5 regions env often evolve independently chronic infection.
