with hiv infection. presenting symptoms 1-week history backache,
gross swelling hands feet, weakness marked pain most
muscle groups; 3 days admission urine black unable 
walk. multiple, firm 1-2 cm lymph nodes revealed examination. white
blood cell count (wbc) 22,000/microliter 12 pc lymphocytes, 7.3 pc
monocytes, 80.5 pc polymorphonuclear leukocytes. hemoglobin concentration was
15.8 g/deciliter; platelet count 124,000/microliter westergren esr 
109 mm/h. antinuclear antibody test negative. serum concentration urea 
was 3.8 mmol/liter, creatinine 42 microliter/liter, sodium 128 mmol/liter, and
potassium 5.9 mmol/liter. microscopic examination urine revealed wbc 100/hpf, 
red blood cells 20/hbf, granular casts. dipstick test showed blood land
protein urine. electromyography showed inflammatory myopathy. creatine
kinase (ck) concentration 2359 iu/liter lactate dehydrogenase
concentration 1000 iu/liter. hemolysis present clinical laboratory
signs. patient tested hiv positive elisa (abbott) western blot
(dupont). treatment consisted administration 60 mg/day prednisolone
orally. 2 weeks, swelling limbs reduced ck concentration was
reduced 931 iu/liter. patient discharged keep follow-up 
appointment. patient history predisposing conditions,
only hiv infection persistent muscle weakness inflammatory myopathy.
there evidence patient studies myopathy associated hiv
infection polymyositislike illness. case study, patient may 
had acute form polymyositis, acute viral myositis occurs with
echo, influenza, coxsackie, viral infections. detailed viral
investigation performed. hiv infection may directly infected
myocytes immunosuppression predisposing acute myositis pathogens. 
hiv-related muscle disease include rhabdomyolysis.
