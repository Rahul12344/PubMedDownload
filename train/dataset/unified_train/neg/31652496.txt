the zika virus (zikv) recently emerged mosquito-borne flavivirus that, while
typically asymptomatic, cause neurological symptoms adults birth
defects babies born infected mothers. interactions zikv many
different pathways human host ultimately determine successful virus
replication zikv-induced pathogenesis; however, molecular mechanisms of
such host-zikv interactions begun elucidated. here, summarize 
the recent advances defined mechanisms zikv antagonizes
antiviral innate immune signaling pathways, particular focus evasion of
the type interferon response human host. furthermore, describe
emerging evidence indicated contribution several cell-intrinsic
mechanisms effective restriction zikv infection, as
nonsense-mediated mrna decay, stress granule formation, "reticulophagy", a
type selective autophagy. finally, summarize recent work that
identified strategies zikv modulated intrinsic antiviral
responses.
