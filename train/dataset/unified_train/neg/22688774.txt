poxviruses one complex animal viruses encode 150 
proteins. interactions many poxviral-encoded proteins host
proteins, well proteins, transcription complexes, have
been well characterized qualitative level. also been
characterized quantitatively two hybrid systems surface plasmon resonance 
approaches. presented alternative approach enable the
understanding complex interactions multiple ligands. example given is
that vaccinia virus complement control protein (vcp). complement system
forms first line defense microorganisms failure to
appropriately regulate implicated many inflammatory disorders, as
traumatic brain injury, alzheimer's disease (ad), rheumatoid arthritis. the
complement component c3 central complement activation. complement
regulatory proteins, capable binding central complement component c3,
may therefore effectively employed treatment prevention these
disorders. many biochemical and/or immunoassays available study 
interaction proteins complement components. however, protocols many
of time consuming, assays useful multiple screening.
in addition, assays may give information regarding nature
of binding, number molecules interacting complement component c3,
as well kinetics binding. assays may require labeling may
induce changes protein confirmation. report protocol assay based
on quartz crystal microbalance dissipation monitoring (qcm-d) technology,
which effectively employed study poxviral proteins ability to
interact ligand. protocol developed laboratories study
the interaction vcp complement component c3 using q-sense (d-300),
equipment based qcm-d technology. protocol also used prototype
for studying proteins small-sized compounds (for use anti-poxvirals) 
for ability interact and/or inhibit activity ligands.
