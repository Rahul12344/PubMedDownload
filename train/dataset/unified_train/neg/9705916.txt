respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) cpts248/404 live-attenuated,
temperature-sensitive (ts) vaccine candidate derived cole-passaged cprsv 
two rounds chemical mutagenesis biological selection. previous sequence
analysis showed two steps introduced three single nucleotide
substitutions cprsv parent. two occurred coding
sequence l protein, resulted single amino acid
substitution: gin-831-leu (248 mutation) asp-1183-glu (404-l mutation). the
third mutation resulted nucleotide substitution position 9 the
c/s-acting gene start signal m2 gene (404-m2 mutation). present
study, genetic basis attenuation cpts248/404 defined the
introduction mutations (singly combination) a
full-length cdna clone cprsv. recombinant rsv derived mutant cdna
was analyzed determine contribution mutation ts and
attenuation phenotypes virus. analysis showed 248 mutation
specifies significant reduction plaque formation 38 degrees is
responsible intermediate level attenuation mice. contrast, the
404-l mutation contribute ts attenuation phenotype alone 
combination mutations thus incidental change. unexpectedly, 
the 404-m2 mutation alone specified complete restriction plaque formation at
37 degrees c high level attenuation mice. indicates the
level temperature sensitivity attenuation cpts248/404 attributed
primarily 404-m2 mutation. thus cpts248/404 virus contains set ts
and non-ts attenuating mutations, likely accounts genetic
stability. recombinant version virus, ra2cp248/404, was
phenotypically indistinguishable cpts248/404 represents background
into additional mutations introduced needed obtain desired
level attenuation successful immunization young human infant.
