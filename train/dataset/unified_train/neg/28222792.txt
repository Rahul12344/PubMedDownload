background: post-soviet kyrgyzstan experienced major surge blood-borne
infections, data adequately powered, up-to-date studies lacking. 
thus examined a) seroprevalences hepatitis b virus surface antigen
(hbsag), hiv-1 p24 antigen antibodies hepatitis c virus (anti-hcv),
human immunodeficiency viruses (anti-hiv-1/2, hiv-1 group o), treponema
pallidum among blood donors kyrgyzstan assess distribution according
to sex, age, provinces residence; b) trends respective
seroprevalences; c) co-infection rates among pathogens studied.
methods: serological screening performed 37 165 blood donors the
republican blood centre bishkek, kyrgyzstan, january 2013 december
2015. applied poststratification weights control sampling bias used
logistic regression analyses examine association seropositivity and
co-infections sex, age, provinces residence, year blood donation.
results: twenty nine thousand one hundred forty-five (78%) donors males 
and 8 020 (22%) females. median age 27 years (range: 18 - 64). the
prevalences hbsag, anti-hcv, hiv (p24 ag anti-hiv), anti-t. pallidum
were 3.6% (95%ci: 3.4 - 3.8%), 3.1% (3.0 - 3.3%), 0.78% (0.69 - 0.87%), 3.3% 
(3.1 - 3.5%), respectively. males likely seropositive hbsag
than females (or: 1.63; 95%ci: 1.40 - 1.90), less likely seropositive
for anti-hcv (0.85; 0.74 - 0.98) hiv (0.65; 0.49 - 0.85). prevalences were
lower capital provinces. decreasing trend in
the seroprevalences hbsag, anti-hcv, anti-t. pallidum 2012 2015
(p-value trend, p = 0.01, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, respectively), the
seroprevalence hiv increased (p = 0.049). one hundred eighty donors (0.48%)
were seropositive multiple infections. highest co-infection rate was
observed anti-t. pallidum hbsag (6.0%), followed anti-hcv and
anti-t. pallidum (5.2%), hiv anti-hcv (4.9%).
conclusions: data suggest kyrgyzstan reclassified high to
lower-intermediate hbsag endemicity, whereas high hiv prevalence a
rising trend alarming finding needs urgently addressed public
health authorities. observed co-infections suggest common risk factors but
also common preventive interventions.
