background: analyse evolution resistance patterns patients
undergoing treatment interruption (ti) re-initiating highly active
anti-retroviral therapy (haart).
methods: hiv-rt -pr gene-sequences analysed 14 patients (>5 failing
prior drugs) ti new haart. genotypes were
interpreted using two bioinformatics systems. additionally, virus load (vl) and
cd4(+)-t-cell counts measured.
results: six patients (42%) achieved sustained undetectable vl one year
after ti (responders), 8 (57%) maintained vl 2,000 copies/ml
(non-responders). different patterns resistance-mutations evolution were
detected. ti loss mutations observed three patients, a
reduction mutations detected seven patients, alteration seen
in four patients. responders, 87.5% protease inhibitor (pi)-resistance 
mutations waned ti remained undetectable new treatment. in
contrast, non-responder group pi-resistance mutations continued
noticeable new therapy. loss primary pi-resistance mutations the
presence one fully active pi new regimen significantly correlated 
success subsequent treatment (p=0.028). two patients new reverse
transcriptase associated mutations detected ti, g190a (nnrti
mutation) k70r (nrti mutation). appearance k70r could explained a
reverse direction previously described pathway thymidin analogues
mutation resistance development, g190a could due prolonged
subinhibitory drug levels cessation nnrtis.
conclusion: evolution haart-resistance, different patterns were
observed responders non-responders ti. absence of
pi-resistance associated mutations ti administration a
predicted fully active pi new therapy correlated success. newly
detected mutations ti may indicate reversibility previously described
mutational pathways.
