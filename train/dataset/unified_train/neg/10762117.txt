analysed 8 year period: 27. 1% lesions spontaneously regressed 
while 43.6% persisted 29.3% progressed carcinoma. high risk types were
present 80.5% (crude 13.8, p=0.0003) progressive lesions. possible
co-factors also evaluated: history sexually transmitted
diseases, mainly syphilis, showed positively related progression
(adjusted 13.0, p=0.0003) oral contraceptive use tobacco smoking
