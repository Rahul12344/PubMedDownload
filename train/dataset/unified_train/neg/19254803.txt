some bovine enteric caliciviruses form new genus family caliciviridae.
in study, bayesian phylogenetic analysis 31 full length capsid sequences 
from europe, north america asia revealed new genus four
currently circulating lineages showed temporal geographical
distribution. groupings supported distribution frequency
of pair-wise distances. however, nucleotide amino acid heterogeneity 
low, maximum nucleotide amino acid divergence 16.7% 8.4%,
respectively. variability found amino acid residues 288 420 
of capsid protein sequence motifs observed region supported
the division four lineages. homology modelling using structure 
san miguel sea lion capsid indicated variation occurred the
predicted p2 domain thus, may affect antigenic sites surface the
capsid newly described genus.
