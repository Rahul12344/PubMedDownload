the hepatitis b virus (hbv) polymerase synthesizes viral dna genome 
pre-genomic rna (pgrna) template reverse transcription. initiation of
viral dna synthesis accomplished via novel protein priming mechanism, so
named polymerase acts primer, whereby initiating
nucleotide becomes covalently linked tyrosine residue viral
polymerase. protein priming, turn, depends specific recognition the
packaging signal pgrna called epsilon. early events viral dna
synthesis dissected vitro described here.the polymerase is
expressed mammalian cells purified immunoprecipitation. purified
protein associated host cell factors, enzymatically active, its
priming activity epsilon dependent. minimal epsilon rna construct pgrna
is co-expressed polymerase cells. rna binds and
co-immunoprecipitates polymerase. modifications made either
the epsilon rna polymerase protein manipulating expression
plasmids. also, priming reaction modified assay the
initiation subsequent dna synthesis protein priming, susceptibility
of polymerase chemical inhibitors, precise identification the
dna products upon release polymerase. identity associated
host factors also evaluated. protocol closely mirrors current
understanding rna binding protein priming steps hbv replication
cycle, amenable modification. therefore facilitate both
basic research drug discovery.
