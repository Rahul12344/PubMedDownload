behavioral, anatomical, gene expression studies shown functional
dissociations dorsal ventral hippocampus regard their
involvement spatial cognition, emotion, stress. study examined 
the difference multisynaptic inputs dorsal ventral dentate
gyrus (dg) rat using retrograde trans-synaptic tracing recombinant
rabies virus vectors. three days vectors injected dorsal 
or ventral dg, monosynaptic neuronal labeling present entorhinal
cortex, medial septum, diagonal band, supramammillary nucleus, 
is known project dg directly. previous tracing studies,
topographical patterns related dorsal ventral dg seen these
regions. five days infection, neurons regions were
labeled labeled neurons also seen cortical subcortical regions,
including piriform medial prefrontal cortices, endopiriform nucleus, 
the claustrum, cortical amygdala, medial raphe nucleus, medial
habenular nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, lateral septum. the
monosynaptically labeled regions, topographical distribution labeled neurons
was evident disynaptically labeled regions. data indicate 
that cortical subcortical inputs dorsal ventral dg are
conveyed parallel disynaptic pathways. second-order input difference
in dorsal ventral dg likely contribute functional
differentiation hippocampus along dorsoventral axis.
