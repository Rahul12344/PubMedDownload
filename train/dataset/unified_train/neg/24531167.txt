xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (xmrv) considered a
possible trigger myalgic encephalomyelitis/ chronic fatigue syndrome (me/cfs) 
and could also linked unspecified encephalopathy. aim study
was analyse frequency xmrv proviral sequences peripheral blood
leukocyte (pbl) dna 150 patients me/cfs 30 apparently healthy
individuals, well pbl brain tissue dna 61 individuals
with/without unspecified encephalopathy. targeting xmrv proviral gag gene
sequence nested polymerase chain reaction (npcr) previously reported
primer sets, provirus detected either dna patients me/cfs
and individuals unspecified encephalopathy, apparently healthy
individuals. positive control gave amplimer 410 base pairs (bp)
after second round corresponds expected xmrv gag gene fragment.
in addition, dna found negative npcr assays, targeting xmrv specific
env gene sequence, using previously described primer sets. also positive
control gave amplimer 218 bp second round, corresponding 
expected xmrv env gene fragment. using npcr found evidence xmrv
infection either apparently healthy individuals patients me/cfs and
individuals unspecified encephalopathy.
