hepatitis c virus (hcv) genotype viral load two significant predictive
variables knowledge might persuade treatment decisions. objective of
the present study identify distribution different hcv genotypes
circulating study area estimate viral load chronically hcv
infected patients. total 305 hcv positive patients, 177 (58%) males
and 128 (42%) females. frequency breakup hcv positive patients was
169, 69, 38 29 abbottabad, mansehra, haripur battagram districts
respectively. total 305 tested serum samples, 255 (83.06%) were
successfully genotyped whereas 50 (16.4%) samples found unclassified
genotypes. among typable genotypes, 1a accounted 21 (6.8%) 1b 14 (4.6%), 
2a 4 (1.31%) 3a 166 (54.42%) genotype 3b (8.19%). twenty five
(8.19%) patients infected mixed hcv genotypes. viral load distribution 
was classified three categories based viral load levels low
(< 60, 0000 iu/ml), intermediate (60,0000-80,0000 iu/ml) high (> 80,0000
iu/ml). baseline hcv rna viral load hcv genotype 3 infected patients was
50 (26.17%), 46 (24.08%) 95 (49.73%) low, intermediate high
categories respectively. genotypes 3, values low,
intermediate high viral load categories 50 (43.85), 35 (30.70) 29
(25.43) respectively. pre-treatment viral load patients untypable
genotype 19 (38.00%), 5 (20.00%) 11 (44.00%) low, intermediate and
high viral load categories. viral load distribution also categorized sex
wise; males 58 (32.76%), 26 (14.68%) 93 (52.54%) whereas for
females 40 (31.25%), 34 (26.56%) 54 (42.18%) low, intermediate and
high viral load respectively. conclusion hcv genotype 3a prevalent
genotype circulating hazara division like parts pakistan.
pre-treatment viral load significantly high (p 0.014) patients infected
with hcv genotype 3 compared genotypes.
