hiv-1 integrase enzyme plays important role life cycle hiv and
responsible integration virus human genome. here, computational 
and synthetic approaches used design synthesize newer hiv-1 integrase
inhibitors. pharmacophore mapping performed 20 chemically diverse
molecules using discotech, refinement carried using gasp. ten
pharmacophore models generated, model 2, containing four features
including two donor sites, one acceptor atom, one hydrophobic region, was
considered best model highest fitness score. used a
query nci maybridge databases. molecules 99% q(fit) value
were used design 30 molecules bearing pteridine ring docked on
co-crystal structure hiv-1 integrase enzyme. among these, six molecules,
showing good docking score compared reference standards, were
synthesized conventional well microwave-assisted methods. compounds 
were characterized physical spectral data evaluated vitro
anti-hiv activity replication hiv-1 (iiib) mt-4 cells. used
approach molecular docking anti-hiv activity data designed molecules
will provide significant insights discover novel hiv-1 integrase inhibitors.
