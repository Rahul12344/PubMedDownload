peripheral cell lymphoma, otherwise specified (ptcl-nos) heterogeneous
subtype non-hodgkin's lymphoma. study aims better define the
prognostic factors compare predictive value prognostic scores in
chinese patients ptcl-nos. one hundred five patients diagnosed as
ptcl-nos institution retrospectively studied grouped according 
to four previously described prognostic scores [international prognostic index
(ipi), prognostic index ptcl-nos (pit), modified pit (m-pit), and
international ptcl project (iptclp)]. addition clinical parameters,
peripheral lymphopenia thrombocytopenia, serum epstein-barr virus positivity,
and tumor ki-67 significantly associated poor disease outcome.
multivariate analysis revealed age >60Â years, poor performance status,
elevated lactic dehydrogenase, bone marrow involvement independent
adverse variables survival. prognostic scores successful for
survival estimation. risk subgroups ipi pit could discriminated
by platelet count (iptclp factor) ki-67 (m-pit factor), respectively.
together, patient- tumor-specific characteristics may incorporated risk
stratification ptcl-nos patients. prognostic scores could mutually
active improve predictive value disease outcome.
