background: human herpesvirus 6 (hhv-6) t-lymphtropic neurotropic virus 
that infect various types cells. sequential studies reported that
apoptosis glia neurons induced hhv-6 might act potential trigger 
some central nervous system (cns) diseases. hhv-6 involved pathogenesis
of encephalitis, multiple sclerosis (ms) fatigue syndrome. however, the
mechanisms responsible apoptosis infected cns cells induced hhv-6
are poorly understood. study, investigated cell death processes of
primary human fetal astrocytes (phfas) productive hhv-6a infection the
underlying mechanisms.
results: hhv-6a cause productive infection primary human fetal astrocytes.
annexin v-pi staining electron microscopic analysis indicated hhv-6a was
an inducer apoptosis. cell death associated activation of
caspase-3 cleavage poly (adp-ribose) polymerase (parp), known 
be important substrate activated caspase-3. caspase-8 -9 also
significantly activated hhv-6a-infected cells. moreover, hhv-6a infection led 
to bax up-regulation bcl-2 down-regulation. hhv-6a infection increased the
release smac/diablo, aif cytochrome c mitochondria cytosol, 
induced apoptosis via caspase-dependent -independent pathways. in
addition, also found anti-apoptotic factors iaps nf-Îºb
decreased hhv-6a infected phfas.
conclusion: first demonstration caspase-dependent -independent
apoptosis hhv-6a-infected glial cells. findings would helpful in
understanding mechanisms cns diseases caused hhv-6.
