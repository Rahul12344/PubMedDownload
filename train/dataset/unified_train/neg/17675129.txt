expression cd40 ligand (cd40l) tumors activate host immune systems 
and produce antitumor effects tumors. deliver cd40l gene
efficiently, evaluated efficiency transduction different serotypes
of adeno-associated virus (aav) vectors lung cancer a549 cells compared
the transduction efficiency conventional aav vector of
self-complementary aav (scaav) vectors well. determined serotype
aav2/5 transduced a549 cells much efficiently serotypes aav2/1, aav2/2,
aav2/6, aav2/7, aav2/8, aav2/9 aav2/10. transduction efficiency of
scaav2/5 significantly higher conventional aav2/5. furthermore,
pre-treatment carboplatin, chemotherapeutic agent used lung
cancer chemotherapy, substantially increased aav-mediated transgene expression.
the scaav2/5 vectors encoding human cd40l used tranduce cd40l a549
cells, co-cultivated immature human dendritic cells (dcs).
interleukin 12 (il-12) released measured culture supernatant.
specificity immunostimulatory effect cd40l confirmed blocking
with monoclonal antibody binding human cd40l. vivo antitumor activity
was evaluated balb/c nude mice bearing a549 lung cancer. scaav2/5-cd40l showed
significant inhibitory effects growth transplanted tumor cells as
compared control group. studies suggest recombinant aav2/5-cd40l 
may provide effective form therapy lung cancer.
