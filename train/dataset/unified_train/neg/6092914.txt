dna replication chromatin structure simian virus 40 insertion mutants.

innis jw, scott wa.

insertion dna segments nuclease-sensitive region simian virus 40
alters replication efficiency chromatin structure. mutants containing
large insertions simian virus 40 origin replication (ori site) and
the 21-base-pair repeated sequences replicated poorly assayed by
transfection cos-1 cells. replication mutants shorter insertions was
moderately reduced. effect cis-acting independent nucleotide 
sequence insert. nuclease-sensitive chromatin structure retained
in mutants, pattern cleavage sites displaced late
direction ori site. new cleavage sites appeared within inserted
sequences, suggesting information specifying nuclease-sensitive
chromatin structure located late side inserts. accessibility 
bgli (which cleaves within ori site) reduced larger insertion
mutants. results support conclusion efficient function the
viral origin replication correlated proximity altered
chromatin structure.
