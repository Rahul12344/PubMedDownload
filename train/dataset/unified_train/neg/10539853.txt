background: several lines evidence suggest microbial infections 
involved pathogenesis atherosclerosis. aim studies referred 
to evaluate possible role enteroviral infections potential 
risk factors cardiac events.
methods results: association enterovirus-specific antibodies and
cardiac events analyzed 3 large, prospective population studies the
nested case-control design. stored sera collected study baseline were
tested enterovirus group-specific immunoglobulin g antibodies. study
samples north karelia project, helsinki heart study, mobile 
clinic health service composed 183, 241, 276 men myocardial
infarction, respectively, matched control patients. 2 3
studies, male cases without evidence heart disease baseline had
significantly higher levels antibodies enteroviruses matched
control patients. high enterovirus antibody level found definite
independent risk factor future cardiac events. north karelia study the
risk high men aged 25 49 years, whereas mobile clinic health
service study risk particularly strong low levels serum 
cholesterol. association high levels enterovirus antibodies and
cardiac events seen helsinki heart study, consisted of
hypercholesteremic men.
conclusions: high level enterovirus group-specific antibodies be
considered sign frequent enterovirus infections past, these
studies suggest enterovirus infections increase risk myocardial
infarction least normocholesteremic men.
