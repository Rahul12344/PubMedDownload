objective: observe effects mutant hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (hif-1α) 
adenovirus (adeno-hif-1α-ala402-ala564) cardiomyocytes (cmcs) differentiation 
from mesenchymal stem cells (mscs) co-cultured cmcs.
methods: following groups studied: hif-1α group (mscs + cmcs + ad-hif-1α),
lacz group (mscs + cmcs + ad-lacz), sham group (mscs + cmcs + pbs) msc +
hif-1α group (mscs + ad-hif-1α). mscs co-cultured myocardial cells in
proportion mscs:cmcs 1:2, 24 hours, cells infect virus (moi = 
100) treated pbs, cardiac troponin (ctnt) expression mscs detected
7 days post infection immunochemical analysis, mrna expression hif-1α,
tgf-β(1), smad4, nkx2.5, gata-4 also detected rt-pcr.
results: hif-1α increased mscs differentiation myocardial cells
(differentiation rate 32.68% ± 6.52% vs. 8.28% ± 0.09% lacz group and
10.25% ± 2.20% sham group 0.32% ± 0.05% msc group (all p < 0.05
vs. hif-1α group). mrna expression hif, tgf-β(1), smad4, nkx2.5 gata-4 was
also significantly upregulated hif-1α group p < 0.05 vs. sham group).
conclusion: hif-1α promoted mscs, co-cultured myocardial cells,
differentiating cardiomyocytes via upregulating tgf-β(1)/smad4 signaling
pathway.
