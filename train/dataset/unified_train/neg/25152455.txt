charcot-marie-tooth disease (cmt) common inherited neuropathy
characterized clinical genetic heterogeneity. although 30 loci
harboring cmt-causing mutations identified, many genes still
remain discovered many affected individuals. two consanguineous
families cmt (axonal mixed phenotypes), parametric linkage analysis
using genome-wide snp chip identified 4.3 mb region 12q24 showing maximum 
multipoint lod score 4.23. subsequent whole-genome sequencing study one 
the probands, followed mutation screening two families, revealed a
disease-specific 5 bp deletion (c.247-10_247-6delcactc) splicing element
(pyrimidine tract) intron 2 adjacent third exon cytochrome c oxidase
subunit via polypeptide 1 (cox6a1), component mitochondrial
respiratory complex iv (cytochrome c oxidase [cox]), within autozygous
linkage region. functional analysis showed expression cox6a1 in
peripheral white blood cells affected individuals cox activity in
their eb-virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines significantly reduced. 
in addition, cox6a1-null mice showed significantly reduced cox activity and
neurogenic muscular atrophy leading difficulty walking. data
indicated cox6a1 mutation causes autosomal-recessive axonal or
mixed cmt.
