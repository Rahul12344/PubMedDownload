venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (veev) new world alphavirus is
vectored mosquitos cycled rodents. cause disease equines 
humans characterized febrile illness may progress encephalitis.
like capsid protein viruses, veev capsid abundant structural
protein binds viral rna interacts membrane-bound
glycoproteins. also protease activity, allowing cleavage from
the growing structural polypeptide translation. however, veev capsid
protein additional nonstructural roles within host cell functioning as
the primary virulence factor veev. veev capsid inhibits host transcription
and blocks nuclear import mammalian cells, least partially due its
complexing host crm1 importin α/β1 nuclear transport proteins. veev 
capsid also shuttles nucleus cytoplasm susceptible to
inhibitors nuclear trafficking, making promising antiviral target.
herein, role veev capsid viral replication pathogenesis be
discussed including comparison proteins alphaviruses.
