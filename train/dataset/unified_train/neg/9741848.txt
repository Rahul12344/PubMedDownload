the crystal structures class major histocompatibility complex (mhc)
molecules complexed antigenic peptides revealed network hydrogen bonds 
between charged amino- carboxyl-termini peptides conserved mhc
residues ends peptide binding site. interactions shown 
to contribute substantially stability class mhc/peptide complexes 
thermal denaturation studies using synthetic peptides either amino- 
or carboxyl-terminal group substituted methyl group. report
crystal structures hla-a*0201 complexed terminally modified
synthetic peptides showing adopt bound conformation as
antigenic peptides. number variations peptide conformation observed 
for terminally modified peptides, including one case, large
conformational difference four central peptide residues apparently
caused lattice contact. reminiscent way binding t-cell
receptor changed conformation central residues mhc-bound peptide.
the structures determined identify conserved hydrogen bonds eliminated 
in terminally substituted peptides suggest increased energetic importance 
of interactions peptide termini mhc-peptide stability.
