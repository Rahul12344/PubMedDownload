as one popular model enzymes, structure evolution of
ribonucleases (rnases) studied thoroughly. recently,

functions, controlling blood vessel formation, killing tumor cells and
inhibiting virus. immunotoxin, antibody-toxin conjugate, becomes a
research hot spot. rnases cytotoxicity candidates toxin
moiety immunotoxins. paper, newly found cytotoxic functions of
