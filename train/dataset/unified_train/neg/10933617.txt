92 subjects aids clinical trials group (actg) 175 study median
of 3.6 years zidovudine monotherapy randomized treatment with
stavudine zidovudine lamivudine. evaluation long-term changes, the
average 40- 48-week hiv plasma rna, demonstrated lamivudine and
zidovudine provided significantly greater virologic suppression compared with
stavudine (mean decrease 0.70 versus 0.18 1og10 copies/ml,p = 0.003). twenty-nine
percent zidovudine plus lamivudine recipients hiv rna levels 500
copies per milliliter 48 weeks compared 4% stavudine recipients (p 
= 0.02). regimens significantly increased cd4+ cell numbers, means of
weeks 40 48 rose 49 36 cd4+ cells per cubic millimeter among
zidovudine plus lamivudine stavudine recipients, respectively. treatments
were well tolerated 3 92 subjects died developed aids within 48
weeks. zidovudine-experienced subjects, addition lamivudine resulted in
significantly decreased plasma hiv rna levels 48 weeks compared treatment
with stavudine alone.
