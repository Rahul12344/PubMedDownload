anaerobic digestion inactivate zoonotic pathogens present cattle manure,
which reduces transmission pathogens farms humans the
environment. however, variability inactivation across farms time 
is unknown studies examined pathogen inactivation ideal
laboratory conditions focused one two full-scale digesters 
a time. contrast, sampled seven full-scale digesters treating cattle manure
in wisconsin 9 mo biweekly basis ( = 118 pairs influent effluent 
samples) used real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyze
these samples 19 different microbial genetic markers. overall, inactivation
of pathogens fecal indicators highly variable. aggregated across
digester season, log-removal values several representative
microorganisms-bovine , -like cowm3, bovine polyomavirus-were 0.78 ± 0.34,
0.70 ± 0.50, 0.53 ± 0.58, respectively (mean ± sd). log-removal values 
were two times lower expected based scientific literature.
thus, study indicates full-scale anaerobic digestion cattle manure
requires optimization regard pathogen inactivation. future studies should
focus identifying potential causes suboptimal performance (e.g.,
overloading, poor mixing, poor temperature control). study also examined 
fate pathogens manure separation found majority of
microbes detected ended liquid fraction separated manure. this
finding important implications transmission zoonotic pathogens
through environment humans.
