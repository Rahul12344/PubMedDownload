the role endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress japanese encephalitis largely
unknown. study, found japanese encephalitis virus (jev) strain
sa14-14-2 regulates expression glucose-regulated protein 78 (grp78),
transcription factor 4 (atf4) c/ebp homologous protein (chop), splicing
of x-box-binding protein 1 (xbp1) mrna bhk-21 cells. sa14-14-2-induced
cytopathic effect decrease viability also observed. moreover, the
inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (ire1) inhibitor 3,5-dibromosalicylaldehyde jnk
inhibitor sp600125 increased cell viability reduced cell apoptosis did
not alter virus replication sa14-14-2-infected bhk-21 cells. results,
for first time, demonstrate jev induces apoptosis ire1/jnk
pathway er stress response.
