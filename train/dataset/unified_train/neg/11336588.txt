saquinavir peptidomimetic inhibitor hiv protease. initially marketed as
invirasetrade mark, effectiveness saquinavir greatly hindered its
nearly complete first pass metabolism cytochrome p450 3a4. new formulation, 
fortovasetrade mark, appears yield six times drug exposure has
been demonstrated yield virological immunological results similar those
of protease inhibitors (pis) used conjunction two nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nrtis). emerging data suggest safe use
twice daily. co-administration either formulation saquinavir with
nelfinavir especially ritonavir yields greatly increased blood levels, with
corresponding superior magnitude durability viral suppression first
line therapy, albeit increased adverse effects. combination ritonavir
and saquinavir also yielded promising results published second
line therapy, virological breakthrough previous pi-containing therapy.
in addition, preliminary data suggests possibility daily dosing of
ritonavir saquinavir, would expected increase compliance and
allow direct observed therapy.
