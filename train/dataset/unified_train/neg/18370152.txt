our understanding virus control natural killer (nk) cells relies mainly 
in vitro observations. significance findings virus control in
vivo yet fully understood. complexity added fact many
viruses, particularly herpesviruses, equipped sets genes that,
dependent genetic background host, modify nk cell response. the
advent recombinant dna technology mutagenesis procedures bac-cloned
viral genomes made possible screen viral proteins with
such functions also assess biological relevance. mutant viruses with
gene defects reveal efficacy complexity nk cell control. here, we
describe procedures assess nk cell response mouse cytomegalovirus
(mcmv), prominent virus model studying nk cell functions vivo.
