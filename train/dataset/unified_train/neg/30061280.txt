zika virus (zikv) linked development microcephaly newborns,
as well guillain-barré syndrome. currently drugs available to
treat zikv infection, accordingly, unmet medical need the
discovery new therapies. high-throughput drug screening efforts focusing on
indirect readouts cell viability prone higher frequency false
positives cases virus viable cell cytopathic
effect (cpe) reduced delayed. here, describe fast label-free
phenotypic high-content imaging assay detect cells affected the
virus-induced cpe using automated imaging analysis. protection cpe
correlates decrease viral antigen production, observed by
immunofluorescence. trained assay using collection nucleoside
analogues activity zikv; previously reported antiviral
activities 2'-c-methylribonucleosides ribavirin zika virus 
vero cells confirmed using developed method. validate ability 
our assay reveal new anti-zikv compounds, profiled novel library 24
natural product derivatives found compound 1 inhibitor the
zikv-induced cytopathic effect; activity compound confirmed in
human fetal neural stem cells (nscs). described technique easily
leveraged primary screening assay profiling activities large
compound libraries zikv expanded zikv strains and
other cell lines displaying morphological changes upon zikv infection.
