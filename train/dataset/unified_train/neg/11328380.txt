successful elimination hepatitis c virus (hcv) acute infection 
been linked strong hcv-specific vitro t-cell proliferation, whereas cells
from patients chronic hepatitis c respond weakly hcv antigens.
lipid-coupled peptides immunostimulants, might provide basis for
novel therapeutic strategies hcv. therefore, 20 patients chronic 
hepatitis c, studied whether tri-palmitoyl-s-cysteine-coupled peptides could
modify vitro t-cell proliferation (by [3h]thymidine uptake) response to
virus core ns4. lipopeptides corresponded five immunodominant helper
epitopes hcv core. contrary unmodified peptides, lipopeptides
specifically enhanced [3h]thymidine uptake response hcv antigens to
a non-hcv related control antigen. increased frequency responders
(stimulation index, si > = 4) core (13/20 versus 2/20; p = 0.0008) ns4 
(20/20 versus 7/20; p < 0.0001) among patients chronic hepatitis c. this
immunostimulatory effect dose-dependent, observed specifically with
lipopeptides corresponding hcv epitopes. data demonstrate the
poor vitro t-cell proliferation patients chronic hepatitis c be
improved cells co-stimulated hcv core-derived helper
lipopeptides, peptides unlipidated form effects. thus,
lipopeptides corresponding hcv t-cell epitopes may offer novel
immunomodulatory strategies hcv.
