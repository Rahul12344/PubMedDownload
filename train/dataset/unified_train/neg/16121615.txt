objective: determine whether depopulation-repopulation could used to
eradicate salmonella serotype typhimurium dt104 commercial swine farm in
the midwestern united states.
design: observational study
sample population: commercial swine farm undergoing depopulation-repopulation
to eliminate porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus mycoplasma
hyopneumoniae.
procedure: pooled fecal samples, tissue samples, serum samples collected
from pigs farm depopulation-repopulation. were
no pigs farm, environmental swab specimens collected bacterial
culture. serum analyzed anti-salmonella antibodies indirect
elisa. salmonella isolates obtained bacterial culture fecal, tissue, and
environmental samples characterized means serotyping, phage typing,
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge), antimicrobial susceptibility
testing.
results: 167 salmonella isolates representing 9 serotypes recovered the
farm. results pfge antimicrobial susceptibility testing suggested s. 
typhimurium dt104 strain eradicated farm. however,
seroprevalence anti-salmonella antibodies percentage pooled fecal
samples positive salmonella spp significantly decreased following
repopulation.
conclusions clinical relevance: results suggested that
depopulation-repopulation conjunction stringent cleaning and
disinfection, attention biosecurity procedures, control diseases, and
changes feed management may reduce occurrence of, likely not
eliminate, salmonella spp commercial swine herds.
