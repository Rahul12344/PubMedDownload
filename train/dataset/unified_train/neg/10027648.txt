there increasing interest use topical microbicides help prevent
the spread sexually transmitted diseases (std). undecylenic acid (ua), a
monosaturated fatty acid, active ingredient number of
over-the-counter (otc) antifungal spray powders, also exhibits vitro
antibacterial antiviral activity, including herpes simplex virus (hsv)
activity. we, therefore, evaluated ua topical microbicide genital
hsv infection using murine guinea pig models genital herpes. mice were
administered 20% solution ua polyethylene glycol (peg) vehicle, vehicle
alone phosphate buffered saline (pbs) intravaginally immediately prior to
vaginal challenge hsv-2. pre-treatment ua decreased number mice 
that became infected (p < 0.001 vs. pbs vehicle control), developed symptoms
(p <0.001) died (p <0.001). however, treatment extended either 5
min prior viral inoculation, protection lost. similar findings
were found using guinea pig model, ua treatment completely prevented
hsv-2 vaginal infection given immediately prior hsv-2 inoculation
(p<0.001 vs. pbs vehicle control). thus, ua, approved otc medication,
provided significant protection hsv disease infection when
applied immediately viral inoculation, indicating better formulations
were needed extend duration protection.
