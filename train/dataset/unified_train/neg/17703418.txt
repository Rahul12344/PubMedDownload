background: spectrum cutaneous human papillomaviruses (hpvs) detectable
in nonmelanoma skin cancers, well healthy skin, significance
that presence types hpv dna pathogenesis skin
cancer remains unclear.
methods: studied 349 nonimmunosuppressed patients skin lesions (82 with
squamous cell carcinomas, 126 basal cell carcinomas, 49 actinic
keratoses, 92 benign lesions). superficial skin removed
by tape, paired biopsy samples--from lesion healthy skin the
same patient--were tested hpv dna. risk factors hpv dna analyzed 
multivariate models.
results: overall, 12% healthy skin samples positive hpv dna, compared
with 26% benign lesions, 22% actinic keratoses, 18% basal cell
carcinomas, 26% squamous cell carcinomas. hpv dna associated with
sites extensively exposed sun, lesions (odds ratio [or], 4.45
[95% confidence interval {ci}, 2.44-8.11]) healthy skin samples (or, 
3.65 [95% ci 1.79-7.44]). hpv types beta-papillomavirus species 2 predominate 
in squamous cell carcinomas (or, 4.40 [95% ci, 1.92-10.06]), whereas hpv types of
beta-papillomavirus species 1 primarily found benign lesions (or, 3.47
[95% ci, 1.72-6.99]).
conclusions: cutaneous hpv types primarily detected sites extensively
exposed sun. hpv types beta-papillomavirus species 2, of
species 1, associated squamous cell carcinoma.
