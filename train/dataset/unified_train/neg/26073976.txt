objectives: identification antigenic variants selection of
influenza viruses vaccine production based largely antigenic
characterisation haemagglutinin (ha) circulating viruses using the
haemagglutination inhibition (hi) assay. however, addition evolution
related escape from host immunity, variants emerging result of
propagation different cell substrates complicate interpretation of
hi results. objective develop micro-neutralisation (mn)
assay complement hi assay antigenic characterisation influenza
viruses assess emergence new antigenic variants reinforce the
selection vaccine viruses.
design setting: 96-well-plate plaque reduction mn assay based the
measurement infected cell population using simple imaging technique.
sample: representative influenza (h1n1) pdm09, a(h3n2) b viruses isolated
between 2004 2013 main outcome measures results: improvements the
plaque reduction mn assay included selection suitable cell line
according virus type subtype, optimisation experimental design and
data quantitation. comparisons results mn hi assays showed the
importance complementary data determining true antigenic relationships 
among recent human influenza a(h1n1)pdm09, a(h3n2) type b viruses.
conclusions: study demonstrates improved mn assay certain
advantages hi assay: significantly influenced the
cell-selected amino acid substitutions neuraminidase (na) a(h3n2)
viruses, particularly useful antigenic characterisation viruses 
which either grow low ha titre and/or undergo abortive infection resulting 
in inability form plaques cultured cells.
