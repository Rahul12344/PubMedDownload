hepatitis c virus (hcv) high propensity persistence. better define
the immunologic determinants hcv clearance persistence, examined the
circulating hcv-specific t-cell frequency, repertoire, cytokine phenotype ex 
vivo 24 hcv seropositive subjects (12 chronic, 12 recovered), using 361
overlapping peptides 36 antigenic pools span entire hcv core,
ns3-ns5. consistent t-cell-mediated control hcv, overall hcv-specific
type-1 t-cell response significantly greater average frequency (0.24% vs. 
0.04% circulating lymphocytes, p =.001) scope (14/36 vs. 4/36 pools, p =.002)
among recovered chronic subjects, t-cell response correlated
inversely hcv titer among chronic subjects (r = -0.51, p =.049).
although highly antigenic regions identified throughout hcv genome,
there apparent difference overall hcv-specific t-cell repertoire or
type-1/type-2 cytokine profile relative outcome. notably, hcv persistence 
associated reversible cd4-mediated suppression hcv-specific cd8 cells
and higher frequency cd4(+)cd25(+) regulatory cells (7.3% chronic vs.
2.5% recovered, p =.002) could directly suppress hcv-specific type-1 cd8 t
cells ex vivo. conclusion, found hcv persistence associated 
global quantitative functional suppression hcv-specific cells not
differential antigenic hierarchy cytokine phenotype relative hcv clearance.
the high frequency cd4(+)cd25(+) regulatory cells suppression of
hcv-specific cd8 cells ex vivo suggests novel role regulatory cells 
hcv persistence.
