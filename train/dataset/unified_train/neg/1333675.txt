adult ponies fed ovalbumin (ova) daily 2 weeks significantly
greater serum anti-ova igg (p = 0.001) antigen specific lymphocyte responses 
(p = 0.031) intramuscular injection ova given saponin than
control ponies fed antigen. suggests that, despite
the lack evidence b- t-cell activation peripheral blood the
period ova feeding, animals primed active secondary immune
response. adult ponies challenged equine rotavirus, strain h-2, 
statistically significant differences found serum igg-associated antibody
responses antigen-specific lymphocyte responses the
rotavirus-challenged group control group, either following rotavirus
challenge intramuscular injection rotavirus antigen given saponin. our
findings, feeding non-replicating protein antigen ova appeared prime 
for increased immune response rather inducing oral tolerance, may of
relevance future studies way equine gastrointestinal tract handles 
usually harmless antigens.
