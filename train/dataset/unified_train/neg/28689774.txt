rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (rhdv) induces highly contagious and
extremely lethal disease fulfils many requirements animal model of
fulminant hepatic failure (fhf); however, pathogenesis rhd still not
been fully elucidated. cytokines play important role regulation the
immune response pathogenesis many diseases, including caused by
viral infections. furthermore, recent studies indicate role immune
response, especially peripheral blood leukocytes (pbl), pathogenesis of
rhd. thus, present study investigated expression il-1ra, il-6,
il-8, il-18, tnf-α ifn-γ genes pbl rhdv-infected rabbits. also
compared expression genes encoding cytokines rabbits with
different course rhdv infection (in animals died 36 h post infection or
survived even 60 h infection). study revealed increased expression
of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines: il-6, il-8, tnf-α, ifn-γ pbl 
rhdv-infected rabbits. moreover, level cytokine gene expression depended
on course rhd. hence, results obtained indicate potential role 
these cytokines rhdv infection influence survival time of
infected rabbits.
