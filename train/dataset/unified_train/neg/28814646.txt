plants use cell surface-resident pattern recognition receptors (prrs) and
intracellular nucleotide binding leucine-rich repeat (nlr) receptors detect
various pathogens. plant prrs typically recognize conserved pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (pamps) provide broad-spectrum resistance. contrast,
plant nlrs generally detect pathogen strain-specific effectors confer
race-specific resistance. here, demonstrate tomato (solanum
lycopersicum) nlr sw-5b confers broad-spectrum resistance american-type
tospoviruses recognizing conserved 21-amino acid peptide region within viral
movement protein nsm (nsm21). sw-5b nb-arc-lrr domains directly associate with
nsm21 vitro planta. domain swap, site-directed mutagenesis and
structure modeling analyses identified four polymorphic sites sw-5b lrr
domain critical recognition nsm21 furthermore, recognition of
nsm21 sw-5b likely disturbs residues adjacent r927 lrr domain to
weaken intramolecular interaction lrr nb-arc domains, thus
translating recognition nsm21 activation sw-5b. natural variation
analysis sw-5b homologs wild tomato species south america revealed
that four polymorphic sites sw-5b lrr domain positively selected 
during evolution necessary confer resistance tospovirus. the
results described provide new example plant nlr mediating
broad-spectrum resistance recognition small conserved pamp-like
region within pathogen effector.
