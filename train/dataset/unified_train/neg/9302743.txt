gene gun-based dna immunization using vectors encoding hiv-1 gp120 influenza
virus nucleoprotein result th2-like immune responses following successive
immunizations. codelivery vectors encoding il-2, il-7, il-12 blocked
this effect markedly enhancing gp120-specific interferon gamma production, and
suppressing il-4 igg1 responses. unbiased augmentation immune
responses observed increasing resting period immunizations. in
this case, ifn-gamma production following vitro stimulation increased 
1000-fold, il-4, igg1, igg2a responses elevated well.
interestingly, cytokine gene codelivery, context longer resting
period, provided additional stimulation th1-like responses as
ifn-gamma igg2a production, although still suppression il-4
production. data demonstrate quality magnitude responses
elicited following epidermal administration dna vaccines manipulated by
multiple means.
