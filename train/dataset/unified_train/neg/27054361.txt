objective: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) established risk
factor diabetes, cardiovascular disease, antiviral treatment resistance, 
progression chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection fibrosis.
apolipoprotein-b 100 (apob-100) dyslipidemia marker steatosis predictor.
we assess correlation apob-100 hepatosteatosis.
methods: cross-sectional study enrolled 1,218 hcv-seropositive participants 
from 2012-2013 health checkup taiwan. nafld detected using ultrasound.
all anthropometric laboratory studies included apob-100 evaluated
whether apob-100 predicts nafld. logistic regression also used to
examine association apob-100 nafld.
results: participants 47.16 ± 16.08 years old (mean age). overall
prevalence nafld 35.8% (n = 436; 32.8% men, 38.1% women). participants
with apob-100 ≥ 8 significantly higher incidence nafld (39.4 vs. 29.4%; 
95% ci 0.044-0.156; p < 0.001). confounding factors adjusted for, 
apob-100 significantly associated nafld (or 5.45; 95% ci 1.64-18.06; p =
0.006) high-grade hepatosteatosis (or 7.73; 95% ci 1.74-34.35; p = 0.007).
conclusion: apob-100 strongly associated nafld people with
non-genotype 3 hcv; greater apob-100 content significantly correlated with
higher-grade hepatosteatosis.
