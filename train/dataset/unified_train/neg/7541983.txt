from two independent fusions, fifteen mabs directed f protein the
bovine respiratory syncytial virus (brsv) characterized by
radio-immunoprecipitation assays. competition binding assays among mabs
identified two distinct antigenic sites (a b) one overlapping site (ab). 
all mabs specific epitopes belonging site neutralized the
infectivity virus vitro recognized human bovine rsv strains.
only two five mabs directed epitopes site b neutralizing
and three reacted rsv strains tested, suggesting the
epitopes constituting domain present heterogeneous characteristics. 
of sites b, one neutralizing mabs also inhibited cell fusion. the
biological relevance domains established competing representative
mabs sera brsv-infected calves.
