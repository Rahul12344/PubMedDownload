oseltamivir (tamiflu) accepted antiviral drug targets the
neuraminidase (na) protein inhibit viral release host cell. few
h1n1 influenza strains h274y mutation creates drug resistance to
oseltamivir. study, report flavonoid cyanidin-3-sambubiocide
(c3s) compound acts potential inhibitor h274y mutation. drug
resistance mechanism inhibitory activity c3s oseltamivir against
wild-type (wt) h274y mutant-type (mt) studied compared based on
the results molecular docking, molecular dynamics, quantum chemical
methods. oseltamivir found less binding affinity mt. c3s more
binding affinity wt mt proteins. dynamical study, 150th
loop mt protein found deformation wt. single h274y
mutation induces conformational changes 150th loop leads to
produce resistance oseltamivir. 150th cavity attractive
target c3s stop conformational changes mt, 430th cavity of
na protein. c3s stabilized mt number hydrogen bonds than
oseltamivir. electrostatic interaction energy shows stronger c3s binding
with mt compound may effective oseltamivir-resistant
virus strains.
