selection human cytomegalovirus variants presence ganciclovir or
foscarnet led 18 dna polymerase mutations, 14 previously
studied. using bacterial artificial chromosome technology, these
mutations individually transferred genome reference strain.
following reconstitution infectious viral stocks, mutant assessed for
its drug susceptibility growth kinetics cell culture. computer-assisted
three-dimensional (3d) modeling polymerase also used position 
of mutations one four proposed structural domains predict 
influence structural stability protein. among 10 dna polymerase
mutations selected ganciclovir, 7 (p488r, c539r, l545s, v787l, v812l, p829s,
and l862f) associated ganciclovir resistance, whereas 2 (f595i and
v946l) conferred foscarnet resistance. among eight mutations selected
with foscarnet, two (t552n s585a) conferred foscarnet resistance,
whereas four (n408d, k500n, l802v, l957f) impact ganciclovir
susceptibility. surprisingly, combination mutations, were
not associated resistance specific antiviral, resulted increasing
resistance effects. 3d modeling suggested none mutated residues 
directly involved polymerase catalytic site rather influence on
drug susceptibility modifying structural flexibility protein. our
study significantly adds number dna polymerase mutations conferring 
vitro drug resistance emphasizes point evaluation individual
mutations may accurately reflect phenotype conferred multiple
mutations.
