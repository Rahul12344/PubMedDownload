hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection major cause chronic hepatitis, liver
cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). hcv core protein considered 
a positive regulator telomerase activity. study, focused the
deregulated microrna-138 (mir-138) hcv-associated hcc. differential expression
of mir-138 determined taqman quantitative real-time pcr. target gene
of mir-138 verified luciferase reporter assay, quantitative real-time pcr,
and western blotting. moreover, three assays based telomerase activity, cell
proliferation, senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase activity performed.
the correlation analysis revealed significantly negative correlation between
mir-138 telomerase reverse transcriptase (tert) mrna expression hcc.
further, showed mature hcv core protein 173 amino acids, not
full-length form 191 amino acids, suppressed mir-138 expression. tert was
verified direct target mir-138 hcc cells. furthermore, tert-targeting 
mir-138 supplementation prevent hcv core protein repressing hcc cell
replicative senescence. collectively, hcv core protein enhance tert protein
expression downregulating tert-targeting mir-138 expression, in
turn inhibits hcc cell replicative senescence. study may help our
understanding pathogenic mechanisms hcv core protein hcv-associated 
hcc development. key message: mir-138 downregulated hcv-associated hcc.
mature hcv core protein plays pathogenic role suppressing mir-138
expression. telomerase reverse transcriptase represents direct target of
mir-138 hcc cells. mir-138 promotes hcc cell senescence, suggesting potential 
for hcc treatment.
