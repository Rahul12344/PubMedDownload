presence unmetabolized folic acid plasma, indicative folic acid
intake beyond metabolic capacity body, associated reduced
natural killer (nk) cell cytotoxicity postmenopausal women ≥50years. nk cells 
are cytotoxic lymphocytes part innate immune system critical 
surveillance defense virus-infected cancer cells. determined
if high folic acid diet result reduced nk cell cytotoxicity aged
mouse model. female c57bl/6 mice (16-month-old) fed ain-93m diet the
recommended daily allowance (1× rda, control) 20× rda (high) folic acid for
3months. nk cytotoxicity lower splenocytes mice fed high folic acid
diet compared mice control diet (p<.04). lower nk cell
cytotoxicity high folic acid fed mice could due lower mature
cytotoxic/naïve nk cell ratio (p=.03) compared control mice.
splenocytes mice high folic acid diet produced less interleukin (il)-10
when stimulated lipopolysaccharide (p<.05). difference nk cell
cytotoxicity dietary groups abolished splenocytes were
supplemented exogenous il-10 prior assessment nk cytotoxicity,
suggesting reduced nk cell cytotoxicity high folic acid group was
at least partially due reduced il-10 production. study demonstrates a
causal relationship high folic acid intake reduced nk cell
cytotoxicity provides insights potential mechanisms behind this
relationship.
