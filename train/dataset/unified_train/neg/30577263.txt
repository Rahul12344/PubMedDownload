background objectives: heart lung transplantation high-risk
procedure requiring intensive immunosuppressive therapy preventing organ
rejection. alemtuzumab, cd52-specific monoclonal antibody, increasingly used
for induction therapy compared conventional agents. however, 
no systematic review comparing efficacy traditional therapeutic drugs.
methods: pubmed embase searched october 1, 2017, articles on
alemtuzumab cardiothoracic transplant surgery. 433 studies retrieved, 8
were included final meta-analysis.
results: lung transplantation, alemtuzumab use associated lower odds 
of acute cellular rejection compared antithymocyte globulin (odds ratio
[or], 0.21; 95% ci, 0.11-0.40; p < .001), lower acute rejection rates (or, 0.12; 
95% ci, 0.03-0.55; p < .01), infection rates (or, 0.69; 95% ci, 0.35-1.36;
p = .33) compared basiliximab. multivariate meta-regression analysis
found mean age, male sex, single lung transplant, double lung transplant,
cytomegalovirus epstein-barr virus status, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,
cystic fibrosis, mean ischemic time significantly influence acute
rejection outcomes. heart transplantation, alemtuzumab use associated
with lower acute rejection rates compared tacrolimus (or, 0.44; 95% ci,
0.30-0.66; p < .001).
conclusions: alemtuzumab use associated lower rejection rates when
compared conventional induction therapy agents (antithymocyte globulin,
basiliximab, tacrolimus) heart lung transplantation. however, was
based observational studies. randomized controlled trials needed verify
its clinical use.
