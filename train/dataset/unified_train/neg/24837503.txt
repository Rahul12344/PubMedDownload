recent population-based studies demonstrated genetic heritability of
rubella vaccine response assessed hla system may explain 20%
of inter-individual variance humoral immune response vaccine. 
earlier studies compared hla allelic associations rubella vaccine-specific
antibodies two smaller cohorts healthy rochester, mn, children (346
and 396 subjects) two doses rubella-containing vaccine. study found
that specific hla alleles consistently associated rubella-specific
antibody titers (b*27:05, dpa1*02:01, dpb1*04:01 alleles). current study 
examined hla associations independent larger cohort 1012 healthy san
diego, ca, subjects (age 19-40 years) rubella vaccine order replicate
our previous findings rochester subjects. two hla associations of
comparable magnitudes consistently observed b*27:05 (median nt50
rochester cohort 48.9, p=0.067; san diego cohort 54.8, p=0.047) dpb1*04:01
(median nt50 rochester cohort 61.6, p<0.001; san diego cohort 70.8, p=0.084)
alleles rubella virus-neutralizing antibody titers. additional hla alleles
resulted consistent effects il-6 production cohorts, not
meet criteria statistical significance. data suggest hla alleles
play role rubella vaccine-induced immunity provide basis future 
studies may explain mechanism(s) hla polymorphisms affect
immune responses rubella vaccine.
