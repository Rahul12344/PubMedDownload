potyviruses variable single-stranded rna genomes many show clear
evidence recombination. report studied distribution recombination 
sites genomes 92 isolates potyvirus turnip mosaic virus (tumv); 
42 came international gene sequence databases additional 50
complete genomic sequences generated field samples collected europe 
and asia. sequences examined evidence recombination using seven
different sequence comparison methods exact position site was
confirmed sequence composition analysis. recombination sites found
throughout genomes, except small 6k1 protein gene, 24 
genomes (26%) showed evidence recombination. statistically significant
clusters recombination sites found p1 gene ci/6k2/vpg
gene region. recombination sites bordered upstream (5') region of
gc-rich downstream (3') region au-rich sequence similar length.
correlations presence type recombination site provenance, 
host type phylogenetic relationships discussed, role of
recombination tumv evolution.
