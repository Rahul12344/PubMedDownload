sixty eight nucleotide sequences encoding protein e west nile virus (wnv) 
were used phylogenetic analysis estimation evolution rate of
the wnv. nucleotide substitution accumulation rate evaluated 2.5 x 10(-4) 
substitutions per site per year. phylogenetic analysis divergence time
estimation carried using molecular clocks methodology showed that
genotypes 1, 2, 4 wnv circulated area european russia
with estimated divergence times common ancestor approximately 2360,
2800, 5950 years ago, respectively. non-synonymous (dn) synonymous
(ds) substitution values found 0.022-0.275 different wnv
strains grouped geographical and/or filogenetic characteristics. the
highest dn/ds values found group wnv isolates coming russia
and north america disseminated new regions past 14
years. estimation dn/ds wnv shows dn/ ds value used 
indicator intraspecies variability evaluation evolution rate
for new isolates wnv. confirms hypothesis favorable
conditions wide dissemination rapid evolution different' genotypes
of wnv occurring 2 6 thousand years ago modern geographical and
climatic conditions.
