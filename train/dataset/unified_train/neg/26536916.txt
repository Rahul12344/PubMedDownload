dengue tropical vector-borne disease without cure vaccine that
progressively spreads regions temperate climates. diagnostic tools
amenable resource-limited settings would highly valuable epidemiologic 
control containment outbreaks. here, present novel low-cost
automated biosensing platform detection dengue fever biomarker ns1 and
demonstrate ns1 spiked human serum. magnetic nanoparticles (mnps) are
coated high-affinity monoclonal antibodies ns1 via bio-orthogonal
cu-free 'click' chemistry anti-fouling surface molecular architecture. 
presence target antigen ns1 triggers mnp agglutination formation
of nanoclusters rapid kinetics enhanced external magnetic actuation. 
amount size nanoclusters correlate target concentration and
can quantified using optomagnetic readout method. resulting automated
dengue fever assay takes 8 minutes, requires 6 μl serum sample shows 
a limit detection 25 ng/ml upper detection range 20000 ng/ml.
the technology holds great potential applied ns1 detection patient 
samples. assay implemented low-cost microfluidic disc platform
is suited expansion multiplexed detection wide panel of
biomarkers.
