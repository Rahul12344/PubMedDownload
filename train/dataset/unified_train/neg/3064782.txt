the pjl6 expression vector derivatives, pjla16 panh-1, used
for synthesis high-level expression escherichia coli restriction
enzyme fragments derived envelope 3'-orf genes bh10 bh8
clones, respectively, human immunodeficiency virus (hiv-1). these
bacterially expressed proteins purified apparent homogeneity by
sequential detergent extraction, gel filtration, reverse-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography. recombinant proteins used
for production polyclonal monoclonal antibodies, fusion
proteins envelope gene currently evaluated use as
immunodiagnostic assay reagants.
