wild type pc12 pheochromocytoma cells infected a
wnt-1-carrying virus thus express wnt-1 (pc12/wnt-1) known acquire the
same flat cell phenotype spontaneously occurring pc12 flat cell
variants except latter presently express wnt-1. flat cell
variants pc12 cells exhibit markedly altered morphology gene expression.
in order assess possibility spontaneously occurring flat cell
variants could induced wild type pc12 cells previous transient
expression cell's endogenous wnt-1, isolated pc12/wnt-1 cells
expressing little wnt-1. spite absent wnt-1 expression, retained
their flat cell morphology, glutamate/aspartate transporter activity, increased
neu mrna levels lack norepinephrine transporter activity nerve
growth factor-induced differentiation. thus, wnt-1 expression required 
maintain flat cell phenotype. however, identified one gene, ret, whose
mrna level pc12 increased wnt-1 expression, whose
increased mrna level also dependent continual wnt-1 expression. this
finding suggests induction ret wnt-1 used elucidate 
wnt-induced signalling pathway mammalian cells.
