we consider simple mathematical models early population dynamics the
human immunodefficiency type 1 virus (hiv-1). although systems of
differential equations may solved numerical methods, general
theoretical results available due nonlinearities. analyze model whose
components plasma densities uninfected cd4+ t-cells infected cells
(assumed model proportional virion density). addition to
analyzing nature equilibrium points, show no
periodic limit-cycle solutions. depending values parameters,
solutions either tend without oscillation equilibrium point zero
virion density equilibrium point nonzero number 
virions. latter case approach equilibrium may damped
oscillations without oscillation.
