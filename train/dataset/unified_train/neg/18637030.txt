objectives: infections major cause morbidity mortality patients
with acute myeloid leukaemia (aml). primarily occur first course 
of induction chemotherapy may increase risk leukaemia relapse, due 
a significant delay consolidation therapy. intensification induction
chemotherapy use non-conventional drugs fludarabine are
considered responsible increased risk infections.
methods: study, retrospectively analysed infections occurred in
224 newly diagnosed aml patients </=65 yr, consecutively treated 1997 and
2002 induction regimen including fludarabine, arabinosyl cytosine and
idarubicin, without etoposide (flai/flaie), context three
multicentric prospective trials (aml97, aml99, aml02).
results: induction phase, 146 (65%) patients experienced fever of
undetermined origin (fuo), 30 (13%) 47 (21%) patients gram-negative and
positive bacteremias, respectively, 10 (4%) patients developed a
probable/proven invasive fungal infection (ifi). fatality rate for
gram-negative, gram-positive bacteremias probable/proven ifi 10%, 8% 
60% respectively. consolidation, 75 (35%) patients fuo, 43 (20%) and
40 (19%) patients gram-negative positive bacteremias, respectively, 5
(2%) patients developed probable/proven ifi. fatality rate for
gram-negative, gram-positive bacteremias probable/proven ifi 14%, 5% 
80% respectively. interestingly, overall incidence microbiologically
documented infections induction 38% incidence of
probable/proven ifis induction/consolidation programme 7%. no
infections caused viruses opportunistic pathogens observed neither
during induction, consolidation.
conclusions: data, although retrospectively collected, suggest that
fludarabine-based chemotherapy associated increased incidence of
infections, particular ifis, compared conventional regimens commonly used
for aml induction.
