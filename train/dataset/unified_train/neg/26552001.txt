bovine leukemia virus (blv) associated enzootic bovine leukosis is
closely related human cell leukemia virus (htlv). cytotoxic lymphocyte
(ctl) plays key role suppressing progression disease caused blv. t
and b cell epitopes blv studied, cd8(+) ctl epitopes remain
poorly understood. used library 115 synthetic peptides covering the
entirety env proteins (gp51 gp30), gag proteins (p15, p24, and
p12), tax protein blv identify 11 novel cd8(+) cell epitopes
(gp51n5, gp51n11, gp51n12, gp30n5, gp30n6, gp30n8, gp30n16, tax16, tax18, tax19, 
and tax20) four calves experimentally infected blv. number cd8(+) 
t cell epitopes could identified calf correlated blv
proviral load. interestingly, among 11 epitopes identified, gp51n11 
capable inducing cd8(+) cell-mediated cytotoxicity four calves, but
it suitable vaccine target shows high degree of
polymorphism according wu-kabat variability index. contrast, ctl
epitopes identified gag structural protein. addition, several
epitopes obtained gp30 tax, indicating cellular immunity
against blv strongly targeted proteins. cd8(+) ctl epitopes gp30
and tax less polymorphic epitopes from. indeed, peptides tax16, tax18, 
tax19, tax20 include leucine-rich activation domain encompasses a
transcriptional activation domain, gp30n16 peptide contains a
proline-rich region interacts protein tyrosine phosphatase shp1 to
regulate b cell activation. moreover, least one cd8(+) ctl epitope derived
from gp30 identified four calves. results indicate 
blv gp30 may best candidate development blv vaccine.
