west nile virus (wnv; family flaviviridae; genus flavivirus) group members an
important cause viral meningoencephalitis areas world. they
exhibit marked variation pathogenicity, viral lineages (such as
those north america) causing high prevalence severe neurological disease,
whilst others (such australian kunjin virus) rarely cause disease. aim 
this study characterize wnv disease mouse model elucidate 
pathogenetic features distinguish disease variation. tenfold dilutions of
five wnv strains (new york 1999, mrm16 three horse isolates wnv-kunjin:
boort two isolates 2011 australian outbreak) inoculated into
mice intraperitoneal route. isolates induced meningoencephalitis in
different proportions infected mice. wnvny99 pathogenic, the
three horse isolates intermediate pathogenicity wnvkunv-mrm16 the
least, causing mostly asymptomatic disease seroconversion. infectivity, 
not pathogenicity, related challenge dose. using cluster analysis the
recorded clinical signs, histopathological lesions antigen distribution
scores, cases could classified groups corresponding disease
severity. metrics important determining pathotype included
neurological signs (paralysis seizures), meningoencephalitis, brain antigen
scores replication extra-neural tissues. whereas mice infected with
wnvny99 extra-neural antigen, infected wnv-kunjin viruses only
occasionally antigen outside nervous system. conclude mouse
model could useful tool assessment pathotype wnvs.
