the gp41 membrane-proximal external region (mper) target broadly
neutralizing antibody responses human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(hiv-1). however, replication-defective virus vaccines currently evaluation
in clinical trials efficiently elicit mper-specific antibodies. structural
modeling suggests mper forms α-helical coiled coil required
for function immunogenicity. maintain native mper conformation, we
used reverse genetics engineer replication-competent reovirus vectors that
displayed mper sequences α-helical coiled-coil tail domain viral
attachment protein σ1. sequences reovirus strain type 1 lang (t1l) σ1 were
exchanged sequences encoding hiv-1 strain ba-l mper epitope 2f5 the
entire mper. individual 2f5 mper substitutions introduced at
virion-proximal virion-distal sites σ1 tail. recombinant reoviruses
containing heterologous hiv-1 sequences viable produced progeny yields
comparable wild-type virus. hiv-1 sequences retained following
10 serial passages cell culture, indicating substitutions were
genetically stable. recombinant viruses engineered display 2f5 epitope 
full-length mper σ1 recognized purified 2f5 antibody. inoculation of
mice 2f5-containing vectors rabbits 2f5- mper-containing vectors 
elicited anti-reovirus antibodies, hiv-1-specific antibodies not
detected. together, findings indicate heterologous sequences form
α-helices functionally replace native sequences α-helical tail domain 
of reovirus attachment protein σ1. however, although vectors retain native 
antigenicity, immunogenic, illustrating difficulty of
experimentally inducing immune responses essential region hiv-1.
importance vaccines protect hiv-1, causative agent aids, are
not approved use. antibodies neutralize genetically diverse strains of
hiv-1 bind discrete regions envelope glycoproteins, including gp41 
mper. engineered recombinant reoviruses displayed mper epitopes in
attachment protein σ1 (reo-mper vectors). reo-mper vectors replicated with
wild-type efficiency, genetically stable, retained native antigenicity. 
however, detect hiv-1-specific immune responses following inoculation 
of reo-mper vectors small animals. work provides proof principle
for engineering reovirus express antigenic epitopes illustrates the
difficulty eliciting mper-specific immune responses.
