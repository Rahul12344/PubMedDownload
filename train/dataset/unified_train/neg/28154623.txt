introduction: cervical cancer leading cause cancer deaths among females
in angola human papillomavirus (hpv) main risk factor the
development pre-cancerous squamous intraepithelial lesions. diversity 
frequency hpv types angola yet reported.
aim: determine frequency hpv among women squamous intraepithelial 
lesions women luanda, angola.
methods: study participants included women diagnosed cytological
abnormalities voluntarily provided pap smears (n = 64). genomic dna was
extracted samples use templates pcr amplification hpv
sequences. pcr products sequenced determine hpv type.
results: hpv dna detected 71.9% (46/64) samples. higher diversity
of hpv types found cytological lesions, ascus lsil (hpv16,
6, 18, 31, 58, 66, 70 82, order frequency) detected hsil 
and ssc (hpv16, 18, 6 33). prevalent hpv type were: hpv16, hpv6 
hpv18.
conclusion: first report hpv type diversity frequency woman
of angola. results suggest large-scale studies across africa would
improve understanding interrelationship hpv infections and
cervical cancer. directly, identification hpv types most
prevalent suggests women angola would benefit currently available
hpv vaccines.
