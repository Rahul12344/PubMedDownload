(prrsv) globally prevalent pig population. hev not
cause clinical disease pigs, zoonotic potential raised concerns the
food safety sector. prrs become endemic united kingdom (uk) since 
introduction 1991, continues cause considerable economic losses 
swine industry. better understanding current prevalence diversity of
prrsv hev uk, potential association, needed assess
risks target control measures appropriately. study used plasma, tonsil, 
and cecal content samples previously collected pigs 14 abattoirs in
england northern ireland study prevalence several pathogens
including prrsv hev. diversity prrsv strains detected samples
was analyzed sequencing open reading frame 5 (orf5), revealing substantial 
difference prrsv strains clinically unaffected pigs relative to
those clinical cases disease uk. despite potential
immuno-modulatory effect prrsv infection, previously demonstrated affect
salmonella hev shedding profiles, significant association found
between positive prrsv status positive hev status.
