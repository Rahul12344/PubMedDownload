the association simian virus 40 (sv40) dna plasmid dna subcellular
fractions either infected transfected cells examined. lytically
infected cells, approx. 25% viral specific dna infection cycle 
retained nuclei washing low ionic strength buffer 1% triton
x-100. viral replicating dna found nuclear matrix capable of
performing limited dna synthesis endogenous dna polymerase vitro. viral
dna synthesized vitro hybridized preferentially sv40 hind-iii b c
fragments proximity origin replication. in
plasmid-transfected cos-7 cells (sv40-transformed cells), amount plasmid
dna found nuclear matrix related replication efficiency in
cells. 80% plasmid dna tightly associated subnuclear
structures. little plasmid dna found cytoplasmic fraction. the
results suggest that, extrachromosomal model systems, association dna
with nuclear matrix important regulation dna replication.
