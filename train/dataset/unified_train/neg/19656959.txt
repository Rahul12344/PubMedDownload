tick-borne encephalitis virus (tbev) plays important role infectious human 
morbidity, particularly russia middle urals. siberian subtype of
tbev (s-tbev) dominant middle urals. determining origin s-tbev
strains territory also european part russia baltic 
countries important understanding cause distribution. 
surface glycoprotein e gene partially sequenced 165 s-tbev isolates
collected middle urals 1966 2008. nucleotide amino acid
sequence identity studied isolates 94 97.4 %, respectively. eighty 
per cent represented six clusters identical amino acid
sequences glycoprotein e fragment analysed. determined four types 
of isolate distribution explored territory: local, split, corridor and
diffuse. average rate nucleotide substitutions per site year(-1) is
estimated 1.56 x 10(-4). age s-tbev population evaluated 
be slightly less 400 years. phylogenetic analysis data comparison
with historical events indicate distribution s-tbev strains the
middle urals european part russia originated twice different foci
in western siberia. related first land road siberia the
trans-siberian way, functioned different times. main reason such
rapid distribution s-tbev strains anthropogenic factor, i.e. human
economic activity colonization new territories siberia the
recent past.
