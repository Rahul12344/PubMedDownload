background: first-generation enzyme immunoassay (eia) detection of
antibody hepatitis c virus (anti-hcv) approved may 1990, blood banking 
agencies recommended testing components inventory. many cases, one
or components units already transfused.
study design methods: donors reacted first-generation eias and
recipients components identified, anti-hcv test methods
(including first-generation eia, second-generation eia, recombinant
immunoblot assay [riba]) evaluated.
results: 66 donors identified anti-hcv-positive first-generation eia, 17
were positive second-generation eia. 17, 9 reacted riba; 6 of
these showed evidence hcv infection polymerase chain reaction (4) and/or
probable transmission hcv transfusion recipient (3). 48 specimens 
that positive first-generation eia negative second-generation eia,
only 1 positive riba; serum available polymerase chain
reaction testing, living transfusion recipients to
assess evidence transmission hcv.
conclusion: study documents low predictive value eias anti-hcv in
a low-prevalence blood donor population emphasizes need additional
testing confirm specificity samples react screening tests.
