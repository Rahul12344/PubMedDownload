rotavirus gastroenteritis major cause severe dehydrating diarrhea in
children worldwide. group rotavirus causes approximately 40% hospitalization
for diarrhea among 5 years children. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(page) silver staining applied detect rotavirus dsrna acute
diarrheic stool 776 hospitalized children five years. study was
conducted mymensingh district, bangladesh january 2013 december 2014. 
among 776 stool specimens tested 368(47.4%) positive page. among 368
positive 341(92.5%) showed clearly stained electrophoretic patterns viral rna 
which enabled classification different electropherotypes. rate 
infection highest children 7-12 months age infection rate was
more winter. rna profiles analyzed specimens, 164/341 (48%) long
and 177/341 (52%) short patterns. mixed electropherotypes (2%) among 368
were also detected. electropherotyping technique could applied excellent
method studying genomic variation, tracing mixed infections, detecting
atypical rotaviruses.
