to define predictors bacteremia assess potential role exposure
to cytomegalovirus (cmv) risk factor bacteremia liver transplant
recipients, intention-to-treat analysis data 146 orthotopic liver
transplant recipients participated multicenter, randomized, intervention
trial undertaken. fifty-eight episodes bacteremia occurred 40 (27.4%)
of 146 patients within 1 year transplantation. bacteremia diagnosed a
median 39.5 days (range, 1-325 days) transplantation. one-year mortality
rates higher among patients bacteremia among without
bacteremia (47.5% [19 40] vs. 18% [19 106], respectively; p = .001). a
time-dependent multivariate analysis variables significantly (p < or
= .05) associated bacteremia univariate analysis showed donor
cmv seropositivity (relative risk [rr], 3.4; 95% confidence interval [ci],
1.6-6.6; p = .0005), age younger 16 years (rr, 2.6; 95% ci, 1.3-5.2; p < 
.0059), major abdominal operation transplantation excluding
retransplantation (rr, 3.8; 95% ci, 1.8-8.0; p = .0004) independently
associated bacteremia. epidemiologic data suggest exposure cmv
from donated organ independent risk factor bacteremia orthotopic
liver transplant recipients.
