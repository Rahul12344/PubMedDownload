the considerable heterogeneity number severity symptoms observed in
autism spectrum disorders (asd) regarded obstacle future
research. authors believe clinical heterogeneity results the
complex interplay many genetic environmental factors themselves
define condition multifactorial. however, important note that
neuropathological findings idiopathic syndromic autism suggests a
single pathophysiological mechanism acting brain development: the
heterochronic division germinal cells subsequent migrational abnormalities
of daughter cells target fields. multiple exogenous (e.g., viruses,
drugs) endogenous (e.g., genetic mutations) factors known disrupt 
division germinal cells provide autism phenotype. variety of
endogenous exogenous factors, timing action brain
development, genetic susceptibility affected individuals (a triple hit
hypothesis) may account clinical heterogeneity asd.
