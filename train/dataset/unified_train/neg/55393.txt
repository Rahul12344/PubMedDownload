measurement dengue virus-specific double-stranded ribonucleic acid infected
primate cell extracts microquantitative complement-fixation methods.

lubiniecki as, pfancuff m, mitchell j.

microquantitative complement-fixation methods applied detection 
and quantitation double-stranded rna (dsrna) cytoplasmic extracts of
uninfected dengue virus-infected primate cell lines. llc-mk2 pglc-33h
cells exhibited increased levels dsrna following dengue virus infection.
cytoplasmic extracts infected uninfected llc-mk2 cells subjected to
density gradient analysis showed increased levels dsrna associated
with structures believed virus-specific. primate cell dsrna dengue
dsrna preferentially reacted rabbit anti-rin-rcn, reovirus dsrna and
ran-containing synthetic duplexes preferentially reacted anti-ran-run.
