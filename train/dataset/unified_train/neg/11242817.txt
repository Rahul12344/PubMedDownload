objective: examine causes low cure rate district level a
tuberculosis (tb) control programme formulate, implement, evaluate 
intervention improve situation.
methods: study setting mzuzu (population 60,000), annual
smear-positive pulmonary tb incidence 160 per 100,000 human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) seroprevalence 67% among tb patients. is
one tb treatment unit, several organizations involved tb
control. examination case-holding activities carried out, potential
areas improvement identified, interventions performed.
findings: 1990-91, cure rate 24% among smear-positive cases (29% among
survivors end treatment). problems identified included fragmented tb
control programme; inadequate training supervision; suboptimal recording of
patients' addresses; nonadherence national tb control programme protocols.
these problems addressed, 1992-93 cure rate rose 68% (relative
risk (rr) = 2.85 (95% confidence interval (ci) = 1.63, 4.96)) 92% among
survivors end treatment (rr = 3.12 (95% ci = 1.84, 5.29)). high cure
rates therefore achievable despite high hiv prevalence.
conclusions: simple, inexpensive, local programmatic interventions can
dramatically improve tb case holding. study demonstrates need for
evaluation, training, supervision levels programme.
