herpesviruses consistently transmit immunocompetent carriers, implying 
their neutralization hard achieve. murid herpesvirus-4 (muhv-4) exploits
host igg fc receptors bypass blocks cell binding, ph-dependent protein 
conformation changes unveil fusion machinery endocytosis.
nevertheless, neutralization remains possible targeting virion
glycoprotein h (gh)-gl heterodimer, neutralizing antibody responses of
muhv-4 carriers improved boosting recombinant gh-gl. analysed here
how gh-gl-directed neutralization works. muhv-4 gh-gl binds heparan
sulfate. however, gh-gl-specific neutralizing antibodies block 
interaction; neither act directly fusion. instead, blocked
virion endocytosis transport late endosomes, membrane fusion
normally occurs. poor endocytosis gh-gl-neutralized virions was
recapitulated precisely virions genetically lacking gl. therefore, driving
virion uptake appears important function gh-gl provides major 
target antibody-mediated neutralization.
