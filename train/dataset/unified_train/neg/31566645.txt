the early detection low abundance anti-hepatitis c virus antibody (anti-hcv
ab) critical efficient diagnosis treatment hcv infection. this
work, new colorimetric assay method proposed sensitive
detection anti-hcv ab. method, antibody-induced dna strand
displacement resulting rolling circle amplification (rca) integrated 
to generate large amount tandemly repeated g-quadruplex dnazymes arm 
of "y"-shaped antibody. consequently, oxidation of
3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine extensively catalyzed the
peroxidase-mimicking dnazymes. therefore, readout signal greatly
amplified. studies reveal 0.998 pm anti-hcv ab detected by
this newly developed assay method. moreover, strategy proposed method
can adapted detection antibodies bivalent targets.
