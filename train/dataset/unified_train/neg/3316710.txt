using dna probe avian transforming virus, nk24, contains fos
gene newly isolated characterized (m. nishizawa, n. goto, s.
kawai, j. virol. 61:3733-3740, 1987), cloned sequenced chicken c-fos
gene. results showed gene, like mouse human c-fos gene, contains
four exons encoding predicted gene product 367 amino acids about
79% homologous p55c-fos (mouse), excluding several small insertions gaps.
the predicted gene product, however, contains two nonhomologous regions, as
suggested sequence analysis nk24 genome. half identical amino
acids gene products encoded different codons, the
guanine-plus-cytosine content third letter codon used the
entire chicken c-fos coding region high (93%). 5'-flanking region the
tata box contains sequence homologous putative transcriptional
regulatory sequence mouse human c-fos gene. 3'-noncoding region 
chicken c-fos strikingly homologous mouse human c-fos covers
a 67-base-pair adenine-plus-thymine-rich stretch previously reported to
be essential inhibitory effect expression mouse c-fos gene.
