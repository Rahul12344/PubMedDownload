objectives: objective present study identify effective
cervical cancer screening algorithm incorporating different combinations of
cytology, hpv testing genotyping.
methods: women 25-55years old recruited "hermes" (hellenic real life
multicentric cervical screening) study screened terms cytology and
high-risk (hr) hpv testing hpv 16/18 genotyping. women positive cytology
or/and hrhpv referred colposcopy, biopsy treatment. ten screening
algorithms based different combinations cytology, hpv testing hpv 16/18
genotyping investigated terms diagnostic accuracy.
results: three clusters algorithms formed according balance
between effectiveness harm caused screening. cluster showing best 
balance included two algorithms based co-testing two based hpv primary 
screening hpv 16/18 genotyping. among these, hrhpv testing hpv 16/18
genotyping reflex cytology (atypical squamous cells undetermined
significance - ascus threshold) presented optimal combination sensitivity 
(82.9%) specificity relative cytology alone (0.99) 1.26 false
positive rate relative cytology alone.
conclusion: hpv testing hpv 16/18 genotyping, referring hpv 16/18 positive
women directly colposcopy, hrhpv (non 16/18) positive women reflex
cytology (ascus threshold), triage method colposcopy, reflects best
equilibrium screening effectiveness harm. algorithms, based on
cytology initial screening method, co-testing hpv primary without
genotyping, hpv primary genotyping without cytology triage, are
not supported according present analysis.
