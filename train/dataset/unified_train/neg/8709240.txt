the hepadnavirus p gene contains amino acid sequences share homology with
all known rnases h. study, made four mutants single amino
acids duck hepatitis b virus (dhbv) rnase h region altered. two of
them, amino acids locations comprising putative catalytic site were
changed, remaining mutants alterations amino acids conserved
among hepadnaviruses. transfection mutant genomes permissive cells 
resulted synthesis several discrete viral nucleic acid species, ranging 
apparent sizes approximately 500 3,000 bp, numbered i, ii, iii, iv, and
v. locations species similar mutants, the
proportions species varied among mutants. analysis nucleic acid
species revealed hybrid molecules rna minus-strand dna,
indicating rnase h activity missing greatly reduced these
mutants. primer extension experiments showed mutant viruses initiated
minus-strand viral dna synthesis normally. 3' termini minus-strand dna 
species ii, iii, iv mapped downstream nucleotides 1659, 1220,
and 721, respectively. species v contained essentially full-length minus-strand
viral dna. parallel amino acid change putative catalytic site hbv
rnase h domain resulted accumulation low-molecular-weight hybrid molecules 
consisting rna minus-strand dna similar size pattern those
seen dhbv. studies demonstrate experimentally involvement the
c-terminal portion p gene rnase h activity dhbv human
hepatitis b virus indicate amino acids essential rnase h
activity hepadnavirus p protein also important efficient
elongation minus-strand viral dna.
