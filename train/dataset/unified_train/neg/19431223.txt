the objective study evaluate candida oral colonization human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected patients undergoing long-term highly active
antiretroviral therapy (arv). cross-sectional study included 331 hiv
patients, diagnosed 1983 2003. oral swabs performed, candida
species determined using id 32c. isolates tested antifungal
susceptibility. clinical laboratory data collected identify the
association candida colonization. total, 161 candida isolates were
detected among 147 331 patients (44%), independently time hiv 
infection diagnosed. candida albicans strains represented 137 (85%) the
isolates, susceptible tested antifungal drugs. among the
non-c. albicans strains, six isolates dose-dependently susceptible to
fluconazole, nine itraconazole, seven ketoconazole. isolation of
candida significantly higher patients virological failure (83/147; p 
0.0002) cd4(+) t-lymphocyte counts <200 cells/mm(3) (30/83; p 0.0003).
recovery candida oral cavity independent protease inhibitor (pi)
usage (p 0.60). colonized patients typically underwent salvage therapy (p 0.003),
and episodes opportunistic fungal infections (p 0.046) and
malignancies (p 0.004).oral candida colonization patients arv therapy
was associated immunosupressed status hiv-infected patients, i.e. low
number cd4(+) t-cells per cubic millimetre, failure arv therapy (salvage
therapy), higher number opportunistic infections malignancies. despite
the fact pis vitro antifungal activity, use class of
antiretroviral agent influence presence candida oral cavity
