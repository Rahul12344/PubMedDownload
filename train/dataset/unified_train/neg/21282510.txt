how naive cell repertoire arises forms memory repertoire still
poorly understood. relationship analyzed taking advantage the
focused tcr usage hla-a2-restricted cd8 memory cell responses influenza
m1(58-66). analyzed rearranged bv19 genes cd8 single-positive thymocytes,
a surrogate naive repertoire, 10 hla-a2 individuals. cdr3 amino acid
sequences associated response influenza observed higher
frequencies expected chance, indicator preselection. propose
that rearrangement mechanism involving long p-nucleotide addition j2.7
region explains part increase. special rearrangement mechanisms can
result identical cells different individuals, referred public
responses. indeed, rearrangements utilizing long p nucleotide additions 
commonly observed response m1(58-66) epitope 30 hla-a2
middle-aged adults. thus, addition negative positive selection, special
rearrangement mechanisms may influence composition naive repertoire,
resulting robust responses pathogen individuals.
