pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis revealed genomes of
some pathogenic escherichia coli o157:h7 strains, including edl933, were
resistant noti digestion. amino acid sequence comparison suggested the
z2389 gene carried prophage cp-933r strain edl933 likely encode a
c(5)-cytosine methyltransferase. z2389-equivalent gene found the
noti-resistant strains tested, detected noti-susceptible
strains. pfge analysis wild-type edl933 strain z2389 null mutant 
revealed z2389 associated full genome protection noti
digestion partial protection eagi digestion. vitro methylation
experiments purified recombinant protein demonstrated z2389 capable 
of methylating noti eagi sites. sequencing bisulfite-treated dna indicated
that methylation occurred first cytosine residue noti
recognition sequence, whereas eagi sites remained unmethylated methylated
at first cytosine residue. thus, z2389 encodes dna cytosine
methyltransferase confers full protection noti sites.
