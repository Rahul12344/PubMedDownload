the performance recently developed real-time pcr system, existation hbv 
diagnostic system, quantitation hepatitis b virus (hbv) human blood was
evaluated. detection limit, reproducibility, cross-reactivity, and
interference evaluated measures analytical performance. the
comparison study, 100 hbv-positive blood samples 100 hbv-negative samples
from korean blood bank serum used, results existation hbv
system showed good correlation obtained using cobas taqman
(r2=0.9931) abbott real-time pcr systems (r2=0.9894). lower limit of
detection measured 9.55 iu/ml using standards dynamic range
was linear 6.68 6.68×10(9) iu/ml using cloned plasmids. within-run
coefficient variation (cv) 9.4%, 2.1%, 1.1%, total cv was
11.8%, 3.6%, 1.7% concentration 1.92 log10 iu/ml, 3.88 log10 iu/ml,
and 6.84 log10 iu/ml, respectively. cross-reactivity interference was
detected. existation hbv diagnostic system showed satisfactory analytical
sensitivity, excellent reproducibility, cross-reactivity, interference, and
high agreement cobas taqman abbott real-time pcr systems, is
therefore useful tool detection monitoring hbv infection.
