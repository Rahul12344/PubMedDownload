a recombinant baculovirus, vac alpha hcg, replacement viral
polyhedrin gene cdna encoding alpha subunit hcg used to
express alpha hcg, extensively glycosylated hormone, insect cells.
virus-infected cells, 72 h pi, secreted approximately 11.3 micrograms alpha hcg/2
x 10(6) cells/ml identical native hormonal peptide terms of
electrophoretic mobility, immunoreactivity bioactivity association with
beta subunit, evident binding rat testicular cells induction 
steroidogenesis mouse leydig cell bioassay system. alpha hcg secreted
into medium represented approximately 20-30% total hcg synthesized 
vac alpha cg infected insect cells. implications using late
promoter, baculovirus expression system, directing transcription 
a gene whose gene product requires extensive post-translational modifications are
discussed.
