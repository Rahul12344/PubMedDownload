background: goal study understand gene expression signatures
of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) recurrence subjects hepatitis c virus
(hcv) infection. recurrence-free survival (rfs) following curative resection of
hcc subjects hcv highly variable. traditional clinico-pathological
endpoints recognized weak predictors rfs. suggested that
gene expression profiling hcc nontumoral liver tissue may improve
prediction rfs, aid understanding underlying liver disease, and
guide individualized patient management. frozen samples tumors and
nontumoral liver obtained 47 subjects hcv-associated hcc.
additional nontumoral liver samples obtained hcv-free subjects with
metastatic liver tumors. gene expression profiling data used determine the
molecular signature hcv-associated hcc develop predictor rfs.
results: molecular profile hcv-associated hcc confirmed central roles 
for myc tgfbeta1 liver tumor development. gene expression tumors was
found poor predictive power regards rfs, analysis of
nontumoral tissues yielded strong predictor rfs late-recurring (>1 year)
subjects. importantly, nontumoral tissue-derived gene expression predictor rfs
was highly significant univariable multivariable cox proportional
hazard model analyses.
conclusions: microarray analysis nontumoral tissues subjects with
hcv-associated hcc delivers novel molecular signatures rfs, especially among
the late-recurrence subjects. gene expression predictor may hold important
insights pathobiology hcc recurrence de novo tumor formation in
cirrhotic patients.
