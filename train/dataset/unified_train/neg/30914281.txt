γδ cells unique population lymphocytes regulatory roles in
patients chronic hepatitis b (chb); however, role acute hepatitis b
(ahb) infection remains unclear. phenotype function γδ cells were
analyzed 29 ahb patients, 28 chb patients, 30 healthy controls (hcs) using
immunofunctional assays. compared hcs chb patients, decreased peripheral
and increased hepatic γδ cells found ahb patients. increased hepatic γδ
t cells ahb patients attributed elevated hepatic chemokine levels.
peripheral γδ cells exhibited highly activated terminally differentiated
memory phenotype ahb patients. consistently, peripheral γδ cells ahb
patients showed increased cytotoxic capacity enhanced antiviral activity
which proved longitudinal study. activated γδ cells ahb
patients exhibited increased cytotoxicity capacity viral clearance
associated liver injury control infection.
