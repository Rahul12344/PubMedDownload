transmission electron microscopy used confirm presence picorna-like
virus particles presumed homalodisca coagulata virus-1 (hocv-1) the
midgut region adult glassy-winged sharpshooters (gwss). addition, offer 
a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) assay the
detection virus sensitivity approximately 95 genome
equivalents. survey employing assay conjunction gwss samples
collected throughout united states including california, hawaii, florida
georgia, carolinas revealed fairly widespread pattern distribution, 
although potentially restricted temperate regions, areas elevated host
densities, populations common origin. virus found naturally
infect adults regardless host plant specific particular
lifestage sex. examination alternate leafhopper species further
demonstrated that, although infection ubiquitous sharpshooter
genera, hocv-1 limited homalodisca vitripennis (=h. coagulata).
