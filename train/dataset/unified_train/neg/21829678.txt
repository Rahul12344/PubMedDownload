m2 channel, influenza virus transmembrane protein, serves important
target antiviral drug design. still discordances concerning the
role residues involved proton transfer well mechanism of
inhibition commercial drugs. viral m2 proteins show high conservativity;
about 3/4 positions occupied one residue 95%. nine m2
proteins h3n2 strain possibly two proteins h2n2 strains make 
phylogenic cluster closely related 2rlf. variability range limited 4
residues/position one exception. 2rlf protein stands presence
of 2 serines positions 19 50, m2 proteins
occupied cysteines. study correlated mutations shows are
several positions significant mutational correlation been
described far functionally important. 5 residues
potentially involved m2 mechanism action. original software used in
this work (consensus constructor, ssssg, corm, talana) freely accessible as
stand-alone offline applications upon request authors. software 
used work freely available online noncommercial purposes public
services bioinformatics expasy ncbi. study mutational
variability, evolutionary relationship, correlated mutation presented this
paper potential way explain completely role significant
factors proton channel action clarify inhibition mechanism by
specific drugs.
