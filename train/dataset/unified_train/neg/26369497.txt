this paper presents studies ultrastructural analysis plant tissue
infected different pathotypes pepino mosaic virus (pepmv) the
immunolocalization viral coat proteins. pepmv virus replicates
with high mutation rate exhibits significant genetic diversity, therefore, 
isolates pepmv display wide range symptoms infected plants. this
work, tomato plants beta lux cultivar inoculated mechanically with
three pathotypes representing chilean 2 (ch2) genotype: mild (pepmv-p22),
necrotic (pepmv-p19) yellowing (pepmv-p5-iy). presence viral particles
in infected plants different compartments various cell types (i.e. 
spongy palisade mesophyll, sieve elements xylem vessels) revealed via
ultrastructural analyses. first time, possible demonstrate 
presence crystalline inclusions, composed virus-like particles. the
later stage pepmv infection (14 dpi) various pathotype-dependent changes in
the structure individual organelles (i.e. mitochondria, chloroplasts) were
found. strongest immunogold labeling viral coat proteins also
observed plants infected necrotic isolates. large number viral coat
proteins marked plant conductive elements, xylem phloem.
