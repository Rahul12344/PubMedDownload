background: psoriasis chronic, immune-mediated angiogenesis-dependent
disease. activated keratinocytes psoriatic lesions produce pro-angiogenic
cytokines, including vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf), binds to
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (vegfr) promotes cell
proliferation angiogenesis. sorafenib (bay 43-9006) molecular
multikinase inhibitor raf kinase, platelet-derived growth factor (pdgf),
vegfr-1, -2, -3, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (pdgfr)-β c-kit.
this molecule inhibits tumor cell proliferation angiogenesis is
currently approved treatment hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc).
case report: present complete remission resistant psoriasis a
hepatitis c virus (hcv)-infected cirrhotic patient treated with
sorafenib, recurrent hcc.
conclusion: several targeted therapies demonstrated efficacy against
psoriasis. research well-designed studies, novel drugs those
already marketed indications, needed determine value as
potential novel therapies psoriasis.
