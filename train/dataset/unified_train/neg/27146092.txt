the movement protein nsm tomato spotted wilt tospovirus (tswv) plays pivotal
roles viral intercellular trafficking. recently, tswv nsm also
identified avirulence (avr) determinant sw-5b-mediated
hypersensitive response (hr). however, whether cell-to-cell movement nsm
is coupled function hr induction remains obscure. here, showed 
the nsm mutants defective targeting plasmodesmata cell-to-cell movement
were still capable inducing sw-5b-mediated hr. addition, introduction 
single amino-acid substitution, c118y t120n, identified previously tswv
resistance-breaking isolates, movement-defective nsm mutants resulted in
the failure hr induction. collectively, results showed the
intercellular trafficking nsm uncoupled function hr induction. 
these findings shed light evolutionary mechanism r-avr recognition 
may used explain uncoupled phenomenon observed many
different viruses.
