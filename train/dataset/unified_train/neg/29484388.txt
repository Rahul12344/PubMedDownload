among brain tumors diagnosed children, medulloblastomas (mbs) are
associated poor prognosis. etiology mb fully understood, yet
the impact epigenetic alterations oncogenes previously been
established. past decade, human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) been
detected several types cancer, including mb. since dna methylation occurs
in cell nucleus considered host defence response, studied
the impact hcmv infection dna methyltransferase (dnmt‑1) mb (d324)
cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs) well mb tissue
sections. hypothesized infection dnmt‑1 intracellular localization
are linked. uninfected hcmv‑infected d324 cells huvecs analyzed 
hcmv immediate early (hcmv‑ie) protein, hcmv‑glycoprotein b (hcmv‑gb) dnmt‑1 
using immunofluorescence staining quantitative elisa. dnmt‑1 localized the
nucleus uninfected hcmv‑ie- expressing d324 cells huvecs, but
accumulated extra nuclear space hcmv‑gb-positive cells. inhibition 
of hcmv late protein expression cymevene® (ganciclovir) prevented the
cytoplasmic localization dnmt‑1. treatment hcmv‑ infected d324 cells and
huvecs methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5aza), significantly
increased hcmv‑ie hcmv‑gb gene transcription protein expression.
immunohistochemical staining dnmt‑1 hcmv proteins mb cancer tissue
sections revealed nuclear cytoplasmic dnmt‑1 localization. in
conclusion, dnmt‑1 resides cytoplasm hcmv‑gb-expressing huvecs d324
cells. increased viral protein synthesis 5aza-treated cells suggests hcmv
replication may benefit dna methyltransferase-free cellular environment.
our findings emphasize importance assessing potential viral activation 
the treatment mb patients epigenetic drugs.
