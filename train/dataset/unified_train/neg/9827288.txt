we conducted pilot, open-label study assess effect short-term
beta-carotene administration (180 mg/d meals 4 weeks) plasma
human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) rna levels cd4+ lymphocyte counts 21
hiv-infected patients. found plasma hiv rna levels cd4+ lymphocyte
counts change following short course beta-carotene
supplementation. patients lower serum concentrations beta-carotene before
supplementation likely increase cd4+ lymphocyte 
count plasma hiv rna copy number higher concentrations.
no correlation found pre- postsupplementation beta-carotene or
vitamin concentrations pre- postsupplementation cd4+ lymphocyte counts
or plasma hiv rna titers. study provides support beta-carotene
supplementation hiv-infected subjects normal baseline serum levels of
beta-carotene vitamin a.
