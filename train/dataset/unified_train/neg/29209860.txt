singapore grouper iridovirus (sgiv) one major causative agents fish 
diseases caused significant economic losses aquaculture industry. 
there currently commercial vaccine effective antiviral treatment against
sgiv infection. annually, increasing number small molecule compounds from
various sources produced, many proved potential
inhibitors viruses. here, high-throughput vitro cell viability-based
screening assay developed identify antiviral compounds sgiv using 
the luminescent-based celltiter-glo reagent cultured grouper spleen cells by
quantificational measurement cytopathic effects induced sgiv infection.
this assay utilized screen potential sgiv inhibitors five
customized compounds reported capable inhibiting other
viruses 30 compounds isolated various marine organisms, three of
them [ribavirin, harringtonine, 2-hydroxytetradecanoic acid (2-hom)] were
identified effective inhibiting sgiv infection, further
confirmed droplet digital pcr (ddpcr). addition, ddpcr results
revealed ribavirin 2-hom inhibited sgiv replication entry a
dose-dependent manner, harringtonine could reduce sgiv replication rather
than entry working concentration without significant toxicity. these
findings provided easy reliable cell viability-based screening assay to
identify compounds anti-sgiv effect way studying anti-sgiv
mechanism compounds.
