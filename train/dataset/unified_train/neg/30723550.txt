understanding hiv-1 variants likely transmitted important
for vaccine design predicting virus evolution. since infections are
founded single variants, suggested selection transmission 
has key role governing variants transmitted. show the
composition viral population within donor time transmission 
is also important. support argument, developed probabilistic model
describing hiv-1 transmission untreated population, parameterised the
model using within-host next generation sequencing data population-level
epidemiological data heterosexual transmission. basic hiv-1
transmission models cannot explain simultaneously low probability of
transmission non-negligible proportion infections founded multiple 
variants. model, transmission occur environmental conditions
are appropriate (e.g. abrasions present genital tract potential
recipient), allowing observations reconciled. well reproducing 
features transmission real populations, model demonstrates that,
contrary expectation, simple link number viral
variants number viral particles founding new infection. these
quantities depend timing transmission, infections founded
with small numbers variants yet large numbers particles. including
selection, bias towards early transmission (e.g. due treatment), acts 
enhance conclusion. addition, find infections initiated by
multiple variants likely derived donors intermediate
set-point viral loads, individuals high set-point viral loads
as might expected. therefore emphasise importance considering viral 
diversity donors, timings transmissions, trying discern the
complex factors governing single multiple variant transmission.
