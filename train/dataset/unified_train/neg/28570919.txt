human papillomaviruses causative agents several human diseases ranging
from genital warts ano-genital oropharyngeal cancers. currently only
symptoms hpv induced disease treated; antivirals available
that directly target viral life cycle. previously, determined the
cellular protein topbp1 interacts hpv16 replication/transcription factor
e2. e2-topbp1 interaction essential optimal e1-e2 dna replication and
for viral life cycle. drug calcein disrupts interaction topbp1
with host proteins promote cell death. demonstrate
that calcein blocks hpv16 e1-e2 dna replication via blocking viral
replication complex forming origin replication. occurs at
non-toxic levels calcein demonstrates specificity block the
ability e2 regulate transcription. propose calcein derivatives
could developed anti-hpv therapeutic.
