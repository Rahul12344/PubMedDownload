although suggested hepatitis delta virus (hdv) used 
vector deliver biologically active rnas hepatocytes, modified hdv a
specific transporting replicating vector anti-viral research 
investigated. study, focused development hdv a
replicative vector deliver hammerhead ribozyme hepatocytes study 
of roles delivered hammerhead ribozyme replication hepatitis b
virus (hbv). investigate effects ribozyme delivered hdv hbv
replication, designed two hammerhead ribozymes specifically target the
hepatitis b virus genome. two ribozymes inserted genome 
of hepatitis delta virus. results showed transfection cells tandem
modified hdv cdna resulted production monomer form sense and
anti-sense genomic rna indicating recombinant hdv-ribozyme could replicate
effectively. data also indicated ribozymes delivered modified hdv
had higher level inhibition activity hbv replication of
ribozyme alone. system provides new approach study mechanisms
of hbv replication well potential treatment hbv infection.
