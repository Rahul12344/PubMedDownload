factors limiting adoption ipsc technology include cost developing
lines time period takes characterize bank them,
particularly integration free, feeder free, xeno-free components are
used. manuscript describe optimization procedure enables a
single technician make 20-40 lines time 24-96 well format a
reliable reproducible fashion. improvements spanned entire workflow and
included using rna virus, reducing cytotoxicity reagents, developing improved 
transfection freezing efficiencies, modifying manual colony picking
steps, enhancing passaging efficiency developing early criteria success.
these modifications allowed us make two hundred well-characterized
lines per year.
