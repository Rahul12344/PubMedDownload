background: transmaternal exposure tobacco, microbes, nutrients, other
environmental factors shapes fetal immune system epigenetic
processes. gastric microbe helicobacter pylori represents ancestral
constituent human microbiota causes gastric disorders one hand
and inversely associated allergies chronic inflammatory conditions on
the other.
objective: investigate consequences transmaternal exposure h
pylori utero and/or lactation susceptibility viral bacterial
infection, predisposition allergic airway inflammation, development of
immune cell populations lungs lymphoid organs.
methods: use experimental models house dust mite- ovalbumin-induced
airway inflammation influenza a virus citrobacter rodentium infection
along metagenomics analyses, multicolor flow cytometry, bisulfite
pyrosequencing, study effects h pylori allergy severity and
immunologic microbiome correlates thereof.
results: perinatal exposure h pylori extract immunomodulator
vacuolating cytotoxin confers robust protective effects allergic airway
inflammation first- also second-generation offspring not
increase susceptibility viral bacterial infection. immune correlates of
allergy protection include skewing regulatory effector cells, expansion
of regulatory t-cell subsets expressing cxcr3 retinoic acid-related orphan
receptor γt, demethylation forkhead box p3 (foxp3) locus. the
composition diversity gastrointestinal microbiota measurably
affected perinatal h pylori exposure.
conclusion: conclude exposure h pylori consequences for
the carrier also subsequent generations exploited for
interventional purposes.
