introduction: protozoa enter blood stream tissues often
survive replicate adapt resisting natural host defenses. 
the interaction immune system infectious organisms dynamic interplay
of host mechanisms aimed eliminating infections microbial strategies
designed permit survival face powerful effector mechanisms. protozoa
cause chronic persistent infections, natural immunity is
weak protozoa evolved multiple mechanisms evading and
resisting specific immunity.
natural specific immune response protozoa: different protozoa vary greatly
in structural biochemical properties stimulate distinct patterns of
immune responses evolved unique mechanisms evading specific
immunity. protozoa activate quite distinct specific immune responses, are
different responses fungi, bacteria viruses. protozoa may be
phagocytozed macrophages, many resistant phagocytic killing may
even replicate within macrophages. t. brucei gambiense best example of
protozoa induce humoral immune response extra-cellular
location. leishmania sp. infections, cellular defense mechanisms depend upon
cd4+ t-lymphocytes activate macrophages effector cells regulated 
by cytokines th1 subset. plasmodium sp. protozoa show diversity
of defence mechanisms cellular humoral, depending ag and
protozoa's location.
immune evasion mechanisms protozoa: different protozoa developed
remarkably effective ways resisting specific immunity: a) anatomic
sequestration commonly observed protozoa plasmodium t. gondii; b)
some protozoa become resistant immune effector mechanisms: trypanosoma,
leishmania t. gondii; c) protozoa developed effective mechanisms
for varying surface antigens: plasmodium trypanosoma; d) protozoa 
shed antigen coats, either spontaneously binding specific
antibodies: e. histolytica; e) protozoa alter host immune response by
nonspecific generalized immunosuppression (abnormalities cytokine
production, deficient cell activation): trypanosoma, leishmania, toxoplasma,
entamoeba.
conclusion: protozoa activate numerous, different immune mechanisms human
body. evolution, progression outcome diseases depend upon these
mechanisms. resent progresses research defined selected ag as
candidates new vaccines. better definitions regarding role cytokines
in protozoan infections facilitate rational development cytokines and
cytokine antagonists use immunotherapeutic agents.
