objective: define genotypic phenotypic resistance patterns following
prolonged therapy protease inhibitor ritonavir (abt-538).
design: seven hiv-1-infected patients, one previously treated with
dideoxynucleoside analogues (zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine), treated
for 1 year ritonavir.
methods: direct solid-phase sequencing protease gene starting plasma 
derived viral rna followed comparison phenotypic drug resistance data.
results: frequent amino-acid substitutions occurring upon administration
of protease inhibitor v82a/f (substrate binding site), i54v (flap
region), a71v l10i. additional mutations found one patient 
i15v, m36i, i84v i93l. mutation l63p found pre- and
post-ritonavir samples. phenotypic drug resistance assays confirmed resistance to
ritonavir post-treatment samples (approximately 170-fold) showed
cross-resistance indinavir (approximately 30-fold) partially saquinavir
(approximately fivefold). 1 year treatment, one patient without known
resistance-associated mutations protease gene still showed substantial
rise cd4 cell count accompanied 2.4 log decrease rna viral
load. however, week 78, mutations r8q, e34k, r57k, l63p i84v detected
and treatment benefit partially lost.
conclusions: long-term treatment ritonavir associated emergence 
of multiple mutations hiv-1 protease gene. mutations l10i, i54v, l63p,
a71v, v82a/f i84v correspond known drug-resistance mutations ritonavir
and protease inhibitors. phenotypic resistance ritonavir detected in
a majority ritonavir-treated patients 1 year treatment. addition,
long-term ritonavir treatment selects cross-resistance protease
inhibitors indinavir saquinavir. argues sequential therapy 
several protease inhibitors. delayed resistance one patient accompanied
with prolonged increase cd4 cell count decrease viral load suggesting
a temporary benefit treatment.
