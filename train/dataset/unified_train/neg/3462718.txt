rna polymerase specificity mrna production enhancer action.

lopata ma, cleveland dw, sollner-webb b.

to examine rna polymerase (ec 2.7.7.6) specificity rna
maturation/utilization transcriptional enhancement, constructed chimeric
plasmid (ppoli-cat) promoter mouse rrna gene transcription was
placed adjacent coding sequences chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat; 
ec 2.3.1.28). number constructs, including plasmids also containing 
murine sarcoma virus enhancer lacking natural eukaryotic promoter
sequences, also prepared. apparent agreement earlier conclusions
that rna polymerase transcript act messenger rna, transient
transfection mouse l cells ppoli-cat yielded high levels of
transcription rna polymerase promoter enzymatically active cat
protein. however, examination revealed cat protein translated
from rna begins normal rrna transcription initiation site. polysomal 
rna devoid rna instead consists cat-encoding transcripts that
begin elsewhere mouse ribosomal dna (rdna) region. since transcription 
these aberrant rnas stimulated addition murine sarcoma virus
enhancer segment, probably transcribed rna polymerase ii. transcripts
that map authentic rrna start site similarly enhanced. moreover,
unlike rnas deriving rrna initiation site, aberrant rnas are
more stable level translatable cat transcripts suppressed by
inclusion larger segments rdna promoter regions. fortuitously initiated
mrnas also formed absence natural eukaryotic promoter sequence.
from data conclude evidence normal rna polymerase 
i transcription yields functional mrna transcriptional enhancement
appears rna polymerase specific.
