a growing number chronic liver disease patients, especially with
metabolic syndrome-associated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease hepatitis c
virus-associated dysmetabolic syndrome, take statins prevent
cardiovascular disease. result, clinicians weigh complex issues raised 
by interaction statins liver metabolism disorders. this
article, critically review data concerning statins liver pathophysiology
with emphasis nonalcoholic fatty liver disease hepatitis c virus, while
also touching chronic liver diseases. basic research interests include
statins' mechanism action effects cholesterol-related cell
signaling pathways angiogenesis. clinical standpoint, many chronic
liver diseases increase cardiovascular risk would undeniably benefit from
sustained statin use. false alarms security accompanying aminotransferase
monitoring, however, disturbing light scarcity data statins' 
long-term effects liver histology. although actions statins might
eventually prove particularly useful nonalcoholic steatohepatitis,
hepatitis c virus, hepatocellular carcinoma, others may prove harmful. the
lack definitive data makes fully informed decision impossible. research
using histological endpoints urgently needed determine indications 
contraindications extraordinary class agents patients chronic 
liver disease.
