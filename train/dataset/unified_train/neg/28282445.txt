the cellular molecular mechanisms underpinning unusually high virulence
of highly pathogenic avian influenza h5n1 viruses mammalian species remains
unknown. here, investigated cell tropism h5n1 virus determinant
of enhanced virulence mammalian species. engineered h5n1 viruses with
restricted cell tropism exploitation cell type-specific microrna
expression incorporating microrna target sites viral genome.
restriction h5n1 replication endothelial cells via mir-126 ameliorated
disease symptoms, prevented systemic viral spread limited mortality, despite 
showing similar levels peak viral replication lungs compared to
control virus-infected mice. similarly, restriction h5n1 replication in
endothelial cells resulted ameliorated disease symptoms decreased viral
spread ferrets. studies demonstrate h5n1 infection endothelial
cells results excessive production cytokines reduces endothelial
barrier integrity lungs, culminates vascular leakage viral
pneumonia. importantly, studies suggest need combinational therapy
that targets viral components, suppresses host immune responses, improves
endothelial barrier integrity treatment highly pathogenic h5n1 virus
infections.
