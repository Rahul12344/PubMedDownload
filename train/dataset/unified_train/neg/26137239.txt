measles rubella virus usually considered causative agents in
patients febrile rash illness (fri). however, investigators identified 
that enteroviruses also associated fri, present study was
undertaken investigate association. study, 20 throat swab samples 
were collected patients suffering rash fever april july
in 2013. 20 samples tested negative measles virus, positive 
when reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction performed using
enterovirus universal primers. specifically, five tested positive coxsackie
b3 virus (cvb3). titers five cvb3 isolates 106.5, 106.4, 107.5,
106.5 106.5 tissue culture infectious dose50/100 Âµl respectively. partial
vp1 sequences five cvb3 isolates identical were
closely associated cvb3/mkp cvb3/macocy strains, known 
induce myocarditis neonatal diseases central nervous system. in
conclusion, cvb3 may cause symptoms fever rash be
differentiated measles, rubella infectious pathogens. five
cvb3 isolates described study genetically similar and
to local cvb3 strains. results provide data viral
pathogen spectrum associated fri.
