background: hepatitis c virus (hcv) lower prevalence children and
knowledge limited regarding natural outcome hcv infection children.
aim: study risk factors hcv acquisition predictors persistence
in egyptian children.
methods: children, 1-9 years age, evaluated acquisition hcv
(anti-hcv positive regardless viraemia) persistence hcv (anti-hcv and
hcv-rna positive) two paediatric hepatology clinics cairo enrollment and
at 3 monthly intervals. spontaneous clearance hcv defined ≥ two
positive anti-hcv antibody tests negative hcv-rna least 6 months apart.
results: 33-month-period total 226 children <9 years age were
screened hcv antibodies. those, 146 (65%) anti-hcv positive 
87 (60%) hcv-rna positive. hcv acquisition likely occur in
older children (p = 0.003) comorbid conditions (p < 0.01) compared to
anti-hcv negative children. multivariate logistic regression analysis, the
highest risk factors hcv acquisition surgical interventions [odds ratio 
(or): 4.7] blood transfusions (or: 2.3). highest risk factor hcv
persistence dental treatment (or: 16.9) male gender (or: 7.5). hcv
persistence also strongly associated elevated baseline alanine
aminotransaminase (alt) levels (or: 4.9) fluctuating aspartate
aminotransferase (ast) levels (or: 8.1).
conclusion: although surgical interventions blood transfusion significant
risk factors hcv acquisition egyptian children, dental treatment remains
the highest risk factor hcv chronic persistence children.
