the review recent studies using dna microarrays shed new light herpes
simplex virus (hsv) replicative cycle, response immature dendritic cells
(dcs) pathogens response neurons trigeminal ganglia virus
reactivation. studies provided better understanding molecular
biology hsv infection, latency reactivation. research the
sensory trigeminal neurons neuronal axons (type c fibers) transverse
the skin basal membrane, enter skin epidermis interact cell
membrane skin resident immature dcs provided insight connection 
between nervous system host immune system. based studies a
hypothesis presented suggesting hsv evolved use human host defense
systems (pain signals, immune system cells sensory neurons) ensure its
entry skin epithelium sensory neurons. reactivated hsv the
neurons utilizes host defense systems return skin epithelium.
