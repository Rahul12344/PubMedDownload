the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-utrs) three rnas alfalfa mosaic virus
(amv) contain specific binding site coat protein (cp) act promoter
for minus-strand rna synthesis purified amv rna-dependent rna polymerase
(rdrp) vitro assay. binding cp viral rnas required to
initiate infection. sequence 3'-terminal 39 nucleotides amv rna 3
can folded two stem-loop structures flanked three single-stranded augc
sequences represents cp binding site. mutations sequence are
known interfere cp binding vitro introduced infectious
clone rna 3, mutant rna transcripts used templates vitro
rdrp assay infect protoplasts plants. mutation augc motif 2 or
disruption stem 3'-proximal hairpin 1 interfered cp binding in
vitro minus-strand promoter activity vitro replication rna 
3 vivo. however, hairpin 1 appeared essential encapsidation rna
3. reversion three g-c base pairs hairpin 1 effect cp binding but
interfered minus-strand promoter activity vitro rna 3
replication vivo. concluded viral rdrp cp recognize
different elements 3'-utrs amv rnas. moreover, several mutations that
interfered cp binding vitro interfered accumulation vivo of
rna 4, subgenomic messenger cp, accumulation rna 3.
