persistent infection japanese encephalitis virus (jev) established in
murine neuroblastoma n18 cells, persistency maintained cell
culture 6 months. persistently infected cells, clone named
c2-2 selected expanded form stable cell line. vast majority of
c2-2 cells showed viral protein staining immunofluorescence continuously
produced low levels virus (10(3) 10(4) pfu/ml) without marked cytopathic
effects cyclic variations. addition wild-type viral proteins,
truncated forms viral nonstructural protein 1 (ns1) well its
derivative ns1' produced c2-2 cells. truncated ns1 ns1' contain 
deletions n-termini; however, analyses rt-pcr direct
sequencing viral rna failed detect truncations mutations within 
the ns1 region, suggesting ns1 truncation result unique
posttranslational proteolytic cleavage ns1 persistently infected cells.
similar identical truncation ns1 also observed two other
persistently infected cell lines established vero dbt (murine astrocytoma)
cells. however, viruses released c2-2 cells produce truncated ns1
upon infection n18 cells, suggesting ns1 truncations result of
virus-cell interaction persistently infected cells. data indicate a
strong association abnormal ns1 expression jev persistency. a
probable involvement dysfunctional ns1 establishment and/or maintenance
of jev persistency tissue culture discussed.
