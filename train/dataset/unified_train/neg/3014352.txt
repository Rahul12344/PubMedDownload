the recent report koprowski et al. human t-cell lymphotropic retroviruses
(htlvs) may involved development multiple sclerosis (ms) aroused
much interest. report based largely immunological evidence, using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisas) viral antigens disrupted
virions. accordingly sought confirmation screening sera and
cerebrospinal fluid (csf) samples ms patients cell lines infected
respectively adult t-cell leukaemia (atl) virus (atlv/htlv-i) japanese
cells (mt-1 mt-2 lines), isolate british black patients with
atl, mot cell line produce htlv-ii, t-cell line containing 
a local isolate acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids) virus
(c-lav/htlv-iii). failed find antibodies retroviruses in
the sera csf. furthermore, neither virus could isolated peripheral
