regulation antibody production antigen-specific ebv-transformed
b-lymphoblastoid cell line: effect high-dose antigen antigen-pulsed t
cells.

a b-cell line (c1b2) secreting monoclonal igg antibody influenza virus
haemagglutinin (ha3) obtained epstein-barr virus (ebv) transformation of
human tonsillar b cells activated vitro influenza a/x31. antibody secretion
by c1b2 completely inhibited purified ha3 concentrations 100
ng/ml. contrast, high doses ha3 effect ebv-transformed b-cell
lines making antibody unrelated specificity. inhibition specific antibody
secretion ha3 continued least 3 days removal soluble
antigen, could partially reversed treatment pronase,
suggesting inhibition due 'effector cell' blockade binding of
antigen surface ig receptors. cells pulsed high doses antigen also
suppressed antibody secretion c1b2, effect probably due a
tolerogenic signal delivered b cell ha3 complexed t-cell
membrane rather suppression antigen-induced ts, carryover free
antigen. experiments demonstrate two independent mechanisms high-dose
tolerance vitro, show monoclonal b-lymphoblastoid lines known
specificity used study regulation specific antibody production at
the level b cell.
