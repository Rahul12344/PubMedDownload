there detailed studies viral kinetics liver
transplantation (lt), conflicting data reported viral loads 
the severity recurrent hepatitis c virus (hcv) disease. long-term study
aimed examine (1) impact hcv rna levels specific points time
within first year (2) influence interleukin-28b (il-28b) genotypes
on patient outcomes severity recurrent hcv disease. viral loads
were measured 2, 4, 12, 24, 48 weeks lt, recipient/donor il-28b
genotypes 164 patients determined. cox regression analysis showed 
the viral load week 2 independent negative predictor recipient
outcomes. week 2 viral load ≥ 6.0 log(10) iu/ml significantly associated
with reduced patient survival. mean follow-up 6.5 years, 21 164
patients (12.8%) developed cholestatic type hcv recurrence and/or rapidly
progressed cirrhosis within 1 year. multivariate binary regression analysis 
showed hcv viremia week 2 non-c/c recipient il-28b genotype were
independent risk factors cholestatic recurrent hcv. predictive factors
could found occurrence recurrent liver cirrhosis 5 10 years
after lt. study shows hcv rna level week 2 recipient
il-28b genotype independent, statistically significant risk factors for
post-lt cholestatic hcv, emphasizes importance viral load
monitoring il-28b genotyping identifying hcv recipients risk for
severe hcv recurrence.
