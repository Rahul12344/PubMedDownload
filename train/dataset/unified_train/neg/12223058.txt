sexual transmission hiv requires virus crosses mucosal barriers and
disseminates lymphoid tissue, major site viral replication. to
achieve this, hiv might engage dc-sign, calcium dependent lectin is
expressed mucosal dendritic cells (dcs), binds avidly hiv. dc-sign
and attachment factors likely account well-known ability 
dcs enhance infection cells hiv. attachment hiv dc-sign might
thus enhance viral spread mucosal tissues and, taking advantage the
inherent capacity dcs migrate lymphoid tissue, might promote viral
dissemination within host. dc-sign related molecule, termed dc-signr,
also enhance infection ebola virus. expression lectins early
targets ebola virus infection, like liver endothelial cells alveolar
macrophages, suggests important role dc-sign dc-signr the
establishment ebola infection. article reviews interaction dc-sign
and dc-signr hiv ebola, discusses mechanism dc-sign-mediated
viral transmission examines process could inhibited potential 
therapeutics.
