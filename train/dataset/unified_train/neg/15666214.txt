changes subcellular distribution quantification glutathione were
studied electron microscopic immunogold cytochemistry zucchini yellow
mosaic virus (zymv)-infected styrian pumpkin plants (cucurbita pepo l. ssp. pepo 
var. styriaca greb.) two weeks inoculation. amount gold particles
bound glutathione statistically evaluated different cell structures,
including mitochondria, plastids, nuclei, peroxisomes, cytosol. general,
zymv-infected plants showed higher gold labelling density intact mesophyll
cells 5th (older leaves) youngest fully developed leaves (younger 
leaves), decreased levels glutathione within root tip cells compared 
to control. general, within older younger leaves highest amount of
gold particles found mitochondria lowest amount plastids. in
zymv-infected older leaves, increase glutathione found peroxisomes
(1.7-fold), cytosol (1.6-fold), mitochondria (1.4-fold), nuclei
(1.2-fold), whereas glutathione levels plastids differ significantly
when compared control cells. zymv-infected younger leaves elevated
glutathione contents found cytosol (3-fold), nuclei (2.1-fold),
peroxisomes (1.8-fold), plastids (1.5-fold), whereas mitochondria showed an
insignificant decrease glutathione levels comparison control. in
root tip cells zymv-infected plants amount gold particles bound to
glutathione decreased investigated cell structures 0.7- 
0.8-fold. additionally, total glutathione contents determined older and
younger leaves using high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc), which
revealed significant differences control zymv-infected leaves. the
relevance results methods compared discussed.
