aims: understanding origin high thermostability exhibited the
alpha-amylase produced natural strain bacillus licheniformis.
methods results: msh320 alpha-amylase gene cloned native 
strain b. licheniformis isolated flour mill wastewaters kashan,
central iran, nucleotide sequence determined (genbank accession
number af438149). whereas previously cloned b. licheniformisalpha-amylase (bla)
genes nearly identical, msh320 gene coding sequence presents 93%
identity reference 'wild-type' bla gene, nucleotide changes 
leading silent mutations. amino acid substitutions occurred 19 483
residues matured protein, distributed along protein sequence.
nevertheless, natural bla variant presents thermoinactivation kinetics
similar reference bla. protein modelling structural
predictions substitution sites suggest half mutations may have
a significant stabilizing destabilizing effect protein structure.
compensatory mutations thus occurred natural variant order maintain 
thermostability level reference enzyme.
conclusions: exceptional high thermostability bla, although produced 
nonthermophilic organism, fortuitous subject selective pressure
still work natural environments.
significance impact study: bla thermal performances naturally 
maximized substantially improved protein engineering.
