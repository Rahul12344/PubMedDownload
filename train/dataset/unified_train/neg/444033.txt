further investigations possible correlation agglutinability and
osteoinductive properties established cell lines.

w≈Çodarski k, ostrowski k.

various cell lines, including sv40 virus-transformed human mouse fibroblasts,
established fibroblastic epithelial cell lines, well hybrids were
tested osteoinductive properties versus presence concanavalin receptors.
no correlation found presence receptors and
osteoinductive properties cells. far, however, osteoinductive cell line 
was found without concanavalin receptors. thus, significance surface
properties cells transmission osteoinductive signal(s) remains open
question. none fibroblastic lines exhibits osteoinductive potential, in
contrast ht-40 wish epithelial lines.
