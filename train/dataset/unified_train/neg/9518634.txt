temperature dependence spin-lattice relaxation time proton the
rotating frame (t1rho(h)) examined membranes intact pm2 phage,
its host bacterial cells, phospholipids extracted cells. the

in fast-motional regime (tauc < 1.7 x 10(-6) s) temperature range from

biomembranes suppressed extracted phospholipid
bilayers, suggesting lipid-protein interactions induce slow motions of
the phospholipids membrane. especially, membrane intact pm2
phage showed cooperative change motional state, consistent with
the reported change phosphorus chemical shift anisotropies dna and
