bovine viral diarrhea virus (bvdv) infection altered leukocyte populations in
calves reflected depression t, bocd4+, bocd8+ lymphocytes 
the thymus depression b lymphocytes peyer's patches (pp). present
study based mononuclear leukocyte preparations eighteen 9- to
12-month-old crossbred calves exposed either bovine respiratory
syncytial virus (brsv), bvdv, brsv bvdv concurrently, served as
mock-infected controls. peripheral blood leukocytes collected on
postinfection days (pid) 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, cell populations thymus,
spleen, mesenteric lymph node, pp collected necropsy pid 9. the
leukocytes analyzed using flow cytometry lymphocyte subpopulations
expressing antigens specific bocd2, bocd4, bocd8, bowc1, lambda light chain
of bovine immunoglobulin, bocd11b major histocompatibility complex (mhc)
class ii. concurrent brsv bvdv infections caused exaggerated alterations in
leukocyte populations greater percentage t-lymphocytes harvested from
the pp. alterations leukocyte populations lymphatic tissues in
peripheral circulation due bvdv infection may important mechanism for
causation clinically severe diseases respiratory digestive tracts
during concurrent brsv bvdv infections.
