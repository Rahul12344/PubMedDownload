human noroviruses leading cause gastroenteritis worldwide, yet are
no licensed antivirals. urgent need norovirus therapeutics,
particularly chronic infections immunocompromised individuals, also 
potential need prophylactic use epidemics. continued research led to
the identification compounds inhibit norovirus replication vitro and, 
at least cases, also effective vivo murine norovirus.
progress included classical approaches targeting viral proteins and
harnessing antiviral action interferon, strategies targeting essential
host cell factors, novel strategies exploiting high mutation rate of
noroviruses.
