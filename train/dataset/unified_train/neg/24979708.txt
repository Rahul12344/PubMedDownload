we recently constructed novel non-replicating dominant-negative hsv-2
recombinant viral vaccine (cj2-gd2) capable expressing various hsv-2 antigens 
that dominant targets hsv-2-specific cd8 t-cell response. importantly,
cj2-gd2 expresses gd2, hsv-2 major antigen glycoprotein d, efficiently 
wild-type hsv-2 infection lead nearly 500-fold reduction in
wild-type hsv-2 viral replication cells co-infected cj2-gd2 wild-type
hsv-2. report, show cj2-gd2 elicits strong antibody response to
various hsv-2 antigens highly effective prevention primary and
recurrent hsv-2 genital infection disease immunized guinea pigs. the
direct comparison study cj2-gd2 gd2 subunit vaccine (gd2-alum/mpl) 
with formulation akin vaccine tested phase iii clinical trials shows
that cj2-gd2 8 times effective gd2-alum/mpl subunit vaccine in
eliciting anti-hsv-2 specific neutralizing antibody response offers
significantly superior protection primary recurrent hsv-2 genital
infections. importantly, challenge wild-type hsv-2 viral dna detectable in
dorsal root ganglia dna isolated cj2-gd2-immunized guinea pigs day 60
post-challenge. cj2-gd2 excellent hsv-2 vaccine candidate for
protection hsv-2 genital infection disease humans.
