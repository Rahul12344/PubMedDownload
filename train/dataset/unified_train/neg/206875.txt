cleavage epstein-barr virus dna restriction endonucleases ecori, hindiii
and bami.

rymo l, forsblom s.

the cleavage dnas b95-8 p3hr-1 virus strains epstein-barr
virus restriction endonucleases ecori, hindiii bami investigated
using new technique quantitative evaluation fluorescence ethidium
stained dna fragments separated agarose gels. results obtained b95-8 
dna showed addition limited repetitions nucleotide sequences
observed ecori hindiii cleavage patterns, molecule contained a
bami fragment molecular mass 2.0 megadaltons present a
total 11 copies localized limited part dna molecule. the
same sequences also present p3hr-1 dna albeit lower molar ratio.
p3hr-1 dna yielded restriction enzyme cleavage patterns suggesting dna sequence
heterogeneity p3hr-1 virus. fragment present 4
copies per molecule p3hr-1 dna. comparison restriction enzyme cleavage 
patterns p3hr-1 b95-8 dna revealed high degree structural homology
emphasized nucleic acid hybridization experiments ebv complementary rna
synthesized vitro.
