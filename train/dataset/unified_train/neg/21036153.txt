although hiv-1 replication controlled highly active anti-retroviral
therapy (haart) using protease reverse transcriptase inhibitors, the
development multidrug-resistant viruses compromises efficacy haart.
thus, necessary develop new drugs novel targets. identify new
anti-hiv-1 compounds, recombinant vpr purified transfected cos-7 cells
and used screen compounds chemical array identify bound vpr. 
from screen, 108 compounds selected positive vpr binding. among 
these, one structurally similar group four compounds showed anti-hiv activity 
in macrophages. particular, compound sip-1 high inhibition activity and
reduced levels p24 98% macrophages 8 12 days of
infection. sip-1 cytotoxic effects disrupt cell cycle
progression induce apoptosis molt-4 hela cell lines measured mtt 
assay, flow-cytometry analysis, caspase-3 assay. addition, sip-1
specifically bound vpr assessed photo-cross-linked small-molecule
affinity beads. results suggest vpr good target the
development compounds could potentially inhibit hiv-1 replication.
collectively, results strongly suggest chemical array useful method
for screening anti-viral compounds.
