a rotavirus strain hmg89 nigeria short electrophoretic pattern was
typed g3 pcr. cdna clone pcr product hybridised northern
blots rna segment 9 homologous nigerian rotavirus strain hmg89 and
laboratory reference strain 69m mammalian group rotaviruses
was sequenced. vp7 gene 9 sequence 1060 nucleotides long two base
deletions positions 1034-1035. sequence analysis primer (aat8) used 
the previous pcr serotyping assay revealed mutation one three
nucleotide bases 3' end primer binding site accounting our
inability serotype g8 strains samples. findings demonstrate 
pcr analysis can, albeit infrequently, lead error typing rotaviruses due
to small numbers mutations primer binding region.
