in study, used amplified isoform sequencing technique pacific
biosciences characterize poly(a)+ fraction lytic transcriptome of
the herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1). analysis detected 34 formerly
unidentified protein-coding genes, 10 non-coding rnas, well 17
polycistronic complex transcripts. work also led us identify many
transcript isoforms, including 13 splice 68 transcript end variants, well 
as several transcript overlaps. additionally, determined previously
unascertained transcriptional start polyadenylation sites. analyzed the
transcriptional activity complementary dna strand five convergent hsv
gene pairs quantitative rt-pcr detected antisense rnas gene.
this part study revealed inverse correlation expressions of
convergent partners. work adds new insights understanding complexity 
of pervasive transcriptional overlaps suggesting crosstalk
between adjacent distal genes interaction transcription
apparatuses. also identified transcripts overlapping hsv replication
origins, may indicate interplay transcription and
replication machineries. relative abundance hsv-1 transcripts also
been established using novel method based calculation sequencing
reads analysis.
