update of
    cochrane database syst rev. 2009;(3):cd006419.

background: helminth infections, soil-transmitted helminths,
schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, prevalent many 
countries human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection also common.
there evidence observational studies hiv helminth
co-infection may associated higher viral load lower cd4+ cell counts.
treatment helminth infections antihelminthics (deworming drugs) may 
benefits people living hiv beyond simply clearance worm
infections.this update cochrane review published 2009 have
expanded include outcomes anaemia adverse events.
objectives: evaluate effects deworming drugs (antihelminthic therapy)
on markers hiv disease progression, anaemia, adverse events children
and adults.
search methods: review update, searched online published and
unpublished studies cochrane library, medline, embase, central, world 
health organization (who) international clinical trials registry platform
(icrtp), clinicaltrials.gov, global health library 29 september
2015. also searched databases listing conference abstracts, scanned reference 
lists articles, contacted authors included studies.
selection criteria: searched randomized controlled trials (rcts) that
compared antihelminthic drugs placebo intervention hiv-positive
people.
data collection analysis: two review authors independently extracted data and
assessed trials eligibility risk bias. primary outcomes were
changes hiv viral load cd4+ cell count, secondary outcomes were
anaemia, iron deficiency, adverse events, mortality events. compared the
effects deworming using mean differences, risk ratios (rr), 95% confidence
intervals (cis). assessed quality evidence using grading of
recommendations assessment, development evaluation (grade) approach.
main results: eight trials met inclusion criteria review, enrolling a
total 1612 participants. three trials evaluated effect providing
antihelminthics adults hiv without knowledge helminth
infection status, five trials evaluated effects providing deworming
drugs hiv-positive individuals confirmed helminth infections. seven
trials conducted sub-saharan africa one thailand. antihelminthics 
for people unknown helminth infection statusproviding antihelminthics
(albendazole praziquantel together separately) hiv-positive adults with
unknown helminth infection status may small suppressive effect mean
viral load six weeks 95% ci includes possibility effect
(difference mean change -0.14 log10 viral rna/ml, 95% ci -0.35 0.07, p =
0.19; one trial, 166 participants, low quality evidence).repeated dosing with
deworming drugs two years (albendazole every three months plus annual
praziquantel), probably little effect mean viral load (difference in
mean change 0.01 log10 viral rna, 95% ci: -0.03 -0.05; one trial, 917
participants, moderate quality evidence), little effect mean cd4+
count (difference mean change 2.60 cd4+ cells/µl, 95% ci -10.15 15.35; p = 
0.7; one trial, 917 participants, low quality evidence). antihelminthics for
people confirmed helminth infectionstreating confirmed helminth infections
in hiv-positive adults may small suppressive effect mean viral load 
six 12 weeks following deworming (difference mean change -0.13 log10 viral 
rna, 95% ci -0.26 -0.00; p = 0.04; four trials, 445 participants, low quality 
evidence). however, finding strongly influenced single study of
praziquantel treatment schistosomiasis. may also small favourable 
effect mean cd4+ cell count 12 weeks deworming hiv-positive
populations confirmed helminth infections (difference mean change 37.86
cd4+ cells/µl, 95% ci 7.36 68.35; p = 0.01; three trials, 358 participants,
low quality evidence). adverse events mortality indication that
antihelminthic drugs impart additional risks hiv-positive populations.
however, adverse events well reported (very low quality evidence) and
trials underpowered evaluate effects mortality (low quality evidence).
authors' conclusions: low quality evidence treating confirmed
helminth infections hiv-positive adults may small, short-term favourable 
effects markers hiv disease progression. studies required to
confirm finding. current evidence suggests deworming with
antihelminthics harmful, reassuring routine treatment 
of confirmed suspected helminth infections people living hiv in
co-endemic areas.further long-term studies required make confident
conclusions regarding impact presumptively deworming hiv-positive
individuals irrespective helminth infection status, long-term
trial date demonstrate effect.
