viral nervous necrosis (vnn) affects 120 species mostly belonging to
the order perciformes. however, none brackishwater species belonging to
the family cichlidae order perciformes reported susceptible. 
hence, present experiment undertaken study susceptibility the
brackishwater cichlid, pearlspot, etroplus suratensis nnv. thirty-day-old
pearlspot larvae infected nnv immersion. mortality recorded till
14 days post-infection, infected larvae subjected nested rt-pcr
and histology. virus isolated infected larvae using ssn-1 cells. 
study replication virus vitro, primary cultured brain cells of
e. suratensis iek cells infected nnv. mortality observed 
any control experimentally infected larvae. however, experimentally
infected larvae positive nnv nested rt-pcr virus isolated
using ssn-1 cells. further, infected pearlspot brain cells iek cells
showed cytopathic effect second third passage virus were
positive nnv nested rt-pcr. pearlspot relatively resistant vnn
although virus could replicate larvae cell culture.
