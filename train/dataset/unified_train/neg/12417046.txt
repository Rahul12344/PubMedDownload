to enhance efficacy suicide gene therapy prostate cancer under
androgen deprivation, designed promoter system consists the
prostate-specific membrane antigen (psma) promoter / enhancer (pepm) cre-loxp
dna recombination system. constructed two kinds plasmids. one plasmid
contains cre recombinase (cre) control pepm other
expresses cmv-lox-luciferase / herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk). in
psma-positive lncap cells, promoter activity pepm-cre plus
cmv-lox-luciferase demonstrated 800-fold greater activity compared of
the psma promoter alone. however, enhancement promoter activity was
observed psma-negative cells. furthermore, contrast prostate
specific antigen promoter / enhancer (pp), promoter activity pepm 
decrease lncap cells cultured charcoal-stripped fetal bovine
serum (cfbs). vitro gene therapy model lncap cells, cell growth
inhibition presence ganciclovir (gcv) evident cells
transfected pepm-cre plus cmv-lox-tk cells pp-tk,
and difference efficacy two plasmids remarkable 
the cells maintained cfbs medium. therapeutic effect pepm-cre plus
cmv-lox-tk also observed xenografted lncap cells nude mice the
plasmids directly injected tumors gcv administered
intraperitoneally. findings indicate combination psma
promoter / enhancer cre-loxp system enhance psma promoter
activity even androgen ablation conditions exert anti-tumor
effect vitro vivo.
