glycoalkaloids toxic compounds synthesized many solanum species. 
glycoalkaloid biosynthesis influenced plant genetic environmental
conditions. although many studies shown light important factor
affecting glycoalkaloid biosynthesis, specific mechanism currently
unknown. chlorophyll carotenoid biosynthesis depend light signal
transduction share intermediate metabolites glycoalkaloid
biosynthetic pathway. here, used virus-induced gene silencing silence genes
encoding phytoene desaturase (pds) magnesium chelatase (chli chlh) to
reduce chlorophyll carotenoid levels eggplant leaves. quantification of
carotenoid chlorophyll levels analyzed lc/pda/apci/ms semipolar
metabolite profiling lc/hesi/ms. notably, resulting lines showed decreases
in glycoalkaloid production. found expression genes
involved production glycoalkaloids metabolites were
suppressed silenced lines. results indicate photosynthetic
pigment accumulation affects steroidal glycoalkaloid biosynthesis eggplant
leaves. finding lays foundation reducing levels endogenous
antinutritional compounds crops.
