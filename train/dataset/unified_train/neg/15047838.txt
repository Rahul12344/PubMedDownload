human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) drug resistance results the
accumulation mutations viral genes targeted drugs. genetic
changes, however, commonly detected monitored techniques only
take account dominant population plasma virus. hiv-1-infected
patients harbor complex diverse mixture virus populations, the
mechanisms underlying emergence evolution resistance fully
elucidated. using techniques allow quantification resistance
mutations minority virus species, monitored evolution of
resistance plasma virus populations patients failing protease inhibitor
treatment. minority populations distinct resistance genotypes detected 
in patients throughout evolution resistance. emergence new
dominant genotypes followed two possible mechanisms: (i) emergence new
mutation currently dominant genotype (ii) emergence new genotype
derived minority virus species. cases, population changes
were associated increase resistance expense reduction in
replication capacity. findings provide preliminary indication minority
viral species, evolve independently majority virus population, can
eventually become dominant populations, thereby serving reservoir of
diversity possibly accelerating development drug resistance.
