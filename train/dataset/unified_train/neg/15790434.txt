objective: correlate high-risk human papillomavirus (hr-hpv) viral load to
p16(ink4a) expression atypical squamous cells undetermined significance
(ascus)-categorized pap smears follow-up biopsies order elucidate
their relationships gynecological pathology.
methods: studied 66 ascus-categorized pap smears subsequent follow-up
biopsies. hr-hpv viral load determined hybrid capture ii assay the
cervical swab ascus-diagnosed pap smear. smears biopsies were
immunostained primary anti-p16 antibody, clone e6h4, analyzed the
correlations hr-hpv viral load ascus-diagnosed pap smear p16 
expression smears follow-up biopsies.
results: correlation analyses corresponding histological diagnoses 66
ascus-diagnosed pap smears revealed 21 (32%) cases reactive changes
and 45 cases showed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia including lsil (24 cases, 
36%) hsil higher (21 cases, 32%). tests hr-hpv viral load revealed 17 
(26%) negative cases 49 (74%) positive cases. immunostaining showed 26
cases (39%) negative 40 (61%) positive p16 expression.
comparative analysis two tests indicated consistencies well as
discrepancies. showed significant differences (p < 0.001) negative
p16 expressions pap smears presence reactive lesions follow-up 
biopsies hr-hpv viral load. however, significant difference (p = 0.739 and
0.606) p16 expression pap smears presence lsil, hsil or
higher follow-up biopsies high hr-hpv viral load found. addition,
there significant differences (p < 0.001) specificity positive
predictive value, significant differences found sensitivity (p =
0.606) negative predictive value (p = 0.062) p16 immunostaining and
hr-hpv viral load.
conclusion: results indicate close association weak
or strong p16 expressions ascus-categorized smears presence sils
in follow-up biopsies positive hr-hpv viral loads. conversely, also 
a clear association lack p16 expression absence of
significant lesions follow-up biopsies, consistent a
negative hr-hpv viral load. concluded p16 expression indicator
of pathogenic activity hr-hpv, objective biomarker for
clarification ascus-categorized pap smears gynecological cytopathology.
furthermore, comparative analysis, directly visualized p16 immunostaining
on smears appears effective method hr-hpv viral load the
detection reactive changes lsils ascus-categorized pap smears.
