setting: urban clinic, nairobi.
objectives: evaluate impact specimen quality different
smear-positive tuberculosis (tb) case (spc) definitions spc detection sex.
design: prospective study among tb suspects.
results: total 695 patients recruited: 644 produced > =1 specimen
for microscopy. male/female sex ratio 0.8. significant
differences numbers men women submitting three specimens (274/314 vs.
339/380, p = 0.43). significantly men women produced set three
'good' quality specimens (175/274 vs. 182/339, p = 0.01). lowering thresholds for
definitions include scanty smears resulted increases spc detection in
both sexes; increase significantly higher women. revised world
health organization (who) case definition associated highest
detection rates women. analysis restricted patients
submitting 'good' quality specimen sets, difference detection between
sexes threshold significance (p = 0.05).
conclusions: higher spc notification rates men commonly reported tb
control programmes. revised spc definition may reduce sex disparities 
notification. considered evaluating interventions aimed
at reducing these. study required effects human
immuno-deficiency virus instructed specimen collection sex-specific impact
of new spc definition.
