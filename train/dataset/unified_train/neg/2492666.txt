primary murine trophoblast giant cells (tgc) express detectable major
histocompatibility complex (mhc) antigens refractory the
mhc-increasing effects alpha beta (virus-induced) interferons gamma
(immune type) interferon early implantation (postcoital days 3.5-6). west 
nile virus infection primary tgc monolayers postcoital-day-3.5
preimplantation blastocysts induced paternal mhc antigen expression within 16 hr,
as detected immunogold labeling electron microscopy. induction unlikely
to mediated secreted virus-induced interferons factors, 
it occurred presence high concentrations anti-alpha/beta interferon 
antibodies induced virus-inactivated supernatants mhc-induced
primary tgc cultures. attempts induce mhc antigen expression poly(i.c) or
recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha primary tgc cultures also failed.
thus, apparent inhibition mhc antigen expression primary tgc during
early implantation refractoriness induction de novo mhc antigen
expression absolute. may represent maternal-and/or
species-protective evolutionary device. such, manipulation phenomenon 
may allow conclusive assessment significance inhibition mhc
antigen expression trophoblast cells implanting semiallogeneic embryo.
