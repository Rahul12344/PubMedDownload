characterization numerous independently derived cell lines necessary in
order establish reliable biological criteria applicable transformed mammary
epithelial cells. mammary tumor cell line (dmba-2/balb) clonal derivatives 
have established adenocarcinoma induced vivo balb/c mouse by
the administration chemical, 7,12-dimethylbenz(alpha)anthracene. the
parental clonal lines vitro, well tumors derived vivo, 
maintained epithelial morphology light microscope level. electron
microscopic observations demonstrated presence desmosomes numerous
microtubules microfilaments, low levels rough endoplasmic reticulum
and golgi apparatus. growth characteristics examined, including saturation
density levels colony-forming ability plastic suspension. none of
the vitro growth parameters found correlate tumorigenicity 
the lines syngeneic mice ability produce c- b-type virions
by reverse transcriptase assay. peroxidase/antiperoxidase (pap) immunological
staining failed detect virus-specified antigens, mumtv gp52, rauscher mulv
gp69/71, balb virus-2 gp70, cells. although epithelial appearance,
the parental cell line appear functionally differentiated in
culture evidenced low level casein messenger rna. passage 
parental cell line vivo lactating mouse failed activate virus
expression, cells scattered focal areas tumor synthesize 
casein detectable pap staining.
