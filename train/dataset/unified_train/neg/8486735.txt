we investigated mechanism cell fusion mediated ha, fusogenic
hemagglutinin influenza viral envelope. single erythrocytes (rbcs) were
attached fibroblasts expressing ha cell surface, fusion of
the paired cells triggered rapid acidification. rbc membrane was
stained fluorescent lipid, fusion-induced escape lipid the
fibroblast observed quantitative image analysis. time, the
formation aqueous connection (i.e., fusion pore) two cells 
was monitored electrically. within minutes acidification, electrical
conductance two cells appeared abruptly fusion pore opened,
and increased gradually pore dilated. later, fluorescent lipid
diffused fibroblast, approaching equilibrium next 5-20 min. 
lipid flux seen pore conductance remained 0.5 ns less. evidently
lipid flux requires threshold pore size. finding suggests smallest
and earliest fusion pores surrounded ring protein. fusion pore
expands breaking ring recruiting lipid circumference.
