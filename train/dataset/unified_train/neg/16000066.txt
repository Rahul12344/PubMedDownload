it demonstrated interleukin 24 (il-24, also called melanoma
differentiation associated gene 7) exerts antitumor activity. study, we
investigated whether oncolytic adenovirus-mediated gene transfer il-24 could
induce strong antitumor activity. tumor-selective replicating adenovirus
expressing il-24 (zd55-il-24) constructed insertion il-24 expression
cassette zd55 vector, based deletion adenoviral e1b
55-kda gene. zd55-il-24 could express substantially il-24 ad-il-24
because replication vector. shown zd55-il-24 exerted a
strong cytopathic effect significant apoptosis tumor cells p53
dysfunction. moreover, cytotoxic apoptotic effects could seen normal
cells infected zd55-il-24. expression il-24 interfere viral 
replication induced oncolytic adenovirus. activation caspase 3 caspase 
9, induction bax gene expression, involved tumor cell apoptosis
induced zd55-il-24. treatment established tumors zd55-il-24 showed
much stronger antitumor activity induced onyx-015 ad-il- 24.
these data indicated oncolytic adenovirus expressing il-24 could exert
potential antitumor activity offer novel approach cancer therapy.
