background: variety techniques described introduce scarless,
site-specific chromosomal mutations. techniques applied make
point mutations gene deletions well insert heterologous dna into
bacterial vectors vaccine development. methods use multi-step approach
that requires cloning and/or designing repeat sequences facilitate homologous 
recombination. modified previously published techniques develop a
simple, efficient pcr-based method scarless insertion dna salmonella 
enteritidis chromosome.
results: final product mutation strategy insertion dna
encoding foreign epitope s. enteritidis genome without addition of
any unwanted sequence. experiment performed two-step mutation
process via pcr fragments, red recombinase counter-selection i-scei 
enzyme site. first, i-scei site kanamycin resistance gene introduced
into genome cells expressing red recombinase enzymes. next, sequence 
was replaced chosen insertion sequence. dna fragments used recombination
were linear pcr products consisted foreign insertion sequence
flanked homologous sequences target gene. described herein the
insertion section m2e epitope (lm2) influenza virus, domain of
cd154 (cd154s) combination outer membrane protein lamb of
s. enteritidis.
conclusion: successfully used method produce multiple mutants
with antibiotic gene genome extra sequence except nucleotides 
required expression epitope regions. method advantageous over
other protocols require cloning creating extra duplicate
regions facilitate homologous recombination, contains universal construct in
which epitope choice placed check cell surface expression,
and shows high efficiency screening positive mutants. other
opportunities mutational strategy include creating attenuated mutants and
site-specific, chromosomal deletion mutations. furthermore, method be
applicable gram-negative bacterial species red recombinase enzymes
can functionally expressed.
