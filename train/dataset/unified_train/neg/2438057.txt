tilorone aza-analogues, derivatives 4,7-phenanthroline 1,8-diazafluorene, 
were examined dna-complexing agents spectral electrophoretic methods.
the binding process includes least two types interactions: electrostatic
and, possibly, intercalation. complex formation denatured dna also
observed, nature remained unsolved. binding thermodynamic parameters 
were determined. ligands studied showed weak antiviral activity and
essentially interferon induction assayed vitro vivo. was
concluded interferon induction tilorone may involve specific cell
receptors intermediaries.
