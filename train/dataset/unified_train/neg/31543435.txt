we report aids patient high hiv rna copy number plasma was
successfully treated prolonged mycobacterium avium bacteremia other
complications. hiv-infected patient high fever, anemia, high alkaline
phosphatase, cystic lung lesions, hepatitis b virus infection kaposi's
sarcoma referred hospital. pcr blood revealed mycobacterium
avium bacteremia time blood culture positivity 8 days. hiv-1
rna copy number plasma ten million copies/ml the
cd4-positive cell count 21 cells/μl. although high fever resolved five 
days therapy mycobacterium avium started, fever recurred just
before starting anti-retroviral therapy (art) including dolutegravir. patient
experienced repeated self-limiting bouts severe inflammation.
mycobacteremia intermittently detected 79 days, suggesting the
recurrent episodes inflammation due intermittent dissemination 
mycobacteria, persistent treatment needed. five months the
beginning art, hiv-1 rna copy number plasma still 28,000
copies/ml. hiv drug-resistance test revealed sensitivity all
anti-retroviral drugs. eleven months initiation art, hiv rna
copy number plasma decreased 45 copies/ml cd4-positive cell
count recovered 205 cells/μl. case also suggests dolutegravir 
effective cases prolonged high levels hiv rna. findings emphasize 
that prompt diagnosis persistent therapy mycobacterial infection are
important successful treatment.
