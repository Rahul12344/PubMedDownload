initial recognition promoter dna rna polymerase (rnap) proposed to
trigger series conformational changes beginning bending wrapping of
the 40-50 bp dna immediately upstream -35 region. kinetic studies
demonstrated presence upstream dna facilitates bending entry of
the downstream duplex (to +20) active site cleft form advanced
closed complex (cc), prior melting ∼13 bp (-11 +2), including the
transcription start site (+1). atomic force microscopy footprinting revealed 
that stable open complex (oc) also highly wrapped (-60 +20). test
the proposed bent-wrapped model duplex dna advanced rnap-λp(r) cc and
compare wrapping cc oc, use fluorescence resonance energy transfer 
(fret) cyanine dyes far-upstream (-100) downstream (+14) positions
of promoter dna. similarly large intrinsic fret efficiencies observed the
cc (0.30 ± 0.07) oc (0.32 ± 0.11) probe orientations.
fluorescence enhancements +14 observed single-dye-labeled cc and
oc. results demonstrate upstream dna extensively wrapped the
start site region bent cleft advanced cc, reducing the
distance positions -100 +14 promoter dna >300 <100 å. 
proximity upstream dna downstream cleft advanced cc is
consistent proposed mechanism facilitation oc formation by
upstream dna.
