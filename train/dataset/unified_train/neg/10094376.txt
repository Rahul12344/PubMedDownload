recently, novel rna virus, designated gb virus c hepatitis g virus
(gbv-c/hgv) identified may possibly associated human
hepatitis. study, nucleotide sequences partial nonstructural 5
(ns5) gene gbv-c/hgv derived sera eight chinese patients were
determined. overall degree nucleotide conservation existence of
regional highly conserved sequences make part genome suitable the
development diagnostic reagents. basis sequence analysis, two sets
of oligonucleotide primers designed establish nested polymerase chain
reaction (pcr) detection gbv-c/hgv rna. efficacy three pcr methods 
(first, one stage pcr, second, nested pcr primers ns5 region
designed according prototype sequence third, newly developed
pcr) compared 133 chinese patients liver disease. positive rates 
of three methods 8.3%, 11.3% 18.0% respectively. specificity
of pcr detecting system verified sequencing restriction fragment
length polymorphism (rflp). conclusion, heterogeneity and
geographic distribution character gbv-c/hgv, necessary assess the
sequence variation among chinese patients infected gbv-c/hgv. may allow
to identify gbv-c/hgv rna high sensitivity specificity.
