purpose: previous studies, shown apathogenic rat parvovirus
h-1 (h-1pv) capable induce regression advanced symptomatic rat human
gliomas rat model, virus injected tumor (intracranially)
or intravenously. infection h-1pv provoke pathology nontumor 
tissue. study addresses question whether also intranasal application 
this oncolytic virus suitable sufficient treating gliomas this
animal model.
experimental design: rat (rg-2) human (u87) glioma cells grafted
stereotactically brain rats (wistar rnu, respectively), after
development tumors visible mri, h-1pv instilled intranasally. tumor
regression monitored mri, survival analyzed kaplan-meier
analysis. brains sacrificed animals analyzed histologic
alterations, presence viral dna proteins infectious virions. in
addition, distribution virus organs determined.
results: single intranasal instillation h-1pv sufficient induce
efficient regression rat glioma, leading significant prolongation of
survival without toxicity tissues. shown virus
reaches brain tissues, viral replication-associated (and
oncolysis-associated) regulatory proteins exclusively expressed tumor 
tissue. rats xenografts human glioma, oncolytic activity h-1pv 
less pronounced, however, leading significant prolongation survival.
conclusion: view ongoing clinical trial use h-1pv for
oncolytic virotherapy glioma, option applying virus intranasally
may valuable alternative invasive routes infection.
