summary understand better defence responses plants pathogen attack, 
we challenged hot pepper plants bacterial pathogens identified
transcription factor-encoding genes whose expression patterns altered during
the subsequent hypersensitive response. one genes, capif1 (capsicum
annuum pathogen-induced factor 1), characterized further. gene encodes a
plant-specific epf-type protein contains two cys(2)/his(2) zinc fingers.
capif1 expression rapidly specifically induced pepper plants were
challenged bacterial pathogens resistant. contrast,
challenge pathogen plants susceptible generated weak
capif1 expression. capif1 expression also strongly induced pepper leaves
by exogenous application ethephon, ethylene-releasing compound, and
salicylic acid, whereas methyl jasmonate moderate effects. capif1
localized nuclei onion epidermis expressed capif1-smgfp
fusion protein. transgenic tobacco plants over-expressing capif1 driven the
camv 35s promoter showed increased resistance challenge a
tobacco-specific pathogen non-host bacterial pathogens. plants also
showed constitutive up-regulation multiple defence-related genes. moreover,
virus-induced silencing capif1 orthologue nicotiana benthamiana
enhanced susceptibility host non-host bacterial pathogens. these
observations provide evidence epf-type cys(2)/his(2) zinc-finger protein 
plays crucial role activation pathogen defence response in
plants.
