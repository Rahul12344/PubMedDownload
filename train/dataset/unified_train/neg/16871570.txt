for making treatment decisions related chronic hepatitis c, utility hcv
rna tests increased sensitivity defined. prior interferon
nonresponders advanced fibrosis (n = 1,145) retreated with
peginterferon alpha-2a ribavirin. patients hcv rna-negative a
polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based assay (roche cobas amplicor hcv test, v.
2.0; lower limit detection [lod] 100 iu/ml) week 20 (w20) received
treatment 48 weeks. stored specimens tested using bayer versant hcv 
rna qualitative (tma) assay (lod 9.6 iu/ml) compared pcr results the
ability predict sustained virological response (svr; defined undetectable
hcv rna pcr w72). nearly pcr-positive samples (1006/1007, 99.9%) were
positive assessed tma. among 1,294 pcr-negative samples, 22% were
tma-positive. negative tma results predictive svr negative
pcr results w12 (82% vs. 64%, p < .001) w20 (66% vs. 52%, p = 0.001).
svr likely earlier tma become negative treatment (82% 
w12, 44% w20, 20% w24). among 45 patients tma-positive were
pcr-negative w20 w24, none achieved svr (95% ci: 0%-8%). approximately 10%
of patients single positive tma result end treatment still
achieved svr. conclusion, negative tma results w12 superior
to negative pcr results predicting svr. patients negative pcr results
during treatment, single positive tma test exclude svr, although
persistently positive tests did.
