introduction: although integration human t-cell lymphotropic virus type 
into t-cells random process, mechanistic details not
understood.
objectives: characteristics flanking host chromatin evaluated 
the integration sites adult t-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (atll) patients infected
with virus.
materials methods: seven leukemic colombian patients positive the
human t-cell lymphotropic virus type (htlv-i), lymphocyte dna samples were
extracted amplified inverse polymerase chain reaction (ipcr). clonal
expansion human genome nucleotide composition extension 50 bp was
determined. establish characteristics human genome flanking
provirus, 61 ipcr sequences colombian japanese atll patients, were
analyzed silico obtain insights genomic structure, functions 
nature associated chromatin.
results: clonal expansion cell clones predominantly oligoclonal. 
61 ipcr sequences, 155 alignments homology higher 95% (e-value < 0.05) 
were screened. seventy-five percent sequences corresponded non coding
elements include repetitive non-repetitive dna. fifty percent the
proviral integrations associated chromosomes b groups. viral
dna integration tended favor exons genes replicated early, controlled 
the cell cycle, involved signal transduction.
conclusions: results indicated htlv-i integration preferentially
directed towards genomic environments high c:g content, toward genes
that replicate early, regulate cell cycle involved signal transduction.
