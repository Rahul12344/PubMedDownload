background: micrornas (mirna) abundant circulation play central 
role diverse biologic processes; may useful early diagnosis of
hepatocellular carcinoma.
methods: conducted two-phase, case-control study (20 pairs discovery
set 49 pairs validation set) test hypothesis genome-wide 
dysregulation circulating mirnas differentiates hepatocellular carcinoma cases
from controls. taqman low-density arrays used examine genome-wide mirna
expression discovery set, quantitative real-time pcr used to
validate candidate mirnas discovery validation sets.
results: sixty-six mirnas found significantly overexpressed plasma 
of hepatocellular carcinoma cases compared controls adjusting for
false discovery rate (p < 0.05). volcano plot indicated seven mirnas had
greater 2-fold case-control differences p < 0.01. four significant
mirnas (mir-150, mir-30c, mir-483-5p, mir-520b) detectable samples
with varied expression levels validated validation set.
mir-483-5p statistically significantly overexpressed hepatocellular
carcinoma cases compared controls (3.20 vs. 0.82, p < 0.0001).
hepatocellular carcinoma risk factors clinic-pathological characteristics did
not influence mir-483-5p expression. combination plasma mir-483-5p level
and hepatitis c virus status significantly differentiate hepatocellular
carcinoma cases controls area curve 0.908 (p < 0.0001).
the sensitivity specificity were, respectively, 75.5% 89.8%.
conclusions: preliminary results suggest importance dysregulated
circulating mir-483-5p potential hepatocellular carcinoma biomarker.
impact: confirmation aberrant expression mir-483-5p large prospective 
hepatocellular carcinoma study provide support application to
hepatocellular carcinoma detection.
