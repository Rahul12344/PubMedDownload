the role antigenemia assay diagnosis prediction human
cytomegalovirus (hcmv) disease aids patients evaluated. clinical
history 62 patients advanced hiv infection total 248 blood
samples drawn tested hcmv antigenemia assay examined
retrospectively. december 1992 january 1994, 28 episodes hcmv
disease organ involvement recorded; antigenemia assay positive 
in 23 (82.1%). particular, test positive 11 12 (91.6%) 
first episodes 3 3 (100%) recurrent episodes occurring patients 
receiving maintenance therapy. test positive 9 13 (69.2%)
recurrent episodes occurring patients receiving maintenance therapy. first
occurrence hcmv disease always preceded positive antigenemia assay 2 
and 4 months diagnosis (in 7 patients 7 blood sample
was available hcmv disease). positive antigenemia test result not
always followed organ involvement, high positive cell count (>
100/200,000 polymorphonuclear leukocytes) strongly correlated appearance
of hcmv disease following 1 3 months (100% cases). antigenemia
assay useful reliable indirect method diagnosis prediction
of hcmv end-organ disease severely persistently immunocompromised aids
patients.
