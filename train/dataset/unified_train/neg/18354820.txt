background: enteroviruses (ev) parechoviruses (hpev) common
causes aseptic meningitis, encephalitis sepsis-like syndrome neonates. 
detection nucleic acid amplification methods improves patient management.
objective: development real-time pcr assay lightcycler simultaneous
detection ev, hpev internal control monitor inhibition.
study design: investigated value new assay, prospectively, a
variety samples patients suspected viral meningitis or
sepsis-like syndrome.
results: assay detected 64 ev serotypes hpev types 1-4. 186 patients, 
63 (33.9%) ev positive 18 (9.7%) hpev positive one samples.
in 43 159 feces 6 57 throat samples viral culture pcr were
positive. real-time pcr 27 extra ev 19 hpev positives found. blood 
and csf present 33 patients. 19 patients blood csf were
positive, one positive csf, two positive blood, 11 
negative. 96 patients csf and/or blood samples tested compared to
results throat and/or feces samples. forty patients ev-pcr 14
hpev-pcr positive blood and/or csf. confirmed positive 
pcr respective virus feces and/or throat.
conclusions: simultaneous detection ev hpev two-step real-time
pcr specific, faster sensitive viral culture. systemic
infections (blood csf positive) confirmed feces. culture longer 
necessary clinical diagnosis performed pcr-positive
samples obtain isolates typing purposes. application assay an
important improvement patient management since outcome analysis is
available within time frame clinical decision-making.
