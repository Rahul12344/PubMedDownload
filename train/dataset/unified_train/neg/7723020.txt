we report studies determine bacteriophage genes required for
assembly phage hk97 proheads roles play. identify gene
encoding major capsid protein phage hk97 report dna sequence,
together dna sequences two genes immediately upstream it.
when capsid protein expressed plasmid absence other
phage-encoded proteins, assembles, good efficiency accuracy into
prohead-like structures composed unprocessed 42 kda capsid protein. no
separately encoded scaffolding protein required assembly. 25
kda product next gene upstream co-expressed capsid protein,
the prohead structures produced undergo normal morphogenetic
cleavage, removes 102 amino acids n terminus subunit,
leaving 31 kda subunits. 25 kda protein therefore probably phage-encoded
protease. third gene, upstream protease gene, encodes portal
protein. presence portal protein required assembly the
capsid protein. analysis phenotypes four single amino acid-substitution
mutants capsid-protein gene leads several insights functions
of capsid protein interactions putative protease.
