human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) viral protein r (vpr) exerts multiple
effects viral host cellular activities viral infection, including
nuclear transport proviral integration complex, induction cell cycle
g(2) arrest, cell death. report, show fission yeast
chaperone protein hsp16 inhibits hiv-1 suppressing vpr activities. 
protein identified three independent genome-wide screens for
multicopy suppressors three vpr activities. consistent the
properties heat shock protein, heat shock-induced elevation or
overproduction hsp16 suppressed vpr activities direct protein-protein 
interaction. even though hsp16 shows stronger suppressive effect vpr in
fission yeast mammalian cells, similar effects also observed in
human cells fission yeast hsp16 expressed either vpr-expressing cells
or hiv-1 infection, indicating possible highly conserved vpr suppressing
activity. furthermore, stable expression hsp16 prior hiv-1 infection
inhibits viral replication vpr-dependent manner. together, data
suggest hsp16 inhibits hiv-1 suppressing vpr-specific activities. this
finding could potentially provide new approach studying contribution 
vpr viral pathogenesis reducing vpr-mediated detrimental effects in
hiv-infected patients.
