expression cloning technology cdnas suitable tool identifying novel
functional properties genes. here, generated lentiviral cdna
library-expressing system human cells based site-specific
recombination system phage lambda transferring cdna libraries a
minimum loss complexity. library-transduced cd4(+) cells were
challenged wild-type human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1), the
cells acquired resistance hiv-1-induced cytopathic effect (cpe) were
selected. cells, cd14 isolated proved inhibit entry 
hiv-1 hiv-1-induced cpe. cloning system allows rapid identification 
of genes encoding novel properties human cells probably mammalian 
cells.
