purpose review: prolonged suppression plasma viremia achievable a
majority hiv-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy (art).
however, art alone cannot eradicate hiv infected individuals. purpose of
this review discuss importance tracking levels infected cd4(+) 
cells carrying replication-competent hiv basic clinical research how
the use virologic marker could help determine efficacy art and
several novel therapeutic strategies proposed eliminating
persistent viral reservoir infected individuals receiving art.
recent findings: recent years, growing interest within the
hiv/aids scientific community develop therapeutic strategies aimed at
eliminating persistently infected cd4(+) cells order achieve cure for
hiv infected individuals receiving art. approaches include
administration hiv-activating agents, modification genetics cd4(+) t
cells, stem cell transplantation, therapeutic vaccination. approaches
would ultimately require careful accurate assessments effect of
therapeutic agents hiv burden infected individuals.
summary: given majority infected cd4(+) cells vivo carry
replication-defective hiv, longitudinal measurements frequency cells
carrying replication-competent hiv along quantitative virologic
parameters, levels plasma viremia cell-associated viral nucleic
acid, provide critical insight dynamics persistent viral
reservoirs. information related hiv pathogenesis feasibility of
eradicating virus infected individuals receiving art combination with
novel therapeutic agents also gained analyses.
