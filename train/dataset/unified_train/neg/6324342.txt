primary structure v-raf: relatedness src family oncogenes.

mark ge, rapp ur.

a replication-defective, acute transforming retrovirus (murine sarcoma virus
3611) isolated mouse molecularly cloned. nucleotide sequence 
1.5 kilobases encompassing transforming gene (v-raf) determined. this
sequence, predicts amino acid sequence gag-raf fusion protein,
terminates 180 nucleotides 3' end acquired cellular sequence.
comparison predicted amino acid sequence v-raf predicted amino
acid sequences oncogenes reveals significant homologies src
family oncogenes. lack homology within sequence the
tyrosine acceptor domain described phosphotyrosine kinase members 
src family transforming proteins. phylogenetic arrangement family of
oncogenes suggests tyrosine-specific phosphorylation may recently
acquired activity.
