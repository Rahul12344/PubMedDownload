hepatitis b virus (hbv) core (hbc) virus-like particles (vlps) one the
most powerful protein engineering tools utilised expose immunological epitopes
and/or cell-targeting signals packaging genetic material and
immune stimulatory sequences. although hbc vlps numerous derivatives
are produced highly efficient bacterial yeast expression systems, the
existing purification packaging protocols sufficiently optimised 
standardised. here, simple alkaline treatment method employed the
complete removal internal rna bacteria- yeast-produced hbc vlps and
for conversion vlps empty particles, without damage 
vlp structure. empty hbc vlps able effectively package added dna 
and rna sequences. furthermore, alkaline hydrolysis technology appeared
efficient purification packaging four different hbc variants
carrying lysine residues hbc vlp spikes. utilising introduced lysine
residues intrinsic aspartic glutamic acid residues exposed the
tips hbc spikes chemical coupling chosen peptide and/or nucleic
acid sequences ensured standard easy protocol development
of versatile hbc vlp-based vaccine gene therapy applications.
