outbreaks h5n1 subtype highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (hpaiv) were
recorded chickens, domesticated birds wild birds throughout japan from
november 2010 march 2011. genetic analysis japanese isolates indicated 
that gene segments, except pa gene, closely related japanese wild
bird isolates 2008 belonged clade 2.3.2.1 classified who/oie/fao
h5n1 evolution working group. direct ancestors pa gene segment all
japanese viruses analyzed study found wild bird strains of
several subtypes h5n1 isolated 2007 2009. pa gene of
these wild bird isolates share common ancestor h5n1 hpaivs belonging to
clades 2.5, 7 9, indicating wild birds involved emergence of
the current reassortant 2.3.2.1 viruses. determine viruses maintained
in wild bird population, two isolates derived chickens
(a/chicken/shimane/1/2010, ck10 a/chicken/miyazaki/s4/2011, cks411) one
from wild bird (a/mandarin duck/miyazaki/22m-765/2011, mandarind11) were
compared ability infect transmitted chickens. a
significant difference survival chickens infected with
10(6)eid(50) cks411 compared mandarind11 transmission
efficiency cks411 greater viruses. increased titer of
cks411 excreted infected chickens contributed improved transmission
rates. considered reduced virus excretion transmission of
mandarind11 could due adaptation virus wild birds.
