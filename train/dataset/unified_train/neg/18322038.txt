retroviruses important group pathogens cause variety diseases
in humans animals. four human retroviruses currently known, including
human immunodeficiency virus type 1, causes aids, human t-lymphotropic 
virus type 1, causes cancer inflammatory disease. many years, there
have sporadic reports additional human retroviral infections,
particularly cancer chronic diseases. unfortunately, many these
putative viruses remain unproven controversial, retrovirologists
have dismissed merely "human rumor viruses." work field last 
reviewed depth 1984, since then, molecular techniques available for
identifying characterizing retroviruses improved enormously in
sensitivity. advent pcr particular dramatically enhanced our
ability detect novel viral sequences human tissues. however, dna
amplification techniques also increased potential false-positive
detection due contamination. addition, presence many families of
human endogenous retroviruses (hervs) within dna obstruct attempts to
identify validate novel human retroviruses. here, aim bring together
the data "novel" retroviral infections humans critically examining the
evidence putative viruses linked disease the
likelihood represent genuine human infections. provide background 
to field discussion potential confounding factors along some
technical guidelines. addition, difficulties associated with
obtaining formal proof causation common ubiquitous agents hervs
are discussed.
