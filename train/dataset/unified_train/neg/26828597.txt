african swine fever haemorrhagic disease pig production have
disastrous financial consequences farming. vaccines currently
available animal slaughtering area zoning restrict risk-related
movements effective measures prevent spread disease.
ornithodoros soft ticks known transmit african swine fever virus
(asfv) pigs farms, following natural epidemiologic cycle virus. 
tick saliva shown modulate host physiological immunological
responses feeding skin, thus affecting viral infection. better
understand interaction soft tick, asfv pig bite location
and possible influence tick saliva pig infection asfv, salivary
gland extract (sge) ornithodoros porcinus, co-inoculated asfv, was
used intradermal auricular inoculation. results showed that, the
virus triggered disease, pigs inoculated virus sge presented greater
hyperthermia pigs inoculated virus alone. density langerhans
cells modulated tick bite inoculation site, either through
recruitment asfv inhibition sge. additionally, sge virus induced
macrophage recruitment each. effect enhanced were
co-inoculated. finally, co-inoculation sge virus delayed early
local spread virus first lymph node inoculation side. study
has shown effect sge powerful enough quantified pig both
on systemic local immune response. believe model be
developed infected tick could improve knowledge tick vector
competence tick saliva immunomodulation.
