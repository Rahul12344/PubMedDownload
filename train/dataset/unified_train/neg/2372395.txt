antiviral activity found conceptus placental tissues numerous 
species, including mice, pigs, sheep, cattle humans. sheep cattle, the
antiviral activity due interferon alpha (ifn-alpha), other
species nature protein(s) responsible placental activity is
unknown. objectives study determine constitutive
antiviral activity associated mouse conceptus produced early as
the peri-implantation period, determine activity due an
ifn-alpha -beta. conceptus placental tissue explants released antiviral
activity day 4 least day 16 gestation measured agar
overlay bioassay employing cho cells challenged vesicular stomatitis virus. 
this activity neutralized antiserum muifn-alpha/beta. same
antiserum failed, however, immunoprecipitate radiolabeled proteins medium
collected day 4 blastocysts cultured presence l-[35s]-methionine. 
s1 nuclease analysis placental rna screening ectoplacental cone and
extraembryonic ectoderm cdna libraries muifn-alpha -beta probes failed
to detect ifn related mrnas, even relatively non-stringent conditions of
hybridization. thus, antiviral activity produced peri-implantation
conceptuses several diverse mammalian species, appear due to
a conserved type ifn species.
