objective: report process used rapidly develop collaborative adult
respiratory extracorporeal membrane oxygenation program response caring
for young adult patients refractory hypoxemia setting ph1n1
pandemic.
design: interdisciplinary response complex medical system public health
crisis. patients, interventions, measurements, main results: the
successful use extracorporeal membrane oxygenation young adults with
ph1n1-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome refractory conventional
therapies, adult venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation program was
implemented 8-wk period. implementation program involved number
of key steps crucial development process, including
administrative institutional support, multidisciplinary leadership and
collaboration, extensive interdisciplinary educational initiatives, and
substantial technical modifications.
conclusions: setting ph1n1 influenza pandemic, adult respiratory
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation program successfully developed to
complement established neonatal-pediatric program. program expansion
integrated necessary components involved development process
from start finish confirms healthcare system respond very
quickly successfully urgent healthcare need.
