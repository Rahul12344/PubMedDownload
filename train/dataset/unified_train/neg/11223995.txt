adenoviral vector-mediated transient gene expression provide new
possibilities ex vivo manipulation quiescent hematopoietic stem cells
(hsc). order define suitable expression cassette high levels of
transgene expression hscs, studied level transgene expression
in human cd34+cd38- cells using adenoviral vectors various gene expression
cassettes encoding enhanced green fluorescence protein (egfp) gene. cd34+
hematopoietic cells cultured serum-free medium megakaryocyte growth 
and development factor (mgdf) alone supporting survival primitive
progenitors mgdf, c-kit ligand (kl) flt3 ligand (fl) inducing
proliferation primitive progenitors. vectors tested, higher
percentages egfp expressing cells found cd34+cd38- cells in
cd34+cd38high cells donors tested. phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk)-1
