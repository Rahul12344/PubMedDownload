immunodominant epitopes. recent evidence suggested, however, subtle
changes nature ligand may also affect outcome t-cell 
receptor (tcr) ligation, necessitating re-evaluation previously accepted
paradigms t-cell activation. particular, activation may longer be
regarded all-or-nothing event, appears involve quantitative and
qualitative dimensions. revolution understanding emanated from
the recent discovery analogues immunogenic peptides, so-called altered
peptide ligands (apls), may elicit subset normal activation events, or
profoundly influence responses wild-type epitope. such, potential

autoimmune disease holds promise exploitation within clinical
arena.
