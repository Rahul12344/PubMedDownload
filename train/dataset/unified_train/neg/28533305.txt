introduction: hiv infection certain antiretroviral therapy (art) medications 
increase atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, mediated, part, 
traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors.
methods results: studied cardiovascular disease risk factor changes the
start (strategic timing antiretroviral treatment) trial, randomized study of
immediate versus deferred art initiation among hiv-positive persons cd4+
cell counts >500 cells/mm3. mean change baseline risk factors the
incidence comorbid conditions compared groups. the
characteristics among 4685 hiv-positive start trial participants include median
age 36 years, cd4 cell count 651 cells/mm3, hiv viral load of
12 759 copies/ml, current smoking status 32%, median systolic/diastolic
blood pressure 120/76 mm hg, median levels total cholesterol of
168 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 102 mg/dl, high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol 41 mg/dl. mean follow-up 3.0 years. immediate 
and deferred art groups spent 94% 28% follow-up time taking art,
respectively. compared patients deferral group, patients the
immediate art group increased total cholesterol low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol higher use lipid-lowering therapy (1.2%; 95% ci, 0.1-2.2).
concurrent increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol immediate art
resulted 0.1 lower total cholesterol high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
ratio (95% ci, 0.1-0.2). immediate art resulted 2.3% less bp-lowering therapy 
use (95% ci, 0.9-3.6), differences new-onset hypertension or
diabetes mellitus.
conclusions: among hiv-positive persons preserved immunity, immediate art
led increases total cholesterol low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but
also concurrent increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased
use blood pressure medications. opposing effects suggest that, the
short term, net effect early art traditional cardiovascular disease
risk factors may clinically insignificant."
