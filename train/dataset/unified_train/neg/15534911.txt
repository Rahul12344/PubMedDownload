aim: conflicting data p53 function cellular sensitivity the
cytotoxic action 5-fluorouracil (5-fu). therefore objective study 
was determine combined effects adenovirus-mediated wild-type (wt) p53
gene transfer 5-fu chemotherapy pancreatic cancer cells different p53
gene status.
methods: human pancreatic cancer cell lines capan-1(p53mut), capan-2(p53wt),
fampac(p53mut), panc1(p53mut), rat pancreatic cancer cell lines as(p53wt) and
dsl6a(p53null) used vitro studies. following infection different
ratios ad-p53-particles (moi) combination 5-fu, proliferation tumor
cells apoptosis quantified cell proliferation assay (wst-1) facs 
(pi-staining). addition, dsl6a syngeneic pancreatic tumor cells were
inoculated subcutaneously lewis rats vivo studies. tumor size,
apoptosis (tunel) survival determined.
results: ad-p53 gene transfer combined 5-fu significantly inhibited tumor
cell proliferation substantially enhanced apoptosis four cell lines
with alteration p53 gene compared two cell lines containing
wt-p53. vivo experiments showed effective tumor regression animals
treated ad-p53 plus 5-fu. vitro vivo analyses revealed a
sublethal dose ad-p53 augmented apoptotic response induced 5-fu.
conclusion: results suggest ad-p53 may synergistically enhance
5-fu-chemosensitivity strikingly pancreatic cancer cells lacking p53
function. findings illustrate anticancer efficacy this
combination treatment dependent p53 gene status target tumor
cells.
