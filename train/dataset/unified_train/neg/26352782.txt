heat shock factor 1 (hsf1) serves important role regulating the
proliferation human tumor cell lines vitro tissue specific
tumorigenesis certain mouse models. however, role viral‑oncogenesis
remains fully elucidated. current study, role hsf1 in
fibroblastoma derived simian virus 40/t antigen (sv40/tag)‑transformed mouse
embryonic fibroblast (mef) cell lines investigated. knockout hsf1
inhibited mef cell proliferation vitro fibroblastoma growth metastasis
to lungs vivo nude mice. knockout hsf1 increased protein
expression levels p53 phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (prb), however
reduced expression heat shock protein 25 (hsp25) addition the
expression angiogenesis markers vascular endothelial growth factor,
cluster differentiation 34 factor viii related antigen. furthermore,
immunoprecipitation indicated knockout hsf1 inhibited association
between sv40/tag p53 prb. data suggest hsf1 involved 
regulation sv40/tag‑derived fibroblastoma growth metastasis modulating 
the association sv40/tag tumor suppressor p53 prb. current
study provides evidence hsf1 may novel therapeutic target in
the treatment cancer.
