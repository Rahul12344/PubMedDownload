transient expression engineered reporter rnas encoding intron-containing
green fluorescent protein (gfp) potato virus x-based expression vector
previously demonstrated nuclear targeting capability 359 nucleotide
potato spindle tuber viroid (pstvd) rna genome. delimit putative
nuclear-targeting signal, pstvd subgenomic fragments embedded within the
intron, recombinant reporter rnas inoculated onto nicotiana benthamiana 
plants. appearance green fluorescence leaf tissue inoculated with
pstvd-fragment-containing constructs indicated shuttling rna the
nucleus fragments short 80 nucleotides length. plant-to-plant
variation timing intron removal subsequent gfp fluorescence was
observed; however, earliest abundant gfp expression obtained with
constructs containing conserved hairpin palindrome structure embedded
upper central conserved region. results suggest conserved sequence 
and/or stem-loop structure forms sufficient import pstvd into
the nucleus.
