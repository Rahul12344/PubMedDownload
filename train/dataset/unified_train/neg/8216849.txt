recently, demonstrated direct inoculation hemagglutinin 7
(h7)-expressing dna could vaccinate chickens lethal h7 influenza virus 
challenge. experiments used defective-retroviral-based vector express 
h7 (p188) (robinson et al., 1993). here, report protective immunizations using
a non-retroviral-based vector h7 expression (pcmv/h7). unlike previously 
used retroviral-based vector, vector cannot transmitted infectious 
agent (as consequence phenotypic mixing exogenous endogenous virus
proteins). vaccination accomplished inoculating young, immunocompetent
chickens three routes (intravenous, intraperitoneal, and
intramuscular) 100 micrograms cesium chloride-purified pcmv/h7 dna in
saline. two immunizations, birds challenged via nares a
lethal dose highly virulent chicken influenza virus h7 subtype. the
results five independent vaccine trials demonstrated protective immunizations 
in approximately 60% pcmv/h7 dna-inoculated chickens. contrast, 3%
of chickens inoculated control dna survived lethal challenge.
