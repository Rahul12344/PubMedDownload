the 3'-portion genome taiwan isolate porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome (prrs) virus, strain md-001, cloned sequenced. the
resultant 549 nucleotides contained open reading frame coding capacity 
of 123 amino acids (predicted mr 13,600). predicted protein corresponds to
the nucleocapsid protein, gene product orf7. comparative sequence analysis
of several known prrsv strains indicated protein showed highest
degree amino acid similarity us vr2332 canadian iaf-exp91
strains (92.7%) least dutch lelystad strain (56.5%). the
phylogenic trees constructed basis known prrsv nucleotide sequences
indicated md-001 strain belongs north american strain cluster and
that distinct european virus.
