in order trace origin evolution avian infectious bronchitis virus
(ibv) isolates china southeast asia, genomic sequencing used for
molecular characterization 24 ibv isolates two reference strains in
comparison published sequences. 5' region s1 genes,
containing hypervariable regions ii, 3' region nucleocapsid
genes, containing cytotoxic lymphocyte epitopes, used construct
phylogenetic trees analysis. results showed 24 isolates could be
divided three distinct groups, is, american, asian, european. 
isolates formed distinct asian phylogenetic group, suggesting ibv has
existed time asia. results also showed vivo recombination
of ibv may occurred rather high frequency, contributing the
diversity ibv isolates. importantly, recombination events probably 
occurred vaccine strains field strains natural condition.
