interferons (ifns) crucial host defence viruses. many
ifn-stimulated genes (isgs) induced viral infection exert antiviral effects.
microarray analysis gene expression induced liver tissues mice dengue
virus (denv) infection led identification isg gene isg12b2. isg12b2
is also dramatically induced denv infection hepa 1-6 cells (mouse hepatoma 
cell line). here, performed biochemical functional analyses isg12b2. we
demonstrate isg12b2 inner mitochondrial membrane (imm) protein
containing cleavable mitochondrial targeting sequence multiple
transmembrane segments. overexpression isg12b2 hepa 1-6 induced release 
cytochrome c mitochondria, disruption mitochondrial membrane
potential, activation caspase-9, caspase-3, caspase-8. treatment of
isg12b2-overexpressing hepa 1-6 inhibitors pan-caspase, caspase-9, or
caspase-3, caspase-8, reduced apoptotic cell death, suggesting that
isg12b2 activates intrinsic apoptotic pathway. particular interest, we
further demonstrated isg12b2 formed oligomers, isg12b2 able 
mediate apoptosis bax/bak-dependent bax/bak-independent
pathways. study demonstrates isg12b2 novel imm protein induced 
by ifns regulates mitochondria-mediated apoptosis viral infection.
