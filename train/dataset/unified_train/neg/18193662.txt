to prevent spread infection. however, major epidemics continue to
occur, clinicians must also focus optimising management. although specific 
treatment available present, good supportive care, mortality for
children dhf reduced well 1%. patients without signs of
shock, fluid replacement attempted orally, children dss
parenteral treatment essential. careful titration fluid therapy is
necessary combined frequent reassessment signs worsening shock the
development fluid overload. dss cases isotonic crystalloid solutions
are effective colloid solutions, question whether early
intervention colloid solutions improves outcome advanced shock
requires investigation. outcome studies address question, 
together research examine pathophysiological mechanisms
underlying plasma leakage, hopefully result better management of
children severe dengue may also provide useful insights other
diseases affect endothelial function.
