persistent excretion 3-methylglutaconic acid found 6-month-old infant
with multiple minor physical malformations delayed development. two
episodes intercurrent viral illness, patient developed severe metabolic
acidosis excreted large amounts lactate, 3-hydroxybutyrate and
acetoacetate. excretion 3-methylglutaconic acid change during
these episodes, increase following leucine loading. vitro studies
suggest patient, majority patients with
3-methylglutaconic aciduria, primary defect leucine metabolism not
responsible biochemical abnormality.
