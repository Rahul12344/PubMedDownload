a small number human myelomas established long term cultured cell
lines. report characteristics two new cell lines, designated sk-mm-1
and sk-mm-2, derived 73 attempts culture myeloma specimens. cell
lines grown myeloma patients hypogammaglobulinemia, kappa light
chain proteinuria, plasma cell leukemia. sk-mm-1 sk-mm-2 a
plasmacytoid morphology, grew rpmi complete medium doubling times 32
and 60 hr, respectively, express epstein-barr virus nuclear antigen. 
both cell lines secreted kappa light chains (0.9 1.1 micrograms/10(6)
cells/ml per 48 hr sk-mm-1 sk-mm-2, respectively) heavy chains.
sk-mm-1 sk-mm-2 expressed pan-b cell marker b1 late b cell/plasma
cell marker bl3. addition, sk-mm-2 expressed late b cell/plasma cell markers
okt10 pca-1. neither cell line expressed lymphocyte, myeloid, early b
lymphocyte markers. presence distinctive kappa heavy chain gene
rearrangements supported clonal origin cell lines kappa light
chain-producing b cells. two cell lines markedly aneuploid both
carried 14q+ marker chromosome. human myeloma cell lines lacking heavy chain
secretion may useful elucidate mechanisms immunoglobulin gene regulation
and construct human-human hybridomas.
