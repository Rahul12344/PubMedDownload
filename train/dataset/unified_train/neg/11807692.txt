highly active antiretroviral therapies (haarts) contain human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) protease inhibitors (pis) nonnucleoside
reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (nnrtis) compared effect on
secretory aspartyl proteinase (sap), virulence trait mucosal candidiasis.
in therapy-naive hiv-positive subjects, oral sap detected 11, 6, 3, 0, and
0 15 subjects treated pi-haart 7, 7, 9, 6, 5 15 subjects
treated nnrti-haart, days 0, 14, 30, 90, 180 treatment,
respectively. another 30 subjects, sap detected 0 7 15 subjects 
after 1 year treatment pi-haart nnrti-haart, respectively. the
anti-sap effect pi-haart associated clinical resolution oral
candidiasis late inconstant recovery anticandidal cellular
immunity. subjects, 2 therapeutic regimens compared well increasing
cd4(+) cell count abating viremia. thus, pis exert early, immune
reconstitution-independent effect candida virulence oral cavities of
hiv-positive subjects.
