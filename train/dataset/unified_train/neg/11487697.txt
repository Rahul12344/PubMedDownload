various sequences within tag1, endogenous transposon arabidopsis, were
examined determine tag1 excision expression regulated. 5'
intron major 2.3-kb tag1 transcript found critical the
accumulation tag1 transcripts high rates somatic excision. was
true autonomous element cauliflower mosaic virus
35s-tag1-beta-glucuronidase constructs two-component system using the
35s promoter produce tag1 transposase beta-glucuronidase::dtag1 marker
construct score excision. 3' introns tag1, although needed 
high transposase expression primary transgenic plants, important for
maintaining high levels somatic excision accumulation major not
the minor tag1 transcripts subsequent generations. 5' 3' introns
present, exchanging 5' promoter region tag1 35s promoter 
affect timing tag1 excision significantly, disrupt germinal
excision. removal 5' intron abolish germinal excision activity,
however. results indicate somatic germinal excision tag1 are
differentially controlled, 5' promoter region critical for
germinal excision activity 5' intron playing important role for
somatic excision, possibly via intron-mediated enhancement.
