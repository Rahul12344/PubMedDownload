expression parathyroid hormone-related protein (pthrp), protein that
plays primary role development humoral hypercalcemia of
malignancy, regulated two distinct promoters, p1 p2. pthrp is
overexpressed lymphocytes adult t-cell leukemia patients. now
demonstrate human t-cell lymphotropic virus type i-transformed cell
line mt-2, rna synthesis initiated primarily p2 promoter. furthermore, 
in cotransfection experiments, tax1 transactivates p2 promoter 10- to
12-fold. using deletion site-specific point mutations, identified 
a promoter-proximal sequence (positions -72 -40) important tax1
transactivation. pthrp promoter-proximal element contains two potential
overlapping ets1 binding sites, ebs ebs ii. gel shift analysis demonstrated
that ets1 binds specifically ebs ebs ii. mutation consensus 
ggaa core motif ebs abolished binding tax1 transactivation jurkat t
lymphocytes. ets1-deficient cells, cotransfection tax1 ets1 expression 
plasmids stimulates pthrp promoter activity. absence ets1, minimal
transactivation pthrp promoter observed. data suggest ets1
binds ebs cooperates tax1 transactivate pthrp p2 promoter.
