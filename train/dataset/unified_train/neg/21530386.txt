background: acute parvovirus b19 (b19v) infection characterized high-level 
viremia. antibodies capsid proteins vp1 vp2 may complex with
b19v-particles thereby becoming undetectable diagnostic tests.
objectives: intended obtain data frequency false-negative
serology acute b19v-infection.
study design: 129 plasma serum samples healthy blood donors patients
with suspected b19v-infection analyzed b19v-dna qpcr and
vp1/vp2-specific igg igm elisa. eleven samples derived 
four pregnant women previous contact b19v-infected individuals. using
acidic conditions virus/antibody-complexes disrupted detected by
westernline elisa.
results: 83/118 samples derived acutely infected individuals displaying
viremia (10(3)-10(12)geq/ml). 24/83 viremic samples (28.9%) vp1/vp2-specific
igm igg undetectable elisa, could demonstrated complexed
with b19v-particles. 7/83 (8.4%) igm-positive/igg-negative and
igm-negative/igg-positive, 45/83 samples (54.2%) igg igm could be
detected. 35 samples contain b19v-dna; five from
seronegative persons. analyzing consecutive sera derived four pregnant
women, b19v-dna demonstrated 10/11 samples, b19v-specific igg- and
igm-antibodies detectable 10/11 4/11 samples, respectively. 2/4
women seroconversion observed, igm detected 50% the
samples. b19v-specific igg igm detectable 2/4 women.
conclusion: acute b19v-infection cannot diagnosed exclusive analysis of
b19v-specific antibodies. combination assays detection of
b19v-dna antibodies enables correct serodiagnosis.
