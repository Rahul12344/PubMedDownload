adeno-associated viral (aav) vectors gene vectors choice the
development gene therapy treatments many rare diseases affecting various
tissues including retina, central nervous system, liver, muscle. aav
based gene therapy approach became conceivable development of
easily scalable production systems including sf9 cell/baculovirus expression 
system. since establishment production aav sf9/baculovirus
system group rob kotin, new production system largely been
developed optimizing large scale production different serotypes aav
for preclinical clinical purposes. today manufacturing system allows for
the production purified vector genome (vg) quantities 2 × 10(15) 
aav1 using 50l reactor scale larger reactor volumes paralleled
by corresponding increase vector yield. review presents the
principles achievements sf9/baculovirus system production of
aav comparison expression systems based mammalian cells. in
addition, new developments improvements, yet implemented 
at large scale, perspectives optimization production
system discussed. achievements well process
intensifications urgently needed production clinical doses the
treatment neuromuscular diseases estimated doses to
10(14)vg/kg body mass required.
