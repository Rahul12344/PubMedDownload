3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-n-[4([[5-(dimethylamino)-1-naphthyl]sulfonyl]amino)-phenyl
]propanamide (bay 38-4766) novel selective nonnucleoside inhibitor of
cytomegalovirus (cmv) replication excellent safety profile. compound
and structural analogues inhibit neither viral dna synthesis viral
transcription translation. accumulation dense bodies noninfectious
enveloped particles coincides inhibition concatemer processing and
functional cleavage intergenomic transitions, pointing interference with
viral dna maturation packaging monomeric genome lengths. resistant virus
populations, including murine cmv (mcmv) isolate 566-fold-decreased drug
sensitivity, selected vitro. sequencing six open reading frames

identified mutations orfs ul56, ul89, ul104. construction mcmv
recombinants expressing different combinations murine homologues mutant
ul56, ul89, ul104 analysis drug susceptibilities clearly demonstrated 
that mutant orfs ul89 exon ii (m360i) m56 (p202a i208n) individually confer
resistance bay 38-4766. combination mutant proteins exhibited a
strong synergistic effect resistance, reconstituting high-resistance
phenotype vitro mutant. findings consistent genetic

benzimidazole) (p. m. krosky et al., j. virol. 72:4721-4728, 1998) provide
further indirect evidence proteins encoded ul89 ul56 function two 
subunits cmv terminase. studies also suggest the
molecular mechanism bay 38-4766 distinct benzimidazole
ribonucleosides, also offer explanation excellent specificity and
tolerability bay 38-4766, since mammalian dna undergo comparable
maturation steps.
