we aimed determine responses salivary secretory immunoglobulin (siga)
and incidence upper respiratory tract infections (urti) symptoms among
elite speed skaters actual competition period. subjects 8
international-class elite speed skaters. saliva samples obtained 3, 2, 1
days race, day race, 1 day race. salivary
secretory immunoglobulin concentration measured enzyme immunoassay, 
siga secretion rate calculated. visual analogue scale used to
subjectively assess fatigue tension. daily urti symptoms recorded by
using questionnaire. statistically significant difference the
saliva flow rate (p = 0.69), siga concentration (p = 0.07), subjective
fatigue (p = 0.07) competition period. siga secretion rate
recorded day race significantly high compared 3
and 2 days 1 day race (p < 0.05). subjective tension
recorded race day significantly high compared 3, 2, 
1 days race (p < 0.05). two subjects exhibited urti symptoms the
race. findings suggest salivary siga elite speed skaters increased 
after tapering period actual high-intensity speed skating race
decreased salivary siga elite speed skaters. data also suggest 
incidence urti symptoms might related siga level. coaches may need
to take precautions competitions minimize athletes' contact with
cold viruses adjust training load days competition improve
the decreased mucosal immune function.
