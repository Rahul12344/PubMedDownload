dendritic cells (dcs) genetically modified continually express present
antigens may potent physiologic adjuvants induction prophylactic or
therapeutic immunity. previously shown env nef deleted hiv-1 
vector (hiv-1 delta en) pseudotyped vsv-g transduced monocyte-derived
macrophages well cd34(+) precursors dcs. extended findings
with hiv-1 delta en highly differentiated human dcs derived culture from
circulating monocytes (dcs). addition, new vector derived hiv-1 delta
en deleted remaining accessory genes vif, vpr, vpu (hiv-1 
delta en v(3)) also tested. vectors efficiently transduced dcs.
transduction dcs significantly alter viability their
immunophenotype compared untransduced dcs. furthermore, phagocytic 
potential immature dcs, well ability differentiate mature 
dcs capable stimulating t-cell proliferation, affected. finally, dcs
transduced hiv-1 delta en vector able elicit primary antiviral
cytotoxic t-cell response autologous cd8 cells. results suggest that
hiv-1-based vectors expressing viral antigens may useful vivo active
immunization well ex vivo priming cytotoxic cells adoptive t-cell 
therapy. (blood. 2000;96:1327-1333)
