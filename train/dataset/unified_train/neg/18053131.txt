background: retroviral vectors valuable tools gene transfer. particularly
convenient ires-containing retroviral vectors expressing protein 
interest marker protein single bicistronic mrna. coupled
expression increases relevance tracking and/or selection transduced
cells based detection marker protein. pap2 retroviral vector
containing egfp downstream modified ires element emcv origin, cmv
enhancer-promoter instead u3 region 5'ltr, increases its
efficiency transient transfection. however, pap2 contains limited
multicloning site (mcs) shows weak egfp expression, previously led us
to engineer improved version, termed pprig, harboring: i) wild-type ecmv
ires sequence, thereby restoring full activity; ii) optimized mcs flanked 
by t7 sp6 sequences; iii) ha tag encoding sequence 5' mcs (pprig
haa/b/c).
results: convenience pprig makes good basic vector generate
additional derivatives extended range use. present several
novel pprig-based vectors (collectively referred prigs) : i) the
ha tag sequence inserted three reading frames 3' mcs (3'ha
prigs); ii) functional domain (er, vp16 krab) inserted either 5' 3'
of mcs (<< modular >> prigs); iii) egfp replaced either ecfp, eyfp,
mcherry puro-r (<< single color/resistance >> prigs); iv) mcherry, eyfp or
egfp inserted 5' mcs ires-egfp, ires-ecfp ires-puro-r
containing prigs, respectively (<< dual color/selection >> prigs). additionally, 
some prigs also constructed pmigr mscv background has
been widely used pluripotent cells.
conclusion: novel vectors allow straightforward detection any
expressed protein (3'ha prigs), functional studies chimeric proteins (<<
modular >> prigs), multiple transductions fluorescence analyses of
transduced cells (<< single color/resistance >> prigs), quantitative
detection studied proteins independently identified/selected transduced
cells (<< dual color/selection >> prigs). maintain original advantages
of pprig provide suitable tools either transient stable expression and
functional studies large range experimental settings.
