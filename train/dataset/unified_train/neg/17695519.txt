infectivity adenovirus type 5 (ad5) cells depends primarily its
fiber-mediated binding coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor (car) on
target cells. down-regulated car expression, often found human tumors,
hampered ad5-mediated gene transfer. ad 11 ad 35, belonging subtype b
group, use cd46 cellular receptors; accordingly, chimeric ad5 whose
fiber structure substituted type 11 35 (ad5/11 ad5/35)
could infect human cells different manner ad5. found ad5/35
infected human tumors, including pancreatic breast cancer, human
fibroblasts better ad5 ad5/11. infectivity ad5/35 cells 
correlated ad5/11, efficacy ad5/35- ad5/11-mediated
transduction directly correlated expression level cd46 the
target cells. infection human hepatoma cells measles virus, whose
cellular receptor cd46, down-regulated cd46 expression reduced
subsequent infectivity ad5/35 ad5/11. infection ad5 suppressed
subsequent gene transfer ad5 ad5/11 orad5/35. likewise infection of
ad5/35 decreased following gene transduction ad5/35 ad5/11, a
lesser extent ad5. data collectively showed combinatory use ad5 
and chimeric ad enables dual gene transfer target cells suggest that
infectivity subtype b ad completely depend cd46 expression and
that receptors possibly influence infectivity.
