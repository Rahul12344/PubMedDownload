e1 e2 two hepatitis c viral envelope glycoproteins assemble a
heterodimer essential membrane fusion penetration target
cell. extracellular transmembrane (tm) glycoprotein domains contribute
to interaction, study tm-tm interactions limited because
synthesis structural characterization highly hydrophobic segments
present significant challenges. nmr study, successful expression and
purification e2 transmembrane domain fusion construct have
determined global fold characterized backbone motions peptide
incorporated phospholipid micelles. backbone resonance frequencies, relaxation
rates solvent exposure measurements concur showing domain adopt 
helical conformation, two helical segments spanning residues 717-726 and
732-746 connected unstructured linker containing charged residues d728 
and r730 involved e1 binding. although linker exhibits increased local
motions ps timescale, dominating contribution relaxation the
global tumbling motion estimated correlation time 12.3ns. the
positioning helix-linker-helix architecture within mixed micelle was
established paramagnetic nmr spectroscopy phospholipid-peptide cross
relaxation measurements. indicate helices traverse the
hydrophobic interior micelle, linker lies closer micelle
perimeter accommodate charged residues. results lay groundwork
for structure determination e1/e2 complex molecular understanding of
glycoprotein heterodimerization.
