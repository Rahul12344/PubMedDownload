non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness defined increased
responsiveness respiratory airways physical, chemical and
pharmacological stimuli. characteristic feature asthma. knowledge of
the mechanisms contributing bronchial hyperresponsiveness provide an
insight pathogenesis asthma could lead improved therapy.
several abnormalities postulated underlie hyperresponsiveness,
such beta-adrenoceptor dysfunction, hyperreactivity airway smooth muscle,
epithelial dysfunction damage, increased reflex bronchoconstriction, mucus
plugging mucosal oedema. possible one these
abnormalities other, yet unknown, mechanisms involved. contrast to
the role lymphocytes regulation ige antibody production, role of
these cells bronchial hyperresponsiveness received little attention. we
review evidence indicating lymphocytes involved development of
non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness animal models patients 
with asthma.
