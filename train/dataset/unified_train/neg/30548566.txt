large excitatory synapses found specific points neuronal circuits
of auditory brainstem, enable fast information transfer the
preservation acoustic timing information. extracellular cues signaling
mechanisms lead development specialized synaptic
connections, exemplified calyx held medial nucleus the
trapezoid body (mntb), still largely unknown. here, investigate role
of bmp signaling early development ventral cochlear nucleus (vcn) 
and mntb, initial formation calyx held synaptic connection.
we used conditional alleles two bmp type-1 receptors background a
constitutive bmpr1b knock-out (ko), else conditional allele smad4. the
conditional alleles recombined krox20cre mouse line active
around mid-gestation rhombomeres (r) 3 5 vcn mntb are
derived; alternatively, virus-mediated cre-expression performed early
postnatally vcn. data show embryonic smad-dependent bmp-signaling
in r3 r5 contributes histogenesis auditory brainstem nuclei. the
other hand, bmp-receptor signaling early postnatally presynaptic neurons of
the calyx held projection necessary correct axon branch retraction,
which suggests cell-autonomous role presynaptic bmp-receptors synapse
elimination developing calyx held. thus, work dissects
developmentally early late roles bmp-signaling formation of
auditory brainstem nuclei, highly specialized synaptic connectivity in
these structures.
