the objective present study demonstrate usefulness of
recombinant adenoviral vector generation monoclonal antibodies (mab)
against natural epitopes proteins using glycoprotein gc pseudorabies
virus (prv) target antigen. recombinant adenovirus expressing the
glycoprotein gc (ad-gc) constructed according admax method. three
immunization protocols consisting various combinations intramuscular
injection ad-gc plasmid dna expressing gc (pcdna-gc) conducted in
balb/c mice 2-week intervals. two groups highest antibody levels 
(ad-gc/ad-gc pcdna-gc/pcdna-gc/ad-gc) selected fusion following a
final protein boost. nine mabs glycoprotein gc prv were
subsequently developed characterized isotypes igg1, igg2a, igg2b
with ascitic titers ranging 1:2 x 10(5) 1:5 x 10(6). immunofluorescence
assay (ifa) western blotting analysis confirmed mabs could
recognize linear epitopes glycoprotein gc prv. results provide a
new strategy preparation specific mab viral protein.
