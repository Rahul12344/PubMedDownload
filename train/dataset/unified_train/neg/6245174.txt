high multiplicity, undiluted passage equine herpesvirus type 1 (ehv-1) l-m 
cells resulted rapid production virus particles whose genome was
genetically less complex, contained reiterated dna sequences exhibited a
greater buoyant density (rho = 1.724 g/ml) dna (rho = 1.716 g/ml) of
standard virus. data finding particles inhibited the
replication standard virus interference assays confirmed were
defective interfering (di) particles (henry et al. 1979). additional evidence for
this obtained pattern cyclic fluctuation infectious virus
titre 17 serial passages well pronounced variation 
particle plaque ratio passage. total particle production markedly
reduced cells infected virus preparations containing di particles and
quantification major cell-associated ehv-1 capsid species electron
microscopy analysis renografin density gradients indicated this
reduction occurred level capsid assembly. although total capsid
production reduced cells infected di particle preparations, the
synthesis (immature) capsids increased relative l (empty) capsids
and alterations assembly capsid species could related to
changes synthesis capsid proteins. cells infected ehv-1
preparations rich di particles, synthesis major capsid protein 150000
was greatly reduced, whereas core protein 46000, major component capsids, 
was overproduced compared standard virus infection. capsids produced in
cells infected virus preparations rich di particles identical in
polypeptide composition made standard virus infection.
