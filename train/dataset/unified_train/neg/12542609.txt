aim: aim study investigate efficacy specific hepatitis 
b virus (hbv) vaccination active immunotherapy treating chronic hepatitis b
(chb) infection immune-tolerant phase children normal
aminotransferase levels high viral load.
methods: fifty-one immunotolerant patients randomly prospectively
recruited two groups. group 1 included 23 patients vaccinated with
three standard injections genhevac b vaccine deltoid quadricep
muscle, initially, 30 days 60 days, specific immunization. group 2
contained 28 patients receive medication vaccination 
recruited control group. post-vaccination evaluation performed 6
months first injection end 12th month serological
and virological analyses. response criterion therapy defined loss 
hbv-dna serum hepatitis b early antigen (hbeag) seroconversion (loss of
hbeag, development antibody hbeag (anti-hbe)).
results: mean alanine aminotransferase (alt) value group 1 the
beginning vaccination 33.6 +/- 8.1 iu/l; changed 31.7 +/- 9.0 
iu/l 6 months first injection 29.2 +/- 7.1 iu/l end 12
months (p > 0.05). group, mean hbv-dna load starting point 
vaccination 3,709 +/- 1,126 pg/ml; value changed 3,569 +/- 726 pg/ml 
at sixth month 3,295 +/- 832 pg/ml 12th month (p > 0.05). group
2, mean alt values beginning therapy, 6th 12th month
were 32 +/- 8 iu/l, 31.8 +/- 8 iu/l, 29.7 +/- 7 iu/l, respectively (p >
0.05), mean viral load hbv-dna values 3,827 +/- 1,375 pg/ml,
3,498 +/- 886 pg/ml, 3,059 +/- 731 pg/ml, respectively (p > 0.05). load
of hbv dna patients groups greater 2,000 pg/ml. was
no statistically significant difference mean alt values mean viral
load hbv dna (p > 0.05) group 1 group 2 end 6th 
12th months. except one patient group, hepatitis b surface
antigen (hbsag) hbeag clearance antibody hbsag (anti-hbs) anti-hbe 
seroconversion observed follow-up period (p > 0.05).
conclusion: study, comparison vaccinated unvaccinated groups of
immunotolerant children chb infection showed difference clearance 
of hbv dna seroconversion hbeag anti-hbe. different immunization
protocols considered future investigations immunotolerant
phase children chb infection.
