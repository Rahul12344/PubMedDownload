objective: understand status coxsackievirus b (cvb) infection senior
subjects explore association infection cardiovascular
diseases.
method: means elisa rt-pcr, cvb igg antibody nucleic acid were
detected 172 patients cardiopathy 58 control subjects.
results: positivity rate cvb igg antibody 43.61% (75/172) the
patient group 15.52% (9/58) control group, showing obvious difference 
between two groups. cvb rna tests revealed cvb rna-positivity rate of
20.93% (36/172) former group 3.45% (2/58) latter, also a
