objective: kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) gamma-herpesvirus 
implicated development kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma 
some forms multicentric castleman's disease. kshv open reading frame (orf)
36 encodes viral serine/threonine protein kinase. aim study 
characterize cellular function orf36 protein.
methods: expression kinetics orf36 protein localization were
determined. wild-type orf36 mutant proteins subjected in
vitro kinase assay. cell morphology change orf36 protein studied. the
focal adhesion kinase (fak) tyrosine phosphorylation cleavage determined
when orf36 expressed.
results: orf36 protein expressed late phase kshv reactivation. 
the c-terminal domain orf36 protein important kinase activity.
moreover, orf36 protein altered cell morphology round shape, similar 
the phenotype fak-deficient cells. kinase activity orf36 protein was
required inhibition cell spreading. interestingly, orf36 protein
colocalized fak, suppressed tyrosine phosphorylation promoted fak
cleavage.
conclusion: results collectively demonstrate kshv orf36 protein a
viral protein kinase inhibits cell spreading fak activation.
