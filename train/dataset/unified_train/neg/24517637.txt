a large acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (ahc) outbreak occurred 2011 in
okinawa prefecture japan. ten strains coxsackievirus group type 24
variant (ca24v) isolated patients ahc full sequence analysis
of vp3, vp1, 3c(pro) 3d(pol) coding regions performed. assess
time-scale evolution, phylogenetic analysis performed using bayesian
markov chain monte carlo method. addition, similarity plots constructed
and pairwise distance (p-distance) positive pressure analyses performed. a
phylogenetic tree based vp1 coding region showed present strains 
belong genotype 4 (g4). addition, present strains could divided in
about 2010 lineages detected countries china,
india australia. mean rates molecular evolution four coding regions
were estimated 6.15 7.86 × 10(-3) substitutions/site/year. similarity
plot analyses suggested nucleotide similarities present strains 
and prototype strain (eh24/70 strain) 0.77-0.94. p-distance the
present strains relatively short (<0.01). one positive selected site
(l25h) identified vp1 protein. findings suggest present
ca24v strains causing ahc genetically related ahc strains rapid
evolution emerged around 2010.
