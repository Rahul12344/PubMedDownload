proteolytic processing human plasminogen generates potent antiangiogenic
peptides angiostatin. plasminogen kringle 5 (k5) domain, is
distinct angiostatin, possesses potent antiangiogenic properties own,
which exploited cancer therapy. recently observed that
antiangiogenic agents promote leukocyte-vessel wall interaction part 
antitumor effect. although previously shown k5 suppresses cancer
growth tumor xenograft models, modulation inflammation experimental 
mice intact immune systems unknown. determine whether k5 possesses
immune proinflammatory properties, investigated effects k5 immune
competent model breast cancer observed tumor rejection is
substantially reduced nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient and
balb/c nude compared wild-type balb/c mice, suggesting important
role t-lymphoid cells antitumor effect k5. tumor explant analysis
shows k5 enhances tumor recruitment cd3(+) lymphoid cells, particular,
the nkt phenotype. also observed significant decrease tumor-associated
microvessel length density consistent antiangiogenic activity.
histologic analysis k5 tumors also revealed robust neutrophilic infiltrate, 
which may explained neutrophil chemotactic activity k5 well as
its ability promote cd64 up-regulation within cd11b(+) adhesive neutrophil
population. sum, findings confirm k5 protein acts potent
angiostatic agent possesses novel proinflammatory role via ability to
recruit tumor-associated neutrophils nkt lymphocytes, leading potent
antitumor response.
