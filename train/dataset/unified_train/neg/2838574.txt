the dna sequence clustered set genes conserved in
orthopoxviruses determined avipoxvirus, fowlpox virus. the
arrangement genes fowlpox virus nearly identical vaccinia
virus, genes overlapping vaccinia virus overlap fowlpox
virus. one major difference exists however, thymidine kinase (tk) gene 
absent fowlpox virus position occupies within cluster of
genes vaccinia virus. instead, fowlpox virus 32 bp non-coding
region present genes flank tk gene vaccinia virus. the
fowlpox virus tk gene cloned sequenced. sequences immediately
flanking tk gene show homology previously reported poxvirus gene.
these results discussed terms genome stability poxviruses the
use tk gene non-essential region introduction foreign
genes poxviruses.
