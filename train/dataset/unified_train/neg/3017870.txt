malignant lymphoma.

a herpesvirus (rhebv) isolated lymphoblastoid cell line (lcl) that
became established malignant lymphoma rhesus monkey. predominant 
cell marker lcl b lymphocytes. rhebv-induced viral capsid
(vca) nuclear antigens (na) lcl serologically related similar 
antigens known induced human epstein-barr virus (ebv). rhebv of
nonhuman primate origin clearly differentiated ebv the
anti-complement immunofluorescence reaction using human non-human primate
sera antibodies na induced respective viruses. human
sera reacted na induced ebv rhebv, monkey sera failed to
recognize na induced ebv. rhebv-induced na present nearly the
cells suspension prepared tumor tissue mass, the
monolayer fibroblasts derived tumor tissue blood and
lymph-node lymphocytes clinically healthy animals. rhebv induced vitro
transformation establishment lcls peripheral blood lymphocytes of
normal rhesus cynomolgus monkeys 6 non-human
primate species tested. lcls, predominant b-lymphocyte markers,
established treatment rhebv, evidence virus infection
since nearly cells culture expressed virus-induced na.
