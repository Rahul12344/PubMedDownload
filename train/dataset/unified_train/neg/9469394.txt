objective: test hypothesis children experiencing first febrile
seizures caused human herpesvirus 6 (hhv-6) increased risk for
recurrent seizures compared children experiencing first febrile
seizures attributed illnesses.
design participants: descriptive prospective study 36 hhv-6
culture-positive children matched subgroup 86 hhv-6 culture-negative
children, first febrile seizures evaluated tertiary
care emergency department followed least 12 months, an
average follow-up 35.7 months.
primary outcome measure: recurrence seizures among hhv-6 culture-positive 
and hhv-6 culture-negative children known previous neurologic deficits.
results: decreased incidence recurrent seizures occurred children whose
first febrile seizures caused hhv-6. twenty percent hhv-6
culture-positive children 40% hhv-6 culture-negative children (p < 0.038) 
experienced recurrent seizure within 1 year first febrile seizure. the
mean time recurrence within 12 months 8.6 months children hhv-6
infection 3.8 months (p < 0.001) children without hhv-6 infection. most
recurrent seizures occurred within 12 months first febrile seizure 
hhv-6-positive hhv-6-negative children (88 91%).
conclusions: children first febrile seizures caused primary
hhv-6 infection demonstrate increased risk recurrent seizures when
compared children whose first febrile seizures etiologies.
