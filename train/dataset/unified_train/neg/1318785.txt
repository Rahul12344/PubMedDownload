the generation infectious defective interfering (di) particles vesicular
stomatitis virus (vsv) entirely cdna clones reported. bacteriophage t7
rna polymerase used direct transcription complete
negative-stranded genomic rna cdna clone vsv di rna cells
simultaneously expressing five vsv proteins separately transfected cdna 
clones. negative-stranded transcript encapsidated n protein,
replicated vsv polymerase, replicated rnas assembled and
budded yield infectious di virions. helper vsv required. replication
occurred high levels assayed direct biochemical means. exact 3' 
terminus initial transcript, generated autolytic cleavage
using ribozyme hepatitis delta virus, critical replication.
