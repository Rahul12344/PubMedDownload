phylogeographical partitioning sin nombre monongahela viruses
(hantaviruses) may reflect primary rodent host, deer mouse
(peromyscus maniculatus). lack comprehensive assessment phylogeographical
variation host precluded possibility predicting spatial limits 
of existing strains viruses geographical regions novel viral
strains might emerge. complete cytochrome b gene sequenced 206 deer
mice collected sites throughout north america provide foundation for
future studies spatial structure evolution ubiquitous host.
bayesian analyses sequences partitioned deer mice six largely
allopatric lineages, may represent unrecognized species. the
geographical distributions lineages probably shaped quaternary
climatic events. populations mice apparently restricted refugia during
glacial advances, experienced genetic divergence. expansion these
populations, following climatic amelioration, brought genetically distinctive
forms contact. occurrence parallel changes virus strains be
explored appropriate regions. new mexico, example, near location
where sin nombre virus first discovered, three genetically
distinctive lineages deer mice whose geographical ranges need delineated
precisely. phylogeography p. maniculatus provides framework for
interpreting geographical variability, hosts, also associated 
viral variants disease transmission, opportunity predict the
potential geographical distribution newly emerging viral strains.
