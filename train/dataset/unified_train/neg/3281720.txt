we used panel reagents, polyclonal monoclonal antibodies, lectins to
define expression abh- lewis-related specificities platelets
and lymphocytes. also determined expression alpha 2- alpha
3-l-fucosyltransferases necessary biosynthesis. antigens could
be detected immunofluorescence western blot analysis based type 2 
monofucosylated structures. antibodies directed toward types 1, 3, 4 abh-, x-
and lewis-related antigenic determinants always negative small
amounts abh lewis antigens adsorbed serum could detected
by techniques. presence type 2 abh antigens intrinsic
glycoproteins controlled h gene. correlates presence 
alpha 2-l-fucosyltransferase absence alpha 3-l-fucosyltransferase on
platelets. contrast, abh antigens detected immunofluorescence on
normal peripheral lymphocytes. cells thus small amounts of
antigens adsorbed serum, control secretor and
lewis genes. correlates absence alpha 2-l-fucosyltransferase 
lymphocytes. lymphocytes transformed vitro epstein-barr virus
(ebv), however, strongly expressed x sialylated x antigens, which
are specific markers normal granulocytes monocytes, respectively.
treatment ebv-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines with
12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-o-acetate significantly decreased expression 
x sialylated x antigens along surface immunoglobulins, whereas
it induced significant expression h antigen control h gene.
