to diagnose possible cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection 64-year-old man after
renal transplantation, polymerase chain reaction (pcr), pp65 antigenaemia assay
(paa) virus isolation cell culture routinely performed weekly
basis. pcr obtained virus dna peripheral blood lymphocytes first
time fifth week. two weeks later patient complained feeling unwell 
with abdominal pain vomiting eating. two days later developed fever
up 38 degrees c nocturnal sweats. gastroscopy revealed marked antral
gastritis histologically showed typical cytomegalic "owl-eye" cells. the
paa clearly positive cell culture started fifth week now
showed cytopathogenic effect. cmv gastritic diagnosed treatment
consisted 175 mg ganciclovir intravenously twice daily 10 days. became 
symptom-free two days. side effects thrombocytopenia 
67,000/microliters rise transaminase activities, changes regressed
later. ensure early diagnosis treatment cmv infection, specific
virus diagnostic tests routinely undertaken transplantation of
organs cmv-positive persons cmv-negative patients.
