we determined rantes (regulated activation, normal cell expressed and
secreted) interleukin-8 (il-8) concentrations, total white blood cell
(wbc) differential counts nasal wash samples rhinovirus-infected
infants presenting wheezing acute upper respiratory illness alone and
compared healthy infants. rantes concentrations were
significantly greater acute samples wheezy patients from
patients acute upper respiratory illness only, control samples. il-8
concentrations wbc neutrophil counts significantly greater acute 
samples wheezy infants patients upper respiratory illness alone
than control samples, differ significantly 2
patient groups.
