in companion paper (d. ostertag, t. m. hoblitzell-ostertag, j. perrault, j.
virol. 81:492-502, 2007), provided indirect evidence cell-type-specific
growth restriction vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) polr mutants may be
due enhanced production double-stranded rna (dsrna). show polr
growth mouse l-929 cells rescued vaccinia virus coinfection that
sole expression vaccinia virus dsrna-binding e3l protein, via coinfection 
with engineered vsv minigenome, also restored polr growth. expression of
dsrna-binding protein ns1a ns1b influenza virus, c protein from
sendai virus, bind dsrna, likewise effected polr rescue. the
n-terminal dsrna-binding domain ns1a, 73 amino acids length, a
full-size mutant ns1a lacking dsrna-binding activity, restored polr growth. 
key aspects polr growth restriction, namely inhibition genome replication
and release low-infectivity virus particles, countered expression of
the dsrna-binding proteins. tested effects overproducing dsrna in
wild-type vsv infections coinfecting cells vsv recombinant expressing
the sense strand enhanced green fluorescent protein gene (vsv-gfp) one
expressing antisense strand (vsv-pfg). coinfections mimicked all
aspects polr restriction, including host range, lack effect on
transcription, reduced virus particle infectivity, insensitivity to
inhibition host gene transcription dsrna-activated protein kinase activity.
we conclude that, cell types, overproduction dsrna vsv
infection triggers immediate constitutive host cell antiviral effector
response independent interferon induction signaling.
