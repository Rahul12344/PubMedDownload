reverse transcription, quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) sensitive method for
quantification specific rna targets, first step assay, reverse 
transcription, notoriously variable sensitive reaction conditions. in
this study, used purified bacteriophage ms2 genomic rna model virus
target test two different rt enzymes (superscript ii superscript iii), two
rt-priming strategies (gene-specific primers random hexamers), varying
background rna concentrations (0-50ngμl-1) determine variables
influence efficiency reverse transcription range target
concentrations (101-107 copies μl-1). efficiency rt reaction was
greatly improved increasing background rna primer concentrations, but
the benefit provided background rna source dependent. given target
concentration, similar rt efficiencies achieved gene-specific primers
and random hexamers, latter required much higher concentrations. with
random hexamers, observed systematic variation rt reaction efficiency 
a function target concentration. using rna standard curve also
subject rt effectively normalized systematic variability, the
assay accuracy depended critically length standard rna extending to
the 3' end qpcr target site. results shed light previous
contradictory conclusions literature, provide insights may aid in
the design rt-qpcr assays design synthetic rna standards when
full-length material available.
