modern oncotherapy approaches based inducing controlled apoptosis tumor
cells. although number apoptosis-induction approaches available,
site-specific delivery therapeutic agents still remain biggest hurdle in
achieving desired cancer treatment benefit. additionally, systemic
treatment-induced toxicity remains major limiting factor chemotherapy. to
specifically address drug-accessibility chemotherapy side effects, oncolytic 
virotherapy (ov) emerged novel cancer treatment alternative. ov,
recombinant viruses higher replication capacity stronger lytic
properties considered tumor cell-targeting subsequent cell
lysing. successful application ovs lies achieving strict tumor-specific
tropism called oncotropism, contingent upon biophysical interactions
of tumor cell surface receptors viral receptors subsequent replication
of oncolytic viruses cancer cells. direction, viral vector
platforms developed entered
pre-clinical/clinical trials. among these, vesicular stomatitis virus
(vsv)-based platform shows high promise, pathogenic humans.
further, modern molecular biology techniques reverse genetics tools 
favorably advanced field creating efficient recombinant vsvs ov; some
have entered clinical trials. review, discuss current status 
of vsv based oncotherapy, challenges, future perspectives regarding its
therapeutic applications cancer treatment.
