we recently described autoimmune, central nervous system disease,
multiple sclerosis (ms), genetically associated human endogenous
retroviral locus, herv-fc1, scandinavians. number dominant human genes
encoding factors restrict retrovirus replication known long 
time. today human restriction genes retroviruses include amongst others
trims, apobec3s, bst2 trexs. therefore looked role these
retroviral restriction genes ms using genetic epidemiology. report
that markers two trims, trim5 trim22 marker bst2, associated
statistically risk getting ms, markers near apobec3s 
trexs showed little effect. indicates two trims bst2
influence risk disease thus supports hypothesis viral
involvement.
