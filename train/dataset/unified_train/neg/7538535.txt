whether l-selectin-low (l-sel-lo) phenotype acutely stimulated cd8+ t
cells permanent characteristic long-term memory ctl precursors (p) is
addressed mice primed influenza virus murine parainfluenza
type 1 virus, sendai virus. cases, many splenic cd8+ ctlp
gradually lose predominantly l-sel-lo profile associated recently
generated ctlp populations. influenza-specific ctlp also tend revert 
the activated alpha 4-integrin-high resting alpha 4-integrin-low form. the
kinetics switch back "naive" l-sel-hi phenotype differs the
influenza sendai virus models, perhaps reflecting events occurring the
acute phases responses. return l-sel-hi due to
irreversible lymphocyte senescence, restimulation set the
inducing virus vitro causes cells become l-sel-lo. also,
despite time-related drift particular memory ctlp l-sel-hi
state, size total pool l-sel-lo cd8+ cells increases age.
