recent studies demonstrated, r/u5 region bovine leukemia virus
(blv) long terminal repeat (ltr) up-regulates virus promoter. also
known effect independent blv trans activator protein,
p34tax, encoded virus genome. deletions constructed r/u5
region localize sequences responsible effect. activity the
different constructs determined transient expression system. results
show 64 bp long sequence (called das), present 3 end r
region, involved activation. vivo results indicate das
could divided two independent overlapping elements (das1,2). sequence
comparison allows identification three conservative boxes these
elements. results suggest, boxes functional together. the
gel-shift assay das2, good agreement vivo data, demonstrates 
that full length element forms low mobility dna-protein complex.
