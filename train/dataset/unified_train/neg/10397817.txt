the trichoplusia ni bti-tn-5b1-4 (tn-5b1-4) insect cell line received
considerable attention host baculovirus expression vector system. in
the present study, suspension cultures used compare tn-5b1-4 cell
aggregates cells selected grow predominantly individual cells. no
significant difference found cell aggregates cells growing
predominantly individually regard cell growth rate, glucose consumption and
lactate accumulation, specific recombinant protein synthesis levels. in
addition, levels recombinant protein synthesis considerably higher
than produced commonly used spodoptera frugiperda sf-9 insect cell
line.
