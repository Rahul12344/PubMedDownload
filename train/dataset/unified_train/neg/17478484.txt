human papillomavirus (hpv) infection responsible development of
cervical cancer premalignant lesions women. virus-encoded oncogene
e6 promising target anti-hpv drug therapy. authors describe the
development homogenous screening assay inhibitors e6 interaction 
with cellular target, e6-associated protein (e6ap), based alphascreen 
technology. e6 protein expressed purified glutathione
s-transferase (gst) fusion protein, binding biotinylated e6ap
peptide monitored using gst-detecting acceptor beads coated either with
anti-gst antibody glutathione. optimization assay conditions, a
commercial library 3000 compounds screened inhibitors. active
compounds retested counterscreened e6/e6ap specificity using
biotinylated gst control protein. results obtained types of
gst-detecting reagents correlated well demonstrated great potential 
of newly developed glutathione-coated acceptor beads detection reagent
for gst fusion proteins.
