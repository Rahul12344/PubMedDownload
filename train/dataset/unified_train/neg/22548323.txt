the article summarises results 30 years research on
palmitoylation (s-acylation) viral proteins, post-translational attachment
of fatty acids cysteine residues integral peripheral membrane proteins.
analysing viral proteins important characterise cellular
pathogens also instrumental decipher palmitoylation machinery of
cells. comprehensive review describes methods identify s-acylated
proteins covers fundamental biochemistry palmitoylation: location 
of palmitoylation sites viral proteins, fatty acid species found in
s-acylated proteins, intracellular site palmitoylation enzymology 
of reaction. finally, functional consequences palmitoylation are
discussed regarding binding proteins membranes membrane rafts, entry 
enveloped viruses target cells spike-mediated membrane fusion well 
assembly release virus particles infected cells. topics are
described mainly palmitoylated proteins influenza virus, proteins of
other important pathogens, causative agents aids severe acute 
respiratory syndrome, model viruses discussed.
