six welsh mountain pony colts infected intranasally ab4 isolate 
ehv-1. clinical virological monitoring demonstrated mild upper respiratory
tract disease, nasal shedding virus establishment a
cell-associated viraemia. detailed pathological examination urogenital
tract performed post mortem days 4-9 post-infection (pi). ehv-1 was
isolated epididymis day 8 testis day 9 pi, viral
replication endothelial cells organs associated necrotizing
vasculitis thrombosis. productive viral infection germinal epithelium 
not observed. study, three welsh mountain pony stallions were
infected intranasally ab4, resulted mild upper respiratory
tract disease establishment cell-associated viraemia. semen samples 
were collected day 60 pi. two stallions showed decrease proportion
of morphologically normal sperm. significant numbers inflammatory cells were
observed sperm-rich fraction ejaculates collected one stallion
between days 16 28 pi; infectious virus recovered semen 
animal days 17 25 pi, cessation viraemia. affected
stallion appeared clinically normal period venereal ehv-1 shedding.
