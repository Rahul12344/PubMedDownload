hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection affects 170 million people worldwide and
is common blood-borne infection united states. standard treatment
with peginterferon alfa-ribavirin results low sustained virologic response
(svr) rates many patients, especially african-american, are
coinfected human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), liver cirrhosis.
because suboptimal svr rates, new direct-acting antiviral agents target
hcv viral replication steps development. boceprevir one novel
ns3/4a protease inhibitors recently approved u.s. food drug
administration. evaluated literature regarding boceprevir performing 
medline search (january 1996-july 2011) identify relevant clinical trials.
abstracts poster oral presentations hepatology hiv conferences
were also reviewed. potent anti-hcv activity seen clinical trials with
boceprevir studied hcv genotype 1-infected patients naïve
to experience hcv therapy. data boceprevir hiv-hcv-coinfected
patients currently lacking; however, initial data drug-drug interactions
between boceprevir antiretrovirals become available. resistance to
boceprevir evaluated trials well, although data needed in
this area. common adverse events boceprevir included anemia and
dysgeusia. based available data, boceprevir one promising novel
direct-acting antiviral agents likely reshape treatment patients
with hcv infection.
