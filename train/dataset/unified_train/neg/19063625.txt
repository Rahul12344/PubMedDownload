atomic force microscopy (afm) provides unique capability image
high-resolution architecture structural dynamics pathogens (e.g., viruses,
bacteria, bacterial spores) near-molecular resolution native
conditions. development atomic force microscopy enable the
correlation pathogen protein surface structures specific gene products is
essential understand mechanisms pathogen life cycle. applied 
afm-based immunolabeling technique proteomic mapping macromolecular
structures visualization binding antibodies, conjugated
with nanogold particles, specific epitopes bacillus spore surfaces. this
information generated simultaneously acquiring surface morphology of
the pathogen. immunospecificity labeling method established
through utilization specific polyclonal monoclonal antibodies that
target spore coat exosporium epitopes bacillus atrophaeus bacillus
anthracis spores.
