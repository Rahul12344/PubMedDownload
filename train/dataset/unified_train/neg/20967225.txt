recently, demonstrated transcription factors hnf6 foxa2 function 
as key regulators human colorectal liver metastases. better understand
their proposed inhibitory crosstalk, consequences functional knockdown 
foxa2 hnf6 c/ebpα activity investigated human colon caco-2 and
hepg2 carcinoma cell lines. specifically, sirna-mediated gene silencing foxa2 
repressed transcript expression >80%. resulted statistically
significant 6-, 3-, 4-, 8-fold increase mrna expression hnf6 of
genes targeted transcription factor, e.g., hsp105b, cyp51, c/ebpα, as
determined qrt-pcr. thus, functional knockdown foxa2 recovered hnf6
activity. furthermore, nuclear extracts caco-2 cells hnf6 dna binding 
was observed, expression hnf1α, foxa2, foxa3, hnf4α protein was
abundant. therefore transfected plasmid encoding hnf6 caco-2 cells 
also employed retroviral vector transfect hnf6 hepg2 cells. this
resulted hnf6 protein expression dna binding activity recovered 
determined emsa band shift assays. furthermore, flow cytometry the
consequences hnf6 expression cell cycle regulation transfected cells was
studied. essentially, hnf6 inhibited cell cycle progression g2/m g1
phase caco-2 hepg2 cell lines, respectively. here, proliferation was
reduced 80% 50% caco-2 hepg2 cells, respectively, determined 
the brdu labeling assay. therefore functional knockdown foxa2 recovered hnf6
activity inhibited growth tumor-cells may possibly represent novel
therapeutic target primary secondary liver malignancies.
