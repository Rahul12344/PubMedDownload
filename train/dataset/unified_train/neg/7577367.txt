several transcription regulatory elements interact cellular dna-binding
proteins identified hiv-1 long terminal repeat (ltr). have
identified two sequence motifs u3 region ltr similar to
the consensus 9-bp dna-binding element ccaat/enhancer-binding protein
(c/ebp) family transcription factors. one sequences (promoter-proximal)
mapped immediately upstream nf-kappa b element, whereas other
(promoter-distal) completely overlapped upstream stimulatory factor (usf)
binding site. study, investigated role enhancer-proximal
consensus c/ebp binding sequence expression hiv-1 ltr. in
cotransfection assays found although sequence functional
c/ebp-responsive element, regulation hiv promoter c/ebp very
complex. c/ebp isoforms inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(pma)-stimulated hiv-1 promoter activity human glioblastoma u138mg and
neuroblastoma shsy5y cells, hela epithelial cells, inhibition
required nf-kappa b element. c/ebp also downregulated hiv nf-kappa b
element-containing sv40 early promoter activity, regardless presence of
the flanking c/ebp-binding sequences, two brain-derived cells. in
electrophoretic mobility shift assays nuclear extracts hela u138mg 
cells, purified c/ebp markedly increased complex formation endogenous
proteins nf-kappa b dna probe without detectable association the
complex. however, extracts u138mg cells hela cells, slow
migrating complex observed. data suggest c/ebp family of
transcription factors downregulate hiv-1 promoter activity cns-derived
cells nf-kappa b binding elements.
