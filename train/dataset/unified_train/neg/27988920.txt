objective: viral infections sensitization aeroallergens major factors 
in exacerbation asthma development early childhood.
however, cytokine profiles eosinophil activation status linked the
association viral infections sensitization aeroallergens are
incompletely understood. investigated respiratory viruses, serum
eosinophil cationic protein (ecp), various cytokines/chemokines acute
exacerbation childhood asthma.
methods: analyzed peripheral eosinophil counts, serum ecp, 27
cytokines/chemokines 76 virus-induced acute asthma cases without
aeroallergen sensitization. asthma due sensitization defined positive
reaction least one aeroallergen serum specific ige antibody tests. virus
detection performed using antigen detection kits and/or rt-pcr, followed by
direct dna sequencing analysis. serum cytokines/chemokines measured using 
multi-cytokine detection system.
results: peripheral eosinophil counts serum ecp il-5 levels were
significantly elevated sensitized cases compared nonsensitized cases.
conversely, ip-10 values significantly higher nonsensitized cases. an
inverse correlation ip-10 il-5 production identified in
virus-induced acute exacerbations asthma controls.
conclusions: cytokine profiles eosinophil activation status might be
different sensitized nonsensitized cases virus-induced acute
exacerbations asthma.
