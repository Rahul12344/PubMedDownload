background: circulating cell-free dna (cfdna) proposed latent biomarker 
several cancers, including liver cancer. deoxyribonucleases (dnases) facilitate
the timely efficient degradation cfdna, leading us hypothesize that
dnase and/or ii might sensitive early biomarker cfdna. test
this hypothesis, study conducted large, prospective cohort.
methods: nested case-control study (224 liver cancer case patients 224
matched control subjects) conducted cohort finnish male smokers,
followed baseline (1985-1988) 2014. associations among dnase i
activity, cfdna, risk liver cancer assessed using
multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic regression.
results: dnase activity, whether measured radius (mm) units per
milliliter, statistically significantly associated increased risk of
liver cancer (p trend <.01). dnase activity highest quartile was
associated greater threefold risk developing liver cancer (dnase i
activity radius >2.7 mm, hazard ratio [hr] = 3.03, 95% confidence interval [ci] =
1.59 5.77; dnase activity >2.72 units/ml, hr = 3.30, 95% ci = 1.64 6.65).
the strength association substantially altered exclusion of
cases diagnosed within first five years follow-up hepatitis 
c virus (hcv) infection. contrast, cfdna dnase ii statistically
significantly associated risk liver cancer.
conclusions: dnase activity superior latent biomarker liver cancer
than cfdna. findings advance goal developing means detect liver
cancer years well development clinical manifestations.
