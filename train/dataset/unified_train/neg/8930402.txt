the human leukemia cell line k562 induced by
12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (tpa) differentiate along the
megakaryocytic pathway, generating morphological changes increased expression
of lineage-specific surface markers. report tpa-treated k562 cells also
express higher levels fli-1/ergb, member ets family transcription 
factors. furthermore, introduction retroviral construct expressing human
fli-1/ergb k562 cells induces changes similar seen following tpa
treatment, including increased adherence surface culture vessel and
altered size morphology. infected cells exhibit higher levels the
megakaryocyte marker cd41a and, lesser extent, cd49b. markers, well
as virally encoded fli-1/ergb-specific rna protein, expressed the
highest levels attached cell population, growth rate adherent
cells reduced, fraction cells g0-g1 increased. fli-1/ergb
virus-infected cells also exhibit increased expression hemoglobin, marker of
erythroid differentiation. results suggest fli-1/ergb plays role in
controlling differentiation gene expression along megakaryocyte/platelet 
pathway, implicate ets-related genes control multiple
developmentally regulated hematopoietic genes.
