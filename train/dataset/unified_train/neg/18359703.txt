objective: investigate efficacy transfection mutant ikappabalpha
gene (mikappabalpha) enhancing radiosensitivity hepatocellular
carcinoma cells.
methods: hepatocellular carcinoma hep g2 cells divided 3 group 
transfected adenovirus containing mikappabalpha vector (ad-mikappabalpha
group), ad vector (adv group), without treatment (parental control cells).
before irradiation cells 6 gy high-energy x ray, western
blotting performed measure expression level ikappabalpha the
cytoplasm, electrophoresis mobility shift assay (emsa) carried to
evaluate nuclear factor-kappab (nf- kappa;b) activity cell nuclei,
with cell apoptosis detected using tunel assay. radiosensitivity the
hepg2 cells determined comparison 3 groups term the
surviving cell fractions (sf2) 2-gy x-ray exposure, dq
values obtained using single-hit multi target model.
results: x-ray exposure, hep g2 cells adv group control
group showed low levels ikappabalpha absorbance cytoplasm, were
further decreased exposure. nf-kappab activity nuclei the
cells two groups positive (+) irradiation, substantially
enhanced (++) exposure maintained stably activated state. the
apoptotic index cells two groups 1.4 1.6 before
irradiation, increased 8.9 11.7 irradiation, respectively.
the cells ad-mikappabalpha group, however, exhibited high levels of
ikappabalpha absorbance either irradiation, were
approximately 3 times adv group, nf-kappab activity remained 
negative irrespective irradiation. apoptotic index cells the
ad-mikappabalpha group 18.2 irradiation, increased 88.3 after
the irradiation. among 3 groups, ad-mikappabalpha group smallest
sf(2) value 0.301 highest sensitivity enhancement ratio (ser) of2.99, 
with lowest dq values (1.468 0.709, respectively).
conclusion: mikappabalpha gene transfection hepg2 cells inhibits the
anti-apoptotic activity nf-kappab enhance radiosensitivity the
cells.
