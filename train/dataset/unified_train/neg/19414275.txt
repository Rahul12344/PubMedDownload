the important role bridge water molecule binding hiv-1 reverse
transcriptase (rt) inhibitor complex elucidated molecular dynamics (md)
simulations using mm-pbsa approach. binding free energies thermodynamic
property differences nevirapine bound wild type y181c hiv-1 reverse
transcriptase investigated, results compared available
experimental data. md simulations 3 ns revealed bridge water formed
three characteristic hydrogen bonds nevirapine two residues, his235 and
leu234, binding pocket. energetic derived model, determined 
from consecutive addition water molecule, confirmed the
contribution bridge water essential binding configuration.
including bridge water mm-pbsa calculations reoriented binding
energies -32.20 -37.65 kcal/mol -28.07 -29.82 kcal/mol wild
type y181c hiv-1 rt, respectively. attractive interactions via the
bridge water, his235 leu234 became major contributions. found the
bridge water key stabilizing bound complex; however, y181c
rt complex bridge water showed weaker hydrogen bond formation, lack of
attractive force nevirapine lack binding efficiency, leading the
failure nevirapine y181c hiv-1 rt. moreover, dynamics of
val179, tyr181cys, gly190 leu234 binding pocket showed additional
attractive energetic contributions helping nevirapine binding. findings 
that presence water molecule hydrophobic binding site plays an
important role step towards quantitative understanding character
of bridge water enzyme-inhibitor binding. helpful developing
designs novel non-nucleoside hiv-1 rt inhibitors active mutant
enzyme.
