detection hepatitis b virus (hbv) serological markers dried blood spot
(dbs) samples enzyme immunoassay (elisa) yet fully optimized. 
this study, ability detect three hbv markers (hbsag, anti-hbc, and
anti-hbs) evaluated dbs samples using modified commercial elisa. matched
serum dbs samples obtained individuals without past
history hbv infection. sera samples tested according the
manufacturer's instructions, dbs testing, paper diameters, elution
buffer, volume input sample, cut-off values evaluated optimize the
assay. stability studies done dbs stored 180 days at
different temperatures. absorbance values yielded maximum
sensitivity specificity determined based area roc curve
(auroc) chosen cut-off value. using parameter, sensitivity was
90.5%, 97.6%, 78% anti-hbc, hbsag, anti-hbs assays, respectively.
specificity 92.6%, 96.7%, 97.3% anti-hbc, hbsag, anti-hbs assays,
respectively. hbv markers could detected dbs samples 63 days after
sample collection temperatures, storage -20°c yielded more
consistent results. results indicate modified elisa used to
detect hbv markers dbs samples, particularly samples stored
appropriately.
