vp40, matrix protein marburg virus, peripheral membrane protein 
has shown associate membranes multivesicular bodies (mvbs) (l.
kolesnikova, h. bugany, h.-d. klenk, s. becker, j. virol. 76:1825-1838,
2002). present study revealed vp40 bound cellular membranes
rapidly synthesis. time course studies performed trace the
distribution vp40 course expression. first, vp40 was
homogenously distributed throughout cytoplasm, although majority of
protein (70%) already membrane associated. next, vp40 accumulated mvbs and
in tubular protrusions emerging mvbs. finally, vp40 appeared patch-like
pattern beneath plasma membrane. morphological results supported
by iodixanol density gradient analyses. majority vp40-positive membranes
were first detected comigrating small vesicles. vp40 shifted to
fractions containing endosomal marker proteins, later, fractions
containing plasma membrane marker proteins. blocking protein synthesis use 
of cycloheximide time vp40 mainly associated small
vesicles prevent redistribution vp40 late endosomes and
further plasma membrane. inhibition intracellular vesicular
trafficking monensin significantly reduced appearance vp40 the
plasma membrane. conclusion, suggest transport marburg
virus matrix protein vp40 involves accumulation mvbs followed the
redistribution vp40-enriched membrane clusters plasma membrane.
