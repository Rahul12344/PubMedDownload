major histocompatibility complex class ii molecules encoded two common rhesus 
macaque alleles mamu-drb1*0406 mamu-drb*w201 purified, and
quantitative binding assays established. structural requirements
for peptide binding molecule characterized testing panels of
single-substitution analogs two previously defined epitopes hiv env242
(mamu-drb1*0406 restricted) hiv env482 (mamu-drb*w201 restricted). anchor
positions macaque dr molecules spaced following position 1 (p1),
p4, p6, p7, p9 pattern. specific binding motif associated each
molecule distinct, largely overlapping, based crucial roles of
aromatic and/or hydrophobic residues p1, p6, p9. based results, a
tentative mamu class ii dr supermotif defined. pattern remarkably
similar previously defined human hla-dr supermotif. similarities binding 
motifs human hla macaque mamu-dr molecules illustrated
by testing panel 60 different single-substitution analogs the
hla-dr-restricted ha 307-319 epitope binding mamu-drb*w201 and
hla-drb1*0101. mamu-drb1*0406 -drb*w201 binding capacity set 311 
overlapping peptides spanning entire simian immunodeficiency virus (siv)
genome also evaluated. ten peptides capable binding molecules were
identified, together 19 drb1*0406 43 drb*w201 selective binders. the
mamu-dr supermotif found present 75% good binders and
in 50% peptides binding intermediate affinity approximately
25% peptides bind either mamu class ii molecule. finally,
using flow cytometric detection antigen-induced intracellular gamma
interferon, identify new cd4(+) t-lymphocyte epitope encoded within rev 
protein siv.
