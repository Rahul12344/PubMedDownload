the replication protein (rep) gene tobacco curly shoot virus (tbcsv) y35
isolate obtained infected tobacco plants pcr cloned into
expression vector pgex-4t-1 generate recombinant plasmid pgex-y35rep. 
recombinant plasmid introduced escherichia coli strain bl21(de3) plys s,
and tbcsv rep fusion protein expressed induction iptg some
products soluble. rep fusion protein purified gst-sepharose 4b 
affinity chromatography polyclonal antibody produced rabbit.
studies subcellular distribution tbcsv rep protein infected tobacco
leaves revealed rep protein mainly exists fractions containing the
nucleus. immuno-gold labeling antibody rep fusion protein also
indicated rep protein localized nuclei infected tobacco cells.
