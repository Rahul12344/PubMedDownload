we used two-color flow cytometric analysis investigate cd26+ (ta1+) cells in
peripheral blood lymphocytes patients human t-lymphotropic virus
type-i (htlv-i)-associated myelopathy (ham). percentage cd26+ cells among 
cd3+ cells markedly increased patients ham, compared anti-htlv-i
seropositive carriers (p < 0.001) seronegative controls (p < 0.01). within
the subpopulation cells, significantly high percentage cd26+ cells 
detected cd4+ cd8+ cell populations. furthermore, analysis hla-dr+
t cells revealed similar results. contrast cd4+cd45ra+ cells were
significantly decreased comparison controls. results suggest that
immunologically activated memory cells found peripheral blood may be
etiologically relevant ham.
