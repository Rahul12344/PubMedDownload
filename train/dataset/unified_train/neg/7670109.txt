two unique dna fragments recently identified 90% acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (aids)-related kaposi's sarcoma tissues. sequence
analysis suggests fragments belong previously unidentified human 
herpesvirus, kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv). fragments have
also identified subset non-hodgkin's lymphomas human
immunodeficiency virus-positive patients; specifically, body cavity-based
lymphomas (aids-bcbls). established two cell lines derived from
aids-bcbls, bc-1 bc-2, retain kshv sequences, used to
further characterize putative viral genome. report, demonstrate
that kshv sequences represent portion much larger dna molecule is
located predominantly nucleus infected cells. situ hybridization
of metaphase spreads made cell lines show sequences in
episomal structures. presence cells large nuclear episomes
supports previous sequence homology data suggesting kshv belongs the
herpesvirus family. cell lines provide continuous source kshv
sequences. thus, represent important tool future studies this
recently described human herpesvirus may involved pathogenesis 
kaposi's sarcoma aids-related non-hodgkin's lymphomas.
