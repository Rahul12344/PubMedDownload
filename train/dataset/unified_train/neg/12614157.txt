the hiv-1 rev protein plays pivotal role viral replication, therefore,
inhibition function block progression virus-induced
immune deficiency syndrome (aids). here, rna molecules shown inhibit
import hiv-1 rev protein nuclei permeabilized cells. nuclear
uptake biotinylated recombinant his-tagged rev-gfp assessed nuclear
extracts digitonin-permeabilized cells binding either importin
beta-receptors nickel molecules immobilized microtiter plate. using 
method together fluorescence microscopy, determined nuclear import
of rev inhibited addition reticulocyte lysate routinely is
used source nuclear import receptors. inhibition released by
treatment rnase enzyme. also t-rna molecules oligoribonucleotide
rre iib, namely, second stem structure rev responsive element (rre) of
the viral rna, inhibit rev nuclear import. similar results obtained bsa
molecules covalently attached rev-arginine rich motif (arm) peptides were
used nuclear transport substrate, indicating nuclear import
inhibition rev protein due presence arm domain. binding
experiments revealed rna molecules inhibit interaction the
arm region importin beta, implying rna prevents formation the
import complex. implication results regulation nuclear 
import rev well use rna molecules antiviral drugs is
discussed.
