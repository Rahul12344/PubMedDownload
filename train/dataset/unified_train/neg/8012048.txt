the complete nucleotide sequence satellite virus st. augustine decline 
virus (ssadv) determined. comprises 824 nucleotides contains a
single, large open reading frame corresponds coat protein the
satellite virus, confirmed direct amino acid sequencing. genome
contains two potential open reading frames, similar organization 
satellite panicum mosaic virus (spmv). two satellite viruses share
significant sequence homology nucleotide amino acid levels;
there 36 nucleotide differences, resulting five amino acid changes. 
than close homology spmv, homology known satellite 
viruses nucleotide amino acid level, similarity 
the hydropathy profiles coat proteins viruses.
