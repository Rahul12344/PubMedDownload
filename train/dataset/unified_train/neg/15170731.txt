background: retroviral vectors possess many advantages use gene therapy
protocols, especially within haematopoietic system. number attendant
problems, however, still limit safety clinical application. effects 
of enhancer present retroviral long terminal repeat (ltr) major 
concern clinical usage vectors, exert powerful
regulatory influence genes surround them.
methods: improve safety widen applicability retroviral vectors 
for use gene therapy developed enhancer-deleted (delta-ltr)
retroviral vector retained high titre demonstrated transcriptional
activity myeloid cells.
results: used correct mouse model autosomal recessive chronic
granulomatous disease, delta-ltr vectors gave acceptable levels gene
transfer mouse bone marrow cells. evidence slight preferential
expression myeloid cells obtained vectors studied. nitroblue 
tetrazolium assay superoxide generation mouse bone marrow derived
haematopoietic colonies revealed transduction delta-ltr vectors could
restore functional nadph oxidase cells animals. superoxide assay of
peripheral blood confirmed that, although relatively low numbers cells were
transduced, delta-ltr vector capable reconstituting high levels
of oxidase activity, comparable obtained normal cells.
conclusions: delta-ltr vector described could provide basis a
new generation retroviral vectors improved safety.
