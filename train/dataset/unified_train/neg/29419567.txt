background: methamphetamine use increases risk hiv-1 infection among
seronegative users exacerbate disease progression hiv-positive users. 
the biological mechanisms underlying associations remain unclear. this
cross-sectional pilot study, examine associations recent
methamphetamine use inflammation rectal mucosa peripheral blood
compartments hiv-1 seropositive seronegative men sex men.
methods: hiv-seronegative hiv-seropositive men sex men
participants enrolled (n = 24). recent methamphetamine use determined by
urine drug screen. cytokines quantified using multiplex arrays from
collected plasma rectal sponge samples, peripheral blood t-cell
activation assessed flow cytometry.
results: methamphetamine use associated consistently increased rectal
inflammatory cytokines, specifically interleukin-6 tumor necrosis
factor-alpha, regardless hiv-1 serostatus pilot study. this
association significant adjusting age, hiv-serostatus, and
receptive anal intercourse frequency using regression analysis. similar increases
were uniformly observed peripheral blood.
conclusions: methamphetamine use associated increased local mucosal
inflammatory cytokine production. findings may help explain increased
hiv-1 risk seen methamphetamine users contribute increased inflammation
among hiv-seropositive users.
