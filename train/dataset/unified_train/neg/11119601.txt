hepadnaviruses replicate reverse transcription, takes place the
cytoplasm infected hepatocyte. viral rnas, including pregenome, are
transcribed covalently closed circular (ccc) viral dna found in
the nucleus. inhibitors viral reverse transcriptase block new dna
synthesis direct effect 50 copies cccdna that
maintain infected state. thus, antiviral therapy, rates loss of
cccdna, infected hepatocytes (1 molecules cccdna), replicating
dnas may quite different. present study, asked losses
compared woodchucks chronically infected woodchuck hepatitis virus were
treated l-fmau [1-(2-fluoro-5-methyl-beta-l-arabinofuranosyl) uracil], an
inhibitor viral dna synthesis. viremia suppressed least 8 months,
after drug-resistant virus began replicating high titers. addition,
replicating viral dnas virtually absent liver 6 weeks of
treatment. contrast, cccdna declined slowly, consistent half-life 
of approximately 33 50 days. loss cccdna comparable that
expected estimated death rate hepatocytes woodchucks,
suggesting death infected cells one major routes for
elimination cccdna. however, decline actual number infected
hepatocytes lagged behind decline cccdna, average cccdna copy 
number infected cells dropped early phase therapy. this
observation consistent possibility fraction cccdna 
distributed daughter cells infected hepatocytes passed through
mitosis.
