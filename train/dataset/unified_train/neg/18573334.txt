the chemokine receptor, ccr5, acts co-receptor human immunodeficiency
virus entry cells. ccr5 shown targeted cholesterol- and
sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains termed lipid rafts caveolae.
cholesterol essential ccl4 binding ccr5 keeping the
conformational integrity receptor. filipin treatment leads loss of
caveolin-1 membrane therefore collapse caveolae. have
found sequestration membrane cholesterol filipin affect
receptor signalling, however loss ligand-induced internalisation ccr5 was
observed. cholesterol extraction methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (mcd) reduced
signalling ccr5 measured release intracellular ca(2+) and
completely abolished inhibition forskolin-stimulated camp accumulation
with effect internalisation. pertussis toxin (ptx) treatment inhibited 
intracellular release calcium transduced via galphai g-proteins.
depletion cholesterol destroyed microdomains membrane switched
ccr5/g-protein coupling ptx-independent g-protein. conclude that
cholesterol membrane essential ccr5 signalling via galphai
g-protein subunit, integrity lipid rafts essential for
effective ccr5 internalisation however crucial proper ccr5 signal
transduction via galphai g-proteins.
