objective: aim study investigate relationship between
liver function test, serum hbeag, hbv dna level liver pathological changes in
patients chronic hepatitis b.
methods: 233 patients chronic hepatitis b accept liver puncture biopsy,
liver function test, hbeag detection hbv dna fluorescent quantitation pcr
detection. comparisons liver function test, hbeag hbv dna level were
conducted among different liver pathological changes including inflammation
grading fibrosis staging.
results: different inflammation grading groups, alt highest group g3
and lowest group g(0-1)(p = 0.016); tbil highest group g4 lowest in
group g(0-1) (p = 0.000); hbv dna level highest group g4 lowest in
group g(0-1), statistically significant among groups (p = 0.463). in
different fibrosis staging groups, alt highest group s3 lowest in
group s(0-1), statistically significant among groups (p = 0.562); tbil
was highest group s4 lowest group s2 (p = 0.039); hbv dna level was
highest group s3 lowest group s(0-1), statistically significant
among groups (p = 0.395). hbeag positive group,the proportion g(3-4) in
inflammation grading s(3-4) fibrosis staging lower hbeag
negative group (46% vs. 52%, p = 0.438; 38% vs. 53%, p = 0.025; respectively).
conclusion: hbv dna level indicate severity liver inflammation 
fibrosis chronic hbv infection. patients hbeag negative often are
complicated severity liver fibrosis. routine liver function test,
tbil level correlates liver inflammation grading fibrosis staging; alt
level also correlates liver inflammation grading fibrosis
staging.
