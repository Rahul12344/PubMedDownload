four proteins bacteriophage mb78 apparent molecular weights 35, 14, 
21 16 kda expressed 3.9 kb sali-hindiii fragment located almost in
the middle phage genome. analysis sequence supported some
experimental evidences suggest four proteins expressed from
polycistronic message without intercistronic gap. stop start codons of
consecutive orfs overlap rare initiation codons used. computer analysis
of sequence suggests presence two open reading frames within 
orfs 35 16 kda proteins opposite orientation, i.e. the
complementary strand.
