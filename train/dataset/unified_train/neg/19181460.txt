bowenoid situ squamous cell carcinoma (bisc) rare feline skin disorder,
which described often associated papillomavirus infection. is
clinically characterized solitary multiple hyperkeratotic plaques affecting
older cats. papillomavirus (pv) sequences amplified feline viral plaques,
and bisc lesions seldom correspond fdpv1. goal present study to
investigate three cases bisc carry initial genomic analysis 
associated viral dna. samples skin biopsies taken three bisc cats were
histologically characterized. dna extracted rolling-circle amplification 
was performed skin samples. restriction enzyme analysis amplified
dna revealed presence putative unknown pv. whole genome was
subsequently sequenced cloned. alignments previously described feline pv
sequences carried phylogenetic trees generated. circular
7,899 base pair sequence felis domesticus pv type 2 (fdpv2) contains typical
noncoding region characteristic open reading frames (orf) six putative
viral proteins. phylogenetic analysis based nucleotide alignment l1
genes amino acid alignment e1 proteins fdpv2 52 pv types
indicates fdpv2 might represent new genus.
