the matrix domain (ma) important targeting human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 gag assembly plasma membrane, envelope incorporation virions, 
preintegration complex import nucleus, nuclear export viral rna. 
myristylation phosphorylation key regulatory events function.
previous studies indicated phosphorylation serine (ser) residues 
is important viral replication. study defines molecular mechanisms
of virus particle assembly infectivity detailed study role
of serine phosphorylation. show combined mutation ser residues 
at positions 9, 67, 72, 77 impairs viral infectivity dividing and
nondividing cells, although assembly ser mutant viruses is
comparable wild-type virus. defect rescued pseudotyping
these mutant viruses vesicular stomatitis virus g protein, suggesting that
these serine residues critical early postentry step viral infection.
the phosphorylation level defective mutant viruses severely reduced 
compared wild type, suggesting phosphorylation ser-9, -67,
-72, -77 important early postentry step virus infection.
