nipah virus (niv), highly pathogenic paramyxovirus, causes respiratory disease 
in pigs severe febrile encephalitis humans high mortality rates. on
the basis structural similarity viral fusion (f) proteins within the
family paramyxoviridae, designed tested 18 quinolone derivatives niv 
and measles virus (mv) envelope protein-based fusion assay beside evaluation of
cytotoxicity. found five compounds successfully inhibiting niv envelope
protein-induced cell fusion. active molecules (19 20), also
inhibit syncytium formation induced infectious niv show low
cytotoxicity vero cells, represent promising lead quinolone-type compound
structure. molecular modeling indicated compound 19 fits well a
particular protein cavity present niv f protein important 
fusion process.
