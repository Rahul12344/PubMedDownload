measles virus (mv), member family paramyxoviridae, nonsegmented
negative-strand rna virus. rna helicases retinoic acid-inducible gene i
(rig-i) melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (mda5) differentially 
involved detection cytoplasmic viral rnas induction alpha/beta
interferon (ifn-alpha/beta). rig-i generally believed play major role 
the recognition paramyxoviruses, whereas many viruses family produce v
proteins inhibit mda5. determine individual roles mda5 and
rig-i ifn induction mv infection, small interfering rna-mediated
knockdown mda5 rig-i performed human epithelial cell line h358, 
which susceptible wild-type mv isolates. production ifn-beta mrna in
response mv infection greatly reduced rig-i knockdown clones compared
to h358 cells, confirming importance rig-i detection mv.
the ifn-beta mrna levels also moderately reduced mda5 knockdown clones,
even though clones retained fully functional rig-i. v protein-deficient
recombinant mv (mvdeltav) induced higher amounts ifn-beta mrna early
stage infection h358 cells compared parental virus. reductions
in ifn-beta mrna levels rig-i knockdown clones less pronounced 
infection mvdeltav infection parental virus. taken
together, present results indicate rig-i mda5 contribute the
recognition mv v protein promotes mv growth least partly by
inhibiting mda5-mediated ifn responses.
