background: introduction highly active antiretroviral therapy the
mid-1990s significantly reduced morbidities prolonged lifespan of
people living hiv. however, emergence resistance the
antiretroviral drugs becoming major cause treatment failure. the
problem drug resistance tackled developed countries, much seem
to done regard developing countries africa, asia latin
america. review looked regional distribution hiv groups and
subtypes affected pattern antiretroviral resistance.
methods: review sourced papers presented international
conferences hiv/aids rational drug use, relevant journals medline
search using keywords--antiretroviral drugs, drug resistance, hiv subtypes
and resistance testing.
results: types, groups, subtypes, sub-subtypes recombinant forms hiv-1
have identified according geographical distributions. evolution
of hiv viral mutations, process (es) involved development primary and
secondary antiretroviral drug resistance, including role hiv genetic
polymorphisms, transmitted resistance discussed.
conclusion: pitfalls current resistance testing based hiv-1 subtype
b highlighted. design resistance testing algorithm based on
hiv-1 subtype non-b suggested developing world.
