recent studies hodgkin's lymphoma (hl) indicated patients with
active disease display functional impairment ag-specific cd8+ cells due to
expansion regulatory cells sites disease peripheral blood. 
adoptive cellular immunotherapy based ebv-specific cd8+ cells been
explored limited success date. proposed improved
targeting cd8+ cells toward viral ags expressed hl may
enhance future therapeutic vaccine strategies. study, developed a
novel replication-deficient adenoviral ag presentation system designed to
encode glycine alanine repeat-deleted ebv nuclear ag 1 covalently linked to
multiple cd8+ cell epitopes latent membrane proteins 1 2. single
stimulation cd8+ cells healthy virus carriers, patients hl
with adenoviral construct combination il-2, sufficient to
reverse functional cell impairment restored ifn-gamma production
and cytolytic function. importantly, activated cd8+ cells responded 
to tumor cells expressing membrane proteins recognized novel ebna1 epitopes. 
flow cytometric analysis revealed large proportion cells expanded
from patients hl cd62l(high) cd27(high), ccr7(low), consistent 
with early mid effector cells. findings provide important platform 
for translation ag-specific adoptive immunotherapy treatment of
ebv-associated malignancies hl nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
