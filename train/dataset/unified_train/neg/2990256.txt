proteolytic release glycopeptides glycoproteins transferred to
nitrocellulose following gel electrophoresis.

dion as, pomenti aa.

to determine whether glycopeptides could released glycoproteins bound 
nitrocellulose, glycoproteins murine mammary tumor virus (mumtv) were
radiolabeled periodate oxidation/tritiated sodium borohydride reduction
technique separated gel electrophoresis followed diffusion transfer.
pronase digestion nitrocellulose filter strips containing labeled
glycoproteins (gp55 gp34) revealed rapid release glycopeptides, i.e.,
approximately total release within 4 h. released glycopeptides similar
in size, determined molecular sieving chromatography, glycopeptides
obtained proteolytic digestion mumtv glycoproteins dried gel strips

al., 1978, virology 91, 291-304).
