prion diseases associated accumulation abnormal isoform of
host-encoded prion protein (prp(sc)). number prion strains be
distinguished "glycotyping" analysis respective deposited prp(sc)
compound. study, long-term proteinase k resistance, molecular
mass, localization prp(sc) deposits derived conventional and
transgenic mice inoculated 11 different bse scrapie strains isolates 
were examined. differences found long-term proteinase k resistance
(50 microg/ml 37 degrees c) prp(sc). example, scrapie strain chandler
or prp(sc) derived field bse isolates destroyed 6 hr exposure,
whereas prp(sc) strains 87v me7 hessen1 isolate extremely 
resistant proteolytic cleavage. nonglycosylated, proteinase k-treated prp(sc) 
of bse isolates scrapie strain 87v exhibited 1-2 kd lower molecular mass
than prp(sc) derived scrapie strains isolates. the
exception strain 87v, prp(sc) generally deposited cerebrum,
cerebellum, brain stem different mouse lines comparable levels.
long-term proteinase resistance, molecular mass, analysis prp(sc)
deposition therefore provide useful criteria discriminating prion strains
