our objective identify possible differences protease inhibitor plasma
concentrations within three protease inhibitor regimens (indinavir,
saquinavir lopinavir combination low-dose ritonavir) to
relate differences safety efficacy. data originated pre-defined
pharmacokinetic substudies within two randomized 48-week trials evaluating the
safety efficacy three protease inhibitor regimens. weeks 4 48,
plasma collected minimum drug plasma concentrations, c(min), were
obtained. 656 randomized patients, 283 patients available c(min) at
week 4. indinavir, saquinavir lopinavir c(min) high combined with
low-dose ritonavir. significant difference proportion patients
experiencing treatment failure could found according c(min) within 
treatment arm. saquinavir c(min) > 2000 ng/ml associated increased 
risk gastrointestinal grade 3 4 adverse events higher total
cholesterol. overall, changes c(min) week 4 week 48 in
patients remained therapy. association treatment failure and
the c(min) could demonstrated. associations high c(min) toxicity
were identified saquinavir arm; therefore, dose reductions may be
appropriate certain patients c(min) several times minimum
effective concentration.
