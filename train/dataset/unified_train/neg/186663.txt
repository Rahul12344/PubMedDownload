in vivo assembly maturation vesicular stomatitis virus.

previous studies vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) maturation infected cells
have utilized vitro cell cultures. present study is, knowledge, the
first vivo analysis vsv-cell interaction central nervous system of
weaning outbred swiss mice. intracerebral inoculation wild-type vsv resulted
in rapid viral replication brain spinal cord. immunoflourescence, viral
antigens first seen ependymal cells brain spinal cord soon
thereafter surrounding neurons. large anterior horn neurons spinal cord
appeared heavily infected. ultrastructurally, vsv-neuron
interaction evolved three phases. first phase consisted viral entry
into cell fusion viropexis. second phase characterized by
nucleocapsid accumulation resulted appearance large cytoplasmic
inclusions. third phase maturation release infected cell and
was accomplished viral budding plasma membranes. degenerative changes 
infected neurons generally absent. cells area central canal
seemed present different pattern virus-cell interaction especially the
level maturation release. cells advanced stages of
degeneration showed viral particles free nucleocapsid material no
virus-membrane association. viral budding observed and, these
cells eventually die, possible virus released the
intercellular space moment cellular disruption. results suggest
that vsv-cell interactions may vary depending upon nature infected
cells.
