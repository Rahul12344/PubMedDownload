objective: ascertain immediate underlying causes death adults
who died hospital premortem diagnosis tuberculosis.
design: causes death assessed independently internists and
pathologists 50 adults admitted two soweto hospitals died 24 h 
after admission. detailed record reviews complete autopsies, including hiv
tests performed premortem, performed. addition, variety of
postmortem microbiological tests performed.
results: forty-seven patients hiv infection; antiretroviral naive.
their median age 34.5 years, median cd4 cell count 48 cells/microl and
median length hospitalization death 6 days. autopsy confirmed the
premortem diagnosis tuberculosis 37 hiv-infected patients (79%), whereas 10
(21%) demonstrate tuberculosis. bronchopneumonia cytomegalovirus
pneumonitis leading pathologies 10 patients. 47 hiv-infected
cadavers immediate contributory causes death were: extensive pulmonary
tuberculosis, 32 (68%); disseminated tuberculosis, 28 (60%); bacterial pneumonia,
13 (26%); cytomegalovirus pneumonitis seven (15%); cytomegalovirus dna was
found 31 (66%) pneumocystis pneumonia found five cadavers (11%).
the lung, followed lymph nodes, liver kidney, commonest sites 
tuberculosis. mycobacterium tuberculosis cultured 19 spleens, one of
which multidrug resistant, salmonella spp. cultured 11 splenic
specimens.
conclusion: demonstrated disseminated, extensive tuberculosis associated 
advanced hiv disease. severe bacterial infections, including salmonellosis, 
the leading co-morbidity, suggesting hospitalized hiv-infected adults in
whom tuberculosis suspected may benefit broad-spectrum antibiotic
therapy.
