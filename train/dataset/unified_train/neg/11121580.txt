nuclear receptors ligand-inducible transcription factors be
classified two major groups according dna-binding properties.
members first group bind dna dimers, either homo- heterodimers;
members second group also able bind monomers. first
group extensively studied biochemically, little known about
nuclear receptors bind act monomers. study, compared the
binding transcriptional behaviour ror alpha (nr1f1) ror beta (nr1f2), 
two representatives subgroup monomer-binding receptors. show that
although highly related amino acid structures, display
remarkably different binding behaviours. furthermore, provide evidence that
ror beta efficiently activate transcription vitro monomer.
