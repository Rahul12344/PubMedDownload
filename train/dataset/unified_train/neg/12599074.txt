to establish experimental pneumocystis carinii infection simian
immunodeficiency virus (siv)-infected macaques model acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (aids)-associated p. carinii pneumonia (pcp),
siv-infected macaques inoculated intrabronchially macaque-derived p.
carinii, p. carinii-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) flow
cytometric analysis bronchoalveolar lavage fluid done biweekly 
44 weeks inoculation. inoculated animals p. carinii-specific pcr 
product infection. cd8(+) cells lung lavage samples siv- p.
carinii-coinfected animals increased >90% total cd3(+) cells, pattern
associated naturally acquired p. carinii infection. progression disease
also correlated increased neutrophil infiltration lungs. the
animals protracted period asymptomatic colonization p. carinii
before progression pcp. development model pcp siv-infected
rhesus macaques provides means study aids-associated pcp.
