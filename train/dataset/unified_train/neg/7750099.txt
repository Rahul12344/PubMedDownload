wild-type p53 nuclear phosphoprotein inhibits cell proliferation and
represses transcriptionally tata box-containing promoters transformed 
tumor-derived cell lines. study demonstrates p53 alters transcription
of long control region (lcr) human papillomavirus type 18 (hpv-18).
wild-type mutant p53 143val ala repressed hpv-18 lcr promoter in
normal human keratinocytes, natural host cell hpv infections. repression 
by wild-type p53 also observed c-33a cells hpv-16-immortalized
cell line inducible wild-type p53. however, c-33a cells were
cotransfected hpv-18 lcr mutant 143val ala, repression not
occur. mutant p53 135cys ser induce repression either normal human 
keratinocytes c-33a line; although like 143val ala, thought to
affect dna binding activity wild-type protein. ability mutant
p53 143val ala inactivate hpv early promoter normal cells (by
approximately 60% reduction) suggests mutant may able associate
with wild-type p53 interact tata box-binding proteins. therefore, 
results demonstrate transcriptional activities p53 mutants may be
dependent upon cell type assayed form endogenous p53.
furthermore, normal human keratinocytes represent alternative model for
determining activities p53 mutants.
