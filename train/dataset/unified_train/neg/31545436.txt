the aim present study investigate whether nuclear factor erythroid 
2p45‑related factor 2 (nrf2) overexpression gene transfer may protect
neurons/glial cells association neurons/glial cells axons 
spinal cord injury (sci). present study, nrf2 recombinant adenovirus (ad) 
vectors constructed. protein levels nrf2 nucleus the
nrf2‑regulated gene products heme oxygenase‑1 (ho‑1) nad (p)h‑quinone
oxidoreductase‑1 (nqo1), detected using western blot analysis pc12 cells 
following 48 h transfection. furthermore, expression nrf2 localized
using immunofluorescence experiment, expression nrf2, ho‑1 nqo1
were detected using immunohistochemical experiment grey matter of
spinal cord rats. post‑injury motor behavior assessed via basso,
beattie bresnahan (bbb) locomotor scale method. pc12 cells, subsequent 
ad‑nrf2 transfection, nuclear nrf2, ho‑1 nqo1 levels significantly
increased compared control (p<0.01). statistically signiﬁcant 
changes pc12‑ad‑nrf2 group [nrf2 (1.146±0.095), ho‑1 (1.816±0.095) and
nqo1 (1.421±0.138)] compared pc12‑control group [nrf2 (0.717±0.055),
ho‑1 (1.264±0.081) nqo1 (0.921±0.088)] pc12‑ad‑green fluorescent protein 
group [nrf2 (0.714±0.111), ho‑1 (1.238±0.053) nqo1 (0.987±0.045); p<0.01].
the bbb scores rats indicated improved functional recovery
following local injection ad‑nrf2. third day following the
operation, bbb scores adenovirus groups (0.167±0.408) significantly
decreased compared sci group (1±0.894; p<0.05). injured section
of spinal cord rats, number positive cells expressing nrf2,
ho‑1 nqo1 raised compared control sci groups, indicating
that adenovirus vector‑mediated gene transfer nrf2 promotes functional
recovery following spinal cord contusion rats.
