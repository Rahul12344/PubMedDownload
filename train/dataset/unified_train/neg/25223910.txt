epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection closely associated undifferentiated
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (npc), strongly implicating role ebv npc
pathogenesis; conversely, ebv infection rarely detected normal
nasopharyngeal epithelial tissues. general, ebv show strong tropism
for infecting human epithelial cells, ebv infection oropharyngeal
epithelial cells believed lytic nature. establish life-long
infection humans, ebv evolved efficient strategies infect b cells and
hijack cellular machinery latent infection. lytic ebv infection in
oropharyngeal epithelial cells, though infrequent event, believed a
major source infectious ebv particles salivary transmission. the
biological events associated nasopharyngeal epithelial cells only
beginning understood advancement ebv infection methods 
availability nasopharyngeal epithelial cell models ebv infection studies. 
ebv infection human epithelial cells highly inefficient process compared 
to b cells, express complement receptor type 2 (cr2) mediate
ebv infection. although receptor(s) epithelial cell surface ebv
infection remain(s) identified, ebv infection epithelial cells could 
achieved via interaction glycoproteins viral envelope surface 
integrins epithelial cells, might trigger membrane fusion internalize
ebv cells. normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cells permissive for
latent ebv infection, ebv infection normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cells
usually results growth arrest. however, genetic alterations premalignant
nasopharyngeal epithelial cells, including p16 deletion cyclin d1
overexpression, could override growth inhibitory effect ebv infection to
support stable latent ebv infection nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. the
ebv episome npc clonal nature, suggesting npc develops a
single ebv-infected nasopharyngeal epithelial cell, establishment of
persistent latent ebv infection premalignant nasopharyngeal epithelium may
represent early critical event npc development.
