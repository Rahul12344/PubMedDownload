loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) nucleic acid amplification
method applied adapted detection number pathogens. lamp
assay developed specific detection wild-type classical swine fever
virus (csfv). based alignment genomic sequences pestiviruses
available genbank, four primers selected targeting six positions the
ns5b gene region viral genome. assay performed simple water
bath constant temperature 62 degrees c, adding sybr green i,
the results visualised naked eye. assay allowed easy
applicability laboratory equipped simply, even site, close 
the outbreaks field conditions. confirmation, results could
also visualised uv light separation amplified products on
2% agarose gels. detection limit assay 2.5 medium tissue culture
infectious dose (tcid(50)). assay validated 116 clinical samples
from vaccinated swineherds 53 blood samples experimental infections, and
the results comparable real-time rt-pcr assay. summary, lamp
assay provides simple, rapid, sensitive tool detection wild-type
csfv field conditions.
