the purpose study analyze antigenic structure the
nucleocapsid protein n lelystad virus isolate porcine reproductive 
respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) identify antigenic differences 
this prototype european isolate north american isolates. this, we
generated panel monoclonal antibodies (mabs) directed n protein 
of lelystad virus tested competition assays n-specific
mabs described previously (drew et al., 1995; nelson et al., 1993; van nieuwstadt
et al., 1996). four different competition groups mabs identified. pepscan
analysis solid-phase dodecapeptides used identify specific antigenic 
regions n protein bound mabs. pepscan analysis,
we found mab first competition group reacted linear peptides
whose core sequences consisted amino acids 2-12 (site a), mabs the
second group reacted peptides whose core sequences consisted amino acids 
25-30 (site b), mab third group reacted peptides whose core
sequences consisted amino acids 40-46 (site c). however, fourth group of
mabs binding antigenic region, provisionally designated domain d,
reacted weakly react solid-phase dodecapeptides. to
further characterize structure epitopes domain d, produced
chimeric constructs composed n protein sequences lelystad virus and
another arterivirus lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, used because
its n protein similarity amino acid sequence hydropathicity profile
but react mabs. mabs specific domain tested 
for binding chimeric n proteins expressed semliki forest virus, we
found regions amino acids 51-67 amino acids 80-90 are
involved formation part epitopes domain d. therefore, 
conclude n protein contains four distinct antigenic regions. the
epitopes mapped sites a-c linear, whereas epitopes mapped domain 
are conformation dependent discontinuous. sites c contain epitopes 
that conserved european north american isolates; site b
contains epitopes conserved european north american isolates; and
site contains epitopes either conserved conserved european
and north american isolates. antigenic regions identified might be
important development diagnostic test prrsv particular tests
that discriminate different antigenic types prrsv.
