delayed-type hypersensitivity (dth), assayed footpad swelling, induced 
6- 8-week-old balb/ccr mice immunized formalin-inactivated,
sucrose-banded murine type-c viruses. dth response inducible as
little 11.25 mug sensitizing antigen, greatest sc sensitization as
compared im ip sensitization, optimally elicited 7-day
challenge. statistical evaluation dth assay revealed test was
consistently reproducible limited biologic variability mouse
and standardization antigen preparation. dth response specific
for type-c virus subtypes could distinguish rauscher strain of
murine leukemia virus akr leukemia virus challenge antigen was
extracted tween 80-ether. immunized mice gave dth responses were
resistant challenge exogenous, live murine leukemia viruses.
