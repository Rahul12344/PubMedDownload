myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mdscs) described suppressors of
t-cell function many malignancies. impaired t-cell responses been
observed patients chronic hepatitis c virus infection (chc), is
reportedly associated establishment persistent hcv infection.
therefore, hypothesized mdscs also play role chronic hcv infection. 
mdscs peripheral blood 206 patients chc 20 healthy donors were
analyzed flow cytometry. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) healthy
donors cultured hepatitis c virus core protein (hcvc) stimulated with
or without interleukin 10 (il-10). compared healthy donors certain chc
patients sustained viral response (svr), chc patients without svr presented 
with dramatic elevation g-mdscs hla-dr-/low cd33+ cd14- cd11b+
phenotype peripheral blood. frequency g-mdscs chc patients was
positively correlated serum hcvc, g-mdscs induced healthy
pbmcs adding exogenous hcvc. furthermore, revealed potential mechanism by
which hcvc mediates g-mdsc polarization; activation erk1/2 resulting il-10 
production il-10-activated stat3 signalling. finally, confirmed that
hcvc-induced g-mdscs suppress proliferation production ifn-γ in
autologous t-cells. also found frequency g-mdscs serum was
associated chc prognosis. hcvc maintains immunosuppression promoting
il-10/stat3-dependent differentiation g-mdscs pbmcs, resulting the
impaired functioning t-cells. g-mdscs may thus promising biomarker for
predicting prognosis chc patients.
