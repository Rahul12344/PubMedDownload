far away common fungal infection associated hiv infection is
candidiasis. tends produce mucosal topical infections local treatment
may enough control them. generally prefer courses 1-2 weeks rather
than chronic suppression, fear eliciting overgrowth resistant isolates.
fluconazole resistant candida species may increasing problem next 
decade. cryptococcoses problem simpler complicated.
fluconazole highly effective chronic suppression, effective
for initial therapy. short course amphotericin b, 2 weeks in
length, followed chronic azole suppression. fluconazole appears excellent, 
but itraconazole may also effective. histoplasmosis itraconazole appears
to advantageous drug, excellent clinical response within 2
weeks. role fluconazole unclear. coccidioidomycosis uncommon, but
difficult. cannot offer suggestions "ideal" therapy here. other
diseases, aspergillosis, extremely uncommon still aids
associated mycoses. personal fear go along identifying the
aids virus complications, aspergillosis zygomycosis may establish
themselves future "black hats" need pull something
out "box". pull clear.
