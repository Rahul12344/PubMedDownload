recent discoveries revealed previously unappreciated complexity which
retroviruses interact hosts. particular, become aware 
many mammals, including humans, equipped genes encoding so-called
"restriction factors," provide considerable resistance retroviral
infection. antiretroviral genes sometimes constitutively expressed, 
sometimes interferon-induced. thus viewed comprising intrinsic 
immune system provides pre-mobilized defense retroviral infection 
or, alternatively, specialized extension conventional innate immunity.
antiretroviral restriction factors evolved unusually rapid pace,
particularly primates, startling examples evolutionary change 
present genes encoding restriction factors. understanding the
mechanisms restriction factors interfere retroviral replication,
and effects avoided certain retroviruses, accruing, far
from complete. knowledge could allow novel forms therapeutic
intervention pathogenic retroviral infections, well development of
animal models human disease.
