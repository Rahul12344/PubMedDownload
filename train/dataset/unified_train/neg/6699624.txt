berne virus 'coronavirus-like'.

horzinek mc, weiss m, ederveen j.

in infected embryonic mule skin cells, berne virus directs synthesis two
main polypeptides (22k, 20k); addition, virus-specific proteins apparent 
molecular weights greater 200k, 80k 120k, 32k 17k detected
after radioimmune precipitation. replication berne virus reduced 
than 1000-fold actinomycin d, drug (0.1 1.0 micrograms/ml) was
added first 8 h infection; alpha-amanitin (25 micrograms/ml)
produced similar though less pronounced effect. u.v. preirradiation the
cells greater equal 5 led dramatic decrease the
production extracellular virus. results presented support suggestion
that berne virus representative new family animal viruses.
