background: transmission hepatitis b virus (hbv) hbv-positive mothers 
their infants common usually occurs mother hepatitis b e
antigen (hbeag) positive and/or high hbv dna load. study, we
determined prevalence hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag) hbeag among 
pregnant women known hiv status.
findings: total 650 pregnant women mean age 26.2 years including
301 hiv-positives 349 hiv-negatives screened hbsag (monolisa aghbs
plus biorad, france). among hbsag-positives, hbeag anti-hbe tested
(monolisa ag hbe plus biorad, france). overall, 51 (7.85%) positive for
hbsag. prevalence hbsag statistically different between
hiv-positive hiv-negative pregnant women [28/301 (9.3%) vs 23/349 (6.59%); p 
= 0.2]. none 45 hbsag-positive samples reactive hbeag.
conclusions: study indicates high prevalence hbsag low
proportion hbeag cameroonian pregnant women. since perinatal transmission
of hbv mostly effective mother also hbeag-positive, data could
suggest perinatal transmissions play minor role hbv prevalence in
cameroon. line previous african studies, findings suggests 
that horizontal transmission could common mechanism hbv infections
in cameroon.
