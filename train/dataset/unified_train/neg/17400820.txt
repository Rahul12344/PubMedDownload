this multicenter, open-label study evaluated effects multiple doses of
peginterferon alfa-2b steadystate pharmacokinetics methadone 20
adults hepatitis c virus infection enrolled methadone
maintenance program. subjects received peginterferon alfa-2b 1.5 mug/kg/wk
for 4 weeks maintained normal methadone regimen. serial blood samples
were collected immediately first fourth peginterferon
alfa-2b dose (day 23). day 23, exposure active methadone r-enantiomer
increased approximately 15% following administration peginterferon alfa-2b,
with 90% confidence intervals outside bioequivalence criteria (range,
80%-125%). similar increases exposure (c(max), auc(0-24), auc(last)) 
observed s-methadone total methadone. peginterferon alfa-2b well
tolerated. peginterferon alfa-2b associated minor increases exposure
to methadone individuals hepatitis c virus infection; however, these
increases unlikely clinically meaningful associated with
any safety concerns.
