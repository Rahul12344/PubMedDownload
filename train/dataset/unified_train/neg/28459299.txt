background: group streptococcus (gas) lineage genotype emm3, sequence type
15 (st15) associated 6 month upsurge invasive gas disease the
uk. epidemic lineage (lineage c) lost 2 typical emm3 prophages, φ315.1
and φ315.2 associated superantigen ssa, gained different prophage 
(φuk-m3.1) associated different superantigen, spec dnase spd1.
methods results: presence spec spd1 lineage c st15 strains
enhanced vitro mitogenic dnase activities non-lineage c st15
strains. invasive disease models galleria mellonella spec-sensitive
transgenic mice, revealed difference overall invasiveness lineage c st15
strains compared non-lineage c st15 strains, consistent clinical and
epidemiological analysis. lineage c strains however markedly prolong murine
nasal infection enhanced nasal airborne shedding compared with
non-lineage c strains. deletion spec spd1 2 lineage c strains identified
a possible role spd1 airborne shedding murine nasopharynx.
conclusions: nasopharyngeal infection shedding lineage c strains was
enhanced compared non-lineage c strains was, part, mediated by
the gain dnase spd1 prophage acquisition.
