objective: obtain anti-hav antibodies.
methods: antibody-capturing antigen strategy used panning antibody
library impure antigen. hav-binding activity specificity phage
antibodies assayed sandwich elisa competitive inhibition elisa.
results: phage antibodies(fab) hav screened human
immunoglobulin combinatorial library. fd light chain genes sequenced.
comparison fd gene light chain gene kabat database showed that
the heavy chain belonged igg1 subclass, variable region derived
from rearranged germ-line gene dp88, d3-3 jh5; light chain a
member v kappa iii family, germ-line gene dp kappa 22 j kappa 4.
conclusion: phage antibodies hav selected antibody library 
by using antibody-capturing antigen strategy. result also suggested 
the antibody library constructed successfully.
