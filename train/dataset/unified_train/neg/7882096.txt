approximately 25% human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). hiv-infected cells are
more sensitive heat healthy lymphocytes, susceptibility increases
when cells presensitized exposure tumor necrosis factor. thus,
induction whole-body hyperthermia hyperthermia specifically limited to
tissues high viral load potential antiviral therapy acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). accordingly, incorporated therapeutic
hyperthermia existing mathematical model evaluates interaction
between hiv cd4+ cells. given assumptions limitations this
model, results indicate daily therapy lowering population of
actively infected cells 40% infectious virus 40% would effectively
reverse depletion cells. contrast, daily decline 20% either
actively infected cells infectious virus would marginal effect.
however, daily reduction 20% actively infected cells infectious
virus could restore t-cell numbers, assuming permanent damage been
inflicted thymus. since daily treatments would probably excessively
stressful, whole-body hyperthermia seems unlikely clinically useful. in
contrast, heating directed specifically areas viral concentration may be
effective suitable risk/benefit ratio.
