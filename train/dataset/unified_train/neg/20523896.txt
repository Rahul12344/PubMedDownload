dna viruses, retroviruses hepadnaviruses, hepatitis b virus (hbv),
are vulnerable genetic editing single stranded dna host cell apobec3
(a3) cytidine deaminases. least three a3 genes regulated by
interferon-alpha human hepatocytes ectopic expression activation
induced deaminase (aicda), a3 paralog, noted variety chronic 
inflammatory syndromes including hepatitis c virus infection. yet virtually all
studies hbv editing confined analyses virions from
culture supernatants serum frequency edited genomes generally 
low (< = 10(-2)). decided look nature frequency hbv
editing cirrhotic samples taken removal primary hepatocellular
carcinoma. forty-one cirrhotic tissue samples (10 alcoholic, 10 hbv(+), 11
hbv(+)hcv(+) 10 hcv(+)) well 4 normal livers studied. compared 
normal liver, 5/7 apobec3 genes significantly regulated order:
hcv+/-hbv>hbv>alcoholic cirrhosis. a3c a3d regulated groups
while interferon inducible a3g expressed virus associated
cirrhosis, aicda approximately 50% hbv/hcv samples. while
aicda indeed edit hbv dna ex vivo, a3g dominant deaminase vivo with
up 35% hbv genomes edited. despite highly deleterious mutant
spectra, small fraction genomes survive contribute loss hbeag
antigenemia possibly hbsag immune escape. conclusion, cytokine storm
associated chronic inflammatory responses hbv hcv clearly up
regulates number a3 genes a3g clearly major restriction factor 
for hbv. although mutant spectrum resulting a3 editing highly
deleterious, small part, notably lightly edited genomes, might help
the virus evolve even escape immune responses.
