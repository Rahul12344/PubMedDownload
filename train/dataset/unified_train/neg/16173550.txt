field studies conducted assess coastal water quality impact of
stormwater runoff santa ana river, drains large urban watershed 
located southern california. stormwater runoff river leads very
poor surf zone water quality, fecal indicator bacteria concentrations
exceeding california ocean bathing water standards 500%. however,
cross-shore currents (e.g., rip cells) dilute contaminated surf zone water with
cleaner water offshore, surf zone contamination generally
confined < 5 km around river outlet. offshore surf zone, stormwater
runoff ejected mouth river spreads large area, in
some cases exceeding 100 km2 basis satellite observations. fecal
indicator bacteria concentrations large stormwater plumes generally do
not exceed california ocean bathing water standards, even cases offshore
samples test positive human pathogenic viruses (human adenoviruses and
enteroviruses) fecal indicator viruses (f+ coliphage). multiple lines of
evidence indicate bacteria viruses offshore stormwater plumes are
either associated relatively small particles (< 53 microm) not
particle-associated. collectively, results demonstrate stormwater
runoff santa ana river negatively impacts coastal water quality, in
the surf zone offshore. however, extent impact, human
health significance, influenced numerous factors, including prevailing
ocean currents, within-plume processing particles pathogens, the
timing, magnitude, nature runoff discharged river outlets the
course storm.
