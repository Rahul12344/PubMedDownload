we previously reported several beta-l-thymidine analogues including
beta-l-3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (beta-l-azt),
beta-l-3'-fluoro-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (beta-l-flt) beta-l-2',
3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (beta-l-d4t) inhibit hiv replication 
in human peripheral blood mononuclear (pbm) cells whereas corresponding
beta-d-counterparts known potent selective anti-hiv agents [faraj et
al., 1997. nucleosides nucleotides 16, 1287-1290]. order gain insight
on lack antiviral activities beta-l-derivatives, vitro
enzymatic steady state studies conducted present study with
beta-l-azt. beta-l-azt 5'-triphosphate (l-azttp) chemically synthesized and
found moderately inhibit wild-type hiv reverse transcriptase (hiv-1 rt) a
k(i) value 2 microm; lacking inhibitory effect towards human dna
polymerase alpha, beta gamma. however, inhibitory effect l-azttp
towards hiv-1 rt modest (266-fold less potent) compared its
isomer beta-d-azt 5'-triphosphate (d-azttp) exhibits k(i) value 0.0075
microm finding confirmed dna chain termination assay.
these data suggest absence antiviral activity parent
beta-l-azt may part explained poor inhibition targeted viral 
enzyme l-azttp, active metabolite. finally, l-azttp found lack
affinity mutant rt position 184 (m184v) demonstrating this
mutation confers resistance beta-l-2',3'-dideoxycytidine analogs as
previously reported group [faraj et al., 1994. antimicrob. agents
chemother. 38, 2300-2305] well beta-l-2',3'-dideoxythymidine
analogs.
