hiv-1 (human immunodeficiency virus) transcription primarily controlled the
virally encoded tat (transactivator transcription) protein interaction
with viral tar (transcription response element) rna element. specifically,
binding tat-containing complex tar recruits cellular factors promote
elongation host rna polymerase engaging viral dna template. disruption
of interaction halts viral rna transcription. present study, we
investigated effect pokeweed antiviral protein (pap), rna glycosidase
(ec#: 3.2.2.22) synthesized pokeweed plant (phytolacca americana), on
transcription hiv-1 mrna. show co-expression pap proviral
clone culture cells resulted tat-dependent decrease viral mrna levels.
pap reduced hiv-1 transcriptional activity inhibiting tat protein synthesis.
the effects pap expression host factors ap-1 (activator protein 1), nf-κb
(nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer activated b-cells) specificity 
protein 1, modulate hiv-1 transcription binding viral ltr
(5'-long terminal repeat), also investigated. ap-1 showed modest jnk 
pathway-dependent increase activity presence pap; however, this
activation sufficient significantly enhance transcription a
partial viral ltr containing ap-1 binding sites. therefore, primary effect of
pap hiv-1 transcription reduce viral rna synthesis decreasing the
abundance tat. findings provide mechanistic explanation the
observed decrease viral rnas cells expressing pap contribute our
understanding antiviral effects plant protein.
