background: organized screening based pap tests substantially reduced
deaths cervical cancer many countries, including australia. however, 
impact program depends upon degree women participate. new
method screening, testing human papillomavirus (hpv) dna detect the
virus causes cervical cancer, recently become available. women
can collect samples test home, potential to
overcome barriers pap tests. ipap trial evaluate whether 
mailing hpv self-sampling kit increases participation never- and
under-screened women within cervical screening program.
methods/design: ipap trial parallel randomized controlled, open label,
trial. participants victorian women age 30-69 years, is
either record victorian cervical cytology registry (vccr) pap test
(never-screened) last recorded pap test five fifteen years 
ago (under-screened). enrolment information victorian electoral
commission linked vccr determine never-screened women.
variables used record linkage include full name, address and
date birth. never- under-screened women randomly allocated to
either receive invitation letter hpv self-sampling kit reminder
letter attend pap test, standard practice women overdue for
a test victoria. resources focus group tested. primary
outcome proportion women participate, returning hpv
self-sampling kit women self-sampling arm, notification pap
test result registry women pap test arm 3 6 months after
mailout. important secondary outcome proportion test-positive 
women undergo investigations 6 12 months mailout of
results.
discussion: ipap trial provide strong evidence whether hpv
self-sampling could used australia improve participation cervical
screening never-and under-screened women.
