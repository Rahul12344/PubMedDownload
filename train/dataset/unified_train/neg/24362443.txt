glycosylation important attribute baculovirus-insect cell expression
systems, insect cell lines produce core α1,3-fucosylated n-glycans,
which highly immunogenic render recombinant glycoproteins unsuitable 
human use. address problem, exploited bacterial enzyme,
guanosine-5'-diphospho (gdp)-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-d-mannose reductase (rmd), which
consumes gdp-l-fucose precursor. expected enzyme block
glycoprotein fucosylation blocking production gdp-l-fucose, donor
substrate required process. initially, engineered two different
insect cell lines constitutively express rmd isolated subclones with
fucosylation-negative phenotypes. however, found fucosylation-negative
phenotypes induced rmd expression unstable, indicating host
cell engineering approach ineffective insect systems. thus, constructed 
a baculovirus vector designed express rmd immediately infection and
facilitate insertion genes encoding glycoprotein interest for
expression later infection. used vector produce daughter
encoding rituximab found, contrast rmd-negative control, insect
cells infected virus produced nonfucosylated form therapeutic
antibody. results indicate rmd(+) baculoviral vector used
to solve immunogenic core α1,3-fucosylation problem associated the
baculovirus-insect cell system. conjunction existing glycoengineered
insect cell lines, vector extends utility baculovirus-insect cell
system include therapeutic glycoprotein production. new vector also
extends utility baculovirus-insect cell system include the
production recombinant antibodies enhanced effector functions, due its
ability block core α1,6-fucosylation.
