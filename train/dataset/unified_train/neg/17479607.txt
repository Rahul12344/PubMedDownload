honeybee venom hyaluronidase (api 2) major glycoprotein allergen. previous
studies indicated recombinant api 2 expressed insect cells has
enzyme activity ige binding comparable native api 2. in
contrast, api 2 expressed escherichia coli not. study, we
characterized carbohydrate side chains api 2 expressed insect cells, 
and compared data established carbohydrate structure native api m
2. assessed monosaccharide oligosaccharide content of
recombinant api 2 using fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis and
hplc. identify amino acid residues glycosylation occurs, we
digested recombinant api 2 endoproteinase glu-c identified the
fragments contained carbohydrate specific staining. recombinant api 2
expressed insect cells contains n-acetylglucosamine, mannose, fucose, as
well trace amounts glucose galactose, oligosaccharide analysis 
is consistent heterogeneous oligosaccharide chains consisting two to
seven monosaccharides. sialic acid n-acetylgalactosamine detected.
these results similar published data native api 2, although some
monosaccharide components appear absent recombinant protein.
analysis proteolytic digests indicates four candidate
n-glycosylation sites, carbohydrate chains attached asparagines 115 and
263. recombinant api 2 expressed insect cells enzymic activity ige
binding comparable native protein, carbohydrate composition is
very similar.
