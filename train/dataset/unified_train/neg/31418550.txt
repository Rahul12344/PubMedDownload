consensus motifs sequences crystallizable amorphous blocks in
silks natural structural analogues silks vary widely. design novel
silklike polypeptides, important question therefore nature of
either crystallizable amorphous block affects self-assembly and
resulting physical properties silklike polypeptides. address herein the
influence amorphous block self-assembly silklike polypeptide
that previously designed encapsulate single dna molecules rod-shaped 
viruslike particles. polypeptide triblock architecture, long
n-terminal amorphous block, crystallizable midblock, c-terminal
dna-binding block. compare self-assembly behavior triblock a
very hydrophilic collagen-like amorphous block (gxaayaa)132 triblock
with less hydrophilic elastin-like amorphous block (gsgvp)80. amorphous
blocks similar lengths adopt random coil structure solution.
nevertheless, atomic force microscopy revealed significant differences the
self-assembly behavior triblocks. collagen-like amorphous blocks are
used, clear distinction short polypeptide-only fibrils
and much longer fibrils encapsulated dna. elastin-like amorphous blocks
are used, dna still encapsulated, polypeptide-only fibrils now
much longer size distribution partially overlaps the
encapsulated dna fibrils. attribute difference hydrophilic
nature collagen-like amorphous block, strongly opposes the
growth polypeptide-only fibrils elastin-like amorphous blocks. our
work illustrates differences chemical nature amorphous blocks 
strongly influence self-assembly hence functionality engineered
silklike polypeptides.
