fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis (fch) life-threatening consequence of
hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection occurring small minority liver
transplantation (lt) recipients. herein report case early-onset fch after
living donor lt 47-year-old woman hcv-related cirrhosis. patient
underwent balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration splenorenal
shunt treat impaired portal flow sixth postoperative day (pod 6) and
a bypass operation hepatic artery thrombosis pod 12. thereafter, serum
bilirubin levels increased gradually; however, computed tomography revealed no
evidence biliary stricture. serum hcv-rna level pod 27 >7.8 log
iu/ml. histopathology needle graft biopsy performed pod 28 revealed fch
with extensive portal fibrosis accompanied mild inflammation, hepatocyte
ballooning, ductular proliferation cholestasis. patient received
combination therapy pegylated interferon, ribavirin, double-filtration
plasmapheresis treatment early-onset fch. recipient the
donor carried major genotype single nucleotide polymorphism (tt) rs8099917
near interleukin-28b gene. furthermore, hcv genotype was
treatment-sensitive 2a. nonetheless, recipient died hepatic failure pod
211. thus far, cases fch occurring within 1 month lt been
reported. addition, early onset fch may adverse prognostic
factor.
