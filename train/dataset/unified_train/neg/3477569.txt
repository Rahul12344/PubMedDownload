a current concept serological response human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv) infection humans antibodies core antigens (p55, p24, p15)
are detectable earlier initial stages antibody production than
antibodies envelope antigens (gp160, gp120, gp41). comparative
studies western blot (immunoblot), radioimmunoprecipitation assay (ripa), 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) initial antibody production 
limited case reports resolved issue. thirty 37
participants part prospective study least one specimen that
was negative anti-gp41 one bands western blot.
twenty-seven 30 specimens reactive anti-gp120/160 ripa. 
of 30 specimens, kits bionetics identified 2 (7%),
electronucleonics 4 (13%), abbott 13 (43%), du pont 25 (83%), genetic systems
25 (83%). participants evidence serological progression western
blot, including gp41 band, subsequent visits; elisa kits all
manufacturers identified later specimens greater accuracy. data 
show ripa detects anti-envelope antibodies may detectable by
western blot production anti-envelope antibodies approximately
parallels production anti-core antibodies. false-negative results by
elisa would permit transmission hiv blood transfusion donors early 
stages infection. sensitivity licensed elisa kits improved to
identify antibody soon possible infection.
