to perform structure/function analyses protein vivo, ideally one should
be able simultaneously abolish expression endogenous wild-type protein,
substitute form protein containing targeted mutation, and
analyze functional consequences. recently, highly
challenging and/or laborious approach mammalian systems, requiring targeted 
gene knockin human cell line mouse. herein described rna
interference (rnai)-based approach achieve much simply mammalian 
cells. single retrovirus constructed, directs expression a
short hairpin rna (shrna) knockdown expression endogenous protein of
interest; cdna coding wild-type mutant version protein
that also contains "silent mutations" affect protein sequence,
but make mrna resistant shrna; puromycin-resistance gene to
allow rapid drug selection virus-infected cells. using virus,
expression endogenous anti-silencing function 1a (asf1a) histone chaperone
has efficiently replaced primary human cells, ectopically expressed
epitope-tagged version. moreover, virus designed shrna and
shrna-resistant cdna cassettes easily substituted, making approach
readily applicable protein targets.
