the programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death ligands (pd-1/pd-ls) axis 
potential immune escape mechanism cancers. however, data pd-1/pd-ls
pathway ebv-associated extranodal natural killer/t cell lymphoma (enktl) and
its clinical implication limited. herein, characterized pd-1/pd-l
expression prognosis relevance 49 enktl patients thailand. pd-l1
was expressed frequently lymphoma cells (61.2%) stroma (77.5%),
whereas pd-l2 expression common lymphoma (63.2%) stromal cells. 
pd-1 positive 20.5% stroma, undetectable lymphoma cells. there
was association baseline clinical characteristics expression
pd-1/pd-ls. survival patients pd-ls tumor cells poor. for
pd-l1-positive versus negative cases, 2-year event-free survival (efs) was
42.2 versus 71.8% (p = 0.03) 2-year overall survival (os) 45.4 versus
78.9% (p = 0.02), respectively. comparing patients pd-l2-positive
and pd-l2-negative lymphoma, 2-year efs 37.1 versus 82.4% (p = 0.02) 
2-year os 45.2 versus 82.4% (p = 0.03), respectively. neither pd-1 pd-ls 
expression stroma predicted outcomes. conclusion, pd-ls frequently
expressed enktl cells associated inferior outcomes. therefore, pd-ls 
are potential prognostic biomarkers roles immune checkpoint blockade
therapy enktl deserve investigation.
