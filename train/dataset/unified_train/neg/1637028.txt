objective: characterize epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and
immunologic risk factors infections streptococcus pneumoniae among
persons infected human immunodeficiency virus (hiv); delineate a
practical approach diagnosis, treatment, prevention infections.
data sources: english-language articles index medicus references
as well abstracts conference proceedings compared rates well as
clinical microbiologic features s. pneumoniae infections hiv-infected
patients.
study selection: human studies included denominators, appropriate
control groups, sufficient clinical descriptions animal studies key
immunologic observations cited.
data extraction: compared epidemiologic clinical responses pneumococcal
disease hiv-infected patients control subjects correlated clinical and
experimental data immunologic defects associated hiv infection those
on regulation pneumococcal infections.
data synthesis: among patients hiv infection, incidence invasive
pneumococcal disease high, bacteremia common complication pneumonia,
and relapses occur frequently. however, clinical presentation, response to
therapy, serotypes isolated similar persons without hiv
infection, mortality similar lower. specific local systemic defects
in host defense, particularly humoral immunity, may contribute high
incidence invasive pneumococcal disease.
conclusions: streptococcus pneumoniae leading cause invasive bacterial 
respiratory disease adults children hiv infection. prompt diagnosis
and antimicrobial therapy associated favorable clinical outcome.
characterizing specific immunologic defects associated invasive
pneumococcal disease hiv-infected patients may facilitate development of
successful, cost-effective strategies prophylaxis.
