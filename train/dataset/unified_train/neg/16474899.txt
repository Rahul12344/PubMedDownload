we engineered artificial beta cell line produces up-regulation of
insulin response dexamethasone, down-regulation response to
insulin. regulatory secretion system devised placing proinsulin cdna
containing genetically engineered furin endoprotease cleavage sites a
regulatory promoter phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (pepck), insulin
expressing retrovirus vector (pn-pepck-mins) constructed transfected into
hepa1-6 cells. levels insulin culture medium expression insulin 
gene estimated radioimmunoassay reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (rt-pcr), respectively. clone (hepa1-6/ins21), secreted the
highest level insulin (10.79 microiu/106 cells per day), selected 
regulation experiment. compared non-treated hepa1-6/ins21 cells, insulin
production augmented 3.6-fold addition 10-7 dexamethasone.
addition exogenous insulin culture medium decreased insulin mrna
expression remarkably rt-pcr results, dexamethasone increased insulin
gene expression transcriptional level. data indicated genetically
engineered hepa1-6 cells could synthesize process secrete insulin a
physiological manner.
