objective: report outcomes, clinical management decisions results of
resistance testing among group children developed virologic failure on
first-line lopinavir/ritonavir (lpv/r)-based therapy large cohort of
antiretroviral therapy-treated children soweto.
design: historical cohort study.
methods: children virologic failure identified group 1692
children <3 years initiated first-line lpv/r-containing therapy since
2000 end november 2011. genotyping conducted children, 
outcomes, management decisions resistance results described.
results: total 152 children virologic failure first-line
lpv/r-containing antiretroviral therapy included. resistance testing was
performed 75/152 (49%), apart younger age (11.1 vs. 15.1 months, p 
= 0.04), children versus without resistance testing similar
for baseline characteristics (weight, cd4, viral load time failure).
genotyping revealed 8/75 (10.7%) significant lpv/r-associated resistance
mutations, including 2 intermediate darunavir resistance. among 63/75 (84%) 
children remaining lpv/r-based therapy, 32/63 (51%) achieved virologic
suppression, 2 children significant lpv mutations. in
accordance local guidelines time, 12/152 (8%) children were
switched non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors-based therapy. of
these, 4/12 (33%) resuppressed, rest achieve virologic
suppression including 2 lopinavir mutations.
conclusions: virologic failure lpv/r-containing first-line regimens is
associated accumulation lpv/r mutations children. implications are
unclear, surveillance selected sites warranted long-term virologic 
outcomes development resistance.
