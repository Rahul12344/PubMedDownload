background: immune response hepatitis b virus (hbv) important 
viral control disease pathogenesis. detailed understanding the
hbv-specific t-cell responses may potentially lead novel therapeutic
strategies hbv.
methods: english language journal articles (including articles press) up
to october 2007 retrieved using searches medline, embase cochrane
controlled trial registry. extensive database hbv sequences (seqhepb) and
genbank used assess degree sequence variation epitope. the
new standardized nomenclature hbv amino acid position number applied to
all previously defined epitopes.
results: forty-four hbv-specific human leukocyte antigen (hla) class restricted
and 32 hbv-specific hla class ii restricted epitopes defined have
been identified hbv genes. majority hla class restricted epitopes
have defined hla-a2-positive individuals setting acute hbv
infection. significant sequence variation epitopes within and
between hbv genotypes. newer hbv immunotherapeutics appear promising are
still early phases development.
conclusions: identification hbv-specific epitopes non-hla-a2-positive
individuals recognition genotypic variation across epitopes important 
for future development novel immunotherapeutic strategies the
management chronic hbv infection.
