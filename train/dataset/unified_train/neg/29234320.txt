preclinical early human clinical studies broadly neutralizing antibodies
(bnabs) prevent treat hiv infection support clinical utility and
potential bnabs prevention, postexposure prophylaxis, treatment of
acute chronic infection. observed potential limitations bnabs from
these recent studies include selection resistant viral populations,
immunogenicity resulting development antidrug (ab) responses, the
potentially toxic elimination reservoir cells regeneration-limited tissues.
here, review opportunities improve clinical utility hiv abs to
address challenges accomplish functional targets anti-hiv
ab therapy various stages exposure/infection. exposure, bnabs'
ability serve prophylaxis neutralization may improved increasing
serum half-life necessitate less frequent administration, delivering genes for
durable vivo expression, targeting bnabs sites exposure. after
exposure and/or setting acute infection, bnab use prevent/reduce
viral reservoir establishment spread may enhanced increasing the
potency autologous adaptive immune responses stimulated, clearing 
acutely infected cells, preventing cell-cell transmission virus. the
setting chronic infection, bnabs may better mediate viral remission "cure" 
in combination antiretroviral therapy and/or latency reversing agents, by
targeting additional markers tissue reservoirs infected cell types, by
serving targeting moieties engineered cell therapy. clinical use 
of hiv abs never closer, remaining studies precisely define, model,
and understand complex roles dynamics hiv abs viral evolution in
the context human immune system anatomical compartmentalization will
be critical optimize clinical use combination existing
agents define strategies enhance clinical safety 
and efficacy.
