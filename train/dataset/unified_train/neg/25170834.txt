macrophages act reservoirs human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) 
play important role transmission cells. hiv-1 vpr a
multi-functional protein involved hiv-1 replication pathogenesis; however,
its exact role hiv-1-infected human macrophages remains poorly understood. 
this study, used microarray approach explore effects hiv-1 vpr 
the transcriptional profile human monocyte-derived macrophages (mdms). more
than 500 genes, mainly involved innate immune response, type i
interferon pathway, cytokine production, signal transduction, were
differentially regulated (fold change >2.0) infection recombinant
adenovirus expressing hiv-1 vpr protein. differential expression profiles 
select interferon-stimulated genes (isgs) genes involved innate immune
response, including stat1, irf7, mx1, mx2, isg15, isg20, ifit1, ifit2, ifit3,
ifi27, ifi44l, apobec3a, ddx58 (rig-i), tnfsf10 (trail), rsad2 (viperin) were
confirmed real-time quantitative pcr consistent microarray
data. addition, post-translational level, hiv-1 vpr induced the
phosphorylation stat1 tyrosine 701 human mdms. results demonstrate
that hiv-1 vpr leads induction isgs expand current
understanding function vpr role hiv-1 immune pathogenesis.
