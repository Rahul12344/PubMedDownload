micrornas small, non-coding rnas negatively regulate gene expression. it
has proposed micrornas could function regulation innate
immunity, demonstrated viral infection. test
this hypothesis using human pathogenic virus kaposi's sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus (kshv) one putative natural cellular targets, primary
lymphatic endothelial cells (lecs). show early antiviral microrna
response (6 h post-infection) includes expression micrornas enhance viral
gene expression. particular, creb-induced mir-132 microrna highly
upregulated infection negative effect expression of
interferon-stimulated genes, facilitating viral replication. show similar
function mir-132 infection monocytes herpes simplex virus-1
(hsv-1) human cytomegalovirus (hcmv). mir-132 regulates innate antiviral
immunity inhibiting expression p300 transcriptional co-activator. p300 
is downregulated early kshv infection, inhibition mir-132 induction 
restores p300 expression. furthermore, p300 regulates mir-132 levels, revealing a
dynamic equilibrium mir-132 p300. targeting p300, rather a
transcription factor signalling protein, mir-132 broad role the
regulation antiviral immunity.
