objective: liver biopsy necessary grade stage chronic hepatitis c
virus (hcv) infection. previous study patients nonalcoholic liver
disease, aspartate aminotransferase (ast) alanine aminotransferase (alt)
ratio >1 suggested cirrhosis. sought examine value ast/alt ratio
in distinguishing cirrhotic patients chronic hcv infection noncirrhotic
patients correlate ratio grade stage hepatitis and
other biochemical indices.
methods: retrospectively studied 139 patients chronic hcv infection.
routine biochemical indices determined, histological grade of
necroinflammatory activity stage fibrosis liver biopsy
specimens scored.
results: mean ast/alt ratio cirrhotic patients (n = 47) higher
than noncirrhotic patients (n = 92) (1.06 +/- 0.06 vs 0.60 +/- 0.09; p <
0.001). ratio > =1 100% specificity positive predictive value in
distinguishing cirrhotic noncirrhotic patients, 53.2% sensitivity and
80.7% negative predictive value. ratio correlated positively stage
of fibrosis grade activity biochemical indices. of
the cirrhotic patients, 17% clinical biochemical features suggestive of
chronic liver disease except ast/alt ratio > =1.
conclusion: ast/alt ratio dependable marker fibrosis stage and
cirrhosis patients chronic hcv infection.
