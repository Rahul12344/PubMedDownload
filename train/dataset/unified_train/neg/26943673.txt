cd8 cells involved pathogen clearance infection-induced pathology in
respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) infection. studying bulk responses masks the
contribution individual cd8 cell subsets protective immunity and
immunopathology. particular, roles subdominant responses are
potentially beneficial host rarely appreciated focus on
magnitude instead quality response. here, evaluating cd8 cell
responses cb6f1 hybrid mice, multiple epitopes recognized, we
found numerically subdominant cd8 cell response dbm187 epitope
of virus matrix protein expressed high avidity tcr enhanced signaling
pathways associated cd8 cell effector functions. dbm187 effector
cell lysed infected targets per cell basis numerically
dominant kdm282 cells, controlled virus replication efficiently with
less pulmonary inflammation illness previously well-characterized
kdm282 cell response. data suggest clinical outcome viral
infections determined integrated functional properties variety 
responding cd8 cells, highest magnitude response may not
necessarily best terms benefit host. understanding to
induce highly efficient functional cells would inform strategies for
designing vaccines intended provide cell-mediated immunity.
