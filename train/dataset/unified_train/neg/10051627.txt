"natural" igs, mainly igm, comprise part innate immune system present in
healthy individuals, including antigen-free mice. igs thought delay 
pathogenicity infecting agents antigen-induced high affinity igs 
isotypes produced. previous studies suggested acquired humoral
response arises directly innate response, i.e., b cells expressing 
natural igm, upon antigen encounter, differentiate give rise cells
that secrete high amounts igm cells undergo affinity maturation
and isotype switching. however, using murine model influenza virus
infection, demonstrate b cells produce natural antiviral
igm neither increase igm production undergo isotype switching igg2a 
in response infection. cells distinct b cells that
produce antiviral response encounter pathogen. data
therefore demonstrate innate acquired humoral immunities to
influenza virus separate effector arms immune system antigen 
exposure per se sufficient increase natural antibody production.
