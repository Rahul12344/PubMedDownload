the equine herpesvirus type-1 (ehv-1) strain kentucky (kya) long history 
of repeated passage either vivo syrian hamster vitro mouse l-m
fibroblast tissue culture. repeated passage cells the
natural host caused genomic alterations kya chromosome resulting in
deletion several genes portions open reading frames (orfs). report 
presents vivo data mouse model ehv-1 infection demonstrating the
attenuated nature ehv-1 strain kya intranasal infection kya
protects animals subsequent challenge pathogenic strain, racl, by
reducing racl viral titers lungs challenged animals. mice infected 
with kya exhibit clinical manifestations ehv-1 disease not
experience wasting occurs racl infection. kya-infected mice clear
virus lung day 5 post-infection (p.i.), whereas racl infected mice
have substantial virus titers (5 x 10(5) pfu/lung) time point. intranasal
infection kya followed challenge racl 4 weeks post-kya infection
resulted significant (p = 0.0079) reduction lung titers racl
virus. racl identified virus present lungs challenged
mice pcr assay employing primers amplify eus4 gene differs in
size 1.2 kilobase pairs (kbp) two strains. importantly, protection 
afforded kya long lasting challenge racl 15 months kya
infection, results reduced virus titers viral clearance day 5
post-challenge. results support consideration ehv-1 kya a
live virus vaccine.
