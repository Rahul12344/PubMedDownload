the rna belladonna mottle virus (bdmv) released virions increasing 
the ph neutrality above, leaving behind intact protein shells. contrast,
much harsher conditions required release rna closely related 
turnip yellow mosaic virus (tymv). heat-induced ph-dependent escape rna
from bdmv investigated 31p nmr spectroscopy ultracentrifugation. 
the methods show transition ph near 6.8 rna undergoes structural
alteration probably caused disruption protein-rna linkages. addition of
cations polyamines bdmv prevents rna loss alkaline ph; virions
become stable ph values 11.5 observed tymv. suggest that
repulsion negatively charged phosphate groups nucleic acid provides
the driving force rna release ph values threshold point where
protein-rna interactions broken. polyamines effectively counter the
phosphate charge bdmv thereby prevent rna loss. since tymv packaged
with polyamines bdmv (r. virudachalam, k. sitaraman, k. l. heuss, p.
argos, j. l. markley, virology 130, 360-371, 1983), different conditions 
required rna escape two viruses explained. heating bdmv
virions ph 7.0 40 degrees resulted partial disruption; product
some intact particles, empty capsids, rna fragments sedimentation
