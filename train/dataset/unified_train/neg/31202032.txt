hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection one leading causes morbidity and
mortality worldwide. mortality linked hcv infection lowered with
effective prompt diagnosis early stages infection. study
potential raman spectroscopy differentiate healthy hcv infected
serum samples investigated. clear differences observed raman
spectra hcv infected healthy sera samples. using analysis variance 
(anova) t-test (p < 0.001) raman spectra diseased healthy samples, 
we observed eleven unique raman bands 676, 825, 853, 936, 1029, 1105, 1155,
1305, 1620, 1654 1757 cm-1 associated hcv infected sera have
not reported earlier studies. addition, six raman bands 556, 585,
716, 815, 1273 1142 cm-1were observed healthy sera only. three raman bands
at 1330, 1526 1572 cm-1 observed type samples their
intensity drastically reduced diseased samples. various multivariate
analysis techniques employed demonstrate robustness results.
we employed multivariate unsupervised principal component analysis (pca) in
conjunction supervised classification linear discriminant analysis (lda),
using ten-fold jackknife cross-validation, order develop effective
diagnostic algorithm technique (pca-lda). pca-lda model yielded sufficient
sensitivity specificity i.e. correctly identified infected samples
included study. results indicate unique raman bands 
the potential used biomarkers optical diagnosis hcv infection.
