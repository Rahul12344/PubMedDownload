a major risk factor hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) hepatitis b virus
(hbv), whose pathogenesis exacerbated acquisition mutations that
accelerate carcinogenesis. examined, mass spectrometry, temporality
of hbv 1762(t)/1764(a) double mutation plasma tumors. initial studies
found 52 70 (74.3%) tumors patients residing qidong, people's
republic china, contained hbv mutation. paired plasma samples were
available six tumor specimens; four tumors hbv 1762(t)/1764(a)
mutation, whereas three paired plasma samples also positive. the
potential predictive value biomarker explored using stored plasma 
samples study 120 residents qidong monitored for
aflatoxin exposure hbv infection. 10 years passive follow-up, 
were six cases major liver disease including hcc (four cases), hepatitis (one 
case), cirrhosis (one case). six cases detectable levels hbv
1762(t)/1764(a) mutation 8 years diagnosis. finally, 15 liver
cancers selected prospective cohort 1,638 high-risk individuals in
qidong basis available plasma samples spanning years and
after diagnosis. hbv 1762(t)/1764(a) mutation detected 8 15
cases (53.3%) cancer. persistence detection mutation was
statistically significant (p = 0.022, two-tailed). therefore found a
prediagnosis biomarker specific hbv mutations measured plasma and
suggest marker use intermediate endpoint prevention and
intervention trials.
