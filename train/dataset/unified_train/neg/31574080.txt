antagonistic interactions drive host-virus evolutionary arms races, often
manifest recurrent amino acid changes (i.e., positive selection) their
protein-protein interaction interfaces. here, investigated whether
combinatorial mutagenesis positions positive selection host
antiviral protein could enhance restrictive properties. tested
approximately 700 variants human mxa, generated combinatorial mutagenesis, 
for ability restrict thogotovirus (thov). identified mxa
super-restrictors increased binding thov nucleoprotein (np) target
protein 10-fold higher anti-thov restriction relative wild-type human mxa,
the potent naturally occurring anti-thov restrictor identified. findings
reveal means elicit super-restrictor antiviral proteins leveraging
signatures positive selection. although mxa super-restrictors thov
were impaired restriction h5n1 influenza virus (iav), other
super-restrictor variants increased thov restriction without impairment iav
restriction. thus, broadly acting antiviral proteins mxa mitigate
breadth-versus-specificity trade-offs could otherwise constrain their
adaptive landscape.
