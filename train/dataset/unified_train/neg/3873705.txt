human t-lymphotropic virus type iii (htlv-iii) thought play etiologic
role development acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids). in
this study serologic characterization new simian retrovirus is
related htlv-iii described. new virus, referred stlv-iii,
was isolated sick macaques new england regional primate research
center. radioimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed stlv-iii-specific proteins 
160, 120, 55, 24 kilodaltons, similar size major gag env
proteins htlv-iii. antigens recognized representative macaque
serum samples human reference serum samples positive htlv-iii antibodies.
monoclonal antibodies directed p24, major core protein htlv-iii, also
immunoprecipitated 24-kilodalton species lysates cells infected 
macaque virus. htlv-iii-related virus, naturally infects nonhuman
primate species, may provide useful model study htlv-iii the
pathogenesis aids.
