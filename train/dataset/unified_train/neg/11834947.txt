objective: study long-term immunological recovery hiv-1-infected
individuals receiving potent antiretroviral therapy (art).
design: prospective, observational study.
methods: plasma hiv-1 rna, cd4 cd8 lymphocyte counts determined 3-6
monthly intervals 95 hiv-1-infected subjects receiving art suppressed
plasma hiv-1 rna levels 400 copies/ml median observation period
of 45 months.
results: median cd4 cell count rose 325 624 cells/microl 48
months, increasing 22.6 cells/microl per month first 3 months, 8.1
cells/microl per month months 3 12, 6.8 cells/microl per month the
second year, 3.3 cells/microl per month third, 1.7 cells/microl per
month fourth year. 48 months, 98% subjects reached cd4 cell counts >
200 cells/microl, 86% > 350 cells/microl, 74% > 500 cells/microl. higher
nadir cd4 cell count younger age independently associated greater
increases cd4 cell counts, higher absolute cd4 cell counts 48 months.
poor immunological responders reach 500 cd4 lymphocytes/microl 48 
months showed lower nadir baseline cd4 cell counts good responders (99
versus 300 cells/microl 160 versus 373 cells/microl, respectively).
conclusion: recovery cd4 lymphocytes occurs mainly first 2 years 
after initiation art, associated age pre-existing
degree hiv-1-related immunodeficiency, suggesting long-term exposure 
to hiv-1 infection caused damage immune system difficult to
correct.
