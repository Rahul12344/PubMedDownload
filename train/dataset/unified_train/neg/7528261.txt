immune reactivities blood donor sera peptides various lengths (24,
30, 40 50 mer) genotypic sequence variations n-terminal
portion core protein hepatitis c virus (hcv) compared by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. found 40-mer oligopeptide
(amino acids 2-41) recognized frequently peptides even in
serum samples react c22-3 (core) recombinant
immunoblot assay (riba-ii). hand, 30-mer peptide (amino acids
1-30) good correlation viremia confirmed polymerase chain
reaction (pcr). addition, four individuals showed obvious differences in
the immune responses 30-mer oligopeptides representing 4 genotypic
variations. result, samples pcr-positive nonreactive a
commercial assay found react short synthetic peptides the
n-terminal portion core protein.
