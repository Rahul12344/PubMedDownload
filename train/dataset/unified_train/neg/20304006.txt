ataxin-1 part larger family polyglutamine-containing proteins 
linked nine distinct neurodegenerative disorders. known effective
therapies expanded polyglutamine tract disorders. one possible
reason lack sufficient amounts pure
polyglutamine-containing proteins suitable biochemical conformational
studies. here, show able successfully purify a
non-pathological, wild-type human ataxin-1 protein containing 30-glutamine
repeat sequence. ataxin-1 protein expressed escherichia coli a
fusion protein gst tag n-terminus double (his)(6) tag 
c-terminus. devised dual affinity tag strategy allowed successful
purification full-length ataxin-1 fusion protein 90% homogeneity as
confirmed western blot analysis using two monoclonal ataxin-1 antibodies
developed laboratory. addition, gst tag successfully removed
from purified ataxin-1 fusion protein treatment tobacco etch virus
(tev) protease. since polyglutamine-containing proteins tend aggregate,
solvents/buffers minimize aggregation used purification
process. dual affinity purification protocol could serve useful basis
for purifying aggregation-prone proteins involved other
neurodegenerative diseases.
