two proteins encoded bacteriophage t7, gene 2.5 single-stranded dna
binding protein gene 4 helicase, mediate homologous dna strand exchange. 
gene 2.5 protein stimulates homologous base pairing two dna molecules
containing complementary single-stranded regions. formation joint
molecule consisting circular, single-stranded m13 dna, annealed homologous 
linear, duplex dna 3'- 5'-single-stranded termini approximately 100 
nucleotides requires stoichiometric amounts gene 2.5 protein. presence 
of gene 4 helicase, strand transfer proceeds rate > 120 nucleotides/s 
a polar 5' 3' direction respect invading strand, resulting 
production circular duplex m13 dna. strand transfer coupled the
hydrolysis nucleoside 5'-triphosphate. reaction dependent specific
interactions gene 2.5 protein gene 4 protein.
