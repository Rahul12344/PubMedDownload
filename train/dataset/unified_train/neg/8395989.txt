1. antiviral activity heliothis virescens larval hemolymph determined
using cytotoxicity/virus inhibition test (tcld50) done vero cell tissue
cultures. excellent antiviral activity found especially herpes
simplex viruses-1 -2 also vesicular stomatitis, parainfluenza-3, 
coxsackie b3 sindbis viruses. 2. prolonged incubation herpes simplex
virus-1 vesicular stomatitis virus hemolymph virucidal greatly
reduced infectivity two viruses tissue culture. 3. antiviral activity
was produced normal immune (vaccinated larvae) cell-free hemolymphs. 
4. antiviral activity herpes simplex virus-1 could generated vitro 
with hemolymph phenoloxidase mushroom tyrosinase using four different
substrates including tyrosine. 5. activation insect melanization reaction 
by phenoloxidase necessary antiviral activity occur.
