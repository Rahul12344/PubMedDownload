dendritic cells (dc) potent professional antigen-presenting cells can
activate naive lymphocytes initiate cellular immune responses. as
adjuvants, dc may useful enhancing immunogenicity tumor antigens and
mediating tumor regression. endogenous expression antigen dc offers the
potential advantage allowing prolonged constitutive presentation of
endogenously processed epitopes exploitation multiple restriction elements
for presentation antigen. report, show human dc
are (a) capable infection recombinant poxviruses encoding
melanoma-associated antigen (maa) genes (b) capable efficiently processing
and presenting maa cytotoxic cells. 6/6 hla a*0201-expressing
melanoma patients tested, virally driven expression mart-1/melan maa 
dc sufficient generate cd8+ lymphocytes could recognize naturally
processed epitopes tumor cells. cases, specific anti-mart-1 reactivity

responses. clinical implications active immunization therapy, and
currently vaccine trials proposed patients metastatic
