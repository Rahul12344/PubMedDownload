transgenic (tg) mice, bearing simian virus 40 t-antigen (tag) 6-kb
fragment murine inhibin alpha-subunit promoter (inhalpha), develop gonadal
tumors granulosa leydig cell origin 100% penetrance age 5-7 
months. tg mice gonadectomized prepubertally, 21-25 days 
of life, adrenal gland tumors observed mouse age 5-7
months. adrenal tumors detected intact tg, gonadectomized or
intact control non-tg littermates. adrenocortical tumors appeared to
originate x-zone adrenal cortex. functional gonadectomy was
induced gnrh antagonist treatment cross-breeding tg mice into
hypogonadotropic hpg genetic background, neither gonadal adrenal
tumorigenesis appeared. prompted hypothesis adrenal tumor development
in inhalpha/tag tg mice related elevated gonadotropin secretion, is
the obvious difference surgical functional gonadectomy
models. adrenal tumors cell line (calpha1) derived them, found
to express luteinizing hormone receptor (lhr), fshr, hcg treatment
stimulated proliferation. fshr found adrenal glands. the
basis suggested expression potent oncogene t-antigen, 
allow lh adrenocortical cells function tumor promoter, induction
of high level functional lhr expression adrenal tumors. given induction of
expression regulation gata-4 gata-6 zinc finger family of
transcription factors gonads gonadotropins, interest to
explore expression adrenals. utilized inalpha/tag tg mouse
model pathological human adrenal samples explore role gata-4 and
gata-6 adrenocortical tumorigenesis. abundant gata-6 mrna expression found
in normal control adrenal cortex mouse development, whereas gata-4 mrna
was undetectable. striking contrast this, gata-6 absent murine
adrenocortical tumors, gata-4 mrna expression dramatically upregulated 
in murine adrenal tumors well human adrenocortical carcinomas. taken
together, results suggest different roles gata-4 gata-6 the
adrenal gland, implicate gata-4 adrenal lhr expression tumorigenesis. 
immunohistochemical detection gata-4 may serve useful marker in
differential diagnosis human adrenal tumors. addition, inhalpha/tag tg 
model helpful exploring molecular mechanisms underlying
adrenocortical tumorigenesis, ectopic lhr expression adrenals the
gata-4/lhr interaction related adrenal tumorigenesis tg mice.
