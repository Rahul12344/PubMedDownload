summary: assessed safety surrogate markers' effect acemannan 
adjunctive antiretroviral therapy among patients advanced hiv disease
receiving zidovudine (zdv) didanosine (ddi) randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial acemannan (400 mg orally four times daily). eligible 
patients either sex cd4 counts 50-300/microl twice within 1 month of
study entry received 26 months antiretroviral treatment (zdv ddi)
at stable dose month entry. cd4 counts made every 4 weeks
for 48 weeks. p24 antigen measured entry every 12 weeks thereafter.
sequential quantitative lymphocyte cultures hiv zdv pharmacokinetics were
performed subset patients. sixty-three patients randomized. were
males (mean age 39 years). mean baseline cd4 counts 165 147/microl
in placebo acemannan groups, respectively; 90 percent patients
were receiving zdv entry. six patients acemannan group five 
placebo group developed aids-defining illnesses. statistically
significant difference groups 48 weeks regard absolute
change rate decline cd4 count. among zdv-treated patients, median
rates cd4 change (acd4) initial 16 weeks - 121 - 120 cells per
year placebo acemannan groups, respectively ( p = 0.45), acd4 from
week 16 48 0 - 61 cells per year acemannan placebo groups
(p = .11), respectively. statistical difference groups 
regard adverse events, p24 antigen, quantitative virology, or
pharmacokinetics. twenty-four patients, 11 receiving placebo 13 receiving
acemannan, discontinued study therapy prematurely, none due serious adverse
reactions. results demonstrate acemannan oral daily dose 1600
mg prevent decline cd4 count characteristic progressive hiv
disease. acemannan showed significant effect p24 antigen quantitative
virology. acemannan well tolerated showed significant pharmacokinetic 
interaction zdv.
