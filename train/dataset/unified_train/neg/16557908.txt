high titers interferon induced psittacosis agent guinea pig
leukocyte cultures. optimal yields interferon produced freshly
prepared guinea pig leukocyte cultures containing 4 x 10(6) cells per ml
inoculated psittacosis/cell multiplicity 1.0 incubated 35 c 
24 hr. leukocytes obtained 2- 4-month-old guinea pigs produced 20 times
more interferon leukocytes 3- 4-week-old animals. biological
activity interferon kinetics production from
psittacosis-infected guinea pig leukocyte cultures similar reported
for virus-induced leukocyte interferons.
