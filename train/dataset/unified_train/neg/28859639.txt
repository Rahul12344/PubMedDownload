background: study highlights shedding pattern senecavirus (sva)
during outbreak vesicular disease sow farm south-central
minnesota, usa. study, 34 individual, mixed parity sows clinical
signs vesicular lesions 30 individual piglets 15 individual litters
from sows vesicular lesions conveniently selected individual,
longitudinal sampling. serum, tonsil, rectal, vesicular swabs collected 
on day1 post outbreak, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 weeks post
outbreak. samples tested university minnesota veterinary
diagnostic laboratory sva via real time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)
results: sows, vesicular lesions highest concentration sva, had
the shortest duration detection lasting 2 weeks. viremia detected for
1 week post outbreak, quickly declined thereafter. sva detected at
approximately frequency tonsil rectal swabs the
highest percentage sva positive samples detected first 6 weeks post
outbreak. suckling piglets, viremia quickly declined 1 week post outbreak 
was prevalent low levels first week weaning (4 weeks post
outbreak) also detected piglets co-mingled sva
negative sow farm. similar sows, sva detection rectal tonsil swabs in
piglets lasted approximately 6 weeks post outbreak.
conclusion: study illustrates variation sva shedding patterns in
different sample types 9 week period sows piglets, suggests the
potential viral spread piglets weaning.
