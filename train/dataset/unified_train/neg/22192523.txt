background: reporter genes often used selectable marker generation
of recombinant viruses order investigate mechanism pathogenesis 
to obtain candidate vaccine viruses. routine selection recombinant
parapoxvirus time-consuming labor intensive. therefore, developing novel
method selection critical.
results: study, developed rapid method generate recombinant orf
viruses (orfv) based enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) reporter
gene selectable marker. coding sequence egfp gene amplified 
pegfp-n1 vector subcloned pzippy-neo/gus plasmid control
of early-late vaccinia virus (vacv) vv7.5 promoter flanked two
multiple cloning sites (mcs) generate novel transfer vector pspv-egfp. using
the pspv-egfp, two recombination cassettes pspv-113lf-egfp-113rf and
pspv-116lf-egfp-116rf constructed cloning flanking regions the
orfv113 orfv116 inserted two mcs flanking egfp gene. using 
novel system, two single gene deletion mutants ov-ia82δ113 ov-ia82δ116 were
successfully generated.
conclusions: approach shortens time needed generate recombinant orfvs
(rorfvs). thus, pspv-egfp vector provides direct, fast, convenient way 
to manipulate recombinant viruses, indicating highly suited for
its designed purpose.
