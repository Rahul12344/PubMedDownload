objectives: aims study compare findings fluorescence
in situ hybridization (fish) detection human telomerase rna gene (hterc)
amplification cytological human papillomavirus (hpv) dna tests
and explore possibility improve accuracy diagnoses of
high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) cervical cancer.
methods: total 201 specimens liquid-based thin-layer cytological
examination findings collected detected hpv dna test hterc
detected fish. women underwent colposcopy histological examination 
biopsy specimen needed. 3 screening methods compared based on
histological examination colposcopic biopsies.
results: amplification hterc showed 6.06% normal inflammation cases,
10.00% cin 1, 66.67% cin 2, 72.50% cin 3, 100.00% carcinoma, with
significant difference low- (<or=cin 1 <or=low-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesion) high-grade (>or=cin 2 >or=atypical squamous cells 
in high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cannot excluded) cervical 
lesions (p < 0.001). hterc amplification rate consistent abnormal
rates cytological histological diagnoses. detection hterc
amplification much higher accuracy (87.56%) cytological (80.10%)
and hpv dna test (77.61%) findings.
conclusions: using fish detect amplification hterc much higher
specificity accuracy diagnoses high-grade cin cervical cancer 
than cytological hpv dna test findings, suggesting detection might 
be useful specific screening method cervical cancer precancerous
lesions.
