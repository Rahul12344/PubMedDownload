a flow cytometric assay developed detect quantitate human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained
from hiv-seropositive patients. peripheral blood obtained patients
attending acquired immune deficiency syndrome clinic, mononuclear cells
were separated centrifugation onto ficoll-hypaque. cell layer the
interface removed, washed phosphate-buffered saline without ca2+ mg2+,
and fixed 90% methanol, intracellular hiv antigens detected by
indirect immunofluorescence monoclonal antibodies hiv antigens the
primary antibody fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse
immunoglobulin g f(ab')2 antibody secondary antibody. dna content was
determined propidium diiodide staining rnase treatment. these
fluorochrome-treated cells analyzed two-color fluorescence flow
cytometry. results showed hiv-infected cells peripheral blood that
have treated monoclonal antibodies p24 nef antigens hiv
can detected quantitated flow cytometry. percentage p24
antigen-positive mononuclear cells significant correlation (p = 0.0001)
with clinical status patient, i.e., high percentage of
p24 antigen-positive cells poorer prognosis lower
percentage p24 antigen-positive mononuclear cells. addition, in
centers disease control groups iii iv, inverse correlation
between percentage p24 antigen-positive mononuclear cells number
of t4 cells. however, cell-associated antigen detection flow cytometry not
correlate detection antigen sera hiv-seropositive patients the
standard antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. lack of
correlation probably due presence immune complexes sera of
hiv-seropositive patients. results suggest flow cytometry used 
as rapid, sensitive, quantitative assay system determination the
antigen status hiv-seropositive patients may useful 
indicator disease progression currently used antigen detection
methods.
