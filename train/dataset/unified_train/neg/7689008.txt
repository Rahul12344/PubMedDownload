we analyzed cftr mrna populations cystic fibrosis patient
heterozygous 621 + 1g-->t 711 + 1g-->t mutations. total rna isolated 
from nasal epithelial cells epstein-barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts
derived patient reversely transcribed region extending from
exon 3 exon 7 gene amplified polymerase chain reaction and
analyzed. three abnormal products identified, suggesting presence of
three aberrant transcripts, profiles identical cell types.
two products found missing either exon 4 exon 5 as
anticipated transcripts 621 + 1g-->t 711 + 1g-->t alleles,
respectively. third product apparently derived alternatively
spliced mrna species absence nominal splice site (in 621 + 1g-->t) 
through use cryptic splice donor sequence (tt528/gtgagg) within exon 4. 
although reading frames appeared preserved three putative
transcripts, significant portions presumed first second transmembrane 
spans well immediately following cytoplasmic domain would deleted
from mutant cftr polypeptides, made. observations consistent
with loss cftr function cystic fibrosis patient.
