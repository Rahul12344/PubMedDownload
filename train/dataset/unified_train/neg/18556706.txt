objectives: describe hiv-1 variants circulating mali estimate the
rate transmission hiv-1 drug resistance 2006.
patients methods: viral reverse transcriptase (rt) protease (pr) genes
from 198 antiretroviral (arv)-naive patients diagnosed hiv-1 positive may 2006
in bamako segou sequenced.
results: although crf02_ag always predominant hiv-1 subtype observed
(72%), higher genetic diversity 2005 observed. overall
prevalence primary resistance 11.5% mali 2006, according 2007 
ias-usa list mutations [nucleoside rt inhibitor (nrti): 1.5%, non-nrti
(nnrti): 9% pi: 1%], 2.5% (nrti: 1%, nnrti: 1.5% pi: 0%), according
to stanford list mutations. significant difference between
2005 2006 overall primary resistance prevalence prevalence
of mutations different arv classes. resistance mutations found rt and
pr genes agreement highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen
available mali, except v90i, v106i a98g mutations associated
with etravirine resistance, polymorphic non-b subtypes.
conclusions: hiv-1 genetic diversity seems increased mali, overall
hiv-1 primary resistance prevalence remains low. consistent the
findings west african countries prevalence rates lower 
5%. however, considering large scaling arv use country, is
necessary regularly monitor development primary resistance mali.
