chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection associated spectrum liver 
diseases proportion chronic cases progress cirrhosis to
hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). viral host factors important 
the clinical histological progression hcv infection unclear. we
investigated effect moderate (<80 g/day) heavy (>80 g/day) alcohol
intake histological clinical progression hcv infection their
associated risk hepatic cancer group japanese patients. number of
other variables assessed evaluate impact disease progression. we
recruited 120 patients hcv infection categorized four groups, 
based alcohol consumption pattern. clinical biochemical profiles 
collected recorded files. liver biopsies analysed degree of
fibrosis, presence cirrhosis histological activity necroinflammation.
hepatic tumours detected follow-up imaging analysis. no
difference age, length exposure hcv infection hcv rna serum
levels alcohol alcohol-free groups. histological grading of
necroinflammation, serum levels alanine aminotransferase hcv rna not
have correlation alcohol alcohol-free group. there
was 1.5-2. 5-fold greater risk liver cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma 
in alcohol intake group compared alcohol-free group. kruskal-wallis
analysis among four groups demonstrated significant transition fibrosis (p <
0.05) alcoholics hcv infection. increased risk liver cancer in
the alcohol group independent size growth tumours. clinical
manifestations gastro-oesophageal variceal bleeding, ascites, and
encephalopathy also higher alcohol intake group. alcohol consumption 
is important risk factor histological clinical progression hcv
infection relation hcv replication. chronic hcv carriers should
avoid excessive alcohol intake reduce acceleration liver disease and
risk liver cancer.
