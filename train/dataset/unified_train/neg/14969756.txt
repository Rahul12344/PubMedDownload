bioadhesins recognised method enhancing absorption drugs and
vaccines mucosal surfaces. additionally, bioadhesins allow cell specific
targeting. lectin-mediated targeting delivery exploits unique surface
carbohydrates mucosal epithelial cells. antigen-sampling cells offer a
portal absorption colloidal particulate delivery vehicles, including
bacteria, viruses inert microparticles. review work supporting use 
lectins aid targeting intestinal cells. consideration also given to
lectin-mediated targeting non-intestinal sites potential
application bioadhesins enhance cell transport. substantial
hurdles must overcome mucosal bioadhesins guarantee consistent,
safe, effective mucosal delivery, strategy offers novel opportunities for
drug vaccine formulation.
