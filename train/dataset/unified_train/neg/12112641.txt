background: control transgene expression mammalian cells desirable for
gene therapy study gene function basic research. study
evaluates functionality single adenovirus (ad) vectors containing a
tetracycline-controllable expression system (tet-off tet-on system).
methods: ad-mediated binary transgene expression system generated
containing tet-off tet-on system, introduced gene interest
with tetracycline-regulatable promoter tetracycline-responsive
transcriptional activator gene e1 e3 deletion regions, respectively.
the functionality ad-mediated tet-off tet-on systems compared
under various conditions vitro vivo.
results: ad vector containing tet-off system provided negative control of
gene expression ranging 20- 500-fold, depending cell type and
condition. contrast, ad vector containing tet-on system increased gene
expression 2- 28-fold required two-log orders higher
concentration inducer (doxycycline) switch gene expression,
compared ad vector containing tet-off system.
conclusion: ad vectors containing tet-off system better choice for
regulated gene expression ad vectors containing tet-on system. single ad
vectors containing tetracycline-controllable expression system greatly
facilitate vitro vivo analyses gene function may useful for
gene therapy.
