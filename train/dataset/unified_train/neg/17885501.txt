long considered ectopic breast tissue, anogenital mammary-like glands (mlgs)
have recently suggested represent distinctive structures located the
anogenital area. studied 16 neoplasms anogenital mlg human
papillomavirus (hpv) dna using inno-line probe assay (lipa) hpv genotyping kit,
gp5+/6+, cp(sgb), fap 6085-6319 primer sets. lesions included 3
fibroadenomas, 2 adenosis tumors, 1 invasive ductal carcinoma, 1 tubulolobular
carcinoma, 2 hidradenoma papilliferum prominent cystic change rendering a
cystadenoma appearance oxyphilic metaplasia, 7 cases extramammary
paget disease. 3 fibroadenomas, adenosis tumors, hidradenoma
papilliferum, tubulolobular carcinoma proved negative hpv dna. hpv-31
was detected lipa case invasive ductal carcinoma. 2 7
patients extramammary paget disease, hpv dna present the
lesional tissue, typed hpv-6 (lipa) type closely related to
hpv-21 hpv-24 (fap 6085-6319), whereas remaining 5 cases tested negative.
these results coupled obtained literature review suggest hpv
plays causative role lesions anogenital mlg.
