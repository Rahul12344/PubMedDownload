porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome viruses (prrsvs) classified
into 2 distinct genotypes: north american type european type. the
japanese prrsvs genotyped reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
using reported primer pairs either reactive types, specific
to north american type specific european type. prrsv
genomes 66 tissue homogenates sera 55 infectious viruses 
north american type, whereas european-type viral genome detected. two pcr 
primers specific north american type showed different detection
efficiency. half tissue samples 15% infectious viruses not
detected one primer pair, although detected 
primer pair. nucleotide sequencing analysis forward-and reverse
primer-binding sites nonreactive viruses indicated viruses 
had nucleotide mismatches within 4 bases corresponding 3' end the
reverse primer. mismatches appeared responsible nonreactivity
of former primers viruses.
