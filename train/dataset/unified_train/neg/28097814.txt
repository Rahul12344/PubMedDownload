control measures foot mouth disease (fmd) nigeria been
implemented due absence locally produced vaccines risk-based
analysis resulting insufficient data circulating fmd virus (fmdv)
serotypes/strains. 2013-2015, blood epithelial samples collected from
reported fmd outbreaks four states (kaduna, kwara, plateau bauchi) in
northern nigeria. fmdv non-structural protein (nsp) seroprevalence the
outbreaks estimated 80% (72 90) 70% (131 188) post-outbreak.
antibodies fmdv serotypes o, a, sat1, sat2 sat3 detected across 
the states using solid-phase competitive elisa. fmdv genome detected 99%
(73 74) samples fmd-affected animals using rrt-pcr, cytopathic
effect found cell culture 59% (44 74) samples. three fmdv
serotypes o, sat2 isolated characterized. phylogenetic
assessments virus isolates showed two topotypes fmdv serotype o,
east africa-3 (ea-3) west africa (wa) topotypes circulating, well 
fmdv strains belonging africa genotype (g-iv) serotype fmdv sat2 
topotype vii strains. serotype (ea-3) strains nigeria 
closely related 1999 virus strain sudan, wa strain nigeria
shares genetic relationship three 1988 viruses niger. fmdv serotype a
strains closely related known virus cameroon, sat2 strains
were closely related virus subtypes libya. study provides
evidence co-occurrence fmdv serotypes topotypes west, central, east 
and north africa, implication control. findings help filling
the knowledge gap fmdv dynamics nigeria west africa subregion to
support local regional development vaccination-based control plans and
international risk assessment.
