the immunogenicity leukemia l1210 dba/2 ha 6c3hed lymphosarcoma tumor
cells c3h/f mice significantly increased treatment v. cholerae 
neuraminidase. dba/2 ha c3h/f mice repeatedly immunized with
neuraminidase-treated tumor cells rejected subsequent challenge 10(7) 10(6)
untreated tumor cells, respectively. based 51cr microcytotoxicity assay,
both strains mice showed strong complement-dependent antibody titers and
cell-mediated immunity. sera splenic lymphocytes immunized c3h/f mice
neutralized tumorigenicity 6c3hed lymphosarcoma protected the
recipient c3h/f mice disease. immune lymphocytes pretreated with
anti-theta sera lost ability neutralize tumorigenicity of
lymphosarcoma, failed stimulated t-cell mitogens. studied
the effectiveness chemoimmunotherapy dba/2 ha mice leukemia l1210. a
single near optimal dose bcnu 2 days implantation 10(6) tumor cells
increased survival time. single immunization 2 x 10(7)
neuraminidase-treated l1210 tumor cells 4 days cytoreductive therapy
increased survival resulted cures 50% animals. immunization mice
with neuraminidase-treated tumor cells mer produced indefinite survival 
larger percentage mice either treatment alone. akr mice with
spontaneous leukemia treated combination chemotherapy sustained 180%
increase life-span. combination chemotherapy plus immunization with
neuraminidase-treated syngeneic allogeneic (gross virus-induced) e2g leukemia 
cells highly effective prolonging life-span immunized leukemic
akr mice. experimental data led clinical trials acute myelocytic
leukemia neuraminidase-treated a-logeneic myeloblasts. patients acute
myelocytic leukemia randomized two groups remission induction.
the median remission duration patients sustaining chemotherapy alone 19
weeks (8 patients), whereas six nine patients received
neuraminidase-treated allogeneic myeloblasts remain remission 79-132 weeks.
statistical analysis remission duration survival patients who
received chemoimmunotherapy versus control group shows highly significant
differences.
