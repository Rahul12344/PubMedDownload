while cell surface antigens represent common targets antibody-based 
cancer therapy, isolation new antibodies specific targets from
single-chain fv phage display libraries hindered limitations
associated traditional selection techniques. solid phase panning often
associated conformational changes target protein due its
immobilization plastic tubes limit ability isolated scfv
to bind conformational epitopes solution panning methods require use
of secondary tags often mask desired sequences create unintended
epitopes. commonly utilized cell-based panning methods typically yield panel of
single-chain fv (scfv) molecules specific numerous cell surface
antigens, often obscuring desired clones. here, describe novel cell
sorter-based system isolate single-chain fv molecules specific defined
antigen targets expressed stably-transformed mammalian cells. employed
these methods isolate promising scfv clones bind specifically the
m√ºllerian inhibiting substance type ii receptor, cell surface ovarian cancer
antigen proven difficult target selection strategies.
