background: bovine leukemia virus (blv), retrovirus, usually causes a
subclinical infection dairy beef cattle, < 1% infected cattle 
b cell lymphoma may develop several years infection. blv transmitted 
horizontally among cattle, infected animals anti-blv titers. expression 
of blv antigen, however, silent peripheral blood lymphocytes vivo. the
tropism blv assumed limited b lymphocytes, 
cell type found harbor virus vivo. since retrovirus-like
particles identified milk, infection transmitted milk, 
we decided investigate whether blv mammary epithelial cells.
experimental design: pure cultures mammary epithelial cells established
from cells shed milk 28 cows. blv searched cultures by
immunocytochemistry polymerase chain reaction, specificity the
latter confirmed southern blot hybridization dna sequencing. blv was
searched immunocytochemically mammary tissue sections 12 cows.
results: antigenic and/or molecular evidence blv found cultured
cells 20 cows. antigenic evidence blv found tissue sections 10 
cows, indicating virus expression vivo. simultaneous detection blv p24 
cytokeratins, localized antigen expression mammary epithelial cells.
conclusions: indications blv mammary epithelial cells vivo suggest
that blv capable infecting expressing antigen glandular epithelium
in vivo broader tissue tropism previously thought. raise 
the question persistent mammary infection blv may influence course 
of bovine lymphoma, effect virus may mammary gland.
