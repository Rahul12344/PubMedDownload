in previous study generated anti-hepatitis b virus (hbv) pres1 humanized 
antibody (hzkr127) showed vivo hbv-neutralizing activity chimpanzees. 
however, antigen-binding affinity humanized antibody may be
sufficient clinical use thus affinity maturation required better
therapeutic efficacy. study, phage display technique employed to
increase affinity hzkr127. six amino acid residues
(glu95-tyr96-asp97-glu98-ala99-tyr100) heavy (h) chain
complementarydetermining region 3 (hcdr3) hzkr127 randomized and
phage-displayed single chain fv (scfv) library constructed. three
rounds panning, 12 different clones exhibiting higher antigen-binding activity
than wild type scfv selected antigen-binding specificity for
the pres1 confirmed. subsequently, five scfv clones converted whole igg
and subjected affinity determination. results showed two clones (b3
and a19) exhibited approximately 6 fold higher affinities of
hzkr127. affinity-matured humanized antibodies may useful anti-hbv
immunotherapy.
