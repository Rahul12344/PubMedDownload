transmission human herpesvirus 8 (hhv-8), etiological agent kaposi's
sarcoma, occurs mainly childhood endemic countries and, large
extent, intrafamilial contacts. additionally investigate familial
transmission, especially role plasma anti-hhv-8 antibody titers, we
conducted large survey village cameroon, central africa, including 92
families (608 individuals). plasma samples tested specific igg directed 
against hhv-8 lytic antigens immunofluorescence assay, titers were
determined 2-fold dilutions. global hhv-8 seroprevalence 60%, raising from
32% 9 years plateau around 62% 15 40 years. the
familial correlation patterns hhv-8 seropositive/seronegative status showed
strong dependence mother child siblings. contrast, no
familial correlation anti-hhv-8 antibody levels observed among infected
subjects. particular, relationship observed anti-hhv-8
antibody titer hhv-8 seropositive mothers proportion hhv-8
seropositive children. furthermore, random permutation study anti-hhv-8 
antibody titers among hhv-8 infected subjects showed main risk factor
for infection hhv-8 serologic status antibody level. in
addition, correlation found anti-hhv-8 antibody levels buffy
coat hhv-8 viral loads subsample 95 infected subjects. overall, these
results strongly suggest that, highly endemic population central
africa, hhv-8 transmission mainly occurs mother child between
siblings, independent plasma antibody levels hhv-8 infected
relatives.
