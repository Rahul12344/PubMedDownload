chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection prevalent, deadly, seldom cured 
due persistence viral episomal dna (cccdna) infected cells. newly
developed genome engineering tools may offer ability directly cleave viral
dna, thereby promoting viral clearance. here, show crispr/cas9 system
can specifically target cleave conserved regions hbv genome, resulting
in robust suppression viral gene expression replication. upon sustained
expression cas9 appropriately chosen guide rnas, demonstrate cleavage
of cccdna cas9 dramatic reduction cccdna parameters of
viral gene expression replication. thus, show directly targeting
viral episomal dna novel therapeutic approach control virus and
possibly cure patients.
