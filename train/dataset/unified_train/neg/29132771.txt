objectives: describe epidemiology neonatal herpes risk factors,
clinical paraclinic manifestations, propose guidelines newborn risk 
of neonatal herpes, describe treatment modalities, describe post-natal
transmission prevention.
methods: bibliographic search medline, cochrane library databases and
research international clinical practice guidelines.
results: neonatal herpes rare (about 20 cases per year france) mainly
due hsv 1 (level evidence le3). main risk factors mother-to-child
transmission maternal primary episode genital herpes close delivery and
serotype hsv 1 (le3). three clinical forms neonatal herpes : sem
infection skin, eyes mucosa, central nervous system (cns) associated
infection, disseminated infection. neurological mortality morbidity
depend clinical form hsv serotype (le3). case of
neonatal herpes, mothers history genital herpes (le3). fever and
vesicular rash may absent time diagnosis (le3). case suspicion
of neonatal herpes, different samples (blood cerebrospinal fluid) hsv pcr
must carried confirm diagnosis (professional consensus). any
newborn suspected neonatal herpes treated intravenous aciclovir
(grade a) prior results hsv pcr (professional consensus). case of
maternal genital herpes delivery, management asymptomatic newborn
depends evaluation risk transmission. case maternal
reactivation (low risk transmission), hsv pcr samples taken 24hours 
life newborn must follow closely results. case of
maternal primary episode non-primary infection first episode (high risk of
transmission), samples taken 24hours life intravenous treatment
with aciclovir started (professional consensus). treatment neonatal
herpes based intravenous aciclovir (60mg/kg/day divided 3 injections) 
(grade c). duration treatment depends clinical form (14 days
for sem infection, 21 days forms) (professional consensus). a
relay aciclovir per os (300mg/m2/day) 6 months recommended improve
the neurological outcome reduce risk reactivation (grade b).
post-natal transmission mainly due hsv 1. rules prevention of
post-natal transmission must known parents family, also nursing 
staff (professional consensus). breastfeeding contraindicated cases 
maternal herpes, except herpetic lesion nipple (professional
consensus). parents newborns risk neonatal herpes receive
information clinical signs monitored home hospital
discharge (professional consensus).
conclusions: neonatal herpes rare disease high morbidity and
mortality. management newborn risk requires good coordination between
the obstetric pediatric teams parent's information.
