site-specific integration corynephage phi16: construction integration
vector.

moreau s, blanco c, trautwetter a.

phi16, temperate phage induced corynebacterium glutamicum atcc 21792,
lysogenizes host via site-specific recombination. phage attachment site, 
attp, located 6.5 kb bamhi fragment phi16 genome. fragment
also contained phi16 integrative functions. minimal phage dna fragment
required integration defined. 1630 bp region contained large open 
reading frame, int, encoding protein 416 amino acids similarity 
carboxyl-terminal domain tyrosine recombinases particularly xer
recombinases. comparison nucleotide sequences attb, attl, attr, and
attp identified common 29 bp sequence, core sequence. lies 11 bp
downstream 3' end integrase gene. phi16 integrase shown to
catalyse site-specific integration trans attp efficiency 5x10(3)
integrants per microg dna. integrating fragment catalysed integration in
several corynebacterium strains infected phi16, thus enlarging
the host spectrum integrating vectors derived phi16. strains,
the phi16 attb site located conserved intergenic region lies
downstream clp gene.
