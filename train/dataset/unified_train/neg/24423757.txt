hpv vaccination expected reduce incidence cervical cancer. the
greatest earliest health gains ensured high vaccine coverage
among susceptible people. high costs risk reduced
cost/effectiveness ratio sexually active girls still represent main
obstacles widespread use hpv vaccination many countries. data on
the rate, risk factors, hpv types sexually active women could provide
information evaluation vaccination policies extended broader age
cohorts. sexually active women aged 13-26 years enrolled italian cohort
study screened cervical hpv infections; hpv-dna positive samples were
genotyped innolipa hpv genotyping extra rflp genotype analysis.: among
the 796 women meeting inclusion criteria, 10.80% (95% ci 8.65-12.96) were
hpv-dna infected. age>18 years, lifetime sexual partners>1, history stis
were associated higher risk hpv infection multivariable models
adjusted age, lifetime sexual partners, time sexual exposure. the
global prevalence four hpv vaccine-types 3.02% (95% ci 1.83-4.20) 
the cumulative probability infection least one vaccine-type 12.82%
in 26-years-old women 0.78% 18-years-old women.: data confirm 
the previously reported findings risk factors hpv infections. low 
prevalence hpv vaccine-types found may useful evaluation the
