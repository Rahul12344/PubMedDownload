over one century extensive efforts directed towards investigating immune
response immuno-protection associated sexually transmitted
infections failed produce effective vaccines the
major pathogens, among neisseria gonorrhea, herpes simplex virus type 2, and
chlamydia trachomatis. attempts design develop protective vaccines against
them also yielded disappointing results. long felt there
might another yet undiscovered complicating factor, addition the
recognized difficulties, might impeding development successful
vaccines. unlike body organs systems, genital tract the
elements found within (e.g., spermatozoa) endowed unique features,
some associated inherent dna transferability skills as
physiologically required environment. hypothesize a
novel evasion mechanism involves unusual sperm-mediated host-derived dna 
transfer sexually transmitted genital tract microorganisms express
brand new chimeric antigens epitopes and, so, thus evade the
surveillance immune system. hypothesis may describe would the
long-awaited breakthrough search vaccine sexually
transmitted infections. may also assist developing better-designed vaccines
in general, may implications microorganism-related challenges
(e.g., antibiotic resistance).
