background: study evaluated functions matrix metalloproteinase 2
(mmp2) hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) cells assessed effects mmp2
on hcc cell sensitivity cisplatin.
methodology: hepg2 huh7 cells cultured. pre-experiment performed
to explore optimal transduction conditions mmp2-sirna lentivirus
(si-mmp2). quantitative real-time pcr western blot assays performed to
measure expression levels mmp2 hepg2 huh7 cells. mtt assay was
used evaluate cell proliferation, flow cytometry analysis applied to
examine cell apoptosis. transwell assay carried assess cell
invasion.
results: optimal virus:cell ratio 100 multiplicity infection (moi) for
both cells, optimal transduction times hepg2 huh7 cells 48 h
and 72 h, respectively. mmp2 knockdown significantly decreased mrna and
protein levels mmp2 cell lines (p<0.01). mmp2 knockdown significantly 
decreased proliferation increased apoptosis hepg2 huh7 cells
(p<0.01). co-treatment si-mmp2 cisplatin significantly increased the
sensitivity hepg2 huh7 cells cisplatin (p<0.01).
conclusion: mmp2 may act oncogene may potential therapeutic target
in hcc.
