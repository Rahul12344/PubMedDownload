h9n2 avian influenza virus (aiv) genotype frequently donate internal genes
to facilitate generation novel reassortants h7n9, h10n8, h5n2 
h5n6 aivs, posing enormous threat human health poultry industry.
however, pathogenicity transmission reassortant h5 viruses with
internal gene cassette genotype h9n2-origin chickens mice remain
unknown. study, four h5 reassortants carrying ha na genes from
different clades h5 viruses remaining internal genes h9n2
virus predominant genotype generated reverse genetics. found 
that four h5 reassortant viruses showed attenuated virulence chickens
and mice, thus leading increased mean death times compared the
corresponding parental viruses. consistently, polymerase activity and
replication ability mammalian avian cells, cytokine responses in
the lungs chickens mice also decreased compared their
respective parental viruses. moreover, reassortants transmitted birds 
to birds direct contact airborne route. data indicate that
the internal genes whole cassette genotype h9n2 viruses play
important roles reducing pathogenicity h5 recombinants chickens 
and mice, might contribute circulation avian mammalian hosts.
