ultracentrifugation sucrose density gradient remains commonly used
technique hrsv purification. however, high viscosity hyper-osmotic
property sucrose cause damage extremely labile virus leading to
loss infectivity. overcome limitations, alternative purification
technique developed using iodixanol gradient medium, incorporating mgso(4)
as stabilizing agent edta disaggregate virus prior infectivity
assay. virus particles banded 20-36% interface purification 
polyethylene glycol-concentrated viruses rate zonal ultracentrifugation a
20-52% discontinuous iodixanol gradient. presence virus confirmed 
by viral fusion glycoprotein content using elisa. purification by
buoyant density ultracentrifugation 20-52% continuous gradient, virus
was recovered region density 1.15-1.19 g/ml confirmed by
the coincidence infectivity titre, viral genome fusion glycoprotein
peaks. analysis recovery rates showed use iodixanol increased 
virus yield 69%. iodixanol also found non-toxic hela cells
used infectivity assay, eliminating need downstream removal by
dialysis.
