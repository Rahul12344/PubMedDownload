cells.

an vitro method described primary induction murine cytotoxic cells
against syngeneic cells infected ectromelia lymphocytic choriomeningitis 
(lcm) virus. cytotoxicity assayed 51cr release macrophage l929
target cells. cytotoxic activity sensitive anti-theta complement and
was expressed target cells infected virus sharing 
h-2k h-2d genes infected stimulator cells. crucial factors in
generating responses mouse strain, responder: stimulator ratio, nature of
infected stimulator cells, presence sufficient macrophages. c57bl/6 cells 
were less demanding cba/h balb/c cells. optimal conditions defined
here, vitro response similar kinetics potency primary
response spleen vivo.
