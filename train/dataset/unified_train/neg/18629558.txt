premature infants vulnerable severe respiratory syncytial virus (rsv)
lower respiratory tract infection (lrti) resulting hospitalisation the
potential longer-term respiratory morbidity. whilst severity and
consequence rsv lrti generally accepted recognised infants born
<or=32 weeks gestational age (ga), less acknowledgment potential 
consequences infants born 33-35 weeks ga. however, growing body 
evidence suggesting infants born 33 35 weeks ga may equally
at risk rsv lrti infants born <32 weeks ga. interrupted lung development
and immature immune system linked increased susceptibility
for rsv lrti, along environmental, social, physiological risk
factors. currently, effective method preventing rsv lrti is
prophylaxis palivizumab. often limited healthcare resources,
identifying infants greatest risk rsv lrti would potentially benefit
most prophylaxis highly desirable, particularly 33-35-week ga
group. purpose article examine causes consequences of
rsv lrti infants born 33-35 weeks ga, look potential using risk
factors identify high risk infants and, thereby, optimise prophylaxis. the
causes consequences rsv lrti infants born 33-35 weeks gaa were
determined via literature review. number underlying risk factors that
significantly increase risk severe rsv lrti subsequent hospitalisation
in group infants identified, notably flip and
picnic studies. european predictive model based risk factors flip
study recently developed validated, aid identification of
infants born 33 35 weeks ga highest risk rsv
hospitalisation. implementation model prophylaxis infants born
between 33 35 weeks ga national regional decision, taken in
perspective public health needs.
