several lines evidence indicate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity 
(wren et al., 2013) important pathogenesis hiv-1 infection. namely, 
adcc induced natural hiv-1 infection hiv-1 vaccine studies, the
latter demonstrated rv144 vaccine trial. expedite assessment of
adcc studies hiv, developed high throughput assay. have
optimized rapid fluorometric antibody-mediated cytotoxicity assay (rfadcc) by
transfecting egfp-cem-nkr cell line constitutively express snap-tagged
ccr5. cell line serve source hiv-specific targets when
coated monomeric gp120, spinoculated inactivated intact virions,
infected cell-free viral diffusion infected cell-to-cell transmission of
virus. optimized strategy two significant advantages original
rfadcc method: first, preparation detectable target cells less labor
intensive faster rely multiple staining washing steps
for target cells. second, target cell markers gfp snap are
constitutively expressed, assay provides highly reproducible data. these
strengths make optimized rfadcc assay suitable studies hiv-1 
specific cytotoxicity also studies cell-cell transmission virus. in
conclusion, assay provides new generation cell line expedite
large clinical studies well research studies humans non-human
primates.
