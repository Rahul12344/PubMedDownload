hepatitis e infection typically associated areas hepatitis e
virus (hev) endemic. except cases europe united
states, acute hepatitis e usually associated travel endemic areas. 
set determine etiologic role hev acute non-a-c hepatitis in
italy. presence hev-rna antibody determined 218 patients
diagnosed acute viral non-a-c hepatitis. acute hepatitis e infection was
defined presence hev-rna sera positivity igm anti-hev and
seroconversion igg anti-hev. acute hepatitis e found 10.1% the
patients acute non-a-c, 95.5% exhibiting benign course. severe
course observed patient co-infected hav hev. cases were
travelers endemic areas, although 18.2% reported travel. one patient was
from household infected patient. sequence analyses polymerase
chain reaction (pcr) product derived patient never visited endemic
areas, identified isolate divergent significantly reported
isolates hev (79.5-85.8% nucleotide identity). evidence study
suggests hev accounts approximately 10% acute non-a-c viral hepatitis
in italy, diagnosed generally travelers returning endemic areas. however,
the identification new hev variant individual never indicated
travel contact individuals associated endemic areas, suggests that
this virus may native italy.
