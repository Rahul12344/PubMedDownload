vascular smooth muscle cell (vsmc) proliferation occurs vascular obstructive
events atherosclerosis restenosis. previously showed notch
receptors induced smooth muscle cells vascular remodeling. goal
was determine mechanisms employed notch signaling regulate
proliferation. activation notch1 notch4 induced vsmc-selective target 
genes hrt1 hrt2, promoted cell cycle transit smooth muscle cells, led 
to loss density-dependent growth inhibition. associated a
reduction levels cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (cdk) p27(kip1).
over-expression p27(kip1) resulted dose-dependent rescue the
notch-induced phenotype exit cell cycle. addition, hrt2
expression sufficient promote s-phase entry, demonstrate hrt2 
interacts directly p27(kip1) promoter repress transcription.
transcriptional repression occurred within approximately 774 bp minimal
p27(kip1) promoter region mutational analysis demonstrated repression is
largely dependent conserved class-c domain. data show notch
signaling acts promote proliferative phenotype vsmc modulation 
g1/s-phase checkpoint. addition, define novel mechanism the
notch effector, hrt2, interacts directly class-c domain p27(kip1)
promoter, repressing expression. studies identify novel
transcriptional target hrt2, show notch effectors directly control
cell cycle regulatory components. suggest mechanism relevant to
hyperproliferative states vsmc seen vascular remodeling repair.
