genetically distinct hantaviruses identified five species of
fossorial moles (order eulipotyphla, family talpidae) eurasia north
america. here, report isolation partial characterization highly
divergent hantavirus, named nova virus (nvav), lung tissue european
mole (talpa europaea), captured central poland august 2013. typical
hantavirus-like particles, measuring 80-120 nm diameter, found in
nvav-infected vero e6 cells transmission electron microscopy. whole-genome
sequences isolate, designated nvav strain te34, identical that
amplified original lung tissue, phylogenetic analysis the
full-length l, segments, using maximum-likelihood bayesian methods,
showed nvav closely related hantaviruses harbored by
insectivorous bats, consistent ancient evolutionary origin. infant swiss 
webster mice, inoculated nvav intraperitoneal route, developed weight
loss hyperactivity, beginning 16 days, followed hind-limb paralysis and
death. high nvav rna copies detected lung, liver, kidney, spleen and
brain quantitative real-time rt-pcr. neuropathological examination showed
astrocytic microglial activation neuronal loss. first mole-borne
hantavirus isolate facilitate long-overdue studies infectivity and
pathogenic potential humans.
