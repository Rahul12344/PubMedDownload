there much conflicting immunological viral data causes of
chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs); findings support notion cfs may 
due one immune disorders resulted exposure an
infectious agent. present study, flow cytometry several different
monoclonal antibodies recognising t, b, natural killer (nk) cell populations 
as well activation cell adhesion antigens used study 147
individuals cfs. compared healthy controls, reduced cd8 suppressor
cell population increased activation markers (cd38, hla-dr) cd8 cells were
found. differences significant (p = 0.01) patient major symptoms
of disease. immunological indices observed 80 healthy
individuals, 22 contacts cfs patients, 43 patients other
diseases. correlation findings cfs patients known human
viruses could detected serology. findings suggest immune
activation associated many cases cfs.
