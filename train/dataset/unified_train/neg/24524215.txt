background: insects important epidemiological factors plant
virus disease spread, >75% viruses dependent insects for
transmission new hosts. black-faced leafhopper (graminella nigrifrons
forbes) transmits two viruses use different strategies transmission:
maize chlorotic dwarf virus (mcdv) semi-persistently transmitted and
maize fine streak virus (mfsv) persistently propagatively
transmitted. date, little known regarding molecular cellular
mechanisms insects regulate process efficiency transmission,
or mechanisms differ based virus transmission strategy.
results: rna-seq used examine transcript changes leafhoppers after
feeding mcdv-infected, mfsv-infected healthy maize 4 h 7 d. 
sequencing cdna libraries constructed whole individuals using illumina next 
generation sequencing, rnnotator pipeline galaxy used reassemble
the g. nigrifrons transcriptome. using differential expression analyses, we
identified significant changes transcript abundance g. nigrifrons. in
particular, transcripts implicated innate immune response energy
production highly expressed insects fed virus-infected maize.
leafhoppers fed mfsv-infected maize also showed induction transcripts
involved hemocoel cell-membrane linked immune responses within four hours 
of feeding. patterns transcript expression validated subset of
transcripts quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction using rna samples collected insects fed healthy or
virus-infected maize 4 h seven week period.
conclusions: expected, found, changes transcript expression g.
nigrifrons feeding maize infected virus (mfsv) also infects the
leafhopper, including induction immune responses hemocoel the
cell membrane. significant induction innate immune system g.
nigrifrons fed foregut-borne virus (mcdv) infect leafhoppers
was less expected. changes transcript accumulation occur independent 
of mode pathogen transmission could key identifying insect factors 
that disrupt vector-mediated plant virus transmission.
