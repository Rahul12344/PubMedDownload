in effort develop effective dna immunization strategy hiv, we
synthesized hiv-2 env dna vaccine delivered novel polycationic
adjuvant formulation forms nanoparticles solution enhances protein
expression. polycationic adjuvant contained imidazole moieties facilitate 
endosomal escape. nanoparticles containing dna vaccine plasmid formed by
electrostatic condensation polycationic adjuvant. hypothesized that
this formulation would improve immune responses gp140 env gene from
hiv-2(uc2) increasing level expressed antigen. found the
nanoparticles superior inducing high levels systemic antibody
responses compared naked dna delivered intradermal route balb/c
mice. addition, nanoparticles induced higher levels igm, igg, iga
antibodies. results suggest nanoparticles may important adjuvant
formulation improve effectiveness genetic immunization rationalize 
its use evaluation vaccine candidates non-human primate models for
aids.
