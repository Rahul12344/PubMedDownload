the salivary disease two patients human immunodeficiency virus infection 
was investigated technetium pertechnetate scintiscanning. although was
good histologic evidence benign lymphoepithelial disease, scintiscanning
failed delineate salivary lesions. technetium pertechnetate scintiscanning
seems little value detailed investigation salivary disease 
human immunodeficiency virus infection, though gallium scanning help. fine
needle aspiration biopsy remain main diagnostic tools.
