current clinical gene therapy protocols treatment human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) infection involve ex vivo transduction 
and expansion cd4+ cells derived hiv-positive patients late stage 
in disease (cd4+ cell count <400 cells/mm3). examined efficiency 
transduction transgene expression adult bone marrow (bm)- umbilical
cord blood (ucb)-derived cd34+ cells induced differentiate cells and
monocytes vitro mulv-based vector encoding neomycin resistance
gene intracellular antibody directed tat protein hiv-1
(sfvtat1-ckappa). expression marker gene effects antiviral 
construct subsequent challenge monocytotropic cell-tropic hiv-1
isolates monitored vitro purified cells monocytes generated in
culture transduced cd34+ cells. transduction efficiencies cd34+ cells
ranged 22 27%. differentiation cd34+ cells cells or
monocytes significantly altered transduction process. hiv-1
replication monocytes cd4+ cells derived cd34+ cells transduced
with intracellular antibody gene significantly reduced comparison with
the degree hiv replication seen monocytes cd4+ cells derived from
cd34+ cells transduced neomycin resistance gene alone. further, cells 
and monocytes derived cd34+ cells transduced intracellular antibody
gene demonstrated express sfvtat1-ckappa transgene rt-pcr 
a selective growth advantage cultures challenged hiv-1.
these data demonstrate sfvtat1-ckappa inhibits hiv-1 replication cells 
and monocytes developing cd34+ cells supports continuing development
of stem cell gene therapy treatment hiv-1 infection.
