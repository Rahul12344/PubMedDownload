there four serotypes dengue (den1-den4) virus endemic most
areas southeast asia, central south america, subtropical
regions. number cases severe disease associated den virus
infection growing continued spread mosquito vector,
aedes aegypti, transmits virus humans. infection den virus 
result asymptomatic infection, febrile illness called dengue fever (df), 
and severe disease called dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome
(dhf/dss). currently, licensed vaccine available. however, tetravalent
vaccine urgently needed prevent df dhf/dss, latter occurs 
predominantly partially immune individuals. live attenuated, tetravalent den
virus vaccine candidate generated using reverse genetics able to
provide immunity four serotypes den. attenuation been
achieved generating recombinant den (rden) viruses modified by
deletion or, alternatively, antigenic chimerization two related den
viruses using following two strategies: 1) introduction attenuating 30 
nucleotide deletion (delta30) mutation 3' untranslated region den1
and den4; 2) replacement structural proteins attenuated
rden4delta30 vaccine candidate den2 den3. attenuation the
four monovalent vaccine candidates achieved rhesus monkeys humans
and immunogenic tetravalent vaccine candidate formulated. level
of attenuation dengue vaccine component increased, needed, by
introduction additional attenuating mutations well
characterized.
