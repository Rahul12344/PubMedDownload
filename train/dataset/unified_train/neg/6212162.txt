to investigate whether lesions develop chronic stage viral
myocarditis similar seen congestive (dilated) cardiomyopathy, 
studied myocarditis inbred strains dba/2 mice infected with
encephalomyocarditis (emc) virus. myocardial necrosis calcification appeared
on day 4. thereafter, myocardial necrosis became extensive mononuclear
cell infiltration evident marked day 14. day 90, cellular 
infiltration decreased myocardial fibrosis prominent. stage, 
the heart weight significantly greater infected mice the
controls (0.190 +/- 0.028 g vs 0.122 +/- 0.013 g, mean +/- sd) (p less than
0.001) cavity dimensions left ventricle larger (1.67 +/- 0.29
mm vs 1.11 +/- 0.20 mm) (p less 0.001). diameters myocardial fibers
of right ventricle, interventricular septum left ventricle were
significantly larger controls (right ventricle, 16.6 +/- 1.8 vs
13.4 +/- 1.5 micrometer; interventricular septum, 17.8 +/- 1.5 vs 13.8 +/- 1.5
micrometer; left ventricle, 19.4 +/- 1.7 vs 14.8 +/- 1.1 micrometer) (p less than
0.001). study demonstrates viral myocarditis chronic stage,
lesions develop resemble seen congestive cardiomyopathy.
