hyperthermophilic archaeal viruses, including sulfolobus spindle-shaped viruses
(ssvs) ssv-1 ssv-ragged hills, exhibit remarkable morphology and
genetic diversity. however, remain poorly understood, part 
genomes exhibit limited unrecognizable sequence similarity genes known
function. report structural functional studies e73, 73-residue
homodimeric protein encoded within ssv-ragged hills genome. despite lacking
significant sequence similarity, nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) structure
reveals clear similarity ribbon-helix-helix (rhh) domains present numerous 
proteins involved transcriptional regulation. vitro double-stranded dna
(dsdna) binding experiments confirm ability e73 bind dsdna a
nonspecific manner micromolar affinity, characterization k11e
variant confirms location predicted dna binding surface. e73 is
distinct, however, known rhh domains. rhh motif elaborated upon by
the insertion third helix tightly integrated structural
domain, giving rise "rh3" fold. within homodimer, helix results
in formation conserved, symmetric cleft distal dna binding
surface, may mediate protein-protein interactions contribute the
high thermal stability e73. analysis backbone amide dynamics nmr
provides evidence rigid core, fast picosecond nanosecond time scale nh
bond vector motions residues located within antiparallel β-sheet region
of proposed dna-binding surface, slower microsecond millisecond time
scale motions residues α1-α2 loop. roles e73 ssv
