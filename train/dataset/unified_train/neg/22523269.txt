background: known whether chronic hepatitis b (ch-b) chronic
hepatitis c (ch-c) carries greater risk liver-related mortality. study 
compared rates liver-related mortality 2 groups the
multicenter aids cohort study (macs).
methods: six hundred eighty men ch-b (n = 337) ch-c (n = 343) study
entry macs prospectively followed death, last follow-up visit,
or 30 march 2010, whichever came first. four hundred seventy-two (69.4%) these
men infected human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1). causes of
death obtained death registry matching death certificates.
liver-related all-cause mortality rates (mrs) compared groups
using poisson regression adjusted potential confounders competing
risks.
results: 6728 person-years (pys) follow-up, 293 deaths 
causes (43.5 per 1000 pys), 51 liver-related (7.6 per 1000 pys).
the all-cause mr similar ch-b ch-c; however, the
liver-related mr significantly higher ch-b (9.6 per 1000 pys;
95% confidence interval [ci], 6.9-13.2) ch-c (5.0 per 1000 pys;
95% ci, 3.0-8.4). hiv-infected subgroup, 46 (90.2%) the
liver-related deaths, liver-related mr remained higher ch-b after
adjusting potential confounders (incidence rate ratio, 2.2; p = .03) and
competing risks (subhazard rate ratio, 2.4; p = .02). furthermore, among
hiv-infected subjects, cd4 cell counts <200 cells/mm(3) associated a
16.2-fold (95% ci, 6.1-42.8) increased risk liver-related death compared 
cd4 cell counts >350 cell/mm(3).
conclusions: chronic hepatitis b carries higher risk death liver
disease ch-c, especially hiv-infected men greater
immunosuppression.
