two ring-expanded analogues (compounds 2 3) anti-hiv fermentation
product oxetanocin (1) synthesized commercially available diacetone
d-glucose. antiviral testing hiv ath8 cells revealed the
ring-expanded analogue 2 possessed similar activity profile oxetanocin a.
neither compound, however, capable providing full protection cells 
against hiv infection. isomeric ring-expanded analogue 3 totally devoid
of anti-hiv activity. molecular modeling suggested oxetanocin and
compounds 2 3 share large common substructure potent anti-hiv
drug, dideoxyadenosine (dda), extra hydroxymethyl substituent may contribute 
negatively binding molecules critical enzyme. negative
contribution may less important oxetanocin isomer 2 isomer 3.
from studies would appear oxetane tetrahydrofuran rings
are equivalent templates support adenine base terms anti-hiv
activity.
