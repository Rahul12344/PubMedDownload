the world organization animal health (office international des epizooties,
oie) includes diseases caused foot-and-mouth disease virus (fmdv), swine
vesicular disease virus (svdv), vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv), as
"diseases notifiable oie". foot-and-mouth disease (fmd) outbreaks have
severe economical well social effects cannot differentiated the
diseases caused two viruses basis clinical symptoms.
efficient laboratory techniques therefore required detection and
identification viruses causing similar vesicular symptoms swine. a
rapid method described using padlock probes microarrays detect
simultaneously differentiate three viruses single reaction, well 
as providing serotype information cases vsv infection. padlock
probe/microarray assay detected successfully identified 39 cdna samples of
different origin representing three viruses. results complete
agreement identities serotypes determined previously. novel virus
detection method discussed terms usefulness development.
