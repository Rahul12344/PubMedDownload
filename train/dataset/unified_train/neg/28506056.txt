background/aims: study aimed develop validate risk prediction model
for development hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) treatment-naïve patients
receiving oral antiviral treatment chronic hepatitis b (chb).
methods: investigated 2,061 korean treatment-naïve patients chb treated
with entecavir initial therapy. risk score model hcc development 
developed based multivariable cox regression model single center (n=990) 
and validated using time-dependent area receiver operating
characteristic curve (auroc) three centers (n=1,071). difference 
hcc development among risk groups (low, intermediate, high) categorized by
risk score also investigated.
results: cumulative incidence rates hcc 5 years 11.2% 8.9% 
the testing validation cohorts, respectively. hcc-risk estimating score in
chb patients entecavir (hcc-rescue) formulated (age+15×gender
[female=0 / male=1]+23×cirrhosis [absence=0 / presence=1]). aurocs 1 year,
3 years, 5 years 0.82, 0.81, 0.81, respectively, validation
cohort. significant difference hcc development risk group was
determined 5-year hcc risk score validation cohort (low risk group,
2.1%; intermediate risk group, 9.3%; high risk group, 41.2%, p<0.001).
conclusions: study presents new risk score model good ability to
predict hcc development determine high risk patients hcc development
consisting readily available clinical factors treatment-naïve chb patients 
receiving entecavir.
