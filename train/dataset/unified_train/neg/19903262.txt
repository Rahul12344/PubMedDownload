pathogenic jcv rearranged regulatory regions (pml-type) causes pml, a
demyelinating disease, brains immunocompromised patients. 
hand, archetype jcv persistently infecting kidney thought converted 
to pml-type virus jcv replication infected host under
immunosuppressed conditions. addition, tat protein, encoded hiv-1, markedly
enhances expression reporter gene control jcv late
promoter. order examine influence tat jcv propagation, used
kidney-derived cos-7 cells, permit archetype jcv, established
cos-tat cells, express hiv-1 tat stably. found extent of
archetype jcv propagation cos-tat cells significantly greater cos-7
cells. hand, cos-7 cells express sv40 antigen, strong
stimulator archetype jcv replication. expression sv40 antigen was
enhanced hiv-1 tat slightly according real-time rt-pcr, not
closely related jcv replication cos-tat cells. efficiency jcv
propagation depended extent expression functional tat. our
knowledge, first report increased production archetype jcv a
culture system using cell lines stably expressing hiv-1 tat. propose that
cos-tat cells useful tool studying role tat archetype jcv
replication development pml.
