hiv-1 proteins, including tat, gp120, nef, activate macrophages (mφ), which
is consistent fact hiv-1 infection characterized sustained
immune activation. meanwhile, mφ functionally classified two types:
proinflammatory m1-mφ anti-inflammatory m2-mφ. show hiv-1 proteins,
particularly nef, preferentially activate m2-mφ. extracellular tat, gp120, and
nef activated mapk nf-κb pathways human peripheral blood monocyte-derived 
mφ. however, activation marked m-csf-derived m2-mφ not
gm-csf-derived m1-mφ. nef potent activator, signaling
activation comparable tnf-α. indeed, nef internalized more
rapidly m2-mφ m1-mφ. myristoylation proline-rich motif nef 
were responsible observed signaling activation. consistent the
activation mapk/nf-κb pathways, nef stimulated production number of
proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines m2-mφ. however, nef reduced the
expression cd163 phagocytosis, characteristic markers m2-mφ,
indicating nef drives m2-like m1-like phenotypic shift. the
differentiation tissue mφ depends m-csf receptor, the
essential axis anti-inflammatory m2-mφ phenotype, current study
reveals efficient mechanism hiv-1 proteins, nef, induce the
proinflammatory mφ.
