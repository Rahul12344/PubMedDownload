background: tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (trail)
selectively induces apoptosis cancer cells normal cells. despite
this promising feature, trail resistance observed cancer cells seriously
challenged use trail death ligand gene therapy. current
dispute concerns whether trail receptor expression pattern primary 
determinant trail sensitivity cancer cells. study investigates trail
receptor expression pattern connection trail resistance breast
cancer cells. addition, dcr2 sirna approach complementary gene therapy
modality involving ikk inhibition (adikkbetaka) also tested verify if
these approaches could sensitize mcf7 breast cancer cells adenovirus delivery 
of trail (ad5htrail).
methods: trail sensitivity assays conducted using molecular probe's
live/dead cellular viability/cytotoxicity kit following infection breast
cancer cells ad5htrail. molecular mechanism trail induced cell death 
under setting ikk inhibition revealed annexin v binding. novel
quantitative real time rt-pcr flow cytometry analysis performed to
disclose trail receptor composition breast cancer cells.
results: mcf7 mda-mb-231 breast cancer cells displayed strong resistance 
to adenovirus delivery trail. combinatorial use ad5htrail and
adikkbetaka infection sensitized mcf7 breast cancer cells trail induced cell
death. moreover, novel quantitative real time rt-pcr assays suggested 
the level trail decoy receptor-4 (trail-r4) expression highest mcf7
cells, lowest trail receptor expressed mda-mb-231 cells. in
addition, conventional flow cytometry analysis demonstrated trail resistant 
mcf7 cells exhibited substantial levels trail-r4 expression trail
decoy receptor-3 (trail-r3) surface. contrary, trail sensitive
mda-mb-231 cells displayed low levels surface trail-r4 expression.
furthermore, dcr2 sirna approach lowered trail-r4 expression surface and
this sensitized mcf7 cells trail.
conclusion: expression trail-r4 decoy receptor appeared well
correlated trail resistance encountered breast cancer cells. both
adenovirus mediated ikkbetaka expression dcr2 sirna approach sensitized
mcf7 breast cancer cells trail.
