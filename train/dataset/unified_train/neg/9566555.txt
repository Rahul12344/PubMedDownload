cd8+ lymphocytes hiv+ individuals potently suppress hiv-1 replication 
in noncytolytic manner. suppression appears multifactorial the
molecules contributing fully elucidated. approach this
question used herpesvirus saimiri (hvs) transform cd8+ lymphocytes from
an hiv+ asymptomatic donor continuously growing, activation-independent,
il-2-dependent phenotype. transformed cell population, termed cd8(hvs), had
an activated phenotype, contained hvs sequences, shed infectious hvs
virus, polyclonal. cd8(hvs) cells, despite absence detectable 
ctl activity, potently suppressed hiv-1 production autologous and
heterologous cd4+ cells infected donors. cd8(hvs) cells coculture
also suppressed virus production pbmcs acutely infected with
syncytium-inducing (si) strains nsi primary isolates hiv-1. the
supernatants cd8(hvs) cells concentrates derived these
supernatants suppressive nsi primary isolates hiv-1 si
strains. fractionation concentrates showed suppressive activity
was associated low molecular mass (6500- 19,300-da) protein species.
western blotting elisa indicated cc chemokines mip-1alpha,
mip-1beta, rantes present fractions. antibody-blocking studies 
with antibodies cc chemokines indicated significant portion 
soluble hiv-suppressive activity due molecules. however, these
experiments also suggested inhibitory activity cd8(hvs) cells in
coculture due exclusively cc chemokines. hvs-transformed cells 
provide useful tool study noncytolytic cd8+ lymphocyte-mediated
suppression hiv-1.
