accurate rapid recognition separation multiple types biological
targets molecules, cells, bacteria viruses complex sample
mixtures great importance wide range diagnostic therapeutic
strategies. achieve goal, set fluorescent, magnetic, dual-encoded
multifunctional bioprobes constructed co-embedding different-sized
quantum dots varying amounts γ-fe(2)o(3) magnetic nanoparticles into
swollen poly(styrene/acrylamide) copolymer nanospheres. dual-encoded
bioprobes, possessed different photoluminescent property magnetic
susceptibility, proven capable simultaneously recognizing and
separating multiple components complex sample three kinds lectins 
were used targets. lectins separated high efficiency and
kept bioactivity process. compared conventional batchwise
separation, method require large number sequential reaction
steps, economical time reagent-saving. combining
the multiplexing capability quantum dots superparamagnetic properties
of iron oxide nanoparticles, dual-encoded technique expected open new 
opportunities high-throughput multiplex bioassays, cell sorting,
proteomical genomical applications, drug screening etc.
