the cytokine interleukin-21 (il-21) regulates viral pathogenesis individuals
infected human simian immunodeficiency viruses. however, the
time initial infection hiv humans rarely known, dynamics of
il-21 production first weeks adequately explored. the
present study, used rhesus macaques model first stages infection.
twenty-two rhesus macaques infected rectally simian-human
immunodeficiency virus (shiv)-1157ipd3n4, 12Â weeks, replication the
virus, numbers cd4+ cd8+ cells, levels plasma il-21 
monitored. study demonstrated plasma levels il-21 increased during
the early phase shiv infection compared values observed before
inoculation. conclude il-21 likely role immunopathogenesis
of hiv/siv/shiv.
