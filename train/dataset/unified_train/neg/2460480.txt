systematic solid-phase synthesis possible overlapping nonapeptides 
1381 amino acid sequence epstein-barr virus major capsid protein (ebv-mcp)
was used identify position linear antigen epitopes protein as
recognised human polyclonal antisera. antisera selected reactivity
with ebv-mcp immunoblots. results show antibodies different
individual donors may recognise ebv-mcp binding variety different
epitopes. epitopes localized random protein backbone though
some non-binding areas also present. addition, ten 'hot-spots' were
identified containing closely-spaced reactive peptides (epitope-clusters)
recognised (greater equal 70%) individuals. significant
correlation found actual location epitope-clusters and
computer predictions using either hydrophilicity plots, secondary structure plots
or combination (additional) parameters. epitope-clusters generally were
located regions indifferent hydrophilic nature mostly contained
predicted beta-turn configurations. one epitope-cluster located within a
region sequence homology mcps herpes simplex virus type 1 and
varicella-zoster virus. present study demonstrates potential using
systematic peptide synthesis define serologically relevant linear epitopes 
large relatively unexplored viral polypeptides.
