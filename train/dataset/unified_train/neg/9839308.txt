esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (escc) demonstrates wide regional variation in
incidence causal associations. human papillomavirus (hpv) implicated
in escc, particularly sub-types 16 18. transforming proteins e6 e7
from high risk sub-types, interact p53 protein rb protein
respectively, leading loss function tumor suppressor gene
products. interactions lead inactivation growth
suppressive effects p53 rb proteins, resulting abnormal
proliferative states. p53 protein expression found hpv-positive 
and -negative tumors, indicating hpv p53 protein expression not
mutually exclusive occur together tumor. observed
that hpv plays significant role esophageal carcinogenesis geographic
areas high prevalence disease. variation association
between hpv escc worldwide may due environmental geographic
factors, genetic susceptibility esophageal hpv infections. variations in
the sensitivity techniques used detection virus the
methodology processing tumor tissues, may also responsible global 
differences. esophageal carcinogenesis complex multistep process a
multifactorial etiology. infection oncogenic hpv types may integral
part multistep process leads escc.
