energetics cooperative protein-dna interactions: comparison between
quantitative deoxyribonuclease footprint titration filter binding.

senear df, brenowitz m, shea ma, ackers gk.

using binding ci repressor protein lambda right left operators 
as model system, analyzed two common experimental techniques for
studying interactions genome regulatory proteins multiple, specific
sites dna. quantitative dnase footprint titration technique
[brenowitz, m., senear, d. f., shea, m. a., & ackers, g. k. (1986) methods
enzymol. 130, 132-181] nitrocellulose filter binding assay [riggs, a.,
suzuki, h., & bourgeois, s. (1970) j. mol. biol. 48, 67-83]. footprint
titration technique provides binding curves separately represent the
fractional saturation site. principle, data contain the
information necessary determine thermodynamic constants local site
binding cooperativity. show practice, possible all
values constants multisite systems, lambda operators. we
show constants nevertheless uniquely determined using
additional binding data small number mutant operators the
number binding sites reduced. filter binding technique not
distinguish binding individual sites yields macroscopic binding
parameters composite averages various local site and
cooperativity constants. moreover, resolution even macroscopic constants
from filter binding data multisite systems requires ad hoc assumptions 
a relationship number ligands bound filter retention of
the complex. results indicate relationship exists. hence, the
technique permit determination thermodynamically valid interaction
constants (even macroscopic) multisite systems.
