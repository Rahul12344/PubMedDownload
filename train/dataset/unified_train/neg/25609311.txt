background: garlic cultivated consumed worldwide popular condiment
and green vegetable medicinal neutraceutical properties. garlic
cultivars produce seeds, therefore, plant the
subject either classical breeding genetic studies. however, recent
achievements fertility restoration number genotypes led to
flowering seed production, thus enabling genetic studies breeding in
garlic.
results: transcriptome catalogue fertile garlic produced from
multiplexed gene libraries, using rna collected various plant organs,
including inflorescences flowers. 32 million 250-bp paired-end reads
were assembled extensive transcriptome 240,000 contigs. abundant
transcriptome assembled separately 102,000 highly expressed contigs was
annotated analyzed gene ontology metabolic pathways. organ-specific
analysis showed significant variation gene expression plant organs,
with highest number specific reads inflorescences flowers. analysis
of enriched biological processes molecular functions revealed
characteristic patterns stress response, flower development and
photosynthetic activity. orthologues key flowering genes differentially
expressed, reproductive tissues, also leaves bulbs,
suggesting role flower-signal transduction bulbing process. more
than 100 variants isoforms enzymes involved organosulfur metabolism
were differentially expressed organ-specific patterns. addition to
plant genes, viral rna least four garlic viruses detected, mostly in
the roots cloves, whereas 1-4% reads found foliage
leaves.
conclusions: de novo transcriptome fertile garlic represents new
resource research breeding important crop, well the
development effective molecular markers useful traits, including fertility
and seed production, resistance pests neutraceutical characteristics.
