we present complete genome sequence yersinia pestis kim, etiologic
agent bubonic pneumonic plague. strain kim, biovar mediaevalis, is
associated second pandemic, including black death. 4.6-mb genome
encodes 4,198 open reading frames (orfs). origin, terminus, genes
encoding dna replication proteins similar escherichia coli k-12. 
the kim genome sequence compared y. pestis co92, biovar
orientalis, revealing homologous sequences remarkable amount genome
rearrangement strains closely related. differences appear result
from multiple inversions genome segments insertion sequences, manner
consistent present knowledge replication recombination. few
differences attributable horizontal transfer. kim e. coli k-12 genome 
proteins also compared, exposing surprising amounts locally colinear
"backbone," synteny, discernible nucleotide level. nearly
54% kim orfs significantly similar k-12 proteins, conserved
housekeeping functions. however, number e. coli pathways transport
systems least one global regulator found, reflecting differences 
in lifestyle them. kim-specific islands, new genes encode candidate
pathogenicity proteins, including iron transport systems, putative adhesins,
toxins, fimbriae.
