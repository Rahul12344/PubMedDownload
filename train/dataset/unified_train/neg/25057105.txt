dietary supplements often used improve nutritional status people
living hiv/aids (plhiv). arthrospira platensis (asp), also known as
spirulina, cyanobacterium rich proteins micronutrients. cell and
animal trials described immune-modulating, antiretroviral antioxidant
activities. pilot study describes effects supplementation 5
g/day asp pre-highly-active antiretroviral therapy (pre-haart),
hiv-infected, adult female population. conducted three-month
randomized controlled trial (rct) compared cup supplementation five
grams/day asp placebo equal protein content energy. study
included 73 hiv-infected women. immediate outcome variables cd4 t-cells,
viral load immune activation cd8 t-cells expressing cd38. antioxidant 
status assessed way total antioxidant capacity serum (taos).
the renal function documented way creatinine, urea calculated
glomerular filtration rate. statistical analyses carried with
non-parametric tests, effect size interaction calculated. 
differences immunological virological markers asp 
placebo group could observed. placebo group, 21 30 patients (70%)
developed concomitant events, asp group, 12 28 patients
(43%) did. groups registered significant weight increase; 0.5 kg (p <
0.05) asp group 0.65 kg (p < 0.05) placebo group. the
antioxidant capacity increase 56 (1-98) µm asp significantly different
from decrease observed placebo group (p < 0.001). slight increase in
the creatinine level 0.1 g/dl (p < 0.001) observed asp group, and
no effect observed urea levels. improvement antioxidant
capacity asp, shown first time plhiv, could become focus for
future research nutritional health effects spirulina. observed 
slight, significant increase serum creatinine needs evaluation,
especially varying doses asp.
