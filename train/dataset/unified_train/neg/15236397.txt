transmission. htlv-i infection endemic well-defined geographic regions, and
it estimated 20 million individuals infected worldwide. although
most infected individuals asymptomatic carriers, 2 5% develop 
chronic encephalomyelopathy, htlv-i-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic

critically reviewed reported cases htlv-ii-associated disorders. 
confirmed although rare infection associated disorder clinically
similar identical ham/tsp. however, reports attributed
infection range neurological disorders difficult evaluate in
that many cases either association appears fortuitous the
presentations confounded background concomitant human
