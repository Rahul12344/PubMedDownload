mutate program developed teaching purposes impart virtual
laboratory class undergraduate students genetics biology. program
emulates so-called fluctuation test whose aim distinguish between
spontaneous adaptive mutation hypotheses bacteria. plan train
students certain key multidisciplinary aspects current genetics as
sequence databases, dna mutations, hypothesis testing, introducing 
fluctuation test. seminal experiment originally performed studying
escherichia coli resistance infection bacteriophage t1. fluctuation
test initiated modern bacterial genetics 25 years later ushered the
era recombinant dna. nowadays know deletions fhua, the
gene responsible e. coli membrane receptor t1, could cause e. coli
resistance phage. sake simplicity, introduce the
assumption single mutation generates resistance t1. the
practical, students use program download fhua gene sequences,
manually introduce stop codon mutations, design fluctuation test to
obtain data distinguishing preadaptative (spontaneous) induced
(adaptive) mutation hypotheses. program launched browser or, if
preferred, executable file downloaded from
http://webs.uvigo.es/acraaj/mutateweb/mutate.html. requires java 5.0 (or
higher) runtime environment (freely available http://www.java.com).
