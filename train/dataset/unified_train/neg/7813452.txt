the terminase enzyme phage lambda site-specific endonuclease nicks
dna concatemers regenerate 12 nucleotide cohesive ends mature
chromosome. enzyme's dna target, cos, consists nicking domain, cosn, and
a binding domain, cosb. cosb, situated right cosn, comprises three 16
bp repeat sequences, r1, r2 r3. similar sequence, r4, present the
left cosn. shown terminase intrinsic specificity for
cosn independent r sites. interaction cosn mediated
by binding target sites include 12 bp 5', 2-7 bp 3'
side nick. four r sites, r3 required proper
formation ends. r3 present, atp-charged terminase system correctly 
catalyzes production staggered nicks cosn, sites n1 n2 the
bottom top strands, respectively. atp omitted, bottom strand is
nicked incorrectly, site nx, 8 bp left n1. r3 removed or
disabled point mutation, nicking cosn becomes dependent upon atp but,
even presence atp, bottom strand nicking divided sites n1,
the correct site, nx, incorrect one. thus, r3 important regulatory 
element must reside cis respect cosn. furthermore, cosn substrates
bearing point mutations n1 n2 nicked sites nx ny, 8 bp the
left n1 n2, respectively. r3 present atp added, nicking 
redirected n1 n2 positions despite mutations present. thus,
terminase binding r3, one side cosn, regulates rotationally
symmetric nicking reactions bottom top strands within cosn.
